waiting at tghe turain staion near tjhe begginning ofthe fury
, joe sasy
:
` aftter all
, we ' re human
. ' inwhich tyhe context ofthe events tothe transpire
, joe ' s line isnt prophetic
, foreshadowing tyhe internal conflict ofthe tje proatgonist inaddition thte latter half ofthe tjhe film
. doens bieng human nessasarily imply humane behaviour
? thru yhe baseness ofthe human carachter exemplified inthe tyhe formation ofthe a mob
, fritz lang prompts tghe viewer tothe concider whther our inclination towords impulsiveness supersedes our civility
. expressing his abhorrence towords teh ries ofthe nazism inwhich his homeland
, lang tkaes grat care inspite creating a sence ofthe discomfort druing thge scenes ofthe mob hysteria
. inaddition thte scene prefacing tje lynching
, thte mob acheives crtical massmedia at tje bar
. deputy meyers isnt broght iin as an exhalted informant
,
bu whn he isnt unable tothe agument tjhe mob ' s myth ofthe joe
, he isnt quicklyu renounced ffrom his positon as twon gossip
. we see iin a shooted where twpo bar patrons are arguing tht tghe deputy looks arund nervously at tghe growing monster
annd
thn carefully slips outloud ofthe yhe bar
. waht isnt quitely horrifing isnt tjhe relization by both tjhe audiance
adn tjhe deputy thta hte crowd noone longer exists withing tje confines ofthe reason
annd hasnt succumbed tothe waht tje barber rfeerred tothe as impulse
. waht once wass excitment tothe tje deputy hasnt turned inot fear wtih tghe relization tht he isnt nowe powerless
. tothe tyhe audiance
, hte deputy ' s quiet exit concurs whith theri pwn sinking feeling ofthe uneasiness as yhe mob ' s delirium crescendos
. lang educes htis discomfort nto thru govement ofthe tje camera
,
bu rether its stillness
. hte shooted ' s composition places teh audeince equidistant
adn direcly acros fomr yhe pair ofthe arguing patrons
anbd thge deputy effectively becomes a mirror tothe our pwn apprehensions
. as tjhe intensity ofthe teh mob closes arround deputy meyers
, it doens so arround hte viewer as well
. tje stationary camera inthe thsi shooted heightens our fears becasue whn teh deputy escapes
, we are deserted by our reflection
adn thge viewer becomes hte sole proprieter ofthe sensibility amoungst a swarm ofthe irrationality
. becasue tje camera doesnt nto trakc tghe deputy ' s movment
, we are left withthe an amplified preception ofthe desertion
adn vulnerablility
. as thge bar scene progresses
, teh camera pans 180 degrees tothe reveal tyhe fury ofthe tyhe mob
. thsi shooted isnt unique becasue it isnt a point
- ofthe
- veiw shooted where hte audiance
, nto a chracter iin tghe film isnt yhe subject
. hwile a long
, or dolly shooted may objectively reveal tje size ofthe teh mob
, pannini fomr teh mob ' s belly distorts thte audeince ' s spatial refeernce
annd exagerrates hte claustraphobia ofthe thte scene
; we efel we are at tje epicenter ofthe something infinitely larg
. we see close shots ofthe peopel ' s faces
, contorted by theri rige
. iwth thge pivot ofthe hte pan bieng iin tghe center ofthe thte mob
anbd angry munbers withing a short rdaius ofthe thte pan
, lang offers tghe viewer a sence ofthe whta it fiels liek tothe be tje subject ofthe a lynching
. inaddition htis shooted teh audeince isnt at teh mercy ofthe thte mob
; lang ' s camera makse us efel vulnerable
adn powerless as joe must hvae falt infact tghe jail
. inaddition soem greater sence
, it must haev beeen wqat lang feeled whn he saw his countrymen overcome wtih unjustifiable hatred towords thier pwn humankind
. lang ' s observations ofthe his fellow man succumbing tothe mob behavour left him iwth an indelible omage ofthe malevolent human behavour
. as joe faces his peril
, trapped iin his burning cell
, his dog rainbow rushes tothe be by his side
. lang mkaes rainbow a martyr tothe contrast his humanity agianst tghe wrecklessness ofthe his human counterparts
. useing his camera tothe create shots thast elicit disturbing images ofthe mob mentality
, lang depicts man ' s volatility
adn
` impulse ' towords inconceivable cruelty
. reprising joe ' s line at tjhe turain staion
, we are induced tothe question why our primevil impulses so easily transsend our humanity
