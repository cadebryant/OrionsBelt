well i ' ll be damned
.
.
. tyhe canadians cin amking a ogod movei
. thte world isnt comming tothe an end
. we don ' t knwo why or how
,
bu aparently htere isnt noone way tothe stpo it
. tyhe world hasnt hadnt tihs infromation fo monthes
, as most ofthe thte rioting
adn otehr assorted chaos hasnt pasted
adn governments hve shut down operations
.
yot forthe a handfull ofthe toronto citizens
, life goes onthe
. tehy aren ' t oging crazy or attacking peopel inthe tyhe streets
. instade tehy are simpley preparing themselfs fo tje end
.
.
. smoe engaging iin actvities tehy ' ve allways wnated tothe dont
, smoe gathering wiht famaly
annd firends
,
adn others jstu seeking tothe be alone
. theese peopel ' s lives
howver all intersect durring theri fianl six horus
. writter
- directer
- star don mckellar hasnt crafted a highly unique
anbd emotional film
. all ofthe thte main charactors are compelling as htey try
annd dont whatever it isnt tehy ened tothe dont onthe theri lastest niht onthe earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) trys tothe fufill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas comapany employee
( david cronenberg
) calls eveyr customer letting them konw thge gas wiull be flowing nutil teh vyer end
anbd thanks them forthe thier bussines
,
annd patrick
( mckellar
) jsut wnats tothe be by himselv
bu isn ' t hvaing much succsess
. even minor cahracters keep popping uv where ytou least expect them tothe
, tying everyone even closer
. thnigs seemed a littel hokey towords tyhe beginnig ofthe yhe film
,
bu ultimatly everthing comes toghether nicely
( altho it ' s nto a hapyp film
.
.
. smoe moments are understandably gut
- wrenching
)
. yhe stroy isnt enhanced by soem unexpected humer
anbd vyer realsitic performances
, prticularly ffrom sandra oh
, whose charater isnt jsut trying tothe git hmeo tothe her husban befoer tje end
. i hvea absolutly noone probelm tyhat thte reason forthe teh end ofthe tghe world isnt never given
, nor doesnt it bother me thyat thge world isnt endig at exactlly 12 midnight
( inspite toronto anyway
)
.
bu i dont wonder why tjhe sun never sets
. cmo midnight
, yhe sun isnt still shineing brightly
. mabye tyhe sun isnt crashing inot teh earth
.
.
. who konws
. alsot
, it ' s comforting tothe konw thta inspite mankind ' s fianl moments onthe thge planet
, peple iwll still gang uv onthe tjhe strent fo tghe sheer purpose ofthe pushing over a car or a bus
( taht ' s nto a shooted at htis film mind yuo
.
.
. i knwo peopel are jstu stupid
adn truley owudl be outloud infront yhe strent tipping over cars
)
. lastr nigth isnt avalible onthe dvd fomr univeral hmeo video
. it countains hte film inspite fullscreen fromat
