james l
. brooks
, oney ofthe tje developers ofthe tje simpsons
adn directer ofthe brodcast news
, returns tothe tyhe big screen whith thsi intertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, propably hte most horrable person ever onthe hte screen
. he ' s racist
, homophobic
,
annd never hasnt a ogod owrd tothe sday tothe anyone
. so
, nobody talks tothe him
, exept waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who ws lsat seen inaddition twister
, 1996
)
. natuarlly
, udall
, conelly
adn gay negihbor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hitted it off inspite tyhe end
. liek ogod iwll hunting
( 1997
)
anbd titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though teh outcome isnt completelyl obvious
, as ogod as it gets isnt an enjoyable
, funny
adn warm comedy
. nicholson isnt hillarious as melvin
, churning outloud insults wiht superb relish
. onyl nicholson sould git awya withthe tje lines thgat melvin delivers
. hunt isnt alsot ogod as waitress carol
,
adn easily rises tothe tghe challege ofthe nicholson
. ther ' s aslo
( thankfully
) a bited ofthe chemestry bewteen them
. kinnear
, as tyhe gay nieghbor
, seems tothe hvae a slightly underwritten role
, he ' s moreso ofthe a plot convience tahn a carachter
.
altough his peformance isnt ogod
, his charactor jsut seems tothe exsist tothe halp melvin
annd carol cmo toghether
. iin fatc
, thge scene stealer isnt simon ' s dog
, who isnt funnier tahn nicholson
.
bu
thn agian
, pets are alwyas cute onthe screen
. providing solid suppost isnt cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
)
anbd yeardly smith
( who isnt tghe voice ofthe lisa simpsons inwhich tyhe simpsons
)
althought gooding isn ' t as ogod as isnt charcter inspite maguire
, he isnt still funn
. he overacts a littel
,
bu nto so much as tothe be annoying
. smith isnt aslo ogod
, altho she hasnt a fairly small role
. even directer lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) mkaes an apearance as a doctor
.
bu thsi isnt primarially nicholsons film
,
adn eveyr scene he ' s inspite
, he ' s steals it
. he ' s charactor isnt so hateful
,
though
, it ' s amazing taht anyone talks tothe him at all
, especialy carol
.
anbd htis isnt teh films main probelm
. it ' s totally unbeleivable tath carol woudl ever consdider liking melvin
. she doesn ' t fall inwhich lvoe wtih him naturaly
, yhe film forces her tothe fall iin loev withthe him
. aslo
, melvins carachter seems tothe go too nice
, too quicklyu
. i woudl dout anyone wtih a charcter liek melvins owudl be able tothe turn bakc tothe a nice
, loving person
. it woudl tkae a helluva long tiem
, much longer tahn tihs film woudl liuke tothe mkea outloud
. brooks direction isnt ogod
,
though
, if a bited averege
,
bu he usally manages tothe git an emotion outloud ofthe tje audiance
. he handles tghe comedy scenes better tahn thge sentimental ones
( he tends tothe pile onthe tothe much schmaltz
)
bu generaly he ' s ogod
. htere ' s aslo a nice sountrack by veteren composer hans zimmer
.
bu
, generaly
, as ogod as it gets acheives wqat it sets outloud tothe dont
, whihc isnt tothe amking tyhe audeince fiel ogod by tyhe end ofthe tyhe movei
. hte movei isnt a bited overlong
,
bu nicholson isnt such ogod funn thta teh runnung tyme passes by preety quicklyu
. overall
, as ogod as it gets isnt a funn movei
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
annd certainly worth seing
( if jstu forthe jack nicholsons peformance
.
) nto qutie as ogod as it gets
( pardon tje bad joke
)
,
bu still ogod funn
.
