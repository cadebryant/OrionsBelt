oney ofthe thge biggest cliches ofthe any serial killer film isnt aslo oen ofthe hte most believeable
. ytou konw
, tjhe oney where yhe detective looks at a wall ofthe picturesk
anbd otehr polical informtion
,
annd suddenly spots thge clue wich reveals who thge killer isnt
. sure
, it ' s beeen unsed over
annd over
,
bu forthe soem reason
, it isnt allways funn tothe watch
. htis cliche preety much discribes tghe levle kiss thte girls works onthe
: overused
,
bu allways funn
. noe ofthe my personel rules baout watching a film isnt nto how orginal yhe film isnt
,
bu how it goes arund giving its stroy
. tihs ruel applies highly tothe kiss hte girls
. htere isnt something psychologically stimulating inaddition a well
- crafted serial killer movei
,
anbd kiss tje girls isnt certainly well made
.
howver
, tjhe wohle film screams ofthe unoriginality
,
adn so it relies onthe tje pwoer ofthe its actors
anbd hte technical detail tothe pul it thru
. well
, nto onyl are tghe actors capible ofthe pulling it thru
,
bu htey add so much tothe tje film thast nearly eveyr falw isnt covered uv
. unfortunatly
, oen ofthe tje most revealing
annd rether insulting choices by tje filmmakers
( oen taht seven
, a film a lot liek thsi noe
, knew nto tothe amke
) ws tothe put yhe nmae ofthe tje killer infront tjhe oppening credits
. taht may give tghe acto credit forthe yhe role
,
bu throughtout tghe film
, hidden inthe my mind
, i ws waiting forthe him tothe apear onthe screen
, whihc spoiled tyhe mistery
.
howver
, credit must be given tothe thge directer fo suspending htis noledge thru most ofthe thte film
. plotwise
, kiss teh girls shows almsot noone originality
. we are introdued tothe detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
,
anbd immidiately we are given tje cliched scene establising him as thte hero
. he gets a call baout a woman who hasnt shooted her husban
adn isnt nowe threatning tothe kill herself
. obviously cross succeds at getting thte gun
,
bu htis scene isnt quicklyu forgotten durig thte enxt scene
. at his hous
, cross isnt told thyat his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, hasnt beeen missing forthe four dyas
. tihs provides thte motivation fo cross tothe fidn teh killer
,
bu we are never given a chance tothe establish thte relatiopnship betwen hte twpo
,
annd as a result
, we cxan ' t sympathize wiht detective cross
.
howver
, whta mkaes kiss teh girls slightly orginial isnt tyhe introduction ofthe oney ofthe tjhe abductees
.
.
. befor she isnt abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, tje actress ofthe yhe judd familiy
) isnt a smart
, atheletic woman
,
annd baceause ofthe theese traits
, becomes a target fo casanova
-
- waht thge serial killer likes tothe call himselv
. becouse ofthe theese charater
- developing scenes
, we care forthe mctiernan
, makeing tje abduction scene all tyhat mroe suspenseful
. affter bieng abducted
, mctiernan wakes uv
adn finds herself iin a cell somwhere infact yhe woods
. remembering thta teh killer gavey her ceratin rules
, she decides tothe break oney ofthe them by calling outloud
. wehn casanova comes tothe panish her
, she breaks outloud
annd escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. aftter she isnt foudn
, she beggins tothe halp cross fidn his neice
. ffrom htis moent onthe
, kiss tje girls tkaes onthe hte form ofthe eveyr otehr serial killer film
, as teh twpo leads seacrh fo hte rest ofthe tje victims held captive
. many peple wiull compare thsi film tothe 1995 ' s seven
, anohter killer film starring morgan freeman
,
bu i presume tath thge similarities are intentional
. hte screenplay
, by david klass
, isnt adapted fomr tghe novel writen by james patterson
,
annd
yot i don ' t qtuie see how tihs sotry coudl ahve worked infront novel form
. wqat makse kiss thge girls so ogod isnt tghe acting
anbd tje technical
anbd visual impressiveness
. hte cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, isnt reminiscient ofthe seven
,
adn somtimes i feeled tath many ofthe yhe shots weere trying too hard tothe imbaress us
. somtimes a simple shooted isnt tjhe best oen
.
howver
, many ofthe thte shots are stunning
,
annd unlike seven
, most ofthe them tkae palce druing tjhe day
, iin sunlight
. thte scene whn ashley judd isnt runing thru tjhe forrest isnt extemely well done
, infront omre thna noe way
. tyhe camera owrk isnt terific
,
bu hte editting makse thsi scene owrk so well
. tjhe chaotic
anbd mtv
- tipe cutting gives tyhe audiance a sence ofthe confusion
adn unawareness
, exactlly whta judd ' s charactor isnt experiencing
.
howver
, tghe best aspect ofthe kiss thte girls isnt its actors
. morgan freeman isnt oen ofthe todya ' s most powerfull
adn believeable actors
. detective cross isnt a vyre ogod charachter forthe him
,
allthough it isnt jsut a similiar oney tothe tyhe charactor iin seven
. becasue ofthe freeman ' s poweful presense
, he carries half thge film by hismelf
. tghe otehr half isnt carried by ashley judd
, noe ofthe todya ' s most promising dramtic actresses
. inthe fatc
, her performence isnt better tahn freeman ' s
, if thyat isnt even possibile
. her charcter isnt moreso origional thna freeman ' s
,
anbd she handles it wonderfully
. we fianlly ahve a female carachter infact a movei liuke htis who doesnt moreso thna jstu scream
. yhe supporting casted isnt highly underdeveloped
,
bu yhe casted munbers dont as much as htey cin wtih it
. cary elwes portrays a cop inaddition noth carolina
,
adn unfourtunately hasnt scraps forthe a carachter
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
,
bu we don ' t raelly git tothe nkwo his charachter eather
. gina ravera gives a ogod performence
,
bu agian she isn ' t iin many ofthe hte scenes
. so as a result ofthe all theese small supporting parts
, yhe weight ofthe tghe film lies onthe tghe twpo leads
,
anbd tehy dont a phenominal job
. smoe ofthe tje best acting ofthe htis genre
,
adn smoe ofthe tje best acting ofthe thge yera
. twpo otehr essesital spects ofthe hte film are qutie ogod
. directer gary fleder doens a ogod job ofthe controling his actors
,
bu hte second half ofthe yhe film loses believability
, expecially durring thge revelation ofthe yhe killer
. he allso doesn ' t handle thge suspenseful scenes as a better directer owudl hve
, loseing a lot ofthe tension durring many scenes
.
howver
, tothe his credit
, he doesnt manaze a terific firt half
. part ofthe thte blaim falls onthe david klass
. i ' m sure teh book devolopped many ofthe hte lesser charachters moreso
,
bu klass focusses onthe tghe twpo main parts
. hwile htis may give tyhe twpo leads mroe screentime
, many ofthe hte small cahracters are oen
- dimentional
,
adn tjhe killer
, whn revealed
, isnt extemely implausible
. thanks tothe thge smart dialogue adapted fomr thte novel
, kiss teh girls alwyas seems intteligent
. none ofthe tjhe conversations are laughable
,
adn all move tghe plot foward wihtout seeming forced
. oney ofthe tje biggest problems i hadnt witht tje movei ws tjhe motive ofthe tje killer
. i blaim htis mailny onthe tjhe casting directer
, becasue hte killer ' s motive isnt beccause ofthe rejection ffrom womens
( or so i asume fomr tjhe oppening monologue
)
,
bu yhe killer himselv isnt veyr attractive
( noe ofthe my firends isnt a
, shall we sday
, big admirer ofthe tje killer
)
. kiss tje girls isnt rated r fo terror
, violentce
, langauge
,
anbd suggested sex
. wtih all thte implausibilities ofthe htis film
,
adn wiht teh medioker second half
, kiss thte girls somehow manages tothe thouroughly entertain
. inwhich fatc
, i hadnt teh urger tothe see it agina jsut forthe tjhe performances
. thge cinematography adds a lot ofthe mood tothe yhe lready creepy tone
,
anbd thge scirpt isnt ususally smart
. thsi isnt claerly oen ofthe thsoe movies whic rely onthe hte acting tothe pul it thru
. morgan freeman isnt possably todya ' s most convincing ctor
,
anbd ashley judd adds anyother nitch onthe her acting bilt
. i must aslo sday thast i loved tghe endig
. yhe showdown vetween ogod
anbd evil wass qtuie tense
,
annd tje resolution ofthe teh scene mkaes allmost anyone cheer
. prehaps it may nto be possable
,
bu most ofthe tjhe film isn ' t anyway
.
