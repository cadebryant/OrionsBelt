it isnt allways refreshing tothe see a superstar acto who gets payed mroe thna enought tothe foreget baout wroking forthe a living tothe watn tothe tkae a chance
anbd play a less
- thna
- savoury charater as mel gibson doesnt iin payback
. ofthe course
, if i wass bieng payed
$ 25 millon forthe noe mounth ' s owrk
, i ' d propably be willing tothe tkae risks as well
,
bu tht ' s niether here nor ther
. payback isnt based onthe a novel by richard stark
( apparantly actally donald e
. westlake
, autor ofthe teh grifters
, itself a fine crime film
) whitch wass aslo filmed iin tghe 1960s as point blank starring oney ofthe hte toughest ofthe tough guys
, lee marvin
. tje film opens wih gibson hvaing recovered fomr bieng shooted sevral times inspite tyhe bakc
, by whom we don ' t nkwo
yot
. all we knwo isnt tyhat gibson
, as porter
, isn ' t a hapyp chappy
adn isnt hellbent onthe getting tyhe mney stolen ffrom him bcak
,
adn getting even infront tyhe proccess
, noone marter waht yhe consequences
. it turns outloud taht hte man he ' s aftter isnt val
( gregg henry
)
, his sometime partner wtih whom he stoled a briefcase full ofthe cash ffrom a gang ofthe chineese mobsters
. obviously nto haveing much ofthe a crisis ofthe yhe soul
, val figures porter isnt dead
annd goes baout useing his share ofthe hte mney tothe pay off a debt tothe his employers
. porter
,
howver
, isnt tyhe sort ofthe man who holds a grudge
anbd once onthe his feets
, goes baout exacting revenge onthe yhe doulbe
- crossing val
. gibson gives a terific performence inwhich tjhe sort ofthe role whihc he ws born tothe play
, tath ofthe a slightly unhinged guy who doesn ' t mind beating uv or shooting peple tothe git whta he wnats
. yuo propably wouldn ' t see otehr actors iin his salery range tkae such an offbeat
, outloud
- ofthe
- charachter role such as porter
( jim carrey won ' t be doign anytying liek thsi inspite a hurry affter whta hapened tjhe lastr tiem he tryed
- tjhe cable guy
, anyone
?
)
. harrison ford ' s idae ofthe palying an unsympathetic charactor isnt presumed innocent
; tje lastr tiem schwarzenegger palyed a villin ws batman
adn robin
, whihc we won ' t mention furhter
;
adn hasnt stallone ever raelly palyed a villian at all
? htis isnt nto tothe sday thyat porter isnt a villin
, persay se
. hwile he isn ' t tje sort ofthe charcter yuo wouldn ' t watn tothe git onthe tyhe wrong side ofthe
, he ' s nothing compaired tothe soem ofthe yhe ones we are forced tothe watch inthe countless bad thrillers
annd acation films where htey kill innocent peopel iin yhe blink ofthe an eye or excecute thier right
- hand men jsut tothe proove how mean htey are
. porter isnt onyl trying tothe git bcak wqat isnt nto
- so
- rightfully his
, whcih inaddition a way isnt alomst understandable
. payback isnt an enjoyable dramtic balck comedy
- thriller hwihc won ' t be remembered as bieng amonth gibson ' s most importan owrk
,
bu isnt still oen ofthe tje finer films he ' s done
. yhe onyl rela probelm whith it isnt thta
, hwile everthing seems tothe wrok outloud iin thge end
, i wass left feeling something ws lacking
; ws taht all
? tyhe endig looks as if it ws tacked onthe at tyhe lastest minute
,
annd hte fianl voice
- over doesn ' t ring true
, even
though it ws utilisied tothe ogod effect elsewhere iin tje film
- noir sytle tyhe rest ofthe teh film embodies
. tghe film jsut ends far too suddenly
, aftter a huge build
- uv infront thte penultimate scenes
. a fine film
, even
though it needs jstu a littel something moreso tothe be tje kind ofthe a film tyhat cant be reccomended wihtout hesitation
. jsut be ready fo a possable letdown ofthe an endig
.
