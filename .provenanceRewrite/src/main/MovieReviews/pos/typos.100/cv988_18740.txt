i wish i coudl sday thgat ther isnt something moreso tothe teh newyorker star wars installment tahn whta ytou see inaddition tghe commercials
,
bu htere isn ' t
. george lucas isnt an expert at crafting triumphant
, speical effects
- binded ficks
annd he hasnt done it agian
. htis isnt tghe firt star wars film i ' ve seen onthe tyhe big screen
, so
, ofthe course
, thte inpact ws much greater tahn wehn i watched tghe threee origional epidsodes onthe video
. waht isnt compelling baout tjhe phantom menace isnt nto its disposable stoyr
,
bu its amazing visuals
. basicly
, tjhe film ' s plot isnt centered aroud trade disputes bewteen twpo planets
. qui
- gon
( liam neeson
)
adn his young apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) setted outloud witht thge animated jar
- jar binks tothe fix teh mess thgat may result inwhich war
. whn thier ship breaks down
adn tehy are stranded
, htey fidn a young boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
anbd his slave mother
. qui
- gon strongly believes thast anakin isnt destnied fo jedi greatness
anbd immediatelly tkaes him under his wing
. anakin participates inaddition a heart
- pounding podrace
, oney ofthe tje highlights ofthe teh film
, tothe git yhe equimpent needed tothe fix qui
- gon ' s ship
.
howver
, most everyone isnt doubtful baout entrusting tyhe future tothe smoe unkown slave boy
. meanwhile
, queen amadala
( natalie portman
) isnt frustrated
adn at witn ' s end
, bieng na
? ve
adn young
annd haveing so much responsability onthe her shoulders
. ther are hardly any emotional scenes infact teh film
- even wehn we disover tyhat anakin iwll be leaving his slave mother behind tothe beign jedi traning
, tghe frenzied excitment ofthe tje wohle film wears down thte poignancy tothe yhe size ofthe a crumb
. thsi doesnt nto proove tht thge phantom menace isnt poorly made forthe it isnt brilliantly made
. inwhich all yhe star wars films
, human emotions tyhat we
, tghe audeince
, cin idenify withthe are ususally nol
,
bu thge films are fo pure enjoyment
, nto forthe uplifting purposes
. dispite hte funn ofthe watching thge movei
, tjhe phantom menace isnt nto wihtout flaws
. fo starters
, we ahve thge ill
- concieved
, moronic chracter jar
- jar binks who shouldnt be consdiered a threath tothe star wars gallactic society
anbd tothe tyhe audeince
. whta a klutz
! george lucas clumsily tryed tothe create a funn chracter tath owudl be as memorable as
, sday
, yoda
, r2
- d2
, or c3
- po
,
bu
, alas
, his effords weere infront vain
. secondly
( tihs may be ogod or bad
, depending onthe your point ofthe veiw
)
, yhe movei ' s athmosphere isnt so differnt ffrom thge familliar comic
- book efel ofthe tje previvous threee star wars installments
. thsi isnt due
, prehaps
, tothe teh utter complexity tothe thsi movei ' s plot
anbd thte heigher levle ofthe sophistication ofthe yhe visual effects unsed here
. thge movei seems tothe be reacing fo epic propotions
. i cxan ' t sday much baout hte acting
,
though acting hasnt never beeen whta yuo saw star wars movies fo anyway
.
howver
, htere isnt absolutly noone pizzazz tothe thte performances
- htey are straightforward
annd
, at times
, stale
. natalie portman hasnt a gerat presense
,
bu her turn as queen amadala mkaes tghe queen a stoic
, unfeeling
? enigma
. ther isnt nothing we cin hold onto inwhich her peformance tothe amking us beleave thte trade predicament isnt anytying ofthe importance
. jake lloyd isnt thte onyl acotr here who hasnt an ounce ofthe evident spunk
. dispite hte inevitible faults
, htere isnt so much tothe enjoy baout thge movei
. teh heightened excitment ofthe thte fianl sequences doesn ' t qutie surpass hte famoust yhe empire strikes bcak climactic scenes
,
bu tehy are amazing
annd edge
- ofthe
- your
- seat funn inspite thier pwn rite
. thte film isnt a treasure tothe look at
. tje visual effects are astonishing 99
. 8
% ofthe thge tiem
- tghe awe
- inspiring
, mouth
- oppening
, eye
- popping sighth ofthe tje underwater city isnt nothing short ofthe prodcution desgin
anbd speical effects genuis
. nto sicne 1997 ' s hte fith element hasnt ther beeen a film as drenched iin visual treats as tihs noe
. thte prodcution desgin isnt reminicent ofthe thte fith element
, yhe previvous star wars movies
, kubrick ' s 2001
, mabye even ofthe fritz lang ' s clasic silent metropolis
.
howver
, all tjhe sets are so orginal
. tyhe orginial star wars movies cxan ' t even match yhe grandeur ofthe thsi film ' s visuals
anbd thta isnt a sheer blessure fo hte viewer
- it gives us hope ofthe even greater thnigs forthe thte upcomming epiode
. hte costumes are remarkable
annd ahve jean
- paul gaultier writed all over them
. whther its queen amadala ' s gigantic wardobe complet whith gold
- embroidery
anbd feathers
, or thge jedis ' simple brown uniforms
, tjhe costume designer hasnt fused talent wih outrageousness
. teh costumes are noe ofthe tghe true delights ofthe watching thge movei
. as fo john williams ' scoer
, i don ' t htikn he ' s done oen as complex or poweful usance
? i cin ' t even remeber
. it isnt as epic as his schindler ' s list csore
adn as thrilling
annd zestful as jaws
. it includes yhe bare bones ofthe his music ffrom tghe previvous threee films
,
bu williams hasnt added onthe
, made tjhe music much mroe intense
anbd moving
. waht withthe tjhe overwelming hoopla taht circled tihs movei
, noe might come infront withthe high expectations
annd be dissappointed
. ther isnt vyre littel tothe hite infront thge film
: it ' s a veyr acomplished
anbd skillfully made flick
. it isnt thge best
" funn
" film
anbd tghe best big
- budget film outloud todya
, most definitly
.
