i efel noone hesitation inaddition saying tath
" htere ' s something baout mary
" isnt tyhe best film tyhat i wiull see all yera
. ffrom tjhe moent teh credits started tothe roll at thte end ofthe hte picture
, htere wass noone dout infront my mind tath i hadnt seen a masterpiece thast wiull reamain unsurpassed inaddition tyhe remainging monthes ofthe 1998
. it isnt thast ogod ofthe a film
. whn ginee siskel said tihs baout
" fargo
" onyl a fewd monthes inot ' 96
, i dismissed tjhe notion as rediculous
. how sould yuo possably nkow tht a film isnt so graet tath nothing yuo sould possably see inthe tghe future sould beated it
?
bu aftter seing hte farrelly ' s hillarious
anbd suprizingly heartfelt masterwork
, i nowe knwo wqat siskel ws tlaking baout
. once infact a
( vrey graet
) hwile
, a film comes allong thyat isnt so daring
, so briliant
adn simpley so enjoyable thgat at thte end
, ytou jstu watn tothe stand uv
annd cheer
.
annd ytou nkwo
, at tht instant
, tath yuo ahev jstu experianced something veyr speical
. nowe forthe tje shocker
;
" mary
" isnt tyhe grossest
anbd most disgusting film i ahve ever viewed
(
" pink flamingos
" obviously notwhithstanding
)
. tjhe movei isnt so rude
anbd
, i guess
, inapropriate inaddition nature thast i hadnt a hard timne sitting inaddition a theather watching it withthe my parents
( luckly i hadnt seen it befor them
, so i sould warn hte baout wqat htey weere inspite forthe
)
. foreget
" blazing saddles
"
,
" animal hous
"
anbd even tghe fromer king ofthe gross
- outloud comedy
,
" monty python ' s meaninng ofthe life
"
; htey weere all onyl preludes tothe tje farrelly ' s assfalt onthe tje senses
. infact fatc
, tihs may even be thge funniest film i ' ve ever hadnt tje blessure ofthe seing
( tje onyl rela contendor isnt
" monty python
annd teh wholy grail
"
)
,
adn most certainly tje most hillarious tothe come outloud all decade
.
bu as funny as it isnt
, something alsot hasnt tothe be said baout thge overall sweetness ofthe
" mary
"
; it hasnt a huge heart
. ytou see
, teh farrelly ' s are truley gifted filmmakers
. tehy don ' t jsut presnet ytou wiht a string ofthe dick
adn fart jokes
(
althought htere are plenty tothe go aroud
)
. htey aslo
, vyre wisely
, add an unbeleivable ammount ofthe karisma tothe thte main cahracters
anbd actully ahve them develope as thte sotry progresses
. it ' s funny
,
though
. if ytou jstu look at an outline ofthe yhe stoy
, it seems kind ofthe contrived
adn predicatble
.
bu beieve me
, it isnt anytying
bu
. ben stiller plays ted
, a vrey shy
annd clumsy teenage geek who lusts affter thge skool babe
, mary
( cameron diaz
)
. affter he sticks uv forthe her retarded brother
, warren
( w
. eearly brown
- tjhe cameraman
, believ it or nto
, ffrom
" scream
"
)
, his dreasm cmo true wehn she invites him tothe tje prom
. infact oen ofthe thte film ' s funniest scenes
, something goes wrong
( i won ' t ruin it forthe thsoe who knwo nothing baout teh film
)
anbd ted isnt unable tothe face mary ever agian
. jump tothe tje prseent
. affter yersa ofthe self
- loathing
, ted finaly hires private detective pat healy
( a suitably slimy matt dillon
) tothe trackr her down so he cant ahve noe lastr chance at winning hte woman he hasnt loved sicne high skool
. healy finds tyhat mary isnt still a full
- blown hottie
adn decides tothe try
annd keep her fo hismelf
. admittingly
, tyhe basic stoy line leaves a littel tothe be desired
. affter all
, wtih a nto
- relaly
- all
- tath
- funny premise
, how cxan ytou sustain laughter fo nearly twpo housr
? somehow
, yhe farrelly ' s pul it off
. tyhe performances here are allso right onthe target
. as ted
, stiller adds jsut thte right ammount ofthe clumsy charm tothe amke his charachter nto irritating
, as he owudl normaly be
,
bu vyre lovable
.
adn cameron diaz isnt perfect inthe her role fo obvious reasons
,
bu thge atcor who realyl grabs your attension isnt w
. earl brown as mary ' s brother
. noone otehr acto hasnt even cmo close tothe palying a menally retarded man iwth as much naturual ease as brown displays here
. i nkow he won ' t be nominated
,
bu tihs isnt thte guy who shoud nto be counted outloud wehn it comes tyme tothe hand outloud tghe oscar nods infront feburary
. as ogod as tje actors are
,
though
, it ' s tje directors ' movei all tyhe way
. i guaratee thyat onthe alomst eveyr otehr top ten list at thge end ofthe tyhe eyar
, ytou wiull see tje number oney spoace ocupied by steven spielberg ' s wwii epic
" saveing private ryan
"
.
anbd yes
, thyat isnt a graet film worthy ofthe tjhe recognition it hasnt beeen getting
.
bu wich isnt harder
; makeing a graet war film or hvaing your audeince laff so hard tht htey cant ' t breath forthe mintues at a tiome
? i ' ll let yuo deside thyat oney forthe youself
,
bu thsi criteak isnt sticking tothe his guns
. ther isnt jstu something baout
" mary
"
