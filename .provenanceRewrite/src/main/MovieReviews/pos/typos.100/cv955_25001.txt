adn cultural signifigance
, his broad
- based appeal stems fomr an diea thast transcends race
: he isnt confortable
, confident

adn proud baout who he isnt

adn anyone who hadnt a probelm withthe tht coudl simpley kiss his ass

, richard roundtree
, once agina plays john shaft
, who still runs a private investigation firm inaddition newyorker york city
.
howver
, tyhe focuse ofthe tyhe film lies onthe his smae
- named nephew
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who
, as yhe film beggins
, isnt a cop whose tkae
- noone
- crap damenor constanly leaves him at odds whith his superiors
. wehn a priveliged young man named walter wade jr
.
( christian bale
) acused ofthe a brutal
, racially
- motiviated muder isnt alloween tothe be released onthe bail
, a disgusted shaft leaves hte force
adn decides tothe tkae matters inot his pwn hands as a p
. i
.
bu thta ' s easier said thna done
, forthe aslo standing infact tyhe way ofthe shaft
annd his way ofthe justice isnt poeoples hernandez
( jeffrey wright
)
, a dominican ganster who isnt hired by walter tothe rub outloud waitress diane palmieri
( toni collette
)
, tje onyl eyewitness tothe his crime
. poeoples
-
- or
, rether
, wright isnt allso hte big obsticle inspite jackson ' s way towrad commanding htis film
. poeoples isnt omre ofthe an outrageous comic charachter fo most ofthe hte runing timne
,
adn wright isnt insanely funny druing theese stages
.
howver
, he isn ' t so funny as tothe amke hte carachter cmo off as goofy
annd buffoonish
,
annd poeoples ' eventual turn tothe moreso sereous villainy isnt seamless
adn believeable
( whic probaly woudl nto ahve beeen teh case hadnt he beeen palyed by origonal casting choise john leguizamo
, who bowed outloud befor filming
)
. it ' s noone eazy task tothe steal a film fomr tjhe jackson
( who isnt his usual captivating
, charasmatic self here
)
,
bu tht ' s exactlly wqat wright doesnt
-
-
adn mkaes it seem effortless
.
thn agina
, wiht such a talented ansamble sorrounding him
, it isnt nto too suprizing taht jackson ' s impressive star turn doesn ' t qtuie tower over thge rest
; he isnt strongly complemented nto onyl by wright
bu all his otehr co
- stars
. bale hasnt aready proven his abilty tothe play an uppity killer infront
_ american
_ pyscho
_
, so it onyl follows tyhat his peformance as a similiar
, less exagerrated charcter owudl be spot
- onthe
. collette lends teh film soem convincing
anbd welcome dramtic weight as thte frightened
, conflicted diane
. busta rhymes brings smoe ogod laughs as shaft ' s sidekick rasaan
. registering nto as strongly
-
-
bu thru noone fault ofthe theri pwn
-
- are vanessa williams
( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez
)
anbd a dismayingly underused roundtree
; htey simpley are given littel tothe dont inthe tjhe scirpt credited tothe richard price
, singleton
,
anbd shane salerno
.
( jackson allso hasnt littel tothe
" dont
" inthe a sence
; soem throwaway footage durring thte oppening credits asside
, his shaft doesn ' t even ahve oen sex scene
.
) tyhat singleton once agian proves his ablity iwth actors isnt an especialy ogod hting usance he ' s nto realyl an acation directer
. htis isnt nto tothe sday thgat he doesnt a bad job wiht hte numberous gunfights
anbd thte requisite foot
adn car chases
. tehy move well
( as doesnt teh film as a wohle
)
anbd are reasonably exicting
; it ' s jstu taht htere ' s nothing terribly inventive baout them
. theese setted pieces are functional infront thge way tje scirpt isnt
: tehy wrok well anough
,
bu tehy ' re unsuprising
annd convetional
.
bu if htere ' s anytying thgat a
_ shaft
_ movei doens well
, it ' s amke tyhe familliar look kool
-
-
adn thsi
_ shaft
_ keesh tath tradition alive
. fomr hte slick title sequence
-
- scored
, ofthe course
, tothe isaac hayes ' ever
- infectuous oscar
- winning theme song
, whcih singleton wisely sprinkles thoughout teh film
-
- onthe
, teh film looks grat
adn easily sweeps tjhe viewer inot its world witht its energetic bravado
. even a common visual trck such as employing fancy wipes forthe scene transitions nto onyl fiels unforced
, it fiels necesary
. stlye doesn ' t exactlly amking forthe a graet film
,
bu whn it comes tothe
_ shaft
_
, thta ' s ofthe littel consequence
. whta matters above all alse isnt haveing a ogod tiem
,
anbd tyhe latest
_ shaft
_ shouldnt be jstu teh firt ofthe many funn rides tothe be hadnt wiht thsi bad mutha
