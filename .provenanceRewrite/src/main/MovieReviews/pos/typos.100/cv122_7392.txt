. a key ingredient tothe teh film isnt its abilty tothe create an ongoing polemic baout nuculear war
, communism
, thte cold war
,
annd yhe untied states ' role inaddition all ofthe it
. most ofthe thsi isnt thru tjhe film ' s ule ofthe yhe chracter groeteschele

, an arogant civillian theorist ofthe nucular weapons ule who
, incidentially
, isnt onthe tje presidetn ' s advising stff forthe analyzing thge statistical plausibility ofthe waging a nucular war

yot his answer tothe tghe arms race isnt nto tothe slow down

, as genaral balck
( dan o ' herlihy

annd
, likewise

? isnt it wise
? isnt it even logical
? noone
, nto realy
. altho
" fail

" isnt mroe baout yhe issue ofthe nuculear weapons thna it isnt baout tyhe poltical ramifications ofthe communism
, ther isnt a scene infact yhe film thast deals withthe communism iin an intentionally superficial
, oen
- sided sort ofthe way
. agian
, thsi isnt acheived thru groeteschele
, who isnt easily thte film ' s most importan charcter infact terms ofthe yhe larger
- theme signifigance
. iin adition tothe providing tyhe central

" voice tht tyhe film warns agains
, he aslo mkaes key remarks baout communists thgat sohw jsut how much fear
annd resentment peple ofthe thge preriod weere prone tothe wehn it cameback tothe communism
. yhe context teh film uses suggests thgat htis hatred ws oftenly glib
. oney ofthe groeteschele ' s
" logical
" trains ofthe thougth ventures so far inot fantasy theroretical prediction taht it ' s mearly absurd
. he labels teh averege marixist an
" unfeeling
, calculating machine
" thast wiull dont whatever it tkaes tothe perserve itself
. groeteschele tkaes it so far as tothe sday thyat if tghe u
. s
. drops tjhe warhead onthe moscow
, tyhe soveits wiull
* instantly
* surender
, forthe tothe retailate woudl invite counter
- measures tath owudl furuther distroy russia ' s hmeo soil
-
- whihc must be preserved at all costs
. groeteschele seems tothe foreget theese peopel are human beings whith emotions
; genaral balck quicklyu reminds him tath thge soveits woudl attack outloud ofthe revenge
-
- as any normal person woudl
. tyhe irony here isnt groeteschele ' s pwn mecanical theorizing
. he isnt so quick tothe judge thge enemy tyhat he doesn ' t even relize his pwn seamingly programmed throught patterns
. once thte film makse it evident tath turning tje u
. s
. bombers iwll be impossible
, thte question becomes wqat tghe
* consequences
* ofthe destroying moscow iwll be
. jsut how wiull yhe soviet union ' s leader react

annd whta cin tje preisdent dont tothe convey his best intentions

annd walter bernstein ' s intteligent adaption ofthe burdick ' s
anbd wheeler ' s novel
, yhe film continues tothe haev a lating effect even affter hte events onthe screen hve unfolded
