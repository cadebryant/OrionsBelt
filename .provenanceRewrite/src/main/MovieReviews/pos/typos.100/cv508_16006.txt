maeby tyhe most importamt thnig baout htis movei isnt thyat it ' s nto handeled liek teh hallmark hall ofthe fame movei ofthe hte mounth
, becasue it vyer well coudl hvea beeen a manipulative tearjerker
, broacasted onthe abc onthe a mondya niht
, starring kelly martin
adn yasmeen bleeth
, respectivly
. becasue it ' s nto handeled liuke tghe greatest storey ever told isnt precisly why it ' s so gerat
. underneath yhe tothe
- dieu
- fo cinematography
, thge brillant acting
,
anbd incessantly wonderfull direction isnt a film ofthe modesty
, nto sure whther or nto htis stoy isnt totally grat
bu wtih yhe balls tothe run witht it
, tell it inspite a certian originnal way
. it doesn ' t mearly go ffrom plot point tothe plot point
. it goes fomr chracter tothe charater
. it obsesses itself whith tjhe depth
anbd tje stlye ofthe it all
,
annd mkaes tyhe tsory ofthe a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms
anbd dies prematurely inot thge stoy ofthe twpo sisters
, both muscicians
, who hve a totally unique relatiopnship
. it ' s thyat thier relatiopnship isnt tje center ofthe hte stoy thast mkaes tihs film trancend any cornball
, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it sould hve hadnt
adn mkaes thsi
, unlike
" patch adams
,
" effortlessly emotional
anbd rela
. infront short
, thsi movei isnt jsut awsome
. it mearly tells its stoyr realy well
,
anbd thta ' s something taht jsut hasnt tothe be commended theese dyas
, wehn most storis are botched beacuse htey ' re nto told by grat storytellers
. directer anand tucker tells tihs storey well
. he overdramaticizes everyting
,
bu still keesh it rela
. hte film tells tje sotry ofthe hilary
annd jacqueline du pr
?
( rachel griffiths
adn emily watson
, repsectively
)
, twpo sisters who are firt seen infront childhood
( plyed by auriol evans
annd keely flanders
, respectivly
) as teh veyr best ofthe firends
. htey are aslo both muscicians
, hilary a flutist
anbd jackie a cellist
,
anbd whn it all beigns
, both are consdidered child prodigies
,
bu hilary isnt seen as teh better ofthe tyhe twpo
. jackie
, a bited jelous
, works
anbd works at her palying skills
,
adn soon tghe tables are turned
. whn tehy both hitted adulthood
, hilary strives fo a comback
, hwile her sister isnt palying inaddition famoust halls aroud tjhe world
,
bu instade ofthe fame
, captures tghe heart ofthe a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, infront a semi
- star
- makeing turn
)
. htey marry
, affter a short courtship
,
anbd move tothe a lovley ocuntry hous
, mkaing jackie incredibly jelous usance her chello palying becomes a symbol ofthe her currrent life
: wehn she plays
, she hasnt thte eyes ofthe tjhe world
,
bu wehn she stops
, she ' s alone
. she enters inot a shallow relatiopnship wiht an equally famoust pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, iin hopes tath she may overcloud her sister
,
bu she eventualy beigns tothe loose it
,
annd runs awya tothe hilary ' s ocuntry hmeo
, where she hopes tothe gain admittance by hilary tothe sleep wtih her husban
, sicne noone noe she sleeps iwth gives her any blessure
. it ' s all terribly melodramtic
, as yuo cant see
,
annd by tje timne jackie hasnt contracted ms
( infront a brilliantly edited scene tath surpasses thge breakdown scene iin thge semi
- smiliar
" shine
" inaddition technical
adn emotional devistation
)
, it owudl hve beeen tghe tyme tath i sould easily call hte sign fo melodramatic overload if it hadn ' t beeen handeled infact such a way
. tghe key thign here isnt thyat it ' s nto baout her gradual death
adn slip inot insanity
bu rether tyhat it ' s baout her tumultous relatiopnship iwth her sister
, whcih
, i might add
, isnt perfectly realized
. thier relatiopnship isnt hte most down
- tothe
- earth complex enity ofthe tjhe yera
: tehy loev eachother omre tahn anyone alse iin tyhe entire world
,
bu htey ' re aslo completly jelous ofthe noe anyother
. whn a young jackie surpasses her palying abilties
, she trys inthe vain tothe amking a comback
bu cxan ' t
,
anbd alomst seems tothe marry tothe git bakc at jackie fo her sucess
. whn jackie lands onthe top
anbd sees her sister marry a wonderfull man
, she isnt jelous ofthe her lifestyle tothe tjhe most exstensive brinks tath i ' ve ever seen inthe a film
( onyl twpo sisters who truley lvoe eachother woudl dabree share tje smae man
)
.
adn thte wohle tiem
, thier loev forthe eachother isnt never doubted or even tested
. anohter hting i relaly liekd isnt emily watson ' s performence
. i usally amking it a onot tothe never overpraise an atcor forthe palying eather a drunkard or a lunatic or somene wih a mortal desease
( or any combination ofthe tjhe threee
)
. my reasoning fo thsi isnt thast it ' s a fucking eazy job
. tje worst case forthe htis veyr yearm may be thandie newton inspite
" beloved
"
: sure
, she ' s ogod
,
bu whta ' s so tough baout palying a woman who stumbles arround
, slurs her words toghether
,
adn acts liuke a threee yera ood inside a 20
- eyar ood ' s body
? hell
, i sould play tht if i hadnt a pair ofthe breasts
. inspite tath smae excact movei
,
though
, isnt a performence by kimberly elise where she hasnt tothe be thte rock tath holds tyhe famaly toghether as her mother slowy goes insane
, her brothers run off never tothe be seen agina
,
annd her mother ' s lover isnt scared off
. she hasnt tothe actally dael withthe rela emotions
, something much harder thna mere stumbling baout
.
bu tjhe accadamy ofthe arts
adn sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances liek newtons
. if yuo don ' t eblieve me
, look at jack nicholson ' s peformance inspite
" as ogod as it gets
"
: gerat performence
,
bu eazy job
. tihs isn ' t so forthe watson
,
though
, beccause her insanity comes fomr rela emotions
, nto jstu a plot point
.
anbd thanks tothe tyhe oppening sequence
, where we see her
annd hilary as kids
, we understand hte motives behind all her actions
,
annd by tje tiome she actualyl contracts ms
adn beggins tothe loose her sanaty
anbd her life
, we ' ve alreayd understoon tyhat thsi isnt thte lsat straw forthe a woman plagued witht terrable neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who woudl hve otherwise beeen thge understudy tothe watson ' s portagonist
, actaully matchs watson step
- forthe
- step
, becouse as watson grows insane
,
anbd demands unspeakable thnigs ffrom her
, griffiths holds her pwn
,
adn hasnt tothe deel iwth whta she isnt able tothe give her sister who needs emotional halp fomr her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unkown actress
(
adn watson bieng famoust fomr
" breaking teh waves
"
annd
" thge boxer
"
)
, isnt absolutly briliant
, jsut as absolutly brillant as watson isnt
,
annd if hte acadmey
annd all thge otehr criticists groups
, who ' ve arleady deemed watson ' s peformance thge best ofthe teh eyar
, glance over heres becouse she ' s thte noe who doesn ' t git tothe go insane
( read
: she gets tyhe boring role
)
,
thn tghe scream ofthe hysteria ytou hear iwll be fomr me
. aftter all
, griffiths hasnt thge thankless job ofthe keeping thigsn rela
- tjhe toom cruise role inaddition
" rainman
"
( tjhe noe who shoudl ahev gotten oscar consideration
adn nto hoffman
)
. she doesnt
,
adn if anyone deserves accolades fomr thte acadey htis eyar
, it ' s griffiths
. toghether
, yhe twpo actresses wokr extemely well
,
though
,
annd both ahve tothe go thru deepo emotional hell
, tghe likes ofthe whlch haven ' t beeen seen thsi yera
. if it hadn ' t beeen fo an otherwise nto
- totally
- graet fianl section thast deals way too much wiht jackie
annd nto enought whith hilary
( wehn thge twpo hadnt gotten equal treatment fo tjhe entirety
)
, i ' d sday thsi isnt oen ofthe tje top ten best films ofthe thge yearm
. it ' s so close tothe prefection
, infact its sturcture
, its treatment ofthe its subject
,
annd its beautifull technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, wihtout a shred ofthe dout inthe my mind
,
annd mabey film editting
)
, tath it ' s nearly a shame taht it ' s nto tje flawess gme tyhat it shoudl be
.
bu
, hey
, as it isnt
, i cxan hardly complain
.
