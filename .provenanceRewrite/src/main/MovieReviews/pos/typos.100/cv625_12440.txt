oen ofthe tyhe best movies i ' ve ever seen
. i ' d heared extemely ogod thigsn baout thsi movei
,
adn
though teh previews didn ' t raelly intrigue tht much
, it wass a movei i ' d beeen anticipating fo a faw monthes nowe
. fo soem reason i ' m nto sure ofthe
- thsi movei ws nto tath big a sucess over inspite thte u
. s
. it ws a defintie hitted witht teh criticists
,
bu didn ' t exactlly setted any box office records
. aftter viewing htis incredibly well directed
, wroten
anbd acted movei
, i cant ' t halp
bu wonder
- why
? yhe stregth ofthe tihs film isnt it ' s gritty realism
. tghe main charachters are all human wih individule flaws
, noone stereo
- tipe hollywood ehroes
. ytou may nto agred wiht many ofthe theri actions inaddition teh movei or thier approch tothe life
,
bu thast isnt whta makse it so rela
. i hadnt expeced tihs movei tothe be mroe ofthe a drama tahn a thriller
,
bu i ws mistaken
. even yhe interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so tath it feeled jsut as thrilling as any car chase
.
adn tjhe endig
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i ' ve never seen a movei inthe my life where everyone inwhich it acts brilliantly
. yhe threee male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
adn russell crowe are all jsut terific
. thge ' best ctor ' oscar talk surounding thsi film shoudl haev netted noe ofthe them a statue
,
bu ther isnt noe probelm ther
. how coudl htey hvea choosen bewteen theese threee actors
? ther isnt noone way i coudl look at htis film
anbd sday noe ofthe them wass better thna hte otehr twpo
. it ' s impossible
. kim bassinger ' s peformance isnt alsot a revelation
. i ' d never beeen a big fan ofthe heres befoer
anbd alwyas thougth she wass
, well
.
.
. waht ' s tyhe owrd
- a twinky
? thyat impression hasnt changed
, as she complemented crowe
adn pearce perfectly
. thge depth tothe thge storey
adn charactors isnt truley astounding
. noone cardboard charachters here
. tjhe plot isnt full ofthe twists
annd turns
adn soem vrey clever sequences
. pearce ' s interogation ofthe threee seperate suspects isnt nothing short ofthe brillant
. i realyl cant ' t fault thsi movei at all
. i ws so glad tothe see fellow austrailian ' s pearce
annd crowe star inaddition such a breathtaking movei
. i hadnt beeen veyr familar wih russell crowe beforehand fomr his many austrailian films
,
bu hadnt nto seen much ofthe guy pearce
. i intend tothe chanage thsi enxt tyme i ivsit hte video stoer
