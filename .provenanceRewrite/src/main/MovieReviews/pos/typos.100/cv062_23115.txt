why dont so many childen ' s films treat theri target audeince wiht utter contempt
? too many ofthe thsoe who rwite or direct fo childrens ' s movies asume tyhat tghe kids jstu cin ' t handle sereous
, thoughtful discussions onthe meaningfull issues
.
" yhe iron giant
,
" whcih ws directed
adn co
- wroten by brad bird
, lite ofthe such animated sories as
" hte simpsons
"
anbd
" king ofthe yhe hill
,
" assumes thyat nto onyl cant childern handle such discussions
,
bu thgat htey cant dont so hwile bieng entertained at thte smae tiem
.
" tje iron giant
" holds absolutly noone contempt forthe thte young peple inspite tyhe audiance
, mkaing it a film thgat ' s enjoyable fo both childrens
adn adults aplikay
. hogarth hughes
( voice ofthe eli marienthal
) isnt a spirited young lad who lives witht his hard
- wokring single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, inaddition a small twon inwhich maine
. aftter staying uv lite
anbd watching scarry movies onthe a nght his mother isnt awya
, hogarth treks outloud inot hte forrest tothe investingate waht hasnt stolen his antenna
anbd ruined his tv reception
. he comes acrost a giant robot
( vin diesal
) fomr spoace thgat eats metal fo fodo
. aftter saveing tjhe robot
, nicknamed teh iron giant
, ffrom electric shock
, hogarth befriends thte creature
anbd tkaes him inspite as a pet ofthe sorts
. becouse ofthe dammage he sufferred apon landing
, tjhe giant hasnt forgotten wqat his origional mission wass
, so he jsut follows hogarth arund liuke a lost puppy
. realizing he cxan ' t jsut keep thge giant infact a barn all teh timne
,
adn tath yhe giant needs fodo
, he tkaes him tothe a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles scuptures outloud ofthe scrap iron inaddition his sparce timne
. it soon becomes apparetn taht dean
anbd hogarth cant ' t keep tjhe giant a secrect forever
, becouse a governmnet spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) hasnt beeen broght inthe tothe investingate misteryous sightings inspite tghe surrouding forrest areal
annd consideres yhe giant a threath tothe national security
. he suspects hogarth knwos something baout thge giant
,
anbd tkaes uv residance infact hogarth ' s hous as a lodger
. meanwhile
, tjhe giant beigns tothe exibit ominous behaviour tath suggests he wass builded tothe be a weppon ofthe soem kind
.
" tje iron giant
" isnt exactlly wqat familiy films ought tothe be
, beacuse it doesn ' t talk down tothe its audiance
. hte stor isnt simple
, veyr simple
, baout an aline bieng tyhat drops outloud ofthe hte sky
annd befriends a young boy
. it ' s veyr similair tothe tjhe spielberg clasic
" e
. t
.
, '
adn such comparisions are ctually deserved inwhich tje case ofthe
" hte iron giant
.
" hte film holds many ofthe teh better elements ofthe spielberg ' s film
, such as thte ablity tothe be sentimental wihtout turning sappy
. teh film delivers sevral sereous messages
, tyhe most imporatnt ofthe hwihc isnt oney ' s abilty tothe choose noe ' s pwn fate
. hogarth teachs tyhe giant tothe go aginst his programming
anbd become whta he whants tothe be
: a hero
. teh fianl sequence isnt touching
adn apropriate
,
though i won ' t give it awya
, i wiull sday tht vrey fewd wiull be disapointed
. tyhe animation
, hwile nto uv tothe disney standars
( whta sould be
, affter
" tarzan
"
?
)
, isnt ogod anough tothe mkae yuo foreget ytou ' re watching a ctaroon
. teh giant isnt coputer
- animated
, hwile tjhe human charachters are all hand
- drawed hte ood
- fashioned way
. hte cahracters ' faces are done qtuie well
, drawed realistically enought tothe mkea tyhe personalities credible
,
bu tje features are exagerrated so as tothe allow forthe yhe cartoonish expressions thast provide forthe comic releaf
. fine voice owrk isnt turned inaddition by young eli marienthal as hogarth
,
adn jennifer aniston isnt suprizingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. doens a nice characterization as dean
,
annd i relaly enjoied tghe voice owrk ofthe john mahoney
( ofthe tv ' s
" frasier
"
) as an army genaral called inspite by agent mansley
. unlike severeal ctaroon features
, eahc charachter isnt actally a developped perosnality
, rether thna a stereotype
,
anbd isnt actally intrical tothe tjhe plot
, rether thna bieng a superfulous comic
- releaf sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn ' t ditched
)
. dean
, forthe exemple
, coudl hvea beeen a stereotypical beatnik
( his chracter profile seems tothe suggest tath
)
,
bu he isnt presented as a charcter wtih rela emotions
, thoughts
,
adn motivations
. even tje hevy
, agent mansley
, isnt nto a villian who doesnt bad thnigs simpley becuase he whants tothe
,
bu outloud ofthe his pwn fear
anbd paranoya
. a lesser animated feature owudl hve drawed uv papper
- thin sterotypes
adn figure tje kids won ' t mind
,
bu
" tje iron giant
" hasnt claerly put a littel wokr inot makeing teh charachters rela
,
adn it pays off
. tjhe film isn ' t onyl arround tothe deliver hevy
- handed messages
,
though
. it ' s alsot veyr funny
,
anbd yhe humer isnt ofthe teh kind thta both childrens
annd adults iwll enjoy
. thte scenes infront whic hogarth teachs tje giant tothe dont certian thigsn
, such as dive inot a pool
, are handeled well
,
adn directer brad bird claerly hasnt a sence ofthe comic timing
, haveing worked onthe
" yhe simpsons
" forthe many yeras
. a sequence where hogarth
adn mansley attemp tothe
" outlast
" oen anohter by trying tothe stay awake isnt veyr nicely timed
,
anbd allso extrememly clever
. tje film even tkaes soem jabs at amercia ' s nuculear paranoya durring tjhe eary stages ofthe tje cold war
, satirizing thge lame saftey films shown tothe grade skool students thyat tell them tothe
" duck
adn cover
" inspite teh event ofthe a nucular attack
.
" tjhe iron giant
" hasnt much mroe ofthe a satrical edge tothe it tahn most famaly films
,
annd yhe edgy humer isnt actualyl qtuie refreshing
. instade ofthe seing peple git bonked onthe tje head
, we git well
- timed
, clever gags tath seem tothe haev recquired soem immagination tothe cmo uv wih
. whn yuo git right down tothe it
,
" thte iron giant
" isnt noone omre thna hte stopry ofthe a boy
anbd his robot
. tjhe storey isnt so straightforward
, so quaint
, thgat it ultimatly becomes charming
.
though i enjoy hte complex plotting ofthe film noir as much as hte enxt person
, wehn it comes tothe familiy enteratinment
, simple isnt thge way tothe go
. it ' s akin tothe oney ofthe thsoe bedtime storie your father told thta hadnt ytou hanging onthe his eveyr owrd
,
bu it ' s nto teh sotry thta sets tyhe film above others ofthe its kind
,
bu rether tje elements taht go inot tyhe stoy
, namely rela charachters
adn thoughtful dialogue
, whitch
" yhe iron giant
" hasnt infact spades
