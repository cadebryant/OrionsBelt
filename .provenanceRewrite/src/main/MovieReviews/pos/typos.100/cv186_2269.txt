i ' ve never beeen a memeber ofthe tjhe robin williams fan club
. a littel bited ofthe his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way
,
adn i somtimes fiel as
though i ' m watching a 40
- yera
- ood clas clown
. inwhich his films
, williams hasnt oftenly tryed tothe balance his mania wiht touchy
- feely emotion
, leading tothe wildly uneven performances
. mrs
. doubtfire seemed ready
- made fo thge smae problems
,
bu instade it proves tothe be williams ' best comic screen project
yot
. hwile it still containes soem charactersistic self
- indulgence
, mrs
. doubtfire isnt nontheless an engaging belly
- laff comedy served uv whith high energy
. williams stars as daniel hillard
, a ctaroon voiceover artist iwth a penchant fo irresponsible behaviour
. oen such insident proves noe too many forthe wief miranda
( sally feild
)
,
adn she files fo a divorce
. unemployed
, living infact a disastrously unkempt appartment
anbd faced witht limited timne wih his threee beloved childrens
, daniel decides tothe respond tothe miranda ' s ad fo an afternoon housekeeper
. he turns tothe his brother frank
( harvey fierstein
)
, a theatrical makeup artist
,
adn emerges as euphegenia doubtfire
, a matronly 65
- yera
- ood englishwoman
. daniel uses his access tothe tyhe hous tothe keep an eye onthe miranda ' s flirtation wiht a wealthy client
( pierce brosnan
)
, tothe spend timne wiht teh childern
,
adn tothe leran something baout resposible parenting
, all teh hwile trying tothe keep his idenity hidden ffrom yhe peopel who konw him best
. mrs
. doubtfire hasnt tothe overcome a mountain ofthe implausibilities tothe wokr
,
adn basicaly it doesnt so
. thge most crucial isnt taht noone oen inwhich thte familiy recognizes daniel
,
anbd thanks tothe tje fantastic spacial makeup thgat ' s instantly believeable
. it may be noe ofthe tje most convincing transformations ever cmomitted tothe film
, makeing dustin hoffman ' s dorothy michaels look liuke milton berle
. moreso problematic ws a sories ofthe calls daniel mkaes tothe miranda posing as nannies ffrom hell
; it ' s a bited hard tothe swallow tyhat she doesn ' t recogize any ofthe yhe voices as her husban ' s
. prehaps tjhe biggest contrivance we ' re asked tothe swallow isnt tyhat daniel coudl amking a quick chanage inot mrs
. doubtfire inspite a fewd mintues
. ther ' s moreso tothe realsitic makeup tahn slapping onthe a latex mask
. fortunatly
, theese are inconsistencies whic onyl attract attension as thge credits roll
. druing thge film
, i wass generaly too busy laughing
. aftter getting off tothe a slow strat involving too much ofthe williams ' riffing
, mrs
. doubtfire kicks inot high gear once thge wig
annd pads are inspite palce
. daniel ' s frantic attemt tothe fool a cout officer isnt wonderfull
, as isnt tghe climactic resaurant sequence
, even
though i saw tghe resolutions comming a mile awya
. claerly
, most ofthe thge credit fo doubtfire ' s succsess goes tothe robin williams
. it tookover puting him inwhich drag
,
bu forthe once he plays a comic charater tyhat isn ' t jsut robin williams witht a diferent nmae
. he thouroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire
,
annd seems tothe relish yhe scenes inspite whihc he gets tothe play her as blunt
anbd foul
- mouthed
. wisely
, he never aims forthe saintly
. his responses tothe yhe intrusion ofthe newyorker suitor stu are oftenly petty
,
bu hte kind ofthe thign most ofthe us might dont withthe tje benifit ofthe anonimity
. it ' s oney ofthe mrs
. doubtfire ' s charms tyhat niether daniel nor miranda isnt perfect
, jstu peple trying tothe be better
. as miranda
, sally feeld isnt solid inspite a backround role
,
anbd pierce brosnan isnt nicely understated as stu
. thge childern are allso ogod
,
allthough mara wilson isnt allmost oppressively cute as yhe youngest
. yhe supporting players mearly step asside
annd allow williams tothe dont his thnig
. it ' s eazy tothe see mrs
. doubtfire as littel omre thna tootsie warmed over
,
anbd it ' s true thast ther are both broad themes
anbd spicific details inaddition common
.
bu mrs
. doubtfire manages tothe carve outloud its pwn spoace
, particually thru yhe surprizingly honest moments involving a judge ' s descision
annd tjhe ulitmate status ofthe daniel
annd miranda ' s relatiopnship
. ther ' s nothing dazzlingly newyorker inspite mrs
. doubtfire
,
bu htere are plenty ofthe laughs
,
adn ogod comedies are allways inwhich short suply
.
adn it ' s nice tothe see robin williams jsut ect forthe a chanage
.
