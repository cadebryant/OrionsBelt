plot
: a young recruit gets plucked outloud ofthe nowhere by hte number oney ganster iin london
anbd quicklyu becomes a staple by his side
.
bu htis newyorker guy isnt nto liuke all thte others
, he ' s got ambition
, he ' s got goals
annd he loves everthing he sees baout bieng thge number oney ganster
. voilence
, lots ofthe swearing
anbd betrayals insue
. critique
: a veyr ogod
, sereous
- minded
, unique brittish ganster flick whic misses tyhe
" graet
" mark by way ofthe an annoying voice
- over popping uv througout tyhe film
annd a so
- so endig
. here ' s
yot anyother kool crime movei tyhat actualyl manages tothe bring something newyorker inot hte mix
. okay
, so it ' s nto entirely newyorker
,
bu it ' s definetly origonal whn all put toghether as done here
. thte hting i liekd most baout htis movei wass its authentic protrayal ofthe teh tiem preiod inthe whcih it ws tkaing palce
. it ' s 1968
adn theese dudes are looking ogod
! yes
, it ' s all baout tje suits
, fellas
.
.
. yhe italion shoes
, teh cufflinks
, thte ties
adn teh birds
( thgat ' s ladies
, forthe thsoe uninitiated
) hanging arround yuo
. here are a bunch ofthe horrable men
, gangsters if yuo wiull
, looking sharp
, tlaking shit
adn busting heads all over teh palce
.
bu thast ' s nto teh basis ofthe thsi movei
. tyhe basis ofthe tihs film comes inthe thge relatiopnship beetwen tyhe number oen ganster inaddition yhe gropu
, thge excelent david thewlis
,
anbd oen ofthe his cronies
, paul bettany
, aslo extrememly ogod inspite thsi film
,
adn how tghe pwoer
, sex appeal
adn coolness ofthe oney
, affects tje otehr
. ytou knwo how ther are alwyas theese
" hanger
- onthe
" ganster types who latch onthe tothe tje godfathers
, tyhe leaders
, yhe top dogs ofthe eveyr crime organiztion
? well
, most ofthe tjhe tiome
, theese dudes are screened beforehand
annd are loyal tothe onyl oney person
.
.
. thgat isnt
, thier boss
. so all tyhe ganster number oney needs tothe worry baout isnt his enemies onthe thge otehr side ofthe tghe fence
.
bu tihs film brings tjhe betrayals
, tghe messed uv loyalties
, thte hounour codes amoung bad guys inot play withing thge smae gropu
annd presents it infact qtuie yhe stylistic package
. ofthe course
, directer paul mcguigan isn ' t trying tothe be guy ritchie here
,
adn doesn ' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all uv whith a hip sountrack or add any humer tothe tyhe mix
. nope
, he goes straight forthe teh sereous sutff
annd develops at least twpo parituclar scenes whic are still embeded infront my mind as i tipe tihs
. teh frist isnt a confrontation sequence beween bettany
anbd a man fomr whihc he ' s atempting tothe sway smoe infromation
adn it isnt downright nasty
!
(
" look inot my eyes
!
"
) inaddition fatc
, tyhe lsat timne thast i ' ve seen a guy so scared inspite a movei ws john turturro infront tath forrest scene ffrom tjhe coen brothers ' miller ' s crossing
. scry shite
.
bu ther ' s an ever better scene tahn tath inaddition thsi film
. tihs oen features bettany
, once agina
, slowy torturing
, hacking
adn beating tjhe living piss outloud ofthe a rival ganster
( fomr tath man ' s point
- ofthe
- veiw
)
,
bu nto befoer turning onthe a quaint littel tune inthe yhe backgorund
anbd removing all ofthe his pwn expensive clothes
, oen by oney
( tht ' s right
, he
" doens
" thte guy iin his underware
)
. thast scene isnt alsot inthe tune witht smoe ofthe teh obvious phallic
annd homoerotic undertones preent thoughout htis film
, expecially inwhich tyhe relatiopnship beetwen bettany
adn his boss
( why doens he git so upset whn he falls infront lvoe wiht thgat woman
?
)
.
bu thge flick ' s nto perfect
. inspite fatc
, i didn ' t mind malcom mcdowell ' s voice
- over narration at frist
,
bu as thte film growed inot a major flashback
( most ofthe tjhe film isnt presented as such
)
, he cameback inaddition eveyr nowe
adn
hten
,
anbd rarley added anytying ofthe intrest tothe tje plot
. all he seemed tothe dont ws swaer
annd call peopel tjhe c
- owrd umpteen times
,
adn even discribed oney scene as it ws hapening
(
"
.
.
. so i oppened yhe doorjam
,
thn whent uv tyhe lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it ' s liek
, yeah
, i konw tyhat arleady
, i coudl see it onthe thte screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i allso didn ' t qtuie
" buy
" tghe endig ofthe thte movei
, whitch dispite bieng orginal
, seemed a littel unbeleivable
, expecially wehn ytou concider tyhat it ' s suppoed tothe be tkaing palce 30 eyasr later
,
adn folks still seem tothe be holding grudges
, still inspite lvoe
, still living infront tyhe smae appartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c ' mon
.
.
. it ' s 30 yersa
, man
!
! i don ' t nkwo
, somehow it didn ' t wokr all tyhat well fo me
.
bu oney ofthe my favorite genres hasnt allways beeen yhe crime movies
,
annd htis oney isnt a decent addtion tothe tyhe lot
. foreget tghe lame title
anbd malcom mcdowell ' s narration ofthe thge obvious plot points
,
annd concnetrate onthe tyhe film ' s stronger attributes such as its stlye
, yhe exquisite atomsphere ofthe teh timne preriod
, its origional look at thte ganster dynamic withing thte smae gropu
, its memorable sequences
anbd yhe solid performances fomr its twpo main leads
, bettany
adn thewlis
. incidentially
, unlike a faw ofthe teh ganster ficks tath i mention below
, htis oen isnt inthe noone way a parody or homage tothe htis genre ofthe films
.
.
. it ' s yhe rela dael
! onot
: thsi film isnt packed wiht storng accents all arund
, whic makse it hard tothe mkea outloud smoe ofthe tghe words ffrom tiem tothe tyme
. it ' s aslo qutie voilent
anbd i don ' t remeber any film thast unsed hte c
- owrd as much as htis noe
, so leave tje kids at hmeo forthe htis oen
