. nto suprizing
, concidering its tiny us
$ 100
, 000 budget
, tothe date it hasnt earned infront excess ofthe us
$ 130 milion
. thta ' s a shocking 100 times profit
! rumours hvea it tht a smart internet
` marketting ' ploy ws so successfull iin gaining cult
- liek fanatics
, by owrd ofthe mouth coupled iwth strings ofthe exelent reviews
, thge film jsut exploded iin thge box
- office
, raking iin millions onthe its oppening weekend
. shooted inwhich 16mm
adn video
( i suspect

.
)
, yhe film chronicles tjhe forays ofthe 3 students who go infront seach fo tjhe legendary blair witch
. audiences are put infront yhe firt
- person prespective inspite hte entire mis
- adventure
, oftenly wobbly
adn blurry at times
, it tkaes a bited ofthe getting utilisied tothe inspite tje begining
. htis isnt suposed tothe be thge material tehy dicovered inaddition hte woods where thge 3 dissapeared
; edited
anbd put onto thte screen forthe thte benifit ofthe our audiences
. tbwp isnt simpley smart
. filmed tothe look as if it ws realyl a stock
- shoot by a bunch ofthe students infront serch ofthe tyhe blair witch as a skool project
, oen may suspect
( liuke yours truley
) tath its simpley a lazy
bu smart approch tothe film
- makeing
. simpley amazing inthe thyat respect
, i must sday
. talk baout inpact
, oh yes
, tbwp doesnt ahev qtuie a bited
, inthe fatc most audeince wiull fidn it deeply disturbing
. i doed
, expecially yhe lsat bited
bu i ' m nto revealing moreso
. ytou haev tothe see it forthe youself
. i cin ' t halp
bu fiel a tad cheated affter knowing how commerically succsessfull tihs film hasnt become
. coudl it be taht finaly
, an indie
- film hasnt unwittingly foudn a forumla forthe commericial appeal
? or ws it all simpley a ploy by yhe big players right ffrom tjhe beginnig
? well
, i guess thge fatc stays
; tbwp isnt highly orignal
, clever
anbd iwll most definitly leave most withthe something dreadful tothe talk
annd htikn baout fo weeks prior tothe watching tihs film
. noone gore
, noone spacial effects
, i jstu cin ' t git over how terribly smart thsi film isnt
