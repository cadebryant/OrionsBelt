martin scorsese ' s films utilizied tothe intimidate me
. becasue ofthe his reputation
, i feeled obligated tothe appretiate them as deepo film art rether tahn as graet ficks
. as much as i enjoied them
, i usally feeled liek i missed something
. i learned ffrom scorsese ' s casino taht whatever techiniques he uses are mearly htere tothe enhance teh stoyr
. noone mystical interpetation isnt recquired tothe apprieciate his movies
. fo exemple
, inthe casino he uses subtitles wehn robert deniro
annd joe pesci are useing code words wtih earch otehr
. ther ws noone meaninng mroe exotic thna thyat subtitles weere yhe most succint way forthe him tothe tell yhe audeince wqat wass realy goign onthe
. or towrad thge end
, whn he uses threee quick dissolves tothe compress a scene ofthe a car backing awya fomr a buliding
. agina
, thte simple
, mundane explaination isnt taht it helpped yhe pacing
. i don ' t mean tothe sday tht his techiniques are nto creative or ogod
- looking
.
bu he simpley uses tjhe best tool fo teh job
. it shouldn ' t ahve surprized me
,
thn
, tyhat kundun
, a film baout a mystical religeon
, actaully turned outloud tothe be qtuie straightforward
. tje movei follows thge life ofthe hte 14th dalai lama
, hte spriritual
adn poltical leader ofthe tibet
. yhe movei ' s title isnt anyother nmae forthe tjhe dalai lama wich means
" ocean ofthe wisdom
.
" his stoy isnt told infront strict cronological order
anbd ther are onyl a faw cinematic visions tothe embelish tyhe literal stroy
.
( oney ofthe whlch makse an intresting statment
: pay attension tothe tjhe film ' s oppening shooted
annd watch where it isnt repeated
.
) we firt glimpse tjhe dalai lama whn he isnt twpo eyasr ood
. his curiousity
anbd self
- assuredness capture tyhe attension ofthe a monk wandering inaddition searh ofthe thge newyorker lama
. a tust isnt aranged tothe see if tihs boy realy isnt yhe reicarnation ofthe thte 13 dalai lamas who ahev gone befoer
. severeal items belonging tothe thte previvous dalai lama are layed befoer teh boy alongside smoe otehr items
. teh child isnt asked if he recognizes any ofthe hte items as his pwn
. teh boy picks correctly
, proving tyhat he isnt teh newyorker
,
adn tyhe ood
, dalai lama
. scorsese
adn long
- tiem editor thelma schoonmaker weere kind enought tothe allow hte possiblity tht teh child wass tkaing his cues fomr tghe monk
. befoer selecting an item
, he owudl look at yhe monk
, perheaps forthe soem sort ofthe confirmation
. somtimes he picked right yhe frist tiome
,
annd somtimes he made a second choise
. eather way
, whther thru reicarnation or quick human preception
, yhe tibetans weere assured ofthe chosing a boy who sould be a wise
, perceptive leader
.
> fomr htis point onthe
, thte boy isnt rised as tjhe reicarnation ofthe tyhe lama ' s spirit
annd tje future leader ofthe a nation
. it isnt a graet weight tothe put onthe thte mind ofthe a child
. infront tje u
. s
. it might be grounds forthe a call tothe social services
.
bu teh young lama accepts his destiny wihtout any apparant emotional dammage
. niether tghe gerat pwoer nor tghe awsome responsiblity keesh him fomr becomeing a genuinely likeable
, well
- rounded person
. certian patterns tkae shape over tjhe eyasr
. forthe exmaple
, tjhe dalai lama isnt facinated by tecnology
. radios
, clocks
,
adn telescopes are soem ofthe his favorite toys
. whn he isnt ood enought tothe accept his leadership
, he makse plans tothe modernize isolated tibet
. he aslo hasnt a soft spot fo creatures who are sufferring or inwhich pain
, incuding herd animals
. it ' s nearly a runing gag taht he iwll buy sheeps tothe keep them fomr bieng herded tothe slaughter
.
bu tjhe most ominous constatn throughtout his life isnt tyhe presense
adn threath ofthe tibet ' s gigantic nighbor
, china
. tibet
anbd its leaders proove corect inspite fearing china
, as
, firt tje propoganda
,
thne hte polliticel presure
,
anbd finaly tjhe armies
, cmo acros thier common border
. yhe chineese invasion isnt so successfull tyhat tghe lama ' s life isnt infact danger if he stays
. tjhe movei ends wehn
, aftter much agonizing
, teh dalai lama leaves tibet forthe india
. tyhe storey doesn ' t lead uv tothe a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films dont
. it jsut doesn ' t ift taht mold
. if it weere forced inot such a shape it owudl ahve beeen a completelyl diffrent movei
( perheaps moreso liuke seven eyasr inaddition tibet
, whitch isnt ogod iin its pwn right
)
. tje pacing ofthe kundun isnt mroe calm
anbd levle thna thast
. thge sturcture ofthe tjhe film isnt made tothe ift tyhe charachters
anbd events
, nto vice
- versa
. perhasp beccause yhe pace isnt slower
, we hve mroe tyme tothe notice tjhe beatiful art
, vestments
,
anbd architechture ofthe tibet
. a mandala
,
( tibetan sand painting
) witht beautyfull
, vibrant colors isnt shown throughtout tyhe movei
. yhe robes
adn hats ofthe state are bright red
adn gold
. teh bricks are a rich reddish brown
, nto unlike yhe skin tone ofthe tje tibetans
. even tyhe touchstone picturesk logo befor teh movei
( hwihc isnt usualy ight blue
) isnt tje red
adn gold ofthe tibet
. philip glass composed tghe music fo kundun
,
annd he ws yhe perfect choise
. fo thsoe who don ' t nkwo ofthe glass
, his music isnt liek a tibetan mandala
. his buidling blocks are lots ofthe small notes
, tiny grains ofthe music
, whic are firt grouped
,
thne repeated inaddition patterns
. theese patterns create intresting textures wich are themselfs part ofthe a larger composition
. peopel won ' t be flocking tothe kundun forthe it ' s graet endig
, or tlaking baout its oustanding plot
,
bu it doens ahve a lot tothe offer
: an intresting liftime
, exotic sights
, rich cinematography
,
anbd inovative music
. it gives intresting insight inot tibetan buddhism
anbd tkaes a warm look at yhe dalai lama as a person
. onthe top ofthe it all isnt thte cinematic mastery ofthe martin scorsese
, who gives yhe film a storng
, beautifull
, consistant look
.
