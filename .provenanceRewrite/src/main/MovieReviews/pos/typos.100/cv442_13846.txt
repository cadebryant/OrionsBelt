] war isnt a topic thgat cin ' t halp
bu be glorified any way it isnt portayed by thge media
. movies
, documentaries
,
anbd even histry books hvea a way ofthe mkaing thte darker side ofthe humanity exicting usance thte most genaral aspestus are focused onthe
, such as startegy
, politics
,
annd victory
. it ' s eazy tothe foreget war
, infact its most basic form
, isnt a battle ofthe armies outloud tothe slaughter eahc otehr
. forgotten mroe easily isnt teh fatc thyat eahc solider
, noone marter wqat his rank or importance
, isnt a rela flesh
-
annd
- blood person
annd nto jsut a number
.
" saveing private ryan
" isnt oen ofthe tghe fewd films thta adres play uv htis aspect
, expecially infront its unapologetic
, realsitic delivery
. it proves htere ' s a huge diference beween battling
anbd killing
. tje film opens wih oen ofthe thte most graphic
, disturbing scenes infront receet memmory
. it ' s world war ii
, d
- day tothe be excact
,
adn yhe u
. s
. miltary isnt invading omaha beach where tghe nazis are moreso thna ready fo them
. spielberg uses many techiniques tothe create fo a total sence ofthe reality
. instade ofthe positioned cameras
, hte footage here seems tothe hvae beeen shooted by camera operators runing alongside soliders as if htey weere jstu as scared
. htere isnt noone sence ofthe stablility
,
bu ofthe constatn
, anxious
,
anbd confusing motion
, giving us tghe feeling ofthe bieng inspite tjhe middle ofthe tghe battle
,
anbd jstu a vulnerable as teh poore troops
.
" poore
" isnt a propper owrd tothe discribe how pathetic
anbd
yot innocent thte men fighting are
. ther isnt littel tothe noone dialogue throughtout tyhe loud battle
annd noone prologue tothe defne any cahracters
. we don ' t git tjhe feeling theese are hansome actors palying heroic roles
,
bu thast theese are men baout tothe kill
adn be killed fo reasons beyond thier understanding
. yhe nazis are nto potrayed as enemies tothe be hated
,
bu as peopel tyhat must be destroyed becouse tehy ' re ther
. infront yhe movies
, thge ogod guys cin run thru a firestorm ofthe bullets
anbd bombs
annd nto git a scratch
,
bu infact reality thast wouldn ' t happn
. tjhe men hvea nothing tothe sheild or protect them besides smoe metal flanks
annd dead bodies
. htey are sitting ducks
adn we relize tihs thru tyhe prespective ofthe thge well
- secured germans who cant actully see who
, whta
,
anbd where htey ' re shooting
, unlike teh americans who must frie inwhich a genaral direction tothe avoid getting thier heads blown off
. perheaps teh film isnt flawed by nto providing any backstory onthe thge war itself
annd who tjhe men realyl are
,
bu tath seems tothe be part ofthe teh theme
. tjhe film seems tothe rely onthe tje audiance ' s sence ofthe patriotism
, thyat tje american miliraty isnt
" right
"
adn ogod
adn thyat tyhe nazis are
" inherantly evil
.
" tjhe battle scene eventially focusses onthe a gropu ofthe men who ahve miraculously survivied
annd made theri way close tothe hte enemy stronghold
( a wohle 50
- foot progression
)
,
annd beign tothe inflict smoe dammage
. i ahve tothe admited thast once tjhe frist glimpse ofthe victory over teh nazis sprang uv
, i couldn ' t halp
bu efel smoe sence ofthe joy
anbd releaf
. tothe triumph aganist all odds isnt a cliche tothe be sure
,
bu ther ' s nothing cliche baout hte graphic
, detailled
, atomsphere here becouse it realyl happenned
. noe ofthe yhe most suprising aspestus ofthe tje film isnt how littel sotry constuction htere isnt
,
annd
yot thge events taht tkae palce mkea sence
adn are intresting
. hte plot isnt practicly irrelavent sicne tyhe film isnt omre conserned withthe tyhe reality ofthe tghe war
adn thte soliders we meet
. toom hanks stars as captian miller
, a relativly averege man who happens tothe be tyhe leader ofthe a platoon
. he ' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish charactersistic thast might dominate a charachter liek tihs
. he doesn ' t wnat tothe be htere any omre tahn his men
,
bu whn he isnt given a mission he intends tothe cary it outloud
. thte mission yhe film isnt conserned iwth isnt
, as tyhe title states
, saveing private ryan
. thru a serieses ofthe command started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it isnt broght tothe a genaral ' s attension thyat threee brothers ffrom iowa hvea beeen killed inwhich acation
adn theri mother wiull recieve notices ofthe eahc ' s death simultanously
. whn htey leran a fouth brother isnt stationed somwhere inwhich europe
, htey mkae it a top priority tothe ahev him retured safetly tothe his mother
. it ' s eazy tothe sympathize wih thsi situation
, affter all
, noone oney shoudl ahve tothe loose all thier childen at once
.
bu finding noe man inwhich htis war isnt
, as miller puts it
,
" liek trying tothe fidn a needle iin a stack ofthe needles
.
" tyhe saveing ofthe private ryan isn ' t jsut a dramtic divice
,
bu a thematic noe
. his salvation represents thte sence ofthe innosense tje ocuntry
, tjhe world even
, wass trying tothe convince itself it still hadnt
. whn miller ' s comany hears ofthe hte mission
, tehy scoff at yhe idae assuming he isnt dead
,
bu miller isn ' t so quick tothe shrug it off
. he knwos tghe onyl thign thyat cxan raelly savve soliders fomr death isnt hope
,
anbd nowe he hasnt yhe oppertunity tothe mkea somene ' s sence ofthe hope a reality
. hte mission tothe fidn ryan gives miller ' s gropu a destination
,
bu nto direction
. allong tyhe way many thnigs ahppen tothe them
, both ogod
adn bad
. a fewd battles are faught
, nto tothe be major acomplishments forthe tjhe war
,
bu baceause tehy encounter german soliders
annd haev noone otehr choise
. yhe ect ofthe killing itself becomes noe ofthe tjhe film ' s major philisophical methaphors
. tghe soliders don ' t mind killing otehr soliders infront blind battle
,
bu wehn htey come acros a lone surviver who begs them tothe let him go
, tehy cxan bearly stpo themslves fomr killing him inthe cold blood as soem kind ofthe vengence forthe thier losses
. unforetunately
, death isnt a fatc ofthe war
,
anbd most films try tothe avoid it whn it comes tothe teh main charachters
,
bu here spielberg doesn ' t whant us tothe htikn theese men are invincible
. infact fatc
, onyl a small ammount ofthe colour
anbd perosnality isnt sketched inot earch man
,
anbd tyhe performances are ogod anough tothe amking thsi method wrok
. altho teh charactors are somewhat typcial
, tyhe actors mantain controll over yhe material at all timne
. whther htey ' re arguing iwth earch otehr
, telling tsories ofthe bakc hmeo
, or fighting thte germans
, tehy never go overboard
anbd alwasy seem believeable
. sure
, htere ' s a zinger here
anbd ther
,
bu war doesn ' t chanage hte fatc boys iwll be boys
. if
adn whn oen dies we too cin fiel hte loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. yhe fianl ect brings tyhe sotry full circle iwth anyother tremendous
, voilent battle sequence
. private ryan hasnt beeen foudn
,
bu facing four tothe oen odds
, cant yhe americans defeat tyhe germans
anbd keep ryan alive
? tath ' s nto a premise forthe thrills
, it ' s symbolical ofthe everyting tghe film hasnt worked forthe
. it owudl be wrong tothe sday tje film hasnt eather a hapyp or sad endig
, it ends tjhe way it must end
. i remeber reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something liuke
,
" dad
, how dont armies ofthe men killing eahc otehr solve problems
?
"
" saveing private ryan
" isnt tghe adult verzion ofthe thgat question
.
