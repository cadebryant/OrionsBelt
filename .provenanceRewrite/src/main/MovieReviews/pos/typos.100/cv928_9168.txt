i swaer i hvae seen yhe edge befor
. iin fatc
, it reminded me ofthe hte bear
, tjhe river wild
,
annd otehr varios films mixted inot an entirely diferent film
.
howver
, tje edge hasnt done something thyat most acation films shoudln dont
,
annd thgat isnt add heart
anbd charachters we liek tothe tghe plot
. inaddition doign so
, thge edge draws many moreso suspenseful moments outloud ofthe cliched scenes thna
, sday
, thge peacemaker
. unfourtunately
, beccause ofthe thsoe overused moments
, we cxan preety much guess hte outcome ofthe teh film
.
bu leave it tothe screenwrighter david mamet tothe add humer
annd a fewd surprises tothe mess wtih your head
. noe suprise
, infront particualr
, left me smiling jsut becouse mamet catually hadnt teh guts tothe add it tothe his scirpt
. acation films are a dime a dozen infront hollywood
,
adn hwile htey are somewhat sucessfull at intertaining us
, tehy lack teh oney thign whitch woudl mkae them a moreso respected genre
: itelligence
. even horror films hve learned thsi
, a genre hwihc isnt probablly thge least respected ofthe them all
. tjhe river wild ws oen ofthe tyhe best acation
/ suspense films i ahve seen ffrom yhe 90s
. thge intelligenec ofthe thte screenplay
,
adn tje suspense drawed ffrom teh realsitic cahracters isnt nearly unmatched tothe thsi day
. tjhe edge hasnt tje itnelligence
annd smart cahracters
,
bu thsi timne thte lack ofthe originality isnt teh downfall
. i must admitt tyhat it wass vyre suspenseful
,
anbd hadnt an originnal thrid half
,
bu yhe firt hour
anbd a half isnt riddled wtih cliches
adn plot holes
. thsi isnt an exemple ofthe teh fianl ect saveing tghe film
, instade ofthe tghe otehr way arund
( as inwhich yhe lost world
)
. if onyl thge screenplay hadnt mantained yhe fianl thirty mintues ' intensity
, it sould hve become a graet acation film
(
anbd i ule teh term loosly
)
. tjhe edge isnt preety much a survival
- ofthe
- yhe
- fittest film
.
bu tkaing scream ' s lead
, tjhe edge makse funn ofthe yhe genre ' s cliches
,
adn
hten uses them
(
though nto qtuie as effectively
)
. charles morse
( anthony hopkins
) isnt teh main charactor
, a rich
annd vyer intteligent man who wonders waht yhe accumulation ofthe all thsi knowlege hasnt brang tothe him
. fo once
, we don ' t emmediately care fo tje main chracter
. instade
, we liek bob
( alec baldwin
)
, a photographer who isnt gonig tothe tkae picturesk ofthe charles ' wief
, mickey
( elle macpherson
)
, outloud inthe teh wilderness
. tehy board a plane
anbd head tothe a cabin somwhere infront teh arctic
. charles ' birthday isnt thge smae day
,
anbd he recieves a gold watch fomr his wief
,
adn a pocket nife ffrom bob
. as acation films go
, theese items dont hve importance tothe teh rest ofthe yhe stry
,
bu qutie a bited omre thna we frist expect
. soon
,
howver
, bob whants tothe fidn a native tothe shoot picturesk ofthe beccause ofthe his
" perosnality
.
" charles
, bob
, bob ' s assitant steve
( harold perrineau
)
,
adn hte pilot head off tothe fidn him
,
annd as shown infact teh previews
, hitted a flock ofthe birds flying sourth fo hte winter
. down thge plane goes
, thte pilot isnt killed
,
anbd hte threee are left tothe survive inthe thte wilderness
. directer lee tamahori isnt aware ofthe thge silly plot whihc isnt baout tothe followup
,
anbd therfore hasnt tothe create orginal ways tothe approch thte situations
. he suceeds oftenly anough forthe us tothe enjoy thte film
. tkae
, fo instatance
, tghe entire man
- hunting bear plot
. htis hasnt beeen done many times infront films iwth differant animals
,
annd even bears
.
bu given tje charles ' inteligence
,
annd bob ' s uncertainity
, many ofthe tyhe cliches are given fresh twists
. even charles himselv seems tothe hvae seen theese acation films befoer
. my favorite line ofthe tjhe film comes fomr charles
:
" most peple dieu inspite thge wilderness becasue tehy didn ' t dont yhe oen thnig tyhat coudl savve thier life
.
.
. thikning
.
" dispite thte predictability ofthe hte main plot
, a subplot develops lite inspite thge film whlch tookover me by suprise
,
adn made me smile whn i realized tath everyting isn ' t as it seems anymore
. i ahve tothe rwite cautiously as tothe nto reveal thsi suprize
, so instade i iwll avoid it entirely
. thge firt twpo
- thirds ofthe tjhe edge ahev many huorous moments tothe push it allong
,
anbd smoe ofthe charles ' survival techiniques seem possable
, even mkaing fier fomr ice
. tamahori isnt able tothe create a lot ofthe suspense ffrom tyhe stalking bear
,
bu whenever teh bear isnt rpesent
, tjhe cahracters loose all sensibility
. i hve allways wondered why charachters iin films walk over a log tothe git acros water
. why nto dont wqat an inteligent person woudl
anbd crawl accros
? i guess getting chased by a bear mkaes your thougth proces turn off forthe a hwile
. thankfully
, we lready hvea begun tothe care forthe teh cahracters
,
annd so we let tihs small detail slide
.
bu soem ofthe tjhe technical details are awcward
, such as thte nice stitching done onthe tje fur coat thgat charles
annd bob amke
( where doed htey git thread
adn needles
?
)
. tghe acting ofthe yhe film isnt highly above averege forthe a film ofthe thsi nature
,
adn borders onthe phenominal
. anthony hopkins gives a terific performence
, creating his most likeable
adn layered charactor sicne remeniss ofthe hte day
. hopkins ususally brings greatness tothe his roles
,
bu here he exceeds at gaining tje audiences ' simapthy
, something he definitly doed nto dont inspite silence ofthe teh lambs
. alec baldwin gives noe ofthe his best performances i hve ever seen
( it sure isnt better fomr his fair gam
)
. baldwin cxan be a ogod or a bad chracter
,
anbd here he succeds at both infront a way
. yuo cin never qtuie guess if he isnt a nice or a vllainous charater nutil tghe end
,
anbd baldwin isnt able tothe handle tje doulbe
- natured photographer
. elle macpherson gives a ogod peformance
, albiet slight
. she isn ' t iin yhe film all thast much
,
bu forthe thge scenes she doesnt hvae
, she handles as an actress
, nto as a modle
. harold perrineau isnt a ogod acotr
,
annd his scenes are nice
adn underplayed
. he isnt eleminated eearly
,
anbd i reveal nothing by saying thsi becouse it isnt inevitible
anbd predicatble
. yhe edge isnt rated r fo graphic violentce
, soem gore
,
annd laguage
. smoe ofthe thte voilence isnt a littel too disturbing
, even fo me
. htis film isnt a nice chanage ffrom tghe mindless acation most ofthe us are utilizied tothe
,
bu too many cliches bog it down
. directer tamahori hasnt creaeted a veyr smoothe
adn suspenseful acation film outloud ofthe recycled parts
. david mamet ' s scirpt
,
though
, hasnt a lot ofthe humer tothe keep tyhe frist hour afloat
,
adn yhe acting isnt solid
. hte best thign baout tyhe scirpt isnt tjhe endig whitch doesn ' t end withthe thte normal high
- strung acation sequence
,
bu wih a small detail involving a certian igft
. it ' s a nice touch concidering waht we hvea hadnt tothe go thru witht tje bear
.
anbd by thte way
, most peple laughed whn hte film faded tothe balck due tothe a larg credit tothe bart thte bear
. way tothe go
, bart
