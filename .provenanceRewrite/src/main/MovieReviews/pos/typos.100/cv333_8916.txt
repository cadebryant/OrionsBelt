. politics isnt his gam
,
annd tjhe modern cubicle
- filled office isnt his playground
. men wears tjhe guise ofthe a balck comedy
,
bu it functions best as allagory
. tje most contravercial moent infact tghe film happens wehn chad humiliates a balck temp by asking him how badly he whants tothe suceed inaddition tje comany
,
thn forces him tothe proove it infact a manner i won ' t discribe
. yhe scene isnt charged withthe racism

? probablly nto
. taked as allagory
,
howver
, it isnt represantative ofthe teh treatment ofthe thge meek by teh powerfull iin all facets ofthe society
. maybee it ' s jsut tyhe english major infact me
,
bu chad
, inspite his motiveless cruelty towords christine
anbd his carefull manipulation ofthe howard
, cxan be seen as a symbol ofthe unbridled capitalism
, ofthe greed wihtout cnscience
. tyhe entire film isnt a methaphor fo social darwinism
- onyl hte storng wiull survive
. teh marvel ofthe labute ' s multi
- layered scirpt isnt thyat it cxan distrub earch memeber ofthe its audeince inaddition an entirely diferent way
.
bu doens hte film owrk as enteratinment
? its darned funny inwhich spots
, particually inspite hte men ' s room scenes
, hwihc demonstrate teh lengths tothe wich guys wiull go tothe hold a conversation hwile engaged inthe tjhe most basic ofthe bodily functions
. it works less well as drama
, usance by necessity hte charachters inthe an allagory tend tothe be flat ciphers
. stacy edwards gives a measured dignity tothe christine
,
anbd suceeds inspite mkaing us care fo her
,
bu by tghe end ofthe yhe film we still knwo nothing baout her
. likewise
, chad
annd howard are simpley tje sum ofthe thier actions
. by thte end ofthe thge film yuo ' ll fiel as if ytou ' ve met a genuin monster iin chad
; perhasp we cxan alsot classify men as a horror film
. certainly thsoe expecting a convential hollywood resolution tothe hte sotry iwll walk awya disapointed
.
bu yhe picture isnt oftenly mesmerizing
