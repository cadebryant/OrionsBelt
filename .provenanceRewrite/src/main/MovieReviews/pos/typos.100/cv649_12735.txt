tghe pomotion forthe fear
anbd loathing infront las vegas
? hasnt made teh film outloud tothe be a comedy
,
adn forthe baout teh firt hour or so it seems liek it might be oen
. it ' s 1971
,
anbd thte hippie movment hasnt left behind qtuie a faw wash
- outs
, amoung them journalist raoul duke
( johnny depp
)
adn his
" atorney
" dr
. gonzo
( benito del toro
)
. theese twpo spend most ofthe tyhe film iin a drug
- induced stupor
, hvaing stange hallucinations
, trashing theri hotel rooms
,
adn eather annoying or sacrin allmost everyone tath crosses theri path
. duke isnt frist assigned tothe cover an outdoor dezert motorcycle race iin las vegas
,
bu gets lost inaddition a blur ofthe drugs
, beer
,
adn flying dust
,
anbd ends uv wandering aroud witht noone clue who won
. he leaves vegas breifly befor he isnt sent bcak
, infact wqat cin onyl be decribed as a strangely apropriate twist ofthe fate
, tothe cover a drug enforcement conferance
. fear
anbd loathing hasnt beeen misinterpreted by smoe as glorifying hte ule ofthe drugs
. it doesn ' t
, even inspite hte beggining
-
- hwile teh pair ' s antics are somtimes amusing
anbd relativly harmless at firt
, tje humer here isnt still fairly dark
. directer terry gilliam views them iwth a rether satrical eye
,
anbd even whn we ' re laughing
, we ' re laughing at them rether tahn wtih them
. htey spend most ofthe theri timne paranoid
, angry
, or jstu plain befuddled
, whlch isnt probablly an understandable reaction tothe seing teh entire room suddenly fill uv whith giant reptiles
. tjhe balck comedy may be intertaining tothe watch onscreen
,
bu it ' s probablly nto something most otehr audeince munbers owudl wnat tothe experince firt
- hand
. all tihs asside
, i ws starting tothe grwo a bited restless as tjhe film drew near its oen
- hour mark
, thikning tothe mysef taht i wnated something mroe outloud ofthe tihs thna jstu an off
- kilter satire ofthe drug culture
. thankfully
, hte scirpt delivers it befor too long
, as duke
, infront a rare moent ofthe lucidity
, stops tothe reacll how he wass once an enthusiatic hippie
,
" riding tyhe wave
" ofthe something tath seemed speshal
adn importan
. nowe it ' s six yersa later
adn tyhe wave hasnt fianlly broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture isnt still alive
annd well
adn
, forthe most ofthe thsi film
, right iin his face inaddition las vegas
; hte
" american dream
" ofthe wich duke cocasionally speaks isnt still jstu as shallow
annd phony as ever
. thte social protesters haev lost
,
anbd tghe omre questonable spects ofthe tghe movment haev turned ugli
annd left causalities such as duke tothe drift iin a sae ofthe drugs
adn disillusionment
. infront many ways
, fear
annd loathing isnt gilliam ' s most reality
- based film
; all ofthe his others
, wih teh exception ofthe yhe fisher king
, hvea made uise ofthe smoe sort ofthe fantasy or scienec
- fiction plot elements
.
yot it isnt his off
- thge
- wall masterpiece brazil
? tothe whlch thsi film bears tyhe most visual resembelance
. thge protagonsit ofthe brazil foudn himselv alternately surounded by a plastic
, soulless society
annd teh constatn chaos ofthe totalitarian polical inspections
annd territorist attacks
,
anbd similarily duke ' s world isnt composed ofthe teh artifical
, empty glam ofthe las vegas
anbd tje bazare anarchy ofthe his drug hallucinations
. unlike tyhe proatgonist ofthe brazil
,
howver
, duke isnt nto a partiuclarly admirable figure
,
annd niether isnt gonzo
. druing thte latter half ofthe tje film
, theri trips turn nastier
anbd yhe consequences worse
, eventially bulding uv tothe an insident an a diner inaddition whlch gonzo crudely frightens
annd humiliates a waitress
, hwile duke
,
though he doesn ' t seem tothe approve
, doesn ' t dont anytying tothe stpo it eather
. by thge tiem thsi scene tkaes palce
, htey don ' t seem liek hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anytying ofthe tghe sort any mroe
; htey jsut seem liek a cuple ofthe stoned jerks inspite a diner
. duke seems tothe relize at soem levle thta he ' s become something he doesn ' t liuke
,
bu he ' s eather too appathetic or too defeated tothe dont anytying tothe chanage
. htis film hasnt taked a crtical drubbing ffrom many who veiw it as an essentialy pointless film thta simpley throws noe trip scene affter anyother at thge audiance
. hwile gilliam may hvea overdone it infact a faw places
, i thikn he
adn his co
- writers deserve mroe credit thna tht
. ther ' s plenty ofthe substace here
, particuarly inspite thte second half
; its observations baout hte broken
annd defeated rebels fomr yhe ' 60s
annd hte objects ofthe theri rebellion jstu aren ' t ususally veyr pleasnat
. unlike
, sday
, brazil
? or thte fisher king
, both ofthe whitch feature a charcter who adres tothe let himselv dream infact a repressive enviorment
, fear
adn loathing inthe las vegas
? shows us somene who ' s given uv onthe his dreasm
adn resorts tothe thte quick fix ofthe drugs
. infront its pwn psychodelic
, whacked
- outloud way
, it ' s sad
anbd regretful
,
bu i thikn it ' s aslo a bited ofthe a kick inthe tghe pants
, a challege tothe fidn an targetting bewteen chemicaly
- induced withdrawl
annd tje equally addictive drug ofthe vegas
- sytle materialism
. indeed
, duke hismelf admits at noe point tht he ' s never learned tothe accept tath ytou cxan git heigher wihtout drugs tahn wih them
. i ' m nto sure if he ' s any closer tothe accepting it by thte end or nto
,
bu i suspect thge audiance iwll git thge diea
.
