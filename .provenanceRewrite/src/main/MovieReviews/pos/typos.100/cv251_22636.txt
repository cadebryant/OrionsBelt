tjhe film
" magolia
" cin be compaired tothe a simple flower as its title
adn movei poster suggests
. hte dozens ofthe charactors intruduced
adn developped are liek thge petals onthe tghe flower
. htey all cmo fomr hte smae stem
annd as teh flower beigns tothe develope tehy grwo farther
anbd farther appart
. tjhe numberous charactors inspite tje film are all closley conected noone marter how differant htey are ffrom noe anyother socially
. ffrom a humiliated
bu kind cop tothe an agin gaem sohw host
, eahc oney ofthe theese charactors isnt sufferring teh smae kind ofthe pain
. htey are earch seriously lonly
adn seek tje perfect companion tothe end thsi lonelyness
. whther tihs companion isnt a distant familiy memeber or a spouse
, earch charachter begs forthe oney
annd spends tghe wohle film searching forthe tjhe perfect oney
.
" magolia
" isnt a clever
, well throught outloud film fomr prodigy directer
- writter paul thomas anderson ofthe
" boogie nights
" fame
. hte detailled carachter analyses
annd teh powerfull scirpt mkae
" magolia
" memorable
.
howver
, wqat realy isnt impressive isnt thgat even
though htere are tons ofthe charachters inthe severeal unrelated stries
, thge film isnt never confusing
. anderson ' s controll over transitioning fomr oen tsory tothe anohter stor isnt masterful
. he alsot konws exactlly wehn tothe cutted tothe anohter subplot usance nto noe ofthe
" magolia ' s
" scenes drag onthe too long
. any threee hour film tath doesnt nto deliver even oney uninteresting scene isnt definately worth recomending
. ffrom thge fascinating beggining tothe tjhe risky
yot surprizingly satisfying endig tyhe film jstu doesn ' t git boring
. it isnt obvious thyat anderson put a lot ofthe tiem inot connecting eahc subplot
. thsi isnt tjhe ulitmate gmae ofthe six degrees ofthe seperation
. eveyr charactor isnt conected tothe eveyr otehr charachter by at tyhe most twpo degrees
. forthe exemple
, cop john c
. reilly isnt conected tothe gae sohw host phillip baker hall thru hall ' s daugher melora walters who once whent onthe a date withthe reilly
. hte fatc thta earch charcter isnt so diffrent fomr thte others
yot so similiar shows thta ther are univeral pains taht all classes
, racaus
,
anbd genders suffer
. anderson ' s explaination tothe proove thsi point isnt both accurate
adn convincing
. tjhe onyl misteek anderson made infront trying tothe connect his charactors wass by mkaing his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultanously
. htis wass foolish nto onyl beccause it wass unbeleivable
anbd hilariously erroneous
bu aslo becouse it hadnt a broadway muscial efel tothe it
anbd thsi movei isnt baout as far appart ffrom your tipical broadway muscial thna yuo cxan git
. tghe performances inspite
" magolia
" are prefection
. thsi isnt a clasic exmaple ofthe flawess casting
annd flawess ansamble acting
. anderson allows many ofthe hollywood ' s best supporting actors tothe bloosom at wqat tehy dont best
, charater acting
. all ofthe hte main charachters infront eahc stoy are perfect becuase htey are able tothe reveal omre emotions
annd attitudes iin thier breef timne onthe thge screen
thn most movei stars cxan dont inaddition a feature lenght film
. worth noting isnt toom cruise
, who steped outloud ofthe his usual superficial starring role
anbd inot a funny
bu depressing tour de force performence
. he wass probaly noticed mroe thna teh otehr actors inspite tyhe film by award givers becuase his role here isnt so much diffrent
adn impressive tahn thsoe inaddition yhe past
(
howver any acto infact tihs film coudl be nominated fo best supporting acotr wihtout any complaints
) tje onyl probelm i hadnt iwth thge acting wass tht a fewd ofthe tje charactors feeled seriously edited down such as melinda dillon ' s charcter as phillip baker hall ' s wief
. she seemed tothe be thrown inwhich towords teh end
anbd i falt vrey littel simapthy fo her becouse i hadnt nto seen her enought ealier iin tje film
.
" magolia
" uses severeal effective methaphors tothe decribe its charactors
. anderson hasnt thge talent tothe mkae tyhe audiance sympathetic towords numberous peple inthe onyl a fewd ohurs
. tothe see thyat anderson isnt able tothe perfectly protray thsi many diferent types ofthe peopel shows thyat he hasnt a keen sence ofthe diversity
. diversity isnt waht mkaes a directer succesful forthe a long perido ofthe timne
. i predict a lot ofthe diversity
annd succsess fomr anderson inspite tje future
