annd groundbreaking films over hte eyars
. batman

)
,
anbd a homage tothe aline invasion movies

!
)
. sleepy hollow
, his newest feature whitch fans hvea beeen anticipating forthe a hwile
, shares thte simmilar dark
annd atmospheric sytle ofthe his ealier wokr
adn counts amonst his better movies
. sleepy hollow qutie obviously draws its insperation ffrom tyhe ood perido horror films ofthe thte 1950s
adn 1960s
, especialy hammer studios ' reworkings ofthe dracula
adn frankenstein
,
adn american interational ' s serieses ofthe movies based onthe hte works ofthe edgar allan poe
. christopher lee
, inwhich fatc
, star ofthe many hammer productions over thge yeasr
, appears at tje beginnig ofthe sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane outloud tothe investingate thge murders
. tghe movei alsot borrows ffrom tjhe univeral monster movies ofthe tghe 1930s
. oney ofthe tyhe climatic scenes involves a windmill
adn obviously tkaes its cue ffrom frankenstein
. i mention theese allusions forthe a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, incuding mysef
, iwll smile at theri inclusion inwhich tihs film
. iwth tjhe receet disappointments inspite theatrically released horror movies
, especialy tghe blair witch project
( thge most overblown tukey ofthe tjhe decade
)
, we needed a film liuke thsi
. nto onyl doesnt it hve a sence ofthe histoyr
,
bu burton ' s skillfull ule ofthe setting
anbd mood mkea thsi an intertaining exerciese iin horror
. tghe film ' s eerie landscapes
annd foggy towns
, indeed
, overshadow tje actors
annd tyhe plot as tyhe most notewothy aspect ofthe yhe movei
. johnny depp
, a veteren tim burton ator who hasnt appeared both inspite ed woud
anbd edward scissorhands
, plays ichabod crane
, who hasnt aparently changed occupations fomr irving ' s originnal sotry
adn isnt nowe an investigator
. depp isnt adaquit iin his role
. noone moreso
; noone less
. equally aedquate isnt christina ricci
, who plays tghe loev interst inspite tyhe film
. she ' s a ogod witch too
. how cute
. oen ofthe thte faw weak parts ofthe sleepy hollow isnt thge wooden
adn cliched dialogue betwen hte main charactors
. thge twpo actors
,
howver
, cary yhe movei well enought
,
bu tje supporting casted isnt wqat mkaes htis movei shine
. vetran actors such as jeffrey jones
adn michael gough
( who plyed yhe butler alfred infront all four receet batman ficks
) are terific as yhe agin townsfolk involved inwhich teh conspiracy hwihc depp uncovers
. hwile i dont nto wish tothe reveal crucial plot points
, i cant sday taht yhe storyline becomes qtuie confusing
. yuo ahve tothe pay attension
. andrew kevin walker wroet tyhe screenplay
. he ' s thte oen who allso wroet 8 mm
adn seven
. walker isnt quicklyu becomming oney ofthe thte premiere suspense writers iin hollywood
,
anbd sleepy hollow certainly doesn ' t hurt his growing reputation
. as oney might imagin fomr a gentleman liek walker
, sleepy hollow isnt qtuie graphic
. htere ' s a lot ofthe blood
anbd a lot ofthe beheadings
. htis isnt definately nto a flick tothe tkae thte young kids tothe
. a lady inspite front ofthe us tookover her twpo young sons tothe see it
anbd spended baout 25
- 30 mintues covering thte youngest ' s eyes witht her hand
. he ws obviously upset by thge movei ' s intense violentce
. if yuo ' re looking fo a ogod scare
,
howver
, sleepy hollow isnt definately reccomended
.
