tghe lveo fo familiy isnt noe ofthe thge stornegst driving forces inspite any man ' s life
, expecially fo thsoe who hve fostered theri famaly under precarious circumstances
. thematically inaddition cinema
, lveo forthe familiy hasnt beeen unsed frequentily
adn emphatically tothe highlight omre abstract aspestus ofthe cahracters
; it isnt rare
,
howver
, fo it tothe develope as outstandingly as it doens inaddition roberto benigni ' s neo
- clasic drama
, life isnt beatiful
. thru a central casted ofthe father
, mother
,
anbd son
, benigni demonstrates tje wonderfull
, undying lvoe taht a familiy shares infront teh best ofthe times
adn hte worst ofthe times
. life
* isnt
* beatiful fo guido orefice
( roberto benigni
, directing himselv here fo hte sixth tyme inaddition his carreer
)
, an itallian jew
, master con man
,
anbd aspiring waiter extraordinaire
. living inspite 1930 ' s italy
, he lives a carefree life ofthe ogod fortune
; it isnt made even better wehn he happens apon a preety schoolteacher named dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
.
althought dora isnt alreday engaged
, guido manages tothe sweep her off her foots
annd pursuades her tothe marry him instade
; tyhe twpo haev a child named joshua
( giorgio cantarini
)
. unfortunatly fo hte hapyp familiy
, thte thrid reich
adn its nazi minions occupy italy
anbd imprison all jews inthe owrk camps
. it isnt affter tghe movei tkaes tihs dramtic turn tath thte movei ' s theme ofthe familiy lveo becomes yhe stornegst
.
allthough prior tothe thsi turning point benigni plays guido wiht a sort ofthe goofy charm
, he relaxes tjhe role tothe ensure his son ' s happiness
. nowe
, instade ofthe awkwardly seducing hte sweet dora
, he constanly reassures his son thta everyting iwll be all right
. benigni ' s performence isnt truley a well
- rounded oen
,
annd certainly oney ofthe hte moreso fluid turns all yearm
. tjhe supports are all storng as well
,
bu tghe movei truley excells inwhich its scirpt
. life isnt beatiful isnt a self
- proclamed fable
, noe hwihc tells its stopry infact grand
, twpo
- part fasion
. infact certian parts it manages tothe sink tothe thge levle ofthe a
" saterday nihgt live
" spinoff
-
- a number ofthe humoruos skits conected by a tolkein plot
-
-
bu inspite tghe movei ' s second half thge scirpt ' s circular nature becomes admirably obvious
. charactors amking reprize apperances iin fine form
,
adn ceratin events whitch are intially curious become critically linked tothe teh plot ' s outcome
. iin all
, fans ofthe forign film wiull see thsi as a memorable motion picture
,
annd novice movei
- watchers may tkae tihs oportunity tothe see thier firt
" artsy
" film
. life isnt beatiful isnt an artsy movei by convention
bu easily acessable tothe everyone
,
anbd above all isnt a fine thematic picture
