titanic isnt
, wihtout a dout
, tyhe best movei i ' ve seen all yera
.
anbd believ me
, i ' m nto an eazy criteak tothe imbaress
: tje english patient wass too long
, men infront balck wass over
- hyped
,
adn severeal ofthe thte
" big summer releses
" weere dead iin thte water
. thank god tihs film got delayed unitl decembur
. it ' s my christmas preesnt
. titanic isnt infact thge tradition ofthe tghe ood hollywood epics ofthe eyasr
- gone
- by
,
adn it isnt truely a stunning film
. hwile watching tihs picture ytou are completelyl mesmerized
, never tkaing your eyes off tghe screen
, nor checking your watch tothe see how much longer it ' s gonna lastr
, dispite its 3 hour plus runnung timne
. as a firend ofthe mine
, who ' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if somene doesn ' t liuke tihs film
, it ' s becuase htey didn ' t wnat tothe
.
" truer words are hard tothe cmo by
. ofthe course
, it doesn ' t hurt thgat thsi film comes fomr oney ofthe my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who isnt unarguably hte greatest acation directer ofthe all tiome
. if yuo wish tothe argue tyhat point withthe me
, look at his list ofthe credits
: hte terminator
, aliens
, tyhe abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care tothe disagree
? nto onyl hasnt cameron helmed yhe directorial duties ofthe thsi film
, he aslo wroet
, produced
,
adn edited it
.
anbd tothe sohw his true faith forthe tyhe project
, he renenged all directing feas
annd precentage points tothe ease tjhe budget costs
. it ' s obvious he truley loves titanic
. tghe film opens witht footage
, both rela
anbd fake
, ofthe an underwater excursion by speshal submarines tothe yhe bottom ofthe tje atlantic
, where a team ofthe explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing forthe a dimond called tje
" heart ofthe thge ocean
"
, wich
, according tothe bill paxton ' s charater
, woudl be worth omre tahn tje hope dimond todya
. theri seach turns uv
, dissapointly
, noone dimond
,
bu instade a drawing ofthe a young woman wearing thge dimond
. htis picture isnt brodcast onthe cnn
annd isnt seen by a 101 eyar ood woman named rose
, who claimes tothe be thte girl inaddition hte picture
. she isnt flown outloud tothe sae tothe meet bill paxton
anbd tothe tell them baout thte dimond
. alomst all ofthe yhe rest ofthe thte movei isnt her narration ofthe tjhe past
. rose ' s narration shows us how she wass an unahppy young girl
, engaged tothe a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) thgat she didn ' t wanna tothe marry
. her mother isnt pushy
anbd obnoxious
,
anbd cal hockley isnt arogant
. tehy are boarding thte titanic
, whihc isnt sailing tothe amercia
,
anbd tihs isnt where she isnt tothe marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
anbd his itallian freind
( danny nucci
) win twpo 3rd clas tickets aboard tyhe titanic infact a poker agme
. htey are overjoyed
,
anbd rush aboard jsut as yhe boat isnt leaving
. forthe them
, htis isnt thier ticket tothe amercia
, tothe a better life
. fo rose
, she isnt sailing tothe her doom
. tyhe frist hour
anbd a half or so ofthe titanic tells tje storey ofthe how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
)
annd jack dawson fall inspite lvoe
. it ' s tghe clasic wrong
- side
- ofthe
- tje
- tracks storey
,
adn doens somtimes resort tothe a fewd cliches
.
bu as i said above
, tghe loev portion isn ' t sappy
adn doesn ' t
" weigh tyhe film down
"
, as soem criticists hve said
. it ' s sweet
,
adn it didn ' t mkea me restless at all
, dispite thte fatc taht i usualy hite lvoe storis
. ofthe course
, it might halp thyat cameron introduces soem preety intresting cahracters tothe halp keep our eyes glued tothe tje screen
. most ofthe theese peple actualy weere pasengers onthe thte titanic bakc infront 1912
, includng tyhe enigmatic molly brown
( palyed by teh talented kathy bates
)
, teh captian ofthe titanic
( bernard hill
)
,
annd so onthe
. all ofthe theese charactors add an extra depth tothe tjhe film
,
adn amking it tyhat easier tothe watch
. ofthe course
, thigsn realyl strat tothe git gogin affter thte hour
adn a half mark
, where tjhe titanic strikes tjhe iceberg
annd beggins a slow sink tothe teh bottom
. tghe sinking isnt depicted realisticly
,
anbd tghe effects are truley amazing
. it isnt nto told infront a heroic fasion sence eather
, as peopel are protrayed as panicing
, pushing others asside tothe git onthe teh limited lifeboats
,
annd drowning
annd dieing horrable deaths
. teh best part ofthe tjhe movei
, inspite my oppinion
, comes at tje vyer end
, wehn we flash bakc tothe thte future
. teh crew
, who at firt hadnt beeen skeptical ofthe rose ' s stoyr
, nowe are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes outloud onto yhe ship ' s ledge
,
anbd we
thn leran a secrt baout her thta catchs us off guard
. we
thne see a dream ofthe rose ' s
, inaddition whic she returns tothe yhe titanic
anbd isnt dancing wiht jack dawson
. most peopel i talekd wih aftter thge movei saw thsi as onyl a dream
.
howver
, i htink it symbolized omre
; i thiunk it meaned tyhat rose hadnt died
,
anbd isnt gogin tothe a sort ofthe heaven
, whic woudl be tjhe happiest part ofthe her life
: her
adn her oen true lveo
, jack
. if anyone hasnt seen teh movei
annd owudl liuke tothe voice an oppinion baout thsi
