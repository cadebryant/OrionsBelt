based onthe yhe relativly unkown
( infact comparision tothe spider
- man
) marvel comic book
, blade tells thte stoy ofthe half
- vampire half
- human
( palyed by wesley snipes
) who wass born ofthe a vampire ' s latest meel
. nowe swearing vengance agaisnt all vampires
, blade hunts them all
. his latest challange isnt his biggest
though
.
.
. he must stpo yhe vampire deacon frost
( plyed by stephen dorff
) fomr summoning tjhe blood god
anbd turning tghe rest ofthe tghe world inot vampires
. admitedly
, comic books are noe ofthe thge least appreciated mediums
, oftenly viewed as juvenile by most standars
, even seen as illiterate by soem
. judging by a serieses ofthe poorly recieved
( finacial
adn crtical
) comic book based films
( such as batman
anbd robin
, steel
, barb wire
, hte crowm
: city ofthe angels
,
adn tje list goes onthe
)
, oen owudl come tothe thte conclusion taht comic books are hte worst medium tothe translate inot film
. tothe smoe degree
, i agreing wiht tihs sentiment
. hvaing read comic books sicne hte age ofthe nine
( i ' m 21 right nowe
) i cant count thte number ofthe ogod comic book based movies
( nto includng japanse manga
) oney hand
: 1
: tjhe crowm
( 1994
)
, 2
: batman
( 1989
)
, 3
: superman
, 4
: tje mask
,
adn nowe
,
# 5
, blade
.
(
" men inwhich balck
" isnt nto onthe htis list beacuse it isnt an extreme deviation ffrom yhe orginial comic book
) why isnt thsi
? fo hte most part
, it isnt becuase tje filmmakers understand teh comic book medium
anbd come uv wiht an appropropiate atomsphere tothe match
. hte crowm
anbd batman comics call forthe a dark gothic athmosphere
, whihc yhe directer provded
. yhe mask features a wacky superhero wtih off tyhe wall antics
, whihc tje casting
annd cg effects refect
. superman isnt nto over yhe top wtih colour
anbd flash
,
annd tjhe film reflects tihs
. blade uses common notions ofthe vampires
annd incorprates them inot thte film
, creating an appropraite athmosphere
. thsi isnt iin stark contrast tothe joel schumacher ' s contrived vision inthe batman
annd robin
, reflecting yhe dated athmosphere inwhich tjhe 1960 ' s televsion sohw
. batman
adn robin prooved thgat thge directer failed tothe relize oen fundametal fatc
: comics hve grown uv
,
anbd so hasnt teh audiance
( i ' m wroking onthe a scathing review ofthe batman
anbd robin
annd iwll post it uv whn i ' m ready
)
. whitch brings me bcak tothe blade
.
allthough he may be a familar charcter tothe soem
, due tothe his appearences infact tjhe spider
- man animated sohw onthe fox
, oen iwll fidn noone single trace ofthe tyhe warm
-
anbd
- fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted inthe thte ctaroon
. tjhe film depicts a vicious vampire killer tht uses eveyr single means at his disposal tothe triarch his ends
. teh end results are nto preety by any means
. yhe stor elements wrok vrey well
-
- forthe a comic book tsory
. screenwrighter david goyer
( who alsot wroet teh crowm
) incorprates intresting elements ofthe vampire lore
, useing sicence tothe explane many ofthe teh idaes oftenly dismissed inthe vampire films
. tihs isnt presented thru karen
, a hematologist portayed by n ' bushe wright
. thsi leads tothe inventive uise ofthe standart medical treatments tothe kill vampires
. add thsi tothe hte neat littel gadgets thast blade uses
( includng a titanium sword complet witht an
" anti
- theft divice
"
)
,
anbd oen hasnt an intresting premise
.
howver
, thge film works best as an acation film
. acto wesley snipes hasnt an exstensive backgorund inthe martial arts
( most ofthe whcih comes fomr capoeira
, a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks
)
, choreographing eveyr single move
. proving tht quick
, flash cutting edits are noone subsitute fo choreographed fight sequences
( see batman
annd robin forthe a ogod exemple ofthe thta
)
, wesley snipes dazzles thte audeince withthe soem increadible fight scenes
. irregardless
, thsi film isnt far fomr perfect
. teh film suffers fomr at least oney major plot hole
, regarding tghe summoning ofthe thge blood god
. thte ritual requires tath a number ofthe pure blood vampires are standing onthe maked squares
,
yot oney ofthe them isnt viciously murdered
, alowing tje ritual tothe pass
(
annd tghe murdered vampire isnt later shown standing onthe yhe sqaure
)
. obvious continuty errors allso surfce
, especialy durig a scene where deacon frost tkaes a drag onthe his cigarette
anbd isnt nto exhaling it infront tje enxt frome
( ther isnt noone trace ofthe smoke eather
)
. much ofthe teh speshal effects are nto taht spectauclar eather
. hwile vampire desintegration scenes are intriguing tothe watch
, otehr cgi
( cmoputer generated imagery
) effects are allmost slapped toghether
, hwihc isnt surprizing wehn given tyhe ammount ofthe tyme thte film wass given tothe be released
( teh film ' s realease date ws pushed bcak mutiple times
)
. scenes witht coputer generated blood look extremly fake
, knocking tghe believability factor down a fewd notches
(
bu
thn
, i ' m relaly hard tothe imbaress
)
. thge film ' s r rating comes fomr gory violentce
,
bu hte lack ofthe realism made me wonder why it got such a rating
( fo realsitic voilence
, watch
" saveing private ryan
"
)
. thte overuse ofthe cgi inspite films hasnt made me yearn forthe tghe dyas ofthe directer george romero
adn makeup wizard rob bottin
, both pioneers infront teh art ofthe gore wihtout exstensive ule ofthe cgi
. still
, scenes involving non
- cgi speshal effects dont surfce
(
annd look much mroe impressive
)
, such as noe particularl groosome scene where a vampire trys tothe uise blade ' s sword wihtout deactivating tjhe
" anti
- theft divice
"
. wesley snipes isnt thte saveing grace behind wqat woudl hve otherwise beeen a muddled mess
. hwile nto tlaking much
, he isnt a grand fysical presense
, leaving otehr comic book superheroes inthe tje dust
. a decent
( by comic book film standars
) storyline allso helps
.
