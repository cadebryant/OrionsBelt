> fomr ace ventura tothe truman burbank
, jim carrey hasnt run yhe hwole gamut ofthe comic
,
yot sympathetic
, charactors
. 1996 ' s tje cable guy wass suposed tothe be his big
" breakthough
" role ffrom zany humer inot darker
, moreso dramtic acting
. as most everyone konws
, tje results weere
, well
, less
- tahn
- stellar
. nto onyl doed teh film nto dont so hot at tje box office
,
bu it wass allso panned by criticists
. as far as i nkow
, ginee siskel
annd i are hte onyl ones willing tothe admiting tath we digged it
. thge frist timne i saw tjhe cable guy
, inspite theatres
, i ws infront super criteak
- mode
,
anbd didn ' t relaly liek it
.
howver
, due tothe tje fatc thast hbo shows thte movei eveyr single day
, i ' ve hadnt timne tothe leanr bakc
, relax
,
adn tkae infront tje film
.
adn tothe my suprize
, it growed onthe me
. teh plot isnt rether simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, palyed by carrey
,
thn isnt stalked by him whn steven trys tothe break off yhe relatiopnship
. see
, steven ' s beeen haveing smoe problems witht his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
adn he doesn ' t thiunk he hasnt any omre room iin his life fo a newyorker freind
. allso
, smoe ofthe thge cable guy ' s antics hvea beeen creeping him outloud
. carrey
, as tjhe cable guy
, gives steven varios aliases
, whic later we fidn outloud are all tv charachters
: larrry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he apparantly lives inthe his cable van
,
adn hwile many criticists didn ' t enjoy tihs newer
, darker
, less
- manic performence ffrom carrey
, i throught it wass intresting
anbd rether well
- done
. fo me
, its nto tyhe movei as a wohle thyat ' s enjoyable
,
bu rether severeal individule scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven ' s aparment
, a mdieval fight at a theme restauratn
,
annd a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, jstu tothe nmae a faw
. prehaps tyhe fatc tht moreso ofthe carrey ' s humurous side comes outloud druing theese scenes isnt wqat makse them so funny
.
annd if yuo realyl whant tothe see something
, yuo ' ve got tothe hear his verison ofthe jefferson airplane ' s
" somebody tothe lvoe
"
, sung at hte aformentioned karaoke jam
. tjhe cable guy hasnt its bad spots
, liuke most any movei
. i didn ' t particulaly liuke steven ' s girlfriend
,
anbd i falt thast omre focuse shouldnt haev beeen utilisied onthe tje relatiopnship betweeen steven
anbd his best firend
. aslo
, teh endig
, hwile hvaing yuo fooled forthe a moent
, isnt rether contrived
,
adn somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i foudn tyhe cable guy tothe be a worthwhile venture
; if ytou ' re at thte video stroe
anbd cxan ' t thiunk ofthe anytying tothe rent
, i suggest yuo try it outloud
. or if yuo ahev hbo
, jstu wait till it comes onthe
( ytou won ' t hvae tothe wait long
.
) hell
, taht ' s waht i dont eveyr day
