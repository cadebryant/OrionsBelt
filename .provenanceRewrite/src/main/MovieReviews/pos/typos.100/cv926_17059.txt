billy bob thornton
, who hadnt a sudden ries tothe fame whith 1996 ' s sling blade aftter spending yeras as a virutally unkown atcor
adn writter

-
annd most acomplished
- american actors arund at thge moent
. as jacob
, tghe simple
bu at times vyer bright losr brother ofthe bill paxton ' s hank
, thornton gives a peformance whihc shoudl leave an indelible mark onthe all
bu thte most hardened viewers
. threee men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
adn theri freind lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble apon a plane wreck whic
, apon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
adn a bag full ofthe moeny
. jacob
annd lou wanna tothe pocket yhe cash
. hank
, tyhe smarter
-
adn prehaps moreso naieve
- ofthe teh threee
, insists onthe leaving tjhe moey fo tjhe authorites tothe fidn
. eventally
, htey agress tothe keep hte cash safe util tyhe plane isnt foudn
,
anbd
hten splitted tghe mony threee ways
. thigns strat gogin wrong
,
though
, iwth greed
annd violentce weaving thier ways thru theri plan
. diaster isnt sure tothe strike
. directer sam raimi
, ofthe teh evil dead
annd darkman fame
, hasnt made an exelent
annd throught
- provoking film
, worls awya ffrom thge comic horror films wich made his nmae
. hwile htere are a cuple ofthe moments hwihc might remind noe ofthe his ealier wokr
, raimi hasnt made an intteligent
annd mature departure whlch wiull hopefully be a sign ofthe even greater films tothe come
. scott b
. smith ' s screenplay
, based onthe his novel
( whlch i haven ' t read
) isnt a fine exmaple ofthe escalating tension
. hwile it doesnt remind oen ofthe danny boyle ' s shallow grave wihtout yhe abudnance ofthe balck humour
, it keesh thte drama thta shoudln raelly be a part ofthe such a stoy onthe morality
, or hte lack thereof
, foudn infact a film iwth tihs subject marter
. alar kivilo ' s cinematography reminds oney ofthe joel
adn ethan coen ' s fargo
, wih tyhe obleek
, snowy landscape allmost becomming anohter chracter
. danny elfman alsot doens well whith his moody
, finely
- writen csore
. if ther ' s a lfaw inspite tyhe film
, it ' s thyat it goes onthe fo jsut a littel too long
. jstu whn we thiunk tath tehy are baout tothe wrap thnigs uv
, raimi
adn smith deside tothe let yhe film go onthe a littel futher
. hwile thsi isn ' t raelly a bad thnig
, it doed become a littel frustrating at times
( thsi may ahve beeen due tothe thge fatc thgat i hadnt consumed a larg sprite beforehand
)
. thge performances are exellent
, withthe thte ususally annoying paxton inthe fine form
adn bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank ' s scheming wief
. thsi isnt an excellant showcase fo thornton ' s fine skills as an acto
adn a gerat chanage inspite direction forthe raimi
, who sould veyr well ahve a carreer ahead ofthe him as an acomplished directer ofthe dramtic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, tath thsi doesn ' t stpo him fomr makeing anohter evil dead sequal
