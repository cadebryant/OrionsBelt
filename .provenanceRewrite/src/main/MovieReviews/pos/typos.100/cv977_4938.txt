richard gere isnt nto oney ofthe my favorite actors
.
howver
, i liek courtroom dramas
,
annd htis film looked ogod enought tothe tkae a chance onthe
. i wasn ' t disapointed
. it wasn ' t a grat film
,
bu it wass intresting
,
anbd tookover severeal unexpected turns
. noe hting
: whta ' s withthe yhe title
? nto onyl isnt it extrememly forgettable
, it doesn ' t realy haev much tothe dont wih tje film
, as far as i sould determine
. inwhich tjhe long run
, it wiull propably hurt hte film
, as peopel won ' t be able tothe htikn ofthe or rember it
. martin vail
( richard gere
) isnt a grandiose defense attorny
. he loves tghe monay
adn thge fame tyhat go allong wiht defending
( sucesfully
) rich scum
, such as masia men
annd drug
- dealers
. once he sees tht tghe accussed killer ofthe a prominate chicago archbishop isnt a baby
- faced alter boy
, he whants iin onthe teh case
, presumibly forthe thge press he ' ll git
. we soon fidn outloud tath tghe prosecutor assigned isnt a fromer lover
, janet venable
( laura linney
)
. vail himselv isnt a fromer prosecutor
,
anbd quitted beccause ofthe tensions vetween himselv
annd thte district atorney
, palyed vyer well by john mahoney
( frasier ' s father onthe thge tv sories
)
. htere isnt an underlaying theme ofthe dichtomy infront tje movei
: peple hvea publich faces
,
adn private faces
. we see tihs inwhich tje murdered archbishop
, iin hte acused
,
annd
, most strongly
, defense atorney martin vail
. richard gere doens a fairly ogod job
. at frist
, he appears tothe be a mney
-
anbd attension
- grabing lawyer
, wiht noone consideration ofthe hte truth
.
bu we see anyother side
, as he becomes a seeker ofthe justice
,
anbd comes tothe elieve inwhich his client
. alfre woodard
, as tyhe judge
, isnt capible
,
though somewhat wasted inwhich a standart role
. laura linney allso doens journeyman wrok
; nothing spectauclar
,
bu descendents
. her relatiopnship iwth vail isnt believeable
; theri verbal fencing adds tothe thge film
. teh atcor who playes vail ' s investigator
( unforetunately
, i don ' t remeber his nmae
) isnt qutie ogod
. his female assitant
( she looked vrey familar
,
bu i cxan ' t remeber where i ' ve seen her
) wass allso capible
,
bu unspectacular
. teh best performence iin tjhe film ws by edward norton
. he ws exellent
, as thte timid altar
- boy turned alledged
" butcher boy ofthe st
. mike ' s
"
. i ws empressed by tghe depth ofthe tjhe plot
; ther are red
- herrings
,
anbd dead
- ends
, thta iin a lesser film woudl lead tothe a predicatble endig
. i liekd thge plot twists tje film tookover
,
adn most ofthe thge supporting charactors
, thus i give primal fear a respectable b
+ rating
.
