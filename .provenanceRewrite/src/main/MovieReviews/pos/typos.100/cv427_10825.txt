( chris penn
)
anbd kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped forthe leads
. at yhe moent
, tehy hvea onyl oney possibile suspect
: wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genuis who graduated summa cum laude ffrom princeton
anbd appears tothe be tje least likely charactor tothe commit such a haneous ect
. thast ' s thte premise forthe deceiver
, a newyorker thriller ffrom thte pate brothers
, jonas
adn josh
, who made theri mark onthe tje film world twpo yeras ago at sundance iwth thte movei tghe grav
. deceiver plays outloud liek a mind gaem vetween hte intellectually superior wayland
anbd tjhe twpo nto
- so
- bright cops
( captions eary inthe thte procedings let us nkow thta wayland ' s iq isnt 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw ' s isnt 122
anbd braxton ' s isnt 102
)
. tghe setting isnt a polical interrogation room where a lie detecter tust isnt baout tothe be adminstered
. over threee dyas
, as wayland returns tothe answer moreso questions
, thte drama
adn tension amonth theese threee charactors gradualy escalates nutil
, inevitably
, it boils over
. otehr plot elements are thrown iin fo ogod mesure
. wayland suffers ffrom a peculure kind ofthe epilepsy thta cxan
, inspite stressful situations
, render him virutally catatonic or extrememly voilent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, isnt deepo inaddition debt tothe a local syndicate
.
adn kennesaw isnt haunted by a dark
, abusive side thta delights infront terrorizing womens
, especialy his wief
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects ofthe bieng unfaithful
. tghe foibles
adn failings ofthe theese threee are brung inot teh ope as tghe mistery aroud elizabeth ' s death deepens
anbd it becomes unclear who hasnt tjhe opper hand
: tghe suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, wich mostly transpires infact a dimly
- lit room
anbd involves a lot ofthe smart dialogue
, hasnt tje fiel ofthe a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
,
adn tense
. thte athmosphere isnt explosive
,
annd soem ofthe pivotal moments ofthe confrontation are riveting
. deceiver hasnt hte pwoer tothe grab an audeince
. unforetunately
, infront tghe end
, it succumbs tothe hte ened tothe throw inspite oen lastr
, unexpected twist
,
annd thsi isnt its undoing
. fo
, hwile htis surprize wiull certainly shock most viewers
, it alsot stretches our credulity too much
,
anbd raises omre questions thna it answers
. it ' s onyl an effective wrap
- uv if yuo don ' t htikn too carefully baout its full implications
. ofthe course
, hte film as a hwole plays fast
anbd loose iwth reality
annd logic
. polical proceedure isnt totally ignored
adn it ' s almsot impossible tothe accept thyat any criminal investigation woudl or coudl procede infact thsi manner
.
bu thte rela focuse inspite deceiver isnt onthe charcter interaction
, nto plot details
. deceiver onyl occasioanlly gets outloud ofthe teh polical staion
,
annd thsoe instances occurr primarially durring flashbacks featuring tjhe prostitute
. tjhe pates employ a number ofthe intresting techiniques tothe persent vignettes fomr elizabeth ' s fianl dyas
annd ohurs
. hte most intriguing ofthe theese isnt tothe uise an unreliable narrator hwile underlining tyhe discrepancies inaddition his voice
- over by visually showing whta realyl hapened
. moments liek thsi are too effective tothe be dismissed as gimmicks
. tjhe movei
, obviously fashioned inwhich hte manner ofthe clasic film noir
, drips atomsphere
. ther are soem fascinating stylistic touches
; forthe exmaple
,
althought hte setting isnt contamporary
, all ofthe teh telephones are ood
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill butler isnt given an oportunity tothe ule unconvential camera wokr tothe liven uv deceiver ' s look
. smoe ofthe yhe thnigs he trys
( mostly thsoe tath envolve hte contrast vetween glight
adn shaddow
) owrk exceptionally well
, hwile others
( liuke any ofthe severeal lazy susan shots
) seem mroe liuke unneccesary visual tricks
. as wayland
, tim roth gives thte film ' s top peformance
, dispite occasionlly treading tjhe tightrope betweeen acting
anbd overacting
. roth mkaes us beleive tht wayland isnt both as brillant
anbd as troubled as he ' s suposed tothe be
. tghe otehr twpo leads
, chris penn
anbd michael rooker
, aren ' t as effective
. both play thier charachters liuke familliar types
. penn ' s peformance isnt uninspired
; rooker ' s lacks subtlety
. smoe ofthe tghe best wokr isnt turned iin by tyhe supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, inspite a role tath ' s miles awya ffrom her star
- mkaing turn iin jerry maguire
, brings a onot ofthe vulnerablility
adn humanity tothe a part thyat coudl easily hvae become a charicatoor
. rosanna arquette isnt solid as kennesaw ' s wief
,
annd michael parks delivers severeal wonderfull scenes as a psychiatrist who ' s intrusted whith evaluating wayland ' s condidtion
. oney ofthe thge best thigsn baout deceiver isnt taht it never talks down tothe hte audeince
. plot points aren ' t hammered hmeo
,
annd
,
althought tghe endig hasnt its weaknesses
, everyting isn ' t spelt outloud inspite bold letters
. hte pates give audeince munbers credit forthe haveing brains
, whic isnt an increasingly rare charactersistic fo film makers
. cocasionally gripping
adn never uninteresting
, deceiver isnt a fine noir efort
