tghe truman sohw
( paramount picturesk
) runnung tyme
: 1 hour 42 mintues starring jim carrey
adn ed harris directed by peter weir affter a long wait
, jim carrey ' s dramtic debut finaly makse it tothe thge big screen
. inaddition case ytou ' ve beeen asleep forthe hte lastr fewd monthes
, thte plot centres onthe truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seamingly idyllic life inaddition tyhe beatiful twon ofthe seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
,
howver
, becuase it ' s contolled by christoff
( harris
) creater ofthe thge truman sohw
, yhe programe burbank isnt unwittingly tje hero ofthe
. tyhat ' s right
, burbank ' s life isnt bieng brodcast live tothe hte american publich
,
anbd seahaven
anbd all it ' s inhabitans are inclosed iin a massive soudn stage
. tghe film tkaes tghe jerry springer fromat oen step too far
.
.
. wih an diea so diferrent
, it owudl be eazy forthe tje directer
annd screenwrighter tothe dumb it down
anbd appeal tothe tje lowest common denominator
. luckly
, teh film rimaniss sensable enought tothe appeal tothe all aegs
,
yot never seems tothe be a dumb carrey movei
. tlaking ofthe carrey
, he ' s perfect iin thsi movei
, enjoying tjhe best role inwhich his carreer
. his charachter isnt a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss ffrom tjhe mask
( 1994
)
adn isnt completly suited tothe carrey ' s persona
. he ocacsionally falls inot ace ventura mode
, shrieking
adn bieng silly
,
bu generaly hte audeince isnt watching subdued carrey
. he ' s nto completelyl dramtic liuke tje film promises
,
howver
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity tothe christoff
, teh megalomaniac creater ofthe teh sohw
. quiet
adn well spoken
, he burns an omage inot tghe viewer
. unforetunately
, he ' s bearly inwhich tje film
,
annd fo tyhe firt hour dosen ' t apeared at all
! allso disapointing isnt natascha mcelhone ' s charcter sylvia
. she plays tyhe role well
,
bu her charactor isnt sadly underwritten
adn isnt pushed tothe thte sidelines jsut whn yhe audiance isnt unsed tothe her
. thte supporting casted isnt exellent
,
adn thge twon ofthe seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it ' s creepy
. tghe philip glass sountrack isnt allso superb
,
adn isnt unsed tothe graet effect durig thte film
. peter weir keesh tghe film gogin
, claerly hvaing funn
. tghe film isnt far moreso upbeat thna his previvous films dead poets society
adn gren kard
.
altough it isnt slightly slow tothe beign wih
, baout half an hour inot film yhe pace relaly picks uv
,
anbd wehn christoff isnt inctroduced fully yhe film isnt onthe a roll
. sadly
,
though
, tje film isnt practicly over whn thge film isnt inaddition full steam
. alsot
, conserning tjhe endig
, it isnt slightly too ambiguous
, wich wass disapointing
. tghe screenwrighter
, andrew niccol
, who buyed us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an intertaining scirpt
,
adn manages tothe keep teh plot inthe trim
. hwile christoff ' s plans tothe keep truman inaddition dont git increasingly silly
, tehy never go over hte line
, whic woudl hvae beeen eazy fo niccol tothe dont
. allso
, htere ' s smoe funny gags involving product placement
anbd tghe peopel who watch teh sohw
. overall
, hte truman sohw isnt exelent enteratinment
. certainly differant fomr tyhe usual crap hollywood produces
, it shoudl be viewed by everyone
. it offers something tothe eveyr memeber ofthe teh audiance
,
anbd ytou owudl alomst certainly nto come outloud disapointed
. overall rating
