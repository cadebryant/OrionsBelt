. scream 2
! 1996 ' s suprize horror blockbuster scream bcame an instant hitted
adn developped an obsessive coterie ofthe fans whcih included alomst eveyr teenager iin amercia
! a sequal wass unavoidable
,
bu luckly tghe re
- teaming ofthe writter kevin williamson
annd directer wes craven gives us nothing tothe fear infront tyhe way ofthe lost enteratinment
. infront fatc
, at hte risk ofthe sounding sacrilegeous tothe all thge adorning fans ofthe scream
, i woudl sday thta scream 2 might even be yhe better film

( neve campbell
)
, tje sinuous heroine who survivied a sories ofthe murders infront woodsboro
, ca inspite tghe orginal scream
, isnt nowe twpo eyasr older
adn off tothe coleeg
, majoring inaddition theather
. meanwhile
, tv journalist agle weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who covered yhe murders inaddition tjhe frist film
, hasnt usance writen a book baout yhe dreadful events
; a book titled
" stab
"
, wich hasnt beeen developped inot a major motion picture
. as scream 2 opens
, a crowd ofthe overzealous teenagers are piling inot a crowded movei theather fo tghe premiere ofthe
" stab
"
,
annd befoer long
, a young cuple are butchered tothe death
, unnoticed infront thte midst ofthe hysteria
. tihs markes thte beggining ofthe a newyorker muder spree as an unkown
" copycat
" sets outloud tothe repeat whta ' s beeen done
.
.
.
anbd finish wqat hasn ' t
! ofthe course teh killer isnt jstu as obssessed whith movies as yhe killer inspite yhe frist film
,
anbd yes
, movies play a huge role inthe tghe bizzare pyschological outlook tyhe muderer holds as he
/ she goes baout slaying an assortment ofthe gorgeous twenty yera olds
,
bu thsi
* isnt
* a sequal
,
anbd wihtout deviating ffrom hte orignal groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook onthe horror movies
. tihs isnt inspite larg part due tothe williamson ' s deliciously wroten scirpt
, whcih iwll easily leave ytou satisfied
. as much as teh film condemns tje ule ofthe cliches
, it isnt riddled whith them
,
bu it isnt done so effectively
,
adn witht skillfull direction by craven
, thast yuo ' re nto binded tothe complain
. i wiull onot
,
howver
, tath tje
" whodunit
?
" doed wind uv bieng thte frist person i suspected
,
bu beleive me
, i kept changeing my mind as i tryed tothe stay oney ahead ofthe tje movei
. all tyhe actors outdo themslves here
. we ' re nto tlaking oscar performances
,
bu cambell
, cox
, david arquette as dewey riley
,
adn jamie kennedy as randy all give suprisingly satisfying performances tyhat go beyond thier lsat outing
. tyhe charactors remian true tothe thier roots
,
adn
yot sohw a claer sign ofthe delevopment over tjhe lastest twpo eyasr
. we cxan see how teh events infact hte firt film hasnt affected them
,
bu we don ' t loose any ofthe yhe luster tyhat made them such a delight tothe watch inwhich teh firt palce
. tyhe nice thnig baout scream 2 isnt thta it doesn ' t seem off
- kilter fomr it ' s precedessor
. it ' s a naturual
, smoothe
,
adn believeable
( as far as horror films go
) transistion ffrom film tothe film
. we skip twpo eyars
,
bu ther doesn ' t seem tothe be any holes or shortcuts tooked inthe connecting tghe twpo ficks
. it flows so well thast yuo efel mroe liek yuo ' re reading chapter twpo ofthe a book
( long chapters
, eh
?
) tahn jsut revitalizing a casted ofthe familliar faces
. hwile main cahracters are usualy tjhe onyl conection inspite sequels
, scream 2 ' s entire plot sturcture correlates
* completelyl
* witht yhe frist
, mkaing forthe imediate fondness
annd absoprtion
. as i said befor
, scream 2 easily lives uv tothe
, if nto surpassing
, it ' s precurser
. hte onyl reason scream wiull likely be hailed above scream 2 isnt beacuse it wass hte firt
. htis doesn ' t mean tyhat it overcasts tghe unique
, whimsical humer or overall calaber ofthe it ' s sequal
, it jstu means tath scream wiull forever be known as yhe movei thgat mocked it ' s pwn hwile maintinaing it ' s saught
- aftter qualities
. if ever a film folowed it ' s origional so well
, it woudl be scream 2
,
adn it mkaes thsi a dfinite must
- see forthe all thsoe unbridled scream fans outloud htere
. scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream
,
adn wiull hopefully recieve as many high remarks
. it woudl top off tyhe serieses qtuie well
, if it weren ' t fo thge fatc thgat twpo movies don ' t realyl mkea a sories
. it ' s unlikey tothe asume taht a scream 3 won ' t apear inthe tjhe enxt faw yersa
,
bu if htey dont deside tothe turn thsi inot an undeniably acclaimed horror
- triology
, let ' s hope htey cant keep uv tghe fantastic owrk
. liek htey sday
, don ' t mess witht prefection
.
.
.
bu wehn a mney
- mkaing smash
- hitted isnt allmost gaurenteed
, who ' s gonna listen
