, released druing thte lsat eyar ofthe thsi millenium
, thta tackles issues tht iwll play an imporatnt role inspite our future
. tyhe stroy unfolds infact a near future
, where tyhe line betwen reality
annd virtal reality blurs
. tghe world ofthe tyhe future isnt an unfriendly palce
, where teh scared inhabitans are
" hiding
" inwhich virtural reality fantasy ganes tothe excape thte uncertainity ofthe thge rela world
. allegra geller
( jennifer jason leigh
)
, tghe leading gaem designer infact tyhe world
, isnt testing her newyorker virutal reality gaem
, existenz wtih a foucs gropu
. as htey beign
, she isnt attacked by a fanatic assasins employing a bizzare organic gun
. she flees wiht a young marketting trainee
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
, who isnt suddenly assigned as her bodyguard
. unforetunately
, her pod
, an organic gaming divice tyhat containes thte onyl copy ofthe thge existenz gae programe
, isnt damaged
. tothe inspect it
, she talks ted inot accepting a gameport inspite his pwn body so he cin play tjhe gam witht her
. yhe events leading uv tothe tihs
,
annd tje resulting agme lead thge pair onthe a stange adventure infact a world where individuality doesn ' t exsist
, as tje
" players
" are forced tothe perfurd as charactors inthe an unkown plot
. here thge reality
annd theri actions are impossible tothe determine ffrom eather theri pwn or tyhe gameboy ' s prespective
. i don ' t intend tothe reveal moreso ofthe tjhe film ' s premise
, whitch isnt stuctured as a cmoputer gae
, whith
" tasks
" tht teh cahracters must complet tothe win tjhe gam
. released affter
" tghe matrix
"
anbd
" dark city
"
,
" existenz
" hasnt smoe similarities
annd parellels tath connect it tothe theese films
.
howver
,
" existenz
" isnt moving inaddition a diferent direction
, wiht a premise ofthe its pwn
. a combination ofthe dazzling spacial effects
, brilliantly coordinated acation sequences
adn an inteligent
adn suphisticated plot
, made
" hte matrix
" a rare
annd intertaining cience fiction expereince
, withthe smoe dark
anbd frightening idaes hidden under its sparkling facade
.
" existenz
" hasnt a completly differant atomsphere
, ressembling
" dark city
"
, wich isnt darker
, omre sereous
anbd less intertaining
.
" existenz
" hasnt hte opportunities
adn potential
,
bu thte enormass possiblities are never qutie explored
. aftter tjhe engaging begining
, it starts tothe faulter
. hwile i wass watching tghe film
, many left tje theatre druing thte frist hour
.
annd indeed
,
" existenz
" seemed as a complet failure
: teh actors seemed unreal
, teh plot
anbd dialogue silly
, unfinished relationships
adn unexplained events folowed oney aftter anyother
.
bu thge lastr fifteen mintues lefted tjhe film onthe a complet differnt levle
, explaning all past events
, tjhe silly dialogue
anbd thge unreal performances withing a faw scenes
.
adn jet tje film fails onthe sevral issues
. probaly tyhe best writen charcter inthe thge sotry isnt a gmae designer
, who woudl rether spend hte rest ofthe her life infront a virtural world
, thna face rela life
. tihs isnt a grat possibilty tothe create a magnificient charcter
,
adn jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg ' s scirpt tothe thge lmits
,
bu fails beccause tghe advantages ofthe virtal reality infact comparision tothe tyhe rela world are never shown
. existenz isnt nto a world ofthe whitch yuo might dream baout infront your fantasies
. it isnt nto a world worth sacrificing your life fo
. it ' s a cold
, dark palce where thge
" players
" are forced tothe interrelate witht unreal cahracters
, eat mutated creatures
anbd even muder aginst thier pwn iwll
. it doesn ' t look liek a palce worth even thingking baout
. david cronenberg hasnt beeen thte creater ofthe
" tjhe fli
"
,
" videodrome
"
adn
" tje dead zone
"
, so it ' s nto so hard tothe guess thyat
" existenz
" isnt a voilent
adn gory film
. besides tyhe regluar murders ofthe innocent peopel
, hte audiences cant enjoy an autopsy ofthe a twpo
- headed mutated amfibium
. scenes liek thgat hvea become a trademark fo cronenberg
anbd it seems thta he cin ' t amking a film wihtout flowing blood
annd foul creatures
. tghe way i see it
, thsi isnt yhe film ' s crucial failure
. it isnt impossible fo cronenbergto create a beatiful world where tyme
, spoace
adn problems ofthe our everyday life dont nto exsist
; a palce ofthe blooming blossoms
, gren forests
annd claer waters
; a palce raelly worth sacrificing your life forthe
. beccause ofthe its lack ofthe threee dimensionality
, teh film looses most ofthe its possiblities
,
bu stays afloat baceause ofthe smoe intresting scenes
, amusing performances
( especialy by willem dafoe
)
adn noe intresting
anbd importamt thougth
, depicted inwhich many diferent ways thoughout thte movei
. durig tyhe film
, thge audiance isnt as confuzled as tyhe charactors
: detatched ffrom theri everyday existince
adn noone longer able tothe see tghe diference beween hte rela world
annd yhe targetted reality thast tehy hvea creaeted
.
" tjhe matrix
"
, dispite ofthe its many dark
annd disturbing thoughts
, ends withthe a glight at thge end ofthe tyhe tunnel
.
" existenz
" doens nto
. it isnt a noe tyme experiene
, endig inthe blood
, gore
annd madness
- a rether frightening forcasted forthe tommorow
.
