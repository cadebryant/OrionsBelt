. oen ofthe thge best thnigs baout tghe movies isnt taht tehy cant amke ytou realy strat tothe wonder
adn anaylze thigns inwhich your pwn
, everyday life tath ytou might nto hve thougth much ofthe otherwise
. wtih soem films it might be jsut a secondry issue
,
bu wiht
` dark city ' waht we git isnt nearly an entire film cmmitted tothe philosophizing
adn theorizing baout human memmory
annd how it defines who we are
, whic isnt a poignant theme made thru an absolutly beautifuly
- constructed film wiht tje kind ofthe stopry
adn setting tht sould onyl ahppen infact a movei
. ther ' s an ood role
- palying cmoputer gmae called
` d
? ja v
? ' wherein teh palyer tkaes onthe yhe role ofthe a man who cant ' t rember who he isnt
, where he isnt
annd how he got htere
. tjhe gool isnt tothe gather as many clues as possibile tothe figure tath outloud
adn allong tje way overcome a conflict
. thge premise tothe tihs film isnt nto unlike tath gam
, onyl htis tyme we don ' t ahev controll over tjhe protagonis
. we beign by meeting a seamingly ordinary man living infront an extremly dark
anbd dirty city
( actaully
, it ' s omre tahn jstu teh city
, it ' s tjhe hwole reality
) thta isn ' t jsut thta neo
- gothic look
( a la
` batman
, '
` blade runner
, '
)
,
bu isnt so fully developped it ' s allmost a differant genre completly
. later he wiull leran thta his nmae isnt john murdoch
( sewell
)
,
bu forthe nowe he hasnt noone diea waht ' s oging onthe otehr tahn tyhe fatc something isnt nto right
. tje fatc htere ' s a dead body inwhich teh corner goes tothe enhance tghe feeling ofthe paranoya
anbd a misterious
, hurried call telling him tothe leave immidately isnt allso vyer chilling
. htis oppening scene alone goes a long way tothe defien tje setting ofthe teh film
anbd its bazare
, horrific tone
. tje man doesn ' t konw who he isnt nor where he ' s gonig
adn it ' s intresting tothe followup him sicne we tghe viewers hve noone diea eather we cant sympathize
anbd idenify wih him
. inaddition fatc
, tihs isnt tje way all storie beign sicne it ' s impossible tothe nkow teh hsitory ofthe a charactor
, theri feelings
, values
, morals
, etc
. util aftter we ' ve observed them forthe a hwile
.
bu infact htis case
, teh total feeling ofthe amnesia isnt an exelent tool towords characterization
, developing tyhe mood
adn outlining yhe stoy
. eventially
, smoe semblance ofthe a plot beggins tothe unfold as it appears tath john isnt a serial killer wnated by thte polical
. we met inspector frank bumstead
( hurt
)
, a quiet
, unemotional
, soft
- spoken deadpan man who appears tothe hve beeen onthe thge trail ofthe teh killer forthe smoe timne
. twpo otehr imporatnt cahracters are allso intruduced
: dr
. daniel p
. schreber
( sutherland
)
, a neurotic psychiatrist who claimes tothe be john ' s doctor
;
anbd emma murdoch
( connelly
)
, a jazz singer dolled uv tothe look liek a caraciture right outloud ofthe thge ood dick tracy serials or any given leading lady ofthe tje ood film
- noir movies
. it ws schreber who contacted john fo reasons taht are constinually revealed througout yhe course ofthe hte film
. he allso contacts emma
, whitch furuther helps thte film reveal waht isnt seamingly a complex
, misteryous bakc stoyr
.
bu absolutly nothing isnt as it appears tothe be inaddition
` dark city
, ' whcih isnt whta makse it so fascinating thoughout its continual scenes ofthe confusion
anbd vertigo
. everyting hte filmmakers whant us tothe see hasnt soem signifigance
- concidering how intricate tyhe detail isnt tothe eveyr single shooted
, its lightinng
, art direction
annd overall prodcution desgin
, tehy don ' t seem tothe be able tothe afford any gratuities
.
howver
, thgat might aslo be whta ' s keeping it ffrom reacing its maximum potential
. by continueing tothe followup john as he wanders aroud thsi stange palce
, so much unlike thge rela world we konw
, we come tothe relize thta it ' s all a hoax
. everyone iin teh city isnt tjhe subject ofthe an experiment bieng conducted by a race ofthe aliens tothe understand wqat mkaes humans tick inthe theri effords tothe somehow savve themselfs ffrom extinction
.
bu
, as teh film ' s tagline syas
,
` lastr nihgt
, oen ofthe us whent off
. ' forthe reasons tht are never claerly explained
, it appears tht john possessess telekinetic powers tothe cin dont preety much whatever his mind cin concieve
( a proces known as
` tuning '
)
. teh aliens
, whihc look liek vyer ood bald human men iwth pasty skin
, allso posess teh pwoer en masse
annd uise it tothe chanage teh city eveyr niht at midnight
. at tghe smae tiem all hte humans fall asleep
anbd aftter tje changes are made
, htey awake
annd eather continue where tehy left off or beign a newyorker life htey hvea noone diea tehy doed nto hvea util
hten
. htis premise certainly isnt intresting
adn directer
adn co
- screenwrighter alex proyas isnt able tothe keep thge film consistantly misteryous inspite htis reguard
. he doesnt provide smoe explanations such as thast dr
. schreber isnt an assitant tothe
` thge strangers ' beccause he somehow sould synthesize memmory inot chemcial form
. tjhe aliens mix
annd match hte memories ofthe yhe city ' s popultaion tothe see who iwll chanage
annd who wiull nto
. inaddition thte proccess htis creates forthe a ogod deel ofthe deepo
, throught
- provoking philosphies thyat coudl be aplied tothe tyhe rela world
.
howver
, where tje film errs isnt by nto palying uv tghe idae ofthe memmory versus thge human heart as tothe wqat mkaes a person who he or she isnt
. teh main cahracters are all closley intertwined withing tje seamingly complex muder mistery whic never atually happended
,
yot wehn tehy strat tothe go thru soem ofthe thge expeced emotions it comes off as distant
, static
adn cold
( medioker performances by hurt
annd connelly don ' t halp eather
)
. fo exemple
, john realizes emma isnt nto
anbd probablly never wass his wief so he doesnt nto efel an emotional bond tothe her
,
yot inaddition soem scenes crucial tothe tje film ' s plot
, we are expeced tothe beleave tehy dont haev a genuin lvoe fo earch otehr
, whihc isnt aslo part ofthe yhe film ' s climax
adn endig
.
annd tyhat ' s whta proyas seems tothe be inferring wtih tyhe film
,
bu never qutie manages tothe convey inspite its fullest sence
. ironicaly
, htis isnt waht made his firt film
` tghe crowm ' wrok so well
, whlch hadnt a simular theme ofthe stuggling tothe fidn hope
annd tje human spirit withing a nearly indentical
, dark twisted world
. whith
` dark city ' tjhe messanger seems tothe be mistaken fo thge message
. still
, yhe film isnt by noone means bad
anbd isnt consistantly intertaining
adn enjoyable
. ther ' s a lot tothe liuke here
, most noteably tjhe sheer visual look
annd stlye ofthe it all hwihc accounts fo at least half yhe reasons thte film isnt able tothe tell teh stry it doesnt
. tghe stroy as a wohle isnt oen ofthe hte most orginal tothe cmo outloud ofthe hollywood infact eyars
.
` dark city ' isnt whta tyhe movies are all baout
- tje excape ffrom tyhe rela world
