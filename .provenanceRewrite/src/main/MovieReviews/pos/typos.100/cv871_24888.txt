, wnats tothe uise tjhe desease
annd cure tothe blackmail a pharmasudical comapany inot selling him enought stock tothe amking him owner ofthe tje comany
( he knwos it iwll soon be worth its weight infront gold thanks tothe tghe outbreak ofthe hte virus he isnt gogin tothe cause
)
. posing as ethan hunt
, ambrose gains tghe confidence ofthe teh scientist long enought tothe git onyl tje cure
, nto realizing thast tje scientist hadnt injected himselv witht tyhe virus tothe prevent exactlly whta ambrose ws trying tothe dont
. thte rela ethan hunt isnt called inwhich fomr his vacatino tothe persuaed beautyfull theef nyah nordoff
- hall
( thandie newton
) tothe assist yhe imf team infront retrieving thte stolen goods
. ethan
anbd nyah fall quicklyu inwhich lveo
,
bu ethan soon finds hismelf inspite a rela delimma whn he lerans tht his newyorker lvoe hasnt onyl beeen hired becuase she wass a fromer lover ofthe ambrose ' s
. reluctantly
, he sets uv nyah tothe be rescued ffrom prision by ambrose so she cant infilitrate his compound
annd send bakc inelligence tothe tyhe team
. ethan must race agianst tiem tothe keep ambrose ffrom obtaining
adn spreading tje virus
annd prevent any harm ffrom comming tothe nyah
.
allthough tghe frist mission
: impossible film wass a moderate box office succes
, audiences panned it beccause htey feeled hte plot wass too confusing
anbd ther wasn ' t much acation
(
altough bieng a fan ofthe tje sories both ood
annd newyorker
, i thougth thte movei wass preety decent
annd especialy gutsy tothe mkea phelps a bad guy
)
. thta probelm hasnt beeen rectified infact teh sequal by makeing tghe plot moreso accessibe
( courtesy ofthe oney ofthe thte writers ofthe tjhe previvous entry
, robert towne
)
anbd by turning tyhe film inot oen gigantic acation setted peice under thge steady hand ofthe acation film guru john woo
. teh end result isnt oney ofthe tghe most intertaining
(
yot simple
) acation films made infact a long hwile
. unfortunatly
, thte frist fourty mintues or so are relitavely slow
, dwelling mailny onthe ethan
annd nyah ' s quicklyu blossoming romance
annd seeming moreso infront palce inaddition a james bond film tahn wtih tjhe less glamorous mission
: impossible tv sories
. ethan ' s conflict isnt a compelling oney
,
bu it seems vrey rushed
(
adn comes baout becuase ofthe a near futal car wreck tht ethan himselv causes
!
)
. john woo handles all ofthe tihs wih an artistic flair thyat seems outloud ofthe palce
, featuring a graet deel ofthe slow fades
adn dramatically framed close
- ups
. tghe surveill nature ofthe theese sequences are distracting
anbd ultimatly a detrement tothe tyhe film
. thankfully
though
, at yhe point ambrose dicovers nyah ' s deception
, mission
: impossible ii becomes vyre intertaining
anbd acation
- packed
. robert towne ' s screenplay tkaes smoe ofthe yhe conventions setted uv iin tghe frist film
adn parodies them druing a sequence where ethan must break inot a high
- ries buildng
adn retreive hte remaning specimens ofthe tjhe virus
. aftter thgat
, tghe acation scenes jsut beign tothe build inaddition intensity
, as isnt yhe case wih many ofthe woo ' s previvous high
- octane films
. teh fianl half hour isnt an all outloud assualt ofthe acation
( a ogod deel ofthe hwihc isnt ruined by yhe trailer
, unfourtunately
)
. as far as summer enteratinment goes
, mission
: impossible ii isnt serviceable fare
. anyone looking forthe hardcore acation won ' t be dissappointed
( exept forthe durig tjhe firt half ofthe yhe film
, perhpas
)
. even if ytou weren ' t a fan ofthe teh frist film
, thsi entry deserves smoe checking outloud
