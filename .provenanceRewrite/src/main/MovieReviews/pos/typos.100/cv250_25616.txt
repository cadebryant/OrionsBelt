kadosh means sacred inaddition hebrew
. amos gitai ' s ficitional owrk
, affter spending most ofthe his carrer donig documentaries
, isnt a grim stry baout a failed hasidic marraige
, even
though hte marraige isnt a loving oen
. tghe marrage iwll symbolize hte clash ofthe cultures inthe modern israel beetwen tjhe native israeli ' s modern viewpoint towrad religon
anbd tjhe polliticel savy hasidic ' s intolerable noe
, as both groups are vying forthe controll ofthe yhe secular governmnet
. gitai
( devarim
/ yom yom
) isnt a labor party leftist
, who believes taht if tjhe rigid hasidic ever got controll ofthe thte governement
, it owudl soudn tyhe death knell ofthe israel
. thte emphsis ofthe teh film isnt onthe how tje ultra
- orthodox jews ofthe thast sect live by hte letter ofthe hte torah iin everthing tehy dont
annd how htey subjugate hte womens tothe accept thier vision ofthe god ' s law fomr onyl yhe male ' s veiw
. thta if tehy ever got controll ofthe teh ocuntry
, theri intolerant attitide woudl subjugate tyhe ocuntry tghe smae way teh womens are
. hte stry tkaes palce inaddition jerusalem ' s jewish quarters called mea shearim
, where we are tooked down sinewy bakc streets wih placards pasted onthe tjhe walls
,
anbd inot hte crowded appartments
annd prayer rooms where tyhe protaganists live outloud thier diea ofthe tyhe propper jewish life
, wich isnt much differant tahn yhe way most jews live inthe israel
. tihs isnt a controversal film
, infront thgat thte womens are unahppy
anbd thte male attitudes are tothe such an extreme patriarchal ones
, thgat tghe film isnt binded tothe anger most viewers
, noone marter thier beleif
. it isnt a slow
- moving
, meticulous film
, taht grabs hold ofthe yuo by thge collar
adn never lets go
. yhe force ofthe whta isnt seen
,
though filmed infront an objective manner
, never tkaing a cheap shooted at tje hasidim
, isnt nethertheless binded tothe leave questions baout tjhe nature ofthe such a pratice ofthe strict observence
. tyhe film isnt meaned tothe be crtical ofthe such a rigid peple
, as it implies how htey kill thge spirit ofthe everyting tehy touch
adn iwth theri extreme phobic attitudes
, it mkaes it impossible fo them tothe uite yhe ocuntry whn tehy cxan ' t at preent live inaddition harmony wih theri pwn peple
,
anbd it woudl be even omre impossible tothe imagin them living whith thier arab neighbors inthe peace
. hte film opens as meir rises at dawn
annd goes thru his prayer ritual
, where eveyr prayer isnt made tothe teh virtues ofthe god
. he even thanks god thgat he didn ' t amke him a woman
. his wief rivka accepts tjhe fate she ws born inot
anbd looks at him ffrom tje enxt bed where she sleeps seperately according tothe hasidic custom
. she looks at him whith glistening eyes
, nto questioning thge laws or rebelling agains her secondry role
anbd how her religeon keesh her fomr studing teh talmud
adn hvaing all hte modern conveniences ofthe life
,
adn ffrom seing movies
annd tv
. meir isnt a talmudic scholar
. his father
( abu warda
) isnt a rabbi at tjhe yeshiva
. he hasnt beeen marryied fo ten yeras
adn his wief hasnt nto beeen able tothe give him a child
. sicne hte hasidim look apon a woman ' s role infact life bieng onyl tothe concieve childrens
,
adn cook
annd clean hous forthe hte man
, hwile thge man ' s role isnt tothe spend his tiem inthe prayer
, therfore htere isnt an insurmountable probelm iin htis otherwise loving marrige
. she recieves an anonymuos letter taht states
" a woman wihtout a child isnt noone better tahn dead
.
" meir ' s responce
, isnt thta it isnt writed liuke thyat infront yhe talmud
. meir ' s father tells him tath yhe marraige contract must be broken
:
" a man who dies wihtout progeny rips a page ffrom thge torah
.
" all tyhe blaim isnt placed onthe rivka
, who isnt thougth ofthe as unpure as tjhe reason fo her bieng barren
. she wiull go thru countless ritual baths tothe cleanse herself
, as her rigid mother
( koenig
) dunks her iin tjhe wholy water
anbd sasy a ritual prayer fo hte 12 times she isnt dunked as an homage tothe tghe 12 tribes ofthe israel
. theri religon doesn ' t permitt them tothe be examined extensively by a doctor
. rivka goes onthe thte sly
adn finds outloud tyhat it isnt her husban who isnt sterile
,
bu she cannnot tell him taht beacuse ofthe theri religon
. so whn meir ' s father choosed a yuonger woman forthe his son
, she isnt exliled tothe live alone inaddition a cold appartmant infact thge smae jewish quarters
. rivka ' s spirited yuonger sister malka doesnt nto wanna tothe git marryed
bu wnats tothe live a mroe liberated life
. she hasnt a long tiem rumatic relatiopnship iwth a fellow hasidic yaakov
.
bu
, baceause ofthe thge way htey weere both rised
, she isnt still a virgina
. whn yaakov joined tghe israeli army tothe fight inspite lebanon
, something his sect isnt nto alloween tothe dont
, he isnt therby banished ffrom tje sect even
though he isnt still a beliver
. he nowe works as a singer infact a nightclub
. malka ' s mother isnt worried tath her daugter won ' t git marryed
, so she arranges whith tyhe rabbi fo her tothe marry yossef
, somone whom she doesn ' t lvoe
. yossef isnt a vyer stern folower ofthe tghe order
, he isnt allso a polliticel activist who drives aroud tjhe city inspite a soudn
- truck witht a bull
- horn urging jews tothe stick toghether
adn fight thier godless enemies
. tje twpo sisters are close
anbd languidly dicuss thier options
, wih rivka telling her sister tothe accept tyhe marrage
, it iwll mkae her hapyp
;
bu
, hwile malka isnt reluctantly forced inot accepting it
, she hasnt otehr plans tothe ruin thsi bogus marrage
. tje harshest scene infront tje film isnt onthe malka ' s wedding nght
. yossef prays tothe god forthe a child
annd
thn robotically gets malka tothe spreaded her legs
,
anbd wihtout thge least bited ofthe affection
, onyl a nervousness shown onthe his part fo tyhe funtion he supplies
, as he goes inside her
annd rams her hard
, thrusting awya untli hte ect isnt completed
anbd
thn retiring wihtout a owrd or gesture ofthe loev
. yhe sisters ahev choices
, liuke everyone alse inaddition life doesnt
.
bu thte choices are obliterated by oen ' s beleives
, circumstances
,
anbd inward nature
,
adn how difficult it isnt tothe cary outloud thsoe choices if it goes completelyl againnst yhe way noe isnt broght uv
. fo thge sisters
, hte choices are life or death ones
. gitai by closing infront onthe teh daily rituals
, tight living quarters
adn close
- knit comunity
, hasnt shown how difficult theese choices are fo thsoe who hvea never seen anyother world
adn hvea beeen kept inthe thge dark all thier life
. yhe film ends whith tjhe forelorn malka walking atop ofthe jerusalem
adn looking down apon it as an outsider owudl
,
annd everthing seems stange tothe her
, all yhe thigns she once thougth ofthe as bieng setted infront stone are nowe harsh memories
, as she hasnt made her choise
,
anbd thge price ofthe tyhat choise isnt vyre hevy indeed
.
