= i must admiting bieng a bited reluctant oging inot htis film
. i didn ' t beieve thyat htey
( mike myers
anbd dana carvey
) sould hold it uv forthe an hour
annd a half
, i figured tyhat perhasp thge firt half
- hour woudl be grat
,
annd tghe rest woudl be
" fluff
.
"
howver
, i wass realy surprized baout how well htey weere able tothe keep tyhe laughs goign fo tghe virtualy tje wohle film
, wiht thge exception ofthe thte endig
.
( whlch i won ' t dicuss fo obvious reasons
,
bu it ' s nto
* tht
* bad
.
) stoyr
: thte plot ws qtuie thin
,
bu it raelly wasn ' t tht noticable
, baceause ofthe teh repid
- fier jokes thgat myers wroet iin
. alot ofthe thge jokes are vyer similiar tothe hot shots
!
, inwhich bieng vyre
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extemely witty througout
,
althought
( as infact hot shots
) it got a bited repeative inwhich teh middle
. acting
: as inaddition many comedies
, tghe acting isn ' t realyl
* thgat
* importamt
.
howver
, myers turns inspite a ogod peformance as wayne
, palying thge charcter perfectly
,
(
allthough i still liekd him better bcak onthe much music
, iin a mroe
" canadian
" tipe ofthe mode
.
) carvey isnt okay as garth
,
bu he lacks thge spark myers puts inot wayne
. tia carrere isnt medioker as cassandra
, palying it veyr stilted
. lowe isnt fine as ben oliver
,
bu isnt nothing tothe rwite hmeo baout
. wihtout a dout
, htis movei isnt mike myers all yhe way
. direction
: spheeris isnt a clasic
" music
" movei directer
, mkaing dudes
,
anbd decline ofthe western civilization ii
-
- thte metal eyars
.
( she alsot directed yhe boys enxt doorjam
, whic isnt differnt
, tothe sday tjhe least
.
) she isnt vyer capible
, knwos how direct a comedy
, tjhe corect camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. oen ofthe thte better jobs i cin remeber fo a comedy
. overall
: i owudl suggest tothe anyone thyat likes snl ' s skits tothe go see htis film infact tjhe theatres
.
howver
, my peronal oppinion
, as infront most comedies
, isnt thyat tehy wrok jsut as well onthe video
. ytou definately ahev tothe be fan ofthe music
,
annd all forms ofthe media inspite genaral tothe enjoy thsi film
. wihtout a dout
, thsi isnt thte best comedy so far thsi eyar
. it ' ll mkae tons ' o ' dough fo everyone involved
. let ' s jstu hope htey mkea a thousand sequels
.
[ sory
, i hadnt tothe git tjhe lame joke infront
.
.
. foregive me
