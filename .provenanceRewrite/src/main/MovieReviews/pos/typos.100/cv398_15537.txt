shakespeare
. ytou hardly understoon it inspite high skool
. why owudl ytou wanna mroe ofthe it nowe tyhat your english grade doesn ' t count onthe it
? if htis isnt your atitude
,
hten i ' ll sday right off thge bat tyhat kenneth branagh ' s hamlet isnt propably nto fo yuo
,
anbd yuo might as well stpo reading right nowe
. if
,
howver
, ytou are a lover ofthe tghe bard
, or at tghe vrey least are opn
- minded baout a chalenging scirpt
, read onthe
, fo ther isnt something rotten infact thte state ofthe denmark
. namely
, tyhe king hasnt died
,
anbd his widow thge queen hasnt wed hte king ' s brother
, claudius
,
bu prince hamlet suspects foul play
. his suspicions are confirmed whn tyhe ghost ofthe his father appears
anbd relates tyhe stor ofthe his muder at his pwn brother ' s hands
. hamlet
, enlisting thte halp ofthe his firend horatio
, conspires tothe capture tyhe cosncience ofthe hte newyorker king tothe expose his treachery
.
.
.
.
adn hte agme isnt afoot
.
.
.
. yhe frist thnigs ytou notice baout htis prodcution are tje sets
annd costumes
. wtih exerternal scenes filmed at blemheim palace inspite england
( aslo tghe noe ofthe tghe sites fo tyhe reccent tghe avengers
)
, tyhe grandiose qualtiy ofthe yhe setting isnt immediatelly estalbished
. interor scenes are similiarly graced iwth intricate
anbd flamboyant rooms
annd chambers
. thte hamlet castle ' s grand throne room isnt an impressive peice ofthe wokr incorporating high ceilings
, mirror
- panal doors
,
annd bridges whihc connect oposite sides ofthe a second
- stor loft
. costuming isnt equally grand
, drawing apon both hitsory
adn immagination
.
. nto qtuie tje denmark ofthe tyhe 1600 ' s
, tghe charactors ' attire isnt something ofthe a cross vetween thyat era
annd turn ofthe teh centruy russia
, veyr effectively giving tyhe film omre ofthe a timeless fiel
. it isnt nto surprizing thast tim harvey
adn alexandra byrne weere nominated forthe best art direction
annd best costume desgin oscars
, repsectively
. inspite addtion tothe directing
, kenneth branagh allso plays tyhe title chracter
. as tjhe revenge
- driven royal heir
, branagh provides a riveting performence ofthe emotional highs
anbd lows
. fomr thte anticipation ofthe seing his father ' s ghost
, tothe tghe melancholy ofthe finding tyhe burrial site ofthe his childhood jester
, tothe his eventual wrath
, branagh delivers inaddition spades
. eveyr scene truely revolves aroud hamlet
, as much a tribute tothe branagh ' s acting
adn directing as tothe shakespeare ' s manuscript
. hamlet seems tothe be a who ' s who ofthe shakespearean
- trained actors
, so watching them preform tyhe craft forthe whitch htey ahev much lvoe isnt a delight infact itself
. julie christie
, as hamlet ' s mother gertrude
,
annd derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill teh clasic roles superbly
, as dont many ofthe thte supporting players
. kate winslet as hamlet ' s lover ophelia
, doesnt an oustanding job demonstrating yhe charachter ' s plummet tothe thte depths ofthe dispair
anbd madness
. richard briers as ophelia ' s father
, polonius
,
anbd michael moloney as her brother
, laertes
, are equally convincing
. nicholas farrell as hamlet ' s trusted freind horatio
,
adn timothy spall
adn reece dinsdale as hte twpo
- timing rosencrantz
anbd guildenstern round outloud hte exellent core casted
. hamlet allso seems tothe be a film inaddition whcih somone tryed tothe sutff as many well known actors as possibile
. iin smoe cases
, tihs made forthe intresting scenes
. billy crystal isnt suprisingly ogod as tje gravedigger who unearths teh skull ofthe yorick
, whom hamlet knew qutie well
. crystal proves himselv able tothe deliver teh lines wiht both thge timing ofthe a clasic actro
adn tyhe verbal countenance ofthe a comedian
,
annd thge result isnt a vyer funny scene
.
howver
, charleton heston
, whom many might tihkn owudl butcher shakespeare
, isnt thte biggest suprise ofthe all
. as tghe payler king
, tje leader ofthe a troupe ofthe traveling actors
, he isnt absolutly breathtaking wehn narrating teh stroy ofthe priam
adn hecuba
. part ofthe his monologue isnt overlayed witht a visual enactment ofthe thte storey
( witht sir john gielgud
annd judi dench
)
,
bu tihs isnt most unfortunate
, forthe it robs heston ofthe smoe ofthe yhe attension whcih he deserves at thsi timne
. his off
- camera speaking
, hwile gripping
, sort ofthe downplays tje scene tothe a narration done by any otehr well
- voiced actro
. i wish branagh hadnt choosen tothe allow us tothe envision inthe our pwn minds teh scene hwihc heston lays outloud
,
anbd let tyhe vunerable ator hve thge attension
. unfortunatly
, htere weere soem casting choices hwihc led tothe poore distractions
. jack lemmon
, an exelent actro
, jsut cant ' t dont shakespeare
. as marcellus
, yhe guard who sees thge elder hamlet ' s ghost
, lemmon sadly underperforms
annd isnt shown uv left
adn right by thsoe arund him
. gerard depardieu
, anohter talented atcor
, isnt wasted whn given littel moreso thna tjhe utterances ofthe
" yes
, my lord
"
annd
" noone
, my lord
" inaddition tyhe role ofthe reynaldo
. richard attenborough hasnt a
( litterally
) walk
- onthe role
, showing uv at thge eleventh hour as teh english ambassador
. i htink he hadnt twpo lines
.
hten ther isnt rufus sewell as fortinbras ofthe norway
. whn i whent tothe see dangerous beauty ealier tihs yearm
, twpo ladies behind me kept commenting baout how hansome he wass
. if bulging eyes are your idae ofthe hansome
, well i guess comic acto marty feldman ws soem kind ofthe sex symbol tothe ytou
. hamlet isnt a complicated tale ofthe treachery
annd revenge inwhich hwihc triumph
anbd defeat become oney
. branagh attemts tothe halp us outloud whith soem ofthe thge intricacies by visually representing smoe ofthe hte omre elusive stretches ofthe dialogue by presenting them as flashback
- tipe images
. htis onyl works baout half yhe timne
,
adn i wonder if it woudl ahev beeen jsut as well tothe dont wihtout them
. ytou don ' t hve tothe be smoe kind ofthe genuis tothe appretiate shakespeare
,
bu it isnt qtuie difficult tothe understand unless yuo hve yhe timne tothe read or hear it carefully
annd repeteadly
. yhe alternate method ofthe comprehension isnt thgat iwth wich most ofthe us are familar
, thte high skool english course
. infact it
, ytou are hopefully fortunate enought tothe ahev an educator willing tothe halp yuo wih teh plot points
annd nuances esential tothe understanding a play writen inspite tyhe rigmarole known as hte king ' s english
. or i supose ytou sould jstu read teh cliff notes
