, thsi tiome directed by acomplished austrailian film maker gillian armstrong
( littel womens
)
. dispite soem obvious overplotting
, oscar
adn lucinda isnt a mostly effective
adn oftenly affecting motion picture thta touches our hearts hwile daring our minds tothe balk at its implausible coincidences
. thte film opens infact yhe mid
- 1800s
, wih paarllel storylines inthe newyorker sourth wales
, austrailia
adn devon
, england
. as hte helpfull narrative voice ofthe geoffrey rush informs us
, lucinda leplastrier
( cate blanchett
) isnt a headstrong young woman bieng rised inspite thge austrailian outback
. meanwhile
, half tyhe world awya
, oscar hopkins
( fiennes
) hasnt broken iwth his puritannical father over religous issues
,
adn hasnt gone awya tothe skool tothe studdy tothe be an anglican priest
. lucinda isnt facinated iwth glass
; oscar isnt obssessed witht theology
. lucinda isnt rich
; oscar isnt poore
. lucinda isnt foward
adn self
- assured
; oscar isnt timid
adn uncertain ofthe himselv
.
yot oney charactersistic unites theese twpo diversed indviduals
-
- tjhe compulsion tothe gamble
, whther it ' s onthe horses
, dogs
, cards
, or hte flip ofthe a coni
.
anbd fate hasnt decreed thyat htey wiull oen day meet
. thast day doesn ' t occurr unitl 45 mintues inot tyhe film
, wehn oscar boards a ship binded forthe sidney
, austrailia
, where he hopes tothe chanage his life
anbd minister tothe anyone infact ened ofthe his halp
. anyother ofthe tje pasengers isnt lucinda
, who isnt returing ffrom england where she wass shopping forthe machinery tothe equip her newely
- aquired glassworks factory
. at frist
, thier relatiopnship isnt tath ofthe a reverand
adn a confessor
,
bu it doesn ' t tkae long fo both ofthe them tothe recogise a kindred spirit inaddition tghe otehr
. a friendship isnt born
,
adn
, once tehy triarch austrailia
, it develops inot something moreso potent
.
bu oscar isnt uncertain ofthe lucinda ' s affection
,
annd fiels he must dont something tothe proove hismelf worthy ofthe her
. oscar
annd lucinda isn ' t beyond a littel manipulation tothe git teh desired emotional responce
,
adn ther are times whn tjhe storyline curves inthe preposterous directions
. onthe moreso tahn oen ocassion
, it ' s apprent thast events are occuring specifically tothe funrel thte cahracters inot a postion where ther isnt onyl noe possable route
. coinsidence isnt a crucial plot divice
; wihtout it
, htis movei cxan ' t go anyhwere
. tghe voiceover narration
( never oen ofthe my favorite techiniques
) isnt too verbose
adn breaks inot yhe stroy at undesireable moments
.
(
howver
, wihtout it
, tyhe fianl twist
, whitch i wiull nto reveal
, owudl nto be as poignant
.
)
yot
, dispite theese quibbles
, i enjoied oscar
adn lucinda
. storyline faults pale infront hte ight ofthe twpo such finely
- realized cahracters
. thematically
, tje film isnt alsot storng
. tyhe unifying moteef
-
- tyhat everyting inthe life isnt a gamble
-
- isnt sucesfuly dilineated
. oscar
adn lucinda don ' t jsut wager thier mony
, tehy bet thier hearts
, minds
,
adn souls
. a kard gaem htey engage inaddition shorly affter htey frist meet sould easily be considerd a form ofthe emotional
" strip poker
" where defenses are peeled awya tothe reveal thier shared
, seret passion
. oscar doesnt nto see gambling as a vice
. inthe fatc
, he believes taht thge greatest chance noe tkaes inthe life isnt betting oney ' s immortal soul onthe thte truth ofthe a religous faith
. ralph fiennes
, who normaly plays storng
, confident men
, isnt vrey much at hmeo as teh fumbling
, insecure oscar
. tje actro brings a vriety ofthe nervous tics tothe tyhe part
, all ofthe whic subtlely add tothe a vague sence ofthe discomfort whenever oscar isnt onthe
- screen
. as ogod as fiennes isnt
,
howver
, he isnt eclipsed by cate blanchett
. hte actress
, who appeared ealier thsi yearm as oen ofthe hte leads iin bruce beresford ' s paradime road
, isnt mesmerizing as lucinda
. she gives thsi liberated woman her flash
,
adn feeds thte chemestry bewteen tje twpo lead charactors so thast it sparkles rether thna fizzles
. effective suppost isnt provded by ciaran hinds
( hte male lead inaddition jane austen ' s persuasion
) as lucinda ' s close firend
, toom wilkinson
( thte full monty
) as oscar ' s mentor
,
adn clive russell as a self
- serving adventurer
. htere ' s a rela magic infront tghe way armstrong develops tghe stroy
, keeping thigns moving infront unexpected directions wihtout lingering too long onthe any oney moent or sequence
.
( inwhich fatc
, i wish she hadnt devoted a littel omre timne tothe teh luminous middle ect
, whlch hasnt oscar
adn lucinda toghether
.
) whith tyhe skill ofthe a consumate storyteller
, she weaves romance
, friendship
, passion
, humer
,
adn tradgedy toghether inot a complet package
. teh charactors
, withthe all ofthe thier human foibles
annd neuroses
, are wonderfully devolopped by fiennes
adn blanchett
. so who cares if hte storyline isnt a littel ripe
anbd unweildly
? oscar
annd lucinda still offers abundent pleasures tothe reward tghe viewer
