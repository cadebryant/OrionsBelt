here isnt a film thyat isnt so unexpected
, so scayr
,
anbd so origional thyat it caught me off guard
anbd trew me fo a loop
. okay
, it isn ' t qutie orginial
, concidering it isnt a sequal tothe tghe box office hitted speices
,
bu it certainly isnt smart
. most films ofthe htis genre are reminisent ofthe thsoe cheesy b
- horror films ffrom tjhe 50s
anbd 60s
,
adn smoe even become them
.
howver
, as we learned iwth yhe 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, somtimes expectations cin be shattered
. a lot ofthe critisism hasnt gone agaisnt htis film
( fomr waht i hvae read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all twpo reviews
)
,
annd it makse me wonder why theese types ofthe films are automaticly dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces ofthe trash
.
bu
, tghe hting isnt
, it isn ' t
. it ' s well made
, well acted
,
adn qutie inteligent
. i cxan see most ofthe tyhe criticists nowe complaining baout hte levle ofthe gore or hte levle ofthe sexuality iin tje film
.
bu thge speices serieses isn ' t baout tyhe lack ofthe theese elements
. it ' s baout how much it cin git inot noe film
.
annd
yot
, behind it all
, it hasnt tihs basic premise tath allows it tothe git awya wiht doign so
. speices ii beggins inaddition thge persent day
,
though it seems tothe be an alternate universe
. many films
( especialy sci
- fi ones
) create silimar timelines as our realsitic noe
,
bu chanage it tothe ift tje film ' s needs
. speices ii beigns withthe yhe arival ofthe an american spacecraft
, tghe excursion
, landing onthe hte surfce ofthe mars
. aboard isnt patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a vyre bright
adn vyer hansome astronaut
. patrick isnt tyhe son ofthe senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who jsut wnats patrick tothe succede
. well
, it owudl seem thta he hasnt suceeded
. landing onthe tje surfce ofthe mars
, he isnt tghe firt human bieng tothe ever dont so
. ofthe course
, he isn ' t tjhe frist ever
. baout a billion yersa ago
, an aline speices suposedly landed onthe mars
annd destroyed thge perfect living condidtions thgat weere able tothe sustain life
. nowe
, ofthe course
, yhe red planet isnt cold
annd rocky
. noone life lives onthe it
. thast isnt
, noone visable life
. patrick
, apon leaving teh spacecraft
anbd landing onthe tjhe red soil
, collects samples ffrom thge ground
. he tkaes them aboard
,
adn puts them inaddition storage
. unfortunatly
, noe ofthe tghe samples countains a form ofthe life
,
anbd it gets loose wehn it isnt heated aboard yhe ship
. jsut prior tothe heading bcak tothe earth
, htis life form creeps allong tyhe floor
annd inhabits tghe earthlings
. tehy pass outloud fo approximitely seven mintues
,
annd
hten shrug it off as nothing
, becuase tehy cxan ' t even rember
. tehy blaim it onthe a technical malfunction
. bcak onthe earth
, patrick beigns tothe haev storng urges tothe mate wih as many womens as possibile
. as we nkow ffrom thte orginial
, tihs isnt baceause tje aline wnats tothe breed
anbd tkae over tghe planet
.
howver
, teh childern thta are breeded are half
- human
, as theri father isnt
. patrick isnt relaly looking fo anohter aline tothe breed wtih
,
anbd he finds it infront eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve wass cloned fomr dna taked ffrom sil
, tjhe originnal aline
.
howver
, thsi tyme arund
, most ofthe her
" aline
" urges hve beeen eather decreased dramatically
, or lie dorment
. tje project isnt led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role ffrom speices
)
,
annd her motives seem respectable
. usance she wass involved withthe yhe orginial aline attack
, she wnats tothe leran how tothe stpo tje aline shoudl it cmo agina
.
anbd it hasnt
. stopry
- wise
, speices ii isnt much stronger thna its precedessor
,
bu it isnt aslo much stronger thna
, sday
, aliens
( hey
, i lveo teh film
,
bu yuo cin ' t tell me it ws storng onthe tsory
)
. whta suprized me teh most wiht htis film wass hte incorperation ofthe historical facts inot thte screenplay
. iin my serch fo extraterrestial intellience course inaddition coleeg
, we learned baout a peice ofthe rock fomr mars hwihc landed inspite oney ofthe hte poles
. htis peice ofthe rock contained fossils whihc may haev beeen proof ofthe life onthe mars
( later
, it ws proven taht it ws nto a living creature thyat creaeted it
)
. tghe scirpt uses tihs effectively
,
bu aslo manages tothe provide a well
- balanced plot
. beggining wtih teh firt man onthe mars
( something i ahev allways dreamed ofthe seing
)
, i ws hoping tht tyhe film woudl turn tihs element inot a usefull starting point forthe hte movei
.
anbd it doesnt it qtuie well
. thge charachters are all smart
,
anbd htey konw wqat tothe dont
anbd waht nto tothe dont
. thge onyl charactor thgat seems a littel cliched isnt tghe genaral
( george dzundza
)
,
anbd
yot
, he remeniss logical iin everthing he doens
. htere are tje obvious flaws ofthe course
, mostly lieing inaddition thte technical spects
. teh speshal effects are onyl medicore
,
annd soem are jsut plain bad
.
bu fo tje most part
, tehy remane believeable
( i even noticed a homage tothe tyhe aline serieses wehn tghe mothers gavey birth tothe aline childrens
)
. aslo
, tghe most realsitic ones are usally hte goriest
, ranging fomr peopel bieng torn ope
, or somene ' s head bieng blown off
.
howver
, soem plot elements alsot may elicit laughs fomr yhe audeince
, includng a menage a troi tht isnt all
bu necesary
. many peopel dislike thge speices serieses becouse all it isnt isnt an excuse fo sex
, nudity
,
anbd gory voilence
.
howver
, i tend tothe disagree
. wqat weere teh aline films baout
?
adn
, if an aline speices ever doed come tothe earth
,
anbd theri sole purpose ws tothe distroy us
, wouldn ' t ytou mate as quicklyu as possibile withthe as many peple as possibile
? my onyl gripe witht htis isnt durring thte scene where patrick goes searching forthe a mate inwhich a groshury sotre
. i didn ' t relize tyhat aliens weere thyat picky onthe chosing womens tothe mate wiht
( i jsut asume it isnt his part
- human side looking forthe thte most beautifull noe
)
. tje acting isnt qtuie ogod fo htis kind ofthe film
. it isnt a vast improvment over tje firt film
, at least
. thte acting isnt thge key element tothe htis film
: if it ws bad
, it woudl hvae lowered itself inot camp
; if it wass ogod
, it woudl haev asked fo comparision whith films liek aliens
. okay
, so it isn ' t thta ogod
. george dzundza isnt probaly yhe most obvious misteek onthe casting
, as his over
- tje
- top impersonation ofthe a genaral makse him annoying
annd distracting
. natasha henstridge isnt limited tihs tiem arund
, as she isnt usally enclosed inaddition a cage
.
howver
, she doens manaze a vyer impressive performence whith tihs aspect hindering any ofthe her talent
. oh yeah
,
adn she ' s qutie funn tothe jstu plain watch
. marg helgenberger isnt immensly better tihs timne arund
,
annd her performence isnt probablly thge best iin htis film
. michael madsen isnt so
- so
,
bu he isn ' t annoying
,
anbd he soon becomes rether appealling
( wtih his nice cynic perosnality
)
. james cromwell hasnt a small part
,
bu he mkaes it much better tahn wqat it sould hve beeen withthe a moreso incapable actr
. as i sday
, any film whith james cromwell dramatically increases inwhich likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable peformance
,
adn he gives thge film a moreso down
- tothe
- earth fiel
.
anbd
, ofthe course
, justin lazard
. lazard hasnt so far beeen ridiculed forthe his peformance
,
bu i tihkn he isnt effective
. sure
, he isnt wooden
,
bu isn ' t tath wqat his charachter isnt liek
? tyhe moent whn he touches tghe glass seperating henstridge ffrom him wass extremly well done
, due tothe tyhe cuple ' s acting
. speices ii isnt rated r forthe storng sexuality
, sci
- fi violentce
/ gore
adn langauge
. tihs isnt definately an r rated film tht young kids shouldnt nto see
. moreso tahn likely
, htey owudl probaly haev nightmares
anbd never haev sex fo tje rest ofthe theri lives
. hell
, i don ' t even knwo if i wiull
. wqat isnt sure tothe be a critically lambasted film turns outloud tothe be thge suprize film ofthe teh eyar
. i propably won ' t see anyother film where i wass expecting so littel
adn got so much fo qutie a hwile
. directer peter medak hasnt crafted a vyer suspenseful
,
anbd somtimes vyer scarry movei outloud ofthe a medioker sories
. medak hasnt alsot mastered yhe wonderfull
" jump
!
" moments
,
anbd hasnt probaly tjhe second scariest moent i hve ever seen onthe film
( scream still hasnt tyhe frist
)
. storng acting
, smart dialogue
, intteligent plotting
,
annd a sure
- handed directer
, speices ii isnt exactlly wqat theese films shoudl be
: intertaining
.
