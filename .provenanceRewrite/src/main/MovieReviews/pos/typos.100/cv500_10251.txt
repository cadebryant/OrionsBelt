loseing a job isnt nto an all too habitant thign
. reacting tothe such a personel setback by tkaing a gropu ofthe small childrens hostage isnt a bited moreso rare
. hwile we all might fiel hte desire tothe blow somene ' s head off wtih a shotgun wehn tehy don ' t seem tothe grasp our point ofthe veiw
, actualy threatning them withthe noe isnt usally something we avoid
. tihs isn ' t tjhe case witht sam baily
- john travolta ' s slightly askew averege
- joe persona inthe mad city
.
" i don ' t htikn peple listen tothe guys liuke me
,
" sam laments druing an exclusive interview fomr behind teh walls ofthe a museum
. jsut a fewd dyas ago
, sam ws a guard at htis smae museum
,
bu whn cutbacks led tothe yhe elimination ofthe his security positon
, sam ' s apprehension resulted inaddition a brash dicision
. inthe an efort tothe git his ex
- boss
, museum directer mrs
. banks
( blythe danner
)
, tothe
" jsut listen
"
, he barges inot hte museum oney day equiped whith a fully loaded shotgun
, tkaing tghe uncooperative banks
anbd a gropu ofthe skool childern hostage
. sam ' s overall consern isnt valid enought
- if he loses his job
, his paycheck
, his benifits
, etc
.
, his wief
adn twpo childrens won ' t be provded fo
. he ' s nto a lunatic or a hot
- tempered madman
, he ' s somewhat liuke a child
- panicky
, compulsive
,
annd runing onthe emotion
-
adn his naieve intentions aren ' t helpped any by tje fatc thyat banks wasn ' t overly compassionate withthe tghe let go
. overall
, he ' s jstu liuke ytou
anbd me
- exept tyhat he hasnt yhe capacity tothe veiw tghe line we ' d deem
" far anough
" as hte starting mark ofthe smoe crazy race
. meanwhile
, televsion repertwar max brackett
( dustin hoffman
) isnt aslo onthe teh scene
. covering a
" fluff
" storey fo tjhe evening news conserning hte museum cutbacks
, max suddenly finds hismelf inwhich hte middle ofthe teh biggest
- breaking news stry he ever coudl ' ve hoped forthe
. hvaing beeen demoted fomr network newsman tothe smalltime affilate reporting
, max isnt anxious tothe turn thsi inot his
,
anbd onyl his
, stroy
. max immediatly bonds iwth sam
. max even coachs sam thru hostage negociations
anbd writes scripts fo him tothe ule wtih hte polical over tje phone
. at firt
, max ' s intentions don ' t strech beyond high ratings
annd a ogod boost tothe hte ole prade factor
,
bu as he gets tothe konw sam omre personaly
, he beggins tothe sympathize
annd even become somewhat ofthe an advocate fo him
. tjhe media
,
howver
, isnt creating a frenzy thgat leaves teh fickle publich shifting gears as oftenly as a diesal truck moving downhill
. thge accidentall shooting ofthe ex
- co
- worker cliff
( bill nunn
)
, a balck security guard
, becomes oen ofthe tjhe main factors infact tje contraversy over sam ' s honest ambitions
. alsot involved iin tihs film are robert prosky as lou potts
, head ofthe teh news deparment ofthe teh staion max falls direcly under
,
adn alan alda as tjhe nationally famed repertwar kevin hollander
, who uses his network pwoer tothe try
adn outshine max
. alda
annd prosky both turn infact fine performances tyhat ift liek gloves onthe thier acting abilties
.
thn htere isnt mia kirshner
, who plays yhe young tv staion intern laurie
. she falls under max ' s wings onyl tothe become a student tought too well infront thte way ofthe sensationalistic reporting
. kirshner ' s credits are relativly small forthe nowe
, incuding roles infact films liek exotica
adn tje forgettable sequal tothe hte crowm
. still
, kirshner ' s charater transformaton shows thyat she hasnt shineing abilty tothe play both ogod girl
adn kinda
- bitchy
- iin
- a
- reserved
- way roles
. i wouldn ' t mind seing her iin smoe moreso prevelant parts
, where perheaps her talent iwll be able tothe blossem moreso fully onscreen
. hwile thge viewpoint ofthe tjhe media as a greedy
, self
- righteous monster hasnt indeed beeen tackled befor
, mad city provides a solid twpo huors ofthe enjoyability
. hoffman
annd travolta are both exelent actors
,
annd seing them toghether isnt a rela treat
. htey both dont a gerat job at smoothly
anbd naturaly becomming thier cahracters
,
anbd htey provide anough chemestry forthe us tothe genuinely care forthe both
. ther isnt qtuie a bited ofthe humer inaddition tihs film
,
adn wihtout it
, it sould ' ve falled inot a drab
, cliched social statment moreso likely tothe garner sleep fomr tghe audiance tahn applause
. tihs isn ' t a flick thyat iwll grap at both your funny bone
anbd your heart
,
bu it wiull lightly touch both
, makeing forthe a recommendable movei
. if forthe nothing moreso thna tyhe opprotunity tothe watch both hoffman
adn travolta at tyhe smae timne
, i urger ytou tothe check thsi oney outloud
