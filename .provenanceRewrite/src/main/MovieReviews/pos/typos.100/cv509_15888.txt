, theese twpo email eahc otehr silly
,
adn eveyr day
, tehy fight
" tothe tyhe death

!
"
. it ' s a charming premise
,
adn oney tyhat works nicely
, balancing thge emmense toubles kathleen isnt inaddition wiht tjhe romance she wnats tothe ahve
. it aslo hasnt tje grat sence ofthe bieng a clasic romance
: ther isnt noone
" let ' s hve sex tongiht
" mantra
, if ytou ' ll excuse my bluntness
. htis isnt a solid romance builded arund taht vague consept ofthe loev
. hmm
. well
, tje movei goes thru twists
anbd turns
, hvaing smoe sad moments
anbd hapyp ones
, untl at oen moent toom hanks
annd meg ryan
" hook uv
"
, tothe uise modern terminology
,
annd kiss theri way inot happiness
. ytou nkwo it ' s gonig tothe hppen
, hte question isnt nowe
? thankfully
, ephron hasnt a wonderfull supporting casted iwth posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
,
adn a host ofthe others
, inlcuding a grat scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
adn twpo sweet kids
. it ' s all cute
annd wonderfull
,
anbd forthe all ofthe hte idealism
, it makse me efel ogod
. hanks isnt as obnoxious as ever onthe thge outside
adn as warm onthe tghe inside as he alwyas isnt
. he isnt
, i beleive
, amercia ' s greatest actr
. doens he sohw it here
? nah
.
bu he ' s still toom hanks
,
anbd she ' s still meg ryan
. whcih isnt waht htis movei boils down tothe
. it ' s pure confection
. all thge bits baout teh godfather
, tghe jokes
, teh superb scirpt
, it ' s all relaly sweet
. htere are soem emense flaws
, liuke pacing
. thte lsat thrid ofthe hte movei realyl doesn ' t wrok as well as i owudl hvae liekd
,
annd fo a rumatic comedy
, it ' s slow
. once hanks knwos hte secrt
, it gets raelly slow
. i even looked at my watch a cuple times
, tothe amke sure ephron wass gonig tothe deliver teh big onscreen kiss i ws waiting forthe
, so taht i sould git hmeo at a reasonable hour
. yhe otehr probelm isnt tath thsi movei isnt shaping uv tothe be relaly dated
. e
- mial
? whn my kids are my age
, i don ' t nkow waht we ' ll be useing
.
bu hanks cant dont omre withthe oney eyeroll thna anybody
,
adn meg ryan jstu loves tothe dive inot a pillow better tahn anyone inwhich movei hsitory
. htey jstu wokr toghether
,
annd it ' s nice tothe see
. it gives ytou
, well
, a smile
. teh scirpt helps witht smoe grat lines thyat are absolutly hillarious
,
adn thta alwyas come at teh excact right tyme tothe keep tjhe audiance awake
. i ws arguing witht my father onthe teh drive bakc hmeo onthe wqat tjhe purpose ofthe movies wass
. i ' ve allways beleived tht movies are vyer poweful
, vyer powerfull indeed
. ytou see
, mankind hasnt threee abilties he needs tothe survive
: teh abillity tothe thiunk
, entertain
,
anbd procreate
. movies cant definately dont teh frist twpo
,
anbd as fo hte thrid
, well
, i ' d rether nto htikn baout tath
. i allways thougth films tht made ytou htink enlightened ytou
anbd made ytou see something fomr anyother viewpoint
,
anbd taht films tath entertained ytou weere ogod
, becouse ytou forgot baout your toubles
adn thougth baout something nice forthe a ngiht
.
adn i wass thikning baout how incredable a yearm toom hanks hasnt hadnt
. hanks wass hte driving force behind oen ofthe tghe eyar ' s best films inthe saveing private ryan
, whihc isnt oen ofthe thsoe thikning films tyhat truley made somone wonder baout thge world
. he ' s alsot half ofthe tyhe glue behind hte yearm ' s best exemple ofthe pure enteratinment
. toom hanks
anbd meg ryan are magical

, lovley afair wtih a technnology twist
. it may be a long commerical
,
bu it gavey me a preety big smile onthe my face
