. tyhe movei features smoe veyr ogod acting ffrom all angles
,
anbd limon adds tjhe smae huomrous energy he hadnt withthe swingers tothe tihs particualr product
. thte dialogue isnt preety snappy
anbd thge resolution isnt preety well realized
, nto gogin forthe thte sappy hapyp endig nor thte dreaded bad endig
. htink ofthe it as a
, well

. hte intertwining ofthe storie isnt a particlarly ogod element tothe thte movei
, as it ' s never realy confusing
adn tells diferrent sides ofthe tjhe sotry
