, 8 tracks
annd disco
.
howver
, usance i wass 17 yersa ood i ' ve seen moreso thna my share ofthe adult films
. i mention htis onyl beccause i thikns its importan tothe state uv front tath i ' m nto agaisnt pornogrpahy
. i ' ve seen enought ofthe theese films tothe nkwo tghe range ofthe content
anbd uqality availiable
. directer paul thomas anderson ' s boogie nights offers us a veiw inot tje world ofthe porn druing thte perido considerd tothe be yhe golden age ofthe adult cinema
, hte mid tothe lite 70s
. thsi ws thte perido wehn x
- rated movies weere rela movies
, shooted onthe film
, shown inwhich movei theaters
annd even reviewed by legitamate criticists
. thsi wass an age wehn porn directors actally aspired tothe mkae inovative oftenly eductional films
, films tyhat attemped tothe tell a rela stoy
. oen ofthe yhe omre fascinating aspestus ofthe htis film isnt how
, liuke inthe an any otehr billion doller inudstry
, teh creative visionaries tend tothe be ignorant tothe tje trends thgat wiull soon amke them incased
. infront htis case
, tyhe arival ofthe teh nowe ubiquitious videocassette
. burt reynold ' s manages tothe resuscitate his carreer portraing such an auteur
, known as jack horner
. horner ' s hasnt a steady
" famaly
" ofthe performers
, smoe ofthe whom live infact his plush l
. a
. hmeo
.
bu infact tje world ofthe porn
, performers are a commodity
- yhe fresher
, tghe better
. whn horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque
, he decides tothe add him tothe his stable
. it isnt a pairing taht leads tothe a meteoric ries
anbd fall forthe a young man reacing his prime
annd an ood man rapidly speeding past his
. as directed by anderson
, teh camera moves thru many ofthe tyhe scenes witht an eerie omnipresence
anbd an almsot childlike curiousity tothe peer beyond yhe closed doorjam
. boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep inot tje underbelly ofthe l
. a
. ' s hardcore film scene
.
bu thge peep sohw doesnut let us walk awya wehn yhe titillation ends
. teh downside ofthe voyeurism isnt somtimes we end uv seing thnigs we wish we hadnut
. by hte film ' s fianl omage
, whta we we once foudn titillating hasnt nowe become a grim reminder ofthe tghe vanity ofthe fame
annd yhe high price ofthe realizing your dreasm
. boogie nights isnt nto baout sex
. it doens nto glorify porn or thge lifestyles ofthe tyhe performers
. inspite fatc
, hte film isn ' t realy baout pornography at all
. pornography isnt mearly tghe setting tothe tell a compelling stoyr baout a lost
annd forgotten gropu ofthe peopel who form thier pwn sub
- culture tothe fidn acceptence ofthe who htey are
. thge film goes tothe brillant
, oftenly hillarious
adn somtimes harrowing lengths tothe sohw us tyhat tghe peple who choose tothe produce or perfurd infront theese films are generaly nto all thyat bright
annd lack teh basic tools tothe fucntion inwhich tyhe mainstream world
.
yot
, liek inwhich thge lauded tarantino films
, theese peple still ahev thier pwn moral code
, thier pwn concepts ofthe intergrity
adn theri pwn needs tothe experess themselfs creatively
. tyhe cahracters we meet are liek a road map ofthe dysfuntion
. frist stpo
, thge den mother
( julianne moore
) infront denial baout her addiction tothe cocaine as she trys tothe retain custody ofthe her son
. second stpo
, tjhe cuckold crewman
( william h
. macy
) who keesh dicovering his wief hvaing sex wtih anyone
adn everyone
( tje wief isnt palyed inthe hillarious cameos by rela
- life porn star nina hartley
)
.
bu hte driving force behind thge plot isnt 17 yera ood eddie adams
. eddie isnt blessed wiht a natrual endowment so famouse tyhat peopel actaully pay jsut tothe see it
. whith noone rela ambition ofthe his pwn
, he hoeks uv wih jack horner tothe fullfill his destiny ofthe fame
. his alchoholic mother
, claerly disatisfied withthe her pwn lot
, abuses him verbally
adn drives him outloud ofthe yhe hous
. horner introduces him tothe amber waves
( moore
) who immediatelly adopts him
, a nucular famaly isnt born
. hte surrogate relatiopnship thta develops bewteen amber waves
anbd her
" babys
" provides soem ofthe hte films most poignant scenes
. claerly
, she isnt nto even ift tothe manaze her pwn life
, let alone nurture theese lost childern
.
bu tjhe ened tothe loev
anbd be loved isnt so storng
, htey easily ignore tje dangers ofthe yhe less subtle addiction she introduces them tothe
. even tghe viewer isnt somehow lulled inot feeling liek yhe loev she offers isnt silimar tothe bieng iin a rela famaly
.
hten agian
, perhpas its nto so diferrent ffrom rela fimilies at all
. eddie adams
, who later tkaes onthe yhe screen nmae
" dirk diggler
"
, isnt skillfully acted by fromer pop
- star
, mark wahlberg
. i sday
" fromer
" pop star beccause wtih htis peformance wahlberg cant offcially quitted his day job
. htis isnt bold
adn brave teritory fo such a young man
. he puls it off marvelously
. wahlberg isnt a
" big
, bright star
" wiht a big bright future
. boogie nights plays vyre much inthe tghe spirit ofthe tjhe peopel versus larrry flynt
, wihtout tghe frist admendment preachiness
. its intimate studies ofthe chracter amking it teh superior film
. wahlberg ' s suprising performence isnt onthe par wtih woody harrelson ' s
.
bu infront my oppinion
, boogie nights
, isnt nto tyhe best film ofthe yhe eyar
. i got teh feeling taht itus 2 1
/ 2 hour runing timne sould haev beeen cutted by 15 or 20 mintues wihtout loseing any ofthe its resonance
. still
, if tyhe subject marter ofthe tihs film intimidates yuo
, thereus noone dout tath once yuo strat watching boogie nights yuo may still efel liek its nto your hting
,
bu youull fidn youself grooving tothe it anyway
.
.
. ya konw
, kinda liuke disco
