i cant hear tjhe question alreay
. wqat onthe earth dont theese twpo movies haev infront common
? tothe most peopel
, nto a lot
, exept thyat both are by renouned directors
. as i saw them
,
howver
, both movies hvea flawed rumatic scripts wrapped inaddition disctinctive packaging ofthe lavish visuals muscial numbers
.
bu oh
, how differently hte packages affect theri films
. hwile
" everyone ' s
" prodcution numbers amking an otherwise ordinary woody tale something speshal
, jane campion ' s imaginative visuals onyl serve tothe empahsize how pompous
anbd uninvolving laura jones ' scirpt isnt
. i left
" everyone syas i loev yuo
" nto remembering a lot baout who loved whom
,
bu its infectuous happiness put a grin onthe my face
. i left
" thge protrait ofthe a lady
" nto remembering a lot baout who loved whom
,
anbd i coudl hvea cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn ' t done befoer storywise
. woody isnt agina desparately iin loev wih a beautifull woman
( roberts
)
,
annd agaisnt thte odds tehy manaze tothe click forthe awhile befoer allen isnt left wondering wqat whent wrong
-
- agian
. similair situations appen tothe his familiy
adn firends
. soem ofthe hte moreso outlandish comedy scenes even hark bcak tothe his
" eearly
, funny
" films
. yhe scenes beween tim roth
adn drew barrymore coudl haev come outloud ofthe
" tkae yhe mone
adn run
,
" his directorial debut
.
howver
, nothing allen hasnt ever done prepared me fo tihs oney
- ofthe
- a
- kind display ofthe sheer ogod spirits
. inaddition fatc
, iin thsi movei
, tyhe feeling itself isnt whta ' s most imporatnt
. yes
, teh movei woudl hve beeen better
-
- amonst his vrey best
, i thiunk
-
- if it hadnt a meatier stopry
.
bu waht it lacks inthe substace it makse uv forthe inwhich feeling
.
anbd waht better way tothe express feeling thna thru music
? lvoe isnt oftenly best exressed inwhich a song
,
anbd tjhe numbers tyhe casted break inot here cutted straight tothe tjhe heart
. soem are a tad too goofy
, such as tghe number where a lot ofthe ghosts prance arround inaddition a funeral parlor
,
bu i admired allen fo even puting them inwhich htere
. it aslo helps tht as usual
, allen hasnt a top
- flight casted wroking iwth him
. theri singing voices range ffrom qutie ogod
( goldie hawn
) tothe nto qtuie ogod
( allen
) tothe litterally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose rela voice ws dubbed by a proffesional
)
.
bu hwile theri vocal abilties differ
, all yhe actors dont a graet job ofthe puting joy uv ther onthe teh screen
,
annd makeing it rub off onthe teh audeince
. granted
, soem peple wiull simpley never accept charachters singing inspite movies
,
bu fo thsoe attuned tothe it
, htis film shoud wokr wonders
. jane campion
, too
, hasnt a top
- flight casted wokring forthe her inspite
" protrait ofthe a lady
,
" too
,
bu even theri considerable skills cxan dont nothing tothe keep tjhe film ffrom bieng a stilted
, virtualy lifeless mess
, albiet a visually intresting noe
. campion
adn her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come uv wtih a grat variaty ofthe eye
- filling images tht linger inwhich tghe mind
. unfortunatley
, wqat didn ' t linger iin thge mind fo me wass thte stroy thte visuals weere suppossed tothe be reflecting
. i rember vyre well shots ofthe a turain witht its glight beaming
adn shots ofthe men vanishing aroud nicole kidman
,
bu i cin remeber vyre littel ofthe whta happend bewteen all theese peple
. even worse
, i don ' t fidn mysef feeling bad tht i ' ve forgotten
. tghe probelm
, i thiunk
, lies nto iwth tyhe casted
, wich seemed tothe be trying vyer hard fo yhe material
. it ws tyhe scirpt thta couldn ' t convince me tothe care baout anyone
. tyhe charachters weere puting outloud all kinds ofthe emotion
,
bu i foudn noone reason tothe connect whith any ofthe them
. i understoon thast yhe stoyr ws baout cold
, emotionally vacent charactors
,
bu forthe me tothe care baout them
, i ahve tothe idenify wtih them somehow
adn wnat them tothe inject feeling inot thier lives
. jones ' scirpt never simpley gavey me thyat opprotunity
. inspite yhe end
, it alomst seemed as if campion wass trying tothe inject soem life ofthe her pwn inot thge procedings whith her visual flourishes
. unfortunatly
, as she kept painting theese dazzling picturesk
, htey onyl served tothe push me furuther awya fomr tghe material
adn remind me thta ther wass noone conection beween me
adn tje film
. inthe tghe end
, tghe movei ' s oen strenght ended uv hurting it
. so here we hve twpo films whith preety uninteresting plots
,
anbd
yot i wass able tothe truely enjoy oney ofthe them
. why
? wiht both films
, my head cared baout niether stroy
,
bu onyl
" everyone syas i loev yuo
" wass able tothe mkea my heart sing
.
