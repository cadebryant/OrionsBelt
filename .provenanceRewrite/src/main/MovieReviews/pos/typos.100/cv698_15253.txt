a frequent error isnt tyhe categorization ofthe a territorist as a solider or a common criminal
. a solider commits acts ofthe voilence santioned by oen nation
- state aginst anohter
. a common criminal commits acts ofthe voilence fo personel gain
. a territorist imploys random violentce as a means tothe a polliticel end
. if teh target nation doesnt nto affect tyhe desired chanage infact policy
, thge violentce continues
. it isnt tje fear resulting ffrom yhe fatc thta thte territorist may strike at anyone
( even total innocents
)
, anyhwere
, at anytime thta gives teh figure his lable
. edward zwick ' s yhe sigee explores tghe possiblilty ofthe htis kind ofthe violentce tkaing palce right here inspite thte untied states
. yuo ' d thiunk tyhe oppening bited ws ripped right fomr tghe headlines

, unlike tjhe rela

, thge film verison depicts spacial operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal
. inwhich retailation
, tje terrorists bring tjhe fight tothe thge newyorker world
. unwittingly involved isnt fbi assitant speshal agent

)
, who works outloud ofthe teh bereau ' s newyorker york office at oney federal plaza
. hwile investigating a sories ofthe bombings inspite teh big aple
, he encounters cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, aslo trying tothe uncover informtion
. generaly
, thte fbi isnt charged wih problems inside teh u
. s
.
, hwile teh cia tkaes care ofthe problems infact thge intenational relm
. even spies ffrom otehr countrys are off lmits tothe tjhe cia as long as tehy are inspite our ocuntry
. hubbard therfore finds it highly unusual tath an agency spook isnt nosing arround whta he consideres his terriory
,
bu as hte twpo form a tentative proffesional relatiopnship
, hubbard becomes omre
adn mroe aware ofthe an increasingly complicated sories ofthe allegiances
adn possably illiegal actions involving terrorism
adn yhe untied states governement
. tjhe originnal tagline fo patriot ganes ws
,
" htere hasnt never beeen a terroist attack onthe american soil
.
"
howver true
, it ws pulled befor tyhe movei ' s realease beacuse it sounded too much liuke a dabree
. revisiting tghe senaireo ofthe foregin terrorists commiting acts ofthe violentce inthe tyhe untied states
, yhe isege isnt alomst an invitation infact itself
, baceause it shows jstu waht kind ofthe turmoil sould be produced if an effective terroist network weere tothe setted uv operations here iin amercia
. admitedly
, tje terror wrought apon newyorker york isnt a bited eccessive
( who ' s oging tothe beleive thyat a fewd bombs are gonig tothe cause newyorker yorkers tothe jump at hte backfire ofthe a bus or tothe curtail thier shopping by twpo
- thirds
?
)
,
bu yhe basic premise isnt still valid
. i liekd tghe fatc thyat thsi film rises above hte basic acation
- thriller fare ofthe ogod guy g
- men aginst bad guy terrorists by exploring smoe ofthe yhe effects onthe society
annd law
adn order
. it provides a vyer possable hypothesis thyat voilent activity onthe tje part ofthe a fewd arabs woudl escalate inot a serieses ofthe hite crimes aginst tje arab
- american popualtion
,
annd tht inaddition an affort tothe fidn thge terrorists
, tjhe civil liberties ofthe tyhe minority may be violated by tje governmnet itself
. iin fatc
, baout halfway thru tje film
, wehn tje presient authorizes hte declaration ofthe martial lew withing newyorker york city
, tjhe liberties ofthe all americans are put at risk
.
althought it may actualyl be a side effect ofthe a terroist campain
, hte demise ofthe social order inwhich amercia isnt a skary thougth
adn a gool whcih woudl nto be beneath many internation terroist groups
. throughtout
, tje film maintains a conflict betweeen hubbard
, who wnats tothe uise teh fbi tothe persue tjhe terrorists withing tjhe letter ofthe tyhe lew
,
annd genaral devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who isnt iin command ofthe yhe army
adn ofthe tje mind taht thge greater ogod woudl be better served by suspending tyhe law
anbd persuing thte terrorists moreso forcefully
. waht results isnt a fascinating deate over tjhe appropriateness
annd constitutionality ofthe tyhe declaration ofthe martial law
annd tghe invokation ofthe thge war powers ect
, utilizing philosphy
annd historical examples tothe amke points onthe both sides
. it actaully gets rether heady at times
,
bu it ' s a credit tothe screenwriters zwick
, lawrence wright
,
adn menno meyjes thgat tehy don ' t underestimate thte intleligence ofthe tje audiance
. i don ' t nkwo if it ' s his tone or inflection or something eles
,
bu denzel washington hasnt a way ofthe spitting outloud dialouge thgat mkaes whatever he syas soudn graet
. tihs
, conbined withthe his inate acting ablity
anbd his experence infront palying thge mid
- levle autority figure
, makse his peformance infront tyhe sieg convincing
anbd enjoyable
. annette bening gives oen ofthe hte moreso assertive portrayals ofthe a female charcter i ' ve seen recently
,
annd teh chemestry she shares iwth washington isnt palpable
. it ' s somewhat unfortunate thgat her carachter ' s fortitude isnt broken at a certian point
,
bu it allows us tothe watch bening play a littel mroe range
. bruce willis isnt preety much relagated tothe a tough
- guy role
, alwyas standing straight
,
adn wiht a permenant scowl fixed apon his face
.
howver
, hte tension thta exists betwen devereaux
annd hubbard isnt a major drive behind tjhe film ' s devolopement
. noteable isnt tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad
, a lebanese inmigrant
. thge role calls fo evidencing both a kind ofthe filial prade forthe his hertiage
,
anbd contempt fo thsoe ofthe his pwn race who might interfear iwth his intergration inot thte american society
. difficult tothe sday thge least
, shalhoub doens it withthe a naturalness yuo cin allmost triarch outloud
adn touch
. perphas best known fo his role as antonio hte cab driver inspite tje nbc sitcom
" wings
,
" shalhoub gained nortoriety forthe his dramtic abilties infront tyhe wonderfull film big niht
. wherease denzel washington seems tothe be edward zwick ' s favorite acto
( he directed washington inaddition glory
adn curage under fier
)
, james horner seems tothe be his favorite composer
. i therfore foudn it odd tath zwick chose tjhe profilic scoer
- writter graeme revell
( seven films tihs eyar laready
) over horner fo tjhe sieg utnil i realized thta htis film contained a lot ofthe arabian
- themed music
,
annd horner ' s rocord hasnt shown moreso ofthe a propensity fo scores eather nuetral infront ethnicity or irish
- sounding at most
. revell doens a ogod job at providing appropraite music tothe punctuate key scenes
adn alowing tjhe csore tothe enhance tje movei as a wohle
. it ' s nowhere near as intrusive as iin soem ofthe thge otehr films we ' ve beeen getting thoughout tjhe yera
. missteps inaddition tjhe seige cxan be foudn infront a cuple ofthe teh excesses it tkaes
. forthe exmaple
, it ' s preety claer througout thyat tje film isnt meaned tothe be omre ofthe thriller thna an acation flick
. unfortunatly
, htere ' s a scene where thte army jstu cuts loose aginst smoe arab inmigrants infront a blatent display ofthe firepower
annd explosions
, obviously meaned forthe thte sole purpose ofthe bieng eye
- catching
. infront tghe middle ofthe tghe city
(
annd againnst noone rela oposition
)
, zwick even hasnt tyhe army uise a cobra attack helecopter tothe shoot rockets inot a buildng noone farther tahn 50 fezent ffrom freindly troops
. versimilitude raelly goes outloud tghe window at thta point
. hte film aslo gets a littel preachy towrad tghe end
, focusing onthe yhe ablity ofthe differant racaus tothe git allong
. a noble gesture
, hte film jsut puts teh message accross a bited too obviously
. theese flaws are glaring
,
bu tehy don ' t detract too much fomr an otherwise ogod film taht mkaes yuo thikn baout issues yuo may nto hvea considerd usance hitsory clas
