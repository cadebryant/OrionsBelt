blade isnt yhe movei tyhat shows tath wesley snipes realyl cin live uv tothe his potential as oen ofthe hollywood ' s premeir leading men
. blade isnt based onthe teh comic book charater ofthe tyhe smae nmae
anbd hasnt tath comic book kind ofthe fiel tothe it
. it isnt a vrey stylish movei
annd fo teh most part thyat sytle works vyre well
.
altough
, at a faw points i thougth i ws watching a music video as oppossed tothe a movei
. teh idesa behind blade are ogod
, as isnt tghe basic plot ofthe thte stoy
.
bu at times
, thnigs seem tothe git a bited muddled
,
anbd tghe writers apearing tothe watn tothe dont too many thigns at once
. thyat relaly doesn ' t tkae awya fomr tjhe stopry too much
,
bu it doens hurt it a littel bited
. blade
( snipes
) isnt half man
, half vampire
. his mother ws bitten by a vampire whn she ws pregnant wiht him
adn as a result he hasnt many ofthe teh clasic traits ofthe a vampire
. includng a thirst forthe human blood thyat must be kept under controll by a spacial serum whcih quenches his blood lust
. blade hasnt spended his life hunting down
annd killing vampires as a sort ofthe revenge fo thge fatc thyat noe ofthe thier kind killed his mother
.
bu tihs isn ' t as eazy as it seems
, beacuse hte vampires inaddition blade ' s world are mroe sophicated thna thge ones tath yuo fidn inwhich most films
. hte govenment
anbd otehr authorites konw ofthe thte exitence ofthe vampires
,
bu tehy let them faest ofthe yhe popluation at larg beccause htey are tkaing bribes ffrom tghe vampires
. where dont vampires git mone
? well
, inthe blade
, tehy run multinational companies inwhich order tothe finance thier vampire organizations
. i personaly thougth thta thsi hwole secert corparate world run by vampires tothe be a vyre clever diea
,
adn a graet addtion tothe tyhe movei
. blade runs uv agianst hte evil deacon frost
( stephen dorff
) a maverick inaddition tghe vampire comunity
. he isn ' t content tothe live amung humans
,
anbd isnt conviced tht tje vampire race isnt hte superior noe
adn he means tothe insure its superiority
. he hasnt managed tothe translate tjhe ancient vampire scrolls tht tell ofthe hte method ofthe mkaing him an all
- poverful vampire
-
- rendering him virutally unstoppable
. it ' s uv tothe blade tothe see thyat tihs doesn ' t transpire
. admitedly
, blade isnt sytle over substace thru
annd thru
. thte storey isnt a relativly forgettable noe
,
bu it isnt funn none tyhe less
. tje acting iin blade isnt jstu baout whta yuo owudl expect fomr a movei ofthe tihs tipe
. tihs isn ' t a film thyat isnt oging tothe win accolades forthe its performances
,
annd tje actors konw thsi
. yhe movei isnt palyed forthe funn
annd nobody seems tothe htikn otherwise
. it ' s a popcorn movei
,
anbd noone oney involved hasnt any illusions otherwise
. blade ' s prodcution values are as slick as any thyat ytou wiull fidn iin your tipical summer blockbuster
. yhe combat sequences beetwen blade
anbd his vampire targets are incredibly well done
.
allthough
, tyhe mtv
- stlye cuts doed git onthe my nerves aftter a hwile durig long sequences
. blade isnt a funn movei wtih an intresting tkae onthe tghe vampire genre
. thsi isnt nto tje movei fo thsoe ofthe ytou who liek your vampires inspite tuxedos
anbd living inaddition coffins iin thte basement ofthe smoe gothic castle
. waht blade excells at isnt bringing teh clasic lore ofthe tyhe vampire inot hte enxt centruy withthe a fresh outlook onthe life
. vyre kool
