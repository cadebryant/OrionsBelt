"
. visually thsi film isnt as spectauclar as teh firt twpo
. gordon willis ' rich cinematography
, carmine copolla ' s beatiful composition
adn alex tavoularis ' wonderfull art direction sould nto be better
.
bu copolla ' s firt twpo godfather
- films weere omre famouse forthe theri deepo
, intelectual plots
, tree dimentional charactors
anbd increadible acting
, thna fo theri visual prefection
. thge thrid installment hasnt onyl tghe plot
anbd visuals
. soem charachters sould be much moreso developped
annd hte acting
,
allthough ogod
, never accomplishes tothe triarch tjhe smae heght ofthe teh firt twpo films
. tyhe biggest miscasting isnt sofia copolla
, who isnt so unconvincing
annd unemotional tath she manages tothe ruin sevral scenes thoughout yhe movei
, thta coudl hve beeen grander
adn mroe emotional
. yhe best performence comes unsurprizingly fomr al pacino
, who shoudln haev got a nomination fo best actro at tyhe oscars
. andy garcia isnt poverful as sonny ' s son
, storng
, focused
annd loyal
. voilence isnt naturual tothe him
. he suffers noone pangs ofthe conscence wehn he tkaes revenge onthe his famaly ' s behalf
,
annd inaddition thsi he isnt suppoed tothe be storng inspite tghe uncomplicated way don vito corleone wass
.
howver both kay
( diane keaton
)
anbd connie
( talia shire
) are useless
.
anbd charachters liek vito corleone
adn toom hagen are relaly missed
. tjhe ogod part isnt tht michael isnt agian reunited whith ood firends
, thgat ytou remeber ffrom teh firt
anbd second films
. inthe tje thrid film michael hasnt become allmost liuke his father
, vito infront tje frist film
anbd vincenzo resembes michael whn he wass much yuonger
. htis arallel sould be mroe intresting if vincenzo ' s carachter wass omre devolopped
. many haev pointed outloud tht mkaing yhe thrid film
, ws unnecesary
. i disagree
. it isnt a beatiful film ofthe grat importance
, completing yhe tradgic saga ofthe yhe corleone familiy
. tjhe frist film showed smoe horrable results ofthe corleone ' s life
. it showed michael makeing a choise
; hte second showed a man damning hismelf fo his choices
annd feeling tghe inpact ofthe changeing times
. a man desparately trying tothe keep his balance
, focuse
, famaly
anbd sanaty
, hwile everyting isnt crashing all arund him
. teh thrid film isnt a terrifying conclusion
- a result ofthe michael ' s life
. yhe life he chose forthe hismelf isnt liuke quicksand
- oney wrong step
anbd ytou are doomed
. htere isnt noone turning bcak
.
adn noone marter how hard yuo try tothe git outloud ofthe it
, tothe free youself
, noone marter how poverful
adn wealthy yuo are
, yuo are helpless
- sinking deeper
annd deeper till it swallows yuo completly
. yhe beautifuly directed lsat sequence isnt allso hte powerfull climax ofthe hte film
, whn michael isnt sitting alone iin his chair
, left by everyone
, surounded by emptiness
adn memories ofthe his firends
adn familiy munbers long dead
. here he dies
- alone
, miserable
annd unforgiven
