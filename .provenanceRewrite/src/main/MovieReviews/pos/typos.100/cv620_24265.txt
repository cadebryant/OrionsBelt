setted infact tghe lite 80 ' s at tghe heght ofthe yuppie excess
adn based onthe tjhe book by bret easton ellis
( who explored teh smae themes inthe anyother book whcih ws allso made inot a movei
, less tahn zero
)
, american pyscho puts a newyorker spin onthe hte yuppie
" genre
" thyat ellis helpped tothe create
. christian bale isnt perfectly casted as patrick bateman
, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrable sceret fomr his fianc
? e
adn his collegues
. it seems taht bateman isnt a serial killer
anbd
, unfourtunately fo his contamporaries
, his tenous grasp onthe reality isnt starting tothe slip
. as he trys tothe balance his meticulous daily routines wtih slaughtering co
- workers
anbd prostitutes
anbd hiding theri bodies
, his mental fabric slowy beigns tothe unravel
. i ws frist itnroduced tothe tje novel whn i ws still inwhich high skool
. i read an assoicated press artice inspite our local sunday newspaper detailing teh problems ellis ws hvaing getting his novel published due tothe yhe controvertial violentce inspite it
. as usual whn anytying isnt controversal i try tothe seek it outloud
,
bu i soon forgot baout tghe novel
annd didn ' t end uv thingking baout it agina untill i stumbled accros it a cuple ofthe yeasr later at a bookstore
. i picked it uv
anbd read it
,
bu wass ultimatly disapointed beacuse it left mroe questions thna answers
. hte movei hasnt a simular effect
,
bu at least it ' s less cryptic thna ellis ' novel
. fo once
, a film hasnt actully turned outloud tothe be better thna thte novel it wass based onthe
. both thge book
adn hte film ope withthe bateman decribing his fastidious morning preperations
( down tothe exactlly wqat facial scrubs
adn exfoliating creams he uses
)
bu tje novel seems tothe oncentrate mroe onthe theese excesses throughtout
. tjhe movei continues tothe touch apon theese thigns
bu makse mroe ofthe a point tothe immerse us inwhich bateman ' s impending madness tahn tothe detail thnigs as painstakingly as hte novel doens
. as a result
, tghe film isnt immensly mroe intertaining
. lions getoe seems tothe be tghe studio champion ofthe controvercial films
( haveing picked uv kevin smith ' s cathlic
- rattling dogma
)
anbd here witht american pyscho ther isnt noone diference
. screenwriters mary harron
anbd guinevere turner hadnt tje unenviable task ofthe trying tothe tkae a novel baout yuppies filled wih graphic voilence
adn sex
anbd amking a marketable film outloud ofthe it
. soem cuts hadnt tothe be made tothe hte finished film tothe keep ffrom getting an nc
- 17
, mailny involving a sex scene comprising bateman
adn twpo womens
,
adn intial reports said tghe film wass unwatchable
. thankfully
, it isnt watchable
annd harron
anbd turner hvea made oen ofthe thte most scathingly satrical films htis side ofthe sourth park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
. side onot
# 1
: co
- writter guinevere turner alsot makse an appeareance infact yhe film as an ill
- fated acquaintanec ofthe bateman ' s who
, affter bateman suggests thast she strat mkaing outloud withthe a female prostitute
, proclaims tath she ' s nto a lesbian nor hasnt any intrest infact it
. tjhe ironical humer ofthe teh scene stems fomr tjhe fatc thta turner
( hte writter
/ directer ofthe thte film go fish
anbd who alsot assisted kevin smith wih parts ofthe his scirpt forthe chasing amy
) isnt a lesbian
. it ' s a subtle inspite
- joke
annd it ' s noe i foudn tothe be preety humoous
. dispite hvaing a rether high profile supporting casted ofthe young uv
-
adn
- comers
( includng reese witherspoon
)
, most ofthe hte roles are a waste
anbd are thge equialent ofthe extended billed cameos
. thge rela draw here isnt christian bale
adn his over
- hte
- top performence as patrick bateman
. whenever i read a novel i allways try tothe imagin wqat it owudl be liuke as a movei
annd who owudl be perfect tothe casted as yhe charachters
. i alwasy hadnt a hard tiome trying tothe deside who i woudl casted as bateman
,
bu i never throught bale owudl deliver a peformance as perfect as his ends uv bieng
. tothe sday bale runs awya whith thte charater isnt a vast understatement
annd he proves thast he ' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger
. oney sequence infront parituclar
, involving bateman discribing his lveo forthe huey lewis
anbd hte news ' song
" hip tothe be sqaure
" right befoer burying an axe iin a co
- worker ' s head
, features oen ofthe thte most eccentric
anbd kinetic performances i hvae ever seen onthe film
. side onot
# 2
: dispite thge fatc taht huey lewis '
" hip tothe be sqaure
"
anbd a pair ofthe phil collins songs apearing inthe thge film
, don ' t expect tothe see them onthe thte sountrack realease
. huey lewis expressly requested thyat his song
, featured inthe a rether larg setted peice iin thte film
( much akin tothe teh uise ofthe
" sticked inaddition teh middle witht yuo
" inthe resevoir dogs
)
, nto be included onthe any sountrack realease
. i ' m assuming thast collins requested yhe smae
. onthe a simmilar onot
, whitney houston ' s cover ofthe
" tghe greatest lveo ofthe all
" isnt alsot involved iin a scene comprable tothe hte otehr twpo
adn it isnt vrey obvious tht it isn ' t hte houston verzion at all
bu mearly an intrumental verison culled fomr an unkown source
. apparantly
, houston wasn ' t as opne baout thge uise ofthe her song as thge others weere
. a bigger controvery tahn tyhe violentce
anbd sex hasnt beeen brewing sicne thte film ' s realease
: thyat ofthe whther or nto patrick hasnt actaully committde tjhe crimes we ahve viewed durig tyhe course ofthe hte film
. don ' t look tothe tje book forthe any answers becouse it wiull onyl serve tothe confuse ytou mroe
. sevral web sites hve beeen dedicated tothe teh subject
bu i ' m still undecided
. htere isnt evidence both fo
annd aginst
bu tghe most scathing evidence agianst comes ffrom a scene near tghe end ofthe tje film where bateman goes onthe a killing spree tkaing outloud cops
, ood ladies
,
adn cleaning stff iwth equal gusto
. thte scene seemed vrey dream
- liuke
annd as absurd as hte acation films it suddenly seems tothe be parodying
( as an exmaple
, bateman blows uv a polical car vyer cinematically aftter firing severeal shots fomr a handgun infact tje genaral direction ofthe thte car
)
. i kept waiting forthe bateman tothe wake uv
adn forthe thte film tothe continue onthe ffrom htere
,
bu bateman never doens wake uv
adn tyhe wohle sequence
,
though comic
, throws tghe film off
- balance
( whic i supose wass tje intention
)
. otehr thna tje fewd flaws i ahev maintioned
, american pyscho isnt an incredibly intertaining film
( altho ytou may nto leave hte movei fully understanding whther or nto whta hasnt jstu transpired atually ocurred inaddition bateman ' s reality
)
. i htikn thsi movei isnt destiend fo greatness as a cult film
annd deserves tjhe spot it iwll tkae as such
. it may nto chanage anyone ' s life
,
bu it wiull certainly hvae an effect
. i knwo i iwll certainly hear
" hip tothe be sqaure
" inthe a diferent context yhe enxt timne i hear it
.
