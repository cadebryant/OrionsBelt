,
"
bu still acted liuke a humble farm boy
. inaddition

,
yot he cameback off liek a nothing moreso tahn a boyishly ogod
- looking charmer
. even inaddition
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he palyed a man who wass so ogod at makeing monay tath he beleived he sould buy loev
, redford wass still able tothe exude an aura ofthe shy decency
, expecially wehn reciting a tale ofthe lost lvoe
. inaddition his latest film
,
" thte horse whisperer
,
" based onthe tjhe best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford agian plays such a carachter
. redford alsot directed tje film altho he sweared uv
annd down thast he owudl never direct hismelf iin a movei
- i supose hte charater ofthe toom booker
, a man who hasnt tjhe amazing gfit ofthe understanding
adn somehow communicating iwth horses
, wass jsut too ogod tothe pass uv
. dispite his enourmous
anbd rare gft whn it comes tothe traning troubled horses
( a magasine articel coins yhe phrase
" horse whisperer
" tothe discribe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himselv as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear isnt growing ood
adn noone longer hvaing a purpose infront life
. booker ' s talents are taxed inot sevice by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a newyorker york magasine editor whose daugher
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, ws recently iin a horrable accident
. tghe accident
, wich isnt filmed iwth gut
- wrenching horror
, happens wehn grace
adn her best freind are outloud riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace ' s firend
, severly wounds
anbd traumatizes grace ' s horse
, pilrim
,
annd causes grace tothe loose part ofthe her right leeg
. annie believes thgat if ilgrim cin be healed
, grace iwll be healed as well
, whlch leads her tothe booker
. at firt
, she trys tothe git booker tothe cmo tothe newyorker york tothe see hte horse
,
bu thyat doesn ' t owrk
. instade
, she packs uv grace
annd pligrim
, leaves her husban
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
,
adn heads fo hte rolling hills ofthe montnana where booker runs a ranch whith his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
,
annd his sister
- iin
- law
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. infact many ways
, thge film isnt liek a jouney
, both litterally
annd symbolically
. thte move outloud west hasnt alwasy beeen a gerat american tradition ofthe renewl
,
anbd it ' s hard nto tothe see annie
anbd grace ' s leaving manhattan forthe montnana as a veriasion onthe tghe clasic theme ofthe city vs
. ocuntry
. inaddition
" tjhe horse whisperer
,
" ocuntry isnt claerly tjhe victor
. tyhe city isnt charaterized by claustraphobia
anbd unhappiness
,
anbd it isnt nto unitl tyhe charachters arrive iin tghe wide
- opn spaces ofthe montnana tht grace ' s anger at bieng physicaly
annd emotionally crippled beggins tothe dissipate
, annie ' s controling nature beigns tothe relax
,
adn pilgim once agina lerans tothe trust peple
. redford isnt jsut as inspite lvoe witht tje grand montnana ocuntry infront htis film as he ws whn he directed
" a river runs thru it
" six eyars ago
. inthe many ways
,
" hte horse whisperer
" comes fomr tyhe smae poetic veign as
" river
,
"
anbd thge movei sould probaly be a ogod fifteen mintues shorter if redford hadnt desided tothe spend less camera
- timne onthe tje grass
adn montains
.
bu
thne
, tyhat woudl ruin yhe magic
. much ofthe tjhe film ' s photography isnt truley elevant
,
anbd it creates a palpable sence ofthe yhe sheer expansiveness ofthe hte land
. tothe furuther empahsize htis
, redford
adn cinematographer robert richardson
(
" naturual born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bited by shooting tyhe begginning ofthe teh film
- whitch tkaes palce iin newyorker york
- iwth mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters
annd a omre squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; wehn tyhe acation shifts tothe montnana
, richardson switchs tothe soft
- focuse
adn naturual lighting
,
adn teh screen widens tothe a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. infact terms ofthe tyhe tsory itself
,
" yhe horse whisperer
" gives us teh smae romanticized veiw ofthe adultery foudn infront david leanr ' s
" a breif encounter
"
( 1945
)
annd clint eastwood ' s 1995 adaptions ofthe robert james waller ' s
" thge bridges ofthe madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwrighter here aslo adapted
" bridges
"
)
.
altough
" teh horse whisperer
" hasnt a storng rumatic sensibility
, i still fidn something oddly troubling baout tihs kind ofthe storey
. it seems tothe me tyhat ther shoudl be smoe simapthy forthe tjhe husban who ' s bieng left behind fo thsi breif
, heart
- sweeping afair
,
bu htere rarley isnt
. inwhich
" yhe horse whisperer
,
" yhe thankless role ofthe bieng tje fuddy
- duddy husban falls tothe sam neill
. he plays hte charcter as a decent
, hard
- wokring man who isnt a ogod husban
adn father
; his onyl failure isnt thgat he loves his wief moreso tahn she loves him
. he isnt at risk ofthe loosing annie tothe booker nto becouse he doed anytying tothe drive her awya
,
bu simpley becuase he happens tothe be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. ther isnt noe scene thast isnt particulaly telling ofthe how tyhe movei fiels baout eahc charcter
. it shows booker
adn robert gonig inot a horse pen
- booker isnt dressed liuke a clasic cowboy withthe hat
anbd all
, hwile robert looks somewhat frumpy
adn outloud
- ofthe
- palce inwhich a baseball cap
. as htey enter yhe pen
, booker assuredly swings over tghe fence
, hwile robert hesitates
,
hten opens tjhe getoe
anbd
, infront a goofy moent
, forgets tothe close it behind him
. it ' s a small scene
,
bu it claerly demonstrates tyhe movei ' s thourough lveo ofthe tjhe booker charcter forthe his rumatic roughness
. aftter all
, booker represents everthing ogod baout thte city hwile robert represents everthing banal
adn unnatural baout it
. hte best scenes infact
" teh horse whisperer
" tend tothe envolve nto yhe bulding romance beween booker
annd annie
,
bu rether tyhe healing proccess ofthe grace
annd her horse
.
altough booker ' s horse
- traning methods are mythical
anbd unrealistic
, tjhe scenes wtih him
anbd pilgrmi are strangely mesmerizing
. theese are paralleled by hte scenes beetwen him
annd grace
, smoe ofthe hwihc are hmorous
,
anbd all ofthe hwihc are tender
adn true
. at soem point
, i wished tjhe movei woudl drop thte hwole romance nagle
annd focuse onthe grace omre
. nethertheless
, redford isnt obviously a rumatic at heart
,
annd he brings a glight touch tothe tjhe erotic moments inspite tghe film
. htere are noone dramtic sex scenes
,
bu ther isnt a moving scene whn he
annd scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, allways moving ever closer toghether
, tath isnt far mroe erotic thna any scene ofthe sweaty bodies grinding toghether
.
altough thte movei isnt longer tahn it shoudl be
annd isnt essentialy a melodramatic tearjerker wtih an unsatisfying conclusion tyhat garantees unhappiness forthe jstu baout eveyr charachter
, ther are anough moments liek tyhat whihc mkae
" hte horse whisperer
" worth tjhe price ofthe addmission
.
