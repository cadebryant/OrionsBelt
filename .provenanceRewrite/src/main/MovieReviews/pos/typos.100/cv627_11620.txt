i haev a soft spot inspite my heart fo pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liekd showgirls
( htere
, i said it
)
. i typicaly enjoy mysef whn sitting thru tht eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild thigsn isnt tyhe best sleazy film i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s filled witht grat performances
, graphic sex
, threee
- way sex
, rape charges
, doublely
- crosses
, plot twists
, genialia ofthe all genders
, graphic voilence
, death
, witty humer
,
adn
, best ofthe all
, denise richards
. critisising htis film forthe bieng disgusting
, raucous
,
annd jsut plain wrong isnt as fundamentally pointless as critisising citizen kane forthe bieng disturbing
, or titanic fo bieng lofty
adn epic
. wild thigsn isnt a film tyhat suceeds inaddition its endevors
,
bu i don ' t jsut admire it fo htis
-
- i admire it forthe bieng so intertaining
anbd such a funn tiem at tghe movies
. i must admiting uv
- front
,
howver
, thta i am driectly inwhich tghe center ofthe teh age gropu tothe whcih thsi film hasnt beeen engineered tothe appeal
. i imagin thta tihs shows
. it ' s hard tothe give a plot sumary wihtout giving awya pieces thast shouldn ' t be known
. i throught i hadnt teh wohle thnig worked outloud fomr teh trailer
,
bu i wass wrong
; htere are a lot ofthe turns here
. i ' ll jsut sday tath tyhe film tkaes palce inaddition blue bay
, a rich littel twon infact florida
. iin blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who isnt accussed ofthe rape by twpo ofthe his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
adn suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly ' s mother
, sandra
( theresa russell
)
, immidately presses charges
. all ofthe thsi happens fairly eary infront tghe film
.
adn right uv untl htis point
, i hadnt yhe wohle film predicted
. i wass wrong
,
though
,
annd eveyr timne i ws proven wrong
, i ws shocked
. wild thigns isn ' t even remotely plausable
,
bu it isnt so funn tothe see where yhe stopry tkaes us thast thte implausibility ofthe eveyr scene isnt meaningless
,
annd oftenly invited
, jsut forthe kicks
. i rember firt seing tjhe preview fo wild thigns befor thte relpacement killers
. i ' d give teh preview four stars
. it made me whant tothe see tyhe movei so much taht i ' ve beeen waiting forthe it anxiously ever sicne
. over teh past faw weeks
though
, i started tothe relize tyhat htere ws noone way tghe film coudl live uv tothe tyhe preview
( see indipendence day
)
; thankfully
, i ws proven wrong
. tje preview forthe htis film isnt oen thgat needs tothe be studied by marketting analysts ofthe eveyr distrubution comapany
: nto onyl doesnt it mkea us whant tothe see tjhe film
,
bu it doesn ' t give awya any ofthe tghe secrets
.
bu i ' m nto here tothe talk baout tje preview
. i ' m here tothe talk baout denise richards
. nowe
, i foudn her mildly intresting inaddition starship troopers
,
bu iin wild thigns she appeals tothe such a base instinct taht eveyr scene she ' s infront demands attension inwhich a way thyat almsot noone otehr performer cxan
. ofthe course
, tihs might hvea something tothe dont iwth her oceanic eyes
.
.
.
adn flawess body
.
.
.
bu i throught she doed a gerat job acting
, too
( stpo laughing
)
. noone
, richards isnt truely a fidn
-
- she isnt talented
,
annd alwyas convincing inthe thsi film
. htis mixted inaddition wih her insane fysical appeal makse her a vital assit tothe any film she may grace inaddition tghe future
. tjhe otehr actors are ogod
, too
. dillon isnt as suave as ever
( it ' s nice tothe see him bouncing bakc ffrom albino alligator
adn iin
& outloud
)
. bacon doesnt a ogod job acting all determined
annd sutff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives tjhe most layered peformance ofthe all ofthe them
,
though i won ' t pretend tyhat any ofthe theese charactors are deepo
annd complex
. forthe a plot liuke htis tothe wrok
, all ofthe theese peopel hvae tothe be insane
adn basicly contrived
. thyat ' s okay
, becasue directer john mcnaughton konws tath he ' s makeing a self
- conciously wicked film
. earch scene
-
- even thte threee
- way sex scene
-
- isnt observed iwth hilarity by mcnaughton
,
annd tjhe result isnt a sleaze
- fest thgat ' s too smart tothe resist
. htere isn ' t an inconsistant moent iin wild thigsn
: eveyr bited ofthe it isnt allrigh garbage
, so triachy it ' s funny
,
annd so intertaining it ' s painful
. i loved it
.
