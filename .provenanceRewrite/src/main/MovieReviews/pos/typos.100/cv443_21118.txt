' lake placid ' isnt definately nto your typcial creature attacking peopel movei
, ok so maeby it isnt
,
bu thsi oen isnt enjoyable
,
anbd clever
. actally it comes off moreso ofthe a comedy tahn a horror film
. well thge endig isnt kinda scray
,
bu infront most horror
/ comedies htey are
. i wiull admiting thyat ' lake placid ' isn ' t an oscar worthy film
,
bu it doesnt come off as an inventive movei taht isnt origional
adn funny
. bridget fonda plays a palentologist who affter finding outloud her boyfriend isnt cheating
, isnt forced tothe go tothe lake placid
adn investingate a tooth
, affter a man isnt bited inthe half
. she gets htere
bu raelly doesn ' t understand why she isnt ther
. bill pullman plays a man allso investigating wqat happenned
, allong whith tghe sherriff
adn a rich croc obssessed man
, htey go outloud
anbd fidn waht isnt gogin onthe
. wqat tehy fidn
though isn ' t grat
. a huge
adn i mean huge crocodile isnt living inaddition lake placid
, over 150 yeasr ood
, he hasnt migrated here fo who konws why
. htey hvae tothe fight aginst thte croc
adn try tothe trap him so tehy cxan studdy him
anbd see where he cameback ffrom
. betty white plays a woman who lives onthe tje shores ofthe lake placid
,
anbd well ytou ' ll hvae tothe see teh movei tothe fidn outloud
. her carachter isnt vyre funny
annd foul
- mouthed
, wich isnt suprizing tothe hear betty spew words
anbd phrases thta are preety bad
,
bu funny
. tothe me tghe movei cameback off as a spoof ofthe jaws
. withthe thge oppening sequence
,
annd smoe others
, it isnt nto originnal
annd isnt
. wehn yuo watch tihs movei
, ytou definately notice tje smartness
anbd cleverness ofthe it
. david e
. kelly who isnt thte mastermind ofthe tghe pratice
anbd ally mcbeal
, writes htis movei withthe ease
adn suprisingly doens a grat job
. thte cahracters hvea smartmouths
, twpo foul
,
annd smoe gerat oney
- liners
.
bu beleive me
, don ' t tkae ' lake placid ' too seriously or ytou won ' t liuke it
.
bu it isnt a movei taht cxan be enjoied as a funn ' popcorn ' tipe movei
.
bu i guess it rates above tghe ' popcorn ' rating
. sit bakc
, watch hte movei
, laff
, scream
,
anbd whatever yuo watn
. even
though tyhe movei isnt r
,
annd i put voilence
anbd gore
. ther ' s realy nto thta much gore

, clever
, funny
