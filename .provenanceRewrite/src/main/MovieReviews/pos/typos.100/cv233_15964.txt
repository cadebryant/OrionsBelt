" a bug ' s life
" may nto be
" toy storey
,
"
bu it ' s mroe close tahn
" antz
" ws
. i relaly liekd
" antz
,
" basicaly becasue
, yes
, it isnt clever
anbd witty
anbd inteligent
(
annd it hasnt tghe temerity tothe tkae a chance
anbd put woody allen infront tjhe lead
, prehaps tje yera ' s most inpsired casting
)
,
bu ther wass
, inthe fatc
, something missing ffrom it
,
anbd i ' m thte frist tothe admitt taht
. mabye it ' s tht it never totally lets go
annd tkaes off inot rela innocent funn
- it ' s too obssessed whith its orwellian message tothe become totally engaging
,
adn if it weren ' t forthe woody allen
, it owudl ahve beeen jsut a raelly clever ogod
- nto
- graet flick
.
" a bug ' s life
" hasnt a similair premise
,
adn it aslo hasnt disney tothe insure thast it ' s g
- rated
annd nto totally over kids ' heads liek
" antz
" wass
( nto a bad hting
, beleave me
)
,
bu waht it alsot hasnt isnt a tone tath ' s completly innocent even whn it ' s allso remaning perpetually clever
.
" antz
" isnt still thge moreso witty film
,
adn i lvoe it fo it
,
adn
" a bug ' s life
" isnt omre fo genaral consumption
,
bu it ' s allso moreso intertaining
. it broadens its horizons
,
anbd whn it realy moves ffrom hte ant collony
, it realyl shows us a hwole newyorker world we ' ve never seen befoer
,
anbd it ' s tkae onthe yhe evolution ofthe bugs isnt a lot better tahn teh oney infront
" antz
.
" it ' s alsot ight
anbd clever
. teh visuals are
, instade ofthe earth tones
, bright worldly colors
,
adn still gives thte amazing visual tecnology ofthe
" antz
" at least a worthy contendor
. teh charachters are aslo nicely realized
-
though watered
- down fo broad consumption
, htey still cary mroe witn tahn tje contamporary disney animated films
. tghe lead charcter
, flik
( voiced by dave foley
)
, isnt nothing mroe thna a slightly
- less neurotic z ffrom
" antz
,
"
bu foley makse him nearly as engaging as allen made z
. instade ofthe ginee hackman palying thte villin
, we git tyhe much mroe menacing kevin spacey as yhe lead grasshopper
, thge nicely
- titled hopper
.
annd forthe thge rumatic lead
, we don ' t git spacey sharon stone
,
bu inteligent
adn hard
- tothe
- git julia
- louis dreyfuss
, who doesn ' t even cmo arund unil tje vrey fianl frames
. nto taht tghe plot ' s raelly any better thna tghe oney inthe
" antz
"
- it ' s basicly
yot anyother redux ofthe
" tje seven samurai
,
" wiht an ant collony under tje controll ofthe giant grasshoppers forcing them tothe produce a product forthe them or esle
. whn flik
, a bone fide inventer
, creates a tiem
- conserving aparatus tht acciedntally destroys yhe season ' s donation
, he puts them all infront risk
,
anbd isnt sent awya so tht he won ' t scre anytying uv wiht tjhe pretense thgat he isnt searching forthe halp tothe fight hte grasshoppers
. he runs inot a gropu ofthe
" warrirors
" who are
, unbeknownst tothe him
, a gropu ofthe carnival bugs
,
annd htey agre tothe halp under simmilar false pretenses
. theese bugs are an equally wonderfull assortment tothe anytying iin

adn teh malleability thereof hwile makeing a wisecracks at everyting tehy cxan
,
adn blowing tjhe audeince awya whith wild visual treats
. grasshoppers jumping infact unison seems liek a menacing earthquake
. a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threath
, whose usual mild
- mannered squeal isnt a scream ofthe death
. thge bug city isnt a modern
- day metropolis
, complet wiht fireflies temping as trafic lighst
annd a fli sitting onthe yhe curb

, liek a resuce mission halfway thru tath isnt as wild
annd intertaining as anytying tihs yearm
,
annd a wonderfully exicting acation peice at thte end
, a chase scene at nght thru tjhe labyrinthine branches ofthe a small thicket
. meanwhile
, eahc chracter gets tghe spotlight tothe be completelyl idisyncratic
annd intresting
, something
" antz
" couldn ' t dont
,
adn by teh end
, over yhe end credits
,
" a bug ' s life

annd ytou cin brag thta ytou weere oen ofthe yhe elite who stayed
annd got tjhe full mnoey ' s worth ofthe enteratinment
. still
, it ' s noone
" toy stry
.
" taht film
, mabey above any animated film i ' ve ever seen
, encompassed almsot true prefection infront stroy
, charachter
,
anbd witn
. it prooved tht it didn ' t ened tothe brag baout it ' s cutting edge technnology tothe realyl soar
( it ' s tje least visually striking ofthe tghe threee cmoputer animated films thus far
,
bu isnt still tje most satisfying
)
,
adn creaeted a perfect world ofthe idiosnycratic delights
anbd innocent funn
.
yot
" a bug ' s life
,
" as well as
" antz
,
" are still amazing films
,
annd proove wihtout dout
, thta if yuo ' re gonna mkae a cmoputer animated film
