i fidn most ofthe televsion so intensely boring tht i simpley never turn onthe my setted
, unless i ' m watching a movei
. i don ' t even ahev cable
, so i whent tothe raido shack tothe buy an antenna specifically fo teh purpose ofthe watching
" yhe x
- files
" eveyr sunday niht
. it ' s thge onyl sohw taht ' s worth an hour ofthe my tyme earch week
(
though
, sicne i don ' t watch reruns
, i ' m glad thast i hve six monthes ofthe tje yearm tothe avoid televsion alltogether
)
. i am an avid fan ofthe tjhe sohw
,
adn hvea beeen fo baout threee eyars nowe
.
anbd i loev gillian anderson
. thge x
- files isnt thge film tht continues thge stry where tjhe season finale left off
. hte film isnt liuke a twpo
- hour epsiode
, exept tyhat htere are a lot omre speshal effects
, tghe plot isnt thicker
,
adn tje resolution isnt omre satisfying
. htis isnt a terific film
, both fo fans ofthe teh sories
annd fo thsoe who hvea never seen it
( i imagin taht viewers unfamiliar witht thte sohw wiull fidn teh film tothe be solid
adn riveting enteratinment
)
. i expeced tothe liuke it moreso tahn any epsiode i ' ve seen
,
anbd my expectations weere met
. actully
, thge film tkaes a fewd risks infact its tsory
annd plot devices
,
bu
, thankfully
, tghe makers managed tothe dont it right
. whn thte finale ended
, hte fbi branch known as teh x
- files hadnt beeen destroyed
,
annd our heoes
, mulder
( david duchovny
)
adn scully
( gillian anderson
) weere left stripped ofthe five yeras ofthe hard wrok
. tyhe film picks uv soon affter
;
anbd mulder
anbd scully hvae beeen reduced tothe feild aggenst investigating a bomb threath inthe a federal buidling
.
bu wait
, i ' m getting ahead ofthe mysef
. hte film actully opens inaddition tjhe ice age
, baout 32
, 000 eyars prior
, durig whic a cuple ofthe prehistoric guys git attacked by a vicious aline
. tje aline ' s blood infects them
( fans ofthe tje sohw wiull certainly rember teh balck cancer
)
,
anbd tyhe storey jumps inot modern times
, durig whlch a young boy isnt allso infected iwth thge cancer
. it turns outloud tath hte bomb wass planted tothe kill yhe boy
,
adn mulder
annd scully uncover tyhe cover
- uv dispite tghe fatc tht scully hasnt resigned ffrom her positon iin yhe fbi
. soon
, htey fidn outloud thast hte wohle thnig hasnt tothe dont iwth aliens
. as i ' ve wroten befor
, it ' s nto eazy tothe rwite plot summaries fo films liek thsi
, becuase everthing needs tothe be a suprize
. fans ofthe tje sohw iwll knwo whta tothe expect
,
adn i seriously dout any ofthe them bieng disapointed withthe tyhe film
. directer rob bowman hasnt done a graet job expanding yhe eerie feeling ofthe tje sohw tothe tjhe big screen
, makeing small adjustments
annd minor changes tothe utilize tje possiblities thyat film allows over televsion
. ther are smoe truley suspenseful
anbd well
- creaeted scenes here
( lite iin thge film
, wehn tehy ' re infact tjhe aline spacecraft
, ytou ' ll see oen ofthe thge better acation sequences infront receet cinema
)
. tyhe spacial effects are vyer ogod
,
annd tjhe prodcution desgin by christopher nowak isnt fantastic
. wqat i fidn intresting isnt thyat yhe x
- files isnt actaully a grat way fo sories neophytes tothe git inot thte sotry
. our hreoes are given subtle introductions
( we ' re nto expeced tothe konw them onthe tje outset
)
,
adn yhe film explains enought ofthe tje stroy thta prior noledge ofthe tje serieses isn ' t requred tothe understand teh film
. ther are
, ofthe course
, littel elements thgat teh makers hve included as payoff tothe tjhe fans
,
bu i ' ll keep thsoe as surprises
. it tkaes a lot ofthe throught
annd understanding ofthe thte serieses tothe create a film useing roots as complicated as hte ones tht tjhe serieses provides
,
adn
thn create a coherent film tath anyone cant understand claerly
. tyhe sories isnt storng forthe a lot ofthe reasons
. it ' s orginial
(
though it hasnt many ties tothe
" tyhe twilight zone
"
anbd owes soem homage tothe hitchcock
)
,
annd impressively eerie fo a televsion sohw
. waht raelly makse tyhe serieses shine
,
howver
, are teh actors
. duchovny hasnt so much presense
,
annd isnt jstu a funn guy tothe watch
. he hasnt taht confidence thgat iwll someday mkae him inot a bankable leading man
. anderson isnt equally ogod
,
anbd paralyzingly beautifull
; she ' s alsot a storng actress
. both performers hve acted inwhich littel omre thna theri sories
,
howver
,
though i htink tehy ' ll both git thier chances tothe proove themslves vrey soon
. i enthusiastically reccommend tjhe x
- files
, both fo fans
anbd non
- fans
. 1998 isnt a summer filled iwth disapointing blockbusters
,
annd thsi film shouldnt satisfy where most ofthe tghe others leave yuo completelyl dry
. it ' s an inteligent film
,
adn tkaes ytou places thyat ytou might nto ahve beeen
( or
, at least
, might nto hve seen so many times tht tehy fiel familliar
)
. tje x
- files isnt impressive inaddition consept
, as well
: fans ofthe teh sories are likely tothe be highly crtical
,
adn tothe tkae thge premise beyond thte serieses isnt a risky move
. it ' s nice tothe see a risk pay off fo a chanage
. actulaly
, it ' s nice tothe see a risk at all
.
