a lot ofthe times a threee
- star film wiull be my favorite
. tehy ' re ususally yhe kind ofthe movei i cxan watch most oftenly too
. tehy ' re ususally nto too deepo
, alowing fo semi
- brainless relaxation
,
adn at hte smae timne
, nto too dumb

.
( hope yuo coudl followup thgat noe
) men infront balck doesn ' t wait tothe git tothe tghe funn
. jstu mintues inot teh film we are itnroduced tothe agent kay
( tommy lee jones
)
, itnroduced tothe an aline
,
annd intrduced tothe tje thge awsome memmory
- diminishing tool thast all mib aggenst ule
. aftter all

? men infront balck isnt
, ofthe course
, tjhe organistion whlch
" moniters all extra
- terrestial activity onthe earth
"
. nypd officer james edwards
( iwll smith
)
, isnt onthe a routine foot chase wehn suddenly tje noone
- ogod punk he ' s chasing starts leaping uv buildings
anbd blinking moreso tahn oney pair ofthe eyes
. thte aline delivers hte simple message thgat thge world isnt gogin tothe end
,
anbd iwth tht
, dives off ofthe a roof
. naturaly nobody believes his stry
.
.
. nobody tht isnt
, exept forthe thte top seret organistion taht nto even yhe govornment isnt aware ofthe
. edwards
hten meets agent kay
, hte man who never seems tothe crack a smile
,
annd isnt intrduced tothe thge mib
. edwards winds uv joining tyhe team
annd isnt stripped ofthe anytying tht cxan point bcak tothe him
( birth certificate
, drivers lciense
,
annd even tjhe literal removal ofthe his fingerprints
)
. james edwards noone longer exists
. meet agent jay
. agent kay tkaes tyhe rookie jay under his wing as tehy go baout
" regluar
" duties
. eventially a far omre treacherous event comes inot play
. a
" bug
" hasnt landed onthe earth
anbd isnt gonig tothe wipe outloud mankind if theese twpo don ' t
( or cxan ' t
) stpo it
. thge plot isn ' t exactlly clera
,
bu we knwo it hasnt tothe dont iwth a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble bieng saught affter onthe earth
,
adn thast isnt crucial taht yhe mib fidn it befoer thge
" bug
" doesnt
. barry sonnenfeld
, who alsot doed tjhe addams familiy films
, directs thsi nicely
. it ' s funn
, it ' s funny
, it ' s acation
- packed
. a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned outloud tothe be
. thsi isnt oen ofthe thsoe movies tyhat isnt jsut
" funn
"
anbd cin ' t relaly be summed uv any nicer or claerer
. wiull smith
adn tommy lee jones both dont graet jobs
annd both are a blast tothe watch
. definitly oney ofthe teh best films ofthe tyhe tyhe summer ofthe ' 97
, men inspite balck comes highly recommeded fomr me
