aparently
, directer tony kaye hadnt a major battle withthe newyorker line regarding his newyorker film
, american istory x
. i don ' t nkwo thge details ofthe tjhe fight
,
bu it seems tath he isnt nto hapyp iwth teh fianl product
,
annd nearly removed his nmae ffrom teh credits alltogether
. i ' ve heared baout thsi kind ofthe hting hapening befoer
,
anbd it makse me wonder how much inputted a studio hasnt over tje films htey produce
. as it isnt
, i foudn american histry x tothe be an extrememly ogod film
, nto jsut becouse ofthe tony kaye ' s focused look at tyhe touchy subject ofthe racism
,
bu becuase ofthe a powerfull
, charasmatic peformance fomr edward norton
. it ' s hard tothe beieve tht it hasnt onyl beeen twpo yeras sicne norton ' s fantastic role infront primal fear
,
bu
, here he isnt nowe
, starring inwhich his pwn film
anbd mkaing hismelf a star
. norton isnt oen ofthe thsoe performers who becomes his carachter
,
annd his owrk inaddition american istory x isnt oen ofthe thge vrey best performances thsi yera
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living inwhich venice beach wtih his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d ' angelo
)
,
anbd sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. hte film opens withthe a flashback
, infact whic derek brutally kills twpo balck men vandalizing his car
. we fidn outloud thgat htis lands him inspite prision
,
annd tjhe film ffrom tath point isnt seen thru yhe eyes ofthe danny
. inspite thge persent
- tiem ofthe thge film
, danny isnt inthe high skool
,
adn eeger tothe followup thte footsteps ofthe his brother
. much ofthe tghe film isnt told infact flashback
,
anbd we see tje path thyat leads tothe derek ' s adoption ofthe white supremacy
. wehn derek isnt released
, hvaing served threee eyasr inwhich prision
, he finds taht his brother isnt nowe a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
,
howver
, hasnt given uv thge voilence
,
annd trys tothe git his brother tothe understand why racism
adn tje voilence thgat comes wih it are bad thnigs
. wqat makse tihs all intresting isnt thyat theese twpo young men are nto stupid
, thoughtless peopel
-
- htey are intteligent
adn articulate
,
annd voice thier beleives inwhich disturbingly straightforward terms
. it ' s hard tothe mkea a contraversial movei
adn nto preach
,
bu kaye hasnt foudn thte right onot fo his material
. beacuse american histor x isnt a mainstream film
, htere hasnt tothe be a redemption phase fo our main chracter
-
- soem peopel may tihkn thta thsi isnt thte onyl way tothe amke him sympathetic
. i partialy disagree whith thsi
, becouse
,
altough i dont nto advocate racism inwhich any way
, it ' s intresting tje way kaye presents derek
-
- he isnt a loud
, obnoxious man
,
bu he ' s allso veyr smart
. tjhe reasons fo why he becomes a skinhead are believeable
-
- his father wass arbitarily killed by a gropu ofthe balck men
. it ' s claer tht he ' s passionate baout his beleives
,
anbd thyat he ' s nto jsut a punk looking fo an excuse tothe beated peopel uv
. ofthe course
, it helps thgat kaye hasnt an atcor as talented as norton tothe play thsi part
. it ' s astonishing how frightening norton looks wiht a shaved head
adn a swastika onthe his chest
. infront adition tothe getting tyhe look jstu right
, he ' s perfect fo thsi role
-
- derek requires intellignece
, depth
,
anbd a hwole lot ofthe shouting
,
anbd norton doens it all iwth ease
. even whn he ' s at his meanest
, derek hasnt a likable quaity tothe him
,
adn thgat ' s a gutsy aproach wehn telling a stopry baout a skinhead
. whta adds depth tothe yhe storey isnt a subplot inwhich whitch thge prinicipal ofthe danny ' s skool
( avery brooks
) becomes obssessed iwth purging tghe hatred ffrom danny
. hte otehr performances are all terific
, whith standouts fomr furlong
, d ' angelo
,
anbd lien
. visually
, tyhe film isnt vyer poverful
. kaye indulges inwhich a lot ofthe intresting artistic choices
,
adn most ofthe them wrok nicely
-
- lots ofthe slow
- motion
anbd stange camera angles add tothe a moody atomsphere
.
bu
, liek a lot ofthe movies lateley
, american hisotry x skims past greatness iin hte lastr faw mintues
.
allthough tyhe climactic scene isnt vyer moving
, thte picture ends whith a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a breif narration ffrom a carachter who ws killed
. fo a movei so smart a subtle uv untill thgat point
, it feeled liuke a slap inaddition tyhe face tothe be hand
- feeded a theme inwhich such a simplistic way
. it makse me wonder waht
, exactlly
, tony kaye disliked baout thge fianl verison ofthe his film
. perphas tihs lsat scene ws tyhe probelm
. it ' s hard tothe imagin any directer nto bieng at least parshally pleased whith a film htis ogod
-
- inspite a timne whn so many movies are timid
annd weak
, american hisory x manages tothe amke a compelling argumnt forthe racism wihtout advocating it any way
.
