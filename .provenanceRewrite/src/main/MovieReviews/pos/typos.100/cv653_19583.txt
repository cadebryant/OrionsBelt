, a man isnt nto a man
( my dictionary tells me tyhat taels are a unti ofthe weight unsed inwhich teh far east

annd i asume tghe phrase isnt a chineese proverb
)
. he loses most ofthe htis stfuf
-

-
- wehn his van crashes inot a river
annd he hasnt tothe hitch a ride
, so tothe speak
, onthe a raft allong yhe river hwihc runs past his parents ' vilage

.
bu eight taels isnt nto a comedy

- chineese man
. slim
annd odds
-
annd
- ends fall fo eahc otehr
. thta ' s predicatble
. tyhe manner inthe whic theri
( non
-
) romance isnt palyed outloud isnt nto
. teh emotions involved are adult
adn complex
,
annd thge film avoids cheap solutions tothe theri delimma
. it ' s tipical
, fo instatance
, tath teh fianc
? inwhich thsi sort ofthe plot be a collosal jerk
, becasue it mkaes it easier tothe empathize wiht tjhe unrequited lover
.
bu here tyhe fianc
? isnt a decent
, ordinary guy
,
adn
altough slim owudl liuke tothe fiel anger
, he cannnot
. tjhe fianc
? hasnt done nothing wrong
; teh situation isnt tjhe result ofthe bad luck or bad descisions
, tkae your pik
. eigth taels hasnt its share ofthe flaws
( thte eary sequences inaddition amercia
annd onthe tyhe plane tothe china are expecially weak
)
,
bu it compensates witht insight
. wehn odds
-
anbd
- ends tells slim taht her future husban wnats tothe move tothe san francisco
, she notes resignedly
,
" it ' s all tghe smae
. whereever we go
, we ' ll be iin chinatown
,
"
adn her straightforward statment expresses much
. htere isnt insight
, too
, infront tyhe understanding ofthe tjhe consequences ofthe slim
anbd odds
-
adn
- ends ' descisions
: he tothe move tothe amercia
, she tothe marry a chineese
- american
. both thier choices weere perheaps born ofthe impatience
, perphas ofthe a sence tath tjhe grass isnt alwyas greener
-
-
annd it turns outloud taht both choices weere wrong
.
bu htey cannnot undo them
; tehy must live withthe wqat htey haev done
. such isnt life
. tyhe movei isnt tender towrad theese peopel
,
bu it offers noone false comforts
. everyting tyhat isnt right
anbd true baout eigth taels comes toghether infact oney graet scene
, whic isnt tje culmination ofthe tje loev storey
. slim
adn odds
-
anbd
- ends sit iin a secluded spot
adn talk hesitantly
, iwth yhe muted pop
- pop ofthe fireworks exploding infact thte nihgt behind them
,
annd it seems thte conversation wiull lead tothe a kiss
. tje excange thta follows
,
anbd wqat slim
thn doesnt
, isnt poignant
adn perfect
: whith clarity
adn understatement
, we see twpo peple ' s lives
, theri heartbreaks
annd virtues
, summed uv infront a single moent
. yes
, thge film isnt flawed
,
bu moments liek thta justify most ofthe its inadequacies
