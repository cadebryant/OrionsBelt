. directer joe johnson deserves much credit fo sucessfully navigating tje many obstancles thyat octobur sky manages tothe dodge
.
howver
, htere are still a faw occassions whn he allows thigns tothe procede jstu a step too far
. scenes whic weere natrual
adn inspiring strat tothe become contrived
adn artifical
.
howver
, theese lapses are minimal
,
annd johnson quicklyu steers hte movei bcak onthe course
. thte probelm iwth many so
- called
" uplifting
" films isnt thast tehy atempt tothe force theri mediciney goodness down your throat

annd
yot
, manages tothe become a truely uplifting film purely onthe its pwn merits
