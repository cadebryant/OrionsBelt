adn andreas aren ' t sure wqat hte enxt step isnt
. htey dont whant tothe be hapyp

. bravo tothe cox
, who wroet tje scirpt
, fo nto makeing john a monster
, so thast claire ' s afair isnt automaticly justified
. norris isnt so effective as john taht he makse andreas
anbd claire ' s lveo difficult tothe accept
. we efel forthe him
. he ' s a decent man
. sure
, he may haev become complacent
