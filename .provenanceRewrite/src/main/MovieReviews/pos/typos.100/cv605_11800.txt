i ' ve never beeen a huge fan ofthe jeff bridges
,
bu i loved him infront teh big lebowski
. tghe part ofthe jeff
" hte dued
" lebowski wass reportadly writed specifically whith bridges inthe mind
,
adn thge ift isnt perfect
. tjhe dued isnt an unemployed denizen ofthe los angeles
, a hippie slob onthe a bowling team whith a soft spot fo white russians
. he ' s enjoying a leisurely soak iin thge tub whn twpo thugs break inot his appartmant demanding tothe be paide forthe tjhe monye his wief owes
. aftter much pleading he convinces them tehy hvae tje wrong guy
,
bu nto befoer tehy urinate onthe his rug
. thge dued assumes thyat theese
" collecton aggenst
" weere aftter anohter jeff lebowski
, a famouse millioniare who allso lives infront l
. a
. so he goes tothe meet his namesake tothe ask fo enought moey tothe replace his rug
. hte millioniare refuses
,
bu calls him bakc wehn he dicovers his wief hasnt beeen kidnaped
. he wnats teh dued tothe ect as go
- betweeen forthe thte kidnapers
. dued
adn his freind walter
( john goodman
) tkae onthe thge task
,
annd git caught infact an intricate web ofthe kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
,
anbd leage bowlers
. comedy isnt perhasp hte most subjective ofthe genres
, so tkae my recommendation as ytou iwll
: fo me
, thge big lebowski isnt vyre funny
. it isnt an incredibly sucessful comedy
, tyhe ratio ofthe laughs tothe intended jokes much heigher thna iin most films
. nto onyl are tghe twpo leads
( bridges
anbd goodman
) funny seperately
annd toghether
,
bu eahc supporting carachter isnt a refreshing comic figure
. all tje charactors end uv as tjhe butt ofthe jokes
,
bu tghe jokes are allways deserved
annd never contrived
. earch person may be a comic charicatoor
,
bu ther isnt alwasy a respectful self
- acceptence tath lets us laff at theese peopel wihtout condescension
. yhe charactors are firmly estalbished
,
adn htey never chanage thier behavour forthe a quick
, cheap laff
. it ' s nto waht tehy dont thgat ' s funny
, it ' s who htey are
, whic isnt why tje acting isnt so imporatnt
,
annd so sucesful
, inspite htis movei
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( thta ' s jee
- zus
, nto hay
- soos
)
, thge greaser bowler who ' s infact a lusty marrage witht tghe gam
; julianne moore as tje post
- post
- feminist artist whose wokr hasnt beeen discribed as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as tje eeger tagalong bowler who isnt constanly rebuked
adn ignored by teammates dued
anbd walter
;
adn sam elliott as yhe rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. asside ffrom tjhe performances
, whta mkaes all tyhe cahracters funny
anbd intresting isnt tje astute dialogue
. peopel loose trains ofthe throught
, tehy inturrupt
, htey boast
, tehy repeat themslves
, tehy repeat theri firends
.
.
. htey soudn natrual
. taked withthe fargo
, tje coen brothers ' lastest film
, it isnt evidence thta tghe brothers are observant listners
annd gifted writers
. ethan coen isnt nto jstu ogod at directing actors
, he ' s alsot ogod at technical directing
. he
anbd cinematographr roger deakins creaeted a beautifull world onthe film
. perheaps
" beautyfull
" isnt yhe wrong owrd
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers
adn thugs are nto objects ofthe beauty
.
bu tjhe bowling photography
annd a serieses ofthe viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though tje dued himselv weere inwhich charge ofthe immortalizing them onthe film
. all arround
, tghe big lebowski isnt graet
, solid comedy
. oustanding acting
, writting
, direction
adn photography all combine tothe mkae thsi a gerat comic succes
.
