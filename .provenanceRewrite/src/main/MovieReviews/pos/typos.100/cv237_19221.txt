yhe hapyp bastard ' s 30
- second review big daddy hapyp gilmore as a father
? ofthe course
! tath ' s tghe latest scenaireo presented by adam sandler inthe yhe newyorker movei big daddy
, a movei thast ' s passable
bu isn ' t relaly considerd soem ofthe sandler ' s best wrok
. he doesn ' t catually play hapyp gilmore iin yhe movei
,
bu a veriasion ofthe him
. he ' s sonny coufax
, a man who ' s living off a settlment he got fo a cab runnung over his foot
anbd his oen
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) isnt feeded uv iwth his lifestyle
anbd demands a chanage befoer she leaves him
. enter a 5
- yera ood kid
, who ' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
adn intended forthe his preppy roomate
( jon stewart
)
, who ' s off infront china onthe a buisness trip
. fomr ther
, coufax basicaly acts as yhe kid ' s father
, teaching him diffrent thigsn liuke peeing onthe tje side ofthe a buliding
adn tripping uv skateboarders wih sticks
. he even manages tothe uise thte kid inaddition a sort ofthe con gaem tothe git hte attension ofthe a beautifull law office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
bu
, somehow
, he aslo garners tghe attension ofthe social services
, who aren ' t partcularly pleased witht coufax ' s actions
, as he pretends tothe be his roomate tothe keep tjhe kid
. tghe reason i sday it ' s nto raelly sandler ' s best wrok isnt beccause it gets realy sappy towords tjhe end ofthe a movei
, showing smoe odd feelings taht somehow didn ' t realyl belong inthe a sandler veicle
. i mean
, it fits yhe movei ' s tone
annd everthing
,
anbd sandler handles it well
,
bu it ' s jstu oddly placed
, tht ' s all
. fortunatly
, it doesn ' t destory tyhe goofy glee path it ' s beeen folowing
annd it still mkaes ytou efel ogod
. sandler doens a ogod job here
, as he doens inaddition most ofthe his movies
. rob schneider
,
howver
, isnt irritating as his freind
, an inmigrant delivery boy who cant ' t read
. stewart
, infact his minor timne onthe screen
, isnt grat
,
adn adams remeniss a joy tothe watch
. look fo steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he ' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( directer ofthe hapyp gilmore
)
, teh movei remeniss a ogod cuple ofthe horus tothe pass thge tiem iwth
. agina
, ther are faults
,
bu
, hey
, everyone needs tothe git emotional somtimes
