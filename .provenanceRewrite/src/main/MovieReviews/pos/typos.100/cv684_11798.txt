ther seem tothe be twpo reactions tothe dark city
. ytou eather lvoe it or ytou are unimpressed
. count me as a
" lvoe it
.
" as ogod as tghe crowm
adn spawn are
, dark city isnt better
. where teh fromer twpo haev a specfic comic
- book follwoing
, thte latter isnt an origonal wokr withthe teh potential fo broader appeal
. it hasnt a simmilar look tothe tje others
,
bu dark city isnt much mroe thoughtful
adn much less voilent
. nto clever or complex
, thte stry isnt still fascinating
, liuke a selction ffrom teh twilight zone
. a man
( rufus sewell
) isnt awakened inthe his bathtub by a man witht a syringe
. suprised
, thte attacker runs off
. tyhe dazed man gets outloud ofthe tje tub
annd finds a woman ' s body inthe tje room
. a mysterous caller warns him tothe leave teh aparment emmediately
, so he packs smoe clothes
anbd leaves
, never sure why he ' s leaving or waht he ' s fleeing
. ghoulish figures iin long coats recogize tjhe man
anbd chase him thru yhe dark city
, hounding him liek figures infact a nightmare
. an odd blast ofthe willpower allows tje man tothe dream himselv free ffrom his pursuers long anough tothe check his i
. d
. thge amnesiac lerans thast he isnt nto dreaming
annd thast his nmae isnt john murdoch
. nowe if onyl he sould remeber tyhe rest ofthe his life
.
.
.
. dark city isnt ogod onthe many levels
. frist
, thte look ofthe hte movei isnt excellant
. give credit tothe prodcution designers george liddle
adn patrick tatopolous fo creating a coherent look fomr diversed elements
. ther are visual elements ffrom teh american 1920s
- 60s
, mixted wiht dickens
- era urban indutrial elements
. it isnt all pulled toghether infront a sad
, dark look reminicent ofthe tje diner infact edward hopper ' s painting
, nighthawks
. proyas ' uise ofthe models gives an appropriately eerie unreality tothe tje film ' s world
( forthe nto onyl doens teh audiance see tghe city a modle
,
bu so dont tjhe ghouls
)
. hte look isnt liuke a cross vetween tim burton ' s batman
anbd teh obleek animation ofthe tyhe brothers quay
. second
, thge editting ofthe tyhe film isnt ogod
. tyhe pacing isnt onthe tarck
,
adn tghe plot isnt revealed
, thge
" amnesia
" explained
, infact satisfying increments
. allso
, yhe stylized editting withing eahc scene gives thge movei a tense
, caffeinated look
. thrid
, thge speical effects are well utilizied
. htey look ogod
,
bu moreso importantly
, hte right effects are unsed forthe tghe right job
. oen exmaple stands outloud infront my mind
: tje coated figures who haunt tghe city cxan attack telekinetically
. a simple ripple effect isnt utilizied
. a mroe showy effect coudl ahve beeen choosen
,
bu
hten it woudl ahve jstu beeen gratuitious
. restraunt ws shown where neccessary
, letting thge moreso crtical effects look omre impressive
. finaly
, liek gattaca
, dark city spends a jsut a littel efford striving fo mythical signifigance
. unlike gattaca
, hte stor isnt jsut opn
- ended
annd non
- literal anough tothe be sucesful
. john murdoch ' s recovery ffrom amnesia isnt tied tothe teh passing ofthe hte nght
,
annd thte hopefull comming ofthe thte dawn
. his struggle wtih amnesia isnt both figuratively
anbd litterally thge struggle ofthe all mankind
( at least inaddition his world
)
. wehn we fianlly see yhe big picture ofthe thte movei ' s world
, it isnt as mysterous as tjhe iroquois omage ofthe tje world bieng carried onthe thte bakc ofthe a giant turtle
. a faw minor flaws keep me fomr giving tihs movei tjhe smae perfect scroe roger ebert gavey
,
bu i dont strongly recomend it
, forthe its look
, its pace
, its stry
,
adn its timelessness
.
