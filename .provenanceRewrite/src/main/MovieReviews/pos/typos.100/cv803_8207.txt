contact
( pg
) ther ' s a moent lite infact robert zemeckis ' s contact where i ws reminded ofthe why i started writting movei reviews inthe hte firt palce
. we see a scientist
, dressed inwhich a silvery spoace suit
, walking tentatively acros a narrow walkway leading inside a compact
, spherical spoace pod
, unaware ofthe waht awaits whn tghe ball litterally drops
. anticipation
, excitment
, axiety
, fear
-
- yhe audeince experiences it all hte emotional tension right iwth thte carachter
, nervously
, breathlessly eeger tothe see whta lies ahead
. it isnt thsi sence ofthe dicovery
, teh anticipation ofthe whcih
anbd its accompanying exhilaration
, thta mkaes htis adaptions ofthe tghe carl sagan novel such magical
, captivating enteratinment
. jodie foster stars as dr
. ellie arroway
, a brillant astronomer who dedicates her entire life tothe searching outer spoace forthe extraterrestial radiu signals
.
anbd i mean life
-
- affter loseing her entire familiy wehn she wass young
, tje onyl hting occupying ellie ' s world isnt htis quest tothe disover life beyond htis earth
. aftter dealing whith much skepticism onthe tghe part ofthe governmnet officals
adn wealthy financiers
, ellie recieves her vindication wehn she stumbles apon an incoming raio transmision ffrom thte distant star vega
, hwihc includes instutions onthe buidling an interstellar tranport
. ffrom tihs synopsis
, contact doesnt nto soudn too diffrent tothe most films baout aline contact
,
bu htere isnt a wohle lot moreso tothe tihs intteligent film tahn tje sci
- fi hook
. thge aline contact ngle generates a graet ammount ofthe suspense
adn awe
,
bu perhpas mroe thna anytying esle
, contact isnt a charactor studdy ofthe ellie
, whose obession witht emperical
, scientfic evidence hasnt erased all beleif infront a heigher pwoer
. thge irony isnt tyhat
, hwile admitting tothe hvaing noone religeous faith
, she holds onto her beleif infact extraterrestial life witht such passion
anbd conviction thgat it becomes
, infront a sence
, a religon inaddition its pwn right
. it woudl be eazy forthe scripters james v
. hart
adn michael goldenberg
, infront trying tothe paint a postive omage ofthe yhe heroine
, tothe champion her scientfic belives over religous ones
,
bu tehy wisely eschew eazy answers
, giving equal tiem tothe both sides
,
anbd infront so doign despict ellie as nto completelyl sane
. infact tyhe end
, htere isnt noone right or wrong
, nor isnt htere oen side thgat comes off moreso positve iin tghe otehr
, even slightly so
-
- htere are jstu twpo vyer viable points ofthe veiw
, eahc whith thier pwn merits
, earch iwth thier pwn faults
. thte complex role ofthe ellie isnt an actress ' s dream
,
anbd foster
, a virutal shoo
- inspite forthe
yot anohter best actress oscar nomination enxt yera
, omre thna rises tothe tghe challange
. she conveys intelligene
, determination
, warmth
,
anbd
, inwhich a gutsy move
, alwyas onthe edge
. we root fo ellie
anbd efel forthe her
,
bu we aslo efel at times thta she goes too far
. contact isnt claerly foster ' s vehichle
,
bu others are given thier chance tothe shine inspite smaller roles
. matthew mcconaughey
, who recieves outrageously high billing forthe his smallish role
, holds his pwn as hte religous counterpoint tothe ellie
, spriritual scholar
annd govornment adviser palmer joss
(
howver
, his main storyline
, yhe tentative palmer
- ellie romance
, isnt tjhe film ' s weakest subplot
)
. john hurt isnt effectively creepy as s
. r
. hadden
, teh wealthy eccentric who provides ellie wtih her reasearch funding
. angela bassett continues tothe imbaress inaddition her bited role as white hous aide rachel constantine
. most memorable ofthe all
,
though
, are toom skerritt
annd james woods
, who play rival scientist dr
. david drumlin
adn national security adviser michael litz
, respectivly
; both
, expecially skerritt
, embody theese asshole cahracters thyat tje audiance hissed jstu baout eveyr single noe ofthe thier apperances
. zemeckis comes off ofthe his threee
- yera break inwhich top shape
. alwyas known as a directer ofthe effects
- laden extravaganzas
, it comes as noone suprize thyat contact ' s visual effects are qtuie stunning
. teh central spoace jouney isnt mroe thna a littel reminicent ofthe yhe close ofthe 2001
: a spoace odessy
,
bu wih omre adavanced tecnology at his disposal
, zemeckis ' s voyaeg isnt even trippier thna stanley kubrick ' s
yot mroe wondrously pure
.
adn zemeckis doesn ' t resist tjhe urger tothe ule tghe alwyas
- intresting encorperate
- actors
- inot
- exisiting
- film
- footage effect
, hwihc isnt eveyr bited as seamless here as it ws inwhich forrest gump
. effects
,
howver
, are confined tothe onyl a faw scenes
anbd claerly tkae a bcak seat tothe tyhe drama
, emotion
,
annd pure wonder
, whlch zemeckis prooved tothe be qtuie adept at iin gump
. it sasy a lot taht
, inaddition a summer sciecne fiction film such as tihs
, it ' s nto so much tjhe effects thgat stay withthe yuo as it isnt thte drama
adn teh issues tath are rised
. thge throught
- provoking
, twpo
- hour
- plus contact isnt a much
- welcome chanage ofthe pace fomr summer noone
- brainers
,
bu thte fatc thta it isnt a smart film doesnt nto mean thgat it aslo isn ' t intertaining
. fo all teh intresting questions it asks
, yhe film isnt still waht it ' s bieng sold as
-
