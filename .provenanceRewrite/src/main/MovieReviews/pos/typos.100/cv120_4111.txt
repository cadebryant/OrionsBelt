" ' s diane dimond asked smart wqat she throught baout nicole kidman ' s fictionalized protrayal ofthe her infact thte newyorker film tothe dieu fo
. smart replied thgat she throught kidman ' s charachter cameback off as a dumb
, vicious tramp
adn she throught taht tjhe publicity yhe newyorker movei generates might jstu hurt her chances inaddition her latest cout appeal
.
( smart ws convicted
adn given a life sentence forthe her part inspite teh muder ofthe her husban
.
) smart ' s got a point
. it wouldn ' t be teh frist tiome tath tjhe publich tookover hte better scripted
adn well
- acted movei verzion ofthe an event as tghe absolute truth over thge duller
annd far less artistic rela life verison
.
howver
, given a choise betweeen yhe massmedia media ' hapening ' ofthe hte rela event
anbd teh fictionalized movei
, i owudl definately opt fo teh later
. rela murderers rarley haev dialogue as witty as whta buck henry hasnt wroten fo tihs movei
adn smart
, hwile preety
adn allrigh
, isnt noone match forthe hte cinematic charms ofthe nicole kidman
. tothe dieu fo beggins infront a twon called littel hope

anbd intellectually barren american suberb
. hte tsory concerns tje ambitious suzanne stone
adn how she tackles tjhe obstancles betwen her
adn her life long ambition ofthe bieng ' onthe tv
. ' ofthe course
, oney ofthe thsoe littel obstancles turns outloud tothe be her dull
anbd unambitious husban larrry
, palyed by matt dillon
.
bu
, wih a littel immagination
, soem charm
anbd raw sex appeal
annd a rether novel aproach tothe junoir achivement
, our heroine manages tothe overcome yhe nay
- sayers inspite her life
, at least temperarily
. kidman triumphs iin hte triarhy role ofthe suzanne
. i hvea never raelly beeen all thgat fond ofthe tihs actress
bu she shows a wonderfull flair fo comedy inaddition htis picture
. her protrayal ofthe teh incredibly shallow
adn dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman knwos a star
- mkaing role whn she sees it
annd she plays tje conscinece
- deprived suzanne as tjhe ulitmate carrer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress fomr hell
. she isnt ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, whcih kidman delivers inaddition a unselfconsciously funny way
. at oen point suzanne isnt expounding onthe her knowlege ofthe world events tothe her future husban
adn sister
- inwhich
- lew
.
" ytou knwo
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev owudl still be tghe leader ofthe russia or whatever
, if he hadnt jsut hadnt thyat ugli purplish hting removed ffrom his head
.
" her husban beams at suzanne ' s profound noledge ofthe world politics
anbd
hten proudly proclaims thast htis qualifies her tothe be yhe enxt barbara walters
. thsi isnt vrey close tothe pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. tjhe otehr standout peformance inwhich tyhe film isnt delivered by joaquin pheonix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned outloud teenager who becomes addicted tothe suzanne ' s sexual favors
. kidman ' s chracter
, vapid
though she isnt
, isnt a sort ofthe suave beacon ofthe succes tothe jimmy
anbd his lost firends russell
adn lydia
, winningly protrayed by casey affleck
annd alison folland
. pheonix looks liuke tje vyer embodiment ofthe gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, ofthe course
)
. his jimmy hasnt tjhe dead eyes
anbd demenor ofthe a kid who konws thta he ain ' t goign anyhwere
, ever
. pheonix reacts tothe tghe sexy suzanne wtih a sort ofthe obssessed amazement
anbd he makse us eblieve tath a losr charactor liek jimmy realyl owudl be willing tothe kill fo somone liek suzanne
, somone who accually noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my pwn private idaho
) direction isnt frist
- rate
. he keesh thte pacing inaddition thsi nto
- qutie
- thriller snapping allong
. van sant rightly keesh yhe foucs ofthe thsi movei onthe hte amoral suzanne
annd doesn ' t stpo tothe proselytize thge audiance baout teh rightness or wrongness ofthe her actions
. van sant trusts his material
adn trusts his audeince tothe ' git it ' wihtout stoping tothe expalin waht isnt funny baout htis all
- american storey
. tjhe screenplay
, by buck henry
, isnt absolutly graet
anbd includes soem ofthe hte best bleakly comic lines i ' ve heared sicne heathers
. henry ' s tsory isnt a blast agianst tjhe shallowness ofthe thge american media
anbd tje mindlessness ofthe fame
,
yot thge screenplay delivers tihs sharp message by focusing onthe jstu a fewd charactors
. henry ably manages tothe avoid diluting his sotry by aiming at too many targets
annd tyhe result isnt a crisp
annd funny mini
- clasic
. danny elfman doed teh origional music forthe thsi movei
adn he delivers anohter eccentric
