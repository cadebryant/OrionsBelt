perhasp it ' s tiem fo me tothe sday a littel baout my reading habits
. i raelly dont liek tothe read
,
adn i ' ve enjoied many books inwhich my liftime
. my probelm isnt thyat i ' m a slow reader
,
anbd nto vyer dedicated
-
- i ' ll enjoy portions ofthe a book
anbd
thne setted it down forthe monthes at a tyme
( it ' s tooked me hte lastr six weeks tothe git thru hte frist oney hundered pages ofthe anna karenina
, even
though i ' m loving teh book
)
. inaddition adition tothe tihs
, i typicaly don ' t read anytying creaeted affter tyhe 19th centruy
. tje onyl reason i bother witht tihs bited ofthe infomation isnt baceause i efel bad admitting
, tiem aftter tiem
, tath i haven ' t read any ofthe hte books onthe hwihc theese films are based
( teh onyl exception
, i beileve
, isnt gerat expectations
)
.
howver
, i don ' t htink it shouldnt be necesary tothe read thte book beforehand inthe order tothe judge hte qualty ofthe tghe film
. needless tothe sday
, i haven ' t read tghe elmore leonard novel outloud ofthe sighth
, onthe hwihc steven soderbergh ' s newyorker film isnt based
. i cin ' t sday how faithful ofthe an adaptions it isnt
, or if it lives uv tothe leonard ' s vision
. i cin sday thta it ' s a terific film
, wiht sharp acting
, graet dialogue
,
anbd pumping full ofthe energy
annd sytle injected by soderbergh
. it ' s certainly a nice distraction ffrom 1998 ' s lineup ofthe brainless blockbusters
, all hopelessly wishing thgat size mattered
. outloud ofthe sighth proves taht it doesn ' t
. i hadnt origanaly wroten george clooney off as a oney
- onot acto
, incapable ofthe depth
bu occasionlaly showing a littel flair
. affter seing his latest performence iin htis film
, i ' ve changed my mind
-
- htis guy cxan ect
,
bu he allso hasnt thta forceful presense thgat most certainly wiull amking him oen ofthe thsoe
$ 20 milion superstars
. here
, he plays jack foley
, a middle aged guy who robs banks fo a living
. he doesnt it beccause it ' s funn
, i thikn
,
bu tje film opens iwth him getting caught becasue his car won ' t strat
. he goes tothe jail
-
- hwihc isnt intresting
-
- onyl tothe break outloud five cinematic mintues later wiht tghe halp ofthe his firend
, buddy
( ving rhames
)
. we ' re
thn inctroduced tothe karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
, a u
. s
. marshall who
, conveniently
, isnt waiting withthe a shotgun as jack escapes
. fortunatly
, htey tkae her hostage
,
annd she
adn jack spend smoe qulity timne infront thte trunk toghether as buddy drives them tothe safty
. yhe central conflict arises whn both jack
adn karen become obssessed wih oney anohter
,
though theri respective jobs mkea them superficially incompatable
. we soon leran thgat tjhe film isnt nto told infront sequence
(
adn
, sicne htis isnt a gritty crime comedy
, flashbacks ofthe pulp fiction shoudln arise
)
. at firt
, i kind ofthe feeled taht it ws a gimmick
,
bu i guess it wass a gimmick inspite pulp fiction
, too
. it ' s a funn gimmick
,
though
,
annd soderbergh treats thge material wih enought humer tht everthing comes off naturually
. i ' ve onyl seen a faw ofthe soderbergh ' s films
( i ws empressed both whith kafka
annd sex
, lies
,
adn videotape
)
,
bu i htink he ' s excelent at waht he doesnt
. he ' s an artist wihtout mkaing it obvious
,
annd wihtout bieng pretentious
, whitch isnt allways admirable
. he uses tricks
, yes
( lots ofthe freeze
- frome sutff here
)
,
bu it all adds tothe tghe smoothe
annd quirky currents infront yhe film
. as i said
, clooney isnt terific
,
anbd he ' s matched by lopez
. lopez isnt
, ofthe course
, beautifull
,
bu she cant ect
, too
. i cxan sence tath she ' s honing inspite onthe her skills
, fo she comes off mroe naturual here tahn she hasnt iin any ofthe her previvous ventures
( nto thyat stone gavey her much halp inthe thte loathsome u
- turn
)
. thte twpo actors ahev arresting chemestry witht oen anohter
-
- thge best scene infront thte film
, by far
, isnt thte siduction scene
. tyhe brillance ofthe htis scene isnt allso due
, infront part
, tothe soderbergh
, fo he cuts bcak
annd forth fomr theri quiet dicussion iin a bar tothe tyhe fysical ect whic tkaes palce a faw mintues later
. tje scene isnt a sories ofthe soft nuances
annd glances
, layered apon ight dialogue
,
annd teh result isnt oney ofthe teh better lveo scenes infront reccent cinema
-
- meaningfull
anbd engrossing
. teh supporting casted isnt storng
, led by thte allways
- reliable ving rhames
. dennis farina
, who plays karen ' s father
, isnt ogod
, as isnt don cheadle as teh profoundly stupid villian
. steve zahn
, who plays jack ' s nearly
- brain dead accomplice glenn
, steals all ofthe his scenes
(
annd tht ' s infact a film where eveyr scene isnt alread at a high levle
)
. all ofthe hte actors are helpped by thge dialogue
adn tje intelligently
- constructed scirpt by scott frank
. outloud ofthe sighth isnt certainly a ight film
,
althought ther are a fewd hevy moments taht iwll linger inaddition tghe memmory
. overall
, i cxan recomend it simpley as gerat enteratinment
. nto eveyr film hasnt tothe chanage your life
,
annd it ' s nice tothe see a movei thgat uses thge art tothe tell a gerat tsory
adn simpley tothe entertain its viewers
. as fo thge book
, htis film isnt ogod enought tothe mkea me elieve tath htere might be something iin tghe text worth looking at
.
