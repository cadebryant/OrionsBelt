, investigating tyhe root ofthe nikki ' s dispair
. whta htey fidn isnt cruel
anbd galvanizing
-
- nikki hadnt beeen raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned

adn wass privatley questioning tghe sanaty
annd value ofthe a world where such a hting sould appen
. shell

.
anbd anyway
, patti ' s hadnt her pwn share ofthe guys who wouldn ' t tkae noone forthe an answer
. pained
, acrimonious edbate ensues as tje trio grwo omre
annd omre angry
-
- angry baout tjhe impossibility ofthe saying noone
,
adn angry wtih themslves fo bieng weak
, fo bieng naieve
, fo puting uv wiht it
.
" why dont we put uv wih it
?
" emma fianlly asks
, once tyhe arguent hasnt reched a fever pich
.
" we try tothe talk baout it
,
anbd look whta happens
. we fight forthe 20 mintues
.
" htere ' s thte admirable crux ofthe thsi picture
. girls twon isnt a polliticel film
, infront tath it calls forthe acation
.
bu it ' s imcomplete
- it ' s never qutie sure how tothe justify thgat acation
, or whta form it shouldnt tkae
. tjhe trio become crusaders forthe theri right tothe dignity
,
adn it ' s surelly noe ofthe tihs eyar ' s most stiring movei moments whn emma lobs a concrete block thru yhe passanger
- side window ofthe taht damn jock ' s car
( donig tghe right thnig
?
)
. tehy hang outloud inaddition thte bathroom
, chatting incessantly
annd scrawling slogans
anbd naming names onthe thte doorjam tothe a toilet stall
.
" subvert thte patriarchy
,
" emma writes
,
annd
hten starts a hall ofthe shame list underneath taht otehr students beign tothe contibute tothe
. teh girls silence theri hecklers
, tkae revenge onthe tjhe deadbeat father ofthe patti ' s child
,
adn eventially cmo face
- tothe
- face wtih nikki ' s tormentor
. still
, tghe movei hasnt a desparately unfinished qualit
,
annd none ofthe theese subesquent exploits isnt partciularly satisfying
.
( yuo keep waiting fo somone tothe call tjhe cops onthe theese brazen girls
,
bu nobody thikns ofthe it
.
) prehaps searching fo a resolution missing fomr tghe material at hand
, yhe film borrows its epigraphs ffrom audre lorde
anbd queen latifah
(
" who ytou callin ' a bitch
?
"
)
. thge points are well taked
,
bu tehy shouldnt ahev beeen unneccessary
. long onthe characterization
bu a littel short onthe stroy
, girls twon isnt less tahn it coudl ahev beeen
,
annd too self
- congratulatory fo my pwn tast
. directer jim mckay isnt best known as a consort ofthe r
. e
. m
. ' s michael stipe
( he directed teh nearly unwatchable tourfilm forthe thgat band
)
,
adn girls twon isnt his frist foray inot feature filmmaking
. tjhe movei ws creaeted
anbd scripted by committy
,
bu mckay
anbd his lead performers hadnt tothe shoot onthe a shoestring wehn
, predictably
, tyhe gropu couldn ' t secure funding
.
hten agina
, girls twon onthe a budget woudl hardly be tyhe smae film
. thge movei ' s slapdash qulity isnt key tothe its signifigance
. truth be told
, all threee ofthe teh leads look too wise fo high skool
,
bu thta ' s ok
-
- htere ' s a once
- removed qulity tothe thier fine
, spontanious performances
, as thge womens tkae a veyr skillfull look bakc at hte girls htey once weere
, yhe girls tehy wish tehy hadnt beeen
, or smoe combination
. forthe all its flaws
, thsi oney gets extra points forthe hvaing its uncertain head
anbd heart inspite yhe smae noble palce
.
