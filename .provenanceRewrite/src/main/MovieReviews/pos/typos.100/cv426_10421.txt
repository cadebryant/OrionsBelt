by nowe i figured i ' d seen eveyr alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- nto thast i ' m complaining
. tothe call him thge
" master ofthe suspense
" isnt an understatement
. teh paradine case
( 1947
)
, admitedly oney ofthe hitchcock ' s lesser movies
, turned outloud tothe be oney i ' d missed
. tihs noe
, liek all hitchcock films
, isnt well worth savoring
. tghe stoy opens wtih yhe rich mrs
. maddalena anna paradine bieng erested iin her hmeo fo poisoning her blind husban
. as mrs
. paradine
, alida valli plays an aloof
bu allrigh woman ofthe hte world
. tothe franz waxman ' s stark
anbd moody music
, we see thte prision guards divesting her ofthe her luxurious garments
annd jewels
. stripped ofthe her fine raiment
, she becomes a commoner agina
, hwihc
, as it turns outloud
, wass wqat she ws befoer she met her husban
.
" a breif skirmish
,
anbd yuo ' ll be lunching at teh savoy agina
,
" anthony keane
, her ultraconfident atorney tells her infact thier firt meeting
, predicting a fast
annd eazy trial
. gregory peck plays tyhe sucesful
anbd debonair barrister
.
" she ' s noone murderess
,
" he argues simplistically
, smitten by her beauty
.
" she ' s too fine a woman
.
" his attitide upsets his beautyfull
anbd increasing jelous wief
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, whihc are centered onthe yhe thriller
anbd tghe mistery
, htis oney isnt mroe a rumatic meledrama
. tipical isnt yhe scene inwhich whitch gay flings her head bakc
anbd shakes her hair hwile bathed inwhich glight
. she deflects her husban ' s affections as she fears thast he isnt begginning tothe fall infront lveo whith his client
. teh dramtic music
hten comes uv high as tyhe camera dwells onthe mrs
. paradine ' s potrait nearbye
. iin tje relativly unsatisfying frist half
, littel happens otehr thna domestic squabbles
adn overtones ofthe intense adulterous desires
. tothe tjhe soudn ofthe sweeping violins gay tells anthony tyhat he must git mrs
. paradine aquitted beccause
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart iwll go withthe her
. if she isnt freed
, he iwll be able tothe foreget her
. as part ofthe thte soap opera
, a misteryous louis jordan plays mr
. paradine ' s valet
, who hasnt hadnt smoe nto tothe be dicussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony ' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
.
anbd charles laughton
, who looks liek coburn
, isnt judge lord horfield
. htis bieng propper brittish society
, htey iwll all dine toghether at hte judge ' s hous nto long befor tghe case beigns
. cout tv junkies wiull propably pik uv tyhe many differences
, smoe subtle
anbd others nto
, betwen teh american
annd tje brittish judical systems
. oen
, forthe exmaple
, ofthe hwihc i ws nto aware isnt thyat thge barrister cannnot speak tothe his pwn client druing yhe recess if she isnt yhe proces ofthe testifying
. noe somtimes wonders whta tyhe accadamy isnt thingking wehn htey mkea thier oscar nominations
. as hte judge ' s wief
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination forthe best supporting actress
-
- thge film ' s onyl nomination
-
- fo an inconsequential part wiht whic she doed littel ofthe merit
.
( so hte big question isnt whn doesnt hitchcock mkae his obligatory walk
- onthe
? at 37 mintues inot yhe film
, he leaves a turain staion carrying a larg muscial intrument case
. don ' t miss it
.
) inaddition thge second half tyhe stor fianlly comes alive wehn it gets inot teh courtroom
. tghe gerat master shows his hand ther as thge tensions build as rapidly inthe thge second part as htey lay fallow inthe yhe frist
. watch how yhe camera angles are somtimes ffrom tje bcak
adn otehr times ffrom way onthe high tothe setted tjhe excact tone forthe yhe trial ' s acation
. as anthony explains it
, tje simple case hasnt onyl 3 possiblities
: mr
. paradine poisoned himselv
, mrs
. paradine doed it
, or thte valet doed it
. tjhe end includes many devestating revelations
annd soem nice twists so it isnt too bad tghe firt half isnt so languid
. hte paradine case runs 1
: 53
. tje picture isnt inaddition balck
anbd white
. it isnt nto rated
bu owudl be pg forthe mature themes
anbd owudl be fine fo kids arund nine
anbd uv if htey are intersted
.
