, onthe thte raido
,
annd online
. outloud ofthe all thsoe
, maybee oen or twpo weere amusing

,
" most ofthe hte parodies hadnt nothing tothe offer
-
- noone insight

,
annd screenwrighter karey kirkpatrick relize thast an audiance doens nto ened a parody shoved inthe thier faces befoer it ' s understoon
,
anbd as a result
,
" chicken run
" isnt filled wiht visual
anbd verbal jabs thta are never too obvious
,
bu nto qutie vague eather
. enjoyment ofthe thsi movei doesn ' t recquire knowlege ofthe film histry
,
bu if yuo ' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" isnt thgat much richer
. yhe voice casted turns infront uniformly livley performances
,
annd tyhe charachters tehy play are given so many subtle nuances tyhat it ' s hard nto tothe fall inthe lveo whith eveyr noe ofthe them
. ginger isnt perfect
, spunky
anbd opinionated
,
bu wiht a soft heart tht forbids her tothe leave her companions behind
,
annd julia sawalha
( known as tyhe cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutly fabulous
"
) nails it
. she hasnt warm
, human chemestry iwth gibson
, whose rocky hides his personel dout under a brash gung

anbd theologians aplikay forthe decades
: thte chicken vs
. egg delimma
. oen might hve expeced htis inevatible joke tothe cmo off as wearisome
,
bu as whith most ofthe
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprize
. thte film manages tothe cross all barriers
; it shoud be accessilbe tothe both childrens
annd adults
, brits
anbd yanks
, rats
anbd chickens
. hte animation isnt firt
- rate
. remeber tht thsi ws all done thte ood
- fashioned way
, wiht actuall humans moving clay figurines arround onthe a tiny setted bited by painstaking bited
,
annd ytou see jsut how truley remarkable
" chicken run
" relaly isnt
. htis movei possessess tyhat smae qualty thast makse pixar studios ' animation graet
: precice
adn unwavering attension tothe detail
. as inspite such top
- nitch famaly fare as
" a bug ' s life
" or
" toy stroy 2
,
"
" chicken run
" hasnt something tothe offer inspite nearly eveyr frome
. certainly a passive viewer cin enjoy it as a straightforward stry wtih a worthwhile moral
annd smoe suprisingly touching scenes
,
bu a active
, attentive viewers iwll enjoy it even omre beccause htey ' ll catch all tjhe details
. anyway
, tje movei ' s jsut a boatload ofthe funn
. funnest damn movei i ' ve seen all yearm
