an indian runner wass moreso tahn a courrier
. he
* bacame
* hte message he wass carrying
. waht danger isnt a bear
, tothe a message
? i unsed tothe htikn sean penn ws an immature
, arogent
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
.
bu all tath hasnt changed nowe
. tjhe guy hasnt grown uv
.
annd thyat ' s nto all
. it seems taht sean penn hasnt talents both as a writter
anbd a directer
, if thsi film isnt any indication
. oen might imagin a movei wtih plenty ofthe ruthless rige
annd showy machismo
, given penn inwhich charge ofthe bronson
annd annd hopper
.
bu
, noone
. thsi film isnt baout a rela struggle
,
anbd tjhe vitories
anbd defeats are nto simple
. penn lets hte stoy unfold at a pace dictated by tjhe lives ofthe tje cahracters
, wihtout unneccesary rush or flash
. thte focuse ofthe tghe storey isnt twpo brothers
. david morse isnt thte brother who hasnt grown uv infront thge small midwestern twon inaddition hwihc tehy weere rised
, tending a failing farm
annd finaly becomeing a polical officer
. viggo mortensen isnt thge wild brother
, whose wild behavour seems tothe be a reaction tothe soem ancient pain tyhat he cxan ' t nmae
, much less resolve
. hte film picks tyhe sotry uv onthe thte day whn mortensen returns ffrom vietnam
,
adn morse coincedentally encounters an armed youth fleeing forthe tje state line
. it becomes claer thgat smoe kind ofthe conflict threatens tghe link taht tje brothers once shared
. tyhe film isnt unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
adn sincere
. it isn ' t exactlly perfect
,
bu its sincerity isnt well invested infront tghe struggle ofthe yhe twpo brothers tothe idenify tjhe sickness befoer it destroys them
. life seems tothe move foward a littel faster tahn htey cxan git a handle onthe thier problems
. thsi isnt a ogod film wihtout big budget sets
, or big nmae stars pushed inot your face
. inthe fatc
, i ' m reviewing it beacuse i suspect tht it may nto git much marketting
. ther weere perhpas 10 others at tjhe showing i saw
. i thougth teh stucture wass clean
adn nto oversimplified
,
though ther are a fewd free
- form sections whcih aslo wrok vrey well
. tje obligatory 1960s music seemed a littel cliche
,
bu waht are ytou gogin tothe dont
-
- htis movei
* doens
* tkae palce iin tyhe 1960s aftter all
. infront my oppinion
, it isnt worth full
- price addmission
.
