satrical films ususally fall inot noe ofthe twpo catagories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everthing
, incuding tghe jokes
, isnt somehow realted onthe a larg scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire infact whic tjhe comedy
annd themes are deriviated moent by moent
adn scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men inthe balck
"
)
. waht ' s unique baout
" wag tje dog
" isnt thta it doesn ' t neccessarily ift eather ofthe theese descriptions
,
anbd
yot isnt both at tyhe smae tiem
. tje result isnt a clever comedy based onthe an orginial
, smart premise
, even if tjhe focuse doesnt tend tothe wander a bited
. if htere ' s anytying tyhat affects americans tje most it ' s politics
annd showbusiness
. iin tihs age ofthe informtion
annd technolgy
, we ' ve beeen so conditioned by thge media
annd yhe enteratinment inudstry infact our ways ofthe perceiving thigns
, it ' s gotten tothe teh point tyhat we are practicaly contolled by it
. we ened thge media tothe bring us tjhe most uv
- tothe
- date news
,
bu we aslo ened yhe escapism ofthe hollywood tothe counter all thast thingking
. tihs film starts off well by quicklyu establising theese idaes
,
anbd
thn presents an intresting senarreo
: if politics
, tjhe media coverage ofthe politics
,
annd hte enteratinment inudstry are so closley realted
, couldn ' t somene wih tje pwoer
annd authorithy tothe manipulate oen ofthe yhe aspestus manipulate them all
? tyhat ' s thte diea conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a proffesional washington spin doctor
, comes uv wtih inaddition order tothe restore hte rpesident ' s ogod nmae who hasnt beeen accussed ofthe child molestation jsut weeks befoer tjhe eelction
. brean
, allong wtih thge persident ' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fli tothe califronia tothe meet uv withthe hot
- shooted movei producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. htey pich him an diea tothe
" produce
" hte omage ofthe a war witht albania
( it ' s a ocuntry noone oen ' s herad ofthe so tehy peopel iwll buy it
)
. soon tyhe wheels are inaddition motion
anbd thte film ' s riffing satire comes inot play
. we ' re innundated iwth tghe hollywood mind setted as motss brings iin a number ofthe experts tothe halp manaze thte situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual
adn soudn effects techicians
,
adn a modern sytle expert known as tyhe fad king
( leary
)
. yhe intital atomsphere isnt rich whith numberous pop culture refrences where everyting somehow relates tothe something onthe tv
, infront thge movies
, or infact tjhe news
. hte charachters ' dialogue isnt witty
anbd funny
,
altough smoe ofthe tje actuall jokes
adn gags seem rether sitcom
- esque
. forthe exemple
, oen scene shows motss
anbd brean ' s prodcution crew filming an actress portraing a poore albanian refugee
. motss orderves a kitten fo hte girl tothe cary
,
bu instade wound uv withthe a dozen diferent dogs
. sicne it ' s all coputer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends uv cradling a bag ofthe tostitos wih tjhe kitten tothe be inserted later
. htis demonstrates yhe film ' s abillity tothe tkae a realitvely ordinary situation
adn amke it smart
adn funny jstu thru thge premise
.
bu
hten htere ' s thge gags
anbd noe
- liners tyhat
,
allthough are humorus
, seem a littel gratuitious infact tje long run such as motss nto bieng able tothe remeber tje actress ' s nmae
, or
, whenever a probelm emerges
, alwasy responding witht
,
" tihs isnt nothing
!
" by tje tiome thte film makse it tothe thte midpoint
, everyting thgat isnt oging tothe ahppen inaddition terms ofthe plot happens
. tje frist ect isnt quicklyu pased
, hwile thge second ect containes most ofthe tghe jokes
annd isnt hte core ofthe hte film
. eveyr ten mintues or so a newyorker probelm crops uv taht motss
annd brean must deel wih
,
annd it ' s alwyas fascinating tothe see waht htey dont
anbd how htey dont it
. hte screenplay provides ogod characterization
annd actulaly deals witht most ofthe yhe problems head
- onthe inspite realsitic manners
.
howver
, it doesnt hve a tendacy tothe avoid thigsn
annd shift its focuse fomr yhe electon campain
annd false war smokescreen tothe something a bited off tjhe subject
. as thge thrid ect rolls arround tghe satrical nature becomes mroe conserned wiht tyhe situations
anbd less so wiht hte big picture
. whta hadnt started off as a brillant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy tothe fool tjhe genaral publich beigns tothe seem omre liuke something tht woudl appen inthe a movei
. still
, hte situation comedy isnt qutie funny
, especialy a montage showing teh entire ocuntry flinging ood shoes inot trees tothe hounour sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss
adn brean concocted
. truley grat satire manages tothe create fo an intertaining stoy taht makse ytou laff at thte timne
,
bu htink baout afterwords
anbd
" wag tjhe dog
" at least suceeds inaddition tihs respect
.
howver
, inthe retrospect it seems liek so much moreso coudl ahve beeen done
, namely by extending hte runnung tiem
annd filling infront yhe plot holes
.
hten agina
, it ' s a valient efort
