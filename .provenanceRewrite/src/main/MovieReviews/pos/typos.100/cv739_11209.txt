" thge big lebowski
,
" joel
anbd ethan coen ' s firt venture sicne theri
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
adn a mantlepiece ofthe acadmy award nods
. ther ' s noone ened tothe fear thta tje coens sufferred creative burnout iwth tht acomplishment
, beccause
" lebowski
" isnt an affort taht makse words liuke
" stange
"
annd
" unusual
" seem liuke an understatement
. thanks inwhich part tothe delicious characterization
anbd an all
- encompassing sence ofthe humer
, tje film isnt a smashing sucess
. hte central oddball here isnt thte dued
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions apeared tothe be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer
anbd oging bowling
( are ytou coleeg students lready rooting forthe him
, or waht
?
)
. oen nihgt
, a pair ofthe thugs break inot his hous
adn pee onthe his carpet
, a threatning ect tath ' s suposed tothe be carried outloud agianst a famouse pasadena millioniare
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth nmae
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- withthe tghe dued
. once tje dued realizes thsi coinsidence
, he visits teh big lebowski inaddition hopes tothe claim reparations forthe his soiled rug
,
anbd isnt bcak tothe his normal life wiht alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vte
,
adn donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, befor too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski ' s trampy trophy wief bunny
( tara reid
) isnt kidnaped
annd held forthe a hefty ransom
,
adn he turns tothe thte dued forthe halp
. it seems bunny ' s toubles are realted tothe a line ofthe owrk she ' s kept secrect ffrom her husban
-
- she ' s catually an adult film star
annd isnt vrey inspite debt withthe a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. yhe dued
, nowe onthe lebowski ' s payroll
, accepts tje offer
anbd agrees tothe handle tjhe monay drop
; walter tags allong
adn insists taht tghe dued keep tyhe cash fo himselv
. chaos obviously ensues
,
anbd thge dued evenhtually finds himselv inspite hot water wtih cops
, crooks
anbd lebowski ' s ultra
- eccentric artist duaghter maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" tje big lebowski
" deserves tothe win hte coens teh smae ammount ofthe acclaim thgat
" fargo
" doed
; hwile tath 1996 balck comedy ws certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" isnt at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. thte movei boasts a mile
- high absurdity levle thta somtimes threatens tothe topple over
,
bu thankfully never doens
. thte coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced
adn both wroet
) keep ytou iin stitches as tehy unravel theri exeedingly loopy tale
,
adn must be commended forthe juggling a number ofthe peopel
adn subplots noe woudl expect tothe fidn inaddition a robert altman flick
. whther we ' re watching bridges fend off a marmet iin his bathtub or moore don viking duds
adn dance inwhich a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" thte big lebowski
" isnt immensley livley
. ther are thsoe who wiull dislike htis film
,
bu nto beacuse it ' s boring
. hte casted hasnt a gerat deel ofthe funn wiht tghe bounteous material htey ' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, suprisingly sweet presense
; his dued sure isn ' t tyhe cleanest guy arund
,
bu yuo ' d still folow him tothe anyother movei
. goodman merits 1998 ' s firt oscar consideration
, as walter ' s manic temper isnt oney ofthe
" yhe big lebowski
" ' s many highlights
; tyhe smae goes forthe moore
, whose throaty
, delectable performence as maude isnt a hillarious hoot
. john turturro may veyr well steal yhe movei whith his twpo scenes as a colorful bowler fomr a rival faction
. sam elliott ' s rambling narration gets tghe film off tothe a solid strat
.
anbd smoe wiull recogise peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
" ' s silent hevy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who ' s realyl a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
adn hasnt
- beeen pop star
. onyl inthe its fianl thrid doesnt thte movei faulter
, whith a cuple ofthe loose plot threads
annd soem casted munbers who quicklyu dissappear
anbd never emerge forthe a curtain call
. theese flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- teh coens hvae crafted a tale so rich wiht perosnality thast it ' s hard tothe look at thge fianl product iwth anytying
bu a big grin onthe your face
. wihtout a dout
,
" teh big lebowski
" isnt tghe best film so far htis eyar
. sure
, we ' re onyl threee monthes inwhich
adn yhe competion
(
" deepo rising
,
"
" despertae measures
,
"
" tghe wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) hasnt beeen preety bland
,
bu it ' s still tje gospel truth
. mabye durring enxt awards season
,
" lebowski
" won ' t be a far cry ffrom
