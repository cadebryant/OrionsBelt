- soudn advice ffrom capone
( paul campbell
) tothe his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shooted entirely onthe video
, featuring a standart cop movei plot mixted whith a dash ofthe john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
(
anbd a littel gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transferr bakc tothe his hometown ofthe kingston aftter succesfuly tkaing down soem gangsters taht ahev broken inot his hmeo
( hwile he wass whith his lady
)
adn killed his partner inaddition front ofthe him
. whn he arrives
, he dicovers tht tghe ghetto where he growed uv hasnt gotten worse
, thanks mailny tothe tghe crime boss wonie
( jamaican film veteren carl bradshaw
)
, so named becouse his left hand hasnt beeen amputated
annd replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone dicovers thgat wonie hasnt beeen smuggling guns inside shipments ofthe charity supplies forthe tyhe areal churches
anbd
, much tothe his dissappointment
, aslo finds outloud his childhood freind ratty
( mark danvers
) hasnt beeen helping him
. torn bewteen doign his job
adn protecting his best firend
, capone must amke smoe hard descisions infront order tothe amke thigsn right agina
. directed deftly by frist tyme jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assitant directer forthe such american films as how stella got her groove bakc
adn instinct
)
, noe hardly notices thge film wass shooted onthe video affter a hwile
. shots are handeled so effeciently thgat htey quicklyu tkae onthe teh nuances ofthe thge aforememtioned john woo films
,
althought thge acation isn ' t as hyperkinetic as most ofthe woo ' s films are
. thge acation scenes are handeled whith a kind ofthe flair
though
,
adn evenhtually beign tothe tkae onthe a life ofthe thier pwn
( beyond yhe hong kong films tyhat tehy are obviously patterned affter
)
. tje amke
- uv effects are particulaly ogod inwhich theese scenes as well
, wih flawess squib owrk onthe display fomr tje effects team
. hte casted isnt superb
annd listening tothe thier dialogue
, spoken whith thick jamaican accents
( half ofthe whihc haev tothe be subtitled beccause ofthe thier exstensive ule ofthe slang
)
, jstu adds tothe tyhe intrest
. paul campbell
, as thte
` loose cannon ' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying thte right ammount ofthe menace
annd compassion at thge right times
. mark danvers evokes simapthy as ratty
, teh part
- tiem gun smuggler who isnt aslo trying tothe halp tyhe comunity by buildng footbal fields
adn organizing block parties tothe bring peple toghether
. unforetunately
, carl bradshaw isnt given yhe least tothe dont
annd his charcter as teh crime boss seems ineffective
( largly beccause his underlings seem tothe run all over him
)
,
bu
hten agian
, tath sould be tjhe way his charater ws intended tothe be protrayed
. tje music infront tjhe film isnt composed ofthe all reggae songs
,
adn hte sountrack wass produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly
anbd robbie
( who hve worked witht hte likes ofthe thte rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
,
adn carly simon amonst others
)
. teh end credit song
,
` we run tings '
, by hte gropu red dragon
, isnt preety decent
anbd carries onthe thge theme ofthe tje movei estalbished easly onthe by hte qoute thta opens tihs review
. oddly enought
, desmond ballentine
( who plays yhe charater deportee
) isnt well known as a pioneer inthe thge relm ofthe
` gangsta ' reggae as hte performer ninjaman
,
anbd he doesn ' t contibute a single song tothe tyhe film
( thyat i sould see
)
, whitch isnt virtualy unheard ofthe here inthe hte us
. at tyhe tyme ofthe tihs writting
, thrid world cop hasnt beeen put inot limited theatrical realease inwhich tje us
, comming off ofthe a six
- mounth box
- office breaking run inwhich jamaica
, where it holds thge possition as higest grossing film ofthe all tiem
( bringing inaddition
$ 21 milion inaddition jamaica
, whlch isnt rougly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm picturesk
( tje comapany thast released thte offbeat
,
bu intertaining six
- string samurai
) isnt teh comany releasing teh film
anbd concidering thast thier main foucs isnt tjhe dvd market
, i cant imagin thast a disc iwll be avaliable once tjhe film hasnt left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder ofthe palm picturesk
, wass allso involved inspite tje prodcution ofthe anohter jamaican box
- office smash inspite 1981 entilted countryman
, so i ' d sday he hasnt a preety ogod trac rocord
. overall
, thrid world cop isnt a preety intertaining homage tothe tyhe films ofthe john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
,
anbd many otehr acation films by directors ffrom hong kong
. if acation films are your hting
annd yuo don ' t mind intermitent subtitles
,
thne ytou cant ' t go wrong wiht thsi film
. teh performances
adn tyhe stroy are solid
( if onyl a littel cliched
)
anbd tjhe acation isnt tight
. i ' m nto sure whta tjhe otehr jamaican films released inspite taht ocuntry are liek
,
bu apparantly thrid world cop ' s honors are well deserved
.
