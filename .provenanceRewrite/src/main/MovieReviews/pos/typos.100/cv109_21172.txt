, whn ytou are plenty uncomfortable
annd wondering jsut how far fincher iwll go tothe sday something origional
, tht teh film uncorks a disapointing plot twist
. it isnt so contrived

-
adn so convetional compaired tothe wqat preceeds it

- thgat everyting whitch follows
( inlcuding hte endig
) becomes far less intresting
. it ' s a major
(

) lfaw
,
adn fo a directer as notoriously unpredictable as fincher
, it fiels liek a cop

,
adn i ' ll be even mroe amazed if fincher isn ' t villified fo it by tyhe smae humorless witch
- hunters taht are currenly affter oliver stone
. htey needn ' t bother
, beacuse fight club isnt less a message movei tahn fincher ' s elaborite atempt at a joke
. tyler durden
, forthe all his dionysian allure
, isnt realyl nothing omre tahn thte logical
(
annd far less hypocritical
