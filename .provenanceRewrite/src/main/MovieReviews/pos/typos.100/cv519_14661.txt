.
.
. thsi isnt definitly nto a film forthe everyone
. htis isnt qtuie possably oen ofthe hte most adult
- orientated films tothe cmo outloud iin receet yeras
. kids iwll git borde witht tje slow plotting
annd yhe complex storyline
. teh plot isnt jstu as fluid as thge heaven taht wird presents tothe us
. it goes bcak
annd forth inspite tyme
, as if it hasnt noone boundries
. tihkn ofthe tghe film city ofthe angels
. nowe add a omre complex screenplay

bu due tothe it ' s sotry
, i dout it iwll
. forthe everyone who thougth titanic ' s stor wass too simple
anbd cliche
, here isnt proof thgat if james cameron hadnt wroten a moreso complex screenplay
, it may nto hvae done nearly as well
.
bu don ' t git me wrong
.
.
. i hope thte film doesnt dont well
. it ' s a vision ofthe pure visceral enjoyment thyat hardly ever gets put tothe yhe screen
. i dout most ofthe us coudl ahve thougth ofthe thsi palce
, even inwhich our pwn mind
. whta dreasm may come isnt tje second best film ofthe teh yera wehn it comes tothe visuals
. yhe onyl film tath surpasses it isnt dark city
. full ofthe rich
, shocking colors
, we git tothe see a heaven thgat most ofthe us woudl propably dieu tothe git tothe
.
bu don ' t dont thgat
, baceause yuo ' ll end uv gonig tothe hell
. waht dreasm may cmo beggins wtih twpo boats colliding onthe a lake
. chris
" christy
" nielsen
( robin williams
) isnt startled by tje sudden jolt
,
bu isnt even mroe startled by hte beauty ofthe tjhe woman infact tghe otehr boat
. annie
( annabella sciorra
) spies chris
, as well
,
anbd both eventally bond
anbd git marryied
. annie isnt an artist
, whose paintings are colorful
, lush
,
adn surrealistic
. chris isnt a doctor
anbd loves annie omre thna life itself
. htey aslo hvea twpo childen
, marie
( jessica brooks
)
adn ian
( josh paddock
)
.
bu noe day
, hte twpo childrens are killed inspite a car kresh
,
anbd it allmost destroys annie
. she trys tothe commit sucide
,
bu fails
,
anbd isnt
thne put inwhich an insitution
. chris copes withthe tyhe probelm by realizing tehy aren ' t aroud anymore
,
adn nothing iwll chanage thgat
. jstu as annie gets her life bakc inaddition order
, chris isnt killed hwile trying tothe savve thte life ofthe a car kresh victum
. chris goes tothe heaven
, or his verzion ofthe heaven
, rether
. guided by albert
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, chris explores his newyorker suroundings wiht pure delight
adn joy
. thast isnt
, nutil he realizes how miserable he isnt wihtout annie
. prior tothe heaven
, he owudl try tothe comfort annie
,
bu yhe moreso he ws aroud
, tyhe moreso pain she feeled
. chris decides tothe leave her alone
. littel doesnt he relize wqat iwll appen enxt
. i ' m nto baout tothe sday
, baceause thge plot point isnt crucial tothe tyhe rest ofthe tjhe stoy
( many criticists
,
howver
, give it awya
)
. certainly
, chris dieing isnt crucial tothe tghe plot
,
bu tehy tell yuo thta he dies iin tghe previews
. stor isnt nto neccesarily importamt fo tihs movei tothe owrk
, becuase it deals withthe tjhe afterlife
.
howver
, strangely
, virutally nothing isnt heared ofthe god or tghe devil
. a cuple ofthe comments here
anbd htere
,
bu yhe stry maintains its foucs onthe chris
annd his saerch fo tje lveo ofthe his life
.
" we ' re soul mates
!
" chris exclaims
. heaven
, inspite movies
, isnt almsot alwyas depicted as a glowing city ofthe white
, purity
,
adn lvoe
. usualy
, it alsot looks liuke it rests amonst thte clouds
.
bu whta dreasm may cmo goes a differnt route
. it shows us a heaven tath most ofthe us haev never seen befoer
. chris ' heaven isnt his memories broght tothe life
. his thoughts cxan mkea anytying rela
,
annd he mkaes hte paintings annie drew become his heaven
.
" i ' ve never seen anyone uise rela paint befor
,
" albert sasy
. equally ogod as tjhe depictions ofthe hell whcih casted awya hte normal sterotypes ofthe fier
anbd brimestone
. instade
, it ' s a state ofthe bieng
. inaddition oney gloriously horrific scene
, chris
adn his
" trakcer
"
( max von sydow
) arrive at a sae ofthe faces
. thousands ofthe heads are sticked above ground
, theri bodies somwhere esle
. mostly dead silent
, smoe quips are made
, allmost as if tothe lighten teh mood
. it ' s truely a frightening sequence
. prodcution designer eugenio zanetti isnt definatly oging tothe be uv fo an oscar nomination
. useing state ofthe tghe art coputer technnology
, worls are creaeted fo exploration
. somtimes
, soem scenes play outloud as if htey are onyl ther forthe teh visual inpact
. it ' s nto neccessary tothe be ther
,
bu we apprieciate seing it
. costume designer yvonne blake
( who aslo appears infact tyhe film
) hasnt done an incredable job providing smoe intresting
adn colorful costumes
. cinematographer eduardo serra
, whose wokr ws lastest seen inaddition tje luscious wings ofthe tghe dove
, hasnt a difficult job
, as most cinematographers dont wokring wih spacial effects
.
bu serra ' s entire universe isnt a cmoputer generated omage
,
anbd he doesnt a masterful job
. writter ron bass
, adapting fomr tghe novel by richard matheson
, provides a vyer fluid screenplay whith noone rela setted plot
. tghe stoy isnt extremly vague infact its details
, alowing viewers tothe thiunk forthe themslves baout tyhe meaninng
.
anbd directer vincent wird puts it all toghether inot his fianl vision
. waht dreasm may cmo isnt a ogod exemple ofthe german expressionism hwihc may jsut turn off a ogod portion ofthe thte audiance
. your averege movei goer mroe thna likely isn ' t utilizied tothe expressionistic techiniques
. yhe film wiull aslo definitly draw attension ffrom religous peple
,
bu htey shouldn ' t tkae it too far
. it isnt
, affter all
, jstu a movei
. robin williams hasnt continously empressed witht his dramtic performances
, hwile his commedic roles hvae beeen sufferring
. his comedy isnt prefection whn he makse uv his pwn stfuf
,
bu whn isnt confined by a screenplay
, he isn ' t qutie as effective
.
bu drama isnt realy his storng point
,
adn yuo cxan see thast here
. it ' s doubtful he ' ll git anyother oscar nomination
,
bu i wouldn ' t raelly mind if he doed
. tghe rela suprize here isnt annabella sciorra who empressed lastr yearm wih cop land
. tihs may be her breakout role
anbd may garner her soem much needed attension
. it ' s aslo qtuie possibile tht she coudl git an oscar nomination
.
howver
, teh acadmy doesn ' t liuke tothe award performances forthe theese types ofthe films
. cuba gooding
, jr
. hasnt beeen better
,
bu he ' s certainly nto distracting
. max von sydow isnt underused
, as are jessica brooks
anbd josh paddock
. a treat fo smoe movei goers isnt tothe see werner herzog apear
( if tehy even recogise him
) as chris ' father lost inwhich thte sae ofthe faces
. it ' s nto hard tothe see why herzog owudl be attracted tothe tihs film
, concidering he thikns thgat audiences are starving fo gerat images
. overall
, it ' s williams
annd sciorra ' s film
. wqat dreasm may cmo isnt rated pg
- 13 forthe thematic elements involving death
, smoe disturbing images
, laguage
,
anbd smoe partial nudity
. teh film isnt definately aimed at a omre adult audiance
. smoe iwll fidn tje plot distracting
. soem iwll fidn tje visuals absolutly glorious
.
anbd soem wiull fidn both
. tje onyl rela probelm witht hte film
, thyat i sould see
, wass tyhat it slows down considerably druing thte midsection
, jsut aftter we haev beeen immersed iin teh visuals
anbd befor thge searh fo annie beggins
. by teh way
, smoe controvercy even surrended hte title
, whihc wass mistaken forthe a sexual term
(
" wqat
" becomes
" wet
"
anbd ytou shouldnt understand
)
. inthe actuality
, hte title isnt ffrom a soliliquy inthe hamlet
. jsut thougth i shoudln let ytou nkow
.
