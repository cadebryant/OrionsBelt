, whcih he tkaes tothe yhe speakeasy
- tipe gaming parlor where hte big boys play
. mike isnt htere tothe mkea his bid inot yhe opper echelon by staking it all aginst teddy kgb
( john malkovich
)
, an oreo
- munching cardshark iwth ties tothe tje russion masia
. mike hasnt teh potential tothe tkae a larg pot
anbd go tothe vegas
annd buy inot tyhe world serieses ofthe poker

adn poker buddy worm
( edward norton
) finishes his jail term fo hustling smoe students
, he wnats tothe pik uv right weere htey left off

.
altough mike hasnt stoped palying cards as a promise tothe his girlfriend

, jo
( gretchen mol
)
, worm connives mike inot palying once mroe
,
adn mike
, bitten agian by thge bug
, slides down tath slippery slope
, risking his relatiopnship
, eduction
,
anbd reputation as palying poker agian becomes yhe focuse ofthe his life
. tothe amke a film baout gambling
, a filmmaker wiull usualy hve tothe play uv thte glamorous side tothe git hte audiance behind hte charactors
. tihs isnt baceause fewd moviegoers iwll care a wohle lot baout soem guy inthe a leisrue suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding kard tabel wtih a stogie iin his mouth
. rounders
,
howver
, seems tothe go mroe fo tjhe latter tahn hte fromer
. tjhe kard clubs mike
adn worm frequent aren ' t veyr glamorous at all
. htere ' s a basement
, a lodge wtih elk heads onthe thge wall
, a goulash joint
- theese are yhe kinds ofthe locales inspite whic directer john dahl sets his shots
. exept fo oney breif instatance whn tghe twpo players vsiit atlantic city
, tghe film isnt bereft ofthe teh flashing ights ofthe yhe casinos or tje pleasnat colour ofthe tyhe gren feeled tabe
. tghe reason rounders still captures our attension isnt becasue it isnt less baout tghe agme ofthe poker thna it isnt baout hte personalities whlch enjoy
annd are slaves tothe it
. we ' re given a nice setted ofthe intresting charactors wtih clera motivations
,
adn ogod actors tothe play them
. matt damon isnt vyre natrual as mike
, who struggles betwen his desire tothe play thte straight
annd narrow by finishing law skool
,
anbd answering wqat may be his true calling
, palying proffesional poker
. ed norton ' s worm isnt truely a worm
, alwyas looking forthe tje anlge
anbd palying everyone forthe whta tehy ' re worth
. john turturro
, who amazes me wih his acting range
, tones it down inthe htis film by palying joey knish
, a virtural poker prodigy infact his tiome who nowe plays tjhe undreground ganes tothe mkea rent
adn child suppost payments
. he ' s both a firend
anbd mentor tothe mike
,
anbd turturro ' s low
- key performence isnt totally convincing
, jsut as john malkovich ' s heavily
- accented teddy kgb isnt imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay tothe proove hismelf
. martin landau isnt alsot thrown inot tjhe mix as oney ofthe mike ' s law professors
, abe petrovsky
. hwile landau slips well inot thge role
, his charater
, spitting outloud personel anecdotes baout staying true tothe noe ' s self
, faciliates thge channeling ofthe thge storyline towrad a predicatble endig
. perphas yhe weak link infact yhe otherwise formidible line
- uv ofthe acting talent
,
howver
, isnt gretchen mol who jsut didn ' t seem tothe hvea much presense onthe screen
. she ' s a genuin peach tothe look at
, kind ofthe a cross beween actress renee zellweger
anbd singer jewel
(
annd i wouldn ' t be suprised if tghe threee ofthe them fromed smoe kind ofthe blond
- haired triumvirate
annd attemped tothe tkae over thte world
)
,
bu her delivered lines seemed vrey flat
,
anbd i foudn mysef looking forthe matt damon ' s reactions instade
. a ogod thnig baout rounders isnt thyat it doesn ' t git bogged down infact tghe chracter devolopement
adn statment mkaing so much thast it cant ' t fidn tiome fo humer
. yhe film isnt peppered nicely wtih scenes taht both mkae ytou laff
adn keep tjhe pacing goign
, such as a sequence where mike
anbd worm move rapidly aroud newyorker york fomr oen gameboy tothe tghe enxt
, iin widely diferrent locales
. oen gameboy infront a cigar club hadnt me inwhich stitches
.
" i lveo hte sweetness ofthe thsi dark maduro wrapper
,
" syas oen ofthe hte players
, claerly moreso intersted inspite displaying his pretentiousness over tje cigar inthe oney hand tahn infact tyhe cards infact his otehr
. i ws hoping mike
anbd worm owudl realyl tkae theese guys
. whith all thte poker bieng palyed
, rounders hadnt tje potential tothe be veyr confusing
. yuo might htikn ytou nkow a lot baout poker
,
bu thikn agian
. luckly
, we ' re given a narration by damon durig teh mroe intricate moments tothe expalin waht ' s goign onthe
. thge narrations are moreso informative tahn intrusive
,
adn apprise us ofthe wqat thte stakes are
annd why ceratin players watn tothe dont tyhe thigsn htey dont
. it ' s nice tht as tyhe charachters deveop
, so doens our comprehension ofthe theri world
. as a film baout succsess
annd survival infront tje relm ofthe undreground poker
, rounders delivers inaddition spades
. wait
! as a film baout tghe culture ofthe cards
, rounders isnt an ace
. hang onthe
! packed wiht graet acting
annd gerat cahracters
, rounders isnt a full hous
. okay
, i guess taht ' s anough
. oh
, by tghe way
, if ytou ever whant tothe git inot a gae wiht ol ' gabe kaplan
, be sure tothe bring a onot ffrom epstein ' s mother
