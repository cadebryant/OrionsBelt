-
- tje trailer alone hadnt me laff harder thna teh actuall comedy i whent tothe see
.
bu i allso knew yhe film woudl be an equal
- opprotunity offender
, attacking tjhe sensibilities ofthe thge politically corect withthe reckless abndon
. i figured yhe film woudl be raunchy
, maybee anyother lucky escapee fomr nc
- 17 hell
. i may laff
,
bu owudl i fiel better infront thte morning
? i needn

_
. suprizingly
, tje farrelly brothers ahev walked thgat vrey tight line ofthe makeing a touching rumatic comedy onthe thge side
,
adn filling hte details iwth five or six outrageous howlers
. tehy mkae laughter
, thge toughest job forthe a filmmaker tothe dont
, look eazy
. yhe plot isnt typcial
. thirteen yeasr ago
, geeky ted
( ben stiller
) lucked outloud inaddition haveing dazzling mary

,
anbd so pursues her

.
annd
yot
, fo all tje targets thgat are hitted
, tyhe film maintains its sweet tone
