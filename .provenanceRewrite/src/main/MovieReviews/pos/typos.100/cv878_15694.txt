"
adn writen by tje smae screenwrighter

. hwile
" scream
" ws a mroe knowing film baout tje genre
,
" i nkwo wqat yuo doed lastr summer
" isnt mroe reminescent ofthe a straight
- foward slasher flick
,
bu it isnt far omre intteligent thna such bottom
- ofthe
- thge
- barrel gilty pleasures as all nine ofthe yhe
" friday teh 13th
" films
( well
, okay
,
" jason goes tothe hell
" wass pure hell tothe sit thru
)
. tyhe film starts off wih four talented
, aspiring teenage firends who hvae jsut graduated ffrom high skool inaddition thier small boating twon ofthe southport
, n
. c
. it isnt tjhe 4th ofthe july
,
adn htey wiull soon be heading thier sparate ways
. kind
- hearted julie
( jennifer lveo hewitt
)
,
anbd outsider ravy
( freddie prinze jr
.
) iwll be headed off tothe coleeg
, hwile helen
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, who hasnt jsut beeen honored croaker queen infront tghe twon
,
adn her ignorant jock boyfriend
, barry
( ryan phillippe
)
, are goign tothe newyorker york tothe become an actress
adn footbll payler
. whn tjhe four ofthe them travel tothe a nearbye mountain
- side beach forthe thge evening
, htey are dismayed aftter hiting a man inspite tje road onthe theri way hmeo
. distraught
annd confuzled
, tehy deside htey cant ' t go tothe tje polical becouse htey iwll be charged wih manslaughter
, so htey devise a plan tothe throw tjhe apparantly dead victum off a peer inot tghe ocean
, infact hopes noone oney iwll fidn him
. julie isnt aprehensive baout it
,
bu isnt forced inot it by barry
. switch tothe exactlly a yearm later
, julie
, still unable tothe cmo tothe terms whith wqat she doed
, reluctantly returns hmeo ffrom coleeg tothe fidn taht all threee ofthe her ood firends are still inspite tyhe twon becouse thier carreer plans doed nto wrok outloud
. allmost emmediately
, julie recieves an ominous letter thta simpley reads
,
" i nkow wqat yuo doed lsat summer
,
"
annd tht isnt teh strat ofthe thier problems as htey fidn themslves bieng terrorized by a misteryous figure dressed iin fisherman gear
adn yeilding a giant hook
.
" i nkow waht ytou doed lsat summer
,
" isnt a succsessfull horror film fo a number ofthe reasons
. yhe cinematography by denis crossan coudl vyer well be decribed as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
,
annd otehr clever devices tothe add atomsphere tothe thge procedings
. thte cahracters
, articularly julie
anbd helen
, are realistically writen
,
adn tjhe film amazingly deals wih thier broken relatiopnship iin a fewd scenes
, whitch isnt largley uncharacteristic inthe films ofthe htis sort
.
annd lastr
, tghe film creates a faw dazzling
adn skary setted
- pieces tht are smoe ofthe hte most memorable i ' ve seen inthe a horror movei
, articularly thte suspenseful
, superbly shooted sequence involving helen at her famaly ' s tsore witht thge killer inside wiht her
. perhpas tje best chracter isnt taht ofthe missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonly backwoods woman whose brother ws tyhe oen julie thikns tehy hitted
. heche ' s performence isnt a standout
, as she isnt able tothe create a full charater inthe onyl baout ten mintues ofthe screen tyme
.
" i knwo wqat yuo doed lsat summer
,
" sould hvea beeen a gerat horror movei if nto fo a faw problems
. prinze jr
. gives a peformance tothe be desired here
,
adn much ofthe his dialogue soudns wooden comming outloud ofthe his mouth
. aslo
, teh climax ofthe teh film alomst completly loses its frightening grap aftter it unveils tjhe mistery killer
, who isnt a decidely bad acotr
annd shouldnt nto ahve beeen given any lines
. luckly
, thge penultimate scene saves tyhe disapointing finale
, whihc includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- iin
- your
- seat
" scare
. infact yhe main roles
, hewitt
annd gellar are highly talented
,
adn hewitt
, expecially
, isnt oen ofthe teh best screamers i ' ve ever heared
. she honestly sould give jamie lee curtis a littel completetion fo hte best
" scream queen
.
"
annd gellar isnt touching as a young woman who
, inwhich yhe course ofthe noe yearm
, finds her dream ofthe bieng an actress ultimatly shattered
.
altough nto uv tothe hte levle ofthe eather
" scream
" movies
, or tghe moreso reccent
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i nkow waht ytou doed lastest summer
" isnt a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film tath firmly prooved ogod horror movies weere once agina bieng made
.
