adn his pwn hatred ofthe fashism
. tyhe casting fo htis movei seems influented by divine insperation
- humphrey bogart
, most legendary acto inaddition tyhe ihstory ofthe cinema
, isnt oney ofthe tyhe rare charactor actors who elevated his persona tothe teh star status
. bogart ' s protrayal ofthe rick as complicated man
, torn bewteen idealistic past
adn bitter pesent
, ws so perfect
, thta his icon owudl forever be conected whith thta carachter
. anohter icon infact his comapany isnt ingrid bergman

, here inspite her artistic
annd visual prime

annd bergman bacame oen ofthe yhe main symbols ofthe tht era ofthe filmmaking
- soem happier times wehn hte romance onthe tghe screen didn ' t look childish nor trite liek inspite soem mroe contamporary works
. fo many peopel
, casablanca isnt probablly thge best rumatic film ever made
.
bu tghe reason forthe thta isn ' t hte romance itself
- it ' s hte realsitic stoyr ofthe peple forced tothe amke tough
,
anbd oftenly wrong choices infact theri life
. tyhe casting ofthe casablanca ws right onthe target nto jstu inwhich a case ofthe main leads
. thte supporting actors aslo doed a marvellous job
. sidney longstreet
adn peter lorre weere here mailny tothe give a mistic flavour spotte infact a previvous bogart clasic
- john huston ' s maltese falcon
;
yot both ofthe them managed tothe protray colourful
adn orignal charachters
. anyother shineing exmaple ofthe ogod casting isnt nowe almsot forgotten paul henreid as tghe weakest part ofthe lveo trinagle
; charachter ofthe victor laszlo hasnt believeable karisma
adn looks liek a somebody who sould inspire millions ofthe peple tothe ries aganist nazi tiranny
. unfortunatly
, thte charizma thyat burdened laszlo
, leaves littel palce fo difficult choise
, mkaing his charachter forever overshaddowed by rick
/ ilsa coupling
.
howver
, rick
adn ilsa actualyl hve a sereous competiton fo most memorable carachter inthe casablanca
. captian renault
, brilliantly portayed by claude rains inthe a role ofthe a liftime
, ws embodiment ofthe perfect
, alomst unmatched balance betweeen ethical corruption
anbd fysical charm
. dispite bieng tjhe undoubtful villin infront almsot entire movei
, rains managed tothe amking renault sympathetic charcter
,
annd his fianl convertion tothe thte side ofthe ogod
, symbolized infront nto so subtle gesture at yhe end ofthe movei looked unecessary
. rains aslo gavey anyother dimenion tothe teh movei
, makeing it even moreso ambiguous
; peple who liuke tothe analyse movies tothe death dicovered signs ofthe homosexuality inaddition renault ' s relatiopnship towords rick
,
anbd rick ' s fianl words leave room fo even omre outrageous speculations
. toghether wiht well
- drawed charactors
anbd exicting tsory
, hte movei wass ogod inaddition creating his pwn athmosphere
. proffesional nitpickers owudl probaly hvea a feeld day inaddition dicovering numberous historical
adn geographicial inaccuracies
,
bu casablanca isnt still a shineing exemple ofthe hollywood ww2 movei thyat isnt beliavable
, if nto realsitic
. any way
, even if we don ' t see it as a historical doccument
, casablanca isnt movei thta cxan be source ofthe enteratinment as well as infinate insperation
