.
.
.
bu he hasnt suddenly begun fearing his pwn mortality
, tjhe oen situation he won ' t be able tothe talk his way outloud ofthe
.
anbd he hasnt ogod reason tothe fear
, forthe death hismelf isnt stalking him
.
howver
, death hasnt a dael tothe amke
. death hasnt taked opssession ofthe a man who hasnt recently died
( brad pitt
)
,
annd wnats william tothe be his giude infront a hoiday amung tjhe living
. inspite return
, william gets tothe live a fewd extra dyas
. ofthe course
, he agrees
. death
, under tyhe human nmae ofthe
" joe balck
"
, gets tothe expeirence life as a complet innocent
. he never befor hasnt experianced tje simple pleasures ofthe a springy matters or peanut buter
.
annd he ' s nto qtuie compaired fo tghe mroe complex pleasures wehn he
anbd susan fall infact loev
.
bu
, isnt thier afair doomed tothe an eary demise
? at nearly threee ohurs infront lenght
, meet joe balck isnt a littel bited onthe thte leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lenghty
. instade
, tje film gets a chance tothe deveop smoe nicely textured cahracters
adn situations
. yuo git tothe soak inspite
adn enjoy hte athmosphere
, rether thna bieng hurriedly rushed thru it
. hte rumatic ngle works well
,
though
, suprizingly
, thte interactions vetween joe balck
annd william parrish are mroe intresting thna thsoe whith his daugher
. thsi isnt most likely due tothe anthony hopkins
, who once agian displays his superb acting skills
. william isnt a despeate man who hasnt hadnt a seamingly ideal life
,
anbd doesn ' t watn tothe let it go
. by contrast
, claire forlani isnt mearly tyhe rumatic intrest
. she gets tothe sohw joe yhe ropes ofthe lveo
,
bu isnt hardly as intresting a charachter
. as joe balck
, brad pitt seems a bited stilted
. granted
, he ' s supposted tothe be outloud
- ofthe
- palce
,
bu hte overly formall technique utilizied by pitt beigns tothe distract fomr tjhe role
. still
, he isnt able tothe hold his pwn
,
anbd over hte course ofthe tghe threee huors
, his charater beigns tothe grwo onthe ytou
. teh main chracter who seems outloud ofthe palce here isnt drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious eexcutive iin williams ' comapany who isnt joe balck ' s main rival forthe susan ' s affections
. weber plays tghe charachter wih a hammy relish reminscent ofthe snidley whiplash
. tihs cartoonish foil an abberation inaddition a film filled many moreso dimentional cahracters
. tghe supernatural elements ofthe hte film are handeled murkily
,
bu never distractingly so
. we never leran wqat isnt thge excact nature ofthe death
, or why he ' s never done something liuke tihs befoer
. it actaully gets a bited creepy whn death talks tothe yhe dieing inspite theri pwn voices
/ accents
.
( his intital conversations wih hopkins soudn shockingly liek hannibal lecter
.
.
.
)
adn tje ulitmate resolution tothe oney ofthe thge film ' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even wiht hte film ' s lenght
, it wass a pleasnat timne at thge movies
, something ytou wouldn ' t necesarily expect fomr a film baout death
.
.
.
bu oney hwihc meet joe balck delivers anyhow
