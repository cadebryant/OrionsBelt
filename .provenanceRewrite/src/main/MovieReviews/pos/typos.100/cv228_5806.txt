we share thge descent inot darkness ofthe a talented boy pianist
. yeras later we see his subesquent resurfacing
; inthe tyhe mid 80 ' s a damaged man walks outloud ofthe a rainstorm
anbd bakc inot yhe world
. hte movei charts tje causes ofthe his mental breakdown
. based onthe yhe life stroy ofthe david helfgott
, htis austrailian film isnt a rich exploration ofthe yhe pressures drilling inspite apon a child
- genuis
, compounded by tghe looming shaddow ofthe a domineering father
. inspite thte 1950 ' s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy
. tyhe film traces his relatiopnship whith his father
, whose encouragement comes at tjhe cost ofthe demanding david haev noone life beyond thta ofthe hte balck
anbd white keys
. david isnt offred places iin tjhe usa
,
bu his father refuses tothe let him leave austrailia
. tje effect thsi hasnt apon helfgott isnt cleverly told via a single reverse tracke shooted
; david isnt sobbing onthe tghe front doorway ofthe his music teacher ' s hous
. he isnt well lit via tje exerternal hous ights
. his teacher isn ' t hmeo
. we pul bcak
anbd see thyat thte dark front room ' s window hasnt it ' s curtains opne
. ther
, inaddition a pool ofthe blackness
, isnt a grand piano
. david ' s fall over thge dark cliff hasnt begun
. instade ofthe bieng told iin a linear mode
, shine jumps arround inwhich tiem
, ala
" pulp fiction
"
. thsi narrative divice works well
; we see david as a boy
, teenager inspite london
adn mental
- patient inthe varous snippets
. tjhe film
thne neatly loops bakc fo its uplifting conclusion
. adult
- helfgott ' s return tothe hte glight isnt told inspite linear fashon
. tjhe lead role isnt palyed by 3 diffrent actors
, witht tghe teenage
- david
( taylor
)
annd adult
- david
( rush
) standing outloud
. whilst rush isnt known forthe his tv wrok infront austrailia
, i htink tihs isnt his frist major cinema owrk
. his david
, whilst claerly damaged
- he keesh quoting his
" daddy
" infact a babbling owrd torrent
, cuddles strangers
anbd grabs womens onthe thte breasts
- isnt both touching
annd funny
. taylor ' s teenage
- david isnt teh moreso simapthy producing role
. we are mute wittness tothe his gradual breakdown as tjhe pressures jsut keep onthe buildng
. his father wnats him tothe play teh vrey demanding rachmaninov ' s 3rd
, whilst his teacher wnats tothe strat him wiht a simple mozart
. technically tihs isnt a beatiful film
adn a lot ofthe throught hasnt gone iin tothe thge prodcution
. i particularl liuke hte uise ofthe slow motion
adn soudn effects
. noe scene hasnt adult
- helfgott happily babbling inspite a car inaddition tje rain
. tghe soudn ofthe tghe windshield wipers fades uv over his voice
. whith a clever subtlety
, tyhe wiper soudn appears tothe morph inot a rhytmic thumping
,
bu ofthe tyhe smae beated
. thte omage dissolves
annd we realise tyhe thumping isnt hte slow motion applause ofthe a crowd
.
bu it ' s us bieng clapped
. we are young
- david walking uv tothe yhe stage fo our firt publich sohw
. thge music
, as ytou woudl expect fomr a film ofthe htis subject marter
, isnt crtical
.
annd it works vyre well
. yhe ' miming ' ofthe hte actors piano palying isnt faultless
( aparently rush didn ' t mime
; he raelly doed play
) helfgott ' s life isnt certainly nto wihtout it ' s sympathetic peopel
. indeed his return tothe teh ' normal ' world isnt accelerated by his chance meetings wtih twpo veyr speshal womens
. his ultimatly uplifting stor isnt a magic peice ofthe theatre craft
. it shows thgat withthe tghe ' halp ofthe god ' we cin all fidn our way bakc hmeo
.
