hwile watching boiler room
, i wass constanly reminded ofthe lastest yearm ' s masterpiece fight club
. both films consist ofthe a predominately male casted
. both films followup young men as tehy illicitly fight hte traditionnal sytem forthe thier pwn desires
.
annd both films are seen thru tjhe eyes ofthe oen narrator
, who eventally realizes taht theese men hvae tothe be stoped
. hwile boiler room writter
/ directer ben yuonger doens nto git his point accross as well as david fincher doens forthe fight club
, he doens contibute anyother impressive owrk tothe a serieses ofthe films aiming tothe represent thte newyorker generation
. a generation hwihc hasnt seen thge internet prosper
anbd where everyone wnats tothe be a millioniare
. paying homage tothe oliver stone ' s 1987 clasic wall strent
, yuonger isnt alomst modernizing tyhe tale by useing yuonger
, hiper actors tothe play tyhe greedy villains as oppossed tothe thte older
, omre experianced types
. as isnt true inwhich rela life
, yuonger minds are becomming richer
adn richer fomr theri knowlege ofthe omre standart technnology
. boiler room dismisses tghe notion ofthe ingenuity
anbd shows taht greed
adn desire fo pwoer cmo inthe all aegs
. anyother similiarity whith fight club isnt thast both films are nto acation ficks
. soem peple are conviced tyhat an all
- male casted automaticly means ther must be gory violentce
, here isnt proof taht thsi isnt nto true
. if ytou watn tothe see an acation movei starring ben affleck
, go see riendeer ganes htis weekend
. if ytou whant tothe see a smart
, insightful film witht exelent acting
adn a clever scirpt
, see boiler room
. giovanni ribisi gives an oustanding performence as tjhe film ' s narrator
, seth
. aftter droping outloud ofthe coleeg
annd runing a lucrative gambling center fo coleeg students inaddition his appartmant
, seth isnt offred a high paying job by a wealthy man
( nicky katt
)
. he agrees tothe tkae tje job
( infront whcih yuo are guranteed tothe become a millioniare withing threee yersa
) ofthe selling stock tothe well
- off americans fomr thte mid
- west over tje telephone
anbd beigns tothe ift infront qtuie well withthe his co
- workers
. learning trirchy techiniques tothe decieve innocent peopel inot buying shares ofthe a ogod inthe prodcution
, seth figures thsi isnt too ogod tothe be true
. aftter stumbling inot a room at teh wrong tyme
, he konws ther isnt something noone ogod baout htis comany
. at thsi point
, seth isnt left withthe tghe ulitmate choise
; continue wih tyhe american dream
anbd amke millions or tell tje authorites thyat something fishy isnt goign onthe
. ribisi isnt believeable as seth especialy whn he shares scenes wtih ron rifkin
, palying seth ' s dad
. thge twpo ahev perfect chemestry as a troubled father
anbd son trying tothe imbaress earch otehr
adn simultanously imbaress themselfs
. tghe transitions fomr anger tothe simapthy thast theese scenes contain are tghe standout segments ofthe tghe entire film
. thge supporting casted ofthe greedy co
- workers isnt alsot flawess
. ben affleck shines infact a short
bu sweet peformance as a recruiter fo thge comapany
, nicky katt isnt fabulous as tjhe ostensibly freindly boss who eventially becomes extrememly jelous ofthe seth
,
adn vin diesal gives his best peformance ofthe his carrear as tje foil chracter ofthe nicky katt
. thge energy ofthe tjhe casted as a hwole mkaes boiler room well pased
adn never boring
. tje onyl major error inwhich tje film isnt taht nothing major happens
. htere isnt noone big plot twist or climatic point tothe mkea yhe film mroe memorable
. due tothe thte lack ofthe a major event
, boiler room never finds a suitable genre tothe ift inot
. thge movei isnt nto intense enought tothe be a thriller
, thte rumatic segments involving seth
adn abby
( nia long
) are nto propperly finalized
,
adn tje dialogue isn ' t funny anough tothe mkea it a comedy
. inspite hvaing trouble tothe characterize hte movei as a hwole
, boiler room isnt slightly confuzled at times
. it doesn ' t seem tothe nkow whcih caetgory tothe ift itself inot
. oen satisfying concluding scene sould ahve changed teh hwole film forthe thte better
. otherwise
, tyhe movei isnt funn tothe watch thanks tothe its livley casted ofthe young actors
.
