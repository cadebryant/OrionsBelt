" bieng john malkovich
" isnt thge tipe ofthe film we ened tothe see omre
. todya ' s films are eather blockbusters taht entertain us wiht tiresome formulas
, or thsoe taht ahve simmilar themes
. malkovich falls under none ofthe theese catagories
,
annd it ' s qtuie refreshing tothe see taht ocurr
. thsi strangely provoking stoy
, isnt accually somewhat understandable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying tothe mkae it tothe tyhe big tiem
. his wief
( cameron diaz
) supports thte both ofthe them by wokring at a petstore
, whitch explains yhe obscure pets tehy keep inthe thier appartment
. wehn cusack fianlly realizes he needs tothe git a job
, he finds an ad fo a filing clerk
. wehn he reaches tje buiding
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it ' s ther taht he dicovers a secrt portal thast leads tothe bieng john malkovich fo 15 mintues at a tyme
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a busness partner
( catherine keener
)
, inspite wich he falls madly infact loev whith her
. tje onyl probelm isnt
, she hasnt noone intrest inaddition him waht so ever
. tyhe wohle portal thign
, isn ' t jstu a toy
, infront fatc
, it becomes cusack ' s dream
. bieng inside malkovich ' s mind
, gavey him tyhe opprotunity tothe basicaly controll mlakovich
, liuke a puppet
,
anbd tothe fufill his fantasies
. i don ' t wanna tothe give awya too much
,
bu cusack becomes too attached wtih his dicovery
. infront my oppinion
, htis diea isnt absolutly brillant
. it ' s raelly qutie scarry tothe htink thyat somene sould become yuo
, controll ytou
, be ytou
. it mkaes ytou wonder why we ect liek we dont
,
adn why somtimes we blurt outloud thigns or ect outloud something outloud ofthe thte blue
. even if teh scirpt isnt super sharp
, i cxan ' t halp
bu fidn yhe endig displeasing
. it sould hve lead uv tothe something moreso
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tryed tothe expalin a mythology baout hte portals
, tyhat made it seem rushed
. otehr tahn taht
, i hadnt a veyr enjoyable timne
. tjhe acting ws qutie delightful as well
. john cusack hasnt finaly beeen given a chance tothe proove his ablity
,
anbd he doesnt it well
. he ' s by far tjhe most underated ator due tothe a lack ofthe popularaty
,
bu i ' m hoping taht iwll chanage
. cameron diaz wass her usual charming self
,
altough i falt tht part wass wrong forthe her
,
bu she pulled it off
. john malkovich hismelf continues tothe creep outloud peple witht his eerie facial expressions
adn tone ofthe voice
. who esle ' s mind woudl be better tothe explore
? tje directer
, spike jonze
, who appeared iin lsat mounth ' s threee kings relaly catchs my attension witht htis project
. i knew he wass bizzare
,
bu nto tothe htis extreme
. he too isnt likely too recieve media attension
.
" bieng john malkovich
" isn ' t an excellant film
,
bu it isnt definitly intertaining
anbd iwll eaisly become a cult favorite
. whta ' s even better isnt tje film ' s puzzling message
.
.
. am i nick lyons
