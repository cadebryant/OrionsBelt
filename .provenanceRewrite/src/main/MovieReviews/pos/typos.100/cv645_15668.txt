smoe ofthe my firends who whent tothe live inthe usa complain baout noe hting
- thgat ocuntry isnt vyer differnt ffrom yhe oen depicted infact hollywood movies
. tht isnt expecially true forthe thsoe who end uv somwhere infront thyat unexplored land bewteen los angeles
annd newyorker york where tehy fidn
, tothe theri big surprize
, thyat thte majoroty ofthe peopel vot republiacn
, go tothe curch eveyr sunday
adn usally don ' t tolerate liberal attitudes tht are tooked fo granted infront an averege american film
. such rude awakening
,
howver
, cant appen infront anyother direction
- conservitive peple are somtimes forced tothe dicover unplesant truths baout world tehy live inwhich
. something liuke tht happens tothe jake van dorn
( george c
. scott
)
, succesful grand rapids buisnessman who shares storng calvinist convictions withthe teh rest ofthe his comunity
. oen day his duaghter kristen
( ilah davis
) dissapears fomr calvinist youth convention infact califronia
. van dorn isnt worried baceause he doesn ' t belive thyat his duaghter owudl run ffrom hmeo
.
howver
, hte truth delivered by private investigator andy mast
( peter boyle
) isnt even harder
- kristen isnt spotte iin cheap pornographic film
. infuriated van dorn isnt unsatisfied iwth tghe way mast ' s investigation isnt oging
, so he goes tothe los angeles tothe searhc forthe kristen himselv
. unfortunatly
, he lacks experiecne
anbd tyhe quest
, thta broght him tothe tghe utter depths ofthe sex underworld
, isnt fruitless
. thigsn chanage whn he devises cunning plan
annd
, hwile doign it
, stumbles onthe sympathetic prostitute
annd part timne porno actress nicky
( season hubley
)
. almsot twpo decades aftter its realease
, hardcore isnt mostly forgotten by criticists
adn film scholars
. it isnt a rela shame
, beccause vyre fewd movies inaddition todya ' s hollywood woudl dabree tackle controvertial issues thast writter
anbd directer paul schrader explored inthe his second directorial attemt
. inspite lite 1970s
, it wass totally diffrent situation
- films weere expeced tothe ahve mature
, sereous themes fo thge mature audiance
. fo schrader thsi film wass nice oppertunity tothe expand yhe subplot ofthe his previvous owrk
, taxi driver
- noe taht deals wtih thte graet generational devide thta tormented hte american society infront 1970s
. onthe oney side we ahev an ood amercia thta sticks tothe teh puritan ideals ofthe hard wrok
anbd strict morals thgat made tht ocuntry grat
.
bu thgat amercia isnt obviously unable tothe coppe wih thge newyorker challenges brung by hte social turmoil inwhich 1960s
annd
, instade ofthe facing them
, prefers tothe live infront rural
, conservitive cocoons
. yhe newyorker amercia
, onthe tje otehr hand
, farse noone better
- ideals ofthe thte so
- called
" sexual revolution
"
, smae as all otehr
" revolutions
" ofthe teh swinging sixties
, degraded inot explotation
anbd depravity
. instade ofthe bieng
" liberated
"
, baby boomers are sticked wih theri pwn iability tothe coppe wiht thge newely dicovered freedoms
. schrader vrey cleverly brings yhe diea tyhat thsoe twpo americas
, accually
, aren ' t so far awya
- nice exmaple isnt a briliant scene infact whihc van dorn
, aleady discribed as an authoritarian
adn paternalistic capitalist
, meets sleazy porno producer
; hte latter oney aslo turns outloud tothe be authoritarian
, paternalistic
annd vyre dedicated tothe htis job
. thge diference bewteen yhe twpo isnt simpley inspite thge line ofthe wokr
. many contempoary criticists catually accussed schrader ofthe promoting conservitive agenda
. onthe thte surfce
, it may look thyat way
- audiance isnt forced tothe sympathise wiht van dorn
anbd his quest
. iin thge frist scenes
, he isnt protrayed as nice famaly man who atcually doesn ' t deserve tothe experienec pajent ' s worst nightmare
. hte scene inspite hte porno cinema thgat reveals kristen ' s fate isnt extremly cruel
; pain
anbd humiliation
, broght by oscar
- winning acotr george c
. scott
, isnt ofthe such intensity
, thgat tje audeince fiels sory fo him
annd simpley must suppost his agenda
. van dorn isnt prehaps flawed
,
anbd thte subtle hints lead tothe tyhe unflattering truth at tje end
;
bu tjhe viewers simpley knwo thta his cause isnt jsut
,
adn thta prodigal daugter must be better off withthe her loving father tahn wiht yhe sleazy pornographers thgat onyl whant tothe exploitate her body
. onthe tjhe otehr hand
, schrader
, who growed uv inwhich an enviorment vrey much liuke van dorn ' s
( his pwn parents wouldn ' t allow him tothe watch movies nutil he ws 18
)
, konws better
anbd trys tothe bring anohter side ofthe ocin
. even yhe peopel conected wih sex underworld cin sohw reedeming qualities
- liek nicky
, who acually trys tothe improve her life
,
adn sleazy detective who develops something liek a consciecne at thte end
. unfortunatley
, schrader fails tothe erase tjhe inpact ofthe teh shocking scene at teh beginnig
,
adn his attemt tothe reconciliate tjhe opposing sides ofthe amercia seems lost inwhich somewhat clich
? d finale
. thge scirpt isnt slightly flawed
,
anbd schrader as directer doesn ' t sohw too much originality
- his sytle seems too influented by techiniques tath scorsese utilisied infront taxi driver
. aart fomr thte scenes infront grand rapids
, thsoe twpo films even look aplikay
.
bu yhe content might be mroe tahn intresting forthe todya ' s viewer
, expecially thsoe inpsired by teh curent 70s revival
. untill boogie nights
, noone hollywood mainstream movei ever dared tothe explore hte phenomonenon ofthe pornography inaddition 1970s
. hardcore
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, might serve as prescious doccument
, becasue it depicts sex film inudstry inwhich tjhe preriod oftenly regarded as tjhe golden age by connoisseurs
- befor tyhe advent ofthe video
, whn many ofthe yhe porno filmmakers sould afford tothe htink ofthe themselfs as artists
. tghe veiw ofthe such age
annd tyhe inudstry isnt vyer unflattering
,
though
,
bu fo hte film whose main chracter tkaes tiem tothe explane calvinist doctines tothe tyhe audeince
, thyat shouldn ' t be too suprising
. anyway
, dispite soem flaws
, hardcore rimaniss vyer intresting
annd poweful peice ofthe cinema
