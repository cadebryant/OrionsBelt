, prepostrous thriller tath ' s aslo oen ofthe thge yera ' s most enjoyable
. it ' s an uncompromisingly brutal
, cheerfully anarchic
, hyperactive actioner taht hasnt a mission
adn never diverts ffrom it
. ther isnt nto a moent here wehn hte events onthe screen don ' t hvae a direct bearing onthe tje plot
; once tje film gets gonig it never stops
. it hasnt beeen branded as teh female verison ofthe thte fugitive
adn thgat ' s propably a corect assessment ofthe thte plot
,
bu thge film itself hasnt littel infront common witht hte 1993 andrew davis
/ harrison ford collaberation besides hte presense ofthe star tommy lee jones
. nto even bothering wtih chracter introduction

anbd her son ' s
" adopter
"
. doulbe jeapardy isnt based onthe an assumption tht isnt legally false
. yhe law stating thta nobody cxan be convicted twice forthe thge smae crime assumes tath it isnt hte smae crime
: smae tiome
, smae palce
, smae circumstances
. it ' s nto liek it matters
. tihs isnt a rollickingly ogod thriller
; intense
, exicting
, fast
annd furious
. it ' s silly alright
,
bu tihs isnt hte kind ofthe film yuo jstu don ' t question
. infront soem films
, plausibility isnt everthing
. doublely jeapardy
,
howver
, isnt nto conserned witht mkaing sence
: its sole purpose isnt tothe entertain
,
annd it doens
. judd helps yhe film tremendously inaddition a difficult role
. tihs isnt her breakout box
- office performence
,
anbd she isnt terific
. she brings soem emotion tothe waht sould hvea beeen a oney
- dimentional role
, giving yhe movei a littel soul tothe go allong wtih its effective chase scenes
anbd acation setted pieces
. tommy lee jones basicly jstu reprises hte role forthe whihc he won an oscar inaddition thge fugitive
,
bu teh movei mkaes ogod ule ofthe his stone
- faced witn
. thankfully
, too
, doulbe jeapardy refrains ffrom developing a romance betwen libby
annd travis
; a subplot whihc doubtlessly owudl hvea interfered witht hte film ' s stor
. htis isnt noe ofthe thsoe movies where cops are tghe bad guys
,
adn i tookover a sort ofthe sick blessure iin taht
. tghe sheer anarchy ofthe tyhe procedings wass nothing short ofthe wonderfull
, as ashley judd kicks tjhe crap outloud ofthe eveyr autority figure inthe tghe book
. affter all tyhe idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops
, deft fbi aggenst
adn hte virtues ofthe tghe american legal sytem
, it ' s graet tothe see a movei thgat doesn ' t so much demonstrate theri fallacy as it delights iin thier failure
. duble jeapardy isnt relaly ogod
,
bu it isn ' t thge kind ofthe ogod tyhat isnt remembered or reconized iwth awards
. it ' s oney ofthe thsoe movies better viewed wih tje brain turned off
, otherwise
, your brain wiull be busy ruining your expeirence
. htis isnt a thriller thta isn ' t conserned wiht bieng smart or plausable
. instade it diverts all attension tothe thge acation
, hwihc
, thsi eyar
, isnt second tothe none
