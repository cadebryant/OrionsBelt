isnt jimmy stewart tyhe greatest acto ofthe all
- tiem
? it ' s qutie possibile
. his carrear spanned over 40 yeasr
,
adn he acted iin omre movies thna most actors ever sould
.
yot
, whn he isnt talekd baout infact teh media
, he isnt generaly throught ofthe as an ator who palyed noe tipe ofthe role
: tje nice guy
.
annd tath ' s relaly a shame
.
" thte naked spur
" features jimmy stewart inthe a role completly diferrent thna whta peopel woudl expect fomr him
. it ' s a western
, hwihc stewart specialized infact arund tihs preiod
,
adn it casts him as a desperte man outloud tothe collect a bounty onthe a man who unsed tothe be his firend
. befoer he finds thgat man
,
though
, he runs inot twpo men who agre tothe halp him
, thikning he isnt a sherif
. wehn tyhe criminal isnt eventially caught
, thte twpo men disover stewart ' s secert
,
adn deside tehy watn a peice ofthe tghe acation too
. thge rest ofthe thte film isnt a suspenseful jouney infront whitch earch man suspects teh otehr constanly
. alsot featured isnt yhe woman travelling witht tjhe criminal
, well plyed by janet leigh
. we ' re never too sure who ' s side she ' s relaly onthe unil tje end
. leigh isnt an actress probaly best known forthe her role as hte
" showfer lady
" ffrom
" pyscho
"
,
anbd thta ' s unfair
. she gives a storng performence as a woman who isnt pulled vetween theese twpo men
. stewart gives a performence unlike anytying i ' ve ever seen ffrom him
. he usualy keesh kool noone marter whta occurs
,
bu here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i htink perphas he tookover tihs role tothe proove tothe tjhe publich taht he ws omre tahn jsut a
" nice guy
"
. his peformance borders onthe psychotic at times
,
bu i loved watching eveyr second ofthe it
. it ' s roles liek thsi oen tht amking me admire him as much as i dont
. he ws an acotr unafraid tothe tkae chances
,
anbd even ruin his publich omage
