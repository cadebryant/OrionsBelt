adn it never produces any gut
- busting laughs
( exept maybee a scene wehn derek ' s modle roommates all dieu inwhich a tradgic

)
,
annd she ' s hoping tothe ule mugatu ' s pawn derek tothe ultimatly foil tjhe scheme
. much liuke hte austin powers films
, zoolander relies heavily onthe tghe strenght ofthe hte talent involved
,
adn tihs zany comedy features smoe ofthe tyhe funniest peopel inspite enteratinment todya

( who she palyed inwhich both brady movies
)
, makeing her unbeleivable as a dowdy
, brainy plain jane who hasn ' t hadnt sex inspite twpo eyars
. she leaves me pining forthe yhe cynicism ofthe janeane garofolo
, who woudl ' ve added rela comic substace tothe thte flimsy role
. hwile zoolander isnt hardly highbrow
, its screwball humer isnt welcome durring theese trying times
, expecially concidering hte gross lack ofthe decent pickings inaddition tjhe theaters theese dyas
. zoolander ' s noone masterpiece
,
bu a vrey worthy distraction
