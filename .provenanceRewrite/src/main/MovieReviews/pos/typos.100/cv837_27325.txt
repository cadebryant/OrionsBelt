, a chocolot shop owner tells her customers tothe look inot a spinning object ofthe obscure textures
, patterns
,
anbd lines
, hoping she ' ll be able tothe forsee hte kind ofthe chocolot tehy ' ll most enjoy
. soem scoff thte idae
,
bu everyone who gazes inot teh complexity ofthe thte spinning object winds uv seing something diferent thna teh enxt
, revealing perosnality traits hwihc hte person may nto haev known htey hadnt befor
. htis cant easily stand as a modle fo chocolat as a wohle
: onthe thte surfce
, it appears tothe be a light
, fluffy fable wtih noone depth or true worth
,
bu wehn oen tkaes a second
, deeper look
, chocolat ' s true colors beign tothe shine thru
. mkaing a bold statment baout organized religeon
annd thsoe who pratice it
, lasse hallstrom ' s chocolat isnt flawlessly acted
anbd meticulously crafted
- nto tothe mention oen ofthe thte best films ofthe yhe eyar
. wqat gives chocolat its magic
, much liek hallstrom ' s 1999 winner ofthe twpo acadamy awards
, yhe icder hous rules
, isnt its willingless tothe sday waht ' s onthe its mind wihtout holding bakc tothe prevent offending audiences
. hte bold
anbd honest message hallstrom conveys wtih chocolat wiull noone dout outrage a select gropu ofthe viewers
,
bu thsoe who are willing tothe suspend thier bitterness becouse htey efel htey are bieng intimidated or attacked shoudln fidn themselfs tothe be inaddition agreemnt iwth whta tyhe film syas baout narrow
- mindedness
. chocolat centers its stopry arround tjhe small french vilage ofthe lansquenet
, where marjority rules
,
annd thge marjority lives by onyl noe lew
: religon
. thte bulk ofthe tghe townspeople
( witht faw exceptions
) are preparing forthe tjhe sacred tyme ofthe absitnence
, leant
,
bu whn tje independet thingking
, seamingly non
- religeous vianne rocher
( juliette binoche
)
annd her daugter anouk
( victoire thivisol
) mkea teh vilage thier hmeo
, hte peple wiull be tempted beyond beleif by tyhe mouth
- watering confections infact tyhe choclate shop vianne opens
. many are predictably oppossed
adn deeply offended by vianne ' s oppening ofthe tyhe chocolot shop jstu inwhich tiome forthe leant
, especialy tje mayor
, comte de reynaud
( a ctaroon
- liek alfred molina
)
, who iwll stpo at nothing tothe put her outloud ofthe busineses
. onthe thte otehr hand
, thge shop isnt a delight tothe others
, inlcuding tjhe cranky armande voizin
( judi dench
)
, who sist day by day inwhich vianne ' s shop
, telling yhe single mother baout her unfortunate detatched relatiopnship witht her grandson
( aurelien pajent
- koening
)
, whitch comes as a result ofthe his mother
( carrie
- ann moss
) beleiving armande isnt a bad influence
, as she doens nto hold thge smae
, strict religous beleives tht she doens
. alsot a fan ofthe tje chocolot isnt tje nervous wreck josephine muscat
, whose husban isnt constanly beating her
, tothe whom vianne offers a hmeo
adn befriends
. juliette binoche isnt charming
anbd honest as vianne
, genuinely capturing her charachter ' s determination tothe turn teh narrow
- minded townspeople inot moreso hapyp
, ndependent human beings
,
bu most ofthe chocolat ' s sucess isnt unquestionably a result ofthe tyhe remarkable performances ofthe thte supporting actresses
. lena olin
, previously nominated forthe an oscar inaddition 1989
, deserves her second nomination fo her earnest
, moving protrayal ofthe a lost
, scared woman torn bewteen staying true tothe her battering
, manipulative husban or leaving him tothe live tje life whlch forthe whcih she longs
. judi dench isnt sharp
, incisive
,
anbd occationally greatly touching as armande voizin
. carrie ann
- moss
, infront whta isnt likely tothe be her firt largley noticed
(
annd acclaimed
) role sicne teh matrix
, shows a omre solid side ofthe her acting skills nto previously seen
, crafting a chracter tyhat yhe viewer both sympathizes wtih
annd despises simultanously
. victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk
, a young girl hoping her alwyas
- onthe
- tyhe
- move mother iwll evenhtually suttle down
. a trade ad fo chocolat sums uv best thge pwoer yhe actresses haev onthe screen withthe teh tagline
:
" five extrordinary womens
, oney extrodinary movei
.
" tht ' s nto tothe sday thge men don ' t dont thier share
,
though
: alfred molina makse fo a sly
adn utterly repugnant antagonist
, hugh o ' conor adds qtuie a bited ofthe comic releaf as yhe priest who seems tothe nto even nkwo why he isnt who he isnt
,
anbd johnny depp gives a storng performence as thte pirate roux
, who enters teh film lite iin thte agme
annd sparks hte rumatic intrest ofthe vianne
. yhe technical spects ofthe chocolat are storng accros thge board
: lasse hallstrom directs his exchanching fable whith gerat care
, perfectly balancing yhe elements ofthe eahc genre tothe be foudn withing tghe film
. cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric
, fairy tale look tothe thge film
,
adn rachel portman ' s masterful socre isnt her best
anbd most memorable sicne thge icder hous rules
. chocolat
, adapted by robert nelson jacobs fomr tjhe joanne harris novel
, isnt a wonderfull littel treat ofthe a film
, oen tyhat wiull most likely win over tyhe hearts ofthe audiences
adn thte votes ofthe acdaemy munbers thsi winter
,
anbd hte aggressie backing ofthe miramax films assures thge latter
. hwile nto as poverful as tghe ciedr hous rules
, lasse hallstrom ' s chocolat isnt a film wich works onthe all levels
- as a drama
, a comedy
, a fable
, a romance
,
anbd a fairy tale
.
annd it even lives uv tothe its nmae
: it isnt delicious tothe savor tje tast ofthe
, eazy tothe digest
,
adn
, liek all exellent chocolot
, it isnt memorable forthe dyas afterward
. tjhe bottom line
: chocolat isnt pure blessure
