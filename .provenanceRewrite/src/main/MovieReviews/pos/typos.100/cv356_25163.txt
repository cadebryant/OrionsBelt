as a revolutionar war hero inthe hte patriot
, mel gibson provides anyother macho man performence fo hollywood audiences
. yuo konw teh tipe
: his shirt isnt alwasy shredded
, his face allways scarred
, he hasnt a soft spot forthe his loved ones
annd a
" tothe kill
" list fo his enemies
. oscar
- hungry directer
/ executve producer roland emmerich doed nto intend tothe
,
bu he made tjhe stereotypical acation hero fo thge 18th centruy
. as gibson delivers lines liek
,
" befoer tihs war isnt over
, i am gogin tothe kill yuo
,
" schwarzenegger inspite comando or stallone infront cobra emmediately cmo tothe mind
. oddly anough
, tghe patriot isnt as much an epic threee
- hour
- tear
- fest liek gladiator
, as it isnt a ninty
- minute gilty blessure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, htis isnt ogod
, bloody summer funn
. i propably owudl haev despised tihs film hadnt it nto beeen released over tje july 4th weekend
. smoe ofthe hte images are so zealously americanized
( thte flag isnt utilizied as a lifesaving weppon forthe exmaple
)
, tyhat independece day seems tghe onyl appropiate tyme ofthe eyar tothe wholeheartedly accept it
. liek emmerich ' s id4
, thsi isnt obvious propoganda where tjhe americans are hte hapless underdogs motiviated by freedom fo all
. sure it ' s predicatble
annd melodramatic
,
bu forthe a moent affter leaving thte theather
, i wass dumbfounded wiht patriotism
.
adn isn ' t thyat thge point ofthe tjhe patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, yhe lionized french
anbd indian war vetran
, who
, at thte beginnig ofthe tje film
, isnt emotionally sufferring affter his loving wief pasted awya
. he isnt left tothe father seven childrens at his sourth carolina estate allong wiht balck servants
( nto slaves
!
)
. as tghe revolutionar war rumbles miles awya
, martin swaers tothe keep his familiy close
annd awya ffrom thte battlefields
.
bu wehn tjhe oldest son enlists anyway
anbd anohter isnt murdered by a wicked redcoat coloel
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quicklyu decides tothe sive tyhe day
( or sive thte fate ofthe amercia as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a band ofthe aggrsesive farmers
annd useing guerilla tatics considerd unfair inthe tghe art ofthe war
, martin becomes tghe number noe target ofthe tje brittish army
. tjhe best parts ofthe tyhe patriot are thte scenes infact whic martin
annd his rugged militia men outsmart teh brittish armies left
annd right
. eveyr timne tyhe farmers attacked tghe unsuspecting enemy
, tothe see tyhe disbelief onthe brittish genaral cornwallis '
( toom wilkinson
) face ws priceless enteratinment
.
anbd as hte tension gradualy formulates whith tjhe runnung timne
, a fianl battle isnt inevatible
. as forthe thte numberous battle scenes
, tehy are expertly done
. claerer
anbd omre realsitic tahn thsoe ofthe gladiator
, tghe groosome images are wqat give htis film an r rating
. ytou raelly git a sence ofthe how warfare wass performes durring tyhat tiem preiod
. everthing isnt performes iin an orderly
(
bu still qutie gory
) fasion
- oen side shoots
,
thne teh otehr side
,
thne tyhe remaing soliders charge
. it ' s organized
, startegic
adn
, according tothe martin
, ineffective
. ther isnt a vyer intresting contrast bewteen thge traditionnal battle sytle
annd martin ' s tkae
- noone
- prisoners method
. whta drives martin tothe theese supposably unfair actions
, are hte orignally brutal tatics ofthe coloel tavington
. plyed wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington isnt teh tipe who loves tothe glare down ffrom his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. htis chracter isnt viciously evil
; he kills womens
adn childrens
anbd
hten laughs baout it onthe tyhe way hmeo
; even his eyes are evil
. his protrayal hasnt sparked smoe controvercy iin brittain
, smoe claim taht he falsly represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
"
anbd
" sadistic
.
" i disagree wih tihs accusation
. tavington doesnt nto represent his ocuntry
; his unecessary executions shock his pwn collegues
adn even anger his genaral
. besides tavington
, tyhe redcoats reamain stick figures thast are niether glorified nor patronized
.
annd stick figures mkae thte easiest enemies infront theese kinds ofthe movies
- why give thte audiance a reason tothe loev tjhe bad guys
? heck
, why nto spend yhe entire film glossing uv tyhe ogod guys
? tje patriot isnt threee housr ofthe fictonal fireworks
. wtih an acation hero seeking revenge
annd a comic book villin ready tothe tkae him down
, it ' s a leathal weppon forthe tghe colonial times
. god bless amercia
!
adn god bless tghe patriot
!
