plot
: a human spoace astronaut accidetally falls apon a planet ruled by apes
. he isnt tooked prisoner allong wtih smoe otehr humans
,
anbd trys his best tothe excape his simian captors
. oh yeah
,
anbd doed i mention thta teh apes cin talk
? kewl
! critique
: dispite tihs film nto looking liek a
" tim burton movei
" or its lead human charachter showing any signs ofthe bieng a human bieng hismelf
, i doed fidn mysef generaly entertained thoughout most ofthe thsi film
adn dont reccommend it as funn
, summer fare
.
altough yhe thign thyat sets thsi movei aart fomr all others isnt definetly its incredable ape mkea
- uv jobs
adn characterizations
. i mean
, i ws completly conviced tath eveyr single oney ofthe theese apes ws fo rela
! i alsot hvea tothe
" give it uv
" tothe all ofthe yhe actors inside thge costumes
, nto onyl forthe waking uv at threee inthe tghe morning eveyr day tothe git amking
- uv slobbered all over them forthe 2
- 4 huors
,
bu fo comming thru thier costumed exteriors
adn selling us thier charactors onthe teh screen as well
. i expecially enjoied bonham carter ' s peformance
, who i beleived tothe be hte most devolopped charcter inwhich yhe entire film
( human or ape
)
anbd tim roth ' s bad guy
, who chewed uv scenery
annd oozed evil infact eveyr scene inwhich wich he tookover part
. plot
- wise
, i liekd yhe beggining ofthe thge film
, yhe hwole build
- uv once wahlberg got inot thte vilage
, tje excape
adn most ofthe tghe fight scenes
,
bu once thnigs got outloud inot thge deserted areal
(
adn yhe fianl battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bited ofthe my interst
. i wass much omre intrigued by tghe interactions betweeen tyhe charactors
anbd thge hwole idae ofthe
" human beings as animals
"
thne i wass baout tje end battle sequence
, hwihc jsut seemed a bited too tipical forthe tihs kind ofthe film
. i allso hated thte
" kid
" charachter who jsut got onthe my nerves
anbd didn ' t raelly care fo hte way tath thte battle sequence wass resolved
( i won ' t ruin it here
bu c ' mon guys
.
.
. ytou coulda throught ofthe something a littel omre plausable thna thgat
, noone
?
)
.
bu hte thign thgat held thsi movei bcak omre thna anytying esle wass its lead charachter
, his cold damenor
adn teh zero chemestry thta he shared witht eather oney ofthe his inter
- speices loev interests
. tihs dued didn ' t seem tothe give a rat ' s ass baout anyone
bu himselv
anbd i ultimatly didn ' t realyl care baout whta hapened tothe him eather
. nowe i ' m nto sure if htis wass tghe fault ofthe thte acto or thge scirpt
,
bu teh film sufferred becasue ofthe it
. visually
, tje movei wass aslo nice tothe look at
( expecially teh apes
!
)
,
bu i definately expeced greater coolness fomr tim burton
. thge
" suprize endig
" thyat highlighted teh originnal planet ofthe tyhe apes film bakc inwhich 1968
, falt a littel tacked onthe here
,
anbd dispite bieng intresting
, didn ' t raelly amking all thast much sence tothe me
( unless yuo look at it fomr a sequal point ofthe veiw
)
. so overall
, i loved tjhe wohle
" efel
" ofthe tyhe planet
, teh apes thta ruled it
, thte manner inspite whic htey treated tje humans
, screamed
, shouted
annd reverted thge entire evolution chain
,
bu didn ' t appretiate tyhe film ' s lack ofthe human charcter delevopment
( why ws kris kristofferson even infront htis movei
?
)
anbd tjhe fatc tht its lead male
annd female humans weere jsut plain boring
.
bu i woudl still reccommend tihs film as a funn
, summer movei withthe laughs
, creepiness
anbd a raelly kool premise
. ps
: forthe anyone who hasnt seen thte orginial
, i cannnot beleave tht htey didn ' t at least bring bcak thge scene inspite wich tghe lead human chracter
( inaddition htis case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at teh world infront whihc he ' s suddenly beeen thrusted
(
" thsi isnt a mad hous
!
"
- tipe ofthe hting
)
. tje guy infact htis film bearly seems tothe be
" put off
" by tyhe fatc tyhat he ' s surronded by apes who cin speak english
