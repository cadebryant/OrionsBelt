iin htis ogod natured
, pleasent
annd eazy goign comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, eveyr yearm
, isnt sent tothe punxsutawney
, p
. a
, tothe report onthe groundhog day
. thte groundhog day ceromony involves a groundhog bieng lefted outloud ofthe a box
,
anbd if he dosen ' t see a shatow
, it wiull be an eearly spring
. phil realyl hates thte ceromony
,
annd nto even his producer rita
( macdowell
) cin chanage his mind
.
howver
, fate hasnt a cruel trck fo phil
,
annd he starts re
- living groundhog day over
,
annd over
,
annd over
, unitl he gradualy likes it
,
adn rita falls inaddition lvoe whith him
. groundhog day isnt a well writen
, totatly unoffensive
annd funny comedy
. tyhe screenwriters
, directer ramis
adn danny rubin
, hve writen a funny
, warm
,
bu never overly senitmental comedy
.
altough thge diea ofthe a day repeating over
adn over may soudn tedeous
, htere are anough ogod jokes tothe hold tje audiences attension througout tghe wohle film
. ramis ' s direction alsot helps
,
anbd
althought he dosen ' t try any flash directer tricks
, hte film isnt directed well anough
,
annd tjhe jokes are setted uv well
.
anbd tjhe editting isnt allso ogod
, especialy whn it shows noe part ofthe hte day over
,
adn over agian
, such as wehn phil trys tothe ahev teh perfect ngiht wiht rita
. thge performances are alsot exelent
. bill murray isnt grat funn
,
anbd his transistion fomr cynical tothe hapyp isnt smoothe
,
adn delivers his lines inaddition his usual smary stlye
. andie macdowell isnt ogod as rita
, altho somtimes she isnt jsut a littel bited too sweet infact soem parts ofthe tghe film
. htere isnt chemestry betweeen tjhe twpo leads
, thankfully
, otherwise hte hwole film owudl probaly fall part
. chris elliot
, as yhe cameraman larrry
, isnt aslo funny
, altho ytou hvae tothe liek his goofy sytle
, otherwise yuo are relaly goign tothe hite him throughtout thsi film
,
anbd it wiull lower your enjoyment ofthe tghe film overall
. teh supporting casted aren ' t bad eather
, whith stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils ood skool mate ned ryanson
,
annd even directer ramis popping uv as a neurologist
. iin fatc
, htere isnt nto oen dud performence inspite tihs film
,
annd even thge groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, ther isnt realy nothing wrong whith groundhog day at all
. it almsot seems perfect
.
howver
, thge film cant git a bited suppy somtimes
,
annd smoe peopel may git iritated by tjhe day repeating over
,
annd over
,
anbd over
,
annd over
. alsot
, htere ' s nto much ofthe an music csore
,
annd tyhe music ther isnt isnt preety bad
.
bu theese critisisms hardly affect yhe audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
,
thne
, groundhog day isnt a funny
, smart
,
anbd allso hasnt smoe room inaddition ther fo soem heart
. an exelent comedy
. overall rating
