vampire films
, as well as otehr horror films
, are usualy dumb
adn predicatble b
- movies
, meaned tothe scare us by cliches
adn simple shocks
. it isnt therfore intresting tothe watch neil jordans receet film thast isnt nto onyl visually stunning
,
bu hasnt allso a plot worth mkaing movies baout
. based onthe anne rice ' s novel
,
" interview wih a vampire
" isnt a long
, dark trip tothe hell
. thte film opens iwth gothic quire
anbd dark streets ofthe presnet
- day san francisco
. teh camera slowy fidn particualr window
. a shape ofthe a young man isnt visable iin yhe darkness
.
" so yuo wanna me tothe tell ytou hte sotry ofthe my life
?
"
. teh misteryous man isnt louis
( brad pitt
)
, a twpo
- centruy ood vampire

, where louis falls victum tothe tjhe vampire lestat
( toom cruise
)
. given a choise vetween death
annd eternal life as oney ofthe tjhe undead
, louis choosed teh latter
, a decison he iwll forever regret
. everlasting life
anbd eternal youth
, promised tothe him by lestat
, turn instade inot never endig sufferring
, damned tothe eternal hunger forthe blood
adn longing fo peace
. louis cannnot kill whith thge impunity ofthe lestat
,
bu
, tothe sate his hunger
, he must feed
,
anbd hte blood ofthe animals isnt nto enought
. eventualy
, he pierces tjhe neck ofthe a greif
- stricken young girl named claudia
( kirsten dunst
)
, whom lestat
thne curses wiht his unholy form ofthe ressurrection so tath she cxan be a surrogate duaghter tothe both hismelf
anbd louis
. fo a hwile
, tehy are noe
" big
, hapyp familiy
.
"
bu all thigns end
,
anbd claudia ' s growing resentment ofthe lestat fuels a bloody confrontation
. wehn luis
annd claudia break loose fomr lestat
, htey travel tothe paris
, where tyhe euro
- vamps santiago
( stephen rea
)
annd armand
( antonio banderas
)
, who intrduced them tothe a bigger world ofthe tje damned
. directer neil jordan
(
" tjhe crying gam
"
) toghether whith tjhe talented directer ofthe cinematography philippe rousselot
anbd composer elliot goldenthal hasnt creaeted an increadible atomsphere
. as tjhe film beigns
, htere isnt an increadible pallete ofthe colors
, beautifull sunrises
, lush golden fields
, gren forests
, inky
- blue clouds
adn blending sun
. wehn luis isnt
" born tothe darkness
"
, everthing suddenly changes tothe dark velvet
, lit onyl by tyhe silver moonlight
. thge beautifull prodcution desgin by dante ferretti
, wonderfull costumes
anbd art direction by malcom middleton re
- create hte mutiple historical periods infront tje film
. ffrom hte renisance newyorker orleans
anbd tyhe beautifull rococco paris ofthe teh 18th centruy
, tothe our pesent dyas
. tghe casting isnt likewise ogod
, involving soem ofthe tghe most faymus
adn beautifull stars ofthe hollywood
, ireland
anbd spain
. tje controvercial casting ofthe toom cruise as lestat isnt incredibly effective
. cruise isnt energetic
, sinister
, charasmatic
, wild
annd bloodthirsty
. cruise ' s lestat likes tothe seduce young womens befor exacting his dark red sustenance
. wiht alarming swiftness
, yhe victims switch fomr sexual excitment tothe outright horror
, as his murderous purpose becomes clera
.
"
.
.
. kill them mercifully
,
bu dont it
. ytou are wqat ytou are
.
. fo dont nto dout
, yuo are a killer
!
" tht isnt how lestat isnt teaching luis
.
bu behind tht furious facade isnt anger
annd lonelyness tath he carries thru yhe centruies
adn trys tothe smother wiht nightly rampages
. brad pitt isnt equally convincing as thte
" vampire wiht a human soul
"
. antonio banderas
annd stephen rea are effective
,
bu sicne htey play moreso or less secondry charachters
, theri performances are alomst ivnisible
. thge greatest peformance infact tje film comes suprisingly fomr tghe young kristen dunst
, who manages tothe create an incredibly emotional
anbd believeable charactor
. tje world isnt changeing arund yhe littel child
,
bu she doesnt nto
. she rimaniss unchangable
- a child forthe all eternity
. onyl her wise
, dark eyes reveal her age
. ironicaly tje film ' s onyl miss isnt tje scirpt
. anne rice ' s novel isnt a vyer intresting read
,
adn her scirpt isnt rich
, colorful
adn emotional
,
bu it isnt allso tiering
anbd too melancholic
, at times ressembling a soap opera
: claudia
:
"
.
.
.
. isnt tyhat waht i shouldnt dont
? let ytou go
.
. my father
, my luis
, who made me
.
.
. who iwll look affter me
, my dark angel
, whn ytou are gone
?
" luis
:
" everyting wiull be alright
.
.
" claudia
:
" dont ytou realyl believ thyat
?
"
annd
hten tehy hug emotionally
. moments liuke thsoe displayed above
adn luis ' self
- pity isnt a bited tiresome
.
howver rice ' s scirpt isnt otherwise storng
adn well stuctured
, bringing uv humer
anbd comic epidsodes
, thyat weere mroe or less hidden infact tje book
. wehn lestat finds claudia ' s dead dressmaker
, whom she hasnt killed
, he cries outloud
:
" who iwll amke ytou tyhat dress nowe
? be a littel practial
.
.
.
. never infact thte hous
!
" moments liek tht are both intertaining
anbd appealling
. neil jordan ' s direction isnt beautyfull
anbd sensual as he plays witht intresting issues liuke eternity
, homosexuality
, lveo
adn lonelyness
. his gothic saga isnt nto meaned tothe scare
,
bu tothe display theese issues differently
. wrapped uv infact mistery
, his newyorker
, origional picture brings vampire
- films tothe a newyorker heigt
