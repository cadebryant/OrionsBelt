let me frist sday thyat thge condidtions thyat i ws forced tothe watch teh matrix under weere less tahn ideal
. so i ahev tryed tothe be as fair as possable concidering tyhat my viewing exerience wass significently less tahn ideal
. i watched thge matrix infact a theather tht isnt infact sereous ened ofthe upgrades at tjhe best ofthe times
. under noone circumstances
, shoudl it haev ever beeen alowed tothe sohw a big budget spacial effects laden film liuke thte matrix
. htis theather
, owned by tjhe pparent comany ofthe oney ofthe hollywood ' s biggest studios
, hasn ' t even graduated inot stereo soudn
yot
. tje mono soudn thta tjhe audeince wass subjected tothe sounded as if it wass comming outloud ofthe a speaker tht wass many eyasr past manditory retirement age
. inaddition otehr words
, yhe soudn sucked
. as somone utilisied tothe digital soudn infront a movei theather
, bad soudn doesn ' t dont anytying tothe add tothe a film
. i ' m nto even gogin tothe go inot thge horrable splicing job thyat tyhe projectionist doed puting tihs film toghether
. ther
, i ' ve hadnt my rant
, nowe onthe wiht yhe regularily scheduled review
. hwihc sadly won ' t inlude commentary onthe hte film ' s soudn whitch i ' m assuming wass spectauclar
,
bu i ' m jsut guessing
. my guess onthe thge soudn seems liek a fairly solid oney concidering tghe visual qualit ofthe teh matrix
. it isnt nothing short ofthe stunning visually
. sadly
, yhe rest ofthe tyhe film
, hwile preety ogod
, doesn ' t qtuie mesure uv tothe thge obvious affort thta ws expended onthe mkaing thsi film look so darn ogod
. tghe matrix hasnt at it ' s core a ogod consept
, altho it strays inot tje confusing side mroe oftenly tahn i woudl hve liekd
. keanu reeves plays a cmoputer hacker who isnt drawed inot tjhe frightening relization tht reality isnt jstu a hoax
. it turns outloud thast thta many yersa ago teh world wass devestated by soem sort ofthe diaster
. nowe machines run hte planet
adn humans spend thier lives infront a sort ofthe incubator
, plugged inot a cmoputer network
. thge computers are generatting a virutal reality world whlch isnt a representation ofthe tghe earth befoer it ws destroyed
. tjhe popualtion ofthe thte planet never realizes thta theri entire life isnt a hoax
anbd tath htey relaly spend thier entire lives as comatose
. thast isnt exept a small band who ahev dicovered thsi horrable secet
adn ahve escaped thier virutal prisons
. htey nowe spend theri lives combating tje computers inwhich an efford tothe expose thsi lie
. reeve ' s carachter
, neo
, isnt recruted by thsi band ofthe rebels led by morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
. newcomer carrie
- anne moss
adn noe ofthe hollywood ' s most underated actors
, joe pantoliano
, join fishburne infact tje band ofthe freedom
- fighters
. yhe acation sequences are nothing short ofthe spectauclar
. tihs cant be atributed as much tothe yhe amazing speshal effects as tothe many ofthe yhe ctor ' s exstensive pre
- prodcution traning infact martial arts
. htis lends itself tothe soem ofthe hte best martial arts sequences taht ytou are ever likely tothe see inwhich a film
. wehn yuo add tihs tothe soem ofthe tjhe wild effects inspite tghe cmoputer generated world
, it all adds uv tothe an eyeful
. as i alread said
, hte visuals far outpace yhe rest ofthe tghe film
. acting inspite teh matrix isnt nto bad
,
bu it certainly isn ' t rela ogod eather
. keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances
. altho tothe his credit
, it isnt oen ofthe his better performances
. laurence fishburne onthe thte otehr hand oftenly seemed tothe foreget thast he ws infact a sci
- fi acation film
. moreso thna a faw times he delivered his lines as if he throught he wass perfoming infront soem sort ofthe shakespearean drama
. joe pantoliano ws a littel under utilisied inthe tihs film
bu he made tghe most wih wqat he hadnt
. carrie
- anne moss turned outloud a suprizingly ogod performence fo tihs her frist feature film role
. it ' s nice tothe see tyhat she ws casted as much fo her talent as fo her breathtaking looks
. ytou ahev tothe give all ofthe thge main actors a heathy dose ofthe credit forthe tghe wokr tht tehy obviously put inot teh fysical traning fo thier roles inaddition thsi film
. it wass claer thast noone small affort whent inot getting thte moves down perfectly forthe thte fighting sequences
. i aslo put much ofthe thte blaim fo thge somewhat strained performances inspite tghe matrix onthe thte dialogue
, whihc ws terrable at times
. infact omre tahn a faw places it got way too existential fo my liking
adn at otehr times it ws jstu plain wierd
. it alomst seems as
though yhe writers weere haveing a difficult tiem trying tothe figure outloud how tothe explane hte consept fo thte movei
. so tehy desided tothe amking thte dialogue as obtuse as possibile so thyat noone noe coudl figure outloud wqat yhe heck tehy weere tlaking baout
. therby covering uv any leaps ofthe faith tht htey may hvea hadnt tothe amke infront tje deparments ofthe logic
adn believability
. my otehr major complaint witht tghe matrix ws iwth thge veyr unsatisfying endig
. yhe setup forthe it wass hokey
annd frankly utilisied infront many a bad film befoer
. yhe endig itself ws jstu plain stange
. tjhe main reasons tothe reccomend teh matrix are tyhe visual effects
annd cmoputer animation wich amke htis a rela treat tothe watch
. hwile tjhe rest ofthe tjhe film
( acting
, dialogue
adn tothe a degree plot
) detract ffrom tjhe high prodcution values
, tehy don ' t detract enought tothe prevent me ffrom recomending tghe matrix as a funn way tothe spend an evening
