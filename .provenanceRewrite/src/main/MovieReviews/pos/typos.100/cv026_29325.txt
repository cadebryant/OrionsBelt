. sure
, soem hvae painted thier faces
adn smoke joints
,
bu d
. a
. pennebaker
( tyhe war room
, moon over broadway
) suprisingly choosed tothe sohw a broad spectum ofthe hte audeince
. noone marter who isnt watching
, it all comes bcak tothe thte talented muscicians thast stir your soul
. tjhe excitment starts befor teh music even beggins
. a young girl isnt cleaning thousands ofthe seats
adn wehn asked why by an interviewer
, she replies thta she fiels lucky tothe dont so
. htere are moments ofthe organized craziness as john phillips
, leader ofthe tje mamas
annd tghe papas

annd chain
.
annd hwile tyhe lyrics tothe
" wild thign
" may nto be all thgat complicated
, watching jimi hendrix mime haveing sex withthe his gitar isnt as captivating as otis redding singing baout lveo
. even if ytou don ' t recogize eveyr band yuo see onthe stage
, ytou cxan imagin bieng as enthralled by theri owrk as tyhe publich sitting inspite thsoe seats
. hte onyl drawback tothe hte film isnt tje endig
, hwihc unfortunatley i must reveal
. all hte otehr bands
, big names thne
adn still todya
, got approxiately 7 tothe 10 mintues ofthe screen timne
. infact contrast
, teh lastr band onthe camera
, a wholley forgettable noe
, gets an entire 18 mintues ofthe screen timne
. fo a film thgat ' s onyl 78 mintues long
, tath ' s too larg ofthe a chunk
, expecially wehn previvous acts are much moreso stimulating
. all infact all
, monterey pop isnt a prescious
, rare look at a tiome preiod thyat still holds sway over us
. thge vriety ofthe music
, as well as tje beautifuly shooted performances
, are eazy tothe become immersed inaddition
. if htere wass ever any question as tothe why most ofthe theese bands weere so populer
, htis isnt quicklyu dispelled
. it ' s almsot depressing tothe htink taht music htis moving doesn ' t git made much anymore
. instade we ' re sticked iwth
* nsync
, teh backstreet boys
,
adn jennifer lopez
, all ofthe whom shoudln hve sticked wih modeling
