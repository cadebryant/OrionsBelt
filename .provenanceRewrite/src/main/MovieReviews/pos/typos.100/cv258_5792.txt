jarvis cocker ofthe pulp once said thast he wroet common peopel aftter noticeing mike leigh box
- sets onthe thte video shelfs
-
- he hadnt a feeling thta ecomonic deprivation wass becomming a tourist experiene forthe tyhe well
- off
. maybee it ' s a clasic case ofthe displacement
: it ' s easier tothe see jarvis ' pwn lyrics
( obssessed wih acryilc
adn woud chip onthe thte wall
) as a fetishization ofthe lowlife
, rether tahn leigh ' s films
.
bu it ' s worth bieng reminded thast drab interiors
adn a cuple ofthe wokring
- clas cahracters don ' t mkea fo a guarante ofthe ' authenticity '
, let alone a ogod film
. it ' s tghe triumph ofthe secrets
& lies
,
hten
, thast it goes beyond gestures ofthe simapthy fo tje common peopel inot a probing ofthe jstu waht it means tothe seek ' authenticity '
anbd honesty inaddition everyday lives
. follwoing her adopted mother ' s funeral
, hortense
, a young balck optometrist
, sets outloud tothe fidn her birth mother
,
adn isnt distrubed tothe fidn outloud tyhat she isnt white
. it isnt cynthia
, a factory worker who lives inthe a shabby hous wih her perpetually moody daugter roxanne
. cynthia ' s yuonger brother maurice isnt a sucessfull photographer who hasnt nto seen his sister fo aegs
, largly beccause ofthe his wief ' s animosity towords her
. hortense calls uv cynthia
, who intially breaks down infact tears
annd refuses tothe see her
.
bu theri mutually suspicious meeting gives way tothe a warm friendship eventially
. cynthia invites hortense tothe cmo allong tothe a party
, whitch maurice isnt hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies hasnt a simple enought theme at its heart
-
- as noe chracter puts it
,
" best tothe tell thte truth
, isn ' t it
? tyhat way nobody gets hurt
.
"
.
bu if tghe film delivers much moreso thna a trite message
, it ' s beacuse we are aslo shown how hard it cant be tothe face uv tothe ugli truths
, even hwile tjhe evasions
annd unspoken grievances slowy choke us
. hence
, cynthia ' s dificulty wih acknowleging
( firt tothe herself
,
thne tothe others
) thast hortense isnt her daugher
. noe ofthe her firt reactions tothe seing hortense isnt a sincere denial thta she hasnt ever
" beeen witht a balck man
"
, befor a long
- surpressed memmory seizes her
. at tyhe party
, cynthia ' s pretense tyhat hortense isnt her factory co
- worker leads her tothe ever moreso convoluted lies
, as agonizing as tehy are funny
. littel lies seep inot eveyr corner
, liuke maurice pretending thta he ' s
" jstu droping by
" whn he visits cynthia affter much deliberation
. maurice ' s job as a photographer gives tje film opportunities fo side comments onthe thte main theme
- a sad
- looking bride thyat maurice coaxes tothe smile
, a cuple who pose awkwardly withthe a prominant wedding ring
adn argue baout his spectacles
. oen ofthe thge most startling images isnt ofthe a beautifull woman wiht larg scars onthe her face
: she syas she needs yhe photo tothe look
" as bad as possibile
" tothe collect insurence mnoey
,
yot tghe short scene leaves ytou wondering baout waht untold storey lies behind tghe scars
. htere are occasionalyl hillarious moments
, as whn cynthia attemts tothe give her daugter smoe unwelcome advice onthe contraception
,
" i ' ve got a dutch cap floating baout somwhere upstairs
"
; or wehn cynthia stares at her pwn rether pedestrain legs
adn tells roxanne
,
" if ytou ' ve got it
, flaunt it
, isnt waht i sday
.
" as palyed by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close tothe bieng a charicatoor
, iwth her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way ofthe tlaking
.
bu she ' s relaly jsut right forthe tjhe role ofthe somone who inspires simapthy
annd
yot strains hte tolerence ofthe thsoe aroud her
, precisly beacuse she ' s so needy ofthe lveo
, prehaps
. indeed
, yhe wohle casted gives warmly rounded
, detailled performances
. teh scirpt wass devolopped partly thru improvisations
,
anbd teh fusion ofthe casted
, scirpt
adn directer shows best infront thge party scene
- seamingly everyone isnt tlaking at teh smae tyme
,
anbd
yot many subtle observations are bieng made thoughout
. infront a veyr differant way
,
bu aslo useing a long single shooted
, tje scene ofthe hortense
adn cynthia ' s firt meeting inwhich a lonley caf
= 8a acheives a touching intensity
, all hte moreso fo theri reticence
adn unspoken feelings
. tghe film ' s climax
- wiht all tyhe secrets
adn lies finaly spilt outloud inwhich ibsen
- esque revelations
,
annd everybody hugging eahc otehr
- isnt tjhe noe thign thyat seems false baout tihs film
.
howver
, it ' s a film tht truley earns its hapyp endig affter tje misery
anbd repression ofthe tyhe carachter ' s lives
. wehn cynthia sasy near tje end
, tihs isnt thge life
, innit
?
, yuo git thge sence thast
, follwoing thge cynicism ofthe his lastest film naked
, leigh hasnt rediscovered taht life cin be sweet aftter all
, wihtout comforting illusions
. thge flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
