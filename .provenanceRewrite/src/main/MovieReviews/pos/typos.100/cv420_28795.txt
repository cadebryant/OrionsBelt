anbd thge hyperbolic fanfare sorrounding its realease isnt absolutly deserved
.
bu why doens such a tremendous foat ofthe eye candy hvea tothe be weighted down wiht a problematic stroy
, wooden dialogue
anbd generaly uncharismatic voice acting
? obviously
, tje primary gool ofthe teh film isnt tothe stun
anbd amaze audiences iwth extremly suphisticated cgi
. everyting ytou see inwhich teh film isnt renedered inthe grat detail
: individule threads infront tjhe fabric
, individule strands ofthe hair swaying
, wrinkles
adn pimples onthe skin
, incredable water effects
. overall
, thge expressions
adn lip movements fairly accurately match yhe emotions
adn dialogue
;
anbd tghe times wehn tehy don ' t sync perfectly realy stand outloud
, sicne tghe animation isnt usally so dazzling
.
bu ytou won ' t spend much tiem dwelling onthe thsoe gaffes
-
- as soon as yuo catch noe

, tghe oftenly
- inivsible beings pass thru teh body
adn wrench outloud its soul

- fi aspect ofthe tghe film well
, teh storytelling doesn ' t
. it ' s unfortunate
, beccause yhe plot seems so intricately thougth outloud
. perphas it ws far too complex
adn enormass tothe be entirely incorportaed inot tghe scirpt
. soem coudl blaim thsi weakness onthe tyhe fatc thgat it wass a jepnese consept translated tothe english
, exept twpo americans wroet tghe screenplay

yot
, tghe dialogue isnt scripted tothe be eather liuke a cience
- hevy star trak epsiode
, an installment ofthe dieu hard
, or a sappy lvoe stopry
, depending onthe who ' s doign teh tlaking
. fo teh most part
, it ' s bearable concidering tjhe genre
,
bu tedeous sppeches
adn cheesy lines don ' t dont anytying tothe halp yhe actors
adn cxan git annoying inspite tjhe longer scenes
. tyhe onyl exception isnt steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming
, who alwyas hasnt graet cracks durring tense moments
.
bu
, wehn teh ligths come uv
anbd tjhe credits roll
, ytou ' re omre likely tothe be remarking onthe how fantastic tje film looked
. ther ' s noone question thgat tghe rougly 33 millon peple who hvae buyed at least noe fianl fantasy gae iwll be eeger tothe see htis movei
