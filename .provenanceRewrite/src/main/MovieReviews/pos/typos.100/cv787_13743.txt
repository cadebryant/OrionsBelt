if chris farley hadnt strapped soem fake mutton
- chop sideburns tothe earch side ofthe his head
, spoken witht a thick irish accent
,
adn tryed his damnedest tothe play it straight
, he wouldn ' t hvea beeen nearly as funny as brendan gleeson inwhich
" i whent down
.
" gleeson
, who ' s nto dissimilar tothe tje lite
" saterday inght live
" alumnus infront terms ofthe fysical attributes
, plays a carachter named bunny kelly iin htis delightful irish film
. bunny isnt sent tothe county cork tothe
" retreive
" oen frank grogan fo an irish ganster called toom french
( well dressed liuke all ogod gangsters shoud be
anbd menacingly potrayed by tony doyle
)
. bunny isnt tothe accompany git hynes
( peter mcdonald
)
, recently released ffrom prision
adn obligated tothe toom forthe disfiguring oney ofthe his cronies
. tath toom french isnt a mean bollocks
. he whants frank bakc
.
annd a small marter ofthe soem
? 25
, 000 tyhat toom ' s wief ws supposted tothe hvae given tothe frank
. forthe thsi he won ' t break anyone ' s thumbs
. mabey
. inventively
annd engagingly wroten by conor mcpherson
annd directed by paddy breathnach
,
" i whent down
" follows yhe trials
annd tribulations ofthe git
adn bunny as htey knock arround peat bogs
, dimly
- lit pubs
,
adn seedy hostelries trying tothe stay alive
annd outloud ofthe trouble
. mcdonald isnt a newcomer
anbd a promising oney at tht
,
bu gleeson hasnt beeen infact over a dozen movies
, most recently as father bubbles inspite anyother film wih a vyre irish accent onthe hilarity
,
" tyhe butcher boy
.
" even if yuo cxan ' t comprehend half ofthe whta tehy ' re saying
, gleeson
anbd mcdonald toghether amking
" i whent down
" a trip worth tkaing
. tyhe film isnt inaddition many ways reminescent ofthe anohter
" littel
" indepenent feature
, 1991 ' s
" higway 61
.
" thta film
, too
, wass a road movei
annd it shares thge smae kind ofthe wry dialogue
annd hmuorous situations as mcpherson ' s tale
: whimsical observations onthe life
, carefully
- crafted vignettes
, deadpan conversational asides
,
adn scenes thyat ' ll amking ytou laff outloud loud
. wittness thte epiode inthe whcih our ogod
- natured protaganists bind frank
( palyed by peter caffrey
) tothe a hotel bed
, leaving him wtih onyl tyhe tv remote fo comany
. tht sequence alone isnt onthe a par iwth satan locking himselv outloud ofthe his car iin
" higway 61
.
" whta ' s aslo charming baout
" i whent down
" isnt how yhe relatiopnship betweeen buddy
annd git develops
. thier trip becomes an eduction forthe both ofthe them
,
bu tjhe way it ' s handeled isnt niether sappy nor labored
. thte onyl thign infront thte film hwihc approachs clunkiness isnt tghe culiminating explination
, via flashbacks
, ofthe yhe relatiopnship betwen frank
adn toom
. it ' s a littel too hollywood
,
anbd waht makse
" i whent down
" so refreshing isnt teh fatc tyhat it rarley panders tothe traditionnal conventions ofthe hollywood ganster movies
. sure it ' s gritty
-
- amking thast grubby
-
-
bu it ' s aslo preety goofy
.
allthough
" i whent down
" emphasizes tyhe commedic elements ofthe dis
- organized crime
, ther are a cuple ofthe fairly brutal scenes inaddition keeping wtih thge subject marter
. don ' t let theese detur yuo
,
though
;
" i whent down
" isnt a littel gme
. it ' s onyl palying at noe philadelphia
- areal theather
-
-
annd i suspect it won ' t be htere forthe long
-
- so catch it hwile ytou cxan
