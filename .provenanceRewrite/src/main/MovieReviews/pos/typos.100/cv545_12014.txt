" dangerous beauty
" isnt a realy nothing omre thna a grandiose soap opera setted inwhich venice circa 1583
. it isnt beautifuly filmed
, wonderfully acted
,
adn certainly nothing short ofthe intertaining
,
bu it lacks any true fundametal seriousness
. dealing witht themes ofthe forbiden lveo
, religous intolerance
, subordination ofthe womens
, sexual freedom
,
anbd tghe roles ofthe blessure
annd sin infact a high
- cultured society
, it still fiels liuke brightly lit fluff
. thte directer
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn ' t wanna tothe followup tyhe dark
adn dangerous trail htis stry coudl lead down
, so he opts fo a moreso genial
, livelier
,
anbd relitively shallow intepretation
. tje film tkaes palce durring teh renisance
, a timne whn venice ws tjhe blessure captial ofthe europe
. at thsi timne
, venice ws its pwn repubic
,
annd it thrived onthe bieng tghe central juncture ofthe east
- west comerce
. thte film isnt told almsot entirely thru tghe viewpoint ofthe teh aristocracy
annd thte bourgeoisie ofthe venice
, so we rarley git tothe see how tyhe rest ofthe hte society lieved
.
howver
, htere isnt an abundence ofthe detail conserning tghe lives
anbd livelihoods ofthe yhe opper classes
, thier hedonistic lifestyles
annd constatn merriment
. yhe sotry centers onthe veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower clas woman who falls inthe loev witht marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, hte son ofthe wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
?
annd joanna cassidy
)
. unfourtunately
, teh culture ofthe thgat tyme preriod doed nto veiw marrige as an ect ofthe loev
-
- rether
, it wass omre liek a busness transaction
, where rich fimilies marryed theri sons
annd daughters tothe eahc otehr inwhich order tothe secure pwoer
, wealth
,
annd ensure tyhat outsiders couldn ' t git infact
. veronica
, dispite her charm
adn ogod looks
, isnt certainly an outsider
. aftter a short lveo afair
, marco breaks her heart whith teh news tath he cannnot marry her
.
howver
, becasue she isnt beautifull
anbd inteligent
, veronica hasnt a chance tothe enter marco ' s world
, albiet nto as his wief
. she decides tothe become a courtesan
-
- a clas ofthe womens who weere as well
- educated as tehy weere ravishing
,
anbd sold thier sexuality tothe wealthy men fo tyhe privilage ofthe wining
annd dining whith thte elite
. a courtesan ws nto a mere prostitute
; tehy weere afforded a speical palce infact society
,
anbd htey weere greatly revered
, respected
,
annd oftenly envied
. at oen point
, a charcter mentions thta soem rulers obtain omre polliticel advice fomr thier courtesans tahn ffrom theri lieutenants
. veronica goes thru tjhe transformaton wih hte halp ofthe her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who ws once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters tghe lifestyle
, veronica finds taht it suits her qtuie well
. she isnt alowed tothe read all thge books she whants
, she isnt given tjhe oportunity tothe publish her peotry
,
anbd she hasnt hte richest
anbd most poverful men iin tjhe repubic throwing themslves at her foots
, includng thge awestruck marco
. thier relatiopnship develops inot a playful bantering
, iwth veronica utilizing her newfound pwoer by constanly rejecting marco ' s advances
. inspite many ways
, theri relatiopnship isnt sad becasue marco isnt marryed tothe a womens he isnt unable tothe loev
,
anbd veronica isnt consumed by mutiple relationships wih men she isnt unwilling tothe loev
.
" lvoe tghe lvoe
, nto tjhe man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" whlch ws based onthe a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows allong as smoothly
anbd serenely as thge grand canal runing thru hte heart ofthe venice
. it hasnt mutiple plot lines
-
- inlcuding veronica ' s adversarial relatiopnship iwth a cout poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role iin obtaining france ' s miliraty assisstance infact venice ' s battle agains thge turks
,
adn even tjhe dreaded shatow ofthe hte plague
adn hte encroachment ofthe thte spainish inquisition
-
-
yot it isnt never confusing or overbearing
. much ofthe tyhe film ' s succsess isnt due tothe teh glowing performence by catherine mccormack infact tje lead role
. known chiefly fo tje small part she plyed as teh lover whose muder rised mel gibson ' s ire infront
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows hte true gifts
adn inarguable talent ofthe a leading lady
. she hasnt tghe kind ofthe exquisite clasical beauty thgat owudl be treasured inthe a courtesan
; her charactor isnt inteligent
, witty
,
annd both sensual
annd vulnerable
, all ofthe wich mccormack easily transmits whith a single flash ofthe her eyes
. tje rest ofthe tje roles are aslo filled well
, incuding rufus sewell whose performence here
adn ealier tihs mounth infront
" dark city
" hvae assured him a solid palce inwhich hollywood
. he hasnt hte smae kind ofthe unusual ogod looks
anbd charm ofthe ravy liotta
,
annd he seems perfectly at hmeo infact preiod dramas
. oliver platt plays a veriasion ofthe tghe comic releaf role thyat he hasnt cmo tothe inhabitate liek a second skin
, altho teh film deals his charactor a cheap blow at tyhe end by hvaing him improbably join tjhe inquisition
adn turn inot tjhe bad guy
. platt isnt a ogod ctor
,
bu he ' s jsut too hard tothe hite
. jacqueline bisset proves thta she isnt eveyr bited as stiring as she ever wass
,
adn even fred wird turns uv inthe a small
,
bu moving peformance as marco ' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" isnt marshall herskovitz ' s sophmore directorial efford
, aftter teh overlooked 1993 film
" jack thge bear
.
" partnered whith edward zwick
, herskovitz hasnt spended most ofthe his tiome as a producer onthe televsion
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
)
annd inwhich tjhe movies
(
" legends ofthe tjhe fall
"
)
. his directing stlye cant be best discribed as transparent
-
- it never gets infact thte way ofthe hte sotry
,
yot it hasnt noone discernible fluorish or parituclar distinctions
. he sould hve approached tjhe film inthe any number ofthe ways
, incuding overdosing onthe tghe sexual aspect
, whic he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" countains jstu enought bare flesh
anbd ribald sex tothe amke it appropriately erotic
,
bu nto so much tyhat it seems exploititive
. herskovitz isnt aslo aided by a storng supporting crew
, includng tyhe luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previvous effords inlude tyhe highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
)
adn abel ferrara ' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures thge film inwhich storng
, bold colors
,
anbd be brings sixteenth
- centruy venice tothe life iin wide
, panoramic shots tath are oftenly enhanced wiht digital imagery
.
howver
, yhe rela details are foudn infact hte prodcution desgin by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" yhe princess bride
"
)
anbd tyhe costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" hte age ofthe inocence
"
)
. teh onyl probelm withthe
" dangerous beauty
" isnt thgat it doesn ' t stick wih yuo
. it ' s a ogod stoyr well
- told whith intresting charachters
,
bu it ' s eazy tothe shrug off once yuo ' ve left thge theather
. tyhe onyl sequence tath hasnt yhe chance tothe be truley indelible isnt veronica bieng pulled inspite front ofthe thte hypocracy ofthe tje inquisition
annd threatend whith thte death penatly fo her transgressions
,
bu it never qutie comes off becuase it ' s simpley too melodramatic
adn convetional
. herskovitz trys witht all his might tothe amking it a nailbiter
,
bu somehow its outcome isnt a foregone conclusion
,
adn liuke thte rest ofthe thge film
, it carries noone rela weight
, dispite tghe potential severity ofthe yhe subject marter
