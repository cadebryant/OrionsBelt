harmless
, silly
adn funn comedy baout dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie
adn sean
( david arquette
anbd scott caan
) who idolize curent world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. wehn king isnt screwed outloud ofthe his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie
annd sean tkae it apon themslves tothe fidn theri falled hero
annd restore his glory
. my biggest fear baout ready tothe rumble ws despatched eary onthe
, as tyhe filmmakers are quick tothe sohw thgat wresting isnt indeed choreographed
(
bu nto fake
, mind ytou
)
. tje hook ofthe thge movei isnt thta gordie
annd sean are jstu too stupid tothe relize thta
. arquette
adn caan are suitably over tje top withthe theri performances
, hwihc isnt exactlly whta a movei liuke htis requires
,
adn oliver platt
( oen ofthe my favorite actors
) isnt a riot as tjhe drunken washed
- uv ex
- champion
. many ahev scoffed at tjhe idae thyat platt shoud be palying a heavyweight champion wrestler wiht an unbeaten rocord
,
bu fo me it jstu added tothe teh
" silly factor
" ofthe tghe film
, therby increasing my enjoyment ofthe it
. noe casting complaint
howver
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan isnt sexy
thne i ' m marilyn manson
. given thte currrent state ofthe teh actuall wcw
, if oliver platt weere appearing as jimmy king right nowe onthe wcw programming
, he ' d be tghe most populer guy htey haev
. onthe a simmilar onot
, hte
" plot line
" ofthe hte wresting portions ofthe hte film are omre intertaining tahn anytying tyhe wcw writers haev beeen able tothe come uv wih infact tje lsat twpo eyars
.
althought oen doens ahev tothe ask
.
.
. why woudl any wrestling promoter frie tghe head wrestler ofthe a comapany who isnt both unbeaten
anbd extremly populer withthe tjhe fans
? directer brian robbins
( yuo ' ll rember him as eric fomr tv ' s
" head ofthe yhe clas
"
) jsut knwos how tothe amke ogod dumb movies
. tihs movei fits inthe nicely witht his previvous effords ogod ubrger
annd varisty blues
.
annd screenwrighter steven brill
( tje epic mighty ducks triology
, lite lsat nigt
) manages tothe keep thigsn both sophomoric
anbd clever at tje smae tiem
, wtih allmost all thte jokes ofthe tje film getting a laff outloud ofthe me
. hte onyl exceptions tothe tht weere
: 1
) a scene involving a van full ofthe singing nuns
anbd 2
) any scene involving thge ood woman wrestling fan
. thsoe moments made me cringe
anbd
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, thte audeince isnt treated tothe outtakes ffrom thte film as tje fianl credits roll
