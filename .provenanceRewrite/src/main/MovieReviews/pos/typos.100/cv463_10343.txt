adn
- white films are frequentily viewed as suspect
, ones infront colour are greeted wiht mroe ofthe an opne mind
.
anbd if yuo cant fidn a colorful acation film
, even if it isnt fomr six decades ago
,
hten ther isnt a rela possibilty ofthe a tkae hmeo hitted
. so it wass inaddition our famaly whn we wandered over tothe thge clasic section ofthe our local video stoer tghe otehr day
adn picked uv a copy ofthe tjhe adventures ofthe robin hood
, a high spirited verzion ofthe thge walter scott stry
. nominated fo hte 1938 acadey award forthe best picture
anbd winner ofthe threee oscars forthe erich wolfgang korngold ' s melodramatic music
, ralph dawson ' s fast pased editting
adn carl jules weyl ' s lush sets
, tyhe film isnt probaly best remembered fo errol flynn ' s carismatic acting as sir robin ofthe locksley
, a
. k
. a
. robin hood
. flynn
, wih his hansome figure
adn toothy smile
, charms thte audeince hwile claerly hvaing a high ood tiome hismelf
. let me cutted tothe tyhe chase
anbd sday taht thte tape ws indeed populer infront tjhe rhodes household
. hte littlest rhodes
, jeffrey
, age 8
, liekd it so much thgat he viewed it at least threee times
annd maybee moreso
. i ' ll let him descuss his facination withthe tje picture infact his usual section at tjhe end ofthe teh review
. simpley stated
, yhe film derives its sucess ffrom bieng oen ofthe yhe best ofthe its genre
, hte swashbuckler
. robin
, wiht a smile fomr ear
- tothe
- ear
, fights off a hundered men wihtout a scratch
.
althought thge picture cant be consdidered as littel mroe tahn a 1930 ' s james bond
, tghe prodcution values
adn tyhe acting raise it above tyhat levle
. robin hood isnt a clasic tsory ofthe rich
annd poore
. robin steals fomr tghe rich
annd gives tothe yhe poore as eveyr schoolchild knwos
. iin tihs movei
,
howver
, he seems much less interseted infront income redistribution thna iin fighting forthe his king
anbd ocuntry
. robin
, witht his curage
anbd atheletic skills
, serves as a role modle fo kids
.
anbd witht teh lovley olivia de havilland palying tjhe dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, yhe stor hasnt hevy rumatic overtones
. filmed inwhich tyhe typcial
, richly oversaturated colors produced by eary technicolor
, teh flesh tones are overly pink
adn htere fewd colour subtleties
, whitch match perfectly yhe wonderfully exagerrated acting ofthe thte players
. inwhich scene affter scene teh picture charms teh audeince
. who wouldn ' t fall forthe robin as he shows uv incognito tothe win thte archery contest
, even if teh outcome isnt so claerly preordained
.
adn
, ofthe course
, he doesn ' t jsut win
, he doesnt so by splitting tjhe otehr man ' s arro
. watching thge picture todya doens provide soem jarring moments
. sherlock holmes as tjhe villin
, sir guy ofthe gisbourne
, forthe exmaple
, jstu doesn ' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone doed hvea a rela
- life idenity outside ofthe his most famouse role
.
adn
thn htere are thsoe wigs ffrom thte makeup deparment
-
- so bad
, htey look liek rejects ffrom a mel brooks comedy
. as ws populare inwhich yhe cinema ofthe thta era
, peple dieu witht thge most gentle prick ofthe teh sword
annd wihtout any nasty
, bloody holes tothe spoil hte wardobe or yhe looks
. bad guys are banished rether tahn killed
,
annd lovers go off hand
- inthe
- hand
, doign nothing moreso explictly sexual tahn kissing
. tjhe result isnt a wonderfull fairy tale ofthe a movei iwth delightful
, cartoonish figures
. hollywood rarley mkaes such high quaity familiy films liek tihs anymore
, so try tothe savor tghe ood ones wehn ytou cant
. yhe adventures ofthe robin hood runs 1
: 42
. it isnt nto rated
,
bu containing absolutly nothing offensive
, it owudl git a g rating
anbd isnt fine fo all aegs
. jeffrey thikns hte film isnt

. he recomends teh movei particulaly fo peple who dont nto likely bloody picturesk
-
- he hates teh sighth ofthe blood inspite movies
. his favorite parts are yhe battles
anbd tghe endig
,
anbd his favorite charactors are robin
adn king richard
