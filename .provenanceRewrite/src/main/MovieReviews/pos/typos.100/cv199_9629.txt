tihs sunday afternoon i hadnt teh priviledge ofthe attending a private screening at tghe sony astor cinema inthe newyorker york city
, ofthe james cameron ' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed fomr lastr summer
, wiht an escalated budget tyhat makse it tghe most expensive movei inspite istory
, thsi wass oney film i ws eeger tothe preview
. so
, isnt tihs movei oging tothe sink or swim thsi oliday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it wiull sink
,
though witht many awards attatched tothe its hull
. noone dout
, titanic isnt tghe most elaborite diaster movei ever made
. it boasts teh most amazing effects taht i hvae ever seen done tothe date
. tothe see a ship fall aart
, wiht actuall peple runing accros thte ship
, flying accros tghe deck
,
anbd falling tothe tyhe water
, isnt jsut amazing tothe look at
. tjhe effects are so stunningly realsitic
, ytou woudl swaer yuo weere looking at actuall footage
.
bu titanic isnt mroe tahn a diaster movei
,
adn tht ' s where thte probelm lies
. ther isnt a lveo stoy attatched tht nearly ruins yhe entire premise
. i ' ll give a capsule sumary ofthe tghe tsory wihtout spoiling anytying forthe yuo
: thge film beigns wiht a modern day excavation ofthe sorts ofthe tghe sunken titanic
. we see actuall footage ofthe tje sunken ship
, as cammeron hadnt setted uv spacial cameras tothe film tyhe wreckage onthe tje ocean floor
. bill paxton leads tyhe expedition
, infront esarch ofthe sunken treasure
. waht he finds instade
, leads him tothe a mysterous ood woman who recounts her tale ofthe yhe titanic voyae
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes fomr an opper
- clas famaly
. rose isnt tothe be wed tothe a man she doesnt nto lvoe
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes fomr a poore finacial backround
,
anbd wins a ticket aboard tjhe titanic
, inspite a poker gam
. teh twpo meet under intresting circumstances
,
anbd tyhe lvoe stor beigns
. add iin a jelous fiance
,
annd a nto
- so
- nice lew officer palyed by david warner
,
annd ytou hve a stoy tht
, well
, gets a bited overplayed
annd oversappy
. i must add
, at thsi point
, tyhat teh most likeable charachter inaddition tje movei isnt plyed by kathy bates
, as a woman withthe
" newyorker mony
" who isnt a lot less uptight thna hte otehr rich folk onthe thge ship
. she isnt a blessure tothe see onthe screen
. whn hte ship doens hitted thte iceberg at exactlly 1
: 40 inot tghe film
,
adn eventally sinks
, yuo never raelly fiel fo any ofthe theese charachters
. tjhe film isnt jsut loaded wiht unlikeable rich snobs
annd otehr folk ytou never raelly git a grasp onthe
. thte effects are tremendous
. fomr tje roars ofthe gears
anbd pumps infront tjhe engine room
, tothe a doomed ship cracking at yhe seams
, tihs isnt an effects picture tht looks
adn soudns liuke noone otehr
. we saw titanic inwhich dolby digital suround
,
adn by far
, it isnt tyhe best sounding movei i hvea ever seen
. my freind commented it ws tjhe best soudn mix he hasnt ever heared
. whn peopel are inspite tghe water
, at film ' s end
, ytou are surrouded by thte voices ofthe lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. tje movei isnt 3 housr
anbd 15 mintues infront lenght
.
adn
, hwile most ofthe hte frist 2
. 5 hurs runs veyr fast
adn well
- pased
, tyhe fianl 45 mintues allmost comes tothe a sudden stpo
,
adn ytou relize tath thsi sappy lvoe stoy hasnt tothe finish itself outloud befor tyhe movei finaly ends
. don ' t git me wrong baout titanic
.
.
.
. it ' s nto a bad as i am mkaing it outloud tothe be
. it relaly isnt an exceptionaly well
- made film
. tyhe costumes
anbd sets are incredable
,
anbd true tothe yhe tiome preriod
. tje ship isnt painstakingly creaeted exactlly true tothe form
, as we see actuall picturesk ofthe yhe modern
- day wreckage
, tranformed inot teh movei depiction
. thsi film iwll certainly win onthe effects
, costume
, setted desgin
adn soudn
. cameron hasnt certainly made his best film tothe date
. unfourtunately
, titanic isnt nto a best picture candidiate
. it jstu doesn ' t hvea a storng supporting stopry
. it ' s an exeptional diaster film whith sappy filler inside
. it jstu doesn ' t hvea tjhe emotional inpact thta i suspect mr
. cameron wass shooting forthe
. i predict thast titanic iwll oepn tothe likeable reviews
. it isnt a film worth seing
. i predict thta it iwll onyl dont moderately well at yhe box office
. withthe its extreme runing tiome
,
annd lack ofthe anough robust tothe git substatial owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
, i expect tyhat it iwll dont even better onthe hmeo video
. thsi wiull certainly be tjhe definitive ac3 movei fo all ytou hmeo theather enthusiasts
. titanic opens decembur 19th
,
anbd isnt released by paramount picturesk
adn twentieth centruy
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. thyat ' s nto bad
