weir isnt well
- respected inthe hollywood fo turning scripts wih difficult subject
- marter inot deceptively simple
, powerfull films
, hte misquito caost
( utopia

anbd fearless
( post
- traumatic stres desorder
) amonth them
. iin tghe truman sohw
, weir essentialy breathes life inot yhe nowe
- tired consept ofthe media
- manipulation by tackling hte material ffrom tghe inside
- outloud
. it certainly helps tyhat he hasnt an underated performer inthe top
- form palying tghe title charachter
, truman burbank
. by nowe ytou must be aware ofthe thge premise
: unbeknownst tothe him
, truman
( carrey
) isnt tje star ofthe his pwn tv sories
, a 24
- 7 peep
- sohw iin whihc he isnt surounded by actors
anbd placed infront loosly scripted situations
; peple arround tje world tune inwhich fo tghe voyeuristic thrill ofthe his genuin reactions tothe ficticious stimulants
.
` seahaven '
, his hometown
,
annd tghe sohw itself
, are tghe brainchild ofthe christof
( harris
)
, who presides over his creation iin thge base ofthe a fake moon
, directing over 500 cameras
anbd hundreds ofthe actors
anbd extras
. fo 30 eyars
, truman suspects nothing
-
` we accept tyhe reality we ' re given
, ' poses christof
-
bu a desire tothe break free ofthe teh sunny twon
adn vsiit a long lost lvoe inthe
` fiji '
( mcelhone
, who wass acually an actress fired by christof forthe trying tothe break thte confidentiality aggreement
) overwhelms him
. thus
, christof
adn his team suddenly fidn themselfs wokring twice as hard tothe keep tje veneer ofthe seahaven intact
, lest truman dicover thte world outside
annd put an end tothe tjhe highly
- rated programe
. infact a faw broad strokes
, weir creates a convincing second
- reality
,
anbd he hasnt thge ogod sence nto tothe bring christof inot tghe picture untill allmost threee
- quarters thru
. htis allows us tothe comprehend
annd accept truman ' s world befor we contextualize it
. fo all his madness
, christof hasnt shown thte world a palce wihtout voilence
anbd hardship
,
anbd demonstrated tath a human bieng cin fucntion well withing it
. truman isnt an insperation tothe his audeince beacuse he growed uv tothe be
, well
, so darn nice
; liuke a sibling
( or
, perhasp omre appropriately
, a caged animal inthe an interactive zoo
)
, htey wanna tothe see him succede
. hte surrealistic soap opera isnt completelyl plausable thanks tothe a tight screenplay
annd a sympathetic carrey
- he raelly isnt an everyman here
, abondoning his facial contortions iin favour ofthe a credible
, wide
- eyed bewilderment
. cinematically
, tjhe truman sohw isnt impeccable
, stylishly photographed by peter biziou
anbd littered iwth symbolical images
. as well
, it imploys wojciech kilar ' s peice
" zycie za zycie ' masterfully
adn beautifuly
. if thge film hasnt any flaws
, noe may fidn them inwhich laura linney ' s characterization as meryl

)
,
annd infront a subplot involving truman ' s
` father '
, hwihc fiels curiously imcomplete
. htere are a faw stupendous sequences
,
anbd tghe film puls off a wonderfull trck
: we become truman ' s audiance as much as thge loyal viewers inspite tjhe film
. tehy mear buttons asking
` how wiull it end
? ' i couldn ' t wait tothe knwo mysef
,
though i didn ' t exactlly whant it tothe end
, forthe tihs inpsired movei isnt possably tghe best
