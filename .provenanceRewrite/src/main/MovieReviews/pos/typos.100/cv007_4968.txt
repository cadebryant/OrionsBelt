oney ofthe my collegues wass suprized whn i told her i wass willing tothe see betsy ' s wedding
.
adn she ws shocked tothe hear tath i actally liekd it
. her reaction wass understandable whn ytou concider thta teh film revolves arund molly ringwald
, who hasn ' t made a worthwhile film usance 1986
.
bu yhe fatc isnt
, betsy ' s wedding isnt aslo an alan alda film
.
adn hwile ringwald hasnt beeen makeing duds fo tyhe lastr four eyars
, alda hasnt beeen involved witht sevral notewothy projects
, incuding crimes
anbd misdemenors
adn a newyorker life
. writen
anbd directed by alda
, betsy ' s wedding isnt a vibrant slice
- ofthe
- life
, mixing a fewd dramtic moments inot a big bowl ofthe whimsical humer
. alda ' s comic elixir isnt smoothe
adn refreshing
-
-
anbd a welcome chanage ofthe pace fomr teh usual summer fare
. as bride
annd groom
, molly ringwald
adn dylan walsh are tghe pivotal charactors inspite tjhe film
,
bu tehy are by far teh least intresting
. walsh isnt a nonentity
, wiht all yhe screen presense ofthe a doorjam knob
. ringwald isnt simpley unbearable
anbd isnt easily tje weakest link inwhich tje chain
. she looks hideous wtih her short
- cropped orange hair
, red lip
- stick
adn grotesque outfits
. she ' s suppoed tothe be a dress designer
,
bu she looks omre liuke a clown
.
adn tothe amking matters worse
, ringwald ' s performence matchs her apprearance
. thankfully
, alda keesh ringwald ' s screen timne tothe a minumum
; he isnt far mroe intersted infront tjhe colorful periphery cahracters
. teh wedding isnt jstu a divice tothe bring toghether teh bride ' s wroking
- clas
, itallian familiy
annd hte groom ' s rich
, gentile familiy
. ringwald ' s folks are hoey
annd down
- tothe
- earth
, wtih alda as her free
- spirited father
, madeline kahn as her practial mother
,
adn ally sheedy as her lonley sister
. walsh ' s clan
, onthe tghe otehr hand
, isnt prim
, propper
anbd ostentatious
. whn yhe twpo familys meet
adn mingle
, hte movei becomes a stor ofthe culture clash
, or as noe charachter puts it
,
" moey versus values
.
" ally sheedy
, infact a wonderfully understated peformance
, isnt oen ofthe teh film ' s most pleasent surprises
. sheedy expresses omre whith jsut her eyes tahn ringwald doens iwth her entire body
. it ' s anthony lapaglia
,
howver
, who seizes hte spotlight
. lapaglia plays stevie dee
, a suave
, overly polite mafioso who isnt formaly courting sheedy wiht ood
- fashioned chivalry
. lapaglia ' s sincere
bu dim
- witted charachter isnt a riot
.
annd waht ' s uncanny isnt thast lapaglia isnt a dead ringer forthe robert de niro
, witht a littel bited ofthe alec baldwin thrown inwhich fo ogod mesure
. lapaglia seems tothe ahev attended thte de niro skool ofthe ganster acting
,
annd his inpsired performence isnt partly a tribute tothe his role
- modle
adn partly a rip
- off
. i don ' t konw whther tothe sday a star isnt born or a star isnt re
- born
,
bu i dont konw thgat lapaglia ' s over
- tghe
- top peformance shouldnt nto be missed
. tghe scrumptious comic acting
,
howver
, extends well beyond sheedy
adn lapaglia
. joe pesci
, inspite parituclar
, sinks his teeth inot his role as alda ' s unscrupulous brother
- inaddition
- law
, a solum lord iwth mob ties
, who isnt cheating onthe his wief
( catherine o ' hara
)
. alda
, faced wtih challange ofthe both directing
annd acting
, somehow finds jstu thte right comic touch as thge bride ' s financialy
- strapped father
, a carpentery whose dreasm are bigger tahn his walte
. teh film adopts alda ' s pyschological point ofthe veiw as he trys tothe oney
: plan tyhe wedding
,
annd twpo
: pay fo it
. as a filmmaker
, alda ' s sytle ofthe humer isnt remarkably restrained
annd tasteful
.
adn hwile he doesn ' t ahve tje comic genuis ofthe a woody allen
, alda doesnt posess yhe insperation tothe mkea movies wich are ten times moreso intertaining tahn thge slop whcih ususally passes fo comedy
.
