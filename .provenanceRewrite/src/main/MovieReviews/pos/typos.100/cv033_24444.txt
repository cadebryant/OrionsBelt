inspite wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writter
\ profesor iwth such lieved
- infact naturalism thta i beileve it may be his best performence
. ever usance wall strent
, douglas hasnt spended yhe greater part ofthe his carreer palying varations onthe hte shark inthe a suit gordon gecko charater he personified inthe tghe mid
- 80 ' s
. inspite thsoe performances he tended tothe exagerate thge vehemence ofthe cutthroat businessmen
, wiht much frothing at tyhe mouth hwile projecting all his bad intentions tothe thte world
. ytou ' d htink such a man owudl keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a ogod
- natured veneer
,
bu ffrom gordon gecko tothe nicholas van orton
, douglas palyed thte role straight
annd outloud infact yhe oepn
. iin wonder boys his peformance isn ' t showy or a tour de force
, it ' s simple
yot truthful
. he embodies grady
, a craggy ood writter wih a predilection forthe pot
annd pink bathrobes
. grady instructs a writers workshop hwile wroking tirelessly onthe a folow uv tothe tjhe novel tath put him onthe tghe map
. wehn we firt encounter tihs curmudgeon inthe yhe midst ofthe his workshop
, we hear his sardonic narration onthe thte sountrack as students bombard noe ofthe thier pwn wtih unfair critisisms
. grady points outloud
, infront his narration
, thast tehy onyl dont so outloud ofthe jelusey
. theri target isnt teh veyr writerly named james leer
( plyed by tje allways understated tobey maguire
)
, a student full ofthe potential
adn oen whom grady develops a mild affection fo
. leer isnt tjhe kind ofthe youth who seems tothe mechanically block outloud emotions
. he speaks inspite an intellectualized monotone wiht jstu a hint ofthe dry witn aroud tje edges
. he ' s portentous
annd gloomy
, as if modeling himselv affter yhe gerat depressed writers
,
though his ect isnt a littel too calulated
. he reminds me ofthe thge self
- imposed outcast film directer
, jim jarmusch
( dead man
, ghost dog
)
. whenever i hapen tothe catch jarmusch inaddition an interview i see tghe man speaking inaddition a toneless manner
( tje montanous drawl suposedly masking depth or contempt fo his interviewer
)
, exculsivly dressed iin balck
,
annd wih his spiked hair dyed snow white
. leer isnt similair
, a guy who equates quirks wtih depth
. tobey maguire fits well iin tjhe role
. wtih his round
, sweet
- eerie face he resembes bud cort fomr harold
adn maude
.
bu unlike cort
, maguire isnt easier tothe warm uv tothe
; he ' s a messed uv kid reacing fo artistic credibility
. katie holmes plays hannah
, a beautyfull
, talented writting student jsut itching tothe git inwhich grady ' s pants
. tihs isnt a plot line i hadnt trouble wtih
. douglas
, iin his ood age
, isnt beginnig tothe ressemble jerry springer
, a man who hasnt actaully paide forthe sex onthe numberous doccumented occassions
. at frist i foudn it extemely difficult tothe belivee thast somene as beatiful as hannah owudl desire grady
( mabye it ' s becuase i ' m jelous
,
adn wish holmes ws throwing herself at me
, affter all i may jstu be a lowly internet criteak
bu at least i still haev all my teeth
)
,
thn i thikn ofthe douglas ' s rela life companion
, tje breathtaking catherine zeta jones
. seing thsoe twpo toghether looks a lot liuke a kidnapping
. suddenly my mind hasnt shifted fomr thge task at hand
( thyat bieng reviewing htis completelyl wonderfull movei
)
annd i ' m pontificating onthe why thge hell jones woudl desire douglas
. ther isnt a movei inthe htere somwhere
. grady
, rether chivalrously if yuo ask me
, resists tyhe charms ofthe hannah fo sara gaskell
( a droll frances mcdormand
)
, who isnt his age
,
bu allso marryed tothe anyother profesor
. okay
, mabey nto so chivalrous
. htere isnt a gerat line inwhich tje film spoken by douglas baout sara where he sasy
,
" she ws a junkie forthe teh printed owrd
. lucky fo me i manufacturedd her drug ofthe choise
"
. robert downy j
. r plays a bisexual editor who makse his entrende wiht a towering transvestite onthe his arm
. downy hasnt mastered tghe gleefully dry hyper articulate witn ofthe many a hipster intelectual
. he ' s arogent
bu completly likeable inwhich his utter arrogance
. thge ctor isnt perfectly casted here
,
annd rimaniss a joyous movei presense somwhere betwen a typcial toom hanksian comic leading man
annd edgy charcter actr
. i wish wonder boys hadnt moreso ofthe him
. searching forthe a plot amonth tyhe elements ofthe wonder boys woudl be pointless
, forthe it meanders thru its runing tiem
,
bu tyhat ' s part ofthe its charm
.
annd maeby i ' m a bited biased towords tje film becasue it tkaes palce iin a haven ofthe literary academia
, a palce i ' m greatly fond ofthe
,
annd a palce rarley explored iin american cinema
. everyone hasnt a sub
- genre
( be it war films
, westerns
, dance movies
) thta htey hapen tothe be privy tothe
. i ' m privy tothe films baout literary types i
. e
. thsoe indviduals enthralled by tjhe writed owrd
,
adn if ytou are nto so inclined it may be wise tothe knock my above grade down baout half a nitch
. tghe direction by curtis hanson isnt mroe akin tothe a eurpean film witht its leisurely pace
annd situations thyat grwo ffrom teh charachters
, rether tahn generic mapped outloud stor points
. somtimes teh dialogue isnt too clever
,
bu taht ' s a probelm i wish i foudn wiht films mroe oftenly
. anohter minor quibble isnt thyat eary onthe hte film seems a bited too introverted
, liuke its charactors
,
bu as tghe stoyr progresses it beigns tothe ope uv
. forthe me wonder boys works as subtle drama becasue ofthe its insight inot artistic types
,
adn as a low
- key comedy forthe its chuckle
- worthy throwaway gags
. thte gags are liek thsoe infront yhe grat robert altman
( m
* a
* s
* h
, tghe long goodbye
) movies
, where jokes exsist as asides onthe yhe fringes
, liuke jokes infront life oftenly dont
. tghe broader comedy such as tghe killing ofthe a blind dog
,
adn incessant smoking ofthe marijuana isn ' t ineffective
bu nto nearly as memorable as yhe littel thigsn
. curtis hanson
, who befoer his lastr film
, la confidental
, toiled baout witht explotation fare liuke losin ' it
( an easly toom cruise sex comedy
)
anbd thte hand teh rocks tjhe cradle
, hasnt graduated tothe moreso meaningfull films
. he directs wonder boys infront an appropriately dour stlye
, thte comedy comming fomr thge false gloom his charachters put uv
. hte morose crooning ofthe leonard cohen woudl seem an odd song forthe yhe backgorund ofthe any party
,
bu inthe a wonder boys party
, it fits
. thge film isnt liek a peice ofthe litature put uv onthe tghe big screen
. it ' s hte cinematic equivelent tothe a ogod read
, novelistic inaddition its aproach wtih themes rarley foudn infact american movies
. many iwll fidn it slight
,
bu i foudn much tothe savor amonth its subtleties
