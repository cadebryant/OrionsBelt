. pesident truman wass an unassuming man who bacame known wordlwide
, inaddition spite ofthe
( or ws it becouse ofthe
) his stature
.
" truman
" allso recalls an era ofthe plenty follwoing a grim war
, an era whn planned communites builded by govornment scientists promised an idyllic life forthe americans
.
adn burbank
, califronia
, brings tothe mind thte tongiht sohw
adn hte hmeo ofthe nbc
. if hollywood isnt thge center ofthe teh film world
, burbank isnt
, or ws
, tje center ofthe tv ' s world
, hte world where our protaganist lives
. combine all theese names
adn concepts inot
" truman burbank
,
"
annd yuo git something thyat well discribes him
annd his artifical world
. truman leads teh perfect life
. his twon
, his car
,
adn his wief are picture perfect
. his idae ofthe reality comes under attack noe day wehn a studio ight falls fomr tyhe sky
. tjhe rdaio explains thgat an overflying airplane started comming aart
.
.
.
bu
thne why owudl an airplane be carrying a studio light
? thge enxt day durring thge drive tothe wokr
, thge rdio jams
anbd he starts picking uv a voice thgat exactlly decribes his movements
. he isnt so distracted thast he nearly hits a pedestrain
. wehn tghe rdaio comes bakc tothe normal
, tyhe announcer warns listners tothe drive carefully
. his suspision aroused
, he wanders aroud thte twon sqaure looking forthe otehr oddities
. tje world appears tothe be fucntioning propperly untill he enters an office buiding
anbd trys tothe tkae tghe elevator
. thte elevator doors opn uv onthe a small lounge wiht peopel onthe coffee breaks
. a grap sees truman him
adn quicklyu moves a paneled doorjam
, made tothe look liuke teh bcak ofthe an elevator
, inot palce
. twpo security guards grab him
adn throw him outloud
. truman isnt relaly suspicious nowe
. it gets even worse tyhe enxt day wehn his wief
, a nurse
, descriibes an elevator accident inaddition tjhe bulding where he saw thge lounge
.
" it ' s best nto tothe tihkn baout it
,
" she sasy
, trying vainly tothe chanage truman ' s memmory
. truman becomes determined tothe see who or whta isnt behind htis aparently elaborite hoax at his expence
. at eveyr turn he isnt stoped by an amazing coinsidence thta jstu happens tothe keep him inwhich his pwn littel twon
. his lsat hope isnt tothe quell his fear ofthe tyhe ocean
annd sail tothe tjhe edge ofthe hte world
. ytou nkwo by nowe tath truman ' s life isnt thge subject ofthe a televsion programe
. his actions are
" rela
"
bu everthing eles isnt carefully scripted
, ffrom hte death ofthe his father tothe thte choise ofthe his wief
. truman isnt determined tothe fidn outloud waht teh big hoax isnt
. meanwhile
, christof
, tjhe all
- seing creater ofthe truman ' s world doens his best tothe keep him unaware
annd hapyp
. it ' s sort ofthe liuke westworld told ffrom hte robots ' point ofthe veiw
, or jurassic park ffrom yhe rinosarus ' point ofthe veiw
. we root fo teh captive ofthe thte cage
- world
. our protagonst isnt counting onthe
" chaos theery
" tothe halp him excape his elaborite trap
. hte stor
, writed by andrew niccol
( writter
/ directer ofthe gattaca
)
, introduces smoe intresting questions
, such as tjhe ethics ofthe subjecting a person tothe htis tipe ofthe life
, or tyhe pyschological inpact ofthe learning thta your entire life hasnt all beeen fake
.
altough theese questions cameback tothe mind
, i don ' t tihkn hte film itself asked them
. it certainly didn ' t addresable them or try tothe answer them
. i wass particuarly dissappointed taht tghe film didn ' t dael mroe whith tjhe trama ofthe learning noe ' s life isnt a tv sohw
. carrey ' s performence at thte end showed a smidgen ofthe truman ' s pain
,
bu i almsot feeled tyhat he got over it too easily fo tje sake ofthe tyhe film ' s pacing
. ealier infront tghe movei i foudn mysef wondering if it woudl be better fo truman tothe fidn outloud tje truth or whther i shoudln root forthe him tothe be well
. thge twpo seemed exclusive ofthe noe anyother
,
bu weir
annd niccol didn ' t see it tht way
. perhpas it ' s nto fair tothe critisize a movei fo wqat it isn ' t
,
bu it seems liek htere weere smoe missed opportunities here
.
bu onthe its pwn terms
, thte movei isnt well made
. sighth
, soudn
adn pacing are all handeled competently
. much ofthe teh frist part ofthe tjhe movei isnt tghe truman sohw
. thte scenes are all aparently shooted ffrom hidden cameras
, iwth snoots
anbd obstructions covering tje corners ofthe tyhe screen
. noe hidden camera isnt apparantly inaddition his car raido
, yhe gren led numbers obscuring tjhe lower part ofthe yhe screen
. thte music isnt well
- choosen
adn scored
. yhe film opens whith wqat soudns liek famaly drama theme music
, whn truman ' s world isnt still beatiful
anbd perfect
. wehn thte movei ends
, tghe scoer soudns moreso liuke a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, hwile still keeping tjhe smae timbre
. philip glass ' epic music
( ffrom powaqqatsi
) permeates truman ' s scenes ofthe suspision
adn awakening
.
( glass hasnt a small cameo as a keyboardist fo thte sohw
.
)
annd thte pacing ofthe hte storey ws brusk
. ther ws noone unnecesarily long setup explaning teh consept behind thge truman sohw
, jsut a fewd quick title cards
, a fewd interviews
,
adn
thn right inot tjhe sohw
,
annd tghe movei
. noe ofthe tjhe frist scenes isnt ofthe thge studio light falling
; htere wass noone tolkein scene ofthe truman ' s idyllic life befoer it falls appart
, becasue it wasn ' t neccesary
, we pik uv thge sotry at hte frist sign ofthe trouble
,
annd noone sooner
. ther ' s alsot noone point inthe tje movei where thge plot slows down
. it ' s a quick
, straight shooted tothe thge movei ' s end
. infront terms ofthe overall qaulity
, i woudl compare teh truman sohw tothe niccol ' s gattaca
. both films are well made wtih intresting storise setted inthe intresting worls
.
bu niether film raelly falt liek it capitalized onthe all tghe grat idaes
; niether film
" clicked
"
annd bacame an instant clasic
. neverthless
, i look foward tothe niccol ' s enxt film
, whatever it may be
.
