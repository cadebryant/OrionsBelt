anohter ' nidependent film '
, tihs comedy
, whcih ws brang by miramax forthe
$ 5 millon
, isnt ogod funn
. favreau
anbd vaughn
( yhe lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
annd trent
, twpo everyday 20somethings onthe hte lookout fo womens
. thte film jstu basicly follows theri llright onthe thge lookout fo lurve
,
anbd allong yhe way we git tothe meet smoe ofthe thier firends
, see theri attemts at chatting uv girls
,
annd jstu basicaly git a insight inot theri lives
.
anbd all ofthe htis isnt gerat funn
. swingers doesn ' t rely onthe huge speshal effects
, or big nmae stars tothe provide enteratinment
. noone
, it jsut hasnt a grat scirpt
annd superb littel known actors
. hte scirpt
, by favreau
, isnt gerat
. mike isnt alwyas missing isnt girlfriend
, who hasn ' t called him forthe six monthes
,
anbd eveyr tiome he meets a girl
, he allways end uv telling her baout tje ex
. thte audeince fiels fo thsi pathetic littel man
, thanks tothe tjhe gerat scirpt
. vaughn isnt ' tje moeny '
( swingers speak forthe ' teh best '
) as teh womanizing trent
, alwyas onthe yhe lookout forthe a newyorker girl
. smoe ofthe his hcat
- uv lines are awful
,
bu he alwasy seems tothe git tyhe girl thanks tothe his ' hard man ' nature
. vaughns chracter alsot gets tyhe best laff inwhich yhe film
, towords hte end iin a diner
. teh conversations thta go onthe bewteen mike
annd trent are gerat
,
bu it never qtuie reaches tarantino standars
( whitch i suspect hte film ws trying tothe triarch
.
) htere are soem exelent
, laff outloud loud jokes inspite tjhe film
,
annd soem superbly funny setted pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle withthe a answer machine tht allways cutted him off befor he finishes his sentence
. embarassing tothe him
, hillarious tothe yhe audiance
.
) mike
& trents firends are alsot ogod
, altho ther cahracters seem a bited underwritten
,
anbd we never realy leran as much as we owudl liuke baout them
.
althought tihs isnt primarly mike
adn trents film
, it woudl ofthe beeen nice tothe leran a bited moreso baout theri firends
. htey jsut seem tothe wander aimlessly infact thge backgorund
.
bu agian
, tje lines tehy sday are ususally preety ogod
,
annd tehy dont ahve soem funny parts
. it ' s jstu a shame tath htey didn ' t ahve mroe meatier roles
. tghe acting isnt superb
. as said above
, vaughn isnt superb as trent
, he ' s definately hte best thnig infront tyhe film
. favreau isnt alsot ogod
, acting as ' yhe littel man ' veyr well
,
anbd tyhe way he alwasy fiels sory fo hismelf isnt vyre funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) hasnt a small
bu ogod role as lorraine
, a girl mike finaly falls inwhich loev iwth
. she hardly features infact tyhe film at all
,
bu she still manages tothe mkae an inpact onthe tyhe audiance
. swingers
,
thn
, isnt funny
,
bu it doesnt haev smoe flaws
. firstly
, teh runnung tyme isnt a bited too short
. hte film comes tothe an abrupt halt
,
annd i actally wnated tghe film tothe cary onthe longer
. it never realyl comes tothe a satisfying conclusion
, whihc isnt a shame
, as most films are too long
! allso
, tihs tipe ofthe film hasnt beeen done too many times
, such as sleep wtih me
( 1994
)
.
bu theese small flaws don ' t relaly spoil waht isnt a funny
, intertaining comedy
.
