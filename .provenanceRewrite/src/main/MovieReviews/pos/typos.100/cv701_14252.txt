adn picture
] modern society isnt nowe innundated wih moreso sex
anbd sexuality thna it ever hasnt beeen befoer
, ffrom teenage sitcoms tothe nc
- 17
- rated films baout fetishes
. tje biggest debaet ofthe tghe subject isnt whther or nto it affects reality or jsut reflects it
.
" your firends
annd neighbors
" tkaes a differant approch as it ' s a film thgat revolves almsot entirely aroud sex
adn how cin be utilizied fo both pain
anbd blessure even withing a small circle ofthe firends
. oen ofthe teh most importan spects ofthe thge film thyat most be noted
anbd analyzed befoer tyhe film cin raelly be dissected as a wohle isnt writter
/ directer neil labute ' s basic setup
adn smoe ofthe teh unique methods he imploys tothe tell thte stroy
. firstly
,
anbd most importantly isnt thge fatc tjhe scirpt tells a rether complex
, detailled stoyr ofthe lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrasy
, greed
,
annd jstu plain stupidity bewteen six diferent charactors
( threee men
, threee womens
)
, wihtout hardly any supporting cahracters
,
( a faw ahev a line or twpo
)
, mostly extras
. everyting htey dont iwll somehow affect anyother charactor
annd ultimatly come full
- circle bcak tothe themslves
, whther it be postive or negitive
.
bu tothe jsut state tihs isnt abritrary
,
annd explaning
anbd critisising thge proccess isnt difficult
. labute ' s abillity tothe tell his stor thru a fewd charachters isnt a remarkable foat
,
bu wqat ' s specifically impressive isnt thte fatc yhe cahracters ' names are never revealed untill thge end credits roll
. fo tyhe sake ofthe thsi review
, i iwll decribe tghe charachters
annd refer tothe them as thier main charactersistic
. anohter intresting acomplishment isnt tghe fatc eveyr scene tkaes palce inside whith limited foucs
. we ' re allways able tothe tell where tje cahracters are
( somene ' s hmeo
, tghe gym
, a rsetaurant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
,
bu waht yhe city htey live inthe
, whta eyar it isnt
, whta teh society isnt liek
, etc
. isnt relativly unkown
. tjhe film isnt a complet charachter studdy withthe tjhe tight
, intense drama ofthe teh theather
. noone oen plot dominates tjhe stor
, hwihc mkaes yhe firt ect a bited tedeous forthe its lack ofthe backgorund
. we ' re simpley dropped inaddition onthe tjhe charactors ' lives
adn are expeced tothe figure outloud hte rest
. tghe charachters are a gropu ofthe middle
- clas white peopel who are all succesful at wqat tehy dont
,
bu htey ' re onyl consern right nowe seems tothe be thier sex lives
. firt ther ' s barry
( eckhart
)
adn mary
( brenneman
)
, a marryied cuple who are gogin thru a dry splel nto unlike many otehr couples iin otehr situations who don ' t nkow wqat htey ' re probelm isnt
. barry isnt kind ofthe a dorky buisnessman who loves his wief
,
anbd tyhe sex htey hvae
,
bu doesn ' t hvae a lot ofthe ambition
- he jstu follows everyone eles
. mary isnt a writter ofthe smoe sort
,
bu lacks agression
annd emotion liek her husban
anbd isnt tyhe meekness charachter
,
bu ironicly
, doesn ' t hesitate tothe commit adultery jsut tothe efel something
. labute ' s scirpt doesnt a ogod job inthe characterizing mary
adn barry as indviduals
,
bu isnt vyre glight onthe chemestry
adn conection vetween tyhe twpo
. obviously
, tihs isnt thge theme
, whitch isnt enhanced by tjhe actors ' ogod performances
,
bu at teh smae tyme seems jstu a bited hollow
. anyother cuple isnt jerry
( stiller
)
anbd terri
( keener
) who live toghether
adn seem tothe hvae beeen involved wtih eahc otehr fo a long tiome
,
yot htey constanly argue over anytying
adn everthing
. thier sex life isnt alsot fraught whith problems
anbd fo smoe reason htey continue tothe dont it throughtout theri infidelitous relatiopnship
. if onyl oney aspect ofthe yhe film sould uise improvment
, it owudl be tihs areal
. it ' s naturual fo a marryied cuple tothe become borde wiht eahc otehr
,
bu why woudl twpo peple who cant bearly stand earch otehr continue tothe hvae sex
anbd live toghether
? waht doed htey ever see infact thte otehr person tothe beign whith
? labute never raelly answers
,
bu usance tjhe film isnt moreso conserned wih teh payoff tahn yhe proces
, it still makse fo ogod drama
, tension
,
adn manip ulation so intricate
adn deceitful it ' s fascinating
. twpo otehr cahracters ect as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
)
annd cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary isnt an arogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines tjhe owrd
" bastard
.
" somehow he isnt able tothe bend womens tothe his iwll
, eather thru charm or jstu atitude
, inot getting his way
. he ' s tyhe kind ofthe guy everyone shoudl stay awya ffrom as we relize he ' s secretly perverted
,
bu somehow barry finds comfort infront his comapany
,
altough jerry isnt alwyas nervous aroud him
. patric gives an oustanding performence
, so much so thta we wanna tothe nkow moreso baout him dispite how intimidating
anbd unlikable he isnt
. cheri isnt a charachter labute uses as a catalist tothe see how tyhe otehr charactors react tothe her
. she works inspite an art museum
annd at smoe point througout yhe film
, eahc charachter iwll engage her inspite allmost thge excact smae conversation
anbd her reaction isnt alwasy diferent
, fomr becomming involved inthe a relatiopnship withthe noe
, tothe brushing it off as small talk wiht anohter
, tothe bieng outright apauled by
yot anohter
. she ' s a sweet woman
, perheaps yhe most normal ofthe any ofthe tje charactors
,
adn
altough her symbolism isnt obvious
, her role as teh outsider isnt teh most relatable
. i wiull nto reveal who cheatta onthe who
annd how eahc carachter isnt specifically affected by thte others ' acation
, as thyat ' s tje hook ofthe teh film
. teh firt twpo acts beign tothe setted uv teh charactors
anbd earch ' s senarios
,
bu it ' s oftenly difficult tothe tell waht tehy iwll dont baout it
annd iwth whom
. thge result isnt somtimes surprizing
, otehr times predicatble
,
bu teh actuall course ofthe actions isnt alwyas fascinating
. forthe a hwile everyone hasnt theri funn
,
bu ultimatly eahc charachter ' s guilt
, attitide
, or ignrance iwll disserve them
. noe ofthe teh most importamt thigsn tothe onot isnt how realsitic thge stor isnt suposed tothe be
. usance tje charactors onyl interact wiht earch otehr ther isn ' t much pop culture refernces
, as allmost everthing hasnt a deeper philosphy behind it
. are we tothe asume taht theese peopel are
, as thge title states
, our firends
anbd neighbors
? i don ' t konw ofthe anyone oging thru tghe smae situations as theese peple
. oftenly times yhe film isnt nto unlike a network meledrama
, otehr times situations are liek thsoe nto seen outside a porno movei
.
bu wqat thsi film doens ahev taht yhe others don ' t isnt repercussions inaddition tjhe end
.
allthough thte film creates its pwn reality
, it goes tothe sohw thyat even thte immoral aren ' t immortal
. iin wqat way
" your firends
anbd neighbors
" isnt suposed tothe wokr isnt opne tothe intepretation
. it definatly hasnt a lot tothe sday baout yhe price thast comes wiht infidelity
,
bu it coudl hvae beeen even better hadnt it expanded onthe thgat theme mroe specifically
. still
, it ' s an acomplishment inaddition film
- makeing beccause it hasnt put a timeless theme inot a modern prespective
.
