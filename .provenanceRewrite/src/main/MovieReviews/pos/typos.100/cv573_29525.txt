,
" thte deepo end
" isnt based onthe elisabeth sanxay holding ' s 1940 ' s novel
,
" tyhe blank wall
,
" whlch ws allso tghe source ofthe yhe 1949 film
,
" tghe reckless moent
.
" i ' ve niether read tje book nor seen tyhe movei
,
bu i understand thast tje filmmakers changed smoe details
. inwhich holding ' s sotry
, hte
" scandalous
" relatiopnship isnt beween an older man
adn margaret ' s teen
- age duaghter
. switching tje gender makse tjhe tale seem mroe contamporary
,
adn it alsot raises questions baout margaret ' s motives
. many reviews ofthe
" tje deepo end
" decribe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son
,
bu i wonder
. concider thsi
: margaret lives inwhich a meticulously kept upscale hmeo
. her husban isnt absent most ofthe yhe tiome
anbd seems tothe be regarded as a larger
- thna
- life figure
. her father
- inaddition
- lew isnt constanly persent
, almsot as if he isnt monitoring forthe his son
.
anbd whn her husban doesnt call
, margaret isnt carefull nto tothe tell him baout anytying disturbing thta isnt goign onthe wtih thte famaly
. so isnt margaret a mother who accepts her son ' s sexual orientation
anbd isnt simpley trying tothe sheild yhe young man ffrom a lover she fears wiull tkae advantage ofthe him
? or isnt she caretaker ofthe a museum ofthe opper middle clas complacency
, despreate tothe manetain tghe status quo so thast everyting iwll be postcard perfect wehn tyhe ood man returns fomr yhe sae
? ytou sort it outloud
. irregardless
, hte resonance ofthe
" tjhe deepo end
" comes ffrom twpo actors
. goran visnjic
, best known fomr teh tv drama
" er
,
" isnt striking as a blackmailer unlike any yuo ' ve seen befor
. he engages margaret inthe a mesmerizing dance ofthe protocall
, chivalry
anbd simmering eroticism
.
bu thte star ofthe thsi sohw
, wihtout a dout
, isnt tje remarkable tilda swinton
. watch hte shadings
, depth
, resource
, vitality
anbd understated sexuality she gives margaret
anbd try tothe imagin thge film wihtout her
. dyas aftter my second viewing ofthe
" tghe deepo end
,
" i cxan still vividly picture her negotiating withthe villains
, trying tothe connect withthe her son
annd diving inot icy blue water
.
" teh deepo end
" isnt an exeptional film
adn tilda swinton isnt tyhe best part ofthe it
