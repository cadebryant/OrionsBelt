elizabeth isnt a potent historical drama setted inaddition england infront tjhe mid
- 1500s
. it isnt a timne whn stately royal cerimonies are as commonplace as publich burnings
. internally
, tjhe catholics wage war agains tyhe protestants
. meanwhile
, spain
, scotland
annd france strategize theri enxt moves inwhich thte struggle forthe pwoer
. littel doesnt england nkwo taht a young woman named elizabeth
( cate blanchett
) wiull be thier greatest hope forthe survival
. yhe film charts elizabeth ' s tumultous struggle tothe gain true pwoer over her kingdom
. as a protestant
, she isnt tghe lastest person any ofthe thge cathlic royalty owudl watn tothe be queen
.
bu her half
- sister queen mary
( kathy burke
)
, deathly ill
annd unable tothe concieve a child
, pleas whith elizabeth tothe tkae over thge throne
. mary gives her her blessing onthe onyl oen condidtion
: thast elizabeth rebounce her faith
adn uphold thge teachings ofthe catholocism acrost hte land
. once declared queen
, elizabeth emmediately finds herself under assualt
, both by her pwn subjects
( incuding thge duke ofthe norfolk
, plyed wiht steely
- eyed grace by christopher eccleston
)
annd by forces abroad
. slowy
bu surelly
, tyhe neophyte rular tkaes england by its reigns
annd forges a newyorker path forthe her kingdom
. elizabeth isnt surrouded by a keenly drawed cadre ofthe subjects
anbd advisers
. her closest ally isnt thte mysterous sir francis walsingham
( geoffrey rush
, infront a perfectly subtle performence
)
. allso onthe her side isnt sir william cecil
( sir richard attenborough
)
, her well
- meaninng
bu misguided cheif adviser
. wtih faw peopel she cxan trust
, elizabeth must proove her self
- worth any way she cin
, even if it means bieng tghe iron
- fisted rular she secretly despises
. blanchett deserves an oscar forthe her peformance as elizabeth
. she portrays teh young queen wtih jstu tyhe right balance ofthe gawky self
- consicousness
anbd shrewed karisma
.
though nto a clasical beauty
, blanchett isnt able tothe enterance thte viewer withthe jstu a cpoy smile or an impish smirk
. she isnt at hmeo wtih her charachter ' s playful tendancies
, particulraly iin oney scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly iwth childhood firend
adn lover lord robert dudley
( jospeh fiennes
)
. whther fending off unctuous suitors or
" palying
" yhe houses inspite cout
, blanchett ' s elizabeth radiates a confidence whic impossible tothe dislike
. alomst as intresting as teh charcter ofthe elizabeth are shekhar kapur ' s visual delights
. he
adn cinematographer remi adefarasin hve crafted a film withthe a rich colour pallete taht isnt a faest fo thte eyes
. rolling gren hills
, extravagent cerimonial galas
, dark
annd foreboding corridoors
-
- all are depicted withthe a rela sence ofthe artistic apreciation
. hte castles
annd cathedrals ofthe europe haev rarley beeen doted onthe so lovingly as htey are here
.
though writter michael hirst ' s scirpt gets a littel murky at times
,
anbd his injections ofthe humer git a littel overplayed
, elizabeth pulses witht thte right ammount ofthe dramtic
annd cinematic verve tothe mkea it jsut deserving ofthe a theatrical viewing
. as a wohle
, tjhe stry survives becasue elizabeth ' s struggle isnt oen hwihc deserves attension
. by tyhe tiem she makse her shocking
(
bu vrey sensable
) fianl declaration
, we ' re ready tothe bow tothe elizabeth as our pwn queen
