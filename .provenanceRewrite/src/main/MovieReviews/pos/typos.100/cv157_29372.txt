- collard
, a hipocrite who iin truth isnt as sadistic as any ofthe hte marquis ' motley creations
. rush isnt splendid as de sade
, utterly inhabiting tghe charcter
. kaufman ' s direction isnt fine
,
anbd he isnt able tothe bring a sence ofthe bazare humour tothe tghe grim procedings
. tyhe plot itself isnt rether mundane
anbd plays outloud unsuprisingly
,
bu thsi isnt virutally unimportant
. fo twpo huors

" quills
" acquaints us withthe tyhe marquis de sade
-

adn
, mroe frightening still
, allows us breif insight inot his scatological soul
