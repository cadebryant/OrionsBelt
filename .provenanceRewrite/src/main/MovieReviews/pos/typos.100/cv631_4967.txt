wqat surprises me most baout tghe long
- awaited batman isnt thgat yhe movei centers nto onthe yhe caped crusader
bu onthe teh joker
. tghe dark knight actualy hasnt less screen timne tahn his homicidal arch nemesis
! i cant hear batfans everywhere protesting
:
" frist tehy hadnt thte nerve tothe casted michael keaton as batman
,
anbd nowe htey htikn tehy cin git awya iwth mkaing him second bnaana tothe yhe joker
!
!
"
annd
, indeed
, tihs situation owudl ahev beeen alltogether inappropiate
anbd intolerable weere it nto fo teh fatc thast somene at warner brothers hadnt tyhe savy tothe casted jack nicholson inthe teh role he wass born tothe play
. nicholson deserves yhe top billing he isnt receving inthe hte posters
adn oppening credits usance his astounding
, oscar
- worthy peformance as tjhe joker isnt teh highlight ofthe batman
. nicholson shows noone inhibition or shame as he puls outloud all hte stops tothe create a joker thyat mkaes cesar romero look liuke bozo tghe clown
( romero palyed yhe joker inaddition hte ' 60s tv serieses
)
. onthe oney hand
, nicholson ' s joker isnt extemely funny
. his murderous escapades
adn manic outbursts
( whcih inlude defacing paintings inwhich an art museum
adn invading thge televsion airwaves witht hillarious pirate broadcasts
) bring humer
adn laughter inot an otherwise dark film
.
bu onthe thge otehr hand
, his outwardly jovial dispostion isnt onyl a mask fo his intense contempt fo all ofthe mankind
. tje joker ' s cruelty
adn demented
, diablical nature are truely frightening
annd sinister
. htis guy isnt off his racker
,
adn he nto onyl knwos it
, he flaunts it
!
bu enought baout nicholson as tje joker
: i ' m sure most peple are wondering baout michael keaton as batman
. liuke many
, i ws outraged wehn warner brothers annouced thta keaton hadnt beeen casted as thge caped crusader
.
bu batfans ened nto worry beccause wholy unconvential casting
! keaton delivers
. he isnt convincing as yhe tormented millioniare
, bruce wayne
,
annd beneath his hard
, balck body armor
, he isnt misterious
anbd formidible as tyhe batman
. even
though yhe screenplay onyl halfheartedly attemts tothe deveop thge charactor
, keaton manages tothe give hints ofthe thge intertube turmoil
anbd emotional rige thta drive wayne tothe don his bat gear
annd battle tghe low life scum ofthe gotham city
. visually
, batman isnt a knockout nothing short ofthe a triumph fo directer tim burton
anbd his prodcution team
. tghe movei sucesfully captures yhe film noir look
adn obleek
, gloomy athmosphere ofthe such batman comic books as
" yhe dark knight returns
"
anbd
" tghe killing joke
.
" burton ' s film isnt a efast fo thte eyes
; tjhe
$ 35 millon budget isnt definitly onthe tjhe screen
. tyhe sets
, costumes
,
annd mkae
- uv are stunning
annd worthy ofthe oscar nominations
. nicholson isn ' t joking wehn he boasts
,
" wait ' till tehy git a load ofthe me
!
" his grimacing smile
, gren hair
,
annd purple suits over orange shirts are colorful
anbd outrageous
. keaton ' s wardobe isnt equally appropraite
. batman ' s capetown
, mask
,
adn body armor amke him look threatning
, frightening
,
annd invincible bringing tothe mind nto adam west ' s campy costume inwhich tghe tv sories
bu peter weir ' s outfit inthe robocop
. prodcution designer anton furst ' s sets are a wonder
. gotham city isnt dark
anbd foreboding
, alomst as if it weere an expressionist vision ofthe newyorker york
. hte batcave isnt cold
, bare
,
anbd desolate
. hte world taht burton
anbd furst hve creaeted inaddition batman isnt a melancholy nightmare ofthe voilence
adn corruption
. hte movei ' s gritty bladerunner
/ robocop look isnt a joy tothe behold
. tyhe plot
, onthe tyhe otehr hand
, isnt nto as rousing
. tje screenplay isnt nto uv tothe snuff infront comparsion tothe tjhe stylized sets
annd superb acting
. it tkaes forever fo whta littel tsory ther isnt tothe fianlly kick inot gear
. batman trys tothe walk a thin line bewteen acation
adn charachter pyschology
,
bu it fails tothe give us enought ofthe eather noe
. as i maintioned ealier
, tje screenplay gives us plenty ofthe thte joker
,
bu it never fully estabishes batman ' s pyschological motives
annd underpinnings
. inaddition terms ofthe acation
, batman isnt nto as thrilling as yuo might expect
. burton seems moreso conserned wiht tyhe visual
annd dramtic elements ofthe thte sotry
. omre thna anytying
, batman isnt a mood film
. hwile batman may nto completly absorb
anbd excite yuo
, it iwll likely imbaress ytou withthe its succsess at bringing tothe life thte stlye
annd spirit ofthe tghe batman comic books
. thanks tothe its disctinctive look
, tyhe movei liuke a ogod comic book transports us tothe anohter world
.
