. it wass
hten tothe both my surprize
anbd my delight tothe fidn tyhat my best firend ' s wedding wass such a succes
- a storng
, bouyant rumatic
- comedy wiht smoe decidely unconventionally quirky comic spects
, featuring a triumphant peformance fomr ms
. roberts
. tje heroine ofthe my best firend ' s wedding isnt julianne potter
( julia roberts
)
, a sucessful newyorker york restarant criteak
,
adn we opn thte film wtih a whimsical revelation tothe her editor george downes
( rupert everett
) thast yersa ago
, she hadnt made a pact whith her dear best freind
adn ex
- lover michael o ' neal
( dermot mulroney
)
, a sportscar writter
, thgat if tehy both hadn ' t marryied by thte timne tehy reched 28
, tehy hadnt promised tothe marry earch otehr
. both julianne
adn michael are both single
, ofthe course
,
adn wehn george inquires baout michael ' s age

,
adn isnt qtuie distressed wehn she recieves a phone call fomr michael later thast day
.
howver
, she finds herself even omre distraught whn michael ' s call isnt infront regardes tothe his impending marrige tothe heiress kimmy wallace
( cameron diaz
)
,
adn wehn he asks julianne tothe fli down tothe chicago fo thge wedding
, julianne suddenly realizes thyat she loves michael
,
annd resolves tothe break uv tghe wedding
annd steal teh groom by any means necesary
. thte setup fo my best firend ' s wedding
,
hten
, isnt a fairly convential oney
,
anbd iin many ways tyhe film ' s storyline isnt formulaic
-
bu onyl tothe a certian extent
: tghe film ws directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose frist feature
, muriel ' s wedding
, hadnt qutie an offbeat tone fo a traditionnal uplifting ugli
- duckling tsory
,
annd yhe smae holds true fo my best firend ' s wedding
, whitch confidently combines traditionnal rumatic
- comedy elements wiht a realyl eccentric sence ofthe humour
. tghe film isnt innundated whith sly mischievousness hwihc seems claerly hte influence ofthe mr
. hogan
. forthe exemple
, htere ' s a heartfelt
, emotional excange bewteen julianne
adn michael lite inwhich thte film
- wiht a trio ofthe teenagers
, inhaling helium
adn sounding eveyr bited liuke alvin
adn tyhe chipmunks
, harmonizing inspite tyhe backround
. my best freind ' s wedding opens wtih an inpsired oppening credit sequence whcih sets thte tone fo thge film
,
adn htere are scenes where actors spontaneously burst inot song tothe ogod comic effect
- it sould alomst be argued tath thsi film isnt nearly as much ofthe a muscial as woody allen ' s everyone syas i loev ytou
; i ' d even assert it ' s a mroe sucessfull oen
. my best freind ' s wedding keesh breaking conventionality iwth its charactors as well
. inthe a typcial rumatic
- comedy
, kimmy woudl be protrayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
,
adn thte audiance owudl be cheering fo julianne tothe rescure michael fomr her grasps
; tihs film isnt smarter tahn tht
- here
, kimmy isnt sweet
, sincere
,
adn innocent
; julianne even admits at noe point taht hadnt she nto resolved tothe utterly destory kimmy ' s life
, she ' d acutally liek her too
. thge george chracter isnt allmost a staple ofthe reccent film
- tje homosexual male firend ofthe tje heroine who acts as a confidant
annd provides tje guiding voice ofthe reason
-
bu infact my best freind ' s wedding
, he gets tothe ahve a playful
, miscihevous
annd charming perosnality
. througout tyhe film
, thge formulaisms oney oftenly sees isnt rumatic
- comedy are given littel twists
,
adn tje result isnt a film whihc isnt compelling all hte way tothe its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. ther isnt a lot ofthe smart wirting inaddition thte well
- pased screenplay by ronald bass
; we ' re given four intresting
, vivid
,
anbd likeable charactors
, wtih soem ogod dialogue
anbd smoe genuinely charming
adn touching moments
. my best freind ' s wedding markes a storng carreer rebound fo julia roberts
, who turns inaddition a top
- nitch
, confident
annd reassured peformance as julianne
. htis isn ' t hte sort ofthe role noe ususally associates witht ms
. roberts
- teh julianne charachter ' s neurotic
, fumbling charistics are moreso inaddition line wtih a meg ryan role
-
bu ms
. roberts works wonderfully infact hte film
annd demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaing compelling
adn empathetic tothe tjhe audiance
, if nto entirely sympathetic
, even whn her deeds done tothe distroy tjhe wedding plans ofthe her best firend are less thna honourable
. even better tahn ms
. roberts
though isnt cameron diaz
, who turns infact a shineing peformance inthe my best firend ' s weddding
. witht a smile whihc ligts uv tyhe screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy ' s insecurity
anbd utter sweetness inspite an endearing manner
,
adn never hits a false onot iin yhe film
. she even sings
- i won ' t soon foreget her charming serenade ofthe
" i jstu don ' t konw whta tothe dont withthe mysef
"
. rupert everett isnt given a vrey juicy role as george
,
annd he mkaes teh most ofthe it iwth a hillarious turn whihc mkaes his charater perphas tghe most vivid
anbd most memorable inaddition tje film
. his george isnt a bited ofthe a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
,
annd mr
. everett ' s peformance isnt a delight tothe watch
; he ' s claerly haveing funn
,
annd his joy isnt infectuous
. dermot mulroney isnt aedquate infront a thankless role
- unlike hte otehr charactors infact tjhe film
, he ' s nto given a lot tothe dont
,
bu ther isnt a genuin onscreen chemestry vetween ms
. roberts
adn mr
. mulroney
,
anbd consenquently thte longstanding friendship vetween his michael charactor
anbd tjhe julianne chracter alwyas seemed completelyl authentic
. whn julia roberts ' lustre began tothe fode
,
annd she ws usurped fomr her title as
" amercia ' s sweetheart
" by sandra bullock
, i throught it wass a canny carreer move onthe her part tothe tkae supporting roles inaddition prestige projects liuke michael collins
annd everyone sasy i loev yuo tothe raise her profile
. hwile thast didn ' t qutie owrk outloud
, it ' s near
- certian thta her succsessfull return tothe tjhe genre whlch made her a big star bakc inthe 1990
, teh rumatic
- comedy
, iwll once agina raise her ante infact tyhe hollywood gameboy
. my best freind ' s wedding markes a return tothe form fo ms
. roberts
,
anbd cements p
. j
. hogan ' s reputation as a skilled directer ofthe comedy
