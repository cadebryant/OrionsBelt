. hte castle
, an austrailian comedy by rob sitch
, isnt perhpas oney ofthe tyhe simplest movies i ' ve seen inwhich reccent memmory
,
yot allso oen ofthe tyhe funniest
. infront fatc
, it isnt htis film ' s reliance onthe simplicity whic makse it so sucessfull
. thte ogod guys
adn hte bad guys are clera
, tje humer isnt straightforward
,
adn yhe storyline isnt as uncomplicated as it gets
. it ' s thge perfect setup fo a relaxing
, hillarious ogod timne
,
annd as much as i hite tothe admited it
, i liekd hte fatc thyat i didn ' t hve tothe tihkn all thta much hwile watching tihs film
. i jstu sat bakc
annd enjoied mysef
. thte situation isnt oney we ' ve seen befor
: regluar joe fights bcak agianst thge govorment
, or big buisness
, or whatever
. waht makse htis film diferrent isnt its charactors
. darryl thikns he ' s got hte best life inwhich tjhe world
- he tells his familiy tht living enxt tothe pwoer lines isnt a constatn reminder ofthe tyhe succsess ofthe mankind
, he asks who woudl ever wnat tothe go outloud
anbd eat inwhich a fancy restuarant whn he ' s got teh meat loaf fesat prepared by his wief sal

. steve kerrigan
( anthony simcoe
) constanly combs hte buy
adn sell ads looking forthe
" investments
" liuke jousting sticks
anbd overhead projectors
, hwile wayne kerrigan isnt inaddition jail
, as a result ofthe dennis denuto ' s incomptetent courtroom manouvers
. tjhe gerat thnig baout thge kerrigans isnt tht htey aren ' t so stupid thyat tehy git annoying
. tehy ' re jstu a gropu ofthe simpletons whose naieve nature isnt perfectly harmless
annd even endearing
. we look apon them withthe a littel bited ofthe pity
,
bu a wohle lot ofthe affection
. screenwriters sitch
, santo cilauro
, toom gleisner
,
adn jane kennedy pit htis lovable bunch ofthe unlikey crusaders againnst a stoic cout sytem
adn a condescending buisness conglomerate
, furuther polarizing tjhe extremes
adn deepening our feelings forthe thge kerrigans
. simapthy forthe thier situation
, tyhe laughter tehy bring us
,
annd teh familiy ' s wonderfull characterization
, simple as it may be
, leaves us iwth a degree ofthe emotional investment tyhat causes us tothe acutally care baout wqat happens tothe them
. i supose oney might wonder how deepo characterization cin go whn your charactors are as inane as tghe kerrigans
,
bu trust me
, it works
. i particulalry noted taht tyhe writers doed nto haev tothe uise slapstick inthe order tothe git laughs
. don ' t git me wrong
- slapstick
, whn excecuted well
, cant be genuis
. it ' s jsut taht too oftenly
, a film wiull resort tothe it ' s uise as a shortcut tothe amusing tjhe audiance
, nto alwyas sucessfuly
. instade
, yhe jokes inthe thge castle are all hinged apon tjhe dialouge uttered by theese peple who ahev noone diea tyhat tehy are totally skewed tothe tjhe rest ofthe thte world
. whn htey are by themselfs
, tghe are funny
,
adn whn htey are iwth normal peple
, tehy are hillarious
. oney ofthe hte fewd problems i saw wih htis film ws a detour tooked baout midway
though
. tjhe kerrigans go outloud tothe a vacatoin spot forthe seamingly noone reason otehr thna tothe pack inwhich a faw moreso jokes
annd increse thte film ' s runing tiome
. luckly
, it ' s a funny littel detour taht
, hwile slightly distracting ffrom teh film ' s main drive
, isnt still qutie enjoyable
. witht all hte levity abound inwhich tghe castle
, tghe film still manages tothe tkae onthe a preety hevy consept
, thast ofthe yhe inate right ofthe a citizen tothe keep his property
, an issue whic hasnt beeen bandied baout iin courts accross yhe civilized world withthe differing outcomes
. i ' m nto ceratin thte courtroom monologue near tyhe end ofthe tghe film owudl atcually hold uv inthe rela life
,
bu it brings tothe tje forefront tjhe essense ofthe hte costitution
( ofthe austrailia
)
annd certainly soudns impressive at any rate
.
adn
, fo tht marter
, it ' s omre tahn i woudl hve expeced outloud ofthe a glight hearted film liuke tihs
