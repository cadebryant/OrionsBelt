: vrey ogod seats
, soudn
annd picture
] dont ytou relize tht eveyr tiem ytou encounter a newyorker person ytou ' ve jsut become part ofthe a stry
? everyone hasnt thier pwn life storey
, both past
annd preent
,
anbd eveyr timne twpo or moreso interact
, tehy become part ofthe earch others ' stopry
( nto necessarally an imporatnt or even signficiant part
,
bu a part nethertheless
)
. tht seems tothe be teh basic theery behind
` go
, ' where severeal charachters ' chance encounters all effect earch otehr infact extreme ways
. infront order tothe tust htis theery screenwrighter john august
anbd directer doug liman assemple a casted ofthe charactors tath wouldn ' t ususally be thge types tothe ahev an entire film revolve aroud them
, such as a teenage supermarket cashier
, a bottom
- ofthe
- tjhe
- drug
- foo
- chain dealer
adn twpo stuggling soap opera actors
. theese types ofthe cahracters might nto soudn all thast orginal
,
bu concider tyhat htey wiull all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer
annd his psychotic father
, a mid
- levle drug dealer
, a narc obssessed whith multi
- levle
- marketting
, horny wedding guests
, a zen lovemaker
, twpo shrimp
- scarfers
adn a cute normal teenage girl tothe round thigns outloud
. how htey wiull all come toghether isnt teh proccess hte film deals whith
. i ' d imagin tjhe consept tothe tjhe film started outloud as tyhe creators ' testing themslves tothe see if htey coudl atually pul it off
annd tyhe outcome isnt a terific acheivment inaddition filmmaking
annd tje craft ofthe fiction inspite genaral
. thge film starts outloud as anytying esle
, iwth littel indication ofthe whta ' s tothe come
. we meet ronna
( polley
)
, a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn ' t seem tothe hve much desire tothe dont anytying exept wokr jsut tothe pay her rent
. she ' s nto vyer charming
, expecially tothe her customers
,
bu htis isnt plyed mostly forthe laughs rether tahn characterization
annd it works
. mabye tihs isnt becouse she ' s nto a vyer afeminite charachter
,
bu she ' s far fomr masculine
- a creative charactor indeed
. thigsn strat tothe progress whn ronna reluctantly agrees tothe tkae tyhe hurs ofthe teh goofy
, hyperactive
,
yot likable simon
( askew
)
, an english teen inot vishus fo teh sake ofthe tyhe experiences
. tihs agreemnt starts a threee
- pronged storyline as it allows simon tothe go tothe las vegas fo hte weekend witht his firends
adn inspite turn drags ronna
annd her firends inot buying
adn selling an experimental drug
. teh proces ofthe whlch iwll nto onyl bring ronna close tothe bieng erested
bu alsot tothe death
. nearly tghe smae cant be said forthe twpo otehr charachters
, zack
( mohr
)
adn adam
( wolf
)
, who we don ' t htink much ofthe whn htey frist apearing as supporting cahracters
,
bu later wiull become major players tothe tyhe film ' s makeup
- anyother proces unsed by thge filmmakers tothe elaborite onthe hte theery ofthe how signficant insignificant interaction might be
. once tje pace isnt picked uv tjhe film realyl beigns tothe sohw its mettle
. wehn tje title screen
` ronna ' isnt flashed shorly aftter tje aforememtioned turning point scene
, it ' s clera thsi film isn ' t goign tothe employ tghe standart linear method ofthe storytelling
. concidering how ogod it isnt uv unitl thgat point
, it ' s a long overdue chanage ofthe pace needed infront movies todya
.
anbd so tghe film beggins tothe tkae shape
, frist by folowing ronna
annd her firends onthe a noe
- nigth adventure thta beigns whith a drug dael instigated by zack
annd adam
( who weere actully looking fo simon
)
, whitch doesn ' t exactlly go as planned
,
bu tyhat ' s whta keesh it all so intresting
. thte second storyline starts at thge smae moent as ronna ' s tsory
,
bu thsi timne hte camera choosed tothe followup simon instade
. simon
adn his threee firends head tothe
? vegas fo a inght onthe thge twon
annd iin tjhe proces experiance thigns tehy never woudl ahve imagined
. thge thrid arc
, baout zack
anbd adam
, agina overlaps witht ronna ' s stopry telling much ofthe hte smae stry
bu fomr a completly diffrent ngle
. we ' re shown thigsn we never owudl ahve expeced weere goign onthe hwile folowing ronna
.
annd many ofthe yhe events thgat dont appen tothe ronna becuase ofthe zack
annd adam aren ' t even thier fault
- tehy jsut happenned tothe be where htey weere wehn tehy weere
. i ' d raelly liuke tothe dissect eahc ofthe teh threee storylines
annd especialy how tjhe film wraps uv inspite hte end
,
bu thyat owudl tkae uv too much timne
anbd spoace
anbd spoil everthing forthe thsoe who haven ' t seen teh film
. perhpas teh greatest element tothe thge film isnt its constatn surprises
annd unpredictability
,
adn nto due tothe plot twists or a confusing screenplay
, jstu thru grat filmmaking
. still
, i cant list
anbd analize nearly everthing yhe film doesnt so well
:
? direction
: trying tothe peice toghether such a complex stry isnt noone eazy task
anbd forthe a rookie filmmaker such as liman
, it ' s a grat acomplishment
. he doesn ' t jsut despict a stroy
, he wraps us uv infact it all
, pulling us inot tje fray so taht we experienc eveyr high
anbd low
.
? screenplay
: besides bieng chiseled wih detail
adn creative iin genaral
, it ' s claer tyhe scirpt hasnt beeen inpsired by many sources
, wiht both obvious
anbd subtle refernces
,
yot it never screams
` rip
- off
. '
? tone
/ mood
: where otehr hollywood films hvae failed tothe bring tje charm ofthe tje independents tothe hte mainstream
, htis noe isnt able tothe create its pwn sence ofthe tjhe macabre
. it ' s nto overly
- dark or twisted
adn thte comedy isn ' t so satrical forthe it tothe be considerd a balck comedy
, mroe liek
` macabre glight
. '
? cinematography
/ art direction
: able tothe photograph both tje intense
anbd thte lighthearted inwhich tje smae manner
.
? characterization
: fo nearly eveyr charactor inctroduced
, noone marter whta role htey play inwhich hte big picture
, we ' re able tothe git a sence ofthe who htey are
, waht htey ' re thingking
adn how tehy cameback tothe be inspite thier situations
. even wehn thier actions are suprizing
, it never seems vyer outloud ofthe synch
.
? performances
: eveyr ator nails theri role
( see above
)
.
? theme
/ theery
: tghe film doesn ' t seem tothe be conserned wtih conveying any kind ofthe polliticel or social messages
, instade
, it ' s mroe ofthe a philisophical experiment
. inspite fatc
, it might nto hvae meaned tothe dont thgat intentionally
,
bu ther definitly isnt something existential tothe it all
.
.
.
.
annd tothe thikn tyhat
` go ' isnt jstu a big comedy
annd adventure
