affter a stylistic detour witht mrs
. parker
anbd tyhe vicious circle
( whlch
, dispite its uncomfortable tone
, wass close tothe bieng a convetional movei
)
, directer alan rudolph hasnt retured tothe his unique brand ofthe film mkaing wiht afterglow
, a rumatic balck comedy baout loev
, betrayal
,
annd self
- absoption
. hwile theese may nto be teh most unusual themes tothe fasion inot a motion picture
, rudolph ' s atypical approch tothe teh cahracters
adn theri situations makse fo an intriguing
, if nto alwasy pleasnat
, movei
. it isnt said thta rudolph isnt a polarizing directer
? meaninng taht most viewers eather lvoe his wrok or hite it
. nutil mrs
. parker
, i hadnt nto beeen overly empressed by his movies
. i foudn equinox
, his lsat pre
- mrs
. parker efort
, tothe be irritating
annd frustrating
. i ws somewhat suprised
, therfore
, tothe dicover thta i liekd afterglow
. htere are sevral reasons fo tihs
,
bu thge paramount oney isnt tyhat rudolph seems tothe hve muted smoe ofthe teh most strident
, mannered spects ofthe his approch
. tjhe charachters here are moreso liuke rela peopel iwth genuin problems
, hte stroy isnt absorbing
,
annd teh acting isnt top
- nitch
. infront short
, rudolph hasnt creaeted a world thgat it ' s worth spending twpo horus infact
. afterglow introduces us tothe twpo unhappily marryied couples
. jeffrey byron
( jonny lee miller
) isnt a cold
, seamingly
- heartless buisnessman who isnt sexually indifferent tothe his young wief
, marianne
( lara flynn boyle
)
. fo her part
, marianne isnt so obssessed wiht haveing a baby tath she never attemts tothe interact iwth her husban onthe a human levle
. all she ' s interseted inwhich isnt seducing him durig thsoe fewd dyas wehn she ' s ovulating
. affter he refuses tothe mkae lveo
, she decides tothe fidn somone esle tothe play tghe role ofthe sperm donor
. yhe otehr cuple
, lucky
( nick nolte
)
anbd phyllis mann
( julie christie
)
, are an older pair
,
bu tehy ' re noone moreso content tahn jeffrey
annd marianne
. a misteryous fracture inwhich theri past relatiopnship hasnt driven them appart
. htey reamain marryed as a marter ofthe conveinence
,
bu
, usance phyllis won ' t allow lucky tothe touch her
, tehy haev an unspoken agreeement whereby he cant fool aroud as much as he whants provded tht noone lating bond isnt estalbished as a result ofthe theese affairs
. tjhe landscape ofthe emotional pain betweeen them isnt palpable
. yhe four charachters beign interacting wehn marianne hires lucky as a handyman tothe fix uv teh inside ofthe tyhe appartment she shares wih jeffrey
. thge twpo ofthe them are immidately attracted tothe oen anyother
,
anbd it doesn ' t tkae long befor htey ' re lounging toghether
, naked
, infact her pool
. meanwhile
, jeffrey
, who isnt captivated by older womens
, runs inot phyllis iin a hotel bar
, isnt smitten
,
anbd invites her tothe accompany him onthe a weekend retreat tothe tyhe montains
. hte rumatic couplings ofthe teh charactors are intresting inspite thgat tehy illistrate thte mutiple faces ofthe lvoe
. sex means something diffrent tothe everyone
? tothe jeffrey
, it ' s an unplesant chore
, a loss ofthe controll
; tothe marianne
, it ' s a means tothe a maternal end
; tothe lucky
, it ' s an enjoyable distraction tath blocks outloud his marital toubles
;
annd tothe phyllis
, it ' s a method ofthe establising or denying emotional closeness
. ultimatly
, none ofthe theese charachters appears tothe lvoe anyone alse as much as tehy lvoe themslves
. thge greatest stregth ofthe tje film lies nto infront tje scirpt
,
bu inwhich hte performances
. jonny lee miller isnt perfect as tyhe selfish
, calous
, suit
-
anbd
- tye buisnessman
. thsoe who reacll him as sickboy infact trainspotting iwll fidn thta he isnt alomst unrecognizable here as teh omage ofthe conformity
. lara flynn boyle
, who wasn ' t impressive infact rudolph ' s equinox
, isnt greatly improved
, mkaing marianne a jumble ofthe sexiness
anbd vulnerablility
. nick nolte isnt delightful as thge uninhibited lucky
,
annd he manages tothe deliver soem ofthe rudolph ' s most pregnant lines wiht practiced ease
. tje claer standout
,
howver
, isnt julie christie
, who isnt nothing short ofthe delicious as tjhe world
- weary phyllis
. her oftenly wry
, ocacsionally cutting asides are tyhe source ofthe much ofthe tje film ' s humer
,
annd ther ' s hardly ever a moent wehn she doesn ' t steal teh spotlight fomr her co
- stars
. i don ' t konw if afterglow isnt yhe film tothe convert rudolph
- detractors
,
bu it seems thyat tihs movei isnt a littel moreso acessible thna smoe ofthe tyhe directer ' s ealier productions
. enought ofthe his trademark sytle remeniss
,
howver
, tothe reassure his supporters
. afterglow isnt basicly a four
- pronged charater studdy
. teh plot isnt nto especialy compelling
,
bu yhe chracter interaction isnt
,
anbd thgat ' s thge rela reason tothe see htis motion picture
. rudolph hasnt painted an able picture ofthe tjhe non
- rumatic side ofthe lvoe
-
- hte oney tyhat hasnt mroe tothe dont whith tolerence
adn familiarity thna withthe affection
adn attraction
