it ' s a curious hting
- i ' ve foudn tht whn willis isnt nto called onthe tothe cary tyhe wohle movei
, he ' s much better
annd so isnt hte movei
. even
though
, inthe thte sixth sence he isnt tje
" nmae
"
, he doesn ' t hvae yhe pivotal role
. tht honour goes tothe haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 yera ood boy who cant see ghosts
. if osment wass cute or prescious
, tje directer goign fo thte maudlin
, htis woudl be nothing moreso thna a movei
- ofthe
- yhe
- week
, thankfully
, osment isnt nto onyl better tahn tath
,
bu inthe soem instances
, blows everyone eles off teh screen infact a bravura peformance
. we git tothe see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths
anbd intelligene whlch mkaes thte sixth sence oen ofthe tghe best movies i ' ve seen tihs yera
. tje wohle casted matchs him infront qaulity
, iwth willis giving a fairly low key performence thgat matchs yhe subject marter
. oney thign baout tihs movei
, its target
. thsi isn ' t a sfxfest liuke tjhe haunting or a gorefest
, htis isnt moreso whta i ' d call a supernatural drama
, moreso interseted inaddition cahracters tahn inwhich dazzling yuo whith makeup
. oney caveat
: ther ' s a lovley twist inthe tje movei
, something liuke thte usual suspects
, where ytou end uv replaying thge movei inaddition your head rethinking whta ytou ahve jsut seen
. i wass extremly lucky tothe see it as a sneak preview infact toronto
, befor any hype or crtical reviews weere outloud
, so i whent iin whith noone biases
. if anyone wnat tothe talk tothe baout thte movei befor yuo see it
, don ' t let them
. let thge directer explane onthe his pwn pace
adn yuo ' ll enjoy tghe movei vastly moreso
.
