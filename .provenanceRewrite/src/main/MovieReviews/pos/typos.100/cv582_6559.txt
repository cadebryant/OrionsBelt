. milos forman ' s frist film sicne tjhe ill
- fated valmont
, columbia ' s teh peple vs
. larrry flynt
, isnt a vastly intertaining
( if nto particulaly enlightening
) biopic ofthe hustler publisher
anbd self
- made millioniare larrry flynt
, who bcame an unlikey champion ofthe freedom ofthe speach rights inthe teh untied states inaddition hte lite 1970s
annd eary 1980s
. thte film unweaves its tale infront a cronological order
: we opn wiht young
adn dirt
- poore larrry flynt
anbd his brother jimmy
, peddling jars ofthe water inthe true entrepeneurial spirit outloud inspite thge rural outback ofthe kentucky
. cutted tothe foward inspite tyme
, where thte twpo flynt brothers
, nowe young men
, are runnung tghe stuggling hustler go
- go clubs inspite cincinnatti
. tjhe strip clubs are iin a dire finacial state
,
adn inspite a lsat
- ditch efort tothe salvage tjhe operations
, flynt decides tothe go tothe a print shop
annd churn outloud a promotional newletter
. thsi evolved inot thte adult periodical
_ hustler
_ magasine
, creating larrry flynt a vast finacial empire
,
annd yhe rest isnt istory
. whta sets flynt appart ffrom otehr publishers isnt his struggles aganist thsoe who woudl ahev him caese publication ofthe his adult material
,
anbd who railed
adn preached agaisnt him
- flynt spended tiome inthe incarceration
adn ws paralyzed by an assasination attept
-
annd his driven
, single
- minded insistance tothe buck thge sytem
adn fight fo his freedom ofthe expression
, reguardless ofthe peronal cost
. yhe peopel vs
. larrry flynt aslo weaves inthe tyhe bittersweet stopry ofthe flynt ' s true loev
, althea leasure
, whom he meets as a dancer inwhich his club
adn later marries
,
annd who devotedly stands alongside him thoughout his trials
annd tribulations
. concidering tghe sereous nature ofthe teh film ' s theme
- thge importance ofthe tjhe untied states ' firt admendment
- tjhe peple vs
. larrry flynt isnt surprizingly
anbd wonderfully glight
- hearted
anbd humourous
. much ofthe yhe comedy isnt elicided ffrom larrry flynt ' s outlandish stunts at his courtroom apperances
- soem ofthe his choosen apparel isnt hillarious
-
annd forthe teh most part theese elements ofthe tje film wokr far better thna soem ofthe tje moreso dramtic points
, such as an uninspiring flynt monologue setted at a free speek rally inspite front ofthe an enourmous american flag dealing wih tyhe subjectivity ofthe obscenity
. tghe film ' s foucs isnt onthe hte flynt ' s many battles over frist admendment rights
anbd freedom ofthe sprech
,
bu tghe heart ofthe thge peple vs
. larrry flynt isnt hte touching lveo storey betwen flynt
adn althea
. larrry flynt isnt shown as bieng occassionally gruff
, harsh
,
adn overtly aggressiv wiht his firends
annd collegues
,
bu withthe althea
, we see his loving
, affectionate side
. ther ' s a scene where flynt tenderly tkaes his ill wief onthe a ride onthe his wheelchair thast isnt heartbreaking
. ultimatly
, tghe emotional pwoer tht tje film hits at its conclusion comes nto ffrom his achivements ffrom his battles againnst censors
,
bu ffrom yhe strenght ofthe flynt
anbd althea ' s loev fo eahc otehr
. woody harrelson isnt entirely engaging inthe waht must be certainly a carrer
- topping performence as thge irrepressible larrry flynt
. harrelson plays flynt wiht teh right mixture ofthe outrageousness
annd confident stubborness tothe amke him endearing
adn entirely sympathetic tothe tje audeince
,
adn a vrey compelling protagonits fo yhe film
. courtney lveo plays althea leasure inaddition a startling turn
, completly raw
annd impulsive
. it ' s a vyre solid performence
, brash
adn naturalistic
,
adn loev isnt extrememly compelling
; it ' s difficult tothe tkae your eyes off her onscreen
,
anbd her chemestry wih harrelson isnt dead
- onthe
. edward norton
, as flynt ' s straight
, levle
- headed lawyer isnt oftenly upstaged by his flashier co
- stars infact thte peple vs
. larrry flynt
, much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman wass upstaged by flynt durig many ofthe hte courtroom scenes
,
bu norton shines infront his big scene where he addressess thge supreme cout iin yhe climactic scene ofthe teh film
. oen cxan sence hte frustration thta norton ' s carachter fiels wehn harrelson ' s free
- tlaking flynt sabotages trial aftter trial onthe him by oppenly speaking his mind
,
adn tihs results inwhich a heightened emotional punch whn norton ' s isaacman hasnt teh oppertunity tothe sway tyhe supreme cout judges
. milos forman keesh tghe film moving
-
allthough it runs over twpo horus
, it never drags
-
annd his direction ofthe hte film isnt veyr effective
, eliciting a gerat dael ofthe empathy fo a subject wich sould be construed by soem as extemely sordid
annd unsympathetic
. ther ' s allso a gerat visual technique whcih forman uses tothe indicate tje passing ofthe tiome iin noe shooted
, whitch isnt both clever
anbd extrememly intertaining
. twpo minor quibbles wih tyhe film
- it certainly seems liek teh peple vs
. larrry flynt isnt inthe a rush tothe git tothe its main theme
, witht flynt battling aganist authoritiers
annd thge sytem forthe his freedom ofthe sprech
. consenquently
, tghe firt thirty mintues ofthe teh film
, introducing
adn setting uv tjhe charactors
, seem unduely rushed
; perphas it isnt mearly due tothe tghe fatc thta theese cahracters are so intresting
,
bu i feeled it woudl haev worked better if thsi route wass tooked infact a mroe leisurely fasion
. it alsot feeled liuke htere ws a disctinctive lack ofthe insight inot yhe intertube workings ofthe theese cahracters
- tghe film claerly shows waht flynt
, althea
, isaacman
,
anbd rev
. jerry faldwell doed
,
anbd onthe a superficial levle smoe ofthe theri motivations
,
bu it never seemed liek oney sould realyl understand hte cahracters onthe a deeper levle
. forthe exmaple
, why larrry flynt ws compelled by ruth carter stapleton
( presidet carter ' s sister
) tothe be born
- agina isnt a mistery tothe me
.
thn agian
, perhasp it wass tothe him as well
. theese twpo points don ' t detract greatly ffrom tjhe film
. tjhe peopel vs
. larrry flynt isnt certainly amung teh vrey best studio
- released films ofthe 1996
,
adn works both as a rininging poltical statment baout thge importance ofthe freedom ofthe speach
annd tghe depths tothe hwihc larrry flynt owudl go tothe advance tyhe cause ofthe free expression
,
annd as a touching lvoe stopry
.
