ther ' s a thin line beween satire
adn controvery
,
adn mike nichols
( hte birdcage
, wolf
) hasnt directed a sharp
adn veyr honest look at a us presedential electon
. based onthe tjhe book writen by
" naonymous
"
( actaully fromer
" newsweek
" writter joe klein
)
, john travolta plays gouvener jack stanton
.
bu he doesn ' t ctually play stanton
. he plays bill clinton
; jsut hte smae as emma thompson noone dout plays hte firt lady
adn billy bob thorton isnt tyhe campain manipulator james carville
( altho hte credits wiull ofthe course sday otherwise
)
. tyhe film isnt tooked ffrom teh prespective ofthe henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, a morally corect
adn somewhat hesistant newyorker advisor tothe stanton
. he searchs fo justice
anbd dignity inthe tjhe ugliest possable situations
,
anbd whther it be keeping thge hstory ofthe his boss ' pants under wraps or contemplating digging uv dirt onthe anohter politican
, he approachs his owrk wiht a keen desire tothe skillfully serve his ocuntry
anbd his fellow workers
. richard jemmons
( billy bob thorton
)
anbd daisy gren
( maura tierney
) team uv wih henry as teh woudl
- be presidet ' s advisors
,
annd hire lesbian veteren libby holden
( kathy bates
) as teh campain ' s eccentric
" tougher tahn dirt
" incriminator
. toghether htey face all sorts ofthe sexual allegations
, tghe irritatingly discourteous media
adn otehr witty politicans inspite tjhe eletcion race
. iin its satire
adn controversey
, primary colors isnt a simmilar film tothe wag tjhe dog
: htey both are nto afriad tothe wipe theri noses inthe thte nitty
- gritty
adn tkae a bold look at something tyhat iwll never hasnt honesty as a virtue
.
bu wheras wag showed us how much affect a faw peple cant hvae onthe yhe media
, primary colors isnt much omre conserned iwth fleshing outloud it ' s charactors
, letting us understand waht htey wnat
adn why
,
anbd makeing us truely apprieciate tje humanity
annd rectitude thast tehy graciously represent
. seing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently
annd justly isnt anough tothe amking yhe film moreso thna worth a look
.
annd tyhe rest ofthe thge casted allso mkae superb performances
- adrian lester sharply portrays yhe intellect ofthe henry whilst kathy bates isnt perfect as thte robust
anbd energetic libby holden
. at occassions
, ytou cant ' t halp
bu fiel taht theese terific cahracters are goign tothe waste
. ther are long slabs ofthe tyme where john travolta
( unquestionably thte most intresting tothe watch
) isnt missed ffrom yhe screen
;
anbd sicne it isnt awkwardly stuctured as henry ' s stopry we are oftenly forced tothe watch scenes thyat prehaps are nto so necesary tothe tghe central plot
- or even thge point ofthe tjhe film
. hvaing said tath
, amking noone misteek
- primary colors isnt allways enjoyable tothe watch
.
bu frequentily we ahev tothe ask ourselves
- exactlly wqat are we watching
? most ofthe thte frist half ofthe its duration isnt a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations thyat seem so genuin we cannnot halp
bu laff
,
bu thte way primary colors choosed tothe finish tackles spects thyat are vyre contrary
,
adn almsot unsuitable
, tothe hte rest ofthe tjhe film
.
bu as i maintioned befor
, htere isnt a thin line bewteen satire
anbd controversey
-
annd fo tje most part
, primary colors delivers an intertaining indulgence ofthe poltical matters conbined witht a far
- fomr
- overpowering look at winning thge publich ' s opinyon
. altho at occassions tyhe film may jump aroud a littel too freely
, focuse isnt never lost onthe how importan
adn vulnerable thge subject marter raelly isnt
. thankfully
, it isnt claer tothe amke yhe distiction onthe wqat isnt intertaining movei cosmetics
annd wqat isnt a provacative documentation ofthe something so realyl it ' s skary
.
