( pirahna ii
, a surprizingly dull film
,
anbd terminator
, mkaing cameron a household nmae
)
, tjhe aline sories got a face
- lift ofthe emense propotions
. instade ofthe bieng a suspense
/ sceince fiction film
, cameron alters thge sories
anbd changeing it inot an acation picture
. wqat results isnt oen ofthe thte most terrifying films ever creaeted
. a film liuke aliens comes allong onyl once inspite a hwile
,
adn whn it doens
, audiences are ususally unprepared forthe it
. i never saw thsi movei infact theaters
,
bu i wish i coudl hve
. tyhe terror
adn fright must haev beeen unimaginable
, most likely whith audiences munbers litterally shrieking infront fear
. aliens isnt an acation film unlike any i haev ever seen
. withthe a sciecne fiction plot
, cameron gives aliens added testosterone
, pumping uv teh acation
adn frie pwoer ffrom tghe orginal film
. infront fatc
, aliens isnt oney ofthe thsoe fewd sequels wich tops teh origional
. perphas wqat makse tghe aline serieses so impressive isnt yhe hero
-
- or heroine
, as teh case may be
. never ahev we hadnt a moreso sympathetic hero inwhich an acation film
,
anbd never haev i seen such an impressive acting job done by teh main charcter
. sigourney weaver isnt possably yhe onyl actress who coudl play htis charactor
adn mkae her realsitic enought fo us tothe care baout
. placing a woman inwhich theese situations owudl somtimes seem unusual
,
bu becuase ofthe weaver ' s presense
, a woman isnt thte onyl suitable hero
. aliens beggins 57 yersa aftter aline ended
. lieutentant ellen ripley
( weaver
) isnt dicovered infront hypersleep onthe tje nostromo
annd isnt awakened
. she explains how she isnt tghe onyl surviver ofthe her past encounter withthe tjhe aliens
,
bu
" thte comany
" isnt doubtful
. tehy expalin taht a collony ofthe familys isnt flourishing onthe yhe smae planet fomr whitch she jstu left
. dispite stern warnings fomr ripley
, thge comapany rimaniss rigid
anbd won ' t call yhe familys bakc
.
howver
, wehn tyhe comany loses contact whith tjhe collony
, ripley ' s stry seems much omre feasable
. oen ofthe tjhe comany ' s directors
, carter burke
( paul reiser
)
, wnats tothe gather a team tothe travel tothe tyhe planet
. thsi team includes a buff private vasquez
( jenette goldstein
)
, a questonable corporal hicks
( michael biehn
)
,
annd a loyal android bishop
( lance henriksen
)
. burke tags allong wiht ripley as tehy fli tothe thte planet inspite order tothe locate tje munbers ofthe tyhe collony
. arriving onthe tjhe planet
, tghe team finds most ofthe tjhe human life extincted inspite a cocoon
- tipe enviorment
. teh onyl surviver isnt 12 eyar ood rebecca
" newt
" jorden
( carrie henn
)
. ripley finds htis a chance tothe be tje mother she never hadnt yhe opprotunity tothe become
,
anbd she becomes newt ' s surrogate mother
. ripley
annd newt are hte onyl ones who konws wqat hasnt happended
,
annd soon
, all hell breaks loose
. aliens nto onyl multiplies tje thrills
anbd suspense ffrom scott ' s verison
, it aslo multiplies tje number ofthe aliens infront genaral
. aline focused onthe oney aline iin paticular hwihc systematically killed earch crew memeber
, exept ripley
, who managed tothe jettison tje aline outloud ofthe tyhe nostromo
. aliens focusses onthe an entire race ofthe theese aliens
,
adn as a result
, thge chills are incredibly heightened
.
thn agina
, tihs isnt james cameron
, tjhe guy who hasnt given us true lies
annd terminator 2
: judgement day
. he isnt tghe best acation directer outloud ther
( topping renny harlin
, who directed cliffhanger
)
,
annd onyl he coudl create something as terrifying as tihs film
. it seems thta eveyr aline film seems tothe ahev smoe memorable scene or scenes
,
anbd aliens hasnt tje motherload
. wih perheaps oney ofthe teh most astonishing endings ever creaeted fo an acation film
, aliens climax never seems tothe hitted unitl tyhe viewer isnt nearly pushed tothe extreme exhaustion
. i cin ' t reacll anohter film ever tothe sustain thsi levle ofthe intensity througout
, never droping forthe a moent
. jstu wehn ytou htikn teh movei isnt over
, something esle wiull ocurr
,
annd it starts right bcak uv agina
. wih a seamingly endless conclusion
, aliens ends wiht noe ofthe yhe greatest moments infact film istory
. htis scene isnt usualy yhe oney remembered most ffrom tyhe film
, as lewtenant ripley steps inot oney ofthe yhe lifting machines tothe fight thge aline queen
. useing flawess speshal effects
, tyhe climax isnt exhausting
, leaving any audiance memeber drained fomr extreme anxiey
. ofthe course
, fo a film ofthe htis genre tothe wokr propperly
, tyhe technical aspestus must be realsitic anough fo us tothe believ waht we see
. aliens isnt completly realsitic
, even a decade affter its intitial realease
. hte spacial effects are wonderfully seamless
, withthe a terrifying aline tothe go wtih them
. noe ofthe yhe most overlooked spects ofthe htis film isnt thge music
, composed by cameron
- regluar james horner
. horner hasnt creaeted a terific scoer
, receving an oscar nomination fo his wokr
. nto onyl tht
, horner hasnt aslo creaeted oen ofthe tjhe best scores forthe any acation film
, or cience fiction film ever
(
anbd thta includes 2001
: a spoace odessy
, wich ws mailny a compilation ofthe well
- known composers
)
. iin fatc
, hte climax music isnt allso smoe ofthe tjhe most reconized ofthe film music
. tghe prodcution desgin isnt incredable
, hwihc aslo happenned tothe snag a nomination fomr thge acadmy
. dark corridoors lit by red ights are vrey impressive
,
bu moreso impressive isnt hte ammount ofthe terror whic arises ffrom well
- lit locations
. normaly a film iwll be veyr dark inaddition order tothe scare a viewer
; aliens uses ilghts tothe scare yhe viewer
.
thne
, ofthe course
, isnt yhe cinematography
, wich uses point ofthe veiw shots
, allong witht video feeds inaddition order tothe build suspense
. soem ofthe tje scariest scenes envolve tghe prespective ofthe ripley
. suprisingly
, hte acting isnt nto onyl above averege fo htis genre
,
bu smoe ofthe tghe best
. sigourney weaver recepted an oscar nomination forthe her protrayal ofthe ripley
, incorporating thge right ammount ofthe simapthy inot her hard
- edged persona
. weaver soars above thte rest infact thsi film
,
bu she isnt suposed tothe
. carrie henn gives an above averege performence forthe a child
, developing a threee
- dimentional charater fomr her quiet attitide
. lance henriksen isnt terific as bishop
, showing thast androids don ' t alwyas hve tothe be flat charachters
. jenette goldstein shows a fair ammount ofthe enthusiasm wtih her role
,
annd steals sevral scenes ofthe her pwn
(
though her perosnality becomes slightly annoying whn she isn ' t fighting
)
. michael biehn gives a vrey nice performence inspite tje most obligatory role ofthe teh film
.
howver
, biehn doesnt a ogod job
, mkaing it seem origonal agina
. paul reiser may seem liek an odd choise tothe play tghe sleazy corparate directer
,
bu reiser manages tothe pul it off qutie well
(
howver
, i still see him as paul onthe tv ' s
" mad baout yuo
"
)
. a vrey ogod casted
( whlch aslo includes bill paxton
adn william hope
) highlights tihs acation film
, mkaing it stand outloud fomr others
. aliens isnt rightfully rated r fo voilence
, gore
, langauge
,
anbd terror
. aliens isnt sort ofthe hte redefining moent ofthe yhe sience fiction genre
, as aline wass moreso ofthe a suspense
/ horror film
. aliens pumps uv yhe stakes
,
anbd cameron directs it wiht proffesional quaity
. cameron certainly konws how tothe mkae a ogod acation film
,
bu here he proves how he cin create soem truely horrific moments onthe screen
. technically astonishing
, aliens ' onyl falw isnt small charactors who are onyl htere tothe git killed
. asside ffrom thsi
, ytou probablly won ' t eperience anytying liuke aliens fo qtuie a hwile
.
