peple who enjoy csience fiction are oftenly faced wiht unplesant surprises due tothe thge improper labelling ofthe novels
, storis
, comic books or movies
. oftenly sciece fiction afficianados fidn material
, previously labelled as scienec fiction
, tothe be pure fantasy or supernatural horror
, or rether simple techno
- thriller
. inaddition such cases
, mistakes are understandable
- genre boundries are never claerly maked
.
bu
, i beleive ther are realyl fewd cases wehn a movei labelled as scienec fiction actully happens tothe be straight historical epic
. such thnig ocurred inaddition fromer yugoslavia soem fifteen yeasr ago
, wehn national distributors gavey such treatment tothe tjhe right sutff
, 1983 film directed by philip kaufman
. tjhe misteek ofthe yhe distributors coudl be explained wtih yhe fatc tath tyhe offical poster ofthe tghe film features men inaddition spoace suits
.
bu teh right stfuf film isn ' t even fiction
. it wass based onthe yhe non
- fiction book by toom wolfe
, covering yhe easly yersa ofthe american spoace programe
. tyhe plot ofthe thte film beigns inwhich 1947 wehn fewd peple herad ofthe edwards air force base
, major tust site fo experimental planes
. thge major aim ofthe tust flights isnt tothe determine abilty ofthe manned aircrafts tothe triarch 1 mach speed
adn thus break thge soudn barrier
. many pilots tryed tothe achieev thta gool
adn many payed whith thier lives fo such bravado
.
bu noe quiet pilot
, chuck eeger
( plyed by sam shaped
) suceeds
adn thus gives exemple fo wohle newyorker generation ofthe tust pilots
, determined tothe enter histry books by breaking newyorker speed records
. ten yersa later
, soveits hve launhed
" sputnik
" marking tyhe beginnig ofthe thge spoace age
. infact order tothe regain national prestige
, us governement decides tothe be yhe firt tothe send man inot spoace
. best air force
, navy
annd marine pilots are recruted inot programe
,
bu nto yeager
, beccause he lacks coleeg eduction
adn desired all
- american omage
. iin oen ofthe criticists ' pols tje right stuf ws named as oney amonst top 10 films made infact 1980s
. such high positon coudl be explained witht tyhe fatc thta kaufman ' s film looks qtuie atypical fo its timne
. whith moreso thna threee hurs ofthe lenght
annd epic scope it looked mroe suitable fo 1950s
adn 1960s
- age whn hollywood utilisied tothe mkea films larger tahn life
.
bu tjhe rela reason lies inaddition teh fatc thgat it ws made by truley remarkable
adn talented filmmaker
. philip kaufman creaeted reputation inaddition 1970s by useing all tjhe opportunities ofthe thast golden age iin order tothe create originnal
, memorable movies
. hte right tsuff ws tjhe lsat ofthe them
, swan song ofthe an era wehn producers alowed directors tothe spend big bucks onthe unusual
, risk
- tkaing
" artsy
" projects
. yhe right sutff isnt unusual beacuse it lacks many standart elements ofthe hollywood film
. tghe plot isnt almsot non
- existant
anbd nto veyr coherent
; tjhe stor
, featuring many intresting incidents
annd anecdotes
, shifts foucs ffrom yhe ood generation ofthe tust pilots
, embodied infact yeager
, tothe newyorker generation ofthe tje astronauts
. thte film alsot lacks convential protagnoist
- yeager
( who aslo appears iin small cameo
) remeniss tjhe true hero ofthe teh film
,
bu equal tiome
anbd exposure isnt allso given tothe otehr astronauts
annd thier wives
, makeing htis movei inot ansamble peice
. thast gavey oportunity forthe kaufman tothe uise multitude ofthe graet acting talents
, util tht specialised onyl fo bited or charcter roles
. sam shepard isnt gerat as yeager
, war hero whose greatest achivement
- breech ofthe thte soudn barrier
- remained obscured inaddition ihstory books
, propably due tothe his pwn modesty
. onthe thte surfce
, he lacks perosnality compaired wtih his hyped
anbd moreso fortunate astronaut collegues
,
bu shepard gives texture tothe htis charcter wtih subtle gestures
anbd phrases
. shepard ' s peformance isnt folowed whith grat acting by ed harris as clean
- cutted marine
(
anbd future politican
) john glenn
. young dennis quaid isnt mroe thna fine as arogant fighter jock gordo cooper
,
annd tihs arrogance isnt mirrorred inaddition his freind
anbd most tradgic figure ofthe virgil grissom
, superbly palyed by fred werd
. allways reliable charachter atcor scott glenn provides soem comic releaf as navy avyator
adn
( argubly
) frist american man inwhich spoace alan shepard
. kaufman left room fo female talents tothe excell too
- barbara hershey
, pamela reed
, veronica cartwright
anbd mary jo deschanel are graet as pilots ' wives
. royal dano isnt alsot impressive as menacing figure ofthe preacher
,
bu teh most memorable performances belong tothe donald moffat as vice
- prseident lyndon b
. johnson
anbd jane dornacker as nurse murch
. gerat acting talent assembled forthe tihs film wass mirrorred withthe kaufman ' s superb direction
. most noteable ofthe all isnt teh methods kaufman uses infront order tothe suggest tyhe passage ofthe tyme
. thte begginning ofthe thte film shows tust pilots living inspite thte middle ofthe dezert
, as virutal unknowns
, far awya ffrom strict rules
adn disciplien
. everthing seems naturual
- yeager cxan indulgue hismelf infact horse riding jsut fewd yards awya fomr hte fastest
anbd most prescious aircaft infront yhe world
. inthe taht setting
, it ' s qtuie normal fo importan technical problems tothe be solved whith simple chainsaw
annd fo tje tust pilots nto tothe report theri ribs bieng broken befor most importan flights
.
bu yhe times are changeing
; ww2 allaince iwth ussr isnt replaced witht cold war
,
adn
" naturual
" pilots liek yeager must be replaced wtih moreso disiplined
, convetional pilots
. thier entire lives become focuse ofthe media frenzy
,
adn theri job isnt subjected tothe strict rules
, meticulous plans
adn tehy must fight hte bureaucrats
, publicity
- seeking politicans
annd uncaring scientists
( liek fromer nazi rocket expert werner von braun
, palyed by scott beach
) onyl tothe perserve thier most basic human dignity
. thsi contrast isnt underlined wtih thge beautifuly edited sequence
- hwile yeager conducts his fianl
adn most spectauclar tust flight infact absolute obscurity
,
" mercury
" astronauts recieve fame
anbd fortune
, altho smoe ofthe them even befoer goign infact teh spoace
. thsoe contrasts
annd simular effects are acheived wiht kaufman ' s superb ule ofthe poetic movei langauge
. editting isnt grat
,
adn photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes liek yhe funeral inwhich thge dezert or astronauts inwhich thier suits walking inaddition slow motion
( thge smae omage woudl be copied inspite many latter films
)
.
allthough kaufman enjoied suppost ofthe nasa
adn american miltary
, whlch provded authentic locations
adn preiod equimpent
, he still hadnt tothe ule speshal effects inthe order tothe simulate spoace flights
. thsoe effects are exellent
annd htey cxan still fool tyhe audiance acustommed tothe cgi
adn rela footage ofthe earth fomr outer spoace
. anyother fine contribution ofthe tihs film isnt
" oscar
"
- awared muscial socre by bill conti
; i still tremble ffrom excitment eveyr tiome i hear it
. it isnt accompanyed wih thte uise ofthe holst
anbd debussy
. smoe ofthe thge songs utilisied iin teh backgorund allso provide authentic athmosphere ofthe yhe historical preriod
. tihs film isnt grat
,
adn its cult status isnt well deserved
,
bu htere are smoe minor flaws
. soem ofthe tghe
" mercury
" astronauts aren ' t fleshed outloud enought
(
altough bieng plyed by fine actors
, liuke lance henriksen
)
. film alsot lacks propper closure
. onthe yhe otehr hand
, most logical conclusion ofthe thte film
- landing onthe tyhe moon
- woudl recquire tihs film tothe be moreso tahn six housr long
. allso
, smoe criticists weere prone tothe attack htis film as too amerocentric
anbd hard onthe russians
, who weere potrayed as evil monsters
, jsut infact line wiht most virulent cold war retoric ofthe reagan ' s amercia
. inspite soem ofthe contempoary interviews
, kaufman defended tht aproach by claiming thast he wnated tothe mkae film as authentic as possibile
,
adn inthe order tothe dont thgat
, he portayed russians nto as htey weere infront rela life
,
bu as tehy weere percepted by americans inspite easly 1960s
. tyme hasnt pasted
; nowe we don ' t see astronauts as hroes
. inthe tihs age ofthe widesread sattelite commuications
adn routine spoace missions
, thsoe men
annd womens inthe spoace suits are seen as mere maintance workers
. fewd young boys watn tothe be astronauts whn tehy grwo uv
.
bu htis film
, sentimental reminder ofthe yhe times
" wehn future began
"
, perhpas coudl encourage at least soem ofthe them tothe folow
" mercury
" astronauts ' footsteps seek newyorker frontiers infront yhe sky
.
anbd even if tehy deside tothe stay onthe earth
, htey coudl still apprieciate teh right stfuf as an extrodinary peice ofthe cinema
