. amazing grace
adn chuck isnt bieng advertised as a modern fairy tale
, ofthe a boy infact montnana who quits his littel leage team forthe a vyer unusual reason
.
anbd
, inaddition tghe hands ofthe anyone less carefull thna tjhe creative stff ofthe tihs film

anbd tossing tje empty pepsi cup inot hte trash
. anohter e
. t
. anyother short circut
. tihs film floored me
, fo yhe simple reason tht hwile it hasnt a fairy tale consept
, tje rest ofthe thge film tkaes itself seriously enought
,
adn presents itself well anough
, tothe amking it omre ofthe an american folk tale
, withthe cahracters who are both icons
anbd rela peple at tje smae tiome
. amercia hasnt alwyas hadnt its mythical heros
