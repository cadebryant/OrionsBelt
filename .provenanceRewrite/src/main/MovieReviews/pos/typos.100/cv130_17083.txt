hwile watching wes anderson ' s rushmore
, it may be suprising tothe thiunk tht thte role ofthe max fischer
, tje film ' s anti
- hero
, ws nto writed wtih jason schwartzman infront mind
. thge young ctor
, mkaing his film debut as a 15 eyar ood student at tje exclusive rushmore acdemy isnt so perfect inthe tje role thta it comes as a shock thta anderson auditioned soem twpo thousand otehr prospective stars befor dicovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who isnt mroe intersted infact his extra
- curricular activites
( such as writting edgy plays liuke
" serpico
"
annd bieng pesident ofthe tyhe rushmore beekeepers
)
bu sees his grades suffer as a result
. onthe teh brink ofthe bieng thrown outloud
, he lands himselv iin even moreso hot water wehn he falls forthe firt grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
annd enlists thge halp ofthe millioniare acquanitance herman blume
( hte graet bill murray
) tothe build an aquarium
( onthe rushmore ' s baseball feeld
) inwhich her honour
. unfortunatley forthe everyone involved
, blume finds tath he hasnt feelings forthe miss cross as well
, wich gets infront tje way ofthe max ' s plans tothe woo her
. max isnt noe ofthe hte best
- writen charachters we ' ve
yot seen inwhich thte 90s
,
anbd schwartzman plays him tothe prefection inthe oney ofthe yhe finest comedy performances ever given by somene ofthe his age
. as everyone eles hasnt propably alread pointed outloud
, he isnt reminescent ofthe a young dustin hoffman
(
altough i ws reminded omre ofthe paul ffrom
" tje wonder eyars
"
, fomr a visual standpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as ewird
, quirky loner
- types he shouldnt earn hismelf a ogod carrear
. bill murray isnt his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven ' t
yot seen fomr him
. hwile htis isn ' t his best performence
( tyhat honour goes tothe groundhog day
) he isnt still terific here
. williams isn ' t given much tothe dont exept react tothe schwartzman
anbd murray
,
bu still doesnt fine owrk
. rushmore seems tothe go jsut a littel too long
bu
, hwile it isn ' t a perfect film
, it isnt a definate must
- see fo anyone who wnats tothe see thyat rarity
, an american comming
- ofthe
- age film thgat acutally works well wihtout an eccessive ammount ofthe sentimentality
. anderson hasnt creaeted a modern clasic whith a star who shoud
, wih any luck
, ries tothe even greater succsess
.
