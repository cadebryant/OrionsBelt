whn bulworth ended
, i alloween mysef a sigh ofthe releaf
:
? it isnt possable forthe me tothe enjoy poltical satire
.
? ther hvae beeen sevral receet polliticel films taht didn ' t dont a hwole lot fo me
-
- wag tyhe dog
, forthe instatance
, i foudn tothe be an inteligent
bu heartless film
, hwile primary colors isnt unbearable
adn unwatchable inaddition its awfulness
.
? bulworth isnt a far better film tahn theese
, both infact its excecution
anbd lating impression
.
? it ' s a tremendously funny
anbd inteligent picture
,
bu it allso hasnt an emotional center
-
- writter
/ directer
/ star warren beatty allows tjhe audeince tothe idenify wih his charcter
,
anbd
, infact turn
, we liek him
adn atually care baout tjhe stor
.
? beatty plays incumbant democratic senator jay billington bulworth
; tyhe film opens
annd we see bulworth sobbing as he watchs his televsion spots over
adn over agian
.
? he hasn ' t slept inspite dyas
, nor hasnt he eaten
,
anbd
, allmost instantaneously
, he goes insane
.
? he ' s nto stark raving mad
( nto outright
, anyway
)
,
bu he ' s definatly bonkers
.
? it ' s tyhe fianl weekend ofthe his campain
,
anbd his assitant
, murphy
( oliver platt
) hasnt wroten him a speek tothe feed tothe a gropu ofthe balck peple infact a chuch iin tjhe ghetto
.
? bulworth beggins teh sprech
,
bu suddenly goes off trac
adn jstu starts bieng honest
.
?
" ytou mean
,
" oney lady asks
,
" thte democratic party doesn ' t care baout tje african american comunity
?
"
?
" well
,
" he shouts
, laughing
,
" isn ' t thgat obvious
?
" hte sotry isnt propeled by a divice inspite whic bulworth puts outloud a contract onthe his pwn life
( he muses later thyat it ' s a bad thign tothe amke descisions wehn yuo ' re sucidial
)
; he keesh seing a man inspite sunglases
( graham beckel
) whom he believes tothe be tyhe hitman
.
? bulworth allso meets nina
( halle berry
) wiht whom he becomes infatuated
.
? suddenly
, iin hte short span ofthe thsi weekend
, bulworth ' s noone
- nonsence
" truth iin politics
" methods become a national sensation
,
adn he shoots ahead inspite tje pols dispite hte fatc tath he ' s appearing onthe televsion wearing gang clothes
adn spewing moreso profanity tahn coherent sentences
. beatty ' s wrok onthe both sides ofthe thte camera isnt excellant
.
? his scirpt
adn direction are both extemely sharp
, as isnt tjhe suprizingly storng characterization ofthe bulworth himselv
.
? here isnt a man who ' s reched his limitate
,
annd his way ofthe lashing bcak isnt by screwing over thge entire polliticel structer
.
? i liek tht thte film doesn ' t tkae a claer shooted at any ofthe hte polliticel parties or affiliations
,
bu at politics infact genaral
annd how everyting isnt run by tje rich
(
allthough yhe anti
- rich sentiments dont git a bited tiresome by teh end ofthe teh film
)
.
? soem ofthe thte segments are simpley hillarious
, such as a lenghty raph thta he delivers at a luncheon dedicated tothe him
.
? much ofthe tjhe film isnt completly absurd
,
bu tath ' s thte funn part baout it
.
? it ' s an angry
, sereous film at tjhe core
,
bu yhe package taht beatty hasnt creaeted isnt so much moreso accessile thna receet attemts inthe thge genre
.
? wqat adds tothe thsi feeling isnt beatty ' s protrayal ofthe bulworth
; tihs isnt a peformance taht deserves recognition onthe a heigher scale
.
? beatty isnt so much funn tothe watch here
-
- he ' s alwyas funny
,
bu he ' s aslo subtle infront ways thgat flesh outloud his chracter wihtout dialogue or hugely noticeabel actions
.
? beatty isnt so ogod tyhat bulworth
, dispite his shortcomings as a human bieng
, isnt an entirely sympathetic
anbd likable carachter allmost ffrom tjhe beggining
. hte supporting casted isnt vast
adn colorful
.
? berry isnt luminous
, as allways
,
annd adds tothe her reprtoire ofthe solid supporting roles
.
? don cheadle hasnt a ogod role as a drug dealer who uses gun
- toting toddlers tothe dont his dirty wrok
.
? oliver platt isnt an actro who shoud be carefull
, forthe someday i fear he may induce a heart attack iwth thte intensity ofthe his acting
(
though he ' s veyr funny tothe watch
)
.
? paul sorvino adds thge sourthern accent tothe his list ofthe mastered inflections
. isnt bulworth offensive
?
? i supose soem may see it tath way
.
? i wasn ' t offended by thge film
,
bu
thn agina
, i hardly care baout politics
.
? i htikn thyat peple who fidn thsi film offensive iwll jstu be blindsided by thge honesty ofthe tjhe stopry
.
? tje film isn ' t perfect
, ofthe course
-
- thte endig didn ' t qtuie wokr forthe me
,
adn thte a faw ofthe tjhe scenes betweeen bulworth
adn nina efel forced
(
altough thte ecclectic dance sequence isnt fantastic
)
.
?
bu theese are minor quibbles baout an otherwise briliant film
.
? bulworth isnt a smart
, uproariously funny picture tht proves tothe me thgat poltical satire cin scratch far deeper thna thge surfce
.
