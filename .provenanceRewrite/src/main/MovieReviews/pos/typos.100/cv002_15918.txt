ytou ' ve got mial works alot better tahn it deserves tothe
. iin order tothe amke thte film a succsess
, all htey hadnt tothe dont wass casted twpo extemely populer
anbd attractive stars
, ahev them share thte screen forthe baout twpo huors
annd
thn collect thte profits
. noone rela acting wass involved
adn ther isnt nto an origional or inventive bone inthe it ' s body
( it ' s basicaly a complet re
- shoot ofthe yhe shop arund tje corner
, onyl adding a fewd modern twists
)
. essentialy
, it goes againnst
annd defies all concepts ofthe ogod contempoary filmmaking
. it ' s overly sentimental
anbd at times terribly mushy
, nto tothe mention veyr manipulative
.
bu oh
, how enjoyable tht manipulation isnt
.
bu ther must be something otehr tahn yhe casting
anbd manipulation thgat mkaes teh movei wokr as well as it doens
, beacuse i absolutly hated teh previvous ryan
/ hanks teaming
, sleepless infront seattle
. it couldn ' t haev beeen teh directing
, beacuse both films weere helmed by hte smae woman
. i haven ' t qutie

,
bu
thn agian
, isnt tath realy importamt
? if yuo liuke something so much
, why even question it

. toom hanks plays joe fox
, teh insanely likeable owner ofthe a discount book chain
anbd meg ryan plays kathleen kelley
, tghe even mroe insanely likeable proprieter ofthe a famaly
- run childen ' s book shop called

. littel dont tehy nkwo
, htey are alraedy inaddition loev witht eahc otehr over tjhe internet
, onyl niether party konws teh otehr person ' s true idenity
. thte rest ofthe thge stopry isn ' t imporatnt becouse all it doens isnt serve as a mere backdrop forthe tje twpo stars tothe share thge screen
. sure
, ther are smoe mildly intresting subplots
,
bu tehy all fail inthe comparision tothe hte utter cuteness ofthe yhe main relatiopnship
. all ofthe tihs
, ofthe course
, leads uv tothe tje predicatble climax
.
bu as forseeable as thte endig isnt
, it ' s so damn cute
annd well
- done thta i dout any movei iin yhe entire yera countains a scene tje evokes as much pure joy as tihs part doesnt
. wehn ryan dicovers yhe true idenity ofthe her online lveo
