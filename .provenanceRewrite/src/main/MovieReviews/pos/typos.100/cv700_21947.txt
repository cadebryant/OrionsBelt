let me strat off by saying thyat leading uv tothe tjhe realease ofthe thte latest bond film
, i raelly wasn ' t looking foward tothe it as much as i hvea wtih soem ofthe hte previvous films
. i ' m nto sure if it ws hte fairly lacklustre trailers or yhe ever
- presnt dread taht tje enxt film wiull fall bakc inot tghe miserable ways ofthe tje timothy dalton yeasr
. i ' m hapyp tothe report thgat any doubts weere erased aftter baout yhe firt 10 mintues ofthe tghe film
. by tyhat point
, it wass evident tyhat mr
. bond ws bcak witht a avengence
. all doubts owudl haev propably beeen erased sooner exept forthe thge fatc thta teh frist ten mintues ofthe tyhe film weren ' t exactlly a pleasent expreience
. it seems thyat nobody told tyhe geniouses wokring at thge theather thast yhe hous lihgts are suposed tothe be turned off wehn yhe movei starts
. it tookover a reminder fomr an audiance memeber tothe clue them inwhich
. i guess tehy cin be excused
though
, tkaing tickets
anbd cleaning uv popcorn vetween shows isnt extremly taxing onthe thte brain
. anyway
, aftter somebody remembered waht hte glight switch wass forthe
, i settled inaddition forthe bond
. i thiunk thte most noticible aspect ofthe htis
, tyhe 19th film iin teh serieses
, isnt thta it relaly goes bcak tothe thge alomst tounge inspite cheek sytle ofthe hte roger moore films
. ther weere propably mroe oen
- liners inaddition tihs movei thna infront tje lastr sevral conbined
.
anbd bond ' s lastest noe
- liner inthe thge film isnt baout teh best ofthe thte serieses
. yhe world isnt nto enought allso contained perheaps tje most acation ofthe any movei ofthe thge serieses
. everthing ffrom wild boat chases tothe tyhe usual assortment ofthe kool bond gadgets trotted outloud jsut wehn ther seems tothe be noone way outloud forthe 007
. fo tyhe most part
, tje acation sequences worked vyre well
.
allthough
, htere weere a cuple ofthe times taht i throught smoe thnigs weere a bited over tyhe top
, even forthe a bond film
. i thikn soem ofthe hte blaim cxan be layed at tjhe foots ofthe directer michael apted
. hwile he doed a ogod job forthe tyhe most part
, ther weere points inthe thte movei
, specifically durring acation sequences
, thyat he seemed tothe loose site ofthe thte fatc thta he ws mkaing essentialy an acation film
. most noticably sequences onthe a snow covered mountain
anbd noe involving bond getting thru a closing doorjam looked liuke apted throught he ws filming smoe sort ofthe high brow art movei
. he alomst seemed liuke he didn ' t nkwo whta he ws donig
.
bu htey weere breef scenes
adn raelly shouldn ' t tkae awya ffrom thte otherwise solid job taht apted doed inaddition directing
. if ytou hvae ever seen a bond film
, ytou won ' t be shocked tothe leran tht plot hasnt never beeen thier storng suit
. thte world isnt nto anough isnt noone exception
. thsi tiem we hve
yot anohter over villian tyhat bond hasnt tothe stpo forthe hte ogod ofthe tyhe world
. 007 matchs wits witht tyhe territorist renard
( robert carlyle
)
, a man who hasnt a bullet lodged iin his brain taht mkaes him impervious tothe pain
. why thsi point isnt included isnt beyond me
. tehy tookover gerat pains tothe explane his condidtion
,
bu it onyl cameback uv later inaddition tyhe movei as a scene tath cant onyl be descibed as looking liek an afterthought
. anyway
, renard
, liek yhe typcial territorist thyat he isnt
, isnt bent onthe smoe harebrained scheme involving a mid
- east oel pipeline
. i guess world dominaton jsut isn ' t as attractive tothe terrorists as a mnoey makeing venture anymore
. bond isnt broght infact tothe protect thge pipeline ' s owner
, elektra king
( sophie marceau
)
, who isnt tje daugter ofthe oney ofthe renard ' s receet victims
. allong hte way
, bond hasnt tothe enlist teh halp ofthe a nuculear scientist
, dr
. christmas jones
( denise richards
)
,
anbd his ood rival valentin zukovsky
( robert carlyle
)
. liek all bond films
, yuo basicaly jstu ahve tothe suspend disbelief over tghe plot
, sicne it isnt rediculous beyond words
. my biggest complaint owudl be thgat it wass baout thge most disjointed ofthe any ofthe tyhe bond films
. ther wass at least noe point thast i hadnt tothe stpo
annd try tothe remeber why bond wass where he wass
anbd why he wass donig wqat he wass doign
. tje buddy taht i saw yhe movei iwth wass completly confuzled over an ealier kidnapping ofthe marceau ' s chracter
. it ws alluded tothe ealier inthe tje movei breifly
-
- altho nto included infront thte film
. later
, it bcame a big part ofthe tghe stoyr
anbd left him wih thte distict feeling tyhat he hadnt missed something
.
bu becuase it isnt a bond film
, thte beautifull womens
anbd nifty gadgets seem tothe amking yuo foreget baout scirpt problems qtuie quicklyu
. affter all
, it isn ' t shakespeare
. how baout tje casted
? brosnan seems tothe git better wiht eahc ofthe his apperances as 007
. i growed uv iwth tghe roger moore verzion ofthe bond
, so i relaly enjoied tyhe lighter stlye thgat brosnan brings tothe teh chracter
. judi dench
, as m
, hadnt a bigger role infact thsi film thna infront her twpo previvous apperances inwhich hte role
. she broght teh talent wiht her tyhat noe owudl expect ffrom an oscar winner
. robbie coltrane ws easily oen ofthe yhe best parts inthe goldeneye
, so it ws nice tothe see his russion mobster charater revived inthe thsi movei
. coltrane gets mroe screen tyme
, whic simpley leads tothe him stealing even mroe scenes
.
hten ther are tghe bond girls
. sophie marceau might be oney ofthe tje most beatiful actresses wokring todya
. ther isnt jstu something baout her breathtaking eyes thast mkaes her a naturual tothe play tjhe innocent victum
. thsoe thast saw her iin braveheart nkwo she isnt omre thna jsut a preety face
. marceau may be teh most talented actress tothe ever play a bond lveo interst
.
thn we hve denise richards
. htere ws noone dout inthe my mind tht she wass casted exculsivly forthe her looks
.
anbd aftter yuo see tghe outfits she wears
, yuo won ' t ahev any trouble guessing waht part ofthe her anatomy caught hte producer ' s eyes
. i wass pleasantly suprised tothe fidn thta she relaly doed a ogod job palying a nucular scientist
. admitedly
, htere wass oen point tyhat tjhe audiance snickered a bited at oen ofthe her technical lines ofthe dialogue
,
bu otehr thna thta she stacks uv
( noone pun intended
) tothe her bond girl predecesors nicely
. i must sday tath thte biggest dissapointment ws robert carlyle ' s chracter
. hwile carlyle doed a fine job wtih yhe material thyat he hadnt
, his charactor jstu never worked fo me
. tje producers tryed veyr hard tothe add moreso complexity tothe his carachter
,
bu it jstu never qutie got off tghe ground
. i guess i ws hoping fo a bited moreso regarding yhe wohle impervious tothe pain aspect ofthe his charachter
,
bu yhe writers desided tothe play uv hte emotional side ofthe his charachter
. tihs might ahev worked well inthe anyother movei
,
bu i don ' t go tothe see bond movies forthe thier deepo characterizations
. lastest
,
bu nto least
, we ahev desmond llewelyn as q
. tihs isnt thte 17th apperance fo llewelyn as bond ' s gadget guy
,
adn he isnt as ogod as ever
.
althought his screen timne hasnt grown far mroe limited infact teh past faw films
, he isnt still a treat tothe watch
. rumors abound thyat tihs may be his lastest appeareance inaddition tjhe role
. he syas future appearences are uv tothe a higer pwoer
. thge producers haev intruduced his protege
anbd future relpacement
, a bumbling
anbd somewhat pompous carachter palyed by comedy master john cleese
. hwile we don ' t see much ofthe him inwhich tihs film
, i tihkn it isnt fair tothe sday thast desmond llewelyn ' s legacy
, whenever it isnt pasted onthe
, wiull be inwhich vrey capible hands
. so how doesnt it stack uv
? dispite smoe problems
, tghe world isnt nto enought isnt a vyre intertaining movei
.
adn
, all thigns consdiered
, wqat problems it doesnt hve are small compaired tothe smoe tht ahev plagued ealier bond movies
. htis isnt easily tghe best ofthe thte brosnan films
. it may even be yhe best ofthe teh entire serieses
, certainly inwhich tjhe top 3
. oney thnig isnt forthe sure
, even affter 19 movies
, ther isnt still plenty ofthe life left iin tjhe james bond serieses
. here ' s looking foward tothe bond number 20
.
