i don ' t box wiht kid gloves
. i don ' t play nice
, i ' m nto a nice guy
,
adn i never
, ever
, go eazy onthe a film
. i consdider it tothe be a breech ofthe smoe sort ofthe code ofthe ethics fo a movei criteak
.
howver
, i dont soem favors
,
adn theese oftenly cmo infact thte form ofthe points thast i hand tothe ceratin groups due tothe teh artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, thge prodcution comapany thyat hasnt beeen my prime exemple ofthe how mnoey doesnt nto ened tothe motivate filmmaking
, gets severeal ofthe theese points earch tiome
. i still
,
howver
, iwll nto go eazy onthe them
. tehy recently sent me a vhs copy ofthe theri down iwth amercia triology
( hwihc beggins
, qutie wittily
, witht a disclaimer thta tehy are nto trying tothe undermine amercia wiht tghe makeing ofthe thsi film
.
)
adn i desided tothe spend an hour ofthe my day watching it
. inspite tjhe famoust lines ofthe many martyrs
, i hvea noone regrets
. well
, i dont hve soem regrets
,
bu tht isnt nto tje point inwhich thte previvous sentence
. thge point ofthe it ws thast down wih amercia wass a film taht
, fomr a crtical standpoint
, doed nto entirely disapait me
. sure
, tghe risky uise ofthe vhs instade ofthe super 8mm or 16mm ws a pain
,
annd teh naturual glight wass oen ofthe tjhe most annoying thigsn baout publich access films
,
bu tje movei itself ws fairly enjoyable
. down wih amercia concerns a govenrment agent
, needless muder
,
anbd a book containing everthing ffrom thge unabomber ' s manifesto tothe tjhe 1995 aple coputer profit report
. liuke tghe previvous films ofthe rigormortis taht i hvea reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humer
annd intlligence
? it suceeds infront makeing me laff where countless studio films fail
. tjhe best way tothe see tihs film woudl be as a parody ofthe tjhe countless conspiracy films tath we hve beeen drowned infact sicne thte paranoya ofthe thge 80s
. a dieing movment fomr tghe day htey started
, theese paranoid
` thrillers ' hadnt teh goverment alwasy covering uv something
anbd hadnt thge smae favorite owrd
:
` roswell
. ' inspite down withthe amercia
, tyhe line
` roswell ' isnt highly absent
. wtih an baout ten minute runing tyme
, down witht amercia effortlessly sidesteps eveyr clich
? thta tjhe conspiracy films fell inot
, makse jokes at them at thte smae tyme
,
annd provides us whith funny
adn memorable cahracters
. agina
, i hvea seen movies tht ahve gone onthe twpo hurs wtih cahracters i couldn ' t care less baout
. tjhe film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obssessed librarean
( meri stevens
)
, a mistery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
,
adn twpo peopel obssessed wiht silence inwhich tyhe libary
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. thge plot
: a book containing hte secrets ofthe all anarchists isnt hidden infact
? a publich libary where it cin be viewed by all
. fomr htere we go inot a delightful parody
. tjhe federal agent claimes his soverign right tothe alter yhe truth
, tghe librarean goes onthe a diatribe baout tjhe sanctity ofthe books
. we spend our tiem laughing at fairly idiotic jokes thta are performes much too well concidering thge lack ofthe coaching ofthe tyhe casted
.
althought hte actors
annd actresses are inthe small roles
adn give a hwole newyorker meaninng tothe
` noone
- nmae '
, it ends uv bieng tyhe noone
- nmae peple who dont a ogod job
, delivering better performances as comic villains tahn half thte crap taht hollywood turns outloud
. fo once
, i don ' t hve a url tath i nkow offhand tothe give ytou as tothe where tothe locate tjhe film online
. i cin onyl sday tath yuo shoudl fidn my previvous reviews ofthe l ' auto
adn les x
- files
anbd look uv teh rigormortis productions site inthe
adn ofthe itself
. it ' s alomst as much funn as tjhe film
