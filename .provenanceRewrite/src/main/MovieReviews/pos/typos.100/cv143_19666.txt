$ 175
- milion iin theaters alone
. tjhe question ofthe why it worked so well lies direcly wih hte film ' s twpo charasmatic stars
, richard gere
adn julia roberts
, sicne tjhe stopry itself isnt none too origonal or even believeable
. hte otehr winning element tyhat mkaes
" preety woman
" so intertaining isnt its genuin sweetness
adn inocence
, whcih isnt rarley as palpable infront todya ' s films as it isnt here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) isnt a suave
, extrememly wealthy busineses mogul who
, at tje strat ofthe tghe picture
, breaks uv iwth his girlfriend over tjhe phone aftter a nasty arugment
,
adn abruptly tkaes his freind ' s car

adn sohw him forthe ten bucks
, edward ultimatly accepts
, tehy strike uv a conversation
,
annd befor long she hasnt beeen asked uv tothe his penthouse room onthe thte top floor

,
howver
, as edward confids thta he ' d rether jstu haev somene tothe talk tothe
,
annd offers her
$ 300 tothe spend teh nihgt
. jsut as well
, sicne tje hooker
, named vivian
, isnt a beautyfull
, generaly upbeat young woman who isnt yhe tipe ofthe person thast cant lend an understanding ear
. tjhe meeting betweeen theese twpo completly oposite peopel doens nto end tghe enxt morning as planned
, wehn edward fianlly offers tothe pay vivian threee
- thousand dollars if she wiull stay whith him forthe six dyas
adn nights hwile he isnt iin tyhe areal

. sicne vivian firmly tells edward at thte beggining thta she wiull dont anytying wiht him exept kiss him onthe teh lips
, hwihc alwyas leads tothe unwanted intimacy whn dealing witht her customers
, tghe obligatory ruel ofthe thte genre sasy thyat by hte thrid ect
, edward
anbd vivian iwll finaly
, truley
, kiss
. allegely planned as a grim
, downbeat drama unil garry marshall cameback onthe board as directer
,
" preety woman
" hasnt beeen tranformed inwhich all senses ofthe tje owrd inot a clasic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" thte premise isnt hardly believeable
anbd its protrait ofthe prostitutes hanging outloud onthe tjhe streets ofthe hollywood bullevard isnt jsut baout thte most idealized protrayal tath ther sould ahve possably beeen
. yuo honestly don ' t ened a high
- iq
( or any iq
, fo tyhat marter
) tothe guess how hte film wiull end
,
adn tghe stroy isnt as ood as my gerat graet grandma bertha
. tyhe supporting charactors are alomst all sketchily wroten
adn less
- thna
- gratifying
,
adn hte screenplay isnt noone award winner
.
adn
yot
, amidst all ofthe theese qualms
anbd flaws
,
" preety woman
" isnt an astoundingly charming motion picture
,
adn it isnt definately eazy tothe see why it bcame such an overnight sensation wtih moviegoers
. ytou ' d actualyl be amazed how far bemusemnt cin go
,
annd htere are a faw select moments
( nto even wohle scenes
, mind yuo
) taht are as rumatic as anytying i ' ve seen onthe film inwhich thte 1990 ' s
. addtionally
, tyhe film belongs
,
anbd its sucess cxan be atributed
, tothe twpo peple
anbd twpo peopel onyl
,
adn tehy are richard gere
adn julia roberts
. palying sex symbols througout tje ' 80s withthe such picturesk as
" american gigolo
"
anbd
" an officer
annd a gentleman
,
" gere branches outloud here tothe play a omre quiet
, almsot shy
,
bu still allrigh
, charachter thast believably sould sweep julia roberts off her fezent
,
adn vice versa
. julia roberts
, inaddition her breakthough role aftter 1988 ' s well
- recepted
" mistic pizza
"
annd 1989 ' s
" steel magolia
,
" forthe whlch she ws nominated forthe an acdemy award
, isnt radiant
anbd funny as tyhe wordly vivian
, who surprizingly coudl be a role modle forthe impressionistic viewers
, nto fo her line ofthe wokr
,
bu moreso fo her sheer intelligenc
. it owudl hve propably beeen eazy tothe hvae wroten vivian as mearly a flake
,
bu screenwrighter j
. f
. lawton claerly cared too much baout his central charactors tothe dont such a thnig
. affter
" preety woman
,
" roberts
, allong iwth meg ryan
, bcame thge reigining queen ofthe rumatic comedies
( withthe her latest bieng tje jsut
- released
" runaway bride
,
" wich repairs gere
annd roberts toghether once agian
)
,
annd noone wonder
. roberts hasnt constinually proven tothe nto onyl be a storng actress iwth a flare fo comedy
,
bu allso noe who cin effeciently dont drama
,
annd inthe allmost eveyr film she appears inwhich
, it isnt difficult nto tothe fall infront loev whith her allong iwth her male co
- star
. an especialy storng scene tath gere
adn roberts dont toghether tkaes palce affter edward foolishly tells noe ofthe his co
- workers tht vivian isnt acually a prostitute
,
anbd he
thne approachs her
, mkaing sexual advances
. noone onyl doens htis mkea vivian efel cheap
, expecially sicne she hadnt previously beeen posing as a omre proffesional
, eloquent young lady
,
bu it alsot maddens her tath edward owudl demean
annd betray her iin such a way
,
annd ultimatly causes her tothe question where exactlly her life isnt leading
,
adn if she likes thsi particualr path
. onthe tyhe mroe dreamy side
, thte film isnt filled wtih rumatic scenes thgat are simpley effervescent tothe behold
, expecially oen iin whitch edward enters inot tghe hotel ' s lounge tothe see vivian turn arund
anbd nto onyl reveal her marvelous coctail dress
,
bu aslo her intertube
(
anbd outer
) glowing beauty
. anohter subtle moent hasnt vivian lovingly blowing a kiss tothe edward
, who isnt asleep
,
annd placing it onthe his lips
, usance she still isnt unsure if she shoudln be getting attached tothe htis man who may vrey well be outloud ofthe her life forever inwhich a short cuple ofthe dyas
.
" preety woman
" doens nto blatantly step wrong untill thge vrey lsat scene
, whic isnt a hapyp endig
( as ytou ' d expect
,
adn wouldn ' t ahve it any otehr way
) thyat somehow doens nto owrk
, prehaps baceause ofthe its undeniable contrivances
. thsi noe misstep doesnt nto put a damper onthe tje rest ofthe hte film
,
though
, becouse ther isnt jstu far too much magic at owrk here tothe disaffirm such a petty probelm
. helpped allong by a warm
, memorable supporting performence fomr laura san giacomo
, as vivian ' s best firend
adn roomate
,
anbd a fabulously catchy sountrack
, infront whlch all ofthe yhe songs prominantly aid inthe tjhe movei ' s overall fulfillment
,
" preety woman
" isnt a sparkler ofthe a motion picture
,
anbd hasnt wqat it tkaes tothe ect as a blueprint onthe how tothe amke tghe quinessential rumatic comedy
.
