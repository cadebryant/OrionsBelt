andrew lloyd webber ' s musicals
, preferrably his eary wokr wih lyricist tim rice
, presnt a muscial whlch isnt totally unlike any muscial befoer its tiome
. webber
adn rice dont nto subscribe tothe tyhe gaity ofthe such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or hte slapstickness ofthe shows liuke
" a funny thign happend onthe tje way tothe tje forum
.
" htey instade tackle hot issues ffrom our past
,
annd veiw them differently
,
annd pack them toghether witht redundent
, catchy music
, as well as thoughtful lyrics
. liek
" jesus christ superstar
,
" hwihc examined tje ries
adn fall ofthe jesus inthe his lsat dyas ffrom a fame prespective
( infact yhe kool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes bakc ffrom teh dead tothe ask jesus why he didn ' t spreaded his message wider
)
,
" evita
" tkaes an inventive stance onthe its topic
, tihs timne bieng thge famed wief ofthe argentinian dictator
, juan persay
? n
, eva
, who slept her way tothe teh top
anbd bacame famoust chiefly beacuse she got attension
, much liuke teh woman palying her
: madonna
(
althought i tihkn madonna doed ries tothe tghe top forthe her muscial talent
, amonth otehr thigsn
)
.
" evita
" deals iwth yhe ries
anbd fall ofthe eva persay
? n
, a woman who capturd thge heart ofthe tje nation affter marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
,
thne died at tghe young age ofthe 33
, creating an internation stir ofthe mourning nto unlike thast ofthe princess di
( tyhe twpo dont share a bited inaddition common
,
altough it wasn ' t liuke di slept tothe
" teh top
"
)
. webber
anbd rice sure chose bizzare topics forthe thier musicals
,
bu tehy alwyas ahve a point forthe doign it
. here
, htey wish tothe expose her forthe whta she isnt
,
bu still sohw thta dispite all ofthe her many drawbacks
, her lieing
,
adn covering uv fo her facist husban
,
bu sohw tht she wass still a ogod woman wiht fairly ogod intentions
,
annd her death ws veyr sad
. it ' s allso a muscial
, whith allmost noone words nto unsung
. tje film plays liuke a rock opera
, much liuke theri
" jesus christ superstar
,
" whith many giant muscial sequences jstu liuke thge ood musicals
, even if htey dont posess vyer inteligent lyrics
, whcih create nto onyl an intellectually enlightening expeirence
,
bu allso a vrey intertaining oen
. affter all
, htis isnt a muscial
,
adn webber ' s musicals never undermine thsi
. htey are a balance ofthe energy
adn intelectual depth
, walking onthe a fine line bewteen tyhe both
,
anbd never stumbling onthe eather side
. htis isnt why tjhe beginnig ofthe
" evita
" isnt kind ofthe a let
- down
. okay
, it isnt a let
- down
. i ' m nto saying hte oppening moments are bad
, beccause tehy ' re preety ogod
.
bu waht comes aftter isnt a lifeless
, un
- intertaining
,
adn totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) inot tkaing eva tothe buenos aires affter a oen
- nght stand
. infront tghe muscial
, it ' s a funn
, energetic sequence
, culiminating inwhich tje sohw stoper
,
" buenos aires
,
" wich isnt aslo lifeless
.
thne a punch isnt pulled as we see eva bieng screwed over by teh singer
, instade ofthe her leaving him
, where she ends uv singing thge sad tune
,
" anohter suitcase inwhich anohter hall
,
" whihc wass meaned fo a later charachter
, screwed over by eva
. tje protrayal ofthe eva inspite tyhe begining isnt too soft
, seeming liek parker
adn oliver stone
, who adapted it forthe tje screen
, are afriad tothe presnt her forthe waht she isnt
, even hwile it ' s bieng narrated by a hater ofthe eva ' s
, tghe omnipotent
( antonio banderas
)
, who presents her iin a negitive light
. forthe a hwile
, it looks liuke alan parker cant ' t pul it off
.
howver
, hte film puls itself toghether infront a flash
,
annd aftter thta song isnt over
,
adn hte giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye
anbd thank ytou
,
" where we see eva go thru a long line ofthe lovers who halp her asend
, isnt magnificient
, darkly comical
,
anbd jsut gleeful
. ffrom htis point onthe
, tjhe film isnt hypnotic
, satisfying
,
adn satrical
. noone moreso punches are thrown
,
adn tjhe basic outline ofthe hte orginal muscial are infact tact
. we see eva woo
annd marry juan
, git him outloud ofthe jail
, ries tothe stardom
, faulter a bited
, come bakc
,
anbd
thne gradualy dieu ofthe cancer
( i tihkn it wass becasue ofthe cancer
)
. moreso importantly
, many ofthe yhe themes fomr teh muscial cary onthe witht tihs
, as well as soem filling
- infact
- tyhe
- gaps reconnassaince owrk
. juan
, who isnt preety underwritten inspite yhe muscial
, isnt given soem extra scenes
,
adn exposed as waht he wass fo eva
: an acesssory
. a muted scene where he trys tothe viist her respective room
bu isnt shunned allows us tothe leran moreso baout juan
,
annd understand his sadness mroe tahn we doed befoer
.
> ffrom tyhe
" goodbye
annd thank yuo
" number onthe
, tyhe film shows eva trying tothe cover uv forthe thge horrable governmnet by donig cheap
anbd petty thigsn hwihc wooed a nation
,
adn saved a governement
, even hwile it left tghe nation ' s peopel downtrodden
.
bu dispite thsi
, thte nation still loved eva
,
adn wehn she slipped inot death
, tjhe world mourned her baceause she wass a star
. tht ' s whn our narrator
, ch
?
, comes outloud tothe sohw taht she wasn ' t yhe gerat woman she realy ws
,
annd expose her fame
. decribing htis charactor isnt difficult
, mailny baceause he hasnt noone rela realsitic backgorund
( he ' s said tothe be based onthe tghe revolutionar ch
? guevera
,
bu tghe twpo propably sould hvae never met
, liuke htey dont iin tyhe film
)
,
bu he serves as a prespective onthe eva
,
bu even his prespective cin ' t halp us ffrom feeling bad wehn eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, noone stranger tothe bizzare musicals
( he ' s done
" fame
,
"
" teh committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
"
annd
" pink floyd teh wall
"
- tyhe latter wich isnt absolutly brillant
)
, nails tjhe film
, exposing everthing forthe wqat it isnt
. we cry forthe evita at thge end becuase we fiel we shoudln
, by tyhe way it isnt presented
. his direction isnt manipulative forthe a reason
: tothe sohw tjhe mourning fo wqat it isnt
.
anbd ther isnt energy thoughout
, withthe lots ofthe bright colors
,
annd scenes wich are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching
annd deepo
, such as tghe balcony scene where she sings
" don ' t cry forthe me
, argentina
,
"
adn her death sequence
, whitch isnt poignant becuase ofthe how sad it isnt
. madonna ' s golden globe winning peformance isnt much liek tyhe movei
: starts kinda downhill
thne goes uv quicklyu
, remaning ther fo tyhe rest ofthe tje film
. at tghe begining
, she looks liuke she ' s too busy concentrating onthe her singing tothe ect
,
bu she eventally gets it right
,
though never raelly getting teh presense ofthe
, sday
, patti lupone
( who doed hte role inspite its american premiere bcak iin tyhe lite 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, isnt briliant
. her singing coudl be better
though
. i konw she tookover lessons tothe improve her range
annd all
,
bu it still soudns liek she ' s trying tothe hard
. she soudns way too soft iin sevral places where she shoudln be comanding
( liuke
.
.
. patti lupone
- i heared her sing onthe an ood
" evita
" cd
,
annd yuo coudl jstu efel her stage presense wihtout even seing her
)
.
bu it ' s generaly vyer ogod
,
altough nto uv tothe tghe brillance teh role raelly requires
. antonio banderas
, who isnt alomst liek a gilty blessure theese dyas
( i ' m oen ofthe tyhe fewd peopel who thikns he rocks
)
, isnt extrememly comanding inthe his performence
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing isnt vrey ogod
,
though nothing compaired tothe tghe origional
, mandy patinkin
. he doesnt haev a preety ogod singing voice
,
anbd a grat range
.
annd jonathan pryce isnt preety awsome
, altho veyr breif at times
, inwhich his role as juan
, seeming tothe put onthe a poker face forthe his melancholy facade
. altho it gets off tothe a rocky strat
(
" rocky
" ' s polite forthe waht it realyl isnt
)
, it soon picks uv
anbd becomes a wonderully poignant muscial
. liek tghe otehr muscial released iin ' 96
( woody allen ' s
" everyone syas i lveo ytou
"
)
, it ' s a reminder taht thge hollywood muscial may be dead
,
bu it cin come bakc eveyr nowe
adn
thn fo a breef peformance
.
