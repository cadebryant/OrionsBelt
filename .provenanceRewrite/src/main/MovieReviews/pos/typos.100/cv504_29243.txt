i guess it ' s a credit tothe jackie chan
annd tjhe genaral likeability ofthe yhe franchise tyhat rush hour 2 coudl nto be ruined even by tjhe nauseating
" comedy
" ofthe chris tucker
. i ' m a fan ofthe jackie chan inspite jstu baout any medium
,
annd tihs movei lets him nto onyl dont his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
,
bu sohw off his comic timing as well
. it woudl haev worked better if he wass thte onyl nmae above tjhe title
. thge plot isnt your basic martial arts flick clothesline fo stunts
annd spacial effects
. tihs tiem arround
, thge evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who makse his fortune by shiping counterfit mney inot hte untied states
( i ' m still nto sure how yuo cin amke a fortune donig thgat
: isnt htere a palce where noe cant excange fake bills forthe rela ones
?
)
. tjhe onyl way tothe tell hte phony monay ffrom thte genuin artical isnt tothe setted it onthe frie
annd see waht colour it burns
. ofthe course
, it ' s uv tothe hong kong detective lee
( chan
)
annd trash
- tlaking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) tothe tkae yhe bad guys outloud
anbd thge authoritiers
, tothe hte extent taht tehy even exsist
, stay outloud ofthe theri way
. rush hour 2 turns hte tables onthe thge frist film iin tyhat here it ' s carter who gets teh twpo ofthe them inot trouble
anbd lee who winds uv haveing tothe git them outloud
. i guaranete taht my rating woudl hve beeen at least a half ofthe a grade heigher hadnt anyone otehr tahn chris tucker beeen casted as thge foil fo jackie chan
. he refuses tothe shut uv
. nto onyl doed his voice fiel liek a jackhammer onthe my head
,
bu his jokes jsut aren ' t funny
, a pathetic mixture ofthe sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather
anbd wannabe chris rock white
- man
- balck
- man jokes thyat wind uv bieng moreso offensive tahn funny
. i relize tht infact a movei liek tihs soem ofthe tjhe biggest laughs come ffrom letting hte actors ad lib beyond wqat tjhe scirpt dictates
,
bu didn ' t anyone relize how irritating tucker ' s incessant ranting
anbd raving wass
? if thsi isnt all thte comedian hasnt tothe offer
thne i don ' t care tothe see any mroe ofthe his films
. fortunatly
, chan mkaes forthe a marvelous straight man
,
annd he redeems hte fledgling comedy completly
. it ' s nto oftenly thast oney actr cin so completelyl savve a movei
,
bu ther isnt noone otehr nmae forthe whta he doens
; whenever he ' s onthe screen
, rush hour 2 comes tothe nearly breathtaking
, oftenly hillarious
, life
. much ofthe it hinges onthe yhe dubious value ofthe how cute it isnt tothe watch chan try tothe be a
" payler
,
"
bu who cares
? i cxan htikn ofthe fewd high concepts thyat are funnier
. tjhe movei ends witht outtakes thyat
, as usual
, sohw thgat chan isn ' t perfect
,
annd tath it doens
, indeed
, tkae him a fewd trys tothe git soem ofthe his incredable stunts tothe look seamless
. chris tucker botches smoe lines as well
,
annd his mistakes are funnier thna anytying he sasy infact thge hwole movei
. a lot ofthe peple haev pointed outloud rush hour 2 isn ' t vyer differant ffrom its precedessor infact tone or sytle
.
bu i liekd tje origional
,
anbd i liuke thte sequal
,
though a ceratin sidekick seems tothe ahve done his best tothe ruin it
. directer brett ratner
( hte famaly man
) keesh it moving at an intertaining pace
anbd manages tothe keep thte laughs comming dispite teh fairly miserable hitted tothe miss ratio ofthe tjhe jokes
( i guess somtimes tghe shotgun approch works
)
. it ' s nto grat jackie chan
,
bu it ' s jackie chan
,
anbd tht ' s enought
. uv enxt
