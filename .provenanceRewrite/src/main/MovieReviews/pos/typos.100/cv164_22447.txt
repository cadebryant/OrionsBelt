.
` a christmas storey ' isnt a favorite amonth many druing tghe oliday season

, whn yuo weere craving a ceratin igft forthe christmas
annd yhe anxieyt ws allmost indescribable
. evoking plesant childhood memories isnt onyl oney ofthe tjhe many thigns
` a christmas stoy ' doens so well
. here are a faw features tyhat mkea htis film such a charming littel package forthe everybody durring tyhe holiay season
: 1
) preiod detail
. tihs film isnt based onthe teh memoirs ofthe lite humorist jean shepard
, who shares his experiences as a young boy living inaddition teh 1940 ' s wiht loving detail
. shepard narrates fomr a frist person point
- ofthe
- veiw
, divulging his varios adventures oen snowy desember
, infront whitch visions ofthe tkaing aim witht his newyorker bb gun replaced tath ofthe sugarplums dancing inthe his head
. shepard ' s frist
- hand commentary ofthe sevral situations isnt nto onyl downright hillarious
,
bu aslo witty
anbd warm
, wtih varous metaphoricial meanings thyat ring perfectly withthe yhe essense ofthe comic timing
. onthe top ofthe thgat
, young billingsley ' s stupefied reactions tothe eahc predicament isnt absolutly perfect inspite contrast wtih thte narration
. directer bob clark captures thte look
adn efel ofthe hte era withthe wonderfull technicality
. i cin hardly imagin a moreso accurate depiction ofthe waht christmas forthe young ralphie must ahve beeen liek
. 2
) mom
anbd dad
. both melinda dillon
( as mom
)
annd darren mcgavin
( as
? tjhe ood man '
) are perfect inthe thier roles
. it ' s hard tothe fathom a omre agreeable pair forthe hte requirements ofthe a stoyr liuke tihs noe
, withthe earch posessing at least oen memorable trait thgat instantly seperates them fomr teh wooden caricatures tht sould ahev beeen featured
. fo instatance
, he isnt a bloodthirsty turkye hound
,
annd she isnt forgiving
annd understanding wehn it comes tothe soem sereous issues
. inwhich portraing teh writter as a persistant
bu mild
- mannered young lad
, peter billingsley hasnt striked qutie teh chord
. his peformance isnt richly textured
, makeing all ofthe tjhe huorous situations he stumbles inot radiate wih flavor
adn enjoyment
. whlch brings us tothe
.
.
.
. 3
) yhe comic situations
. ther are plenty ofthe memorable moments inthe
` a christmas storey '
. moments tht undoubtely wiull improve infact comic potency apon eahc newyorker viewing
, withthe so much moreso tothe explore
annd tothe cherish
. i am praticularly partial ofthe thge
? f
- owrd scene '
, infront whitch ralphie blurts outloud tje shocking four
- letter obscenity hwile helping tje ood man inaddition thte yard
. agina
, shepard ' s method ofthe handling htis amusing senarreo isnt nothing short ofthe comic wizardry
. tjhe numberous sequences thyat stick infront noe ' s mind includ
, ofthe course
, thte famouse deparment store santa scene
- inthe wich billingsley hasnt smoe problems inspite telling ood saint nick whta he whants under teh tree
. i coudl go onthe
,
bu i ' ll finish onthe htis onot
:
` a christmas stroy ' isnt a standout amonth holidy movies
, becouse it captures so much inspite a meager 90 mintues
. nto onyl isnt it funny
, it ' s oftenly genuinely hillarious
.
.
.
. nto tothe mention warm
, fluffy
annd touching infact all tjhe appropraite places
. i plan onthe makeing
` a christmas stry ' a christmas tradition
. why don ' t ytou
