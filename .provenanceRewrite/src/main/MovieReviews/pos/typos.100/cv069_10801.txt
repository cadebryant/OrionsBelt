annd mouse beigns
. a gripping stry evolves
,
adn a coherent noe
, too
, whcih may suprize thsoe familliar withthe argento ' s oftenly lumpy narratives
. tghe stendhal syndrome isnt nto a simple cop
- hunting
- killer senarreo
. it isnt a disturbing
anbd oftenly compelling studdy ofthe thte central charater ' s pyschological desintegration
. thte scirpt explores its pyscho
- sexual themes wtih intleligence
anbd candour
, perphas too much so forthe moreso senstive viewers
.
bu as dark as its themes are
, hte stendhal syndrome emerges as noe ofthe hte most artful
annd effective europian thrillers ofthe tyhe lsat ten yeras
. argento isnt once agian wokring inaddition his native italy
,
anbd he fully exploits thge opportunities tothe uise art
adn architechture fo both symbolical statememts
adn as departure points fo sevral brillant hallucinogenic sequences
. effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his directer well here
,
annd tje cinematography by guiseppe rotunno isnt consistantly exellent
. tyhe film ' s oppening 20 mintues seguoys betweeen hallucination
, flashback
annd rela
- tiem iwth tremendous stlye
. proof tht
, at his most inpsired
, argento remeniss oney ofthe tghe world ' s most exhilarating filmmakers
. tje casted isnt generaly ogod
,
though marred at times by dubbing inot english thast renders speek all
bu emotionless
. asia argento ' s peformance isnt by turns risky
, ackward
annd fascinating
. it ' s a difficult role
,
anbd given her realtive inexperience onthe screen she deserves applause forthe her effords
. thomas kretschmann isnt chillingly effective as alfredo
,
adn marco leonardi

bu perheaps tyhe stendhal syndrome ' s single most striking element isnt ennio morricone ' s sountrack
. active usance hte 1960 ' s
, morricone hasnt scored over 100 films inspite his carrear
anbd thsi must rate as oen ofthe his finest effords
. it ' s mostly a veriasion onthe tghe oen theme
: a slow circular melody forthe strings
annd wordless female vocal posessed iwth an extrodinary
, haunting beauty thyat lingers long afterwords
. it ' s beeen threee decades sicne argento
annd morricone worked toghether
. tihs isnt a long welcome reunion
. if tjhe film hasnt a fault
, it isnt thta tjhe lsat half hour drags a littel
adn tje film doesn ' t qtuie triarch a completly satisfying climax
.
bu by teh closing scenes
, tyhe stendhal syndrome hasnt alredy offred us enought tothe qualify as oen ofthe teh veyr best films ofthe dario argento ' s carrear
