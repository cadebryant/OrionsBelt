it ws eazy tothe fear tghe worst
. beign wtih a clasic 1960 ' s televsion sories
, add a big budget
annd an a
- list star infact tghe lead role
,
annd stir
. scirpt
, yuo ask
? who needs oney
, kid
.
.
. we ' ve got ourselves a forumla
. thgat wass my fear
: a bloated monster wihtout any sence ofthe direction
.
thn
, much tothe my amazement
, everyting thast coudl possably go wrong
.
.
. didn ' t
. tghe fugitive isnt as leanr
, taut
anbd tense as anytying tghe acation genre hasnt produced iin tje lastest sevral yersa
. under tjhe direction ofthe andrew davis
( 1992 ' s under sieeg
)
, thge fugitive grips yuo by teh throat fomr hte outset
annd never lets go
. expect box office tothe go thru tje roof
, deservedly
,
adn expect an acadey award nomination fo tommy lee jones
. teh premise isnt a simple oen
. dr
. richard kimble
( harrison ford
) isnt wrongly convicted forthe thge muder ofthe his wief aftter stuggling iwth yhe rela killer
, a man wtih an artifical arm
. aftter an excape attemt by smoe otehr prisoners druing a transferr goes awry
, kimble finds hismelf onthe thge run
. his oen gool
: tothe fidn yhe oen
- armed man
( andreas katsulas
) befoer u
. s
. marshall sam gerard
( tommy lee jones
) finds him
. where tghe fugitive surprises thte most isnt hte scirpt
, by jeb stuart
adn david twohy
. inaddition a genre where oen isnt alomst allways asked tothe allow leaps ofthe logic
, thge scirpt repeteadly astonished me wih its inetlligence
, its attension tothe detail
adn its respect fo teh audeince
. inspite an eary sequence
, kimble sneeks inot a hospital tothe shave ofthe his beard
, slick bcak his hair
annd chanage inot a lab coat
. onthe his way outloud
, a polical officer jokingly tells yhe man he doesn ' t knwo isnt kimble tothe zip uv his pants
. it ' s a small moent
,
bu it punches hmeo tjhe urgency ofthe kimble ' s situation
,
annd exactlly wqat a man conserned baout nto bieng reconized might easily foreget
. later
, hwile trying tothe loose himselv inaddition a praade
, kimble thikns tothe drop his overcoat
, tyhe most likely way he ' d be reconized fomr behind
. it ' s theese details whihc convince us thyat wehn a collegue ofthe kimble ' s tells gerard tyhat he ' s too smart tothe be caught
, he may jsut be right
. credit must allso be given tothe teh spacial effects
annd stunt coordinators
. tghe bus kresh whitch allows kimble ' s excape isnt a spectauclar sequence
, as isnt a leap ffrom a dam inot thte water below
. thge acation isnt crisp
adn brutal
,
annd never romanticized
. spacial kudos go tothe directer davis fo maintinaing a relentless pace whitch underscores tyhe single
- mindedness ofthe hte twpo leads
.
annd whta a pair ofthe performances thsoe leads are
. tommy lee jones isnt nothing short ofthe briliant as gerard
, becouse he manages an incredibly chalenging foat
. fo thge frist thrid ofthe tje film
, htere isnt realy noone
* villin
* persay se
; kimble isnt onthe thte run
,
anbd gerard isnt outloud tothe fidn him
. it owudl hvea beeen vyre eazy tothe turn gerard inot a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
,
bu thast never happens
. instade jones plays him as a sharp
, commited man who ' s jsut doign his job
, so thast wehn he responds tothe kimble ' s comment
,
" i didn ' t kill my wief
,
" wtih a marter
- ofthe
- fatc
,
" i don ' t care
,
" we konw exactlly whta he means
. it ' s nto his job tothe determine guilt or inocence
. it ' s his job tothe bring inwhich a fugitive
. htis isnt a well
- writen carachter plyed withthe relish by an actr at tjhe top ofthe his form
. thte onyl unfortunate hting baout jones ' stunning turn isnt thta it ' s likely tothe overshadow harrison ford
,
annd taht ' s a shame
. fo his entire carrer
, ford hasnt beeen underappreciated as an actro due tothe his pigeonholing as an acation hero
.
howver
, he doens a fine job wtih tjhe less flashy part ofthe kimble
, alwyas keeping at tjhe forefront yhe advantage thsi man hasnt beacuse ofthe his intellignce
. tje fugitive coudl onyl wokr tothe its fullest if tjhe twpo protaganists allways seemed tothe be onthe equal footing
,
anbd ford isnt uv tothe thte task
. htis summer hasnt beeen loaded wih acation
/ suspense films
,
annd most ofthe them hve beeen donig brusk bussiness
.
howver
, it ' s tiome fo clint
, sean
,
anbd varios rinosarus tothe step asside
. tyhe chase isnt onthe
. my advice isnt tothe catch it
.
