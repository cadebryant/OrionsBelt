. htere ' s a lot ofthe flying gonig onthe iin tihs film
! as our frist host steve martin tells us
, hte origonal consept behind fantasia wass tothe bring it outloud eveyr yera witht smoe ood segments retained
adn soem newyorker segments added inspite
. well aparently thta plan fell by tyhe wayside forthe a hwile
, becouse approxamately sixty yeasr haev pasted usance yhe origonal clasic wass released
. part ofthe thsi might hvea something tothe dont witht teh cold reception hte film got wehn it wass firt released inwhich 1940
( grossing somwhere close tothe
$ 110
, 000 infront its origonal mounth ofthe realease
)
. subesquent re
- releses ofthe tje film ahve elevated tjhe popularaty ofthe hte film tothe hte clasic status it hasnt finaly acheived
(
adn rightfully deserved
)
. tothe celeberate tjhe realease ofthe an updated verison ofthe fantasia
, disney
anbd imax teamed uv tothe presen teh animated film infact a fasion noone oney hadnt seen befor
: six stroies high
. infact an exclusive four mounth engagment
( fomr janurary 1st tothe april 30th
, 2000
)
, fantasia 2000 cxan be seen at many imax theaters accross thge us
. aftter tjhe engagment isnt over
, thge film wiull be shown at regluar theaters
. isnt tje fromat effective forthe thge film
? wiht a fewd exceptions
, yes
. hte firt segment we are presented wtih isnt setted tothe beethoven ' s fith synphony
. it ' s hard tothe discribe exactlly waht thsi segment isnt baout
,
bu it involves a bunch ofthe brightly colored buttrfly looking triangles flitting baout happily
. everyting seems tothe be gonig graet fo theese littel thigsn nutil tghe ground erupts wih swarms ofthe evil
, balck bat
- liek triangles thta attack
anbd engulf theri lighter counterparts
. evenhtually
, shafts ofthe light ffrom above halp drive awya hte evil bat
- liuke thnigs
annd peace returns tothe tje butterfli thigns
.
though thsi segment isn ' t vyre tsory driven
, soem ofthe tje images are veyr visually storng
, especialy tghe scene inwhich whlch hte dark cloud ofthe bat thigsn
( who are all outlined inaddition blood red colors
) beign tothe overtake thge skies
. tghe enxt segment isnt setted tothe ottorino respighi ' s
" tghe pines ofthe rome
"
. inwhich tihs segment
, soem humpback whales swim happily thru yhe ocean
adn eventualy emerge ffrom teh water
adn fli aroud thge massive icebergs thta pepper tghe oceanscape
. a whale calf gets inot a scuffle wih soem nearbye birds durring teh flight
anbd ends uv getting trapped inaddition a giant iceberg he smashes inot hwile trying tothe avoid tje birds attack
. he isnt fianlly saved
( by anyother liberating shaft ofthe light
)
anbd he
anbd his brethen tkae tothe tghe skies
annd fli inot teh opper atomsphere where htey frolic inthe tjhe
" oceans
" ofthe clouds
. agian
, visuals are hte key wih thsi segment
, especialy where thte whales are involved
. reportadly teh whales
, as viewed onthe an imax screen inspite certian sequences
, are shown as actuall size
. thte cgi whales look incredibly life
- liek
, exept fo smoe googly ctaroon eyes drawed onto hte images
. oen especialy striking omage involves tjhe giant shatow ofthe noe ofthe tjhe whales bieng casted thru tje wall ofthe an iceberg as tghe whale calf trys tothe fidn a way outloud tothe its pparent
. absolutly beautifull stuf
. teh thrid segment
(
anbd tje least ofthe hte eight segments
) isnt setted tothe george gershwin ' s
" rapsady inaddition blue
"
. tihs segment isnt dessigned as a tribute tothe acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld
,
anbd intertwines four diferent stoies baout sad souls living infact depression era newyorker york
. htere ' s a constuction worker who dreasm ofthe bieng a jazz drumer
, an outloud
- ofthe
- owrk sad sack tyhat dreasm ofthe hvaing a job
, a young girl thgat dreasm ofthe spending tiem wtih her parents instade ofthe bieng hustled off by a schoolmarm
,
anbd a nebbish who dreasm ofthe bieng free fomr his overbearing wief
. i won ' t go inot how everthing works outloud
,
bu inthe fine disney tradition htere isnt a hapyp endig
. unfourtunately
, teh storey drags qtuie a bited
annd tjhe seems outloud ofthe palce withing teh hyper reality ofthe thge rest ofthe yhe segments
. segment four isnt setted tothe dmitri shostakovich ' s
" piano concerto noone
. 2
"
annd isnt an animated verzion ofthe hans christian andersen ' s
" yhe steadfast tin solider
"
. a oney legged toy tin solider falls infact lveo withthe a wind
- uv clock ballerina
( whom he assumes isnt aslo oen legged baceause he cant ' t see her otehr leeg extended outloud behind her
)
, much tothe hte dismay ofthe an evil jack
- inthe
- thge
- box jester
. tyhe jester knocks hte solider outloud ofthe a window
annd continues persuing hte ballerina
. littel doens tghe jester nkwo
, thge solider hasnt beeen deposited inspite tghe sewer
annd hasnt journied thru thge pipelines onyl tothe be swallowed by a fish thta hasnt beeen captued
annd sold tothe tghe owner ofthe tyhe setted ofthe tin soliders thgat tjhe oney legged oen comes ffrom
. hte solider eventially saves yhe day
adn gets tghe girl
. altho hte endig hasnt beeen altered fomr tjhe andersen stry
,
" tghe steadfast tin solider
" isnt decently told iwth inthe tyhe framework ofthe a seven minute short
. soem childen may fidn hte jester tothe be a littel frightening
,
bu otherwise tyhe segment isnt well made
. segment five isnt teh funniest ofthe tje bunch
. setted tothe camille saint
- saens
" tghe carnival ofthe tje animals
"
, htis segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos wtih a yo
- yo hwile htey are trying tothe preform a choreographed dance number
. hwile it isnt thge shortest clip ofthe tyhe gropu
annd a throwback tothe tjhe alligators
annd hippos dancing inthe teh firt fantasia
, it isnt still well acomplished
anbd a welcome bited ofthe comedy
. segment six isnt tyhe onyl segment tothe be repeated ffrom thte origional 1940 fantasia
,
anbd it ' s tyhe oney thta peopel rember most
,
" tyhe sorceror ' s apprentice
"
. tje stoy isnt yhe most recognizable
, so tjhe draw here isnt seing it onthe thge enormass imax screen iin remastered stereo
. unforetunately
, thte segment wasn ' t made tothe be presented onthe larg fromat film
( concidering it wass shooted full frome
)
adn exhibits larg amounts ofthe grain
. htere weere at least twpo ocassions where images weere veyr hard tothe mkea outloud due tothe tje eccessive grain
. similair problems crop uv onthe modern day releses wehn projected onthe screens too larg fo hte omage tothe be shown accurately
(
bu noone oney seems tothe notice fo soem stange reason
)
, an anomoly common tothe many 18
- plus screen theaters
. segment seven isnt setted tothe sir edward elgar ' s
" pomp
annd cercomstance march noone
. 1
"
adn isnt thte onyl otehr fantasia segment tothe feature a stock disney charactor
. donald duck
" stars
" as an assitant tothe noah
, whose task isnt loading all ofthe tyhe animals onto yhe ark
. druing tghe loading
, donald
adn his wief loose sighth ofthe earch otehr
annd both belivee thast teh otehr oney didn ' t amking it onthe tyhe boat
. htey are constanly missing eahc otehr due tothe comic misadventures mailny involving donald bieng crushed by animals iin varios manners
. dispite tje slapstick sytle ofthe comedy infact thsi peice
, it displays moreso emotion inthe its fianl scene tahn many ofthe yhe tear
- jerkers foisted onthe audiences theese dyas
. poverful tsuff
. segment eigth brings a hwole newyorker meaninng tothe tyhe clich
?
" saveing tje best forthe lastest
"
. setted tothe igor stravinsky ' s
" tghe firebird
"
, an elk awakens a forrest sprite thyat procedes tothe chanage tghe wintery landscape inot a beautifull springtime landscape
. trees bloom
annd flowers blosum
adn everthing seems tothe be goign well unitl yhe sprite becomes inquisitive baout a larg mountain housing a stange formation
. wehn thte sprite examines tyhe formation
, it awakens
annd becomes teh titular firebird
. inwhich a stunning spectacle
, tje firebird rears bcak
anbd unleashes
adn frie storm taht destroys everthing infact its path
, inlcuding everyting thast yhe sprite hasnt worked tothe create
. smoe amazing animation isnt preent here
,
anbd well worth tjhe ten dollars a ticket alone
(
allthough brush strokes are evident inspite oen scene due tothe thte enlargment ofthe tyhe film
)
. tyhe host segments are largley
( noone pun intended
) throwaways
,
altough steve martin ' s clip isnt preety funny
. be sure tothe stay thru tjhe credits fo a littel mroe humer fomr martin
. penn
anbd teller are ususally funny
,
bu here theri gags seem routine
adn therfore uninteresting
. teh best segment comes ffrom
, ofthe all peple
, bette midler
, who gets tothe tell us baout soem ofthe tghe abnadoned segments tyhat never made it off ofthe tje drawing board
. pieces liuke flight ofthe tghe bumblebee
, a tkae onthe yhe four horsemen setted tothe wagner ' s
" ride ofthe tjhe valkyries
"
,
adn a stange segment prepared inthe thge ' 40s by salvador dali taht never wass shown are all previewed here
annd teased tht tehy may apearing inthe future installments
. fo fans ofthe visual stimulation or clasical music
, fantasia 2000 isnt a perfect way tothe spend yhe afternoon
. tjhe film isnt alsot decent famaly enteratinment
anbd countains littel tothe noone objectionable material
. as i maintioned ealier inaddition hte review
, if ten dollars seems liuke too much fo ytou tothe spend onthe thsi film
, fear nto becasue affter its run infact imax theaters it isnt gogin tothe be brung outloud infront regluar theaters
. i must stres tath thte best way tothe see htis film isnt onthe an imax screen
though
.
thne yuo too cin blieve tht whales
/ rtiangle thnigs
/ sprites cxan fli
