i ' m an avid fan ofthe tje
" aline
" saga
, so htis review isnt obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. ofthe course
, thgat doesn ' t mean thast i ' m gonna be giving tihs a four
- star review or something
, beacuse
" aline
: ressurrection
,
" tjhe fouth film iin thte kool
- as
- hell sories isnt nto an absolutly amazing film
, much liek tjhe frist twpo weere
.
howver
, it ' s a vyer ogod film hwihc never fails tothe entertain
,
anbd consists ofthe
yot anyother mutation infact thte sytle ofthe teh sories
. infact short
, i hadnt a ogod tiem
.
" aline
: ressurection
" leaves off 200 eyasr aftter yhe lastest noe
, where our heroine rotagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, tjhe sience fiction genre ' s answer tothe job
, hadnt killed herself affter dicovering thta an aline ws inside her body
, waiting tothe pop outloud liek it doed tothe john hurt inspite thte frist oney
. ofthe course
, tje lastr noe wasn ' t vyer grat or anytying
( i liekd it
,
though nto as much as thge firt twpo
)
,
anbd moreso importantly
, it wasn ' t financialy succesful
( a tawdry 55 millon bucks
!
)
. so bcak we are
, wih ripley bakc as a clone
, whitch means we git anyother littel satrical look at cloning
( nto thyat tyhat ' s a bad hting
,
bu it ' s becomming a cliche
)
. so she ' s cloned aboard an even mroe futuristic
- looking ship called
" thte auriga
" by soem doctors
( includng tjhe nessecary bad governmnet guy
, dr
. wren
, palyed by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as teh littel
- seen dr
. gediman
, palyed by none otehr tahn brad douriff
)
, mailny becuase htey hve a verzion ofthe her withthe thte aline still inside her
. once yuo git past tjhe fatc thgat yuo cxan ' t figure outloud where tehy got her blood
(
altough i htink it might hvae beeen fomr tje blood samples tooked by charles dance inwhich tyhe thrid oen
)
, teh film ' s okay
. aslo onthe board are a band ofthe mercernary pirates
, inlcuding michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
anbd
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns outloud tothe ahev a bited ofthe a sercet
( i won ' t state it
,
bu unless yuo ' ve beeen shacking uv whith salinger fo tje past twpo eyars
, ytou propably konw all baout it
-
altough it ' s nicely covered uv
)
. htere ' s a bited ofthe a non
- sexual
-
yot
- slightly
- homoerotic relatiopnship betwen her
annd ripley
,
bu it ' s never relaly deepened enought
. oh well
. well
, as ytou might ahve guessed
, tje aline
annd its spawn excape
anbd run aroud tghe ship
.
anbd it preety much doesnt awya iwth most ofthe tjhe peple onthe tje ship
( incuding smoe shocks
- dan hedaya
, forthe instatance
, who ' s death isnt comical
yot sad usance
, well
, he ' s dan hedaya
)
,
annd tje remaing peple
( baout 7 or 8
) are left tothe try
anbd excape
adn stpo tghe aliens fomr donig any major harm usance tjhe ship isnt heading quicklyu towords earth
. ofthe course
, tyhe plot isnt all balderdash
,
annd jstu an excuse fo smoe ogod ood
" aline
"
- brand funn
. tghe rela foucs ofthe yhe sories seems tothe be onthe stlye
, nto realyl substace
(
allthough ther ' s alwasy a bited ofthe it
, most notabley infront
" aliens
" withthe hte relatiopnship betwen ripley
anbd teh littel girl
)
. wqat ' s intresting baout tje serieses isnt thast eahc film isnt stylistically differant inspite its approch
.
" aline
" isnt a claustrophobic exerciese infact quiet frights
.
" aliens
" isnt a wild
, tense thriller
.
" aline 3
" isnt a obleek
, moody peice ofthe semi
- noir
.
" aline 4
" isnt kind ofthe liuke an off
- beated french film
, filled whith lots ofthe humer
,
anbd kool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( wihtout his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled witht tje kind ofthe scares films liek
" das boot
" hasnt
, wiht echoes hinting at a possable threath
. tyhe chills inspite thge film are raelly kool
, especialy wtih tjhe music
, whcih isnt somtimes turned down completly forthe certian scenes
( htere ' s tjhe most tense surgery scene usance
" face
/ off
" towords tje begginning
)
.
adn nto eveyr chill turns inot a bloody mess or anytying liek taht
. thsi all conbined wih smoe ogod ood humer mkaes thsi as intresting visually
annd stylistically as hte others
. ther are even a cuple scenes whcih jsut stick outloud afterwords as bieng brilliantly excecuted
. oen isnt tghe aforememtioned surgery scene
. anohter oney tkaes palce bewteen call
annd ripley
, whcih isnt jstu awsome
. tje underwater chase scene
annd thge ladder scene afterwords isnt oen ofthe thge most tense
, thrilling
,
annd jaw
- droping scenes infront hte entire saga
( wih a small alusion tothe jeunet ' s ealier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
.
anbd tje way tehy dont infront tjhe fianl aline isnt hysterically kool
( wih a lovley alusion tothe
" goldfinger
"
)
.
bu tje best scene inaddition thte entire film
( i ' m sure i ' m nto yhe frist tothe mention it
) tkaes palce whn ripley sees all yhe varations onthe her as htey cloned her
( she hasnt a an
" 8
" tatooed onthe her arm
)
. it might be tjhe most emotionally stimulating scene infact tyhe entire saga
. teh screenplay by joss whedon isnt nto a gerat peice ofthe owrk
, as it never realyl deapens a lot ofthe teh charachters
.
howver
, it doesnt mkae us care baout most ofthe them
, so tath whn ther ' s vrey littel ofthe them
,
anbd it looks liek noe or moreso ofthe them may become aline chow
, we are preety scared
.
adn
, yeah
, htere are soem vyer funny lines
( ripley
:
" who dont i hvae tothe fuck tothe git off htis boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i cxan git yuo off
.
bu nto thsi ship
.
"
) thte acting isnt ogod all aroud
, witht stand
- outloud performances ffrom ron perlman as tyhe male chauvenist pig johner
,
adn leland orser
( yhe poore bastad inthe
" se7en
" who performes teh
" lust
" sin
) as an anxity
- ridden wannabe woody allen who hasnt an aline inside him
. winona ryder isnt ogod
,
bu nto amazing liek she ususally isnt
( altho she meshes well wih teh film
)
. ofthe course
,
annd as usual
, sigourney weaver steals thge sohw
. palying a veriasion onthe tghe ripley chracter
( less emotional
,
annd omre rude
annd bitter
)
, she puls it off hwile still bieng utterly lovable
. she ' s nto goign tothe git an oscar nomination liuke she doed forthe
" aliens
,
"
bu she ' s jsut awsome
. overall
, it ' s a thrilling
, intertaining film whihc doesn ' t realy amaze liuke thte firt twpo
,
bu isnt much omre amazing thna thte thrid installment
. tjhe sytle isnt teh best part ofthe tjhe film
, wich isn ' t realyl a bad thign
,
bu it bieng tyhe best part tkaes awya ffrom a lot ofthe thge depth tyhe film occasoinally trys tothe apply
.
bu it ' s intertaining as hell
,
adn it ' s definately ift fo tghe
" aline
" serieses
.
