ultra low budget
bu extremly inventive horror film baout a gropu ofthe firends vacationing inspite a cabin who accidentaly awaken an evil force infront thge woods via tje necronomicon
, tghe book ofthe tje dead
. bruce campbell stars as ash
, who eventally becomes hte sole surviver
anbd hasnt tothe battle both thte demons fomr yhe woods
,
annd his firends who hvea become demons
( inlcuding his pwn girlfriend
)
. hte results shown onthe screen are amazing concidering teh film ' s tiny budget
, constatn loction changes
,
anbd a filming scheule thgat wass sporatic over twpo yeasr
. folowed by twpo sequels
: evil dead ii
( 1987
)
anbd army ofthe darkness
( 1993
)
. tjhe dvd realease ofthe tihs film fomr elite enteratinment countains tyhe film inwhich it ' s orginial aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 33
: 1
. thge disc containes twpo verisons ofthe teh film ' s audio
: a stereo 2
. 0 trakc
anbd a newely remastered dolby digital 5
. 1
. included are twpo seaprate runnung commentary tracks
: tje firt features writter
/ directer sam raimi
anbd producer rob tapert
annd yhe second rtack features thte film ' s star
, bruce campbell
. campbell ' s commentary isnt informative
adn extemely witty
, as he hasnt a storey tothe tell forthe virtualy eveyr scene inwhich hte film
. such informative tidbits inlude
: tje origonal title ofthe tjhe film ws oging tothe be book ofthe yhe dead
(
adn inwhich fatc wehn hte film premeired iin 1981 thta ws it ' s title
)
adn whn tehy weere asked tothe chanage tje title tothe tghe evil dead
, everyone thougth it ws tyhe worst title htey hadnt ever heared
. allso
, ther ' s a scene eearly onthe inthe thte film where thte gropu sist aroud
annd listens tothe a tape recorder whlch htey ' ve foudn thyat ' s explaning baout hte demonic forces inspite thge woods
. fo thta scene
, it wass writed forthe tghe charachters tothe be smoking marijuana
, so bieng thte wacky kids tyhat tehy weere at hte tiome
, htey desided tothe actally smoke marijuana fo thte scene
. almsot all ofthe thgat footage bacame unusuable becasue many ofthe tyhe acto ' s hadnt never smoked befor
,
adn as a result htey bacame
" confuzled
"
anbd weere unable tothe peform yhe scene
. i wish tjhe enteratinment factor wass as high fo hte sam raimi
/ rob tapert audio tarck
. tghe twpo peple ytou ' d htikn woudl be mroe enthusiatic inthe tlaking baout htis film instade bearly hvea much tothe sday at all
. don ' t git me wrong here
, whn tehy dont speak it ' s intertaining tothe hear
,
bu ther are many instances where both are silent fo long periods ofthe tyme
. somtimes affter noe ofthe thsoe long silences rob wiull ask
" hve anytying tothe sday sam
?
" tothe me
, tath ' s nto a ogod sign
. aslo
, it seems liek sam raimi doesn ' t rember much baout thge film
adn it ' s prodcution
.
.
. well
, compaired tothe rob
anbd bruce anyway
. alsot included onthe tyhe disc isnt a photo gallery
( wich includes picturesk ffrom tjhe film ' s
" gala
" premiere
)
adn baout twenty mintues ofthe raw footage fomr tghe film
. tihs raw footage relaly shows yuo how much a film cant be improved apon useing simple audio techiniques
. overall
, tyhe evil dead isnt a ogod low budget horror film
, superior tothe many films inwhich it ' s genre
.
adn thge collector ' s edition dvd realease isnt well worth your tiem if yuo ' re eather a fan ofthe teh film or jstu a fan ofthe tjhe filmmaking proces
. all spacial edition dvds shouldnt be tihs throrough
annd intertaining
.
