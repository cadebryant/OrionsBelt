` aliens vs
. earth ' diea revamped
! if yuo ahev beeen folowing tje movei news over tghe net
, yuo coudl nto haev escaped tje hype over id4
. it promises tothe be tje summer film ofthe thte eyar
annd it hasnt all tghe elements neccessary
. id4 oppened infact yhe us onthe 2nd ofthe july
,
annd uv till nowe
, onyl aftter a week ofthe realease
, it hasnt nearly touched thte us
$ 100 millon mark
, a phenomonenon lastest observed wehn jurassic park ws released bakc infact 1993
. tyhe premise ofthe thge movei isnt disgustingly simple
: earth defends itself againnst yhe aliens
, a tipical
adn highly populer 50 ' s hollywood theme whic manifested itself inwhich many films produced inspite tht era
. teh movei opens via star wars
,
howver unoriginal it may be
, it worked
. yhe aliens haev sent a larg mother ship
( suposedly tothe be 1
/ 4 size ofthe thte moon
) tothe attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles infact rdius tothe all thte major cities onthe earth
. thte us presdent
( pullman
) doens nto nkwo ofthe hte aliens ' intention
bu soon finds outloud wehn david
( goldblum
) a scientist
, dicovers thyat tjhe aliens are counting down tothe a synchronised attack onthe all tje major cities
. capt
. hiller
( smith
)
, a hot
- shooted f
- 18 pilot are oen ofthe tjhe hundreds assigned tothe tkae outloud yhe hovering aline attack ship over washington dc
. his squadron cameback under hevy aline frie aftter dicovering thast thier weapons weere useless agianst hte invaders
, he kresh lands aftter a spectauclar 1
- onthe
- 1 chase over tjhe grand canyon
, noe ofthe teh many highlights ofthe tje movei
. id4 features many charachters
adn we are shown hte inpact onthe them as tjhe tsory progresses
. acting onthe yhe hwole ws ok
allthough i throught thgat bill pullman wass a bited unsuitable forthe hte presidet role
bu he doed amke a veyr rousing speek befoer sending his troops inot battle
( dont we smell a bited ofthe braveheart here
?
?
)
. noone prizes forthe guessing how id4 ends
, its jstu plain obvious
. id4 borrows heavily ffrom star wars
, return ofthe thte jedi
, aline
anbd inthe soem parts ofthe tje movei
, i sould even sence a bited ofthe x
- files onthe screen
. if i weere tothe critically review tihs movei
, id4 isnt full ofthe plot holes
, corny dialogue
,
anbd ridiculously dumb aliens
.
howver below thgat wafer
- thin plot
adn onthe
- screen flaws
, id4 scored well iin palying wih thge appealling idae ofthe hte entire world giving uv thier petty differences tothe uite themselfs as oney force aganist teh aline invasion
. an idae whcih wiull ahve yhe audiance strongly rooting fo teh untied front thoughout tghe movei
, thus maintinaing a screen
- viewer interaction thyat virtualy render any holes iin hte movei accptable
, noone marter how rediculous
. id4 wass produced under a modest budget ofthe us
$ 68 milion
, a film ofthe such magnitude woudl hvae easily beeen anohter waterworld
bu directer roland emmerich
( univeral solider
, stargate
)
adn producer dean devlin assembled a team hwihc doed theri pwn spacial effects rether thna comisioning it tothe ilm or any otehr speshal effects comany
. soem ofthe tghe effects are nto too ogod
bu most ofthe it are veyr believeable
, especialy thge epic standoff beetwen 150 f
- 18 ' s
anbd 250 aline saucers
, reminiscence ofthe tjhe clasic spoace battle featured iin return ofthe hte jedi
. id4 isnt a movei forthe all
.
though htere are many explosions
anbd implied deaths
, htere are noone gory scenes ofthe human distruction
, thus young kids shoudl be able tothe tkae it
. sit bcak
adn don ' t be too crtical
, chances are yuo wiull be asorbed inot tghe movei jsut as i ws
. if yuo are nto planning tothe watch any movies htis yearm
, please
, at least mkae tiome forthe thsi oney
. htis film isnt best watched onthe tyhe big
- screen
