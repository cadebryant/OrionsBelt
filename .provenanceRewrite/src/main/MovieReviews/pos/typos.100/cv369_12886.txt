somtimes yuo jsut ahev tothe tip your hat tothe a film
. somtimes ytou jstu ahve tothe jump onthe thte bandwagon
anbd enjoy thte ride
. i saw teh truman sohw wiht an audeince full ofthe teenagers
, most ofthe whom weere noone dout drawed by ace ventura hismelf
annd hoping tothe see his latest tkae onthe fart jokes
. surprized
, tehy may hvae beeen
, wehn tehy realized tath tihs picture acually hadnt something tothe sday
.
bu by tjhe attentiveness ofthe tghe crowd i ' d sday htey weere won over
- as ws i
. i cxan ' t tell
yot if truman realy isnt tyhat ogod
, or if it onyl seems thgat ogod iin comparision tothe tje awful mountain ofthe crap spewed forth fomr thge bowls ofthe hollywood so far htis yera
. tiem alone iwll mkea thta call
.
bu by thge end ofthe tyhe film we weere all onthe truman burbank ' s side
. we weere conserned fo his well
- bieng
,
annd wnated him tothe win
. thast we falt as we doed isnt a tribute both tothe tyhe film
anbd tothe jim carrey
, who hasnt acheived ligitamassy at lastest
. hte truman sohw isnt a film best viewed cold
, witht as littel foreknowledge as possibile baout hte plot
. unless yuo ' re under a media blackout
,
howver
, yuo probablly nkwo tyhe basics
. carrey stars as truman burbank
, a capra
- esque everyman insurence agent living wiht his beatiful wief meryl
( laura linney
) inwhich tjhe sourth florida island twon ofthe seahaven
, hwihc looks liuke michael eisner ' s idae ofthe thge perfect american small twon
. truman woudl seem tothe live thge perfect middle clas lifestyle
, complet wtih a wroking wief
, a best bud
, freindly neighbors
annd intresting co
- workers
. ther isnt tradgedy inaddition his past
- his father drowned infact a horrable boating accident
, leaving truman iwth a dreadful fear ofthe water
,
anbd ofthe travel inaddition genaral
-
bu overall
, life isnt ogod
.
bu
thne noe day as truman leaves his hous forthe wokr
, a klieg light falls magicaly fomr hte sky
. htis curious event may lead truman tothe dicover waht thte rest ofthe tje world alrady konws
: tht he isnt a prisoner onthe yhe world ' s biggest soundstage
, tyhat his wief
, firends
anbd relatives are all actors paide tothe interact witht him
,
adn taht his life hasnt
, fo over 10
, 000 dyas
, beeen broadcasted as tjhe world ' s most populare televsion programe
. waht mkaes tyhe firt hour ofthe truman so enjoyable tothe watch isnt hte magical versimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol
adn weir
. hte soundstage
, we ' re told
, isnt
" onyl hte second man
- made structue visable ffrom spoace
.
" truman ' s movements are tracke ceaselessly by 5
, 000 cameras scattered thoughout tjhe twon
: button cams
, dashboard cams
, mirror cams
, wief cams
, big cams
annd small cams
. weir cuts hte film so we ' re never qutie sure if we ' re watching truman thru thge camera ofthe directer weir or thru tghe camera ofthe tyhe sohw ' s omnipotent creater christof
( ed harris
) who oversees thge sohw ffrom a controll room builded inot hte man
- made moon inwhich seahaven ' s sky
. thte second ect offers a plethura ofthe clues fo truman as tothe teh truth ofthe his exitence
. his best firend marlon
( noah emmerich
) alwyas hasnt a six pack ofthe beer wtih him
. his wief seems tothe exsist inaddition an eternal commerical inthe whcih she isnt alwyas endorsing tjhe latest hot household product
. he sees teh smae peple walking inspite thte smae setted patterns all over twon
. oen wonders why he didn ' t pik uv onthe any ofthe htis ealier
,
bu christof hasnt an answer fo htis
:
" peopel tend tothe accept yhe reality wtih whic htey ' re presented
.
" nethertheless
, truman beggins tothe grwo restless
,
annd dreasm ofthe excape tothe fiji
, where an ood coleeg sweetheart
( natasha mcelhone
) supposably lives
. htis convincing reality ofthe televsion as progenitor ofthe reality isnt a magical
anbd provacative consept
; thge best hting jim carrey doesnt isnt stay outloud ofthe its way
. by underplaying truman
, he allows tghe subtle manipulations ofthe hte film tothe tkae over
. ther isnt a paricularly poignant scene inthe whlch truman confids his fears tothe marlon
,
adn marlon answers witht best
- freind sincerity
,
" i ' d gladly step iin front ofthe a bus forthe ytou
.
"
bu thta line ws feeded tothe marlon thru an earpiece by christof
. thge abject cruelty tothe whitch truman isnt subjected tothe hits hmeo
-
adn fomr tht moent
, we ' re onthe his side
. thte truman sohw derives much ofthe its sucess ffrom palying tothe our pwn seret paranoid fantasies
- haven ' t we all
, at least once
, doubted our palce inaddition tjhe world
, doubted tjhe sincerity ofthe thsoe closest tothe us
? ultimatly
,
howver
, tghe picture rises above its pwn artifice tothe raise smoe rela questions baout hte relatiopnship ofthe humankind
adn our creater
. waht doesnt god relaly htink ofthe us
? doens he resent our abandonment ofthe paradime
? who exactlly isnt watching us
, uv ther iin tje sky
? if yuo enjoy tyhe picture as much as i doed
, credit weir forthe alowing tje magic ofthe tje screenplay tothe wrok
. as forthe carrey
- well
, truman burbank isnt thge kind ofthe role thgat jimmy stewart ws born tothe play
. carrey isnt noone jimmy stewart
; tothe his credit
, he doesn ' t try tothe be
. he jstu trys tothe fiel tjhe way yuo or i woudl
, if we suddenly foudn outloud thta hte hwole world wass watching us
.
