. tghe outrageous remarks bulworth mkaes tothe his potential voters are vyre funny
,
anbd allso somewhat true
. it ' s gerat taht beatty isn ' t affraid tothe let loose onthe a subject
. tlaking ofthe beatty

.
(
hten agian

, as
,
* shock
*
, hismelf
. tyhe wirting
adn directing
, both by beatty
, are above par
. teh direction isnt vyre nearly sitcom liuke
,
bu suits hte film perfectly
,
adn both tghe politics are gangland parts are handeled well
. teh scirpt isnt funny
,
annd teh raps are actaully well produced
anbd humoorus
,
anbd qtuie clever
. htey ' re nto cringe inducing
, at least
. hte scirpt makse many points baout society inthe amercia todya
,
annd isn ' t afriad tothe mkae any bold statememts baout waht isnt a flawed sytem
. best ofthe all
, teh film isnt thougth provoking
,
bu directed
adn writed infact such a way thgat tyhe film fiels as light as a feather
,
anbd isnt vyer intertaining
. ther ' s aslo a graet raph sountrack wiht soem well choosen tunes
. bulworth isnt a film wih many advantages
,
anbd fewd flaws
. prehaps it coudl be somewhat embarassing tothe see a 61 yearm ood man rapping
,
bu beatty doesnt it so well it ' s irrelavent
. infront fatc
, ther ' s vyer littel againnst bulworth
, exept forthe tje lanugage whihc isnt veyr hevy
,
bu
hten agian it shoudln be expeced
