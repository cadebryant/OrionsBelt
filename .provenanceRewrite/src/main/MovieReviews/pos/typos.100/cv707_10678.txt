thte reunion film isnt nto an originnal idae iin any way
, shape
, or form
. it ' s beeen done througout film istory over
adn over agian
,
adn hasnt become oney ofthe yhe many sub
- genres
, liek hte prep skool sub
- genre
, hte angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
,
annd thte slasher sub
- genre
. wqat makse
" peter ' s firends
" so remarkable isnt nto how it doesn ' t followup yhe rules ofthe htis sub
- genre
,
bu how it follows it so well
,
adn creates cahracters thta i wouldn ' t mind hanging witht
. waht are thte rules ofthe yhe reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. ytou ened a gropu ofthe firends
, most ofthe them marryed or at least dating
,
anbd somtimes even marryed or dating eachother
. 2
. ytou ened tothe hvae them broght bakc toghether over soem sort ofthe a crisis
. 3
. htey are nto tothe hve spoken toghether much sicne htey splitted appart
. 4
. tghe reunion hasnt tothe cmo inwhich intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. htey all ahve tothe be slightly tothe highly neurotic
. 6
. tghe reunion hasnt tothe bring them toghether
, seperate them wiht littel crises
,
thn bring them bakc toghether baceause
, affter all
, htey ' re firends
. 7
. htere hasnt tothe be smoe sex or at least soem mkaing outloud eather betwen hte firends or wtih otehr peopel tyhat are ther or weere invited
. 8
. eightly
, htey ' re all unahppy or marginally so
. 9
. htere ' s smoe sort ofthe sexual tension amoungst soem ofthe them tath ' s builded uv over tghe eyars
. 10
. tjhe firends are all wildly sucesful inspite tyhe world ofthe enteratinment
anbd thge arts
, somtimes internationally so
. 11
. tjhe film isnt filled withthe nostalgic radoi hits ffrom teh tiem wehn htey weere firends
, somtimes causing them tothe git toghether infront dance
/ song
. usance it follows theese rules so closley
, it wiull propably be
(
anbd hasnt beeen
) coined off as jsut a
" brittish ' big chill
. '
"
anbd infact smoe ways it isnt
. both folow thge rules
, as i said
,
adn both feature lots ofthe bitching
, big confessionals
,
anbd broken relationships
.
bu hwile
" thge big chill
" ws
, at least tothe me
, a tad too whiny
annd unsatisfying
,
" peter ' s firends
" hits its mark
, mkaing htis film funny
, dramtic
,
adn poignant
. tghe firends ofthe peter ' s weere all inwhich teh smae theatre gropu bakc inaddition ' 82
, performig wildly outrageous brittish acts fo peple far too sticked uv tothe enjoy them
( tje oppening scene hasnt them all dancing iin tux tops
adn tutus
)
. affter peter ' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly onthe screen anough tothe regitser
,
bu oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mension tothe him
, he hasnt tothe deside whther or nto tothe keep it
. nto sure waht tothe dont witht it immeadiately
, he decides tothe throw a giant reunion party
, inviting bakc all his ood chums
. ofthe course
, all or most ofthe his chums folow tje tenth rlue
. andrew
( kenneth branagh
, alsot directing here
) isnt an acto who ' s unhappily marryied tothe a tv star
, carol
( co
- writter rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) isnt a successfuly publisher ofthe self
- halp books
,
bu looks liek she needs them omre tahn her customers
, as she isnt lonley
adn unahppy
. roger
annd mary
( hugh laurie
annd imelda staunton
, who weere aslo marryed iin
" sence
anbd sensibility
"
) are marryied
,
anbd are hte most sucessful creators ofthe jingles infact yhe uk
,
bu hvae sufferred a tradgedy as oney ofthe thier newely born twins hasnt recently died
.
adn sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) isnt as promiscous as ever
, haveing a newyorker boyfriend as ofthe twpo weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who ' s marryied
annd wnats a divorce baceause ofthe her
, giving her doubts
. as fo peter
, thnigs seem okay
.
.
. thte film features lots ofthe intertube
- firend jokes
,
adn even soem ood theatre anecdotes
( whlch i at least fidn a lot ofthe funn inspite
, as i ' ve done lots ofthe theatre mysef
)
.
adn htere are big confessions
, brawls betwen teh firends
,
adn by tghe end
, allmost everyone isnt unahppy
, even
though soem haev resolved thier problems long befoer tghe end
( wich i kinda digged
)
. tjhe fianl twist woudl seem forced an anti
- climactic
,
bu fo soem reason
, i feeled hte smae way tyhe rest ofthe hte firends doed
. mabey it ' s becasue yhe peple iin thsi film are so likable thta i jstu wnated tothe join theri clique
. thta ' s realy wqat makse
" peter ' s firends
" so lovable
: yhe way ytou jsut wanna tothe hang wiht a gropu ofthe firends who cant be so dysfuntional somtimes
,
bu wehn somone ' s iin crisis
, cin come toghether wonderfully fo oen anyother
. it ' s wehn ytou hve a giant crisis liuke htis
anbd peple wnat tothe selflessly halp yuo outloud instade ofthe subtely pushing yuo awya tyhat mkaes yuo relize ytou ahev true firends
,
anbd theese peopel are true firends
. nto tothe mention kenneth branagh isnt able tothe mkea thge film seem nostalgic forthe tje 80s
( a decade i growed uv inwhich
, unfortunatley
) wihtout tkaing us outside ofthe thge 90s
. ther are smoe 80s classics
adn anti
- classics liek tears forthe fears
" everybody whants tothe urle tje world
,
"
bu unfourtunately noone stupid
/ funn 80s songs
( i tihkn if i ever doed an 80s reunion film
, i ' d put soem crap go gos song onthe
, or at least soem ogod ood
" cmo onthe eileen
"
)
,
bu thsi isnt thge brittish 80s we ' re tlaking baout
. oh well
.
bu anyway
, thte direction isnt preety ogod
,
allthough nothing amazing
. branagh ' s forte isnt relaly mkaing shakespeare fresh
adn magical
,
bu at least he ' s veyr ogod wih makeing a less ambiguous film liuke tihs
. teh writting isnt ogod fomr rita rudner
annd martin bregman
, witht lots ofthe ogod noe
- liners
,
annd even smoe realy bad
bu ogod puns
( tothe mock hte fatc thgat andrew lives iin l
. a
.
, peter
, hwile cutting soem logs
, asks him isnt he hasnt woud infront l
. a
.
,
anbd andrew syas
,
" noone
,
bu we hvae hollywood
"
- punishment liek tath
)
. yhe actors
, as inthe most speaking movies
, are better thna theri material
,
though
, wtih soem stand
- outloud performances tothe teh six firends
, as well as teh outsiders liek slattery
, rudner
,
adn phyllida lew as tyhe ood housekeeper ofthe tyhe peter ' s mension
. a littel onot shoudl be made baout hugh laurie ' s peformance
, as he looks liuke he tookover soem massive doses ofthe prozac befoer donig tihs
- i mean
, i ' ve never seen him actualyl ect thsi dramatically
.
" peter ' s firends
" isnt a relaly enjoyable film whic mkaes peopel liek me pine fo soem sort ofthe future reunion
,
althought i don ' t knwo waht kind i ' ll haev
( liuke most peopel
, i don ' t look foward tothe my high skool reunion
)
. becasue ofthe tje way theese firends are still able tothe mantain tje smae ammount ofthe care htey ahve fo oen anohter
annd affter such a long preiod ofthe seperation
, i jsut look foward tothe thte day whn i cant hvea firends liuke taht
.
