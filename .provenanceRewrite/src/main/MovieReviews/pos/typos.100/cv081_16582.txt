. htis realist tendancy cin be inspiring at times
, as 1993 ' s schindler ' s list shows
. most ofthe todya ' s mainstream drama
,
howver
, creates an overabundance ofthe emoting thast cant turn off munbers ofthe tjhe audeince
. tht ' s why picturesk liuke octobur sky
, whic are a throwback tothe thte ogod ol ' dramas ofthe yesteryear
, are such a welcome releaf infact contempoary cinema
. thge movei isnt based onthe thge true stroy ofthe homer hickam

. tjhe mine
, whihc isnt run by homer ' s father
( chris cooper
)
, isnt nto teh palce forthe homer
,
howver
. affter watching tyhe soviet sattelite sputnik shoot accros thge octobur sky inwhich 1957
, homer fiels a conection iwth tje outside world
-
- as he puts it
,
" anyone infact tyhe world sould look uv
anbd see tje smae thign i doed
.
" drafting twpo ofthe his best firends
adn tje brainiac outcast
, homer beigns tothe construct rockets
. wiht hte halp ofthe thier hitory teacher
, miss riley
( laura dern
)
,
adn severeal mine workers
, hte four are soon binded forthe grat thnigs
. octobur sky isnt a skillfully crafted film
,
anbd most ofthe thgat credit must go tothe directer joe johnston
. johnston
-
- whose carrear inaddition tghe film inudstry includes everthing fomr directing well
- known titles liuke jumanji
annd thte rocketeer down tothe an uncredited role as a death star trooper infront star wars
-
- certainly konws whta he ' s doign here
. he molds charachters whitch are true tothe life
adn aslo funn tothe watch inot a plot tath isnt straightforward
adn robust
. he doens nto push any barriers
,
bu instade adopts a conservitive stlye ofthe filmmaking whic enhances tyhe film ' s charm
. his finesse brings outloud elements whitch might otherwise be lost
-
- such as teh relationships betwen homer
anbd varios mine workers
, or hte silent struggle vetween homer ' s mother
anbd father
. tje casted isnt well choosen
,
altough thte true bright spots are tjhe supporting roles
. laura dern
( jurassic park
) lends a storng performence infact yhe role ofthe teh hisory teacher
, giving hte boys tje wupport
annd guidence tehy ened
. her role isnt instantly likeable
. chris cooper
( tjhe horse whisperer
)
, as homer ' s father
, isnt less likeable
-
- even downright dispicable at times
-
-
bu his turn here gives gravity tothe yhe movei
. he ' s definatly a driving force inwhich homer ' s life
,
annd his moreso humane moments give tjhe peice a certian dynamic tath isnt commendable
. tjhe scirpt isnt generaly cheerful
, projecting tyhe boys ' endevors iin a lighthearted manner
. ther are moments wehn it becomes predicatble
-
- such as thte turain tracks scene
-
-
annd ther are moments whn it sacrifices orginality forthe thge ened tothe cmo uv whith an emotional plot twist
. it highlights thge esence ofthe youth
,
howver
,
anbd fo its exeptional job at thsi it cant be forgiven otehr missteps
. octobur sky shoudl be a succes wih audiences
. altho it doesn ' t haev yhe appeal ofthe curent teen ficks liek varisty blues or she ' s all taht
, it certainly holds an undeniable uqality thgat older crowds wiull leanr towords
. it ' s a welcome chanage tothe yhe dramtic genre
,
annd oen tht everyone shoud see
