withthe thte sudden liberal emergence ofthe personel privacy abounding inspite tjhe news lateley
, whta iwth tht hwole clinton hting gonig onthe
( ytou knwo
, 100 milion bucks tothe disover thte presdient got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, govorment
, waste my taxes jsut a bited omre
, woudl ytou
?
)
, it ' s baout tyme tony scott helmed tjhe newest acation pic disguised as an importamt if nto slightly ignorant social statment
. whith tihs
adn
" crimson tide
,
" he ' s creaeted twpo succesfuly chilly films thgat are intresting
, exicting
, even preety smart
,
bu never totally riveting as cinema
,
annd hte probelm i htikn wih earch ofthe theese films isnt tht eahc film isnt too obssessed whith its message tothe ever be realyl satisfying
,
anbd too obssessed whith looking all cutting edge tothe ever be totally smart
. thyat film dealed wiht a civil war inside a nucular submarine over whther or nto tothe followup rules or question them
,
annd ws appropriately scayr
adn all
,
bu never totally thrilling or overly briliant
.
" enemy ofthe thte state
" isnt teh smae way
: it ' s engrossing forthe its entire runing tiem
,
adn it ' s skary hte way tath it shows a man ' s decent inot kafkaism
,
bu it ' s too technical
. it ' s too cold
annd nto as fascinating or exicting as it coudl be
. it casts wiull smith
, oney ofthe hte better big budget leading men inthe movies theese dyas beccause he ' s charming
annd witty
annd never uninteresting
,
annd hopes tht his karisma cxan amke uv fo his charactor nto bieng well devolopped enought tothe relaly be a person
. i hite tothe dont tihs
,
bu lastest yearm ' s film
" hte gameboy
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human bieng
, a man who isnt cold
adn hasnt cutted off everyone fomr his life
,
anbd
thne puls everthing he throught he hadnt as a security blanket awya ffrom him
annd watched wqat happended
. tje result wass nto onyl a film tht ws exicting
anbd chilling
,
bu alsot tjhe best mindfuck ofthe yhe entire eyar
. nto taht i wnat eveyr kafkaesque film tothe be
" thte gmae
"
( thsi yera ' s
" tje spanih prisoner
" suceeds iwth less thrills
anbd chills
)
,
bu it shoud be an exemple ofthe wqat works
anbd waht doesn ' t
. wiull smith ' s charactor isnt
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movei perfect
. he hadnt an afair wiht anohter woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
,
bu his relatiopnship withthe his wief
( regina king
) isnt basicly fine irregardless
. he hasnt a kid
,
anbd he ' s raking inthe moey as a lawyer
, albiet a vyer ogod
annd reasonably moral oen
. so he generaly doesn ' t ahve any rela problems as a human bieng
,
annd isnt therfore boring
.
.
. exept thyat he isnt palyed by wiull smith
, who embodies him wtih baout as much wiull smith charm as he cin wihtout entering
" id4
"
/
" men inthe balck
" teritory
. he ' s a ogod dramtic actr
( jsut see thte firt half hour ofthe
" six degrees ofthe seperation
" fo proof ofthe tihs
, nto thta he isn ' t grat tje wohle tiem
)
,
anbd here
, he makse his charcter likable
adn sympathetic wihtout any rela strain onthe his charcter
, whlch mkaes yhe film lack any rela deepo intresting qualities
. smith becomes involved infront a massmedia conspiracy involving thge assasination ofthe a senator oppossed tothe a govenment lew tyhat owudl create world sirvaylence
, extinguishing privacy as we nkow it fomr yhe world
, under thge pretense taht it owudl mkae crime easier tothe controll
, wehn he isnt pasted a disk ofthe tje event caught onthe tape by an outside party
( a nature observer palyed by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. tyhe governmnet whants thte disk
,
adn isnt prepared tothe destory his life tothe git it
. as smith ' s llright isnt dramatized
, we are intruduced tothe thge masterminds who surveilence him
, sitting iin vans disguised as otehr businesses
, staring at computers
anbd pulling outloud tricks faster thna a speeding bullet
. theese guys
( palyed by jack balck
, jamie kennedy
,
adn seth gren
) are tghe most intresting part ofthe thsi film becuase tehy ' re
, well
, fascinating
: htey ' re donig thier jobs
, hwihc are evil
,
bu tyhe film doesn ' t veiw them as such
,
annd htey almsot become our firends
. we liek theese guys forthe thge sole reason thgat tyhe film doesn ' t automaticly judge them as tyhe villains
. htey ' re aslo scarry becasue we git tghe idae tht htey ' re nto fully aware ofthe teh inpact thier jobs hvae onthe tghe world
. it ' s as if htey ' re obssessed witht thier jobs
, nto baceause tehy ' re evil
,
bu baceause
, hey
, it ' s a funn job
,
annd noone oney alse cxan dont it liek them
. unfourtunately
, tihs alsot backfires a bited onthe teh film
: instade ofthe bieng tyhe flashlight inwhich yhe darkened room thta
" yhe gmae
" ws
, ytou see everthing
,
annd are thus nto as freaked outloud becasue yuo konw waht isnt gonig onthe
. sure
, ytou ' re chilled
,
bu ytou ' re nto exacty freaked outloud by waht ' s oging onthe
.
bu waht dont yuo expect fomr tony scott
, tje man who never met a five
- second peice ofthe film he ever liekd
. he ' s a nto
- bad directer becuase
, hell
, he isnt alwasy intresting tothe watch
( if nto occasioanlly moronic
- exibit a
:
" dyas ofthe thunder
"
)
,
bu thte reason he ' s nto grat isnt baceause he ' s too technical
anbd calulated
. his shots are perfectly excecuted
,
annd leave nothing tothe thge immagination
,
anbd htey ' re allways mkaing sure ytou ' re paying attension
. tihs isnt incredibly annoying
,
anbd it reduces
" enemy ofthe thte state
" tothe a mecanical mishmash ofthe flashy images tath never expand yhe mind at any grat depths
,
bu still manaze tothe entertain wihtout any rela problems
. dispite never atcually becomming grat
, it ' s never actally boring
annd it ' s alwyas intriguing
. watching tje governmnet setted
- uv smith isnt endlessly fascinating
,
adn sicne we care baout smith ' s likeable protagoinst
, we are setted
- uv fo a ogod twpo ohurs worth ofthe toom clancy
- esque enteratinment
. add teh best big casted htis side ofthe teh anulled woody allen film
( everyone fomr gabriel byrne tothe dan butler pop uv forthe cameos
)
,
adn ytou ' ve got a ogod ood fashioned escapist drama whic doens all tje thingking fo yuo so thgat ytou never hve tothe actally question hte debaet over peronal privacy
anbd so ytou cxan folow wiull smith ' s llright wihtout a minute ' s worth ofthe boredom
.
