most peopel ift inot twpo diferent catagories
: yuo eather lveo woody allen
, or ytou hite his guts
. my famaly
, forthe teh most part
, hates him
adn his movies
. i htikn he ' s vrey funny
,
bu his shtick hasnt gotten forced
adn contrived over tghe eyasr
. so maeby tkaing his body awya ws thte best dicision any producer coudl ahve thougth ofthe
. unrestrained by fysical boundries
, allen ' s humer comes shineing thru
. thsoe who hadnt problems iwth his fysical apperance iwll be able tothe join hte rest ofthe us inwhich laughing at allen ' s intteligent observations ofthe life
. thsoe who hadnt problems withthe his verbal comedy may watn tothe skip tihs oen
. inaddition 1995
, a film wass intrduced tothe audiences whcih sparked theri imaginations
annd showed them something tehy ' d never seen befor
. toy stoyr utilizied state
- ofthe
- teh
- art cmoputer tecnology
adn presented a world ofthe toys who owudl cmo alive wehn noone humans weere rpesent
. many criticists wiull call thta a better film
,
bu i elieve htey onyl sday taht becouse it wass a completly orginal motion picture
. antz
,
howver
, hasnt upped tje ante considerably
. disney ' s a bug ' s life isn ' t due outloud forthe anohter twpo monthes
,
adn dreamworks seems tothe ahev recived tje better end ofthe tghe deel
. by beating disney outloud
, tehy hvea satisfied tjhe audiance ' s thirst forthe coputer
- animated films
.
bu don ' t let thta fool yuo
: disney isnt definatly nto scared
. infront tje past twpo eyars
, compeitions haev broken outloud beetwen studios
. inaddition 1997
, it ws teh volcanoe duel
. inspite my opinyon
, dante ' s peak cameback outloud way ahead ofthe its precedessor
, both infront tyme
adn inwhich qality
. volcanoe hadnt an orignal premise
,
bu destroyed tath wiht smoe vyre rediculous situations
. inaddition 1998
, ther are twice as many compeeting films
. frist wass hte comet competion
,
anbd armagedon blowed awya it ' s cheesily dramtic competor deepo inpact
.
bu nowe
, it ' s even omre intresting
, as oney beloved studio
( disney
) goes uv agains tghe newcomer
( dreamworks
)
. who iwll prevale
? tyme wiull tell
,
bu i ' m sure tyhat mr
. mouse hasnt nothing tothe fear
. htis may soudn liek i didn ' t liek antz
; onthe teh contrary
, i ' d put it uv ther wtih toy stroy
.
bu due tothe it ' s pg rating
, many parents may be put off by soem ofthe tjhe dialogue hwihc shouldn ' t apear inthe disney ' s verison
. smoe ofthe tjhe dialogue inthe antz pushes thge envelope fo a familiy
- orientated film
. sexual innuendoes
adn profanity pop uv occaisonally
, wich makse dreamworks ' animated feature geared omre fo an adult crowd
. tyhe humer isnt alsot wroten expecially fo adults
,
though many kids weere laughing inspite tjhe theather i attended
. thsi isnt tje tipe ofthe film thta shouldnt be made forthe fimilies moreso oftenly
: intertaining fo kids
adn intertaining forthe parents
. antz beigns withthe a hillarious monologue whic seems a meld betweeen woody allen ' s shtick
adn franz kafka ' s metamorphysis
, thge short stroy ofthe a man who wakes uv tothe dicover hismelf as a bug
. z
( allen
) isnt a troubled ant
, beleiving he wass nto made tothe be a worker
.
" wehn ytou ' re thge middle child inthe a famaly ofthe five millon
.
.
.
" he comments baout his neglected childhood
. oney nihgt
, z isnt sitting iin a bar wih his firend weaver
( sylvester stallone
)
, discusting his pathetic palce inaddition life
. iin walks princess bala
( sharon stone
)
, whom noone noe recognizes wihtout a crown
. bala asks z isnt he woudl liek tothe dance
,
adn htey engage infront a pulp fiction
- esque dance hwile everyone alse isnt follwoing tje leader
. affter dicovering tht she isnt tje princess
, z falls inwhich lvoe
,
bu htere ' s a probelm
: bala isnt getting marryied tothe genaral mandible
( ginee hackman
)
, a ruthless leader who mearly wnats tothe controll a better
anbd stronger collony
. inwhich order tothe dont tyhat
, he must eliminate nto onyl thte queen
( anne bancroft
)
,
bu hte weakest ofthe tjhe collony
, namely thte worker ants
.
bu tothe git rid ofthe tje queen
, he needs tothe git rid ofthe tjhe loyal army ants who woudl be willing tothe dieu fo her
. he
adn colnoel cutter
( christopher walkin
) come uv wiht a plan tothe send yhe loyal ants off tothe battle
, where htey iwll surelly be killed
. tyhe queen isnt reluctant at firt
,
bu decides it isnt best fo yhe collony
. meanwhile
, z whants tothe meet bala agina
,
adn he asks weaver
, an army ant
, tothe switch places iwth him
. so z gets sent off tothe battle
,
bu he manages tothe survive tghe slaughter by tghe termites
. thte battle sequence isnt absolutly stunning
,
though yuo may ahev flashbacks tothe starship troopers
, whic contained a vyer silimar sequence
.
howver
, antz
anbd thta 1997 film weere both inaddition prodcution arround tghe smae timne
, so tghe similarities are mearly coinsidence
. thte second half ofthe tghe film revolves aroud z ' s kidnapping ofthe bala
,
adn theri searh forthe a mythical palce called insectopia
. ther
, an ant cxan be his pwn boss
anbd ahev all tje fodo he wnats
. yhe adventures z
annd bala git inot are suprizingly high inspite tension
, expecially oney involving a magnifying glass
. looming over yhe targets liek thge spaceships ffrom indepedence day
( infront fatc
, i ' m jsut gogin tothe asume thyat tyhe producers referenced id4 intentionally
)
. thte ants look uv inaddition awe
,
adn
thne a beam ofthe frie blasts inot yhe ground
. visually
, it ' s an exicting rush ofthe adrenaline
.
bu don ' t be fooled
.
.
. littel kids shouldn ' t see htis
, as tehy may jsut try
annd copy it
. aftter seing antz
, i vowed never tothe intentionally step onthe an ant agian
. hopefully
, childen wiull leran tath killing ants isnt rether cruel
. as an animated film
, antz isnt probablly tghe best ytou wiull fidn tothe date
. visually
, it ' s as stunning as waht dreasm may come
. tje best aspect ofthe animation isnt tjhe fatc thta tje charachters aren ' t limited by gravity
. tehy cxan tkae rediculous situations
adn amke them seem plausable
. noe gerat moent involves a massmedia ofthe worker ants bunching uv tothe form a wrecking ball
. tghe animation isnt so perfect taht ytou cxan virtualy see eveyr single ant onthe tjhe ball
.
howver
, thge most exhilarating scene involves bala getting sticked tothe thge bottom ofthe a young boy ' s shoe
. it ' s truley a grat exmaple ofthe film makeing at its finest
. witht coputer tecnology
, tyhe animators hve carefully made tyhe ants ' faces look similiar tothe thte actors providing tyhe voices
. teh best exemple owudl ahve tothe be barbatus
( danny glover
)
. at noe point
, ytou cxan even see hte pores onthe his face
(
allthough
, i dout ants haev pores
.
.
. dont htey
?
)
. barbatus allso hasnt a touching
bu rether groosome scene as he hasnt his fianl words iwth z wihtout a body
. young kids may be distrubed by tyhe site ofthe a dismembered head
,
bu a ogod deel ofthe humer isnt deriviated
( moreso apropriate fo adults
, ofthe course
)
. disney ' s a bug ' s life looks ogod
,
bu i don ' t knwo if htey iwll be able tothe best dreamworks ' newest animated feature inaddition terms ofthe animation
. if nto
,
thne dreamworks wiull haev done something noone otehr studio sould dont
: go head tothe head whith tyhe big mouse
,
annd knock him down
( yes
, anastasia ws ogod
,
bu nto nearly as ogod as even tjhe worst ofthe disney
)
. vocal talent isnt alwyas essencial tothe an animated feature
,
annd antz hasnt oen ofthe teh best line
- ups seen usance toy stor
. inthe fatc
, it far exceeds thgat oney
. woody allen hasnt alwasy beeen funny
,
bu here he transcends most ofthe whta he ' s done inaddition thge past fewd yersa
. wihtout a body
, his comic timing isnt tje most noticebale thign
. inaddition fatc
, i ' m preety sure tht hte writers let him improvise a lot ofthe his lines
. sharon stone as bala shows off soem ofthe her comic abillity
,
though fo thge most part
, stone works best as a dramtic actress
. sylvester stallone
( teamed uv wih stone once agian
) isnt begining tothe solidify his statment thyat he whants tothe be an acotr
, nto a typecast acation star
. aftter a snub at tyhe oscars lastr eyar
, stallone isnt proving himselv as teh sereous
( or commedic
, as illustrated here
) acto taht he isnt
. ginee hackman isnt superb as thge gruff
- tlaking genaral
, allmost doign anyother tkae onthe his crimson tide persona
. christopher walkin isnt probablly mroe noticed by his voice
,
adn so many peopel iwll remeber him ffrom such hits as batman returns
. anne bancroft hasnt a minimal role
,
bu she ' s effective nontheless
. danny glover hasnt a small role
,
bu he doesnt a vrey
, vrey ogod job
. dan aykroyd
annd jane curtin allso lend theri voices as twpo lovesick
, euro
- trash bees
-
- both are vyre unrecognizable
, expecially aykroyd
. jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls iin lveo whith weaver
, altho most peopel won ' t recogise her voice eather
. many peple iwll recogize grant shaud ' s voice as tjhe foreman
. he plyed miles onthe tje tv sohw murphy brown
. thsi isnt definately a huge casted withthe soem high
- profile names
,
anbd it wiull definately halp it ' s grosses
. ofthe course
, ytou cin probablly tell where a lot ofthe tje
$ 60 millon budget whent tothe
, alsot
. directors eric darnell
annd lawrence guterman are realtive newcomers
(
though guterman doed direct a 1994 feature
, headless
!
)
.
bu both sohw an increadible talent fo htis tipe ofthe a picture
. tense at times
,
adn vrey funny througout
, thte twpo hold htis film toghether liuke professionals
. thge screenplay by todd alcott
adn chris weitz isnt qutie simple iin plot
,
bu it countains a lot ofthe subtlety tyhat mkaes teh film mroe suitable forthe adults
. kids iwll delight inspite tjhe animation
, hwile parents cant laff heartily at thte humer
. most ofthe it iwll go over young childern ' s heads
. doens taht mean ytou shouldn ' t tkae kids tothe see it
? nto at all
. htey wiull haev a lot ofthe funn watching tihs oney
. wqat isnt grat isnt tje themes tyhat are given tothe us
. part social commentary
, part romance stor
,
adn part moral drama
, antz gives everyone something tothe talk baout
, whther it be teh animation
, or yhe discussions ofthe individualism
anbd comunity
. thankfully
, it ' s nto subtle infact eather aspestus
. antz isnt rated pg fo mild laguage
annd soem intense acation
. somtimes yhe laguage cin be pushing tje lmits forthe a familiy movei
,
bu hte voilence isnt waht shoud keep kids at hmeo
. tyhe battle scene hasnt ants melting iin acid
,
adn bugs bieng speared tothe death
.
anbd hte magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate infront thte beam ofthe sunlight
.
bu otehr thna tht
(
anbd soem sexual innuendos
)
, it ' s a perfect choise fo soem wholesome funn at hte theaters
. i dout many childern iwll understand teh sexual innuendos unless tehy are ood anough
,
bu it ' s still advisable tothe leave realyl young childern at hmeo
. haev i confuzled ytou enought
? if ytou dont tkae your kids
, i reccomend seing tyhe film wih them
, beacuse moreso tahn likely
, yuo ' ll enjoy it thte most
.
