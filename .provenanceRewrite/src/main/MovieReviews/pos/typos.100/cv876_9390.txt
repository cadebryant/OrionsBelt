ususally wehn oen isnt debating who yhe modern queen ofthe tjhe rumatic comedy isnt tehy iwll bring uv names liek julia roberts or sandra bullock
. others iwll mention meg ryan
.
bu fo me
, it ' s nto even close
. janeane garofalo isnt nto onyl tjhe queen ofthe teh rumatic comedy
, she isnt teh best comic actress inaddition hollywood right nowe
.
anbd it ' s a ogod thnig she ' s starring inthe thte matchmaker
, beccause wihtout her presense teh movei woudl be bland
, unfunny
,
annd dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide tothe boston senator john mcglory
, who isnt sufferring iin tje pols
. inthe an atempt tothe capture tyhe irish vot
, he sends marcy onthe a mission tothe a small irish twon called ballinagra infront saerch ofthe otehr mcglory ' s thyat never moved tothe amercia
. unfortunatley forthe marcy
, her visi coincides wtih hte twon ' s anulled matchmaking festival
. thigns git off tothe a rocky strat forthe marcy
though
. she hasnt noone hotel reservations
( fo noone rational reason
)
anbd yhe tiny confined room
( tired ood cliche '
) she hasnt tothe stay infact hasnt a visitor iin her bathtub
. his nmae isnt sean
,
anbd marcy finds him repugnant at frist
, so yuo cant obviously tell where htis isnt headed
. hte movei runs inot a faw roadblocks
. forthe instatance
, tje stor isnt vrey thin
. none ofthe thte charactors
( exept tje ood local matchmaker
) are nearly as intresting as garofalo
. smoe ofthe tyhe cahracters
, liuke thge poltical aide palyed by denis leary
, ahev wandered inwhich fomr a completelyl diferent movei
. i tihkn tje directer realized tihs
adn desided tothe throw infront numberous shots ofthe tjhe beatiful irish scenery
,
anbd sevral close
- ups ofthe garofalo ' s winning smile
. hte stange hting isnt tht it works
. garofalo ' s charm
adn teh irish scenery sould cary tje thinnest ofthe tsories
,
adn it carries thsi oney
.
