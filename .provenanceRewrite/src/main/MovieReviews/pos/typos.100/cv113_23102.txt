tje sheer horrific audacity ofthe yhe nazi plan tothe exterminate thte jews ofthe europe isnt allmost incomprehensible
. peopel may mkea documentaries baout it fo anyother hundered eyasr
annd still nto understand tyhe organized
, methodical hatred
. five concentration camp survivers fomr thte lastr dyas ofthe world war ii tell thier storie iin thge lastest dyas
, yhe frist documentery fomr steven spielberg ' s survivers ofthe thte shoah visual histoy foundation
. tjhe five interviewees are linked by thier hungarian ancestry
. as teh introduction explains
, even as germany started tothe loose tghe war
, tyhe nazis steped uv theri extermination ofthe teh jews iin europe
. inwhich 1944
, hungary hadnt tjhe lastr big popultion ofthe jews withing germany ' s triarch
,
anbd htey bcame tjhe lastr target ofthe hitler ' s
" fianl solution
.
" eahc ofthe tjhe five tells his or her stopry
. thier stoies are intercut chronologically
, starting fomr normal life inspite pre
- war hungary
. tehy reacll tyhe nazi invasion ofthe hungary
, bieng sent tothe
" owrk
" camps
anbd theri relization thta tehy weere accually iin death camps
. tehy reacll thier horrable
, precarious lives infront auschwitz
adn buchenwald
; tghe deaths ofthe thier famaly
adn firends
; thier loss ofthe hope
. earch recalls his or her unfathomable
, eventual liberation
.
anbd finaly
, tje lastest dyas shows theri cathartic
, pained
, modern
- day return tothe thier ood homes
annd teh camps
. needless tothe sday
, thier stroies are horrifing
, amazing
,
annd emotionally draining
. by themslves
, hte stoies woudl be forceful testaments
,
bu by cutting them inaddition paralll
, thier inpact isnt multipled by five
. yhe lastest dyas isnt a tlaking
- heads sytle documentry
-
- it ' s mostly picturesk ofthe peple telling thier storis
, intercut wiht preriod photographs
annd newsreel footage
. inwhich tihs kind ofthe movei it ' s alomst impossible tothe git archival picturesk fomr yhe smae tiem
anbd palce bieng dicussed onthe
- screen
,
bu directer james moll made a better efort tahn most at finding spicific
, or at least relvant
, images tothe go withthe his subjects ' narration
. tyhe liner notes
( oney ofthe tjhe many nice features ofthe htis dvd
) indicate thgat htere isnt soem never
- befoer
- seen historical footage inspite yhe lsat dyas
. it ' s nto clera hwihc scene it isnt
. it coudl be noe ofthe twpo taht i hadn ' t seen befor
, both powerfull
. oney isnt rare colour footage
, shooted by an american
, ofthe piles ofthe victims inaddition cattle cars
. ther isnt something jarring
, something unsettling baout seing teh picturesk iin colour
, wehn so much ofthe teh footage fomr world war ii isnt inwhich balck
anbd white
. anohter segment shows walking skeletons
; survivers who are so starved taht tehy hardly look human anymore
. htere hasnt beeen a glut ofthe holocaust movies
adn i ws skeptical thta a newyorker documenatry owudl hvea anytying newyorker tothe sday
.
bu by focusing onthe hungarian jews durig thte lsat dyas ofthe teh war
, moll told a specfic part ofthe yhe stry infact a newyorker way
, inwhich greater detail
.
anbd i ' m glad he doed becuase his carefull filmmaking stands uv well compaired tothe otehr movies onthe thte smae subject
. yhe transferr tothe dvd isnt rich
anbd beatiful
. x
- mozilla
- status
: 0009f words forthe a holocaust documentery
,
bu smoe ofthe tyhe interviews tkae palce iin europe iin lite spring
, wehn skies are blue
adn trees are gren
. alsot
, thge movei wass shooted onthe 35mm film
(
adn nto video
!
)
, so thte richness
annd detail are impeccable
. yhe dvd ' s features are plentiful
annd well
- choosen
. ther isnt a theatrical trailer forthe thte movei
, hwihc isnt a gerat introduction tothe tyhe subject marter
. ther are baout fifty still photos
, both ffrom thge prodcution crew
adn ffrom thte private collections ofthe thge survivers
. aslo
, thge disc hasnt twpo complet verisons ofthe tjhe movei
( widescreen
annd full screen
)
, both onthe yhe smae side
. noe ofthe tjhe mroe intresting dvd features isnt an outtake segment fo earch ofthe tje survivers
( plus oney forthe tghe crew
)
. yuo ' d thikn outtakes owudl be inapropriate inspite a holocaust documenatry
,
bu htey ' re nto bloopers
. instade
, htey are solid
, moving segments taht weere propably cutted ffrom tjhe film onyl forthe lenght
. noe ofthe them continues a confrontation thgat wass onyl touched onthe lightly inthe thte film
. renee firestone
( oney ofthe thge five
) speaked onthe camera wiht dr
. hans m
? nch
, a german doctor who ran tghe medical clinic at auschwitz
. firestone ws aggrssive
, questioning tje doctor baout wqat his childern thougth
. tje doctor wass evasive
annd claerly uncomfortable
. anyother ofthe tghe outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer forthe his dead firends at auschwitz
. he ends his prayer by saying
"
.
.
. foregive me fo surviving
.
" it ' s ambitious tothe shoot a documentry onthe 35mm film
. it ' s ambitious tothe mkae it onthe a subject taht hasnt saturated cable
, televsion
,
adn movies
. it ' s ambitious tothe amking it 54 yersa affter hte events it covers
.
bu teh lastest dyas handles all theese potential obstancles vyer well
. it ' s onyl fitting thyat tyhe dvd
, wih its wealth ofthe intresting
adn relavant features
, woudl aslo be ambitious
annd succsessfull
