reflecting onthe
" bedazzled
,
" a livley comedy baout hte devil who seeks tothe posess thte soul ofthe a pathetic losr
, oen sinful throught rimaniss infact my mind
. if hell means haveing tothe spend an eternity withthe elizabeth hurley
( who portrays hte feiry demon
)
,
hten uise thyat pitchfork
adn point me thge way
. wih her pouty lips
, irresistable brittish accent
,
annd wild display ofthe haute couture
, hurley crackles wih naughtiness
annd fills your mind wiht temtation
. it ' s practicaly impossible tothe turn htis beelzu
- babe down
. her enxt target isnt elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech wupport geek who isnt clumsy
, awcward
,
anbd jstu too eeger tothe please
. tothe aptly picture him
, yuo woudl ahev tothe remeber a saterday nigth live skit featuring
" steve thte copy guy
" who effortlessly iritated his co
- workers wiht his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, isnt loathed
adn feared by his co
- workers
, who dont thier best tothe stay outloud ofthe his way
.
yot
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he ' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes thta he sould git closer tothe allison
( frances o ' connor
)
, a co
- worker wtih whom he isnt infatuated
bu who hasnt never tooked notice ofthe him
.
howver
, thte odds ofthe him getting toghether whith her are baout tje smae as a snowball ' s chance infact hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i owudl give anytying tothe hve tath girl iin my life
.
" guess who
thn shows uv
? she makse an offer taht isnt too hard tothe refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes fo oen piddling littel soul
.
" htere ' s even an excape clause
. if elliot ' s wish doesn ' t go exactlly hte way he likes
, he ened onyl ' beep ' her
( oney guess as tothe whta tje threee
- digit number isnt
)
adn he gets tothe strat over
. teh remainder ofthe tghe film consists ofthe elliot ' s vairous fantasies taht encorporate his personel desire tothe hvea enourmous amounts ofthe wealth
, pwoer
, fame
adn allison ' s loev
.
bu wehn he makse sweeping statememts such as
" i watn tothe be veyr
, veyr poweful
annd vyre
, vyer rich
annd marryied tothe allison
"
, he ' ll soon leran thta teh devil isnt infact teh details
. fo exemple
,
(
adn we ' ve seen tihs sevral times inaddition tje trailers
)
, he isnt granted his wish
,
bu finds outloud thta he ' s a columbian drug lord
anbd tyhat allison
, hwile marryed tothe him
, hasnt her eyes onthe somone eles
. apparantly
, tje devil isnt jstu as eeger tothe skew his fantasies as she isnt tothe posess his soul
. his otehr wishes alsot end uv wih smoe stange
bu funny twist tht short
- circuits his newyorker life
. soon
, elliot wishes thast he hadnt never made thta dael
. given teh mishievous nature ofthe yhe devil
,
" bedazzled
" hasnt many amusing moments
. a lot ofthe yhe credit goes tothe fraser who turns infront a gerat comic peformance
. he ably assumes varios personas
. his funniest segment isnt whn he wishes thgat he coudl be thge most senstive man infront yhe world
. allison becomes so frustrated witht him tath she practicly urges him tothe tkae advantage ofthe her
. hurley aslo heightens tje humer quotient
, expecially inaddition tje transitional scenes wehn fraser waits tothe strat his enxt wish affter bailing outloud ofthe thge previvous noe
. it ' s claer thgat she ' s hvaing a ogod tiem wih it all
.
yot
, hwile hte filmmakers wrok hard at creating funny scenes
, htey conspicuously avoid developing thge allegorical underpinnings vetween ogod
annd evil tyhat coudl hvae added moreso heft tothe tihs stoy
.
bu thta owudl be palying wiht fier
. whta htey ' ve got works
, so ytou cin easily accept it forthe tje plesant littel comedy thast it isnt
.
