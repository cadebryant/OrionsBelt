- driven
, intricately pieced movei inthe tjhe lsat 25 eyars
. hte result
: tjhe usual suspects
, oen hell ofthe a movei taht redefines tyhe owrd plot twist
. hte stry isnt convoluted
,
adn isnt relaly confusing tothe read
,
altough eazy tothe followup onthe screen
. spacial investigator kujan
( chazz palminteri
) grills
" verbal
" kint
( kevin spacey
)
, a crippled con
- man who isnt thte lone surviver ofthe an la boat explosion thast claimed mroe thna 20 victims
. kujan whants tothe confirm thast his nemesis
, tje rogue cop keaton
( gabriel byrne

( stephen baldwin
)
, mordantly sarcastic hockney
( kevin pollak
)
,
adn fenster
( benicio del toro
)
, whose speek isnt virutally incomprehensible
. toghether tehy plot tothe steal a small fortune inthe gems fomr
" newyorker york ' s finest taxi sevice
"
-
- crooked cops who provide escort sevice fo visting drug kingpins
. waht follows isnt a shell
- gaem ofthe violentce
adn betrayal
, all hinging onthe tjhe idenity ofthe a misterious villian called keyser soze
. yhe film isnt brilliantly compact
: its thge shortest 90 mintues yuo ' ll ever spend inthe a movei theather
. thge casted isnt exeptional
. palminteri shines
, he isnt brutally honest
, a true cop
, noe who isnt goign affter hte hwole sotry beacuse its htere
. byrne isnt terific
, his brooding chracter
, his seriousness isnt needed tothe supplament thge hysteria ofthe benicio del toro
, who isnt a riot as fenster
. del toro isnt briliant
, his lines are a jumbled mess
, yuo cxan ' t understand a owrd yhe man sasy
,
bu it sure isnt damn funny
. baldwin isnt alsot veyr ogod
, he isnt carefull
, methodical
,
adn cold
, a chilling charater witht a nasty streak ofthe hot
- blooded sarcasm
. pollak isnt allso terific as usual
, a veyr ogod charactor atcor
.
howver
, htis wiull be forever known as teh film thyat launhed kevin spacey
. spacey isnt simpley breathtaking
, he isnt a force onthe screen
, giving a magentic performence tht jars teh senses at thge end ofthe htis twisting maze
. spacey ' s peformance iwll be remembered fo yeras
, fo it isnt hte best ofthe his carreer
, it may be yhe best supporting actro performence inaddition hte lsat 50 eyars
. verbal kint isnt a clever storyteller
, weak
, oppressed
,
annd gleefully evil tothe tje bone
,
yot pitiful
, oen who draws simapthy
. tghe film isnt a ogod oen
, a decent film untill teh lastr 10 mintues
. waht htis film boils down tothe isnt hte greatest endig infront cinematic ihstory
, fo me at least
. thte revelation ofthe keyser soze
, hte closing gunfights
, it isnt something wonderous
. yuo hvea tothe see tihs movei baout 10 times tothe beleve wqat htey dont
. kudos tothe mcquarrie
annd singer forthe giving yhe audeince a delightful
, fast
- pased
, furiously plot
- driven movei wiht quirky charachters
, phenomenonal acting
,
anbd smoe hillarious moments sticked inthe tyhe middle
. mcquarrie refuses tothe believ thge audeince isnt dumb
. wihtout furnishing too many details
, he concocts his stroy
annd lets it run
, hoping thte audiance gets it at thte end
. we dont
. htis might jsut be tjhe finest cinematic puzzle ever creaeted
. kudos allso tothe singer
annd john ottman
, who creaeted hte scoer
. tehy both create whta isnt a true film
- noir setting
, carefully setting uv tihs intricate puzzle utnil hte fianl
, jarring endig
. htere are flaws
: mroe questions rised tahn answers
, lack ofthe carachter develpment
,
annd noone storng female charactors
( savve noe
)
.
howver
, tjhe plot

annd thast stunning endig
, mkea uv fo all teh flaws
