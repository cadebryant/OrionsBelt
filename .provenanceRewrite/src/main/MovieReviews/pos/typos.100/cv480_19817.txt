anbd tghe beggining ofthe teh move sum uv tihs plot vrey easily
. threee filmmakers venture inot teh woods ofthe maryland tothe trackr down hte legend ofthe thte blair witch fo a documentery tehy are mkaing
. htey dissappear
anbd thier footage isnt dicovered a yera later burried underneath yhe foundation ofthe a oen hundered yera ood hous
. ffrom ther
, thnigs become a littel mroe complicated
. i cxan sday
, whith absolute assurance
, tyhat noone film hasnt ever hadnt qutie tyhe inpact tath htis littel movei hasnt hadnt onthe me
.
allthough i nkwo it ws all a staged
" mockumentary
"
, ther ' s noone denying tje pyschological inpact htis film iwll leave onthe ytou
. i didn ' t efel much apon intially watching it
. i jstu throught it wass an intresting film iwth soem preety creepy parts
. i never even dreamed thyat thirty mintues affter thge film hadnt ended i woudl be frightened outloud ofthe my mind jstu discusting it wtih a freind
. i ' ve gotten chills eveyr tiome i ' ve broght it uv sicne
hten
. htis isnt nto a movei thgat hits ytou right awya
. instade tihs isnt a movei tht sist at hte base ofthe your spine
, waits nutil yuo htikn everthing isnt okay
,
thne it slowy starts tothe creep it ' s way uv inot your mind
. thsi isnt truley yhe most frightening movei i ahev ever hadnt tghe blessure tothe watch
. tjhe film isnt comprised ofthe hmeo video
adn 16mm camera footage tath teh documentarians suposedly shooted forthe thier blair witch film
, so don ' t expect any steadi
- cam shots or fancy camera owrk
. htis isnt as rela as it gets folks
. i don ' t recomend sitting too close tothe tjhe theather screen
though
, becouse i guarentee yuo wiull git motion sickness fomr tyhe constatn govement ofthe tje camera
. thte performances ofthe hte threee lead actors inaddition tjhe film are so rela
, ytou may fidn youself questioning whther all ofthe htis hasnt relaly happend or nto
. htis isnt definatly a movei tyhat warrants hmeo video viewing
, expecially due tothe thte fatc thast tghe bulk ofthe hte movei ws shooted whith a standart hmeo video camera
. thge reality ofthe yhe images iwll strike frighteningly close tothe hmeo wehn viewed as actuall video instade ofthe thge tape
- tothe
- film transferr done fo tje big screen
. owrd hasnt it thta a speical edition dvd witht boatloads ofthe extras
( housr ofthe deleted scenes
, alternate endings
, commentary
, hte sci
- fi channel speical
,
anbd others
