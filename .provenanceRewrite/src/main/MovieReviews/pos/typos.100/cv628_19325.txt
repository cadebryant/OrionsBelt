:
` tarzan ' beautyfull tothe look at
, eazy tothe followup
. review
: disney continues its trend ofthe producing animated summer blockbuster movies meaned mostly fo childern
bu whith anough witn
anbd charm fo adults tothe be intersted
anbd at least entertained by tjhe stor
. teh basic premise isnt tjhe smae as eveyr otehr
` tarzan ' stoyr
: a boy isnt rised infront tyhe african jungle by gorillas
anbd becomes oney himselv never relaly understanding
( or even noticeing
) tyhat he ' s human
annd isnt a lot differnt ffrom thte animals he befriends
. tje frist thrid ofthe hte film shows how tarzan comes tothe be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gerilla who lost her pwn child infront a clasic case ofthe darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, isnt a mean
, conservitive leader ofthe tyhe pack ofthe gorillas who mkea uv tarzan ' s extended famaly
. he refuses tothe acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz druing teh childhood scenes
) as a son
annd oftenly hasnt tothe hold hismelf bcak ffrom killing tarzan affter he constinually doesnt dangerous
, wild thigns thyat are tghe result ofthe his pwn childish instincts
. i hve a feeling childrens wiull quicklyu be able tothe idenify withthe tarzan sicne all he realy isnt isnt jsut a kid who whants tothe haev funn
adn it ' s funny how hte adults fail tothe comprehend thsi
. later
, as thte sotry transitions ffrom tarzan as a child tothe a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he isnt encounter by a party ofthe threee humans fomr england

) who isnt aslo a scientist
;
adn thier slick
anbd cunning
,
yot barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it ' s eazy tothe tell where thte stor isnt oging at all times
bu yhe screenplay doesn ' t seem liuke it wass writen hastly nor dumbed down forthe childrens ' s enjoyment
. sure htere ' s a lot ofthe cliche stfuf here
, liek clayton ' s smugness
annd diablical manipulation ofthe tarzan
anbd jane
; tjhe goofy supporting charachters
( voiced by rosie o ' donnell
[ inwhich full brooklyn accent

. ther ' s alsot a lot ofthe funn acation such as tarzan ' s swinging thru tje jungle onthe vines
anbd sliding down
adn arund tree branches
anbd trunks
. it ' s jstu liek skateboarding raelly fast
annd doign all sorts ofthe tricks
