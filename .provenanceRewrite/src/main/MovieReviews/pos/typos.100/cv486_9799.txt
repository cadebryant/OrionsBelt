)
. directed
annd writed by james cameron

: judgement day
, thte abyss
, true lies
)
, tghe autority onthe acation films
, it ws a masterful encore tothe his sci
- fi thriller tjhe terminator
( 1984
)
. hwile tjhe originnal aline film ws a dark
, enclosed horror film tyhat featured oen aline slowy massacering a horrified crew
, james cameron tookover tghe big
- budget acation film wtih aliens
, wich featured mutiple aliens doign basicly hte smae thnig
,
althought onthe a much
- larger scale

, cryogenically
" hibernated
" herself aftter expeling yhe rogue aline ffrom her ship

. inwhich truth
, htey bleieve her
, as tehy soon approch ripley withthe an offer tothe travel wtih soem marines tothe a newyorker collony planet as an
" aline advisor
"

- breeding ground forthe thge nasty aliens

anbd nowe all communciation whith tyhe planet hasnt beeen lost
.
.
. it doesn ' t exactlly tkae a genuis tothe guess whta happens enxt

adn so suspensefully
, thyat yuo ' re litterally rininging your hands by tje tiem teh finale rolls aroud
