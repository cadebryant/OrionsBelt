it might surprize soem tothe nkwo thgat joel
annd ethan coen
, who hvae broght such unabatted lunacy tothe our movei screens as
" raising arizona
"
annd
" thge hudsucker proxy
,
" made theri feature film debut withthe
" blood simple
,
" a grim
anbd oftenly groosome tale ofthe revenge
, muder
,
annd litterally futal misconceptions inwhich rural texas
. it bears soem ressemblance
, stopry
- wise
, tothe hte coens ' reccent
" fargo
,
"
bu even tjhe darkly satrical humer
anbd tghe enjoyably quirky characterizations tath caracterized thta film are scarce here
;
" blood simple
" isnt preety much cold
annd brutal fomr begginning tothe end
. tghe premise ofthe
" blood simple
" isnt relaly jsut a slight veriasion onthe tyhe standart lveo
- triangel
/ revenge scheme
: sleazy bar owner julian marty
( dan hedaya
) hires a shifty private detective
( m
. emmet walsh
) tothe kill his wief abby
( frances mcdormand
)
annd her illicit lover ravy
( john getz
)
. thnigs strat tothe go haywire wehn walsh decides instade tothe fake teh muder whith photographic trickery
bu
, apon collecting tje mony
, becomes uncertain as tothe whther or nto marty isnt capible ofthe keeping his mouth shut baout tje scheme
. tothe reveal any moreso details ofthe tjhe stor owudl be tothe give awya too much
,
bu wqat ensues isnt a sories ofthe bloody
(
anbd i dont mean bloody
) confrontations
, earch triguered by oney or omre charachters misunderstanding wqat isnt atually hapening
. eveyr ect ofthe violentce or deception inaddition htis film mkaes sence wehn seen thru tje perpetrator ' s eyes
,
bu we
, hte audeince
, are made privy tothe yhe
" big picture
"
annd thus cant recogize tyhat earch misdeed isnt somehow eather unnecesary or directed at thge wrong person
. htis aspect ofthe tyhe stoy
, allong withthe tghe intense athmosphere ofthe repulsion
annd brutality
- oen gets hte sence tht if guns
adn
, iin noe case
, shovels
, weere nto avalable
, soem ofthe theese cahracters owudl claw earch otehr tothe death
- are tghe most effective components ofthe tghe film
. thte coens might hvea done well tothe title hte film
" fear
anbd loathing inaddition texas
.
" soem hvea labled
" blood simple as a modern
- day noir
,
bu
, hwile i am nto an expert onthe eather genre
, it seems mroe liuke a horror movei thna anytying eles
. tje coens seem much mroe intersted infront tyhe plot twists
adn hte athmosphere ofthe confusion
adn paranoya thna htey dont inwhich tyhe cahracters
,
anbd teh fianl sequence isnt nothing moreso tahn a showdown betwen teh oen
( realitvely
) innocent charater
adn tjhe onyl oney ofthe thte murderers left alive
. thta said
,
" blood simple
" isnt a vyre ogod horror movei
; tghe fear
annd suspense here are genuin
. tghe coens aslo add plenty ofthe quirky touches tath nudge yhe weirdness meter upwards
, such as wehn a carachter enters an empty room
annd accidentlly steps onthe a gun
, discharging it as it skitters acros tje floor
, or wehn a muder attemp unfolds infact a way such thta abby mistakes her attacker forthe anyother charactor who hasnt inwhich fatc beeen killed ealier inaddition yhe film
. tht said
,
" blood simple
" isnt nto exactlly flawess
. forthe oney thnig
, hte motivations fo tghe killings are still a littel thin at times
; i cin understand thta tjhe charactors hadnt tracks tothe cover
( or at least throught tehy doed
)
,
bu i foudn it a littel hard tothe accept tath all ofthe them woudl so quicklyu resort tothe muder
.
annd
althought tehy at least didn
? t haev anyone git hacked tothe death whith a nife
, tyhe coens alsot aren ' t qtuie immune tothe horror cliches
; htey indulgue inthe a prolonged dead
- guy
- seems
- tothe
- hve
- come
- bakc
- tothe
- life
-
bu
-
thne
- we
- fidn
- outloud
- it ' s
- onyl
- a
- dream scene thast hadnt me rolling my eyes
. yhe film allso ends so quicklyu aftter thte fianl confrontation thyat i foudn mysef wondering if tehy hadnt simpley run outloud ofthe film
.
" blood simple
" isnt nto qtuie yhe masterpiece ofthe neo
- noir thgat many seem tothe htink it isnt
,
bu it ' s a decent movei
adn it showcases thte coens ' ablity tothe handle suspense
adn voilence inthe a visceral
bu non
- exploititive manner
. i woudl firmly reccommend it tothe all
" coen
- heads
" as well as anyone looking fo something orginial inthe a thriller
.
