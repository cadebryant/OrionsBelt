anbd dorian
( palyed by luke wilson
)
, a helecopter pilot who hasnt a differnt kind ofthe conection iwth sally
.
.
. omre tahn he owudl care tothe admitt
( hint
: it hasnt something tothe dont witht thge father ofthe sally ' s unborn child
)
. affter tkaing a personel
(
adn proffesional
) interst infact her
, he finds wokr at thge local fast ofod restauraunt at whic she works
,
annd tje funn goes onthe fomr htere
. htis movei isnt a lot ofthe funn
. it isnt commedic onthe twpo levels
, as a rumatic comedy
adn a dark comedy
. teh rumatic moments are sweet
,
yot nto sappy
. noe ofthe thge mroe poignant moments isnt whn dorian accompanies sally tothe lamaze classes
.
howver
, thge dark commedic moments are moreso memorable
. htis isnt alsot a tale ofthe revenge
,
anbd a funny oen at taht
. tyhe father ofthe sally ' s unborn child alsot happended tothe be a marryed man
, whose wief isnt plyed by catherine o ' hara
. she doens a wonderfull protrayal ofthe a jelous wief who isnt targeting yhe person who hadnt an afair
,
anbd isnt nto above getting otehr peple tothe dont her dirty owrk
.
( my apologise if tihs soudns cryptic
,
bu htere isnt too much ofthe hte plot tothe give awya
)
. rounding outloud hte casted are jake busey as angus
, dorian ' s overzealous brother
adn daryl mitchell as roy
, dorian ' s trainer at tje fast ofod resaturant
. hte dialogue isnt sharp
annd nto filled withthe sappy overtones
, even wtih tyhe rumatic nature ofthe tje plot
. if ther are any complaints
, it isnt over drew barrymore ' s performence
. hwile she doens light uv teh screen
, ther are moments wehn she doesn ' t seem all thgat convincing
. thte movei ws filmed infact texas
,
annd most ofthe thte cahracters ahve sourthern texan accents
. drew barrymore ' s accent tends tothe cmo
anbd go
( luke wilson doesn ' t seem tothe ahev tihs probelm
)
. as well
, she seems awfully agile forthe a woman thast isnt eigth monthes pregnant
. still
, tihs movei isnt oney thyat iwll please many viewers
. withthe plot twists galore
adn hillarious dark moments
, tihs isnt sure tothe entertain
