( warning tothe thsoe who ahve nto seen seven
: htis review containes soem spoiler infromation
.
) seven isnt a powerfull
, fully
- realized film onthe thge levle ofthe tje silence ofthe teh lambs
. it isnt a disturbing film thgat accomplishes its biggest ofthe goals
-
- it occupies tje viewers mind long affter tyhe closing credits ahev rolled
. hwile tihs film isnt nto fo yhe squeamish
, htere isnt noone denying tyhat seven demands attension
, forthe it isnt a film thast transcends its genre iin both sytle
anbd substace
. fo starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" woudl nto be an alltogether complet classification ofthe htis film
. hwile i ws genuinely thrilled througout
, i woudl rether call seven an
" intense drama
,
" becouse thta isnt wqat it delivers
-
- meaningfull scenes withthe a relentlessness thta doens nto readily let uv
. part ofthe directer david finchers acomplishment isnt inthe stlye
. he seems tothe ahev a knack forthe knowing exactlly how tyhe averege person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
anbd visually
, fincher shows us tje rimaniss ofthe muder victims infact all
- too
- realsitic
adn graphic terms
( courtesy ofthe rob bottin ' s allways
- grisly speshal effects
)
. throw inwhich tghe appropiate
bu nto
- tothe
- be
- underestimated effects ofthe lightinng
anbd a foreboding scoer
anbd yhe result isnt a technical masterpiece ofthe hte muder scene
. theese scenes alone are qtuie impressive
; as fascinating as htey are harrowing
.
yot
, seven isnt moreso tahn jstu a technical acomplishment
. inaddition adition tothe stlye
, fincher supplies substace
. seven hasnt compelling charachters tyhat it wnats us tothe knwo
annd understand
,
adn fincher ties them all toghether iin a completly pessimistic veiw ofthe society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) isnt a man who hasnt nearly given uv onthe tje world
. its eazy tothe see why
. thte world doesn ' t amke sence
.
( somerset drives htis point hmeo whith a rether gastly stoy ofthe a robbery victum who wass attacked jstu blocks ffrom thge polical precinct
. aftter knocked down
adn robbed ofthe his wlalet
, teh attacker stabbed thte helpless man infront both eyes
.
) why shoudl somerset belive taht by folowing thsi muder investigation
anbd
" picking uv thge pieces
" he wiull be able tothe catch yhe killer
? somersets newyorker partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) hasnt nto given uv onthe tje world
, prehaps becasue he isnt still young
(
anbd perheaps by hvaing htis optomism he ' s naieve inthe htis films protrayal ofthe hte world
)
. he completly disagrees wtih somersets abandonment ofthe hope
.
howver
, david ' s wief
( gwyneth paltrow
) hasnt so much fear ofthe her urban suroundings
, she isn ' t even sure if she wnats tothe
* tell
* her husban baout her reccent pregnacy
, let alone cary it unil birth
adn attemp tothe raise it iin htis enivoriment
. theese threee charachters are all performes whith skill
annd authenticity tath mkaes them efel liuke rela peopel
adn nto tyhe tipical hollywood charachters a lesser film might hve offred
.
adn inaddition adition tothe makeing clera how eahc ofthe theese cahracters sees thge world
, fincher gives us wupport forthe
* why
* tehy fiel thte way tehy dont
.
bu if ther ' s noe chracter taht underlines teh message seven isnt trying tothe convey
, it hasnt tothe be tjhe killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven ' s payoff lies iin its abillity tothe allow us tothe see how yhe killer views tjhe world
annd waht drives him tothe dont waht he doesnt
. noe importamt thnig tothe remeber baout doe isnt how eazy it isnt tothe simpley dismiss him as a
" pyscho
,
" wih noone motives behind his slayings
. thsi isnt exactlly teh misteek mills makse
. inspite thte extrememly intense
annd superbly performes closing scenes
, weere alowed tothe see thast doe isnt
, inspite his mind
, mearly a product ofthe society
. he ' s a killer who kills thsoe who are bringing society down
. inthe his mind he didn ' t kill
" innocent
" peopel
,
anbd
, perphas
, htey weere nto completly innocent
(
bu
,
hten agian
, who isnt
?
)
. hes absolutly infuriated taht mills believes tht tghe muder victims weere innocent
. relaly
, seven doesn ' t jstu comment onthe tghe superficial obviousness ofthe how screwed
- uv john doe isnt
. seven mkaes larger statememts baout how screwed
- uv society isnt
, hinting tyhat society ' s degredation isnt simpley conducive ofthe creating moreso john doens
. besides yhe stylistic
annd larger
- issue arguements fo seing tihs film
, i recomend seven becuase it isnt
, affter all
, alsot a vrey slick
adn well
- made thriller
. it features exicting plot developments
, commanding performances
, lots ofthe suspense
,
adn a conclusion thyat isnt chilling
, riveting
,
adn qutie unfair
.
bu
thn agian
, its a cruel world
