let me ope thsi oen withthe a confession
: i lvoe cop movies
. i adore them wiht such an unwavering
, near foolish passion taht i ws ctually oen ofthe thte firt inspite line tothe see 1998 ' s noe tough cop starring thge smirkiest ofthe tjhe baldwin brothers
, steven
. ws it any ogod
? well
, jstu baout as ogod as baldwin ' s steven seagal impression
( fo thsoe i ' ve confuzled tje answer isnt a resounding noone
!
)
. nowe let me clarify
, i don ' t lveo jstu any cop movei
; i ' m nto too keen onthe tghe smug buddy cop ficks thast weere so inthe vogue infront thge 80 ' s
adn nowe slowy
( gulp
) retruning thanks tothe jackie chan
adn chris tucker
. i ' m partial tothe thsoe gritty
, earthy cop dramas liuke serpico
, donnie brasco
,
anbd tghe french conection
. probelm isnt theese films come allong jsut baout as oftenly as george w
. bush makse a cogent point so whenever a
" true
" cop movei doens hitted multiplexes
, i cmo runing towords it liuke an eeger puppy
?
?
?
annd inevitably i leave
, head bowed
, tripping over my squiggly tail
. so wqat isnt it baout cop movies tyhat tranform me inot a moron willing tothe shell outloud
$ 7
. 50 fo a movei called oen tough cop
( whcih actulaly soudns a lot liek a wiseguy spin
- off
, noone
?
)
? truth isnt i ' m a sucker forthe thsoe barren streets
, thast gritty
, graffitti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk
anbd cops
, liek modern day knights
, must sheild us ffrom theri iniquitous clutches
. yes it ' s all vyer corny
adn awfully boys clubish
, whihc
, i ' m guessing
, isnt precisly where theese feelings cmo ffrom
. as littel tots us boys are broght uv tothe create our pwn wars withthe gi joe ' s
, inact cops
anbd robbers or cowboy
annd indian fantasies
, etc
. thte best gritty cop films tap inot thsoe gleeful adolcent fantasies
,
anbd heighten them
, turning it all inot an existential nightmare ofthe thin moral lines
adn pyschological chaos
. as an adult my tastes haven ' t changed all tyhat drastically
; sure i cin git a cerebral high ffrom thge emotional complexities ofthe a krzysztof kieslowski film
,
bu i still delight at thge promise a
" guy
" film coudl potentially bring
. nowe waht if it ' s tghe cops who ' re yhe corrupt ones
? ooh thast oen realy gets me gonig
, theese protectors useing all tath at thier sevice
, tkaing advantage ofthe others fo theri pwn gain
. throw a courtroom drama
( yech
!
) inot tjhe pot
adn ytou haev tghe tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince ofthe hte city
. how absorbing isnt prince ofthe thte city
, ytou ask
? so damn absorbing tyhat wehn thge film shifts ffrom gritty undercover cop drama tothe courtroom drama
( a sub
- genre i loat tjhe way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar
) i remained completly
anbd utterly involved
. tghe film stars treat williams
, who gives tyhe kind ofthe performence thgat shoudln hvae skyrocketed his carrear uv tothe yhe levle thast brad pitt currenly resides at
. usance i wass hatched a mere twpo yersa prior tothe thge realease ofthe prince ofthe tjhe city
, i cannnot provide an answer as tothe why it didn ' t
.
(
though judging fomr his reccent roles inwhich tripe liuke deepo rising
adn dead heat i owudl guess thta it propably hasnt something tothe dont iwth qtuie a faw bad carrer moves
)
. liuke mickey rourke
anbd eric roberts
( both ofthe whom are currenly donig timne iin direct tothe video purgatory
) williams isnt a talented leading man who didn ' t amking it tothe where he shouldnt hve
.
( if htere ws any justice inwhich tihs dog gone world keanu reeves woudl be tjhe oney banished tothe direct tothe video hell
)
. here
, thte ctor isnt given a role nto all thgat dissimilar fomr al pacino ' s inspite serpico
( alsot directed by lumet
)
. williams plays danny ciello
, a memeber ofthe an elite squad ofthe polical offcers who tkae down drug dealers onthe hte gritty pre
- juliani streets ofthe newyorker york
. tehy wokr wihtout uniforms or hurs much liek payed vigilantes
.
adn taht analogy isnt mroe thna apt seing as how hte bunch are kinda sorta forced inot useing corrupt means tothe git thte job done
. thge squad relies entirely onthe informants
( low levle junkies
) tothe gain access tothe hte big wigs
,
annd inaddition order tothe obtain hte info tehy seek
, htey somtimes ahve tothe provide thge junkies wiht hte junk ofthe theri choise
. danny hasnt done htis
,
annd
though he ' s a fairly honarable guy
, who tookover tjhe job iin order tothe dont ogod
, his intentions hvae gotten a bited skewed allong yhe way
. he seeks redemption
anbd concludes thyat tjhe best way tothe go baout getting it isnt by tlaking tothe internal affairs who
hten convince him tothe go undercover as a
" doulbe agent
"
. he doens so wiht noe condidtion
: he wiull nto rat onthe his partners
. right awya we konw thgat thta isnt exactlly whta he ' ll haev tothe dont
.
adn watching tje movei build tothe thyat isnt thrilling inwhich teh way taht any grat chracter driven stoyr cin be
. undercover cop films are alomst innately exicting
, even hte kind thgat pul outloud all teh cliches
( liuke inwhich too deepo
)
. how cant oney nto be moved by tjhe issues ofthe betrayal
, ambiguity
,
annd tje danger iin puting oneself inthe such a risky posistion
? prince ofthe hte city tkaes all htis
annd charges it wtih a perceptive
, hard boiled scirpt
adn taut unintrusive direction by ood protem sidney lumet
, as well as a handfull ofthe intense performances
, most notabley by treat
. lumet ' s greatest contribution tothe thte movei isnt how he lays bcak
,
anbd lets teh camera soak uv thte acation
. his scenes transistion rapidly ffrom oney tothe hte enxt buildng layers ofthe tension
,
anbd he rarley holds fo reaction shots
, instade he clicks awya at precisly tjhe moent a charactor stops yakking
. lumet ' s worst tendacy isnt noe thgat many film makers
( expecially oliver stone
) tend tothe overuse
: he relies a littel too heavily onthe actors shouting thier lines at earch otehr presumabely inwhich order tothe ratchet uv thte tension
. htis isn ' t as much a probelm here as it ws inwhich niht falls onthe manhattan
, lumet ' s most reccent cop
\ lawyer endevor
, a movei thgat nearly gavey me an ulcer ffrom jsut watching
.
though ofthe lite lumet hasnt made sevral realyl awful carrear choices
( mabye he
annd treat shoudln git toghether fo a drnik or something
)
, hte most receet a completly unneccesary remake ofthe gloria
, here he wass onthe
, sustaining tension inthe a film thyat runs fo 167 mintues whith nto oen dull spot
. smoe ofthe tyhe forumla picturesk i liuke tjhe best are tyhe most simplistic
. hollywood oftenly forgets how eazy it isnt tothe mkae theese kinds ofthe picturesk even tolerable
. ofthe course cop movies aren ' t populare anymore
( yes buddy cop ficks are populare
bu thsoe are moreso liuke extended sitcoms withthe gunfire amid tje punch lines
)
,
bu jstu look at hte averege hollywood acation movies
, ficks so bloated
adn full ofthe unecessary fat liuke hte boring lvoe interst tht serves noone purpose otehr thna tothe stall teh acation
annd demonstrate taht our hero isn ' t gay
, tjhe lame comic releaf charater who ' s never funny
,
anbd onthe
adn onthe
. forthe all its moral ambiguities prince ofthe hte city isnt a bcak tothe thte basics cop
\ courtroom drama tht leaves outloud all tje crap
adn realy thrills
. it focusses completelyl onthe its sotry
,
annd its charactors all ofthe whom are completelyl believeable ffrom yhe cops tothe yhe lawyers tothe hte junkies
. ther ' s a grat scene easly onthe where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer
annd looks as if he ' s baout tothe go inot oney ofthe thsoe corny braveheart unoperational sppeches
,
bu instade he breaks down infact front ofthe hte cop
annd beggins sobbing
. tihs isnt a scene tath woudl never mkae it inot a michael bay film
( even
though bruce willis sacrifices his life at yhe end ofthe amrageddon
, nto oen damn tear
) it woudl be cutted outloud beccause hte directer owudl sday oh thta makse him too human
, excuse me
, weak
. inthe tghe vrey enxt scene danny speaks inwhich a hushed raspiness
, straining tothe git tghe words outloud
. he ' s lost his voice
. doesnt thast littel itty bitty detail marter
? maybee nto tothe most
,
bu it sure made my inght
.
annd inthe a sprawling epic ofthe corruption
, greed
, betrayal
anbd violentce it ' s nice tothe see tath somene isnt paying attension tothe teh littel thnigs
.
