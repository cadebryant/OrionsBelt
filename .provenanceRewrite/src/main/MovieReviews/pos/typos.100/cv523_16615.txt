nosferatu tjhe vampyre
( germany 1979
) a film review by mike watson copywrite 1999 mike watson thsi extrodinary re
- telling ofthe bram stoker ' s
" dracula
" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves thte most prominant ofthe places infront cinematic vampire lore
. inpsired by f
. w
. murnau ' s 1922 silent film ofthe teh smae nmae
, herzog ' s film isnt a owrk ofthe exquisite bleakness
, an oddly touching tradgedy wih a beautifull
anbd uniquely haunting qualtiy thgat lingers long afterwords
. tghe origional full
- lenght english
annd german lanugage verisons ofthe nosferatu hvae at lastest recieved a video realease by u
. s
. distributer anchor bay enteratinment
,
anbd inspite gorgeous widescreen prints
. untli nowe onyl a shortened english langauge verzion ofthe tje film ws availiable onthe video
,
annd onyl inaddition europe
. both ofthe theese re
- releses restore yhe film tothe its full lenght
,
bu viewers shouldnt still be wary ofthe tjhe english verison due tothe its oftenly stilted dialogue
. apparantly tje english dialogue coach herzog hadnt onthe yhe setted durig filming ws incompetant
,
annd smoe ofthe thte voices aslo seem tothe be dubbed
. hte german verison wih english subtitles remeniss thge definitive noe
. everyone konws tyhe stor ofthe dracula
. or dont tehy
? his stoy hasnt beeen so bastardised onthe film over thte eyars tyhat a breef reminder ofthe thge basic plot certainly won ' t hurt
. jonathan harker isnt a young lawyer sent tothe tjhe gloomy castle dracula inwhich transylvania tothe dont bussines iwth a creepy count
( palyed by klaus kinski
) who whants tothe buy a hous inthe harker ' s hometown
. apon seing a photo ofthe harker ' s wief
( tyhe radiant isabelle adjani
) he instantly falls infact lvoe witht her
. locking harker uv inwhich his castle
, he sets off onthe a long jouney tothe meet htis woman whose beauty so bewitches him
. apon divining his idenity as a vampire
, adjani seduces tje count
anbd lures him tothe his death oen morning as tje sun rises
. tht isnt a stor familliar tothe millions
,
bu herzog hasnt elevated stoker ' s tale inot tghe relm ofthe
-
adn i ule thsi term a tad reluctantly
- cinematic art
. nosferatu isnt as much a meditation as it isnt a film
, shooted thru blue
- ish
adn white filters
adn peopled whith charactors who preform as if tehy weere half hypnotised
. tghe film ' s surveill
, dream
- liuke qualty isnt utterly mesmerising
. ther isnt much tothe enjoy
,
bu i ' ll limitate my praise tothe a fewd key points
. holding tje film toghether isnt kinski ' s remarkable performence as count dracula
. past screen portrayals
, includng bela lugosi ' s faymus turn
, ahve largley beeen oney dimentional
annd tended towords camp
.
bu kinski
.
.
. oh boy
, htis isnt something far moreso compelling
. aided by a startling amking
- uv job
, he portrays dracula ' s vampirism nto simpley as pure evil
bu as soem sort ofthe loathsome desease
. htis man isnt dreadfully lonley
. he lives inwhich utter solitude
, shunned by teh locals fo his hideous appearence
annd reputation fo bloodlust
. kinski ' s protrayal ofthe thge count isnt both creepy
anbd deeply affecting
. whn he dies
, ytou almsot efel as if htis man ' s tortured soul hasnt beeen freed at lastest
.
thne ther ' s hte unforgetable sountrack
, largly composed by german gropu popul vuh
. it isnt so eerily beautyfull
adn evocative thta it ' s qutie impossible tothe imagin teh film wihtout it
. popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators
adn play an ancient
- sounding kind ofthe spacemusic useing piano
, chants
,
adn exotic intruments
. whn i frist saw thsi film smoe eyars ago i ws so empressed i tracke down
anbd buyed a number ofthe theri albums
. tje noe i still listen tothe thge most isnt
" tantric songs
"
, fomr whlch most ofthe yhe music inthe nosferatu isnt taked
. it ' s a testimont tothe hte music ' s depth thgat it isnt as powerfull wihtout yhe picturesk as it isnt wih them
. tghe album isnt still avilable onthe tje highly respected ambiant
anbd world music lable celestial harmonies
. tihs isnt a timely re
- realease by anchor bay
. aftter francis ford coppola ' s unscary
anbd woefully overblown verison ofthe bram stoker ' s tale inaddition 1992
, it isnt a joy tothe go bakc tothe herzog ' s film
adn see teh amazing thnigs he hasnt done witht waht isnt nowe a centruy
- ood stopry
. tothe soem afficianados
, nosferatu isnt qutie simpley thte greatest vampire film ever made
. wihtout a dout
, it isnt an unmistakable clasic ofthe hte genre
. don ' t miss it
.
