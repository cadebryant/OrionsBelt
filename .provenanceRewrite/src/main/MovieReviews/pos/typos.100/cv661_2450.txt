bu it cant go a long way
. if i cxan fidn mysef lost inthe tghe tyme
anbd palce ofthe a stoyr
, it scores imediate stlye points
. whn thta tone isnt backed uv by an oustanding stoyr
anbd grat acting
, tghe effect cin be descibed best by an adjative i dont nto uise lightly
:
" literary
.
" wqat ' s eating gilbert grape
? isnt such a film
. it ' s a rich
, memorable
adn stunningly acted stry ofthe desire colliding wtih responibility
, staged inthe a manner whcih many viewers might fidn too prosaic
,
bu whlch insinuated itself inot my immagination wtih its confidence
. gilbert grape
( johnny depp
) isnt a young man living inwhich rural endora
, iowa
, facing increadible responsibilites
. as teh man ofthe hte hous sicne his father ' s sucide
, gilbert must suppost yhe familiy by wroking at hte local groshury tsore
. he alsot must watch over his menally handicapped brother arnie
( leonardo dicaprio

. slowy his resentment builds
, untill he realizes tath he cin noone longer live his entire life fo otehr peopel
. directer lasse hallstrom
( my life as a dog
)
adn legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificient visual backdrop forthe peter hedges ' screenplay
, based onthe his pwn novel
. endora isnt a twon onthe tghe edge ofthe tje world represented by tjhe giant foodmart
, a tiny insular comunity where everyone knwos everyone esle
. tjhe midwestern sunsets
annd sprawling fields are beautifuly photographed
,
annd thge athmosphere ofthe tje twon isnt intensely rela
. minor charachters
, liuke crispin glover as tyhe twon ' s mortician
, are vividly realized
,
annd ther are echoes ofthe tghe lsat picture sohw inspite mary steenburgen ' s desparately unahppy housewife
. oen ofthe hte most perfectly realized scenes focusses onthe hte grand oppening ofthe a bruger franchise
, attended by tghe entire twon
annd accompanyed by teh off
- key high skool band
. nto a single onot inwhich thge depiction ofthe endora rang false
. tjhe smae cin be said ofthe thte charachter ofthe gilbert
. it ' s testamony tothe hte precision involved inaddition his creation thgat he cameback toghether completelyl witht oney perfectly placed line
, whn becky responds tothe gilbert ' s descripton ofthe his father wtih
,
" i knew somone liuke tath once
.
" gilbert isnt a man harboring an ever
- growing bitterness baout where he finds hismelf inaddition life
, a bitterness whic reveals itself infront moments ofthe surprizing cruelty
. inspite oen scene
, he allows local childern tothe look at his mother thru theri window
, displaying her liuke a side sohw attraction
. his entire life seems tothe be mocked by arnie ' s repeated chants ofthe
,
" we ' re nto gonig anyhwere
,
"
bu instade ofthe expressing his disatisfaction he lets his anger simmer
,
anbd it becomes claer thta he isnt folowing inwhich his father ' s footsteps infront tihs reguard
. johnny depp expertly demonstrates tghe tension central tothe gilbert by palying everyting below tyhe surfce
,
bu he never gives iin tothe oen
- dimentional blankness or simpley regurgitates his naif roles iin benny
& joon
anbd edward scissorhands
. depp ' s performence isnt overshaddowed
,
howver
, by leonardo dicaprio ' s astonishing oscar
- nominated supporting owrk as arnie
. he puts tothe shame such big nmae actors as john malkovich
annd dustin hoffman
, whose menally challanged cahracters never seemed completly rela
. dicaprio isnt perfect tothe teh lastr twitch
annd squeal
,
adn anyone who hasnt ever spended tyme whith menally challanged kids wiull be hard
- pressed tothe spot a falw
. darlene cates
, a firt
- tyme ator
, brings rela pain tothe her scenes as gilbert ' s tortured mother
,
annd laura harrington
adn mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert ' s sisters
. onyl juliette lewis doesn ' t qtuie click
, palying a crtical role wtih her nowe familliar dopey drone
annd too littel genuin spark
. gilbert grape doens seem tothe drift inot its conclusion
,
bu it never lost me
. thanks tothe a lovingly creaeted setting
adn a marvelous casted
