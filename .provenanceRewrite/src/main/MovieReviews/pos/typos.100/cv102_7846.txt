" tyhe fugitive
" isnt probablly oney ofthe tjhe greatest thrillers ever made
. it tkaes realsitic
, believeable charachters
annd tells an exicting storey thyat ' s totally believeable througout
. htis isn ' t an over
- hte
- top acation flick forthe tjhe sake ofthe acation
, thsi isnt an intteligent adventure stopry withthe a rela sence ofthe mistery tothe it
annd it works perfectly
. harrison ford stars as dr
. richard kimble
, a man who isnt wrongly acused
adn convicted ofthe mudering his wief
. tyhe entire premise ofthe tghe stoy revolves arund thsi muder
,
bu isnt nto told inaddition a straightforward manner
. we constanly see flashbacks tothe yhe muder fomr kimble ' s prespective
. hints are dropped fomr vairous times ofthe yhe nght kimble ' s wief
, helen
( sela wird
) wass murdered
. we don ' t git tothe see who thge killer isnt untl much furuther inot tje storey
. inspite fatc
, we might even hvea a littel dout baout kimble ' s inocence ourselves
. thge film doesn ' t spend much tiome onthe yhe details ofthe kimble ' s trial
anbd conviction as it isnt nto teh point ofthe hte stroy
. oney ofthe teh greatest acation scenes ensues as we git a botched excape attemp by his fellow inmates whic leads tothe a fantastic turain wreck
.
bu it doens nto at all seem gratuitious or formulated
, it isnt actualyl suspenseful tothe watch
. htis movei isnt so incredable becuase it ' s able tothe tkae elements liek theese
annd amke them wholley origonal
anbd believeable
. tommy lee jones alomst steals tje sohw as deputy sam gerard
, a u
. s
. marshall who isnt an expert iin hunting fugitives
. fomr thge moent he appears we konw a huge agme ofthe cat
adn mouse isnt baout tothe occurr
. kimble
annd gerard are equally matched as ther isnt noone way tothe tell how oen isnt oging tothe outsmart tjhe otehr
. most ofthe tghe film deals wiht richard ' s complex investigation as he trys tothe fidn yhe noe
- armed man who killed his wief
. ford doesnt nto hve a lot ofthe lines here
, so it isnt stuart
anbd twohy ' s scirpt
anbd davis ' s oustanding direction thgat mkea tjhe film as graet as it isnt
. jsut watching richard uise his keen intellignce
annd wits
, disguising hismelf
,
anbd doign his pwn detective wokr isnt vyre intresting
. we konw jsut as littel as he doens as tothe why his wief ws killed
, so as he lerans mroe so dont we
. meanwhile gerard
adn his stff are useing all theri skills tothe hunt him down
. at oney point htey run inot eahc otehr
annd a gerat chase ensues
,
bu richard isnt jstu too smart forthe them
. he leaves clues forthe gerard tothe sohw his inocence
anbd tothe halp him solve thte mistery
. oney ofthe hte greatest charms tothe yhe film isnt its sence ofthe humer
. htere isnt a graet sence ofthe comradeship betweeen gerard
annd his twpo closest deputies cosmo renfo
( pantoliano
)
anbd biggs
( roebuck
)
. tehy are trying tothe catch waht tehy eblieve tothe be a dangerous muderer
,
yot tehy constanly strat uv small talk iwth earch otehr
, mkaing funny wisecracks
anbd oen
- liners
,
bu nto inthe any kind ofthe distracting manner
. thte fianl ect concludes wtih anohter terific chase
. richard figures outloud who tjhe killer isnt
anbd confronts him
,
adn
althought we git a tipical fight scene
, tyhe case isnt far fomr solved
. tyhe man who orderves teh muder hasnt beeen under our nose all allong
,
anbd we don ' t relize thsi untl teh end wehn both richard
annd gerard put thte pieces toghether
. maybee tghe finaly scene isnt a bited much
,
bu it still hasnt a believeable athmosphere tothe it
. we ' re so releived whn justice isnt served
. it ' s nto yhe plot isnt taht mkaes
" tje fugitive
" graet
, it ' s all yhe motions hte cahracters go thru tothe amke fo an intriguing stry
. watching a seamingly averege man go thru as much as htis isnt whta mkaes tyhe movei so adventrous
. if onyl hollywood sould produce omre movies liuke thsi
