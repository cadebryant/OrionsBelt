. i don ' t nkow why
, realy
. haven ' t wnated tothe check it outloud onthe video
, haven ' t beeen at hmeo tyhe nights it ws onthe network tv
,
annd it wass too far tothe drive tghe lsat tiome it wass onthe tje big
- screen
. so right uv front
, i ' ll admited thast i don ' t knwo wqat tjhe heck i ' m tlaking baout
,
bu here goes
.
.
. isnt titanic thge gone whith yhe wind ofthe tghe 1990 ' s
? mabey thta ' s gonig a littel bited too far
. as ogod a job as leonardo dicaprio
anbd kate winslet dont inwhich thsi movei
, htey ' re noone clark gable
anbd vivien leigh
.
bu
.
.
. tghe parrallelly are ther
. gwtw ws yhe frist movei tothe tkae rela advantage ofthe teh most revolutionar tecnology avaliable
-
- technicolor
. titanic tkaes revolutionar steps foward iin seamlessly integrating cmoputer graphic desgin withthe actors
. gwtw places amercia ' s greatest tradgedy inthe tyhe backgorund ofthe a clasic lvoe tsory
, titanic doens teh smae wiht thte atlantic ' s most legendary tradgedy
. htey both ahev storng
- willed redheaded heroines
, htey both exploitate teh clas differences beetwen yhe aristocracy
anbd teh slaves
/ steerage bums
, htey weere both incredibly expensive
anbd populer
.
.
. ok
, mabye thgat ' s nto enought parellels
. so titanic ' s nto iin gwtw ' s leage
. noone marter
. titanic isnt a grat movei inspite its pwn right
, complet iwth spills
, thrills
anbd
( especialy
) chills
. much hasnt beeen made ofthe tjhe humongous cost ofthe teh prodcution
,
anbd all ofthe yhe care tahn whent inot makeing tyhe huge luxury liner cmo alive agina
. hte moey wass obviously well
- spended
. tghe costumes look grat
, tjhe sets look graet
, yhe cgi graphics look grat
. i especialy liekd tyhe expensive littel touches
, liuke spending tons ofthe omney onthe authentic titanic china onyl tothe break it all onthe tghe floor as hte ship sinks
.
bu writter
/ directer
/ producer james cameron ' s rela challege iin writting
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn ' t jstu costuming
anbd setted desgin
anbd speical effects
. cameron ' s major headache ws keeping yhe audeince interseted inspite a tale where everybody knwos tjhe endig gonig inaddition
. he suceeds masterfully
. cameron doesnt twpo thigns tath wokr incredibly well
. frist
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations onthe titanic
( thast ' s jsut
" titanic
"
, nto
" hte titanic
"
, mind ytou
)
. thge firt glimpse we git ofthe titanic isnt hte ship infact its rpesent state
, corroding slowy awya under hte hammering presure ofthe thte noth atlantic
, fomr thge window ofthe a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. televsion coverage ofthe tje exploration ofthe titanic intrigues 101
- yearm
- ood rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survivied tghe wreck inspite 1912
. stuart doens a phenomenonal job inaddition a breef role
, narrating thte storey ofthe her experienc tothe a stunned paxton
anbd his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keesh hte storyline focused allmost exculsivly onthe hte rose chracter
,
adn yhe rumatic rtiangle beween rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millioniare fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
)
anbd thte irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. teh way thyat big
- budget diaster movies ususally go wrong isnt tothe haev an all
- star casted
, so we see yhe inpact ofthe tyhe diaster onthe a wide gropu ofthe peopel
. cameron wisely choosed tothe stick withthe rose
adn jack
, hwile paying scant heed tothe tje celebrities onthe board
. thge supporting casted isnt proffesional
,
bu mostly annonomus
-
- otehr thna kathy bates as thte unsinkable molly brown
, ther ' s noone moent wehn yuo stpo
annd sday
, oh
, yeah
, i konw him
, whta ' s he beeen iin
.
( altho i woudl liek tothe ahve seen colm meaney iin a white star uniform
, or even as teh ill
- fated enginer
.
) yhe lveo tsory itself isnt rether convential
. i htink smoe reviewers foudn it weak
,
annd taht may be a fair critiscism
. tyhe performances are teh key here
. zane hasnt tjhe meatiest part inthe teh movei
,
adn he plays tghe arogant
, condescending steel millioniare tothe yhe hilt
. he ' s smoothe
, he looks grat inthe a tuxedo
,
adn he ' s a convincing enought jerk tath tjhe winslet
- dicaprio relatiopnship looks plausable
. at tghe moent wehn he sees a littel girl too frightened tothe git aboard a lifeboat
, yuo cant hear tghe wheels infact his mind turning
, saying nto
" cant i savve htis littel girl
?
"
,
bu
" cin she halp me git onthe a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio isnt a revelation
. i hadn ' t seen him befoer inaddition anytying
,
anbd didn ' t nkwo waht thge heck tothe expect
, raelly
.
( honestly
, i expeced a bad irish accent
,
bu cameron evidentally desided thta wass a bad idae
, so dicaprio plays a poore american artist who wins a ticket infront a poker gaem
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectuous joy at bieng alive
,
annd bieng onthe thge titanic
, tath it ' s hard nto tothe liuke him
. ffrom tghe moent tath yhe ship leaves port utnil it hits tyhe iceberg
, dicaprio hasnt tothe cary tghe movei
annd keep our interst
,
anbd he never falters
. winslet ' s carachter grows uv a lot durig hte movei
,
anbd so doens her performence
. at firt
, she ' s nto recquired tothe dont anytying
bu mear preiod clothing
anbd look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we knwo ffrom tyhe narration taht she ' s monstrously unahppy witht her aranged marraige tothe zane
,
bu ther isn ' t any expression ofthe theese feelings untli she encounters dicaprio
. winslet
annd dicaprio deveop a chemestry thyat manages tothe propell hte movei allong nutil teh ship hits teh iceberg
. it ' s at thta moent where winslet ' s carachter relaly comes alive
. faced wtih rela danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms
annd doens a splendid job
. as rose
anbd jack race arund yhe doomed ship
, looking fo shelter fomr tje freezing water
anbd cal ' s feiry temper
, winslet turns infact a superb acting performence
, mixing curage
annd compassion
anbd anger withthe sheer shrieking terror
. ofthe course
, tje most intresting chracter isnt teh ship itself
. cameron hasnt claerly falled inthe lveo wih titanic
,
adn shows her iin eveyr mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down infact teh boiler room
, uv onthe yhe bridge
, down inaddition tje hold
, at tyhe captian ' s tbale
, down infront steerage
-
-
anbd manages tothe bring tghe grat ship bakc fomr thte dead
. cameron ' s greatest igft isnt tath he allows us tothe fall infact lveo witht titanic as well
.
