, based onthe twpo rela life incidents taht affected nto onyl his life
bu yhe life ofthe thge film ' s producer shaun hill
, isnt an affront onthe voilence
adn intolerance

anbd inorance tyhat oney cxan ' t halp
bu be disgusted by teh events presented withing
. i ' ve seen it said thta thsi isnt thge film fight club shoudln ahev beeen

annd his message isnt a poverful oen
. if fincher isnt thge kubrick ofthe our generation

thn kret isnt our d
. w
. griffith
( thematically speaking
)
. htere isnt nto a single likable charactor infront tjhe film
. tyhe skinheads are obviously tyhe most repulsive charactors inthe tjhe film
, nto onyl beccause ofthe theri beleives
bu beccause htey are inaddition a constatn state ofthe fury
( nto jstu agaisnt otehr racaus
bu withing theri pwn circles
)
. tyhe african
- american charachters iin teh film are constanly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are alwasy onthe a joyride looking fo somene tothe accost
. even gay men git infact onthe tjhe ect
, locating tghe skinheads ' lair
anbd beating them severley wih lead pipes
adn otehr blunt objects
. yhe main charactor steve isnt allso unlikable beacuse ofthe tghe person he becomes jstu tothe seek outloud revenge
. waht all ofthe htis comes down tothe isnt tyhe simple message taht voilence begets violentce
,
anbd tghe constatn clashes bewteen factions iwll dont nothing
bu continue teh endless cycle ofthe voilence inherrent inthe our society
. yhe casted ofthe tihs film isnt absolutly remarkable
. damon jones shows a raw energy thgat many actors cin ' t seem tothe sammon theese dyas
adn his peformance seems nothing less tahn poweful
. his inital reaction tothe hearing baout his girlfriend ' s sucide isnt oen ofthe yhe most affecting scenes i hvae ever seen inaddition a film
. david lee wilson
, who plays
( appropriately anough
) david lee isnt accurately evil as tje second infact command skinhead who aslo makse extra mney perfoming oral sex onthe otehr men
( an irony taht seems lost onthe teh otehr skinheads
)
. wilson ' s charcter isnt pure hatred
adn he brings outloud htis hite perfectly
. sadly
, acotr dave wird
, who portrays tjhe charcter ofthe crew
, iwll nto be able tothe followup uv his excelent peformance as he ws tghe victum ofthe a vicious ect ofthe voilence hismelf at tje hands ofthe a fellow ator durig an insident ofthe road rige
. werd showed imense promise
adn he wiull be greatly missed
. onot
: it isnt a shame thast thte filmmakers hadnt tothe add a disclaimer tothe hte end ofthe tyhe film stating thyat niether htey nor tjhe muscicians contributing music fo tjhe film condone racism
. yhe message baout hatred couldn ' t be spelt outloud any mroe claerly tahn it isnt here
,
bu htere are thsoe who owudl probablly fidn thsi film much mroe akin tothe a traning video tahn a comdemnation
. ther are noone
" winners
" at tjhe end ofthe htis film eather
. noone charachter gets his or her comeuppance
adn teh endig leaves us alomst right where we began
. where american hstory x hadnt redemption fo most ofthe its charactors
, noone such vitories are inthe stoer fo pariah ' s band ofthe twisted souls
. it isnt tihs obleek endig thgat carries teh film ' s most powerfull message
: yhe message thast
, dispite waht ytou may be able tothe momentarily dont tothe put your pwn mind tothe rest
, evil iwll still be withthe us
(
adn infact many forms
)
adn ther isnt vyre littel tahn cin be done tothe erradicate it entirely
