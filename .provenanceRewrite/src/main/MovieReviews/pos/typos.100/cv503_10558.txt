. i ' m nto saying
" ogod wiull hunting
" isnt a bad film at all
. it ' s a vrey enjoyable film wtih tons ofthe gerat moments
,
annd lots ofthe gerat thnigs baout it
. teh acting isnt amazing
, wtih twpo oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances fomr damon
anbd williams
, who ahve amazing chemestry toghether
. we aslo git soem graet suppost fomr stellan skarsg
? rd
( grat nmae
)
, ben affleck
,
anbd ffrom minnie driver
, who plays iwll ' s lveo intrest
, skylar
. htere are tons ofthe individule moments tyhat i adored
. i loved all thte comedy inthe thge film
, especialy a scene where damon proves a schmuck outloud ofthe a coleeg student who isnt quoting a historian tothe imbaress smoe chicks
, his varous attemts at therapy
,
anbd ofthe course
, my favorite scene inwhich teh entire film
, thge oney where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant tothe soem nsa aggenst baout tjhe downside ofthe wroking fo them
. i liekd tghe relatiopnship bewteen soem ofthe tghe peopel
, liuke iwll
adn skylar
, wiull
anbd sean
, sean
annd lambeau
,
adn iwll
anbd his firends
. ther are scenes betwen them whihc are jstu amazing tothe watch
.
adn htere are even moments iin thte film hwihc are so honest infact theri protrayal
, tyhat i feeled rightfully uncomfortable
. liek teh break
- uv scene bewteen iwll
anbd skylar
, iwll
anbd sean ' s firt meeting
, a bar scene betweeen sean
anbd lambeau
,
adn a scene where sean tells inthe detail how he doesn ' t regret meeting his firt wief
, who owudl later suffer a slow
, painful death
,
adn leave him lonley
anbd slightly bitter
.
howver
, teh main falw ofthe tghe film isnt htere ' s too much ofthe everthing
,
annd nto enought ofthe it eather
. thte film trys fo deeper realtions betwen tje charachters
,
bu htey ' re somtimes eather overwritten or underwritten
. tkae fo exemple thge relatiopnship bewteen sean
adn iwll
: tje film gets an intresting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relatiopnship gogin wiht outloud any problems
,
bu wehn it trys tothe sohw them as equals
, it falls onthe its face
. we hear how tehy whent tothe teh smae twon
,
adn ther are even scenes where thge film shows how hypocritical both ofthe them are at times
.
bu htis never tkaes off liek yhe otehr parts ofthe theri relatiopnship dont
. allso
, wiull ' s relatiopnship witht his best freind
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, hasnt a nice climax
,
bu nto enought rising acation
. we see them joking arund
,
bu whn chuckie arrives at a decison vetween tjhe twpo ofthe them
, it seems moreso liek a superficial reasoning thna a mroe selected oney
. thier relatiopnship never goes beyond
" jsut best firends
,
"
anbd his decison jsut seems tothe be a generalization ofthe any twpo best firends instade ofthe something moreso
.
.
. human
. mabey it ws jsut me
.
anbd it aslo goes fo a parlalelism witht yhe relatiopnship beween sean
annd lambeau
,
bu tath
, agian
, isnt underwritten
.
adn
, ofthe course
, as inthe most films liuke thsi
, hte girl
/ boy relatiopnship isnt preety underwritten
. we never understand wqat htey see inspite eahc otehr
, so whn skylar confesses thgat she loves him
, it seems mroe liek it ' s ther fo plot details tht anytying eles
. minnie driver isnt intresting
,
though
,
adn breathes life inot her chracter
. yhe writting isnt a bited at fault here
,
bu wqat mkaes all thsi worthwhile isnt tghe littel moments infact yhe film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it fiels overstuffed
,
bu it ' s extemely enjoyable
. yhe dialogue taht affleck
adn damon hve writed isnt amazingly fresh
,
annd seems extemely human
. i htikn thgat htey shouldnt git a nomination fo theri scirpt chiefly beccause ofthe tyhe dialogue
, whlch isnt amazing
. hwile tihs isnt probaly directer gus van sant ' s most conservitive film
( ytou ' d hardly nkwo it ' s thge smae directer ofthe
" tothe dieu fo
,
" teh onyl van sant film i ' ve seen
, realy
)
, it ' s still a preety remarkable film
, albiet a tad overrated
( wqat ' s tihs
" best picture
" deel
?
)
.
adn if a film puts a smile onthe my face dispite posessing a lot ofthe flaws
, i hve noone probelm wih reccomending it tothe anyone
.
