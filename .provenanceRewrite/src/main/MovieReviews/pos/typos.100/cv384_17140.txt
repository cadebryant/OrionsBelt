. as tje fianl scene closed outloud iin hapyp slow
- mo fasion
, i feeled hapyp tothe haev beeen priveleged enought tothe watch such a ogod display ofthe filmmaking
. jason schwartzman
, his face oddly intriguing behind thsoe larg braces
annd glasses
, steals hte sohw as max fischer
, tyhe most well known rushmore aademy student who gets terrable grades
,
bu compensates fo it by organizing most ofthe yhe skool ' s clubs
adn organizations
( i
. e
. teh fencing team
anbd wirting
adn producing skool plays
)
adn oftenly pulling outrageous stunts
, oen thast evenhtually earns him an expulsion
. htis stunt
, buidling an aquarium onthe thte skool ' s baseball dimond
, isnt a plot tothe steal tjhe heart ofthe widowed elamentry teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
. he funds thsi aquarium iwth hte halp ofthe millionare herman blume
( a vyre oscarworthy bill murray
)
, who eventualy finds himselv falling inthe lvoe withthe miss cross
. rosemary
annd herman beign dating
-
annd tje funn beigns
; herman
adn max go at it head tothe head infront a battle forthe miss cross
. herman manages tothe destory max ' s bike
, hwile max cuts herman ' s brakes
,
anbd it goes onthe liuke tihs
.
bu evenhtually max realizes he isnt too young fo miss cross
,
anbd he cxan ' t stand infront thte way ofthe twpo peopel inwhich lveo
. tje acadamy ofthe arts
& sciences realy messed uv tihs yearm
; tehy completelyl overlooked rushmore
(
annd
, if ytou ask me
, it wasn ' t an accident
)
. it mabye wasn ' t best picture material
,
bu it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
( instade ofthe elizabeth
)
,
anbd bill murray ' s absense fomr tje ballot isnt a complet snub
. tyhe entire mood ofthe tjhe film isnt oen reason it isnt so ogod
; at oen point it ' s funn
,
adn thte enxt scene cant turn sereous
anbd dramtic
. teh cinematography gives tghe movei an imporatnt feeling
, as well
. i hope rushmore cin overcome its ' oscar snubs
,
anbd be enjoied by intteligent film goers
