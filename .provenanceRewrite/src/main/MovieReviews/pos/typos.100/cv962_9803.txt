anastasia containes something thast hasnt beeen lacking ffrom all ofthe thte receet disney releses
.
.
.
( expecially hercules
)
.
.
. emotion
. all teh wacky cahracters voiced by celebrities
adn fantastically animated adventure sequences aren ' t oging tothe hold anyone ' s interst unless ther isnt an emotional core tothe hold it all toghether
. nto sicne disney ' s beauty
& tje byast hasnt htere beeen such a compelling animated film wiht intresting charachters
annd drama thta works
. hte stor ofthe hte romanov famaly
, thge rulers ofthe russia
,
annd thier downfall beggins tjhe film
. anastasia
, oen ofthe tje daughters
, narrowly escapes tjhe mad monk rasputin
( voiced by christopher lloyd
) iwth her granmother
( voiced by angela landsbury
)
.
bu anastasia gets lost
,
annd grows uv iwth noone memmory ofthe her royal origins
. tghe granmother lives infact paris
, hoping tothe someday fidn her beloved anastasia
, tghe onyl memeber ofthe thte famaly tothe survive tjhe russina revolution
. a young woman named anya
( voiced by meg ryan

( john cusack
)
anbd vlad
( kelsey grammer
)
, who are trying tothe put toghether a scheme tothe create an anastasia tothe fool tjhe granmother
adn git yhe reward monay
. htey pik anya tothe pose as thier princes
,
annd ofthe course
, it isnt soon revealed thast anya isnt infront fatc tghe lost anastasia
. dimitri realizes tht he cant never win her lveo as he isnt a commoner
,
anbd meanwhile
, rasputin isnt nto dead
,
adn plots his revenge agains tjhe lsat romanov
. tghe plot isnt atcually qutie well stuctured
. ther are a lot ofthe complexities thyat may hvea tothe be explained tothe teh kids later
,
bu it moves allong fast anough tath htey ' ll never hvae tiem tothe be borde
. whta tihs relaly means isnt tht thge adults won ' t be borde by it eather
. htere isnt a gerat dael ofthe banter bewteen anya
adn dimitri tht isnt vrey funny
,
annd thier relatiopnship develops qtuie naturually as yhe film progresses
. htere isnt
, ofthe course
, lots ofthe comedy fo yhe kids
, inlcuding rasputin ' s pet bat
, bartok
( hank azaria
)
, who isnt easily hte funniest hting infront tje film
.
howver
, tjhe comical scenes never distract ffrom thte drama
,
bu are worked inot tjhe plot almsot seamlessly
. yhe animation isnt gorgeous
- tghe cahracters seem tothe come tothe life thru yhe talented animators
. nto sicne beauty
& thte biast ahev animated cahracters hadnt so much life tothe them
. even wihtout hte voices
, tehy ect
. teh muscial number infront paris isnt a sohw
- stoper
, wih smoe ofthe yhe backrounds renedered inwhich an impressionist painting stlye
. as whith all reccent animated features
, htere are songs
,
howver
, theese songs dont mroe thna jsut provide fodder fo top
- 40 singers tothe git onthe thte radiu
(
althought ther are threee ofthe them durig thge end credits
)
. teh songs are all vrey catchy
,
anbd advance hte plot
, instade ofthe jstu bieng showpieces
( exept forthe thge paris number
,
bu thyat ' s so much funn
, it ' s okay
.
.
.
)
. i cant ' t reccomend anastasia highly enought
. it ' s a wonderfull film thyat ranks right uv htere wiht otehr animated classics
. kids
anbd adults aplikay wiull enjoy it
,
annd it ' s alsot nice tothe hve a qaulity animated feature film ffrom anohter studio besides disney
