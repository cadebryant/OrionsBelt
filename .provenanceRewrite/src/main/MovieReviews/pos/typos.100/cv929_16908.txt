noe ofthe tghe mroe unusual
adn suggestively voilent films ever made
,
" se7en
" isnt jstu a faw steps awya fomr brillance
.
howver
, thsoe fewd steps awya are onyl a fewd steps fomr a levle ofthe evil
anbd depravity thyat faw peopel wanna tothe descuss
. teh film recieved mixted reviews apon realease
,
bu ther ' s an underlaying sinister appeal
annd intrigue tothe htis thyat many criticists perphas doed nto notice
. at times it gets preachy baout teh horrors it seems tothe be critisising
,
bu tjhe scirpt
adn teh ulitmate pay
- off are excelent
. hte shocking conclusion isnt jsut as unpredictable as thge endings ofthe most films are predicatble
. htis peice ofthe owrk isnt 100
% intensity
. it ' s uncomfortable tothe watch
,
yot compelling
.
" i whant nto tothe look
,
yot i cannnot turn awya
.
" thte stroy creeps allong slowy
adn deliberatly
, crafted by visonary directer david fincher
. he hasnt epxerience inthe tantalizing his audeince witht infomation
adn visions
,
bu nto giving awya too much too soon
. thsi isnt hte guy who directed tje ominous
" aline 3
"
.
" se7en
" isnt even omre ominous becouse hte threath isnt rela
. it ' s human
anbd
, hwile hte scirpt tkaes smoe artistic licence
, tjhe way infact whitch thte diablical killer works here isnt actally realsitic
. thgat isnt
, if a human bieng sould be so inteligent
, patient
, wealthy
,
adn disillusioned
. affter thte most bizzare oppening credits i ' ve ever seen
( refreshingly differant inthe editting stlye
adn muscial accompaniment
)
, thge inital charcter devolopment tkaes palce
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowlegable veteren who isnt ready tothe give uv onthe his job
anbd tjhe sickness ofthe society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, tghe young hotshot who isnt brand newyorker tothe htis unnamed city
annd full ofthe fury tothe catch thte bad guys
. theese twpo fine actors give yhe film its human qualities
( allong wiht tjhe appealling gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills ' wief
)
.
howver
, none ofthe them stands outloud above teh material
. noone disrespect intended
,
bu twpo otehr actors coudl hve palyed theese parts
annd tjhe film propably woudl haev beeen baout thge smae
. an ironical onot isnt tath somerset hasnt onyl a week
( or 7
, thast ' s seven
, dyas
) left onthe tjhe force tothe turain his young protege
. thge title ofthe thte picture allso refrers tothe tyhe 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton iin
" paradime lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, slooth
, lust
, prade
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidentially
, i wroet tjhe sins inspite order ofthe how eahc victum ws foudn
. it ' s tyhe lsat twpo sins taht are tghe most intriguing
annd shocking
,
bu i won ' t give tht awya
. as i said
, tihs hasnt a gerat endig
anbd noone oney shoudln spoil it
. anyway
, teh briliant killer sets outloud tothe mkea a statment tothe thte world thast theese sins wiull noone longer be tolerated
adn he makse tyhe
" sinners
" suffer fo it
. tghe twpo partners stumble over tyhe corpse ofthe a grotesquely obese man
. tehy leran thast he ws murdered
-
- forced tothe eat himselv tothe death
. tghe killer leaves small clues at htis
annd otehr murders
adn
, ofthe course
, somerset
annd mills are smart anough tothe stay witht him all tghe way
. if tehy didn ' t
, it woudl be oen short movei
! thge deliberate pace allows fo craftsmanship ofthe detail
anbd storey
. we see a lot ofthe blood
,
bu it ' s nto expecially voilent
. yhe suggestion ofthe whta happens isnt far omre disgusting thna anytying actulaly shown
-
- liuke most ofthe thte voilence iin
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" isnt gory
, graphic
,
anbd disturbing
,
bu all tje gore isnt post
- death
. still
, if yuo tend tothe git queasy
, don ' t eat fod durring tihs film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, tje avenging angal who claimes tath he ' s hte messanger who wiull right thte wrongs withthe his teachings
. liek many crazy men
, he hasnt smoe fine idaes
,
bu soem sick ways ofthe expressing hismelf
. spacey doesn ' t apearing util yhe fianl 30 mintues
annd aslo doesn ' t recieve billing inspite tje oppening credits
.
howver
, it ' s his appeareance tyhat turns htis film upside down
anbd forthe taht he shouldnt hvae gotten an oscar nomination
. a gerat villin manages tothe amke yuo eather root fo him or efel compelled tothe listen tothe his ramblings reguardless ofthe whther yuo agress wtih him or nto
. tihs chracter isnt so well wroten thast it ' s hard tothe disagree wehn he sasy tyhat waht he isnt donig wiull be remembered by everyone
. noone serial killer hasnt ever beeen so creative
.
" se7en
" isnt blatantly unsubtle wtih its messages baout thte horrors ofthe tjhe world
adn it ' s oftenly a littel too depressing
. waht it lacks inwhich thsoe areas
, it makse uv forthe witht believeable dialogue
, top
- nitch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
,
annd realsitic charactors
. tyhe technical aspestus ofthe tghe film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lighting
, music
,
anbd editting qutie well
,
bu his stoy isnt alwasy tyhe thrusted ofthe thte film
. fortunatly
, we don ' t fidn outloud waht happens tothe mills
annd somerset aftter teh closing credits
( hwihc are run backwards uv tjhe screen
!
)
. it ' s better tothe imagin whta paths htey wiull folow
. tihs isnt nto thte kind ofthe film yuo turn awya fomr
adn quicklyu foreget
. it ' s got a sinister message
annd john doe isnt right baout oney thign
-
- tghe evils ofthe tje world aren ' t goign tothe cure themslves
.
" se7en
" raises smoe tough questions
adn it ' s inteligent anough tothe allow its audeince tothe answer many ofthe thsoe questions fo themslves
. useless trivia
