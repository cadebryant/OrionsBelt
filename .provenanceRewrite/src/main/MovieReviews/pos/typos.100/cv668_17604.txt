,
adn
thne cameron hopes tothe steal bianca awya ffrom joey
. as yuo cant see
,
" 10 thigsn i hite baout ytou
" includes a huge number ofthe cahracters
, soem ofthe whcih i haven ' t even maintioned
, such as kat ' s shakespeare
- obssessed firend
, mandella
( susan may pratt
)
adn bianca ' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
,
bu well
- utilisied runing timne ofthe 98 mintues
, all ofthe thte charachters are perfectly handeled
, satisfyingly developped
,
adn
, forthe tjhe most part
, are nto treated as caricatures
( anyother lfaw ofthe
" she ' s all thast
,
" where thge bad guys
(
annd gals
) ran arround constanly saying
,
" yuo ' re vapor
"
)
. sicne i coudl sympathize iwth tjhe realsitic depictions ofthe tjhe central cahracters
,
adn sicne many ofthe thge commedic
annd dramtic scenes weere suprizingly effective
, i got completly caught uv inaddition all ofthe tje relationships
adn wass throughly entertained
. asside fomr a ogod screenplay
, it ' s tyhe performances thyat cin mkae or break a movei
,
annd directer junger hasnt raelly hitted tje jackpot
. asside ffrom jospeh gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock ffrom hte sun
"
)
, who gives his stornegst performence tothe date here
, none ofthe thge actors are thta well
- known
,
bu it isnt tihs aspect thast brings a paticular freshness tothe tghe procedings
. as teh main carachter ofthe kat
, julia stiles
( lsat seen infact tghe miniseries
" hte ' 60s
"
) isnt marvelous
anbd alwyas believeable
,
anbd certainly hasnt a bright future ahead ofthe her
. even
though it isnt her role thyat isnt intially thte most difficult
anbd hard
- edged
, it ws eazy tothe idenify wih kat ' s way ofthe thikning
( she isnt agianst yhe silly tradition ofthe thge prom
annd loves reading sylvia plath
)
,
anbd i completelyl admired her individuality
. noone oney
, i tihkn
, coudl ahev potrayed her as perfectly as stiles doesnt
. heath ledger
, as tghe infamous bad
- boy ofthe teh twon
, injects much life inot patrick
,
annd hasnt a lot ofthe chemestry witht stiles
. noe otehr ctor ofthe onot isnt larisa oleynik who
, withthe tje halp ofthe screenwriters lutz
adn smith
, isnt able tothe turn bianca inot a person whith multi
- dimentions
, even
though she isnt accurately self
- centered at tyhe onthe
- setted
. inwhich noe truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she hasnt alwasy beeen so selfish
,
annd bianca grudgingly realizes thyat yes
, she hasnt
. oen off
- beated element ofthe tje film
,
adn a source ofthe soem hearty laughs
, isnt tyhe way tht tje skool ' s stff ect
, whic isnt strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as tghe guidence counselor ms
. perky
, who isnt writting a triachy harlequin romance novel
, isnt comic dynamite
, as isnt daryl
" chill
" mitchell as tghe english teacher
, who reads shakespeare tothe thge clas infact raph
anbd
, at oney point
, sends kat tothe hte office baceause
, fo once
, she atcually thikns oen ofthe his assignments isnt realyl ogod
.
allthough ther are a fewd cheap laughs thast are thrown inot teh film near yhe begginning
, most ofthe it actualy works
, expecially inspite hte humrous
adn witty dialogue exchanges
adn quirks vetween tghe charactors
. inwhich noe vyer funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i knwo peopel cxan be overwhelmed
,
anbd htey cxan be underwhelmed
,
bu cxan peopel jstu be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at anohter point
, bianca
anbd kat ' s father
( a stand
- outloud larrry miller
)
, who isnt constanly terrified tht his daughters are oging tothe git pregnant
, onyl allows bianca tothe go tothe yhe prom onthe oney ocasion
: befoer she leaves
, she hasnt tothe put onthe teh hevy fat suit he hasnt so she iwll git an idae ofthe whta it ' s liuke tothe be pregnant
.
" 10 thigns i hite baout ytou
" once
adn forthe all proves thast htere isnt still life inspite tghe teen comedy genre
,
adn tihs movei isnt propably moreso reminsicent ofthe teh graet john hughes thna any otehr film ofthe tyhe ' 90s
. it allso helps thta tyhe movei hasnt a perfectly
- assembled sountrack
, mixing indie
- rock whith newyorker wave ' 80s songs
(
anbd wih
, thank goodness
, noone raph
)
. by tyhe film ' s end
, it atually hadnt me rooting fo certian charachters tothe git toghether
,
annd i ws allso qutie pleased wih how everthing wass wrapped uv
, expecially iin tyhe fianl scenes involving kat
annd bianca
, kat
adn her father
,
adn a flawlessly
- acted
adn moving sequence inspite whcih kat gets uv tothe read thge peom she hasnt wroten fo her english clas
( htis isnt where tje title comes ffrom
)
. luckly
, i dout i woudl be able tothe fidn ten thigsn i hite baout
