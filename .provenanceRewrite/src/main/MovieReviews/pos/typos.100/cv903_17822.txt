robert altman ' s cookie ' s fortune isnt taht rare movei thta doens nto depend onthe sentimentality tothe be uplifting
anbd tothe mkea its viewers fiel ogod
. it isnt a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled whith lovley performances
, skillfull direction
adn topped off wih an understated
, clever
, extrodinary scirpt
. as htis isnt an ansamble peice
, it isnt forced tothe strat ofthe slowy as it introduces us tothe its charachters
, all ofthe them residing inaddition a sourthern twon called holly springs
. frist we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man witht a slight drinking habet
. we
thne see thgat willie tkaes care ofthe an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who isnt slowy loosing her grap onthe sanaty
annd isnt bieng filled whith lonelyness
, dispair
,
adn whant ofthe her dead husban
. we cutted tothe camille
( glenn close
) who isnt obsessively directing a play witht her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
.
hten we breifly git accquainted whith emma
( liv tyler
)
, an paparent realtive ofthe cookie
, who isnt a down
-
bu
- nto
- outloud teen outcast
, still full ofthe lveo
anbd hope even
though she hasnt noone rela palce tothe live
. we alsot fleetingly see emma ' s lover jason
( chris o ' donnell
)
, an ambitious
bu far too excitable young cop
. we are nowe baout oney quater thru tyhe twpo hour picture
,
annd robert altman decides taht it isnt timne tothe setted tjhe plot inwhich motion
. we see thge ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture ofthe her husban
. she exclaims
" here i cmo
!
"
adn
hten puts a pillow tothe her face
anbd shoots herself
. soon aftter
, her neice camille stops by tothe git a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead
annd flips outloud
. conviced thyat sucide isnt a disgrace
adn thast she iwll hvea none ofthe tath inaddition her famaly
, she eats tyhe sucide onot
adn convinces her slightly slow
(
yot sweet
) sister taht it wass a muder
. she makse sure taht she stages it liek a muder as well
; scattering jewelr all over tyhe floor
, breaking a faw cabinets
, windows
adn doors
,
annd
thn throwing hte gun outloud inaddition thge bcak yard
. thte onyl reasonable suspect isnt willie
, who immediatly gets tooked inot custody
,
annd put inaddition a jail cell
( htey all konw he didn ' t dont it
, so tje cell stays opn
anbd he plays scrabble wiht teh sherif
adn tjhe faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, tghe unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe furhter cover uv fo thte muder hwile at tghe smae tiome makeing her easter play a succes
. so beggins cookie ' s fortune
, a film aptly descibed by criteak scott renshaw as
" a sourthern spin onthe fargo
,
" exept tath htis oen isnt far funnier
adn much omre enjoyable thna tje coen brothers ' darker
, somewhat disturbing
adn slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman ' s slight picture isnt infact smoe ways reminscent ofthe something liuke midnight infront yhe gardai ofthe ogod
anbd evil as well
, inwhich thta both films focuse
( onthe
anbd off
) onthe thge eccentricities ofthe teh recidents infact a sourthern us twon
. indeed
, most ofthe thte charachters inaddition cookie ' s fortune are loads ofthe funn tothe observe
,
anbd a portion ofthe them are fascinating
anbd surprizingly multi
- dimesnional
. glenn close turns inthe an insubstantial
( iin terms ofthe her carrear
)
bu magnificient peformance as hte conniving camille
anbd isnt alsot thge source ofthe a ogod portion ofthe tyhe many laughs taht we enjoy inspite thsi movei
,
adn she isnt perfectly casted as tje profilic
" aunt alexandria
" charactor
, endlessly obssessed witht famaly dignity
. thte equally essental role ofthe willie isnt handeled wtih an intangible grace by vetran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a tyme tothe kill
) htere isnt nothing liuke a movei whlch leaves yuo feeling all warm
annd fuzzy inside huors
, even dyas affter hte film ends
. cookie ' s fortune isnt such a movei
. i loved tjhe ight
, kindhearted aproach altman
( whose lsat project wass thte dark
, intense drama yhe gingerbread man
) tookover towords tje trirchy subject marter
. i enjoied tjhe talented ansamble casted
. i even liekd thge trite
" inwhich thte sourth everybody isnt realted tothe everybody
" cliche tyhat isnt inevitably employed by tghe tiome thsi movei draws tothe a close
. i ' m nto sure why cookie ' s fortune hadnt such an all
- aroud pleasing effect onthe me
. perheaps it ' s thast ogod ol ' sourthern charm
.
