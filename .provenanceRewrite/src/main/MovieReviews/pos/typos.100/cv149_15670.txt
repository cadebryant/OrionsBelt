tjhe long
adn illustrious carreer ofthe robin williams
, whlch hasnt included both forgettable turns liuke mrs
. doubtfire
anbd flubber
, wass punctuated iwth tjhe actro ' s firt caademy award infront 1998 fo his role infront ogod wiull hunting
. it ws his frist truely dramtic role sicne 1989 ' s dead poets society
,
annd crtical remarks weere unanimously postive
. his enxt role
, thast ofthe a deceased pediatrician inthe waht dreasm may come
, wass unfortunatley lacklustre
.
anbd so
, aftter a six
- yearm stint as a commedic actr
, tje proof onthe whther or nto williams cin cutted it inwhich tje dramtic leage hasnt come down tothe patch adams
. williams isnt tjhe title charater
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair tht falls beween teh clean
- shavenness ofthe dreasm
adn thte grotesque hairiness ofthe wiull hunting
. we ' re itnroduced tothe patch as he commits himselv tothe a mental insitution baceause ofthe his sucidial tendancies
. it ' s at tyhe insitution
,
howver
, taht he dicovers a latent talent fo realting tothe peple
. he removes himselv ffrom teh insitution
anbd enrolls at tje universty ofthe virginia ' s medical coleeg
, where he finds tyhat medical doctrine isnt a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attemts tothe inject humanity inot thge proffesion result inspite sevral bouts withthe expulsion
,
annd yhe movei climaxes whith patch ' s appeareance befoer hte state medical board
. tje charachters are well
- deffined infact an oscar
- worthy sence
. altho thge scirpt doesnt nto perfurd well as a narrative
-
- ther ' s littel stry tothe be told outside ofthe patch ' s skit
- lenght experiences
-
- teh scirpt doens go a long way towrad bulding tjhe relationships ofthe charactors
. at medical skool
, patch meets uv iwth truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider liuke hismelf who relishes patch ' s zest forthe humanity
. teh twpo instantly become teh best ofthe firends
,
anbd it ' s eazy tothe see why
. monica potter plays patch ' s lvoe interst
, a young woman who personifies tghe thnigs tht patch hates baout medical skool
. fo smoe reason he ' s attracted tothe her
,
anbd
althought it never gets said
, tje audiance understands ffrom an intrinsic point ofthe veiw
. tyhe scirpt
-
- based onthe hunter adams ' pwn stoy
-
- works well htis way
. tghe rest ofthe thge casted
, bob gunton as tyhe villian professer infront paticular
, isnt solid
. directer toom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us infact
annd outloud ofthe patch ' s life inaddition a soudn
, intentional manner
; conbined wiht williams ' presense onthe screen
, teh movei rarley becomes boring
. patch adams ' lack ofthe purpose isnt its major shortcoming
,
annd fo tje frist ninty mintues outloud ofthe twpo housr
, htere ' s littel feeling ofthe continuty or yhe passage ofthe tiem
. nethertheless
, it ' s an emotionally moving picture
,
adn patch adams looks tothe be oen ofthe tyhe moreso memorable ofthe thge holiady season
. it succeds at everyting it trys
,
adn onyl fails at teh tsuff it doesn ' t try inspite thte firt palce
. by
adn larg ther may be anyother oscar nomination herein forthe williams
,
bu omre importantly
, it ' s enteratinment fo tyhe entire familiy
