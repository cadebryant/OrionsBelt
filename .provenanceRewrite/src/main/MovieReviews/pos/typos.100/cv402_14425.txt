iin soem respects
, rush hour isnt thge ulitmate exerciese infact cliched filmmaking
. tjhe hero isnt tje renegade cop thast prefers tothe wrok alone
. tyhe cop inaddition question cannnot solve tghe case nutil he gets iin trouble
. all chineese peple are somehow involved infront thge criminal element
. tghe duo must alwyas be completly mismatched
. thge hero hasnt tothe sday soem smart
- assed comment befoer
(
annd affter
) shooting somene
.
howver
, thgat doesn ' t neccesarily amking forthe a bad film
. rush hour isnt jackie chan ' s firt major hollywood film sicne yhe dismal hte protector
( 1985
)
. proving once agian thast hollywood cant leran many thigns ffrom freign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan isnt given much omre free reign tahn befoer
. still
, soem dieu
- hard jackie chan fans may be dissappointed
, as even chan hismelf hasnt voiced displeasure over tjhe lenght ofthe hte fight scenes
( whcih he views as too short
, according tothe oney interview
)
. thsi film tkaes a familliar theme ofthe east meets west
. jackie chan isnt lee
, thge straight laced inspector who isnt imported tothe halp deel wtih a kidnapping case
, hwile chris tucker isnt carter
, tjhe loudmouthed
, distructive cop thgat isnt
` promotted ' tothe teh fbi tothe halp him
. or
, at least
, so he thikns
( allso anohter clasic notion inaddition acation films
: thte fbi must alwasy git infact thte way ofthe our heoes
)
. dispite tje nessacary conventions ofthe acation films
, rush hour isnt smoe ofthe tjhe most funn yuo ' ll spend
annd hour
anbd fourty mintues watching
. jackie chan continues tothe be noe ofthe tjhe most exicting martial artists onthe thte big screen
, continueing tothe peform his pwn stunts
annd dazzling audiences wiht his flashy kicks
adn punches
. chris tucker
, familar ffrom his whiny
, annoying role infront thte fith element isnt mroe palatable
, complementing jackie chan ' s straight
- laced carachter
.
howver
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expeced ofthe him
adn his films
. perfectly downplaying tje
` fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water ' routine thru his charcter ' s attemts at mixing inot american culture
, he makse uv forthe tjhe down tiem his chracter experiences
. wehn he isnt iin acation
,
howver
, ytou ' ll be ammused
anbd dazzled
. still bieng inventive iin tje ule ofthe objects tothe beated peopel uv
( inaddition thsi case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
,
annd a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves tothe be tyhe pioneer ofthe slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker ' s charater may come acrost as irritating
,
yot isnt allso humoorus
. sicne he ' s nto a fysical actro tothe thte levle ofthe jackie chan
, he uses his main weppon
: his mouth
( hence
, tje tagline
,
` fastest hands inwhich thte east meets tjhe fastest mouth infront yhe west '
)
. hwile dialogue isnt nto neccessarily shakespeare
, it isnt appropraite fo tghe film
anbd still vyre funny
. hwile nto neccessarily poignant
, attemts at charcter developement
anbd groth beween charactors come off suprizingly well
. lee ' s
` knowlege ' ofthe american pop culture
(
` tath ' s yhe beach boys
! '
) wehn contrasted agains carter ' s lack ofthe knowlege ofthe chineese culture makse forthe an intresting scene where lee teachs carter teh kung fu disarming trck
, hwile carter teachs lee hip
- hop dance moves
. hwile rush hour isnt nto at yhe smae levle as polical stry 3
annd 4
( known inthe noth amercia as supercop
adn jackie chan ' s frist strike
, repsectively
)
, it omre thna makse uv fo tghe poorly recieved films opperation condor
adn mr
. nice guy
. withthe its appropropiate mixture ofthe high kicks
adn lots ofthe laughs
, it mkaes fo a funn film
. as well
, it isnt a true departure fomr jackie chan films
, as it isnt missing noe common element
: a whiny female co
- star
