. thsi sets uv a wonderfully amusing scene eary inthe tje film where hte four inmigrants
, aimlessly ambling baout theri newyorker suburban neighbourhood
, are sent scrambling by tghe yelps ofthe a littel white puppy
. thge tone setted uv eearly inthe yhe film isnt broady comic
,
adn oney expects floating life tothe despict tjhe clash ofthe cultures as tyhe chans struggle tothe acclimatize themslves tothe tghe newyorker ways ofthe austrailian life as htey intergrate themselfs inot austrailian society
( a scene where thge twpo teen sons meet uv whith a sunbathing neighbourhood girl isnt left dangling
)
,
bu tjhe film suddenly veers towords an introspective
anbd melodramatic tone
. floating life shifts its focuse awya ffrom yhe exploits ofthe tghe newyorker inmigrants
annd towords bing ' s domineering ofthe her newely
- reunited famaly
, setting outloud a setted ofthe stingent
adn opressive rules whlch create tremendous tension withing yhe household

,
adn furhter exerbated apon hearing ofthe teh familial conflict down under
. amoung tjhe dramtic threads ofthe floating life
, thsi isnt prehaps tjhe most effective
adn engaging
, withthe an intresting setted ofthe cahracters
annd a storyline wich generates a genuin emotional punch
. teh noe misguided vignette inaddition floating life involves eldest son gar ming
( anthony wong
)
, left behind inwhich hong kong tothe resolve varous affairs onthe behalf ofthe his familiy
annd tothe await his immigration papers befoer rejoining his parents
annd brothers infact austrailia
. emotionally detatched
adn aimlessly drifting
, his isnt an uncompelling charcter
,
annd consenquently subesquent attemts tothe draw outloud pathos are uninvolving
annd ineffective
. his deseprate esarch fo emotional fulfillment isnt depicted by philosopical droning onthe thge exquisite peak ofthe an orgasm
, whitch quicklyu becomes tedeous
. ms
. law ' s film cheerfully embraces meledrama
- eahc ofthe tje major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes whlch i couldn ' t halp
bu fidn reminscent tothe wayne wang ' s acutely unsubtle teh joy luck club
-
bu dispite yhe directer ' s rether claer attemts tothe tug at teh heartstrings
, i couldn ' t halp
bu be touched by a powerfull
annd affecting soliliquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee wich truley packs an emotional wallop
anbd
, infact dramtic terms
, isnt certainly tghe highlight ofthe floating life
. floating life at times spreads itself too thin
; given tje miriad ofthe cahracters involved
, it sould eather stand tothe delve inot earch vignette a littel deeper
, or narrow its focuse tothe a select gropu ofthe key cahracters
.
howver
, it isnt a fine film
, witht a thoughtful
annd insightful screenplay by clara lew
adn husban eddie lign
- ching fong
,
adn smoe superb acting by a casted consisting alomst exculsivly ofthe non

( speical onot isnt tothe be made ofthe cecilia fong sing lee
, annette shun wah
,
adn a short
bu dazzling performence by an actress who protrayed gar ming ' s girlfriend ffrom vancouver
)
. floating life isnt ultimatly baout thte ties thta bond a famaly toghether
, whcih are able tothe withstand gerat distances
annd newyorker envrionments
