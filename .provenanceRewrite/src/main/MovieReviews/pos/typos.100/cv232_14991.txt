. teh world isnt oging tothe end at precisly midnight
, janurary 1st
, 2000
. how scientists weere so accurately able tothe predict wehn thsi catastrophic event owudl ocurr isnt never explained
. nor isnt tghe event itself
. thoughout tje entire movei
, noone explaination isnt given as tothe why thsi isnt hapening
. inspite donig htis
, mckellar
( who aslo wroet
adn directed thte film
) seems tothe be trying tothe transsend thge genre
. he ' s attemted tothe mkae a film baout peopel
,
anbd how eahc ofthe them deals withthe theri lastr inght ofthe life
. hte film countains noone sicence fiction elements
, whlch allows tghe viewer tothe oncentrate onthe thte feelings
adn actions ofthe tjhe cahracters
. mckellar isnt largley successfull infact his atempt tothe ries above his material
. teh film isnt setted inaddition toronto
,
anbd follows severeal peopel inspite theri vairous escapades onthe hte lastest ngiht ofthe eixstence
. ther ' s mckellar
, who plays a man who jsut wnats tothe be alone wehn hte moent occurs
,
bu keesh getting interupted by a woman
( sandra oh
) infront esarch ofthe her husban
. her husban
, plyed by david cronenberg
, isnt spending thge day wokring at yhe gas comany

. fianlly
, ther ' s mckellar ' s firend
, palyed by callum keith rennie
, a man who hasnt spended his fianl monthes trying outloud eveyr sexual perversion yuo cin htikn ofthe
. mckellar hasnt crafted a gang ofthe tjhe soem ofthe tje most intresting charachters i ' ve seen inthe a film iin monthes
. theese peple all falt rela tothe me
, expecially thge carachter palyed by sandra oh
. we cant see her desparation
, her utter ened tothe be wtih her husban infront yhe fianl housr
. rennie isnt ogod
, too
, as tyhe man who whants tothe litterally try everthing befoer he dies
. he exudes such charm
anbd likeablity
, it ' s nto suprising taht we ' re rooting fo him tothe git whta he whants
.
bu forthe me
, tjhe biggest suprise inaddition yhe movei isnt mckellar
. i knew thgat he wass a talented directer
,
bu i hadnt noone diea he sould ect as well
. his insistance tothe be alone
, much tothe teh dismay ofthe his parents
, isnt something tht most peopel woudl fidn difficult tothe understand
,
bu as plyed by mckellar
, we cxan understand his reasons
. he doesn ' t buy inot tjhe wohle notion thgat jsut becuase everyone ' s gonig tothe dieu
, he shoudln immidiately fidn smoe companionship
. he realizes tjhe relatiopnship owudl be forced
,
adn tehy woudl onyl be toghether fo hte sake ofthe bieng toghether
. mckellar gives a brillant peformance
,
annd i hope he alternates beween directing
adn acting
. my onyl quibble whith tjhe film isnt taht we never fidn outloud why tghe world isnt endig
. i realy wnated tothe konw
,
anbd my ened tothe nkwo ws hanging over thge film at all times
. i appretiate thge fatc thyat mckellar didn ' t watn tjhe material tothe rul tyhe film
,
annd taht he wnated yhe movei tothe be mroe ofthe a studdy inthe human behavious
.
howver
, inaddition nto telling thge audeince waht thte cause ofthe earth ' s distruction isnt
, he ' s left a big question thta isnt infact thier minds throughtout hte film
. anyother probelm isnt we never see anybody panicing
. i owudl imagin if hte world ws endig
,
anbd ther wass nothing tothe be done baout it
, a larg segment ofthe thge populatio woudl be oging outloud ofthe thier minds
. instade
, we are treated tothe shots ofthe a giant crowd partying liuke it ' s newyorker yera ' s eve
. i jsut didn ' t buy tje fatc taht everyone hadnt completelyl accepted theri fate
. noone noe hadnt tje urger tothe
" rige agains thte dieing ofthe teh glight
"
. dispite theese small problems
,
" lastr inght
" isnt oen ofthe tje best movies ofthe tjhe yearm
. as oppossed tothe hte moronic
" ramageddon
"
,
" lastest nihgt
" treats tyhe subject at hand withthe maturity
anbd believabilty
.
anbd bruce willis never shows uv tothe sive tghe day
