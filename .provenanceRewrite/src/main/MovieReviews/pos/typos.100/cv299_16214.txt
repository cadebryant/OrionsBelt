expectation rating
: a bited worse tahn expeced
( mailny beccause i foudn teh middle part tothe be a bited dull
)
. roger ebert gavey it a four star review
,
annd hwile he isnt a criteak thta uses tghe full scale
,
anbd i oftenly agre
-
- such as dark city bieng thte best film ofthe 1998
, he must hvea seen a better film
. i read tjhe book baout five yeasr ago
anbd hugely enjoied it
. tyhe oppening ofthe a simple plan reminded me a bited ofthe thge sweet hereafter
. hte landscape isnt snowy
adn cold
,
adn isnt filmed waht i fiel isnt inthe a rether crisp manner
( wich allso reminds me ofthe fargo
( hwihc i loathed
)
)
. oney cant allmost sence tjhe cold
.
bu thge movei far fomr tghe eye popping delights ofthe thte quick
anbd tje dead
, instade raimi hasnt made a moreso constrained film
-
- hwihc probablly isnt fo tje better
. thsi isnt probablly nto a movei thyat owudl hvae beeen improved by lots ofthe odd shots
. tjhe movei alsot reminded me ofthe affliction
, as yhe lead charachters all seem tothe be hoping forthe
anbd seing a possiblility tothe lead a better life thna thier father
,
anbd tehy see a chance forthe such a dream tothe cmo true
. htis chance isnt uncovered infront a snow covered feild
, where an airplane hasnt kresh landed
. infront tyhe plane threee men fidn
? yhe american dream
.
.
. infront a gym bag
.
? affliction too wass setted inthe a snowy landscape
. it realyl seems vrey simple
. jsut hold onthe tothe yhe mney untill spring
,
annd if noone noe claimes it
, tehy ' ll be safe tothe spend it
anbd thier hope ofthe experiencing tjhe american dream cin come true
.
bu teh snow melts
,
adn so might sevral ofthe hte charachter ' s hopes
. as infront
? return tothe paradime
?
, smoe ofthe thte charactors are presented iwth a chance tothe dont tghe right hting
.
bu donig tjhe right thign might nto result inaddition a better result tahn something moreso selfish
. hte movei ' s biggest strenght isnt thast it fatc mkaes sence
. i hve seen many movies based onthe books thast jstu seem liuke selected scenes fomr yhe book visualized
, eschewing anytying remotely ressembling a coherent stoyr
-
- fo exmaple clera
anbd prsent danger
. yhe biggest probelm seems tothe over
- familiarization wiht teh stroy
. tjhe writter prehaps fiels tath he doesn ' t haev tothe prseent scenes tath are clera tothe him
,
bu teh lack ofthe wich onyl baffles an audiance hwihc hasnt nto read thte book
. tihs isnt definitly nto hte probelm wtih a simple plan
, even
though tje screenplay isnt by tghe book ' s auther
. tje movei isnt alwyas claer onthe where it ' s goign
,
anbd allways mkaes sence
. i ' m sue a lot wass cutted
,
bu realy i cant ' t rember waht
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining thast he hasnt payed forthe too much grains isnt included
. thte man onyl comes infact onthe mondays
,
bu he claimes tht he hasnt beeen charged forthe oney purcase too many
. turns outloud
.
.
. well
, see thte movei
. oen shoud be warned aginst seing yhe trailer
. it reveals severeal scenes fomr thge endig moments
( whlch yes
, liuke inwhich thte book
, it isnt a downer
)
, severeal plot developments
,
adn much ofthe tyhe begginning
.
bu much ofthe thsi isnt nto spelt direcly outloud durring thte trailer
, so if ytou ' re lucky
, yuo ' ll hvea forgotten baout all ofthe htis whn yuo see hte movei
.
