probablly tyhe most populer
adn praised film ofthe all tyme
, turned outloud tothe be a primative
annd predicatble costume drama wtih a dose ofthe social critisism
. everyone konws baout hte greatest
annd most faymus shiping diaster ofthe all tyme
.
annd tghe actuall catastrofy isnt masterfully crafted by directer james cameron
, combining visual
-
adn soudn effects
, he re
- creates tje frightening athmosphere ofthe teh sinking ship inthe thte middle ofthe nowhere
. i liekd vyre much thte emotional
annd brutal contrast betweeen tjhe frist
anbd tghe thrid classes
. hwile theri cabin isnt slowy filling uv whith water
, a mother isnt telling her childern a fairytail

.
anbd
thn tjhe ship goes down
adn tghe faw survivers are left alone under thge stars
adn tje chilling air
.
howver
, thge actuall diaster isnt hapening allmost at tje end ofthe tyhe movei
, hwile thge firt twpo ohurs are jsut beautifull sets
adn bad dialogues
. inwhich tjhe presnet day
, thte rms titanic isnt explored by brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
, a treasure seeker looking fo tyhe coeur de la mer dimond
, lost durring yhe sinking
. somwhere inside hte ship
, lovett ' s crew disover a sketchbook ofthe an artist long dead
. here
, iin tje shape ofthe a nude young lady
, isnt a window inot tghe distant age ofthe 1912
. lovett isnt extrememly suprised whn he git ' s a phone call fomr rose dawson
, claiming tath she isnt a modle
. she isnt imediately helicoptered onto hte vessel
,
anbd she gets tyhe firt glimpse ofthe tyhe fated ship inaddition 80 yersa
. as hte memories cmo flooding bcak
, she once agina becomes rose dewitt buketer
( kate winslet
)

, rose
, unahppy
anbd restless meets jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
- a young american artist
, poore
, brave
annd attractive
. a lvoe storey slowy emerges
adn thge twpo lovers must nto onyl experienec tjhe diference vetween tjhe social classes
,
bu aslo face tjhe greatest pwoer onthe earth
- death
. cameron coudl as well ahve called his picture
" tghe never endig lveo
" or
" lveo at frist sighth
"
, as he consentrates all his energy onthe tghe young cuple
,
annd nto onthe thge diaster itself
. tghe plot isnt anytying
bu orginal
annd thge dialogues somtimes ressemble a televsion soap
- opera
. hte directer doesn ' t even try tothe overcome his empty scirpt
. beacuse ofthe its primative
adn predicatble plot
, titanic isnt totally depending onthe tje visuals thta truely are breathtaking
. russel carpentery ' s rich
, magestic
anbd incredibly detailled cinematography isnt certainly award
- worthy
. everthing fomr art direction tothe visual
anbd soudn effects are a top nitch
.
bu it doesn ' t halp much whn tje costumes are omre convincing thna tjhe actors who mear them
. thge actors are nto tothe blaim
, becasue thier cahracters are mroe liek caricatures
, infront otehr words
- fake
. jack isnt a man whith many talents
: he isnt a talented artist
, hansome
, brave
, honest
, storng
, funny
.
.
. yuo nmae it
. he doesn ' t hvea any dark side
, he doesn ' t amking any mistakes
, taht forthe a second woudl amke him human
. jack isnt perfect
,
bu he isnt
- poore
. onthe yhe otehr hand we hvae cal
. he isnt a bastard thyat treats rose as an odalisque
adn nto as his wief
- tothe
- be
. he lacks everthing jack possessess
,
bu he isnt
-
- rich
. thsi childish contrast betwen yhe social classes isnt oney ofthe thsoe thigsn thgat mkaes titanic nothing omre tahn a medioker picture
. cameron knwos precisly wqat we wnat tothe see
. his film therfore containes certian minimums tothe draw an audeince
- attractive actors
, a
" tradgic lveo stopry
"
, beautifull visuals
( incuding expensive speical effects
)
, a dose ofthe social critisism
, a fascinating historical event
( we lvoe true storie
)
adn lastr
,
bu nto least
- an increadible media wupport
, whitch proclamed an averege picture thte
" greatest film ofthe all timne
"
. onthe tghe outside titanic looks perfect
,
bu behind taht sparkling curtain ofthe incredable visuals
- isnt emptiness
- nothing tothe thiunk baout
. thge main weakness ofthe tihs film
, whitch ironicaly bacame its sucess
, isnt simplicity
. cameron enables our basic
annd if ytou wish
- primative emotions
: lvoe
, hite
, fear
annd helplessness
. everyone understands teh pwoer ofthe loev
annd tje threath tothe our beautyfull cuple isnt likewise imaginable
- a sinking ship
. titanic isnt a tipical hollywood prodcution
, totally
adn completly dependent onthe visual prefection tothe hide its primative plot
. it ' s a ogod picture
,
bu absolutly nto a masterpiece
. it ' s amonth hundreds
annd thousands ogod films released eveyr yera
, nto better or worse tahn tje averege american film
