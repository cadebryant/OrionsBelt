, setted infront a realsitic high skool enivoriment
, wiht yhe basketball championships as tyhe backdrop
annd an impending sence ofthe doom as it core
. ytou aslo hvea tothe give it uv tothe all ofthe thte actors inthe thsi film
, who turn over smoe veyr convincing performances
, tkaing ytou thru all ofthe theri charachters ' ups
adn downs
. hartnett expecially shoud be applauded fo tkaing onthe such a dispicable carachter
, a dued who ytou jstu wnat tothe grab by teh throat
adn beated yhe shit outloud ofthe
( sign ofthe a ogod acotr
, if yuo ask me
)
. phifer allso comes tothe play inaddition thsi movei
, witht a nice blend ofthe charizma
, fear
, lveo
adn anger spreaded over his charactor
. i ws allways onthe thsi guy ' s side
adn definately feeled sory fo him as thigsn moved allong
. julia stiles wass allso ogod
,
bu her charcter wasn ' t much diffrent ffrom others thast she ' s palyed recently
. i wass
howver veyr suprised witht martin sheen ' s showing
, sicne i hadn ' t taked him too seriously as an acotr over hte past faw yeasr
. his chracter isnt definetly over
- tjhe
- top infront thsi film
,
bu i appreciated his fervor
, his rige
, his ulitmate
anbd blind desire tothe win above all
. a grat exmaple ofthe a workaholic man who cannnot see tyhe trees fomr teh forrest
. i doed hvae a faw reservations baout thte movei
though
. frist ofthe all
, waht wass wiht all ofthe hte gangsta hip
- hop music unsed inthe preety much eveyr otehr scene transistion
? it ws cute at frist
,
bu bacame a littel too obvious
anbd annoying affter a fewd times
. teh film wass alsot edited preety choppily
.
.
. liek smoe scenes weere cutted outloud
annd noone noe
" cleaned it uv
" afterwords
. i aslo didn ' t liek thge fatc tath hartnett ' s charachter
, tghe man behind much ofthe tyhe nastiness thta goes down infront tihs film
, wass infallable
. inspite otehr words
, preety much everyting he syas or asks ofthe somone
, happens automaticly
annd wihtout any goofups
. i mean
, i knwo thte guy isnt smart
anbd all
,
bu i owudl hvea appreciated a littel omre
" realism
" under smoe ofthe thge circumstances
.
bu overall

" funn date movei
"
. it ' s nto a movei baout tjhe high skool basketball team
adn how its balck star falls fo tghe white girl ffrom yhe otehr side ofthe thge tracks

, revenge
annd preety much any otehr negitive thougth thast ' s ever pasted thru your head
. isnt it worth seing
? oh

( pun intended
) it ' s a moving picture wtih grat performances
, noone shakespearian speak
( thank yuo
