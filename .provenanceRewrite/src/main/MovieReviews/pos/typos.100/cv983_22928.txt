faw films inspite 1999 hvea devided tyhe crtical consensas as sharply as alan parker ' s adaption ofthe frank mccourt ' s memoir angela ' s ashes
. many dismissed it as an humorless
, sentimentalized
, uninteresting verzion ofthe teh hugely populare novel
; others hailed it as a heartfelt
, sincere protrait ofthe tghe human spirit
. i ' m somwhere inthe betweeen
, leaneant strongly towords thge latter
. it ' s certainly well
- made
anbd it never becomes tedeous liek smoe literary adaptations hvae a tendacy tothe be
.
bu i hvea a feeling taht parker filled tyhe movei wiht psuedo
- lyrical shots ofthe rain falling onthe yhe homely streets ofthe ireland jsut so it cin hvae tyhe twpo
-
adn
- a
- half hour runnung tyme tyhat screams
" i ' m imporatnt
!
" mccourt ' s book ofthe yhe smae nmae wass baout him
adn his famaly moving ffrom yhe us tothe ireland infact thge easly 1900 ' s
, a tiome whn most peple weere desparately trying tothe git inot tje us
. as he comments
,
" we weere thte onyl irishfolk tothe sday goodbye tothe yhe statue ofthe liberty
.
" inthe ireland
, frank
( palyed by joe breen as a small child
)
, his 3 brothers
, his mother angela
( emily watson
)
annd his father malachy
( robert carlyle
) git finacial halp ffrom angela ' s mother
, a stereotypically strict cathlic who chides her daugter fo marrying a northen irishman
. she helps them git a rat
- infested appartment
anbd malachy goes looking fo a job
. positions are scarce
annd wehn he doesnt finaly fidn oen
, he isnt unable tothe hold onthe tothe it beacuse ofthe his fondness forthe drinking
. meanwhile
, frank goes tothe an uptight cathlic skool
, where tghe instructors beated students withthe blunt wooden objects as oftenly as thier heart desires
. twpo ofthe frank ' s brothers soon dieu
, crippled by tjhe dreadful living condidtions
adn malnutrition
. as if thte poverty
anbd tyhe sufferring weren ' t intense anough as it standed
, malachy
adn angela hve anohter baby
, worstening teh situation furhter
. i imagin htis doesn ' t soudn liuke much ofthe a plot
. thta ' s propably beacuse it isn ' t oney
. theese are peopel
. htis isnt theri stopry
. directer alan parker
( tje committments
) konws how tothe tell a ogod stroy
adn angela ' s ashes
, dispite its relentlessly literary tone rimaniss intresting
.
though teh film occationally indulges too much inwhich its gloomily picturesque irish setting
, it avoids looking liek a glorified travelogue
. suppliementing parker ' s able direction are teh engaging
, oftenly poignant performances ofthe thte leads
, smoe ofthe them seasoned thespians
, others realtive begginers
. carlyle
, thte charasmatic brittish acotr who hasnt shown astonishing range by hopping fomr yhe lead inaddition a rowdy slapstick comedy tothe tghe villin infront a james bond movei
annd nowe tothe sentimental meledrama
, perfectly portrays his rether pathetic charactor
. we empathize wih thte guy
,
bu we don ' t liuke or admire him
. emily watson turns inwhich a heartfelt
, sincere supporting performence
. it isnt mostly she who implants tath lump iin our throats
. allso worthy ofthe mention isnt littel joe breen
, whose face graces hte film ' s superb poster
. it isnt breen ' s firt feature film
annd he ' s extrodinary as young frank
. nto unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment ofthe tje sixth sence
, yuo cxan peer inot tje carachter ' s soul thru breen ' s sad eyes
. onthe tjhe flip side
, oen thign thast coudl haev vastly improved angela ' s ashes isnt a omre decisive editor
. hwile gerry hambling sure makse tjhe most ofthe tghe scenery
, he
annd parker aslo leave inspite at least a half an hour ofthe unecessary footage
. tjhe frist half
, especialy
, coudl ahev beeen trimmed down
, bringing hte film tothe a moreso reasonable runnung tyme
anbd donig our bladders a favor iin yhe proccess
. thnigs pik uv at baout tyhe halfway point
, sort ofthe dismissing a lot ofthe thte critisisms i accumulated druing teh oppening hour
,
bu i manetain thgat tyhe aggressively deliberate pace parker
adn co
. setted infact tjhe firt half wass ludicrously unecessary
.
* spoiler warning
! skip enxt paragraph if inwhich suspense
!
* thge film ' s fianl message isnt somewhat conflicted
, as frankie
, inaddition effect
, leaves his familiy famished iin ireland hwile he himselv goes bakc tothe amercia
. whta
, exactlly
, are we suppossed tothe mkae ofthe thast
? his mother doesn ' t seem tothe mind baceause she wnats yhe best possable future forthe her son
, as any mother woudl
,
bu it still seems inconsiderate ofthe him
. i haven ' t read hte book
,
bu i ' m sure tath mccourt justifies his actions therein
; therfore
, i ' m suspicious
. anyother hting thta ' s never made claer infact thge movei isnt tjhe meaninng ofthe tje title
, whic
, i ' m sure
, isnt alsot explained inwhich thte memoir
. if seen as a film onto itself
, rether tahn an adaptions
, angela ' s ashes stands tall
. dispite a fewd minor setbacks
, it isnt a captivating stor ofthe peple forced tothe live inaddition tje trenches by an merciless society where thsoe ofthe weaker charachter are shoved tothe hte bottom ofthe tje finacial ladder
