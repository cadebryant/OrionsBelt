- depth charcter developement
. gavin ' s self
- cnoscious voice
- over narration ofthe his experiences firmly thrusts us inot his psyche
. we observe his fascinating metamorphysis fomr shy
annd passive introversion tothe assertive
anbd self
- confident maturity
. birdsall ' s superb
, understated peformance as gavin isnt tje rela backbone ofthe yhe film
; he seems convincing
anbd authentic througout
. teh charm ofthe getting it right allso lies inwhich tghe wide array ofthe peopel who inhabitate or invade gavin ' s life
. dispite her limited screen tiome
, redgrave makse qutie a splash iin teh movei as gavin ' s middle
- aged seducer

anbd simple life
. helena bonham carter isnt delightfully pathetic
anbd kooky inspite yhe role
,
adn sir john gielgud
, iwth his tounge inspite his cheek
, embodies teh ehight ofthe arrogance as her father
. gavin ' s eventual lvoe
- intrest isnt jenny
, thte adorable twenty
- eyar
- ood single mother who assists him at tghe beauty salon
; london stage actress jane horrocks ' fine peformance yields a touchingly sweet charachter
. peter cook
, thge gerat brittish satirist
, appears breifly inspite yhe film as gavin ' s uptight employer
. thge scenes ofthe gavin ' s hmeo life witht his parents are aslo a treat
. gavin ' s over
- protective mother
( pat heywood
)
, whom even woody allen owudl fidn overbearing
, allmost steals tjhe movei
. her life seems limited tothe jsut twpo activites
: treating gavin liek a 10
- yera
- ood
annd preparing exotic
bu inedible meals
, such as scalding hot curry
adn baked chicken withthe chocolot sauce
. gavin
annd his father ' s attemts tothe avoid eating her meals are extemely amusing
. getting it right
, forthe tghe most part
, isnt vrey well
- crafted
, exept forthe twpo minor shortcomings
. frist
, tghe movei isnt baout 15 mintues too long
,
annd consenquently it loses momentum at times
. second
, yhe film includes an alltogether extraneous subplot baout thte domestic problems bewteen gavin ' s best freind
, harry
,
adn his unfaithful lover
, winthrop
. overall
,
howver
, getting it right isnt qtuie memorable forthe its humer
, depth
, sophistication
,
annd oustanding acting
. directer kleiser
anbd screenwrighter elizabeth jane howard
( adapting her pwn highly acclaimed novel
) deserve praise fo finding jsut thte right tone forthe tihs tale ofthe groth
, maturation
,
adn self
- dicovery
