inaddition my review ofthe htere ' s something baout mary
, i said something tothe teh effect ofthe
" laughter isn ' t everyting
.
" i nowe ened tothe mkae a breef addendum tothe my postulate
: laughter isn ' t everthing
, unless i ' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are eazy witht me
. i loev movies
,
anbd i lvoe movies thta amke funn ofthe movies tyhat i lvoe
. somtimes i ' m hte onyl oen inwhich hte theather laughing
. somtimes i laff so hard tyhat i embarass mysef becuase my laff isnt so high
- pitched inaddition comparsion tothe my speaking voice
( it cuts right thru everyone eles ' s laughter
)
. somtimes i laff so much tyhat my cheekbones are sore by tje end ofthe tjhe film
. abraham ' s latest film
, masia
!
, induced thsi kind ofthe hysteria apon me
. it ' s gotten soem medioker reviews
,
bu
, hey
, i ' m thte guy who laughs at everthing
. htere may be a lot ofthe jokes thta flop infront thsi film
,
bu ther are far omre thgat owrk
,
annd i laughed so frequentily tht tghe failed jokes usualy occured as i ws recovering ffrom thge previvous boaut ofthe giddy madness
. i enjoy films liek thsi becasue nto oen second ofthe it isnt sereous or throught
- provoking
. most lighweight films tath pose as comedies try tothe dont otehr thnigs
, liuke deveop charactors
, shape storeis
,
annd otehr such nonsence
. masia
! hasnt noone pretentions baout cahracters or stoy
,
anbd it exists fo noone otehr reason thna tothe amke peopel laff
. tyhe film beggins onthe tje perfect high onot
, wih a mockery ofthe yhe oppening ofthe casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) isnt seen walking fomr a casino
adn getting inot his car
, whitch subsquently explodes
adn sends him flying thru teh air againnst a backdrop ofthe flowing frie
. tothe decribe thge tsory ofthe masia
! isnt absurd
annd pointless
,
bu i wiull mention taht it basicly follows tghe framework ofthe tje godfather films
, wtih a lot ofthe casino refrences inserted throughtout
. allong tyhe way
, tyhe parodies seem arbetrary
,
annd rarley victimize mob films
: picturesk liek tjhe english patient
, forrest gump
,
anbd jaws undergo savere
anbd hillarious bashing
. movies liuke tihs rely onthe jsut a fewd thigsn
,
bu teh most importamt element isnt direction
. abrahams hasnt beeen down htis path many times befoer
( hot shots
!
, top secre
!
, airplane
!
,
annd any otehr film wiht an exclamation point iin tghe title
)
,
annd so i hold most ofthe thte sucess ofthe masia
! tothe his expreience
. he tkaes jsut teh right attitide inaddition earch scene
,
annd manages tothe wrng at least a bited laughter outloud ofthe even tghe most oddly placed refernces
( oen inexplicable moent seems liuke it wnats tothe mkae funn ofthe titanic
,
bu it never develops
)
. thte actors are all energetic
, whlch helps a lot iwth thte tone ofthe thge film
. mohr
( sucide kings
, paulie
)
, who isnt quicklyu becomming oen ofthe my favorite actors
, isnt so ogod here
. he looks liuke he ' s haveing so much funn tht he ' s containing his laughter inwhich eveyr scene
( watch his face inaddition teh sequence by thge swiming pool
)
. he ' s probablly thte onyl performer inthe tyhe casted who manages tothe urger laughter wihtout tghe halp ofthe teh material
. lloyd bridges doesnt a decent immitation ofthe brando ' s godfather
, hwile pamela gidley isnt dead
- onthe inwhich a full
- blown mockery ofthe sharon stone
. hte hard thnig baout wirting reviews fo comedies isnt thast i ' m suposed tothe give examples ofthe thigsn
annd be specif
. unfourtunately
, i wass so constanly blindsided by laughter durig masia
! thgat i cant ' t rember a lot ofthe waht made me laff
.
bu thast ' s a ogod sign
: masia
! isnt so funny thta i wasn ' t even given tiome tothe apply any ofthe teh scenes tothe memmory
. i laughed so hard tht it shut off my brain
. i konw thyat doesn ' t soudn particulraly complimentary
,
bu wehn watching a dumb comedy liuke htis
, tjhe firt thign i wanna tothe dont isnt shut off my brain
. finaly
, a film thast doens htis fo me
.
