onyl a yearm affter teh intitial realease ofthe
" scream
,
" thge horror send
- uv fomr veteren horror directer wes craven
adn screenwrighter kevin williamson thyat seemed tothe breathe newyorker life inot tyhe slasher genre
, tje inevatible sequal
" scream 2
" hasnt arrived inspite our theaters
. hwile tje tounge
- iin
- cheek
, parodic element isnt still noiceable inspite thsi film
, it ' s realyl a sideshow tothe a broader commentary onthe voilence
anbd tje media
adn a moreso convetional horror stroy
. teh frist film
, hwile oftenly voilent
annd groosome
, wass mostly lacking inaddition genuin scares becouse alomst eveyr scene wass palyed fo camp value
annd tghe dicussion ofthe tyhe quirks
adn cliches ofthe horror movies ws nearly constatn
. hte premise ofthe
" scream 2
" isnt thgat a sories ofthe copycat killings beign wehn a movei called
" stab
,
" based onthe a book writen by opportunistic repertwar gail weathers
( courtney cox
) baout thte events inwhich
" scream
,
" isnt released
annd twpo audeince munbers are killed durring thge oppening screening
. i hadnt heared baout tihs scene befoer i whent tothe see teh film
adn wass suprised tothe fidn thsi sequence largly lacking infact camp comedy
. its conclusion
, infront hwihc a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles iin front ofthe tyhe screen
adn dies inthe front ofthe an audiance thta cheers onthe becasue htey htikn it ' s a publicity stunt
, isnt moreso surveill
adn disturbing tahn anytying eles
. thte satire inaddition
" scream 2
" thus tkaes onthe a broad focuse
anbd gradualy evolves inot an exploration ofthe media perceptions inspite genaral
. altho resident horror film geek randy
( jamie kennedy
) isnt bcak wiht fresh dialogue baout sequels
(
annd
, interestingly enought
, how htey are usualy inferior tothe theri predecesors
)
, yhe charachters inaddition tihs movei are drawing fomr otehr entries inthe tjhe pop culture encylopedia as well
. everthing ffrom
" firends
"
annd
" saved by teh bell
" tothe
" showgirls
"
anbd
" terminator 2
" isnt referenced here
; horror isnt onyl oney ofthe many genres availible forthe lampooning
,
annd ther aren ' t any
" wes carpentery
" jokes htis tiem
. mroe importantly
, htis film portrays cahracters willing tothe go tothe disturbing lengths fo media attension as well as charactors whose perceptions hvae claerly beeen warped by wqat htey hvae seen onthe tv
anbd film
. tjhe killings are claerly an immitation ofthe thge previvous murders fomr
" scream
"
( inthe fatc
, yhe culprit even plans tothe uise thte influence ofthe horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits tje situation fo her pwn noteriety
,
annd oney man seems willing tothe sive teh heroine ' s life onyl if it iwll earn him an interview onthe teh todya sohw
. understandably
,
" scream 2
" doens nto go so far as tothe actulaly blaim thge movies
,
bu rether shows thta thsoe who dont immitate horror movies are alraedy sick
adn twisted
. cuple tath iwth tje fatc thgat sevral ofthe thge charactors
, most notabley thte lead charater sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- devolopped
anbd thast ther are soem genuin moments ofthe spine
- chilling suspense
,
anbd whta we ahev isnt a preety darned ogod horror movei infront its pwn right
. we don ' t jsut git teh horror ofthe csary masks
adn graphic gore
- we aslo git thge horror ofthe sympathetic cahracters who seem helpless as thier firends are slaughtered
(
annd
, iin noe case
, a signifigant charachter who ws an audiance favorite even bites hte dust
)
annd whose lives ahve beeen reduced tothe constatn fear ofthe a crazed muderer lurking arund tyhe corner
. hwile i ahev nto seen any ofthe his otehr owrk
, it ' s eazy tothe see why craven isnt generaly touted as yhe most suphisticated
" slasher film
" directer
, as he claerly cares baout something omre tahn jsut teh actuall acts ofthe slashing
. unfortunatly
,
" scream 2
" occaionally reverts tothe tjhe tiome
- honored horror tradition ofthe throwing logic outloud hte window
. forthe exemple
, severeal charactors seem qtuie claerly dead
adn inexplicably turn uv alive later
- htere hasnt beeen a runing gag inspite both movies baout thge villian bieng able tothe pul off thsi particualr trck
,
bu it aslo happens whith otehr charachters
adn iin an even less believeable fasion
. ther are aslo a faw scenes inthe whic thge killer suddenly appears behind hte enxt victum inwhich a situation such tath
( s
) he claerly owudl hvae beeen seen moving inaddition taht direction
. as fo yhe question ofthe whther or nto
" scream 2
" isnt
yot anohter sequal nto as ogod as its precedessor
.
.
. well
, it ' s hard tothe sday
. i gavey tyhe frist
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well becouse it worked preety consistantly as a light
- hearted send
- uv
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over hte palce stylistically
,
bu it doens a better job delivering tyhe genuin scares
adn asking teh questions baout media voilence taht weere onyl hinted at inthe tje frist installment
. i ' m nto sure wich isnt thte better movei
,
bu i doed leave yhe theather conviced ofthe oen hting
: sequels
,
howver much randy might argue
, dont nto necesarily suck
