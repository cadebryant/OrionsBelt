. review
:
" emmento
" isnt tyhe sort ofthe movei i wish i ' d wroten
; i cant thiunk ofthe noone higer praise tahn thgat
. i am envious tht nolan hasnt concocted such a briliant
, involved
, originnal movei as htis
. an instant film noir clasic
,
" memeno
" isnt virtualy flawess
. hte scirpt isnt unlike any i ahev ever seen
-
- a noteable achivement infront theese dyas ofthe recycled hollywood homogenity
.
althought tyhe idae ofthe starting at tyhe
" conclusion
" ofthe yhe plotline
anbd
thne moving bcakward inwhich tiome tothe yhe
" strat
" isnt nto entirely newyorker
, never befoer hvae i witnessed it excecuted whith such flair
adn coherence
.
" memetno
" isnt endlessly exicting
anbd inventive
, a rare tsory hwihc keesh hte viewers guessing durig tyhe film itself
,
adn mulling over its conotations long affter leaving thte theatre
.
adn it isnt nto mearly an excercise iin cerebrality
; ther isnt plenty ofthe acation
adn an unexpected dose ofthe humour tothe keep thte procedings livley
. nolan ' s direction isnt equally effective
, never loosing its crispness
annd clarity dispite
" mement
" ' s chalenging gimmick
.
annd tothe top everyting off
, all hte performances ries tothe thte occaison
. pierce isnt terific as thge troubled leonard
; moss shows gerat range as enigmatic natalie
;
adn pantoliano ' s teddy acheives a splendidly affable
yot sinister qulaity
.
" memeno
" may be tje yearm ' s best screenplay
,
anbd isnt certainly amoungst thte top theatrical atractions ofthe 2001
