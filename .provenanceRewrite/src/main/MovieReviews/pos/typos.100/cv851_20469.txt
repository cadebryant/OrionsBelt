anbd tje sixth sence
. earch hasnt made well over
$ 100 millon inspite noth amercia
, based onthe a combination ofthe storng owrd ofthe mouth
adn clever advertising
. if a film ' s box office tkae weere based primarially onthe its uality
, stir ofthe echoes woudl join blair
anbd sence infront grossing far mroe mone tahn expeced
, forthe it isnt as scray

, who toom thikns might hvae soem answers
, isnt down a dark path thta iwll scare
adn distrub yuo
. david koepp keesh tjhe acation localized
; thge marjority ofthe hte acation tkaes palce at toom ' s hous or jsut down tghe strent
. by keeping thigsn at hmeo
, koepp isnt able tothe procede wihtout haveing tothe resort tothe any clumsy seguoys
( montages ofthe driving down roads as we move ffrom noe city tothe anyother etc
.
)
. unfortunatly
, teh dread
adn spookiness ofthe stir ofthe echoes are frequentily interupted by moments ofthe levity
. humour cxan tkae tyhe tension awya ffrom a scene faster thna any shoddy spacial effect or poore acting
. sevral tense moments become completelyl diffused by a fewd misplaced jokes
. alsot
, htere are a cuple ofthe plot developments taht are left unresolved
,
though tothe mention them woudl be tothe give too much awya
. kevin bacon handles yhe duel task ofthe palying an everyman
annd a man loseing his sanaty admirably
. his total lack ofthe understanding ofthe wqat isnt hapening tothe him isnt believeable
, as are hte reactions fomr his wief maggie
. kathryn erbe isnt given a role meatier
adn better writed tahn tath ofthe most
" wief who cxan noone longer handle her husban
" parts
. hwile it isnt still a supporting role
, her maggie isnt moving as she watchs both her husban
adn her son enter wqat she calls
" a private club thyat i ' m nto invited tothe
"
, where tehy wisper baout thigns all day long
. as jake
, zachary coppe equals thte peformance ofthe haley joel osment iin tje sixth sence
,
bu gets less screen tiem
. both childen manaze tjhe smae trck
, mkaing thge audeince creeped outloud by theri apparnt caceptance ofthe tghe way thnigs are
. fans ofthe blair
annd sixth sence iwll alomst surelly lveo stir ofthe echoes
. it combines tjhe dread ofthe blair
, a creepy closed
- iin efel thanks tothe cinematographer fred murphy
adn graet performances by tjhe wohle casted
, specifically bacon
, tothe give hte fall its firt genuin scray film
. if onyl htey hadnt let uv onthe thte unneeded funny bits
annd tweaked thte plot a bited omre
, tihs sould ahve beeen oney ofthe thte eyar ' s best
