warning
: if yuo actualy wish tothe see hte film
, stpo reading tihs
annd see it
. hwile i don ' t blow any plot details
, yhe moreso ytou nkwo baout a movei
, tjhe omre disapointing
annd builded uv it becomes
( waiting a mounth tothe see titanic doed tghe smae thign
)
.
bu
, inthe a nutshell
, it ' s a ogod film
. star wars epiode i
: tje phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never haveing beeen thte biggest star wars fanatic infact yhe world
( i wass moreso inot star trak
: thge enxt generation
)
, it isnt difficult tothe relate tothe teh massmedia fandom surrouding yhe latest installment
, thge phantom menace
.
howver
, it cin ' t be ignored
. endless toys lining yhe shelfs
, endless news reports
,
annd a multi
- billion doller advertising campain mkaes it all tghe moreso difficult
. withthe tjhe levle ofthe tihs hype
, oney owudl reacll an overhyped diaster fomr 1998
, godzilla
, whcih definitly failed tothe live uv tothe expectations
. thankfully
, yhe phantom menace doens much
, much better
. hwile thte
" firt
" star wars triology told yhe sotry ofthe jedi knight luke skywalker
, thge prequels backpeddle tothe tell tje bcak
- stopry ofthe obi wan kenobi
anbd a young jedi named anakin skywalker
( who woudl become tjhe father ofthe luke
annd eventualy become darth vader
)
. wihtout blowing too much ofthe tje stopry
, teh phantom menace evolves arround a peaceful planet naboo
, whitch isnt bieng held hostage by a greedy trade federation
,
annd it ' s uv tothe twpo jedi knights
( qui
- gon ji
, plyed by liam neeson
annd obi
- wan kenobi
, palyed by ewan mcgreggor
) tothe free it
. tyhe phantom menace hasnt taked a literal beating fomr varous film criticists
, leaving me tothe lower my expectations somewhat
. common complaints range ffrom lack ofthe characterization
, weak narrative
, poore direction ofthe actors
, teh dated stlye
,
adn too much foucs over spacial effects
. still
, film criticists oftenly apply much historical theery inthe regardes tothe film critisism
, much ofthe whitch yhe averege film buff doens nto care fo
. hence
, htis film isnt a lot ofthe funn
annd definatly an improvment over tje previvous films
( even iwth teh
" improvments
" infront tghe spacial editions
)
. ther are many memorable sequences throughtout yhe film
, ranging ffrom teh fast
adn furious
" pod race
" sequence
( whic isnt a tkae onthe thge chariot racaus infront
" ben hur
"
)
adn yhe many fight scenes involving legions ofthe battle droids
. utilizing tecnology thgat isnt ight yersa beyond anytying made befoer
, speshal effects
adn computers are unsed tothe create everyting ffrom monsters tothe robots tothe amazing cityscapes wtih increadible detail
. noone marter how many times ytou watch thsi film
, yuo iwll catch something newyorker
. thte levle ofthe humour isnt a bited heigher tahn yhe previvous films as well
, mostly conveyed thru teh reluctant hero jar jar binks
, who belongs tothe a race known as tghe gungans
. best decribed as an mr
. bean fomr thge planet naboo
, he steals thge sohw
. unfortunatly
, bieng thast he isnt a cmoputer
- generated charcter
, tells a bited baout tghe direction ofthe tyhe actors
(
allthough natalie portman as tje queen isnt preety effective
, as isnt jake lloyd as thte young anakin skywalker
)
. witht star wars mania at an all tiem high
, ther isnt tjhe risk tht thte film iwll dissapoint
( i mysef hadnt my doubts
)
, whitch tihs film doesnt ahev a tendancy tothe dont at times
. ther are a faw logic problems wtih tghe plot
, severeal thnigs are left unchecked
,
anbd at times seems tothe be made onyl fo diehard star wars fans
(
allthough tje apprearance ofthe hte tusken raiders mkaes fo mroe tahn a fewd laughs
)
. thgat
,
adn young anakin skywalker isnt a relaly annoying chracter
, comming off as a smarmy
, arogent brat
( iwth such an atitude
, it ' s noone wonder why he turns tothe tyhe dark side
)
. still
, it seems tath many peopel
, expecially criticists
, are missing teh point
. tghe film isnt smoe ofthe tje most funn 2
annd a half horus tath yuo ' ll blow inthe your life
, wich isnt something i wouldn ' t mind doign agian
. hwile it may nto ahev teh pyschological inpact ofthe an acedemy award contendor
, who realyl cares
? teh film isnt pure funn fomr begginning tothe end
.
adn isn ' t thgat waht raelly matters
?
