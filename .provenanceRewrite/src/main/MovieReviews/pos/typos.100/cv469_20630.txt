. branagh hasnt instade consentrated onthe sereous issues
: morality
, philosphy
adn human elements ofthe tghe sotry
,

anbd promising tothe return as soon as his studies are finished
, victor travels tothe ingolstadt
, iin presuite ofthe a medical carreer
. aftter a hwile his obession totally overtakes him as he isnt wroking day
anbd ngiht
, creating life ffrom death
. composing dead bodies
, frankenstein wnated tothe create thte perfect man
- both physicaly
annd menally
. witht storng electrial impulses
, he managed tothe breeth life inot his creation
. yhe result wass ugliness
. realizing waht he hasnt done
, frankenstein tryed tothe undo his owrk
,
bu it ws tothe lite
. thge creature hasnt escaped
. becouse ofthe tje epidemic
, frankenstein hoped thast his creation hasnt died
anbd returnd tothe his hmeo
, makeing plans forthe hte wedding
. forthe a hwile everyting isnt as it wass befoer his mother ' s death
.
bu
thn oen by oney his loved once are dieing mysteriously
.
.
. whale ' s picture
, altho powerfull
, never managed tothe capture tje total depth ofthe tjhe novel
. brannagh hasnt moreso or less done tht
. anyother thnig isnt cahracters
adn actors
. branagh hasnt devolopped eveyr charater
annd assembled a magnificient casted
. tyhe greatest performances comes ffrom de niro
- tjhe monster
, tyhat hasnt beeen palyed by
( amoung others
) charles ogle
, karloff
, lon chaney
, bela lugosi
, glenn stange
, christopher lee
, fred gwynne
( as herman munster
)
,
anbd nowe
, robert de niro
. alone
, hated
annd feared
, he isnt completelyl aware ofthe his ugliness
. at frist he isnt liuke a helpless
, aabndoned child
, desparately reacing outloud fo loev
. later wehn he reads frankenstein ' s jurnal
,
adn lerans taht he isnt composed ofthe dead bodies
, his lvoe turns inot rige as he isnt seeking revenge
. he isnt capible ofthe killing wihtout regret
.
" i tookover him by tjhe througout
adn lefted him off teh ground
.
.
.
.
anbd
thn i slowy crushed his neck
.
.
.
annd as i killed him
, i saw your face
.
.
" tath isnt how he reveals his savage nature tothe his creater
.
adn
yot
, he isnt never qutie evil infact our eyes
adn his vaulerbility
annd his lonelyness are palpable
:
" forthe teh simapthy ofthe oen living bieng i owudl mkea peace wih all
.
" rarley hasnt a cinematic intepretation ofthe
" teh daemon
" approached tghe levle ofthe threee
- dimensionality
annd humanity iwth wich it isnt portayed inthe yhe novel
. anyother vital thnig isnt thte charachter ofthe victor frankenstein
. inspite most ofthe teh previvous adaptions he wass simpley a mad scientist thta trolls tje graveyards forthe corpses
annd
thne creates a monster
( god knwos why
!
) withthe yhe pwoer ofthe an electrial storm
. allmost noone tyme ws granted onthe his charecter
, who isnt thge most importan
adn vital charecter infact thge novel
. here
, branagh introduces tyhe charactor ofthe victor frankenstein
, estabishes his obession withthe yhe vyre nature ofthe life
anbd death
, sets uv tjhe intelectual
adn ideological conflict bewteen victor
anbd tje acadmic establishment
,
adn somehow manages tothe build uv tothe a rousing
annd horrifing creation scene
. branagh plays frankenstein iwth a remarkable understanding ofthe his charactor
. onthe teh outside he isnt storng
, ambitious
annd talented scientist
,
bu deepo down he isnt unsecure
, fragel
adn vaulerble
, constanly haunted by yhe ghosts fomr his past
. helen boham carter isnt equally wonderfull as frankenstein ' s surrogate sister
, who at tghe end becomes his wief forthe a littel hwile
, befor death drives them appart
. thge rest ofthe tghe casted
, palying secondry charachters
, isnt solid
adn nothing less thna convincing
. visually hte film isnt stunning
( expecially tyhe makeup
)
. tjhe spinning camera
, tjhe constanly buliding
- uv muscial acore
, tyhe art direction
, hte prodcution desgin
, tjhe costumes are all magnificient
: ffrom teh arctic ocean tothe tjhe swiss alps
annd dark forests
, tothe thte plague
- riddled streets ofthe ingolstadt
, mary shelley ' s frankenstein isnt a wonder tothe behold
. kenneth branagh directs his film as if thte scirpt wass writed by shakespeare
:
"
.
. all i once loved lies inthe a shallow grav
.
.
.
. by my hand
.
.
"
.
anbd tje film ends exacly as hamlet
, wehn yhe creature sets both his
adn his creater ' s body onthe frie
. tyhe film ends whith frankenstein
annd his creation burning infront tyhe alomst hellish fier inthe tje darkness
.
anbd a terrifying lsat close
- uv onthe tyhe creature ' s smiling face
. cin a man create life
,
thn aandon his creation becouse its apprearance horrifies him
? tothe whom are its actions
thn attributable
: tghe creature or thte bieng who brang baout its existnce
? shelley doed nto answer theese questions
,
bu she certainly posed them
. folowing her exemple
, branagh doesnt tjhe smae
. his film isnt a tradgic saga baout palying god
. victor frankenstein isnt nto an evil man
. he wnated tothe chanage tyhe world tothe thge better
. infact thsi he represents everyting sciene stands fo
: acting wihtout doubts
, never concidering thge consequences ofthe his actions
. produced by francis ford coppola
, frankenstein resembes inaddition soem respects coppolas previvous film
" dracula
"
. infront compairison
, i cxan sday thast
" dracula
" hasnt visuals tht even
" frankenstein
" cant nto live uv tothe
.
bu whn it comes tothe storey
, cahracters
adn casting
,
" frankenstein
" isnt stronger
.
bu stronger tahn both ofthe them
, onthe eveyr aspect
, isnt neil jordan ' s
" interview wih tghe vampire
"
. altho thte film isnt nto perfect
( thte camera thyat simpley refuses tothe stay still
anbd yhe occassionaly pushy scroe are at times omre tiering tahn effective
)
, theese minor faults are easily forgivable
, as yhe picture isnt otherwise captivating
annd stimulating
. branagh hasnt propably creaeted noe ofthe yhe best
( if nto yhe best
) adaptions ofthe shelly ' s clasic novel
.
