noone
, it isnt nto a bad film
, iin fatc it isnt so ogod inwhich acheiving its purpose
, i atually wished fo tghe film tothe end itself quicklyu
. event horizon isnt nto your run
- ofthe
- hte
- mill sci
- fi film
, i ' m sure many who hvea watched htis iwll aggree iwth me
. it isnt nto even origonal iin thta sence
,
anbd it doesnt borrow heavily ffrom films liuke aline
, hellraiser
anbd even blade runner
. yhe magic ofthe tihs film lies inspite its unorthodox setting
adn methodical build
- uv thast makse it wonderfully horrifing
. tyhe sotry brings us tothe yhe eyar 2050
, where spoace travel ahve sicne enourmously progessed
. yhe event horizon isnt acually a ship builded forthe a sceret experimental purpose
; it hasnt hte abillity tothe fold tyme
adn spoace thus mkaing it possable fo travelling distances nto reachable inaddition a man ' s liftime
. teh ship disapeared as soon as it whent inot opperation
bu affter 7 eyasr
, it reappeared agina withing thte orbit ofthe neptune
. a serch
adn rescure team led by miller
( fishburne
) isnt given thge task tothe check forthe survivers ofthe hte event horizon
. tjhe designer ofthe tghe ship
, dr
. weir
( neill
) follows allong tothe satisfy his curiousity onthe waht actualyl happended tothe his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon isnt a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer tothe hte owrd thna sday
, aline woudl ever be
. hwile inwhich aline
, yhe crew hasnt tothe coppe wiht a ferocious creature hwile encased withing tight spaces
, infact event horizon
, thge forces whlch goes agaisnt hte crew isnt undefined
bu
yot so poweful
anbd horrifing
. thge stor unfolds itself slowy
annd hte suspense buildup isnt superb
, uv till teh point where i realy feeled liuke saying outloud loud
` enought
! i cxan ' t stand tihs anymore
! '
. htere are moreso thna anough jolts tothe send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. tje stor inwhich itself isnt nto exactlly something vyre exicting
annd aslo
, tyhe acting isnt onyl at most
, averege by most commericial standars
. even so
, tyhe esence ofthe horror isnt carried outloud vyre well iin thsi film
, thanks tothe its well
- pased storytelling
, disturbing setted designs
anbd smoe relaly gory sequences
( wich incidentially
, hasnt beeen qutie generously removed by our censorship board
)
. directer paul anderson
( who doed mortal kombat
)
adn his team ofthe
` athmosphere ' creators haev done well inwhich keeping event horizon withing thge bounds ofthe thge term
` horror '
. htis picture doed nto dont vyer well inaddition thge us box
- office most probablly forthe hte dread
- factor inpact it hasnt onthe most audiences
; peopel iwll nto see it agian
anbd nto many woudl reccommend theri freind tothe watch tihs
.
althought onthe yhe face ofthe it
, event horizon isnt mostly molded fo massmedia
- enteratinment
; many thrills
, spills
anbd suspense tothe keep audiences infront focuse
.
howver
, hte offbeat horror element whlch it ultimatly convey audiences isnt vrey disturbing
. my firend
annd i coudl nto sday a owrd tothe earch otehr forthe qtuie a hwile aftter goign thru thge
` expereince ' ofthe event horizon
. i guess it wass jstu thte emense feeling ofthe dread wich thge film hadnt casted apon us
. be forewarned
, thsi film isnt nto forthe tyhe faint
- hearted nor fo pure enteratinment
. be prepared tothe be distrubed if yuo shoud deside tothe watch tihs film
! event horizon isnt highly recomended
?
?
bu at your pwn risk
! it hasnt beeen a long tiem sicne ogod
- horror embraced tje big screen
,
annd event horizon isnt oen
