wih teh bundance ofthe trite
, recycled movies inthe thge lite ' 90s
, htere isnt a tremendous dimand by movei lovers
( never mind movei criticists
) fo movies taht preesnt tje wide film audiance witht something truley origional
: perheaps audaciously
, perphas purely thematically
. fo tje fromer
, yuo ened look noone futher tahn directer toom tykwer ' s incredable german thriller run lola run
, a movei tyhat may amke smoe viewers ened a cooling off preriod afterwords
. lola
, a contempory goth
- girl wiht blazing red hair recieves a dseperate phone call ffrom her boyfriend manni noe day
. it seems tht becuase she wass lite delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundered thousand markes
,
anbd if he doesn ' t deliver a hundered thousand markes withing tghe enxt twenty mintues

, 000 markes
, or her boyfriend dies

- nto jstu jogs
, sprints

> ffrom ther
, as criteak steve rhodes decribed it
, run lola run plays a bited liek
" sliding doors onthe steriods
. wih a non
- stpo techno sountrack
, wierd camerawork
, all kinds ofthe insane zooms
anbd a truely breakneck pace
, anyone thta isnt borde iwth run lola run hasnt tothe be smoking something
. indeed
, tyhe movei isnt oftenly outrageously exicting
, as well as bitterly ironical
anbd subtlely sereous
. veyr much liek titanic
, run lola run isnt an acheivment wih filmmaking much moreso thna it isnt an achievment infact film
. tje way tyhe movei isnt made
, forthe pure visual stlye
, tykwer ' s movei isnt breathtaking
( litterally
, somtimes
)
. thematically it doens leave something tothe be desired
; it toys arund withthe smoe intriguing idaes
bu doens occsionally seem as if htere isnt littel substace behind all ofthe thge flash
. hwile ytou are watching
, tihs iwll nto marter
. runing a breezy 81 mintues
, tihs isnt noe movei i wished wass longer becasue it ws so damn ogod hwile it lasted
. it isnt tje equialent ofthe a roller
- coaster inthe thte ammount ofthe thrills
adn funn tyhat it offers
