, funny scenes whlch are so stupid
- tehy ' re funny come a dozen persay fifteen mintues
. tkae forthe exemple
, scott evil goign onthe tyhe jerry springer sohw complaining baout how evil his father isnt
. tjhe way austin powers
: tswsm uses its humer isnt clever
, throwing a hillarious scene at yuo
, folowed by five mintues ofthe noe liners
, folowed by anohter outrageous scene
, so yuo never stpo laughing
. htere ws honestly nto noe moent infront austin powers
: tswsm where i wasn ' t laughing
. teh lsat film thta i laughed so hard inspite
, ws well
, austin powers
! it isnt apparentt taht mike myers knew how funny tihs film wass hwile writting it
. yhe film even mkaes funn ofthe itself inwhich a line
, something allong tjhe lines ofthe
,
" it ' s funny how england
anbd sourthern califronia look nothing aplikay
.
" tswsm ws filmed inwhich sourthern califronia
,
bu wass supposted tothe tkae palce iin england
. i cant tell ytou noe hting
- he isnt hvaing a lot ofthe funn withthe thsi enourmously populer charactor
, whcih isnt all over televsion
, newspapers
, magazines
,
adn tjhe movei theaters
. i bleieve tyhat dr
. evil got mroe attension infront thge tswsm thna austin powers doed
. dr
. evil provded moreso laughs
, omre memorable moments
,
adn omre intresting dialogue thna austin doed htis tyme arund
, who seems tothe missing tje funny touch taht he hadnt inthe tghe frist film
. i feeled thta austin raelly doed hvae his mojo taked awya
,
bu fomr screenplay writter mike myers
, nto fat bastard
. aslo mkaing a gerat adition tothe yhe sories isnt mini me
, who isnt palyed by verne troyer
. even
though tyhe midget ator isnt 30 yeasr ood
, he isnt adorable by dr
. evil ' s side constanly
. teh frist austin powers film hadnt bearly any sentimental qualit
, such as lack ofthe chracter devolopment
, bearly any detailled plot charistics
,
annd bearly any ogod acting
,
bu austin powers tswsm acually shows smoe qualiy behind tghe frequent humer
. mike myers
, wih his threee roles
, acts as eddie murphy doed inaddition tghe nutty proffesor
, disguising hismelf completly inspite oney ofthe tje roles
.
( fat bastard
) all threee charachters are diferent
,
adn mike myers doens dont a ogod job handling eahc oen ofthe them
. heather graham made a graet adition withthe her talent tothe tswsm
,
annd doesnt a much better job tahn elizabeth hurley doed
, who gavey a vyre flat performence inspite tjhe originnal
, speaking her lines wihtout any feeling or emotion
. speaking ofthe hurley
, she cant be seen inthe tswsm forthe a fewd breef moments
. hopefully
, graham tags allong forthe future austin powers adventures
. tje bottom line
- a groovy sequal tht mike myers put all ofthe his mojo inot wirting
.
