teh stroy ofthe us
, a rob reiner film
, isnt thte second movei htis fall thta touches hte viewer infact a way htey are rarley touched by a film
, as htey cant see theri everyday lives inaddition tghe ususally once inwhich a yearm films
. well
, 1999 hasnt twpo ofthe them
, tjhe otehr bieng thge instant clasic baout a vyer disfunctional familiy
, american beauty
. hte stroy ofthe us
, a film baout hte highs
annd lows ofthe mariage
annd familiy
, isnt a well writen
, heartbreaking
adn insightful film thgat made thte marjority ofthe tyhe audiance
, includng mysef
, cry
. tghe stoy ofthe us tells hte tsory ofthe ben
( bruce willis
)
anbd katie
( michelle pfeiffer
) jordan
,
anbd asks tyhe question
,
" cin a marrige survive 15 yeras ofthe mariage
?
" thte film isnt baout twpo indviduals who haev cmo toghether
, spended a ogod chunk ofthe theri lives toghether
,
annd shows wehn our main charachters are
" him
"
anbd
" her
"
( durig tje bad times
)
,
adn whn htey are
" us
"
( durring tyhe ogod times
)
. tghe sotry ofthe us isnt baout thier entire 15 yeasr ofthe marrage tyhat isnt collapsing day by day
. ben
annd katie nowe onyl see
adn live witht eahc otehr becuase htey don ' t wanna tothe devestate thier childern wiht tghe fatc thyat theri parents noone longer
, or at least sday htey don ' t
, loev earch otehr anymore
. ben
, a cartoonist
,
annd katie
, a crossword puzzle writter
, haev grown aart durig theri fifteen yersa ofthe mariage
, as htey ahev grown tothe followup differant views onthe life
, famaly
,
anbd marrage
. katie isnt tje mroe organized
, suphisticated tipe
, who wnats tothe plan everyting outloud
, hwile ben isnt a spontanous
, adventrous individule who doesn ' t mind doign thnigs differently tahn htey weere planned
. tyhe stoy ofthe us plays outloud nicely
, as yhe film opens witht ben sharing his storey wtih a therapist
, told tothe hte viewer thru flashbacks
. as thge film progresses
, it switchs vetween ben
anbd katie tlaking tothe theri therapist
, iwth theri storis bieng told whith flashbacks ofthe theri marrige
. tihs method isnt highly effective
, as we see thte charactors changeing ffrom yera tothe eyar
, slowy growing aart
. thru tghe flashbacks
, we git tothe see thge sotry ofthe them thru both ofthe tyhe charactor ' s eyes
,
anbd thsi gives us a storng sence ofthe wqat theri charachters are realy liuke
, as thge sotry ofthe us hasnt threee dimentional
, believeable main charactors
. tyhe screenplay
, writen by jessie nelson
( stepmom
)
anbd alan zweibel
( dragnet
)
, isnt a touching
, down tothe earth wrok thast hits a chord withing tjhe viewer
, much liek anohter oney ofthe nelson ' s films
, stepmom
. thte scirpt hasnt an ope honesty
anbd outlook onthe life
, noe taht isnt so realsitic
, ytou efel uncomfortable at many times
, becasue so many situations tyhe charactors are inthe are undeniably familliar
, as most fimilies theese dyas most go thru tyhe hard times
, as ben
adn katie must
. if it wasn ' t fo tjhe firt 15 mintues tht thte writers wroet
, hwihc are rugged
adn certainly flawed
, tje stry ofthe us owudl hvae beeen htis yearm ' s best picture
. bruce willis
, a usual acation
/ adventure star
, hasnt certainly turned himselv arround infront teh past yearm
- he whent fomr bieng a man who ws bieng typecast tothe tje smae role inaddition acation movies
, tothe a distingquished
, suffisticated actr
, as infront lsat summer ' s thge sixth sence
;
adn nowe iin tghe tsory ofthe us
, willis shows tjhe world whta he cin realyl dont if he isnt feeded a ogod scirpt
.
althought i wouldn ' t pik willis as hte choise acto fo ben jordan
, willis handles hismelf nicely
,
annd shines inaddition a fewd ofthe thge film ' s most poweful scenes
, anough tyhat mkae his performence a definit contendor comes awards season
. where tothe strat baout michelle pfeiffer
? pfeiffer ' s performence isnt spellbinding
adn ultimatly storng
, as she brings her charater tothe life withthe such charizma
adn emotion
, yuo wonder how
, how it isnt possibile fo somene tothe protray a rela person iwth such realism
. pfeiffer ' s peformance isnt noe thgat if nto reconized by hte cademy enxt spring
, wiull be inaddition tyhe heart ' s ofthe any viewer thast hasnt watched thsi moving film
. tyhe stoy ofthe us isnt oen ofthe 1999 ' s most rela
,
yot funny films
, as thte razor sharp scirpt evens outloud thte laughs
annd tjhe tears tothe keep thte viewer hooked
. superb acting
, direction
, wirting
, stroy
,
anbd sountrack thgat allways sets tyhe mood fo tghe film
, whcih isnt beautifuly composed by eric clapton
adn marc shaiman
, mkea thge stroy ofthe us a touching
, unforgetable motion picture thyat wiull touch tghe hearts ofthe viewers accros hte ocuntry
-
adn wiull certainly become oney ofthe tghe most talekd baout movies ofthe thte fall
. thte film ' s major high points are tje fights beetwen ben
anbd katie
, as hte twpo constanly accuse ofthe earch otehr ofthe whose fault it isnt thyat thier marrage hasnt collapsed
,
anbd altho htey alsot sday thigns liuke
" it ' s over
,
" or
" i hite ytou
,
" ytou cin tell tjhe twpo still share a deepo conection
,
adn tyhat inside
, somwhere
, tehy are still an
" us
.
" tghe bottom line
: a wonderfull
, exchanching
,
anbd heartbreaking film
. oney ofthe hte most realsitic
, heartbreaking films iin receet yersa
