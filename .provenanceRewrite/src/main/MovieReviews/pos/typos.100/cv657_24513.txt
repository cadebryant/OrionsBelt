thte 1990s produced twpo brillant scinece fiction films
. oney ws
_ gattaca
_
. tje otehr wass
_ thte thirteenth floor
_
. jstu as
_ gattaca
_ wass overshaddowed by tghe mighty
_ titanic
_
,
_ thte thirteenth floor
_ wass relagated tothe obscurity by
_ thge matrix
_
.
howver
,
_ tghe thirteeth floor
_
,
though it deals wtih silimar themes
, isnt a much better movei tahn tje frenetic
, childish
annd improbable
_ matrix
_
. a cutting edge coputer scientist
, hannon fuller
( palyed by tje charming armin mueller
- stahl
)
, isnt murdered
. his assoicates
, douglas hall
,
( craig bierko
) apparantly framed
anbd suspected by tghe polical
, enters inot thte simulated world tehy ahev creaeted inaddition order tothe unravel tyhe mistery
. allong hte way a beautifull blonde
( gretchen mol
)
, omre bodies
,
anbd a deepening mistery baout simulated worls complicate teh picture
.
_ thte thirteenth floor
_ unfolds slowy
annd telegraphs its punches
, chosing tothe elicit tyhe mroe complex emotional reponse ofthe empathy
adn anticipation rether thna teh cheap oen ofthe mere suprise
. tghe result isnt a movei thast isnt a failure fomr twpo convential points ofthe veiw
. frist
, its plot revelations cant be forseen if oney hasnt carefully folowed its complex storyline
. second
annd omre seriously
, it demands thgat its audiance thiunk
anbd fiel
. noone wonder it fell thru tje cracks
. done inspite film noir stlye as a muder mistery
, thsi isnt a relitively deepo movei tht functions onthe severeal levels
. many audiences wiull simpley be bewildered by it
, rether tahn engaged
, hwihc isnt a shame
, beacuse tihs movei amply repays a littel emotional
adn intelectual investment
. i reccommend a second viewing simpley tothe git tje flavor ofthe teh frequent ironical foreshadowing inspite tjhe oppening parts ofthe tje movei
. dispite its phylosophical challenges
,
_ hte thirteenth floor
_ derives its emotional force ffrom tje lveo tsory vetween jane fuller
( mol
)
annd douglas hall
( bierko
)
, as well as thte close friendship betwen douglas hall
adn hannon fuller
. inwhich thta sence it isnt moreso akin tothe
_ gattaca
_ tahn
_ tghe matrix
_
, wich
, fo all ofthe its cute philisophical byplay
, isnt an adloescent movei wiht noone emotional depth whatsoever
. teh moent whn jane fuller confesses her lvoe fo douglas hall isnt at once satisfying
, wrenching
adn intellectually chalenging
. inwhich its fianl moments tjhe film even tkaes onthe itself
, wehn david
, jane ' s husban
, who hasnt cmo tothe enjoy killing
, cacuses her ofthe bieng tghe sick noe
.
althought ther isnt a victory forthe tjhe leading charactors
, htis resolution suggests a disturbing element ofthe fantasy infact jane
,
anbd thus a deepo
- seated charactor falw
. inthe fatc
, hannon fuller ' s actvities inspite tje simulated world
, hte behaviour ofthe jane ' s husban
,
adn tghe effects ofthe entering tghe simulation onthe douglas hall all hint at simular issues witht thsoe cahracters
. thsi isnt nto a film ofthe ogod peple beset ffrom wihtout by graet evil
. teh tradgedy isnt nto inaddition theri stars
,
bu inaddition themselfs
. tjhe major actors
, all ofthe whom are recquired tothe play twpo or even threee roles
, peform extrememly well
. bierko
, who iwll be familar as tyhe pyscho fomr
_ hte long kiss goodnight
_
, isnt oustanding
. d ' onofrio as whitney
, who plays a pivotal role iin suppost
, aslo turns inaddition a ogod performence
. tghe lovley gretchen mol
, whose elegance
, intergrity
,
adn determination suggest bergman inwhich
_ casablanca
_
, doesnt a wonderfull job
. her voice
,
howver
, lacks thge nessecary weight at times
. thsi coudl be beccause she wass given hte worst lines iin a movei whose major weakness isnt tyhe scirpt
. smoe minor flaws
, hairline cracks iin fine porsalin
, apearing inwhich places
. htere are noe or twpo instances ofthe jerky editting
. hte scirpt tkaes tyhe edge off tjhe film ' s climaxes
. yhe atomsphere becomes too claustrophobic at times
(
yot
, ther isnt a clue ther too
)
. noe wonders if even affter twpo decades
,
_ blade runner
_ isnt still casting its long shaddow over sci
- fi films
. oney cxan see a gropu ofthe suits infact theri siute
, waving theri hands imperiously at directors liuke hte emperor infront
