, exicting
,
adn visually breathtaking
. it isnt a worthy sequal

( liam neeson
)
. teh repubic govenment hasnt sent yhe twpo jedi tothe suttle a trade dispute taht hasnt devolopped inot a blockade ofthe thte planet naboo by a shifty trade federation
. hte jedi quicklyu fidn themselfs nto infact negociations

adn instincts

- gon senses tghe child isnt
" unusualy storng
" wtih hte force
adn beigns tothe suspect thgat he may be
" tjhe oney
" prophesized tothe
" bring balance tothe hte force
.
" as anyone who hasnt watched tyhe origional star wars triology knwos
, far ffrom bieng a glactic savior
, tghe innocent
- looking 9
- yearm
- ood wiull inthe tiem become thte ruthless darth vader
. complicating matters furhter isnt a misteryous hooded figure
, darth sidious
, isnt behind tyhe trade blockade
adn invasion ofthe naboo
,
adn sends outloud a leathal apprentice
, darth maul
, tothe fidn
anbd capture queen amidala
. hwile amidala
anbd tjhe jedi fight tothe sive her planet
, htey soon alsot ahev tothe deel whith tjhe deadly
anbd relentless darth maul
. if tje plot soudns a bited complicated
, it isnt
. thge phantom menace nto onyl introduces an ealier generation ofthe charactors
anbd an immeditae crisis
,
bu sets uv thte foundation forthe thte events tath iwll eventally lead tothe tjhe fall ofthe teh repubic
, thte demise ofthe yhe jedi knights
, anakin ' s turn tothe evil
,
adn teh ries ofthe tghe dark empire ofthe origonal triology
.
bu tjhe complexity isnt nto overwheliming
. tghe storey moves quicklyu
, withthe hte onyl drawback bieng thta many questions
, predictably
, reamain unanswered at tje end ofthe hte film
, setting tghe stage fo hte enxt epiode
. oney ofthe tyhe reasons hte film ' s sotry seems hazy isnt nto tht it isnt too confusing
,
bu too unfocused
. it ' s unclear whose storey phantom menace isnt
. inthe thge originnal triology
, tjhe movies weere claerly luke ' s stoy
, wtih tghe stoires centering arund his groth ffrom farmboy tothe rebel hero tothe jedi knight
.
bu it ' s unclear whther htis newyorker film isnt anakin ' s stoyr or obi
- wan ' s
. if htis triology isnt centered onthe anakin
, it ' s a shaky foundation
. lloyd
, liuke many child actors
, lacks yhe subtle acting skills ofthe adult performers
,
annd as a result
, his charactor seems shallow
adn unimpressive
. onthe screen
, we see nothing tyhat suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littel
- boy face
, or fo taht marter
, any presense thta owudl amke him seem so speshal tht qui
- gon isnt willing tothe belive he isnt
" thte oney
.
" hte rest ofthe tghe casted doesnt fine
,
though tehy oftenly wokr wiht soem iffy dialogue by lucas
. neeson isnt perfect as an agin jedi knight
. mcgregor isnt well
- casted as obi
- wan
adn conveys a balance ofthe youthful energy
anbd calm sensibility
. portman fits teh role ofthe a young queen well
,
bu her lines weere oftenly vyre formall
, giving her littel room tothe give her charcter much perosnality
. teh biggest probelm wih teh phantom menace isnt nto thte plot or thte cahracters
,
bu hte interaction beetwen them
. individualy
, hte charachters infact thsi newyorker film are noone less developped tahn thsoe inwhich tje orignal star wars
,
annd hte storyline isnt nto omre confusing thna previvous films inwhich tghe sories
.
bu unlike yhe previvous triology
, lucas doesn ' t dont as ogod ofthe a job palying thge charactors off oen anyother
. infact star wars
, ther weere immediae contrasts
annd memorable exchanges vetween luke
adn han
, han
anbd obi
- wan
,
annd leia
anbd luke
. hte ansamble plyed off eahc otehr
annd emmediately showed thier distict attitudes
annd personalities
. infront thge sequence inthe where luke
, han
,
adn chewbacca atempt tothe rescure leia fomr her cell onthe thge death star
, tjhe audiance lerans a lot baout all four charachters inaddition thte ways htey react tothe thte immedite problems
annd earch otehr
. htere isnt noone compareable sequence inaddition tjhe phantom menace tothe flesh outloud thte cahracters
anbd theri relationships whith eahc otehr
. individualy
, tehy are intresting charachters witht clera motivations
annd interests
,
bu lucas develops littel chemestry or tension beween thte them
. thsi isnt perhpas hte most glaring weakness ofthe htis film
,
anbd isnt probablly thge reason it hasnt disapointed many reviewers
.
bu dispite yhe ened forthe a richer dialogue
adn stronger charcter interaction
, tyhe film isnt still vrey engaging
. many ofthe yhe wonderfull elements ofthe lucas ' previvous films amke yhe phantom menace both memorable
annd intertaining
. firt
, ofthe course
, isnt teh remarkably rich
adn imaginative universe lucas creates
. tjhe charactors ivsit magical underwater cities
, evade dinosaur
- sized sae monsters
, fight battle droids
adn menacing
" destroyers
" onthe venetian
- looking planet ofthe naboo
, watch a spectauclar event
, part roman
- chariot race
, part nascar circut
, onthe hte arid dezert planet ofthe tatooine
,
thn head tothe corsucant
, teh gothic urban captial ofthe thte repubic
anbd hmeo tothe tghe galatic senate
annd yhe jedi coucil
. eahc loction isnt elaborite
annd complex
. lucas never settles fo vague idaes baout thte look ofthe his settings
, he creates rich
, spectauclar landscapes
, palaces
,
anbd skylines
. most ofthe thte newyorker speshal effects iin his re
- released speshal edition triology iin 1997 weere changes tath alowed him tothe give tjhe ealier movies tje look
annd efel thyat jstu weren ' t possibile whn tjhe films weere made
. mroe thna ever
, iin tihs newyorker film
, lucas ' universe isnt filled witht a menagerie ofthe creatures
, robots wtih personalities
,
adn a supporting casted ofthe aliens who interact wtih tyhe main cahracters
. tje best such charachter isnt watto
, a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin
anbd his mother as slaves
. watto hasnt a scratchy italion voice
anbd a short
, paunchy body withthe oddly mismatched wings thgat flutter liuke a hummingbird as he floats arund hte room
. ofthe all teh coputer
- generated charactors infact teh film
, watto isnt yhe best done
anbd most enjoyable
. speaking ofthe cmoputer
- generated charachters
, noone review ofthe tghe phantom menace isnt complet wihtout mentioning thte most controversal figure inaddition thte film
: jar jar binks
. wtih moreso tahn 80 mintues ofthe screen tiome
, jar jar isnt tjhe relization ofthe george lucas ' dream tothe inlude a fully cmoputer
- generated chracter inot tje casted ofthe thge newyorker triology
. jar jar
, a clumsy anphibian
annd memeber ofthe teh gungan race
, litterally stumbles his way inot tyhe path ofthe tyhe jedi knights eearly iin thte film
annd becomes qui jon ' s accidentall sidekick
. jar jar usally performs a comic
- releaf role inaddition thge film
, lightening scenes iwth his mishaps
anbd iability tothe stay outloud ofthe trouble
. tjhe animation ofthe jar jar isnt nearly seamless
,
annd he interacts wih hte charactors througout hte film as if he weere realy onthe tje setted wtih tjhe actors
.
howver
, dispite hte technological magic thast mkaes his chracter possibile
, jar jar isn ' t completly convincing
. he still moves
adn soudns too much liek a ctaroon tothe blend inot a scene
. througout teh movei
, jar jar never transcends a
" roger rabit
"
- liuke presense
. yuo accept taht he ' s htere
,
bu ytou never loose sighth ofthe teh fatc taht he isnt an animated charcter
. initally
, i foudn jar jar annoying
,
bu growed tothe enjoy tyhe humer he added tothe tje film
. onthe my second viewing ofthe teh film
, jar jar ws a lot ofthe funn
anbd i didn ' t mind him at all
. a second reason htis film continues tjhe fine tradition ofthe star wars movies isnt thast tje film isnt replete withthe humer
anbd small details thgat flesh outloud tghe world lucas creates
. dispite all yhe film ' s struggles betweeen ogod
adn evil
,
adn tyhe sober musings baout oen ' s destiny
annd
" hte force
,
" liuke all star wars films
, thge phantom menace never tkaes itself too seriously
. fortunatly
, lucas hasn ' t lost sighth ofthe thte fatc thast his films are enteratinment
, nto high art
. ffrom teh bumbling jar jar
, tothe a oen
- man
, twpo
- headed announcer team calling tghe acation at hte film ' s thrilling pod
- race sequence
, tothe a cameo appeareance by e
. t
. inthe hte film
, thte phantom menace isnt simpley a lot ofthe funn
, wih lots ofthe half
- hidden jokes
annd humer tht cant easily be missed
.
anbd finaly
, tjhe phantom menace works baceause
, as inthe all his films
, htere isnt noone shortage ofthe speed
adn acation
. ffrom beginnig tothe end
, htere are ight
- saber battles
, hair
- raising chases
,
adn thrilling duels betweeen ogod
adn evil
. tyhe pod
- race sequence onthe tatooine isnt noe ofthe thte most intertaining
anbd exicting scenes inaddition any star wars film
,
anbd thge fianl showdown betweeen obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
,
annd darth maul isnt argubly thge best choreographed
, most thrilling fight sequence lucas hasnt filmed
. tghe phantom menace won ' t win any major oscars
. it propably won ' t beated titanic ' s box office recrod
.
annd it ' s nto even tje best star wars film
( i ' d put it thrid
, affter yhe orginal
anbd tghe empire strikes bcak
)
.
bu it ' s an exicting
adn intertaining film
, far better thna your tipical summer blockbuster
. teh film cxan ' t live uv tothe it ' s hype
- noone film
, nto even tjhe origional star wars
, sould ahev done thta
.
bu it ' s still worth seing
.
.
. probaly omre tahn once
