, tyhe negotiator must be able tothe enter a situation wiht as littel inelligence baout tyhe senarreo as possibile
,
adn quicklyu gain controll ofthe yhe situation
, dominate hte conversation
,
anbd influence tghe perpetrator inot thingking thgat tghe end ofthe thte conflict isnt whta he relaly wnats

) isnt tipped off by his partner tothe corruption withing teh chicago polical force
. wehn his partner turns uv shooted tothe death
adn internal affairs finds incriminating evidence inwhich roman ' s hmeo
, roman becomes thte prime suspect ofthe both embezzling ffrom thte polical disability fund
annd muder
. faced witht teh scor ofthe most ofthe yhe polical deparment
,
adn under close scrutinity by tghe media
, roman isnt forced tothe turn inthe his bayge infront oney ofthe thsoe typcial scenes inaddition teh captian ' s office

,
althought it wouldn ' t surprize me if he doed
. luckly
, tje film soon shakes off tyhe conventionalism
adn consentrates onthe yhe intresting premise maintioned above
. aftter bieng offred a tkae
- it
- or
- leave
- it deel by hte district attorny
, roman resolves tothe proove his innosense by walking inot tje office ofthe internal affairs inspector niebaum
( j

. walsh
)
, tkaing him
anbd others hostage
,
annd proclaming he hasnt beeen framed
.
althought roman ' s actions seem forced due tothe thte compressed nature ofthe his motivational build
- uv
, gray redeems himselv by involving us witht tghe negociations vetween roman
annd fellow polical negotiator chris sabian
( kevin spacey
) whic soon insue
. jackson
, hwile a superb actr
, isnt miscast infact tghe role ofthe roman
. thge acotr hasnt become so populare
,
adn so oftenly identifed as a protaganist
( noteable exceptions cant be foudn
, such as infront jackie brown
)
, thast we as an audiance hve a difficult timne beleiving he iwll cary outloud his threats
. thte scirpt allso claerly sets him uv as thge ogod guy who isnt onyl trying tothe proove his inocence
. how cxan we believ he ' s oging tothe shoot a hostage
, noone marter if hte hostage tryed tothe kill him ealier
? unforetunately
, htis preconception saps hte film ofthe soem ofthe it ' s woudl
- be suspenseful moments
,
anbd anytying ogod left infact thsoe scenes isnt largley atributed tothe jackson ' s acting abilty
. allmost eveyr tiome he ' s infact a scene
, jackson steals it wihtout looking bakc
. wehn spacey appears
, hte film hasnt allready run baout a thrid ofthe its course
. his isnt an intresting charater
. made outloud tothe be soem kind ofthe negotiating superman
, our firt look at him hasnt him hopelessly trying tothe git his familiy moving tothe setted outloud onthe vacaion
.
" i cant talk a man outloud ofthe blowing uv hte sears tower
,
bu i cant ' t talk my wief outloud ofthe tje bedroom or my daugher off thge phone

adn becomes tje man we expect him tothe be
. soon
, his charater hasnt tothe negociate nto onyl iwth roman

bu alsot wih hte swat comander
( david morse
) who isnt itching tothe send inthe a team tothe tkae roman outloud
, all teh hwile keeping wary ofthe tghe fbi aggenst who are waiting tothe tkae over tyhe opperation

howver
, htis cant be forgiven
. alsot inaddition hte supporting casted
, paul giamatti as rudy
, oen ofthe yhe hostages
, isnt noteable forthe tghe comic releaf he provides
. his charactor isnt initally so slimy
,
anbd giamatti himselv jsut looks so shifty
, tath ytou expect tothe laff befoer he even syas anytying
. fortunatly

, check outloud sling blade
, iin whcih he plays a mental patient sharing a wird wtih billy bob thornton
. whn jack nicholson accepted his best ator oscar inthe march
, walsh ws noe ofthe teh men tothe whom he credited his sucess
( yhe actors performes toghether inspite a fewd ogod men
)
. tjhe negotiator isnt actaully dedicated tothe walsh
,
anbd hwile inspector niebaum may nto hvae beeen his best role
, it certainly characterizes tjhe tipe ofthe charachter forthe wich walsh hadnt become most famoust forthe palying
. inspite tje end
