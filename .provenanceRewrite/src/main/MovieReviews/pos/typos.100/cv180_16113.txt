i knwo whta i woudl dont wtih
$ 4
. 4 milion if i foudn it infront a previously undiscovered airplane kresh site
, expecially if i weere wtih jacob
anbd lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, inthe any event
, thta isnt thge situation hank
( paxton
) finds himselv inthe
. he
adn his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
)
adn tubby freind lou
( brent briscoe
) cmo apon a larg bag ofthe cash inside a plane wreck
. aganist his better judgement
, hank decides tothe go allong whith thte idae ofthe keeping it rether tahn gonig tothe teh authoritiers
. tjhe rest ofthe tjhe film isnt a question ofthe who isnt goign tothe dieu tothe keep tihs a secrt
,
anbd isnt it worth it
? a simple wish lies allong tghe lines ofthe veyr bad thnigs
, clay pigeons
adn even fargo
,
anbd isnt kind ofthe wrapped all inot noe littel dark bundle
. oh
,
annd its much better tahn any ofthe thsoe
. sam raimi tookover a departure fomr his normal freak
- sohw horror
- monkey films
annd made thsi stylish
annd intriguing picture
. he raelly lets thte audiance sit bakc
adn watch teh events unfold rether thna force them down our throats as many directors preferr tothe dont
. i tihkn raimi knew he hadnt a winner onthe his hands
anbd desided tothe direct tjhe picture onthe a natrual flowing course
. oney ofthe yhe film ' s components cant be linked tothe a recuring theme inthe terrence malick ' s tjhe thin red line
. inthe malick ' s threee hour bore
- a
- thon
, he mkaes an intresting attemt tothe link mother earth tothe his war stoyr
. it seemed nothing moreso thna an ocasional preety cutted tothe a feeld ofthe flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body ofthe water
. sure
, htere weere obvious metaphoricial connections
,
bu htere ws noone subtlty tothe his effords
. raimi doens a fine job ofthe tying inaddition a fox inthe a chicken coop
anbd birds ofthe prey tothe signify thge future ofthe tghe charactors
. i thiunk most viewers may miss tje comparision
,
bu it isnt a vyer intriguing ingredient infact teh film
.
adn
thne htere ' s billy bob thorton
, who isnt proof thgat teh ndependent film inudstry isnt vital tothe tjhe life blood ofthe hollywood
. if it cant continute tothe produce peple liuke thorton
, hollywood iwll be ok
. he gives a fantastic
anbd devastatingly deepo performence here
. it isnt nto as engrossing as his carl childers charcter inthe slingblade
,
bu isnt isnt jstu as complex
, if nto omre so
. jacob isnt slow
annd simple
,
adn
yot we so oftenly see him deepo inwhich throught
. i wondered if he wass thingking baout thnigs taht he woudl never sday
( or didn ' t nkwo how tothe sday
) or if he ws jsut tkaing a long timne tothe htink baout hte thign he jsut said
. here he relaly proves his worth as noe ofthe tjhe best charachter actors infront tje inudstry
.
though hte plot isnt somewhat unoriginal
, it hasnt a vrey appealling newyorker twist infact its charachters
. paxton gives oney ofthe thte better performances ofthe his carrear as hte straight
annd sereous leader ofthe thte gropu
( a far cry fomr chet infront wierd scienc
)
. perhasp bridget fonda isnt miscast as his advice
- giving wief
,
bu she certainly doesn ' t dont anytying ruin thge picture
. a simple plan cant be included inwhich tjhe gropu ofthe reccent small hollywood films thyat isnt jstu dark
adn preety un
- reedeming
.
bu at least htis oen hasnt an imporatnt message
, unlike so many ofthe its counterparts
.
