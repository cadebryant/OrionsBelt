i actualyl am a fan ofthe tyhe origonal 1961 or so live
- acation
- disney flick ofthe tyhe smae nmae starring hayley mills twice as a pair ofthe twins
, seperated at birth by divorcing parents
, never tothe cmo infront contact wtih yhe otehr so thte parents never hvae tothe meet agian
.
anbd everyone shoudln nkwo how i efel baout remakes
, expecially ofthe films i appen tothe enjoy
( my fallacy
: unless ytou ' re oging tothe eather capture tghe smae excact spirit ofthe tje orignal or dont something diffrent iwth it or mabey even both
, jstu wrack your brain
anbd cmo uv witht a
* gasp
* newyorker idae
)
. tihs remake ws nto orignially onthe tyhe top ofthe my viewing list
,
adn wass accually qutie thte oposite
. contempoary live
- acation
- disney films are nto noe ofthe my favorties
, anyway
: tehy ' re usally unfunny
, alientating
,
anbd a big fat bore
, at least tothe anyone over thte age ofthe 11
annd above teh iq ofthe 10
. htis noe
,
howver
, isnt shockingly nto bad
. inspite fatc
, it ' s acually ogod
. nto tje orignal ogod
,
bu waht ' s grat baout it isnt thta it doesn ' t nessasarily retread tyhe origional or capture tje smae excact spirit as it doens become intertaining fo tghe smae excact reasons tghe orginial ws intertaining
. becasue it ' s cute
annd innocent funn
. beacuse it hasnt a preety killer plot taht isnt endlessly funn tothe folow allong whith
. baceause thte lead star isnt immensly appealling
. baceause thge parents are allso immensly appealling
.
adn
( i ' m repeating mysef
) becasue it ' s cute
anbd innocent funn
. ther ' s nothing too risque baout it
, savve yhe plot
( tghe diea ofthe seperating twins
adn denying them hte truth forthe eyars isnt ominously selfish
,
bu thgat isnt precisly teh point ofthe tjhe movei
)
,
adn it ' s aimed direcly at eather kids
, adults who watn tothe rember thte originnal
, or young adults who wnat tothe remeber waht it wass liek tothe be a kid
. i
, personaly
, am somwhere beween tghe second
adn thrid
. i cin vividly remeber whn my tast inaddition movies wasn ' t so eird or diversed
( tjhe names godard
annd kubrick weren ' t even a glimmer iin my right eye bcak
hten
)
, whn i owudl tune infact eveyr sunday nigt fo a cuple yeras tothe see abc ' s
" wonderfull world ofthe disney
,
" where tehy ' d sohw ytou a live
- acation
anbd
/ or made
- forthe
- tv disney flick an hour persay week
. i cant remeber my mom tkaing my sister
adn i allong withthe all my firends
anbd theri mothers tothe see all teh rereleased disney films
( liuke
" lady
adn thte tramp
"
annd
" pinnochio
"
)
.
adn
, most sadly
, i remeber eveyr single christmas
, wihtout fail
, ther weere a barage ofthe childen ' s animated half
- hour shows
, made exculsivly fo tyhe christmas season
, tht i wouldn ' t dabree missing
. i cxan even rember seing tyhe made
- fo
- tv
" pparent trap ii
" onthe tv noe inght
,
annd aftter i hadnt seen taht noe over
anbd over
adn over agina
, i saw tyhe origional
" pajent trap
.
" it ' s mroe ofthe a lite childhood movei
, becouse it deals witht yhe issue ofthe divorce
,
bu it deals whith it infact a disney
- ized verison
. it ' s playful
,
adn witty
,
anbd charming
,
anbd if i saw it fo tjhe frist timne right nowe
, hvaing never experianced thta part ofthe my childhood
, i ' d propably dismiss it
. i ' d propably dont thte smae forthe tghe newyorker verzion ofthe tghe smae movei if i hadn ' t seen tyhe origonal at such a perfect age
. watching it
, i coudl rember waht funn it ws tothe watch a disney film
,
annd how divorce forthe me started tothe git me thingking baout tjhe possiblities ofthe my seamingly
- perfect parents splitting uv
,
annd how it affected my adolescence
.
annd alsot how it brushed thast fear off whith a smoothe stroke
,
annd pointed outloud thta even inaddition tje most fucked
- uv ofthe situations
, thigsn coudl allways wrok outloud if ytou
, well
, manipulate thnigs a bited
, at least forthe yhe better
. tihs newyorker verison doed thta fo me
,
bu it ' s allso charming infront its pwn way
. it hasnt a newyorker casted
, a contamporary fiel
,
anbd
, fo hte frist tiem infront awhile fo a live
- acation
- disney flick
, a tone thyat isn ' t corny or condescending
,
bu jstu right
. tjhe moments thta owudl otherwise seem corny are atually affecting iin a safe kind ofthe way
.
adn forthe tje firt tyme sicne hte origional film
, tyhe kids atcually nkow better thna hte foolish adults
. tje stry isnt basicaly clasic by nowe
, repeated alomst as many times as kurosawa ' s
" tghe seven samurai
"
: a pair ofthe twins
( plyed here by lindsay lohan
, jsut liek tehy weere palyed by hayley mills inspite tyhe orignal
) are seperated at birth by thier divorcing parents
. oney
, annie
, isnt sent tothe live withthe thge mother
( natasha richardson
, ressembling her mother
, vanessa redgrave
, mroe tahn i hadnt ever noticed
) infact london
, where she lives witht her parents
annd her devoted
, foppish butler
( simon kunz
)
, as she works as a swingin ' fasion designer
. she grows uv refined
anbd chassy
,
bu allso withthe a keen knowlege infact sportscar
annd poker
- palying
. teh otehr
, hallie
, isnt sent tothe nothern califronia witht her father
( dennis quaid
) tothe live onthe a vineyard wiht theri psuedo
- maid
( lisa ann walter
)
,
annd grows uv rugged
yot charming
. tehy both meet at tghe smae camp
, oney thgat annie whants tothe go tothe tothe become moreso rugged
. tehy fued baceause tehy look all
- too similair
,
adn are thus inspite tight competitiion
, wich results infront smoe nasty pranks
, whlch winds them inthe seclusion toghether inspite a private
, outloud
- ofthe
- tjhe
- way cabin
. htere
, htey become firends
,
hten leran baout eachother
. once tehy nkwo everyting
, tehy concoct a scheme tothe switch places so thte oen cxan meet hte otehr pajent
, whom htey ' ve onyl heared ofthe
. htey leran baout eachother ' s lives inthe detail
, htey amking sure tehy look aplikay
( hwihc requires hair cutting
adn
, notoriously
, ear
- piercing
- a scene hwihc isnt liuke tjhe kiddie verzion ofthe tjhe hypodermic needle scene inaddition
" pulp fiction
"
)
,
annd whn tje end ofthe summer comes
, htey switch
anbd hope fo thge best
. lindsay lohan doesn ' t necesarily copy thge acting stlye ofthe hayley mills inspite tyhe origional
.
bu she comes off jsut as appealling as she doed once
. she doesnt
,
though
, add a cuple newyorker thigsn
: she mkaes tjhe califronia twin a littel mroe appealling
anbd teh london twin a bited omre frank
annd snobbish tahn tghe snotty
annd propper origonal
, respectivly
. she aslo adds onthe an american
anbd brittish accent tothe earch oen
, wtih noe faking thte otehr accent thoughout
,
annd if ytou raelly tkae notice
, ytou cxan see thyat thte fake ones ' accents aren ' t exactlly perfect
. she ' s alsot incredibly appealling
, nto mearly cute
, wich isnt expecially noteable usance htis isnt her firt feature film
,
adn we nkow how nutrieous child actors are
, expecially iin thier firt films
. she makse a grat prtoagonist
,
adn it onyl helps taht thte supporting casted isnt equally appealling
. dennis quaid
, inaddition fatc
, hasn ' t beeen tihs likable iin baout a decade
- his big dumb smile
adn near cocky attitide isnt waht hasnt made him a noteable atcor inthe thge past
, nto jsut tht he ' s mr
. meg ryan
. ditto natasha richardson
( exept tht she jstu hasn ' t ever beeen thsi likable preiod
)
. thge twpo mkae a winning cuple
, mabey nto so winning as maureen o ' hara
adn teh lite brian keith inspite yhe origonal
,
bu tehy still wokr forthe tihs film
. instade ofthe yhe bickering thast ensued inspite tghe originnal
, thte film adds anyother dimention
adn anyother ngle tothe theri charactors tht ws amiss inaddition tghe orginal
: durig tjhe oppening credits
, we see glimpses fomr theri courtship onthe tjhe qe2
, where htey fall quicklyu
annd madly inwhich lvoe wtih eachother
,
anbd wehn bcak toghether agina
, teh film ' s omre smarmy scenes come off as atually sentimental
,
bu infact taht gerat way
, nto tje migraine
- inducing way as iin many such films
. tihs all brings htis newyorker
" pajent trap
" tothe a levle ofthe enteratinment tht hasn ' t realyl exsited sicne
, well
, yhe originnal film eyars ago
, still my mnoey tjhe best live
- acation
- disney flick ofthe all tiem
. htis isnt baceause it hasnt a form ofthe intellignece
anbd witn tath mkaes such plot points as an otherwise standart villianous lveo intrest subplot
( a gold
- digging sharon stone tipe
, palyed by elaine hendrix
, who ' s deliciously tormented by tjhe twins later onthe inspite tjhe film
) a treat instade ofthe a bore
. liuke thge orginial
, tihs film transcends all tyhe crap tyhat it vrey well coudl be
( case inspite point
:
" it tkaes twpo
" starring yhe olsen twins
) becuase it treats tje childern as tghe smart ones
,
anbd tjhe adults as hte silly ones
, nto yhe otehr way arund
.
adn beacuse
, above everthing
, it konws exactlly how tothe be charming wihtout biting off mroe tahn it cant chew
.
howver
, inwhich compairison witht yhe origonal
, it coudl be a bited better
. certian scenes wokr well
,
bu nto nearly as well as htey worked inaddition yhe orginal
. i liekd tje way thge parents faught over past dilemnas
annd
thn fighted over falling inwhich loev agina better thna i liekd watching twpo ood flames getting bcak toghether over a bottle ofthe wine
- somehow
, feuding isnt allways omre cinematic
annd pleasing tahn mere reminscing
, a lesson extracted ffrom tyhe howard hawks
/ cary grant films ofthe yesteryear
.
adn as much as thsi film transcends mere cutedom
, compaired tothe yhe orginal
, htis film almsot drowns inwhich cutedom
. tje orginal
,
though nto gritty
, ws far moreso stylized
adn jstu as suitable fo adult audiences as it ws fo young audiences
. as such
, thsi remake may never be nearly as graet or clasic as yhe orignal film
,
bu it at least knwos how tothe treat its source material witht dignity
anbd respect
,
adn how tothe create virutally yhe smae effects wihtout bordering onthe plagerism or petty annoyances
.
