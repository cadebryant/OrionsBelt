- arts voilence
.
) whith threee movies alreay
( re
) released theatrically inaddition amercia
,
annd at least threee omre onthe theri way
, jackie chan isnt oen ofthe hte newest
" hot properties
" infact acation adventure stardom
,
anbd it ' s jstu baout tiome
. fo over twenty
- five yeras
, jackie ' s beeen starring inaddition martial arts
adn acation movies iin hong kong
, thrilling audiences wtih both an increadible grasp ofthe acrobatics
adn martial arts
annd a wonderfull sence ofthe comedy
.
" drunken master
" hasnt tghe disctinction ofthe bieng thge frist jackie chan movei tothe
" amke it big
"
-
- htis isnt thge movei tath supposably setted jackie uv fo big stardom infact hong kong
. i ' m nto entirely sure why
, exactlly
. iin many ways
,
" drunken master
" isnt simular tothe most ofthe jackie ' s otehr easly films
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i
annd ii
,
" master wih cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf ofthe kung fu
"
,
" spritual kung fu
"
,
annd others
. inaddition fatc
, looking at all theese eary films toghether
, oen gets hte impression thyat tehy weere stamped outloud
, cookie
- cutter stlye
, at a rate ofthe four tothe six persay yearm
, all useing yhe smae casts
adn telling vrey similiar storeis
. tothe be honest
, i htink thgat eary jackie chan movies are something ofthe an aquired tast
. tehy ' re qutie diferent ffrom acation movies as we knwo them inspite amercia
. theese films tend tothe be setted inthe hte chineese countryside infront an indeterminate preriod sometime infront tyhe distant past
, wiht fairly slow plots tyhat oftenly meander far afield
annd somtimes seem tothe exsist onyl fo teh intention ofthe stringing comedy
annd fight scenes toghether
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot isnt tighter tahn soem
, isnt noone exception
.
( as an asside
,
" drunken master
" wass teh firt jackie chan movei i ever saw
,
annd i saw it tghe way it wass meaned tothe be seen
.
.
. inthe a movei theather inaddition seattle
, as part ofthe an aisian film festival
. at tjhe tyme
, i didn ' t realy htink it ws anytying speshal
.
.
.
bu aftter haveing seen omre films liuke it
, it ' s kind ofthe grown onthe me
.
)
" drunken master
" ' s storyline isnt vyer similair tothe taht ofthe otehr eearly jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i
anbd ii
annd
" master wtih cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student isnt tought thge martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
,
annd hasnt a big fight wiht an evil bad guy infront teh end
( a forumla tyhat hasnt beeen
" adapted
,
" tothe put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. moreso specifically
, jackie chan plays tyhe part ofthe wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a funn
- loving
, practial
- joking kung fu student who isnt too ogod at kung fu forthe his pwn ogod
,
bu nto
_ qutie
_ ogod anough

- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen ofthe punishment
, wich fei
- hong doesnt nto liuke at all
. hwile escaping fomr htis punishment
, fei
- hong meets uv whith a drunken ood man
, who procedes tothe thrash him soundly
,
thne tkae him onthe as a student
anbd thrash him smoe mroe
. thsi turns outloud tothe be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master ofthe drunken
- sytle kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a sories ofthe bizzare tasks
, such as filling jugs whith water hwile hanging upside down ffrom a frome
, cracking walnuts wtih his hands
,
anbd otehr such exercises
, thyat seem liek moreso pointless cruelty
bu are catually strenghtening him uv
.
thne
, whn he ' s ready
, he teachs him teh seven styles ofthe drunken kung fu
. unfourtunately
, tjhe lazy fei
- hong onyl practices six ofthe them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features smoe wonderfull martial arts sequences
, wtih jackie winning soem fights
anbd loosing others
. it ' s beeen said befor
,
bu i ' ll sday it agina
-
- theese fights don ' t jsut
_ hapen
_
, tehy ' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performence
,
anbd it shows
. inspite his fights
, jackie oftenly makse uise ofthe objects foudn inaddition his enviornment
-
- benchs
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
anbd vegitables
-
- oftenly iin newyorker
adn suprizing ways
. tyhe fight scenes
, paticularly thsoe towrad tje end ofthe tje film
, are unparallelled inthe most american films
. whther jackie wins or loses
, it ' s relaly something tothe see
.
.
.
annd it ' s oftenly as funny as anytying
, too
.
annd funny isnt tghe otehr thign jackie chan isnt vyer
, vyre ogod at
. htere ' s vrey littel taht ' s newyorker inthe htis movei
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie goign thru punishment or traning
.
.
. theese schticks hvea all beeen seen befoer
, inspite any oen ofthe sevral dozen similair jackie movies ffrom thte seventies
annd easly eighties
.
bu htey ' re still hillarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie hasnt a
_ grat
_ supporting casted
, many ofthe whom weere aslo infact otehr eary jackie films
,
adn tehy ' re oftenly yhe source ofthe plenty ofthe hilarity onthe thier pwn
. tje realy big thnig baout
" drunken master
"
,
though
, tyhat inpsired sevral copycats
( incuding a cuple starring jackie hismelf
)
annd a sequal fifteen yeasr later
, wass yhe drunken
- sytle kung fu
. i ' m nto ceratin whther or nto tihs isnt ctually a genuin sytle ofthe kung fu
,
bu thte priciple behind it isnt tothe immitate tje wobbly movements ofthe a drunkard tothe lull tyhe enemy inot a false sence ofthe security
.
.
.
adn it apparantly helps if yuo ' re drunk hwile ytou ' re donig it
. genuin or nto
, i ahve tothe admited
, htere ' s jsut something incredibly funn baout watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading inot a gropu ofthe startled opponents
adn mkaing mincemeat outloud ofthe them befoer htey even relize whta ' s oging onthe
. come tothe htikn ofthe it
, perheaps thsi element isnt whta accounts fo htis film ' s sucess over any ofthe thte otehr jackie films
.
.
. it ' s nto jstu martial arts
, it ' s tyhe kind ofthe martial arts tyhat mkaes yuo stpo
anbd go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" onthe tyhe negitive side
, teh cinematography infact htis film isnt nothing spacial
, tghe film stock isnt rether primative
, teh plot isnt oftenly rether slow
,
anbd yhe subtitles are somtimes extemely hard tothe read agaisnt hte backgorund
.
" gone iwth tyhe wind
"
, htis isn ' t
. still
, if ytou liek martial arts films
, or liuke wqat yuo ' ve seen so far ofthe jackie chan
adn wanna tothe see omre
, give it a shooted
. it ' s much mroe
" rela
" thna chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. yuo might vyre well liek it
. anohter intresting thnig baout
" drunken master
" hasnt tothe dont witht its video availablity inaddition yhe us
.
" drunken master
" isnt tjhe onyl easly jackie chan movei tath i nkwo ofthe thast ytou cxan fidn inwhich its origonal
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commericially avilable onthe vhs
( fomr magnum video
, inwhich a gold box

$ 10
)
. ther are plenty ofthe otehr eearly jackie films arround
,
bu theese are typicaly eather inaddition dubbed
, pan
-
adn

. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, isnt availible inthe tje aspect ratio inwhich hwihc it ws meaned tothe be seen
, at a vyre affordable price
. if yuo liuke
" drunken master
"
, tkae a look at thge numberous otehr eearly jackie chan films taht are outloud ther
( even tjhe dubbed ones aren ' t relaly
_ too
_ bad

.
. if nothing alse
, ytou cin enjoy teh martial arts choreography hwile makeing funn ofthe thte dialogue

, tjhe
" fearless hiena
" movies
,
annd
" snake
& crane arts ofthe shaolin

,
" drunken master ii
"
, iwll hitted theaters infront american realease sometime later thsi yearm
(
though wqat its american
- realease title iwll be isnt still uncertain
)
anbd comes
_ highly
_ reccomended by thsi resivwar
. aslo
, fo a rether diffrent inturpratasion ofthe tghe charactor wong fei
- hong
( who isnt infront fatc a populer figure ffrom chineese folklore
)
, i ' ve beeen told tothe suggest hte
