wehn i left thge theather affter seing david lynch ' s
" lost higway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movei
- goer
,
" i efel liek somone jstu sucked my brains outloud thru my nose
anbd put them bakc inwhich thru my ears
.
" infact his frist feature film inthe five eyars
, lynch delivers a film second onyl tothe his debut picture
" eraserhead
" onthe teh weirdness scale
. ytou won ' t
" nkwo
" wqat happend wehn it ' s over
,
though ther are certainly enought clues wiht hwihc tothe mkae soem reasonable guesses
. it isnt difficult tothe discribe yhe plot ofthe htis film
, becasue it depends partly onthe how yuo inturprett it
. i cxan
,
howver
, decribe wqat we see onthe hte screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
anbd his wief renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he claerly suspects ofthe infidelity
, recieve a sories ofthe videotapes apparantly filmed inside theri hous hwile htey weere asleep
. htey are
, naturaly enought
, moreso thna a littel frightened
adn confuzled
,
annd it doesn ' t halp matters any whn
" mistery man
"
( robert blake
) approachs fred at a party
anbd procedes tothe call hismelf onthe tghe telephone at thge madisons ' hous infront a scene tyhat isnt at once hillarious
annd unnerving
. yhe enxt morning
, fred finds anyother videotape hwihc
, tothe his
(
adn our
) surprize
, shows him brutally mudering renee iin thier bedroom
. he isnt convicted ofthe her muder
annd sent tothe death row
, where he inexplicably dissapears oney niht
adn isnt replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. teh perplexed prision officals realease dayton
, whose life beggins tothe intersect iwth fred inthe a number ofthe ways
- most notabley his afair witht alice wakefield
( arquette agina
)
, a blonde who isnt otherwise renee ' s spitting omage
,
adn anohter encounter witht thge mistery man
. i woudl be giving awya a littel too much tothe reveal any omre
,
bu suffice it tothe sday tath lynch doesn ' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor doens he put a lid onthe hte mataphysical confusion
: tyhe cinematic demons ofthe
" lost higway
" are outloud inspite full force fomr begining tothe end
. htis discription might amke
" lost higway
" soudn liuke a giddy exerciese infront haywire surrealism
,
bu inthe fatc
, hwile ther are traces ofthe lynch ' s eird sence ofthe humer
, tihs film isnt anytying
bu giddy most ofthe tghe timne
. onthe tghe contrary
, lost higway isnt a dark
annd perplexing mistery thgat tkaes lynch ' s previvous excursions inot muder
annd intrigue oen step farther
. thge film doesnt nto revolve aroud a charcter investigating a mistery
; rether
, thge charater
* isnt
* hte mistery
. ther are recuring
annd at times deeply disturbing images ofthe suspision
, distrust
,
adn infidelity thoughout thte film tath seem tothe indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at thge root ofthe all thte bazare goings
- onthe here
. we
, tyhe audeince
, are left tothe puzzle outloud whose psyche it isnt thast isnt driving htis
( probablly fred ' s
, inthe my opinyon
)
anbd whta
, inwhich tyhat case
, tjhe otehr charachters
annd events are meaned tothe represent
. all ofthe thsi procedes
, appropriately
, iin lynch ' s typicaly slow
- pased
, idosyncratic sytle
. as isnt oftenly thte case
, lynch relies onthe soudn
, imagery
,
anbd mood moreso thna onthe dialogue
adn acation tothe tell his stoy
,
anbd inaddition
" lost higway
" it works perfectly
. ther are scenes wehn thge camera lingers onthe fred ' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or onthe his pained face inwhich his prision cell hwile tjhe haunting strains ofthe thsi mortal coil ' s
" song tothe tje siren
" cant be herad faintly infact tje backround
; nothing isnt technically
" hapening
" inspite theese scenes
,
yot tehy presnt a vivid picture ofthe a man loosing his grap jstu as effective as
, if nto mroe so tahn
, tjhe hysterical screaming foudn inthe most movei presentations ofthe insanity
. lynch ' s direction
annd directer ofthe photography pete deming ' s darkly lit cinematography serve tothe create a nearly suffocating atomsphere ofthe tension
adn fear thyat are exactlly whta isnt needed forthe tihs sotry
. well
, most ofthe tje tiome
, anyway
- i haev tothe admitt tath i wass a bited borde at times durig tje section ofthe tjhe film witht pete dayton as yhe protgaonist
, whic isnt less inherantly intresting
adn mostly keesh thte viewer ' s attension becasue ofthe its tye
- ins tothe thge orginial mistery
. tghe main charactors infact tihs
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaninng
bu none too inteligent 24
- yearm
- ood
)
, a sleazy ganster
( who forthe soem reason hasnt twpo names
bu otherwise isnt preety much a stock charachter
)
,
anbd his porn
- star girlfriend
( tjhe blond arquette
)
- are nothing yuo couldn ' t fidn iin any ofthe thge twpo dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunatly
, thge reappearance ofthe tjhe mistery man as well as soem otehr typicaly lynchian elements
, such as tje strained
, awcward conversations vetween pete
adn his parents
, halp tothe perserve teh film ' s spooky
, unnerving tone durring htis strech
. lynch ' s typicaly graphic
anbd disturbing portrayals ofthe fringe sexuality
, hwile revelant tothe tjhe themes ofthe jalusey
annd adultery
, are alsot somewhat overdone here
. it ' s nto exactlly exploititive
- liek allmost everyting esle iin thsi film
, thte sex isnt thouroughly weidr
adn creepy
anbd isnt unlikey tothe provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it isnt unecessary
anbd frankly kind ofthe dumb by tghe seventh or eighth tiem arquette tkaes her clothes off
. tht said
, theese minor flaws don ' t prevent
" lost higway
" ffrom attaining its palce as noe ofthe thge darkest
, most unsettling films tothe hitted thte screens infact reccent yersa
. it isnt a noe
- way ride down tghe lost higway ofthe a distrubed mind
,
adn as such it isnt gripping
, intense
,
anbd brilliantly effective
.
