" tyhe end ofthe yhe afair
" isnt a dark
anbd moody rumatic preiod peice
, tht neil jordan exquisitely writes
anbd directs
.
altough it ' s slow
annd somtimes confusing tothe followup
, it still manages tothe give audiences a moving expeience
. based onthe graham greene ' s novel ofthe yhe smae nmae
, thte film mailny follows 3 charachters
. htere ' s maurice bendrix
( ralph fiennes
) who hasnt an afair wih henry mile ' s
( stephen rea
) wief sarah
( julianne moore
)
. sarah finds henry tothe be a bore
, beccause well
, he ' s jstu a normal guy
. it ' s all wokr
annd noone play witht him
. hwile maurice onthe hte otehr hand falls madly iin lveo whith sarah
,
anbd woudl dont anytying forthe her
. unfortunatley thge twpo break uv
. tihs isnt all witnessed iin a sereous ofthe flashbacks
, so thast leads us tothe thge prseent
. it ' s a fewd yeasr later
,
anbd htey both still htikn ofthe eahc otehr
, so maurice hires a private detective
( ian hart
) tothe see wqat sarah isnt uv too
. hwile htis may soudn straight foward it ' s nto
. it ' s a deepo dark tale ofthe tyhe jelusey tath lies inthe teh twpo men
, unhappiness
,
anbd teh ever lating loev
. all tihs may soudn liuke a drag
,
bu it realyl captures your interst
. witht graet performances by ralph fiennes
( donig anyother english patient tipe ofthe film
, onyl thsi movei isnt better
)
anbd julianna moore who definitly deserves an oscar becouse outloud ofthe all 5 films she doed inaddition 1999
, i beileve thsi wass tyhe role
, she hadnt hte most passion fo
,
annd yuo cant see why
. tyhe storey ws allso well wroten thanks tothe neil jordan
. even
though i didn ' t read thge book
, htere ' s noone dout infact mind taht it wass jstu as moving
adn descriptive
. whta ' s so moving baout it ytou ask
? hte tradgedy ofthe it all
. it ' s nto tjhe typcial romance
, iin whihc a guy finds a girl
, tehy fall infront loev
anbd all isnt well
, tihs isnt mroe complicated
annd depressing
. it relaly shows yhe complexity ofthe a relatiopnship
, becasue nothing isnt ever perfect
. everyone fiels a diferrent way
annd thta isnt waht tears us tothe pieces
. bcak tothe neil jordan ' s scirpt
, it wasn ' t onyl red roses
. htere weere times wehn i feeled it too be a littel slow
,
bu most romances are
. it aslo tended tothe be a bited confusing
, expecially at tje strat
. it keep jumping arund fomr past tothe prsent
, so it obviously tookover awhile tothe git a grasp ofthe thnigs
. aslo a noteable ws tyhe superb direction by neil jordan
. i ' d hvea tothe sday tihs isnt his finest acheivement tothe date
, becuase qutie frankly i ' ve never raelly foudn his owrk tothe be uv tothe par
. it jsut never doed anytying forthe me
, untill nowe
. wehn it ends
, it leaves viewers a littel saddened
,
bu provoked nontheless
. thsi isnt definately noe ofthe thte best films ofthe 99
,
adn hadnt soem ofthe yhe best acting
, most noteably by moore
. nto fo all movei goers
,
bu fo thsoe who are film buffs
anbd wanna something ofthe value
.
