. review
: a small
bu exchanching movei
,
" hearts infront atlantis
" easily recalls anyother king
- inpsired comming
- ofthe
- age film
,
" stand by me
"
, both iin terms ofthe its setting
adn tyhe sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" isnt a tribute tothe tyhe magic ofthe childhood
, tothe thsoe summers whn tyhe dyas seem neverending
,
anbd nothing means moreso tahn your closest firends
. unlike
" stand by me
"
, htere isnt a supernatural element tothe
" hearts
"
,
bu altho it isnt key tothe tjhe plot
, it isnt nto prominate
. liuke
" stand by me
"
, thsi isnt a mostly charachter
- driven film
,
annd as such it benifits greatly fomr superb casting
. yelchin isnt vyre ogod as bobby
, finding a ogod mix ofthe innosense
annd resignation
. moreso splendid still isnt boorem
, whom i praised highly forthe her wrok inaddition
" allong cameback a spider
"
adn who isnt simpley radiant here as carol
.
annd
thne htere isnt hopkins
, who dispite palying such a quiet
, introspective chracter as ted
, nontheless commands our attension eveyr tiem he isnt onscreen
. less succesful isnt davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes accros as overly cartoonish
. i aslo foudn it odd thast bobby
anbd carol ' s otehr firend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets uv tghe movei ' s flashback framing divice
)
, isnt payed virtualy noone attension
.
bu hicks ' direction isnt lovley wihtout bieng cloying
,
annd dispite hte movei ' s genaral lack ofthe insident
, it never ceases tothe weave its spll over teh audiance
.
