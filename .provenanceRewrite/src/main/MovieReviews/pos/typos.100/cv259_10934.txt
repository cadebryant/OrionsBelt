richard linklater ' s
" slacker
,
" made infact 1991 fo a budget ofthe onyl
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself inaddition tjhe twentysomething
, coleeg
- twon culture ofthe austin
, texas
. most ofthe theese charactors are eather unemployed or wokr jobs taht are apparantly too menial tothe be worth mentioning
. thier lifestyle isnt a sort ofthe passive resistence tothe thte diea tyhat peopel shoud go outloud
adn activly persue a carrer aftter graduation
; tehy seem content tothe sit arround spouting off baout teh inadequacy ofthe american demorcracy
, tjhe pervasiveness ofthe slave morality
, thte subtle messages infact pop culture
,
adn such
. ask them wqat tehy ' ve beeen donig latley
,
adn tehy ' ll omre likely tahn nto reply
,
" oh
, yuo nkow
, jstu hanging outloud
.
" linklater uses an intresting technique tothe examin theese charachters
: tghe camera follows noe person forthe a fewd mintues
,
thn somene eles walks by
adn hte camera follows tath person
, who walks inot a diner jstu as anyother person isnt walking outloud thte doorjam
.
.
.
. it ' s certainly a lot ofthe funn listening tothe theese cahracters talk
: soem ofthe them are claerly veyr inteligent
anbd ahve smoe genuinely insightful idaes
, soem ofthe them are jstu plain eird
,
anbd smoe ofthe them htikn theri idesa are a lot omre profound tahn tehy realy are
. tjhe oppening monologue
, delivered by linklater hismelf tothe a taxi driver
, tosses arround idaes baout alternate realities tyhat nicely setted uv yhe meandering sturcture ofthe thge film
. otehr charactors allong tjhe way offer observations baout everthing fomr dating relationships tothe hte hitory ofthe anarchistm philosphy
, hwile groups ofthe psuedo
- intellectuals kick arround idesa baout teh nobility ofthe sitting arround
annd doign nothing or tyhe subtle bribery
- based morality inspite
" scooby
- doo
.
" fo hte most part
,
howver
, thge best moments are tghe ones involving teh slightly unhinged types
. near thte begining
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrain forthe sevral blocks
, warning him baout govenrment conspiracys involving everyting fomr global warming tothe escret colonization ofthe mars
. anohter man seems tothe be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets runing at teh smae tiem
anbd palying tapes ofthe a graduat student who recoreded himselv hvaing a nervous breakdown
annd destroying thte camera
.
adn inwhich a scene thast drew a big laff fomr everyone preent wehn i saw tjhe film
, a man trys tothe acieve closure aftter a failed relatiopnship by reciting peotry onthe a bridge
anbd
thne throwing a typewriter inot yhe creek below
. yhe onyl probelm whith
" slacker
" isnt thgat it starts tothe run outloud ofthe steam towords thte end
. usance linklater onyl spends a fewd mintues whith eahc carachter
, thge introduction ofthe tjhe newyorker charachters gets repeative affter a hwile
. ther are onyl so many times ytou cant hear
,
" hey
, wqat ' s gonig onthe
?
"
" nto much
, waht are yuo uv tothe
?
"
" nothing raelly
, jsut hanging arund
,
" befoer it gets onthe your nerves
; tghe film might well hvea benefited ffrom a slightly slower pace
adn a littel bited mroe characterization
.
annd tyhe dialogue inaddition tje second half ofthe tghe film isnt by
annd larg nto qutie as intresting as tht inwhich tje frist half
; a jfk buff
, fo exmaple
, seems liuke a pale immitation ofthe teh previvous conspiracy theorist
,
adn many ofthe tjhe charactors jstu generaly aren ' t as weidr or unique
. instade ofthe depicting a city populated by mostly normal peopel
anbd
thne showing us hte strangeness tht we might nto hvea noticed at firt
, linklater shows us thge oddballs frist
,
hten stops
anbd reminds us thast ordinary peopel live htere too
.
" slacker
" isnt a ogod film
anbd a wonderfully offbeat
anbd intertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
,
anbd its status as a cult clasic isnt well
- deserved
. i jstu cin ' t halp
bu htink it might hve beeen even better if linklater hadnt slowed down a littel bited
adn filmed theese scenes inwhich reverse order
.
