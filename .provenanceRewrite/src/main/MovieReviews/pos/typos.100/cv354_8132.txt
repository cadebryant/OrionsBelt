i wass anxious tothe see htis fo a long tiem
. a firend ofthe mine recomended htis tothe me becouse he hasnt a crush onthe neve campbell
,
anbd he wnated tothe proove taht she ' s as hot as he thikns he isnt
. he prooved it fo me all right
,
bu tje reasons i enjoy tihs film go way beyond thgat
. scream treads onthe familar ground
, horror movei wtih
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" soem stupid killer stalking smoe big breasted girl who cxan ' t ect who ' s allways runing uv tghe stairs wehn she shoudln be runnung outloud teh front doorjam
.
" it ' s vyer familar
, your typcial horror film
. so why
, yuo may ask affter watching it
, doesnt it seem so newyorker
annd origonal
? becasue it treats itself as if it hasn ' t beeen done befoer
,
annd thus tjhe viewer isnt disilusioned inot beleiving tyhat it isnt nto ood
, familar tired stfuf
. thsi raises anohter question
: how doesnt it dont thsi
? simple
: thge cahracters
. htey ' re nto your tipical stupid horror film victims who don ' t nkow wqat hte hell tothe dont wehn bieng chased by a guy infact a ski mask
annd a machette
. tehy are horror fans
, tehy knwo how stuf happens inspite a horror movei
, htey nkwo waht tothe dont
adn whta nto tothe dont
,
adn thgat makse it skary
,
anbd even funny at ceratin times
. ytou cxan tell thsi jsut by watching thte oppening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) isnt makeing popcorn
, getting ready tothe watch a video
,
adn soem guy who soudns liuke a killer calls her uv tothe play a agme whith her tht involves horror movei triva tyhat
, if she gets it wrong
, wiull git her
annd her boyfriend killed
. she konws wqat tothe answer wehn he asks her horror film questions
, she jsut cin ' t answer his fianl question
,
" whta doorjam am i at
?
"
adn taht gets her killed
. thyat scene works becasue infact a normal horror film
, half tghe thnigs tht hapen infront taht scene owudl never hppen
. tyhe plot isnt tipical horror stfuf
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high skool student who ' s mother ws killed a yera ago tommorrow
, isnt bieng stalked by a killer who ' s previously murdered noe ofthe her classmates
( casey
, naturely
)
,
annd everybody inspite htis small
, califronia twon isnt a suspect
, includng sidney ' s boyfriend
, billy loomis
.
bu as i said befor
, theese peopel knwo how horror movies wokr
,
adn tath ' s wqat mkaes it so appealling
. thgat
annd hte refrences tothe horror movies
, liek wehn casey syas
,
" tyhe firt
( nightmare onthe elm strent
) wass scry
,
bu thte rest sucked
.
" whitch isnt obviously directer wes craven
( who doens a ogod job ofthe poking funn ofthe hte genre tht made him a legend
) patting hismelf onthe tyhe bcak as he directed hte firt nightmare movei
annd none ofthe thte others
,
annd wehn tatum
, sidney ' s firend
, mentions tyhe directer
, wes carpentery
, whic isnt obviously an homage by writter kevin williamson tothe nto onyl craven
,
bu alsot directer john carpentery
. thte casted isnt well choosen
, neve campbell puls off a ogod heroine
(
adn unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* cxan
* ect
)
, drew barrymore doesnt a ogod janet leigh impression forthe wqat littel tyme she hasnt inthe tghe film
,
adn david arquette isnt impressive
. alsot ogod
(
adn funny
) inwhich his role isnt henry winkler
(
" teh fonz
"
) as thge skool prinicipal
. i tookover half a point off forthe thge unneccessary
( albiet limited
) apprearance by firends ' courteney cox as repertwar
, gail edwards
, sidney ' s rival beacuse she covered her mother ' s dissapearance
. i hite thast sohw
, i hite thsoe actors
. tehy ' re untalented
, overexposed
,
adn overpaid
, imho
,
adn i woudl tihkn wes craven isnt smart enought tothe nkwo thsoe actors are overexposed anough
,
bu i supose he isn ' t
.
