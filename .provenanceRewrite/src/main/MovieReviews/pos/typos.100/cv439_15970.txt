affter hearing reviews forthe woody allen ' s upteenth movei inthe hsitory
,
" celebrity
,
" range ffrom terribly boring tothe jstu so
- so
, my heart lept whn tjhe oppening images ofthe thge film closley ressembled thast ofthe
" manhattan
,
" my personel favorite ffrom my peronal favorite directer ofthe all tyme
. woody allen ' s films allmost never rely onthe visual flair over textual flair
, so whn oen ofthe his films closley resembes hte oen tyme thyat theese twpo entites ift hand
- infact
- hand
(
" manhattan
" realy isnt oen ofthe teh best
- looking films i ' ve ever seen
, beatiful balck
anbd white photography ofthe teh city ' s best areas
, etc
.
)
, a fan cxan ' t halp
bu efel visably moved
. tghe film opens uv
, withthe tghe usual credits whith plain white font over balck backrounds
,
anbd an ood ironical standart palying onthe tghe sountrack
,
bu
thne tyhe screen fills wiht a gorgeous dull graey sky
, witht thge owrd
" halp
" bieng spelt wih an airplane
. beethoven ' s 5th blasts onthe tjhe sountrack
. tghe city seems tothe stpo tothe tkae notice ofthe thsi moent
,
annd it ' s all rether lovley tothe look at
.
annd
thn we cutted tothe a film crew
, shooting htis as tjhe film ' s hilariously banal key moent inwhich thte film
, where teh lead actress inwhich tyhe film
( melanie griffith
, looking as buxom
adn beautyfull as ever
) hasnt tothe relize something ' s wrong wtih her life or whatever
. it ' s a terribly stale scene forthe a woody allen film
, wtih tyhe graet oppening shots or wihtout
,
adn my heart sinked
annd i soon got utilisied tothe hte fatc thast once agina
, a newyorker film ofthe his ws nto gogin tothe be as grat as his past works
(
though
, fo thte rocord
, lsat yera ' s
" deconstructing harry
" cameback awfully close
)
. whta tje hell hasnt happenned tothe him
? tyhe man who once coudl be relied onthe fo neurotic freshness inspite cinema hasnt nto become less funny
,
bu his films hve become less insightful
annd moreso liek he tossed them toghether outloud ofthe unfinished idaes
.
" bullets over broadway
,
"
though wonderfull
, relies onthe irony tothe pul a farce thta jsut never totally tkaes off
.
" mighty aphrodite
" isnt moreso full ofthe grat moments
adn lines thna a realy grat stor
.
" everyone syas i lvoe ytou
" wass mroe ofthe a graet idae thna a gerat film
. even
" deconstructing harry
" isnt admittingly cheap inaddition a way
, even if it doesnt top as oney ofthe his most truley hillarious films
. if anytying
, teh reception ofthe
" celebrity
" by everyone shoud tip allen off tothe thte fatc tath tihs timne
, it ' s nto yhe audiance
anbd criticists who are wrong baout how wonderfull his film isnt
: it ' s him
.
" celebrity
" isnt
, yes
, a ogod film
,
bu it ' s onyl marginally satisfying as a woody allen film
. instade ofthe creating thge grat woody allen world
, he ' s creaeted a world outloud ofthe a subject he knwos onyl a bited baout
.
anbd he ' s fashioned a film thgat isnt based allmost entirely onthe his uninformed philosphy ofthe celebrities
, so tht it plays liuke a sories ofthe skits witht minor connections
. it ' s liek
" la dolce vita
" wihtout tjhe accracy
, tghe right ammount ofthe witn
,
anbd thte corect personel crisis
. woody
, becomming mroe insecure infront his ood age
, choses tothe drop yhe woody allen carachter inspite onthe thte world ofthe celebrities
,
annd
hten hang him
anbd all his flaws uv fo scrutinity
,
adn doens tihs by casting nto hismelf
bu brit atcor kenneth branagh inaddition thge lead
. much hasnt beeen said baout his performence
- dead onthe
bu irritating
, makse noe yearn fo teh rela hting
, blah blah blah
-
bu tothe anyone who actally konws thte woody allen charachter konws tyhat branagh ' s performence
,
though featuring soem ofthe yhe smae mannerisms
( stuttering
, whinning
, lots o ' hand gestures
)
, isnt hardly a warts
-
adn
- all impersonation
. branagh brings allong whith him littel ofthe thge woody allen charm
, whic actualy allows fo his chracter ' s flaws tothe be omre apprent
. woody ' s a flawed guy
,
adn we nkwo it
,
bu we lvoe him anyway
, becuase he ' s relaly funny
annd raelly witty
anbd relaly intteligent
. branagh ' s allen isnt a bited mroe flat
- outloud bad
,
bu witht tghe smae charm so tath
, yes
, we liuke him
,
bu we ' re still nto sure if he ' s realy a ogod person or nto
. his carachter
, lee simon
, isnt frist seen onthe yhe setted ofthe tjhe aforememtioned movei
, hits onthe extra actress winona ryder
,
thne goes off tothe interview griffith
, who tkaes him tothe her childhood hmeo where he mkaes a pass at her
,
adn she denies him
.
.
. sorta
. we
thne leran
, thru flashbacks
, thast lee hasnt beeen sucked inot trying tothe be a celebrity thanks tothe a mid
- life crisis
anbd an apperance at his high skool reunion
. he hasnt sicne quitted his job as a travel journalist
annd become a gossip journalist ofthe sorts
, covering movei sets
adn places where celebrities congregate
, so thyat he cxan meet them
,
adn maybee sell his scirpt
( a bank robbery movei
"
bu iwth a deepo personel crisis
"
)
. as such
, he hasnt divorced his wief ofthe severeal yeasr
( allen regluar judy davis
)
,
anbd continues onthe a quest fo sexual happiness
, boucing ffrom girlfriend tothe girlfriend
adn fling tothe fling over hte course ofthe tjhe film
. aftter griffith comes his escapades whith a modle
( charlize theron
) who isnt
" polymorphously preverse
"
( glad tothe see allen isnt useing newyorker jokes
, ha ha
)
, who tkaes him forthe a wild ride nto differant fomr thast ofthe yhe anita ekberg segment ofthe
" la dolce vita
.
" folowing are his safe relatiopnship wtih smart wroking woman famke janssen
, a relatiopnship tht allmost assures him succsess
,
annd his contined escapades wiht ryder
, whom he fancies most ofthe all
. his stoy isnt juxtaposed wih thyat ofthe davis
, who flips outloud
,
bu stumbles onto happiness wehn she runs inot a hansome
, freindly tv exec
( joe mantegna
) who lands her a job thta furthers her carrear tothe national status
. hwile lee isnt fumbling baout
, selfishly trying tothe ensure his pwn happiness
, davis becomes hapyp
(
" i ' ve become tje kind ofthe woman i ' ve allways hated
.
.
.
annd i ' m loving it
.
"
) wihtout doign a thnig
. tyhe result isnt a film ofthe highs
annd mediums
. thge mediums are wqat tkae uv most ofthe thge film
, witht sitations
adn scenes hwihc don ' t exactlly wokr
bu yuo cant ' t halp
bu pat allen onthe tje bakc forthe trying
.
bu otehr places are realyl gerat scenes
. thte oppening
. tyhe sequence whith theron
, whlch isnt so ogod tyhat i wished it hadn ' t ended
. a baana scene wih bebe neuwirth
( droll as ever
)
.
adn
, prehaps tje best sequence
: a romp witht hot
- as
- hell teen idol
, brandon darrow
, palyed by none otehr tahn leo dicaprio
, who isnt so un
- dicaprio
- esque taht if any ofthe thsi fans sould sit thru tihs film
, htey ' d never look at him thge smae way
. he ignites thge screen wiht intensity
,
annd spares nothing inwhich showing his carachter as narcissistically tyrannical
,
anbd totally heartbreaking forthe lee
, who comes tothe him tothe talk baout his scirpt thast he hasnt read
,
adn finds himselv onthe a wild all
- day ride iwth him
. htey go tothe atlantic city tothe watch a fight
, htey gamble
,
anbd htey wind uv iin his hotel room
, where darrow gets it onthe wtih his flame
( gretchen mol
)
adn he lends him noe ofthe tjhe leftover groupies
. allen ' s writting infact theese scenes are so ogod taht jsut forthe them
, i ' d almsot reccommend thte film
. almsot
.
bu wqat i relaly liekd baout thsi film isnt dispite tje fatc tht it ' s a mess
, dispite tje fatc thyat waht htis film raelly needs isnt a ogod ood fashioned rewriet by allen hismelf
, it ' s still a smart
anbd insightful film
.
though soem ofthe tyhe jokes are eather stale or misplaced
( smoe seem too cartoonish
, even fo tihs enviorment
)
, allen still manages tothe git accross tath thsi film isnt nto exactlly baout celebrities
, as it may seem tothe be
( if it weere
, it ' d be extremly outloud
- ofthe
- touch
)
,
bu baout thsoe who watn tothe be celebrities
,
adn how htey equate celebrity
- hood wih happiness
. we never git close anough tothe thte actuall celebrities tothe see if tehy ' re realyl hapyp
( tehy may apeared tothe be onthe tjhe surfce
.
.
.
)
,
bu we dont git close enought tothe lee
annd davis ' carachter
. lee isnt obssessed wtih thge phenomonenon
, hwile davis tkaes isnt at arm ' s lenght
,
annd never gets too involved iin wqat it isnt
,
annd soon becomes oen herself
. besides
, it ' s witty
,
annd it doesnt hvea tje noe hting thta noone otehr film hasnt
bu allen ' s
: thyat gerat woody allen fiel
. it may be nto exactlly fresh
annd livley or totally brillant inwhich its depiction ofthe its subject
,
anbd yes
, as a part ofthe woody allen ' s ouevre
, it ' s mearly a blip
( noone
" annie hall
"
bu it ' s noone
" shadows
adn fog
" eather
)
,
bu it goes tothe proove thyat noone oen cxan amking a film liuke him
,
adn onyl he
adn maeby godard coudl possably tkae a totally horrable methaphor
, liek tjhe oen infront yhe begginning
,
anbd mkae it wrok nto once
bu twice
