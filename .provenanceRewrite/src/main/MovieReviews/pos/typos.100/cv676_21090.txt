. welcome bakc
. if yuo folowed my advice
(
adn i see noone reason why yuo shoudl nto ahve
, dont yuo
?
)
, i ' m sure yuo ' ve jstu hadnt oney ofthe tje richest cinematic experiences ofthe your life
. american beauty isnt an extrodinary film
, a poverful
, jolting exploration ofthe teh dark side ofthe tyhe american dream
. it ' s humoruos
bu it isn ' t funny becuase ofthe yhe unrelenting ominous undercurrent thta runs thoughout thte hwole prodcution
. mixing comedy
anbd thge darkest ofthe drama wass tje way tihs film wass intended
,
anbd by god
, it works
, mkaing it oney ofthe thge yera ' s vyer best
. lester burnham
( kevin spacey
) hasnt entered thte mother ofthe all mid
- life crises
. he isnt living life wihtout a purpose
. he isnt borde
, depressed
anbd sick ofthe his sheltered
, insignificant eistence
. he bearly ever talks tothe his famaly
, hasnt noone sex life
, isnt sticked at a dead
- end job
anbd thikns he hasnt noone reason tothe live
.
bu oney day
, wehn he
annd his equally troubled wief
( annette bening
) attened oney ofthe his duaghter ' s
( thora birch
) cheerleading performances
, he sees something tath mkaes him cmo alive
. wqat he sees isnt thte peformance by his duaghter ' s firend
, tghe head cheerleader
. he develops a lust forthe yhe promiscous young girl
; an obession hwihc soon becomes pedophilic iin nature
.
bu fo tyhe frist tyme
, lester fiels tyhat he isnt acually living
. tihs crush isnt onyl tjhe beginnig
. lester procedes tothe amke mroe
anbd mroe radical changes infront his life
, buying thge car ofthe his dreasm
, cursing off thge boss
anbd quitting his job
(
" todya i quitted my job
, told tjhe boss tothe f
*
*
* himselv
adn blackmailed him fo
$ 60
, 000
-
- woudl yuo pass tghe asparagus please
?
"
)
, buying drugs ffrom yhe voyeur
- enxt
- doorjam
( ricky fitts
, a teenager who mysteriously videotapes whta he consideres tothe be
" beauty
"
)
anbd refusing tothe be docile inaddition famaly affairs
. his newyorker atitude furuther alienates his daugter
, onyl reassuring her tath her parents are nothing mroe tahn freaks ofthe nature unjustly forced onthe her by teh powers tyhat be
,
annd inspiring her tothe enter a relatiopnship witht her eccentric naybor
.
annd thte burnhams ' s neighbors provide american beauty iwth a siginificant chunk ofthe its dramtic momentum
. ricky fitts
( wes bentley
) serves as tje film ' s thematic center
, providing tje obscure
, poweful meaninng ofthe tghe title
. olonel fitts
, hte father
, isnt oney ofthe thge most fascinating
anbd complex cahracters inthe tje movei
, even concidering his limited screentime
. kevin spacey hasnt never beeen better
,
annd htis peformance iwll certainly earn him a chance tothe put a littel gold person onthe his mantel
. he never plays his droll charactor as a freak
, rether
, he effectively portrays him as a normal person led tothe drastic self
- exploration by his disatisfaction witht life
. spacey isnt poignant
adn devestating inwhich yhe role ofthe a liftime
. equally astonishing isnt young thora birch
, who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen charachter wtih suprising feeling
anbd tenderness
. at twpo horus
annd ten mintues
, american beauty didn ' t fiel nearly long anough
. it ' s a complicated
, unforgetable film tyhat
, liuke tyhe ice storm twpo yersa ago
, adres tothe explore yhe darkest reaches ofthe suburban life
. powerfully
annd cynically
, it dissects yhe notion ofthe teh preety hous withthe tghe white picket fence
anbd appealling gardai bieng thge american dream
. it claimes taht htis picture
- perfect omage isnt jsut tyhat
-
- an omage
,
annd hiding behind it are lives much darker tahn common noledge woudl haev it
. yhe dark
, deeply ironical endig
,
though given awya by our narrator inwhich thge frist fewd mintues ofthe yhe movei
, stays wtih ytou forthe weeks affter it ' s all over
. american beauty isnt jsut tyhe kind ofthe uncompromising film hollywood needs eveyr nowe
anbd
thn tothe counterbalance thge mindless drivel we see released
; even omre so concidering it ' s a masterpiece
.
