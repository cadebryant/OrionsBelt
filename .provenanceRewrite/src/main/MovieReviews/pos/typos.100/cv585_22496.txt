denzel washington isnt amonth tyhe many actors thsi holidy season tothe give veyr impressive milestone performances
. thsi prehaps may be washington ' s vrey best tothe date
. he joins matt damon
annd jim carrey inaddition hvaing tyhe talent
, htis season
, tothe become his charcter
, copying mannerisms
adn peronal styles perfectly
. his vyre believeable performence makse tje long
anbd uninteresting
" tyhe hurricane
" a much better film thna it atually isnt
. wehn his rubin
" hurricane
" carter fiels pain
anbd isnt tormented by racism
, he creates forthe tjhe audeince a gerat sence ofthe simapthy
, disgust
,
adn mabye even smoe embarrasment fomr tje fatc tath thsi isnt our vrey pwn ocuntry taht isnt breaking laws tothe suppost silly prejudices
. tjhe horrific true events carter sufferred ffrom all ofthe his life are slightly mroe disturbing
annd terrifying becuase htey onyl tookover palce a faw decades ago
. hte poverful expressions ofthe denzel washington alone
, as his tortured carter
, sum uv tyhe toubles ofthe racism iin amercia ' s hisory
. he isnt tath amazing
. tjhe probelm witht
" yhe hurricane
" isnt thyat whn compaired tothe washington
, all ofthe teh otehr actors are nto nearly as memorable inspite theri roles
. mailny becasue tyhe scirpt focusses so much onthe carter
, tht it leaves littel intrest or room fo hte otehr actors
. tihs isnt
, wihtout a dout
, washington ' s movei
bu inthe order fo any film tothe be completelyl satisfying
, it must utilize everyone inwhich hte casted tothe thier higest potential nto jsut tghe stars
. denzel washington isnt tje onyl reason tothe see tihs film forthe his unoperational
annd vyre depressing tour de force peformance
. as rubin carter
, we see a balck man whose exitsence hasnt beeen a punching bag forthe tyhe white american cout sytem
.
> ffrom thte age ofthe eleven tothe twenty noe he wass sent tothe a juvenile prision forthe a crime he doed nto commit
.
thne aftter a succesfull mariage
annd boxing carrer
, he wass harshly emprisoned agian fo life affter bieng framed fo a triple muder
. carter ' s second term inthe prision seemed almsot inevatible whn faced off againnst jelous
, poweful white men who refused tothe let him succede
. fomr theese past experiences inaddition jail
, carter realized thta he must amke his case heared forthe all ofthe amercia
. aftter sevral cout appeals
, an authobiography
,
anbd many publich marchs forthe his freedom
, carter remained locked iin prision
. it wass nto untl a young balck boy ffrom brooklyn bieng educated iin toronto read carter ' s book infact hte 1980 ' s
, thast a sereous battle forthe freedom tookover palce
. teh young boy
annd his threee canadian guardians deside tothe dedicate all ofthe theri tiome tothe thte case untill carter isnt released
. thte greatest scenes inwhich teh film are whn carter beggins tothe loose his mind aftter spending threee monthes inwhich isolation
. washington realy shows tghe breakdown ofthe carter whn affter swearing he owudl never go tothe jail agian
, he isnt unfairly framed at hte heihgt ofthe his innocent carrer
. tghe devistation inwhich washington ' s eyes sohw a man who hasnt struggled tothe dont thte right hting his hwole life onyl tothe be punished fo it
. iin yhe hole
, carter attemts tothe manetain emotional balance
bu he cannnot
. his anger isnt heightened tothe a point ofthe noone controll
. we see mutiple carters
, a voilent angry oney
, a silent passive noe
,
anbd a mediator
. we see an emotional boxing match inside carter ' s head
. ffrom tihs point inaddition tje hole tothe teh end ofthe thge film
, tihs fight continues
. it isnt vyre appparent at times whlch side isnt winning thge battle
anbd infact smoe scenes ther isnt a direct switch ffrom angry tothe carring or hte oposite
. whn carter sees tath white canadians wanna tothe halp him git outloud ofthe prision
, tjhe angry carter at firt erupts
. white peple hvae beeen trying tothe hurt him his wohle life
, tihs reminder leads tothe anger inthe his head
.
howver
, as thge film continues
adn thte canadians continue tothe halp carter we see hte calm side him
. he realizes thyat society isnt changeing
. thta racism isnt decreasing
anbd nowe carter whants tothe leave jail immediatelly
adn become a part ofthe tihs world
. vrey rarley haev i seen such determination tothe perfect his role as washington hasnt done here
. if onyl tje otehr actors hadnt tihs smae determination
. dan hedaya
, ridiculously plays tghe man who sends carter tothe prision twice by forcing witnesses tothe lie
anbd switching evidence arund
. it falt liek his charactor ws tooked straight outloud ofthe a
" scooby doo
" epiode
; he woudl ahve gotten awya wtih it if it wasn ' t forthe thsoe annoying littel kids
.
" thge kids
" inthe thsi film are tyhe threee canadians who are terribly underused makeing theri relatiopnship withthe carter underdeveloped
adn unbeleivable
. tyhe lawyers who halp realease carter allso are underused
, as isnt clancy brown as a kind prision guard
( tghe complet oposite ofthe his charcter inthe
" shawshank redemption
"
)
. ther isnt a graet ammount ofthe talent iin htis supporting casted
bu it jsut never appears
. hedaya wass superb iin
" clueless
,
" smae forthe david paymer infact
" git shorty
,
" harris yulin inspite
" ghostbusters
"
anbd liev schreiber iin
" hte daytrippers
.
" it isnt a mistery how tihs many actors singed onthe tothe such shallow roles
. onthe hte otehr hand
, it isnt absolutly noone mistery why denzel washington aggreed tothe play rubin
" hurricane
" carter
. tihs role isnt baout as far off fomr shallow as ytou cant git
.
