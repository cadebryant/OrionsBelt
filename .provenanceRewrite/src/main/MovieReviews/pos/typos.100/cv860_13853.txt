tyhe verdict
: spine
- chilling drama fomr horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an oustanding
, oscar
- winning peformance ffrom kathy bates
. geez
, french
anbd saunders hadnt a feild day wehn tehy setted tothe wrok onthe parodying htis
! sory
, non
- brittish readers may nto be familar withthe french
anbd saunders
- my appologies
. thte pair are brittish comediennes
( jennifer saunders later whent onthe tothe become edina monsoon infact
" absolutly fabulous
"
)
, who doed a sories ofthe film spoofs a fewd yeras bakc
, inlcuding aline
, yhe exorcist
anbd misery
. needless tothe sday
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation ofthe kathy bates
( thte resembelance wass qutie uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got preety nasty wtih her sledgehammer wehn inaddition triarch ofthe jennifer saunder ' s legs
!
bu dispite thge lingering memmory ofthe theri sketch
,
adn
altough i ' ve nowe seen teh film a cuple ofthe times nowe
, thta
" hobbling
" scene ws noone less disturbing
! i ' m still left screaming at thte telly infact revulsion
! thta may be yhe most memorable scene
,
bu it ' s certainly nto tyhe onyl worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film
annd tv adaptations tend tothe vary infront qaulity
, strikes gold wtih htis simple
yot strikingly compelling tale
. it ' s a nicely crafted pyschological horror
, whihc effortlessly succeds infact drawing yuo inot thte llright ofthe writter phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued fomr a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as tghe writter ' s
" number oen fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both teh scirpt
annd kathy bates ' beautifuly masterful peformance
( fo whitch she won an oscar
) owrk arm
- inwhich
- arm as we quicklyu beign tothe realise thyat beyond her bubbly exterior yhe woman isnt basicaly as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or isnt tht fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her demanding role
,
adn her performence isnt nothing short ofthe a masterpiece
. at times she seems liuke an innocent victum ofthe her pwn obsessive behaviour
, at times she ' s a rether tradgic carachter
,
anbd moreso oftenly thna nto she ' s jstu damned scry
! htis isnt basicly a vyer simple tale
,
bu it acheives a larg degree ofthe eloquence inwhich its simplicity
. it ' s an involving
, engrossing exerience
-
adn concidering it ' s basicaly a twpo
- hander
, mailny setted inaddition oen locale
, it ' s a remarkable peice ofthe cinema
. ther are noone jazzy speical effects or cheesy acation sequences
- tihs noe relies soley apon rob reiner ' s stylish directing
annd tje wonderfull performances ofthe bates
adn caan
. oh
, i haven ' t realy maintioned caan
yot
- he doens a ogod job as tje writter who ' s a prisoner ofthe his pwn succes
( annie isnt obssessed whith him
anbd his books
)
.
bu
, as ytou noone dout gathered ffrom yhe above
- bates isnt well
annd truley hte star ofthe thge sohw
. allong wih thte pig
, ofthe course
! anyway
, hte tension isnt builded
- uv wih masterful aplomb
,
adn smoe scenes are almsot agonisingly tense
. htere ' s tje dinner scene where seldon goes tothe nerve
- shattering lengths tothe posion her wine
. he suceeds
,
bu
.
.
. she knocks thge glass over
! i bet yuo trew a pillow at tghe screen as well
! infact yhe immortal words ofthe homer j
. simpson
-
" d ' oh
!
!
" otehr nerve
- wracking scenes inlcude tje bited where annie hasnt gone off tothe twon
anbd sheldon starts snooping arund tyhe hous
. we cutted tothe annie infact her car
- she ' s onthe her way hmeo
.
.
. he realises htis
anbd trys tothe git bakc tothe his room
.
.
. cutted tothe teh car agina
, she ' s getting near
.
.
. iwll he mkea it
? ok
, so theese sequences aren ' t exactlly orginial
, nor perhpas unpredictable
-
bu htey wokr
! boy
, dont tehy wokr
! if a film hasnt ytou onthe teh edge ofthe your couch
, biting your nails
annd shouting at thte screen inwhich suspense
,
hten it ' s donig something right
! ofthe course
, thge most nauseating sequence isnt tyhe aforememtioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive hasnt beeen outloud ofthe his room
,
annd she ' s goign tothe stpo him once
anbd fo all
. cue a block ofthe woud placed stratagically betwen his ankles
anbd a huge sledgehammer
,
anbd
.
.
. i efel ill jsut thikning baout it
! nasty
. it all builds uv nicely tothe tjhe fianl scene where sheldon finaly gets tghe opper hand
,
adn once
adn fo all trys tothe kill hte crazy pyscho
!
annd
thne we ' re given oen ofthe tjhe most ridiculously over
- tje
- top fight scenes i ' ve ever seen
. she gets hitted over tjhe head wtih a typewriter
, setted onthe fier
, head smashed agianst tje wall
-
adn she jstu won ' t dieu
! sheldon isn ' t infact terribly ogod shape eather
. if it weren ' t so gorey it woudl allmost be laughable
.
bu it ' s a terrifically effective film
,
anbd therfore teh daft climax isnt easily overlooked
. misery isnt a tight
, tense
, intense
annd chillingly intertaining thriller
. tje directing isnt frist
- rate
,
anbd tyhe performances
- bates iin paticular
- contibute tothe makeing tihs a suitably nightmarish littel gme
. wonderfull sutff
.
