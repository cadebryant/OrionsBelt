anbd opn thte larg protective sheild at thge bakc ofthe thte boat
. htey are unaware ofthe exactlly waht isnt gonig tothe happn

. as thge flap falls
, hte battle beggins
. tehy are trapped liek rats infront a cage
anbd procede tothe be blown tothe pieces infact tjhe wake ofthe enemy gunfire
. amid tyhe chaos ofthe htis masicer
, stands a shooted thast
, at least forthe me
, hangs iin teh air liek tjhe girl inwhich tje littel red coat inaddition schindler ' s list
. a solider
, claerly missing an arm
, wanders aroud hte body
- strewn beach liuke a lost puppy
. we are nto invited tothe nkwo whta he isnt searching fo utnil he finds it himselv
. he bends over
, picks uv his arm
anbd starts tothe cary it
, propably nto bothering tothe ask hismelf
;
" waht nowe
?
" saveing private ryan isnt a masterfully composed film
. yhe direction isnt outloud ofthe htis world
, surelly tghe tipe ofthe command taht cant win spielberg anohter directing oscar
. tjhe cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, isnt aslo astounding
.
bu be forewarned
, htis isnt teh most voilent
annd graphic film i hvea ever seen
. hte articles ytou read
anbd tje warnings ytou see are justified
; saveing private ryan isnt visually as disturbing as a film cant git
. tghe question isnt
,
" doens tghe storey
adn its realism justify tyhe eccessive uise
?
" tje answer ffrom my point ofthe veiw isnt
" noone
"
. braveheart wass a truley gritty
,
adn
, oen owudl imagin
, realsitic battle film
. ryan isnt ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked inaddition skulls
, heads blown tothe bits
, arms
annd legs flying accros yhe battlefield
. many infact tghe theather sould nto bear tothe watch
.
annd it isnt a shame
, too
, beacuse htis isnt otherwise by far noe ofthe thte standouts thsi yearm
.
bu such graphic displays may turn awya even teh most loyal spielberg supporters
(
annd acdemy munbers
)
. saveing private ryan tkaes us ffrom tje attack at omaha beach onthe d
- day
, 1944
, thru inot thte film ' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew
annd sets off tothe fidn a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose threee brothers hvea aleady beeen killed onthe tje battlefield
. teh governement goes tothe gerat lengths tothe mkae sure thgat mrs
. ryan doesn ' t recieve a fouth letter ofthe condolences baout her sons
, thyat noone person shoud suffer such injustice
. miller ' s crew isnt nto inaddition favor ofthe thte mission
anbd tehy beign tothe harbor a secet hatred fo ryan
,
though tehy don ' t
yot nkwo him
. htey resent haveing tothe trudge outloud tothe bring hmeo noe solider who doesn ' t hvae any omre or less right tothe live thna any ofthe them
. thsi film manages tothe keep uv a repid pace
adn
,
though ther isnt a lot ofthe setted uv bewteen battles
, thte stroy continues full speed tothe tyhe end
. thge pacing
annd dramatism ofthe yhe extrememly well choreographed battle scenes isnt realyl inspite a leage ofthe it ' s pwn
. spielberg
,
though nto a student ofthe teh
" quick cutted
" skool ofthe filmmaking
, tkaes a stab at it here
,
anbd doesnt it better tahn michael bay or any ofthe his mtv counterparts sould ever hope tothe dont it
. bay shouldnt pay close attension
, tkae copious notes
. if ytou watn tothe jump cutted eveyr twpo seconds
, dont it tje way spielberg doesnt it inwhich ryan
. inspite hte end
, tjhe extremity ofthe hte gory violentce isnt nto justified by tjhe
" importance
" ofthe tje film
. schindler ' s list tought many peopel tyhe truth baout tyhe holocaust
. it oppened eyes
, sparked edbate
anbd studdy
.
though yhe battle scenes infact ryan hve never beeen portayed as realistically befor
, htey don ' t ammount tothe anytying as sereous or thougth provoking as tghe schindler ' s list
. overall
, htis isnt jstu hte truest depiction ofthe tjhe ood adage
,
" war isnt hell
.
"
bu braveheart
- dosage woudl haev ift tihs movei much omre appropriately
,
adn owudl haev made thge diference betwen me getting uv tyhe nerve tothe see it agian smoe day
adn realizing thast thsi isnt something i dout i sould indure agian
. masterful wokr marred onyl by eccessive gore
