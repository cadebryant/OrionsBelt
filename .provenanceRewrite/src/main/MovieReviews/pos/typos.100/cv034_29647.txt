. critique
: htere ' s a palce iin our world fo
" stupid comedies
"
. films wich don ' t pretend tothe tkae themslves seriously
, are based onthe idiotic premises
adn filled wtih dumb jokes
. htere ' s aslo a tiome fo them
annd many owudl argue thast thsi difficult preiod ofthe our histry
, might be an ideal cercomstance druing whic tothe
" relax
" by watching something so completly frivolous
. well
, if yuo ' re inspite teh mood fo smoe seriously mindless enteratinment
, ben stiller
annd his casted ofthe many haev assembled oney ofthe tyhe moreso originnal dumb comedies inaddition soem tiome
. ofthe course
, comedies as such are usualy vyre subjective
adn i coudl see how soem wiull see thsi film simpley as stupid
annd unfunny
, hwile others wiull grant them tje
" stupid
"
,
bu consdider it funny instade
. i personaly enjoied it forthe teh most part
, cracked uv loudly durig a cuple ofthe spicific sequences
adn loved tghe derek zoolander charactor
annd tyhe unrestrained whipping htey released apon tghe fasion inudstry
. snap
! it ws allso nice tothe see severeal rela
- life models witht small roles inthe teh movei
, nto tkaing themselfs too seriously
.

- over as tje massoose
. hi
- larious
!
bu whith all films ofthe thsi tipe
, ther isnt binded tothe be smoe sutff taht simpley doesn ' t wrok
. a fewd particulars whitch didn ' t strike my fancy included tjhe bulimia
annd
" orgy
" sequence wih christine taylor
, tje break
- dance fighting
,
annd i allso never git why tehy uise rela countrys inwhich plots liek htis
( why nto jsut
" mkae uv
" a ocuntry
, instade ofthe zeroing inthe onthe a ceratin peple
?
