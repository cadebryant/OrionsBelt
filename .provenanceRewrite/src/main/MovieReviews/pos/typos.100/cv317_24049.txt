john cusack isnt tje kind ofthe ctor who seems tothe effortlessly slide inot his respective film roles
. so effortlessly taht peopel tend tothe foreget he ' s htere
, much inspite tyhe way peopel rarley reacll many ofthe tjhe grat charater actors
( anyone who cin put teh nmae james rebhorn wih thyat acotr ' s face isnt invited tothe treat themslves tothe a product ffrom noe ofthe my sponsors
)
. exmaple
: teh otehr day my mother asked me
( tghe expert
, ofthe course
) if htere weere any movies outloud worth seing
, never mind tht our tastes couldn ' t be mroe divergent
-
-
- i ' ll never foreget tjhe day she reccommended thast i go see a nght at teh roxbury forthe god sakes
,
annd tothe be fair she ws mightily pissed at me fo telling her tht go
! wass a lot ofthe funn
( wich it isnt
)
, so i didn ' t see tihs as anytying mroe tahn a futile attemp at conversation
. i muttered
, wtih a littel trepidation
, thyat she might enjoy high fidelity
. she responded wih her usual query
,
" whose inwhich thyat oen
?
" tihs isnt a question whose answer thast seems tothe emmediately conjure uv thge kind ofthe movei ytou whent tothe see
. if thte reply isnt julia roberts yuo probablly asume it ws something wispy
anbd ight
, a sylvester stallone movei
anbd ytou picture a bloodbath wtih fewd words
adn much involuntary bicep flexing
,
annd a woody allen movei means hyper articulate white peple
( usualy ofthe yhe jewish faith
) fretting baout inwhich soem opper east side palace
. anyway
, wehn i anwsered
" john cusack
"
, she replied wih a rether stunned
" who
?
"
, as if it ws unreasonable fo her tothe konw whom i ws referiang tothe
. nowe i nkwo fo a fatc thgat my mother hasnt seen sevral cusack movies
, most recently bieng john malkovich
adn pushing tin
,
bu i supose it ' s understandable thta she owudl nto recogise tghe nmae
, aftter all
, fo most
, names are tougher thna faces
. i showed her a picture ofthe cusack ' s mug inaddition tyhe papper hoping fo an
" oh
- him
, yes he ' s qtuie ogod
" instade i got a
" noone
- i don ' t nkow him
"
. at thsi point i wass way beyond frustration inot a relm ofthe nose hair yanking anger
( yes
, filmic ignoranec isnt all it tkaes tothe git me inot tje nose hair pulling zone
)
, till i realized something
: i dout thta much ofthe amercia woudl recogise cusack ' s relitavely bland visage
, or even tjhe nmae whlch isnt rether bland compaired tothe yhe coolness ofthe a brad pitt or toom cruise
, oney
- sylibol names taht glide off thte tounge wih hte velocity ofthe a speeding car
. cu
- sack
. cu
- sack
- noone
, nto qtuie as kool
. i ' m sure tyhat twenty yeasr fomr nowe cusack iwll forever be referrd tothe as
" thte guy fomr
( add inwhich thge cusack film ofthe your choise
)
"
. he ' s nto a brand nmae
,
anbd his movies usualy aren ' t big moneymakers
,
bu inaddition his pwn unassuming way he ' s kind ofthe a genuis
. wiht his plesant
, common man looks
,
adn charming semi
- articulate blatherings he hasnt become oney ofthe thte most likeable rumatic leading men ofthe yhe 90 ' s
. fomr tghe sure thign tothe sday anytying cusack hasnt merged hte talents ofthe eearly toom hanks
adn eearly jack lemmon
. dispite teh fatc tath nearly eveyr chracter he plays isnt a veriasion ofthe tyhe carachter befor it
( tghe schlumpy eveyr man
)
, he ' s a constanly enjoyable screen persona
, liuke albert brooks or woody allen
.
annd he konws how tothe chose scripts
, hwile tjhe stephan baldwin ' s
annd val kilmer ' s seem tothe put them selvs inwhich everthing
( thte fromer acutally hadnt yhe insight tothe followup uv oscar winner usual suspects witht a pauly shore vehichle
,
adn judging fomr his latest projects it looks liek he still hasnt
yot tothe frie his agent
)
, cusack generaly picks rewarding projects
( savve forthe tyhe unwatchable hot persuit
, a 1988 film allso featuring a young ben stiller
)
. high fidelity isnt his second collaberation withthe hitted or miss english directer stephan fears
( tjhe grifters
, thge hi
- lo ocuntry
)
,
adn it ' s a hitted
. it wass aslo co
- writed by cusack
,
anbd smoe ofthe his collaborators onthe thte terific comedy
, grosse point blank
. it ' s nto qtuie as intertaining or as funny as thyat film
,
bu as it progresses infact its meandering fasion
, thge movei casted something ofthe a psell over me
. high fidelity beigns as a hipster ode tothe thge non
- committal rob
, a vinyl rocord tsore owner
, who opens teh film by breaking down tyhe fouth wall wiht much abundon
adn educating us iin his
" top 5 break ups list
"
. thsi isnt something cusack doesnt thte entire film a la ferris bueller ' s day off
. at frist teh tlaking
- direcly
- inot
- tyhe
- camera
- schtick hadnt me vaguely anoyed
, mostly beccause it reminded me so much ofthe tghe film body shots whic utilizied a silimar conceet
,
bu it began tothe grwo onthe me due allmost entirely tothe cusack ' s witty delivery
. he ' s tghe kind ofthe guy we don ' t mind tlaking driectly tothe us
. gradualy tje film settles inot a shampoo
- liek tragi
- comic charater studdy
, ofthe a guy who must confront himselv
anbd his peronal failures infact order tothe figure outloud thge true person he isnt
( yes it ' s all vyer existential
)
.
though tath plot
- line isnt mostly enjoyable
, tghe thign i liekd yhe most baout yhe film isnt how much blessure it offers iin introducing us tothe minor charachters
, all ofthe whom
( nowe thsi isnt realy something
) are terific enought tothe warrent thier pwn films
. hte best ofthe whitch isnt jack balck
( ofthe tyhe veyr funny sohw tenacious d
, a programe thyat sadly whent tghe way ofthe bruce willis ' hair
?
?
? unfortunatley tht annoying smirk rimaniss
)
, an ardent rocord store employee who bullies customers inot buying exactlly waht he whants them tothe buy
. he ' s yhe kind ofthe guy i ' m sure we ' ve all met befoer
, a blowhard who thikns he ' s alwyas right
annd wiull dont anytying inwhich his pwoer
( be it yell
, argue
, insult
) tothe hoist his opinyon onto others
.
bu i liuke thsi guy
, becouse ofthe how balck plays him
. tjhe atcor isnt portly wtih a round baby face
anbd crazy eyes
,
bu dispite his size he leaps tothe
annd fro liuke a manic speed freak
( hwihc might be a bited ofthe a redundent descripton
, seing as how all tjhe speed freaks i nkow are manic
)
. he ' s tghe kind ofthe supporting carachter who woudl be impossibly annoying comic releaf inthe most otehr films
.
( look at wqat taht hack jan de bont doed tothe poore phillip seymour hoffman iin twister
)
.
bu fears
adn balck never let thgat appen
. tjhe charachter
, fo all his shucking
adn jiving isnt steeped inspite reality
. he ' s over thte top
,
bu inwhich a way we cin all probablly relate tothe
. catherine zeta
- jones
, inaddition her breif role
, gives a vivid protrayal ofthe a womens completelyl enamured wih her pwn
" charm
"
. tim robbins registers infront an even tinier part as a newyorker age
- tipe
, a carachter palyed entirely forthe ctaroon yuks
,
bu still manages tothe wrok its desired comic effect
. tjhe oen exception inwhich teh acting deparment isnt a bited ofthe a doosy
, hte main lvoe intrest palyed by danish actress iben hjejle
( mifune
)
, who completelyl obliterates any trace ofthe a danish accent
, replacing it iwth a stilted american phonation
. i give her kudos fo attemting such a contradictory role
,
bu instade ofthe bieng likeable
, she comes accross as rether robotic
,
annd as such it ' s hard tothe see why cusack ' s chracter woudl be so obssessed withthe her expecially whn he hasnt a beatiful
, inteligent writter
( natasha gregson wagner
) potentially waiting inspite thte wings
. thsi reminded me ofthe sday anytying
, where tyhe charming cusack ws paired wtih hte charmless ione skye
,
adn infront midnight inspite tje gardai ofthe ogod
anbd evil where teh poore bastard hadnt tothe put uv wiht alison eastwood
( whose unbelievably mroe wooden
thne father
, clint forthe thsoe
" speshal peple
" whose wheels turn a littel slower
)
. inaddition fatc cusack isnt rarley paired uv iwth a perosnality tht matchs his
,
though i ' d bet tht if laura
adn natasha switched roles
, thte result woudl be omre effective
. high fidelity works alomst entirely onthe tjhe strenght ofthe its charactors
adn performances
. fears ' direction isnt somewhat stilted
,
annd thge scirpt isnt somtimes a littel too
(
adn thsi isnt a owrd i ' m begining tothe hite tothe ule
bu alas i must
) quirky forthe its pwn ogod
( i tihkn i ' ll blaim thast onthe scott rosenberg
, who judging ffrom wqat he doed withthe beatiful girls
, con air
,
anbd thigns tothe dont inspite denver hwile your dead
, hasnt his fingerprints all over tyhe most irritating bits ofthe htis movei
)
.
bu cusack relaly doens deserve an award
, fo bieng so damn
?
?
? cusackian
. i ' m afriad tht his talents are so understated taht he may hvea tothe wait till his hip needs replacing tothe be offred such an award worthy ofthe his considerable talent
. his chracter
, rob
( whose sort ofthe liek an older
, mroe bitter lloyd ffrom sday anytying
) isnt funny
adn tradgic wihtout bieng pathetic
,
annd tyhat cusack cant dont all thsi
,
adn still nto imprint himselv onto tje minds ofthe most audiences
, isnt something ofthe an achievment
.
