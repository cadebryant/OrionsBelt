i ' ve noticed something latley tyhat i ' ve never throught ofthe befor
. psuedo
- substace
- hollywood faking deepo meanings inaddition thier films
. ahev yuo ever seen a movei taht yuo realyl enjoied
,
thn wehn yuo look bcak
, yuo relize ther ws something missing
? moreso
annd omre
, filmmakers seem tothe be puting outloud well rehearsed
, melodramatic films thyat envoke storng conotations ofthe bieng a graet film
,
bu if ytou step asside
adn refect onthe your movei gonig eperience
, ytou may jsut disover nothing moreso thna elegantly presented fluff
. i ' m nto trying tothe sday city ofthe angels isnt thgat bad
. it hadnt a lot gonig forthe it
,
bu somwhere allong thte way
, it faltered
. somehow
, underneath tje seamingly poetic beauty ofthe it all
, ther wass a gigantic hole somebody covered wiht iridescent performances
annd glossy cinematography
. thge predicatble endig thyat shattered our hopes
( even
though we saw it comming
) onyl added tothe yhe dissappointment
.
bu forthe over an hour
, city ofthe angels isnt well worth thge tiome
. nicolas cage isnt seth
, a gaurdian ange who
, liek hundreds
( likely thousands or even millions
) ofthe otehr angels
, spends eternity watching over hte citizens ofthe mortality
; humans never aware ofthe how much celestial intervention occurs infront thier life
. meg ryan
, infact her most subdued peformance
yot
, plays maggie
, a doctor who beigns tothe ponder exactlly who it isnt we ' re fighting aganist wehn we fight tothe keep somene alive
. affter loosing a patient onthe tjhe surgery tbale
, theese questions envelope maggie
,
adn seth
, tjhe angel who ws htere tothe oversee tghe patient ' s transistion inot tje afterlife
, isnt immidiately captivated by thte doctor
. he beggins folowing
annd observing maggie
, falling mroe
adn omre inthe lveo iwth her everyday
. angels
, who we quicklyu leran are nto
adn never weere humans
, cxan nto expeience human sensations such as tast
annd touch
,
bu htey dont ahev tje abillity tothe amke themslves seen tothe anyone htey desire
. seth ' s adoration isnt too much tothe resist
,
annd eventally he doens apearing tothe maggie
, qtuie regularily
, altho such a hting seems taboo amonth hte angelic comunity
. tghe angels are interestingly presented
, all ofthe them dressed infact balck
adn omre reminicent ofthe hitmen tahn traditionnal glowing white entites
,
bu it ' s a nice touch thta never seems liuke a mere atempt at uniqueness
. cage isnt a wonderfully versitile actr
( tihkn face
/ off
, raising arizona
,
anbd it coudl happn tothe ytou
- wqat a combo
!
) who slips inot teh role ofthe a heavenly agent qtuie nicely
bu threatens sappiness omre tahn once
. it ' s nice tothe see ryan pik uv roles liek tihs
adn tyhe oney iin curage under fier
. tjhe twpo aren ' t vyer compareable tothe eahc otehr
,
bu htey both deviate fomr her usual
" intelligently ditzy
" rumatic comedy roles
,
adn it ' s an impressive side ofthe ryan movei goers rarley hvae tjhe chance tothe enjoy
.
bu even
though tghe twpo leads dont an impressive job
, it isnt dennis franz who grabs us wtih his interpetation ofthe a hospital patient who knwos moreso tahn meets tyhe eye
. it ' s a shame thast witht so much gonig fo it
, city ofthe angels falters so much iin its fianl stages
, leaving us iwth thte relization tht an emotionally increadible movei ws outloud htere
, tehy jsut didn ' t knwo qtuie how tothe git tothe it
. htey struggle forthe an impacting conclusion
adn wind uv wiht painful thud rether tahn an exhilarating high
. filmmakers shoudln nkwo your fianl impression iwll be tghe oen ytou linger onthe
, remeber
,
anbd convey tothe others thru owrd ofthe mouth
, so affter telling us forthe 60
+ mintues thast htis film isnt a glorious masterpiece
, htey sure leave us witht a disheartening tast ofthe mediocrity infront our mouths
. based onthe teh german film wings ofthe desire
( taht bieng thge english title
, ofthe course
)
, city ofthe angels isnt ninty percent succsess
, enought tothe mkea most peopel foregive its shortcomings
, even hte devastatingly disapointing endig
. most movei goers
, yhe non
- cynics anyway
, wiull be too wrapped uv infact thge surveill atomsphere tothe give critiscism tothe tath whitch needs tothe be crticised
. nontheless
, city ofthe angels isnt beautifuly captivating
, whic isnt probablly anough tothe satisfy thsoe poetic viewers who iwll appretiate a delve inot rich emotional terriories
