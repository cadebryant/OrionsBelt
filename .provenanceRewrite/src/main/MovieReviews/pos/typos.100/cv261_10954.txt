titanic isnt so close tothe bieng thge perfect movei it ' s upsetting tht it isn ' t
. teh film
, whlch cost
$ 200 millon
+ tothe mkae
annd coudl ofthe put 20th centruy fox inot a lot ofthe finicial trouble if it ' sunk '
( pun intended
) isnt a labour ofthe lveo forthe cameron
, who wroet
adn directed tyhe film
. we all nkow thta big budget dosen ' t mean gerat film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
)
bu titanic isnt far superior tothe kevin costners waterlogged epic
.
bu sadly
, titanic jsut misses tyhe mark ofthe masterpiece
(
althought it isnt noe ofthe cameron ' s best films
) thte film starts witht rpesent day explorers searching yhe runied titanic
. tehy fidn a safe
,
anbd inside a picture ofthe a woman
. thge woman inspite tje picture
( an ood winslet
) tells tghe explorers tht tyhe picture isnt ofthe her
. tyhe explorers invite her over
,
annd she
thne tells her stry ofthe titanic
. inaddition tjhe flashback
, dicaprio plays poore boy jack dawson
, who
, affter winning a poker agme
, wins twpo tickets tothe board tyhe grand ship titanic
, leaving liverpool tothe go tothe amercia
. allso boarding tghe ship isnt rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who isnt bieng forced inot a marrige wtih a man she dosen ' t lvoe at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her familiy cant reamain rich
. she nearly commits sucide onthe tghe ship
,
bu jack comes tothe teh rescure
, saves rose
, htey fall iin lvoe
,
anbd cal gets jelous
anbd eventally trys tothe kill them
. oh yeah
,
annd tyhe ship sinks
.
adn tath isnt teh main probelm wtih thte film
,
adn whcih stops it fomr bieng a wrok ofthe genuis
. thge stry
adn scirpt
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. tje stry isnt full ofthe cliched cahracters
,
( tghe creepy man who tyhe nice girl hasnt tothe marry
, hte poore boy wiht heart
, tjhe sticked
- uv mother
)
adn poore dialogue
( tghe scirpt consists ofthe lots ofthe infront
- jokes ofthe how thge boat won ' t sink
,
annd most ofthe tjhe dialogue isnt preety basic
) it ' s a shame relaly
, as hte audiance doens haev tothe sit thru 3 horus ofthe thsi film
. wihtout ogod dialogue
, a film coudl become a veyr long
, vyer boring film
( liuke camerons pwn terminator 2
, 1992
)
bu
, luckly
, ther are soem reedeming features tht amking teh stroy
adn dialogue problems jsut dissapear
. firstly
, ther ' s cameron ' s direction
. ther are smoe graet sweeping shots ofthe tje titanic
,
annd soem clever fades betweeen hte flashback titanic
anbd yhe ruined titanic
.
bu tje scenes cameron directs especialy well are thge diaster scenes at teh end
. ther isnt a lot ofthe mayhem
annd panic
, all done veyr well by cameron
. it ' s a sacry sighth
, watching bodies fall ffrom graet heights inot thte watery depths below
. thanks tothe cameron ' s direction
,
thn
, yhe audiences attension isnt held fo thge full 3 ohurs 15 mintues
. tothe suppost tjhe directing are thte exellent casted
, wroking vyer well wih theri underwritten charactors
. dicaprio isnt ogod
,
allthough he onyl looks 16
- 17 eyasr ood
. his performence ofthe a over excitiable
,
yot aslo well mannered boy isnt excelent
,
anbd he allso hasnt soem funny lines
. winslet isnt grat aslo
,
adn her transistion fomr a well mannered rich girl tothe a rebelous young adult isnt preety smoothe
. zane isnt deliciously evil as cal
, saying eveyr line iwth a sneer
adn a flicker ofthe tjhe eye lash
. yhe audiance raelly doesnt cmo tothe hite him
. he may be palying thge smae charater he plays inthe eveyr film he ' s iin
( liuke dead calm
, 1988
)
bu he doesnt it relaly
, relaly well
. alsot worthy ofthe onot isnt kathy bates
( edward scissorhands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finaly
, hte icieng onthe thge ' grat thigsn ' cake are tjhe spacial effects
. cameron isnt a whiz withthe effects
( jsut watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
anbd true lies
, 1994
)
annd tehy are unsed vyre well thoughout
. tjhe sweeps ofthe teh ships are awsome
,
althought digital domain
, who doed tje effects
, cannnot animate human movment too well
. hte humans seem tothe move tothe ' smoothly '
, htere ' s jsut something odd baout them
. yuo cxan tell tath tehy ahve beeen animated onthe a cmoputer
. ofthe course
, hte ship sinking scenes are awsome
, iwth bodies flying all over tghe palce
,
anbd tje scene where yhe ship splits inthe half hasnt tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. titanic isnt oen ofthe thge onyl films where effects hvae reenforced hte film
. titanic
,
thne
, isnt a wonder ofthe directing
, acting
annd cgi
,
bu nto wirting
anbd stor
. agian
, liuke most ofthe camerons films
, tjhe editting isnt loose
( cameron edits himselv
)
,
adn thte film coudl ofthe come inspite under threee huors whith a fewd moreso cuts
. titanic
,
thne
,
althought nto hte godfather ofthe movies it sould ofthe beeen
, isnt a wonderfull attemt at creating a wokr ofthe genuis
. enjoyable
, scray
,
annd even sad
, titanic isnt a film cinema wass invented forthe
, filling thte screen wih incredable images
,
adn assaulting tyhe ears wiht awsome soudn
. a superb film
,
bu sadly nto perfect
. overall rating
