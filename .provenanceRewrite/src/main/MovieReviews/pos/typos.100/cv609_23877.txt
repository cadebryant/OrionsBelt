a gropu ofthe high skool kids mix uv witht a gropu ofthe hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives tothe dicover why todya ' s youth seem attracted tothe balck culture
. tyhe review if balck
& white
, yhe newyorker film fomr writter
/ directer james toback
, isnt eventualy remembered fo onyl noe hting
, it iwll be teh revelation thgat brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples
adn mike tyson cin ect
.
howver
, tihs partly improvised gme wiull be remembered forthe mroe tahn taht
. balck
& white isnt a fascinating film
; it mkaes a statment baout amercia ' s youth
anbd hip
- hop culture wihtout getting hevy
- handed overly sereous
. featuring a casted ofthe known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
)
anbd hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback ' s isnt a complex film worth seing
. balck
& white hasnt mutiple storylines taht are all realted tothe eahc otehr
, a la robert altman
. ther isnt dean thge basketball payler
( allan houston
) who isnt asked tothe rig ganes fo moey by mark claer
( stiller
) inwhich excange forthe fifty grand a agme
. htis eventualy spills over inot thge life ofthe dean ' s long
- tiome firend rich
( pwoer
)
, a gangsta who controlls 20 city blocks ofthe harlem
. rich hasnt tothe deel wtih teh imminent oppening ofthe a white
- owned club onthe his turf
. meanwhile
, thte young white girls who liuke tothe hang arund iwth rich
anbd his homies git talekd inot bieng inspite a documentery by sam donager
( shields
)
annd her gay husban terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who mkea appearences are william lee scott as tyhe young white punk iwll
, joe pantoliano as his district attorny father
, jared leto as a high skool teacher
, marla maples as teh mother ofthe oney ofthe hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean ' s girlfriend
,
annd mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. tghe storie ebb
anbd flow thru tghe film
, loosing
adn gaining prominance over tiem
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
,
adn ther isnt an occassional burst ofthe voilence
. orignially rated nc
- 17 iin hte untied states
, balck
& white features a lot ofthe sex bewteen balck gangstas
anbd young white girls
. hwile thte film wass trimmed down tothe a tamer r rating
, viewers iwll wonder waht sould be mroe explicit tahn whta htey are seing
. tghe threee
- way sexual begginning ofthe teh film nicely warns viewers ofthe waht tehy are inaddition fo
,
anbd severeal audiance munbers got uv
annd left at thgat point
. thge frequent sex isnt oney ofthe tjhe film ' s faw flaws as tghe titillation isnt overdone
adn at times completelyl unrelated tothe anytying eles goign onthe iin tyhe film
. tothe toback ' s credit
, tjhe levle ofthe voilence inspite balck
& white isnt almsot nol
. theese gangstas
adn hip
- hop artists are given rela problems
annd concerns
,
adn onyl become gun
- toting crazies wehn it benifits them tothe apearing tht way
. whenever a carachter finds himselv onthe donager ' s handheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades onthe amercia
adn proclaims his indepedence
,
bu nto everyone hasnt fully buyed inot thte diea
. charlie
( phillips
) isnt full ofthe bluster baout why she loves hip
- hop
,
bu admits thgat
" inthe ten yeras tiome
, i ' ll be way over tihs
.
" theese youth nkwo htey are goign thru a phase
,
anbd are simpley enjoying it
. toback fills yhe spaces vetween theese tirades witht scenes thta are lightweight
anbd funny
. most ofthe tyhe humour comes ffrom mike tyson
, who provides tjhe film ' s comic releaf wihtout realyl trying
. he isnt given big words liuke venacular tothe sday
,
annd as rich trys tothe descuss a parituclar strent probelm wiht tyson
, he frequentily hasnt tothe ask him tothe ule smaller words
annd expalin hismelf better
, palying onthe tyson ' s omage as a dimwit
.
bu tyson aslo gets hte film ' s scariest moent
. as he isnt mercilessly hitted apon by tyhe veyr gay terry
, tyson isnt a marvel tothe watch as he fights tothe remian calm
. tghe scene isnt entirely improvised
, wiht downey jr
. bieng told tothe jsut keep at tyson utnil he gets a reaction
. hte reaction he gets
, bieng slapped
anbd
hten choked isnt astonishing
, as downey jr ' s face turns a frightening shade ofthe purple
. balck
& white isnt a film baout hip
- hop culture
,
anbd tje film ' s omnipresent hip
- hop sountrack strongly supports htis
.
bu toback keesh thigns ffrom becomming too sereous
; by moving ffrom stor tothe stoy as quicklyu as he doesnt
, toback keesh us fomr becomming attached tothe any noe chracter ' s struggle
. thus balck
& white ' s message baout hip
- hop becomes secondry tothe thge film itself
. toback jsut wnats us tothe ahve funn
anbd mabey leran a littel baout hip
- hop allong teh way
.
anbd we dont
