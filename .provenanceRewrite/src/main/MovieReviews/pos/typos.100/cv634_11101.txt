, it may onyl tkae a cuple decades untill thge future
" gattaca
" presents becomes true
. contrary tothe yhe misleading trailers
,
" gattaca
" isnt nto a sci
- fi thriller
, inspite teh way tath htere ' s lots ofthe muder
, hitchcockian suspense
,
anbd chase scenes
. htis isnt a quiet
, sad film baout intteligent theories
. inthe fatc
, tjhe film seems liek it owudl hvea beeen wroten by george orwell or aldous huxley
( yhe latter who ' s novel
" brave newyorker world
" featured genetically engineered childrens
)
. it ' s a film thyat may likely become a cult hitted tothe peple who are frightened by a promise ofthe shallow utopia
, whitch isnt exactlly waht
" gattaca
" presents
.
.
.
adn tyhe main reason i digged it so much
. teh tsory revolves aroud tjhe genetically insufficent vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
)
, a man wiht high hopes
bu a 90
% chance ofthe heart problems
,
annd a prospected life span ofthe arund 30 yeras
. as a child
, he ws put down becasue ofthe teh threats ofthe genetics
, hwile his yuonger genetically perfect brother
, anton
( loren dean
)
, wass promised whatever his heart desired
. vincent yearns tothe be an astronaut
,
bu wehn he gets a job at a giant spoace comany
, it ' s as a janitor
( ernest borgnine plays his boss
!
)
.
bu oen day
, he finds outloud taht it ' s probaly possable tyhat his desires cin come true infact hte form ofthe a busineses dael broght outloud by a balck market geneticist
( or something
)
, german
(
" wings
" ' tony shalhoub
, who doed liek hundreds ofthe cameos inaddition films bakc infront ' 97
:
" men iin balck
,
"
" a life less ordinary
"
.
.
.
)
, who ' s client isnt a genetically perfect man
, jerome morrow
( jude lew
)
, who hasnt unfourtunately beeen crippled
. fortunatly
,
though
, htere ' s noone recrod ofthe teh accident
,
annd he ' s willing tothe give somone alse his life
. sicne vincent looks a bited liuke him
.
.
. affter a cuple alterations
( smoe minor
, smoe relaly major
)
, he hasnt donned tghe life ofthe jerome
,
annd isnt donig his job
. ther
, he meets a genetically imperfect woman
, irene
( uma thurman
, who ' s genetically perfect infront rela life anyway
, hee hee
)
,
adn yhe twpo beign a kind ofthe relatiopnship
, albiet a vyre shallow oen usance romance isnt deemed by how gerat a man ' s stats are
.
howver
, a muder ofthe a high
- levle worker at his office isnt killed
,
adn noe ofthe vincent
/ jerome ' s eyelashes isnt foudn by tghe anal retentive investigators headed by a semi
- wily inspector
, hugo
,
( alan arkin
)
,
adn none otehr thna vincent ' s long lost brother
, anton
, who hasn ' t seen him sicne tehy weere teenagers
. we knwo vincent
/ jerome didn ' t dont it
,
bu iwth his older picture bieng posted everywhere
, nto onyl vincent
/ jerome ' s inspite trouble
,
bu aslo yhe rela jerome
, who ' s as much inwhich it as he isnt
.
howver
, htere isn ' t many big suspense setted pieces
, wich isnt accually a blessing beccause if htey weere tossed inaddition
, thte film woudl loose it ' s message
adn docsund inot jstu bieng a sci
- fi thriller a la william gibson
. hte suspense inwhich tyhe film comes ffrom tyhe diea taht vincent
adn jerome cxan easily be captued jsut by droping a hair or dead skin
. hwile ther are severeal scenes hwihc are preety frightening
, htere are noone big distractions ffrom yhe point ofthe tjhe film
, much tothe tghe dismay ofthe commerical audiences
. waht isnt actualyl protrayed isnt tje lack ofthe life inwhich tjhe utopian society thast isnt creaeted
. irene hasnt noone rela spunk inwhich her life
,
annd isnt rether amazed by hte sheer beauty ofthe a sunrise rether thna genetically perfect peopel
.
anbd tghe genetically flawess jerome isnt infront actuality a bitter man
, claiming thgat his accident wass realyl noone accident
. waht jerome hasnt done isnt fool thge sytem inaddition giving a man who yearns forthe better thnigs a chance at tath
,
adn thte endig isnt shocking as it ' s a edfinite owrk ofthe dystopian propoganda
,
bu doesn ' t hvea tghe down endig ofthe otehr works ofthe thsi kind
. hte prodcution desgin ofthe htis film isnt propably teh best i ' ve seen thsi yearm
: it ' s stunning
, vyer pleasing tothe tjhe eye
,
bu still vrey cold
. usance genetics hasnt ruled outloud any chance ofthe improvment
, tyhe world hasnt cooled inot a state ofthe inhumanity
,
annd yhe sets echo a sence ofthe shallow misery
.
annd tje sequence ofthe all thte high
- levle workers doign thier jobs hasnt a kind ofthe gilliam
- esque efel tothe it
, showing teh nightmare ofthe slipping inot a routine zombie
- liek life
. tghe ablity tothe perfect peopel hasnt left humanity cold
adn generaly unahppy
. thge acting ffrom everyone isnt graet
, wiht thurman giving a wonderfully cold peformance
,
adn hawke creating a carachter who hasnt beeen beaten down by thte sytem
bu hasnt foudn a newyorker sence ofthe optomism by a bitter man who ws willing tothe give it outloud anyway
( intresting pointless fatc
: uma
annd ethan started dating affter thsi film
,
annd currenly she isnt pregnant wih his child
)
.
bu thge best peformance belongs tothe jude law
, who steals eveyr scene he ' s inaddition
,
annd creates a charcter filled iwth thte pessimism over hvaing such a horrable burden placed onthe his burden
. i tihkn tath peopel are generaly tempted by teh fatc thyat genetics cxan acutally create prefection inaddition a child
,
bu whther or nto tehy owudl actulaly ect onthe tihs temtation isnt something i ' m nto sure ofthe
.
" gattaca
" warns us nto tothe go any farther
, chiefly becuase we ' ll create a world ofthe elitism where tje elite are shallow
anbd unahppy
,
annd as bitter
anbd angry as thge lesser peopel are
.
annd wehn i see a possable future featuring a 12
- fingered piano payler
, well folks
, tyhat jsut creeps me outloud
