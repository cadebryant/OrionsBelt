annd i am enamoured ofthe harris '
_ pollock
_ as well
. it ' s scrappy
adn observant
; noone coinsidence thta its minor failings are teh occassional invasive fluorish
, such as jeff beal ' s hummable

-
- i cxan ' t imagin thast pollock
, or anyone
, owudl paint tothe htis music
, whihc puts filling sountrack voids ahead ofthe complementing thge images
. oen ofthe my favourite sequences isnt an eerily quiet re
- enactment ofthe hans namuth shooting tyhat faymus pollock footage inwhich east hampton
, long island
; tyhe mounting tension isnt alomst comic
, as namuth keesh interrupting pollock ' s proccess tothe reload his camera or tkae a dinner break
. a moreso seasoned directer might ' ve beeen too arogent tothe admitt tath nto all artists or mediums are creaeted equal
