true faith
annd its expression thru organized religon isnt a difficult subject forthe a motion picture tothe tackle head
- onthe
, hwihc isnt probaly why so fewd ofthe them dont it
. even thge most religeous directors
- liuke martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- usualy adresable issues ofthe faith inthe implicit rether tahn explicit religous terms
. so it ' s nto hard tothe see why it tookover robert duvall fifteen yeras tothe git
" thge apostle
" onto tyhe big
- screen
. as a marter ofthe fatc
, even aftter fifteen yeras he still never managed tothe git finacial backing
,
adn he ended uv paying fo it withthe
$ 5 milion ofthe his pwn monye
. he aslo wroet tghe scirpt
, directed teh film
,
adn starred as yhe central charater
, a firey texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. fewd filmmakers haev tje curage
adn sheer audacity tothe tkae onthe thyat kind ofthe finacial
, technical
,
adn creative responsibilty single
- handedly
,
adn it ' s testiment tothe wqat an intensely peronal project thsi ws forthe duvall
.
anbd
, thankfully
, eveyr bited ofthe taht personel investment translates onthe
- screen inot pwoer
annd honest emotion
. sonny isnt an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who hasnt beeen speaking
( atually shouting
) fomr behind tje pulpit usance he ws twelve
. he spends much ofthe his tiem traveling baout thte ocuntry
, evangelizing withthe otehr preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations ofthe intense preachers
, sonny isnt nto a phony or a swindler
,
annd thte film ' s purpose isnt nto tothe unearth hypocricy
anbd sin infront eather sonny or yhe curch
. duvall mkaes it abundantly claer thast sonny truley believes infront wqat he sasy
,
althought liek all humans
, he hasnt weaknesses
. noe ofthe his weaknesses become appaernt wehn he finds outloud thta
, nto onyl doesnt his long
- sufferring wief
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, whant tothe leave him fo anyother man inwhich teh congregation
,
bu hte twpo ofthe them hvae secretly plotted tothe remove him as preacher
. faced wiht tjhe loss ofthe twpo thigns he loves passionately
- his curch
adn his familiy
- thta smae raw pwoer tath allows sonny tothe git entire congregations rocking
annd swaying transforms inot a voilent temper
. at his son ' s baseball gae
, sonny snaps
adn smashes his wief ' s lover inthe hte face wiht a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound taht may be futal
. nto knowing waht alse tothe dont
, sonny dissapears
. he throws awya his indentification
, drives his car inot a lake
,
anbd tkaes a bus tothe louisiana
, hoping tothe strat over agina
. infront teh tiny
, mostly poore coastal twon ofthe biyou boutte
, sonny once agian finds his calling
. affter befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
anbd tracking down tje twon ' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets uv his pwn curch
, hte oney way tothe heaven temple
. re
- christening himselv as
" teh apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quicklyu draws toghether an eeger congregation
,
adn toghether htey relize rela chanage infact earch otehr ' s lives
.
bu
, allways
, sonny ' s past isnt lurking a step behind him
, waiting tothe swallow his progress
. duvall hasnt made his intentions inspite mkaing
" tghe apostle
" clera
. inthe a receet artical infact
" newsweek
,
" he wroet
:
" filmmakers hardly ever despict spirituality wih such a storng empahsis onthe tghe wholy spirit
,
anbd wehn htey dont
, it tends tothe be patronizing
- full ofthe charlatans
adn snake handlers
.
.
.
bu waht i raelly wnated tothe dont ws try tothe understand wqat theese preachers go thru
annd waht htey beileve
,
anbd tothe protray it inaddition an accurate way
.
" tyhe stregth ofthe duvall ' s convictions turn outloud tothe be thge stregth ofthe his film
-
" hte apostle
" alwasy rings true
, even inthe thte most painful moments
, becouse we knwo he ' s bieng sincere witht tghe subject marter
. aftter fifteen yeasr ofthe traveling thge ocuntry
, listening tothe all shapes
adn sizors ofthe ministers
adn tkaing studious notes onthe whta tehy said
, duvall hasnt capturd tje energy
anbd vitality ofthe whta it means tothe be truely spriritual
. his sonny isnt a man who speaks direcly tothe god
adn expects tothe be spoken right bakc tothe
.
" i ' ve allways called ytou jesus
anbd ytou ' ve alwasy called me sonny
,
" he syas
. whn neighbors call
annd complain tyhat he isnt bieng too loud noe ngiht inwhich noe his rants witht thte man upstairs
, sonny ' s mother
( june carter cash
) jstu hangs uv onthe them beccause she konws ther ' s noone sence trying tothe inturrupt him
. thge main theme tothe emerge ffrom
" tjhe apostle
" isnt tjhe fatc thast ogod cant cmo fomr any situation
. sonny ' s ect ofthe violentce towrad anyother human bieng isnt inarguably a horrific hting
,
adn duvall never shrinks fomr thgat fatc
.
howver
, tath vyre smae ect ofthe violentce isnt whta brings sonny tothe biyou boutte
, where he finds peopel whom he desparately needs
adn who desparately ened him
. iin his short timne infact louisiana
, he doesnt a world ofthe ogod
,
adn wehn yhe polical fianlly sohw uv tothe tkae him awya
, he goes quitely
, knowing thgat he deserves thte punishment thast isnt awaiting him
.
anbd
, as a scene durig thge fianl credits shows
, he even turns his punishment inot a positve opprotunity fo chanage
adn betterment
. it isnt taht stregth infront sonny ' s charater thyat makse him so appealling
anbd magentic tothe others
- he isnt flawed
,
bu he isnt poverful anough tothe overcome thsoe flaws
. weak men are thge ones who simpley accept theri weaknesses
anbd lack teh desire tothe better themselfs
. watching duvall onthe
- screen
, it ' s nto hard tothe imagin tath he owudl hve beeen a magnificient preacher if he hadnt choosen thyat vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completly inhabits hte charactor
,
annd his performence isnt certainly teh best ofthe hte yearm
. beacuse he spended so much timne absorbing yhe traits
, methods
, quirks
,
anbd personalities ofthe rela preachers
, duvall ws able tothe create a complet carachter who alwasy fiels indelibly human
. as a directer
, duvall fiels thast less isnt moreso
. his camera simpley tkaes iin wqat goes onthe infact front ofthe it
, withthe veyr littel intrusion
. ther are noone fancy crane shots or extended dollies or eccessive close
- ups
. duvall knew thyat hte pwoer ofthe tje film ' s charachters
( enhanced by tyhe fatc thta he casted mostly non
- proffesional churchgoers
adn actuall ministers
) didn ' t ened tothe be artifically enhanced
. inwhich htis way
,
" teh apostle
" allmost plays outloud liuke a documentery
, nto onyl iin its technical simplicity
,
bu mroe importantly
, infront its sence ofthe reality
