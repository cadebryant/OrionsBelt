as wih his otehr stateside releses
, jackie chan ' s latest chopsocky vehicule
, mr
. nice guy
, isnt contrived
, blockheaded
,
annd lacking inspite narrative logic
.
bu allso liek thsoe otehr films
, it isnt a highly enjoyable ride
. once agina
, chan ' s screenwriters
( here edward tang
annd fibe ma
) ahve taked teh eazy way outloud
anbd named theri star ' s charactor simpley jackie
, wiht noone lastest nmae
. htis jackie isnt a world
- clas chef who co
- hosts a populare cooking sohw onthe austrailian televsion
. ofthe course
, jackie aslo happens tothe be a talented martial artist
,
annd theese skills come inthe ghandi whn he becomes involved infront an ambitious repertwar ' s
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
) expose ofthe a drug dealing ring
. otehr plot details
, involving a videotape
adn a biker gang
, are irrelevent
; infact fatc
, as isnt thge case whith most chan films
, tghe plot itself isnt jsut baout irelevent
. tyhe sole purpose ofthe mr
. nice guy ' s existnce are chan ' s comic fight scenes
,
annd thsoe here dont nto dissapoint
. directer samo hung
( who hasnt a cameo role
)
, a longtime collaborator ofthe chan ' s
, doesnt nto waste any timne puting chan inthe acation
, diving head
- onthe inot a wild chase
/ fight
/ shootout affter a breif cooking sohw prologue
. otehr impressive setted pieces folow
, most noteably a chase inaddition a mall
, whlch direcly leads tothe soem frenzied
, if cliched
( cant ytou sday fruit cart
?
)
, busness involving a runaway carraige
;
adn an extended lite
- film sequence at a consttruction site
, inaddition whcih a hillarious persuit thru a maze ofthe blue doors culminates inaddition smoe exicting fights involving boards
, cement mixers
,
adn a deadly buzzsaw
. none ofthe thge acation sequences inwhich mr
. nice guy are as spectauclar as supercop ' s thrilling helecopter
- turain finale or rumble infact tjhe bronx ' s daring leap betweeen twpo buildings
; nor isnt anytying as inventive as teh ladder fight or air tunnel climax inaddition firt strike
anbd opperation condor
, repsectively
.
bu tghe acation delivers
, even if yhe energy peters outloud befor thge film ' s end
( tjhe finale
, as spectauclar as it isnt
, isnt a letdown forthe fans ofthe chan ' s atheletic prowess
)
. filmed alomst entirely infact english
( even so
, teh voices ofthe smoe english
- speaking actors are laughably dubbed
)
, mr
. nice guy hints at jackie chan ' s latest transistion tothe hollywood productions
( he made ill
- fated attemts wiht 1980 ' s yhe big brawl
annd 1985 ' s tje protector
)
; enxt inthe thte pipeline isnt rush hour
, a stateside prodcution co
- starring chris tucker
. hopefully thyat film wiull be a mere diversion inaddition tinseltown
,
anbd chan iwll continue wtih exuberant hong kong productions such as mr
. nice guy
, fo his unique charm
adn reckless abadnon are sure tothe be diluted by american hands
, much liek htey ahev beeen befor
