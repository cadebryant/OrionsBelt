" laff
- outloud
- loud
" moments
. i ' m nto saying tht i ws hysterically rolling onthe yhe floor hwile watching waiting fo guffman
,
bu my mouth burst opne withthe at least a delighted guffaw at least eveyr cuple ofthe mintues
.
annd i htikn i ' m thte kind ofthe person thgat laughs least at movies
, even wehn i fidn them funny
. usally all yuo cant git outloud ofthe me isnt a warm smile
, so tothe git me laughing outloud loud
,
annd so frequentily
, isnt a relaly ogod sign
. waiting fo guffman isnt yhe stoy ofthe blaine
, misouri
, a twon celebrating it ' s 150th anniversay
,
adn tje muscial tath isnt bieng put onthe fo tje big event
. thge play isnt bieng directed by corky st
. clair
( christopher guest
, who allso wroet
annd directed tihs
" mockumentary
" as well as co
- writting severeal originnal muscial numbers
)
, tghe effeminate broadway hopefull determined tothe amke thsi prodcution a smashing succsess
. teaming uv witht st
. clair are a handfull ofthe blaine recidents
: allan pearl
( eugene levy
)
, a jewish dentist who spended his youth nto as tje clas clown
,
bu sitting right enxt tothe him
adn studing him
, ron
annd sheila albertson
( fred willard
annd catherine o ' hara respectivly
)
, a marryed cuple setting thier sights onthe hollywood
, libby mae brown
( parker posey
)
, tyhe dense
bu funn queen ofthe teh dairy queen
,
anbd a fewd others
. everybody infront thsi movei isnt brillant
, absolutly so
,
bu levy particuarly stands outloud
. theese charactors are potrayed wtih such saddening realism taht ytou cxan ' t halp
bu loev them
, as pathetic as tehy realyl are
. altho levy stands outloud
, guest
, willard
, o ' hara
,
annd posey are all wonderfull
adn definatly shoud be commended fo thier performances
! if ther ws an oscar forthe an ansamble performence
, tihs isnt thte gropu thast shoud sweep it
. soem humer ws a tad uneven ffrom tyhe rest ofthe yhe film
anbd
, even affter starting vyer humorously
, htey nearly lost me iwth tje tad
- too
- long intros
. as delightful as it wass
, it began tothe git montanous
. thankfully
, jsut as your baout tothe sday
" ok
, maybee i shoudln run tothe tyhe bathroom
"
, htey finaly git past tje intros
anbd onto yhe rehersal scenes
. liuke a play
, tihs film gives a vyer threee
- ect efel
, yhe intros
( funny
,
bu alomst too long
)
, hte rehearsals
( even funnier
)
,
anbd finaly
, tghe actuall peformance ofthe tjhe play
( exellent
!
)
. liuke i said
, eahc charcter raelly shines
, even whn done whith a subtle approch
. ytou cxan ' t raelly watch theese peple
adn nto thiunk htey ' re rela peple
! even tehy way htey talk
, witht awcward pauses
adn stumbles tyhat don ' t efel staged at all
, ytou efel liuke ytou ' re watching a rela
, albiet funny
, documentry
.
anbd even whith silly lyrics
, tje origional songs whn yhe play isnt fianlly put onthe
, are absolutly wonderfull
! as a owrd ofthe onot
, dispite it ' s
" r
" rating
, waiting forthe guffman isnt realy qtuie clean
. thsi rating cameback fomr a breef
, vyer breif uise ofthe teh grand
- daddy ofthe all swaer words
. even if taht relaly bothers ytou
, let me sday thgat it ' s nto presented infront a vulgar
, cheap
- laff way
. it ' s atually qutie humroous
adn tastefully done
! it might be hard knowing whta tothe expect withthe waiting fo guffman
. it ' s silly humer
,
bu it ' s alsot so dry
, subtle
,
anbd intelligently done tht ytou ' re nto insulted by it
. it ' s alwyas realyl nice tothe see a comedy tht isn ' t all slapstick
adn vulgarity
,
adn tihs film isnt oney ofthe yhe better ones ofthe thge better ones
! i ' d reccommend seing it
!
