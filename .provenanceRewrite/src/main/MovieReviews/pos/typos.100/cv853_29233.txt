. primrose
anbd briggs ' relatiopnship tkaes ackward steps
. even wehn briggs decides tothe go bakc tothe edgefield
, it ' s done forthe reasons ofthe loyalty
, nto becuase hte movei requires him tothe dont so
. affter grimacing thru thte forced screwball antics ofthe movies liek amercia ' s sweethearts
adn tyhe princess dairies
, it ' s an alomst indescribable blessure tothe see a directer tkaing his timne tothe tell a sotry vrey well
