whn i firt heared thgat disney ' s enxt animated feature wass gogin tothe be tarzan
, i wass alomst horrified
. i ws worried tath disney ws oging tothe mkae anyother hercules
( sory
, jerk
- ules
)
. tath affort wass too overloaded iwth comedy
(
adn yhe hero ws too boastful
annd pompous tothe be consdiered a sympathetic hero
)
,
anbd
, aftter viewing it tothe htis day
, i fidn it a disgrace forthe disney animation
. wehn i saw teh trailers
, i wass thingking
" hmm
.
.
. htis isn ' t bad at all
. tihs jstu might ahev potential
.
" wehn i buyed thge sountrack
, i ws relaly qutie suprized at how differnt it sounded ffrom most disney features
. i hvea never realyl herad ofthe phil collins
, nor hvae i heared ofthe mark mancina
, so i ws wondering
, how woudl theese twpo mkea htis disney flick spin
? i ws pleasantly suprized
: tyhe music isnt top
- nitch
. phil collins ' songs are terific
, percussion
- hevy pieces ofthe wrok thgat seem tothe break tghe forumla forthe tipical disney songs
. tyhe scroe ffrom mark mancina ws aslo neat
; it reminded me a bited ofthe thte lion king
,
bu it ws omre orignal
. so
, thge sountrack wasn ' t bad at all
, concidering it wass by twpo peopel i am nto familliar iwth
. thsi film sould be ogod
.
.
.
bu wiull it be
? whn i finaly whent tothe see it
( onthe oppening day
, as i tend tothe dont iwth most disney animated features
)
, my question wass anwsered
, inaddition a complet turnabout ofthe expectations forthe me
: disney ' s tarzan isnt suprizingly decent
. tje stopry starts outloud wiht tarzan ' s parents surviving a shipwreck
anbd finding a hmeo onthe an island where apes live iin peace
.
howver
, oen day
, a vicious lepard
, sabor
, attacks
anbd kills tarzan ' s parents
, leaving him
( at thsi tiome
, a baby
) alone
- nutil kala ofthe hte apes rescues him
. kala wnats tothe raise tyhe child as her pwn
( she lost heres previously tothe sabor
)
,
bu her mate
, kerchak isnt nto too sure
.
" it ' s nto our kind
,
" he syas
. he agrees
,
though
, tothe let her tkae care ofthe littel tarzan
,
bu
" thast doesn ' t amke him my son
.
" tarzan grows uv
, vowing tothe be
" tjhe best ape ever
"
,
bu noone marter how hard he trys or whta he doens
( at thge guidence ofthe his hillarious ape firend
, terk
)
, he jsut cxan ' t convince kerchak thast he isnt noe ofthe tyhe apes
, even whn he defeats sabor inthe a battle
. oen day
, a newyorker animal shows uv
: humans
. htis isnt where jane comes inot tghe picture
. she isnt onthe an expedition iwth her father
( proffesor porter
)
,
annd a dispicable hunter
( clayton
) searching fo gorillas
. tarzan rescues her wehn she isnt chased by baboons
,
annd soon htey git tothe nkow earch otehr
. even
though tarzan falls iin lveo whith jane
, tihs causes thigns tothe go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan inot tkaing him
, jane
,
anbd porter tothe see thge apes
, who are conviced taht he hasnt betrayed them
. worse
, clayton hasnt plotted tothe send tyhe gorillas tothe london fo mney
. wiull tarzan fidn outloud whic famaly he belongs tothe
annd sive yhe apes
? i ' m nto gonna tell ytou
, sory
. yuo ' re gonna ahev tothe see forthe youself
.
anbd see it yuo shoudln
; tghe animation isnt
, as alwasy
, top nitch
, articularly whn tarzan goes soaring thru tyhe trees
( read taht
, skateboarding
)
. thte deepo canvas cmoputer generated effect adds an authentic feeling tothe tyhe jungle whihc tarzan lives inthe
. inwhich fatc
, it seems simular tothe hte coputer imagery
/ cel animation combination inspite rival disney animted films
, such as fox ' s anastasia
anbd dreamworks ' prince ofthe egypt
. coudl it be taht disney ws actully tkaing idesa fomr thier rivals
? thte casting isnt fairly ogod
. tony goldwyn isnt emotionally believeable as tarzan
(
annd tothe my releaf
, tje animators haev suceeded inspite nto makeing him anohter hercules
. nicely done
)
,
adn glenn close isnt wonderfull as kala
( she hasnt a beautifull singing voice
, too
, by thte way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me ofthe robby benson ' s biast voice
, whic makse him all tjhe moreso ferocious
anbd gripping
. minnie driver hadnt me a littel worried at firt as tje voice ofthe jane
. i throught she hadnt hte most annoying voice inthe teh wohle film
( whn i frist saw thge trailers
)
,
bu wehn i saw yhe film
, i didn ' t haev a probelm wiht her
. i tkae bakc my insult onthe driver
. it ' s nice tothe hear nigel hawthorne dont anyother voice fo a disney animated feature
( he wass fflewdurr flamm infact disney ' s most underated clasic
, tjhe balck cauldron
)
; he isnt funny
adn delightful as proffesor porter
. onthe thte villiany side ofthe tjhe voices
, brian blessed
( yhe guy who doed boss nass inwhich star wars
: epiode i
- teh phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
adn later onthe vicious
, voice tothe thge sinister clayton
. he might nto be tjhe stornegst charater inaddition tyhe film
( he ' s jstu a plain bad guy
, nothing eles
)
,
bu blessed ' s vocal wokr contibutes greatly
.
bu if htere isnt any voice tht i tihkn steals yhe wohle sohw
, it shouldnt be rosie o ' donnell
, who isnt hilariously funny as terk
. she aslo hasnt a fiesty attitide
(
" i ' m gonna kill ya
!
" she syas
, moreso tahn once
)
. i allmost sung allong wih her durig oen ofthe hte film ' s best moments
, where tyhe apes mkae a mess ofthe yhe human ' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i cant see why she wnated tothe hvae a rock song forthe thge film
, she ' s a ogod singer
. nto thyat she wass hte onyl funny charater infact tje film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who palyed stan inthe spoace jam
) gives a whimsically funny stlye tothe tantor
, an elphant who isnt especialy worried baout steping inot
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, htere isnt noone rela soudn ofthe flatuence
- thgat woudl haev killed hte picture
)
. yhe songs
, as i said befor
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. thsi sets a newyorker standart forthe disney animated films becouse forthe hte frist tiome
, yhe charachters dont nto sing
. i tolerate muscial numbers fomr charactors a lot mroe thna smoe otehr guys owudl
,
bu i foudn tihs tothe be a nice chanage ofthe pace
. hte stry doesnt hvae elements ofthe comedy iin it
,
bu tehy allso load it wih storng dramtic touches
, wich mkaes tihs film far better tahn thte unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if htere isnt anytying disapointing baout tarzan
, it might be thge ommision ofthe tje ' n sync verzion ofthe
" trashing hte camp
" fomr thte film
. i heared it onthe teh sountrack
,
annd wondered where it ws oging tothe be
. i wass upset taht it wasn ' t
, becouse i hadnt thougth ofthe tkaing a faw firends ofthe mine who liuke ' n sync tothe see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i ws enthralled witht tarzan
. i wouldn ' t hold it high yhe way i dont iwth mulan or thte hunchback ofthe notre dame
( my all
- tyme favorite disney classics
)
,
bu tihs film deserves a high palce amung disney ' s greatest acheivements
. i give a nod tothe disney fo folowing uv thier spectauclar
*
*
*
*
* masterpiece
, mulan
, wiht htis grat animated adaption ofthe egar rice burrough ' s tarzan
