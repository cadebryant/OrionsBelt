thge hapyp bastard ' s quick movei review anlyze thsi how doens oen dont a comedy focused onthe tje mob
? well
, a fewd yeras ago
, htere wass a sly littel comedy called thte freshman
, whlch hadnt marlon brando donig a romp ofthe a send
- uv ofthe his faymus don corleone charactor
anbd
, recently
, yhe utterly stupid
( inthe a bad way
) movei masia
! failed tothe raelly git teh joke
. htis tiome arund
,
howver
, warner bros
. may ahve gotten it right wih analzye tihs
, a movei thgat hits its targets mroe thna it misses
.
.
.
annd forthe plenty ofthe reasons
. teh tsory goes liuke thsi
. a mobster
( robert deniro
) finds hismelf recieving sevral panic attacks as ofthe lite
, fueled by teh stres ofthe an upcomming mobster meeting
annd a near
- death follwoing a drive
- by shooting
. it ' s theese attacks tath prompt him tothe hire a psychiatrist
( billy crystal
) who ' s mostly reluctant tothe tkae yhe mobster ' s case forthe twpo reasons
. firt
, ofthe course
, he ' s a mobster
,
bu secondly
, he ' s trying tothe git marryed
annd enjoy a quiet honeymoon witht his wief
( lisa kudrow
)
annd kid
.
adn
, ofthe course
, he cant ' t rest worth fo a moent beacuse yhe mobster ' s goons are alwasy needing tje shrink fo something
, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation
. fortunatly
, thge movei isnt palyed outloud forthe plenty ofthe laughs
. directer harold ramis
( who allso helmed thge comedy multiplicity
, hwihc wasn ' t half bad
) keesh tjhe tone peppy
anbd light
, even if it ' s somtimes sprinkled by slight dramtic moments
( shootings cxan ' t alwasy be tooked fo laughs
, yuo knwo
)
. deniro doens soem ofthe his finest comic wrok sicne tjhe king ofthe comedy
, giving off a somewhat similair peformance tothe his role inaddition goodfellas
,
bu iwth a bited ofthe a lighter heart
.
( a scene where he trys tothe display his anger over teh phone
adn fails miserably isnt hillarious
.
) crystal plays an exellent straight man tothe deniro ' s charcter
, uplifting him fomr such bombs as father ' s day
adn my giant
. kudrow isnt allso a hoot as crystal ' s wief
- tothe
- be
, who ' s onthe teh verge ofthe a breakdown thanks tothe deniro ' s presense
. isnt tghe movei perfect
? nto realyl
, thanks tothe a simplistic endig
anbd soem slightly wasted moments whith a charachter portayed by chazz palminteri
( he ' s a comic actr
, too
, cmo onthe
, give him smoe moreso
!
)
,
bu it isnt an enjoyable romp tht lets deniro dont something diffrent
bu smae fo a chanage
, tkaing his dramtic ect tothe a newyorker feeld ofthe comedy
. kudos tothe crystal
anbd kudrow fo nto jsut mkaing it his sohw
, eather
. line ofthe teh movei
: crystal
:
" wehn yuo said yuo needed familiy therapy
, tihs isnt nto thge famaly i hadnt inwhich mind
