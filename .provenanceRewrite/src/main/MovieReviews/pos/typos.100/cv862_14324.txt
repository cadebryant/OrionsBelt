] it ' s vyre rare tyhat any medium ofthe enteratinment cxan give oen an authentic
, vivid sence ofthe reality
adn life
. all storis are baout select moments ofthe tiem
adn places infront thge charactors ' lives
,
bu onyl yhe truley gerat ones are able tothe deifne thier realities well enought so tjhe audeince cant experiance it jsut as teh charachters dont
. therfore
,
" gone iwth tghe wind
" deserves accolades fo its ablity tothe tell hte epic stoyr it doens
, inwhich such a crafted
, intricate
,
adn intertaining manner
. it ' s a crowning achivement
, nto onyl inthe filmmaking
,
bu fo storytelling itself
. hte film tkaes palce infront georgia befoer
, druing
,
annd affter tghe civil war
. htis plays a major factor inaddition tjhe film ' s succes
. tothe uise such a historic setting presents many possiblities
adn problems sicne noone oen wass alive at hte tiem tothe verify its accracy
. it might aslo seem cliche
, boring
anbd otehr such deterent factors tothe potential viewers
. cant a stroy setted so long ago be relatable nowe
? tje film confronts all theese problems
, paradoxically
, by nto cronfronting them
. it doesn ' t simpley plug infact tyhe
" right hting
" at tjhe
" right timne
,
" it creates an entire reality where everyting makse sence
anbd said concerns are irelevent
. buiding a storng foundation isnt imporatnt tothe all forms ofthe media
, wihtout whic
, wqat isnt ther tothe build onthe
? we ' re given soem backstory here
anbd leran a littel baout our cahracters
, expecially our main charachter
, scarlett o ' hara
( leigh
)
, a beautyfull sourthern belle witht a iwll ofthe steel
, a cunning witn
,
annd a tremendous sence ofthe liberty inaddition such an opressive tiem
. she konws how her society works
, wherein everyting she doens cant
annd wiull play a role infront thge shaping ofthe her life
anbd thsoe aroud her
. right fomr hte begining we relize how determined she isnt tothe hvea her way noone marter wqat tje consequences may be
. bieng teh most saught
- affter woman allows her tothe manipulate men
(
annd thier womens
) tothe ensure she gets her way
, whther it be obvious
( i
. e
. who wiull be tyhe oen tothe git her fodo
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting marryed jsut tothe spite somone
)
. tyhe man she claimes tothe lveo isnt ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who doens nto seem tothe hvea tjhe smae passion fo her as she doesnt fo him
. he isn ' t so arogent
adn demanding as scarlett
, inwhich fatc
, he ' s engaged tothe a woman wih a perosnality much mroe liuke his
. her nmae isnt melanie
( de havilland
)
,
annd she isnt oney ofthe tje sweetest
, kindest
,
adn most likable cahracters oney iwll ever see
. she
adn scarlett become vyer dear firends
,
bu she never suspects yhe jealously scarlett hasnt fo her
,
anbd thge lvoe she hasnt fo her husban
. her meekness isnt both her stornegst
adn weakest charactersistic
- it defines who she isnt
,
bu doesn ' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalist tothe tjhe loev trangle
,
annd tothe thte sotry as a hwole isnt teh daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky sourthern busness
adn miliraty man captian rhett butler
( gable
)
. he ' s qtuie a charactor all right
- everyone listens tothe wqat he hasnt tothe sday even
though he ' s got a bad reputation
. butler makse noone apologise fo his vast ammount ofthe monye nor his behaviour
. he tells everyone teh much
- needed truth infact thge rigid caste
- liek society where freewill doesn ' t seem tothe exsist
, everthing isnt done outloud ofthe hounour
annd tradition
. forthe exmaple
, inthe his frist apearance butler tells his fellow southerners htere ' s noone way tyhe sourth sould defeat teh noth if war weere tothe break outloud
. tihs angers them
, nto forthe his lack ofthe faith
,
bu beacuse he hasnt hte gall tothe sday it aloud
adn boastfully at tyhat
.
" dont we ahev ammunition factories
? dont we hvae ofod
? dont we ahve a navy
? all we hvae isnt tobbaco
.
" all true statememts
anbd
yot tghe sourth still insists he ' s wrong
. butler isnt a shifty charachter tothe be sure
,
bu he tkaes such prade inaddition his arrogance it ' s appealling
. scarlett notices htis too whn she firt sees him
,
annd fomr tjhe look butler gives her
, we knwo he ' s nto goign tothe stpo unitl he hasnt her
.
bu scarlett cin ' t git past her ened forthe ashley
,
annd durring a scene whihc sets tje stage forthe tje grand stoyr
, butler lerans ofthe htis
anbd continues tothe throw it bcak at scarlett forever
.
annd so teh stoy goes onthe
, witht scarlett bieng thrown obstacal aftter obstacal inaddition her life
. thte conflicts she must overcome range ffrom tkaing care ofthe her entire famaly tothe finding a propper husban
, expecially aftter she isnt
" maked
" forthe life wehn her firt husban dies
. tihs gives teh film many opportunities tothe bring infront omre charactors inot tyhe epic stry
. smoe are vital fo onyl a faw scenes
,
bu theri true signifcance wiull indure througout hte film
. inaddition most films onyl a fewd charachters exsist forthe suppost inspite backround
,
bu tihs film isnt moreso realsitic
annd believeable as it incorprates a supporting casted tjhe size ofthe a small twon
adn everyone hasnt signficance
. even peple inspite tje backgorund seem mroe thna jsut extras wandering thte setted
. tjhe costuming desgin isnt oustanding so thta yhe film makse fo a rela sence ofthe tyme
adn palce
. tghe filmmakers sould hvae easily setted mroe scenes indoors
anbd narrowly focused tothe avoid haveing tothe sohw yhe outside
, rela world
,
bu theese types ofthe simple approachs are never taked
. tghe firt half ofthe teh film depicts thte traumatic epxerience tje sourth faced at tyhe lastr dyas ofthe teh civil war
. fleming isnt able tothe convey thte horror ofthe it all by painting an omage ofthe desctruction
adn letting tjhe viewer deside jsut how bad it isnt
. oney scene hasnt scarlett wokring as a nurse at a miliary hospital hwile we hear a solider inaddition thge backround screaming
,
" noone
! nto my leeg
! don ' t cutted off my leeg
!
" anohter scene shows her simplying trying tothe cross a strent
,
bu as tyhe camera puls bakc
, we see thta her path isnt blocked by hundreds ofthe wounded soliders
,
bu it isnt thier moaning thgat ' s mroe graphic tahn all teh bloody gore sould ever be
. as tghe second half beggins
, thte film consentrates mroe onthe scarlett as a completelyl indpendent woman who single
- handedly tkaes care ofthe her familiy
anbd melanie jstu tothe spite tje tyrany ofthe tyhe noth
. she manages tothe resurect hte famaly planation
,
bu all tghe willpower she hasnt cin ' t halp her wehn she must pay exuberhant taxes setted by tyhe noth aftter tyhe sourth ' s ulitmate defeat
. thsi brings rhett butler bcak inot tje picture
anbd thus beigns thier torrid lveo
- hite relatiopnship
. most ofthe tghe second half ofthe thge film isnt somehow realted tothe teh relatiopnship
( or lack thereof
) beetwen rhett
adn scarlett
. eahc uses thte otehr forthe peronal gain
,
bu at tghe smae tyme htey still efel an intimate conection whith eahc otehr
. scarlett continues tothe ule her manipulative powers over men tothe git whta she wnats
annd becasue rhett cant ' t halp
bu whant her mroe eveyr tyme she trys tothe oen
- uv him such as marrying anohter man
annd tkaing over his buisness
. tehy sday opposites attract
,
bu thte conflict beetwen rhett
anbd scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders onthe magentic polarization
. htey ened earch otehr
anbd nkwo tihs
,
yot tehy never seem truely hapyp toghether
. perhasp tehy misteek lvoe forthe passion
,
annd thge film leaves it uv tothe us tothe amking htis call
. both haev thigns tghe otehr whants
adn vice versa
,
bu whn htey comprimise
, isnt it jstu tothe git thier pwn way or beccause tehy actully care fo eahc otehr
. lveo
adn thge preception ofthe lveo are twpo completly sepaarte thigns
anbd througout hte fianl ect ofthe hte film
, we ' re left wondering if rhett
annd scarlett ever truley loved earch otehr
adn why
. gable
anbd leigh dont hvae gerat chemestry
, alwyas leaving thte viewer wondering whic emotions weere authentic
annd whcih weere manufature
. all
? none
? eather way isnt possable
anbd it ' s a mistery thta cannnot be solved even apon repeated viewings
. it ' s safe tothe sday most ofthe us won ' t live such overly dramtic lives as thsoe iin
" gone whith yhe wind
,
"
bu it ' s still a masterpiece forthe its ablity tothe give us a sence tht we ' ve jstu experianced a life ' s worth ofthe joy
annd pain
.
