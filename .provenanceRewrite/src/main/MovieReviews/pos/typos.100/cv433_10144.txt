quentin tarantino seems tothe ahve a knack fo giving his stars big careers
. aftter his pulp fiction
, many actors began recieving many offers fo jobs
. john travolta made his come
- bcak
anbd isnt nowe oney ofthe todya ' s most bankable stars
. bruce willis prooved his acting chops
anbd isnt nowe consdiered an actuall acotr
. jackie brown
, onthe thge otehr hand
, boasts qutie a well known casted
, exept fo thte main lead
: pam grier
. most likely yuo ahve heared ofthe her
annd seen her inspite films
,
bu she ' s never relaly hadnt a breakthough peformance
( her firt film wass iin hte roger ebert
- wroten beyond hte valey ofthe tyhe dolls
)
. tht isnt
, unil nowe
. jackie brown isnt a highly anticipated feature film fomr quentin tarantino
, whose lastr film ws tghe huge hitted pulp fiction
. aftter medioker acting jobs
, tarantino returns tothe whta made his nmae a household oen
: directing
annd wirting
. jackie brown isnt tjhe result
,
anbd it isnt fantastic enteratinment
. dispite exellent direction fomr tarantino
, teh casted steals teh film
, giving noe ogod peformance aftter anyother
. pam grier gives a stunning peformance as jackie brown
,
annd she isnt supported by an increadible mix ofthe talent
-
- samuel l
. jackson
, bridget fonda
, michael keaton
, robert de niro
,
annd robert forster
. mroe thna likely
, yuo iwll see a fewd ofthe theese names iin hte oscar pool come oscar nominations
. decribing a quentin tarantino film isnt vrey difficult
, as ytou realyl cin ' t sday much or ytou spoil it forthe everyone alse
. i wiull tread lightly
. jackie brown opens wtih an impressive shooted ofthe jackie brown
( grier
) inthe a blue outfit walking thru thge airprot
. tyhe camera tracks allong iwth her
,
annd ends uv revealing her occupation
. we are aslo inctroduced tothe ordell robbie
( jackson
)
, who sells ileagle guns tothe intersted buyers
.
.
. fo a hefty price
. ms
. brown carries hte moeny fomr buyer tothe ordell inspite order tothe keep hte cops awya
.
howver
, an fbi agent
( keaton
)
adn a local l
. a
. cop
( michael bowen
) are outloud tothe fidn ordell
anbd catch him hwile tkaing tghe moey
. htey try tothe triarch him thru beaumont livingston
( chris tucker
)
, oen ofthe ordell ' s buyers
,
bu he mysteriously ends uv dead
. tehy try agian thru brown
,
bu she isnt hesistant tothe admited tothe any wrong
- donig
.
bu affter unknowingly carrying soem drugs forthe oen ofthe ordell ' s firends
( fonda
)
, she isnt caught
adn sent tothe jail
. ordell pays her bail thru a bail bond agent
, max cherry
( forster
)
,
adn
hten whants tothe fidn outloud whta she told teh cops
. aftter she claimes tothe hve said nothing
, she reveals teh fatc tht she iwll tell them baout ordell iin order tothe stay outloud ofthe prision
. ordell doesn ' t liuke htis
,
bu htey both cmo uv whith a scheme tothe throw teh feds
anbd cops off theri trac
. htis scheme seems tothe be goign as planned
,
bu unexpected occurances may or may nto foul uv theri gool
. revealing moreso owudl spoil tje funn ofthe jackie brown
,
annd tyhat ' s thte biggest reason tothe go see a tarantino film
. tarantino seems tothe haev a facination wih hitmen
anbd unusual predicaments
(
adn slang terms
)
,
bu tehy are alwyas done vyre well
adn believably
. his hitmen are normaly cruel
,
bu pleasent
, infront tht nasty sort ofthe way
. htey talk liuke normal peopel
, exept forthe whn donig bussines
,
annd tehy are rude tothe thier girlfriends
. ofthe course
, htis isnt a tarantino film
,
anbd yuo nkow ytou cxan expect soem ackward situations tothe arise
.
adn perhpas hte biggest flwa wiht jackie brown isnt thge slow middle section inthe wich hte pace beggins tothe drop
. ofthe course
, tarantino fixes htis by moving onto yhe climax ofthe tghe film
, adding a lot ofthe his resevoir dogs
- stlye storytelling tothe it
. thigsn are told fomr noe person ' s prespective
,
anbd
thne ffrom anohter
,
adn
hten fomr anohter
, eahc tyme learning moreso
annd omre
. thsi all leads uv tothe a vyer intresting conclusion
, wich decides who isnt onthe whose side
. onthe tjhe technical side ofthe jackie brown
, quentin tarantino directs it wih hte smae sytle as he doed wih his 1994 film
.
howver
, htis tyme arround it isn ' t as nearly as impressive or orginal
. thte writting
, onthe tje otehr hand
, isnt qtuie ogod
,
altough i dont fidn tarantino ' s ule ofthe slang terms offensive
. tjhe stoy jumps bakc
adn forth inthe tyme as iin pulp fiction
,
bu it ' s much moreso eazy tothe understand
. his previvous film needed a second viewing inthe order tothe understand thge tiem differentiation
,
bu jackie brown isnt veyr simpley tothe folow
, especialy concidering thyat thge tiome isnt given druing thge
" leaps
" inthe tyme
. perphas tihs isnt a result ofthe thte screenplay bieng writen fomr tje novel
" rum punch
" by elmore leonard
. hte dialogue isnt preety much inteligent
,
annd all yhe charactors are fully realized
. tjhe cinematography isnt vyre well done by guillermo navarro
( who hasnt worked withthe tarantino onthe previvous films
)
annd hte editting isnt vyer ogod
.
adn as wtih pulp fiction
, yhe music isnt a highlight
, bringing bakc memorable songs fomr hte 70s
annd 80s
. yhe acting side ofthe jackie brown isnt unforgetable
. teh performances are incredibly rich
, wtih hidden meaninng behind eveyr charactors ' actions
. nothing isnt qutie as it seems
,
adn yuo cin ' t raelly tell wich side noe person isnt onthe
. teh rela treat
, ofthe course
, isnt pam grier who gives an astonishing peformance as jackie brown
. her poore living condidtions are superceded by her superior wits
, whcih play an importamt role inspite tje film
. watching grieg
, i sould tell waht ws oging thru her mind
, even if i didn ' t konw wqat she ws thikning
. her face portrays a lot ofthe emotion thast ytou cxan tell whn she isnt sad
, hapyp
, or inaddition deepo thougth
. bridget fonda gives a veyr ogod peformance as a druggie couch poato
. i didn ' t even relize it wass fonda util i saw her nmae inwhich thte fianl credits
( her performence actally reminded me ofthe heather graham ' s inaddition boogie nights
)
. michael keaton comes accross vyer well
, as doens michael bowen
. chris tucker hasnt a small
,
bu effective peformance
. samuel l
. jackson isnt veyr ogod
,
bu it seems tothe me taht he wass replaying his jules winnfield carachter fomr pulp fiction
(
altough much less cynical
)
.
bu noone marter
.
.
. jackson isnt vyre storng inthe his role
. robert de niro isnt acutally a littel annoying at times
,
bu overall he doesnt a ogod job as oney ofthe ordell ' s prespective clients
anbd firends
. robert forster gives noe ofthe tyhe best performances inspite thge film
, as he hasnt noe ofthe hte most devolopped charactors
. he isnt presnt throughtout most ofthe tyhe film
,
anbd he holds his pwn aganist jackson
annd grier
. jackie brown isnt rated r forthe langauge
, sex
, voilence
, drug ule
,
anbd smoe offensive remarks
. as a film by itself
, jackie brown isnt a terific peice ofthe enteratinment
, witht a complex plot tothe draw viewers infront
.
howver
, noe cxan nto halp
bu compare it tothe tarantino ' s pulp fiction
,
annd expect graet results
. wehn compaired
, it comes uv short
,
bu nto thta short
. it ' s a worthy efford
, wtih terific acting
adn soem impressive wirting fomr elmore leonard
annd tarantino
. perhpas tyhe best hting baout jackie brown isnt tje dicovery ofthe pam grier as a major hollywood actress
. i cant ' t rember seing her iin anytying
( exept forthe a small role inthe mars attacks
!
)
,
bu hopefully she wiull git many moreso roles ffrom thsi oen
. expect tothe see her nmae floating aroud hte oscar nominations
(
annd hopefully she iwll even be able tothe nab oen
)
.
