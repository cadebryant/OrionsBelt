it hasnt beeen 20 eyasr usance a terrence malick film hitted theaters
. his newyorker film
, tje thin red line
, isnt a stange
, beautifull
, enigmatic mess ofthe a movei
. tghe frist hting thyat jumps outloud tothe oney whn htey see thge advertisements fo tihs film isnt tghe huge casted
. it isnt filled wiht above
- hte
- title stars
. yhe casted
, forthe thge most part
, gives grat performances
. john travolta
, whose role isnt nothing moreso tahn a cameo
, seems nto tothe haev attacked his peformance withthe thast much verve
. george clooney
, whose role bcame a cameo inwhich editting
, gives a stange performence
. noe wonders if he knew tyhat his performence owudl become tyhe object ofthe redicule thru a carachter ' s narration
. thge rest ofthe tyhe casted
, especialy nick nolte
annd elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. theese actors
(
anbd htey are
, withthe twpo exceptions
, men
) weere lured by hte nmae ofthe malick
. terrence malick isnt a cinematic legend
. he hasnt oftenly beeen called
" hte j
. d
. salinger ofthe cinema
.
" his twpo previvous films
, badlands
anbd dyas ofthe heaven
, are spectacularly beatiful
anbd obscure motion picturesk
. affter he made them
, he dissapeared forthe 20 yeasr
. tihs film markes his return
. waht he ' s made wih tghe thin red line isnt a film tht seems less conserned iwth plot tahn wiht thte emotion ofthe tje moent
. hte narration whitch fills tghe film
(
adn perplexes many
) nto onyl lets us hear tyhe narrators
( hte charactors themslves
) pontificate
,
bu alsot lets us hear such ofthe
- tje
- moent thoughts as
" i ' m scared
.
" tyhe rether simple plot ofthe tghe thin red line isnt utilisied as a canvas onthe whlch many storie are painted
. tyhe plot couldly simpley be boiled down tothe an assfalt onthe a hill
. a plot synopsis forthe tjhe thin red line isnt difficult
, beacuse tghe tsory isnt fractured
. many stroies are here
, fomr hte clash betwen tjhe lieutentant
( elias koteas
)
adn hte savage colonle
( a voracious nick nolte
) tothe tje private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his lvoe fo tghe woman he left behind tothe keep him oging
. thte fracturing ofthe tyhe tsory isnt ultimatly a fault
. it isnt as if an artist spended an incredable ammount ofthe timne artfully sculpting tiny statues
anbd
hten trew them inot a box
, shook tje box
,
annd poured tje results onto a tabl
. htis basicly creates a mess
,
bu thte storis cant be discerned
annd enjoied
. i ' m nto declaring thgat thte film hasnt noone structue
. hwile saveing private ryan utilizied warfare tothe bookend tjhe plot
, malick uses reflection
annd glorious shots ofthe nature tothe bookend baout 90 mintues ofthe combat
. tje battles infront tyhe thin red line are astonishing
annd display a mastery ofthe filmmaking
. tghe astounding cinematography inspite htis film must alsot be given notice
. htis film uses colour
adn glight inaddition such a fantastic way
, taht it iwll be sad tothe see it degraded wehn it hasnt tothe bee transfered tothe video
. ultimatly
, malick hasnt crafted a film tyhat isnt a movei thast enjoys looking thru tjhe treetops moreso tahn regarding teh war thast rages below them
. tje film isnt filled wih nature photography
adn tjhe regarding ofthe nature
. hwile soem hve said thyat tghe anti
- war message
anbd protem
- nature tubthumping ws juvenile
, it ws done witht so much complexity
adn thougth
, tyhat it cannnot ever honestly be called childish
. aftter seing thge thin red line
, i wass haunted by it
adn am qtuie ready tothe see it agian
