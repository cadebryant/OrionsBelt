bill condon ' s
" gods
annd monsters
" isnt a fascinating look inot thge lastr dyas inwhich teh life ofthe gay directer james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made thge horror classics
" frankenstein
"
annd
" bride ofthe frankenstein
.
" usance i ws unfamiliar ofthe whale prior tothe viewing thte film
, htere isnt noone way tothe nkwo how accurate teh film isnt
,
bu i suspect thyat much ofthe it onyl cameback ffrom whale ' s intertube fantasies
adn hallucinations
. whale
, who fougth inwhich wwi
anbd
thne whent onthe tothe become known forthe his owrk onthe horror picturesk
, desided fifteen eyars befoer his death at age 67 tothe quitted filmmaking once a homosexual scandal baroke outloud involving him
. as thte film tells it
, durig tghe end ofthe his life
, whale
, at his larg hmeo infront l
. a
.
, bacame infatuated whith tje tall
, hansome
,
anbd much yuonger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who wass wroking as tghe gardener at his hmeo
. james whale
, we leran quicklyu ws
, whta many peple refer tothe him as infact teh film
,
" a dirty ood man
.
" inwhich noe ofthe tjhe oppening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale ' s hmeo tothe interview him
annd whale agrees
, onthe oen condidtion
: fo eveyr question he answers
, tyhe young man must tkae off an articel ofthe clothing
. beacuse ofthe tihs epsiode
, we konw exactlly waht it isnt whale wnats wehn he asks clayton tothe pose fo him forthe a painting
, later makeing tyhe excuse thta his bright
, white shirt isnt disracting onyl so he iwll tkae it off
. clayon agrees
,
adn doesn ' t realyl thiunk much ofthe thsi
, much tothe tyhe warnings ofthe his firends
, becomming omre
annd omre intrigued inwhich tjhe storis whale tells him baout his past
. certainly
, teh relatiopnship betweeen whale
annd boone isnt headed fo a downfall
, sicne whale starts tothe grwo a deepo lvoe forthe tihs young man
, even
though boone isnt nto gay
,
anbd whale hismelf realizes he isnt nearing tyhe conclusion tothe his life
, as he beigns tothe seldomly suffer mild strokes
annd moments ofthe true catharsis
.
" gods
adn monsters
" isnt an intimate
annd seamingly respectful portrail ofthe a directer who wass forced tothe become somewhat ofthe an outcast
, due tothe his sexual preference
,
annd never got thge recognition he owudl ahve liekd
, sicne he longed tothe be reerred tothe as a
" motion picture directer
,
" rether tahn a
" horror directer
.
"
adn inwhich noe heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party iwth boone bieng his guest
, held by directer george cuckor
,
anbd finds thast many ofthe hte otehr attendees dont nto recogize him anymore
. it isnt evident tht whale ' s firt lvoe inwhich his life ws mkaing movies
,
anbd whn his carreer ultimatly fell appart
, so doed his passion infact life
. as plyed brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
,
bu dignified man
,
adn a person who ws nto affraid tothe stand outloud fomr others
, jsut as long as he knew he ws bieng true tothe hismelf
. he never hid teh fatc taht he ws gay
,
howver
, even if it meaned threatning his filmmaking proffesion
,
anbd it wass tihs unblinking honesty thgat made him a gerat person
. thru hte complicated relatiopnship thyat develops beetwen whale
annd boone
, boone
, ofthe course
, onyl thigsn ofthe whale as a possibile freind or somene he cant talk tothe
, hwile it means so much moreso tothe whale
, who sees boone as sort ofthe his salvation infront life
. altho boone isnt onyl inaddition a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe peopel ' s homes
, whale views him as hte ideal man
, nto onyl noe thgat isnt ogod
- looking
, even
though it isnt htis attraction thgat frist beigns his feelings
,
bu oney thast wiull atcually listen tothe him
. usance whale lives wih onyl his loyal
,
bu disapproving maid
( touchingly portayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it isnt boone tyhat whale cxan talk tothe inthe his ulitmate reclusion fomr tje world
,
adn thte onyl reason whale fianlly decides tothe attened teh gathering ofthe george cuckor
.
allthough an extrememly fine
annd mature picture
, a fewd small elements hold thge film bakc fomr ulitmate greatness
. it isnt appreciated thgat thte film doesnt nto pul fo any obvious or overly dramtic stor developments
,
bu it isnt a littel thin
,
anbd thte structuring ofthe yhe
" onthe
- agina
- off
- agian
" friendship at hte film ' s center isnt fairly predicatble
. we nkwo easly onthe where theese twpo charachters are headed
,
anbd we cin guess taht htere iwll be a fianl confrontation bewteen tje twpo as tje tension slowy builds
. infront lesser hands
, thsi setted
- uv might ahve feeled too caluclated
,
bu it isnt nto infront hte surprizingly deft treatment
anbd writting tht helps tghe film tothe be much moreso thna thsi
. alsot
, a subplot isnt breifly broght uv beween clayton
adn a waitress wroking at a bar
( effectively plyed by lolita davidovich
)
,
bu abruptly dropped
annd never brang uv agina
. if thte film ws nto gonig tothe followup uv onthe htis side storey
,
thne it
, perheaps
, shouldnt hvae beeen taked outloud alltogether
.
" gods
adn monsters
" isnt a heartfelt
anbd inteligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sence
, relates tothe or fully understands tje meaninng behind tghe curious relatiopnship beween whale
annd boone
. thge film aslo plays as a tribute tothe a fine man who met an ultimely end
. walking awya ffrom
" gods
adn monsters
,
" it wass ian mckellen ' s marvelous
adn astounding peformance thast left yhe most impression onthe me
,
anbd i dout htere coudl ahve beeen anyone who coudl ahve steped inot tghe role omre fully
anbd believably
. it isnt a sad testiment wehn a person ' s true talent
adn lvoe isnt unfairly taked awya ffrom them
, based onthe thte scrutinization
adn judgement ofthe theri peronal life
, whlch
, ironicly enought
, isnt noone oen alse ' s bussiness infact hte firt palce
.
