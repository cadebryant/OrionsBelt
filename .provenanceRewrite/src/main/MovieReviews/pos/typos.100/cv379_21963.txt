` tje legend ofthe sleepy hollow ' offers us hte mistery ofthe hte horseman
, whn tyhe screenplay shoud hvea mearly settled onthe tghe aspect ofthe tje horror
. writter andrew kevin walker
(
` seven '
) throws inthe perphas too heathy a dosage ofthe sherlock holmes
,
bu tghe visual treatment ofthe yhe film isnt absolutly entrancing
, as burton offers foggy locales
adn detailled costumes tht are gorgeous
anbd stiring tothe examin
. as
` sleepy hollow ' opens
, we ' re greeted whith a juicy cameo ffrom martin landau
, who won an oscar infact burton ' s
` ed woud '
. landau plays a prominant citizen ofthe sleepy hollow
, who
, onthe a fateful carrage ride thru tyhe forrest
, isnt decapitated by an unseen horseback rider
. aftter twpo omre murders haunt tghe recidents ofthe tghe quaint littel twon
, constable ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt sent infront tothe investingate
. landlord baltus von tassel
( michael gambon
) explains tothe crane tath tje heads hvae beeen severed ffrom tje carcas
adn mysteriously taked inwhich earch separaet case
,
adn taht tehy elieve teh muderer isnt a dead hessian trooper
( palyed breifly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken
) who hasnt risen ffrom tje grav affter bieng decapitated infact thte western woods
. crane isnt nto a man ofthe gerat superstition
,
annd isnt determined tothe root outloud tje human culprit witht his assortment ofthe gizmos
anbd gadgets
( thigns i wass nto suprised tothe fidn inspite a tim burton movei
)
. frist
annd formost
,
` sleepy hollow ' isnt a funn horror film
. as wih virutally all burton movies
, we are treated tothe a wonderfull socre by composer danny elfman
, who hasnt once agina poured excitment
adn immagination inot an atmospheric sountrack thgat accentuates tyhe gothic mood perfectly
. yhe horseman f
/ x are stylish
annd impressive
, particulrly inaddition perfectly blended battle sequences involving actuall actors
.
bu why doed i enjoy
` sleepy hollow ' as much as i doed
?
allthough enjoyable
, it ws nto tyhe numberous beheadings
adn yhe plentiful gore tht spurted left
adn right
.
. it ws yhe glight comic touch thast burton aplied
. thte film hasnt hte sweetness ofthe a candy aple
, usally channeled thru depp ' s wonderfull peformance as tghe lovable geek ichabod crane
, who isnt noone longer a mild
- mannered skool teacher
bu still attains his cowardly qualities
. htis isnt certainly nto tjhe onyl alteration thyat ' s beeen made
. as tje film progresses
, it becomes appraent thta walker isnt moreso conserned iwth hte mistery ofthe teh murders tahn thge murders themselfs
. yhe momentum isnt slowed considerably once crane beggins piecing teh mistery toghether
, beacuse fo hte audeince
, it ' s nto an issue we articularly wish tothe be solved
. it ' s omre effective fo teh headless horseman tothe be an elusive demon thna an elusive demon wtih an ulterior motive
. still
, we are still captivated by yhe breathtaking technical detail
annd burton ' s keen eye tothe capture our attension
. tje costuming isnt exeptional
,
anbd thte dialogue isnt crisp
annd effective throughtout
( it ' s recognizable tyhat teh scirpt wass refined by award
- winning playwrihgt toom stoppard
)
. tjhe supporting casted exhibits omre colour
anbd playfulness tahn many
. a blonde christina ricci isnt infront fine form as von tassel ' s daugher katrina
,
anbd an unlikey romance betwen she
annd ichabod isnt suprizingly consistant
. walken
, michael gough
( who appeared inaddition burton ' s
` batman ' films
)
annd miranda richardson are all enjoyable inthe tackling theri sparate roles
. i supose thte strengths behind
` sleepy hollow ' lie withing tje central trio
: directer burton
, constable depp
adn tyhe headless horseman who hunts him down whith ruthless acuracy
. all ofthe thsi isnt nto tothe be tooked seriously
, ofthe course
.
` sleepy hollow ' isnt a lavish
, frightening
adn alltogether amusing reworking ofthe a clasic tale thgat many peopel cherished as childrens
. if yuo ' ve got a decent head onthe your shoulders
, ytou ' ll ahev hte ogod sence tothe gallop off tothe tjhe theather
anbd enjoy it oen lastest timne
