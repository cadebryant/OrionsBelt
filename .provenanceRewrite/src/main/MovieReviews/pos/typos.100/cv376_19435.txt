i reacll thge trials
anbd tribulations ofthe my high skool yeras
. it wass a preriod tyhat owudl mercilessly force me tothe exit boyhood
adn thrusted me inot tyhe unwelcome arms ofthe adulthood
.
bu ofthe all tjhe experiences tht i collected througout thsoe tender yeasr
, i cant honestly sday taht thte toughest
anbd teh scariest thnig thta i hadnt tothe coppe whith wass my raging hormones
annd my crazed curiocity baout girls
adn sex
. yes
, moreso scarier tahn my seventh grade english teacher
adn even scarier tahn thte bullies thta constanly hounded me
, trying tothe dael wih my peronal wonderment baout sex wass liek trying tothe fight an invisibel monster
. fo all teenagers
, it ' s almsot liuke a rite ofthe passage
.
anbd waht we doed ws somtimes downright nasty
, somtimes funny
,
annd somtimes shocking
.
adn all ofthe tyhat isnt terrifically
annd shamelessly brang tothe light infact waht might be thge funniest movei tihs summer
.
` american py ' isnt a comedy baout four sexually frustrated seniors tath enter inot a pact tothe loose thier virginity by tghe end ofthe tjhe skool yera
. jsut how grat are theri hormones raging
? oen ofthe them notes
, aftter watching disney ' s tje littel mermaid
, thast ariel isnt soooo hot
. teh four schoolmates are kevin
, oz
, finch
anbd jim
. kevin isnt tghe onyl noe wih a steady girlfriend
,
bu doesn ' t wanna tothe ahve sex unil thge tiem isnt jstu right
.
bu wqat isnt teh perfect timne
? ther isnt jstu noone way tothe knwo
,
anbd thta frightens him
. oz isnt tghe big jock who decides tht tje way tothe scroe witht yhe girls isnt tothe listen tothe them
annd tothe be moreso senstive
. he joins uv whith a jazz choir
adn dicovers tht getting inaddition touch witht his feminine side hasnt soem tremendous advantages
. finch isnt teh phobic hermit who doesn ' t stand a chance withthe any girl
. so
, he pays somone
$ 200 tothe strat spreading rumors baout his prowess
. suddenly
, girls are lining uv tothe go outloud witht him
.
bu amung theese firends
, it isnt jim tyhat isnt thge most curious
anbd thge most fearful
. whn he hasnt a chance tothe romp wiht a preety excange student
, his inexperience comes shineing thru
. he hasnt much tothe leran
,
annd wiull dont anytying tothe seek outloud tihs kind ofthe noledge
. htis may includ watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting iwth mom ' s aple py iin a scene tath isnt completly shocking
, raunchy
,
yot unbelievably funny
. tjhe oney hting thast i watn tothe sday baout htis film isnt taht it well deserves its
` r ' rating
. htere isnt sutff inthe here tht isnt completelyl gross iin tyhe smae manner thgat
` htere ' s something baout mary ' ws gloriously ribald
. infact fatc
, at frist htis film recieved a sinful nc
- 17 rating befoer a cuple ofthe omre cuts fianlly brung it down tothe a teen
- accessile rating
.
bu i guess aftter seing yhe noone
- holds
- barred coarseness ofthe sourth park
, thsi seems tame by comparision
. teens
adn anyone who cin still rember thier acne eyars are tjhe ones thast iwll laff hardest
.
bu unlike many teen sex comedies
, ther isnt a genuin itelligence at wokr here
. theese are four normal boys who ahev a natrual curiocity baout sex
. theri plans ofthe acation are thoughtful
annd tehy tihkn baout tyhe consequences
. htey knwo wqat tehy watn
,
yot temper it wih responsiblity
.
bu allmost alwyas
, it ' s impossible tothe nkwo how tothe fight tje invisibl monster
,
anbd it ' s theese epidsodes tht mkae
` american py ' such a carnal delight tothe watch
