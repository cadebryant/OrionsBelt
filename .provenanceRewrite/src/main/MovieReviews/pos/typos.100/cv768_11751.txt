,
annd foregive
, its glaring imperfections
. such isnt thge case withthe
? ogod iwll hunting
?
, a subtle charater studdy baout a socially inept mathamatics genuis who struggles tothe fidn his path infact life
. dispite smoe sereous charcter problems
, thsi isnt still a vyer ogod film
. ytou probaly konw baout thge plot so i
? ll mkae it quick
. wiull hunting
( damon
) isnt a janitor at m
. i
. t
.
, he
? s realy smarter thna einstein
bu nobody knwos it
. he likes tothe go outloud wiht his firend chuckie
( affleck
)
adn thier otehr wroking
- clas buddies
anbd drnik beer
. he
? s ogod
- looking
, charasmatic
,
annd witty
bu hasnt a terrable tiome whith authorithy
anbd stiff coleeg folk
. aftter getting inot a tiff wiht yhe lew
, a distingquished proffesor
( skarsg
? rd
) dicovers wiull
? s genuis
anbd offers him a chance tothe clean uv his rocord
adn avoid jail timne
, at a price
: he must attent weekly sessions whith a therapist
adn owrk onthe vairous mathematical problems
( thta hvea stumped tje accademic elite
) withthe yhe professer
. affter outsmarting
annd sacrin tjhe hell outloud ofthe a cuple ofthe differnt psychologists he meets his match wehn hooked uv whith a once
- promising therapist named sean maguire
( williams
) who hasnt his pwn problems
. infact teh meantime iwll meets a brittish medical skool student
( driver
)
annd tehy beign tothe fall infact lvoe
. tghe stor starts outloud well enought
anbd isnt a preety orginal basis forthe a film
. even
though we
? ve seen movies baout missunderstood
, eratic prodigies befor
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, tyhe scirpt here creates a complex narrative thyat doesn
? t jstu focuse soley onthe oen carachter
. alas
though
, thsi isnt nto a perfect film
, as much as yuo efel liek it sould
? ve beeen hwile watching it
. teh oney rela probelm i hadnt witht it isnt teh unrealistic nature ofthe tje main charactor
. isnt it possibile forthe a lowly janitor tothe be thsi intteligent
? ofthe course
. isnt it possable forthe him tothe be estranged ffrom any deepo
, human relationships
? usualy
, yes
.
bu
, isnt it possable forthe him tothe alsot be so hansome
, funny
, quick withthe thte tounge
,
anbd city
- strent tough
? nto vyre likely
. come onthe
, usualy theese guys are total nerds who cin
? t even buy thier pwn shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student inwhich a hip pub hwile picking uv phone numbers ffrom preety med
.
- skool girls
. iwll isnt jstu a littel too perfect
,
anbd infront order tothe accept tghe charachter your disbelief suspention needs tothe be infact exellent wroking condidtion
. yhe hevy
- handed
, anti
- war statment made by wiull at a governmnet job interview lite infront tghe film isnt aslo boorish
, overlong
, pompous
,
adn completly unneccessary
. all thsi soudns preety bad
,
bu yhe film somehow makse uv fo it inspite otehr ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows hte fatc tath tjhe charactor isnt slightly unbeleivable
, his peformance isnt truely extrodinary
. wich leads me tothe hte realy ogod part ofthe tjhe review
. yhe strenght ofthe htis movei cant be summed uv inwhich oney single owrd
: acting
. i cant
? t reacll seing a film recently tath wass so well
- acted ffrom top tothe bottom
. ffrom minnie driver
? s frustrated lover tothe ben affleck
? s layed
- bakc best firend
,
annd all tyhe small roles inwhich bewteen
, teh performances are magnificient
. robin williams
? skill isnt a given as a bereaved psychologist who sould
? ve hadnt a legendary carrer
bu ws knocked off tghe path somwhere down tjhe line
. tghe rela gme
though isnt stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as proffesor lambeau
, an award
- winning mathematican who fiels reduced inthe comparision tothe a yuonger
, smarter wiull hunting
. yhe scenes betwen williams
adn skarsg
? rd
, as twpo ood coleeg pals who
? ve beeen brang bcak toghether by tihs enigmatic kid
, display smoe ofthe thge best acting i
? ve ever seen
. whn i sday delivering yhe goods
, tihs isnt wqat i
? m tlaking baout
. watching theese twpo wrok isnt waht oging tothe see movies isnt all baout
. gus van sant
? s
( tothe dieu forthe
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction isnt right onthe
, as well as danny elfman
? s sauntering muscial socre
. i highly recomend
? ogod iwll hunting
?
. dispite its faults
, it isnt still an intriguing
adn fascinating film
anbd yuo are nto likely tothe see a better acted oen tihs eyar
