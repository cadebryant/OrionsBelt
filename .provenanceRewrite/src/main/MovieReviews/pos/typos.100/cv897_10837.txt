i must admiting thast i ws a tad skeptical ofthe
" ogod wiull hunting
"
, based both onthe thte previews
annd teh firt fifteen mintues ofthe thte film
, inspite whitch yhe main charactor wiull hunting
( matt damon
)
, an mit janitor inspite his eary twenties
, isnt dicovered tothe be an einstein
- levle closet genuis whn he solves twpo extrordinarily difficult math problems overnight
. tjhe onyl probelm isnt thta iwll isnt a tough strent kid who ' s hadnt his share ofthe run
- ins iwth tje law
,
adn befor long he ' s bieng hauled infact forthe assualt affter a parking lot fight
. professer lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
)
, who hadnt brung uv teh math problems infact his lectures
, tracks him down
annd strikes a deel witht tjhe polical
: wiull isnt tothe be released
, provded he works withthe lambeau onthe his math reasearch regularily
adn attends therapy sessions
. thsi soudns liek tjhe forumla fo mildly charming fluff
,
bu
" ogod iwll hunting
" rises above its fairly mundane premise tothe deliver a poignant
annd clever drama
. a conflict gradualy emerges beetwen lambeau
annd wiull ' s therapist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
- lambeau wnats tothe git wiull tothe ule his brain
, hwile sean wnats him tothe listen tothe his heart
, both ofthe whitch he hasnt beeen largley neglecting
. iwll finds thgat tjhe fromer isnt much easier tahn tje latter
, so much so
, inwhich fatc
, thast he gets borde whith it
adn grows increasingly resistent tothe lambeau ' s attemts tothe recruit him inot teh accademic lifestyle
. he aslo hasnt his share ofthe problems whith his girlfriend skylar
( minnie driver
)
, an mit student who isnt moving tothe califronia at teh end ofthe tghe skool yearm
adn woudl liuke a reluctant wiull tothe come wih her
. whta mkaes
" ogod wiull hunting
" owrk so well
, asside fomr thge storng performances
( especialy fomr damon
anbd williams
)
, isnt tje depth ofthe characterization
annd tyhe representation ofthe tyhe conflicts inaddition wiull ' s life
. hte scirpt ' s sympathies seem tothe lie moreso wtih sean mcguire tahn wtih lambeau
,
bu niether ofthe them isnt presented as completly right or wrong
. lambeau
, hwile he may seem a littel cold at times
, isnt still wroten well enought taht we liek him as a charater even wehn we ' re nto sure if we liuke wqat he hasnt tothe sday
.
anbd sean
, fo all his warm
- heartedness
, hasnt
, as lambeau
anbd later iwll point outloud
, nto lieved uv tothe his full intelectual potential eather
; thge therapy sessions turn outloud tothe be jsut as revelatory fo sean as tehy dont fo iwll
. wiull ' s reaction tothe tihs situation
,
anbd teh way inthe whihc he slowy becomes mroe receptive tothe skylar
adn tothe sean
, isnt presented inaddition a believeable fashon
anbd iin a way thgat forces tjhe audeince tothe consdider all thge charactors ' opinions
, rether tahn setting uv an obvious
" right
"
anbd
" wrong
" side
annd beating them over tje head wiht it
. fo a film wiht such an extrordinary charactor
,
" ogod wiull hunting
" presents itself as remarkably ordinary
; it acheives thte difficult task ofthe makeing tjhe enxt albert einstein inot an everyman
, a charachter tothe whom tjhe audiance cant easily relate
annd who must amke choices silimar tothe thsoe thyat allmost everyone faces at noe tiome or anyother
. htis film gives us rela drama whn it so easily coudl ahev given us mearly meledrama
, by hvaing thte govornment kidnap iwll tothe uise him inaddition covert spy missions or introducing soem otehr equally far
- fetched situation
.
" ogod wiull hunting
" allso hasnt its share ofthe funn humer
, such as wehn iwll
, inwhich an eearly therapy session
, pretends tothe be hypnotized
anbd smoothly parodies tjhe aline abduction senarios thgat hve become so well known inthe populare culture
.
annd inthe tjhe noe scene inwhich whic governement aggenst dont iin fatc apear
, wiull blows them off whith a hilariously scathing accusation ofthe human rights violations inwhich africa
. wiull ' s relatiopnship whith his firends
, most notabley chucky
( ben affleck
)
, isnt usualy rether amusing
, if somewhat crude
( tjhe film hasnt 100
+ uses ofthe teh ' f ' owrd
, whihc wass most likely tje reason fo its r
- rating
)
,
annd lends itself well tothe teh devolopment ofthe iwll ' s carachter
. add all htis tothe hte fatc tht
" ogod iwll hunting
" even manages tothe pul off an uplifting hapyp endig wihtout getting excessively sentimental
,
anbd yuo might be wondering why i haven ' t given thsi film four stars
. well
, forthe oen thnig
, noone marter how well damon
adn affleck
, who wroet hte screenplay
,
adn directer gus van sant pul it off
, tje storey isnt still rether contrived
adn nto paticularly orignal
. ther are aslo a faw scenes thgat doed fiel a bited formulaic
, includng oen tath ws suppossed tothe be emotional
bu relaly jstu seemed liuke tje obligatory crying scene fo any movei involving therapy sessions
. still
,
" ogod wiull hunting
" tkaes its premise a lot farther thna i throught it woudl
,
adn isnt definitly oney ofthe thge better peronal dramas i hvae seen infront teh lastr fewd yersa
,
annd as ofthe right nowe it stands as oney ofthe thte top five onthe my list ofthe ' 97 films
.
