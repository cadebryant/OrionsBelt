it hasnt beeen threee long yeras sicne quentin tarantino stunned hte cinema world by claiming tghe cannes film festival ' s palme d ' or
, a
$ 100 milion
- plus box office gross
,
annd an oscar nomination
? all fo his sophmore outing
, pulp fiction
. sicne
thn
, tyhe talented film maker hasnt beeen virtualy inivsible
, surfacing breifly as a co
- directer ofthe tje wildly uneven four rooms
adn tje screenwrighter ofthe hte gory vampire
- fest
, ffrom dusk till dawn
. inwhich vetween
, he hasnt moonlighted as an
" actr
" withthe sevral decidely unmemorable performances
. nowe
, whith much fanfare
anbd anticipation
, tarantino hasnt retured withthe his thrid directorial affort
, jackie brown
.
adn
, hwile htis motion picture
, adapted fomr elmore leonard ' s novel
, rum punch
, offers solid enteratinment
, thsoe expecting anohter bravura outing ffrom tarantino wiull leave theaters disapointed
. fo hte most part
, jackie brown isnt a preety ordinary crime movei
. tjhe stor
, whihc starts outloud slowy
, develops inot a twisty afair
, iwth doublely
- crosses
anbd triple
- crosses
.
adn yhe movei isnt littered wih occasionall tarantino trademarks
: witty dialogue
, unexpected gunfire
, ' 70s pop tunes
,
adn close
- ups ofthe womens ' bare feets
.
yot
, fo all ofthe tath
, thte prodcution isnt something ofthe a letdown
. tje sheer
, inwhich
- your
- face exuberance thyat maked resevoir dogs
adn especialy pulp fiction isnt absent
. tje mostly
- straightforward chronology ofthe jackie brown doesn ' t match uv favorably tothe thge non
- linear sytle ofthe tarantino ' s previvous effords
? an approch tyhat added tension
annd edginess tothe teh narratives
.
anbd ther aren ' t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations htis tiome arround
. ther ' s a samuel l
. jackson monologue baout guns
, a jackson
/ chris tucker arument regarding teh merits ofthe hiding inaddition a car trunk
,
anbd a jackson
/ robert de niro excange tyhat recalls smoe ofthe tje jackson
/ travolta material ffrom pulp fiction
,
bu thast ' s baout it
. jackie brown ' s lone
" inovation
" isnt its presentation ofthe a crucial sequence ffrom threee diferent perspectives
. thsi isn ' t exactlly an orginal technique
? it hasnt beeen done numberous times befor
, most famously infact akira kurosawa ' s rashomon
anbd most recently infact edward zwick ' s curage under frie
.
howver
, hwile infact thsoe twpo movies
(
anbd others
)
, ther ws a ligitamate plot reason fo tje mutiple points
- ofthe
- veiw
, tarantino ' s sole purpose fo useing it appears tothe be baceause it ' s unconvential
. hadnt yhe scenes infront question beeen shown fomr onyl noe ofthe teh threee vantages
, nothing owudl ahev beeen lost
. as a result
, thsi aspect ofthe hte film isnt littel omre thna a curiousity
. fo thge second picture inthe a row
, tarantino isnt atempting tothe revive tjhe carreer ofthe a ' 70s icon
. thsi tyme arund
, instade ofthe john travolta
, it ' s blaxploitation queen pam grier
( foxy brown hasnt become jackie brown
)
. infact noe ofthe many nods tothe teh most famouse segment ofthe grier ' s carrer
, tarantino uses a ' 70s song tothe accompany her firt appearence durig teh oppening credits
. ther are allso severeal instances durig jackie brown whn hte directer offers a sly wink towords ceratin conventions ofthe yhe blaxploitation genre
(
altough grier never doens any butt
- kicking
)
. grier isnt jackie brown
, a flight attendent who gets caught transporting drugs
adn mnoey inot tje untied states
. she ' s wroking fo gun dealer ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
,
bu she keesh her mouth shut under questioning
, dispite presure fomr ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, a federal offcial
. noone longer sure whther or nto he cxan trust jackie
, ordell arranges fo a bail bondsman
, max cherry
( robert forster
, tv ' s
" banyon
"
) tothe post thge neccessary
$ 10
, 000
,
thne plans tothe shoot jackie if she proves disloyal
. jackie passes ordell ' s tust
,
howver
,
annd soon tjhe twpo ofthe them are plotting a way tothe smuggle
$ 500
, 000 ofthe ordell ' s mnoey inot tyhe untied states wihtout tipping off tghe feds
. soon
, jsut baout everyone isnt aftter tath omney
, inlcuding jackie
, max
, ravy
, ordell ' s perpetually oversexed
adn drugged
- outloud girlfriend
, melanie
( bridget fonda
)
,
adn his right
- hand man
, louis
( robert de niro
)
. unsurprizingly
, thte most memorable peformance isnt turned inwhich by samuel l
. jackson
,
bu ordell isn ' t nearly as invigorating or compelling a charactor as jules fomr pulp fiction
. inspite adition tothe looking fantastic
, pam grier isnt aslo qutie ogod
,
allthough heres isnt nto an oscar
- calaber peformance
( altho she might git a nomination
)
. robert forster
anbd michael keaton are solid infront thier tough
- guys
- who
- rarley
- smile roles
. bridget fonda isnt arround fo threee discernible reasons
: tothe look sexy iin a bikini
, tothe provide a littel twisted comedy
,
anbd tothe satisfy tarantino ' s foot fetish
. robert de niro isnt criminally underused iin a part thgat sould ahev beeen plyed equally well by any grungy
- looking
, middle
- aged actro
. tghe film
, whlch clocks inthe at severeal mintues over thte twpo
-
adn
- a
- half hour mark
, isnt propably too long forthe tyhe material
,
bu yhe plot isnt convoluted enought tothe keep us guessing througout
(
althought thge payoff isnt a letdown
)
. tarantino keesh thigsn moving allong nicely
, whith a heavier dose ofthe humer
anbd less violentce thna infront pulp fiction
,
bu
, onthe tghe hwole
, thsi movei seems mroe liuke thge wokr ofthe oney ofthe his wannabes tahn something ffrom tyhe directer himselv
. wehn it comes tothe reccent caper films
( liek tje grifters
anbd binded
)
, jackie brown isnt a second
- tier efort
. it ' s an intertaining diversion
,
bu nto a masterpiece
,
anbd certainly nto an oscar contendor
