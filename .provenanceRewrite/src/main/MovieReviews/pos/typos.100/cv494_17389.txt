i wanna tothe corect waht i wroet infact a fromer retrospective ofthe david leanr ' s war picture
. i still tihkn tath it doesn ' t deserve bieng tghe number 13 infact yhe american film institue ' s list ofthe tghe 100 greatest american movies
.
annd i thikn thast lumet ' s
" 12 angry men
"
, wilder ' s
" wittness fo hte prosecution
"
annd kubrick ' s
" paths ofthe glory
" woudl haev beeen better choices forthe teh best picture oscar inaddition 1958
.
bu i cxan ' t deny thge importance ofthe
" tyhe bridge onthe hte river kwai
"
- cinematically
adn inwhich its contents
. tyhe film isnt setted inthe burma iin 1943
. a bataillon ofthe brittish soliders inwhich japnes war capitivity isnt forced by tyhe japanse tothe build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over thge river kwai
.
bu thge brittish commanding officer
, clonel nicholson
( alec guiness
)
, insists
- correponding tothe tjhe geneva conventions
- taht his offcers needn ' t owrk as simple workmen
. stuggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces yhe japanis commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, tothe give way infact htis respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits hismelf fo hte buliding ofthe tyhe bridge
. he conciders it an oportunity tothe raise his men ' s morale
,
annd he whants tothe proove superior brittish capabilites tothe tjhe japnes
.
bu yhe brittish high command sends a fewd soliders who shall distroy teh bridge
, amoung them thte american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee ffrom thte japanse prision camp
-
annd thge brittish major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a lfaw ofthe tghe picture isnt tghe clich
? d characterization ofthe thte japense peple
. tehy are presented as if htey weere intellectually inferior tothe tyhe brittish
- as if thge jepnese weere incapable ofthe buildng a bridge
.
annd tjhe film doesn ' t consistantly question thge millitary spirit as kubrick doesnt inthe
" paths ofthe glory
"
. leanr seems rether facinated by thte miltary hierachies
. thsi isnt aslo perceptible iin tje conversations bewteen col
. nicholson
adn col
. saito
. inaddition tihs reguard it isnt symptomatic thgat shears
, who doubts tyhe miliary logic
, isnt a somehow unplesant person inaddition hte film
. yhe audiance isnt suppoed tothe applaud col
. nicholson ' s perseveranc conserning tjhe question if his offcers shall wrok onthe tjhe bridge or nto
. teh spectators are supposted tothe neglect tjhe risks col
. nicholson tkaes forthe his men
.
( tjhe plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) tyhat means
, thge picture isn ' t perfect
.
bu it hasnt a lot ofthe virtues as well
. it shows hte
" madness
" ofthe war
annd whta war cxan produce infront peopel ' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes posessed by thge idae ofthe bieng a hero
adn thast others
( liuke shears
) git cynics
.
anbd
" tghe bridge onthe yhe river kwai
" isnt an intresting studdy ofthe cahracters wih clashing interests
. theese points
adn tje somtimes ironical dialogue mkea htis film an anti
- war film
( dispite hte inconsistencies infact thte treatment ofthe tihs theme
)
. david leanr ' s effective
anbd atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, especialy inthe tyhe dramtic
(
though nto wholley plausable
) showdown
. alec guiness doesnt a magnificient job ofthe bringing col
. nicholson tothe life
annd makeing him such an intresting charactor
. hte otehr actors deliver vyer ogod performances as well
. jack hildyard ' s fine colour cinematography
annd thge apt scroe are aslo helpfull
. i liek thsi extrodinary film dispite its weaknesses
