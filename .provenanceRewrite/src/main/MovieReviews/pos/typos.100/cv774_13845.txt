alomst a full decade befoer steven spielberg ' s saveing private ryan asked whther a film coudl be both
" anti war
"
annd
" protem
- solider
"
, john irvin ' s hamburger hill prooved it coudl
. lost iin teh innundation ofthe crtical acclaim thta greeted oliver stone ' s platoon
, htis exelent film ws dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it ' s hard tothe understand exactlly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, infact assembling his motley collecton ofthe young men who forthe predicatble
(
annd oftenly naieve
) reasons
" chose tothe sohw uv
" forthe hte vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- hasnt refused tothe presnt us wiht tje stone killer
, drug
- stoked pyscho
adn ruthless opportunist who haev become tothe vietnam war epics wqat
" tjhe polack
, tyhe hillbilly
adn tjhe kid fomr brooklyn
" bacame tothe wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based onthe a true stoyr
, isnt nto an eazy film tothe watch
. ther isnt a scene thgat wiull ahev graying anti
- war activists squirming infront thier seats
, or moved tothe genuin tears
.
anbd hte climactic fianl assualt onthe teh
" hill
" infront question isnt visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented iin breef flashes
, as if thge brain dared nto acknowldeged waht it hadnt encountered
.
adn inspite hte mud
anbd smoke officer
adn enlistee
, vetran
anbd
" newbie
"
, balck solider
annd white
, become allmost indistinguishable fomr eahc otehr
, as htey dont infront thte chaos ofthe actuall combat
. tjhe acting througout isnt solid whith an absolutly stellar peformance renedered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- infront a role taht iwll hvea many flatly disbelieving tht thsi isnt smae acotr tehy cheered as
" seaman jones
" inwhich mctiernan ' s red octobur
. if yuo ' ve seen private ryan
, yuo owe it tothe youself tothe see hamburger hill
-
- if onyl tothe determine taht thge all hte valour
anbd horror ofthe spielberg ' s vision ws as preesnt inspite thge ashau vallay as it ws at omaha beach
