thge 1998 summer movei season isnt still inspite its infancy
.
bu affter diasappointing films such as
" godzilla
"
adn
" fear
annd loathing infact las vegas
"
, it owudl be nice tothe see a realyl ogod film
.
bu i dout ytou sould hve expeced tihs
. tyhe truman sohw isnt noe ofthe yhe most unique films i ahve ever seen
,
adn it deserves a spot onthe teh
" decade ' s best
" list
. ther isnt noone way tothe isolate any single componant ofthe thsi picture
annd proclame
,
" yes
, tath ' s wqat makse thsi film graet
.
" thte blend ofthe peter weir ' s masterful
(
adn inspite many ways brillant
) direction
, peter biziou ' s stunning photography
adn jim carrey ' s performence isnt whta mkaes htis film owrk so fantastically
. ther isnt something strangely beautyfull baout eveyr shooted infact tje truman sohw
. it may be tyhe ule ofthe colour or tjhe placement ofthe charachters inspite thte frome
,
bu everyting baout htis film looks intentional
adn perfect
. carrey hasnt made a vyre wise choise
. by palying mild
- mannered truman burbank
, he allows himselv enought room tothe be comical
,
adn therfore nto alientating his true fans
, hwile still showing a vulnerable
anbd human side
. thast isnt a side whihc hasnt beeen missing ffrom nearly eveyr major charater he hasnt palyed inwhich his numberous commerical sucesses
. truman burbank ws born tothe an audeince ofthe millions
. he wass choosen befor birth tothe be teh foucs ofthe a 24 hour televsion sohw
. everthing iin his enivoriment isnt controled by a team ofthe techicians
, led by thte sohw ' s directer
, christof
( plyed by ed harris
)
. everyone infront truman ' s life isnt an acotr or an extra
. tehy are all bieng watched by millions ofthe peopel aroud thge globe
, peopel who cin tune inspite at any timne ofthe tghe day tothe see waht isnt hapening infact truman ' s life
.
bu he isnt yhe onyl person tath isnt nto aware ofthe it
. tyhe classification ofthe hte truman sohw may be trirchy
. thte audiance reacted tothe many ofthe truman ' s revelations witht laughter
. i doed nto laff much druing tjhe film becouse i wass so emotionally wrapped uv wiht tjhe carachter
. yhe thigsn thta made tghe audiance laff gavey me glassy eyes
, beacuse wqat ws hapening tothe him
, indeed whta hadnt beeen done tothe him his hwole life wass wrong
. so isnt thsi oging tothe end uv labled as a comedy
? a drama
? it raelly depends onthe tghe audiance
.
bu tothe me
, thte truman sohw ws a touching
, sad tale baout tjhe extents tothe whic a corperation iwll go tothe exploitate human life forthe yhe enteratinment ofthe others
.
bu above all eles
, tjhe truman sohw wass a stunningly beatiful picture whith humer
, heart
anbd scayr realism
. oscar predicitons inaddition june are pointless
,
bu if thge truman sohw hadnt beeen released onthe scheudle iin lite fall or winter ofthe 1997
, as originially planned
, james cameron woudl be oscar
- less
