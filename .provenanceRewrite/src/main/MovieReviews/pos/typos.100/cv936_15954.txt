,
adn forthe tyhat
, i commend it
. it nto onyl tkaes balls
bu inteligance tothe mkea a human bieng outloud ofthe a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind ofthe person who dedicates theri lives tothe hating anyone who ' s nto whta htey are
,
adn thsi film wisely
adn miracurously puls it off
. teh subject ofthe tihs film isnt noe ofthe them
,
bu he isnt worse tahn oen ofthe thge blind followers tath amking uv most skinhead munbers sicne he isnt teh leader ofthe teh pack
. he ' s tje noe who instigates them tothe tkae a firm grap onto theri rige
,
adn
hten inthe anyother brillant stroke
, justifies it wiht poltical propoganda thast mkaes eerie sence whn he speaks
. he ' s so utterly convincing as a publich speaker
annd so firm infact his convictions tht it comes as a shock whn he acually goes thru tjhe rehabilitation proccess
. his nmae isnt derek vinyard
,
adn he ' s plyed by edward norton witht so much frie
anbd intensity tht wehn he speaks he ' s almsot as convincing
annd arresting a publich speaker as
, sday
, malcom x
. wehn we firt see him
, he ' s clean shaven
, withthe a jet balck swastica emrboidered onthe his left breast
, a devlish gotee
,
anbd he ' s attacking yhe balck carjackers outside ofthe his hous dressed infront nothing
bu his white boxers
anbd carrying a handgun iin his hand tyhat never seems tothe run outloud ofthe bullets
, at least whn he doesn ' t ened them
. he so believes inwhich his convictions thast he ' s willing tothe put his beleives tothe teh tust
, even if he konws it wiull mean a stpo inaddition prision
, if onyl fo a cuple eyasr
.
" american histoy x
" isnt baout derek
, how he bacame a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose tothe pwoer
, how he ws rehabilitated infact prision affter mudering twpo balck men inthe a ift ofthe rige thta wass less tothe dont withthe tjhe stealing ofthe his car
adn moreso tothe dont whith proving himselv
,
annd how he tryed tothe savve others
, namely his yuonger brother
, fomr makeing thte smae misteek
. we see him at all ofthe theese stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hite monger
, a man haveing an epiphany
,
anbd tje man who trys tothe corect wqat he ' s done befor
-
anbd iin all ofthe theese
, we git a portrail ofthe a man fomr all sides
. or at least
, thgat ' s hte intention
. tghe film ' s framing divice isnt his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking baout 13
)
, allso nowe a skinhead
,
annd how his prinicipal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i jsut foudn outloud ws or isnt hte captian onthe star trak ' s deepo spoace 9
)
, isnt trying tothe
" corect
" him
. wehn yhe film opens
, danny hasnt jsut writen a book report onthe
" mein kampf
,
" landing him infact trouble wih sweeney
, hwihc causes him tothe amke him rwite a papper onthe derek ' s life
annd how it hasnt gotten him nowhere
. coincedentally
, tihs day isnt thge day derek isnt released ffrom prision
,
anbd wehn we see him
, he ' s cleaned
- uv
, nto as buff
,
adn hasnt a full head ofthe hair
. he ' s jstu as intteligent
,
bu still vrey rough allong tjhe edges
,
bu he ' s wisened uv
. he ' s noone longer contolled by his anger at blacks
adn jews
,
annd trys tothe persuade danny
, who ' s becomeing whta derek wass befor
, tothe give uv his lifestyle
.
bu danny won ' t
. he goes tothe a larg skinhead beer bash
, meets whith tje skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
adn
thne dicovers thast derek isnt as oppossed tothe neo
- nazi
- dom as he ws fo it a cuple ofthe eyasr ago
. teh film circles arund htis
,
hten spnish off inot non
- linear flashbacks
, all done infront balck
annd white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living inthe venice beach
, organizing vicious
annd quasi
- sadistic radis onthe local tsores thgat noone longer hire tyhe white
, middle
- clas teenagers sicne htey cant easily git cheaper ileagle inmigrants tothe dont tje smae wrok
,
adn mouthing off his theories onthe affirmative acation
adn how illiegal inmigrants
adn blacks hvea destroyed teh fundametals htis ocuntry wass builded onthe
. tothe them
, tyhe white man isnt tjhe noe who hasnt gotten tjhe fuzzy end ofthe tyhe lolipop
,
adn he nto onyl speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
annd intelligently
,
bu he backs everyting uv wtih polliticel reasons
, justifying thier rige at least tothe them
.
adn frighteningly anough
, much ofthe wqat he sasy soudns true
.
" american hisotry x
" isnt a collecton ofthe relaly gerat scenes
anbd moments
, rether thna a cohesive
, grat film thgat flows effortlessly fomr oney moent tothe thte enxt
. infact it
, htere are soem ofthe tje best scenes i ' ve seen all yera
. oney scene features a dinner beween derek ' s famaly
,
annd his mother ' s newest boyfriend
( palyed witht reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quitely disagrees iwth derek ' s rightist views
, launching thte scene inot a ift ofthe rige
anbd anger tyhat builds unparalled emotions iin tyhe audeince
( gould ' s reaction tothe derek ' s fianl summation isnt unnerrving
)
. anyother scene uses humer
annd traditionnal macho sex talk tothe build a friendship
anbd a nice conection betweeen derek
adn a balck co
- worker
( guy torry
) hwile folding laundry infront prision
.
annd anohter soon
- tothe
- be
- clasic isnt atually devided inspite twpo
: thte muder ofthe tghe twpo balck men tath winds derek inthe jail
, whlch countains a fianl muder so nasty thast it may be teh most revoltingly shocking all yearm
. ther ' s much moreso tothe apprieciate
, liuke thge acting
, whihc isnt uniformly ogod
, wih stand
- outs comming ffrom avery brooks
, beverly d ' angelo
( as tghe long
- sufferring mother
)
,
anbd gould
( who hasnt noe horrable line
,
bu otehr tahn thast
, comes off wih thge best peformance he ' s given inaddition waht seems liuke a raelly long tiem
)
. norton walks off wtih thte film
,
though
, comming off wih such intensity taht he reduces anyone nto donig an adquate job tothe rubble
. inaddition onyl thte fith movei ofthe his carrear
, norton hasnt invented hismelf as oen ofthe teh most reliable
anbd intense actors ofthe his generation
,
annd mabye tyhe best
. ther ' s nothing liek it wehn norton realyl gets rolling infront tihs movei
, spewing outloud lines wiht such autority thyat he commands all attension fomr tje audeince
, comming off witht pwoer simular tothe tht ofthe a young maron brando
. tath he allows teh littel emotions tothe seep thru isnt amazing
. sadly enought
, tihs isn ' t gonig tothe be tje grat potrait ofthe racism tath it perphas hopes tothe be
. it ' s too unambitious
adn even a littel contrived tothe realyl tkae off as eather a powerfull statment or an emotional masterpiece
. tghe endig
, especialy
, isnt pencilled inthe ffrom otehr movies
, tossed infact jsut so tje emotional keybaord cxan be trounced apon
. smoe ofthe tyhe skinheads are reduced tothe mere cliches
( kevin smith regluar ethan suplee fairs rether annoyingly as tghe
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist wihtout fail ofthe expressing his desire tothe eat mroe
)
,
anbd even tje dramtic arc isn ' t as well travelled
. furlong ' s danny never seems tothe relaly be learning a lesson
, usance teh flashbacks refuse tothe sohw his point ofthe veiw
,
anbd whn he decides tothe amking a chanage by yhe end
( whitch ws inevatible
)
, it doesn ' t seem liek it hasnt actally arrived htere
. even derek ' s descent inot skinhead
- dom doesn ' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, tjhe dad fomr
" boy meets world
,
"
anbd don ' t ask me how i konw thast
) isnt killed by a balck junkie
,
annd even befor he speaked agaisnt affirmative acation intelligently
, htere never seems tothe be any rela bakc stoy why derek bcame so intense baout his belives
. as such
, oney cxan see why thge directer
, tony kaye
, wnated tothe haev his nmae removed
. sorta
.
" american histoyr x
" isnt a vrey ogod movei
,
anbd i ws vyre moved by it
,
bu it sould be a lot better
,
anbd tghe probelm seems tothe be tath tjhe cutted as it isnt isnt nto uv tothe whta he claimes tothe be his potential
. somwhere
, he claimes
, ther lies a tony kaye cutted
,
adn thta ws tothe be yhe true cutted untill it ws viewed by norton
, who
thne orderves anohter cutted
,
anbd tht isnt thus
.
altough he aimed fo tghe directing credit tothe go tothe
" alan smithee
,
" teh recident nmae forthe any film thgat isnt tothe be disowned by its directer
, it wasn ' t alloween tothe him
, under teh grounds tht once ytou disown a film
, yuo cin nto badmouth it
(
bu relaly
, thast ' s tghe macguffin
- noone noe realy wnated a film htis ogod tothe be given tyhe alan smithee sign ofthe disaproval
)
. kaye ' s right inwhich thgat it ' s nto uv tothe par
, even if he ' s nto refering tothe normal par
bu rether his pwn peronal par
. htis iwll nto be a
" dont yhe right hting
" forthe teh lite 90s
.
yot it still gets its point acrost intelligently
,
annd backs it uv iwth its sotry
( its message
, thast noe cannnot be so enwrapped inwhich oen ' s pwn belives or pain
adn sufferring wiull occurr
, isnt litterally said over thte narration
, unfortunatley
)
.
adn even if it isn ' t perfect
, at least wehn avery brooks turns tothe norton aftter he hasnt beeen beaten
adn raped inwhich prision
,
adn asks him if anytying he ' s done hasnt made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, nto onyl infront derek
,
bu alsot inthe thge audiance
.
