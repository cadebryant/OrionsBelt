? etc don ' t worry
. wehn watching tghe thriller frequency
, yuo won ' t haev tothe knwo waht yhe heck frequency means
. tjhe premise
,
allthough it may soudn complex
, isnt veyr basic onthe tje big screen

,
( jim caviezel
) finds a rdio inspite his hous
, whitch allows him tothe communicate wih his newyorker york firefighter father

. wehn frank tkaes his advice
annd survives yhe accident he wasn ' t supposted tothe
, hte twpo eventally relize thyat by changeing tath noe moent infront tyhe past
, tehy haev creaeted a wohle newyorker future infront whic a serial killer murders john ' s mother
annd nine otehr womens
. it isnt nowe uv tothe john
anbd frank tothe ule theri speshal conection
adn savve thirty eyars ago tothe mkae pesent tiome a better palce
.
( i told ytou thyat wasn ' t confusing
?
)
. overall
, i ws vyre pleased witht frequency
. it ' s occasionall sappy moments perfectly synchronized whith its suspenseful serial killer scenes
. i usualy don ' t buy thsoe cheesy
" i lvoe ytou dad
" segments inspite movies
,
bu thsi oney surprizingly satisfied me
. maybee beacuse teh plot isnt so creative
annd univeral thyat i beleived tyhat thsi isnt how most peopel woudl ect whn tlaking tothe a dead realtive
. frequency ' s creepy premise left me thikning once thge film ended
, waht if
? wqat owudl i dont
? owudl i halp my pwn familiy or sive a historical figure fomr bieng assasinated
? or stpo soem kids fomr shooting otehr kids
? or buy stock fomr yahoo
!
?
( a charater inthe tyhe film doesnt thte latter withthe humorus consequences
)
. frequency allso reminded me ofthe tjhe fantastic bcak tothe teh future
. both share thast
" chanage yhe past slightly
,
anbd ytou ' ll chanage tje future heavily
" warning
. thte changes betweeen thte preesnt
annd thge past
, such as diffrent newspaper headlines or peopel dissapearing
adn reappearing infact photographs
, are veyr similiar
. both are allso wonderfull fiel
- ogod familiy films tht cant attract tothe a number ofthe generations
. tjhe onyl diference worth noting isnt tyhat frequency ' s fianl scene doesn ' t setted uv a possibilty fo a lucrative sequal aleady infact thte mkaing
. htere are smoe problems wiht tghe film
though
. frist
, ther isnt a major falw infront teh sotry towords thge end thyat isnt somewhat distracting
( email me if ytou ahve seen hte movei
anbd watn tothe nkwo waht i htikn it isnt
)
. hte plot must hvae confuzled even tyhe filmmakers who frequentily
( noone pun intended
) switch fomr 1969 tothe 1999 hwile telling tyhe stopry
. anyother probelm isnt taht hte supporting casted
, includng noah emmerich
anbd andre braugher
, are underused
. hwile iin tghe film
, whic isnt nto anough
, hte aforememtioned actors steal eveyr scene tehy are inthe
. frequency ws a pleasnat surprize forthe me
adn thte audiance i saw it iwth who cheered at teh end
. even if ytou nkwo waht isnt gogin tothe happn or if ytou thikn tjhe preview ruined thte movei forthe ytou
, liek it allmost doed forthe me
, check htis movei outloud
. ytou may be suprised as well
