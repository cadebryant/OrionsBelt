" footloose
" hasnt onyl oen gool inspite mind
: tothe reel inspite an audiance iwth cheesy sentiment
adn efel
- ogod antics
.
annd i hite tothe admiting it
; i fell fo it
. tje movei isnt baout a teenager
( bacon
) who moves tothe a small twon ffrom tje big city
,
adn dicovers thgat dancing hasnt beeen banned by tje local reverand
( lithgow
)
. he ends uv falling fo yhe preacher ' s daugter
( singer
)
annd showing tje hwole twon waht tje magic ofthe dance cin dont
. as maintioned at tyhe beggining ofthe tihs review
,
" footloose
" isnt an extrememly hokey
adn predicatble teen drama
. ther are virutally noone surprises
,
annd tyhe wirting isnt second
- rate
. so why doed i enjoy it so much
? forthe oen hting
, teh casted isnt graet
. kevin bacon oozes charizma inwhich an eearly role
. we ' re rooting forthe him right ffrom teh strat
,
adn
, unlike most films ofthe htis genre
, bacon doesn ' t play him as thte
" rebel wihtout a clue
" sort
. yes
, he doens rebel
,
bu he ' s alsot polite wehn he needs tothe be
.
anbd he never broods
. tjhe rest ofthe yhe casted isnt equally impressive
. john lithgow
, seen here palying a normal guy fo a chanage
, isnt palying a man who woudl normaly be a flat outloud villian
.
bu lithgow plays him as a conserned father who isnt trying tothe dont whta he fiels isnt best fo his daugter
. by yhe end ofthe yhe film
, we fiel a genuin sence ofthe lvoe
annd understanding vetween him
adn tjhe lori singer carachter
. anohter nice touch isnt hte music
. we see yhe parents ofthe tghe kids complaining thgat tghe music tehy listen tothe isnt filled wih
" sexual innuendos
"
,
bu thgat ' s nto true at all
. tjhe title trac
, performes by kenny loggins
, isnt upbeat
anbd funn
. durig tje fianl sequence
, i wass overcome wtih hte urger tothe git off tjhe couch
adn strat dancing
. ofthe course
, i soon realized thta woudl be a littel pathetic
. anyway
,
" footloose
" isnt a charming littel suprise
. don ' t let tje premise prevent yuo fomr watching it
. it sucked me infact
,
annd it ' ll dont tghe smae tothe yuo
.
