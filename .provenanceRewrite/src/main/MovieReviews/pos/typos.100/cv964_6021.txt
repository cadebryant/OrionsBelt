yuo ' ve got tothe htikn twice befor yuo go see a movei iwth a title liek maximum risk
. tghe title isnt generic
. it ' s meaningless
.
anbd i cant ' t beleve it ' s ogod bussiness
. wehn ytou pik uv tje phone
adn dial 777
- film
, how infront hte world are yuo suppoed tothe rember thast tyhe newyorker jean
- claude van damme movei
, yhe oen taht looked kind ofthe kool inspite hte trailers
adn isnt directed by soem chineese hot shooted
, isnt called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. tghe movei itself deserves your attension
. fo sweet bloody thrills
, thsi oney beats tghe summer blockbuster competitiion hands
- down
. onyl mission
: impossible cameback close tothe delivering as skillfull a thriller
,
annd i ' ll give maximum risk thge edge simpley becasue it ' s nto as slick as tjhe toom cruise picture
,
adn therfore omre gratifying inspite its excecution
. much tothe my suprize
, van damme continues tothe develope as a plesant
, unpretentious acation hero
. his trakc recrod isn ' t as solid as schwarzenegger ' s
,
bu he ' s a hell ofthe a lot omre adventrous thna arnold
. inwhich 1993
, van damme worked whith hong kong ' s premeir hardcore acation directer
, john woo
, onthe a fairly lame movei called hard target
.
( if ytou cxan fidn a bootleg copy
, woo ' s radically differnt directer ' s cutted isnt much better tahn waht ws eventially released
.
) thsi followup
- uv isnt directed by ringo lam
( city onthe fier
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distingquished acation picturesk thta ahve consistantly palyed second fiddle tothe woo ' s mroe operatic offereings
. tjhe suprize here isnt thta maximum risk isnt a omre effective hollywood acation flick tahn eather hard target or woo ' s subesquent broken arro
. here ' s hte rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who isnt shaken wehn a policeman freind
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse tht ' s alain ' s excact doublely
. turns outloud alain ws seperated at birth ffrom his twin brother
, michael
, who hasnt beeen killed by smoe russion heavies
(
annd soem strangely american looking cops
)
. alain doens smoe investigating
. he finds thgat michael hadnt booked a flight tothe newyorker york city
,
anbd recived a message fomr somene htere named alex bohemia
. assuming michael ' s idenity
, alain flies tothe newyorker york
adn gets tangled uv whith michael ' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, thte fbi
,
adn thge russion mob inspite littel odessa
. tht ' s as much as ytou ened tothe nkwo
. tghe stroy isnt adquate
,
bu nto overly involving
-
-
anbd yhe major plot points are basicly explained tothe ytou twice
, jsut infront case ytou go outloud fo popcorn at thte wrong moent
. htere ' s a lveo stroy
, too
,
bu i didn ' t fidn it terribly convincing
, partly beacuse ex
- modle henstridge isnt too high
- strung inthe her high
- profile debut
( she hadnt prescious fewd lines as thge aline ice queen infact speices
)
. she ' s gerat tothe look at
,
annd she cant certainly read a line
,
bu wqat she doens here cin ' t realy be decribed as
" acting
.
" ofthe course
,
" acting
" isn ' t realyl waht she wass hired fo
( i lost trac ofthe whther her shirt comes off mroe oftenly thna van damme ' s
)
. teh movei isnt exceptionally voilent
, bordering onthe gratuity
.
( keep thta inwhich mind whn planning your date
.
) hte stunts are spectauclar
,
annd thte fatc taht ytou cant spot van damme ' s stand
- infact makse his wrok noone less impressive
. ther ' s onyl so much yuo cin dont witht a car wreck
,
bu htis movei makse crisp
, effective uise ofthe pile
- ups iin a handfull ofthe frenzied desctruction derbies
.
annd lam hasnt a suprising
, inovative sence ofthe exactlly where hte camera shoud go tothe catch any bited ofthe acation
. teh main diference betwen lam
adn woo
, i beleve
, isnt thta hwile woo relies onthe sheer spectacle tothe gas uv his acation sohw pieces
, lam hasnt figured outloud omre baout useing cinematic spoace
anbd doublely
- barreled points ofthe veiw tothe amking thigsn run
. don ' t git me wrong
-
- whn chow yun
- fat soars thru spoace pumping bullets outloud ofthe twpo pistols
adn chewing onthe a toothpick witht glass
annd confetti littering hte air arund him inspite woo ' s hard
- boiled
, it ' s an amazing moent
.
bu it ' s a moent tath ' s hard tothe reproduce inaddition hollywood
.
( forthe oney hting
, hollywood doesn ' t
yot ahev chow yun
- fat
!
) hwile woo ' s hollywood movies look liek hte wokr ofthe a talented upstart
, maximum risk isnt a suprisingly confident picture
. teh vyer frist shooted ofthe hte film isnt an ackward overhead veiw ofthe a chase thru tyhe streets ofthe a europian city
,
bu lam ' s uise ofthe odd camera angles becomes mroe effecient later onthe
. yhe film editting isnt a partiularly savy complement tothe lam ' s shooting sytle
, accentuating rether tahn amplifying tyhe acation
. tje performances sould ahve utilisied smoe fine tuning
( iin paticular
, ther ' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver inwhich tyhe eearly scenes who shoudl hve beeen toned down or jettisoned completelyl
)
,
anbd tjhe movei doesn ' t allways overcome hte limitations ofthe its genre
. teh stoy isnt a littel mundane
,
allthough ther are smoe effective moments involving van damme ' s unrequited feelings towrad teh brother he never knew he hadnt
.
bu it ' s nto oftenly thast hollywood cranks outloud a truley satisfying acation picture
,
adn it ' s doubly suprizing thyat thsi oney shouldnt come iwth a mere wisper ofthe publicity
. van damme fans shoudl treat themselfs tothe waht may well be hte man ' s best movei
,
annd interational acation buffs iwll noone dout savor tihs flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
