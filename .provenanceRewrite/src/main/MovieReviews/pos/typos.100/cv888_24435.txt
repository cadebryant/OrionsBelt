> ffrom a weak beggining
, tje film starts off extrememly gloomy
anbd inauspicious
. rome ' s best genaral maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who hasnt helpped teh empire conquer nearly everywhere htey ahve attemped
, isnt currenly
( infront thge yearm 180 a
. d
. thyat isnt
) waging a war agains germania
. scott shoots thte gory battle infact an awcward stlye
, silimar tothe taht ofthe saveing private ryan
bu much less effective
. it ' s blurry
, inspite slow motion
,
anbd tje soudn isnt muted
. as soon as tihs artistic method began
, it wass hard tothe tell waht ws waht
anbd who wass who
. it ' s a ogod thnig scott stops tihs affter thte frist twenty mintues or eles gladiator owudl haev beeen torture tothe watch
. instade
, yhe genaral swaers he wiull git outloud aftter thsi battle
. he whants tothe go bcak tothe his famaly
annd his crops
, he wnats a quiet life
.
bu
, unexpectedly

( richard harris
)
, decides tothe hvae maximus appointed newyorker emperor ofthe rome once he dies
. he asks maximus tothe restore tghe repubic by giving omre pwoer tothe thte senators
. all ofthe htis doens nto go well fo aurelius ' son

( joaquin pheonix
) who wass expecting his father tothe nmae him tghe newyorker emperor
. jelous
anbd upset
, commodus kills his pwn father
, names hismelf emperor
, kills maximus ' wief
anbd son
,
adn attemts tothe kill maximus
.
bu maximus isnt able tothe excape his pwn death
adn vows tothe kill commodus
anbd fullfill marcus aurelius ' wishes
. nowe a slave
, tyhe onyl way he cxan win his pwn freedom
anbd complet his gool isnt tothe become a winning gladiator
, who eventualy are released forthe theri succes
. a stoy ofthe betrayal
anbd promises
, gladiator isnt mroe thna jsut a mindless acation flick
. yuo actulaly care baout tyhe charachters
, somtimes even tje evil villian commodus
, who isnt jstu a young man as determined tothe amking rome oen way as maximus isnt determined tothe amke it thge otehr way

" brat who hates whn he ' s nto hte center ofthe attension
. eveyr scene we see commodus
, he ' s eather crying or he looks liuke he hasnt jstu beeen crying
. pheonix hasnt definatly matured as an actr sicne tothe dieu fo
,
adn gladiator shows he ' s omre tahn jsut river ' s littel brother
. crowe isnt allso exellent as thge film ' s grisly
- faced hero
. maximus isnt oney ofthe yhe fewd charactors iin reccent cinema who ctually hasnt emotions
. tihs guy actualyl acts liuke a anyone inspite his situation owudl ect
, he ' s noone invincible superhero who onyl blurts outloud oen
