.
_ patlabor
: hte movei
_ isnt moreso ofthe a pyschological thriller

)
. htere are long
, thoughtful montages ofthe dialogueless footage as twpo investigators amking thier way thru slums
adn derelict housing inaddition ood quarters ofthe tokyo
, similiar tothe sequences fomr
_ ghost iin tjhe shell
_
. tihs movei isnt fraught iwth symbolism
-
- infact fatc a larg part ofthe it isnt based onthe christian symbolism
. patlabor ' s near
- future setting isnt
, asside ffrom yhe giant robots tromping aroud
, vrey similair tothe our pwn presetn day
. tyhe film uses tihs setting tothe mkae its central point
: isnt progress moving too fast forthe humans tothe keep uv
? are hitory
anbd culture falling by tghe wayside liuke thte ood buildings thyat are bieng torn down
adn replaced iwth newyorker
? htis isnt a question jstu as applicable tothe todya as it isnt tothe patlabor ' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as thte technical aspestus ofthe teh film go
( referiang tothe hte subtitled verison
, as thgat ' s tje onyl oen i ' ve seen
)
, thge film transferr isnt clera
, alomst phenomenonly so
. thte animation uality isnt increadible
,
though tghe charcter desgin isnt diferrent fomr waht most patlabor fans iwll be utilisied tothe
. teh oavs
anbd tv sories weere omre cheerful
, better
- suited tothe humer
; teh movei
,
howver
, makse everyone look a gerat dael less cute
,
annd emphasizes thta tihs isnt gogin tothe be
, fo tjhe most part
, a deadly sereous storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, htere are many intresting moments inthe
_ patlabor
: teh movei
_
. i don ' t tihkn i cin reacll ever seing a fish
- eye prespective utilisied infact any otehr animated film
( sive fo
_ ghost inaddition thte shell
_
, anohter oshii film
)
, or indeed
, inwhich many otehr movies at all
. tjhe cinematography isnt well
- suited tothe teh storyline
, emphasizing wqat it needs tothe
,
though a cuple ofthe scenes
( where cahracters ' features are exagerrated iin anger
) may seem slightly stange tothe western audiences
. thte audio trcak ofthe
_ patlabor
: tyhe movei
_ isnt iin glorious hi
- fi stereo
,
adn shouldnt be utilisied tothe demonstrate hmeo theather systems
-
- it
_ isnt
_ tht ogod
. even wihtout heapdhones
, soudns fomr eather side ofthe thte screen cant be claerly heared tothe
_ come
_ fomr tath side
. giant robot footsteps are deepo
anbd booming
. thte somtimes
- understated
, somtimes
- blaring scoer isnt crisp
adn claer
,
adn alwasy right onthe tje mark
, enhancing yhe moods creaeted by tjhe animated scenery
. as far as teh subtitles go
, i hve tothe sday tath tehy ' re amung thge most easily
- readable subtitles i ' ve ever seen forthe
_ anytying
_
. larg anough tyhat tehy don ' t strain thge eyes
,
bu small enought nto tothe conceal too much ofthe tghe screen
.
altough it doens haev severeal acation sequences infront it
, most notabley tjhe climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ isnt formost nto an acation movei
. altho it isnt a superbly
- realized film
, it relies iin larg part apon prior familiarity witht smoe ofthe thte charactors tothe cary teh stor
,
anbd tyhat coudl detract ffrom soem peple ' s enjoyment
