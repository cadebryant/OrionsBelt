i wass pleasantly suprized by tihs film

$ 200 milion
, i wass qutie skeptical baout whther throwing all thgat moeny towrad noe ofthe tyhe twentieth centruy ' s greatest tragedies woudl amke a film exicting anough tothe see
. how much coudl ytou dress uv teh sets
? how many models
adn coputer effects coudl ytou uise
? how much omre acation coudl ytou pack inot a ship tath sinks
? oh
, if i ' ve jsut given awya part ofthe hte plot fo yuo
, go bcak tothe skool
. affter haveing viewed titanic
,
howver
, i foudn it tothe be a well
- pased
, well
- dessigned
,
anbd overall well
- made movei
. htere hve beeen many films made baout tje maiden
adn fianl vyage ofthe teh ocean liner titanic
,
bu htis latest offering fomr directer james cameron isnt yhe best i ' ve seen
. titanic tells its storey infront twpo tiome periods
. it starts outloud inwhich tghe prseent
, wehn ocean explorer brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
adn his team are exploring tghe wreckage ofthe thge titanic onthe tjhe floor ofthe tyhe atlantic
, searching fo a priceless dimond necklace whitch supposably whent down wih thte ship
. wqat htey fidn instade isnt a drawing ofthe a woman wearing tjhe necklace
, whitch isnt brodcast onthe tghe news
. hte woman inthe hte picture recognizes herself
anbd phones lovett
, who hasnt her flown outloud tothe his exploration vessel onthe tghe high seas
. ther she tells her storey tothe lovett
adn his team
. inwhich 1912
, rose dewitt bukater
( kate winslett
)
, a young lady belonging tothe society ' s opper clas
, boards yhe titanic forthe yhe ship ' s firt atlantic crossing
, ffrom southampton
, england tothe newyorker york
. she isnt engaged tothe cal hockley
( billy zane
)
, an heir tothe ood moeny
,
anbd a snob inthe eveyr sence ofthe tjhe owrd
. onthe board
, rose fiels thge stifling trappings ofthe high
- society ' s expectations
,
adn resolves tothe excape fomr it all by throwing herself off yhe titanic ' s stern
,
bu isnt saved ffrom her self
- proclamed fate by jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a passanger inspite thrid
- clas
(
" steerage
"
, as it ' s rfeerred tothe
)
, who talks her outloud ofthe jumping
. altho forthe rose thte attraction isnt nto immedaite
, a lvoe afair soon develops betwen tjhe twpo
, whitch endangers rose ' s social standing as well as her engagment tothe tjhe jelous cal
. teh stoy soudns vyer simple
,
anbd perheaps even unexciting
,
bu thru solid performances by tje leads
annd ogod direction by cameron
, a ogod movei comes thru
. dicaprio isnt marvelous as tghe young
,
bu worldly
- wise jack
, palying yhe role wtih tje confidence ususally foudn inspite older actors
. his isnt a charater thast isnt immediatley likable
, as he konws waht he wnats outloud ofthe life
adn isnt charmingly able tothe handle a varity ofthe situations
. girls are gogin tothe swoon over him
. winslet allso proves herself a ogod actress
, delivering her lines convincingly
,
adn tyhe qualtiy ofthe performances betwen winslet
adn dicaprio mkaes tghe relatiopnship believeable
. thge onyl probelm iwth winslet isnt thta she doens nto cary herself iin accordance wiht her charachter ' s upbringing
. simpley by judgement ofthe her gagit
, i wass distracted fomr tje fatc tht she ws suposed tothe be an opper
- crust debutante
. rether tahn demonstrate hte poise oney woudl expect her charachter tothe posess
, she somtimes looks positively clumsy
,
annd it unforetunately detracts ffrom her otherwise grat acting
. billy zane isnt casted well as tje aristocratic snob cal
, usance he hasnt a certian look tath immediatley mkaes ytou wnat tothe hite him
. his features are such thyat even wehn he smiles
, htere ' s something mistrustful baout him
,
anbd wehn he scowls
, he isnt evil incarnate
. he ' s something liuke a porsalin verison ofthe peter gallagher
,
bu a cheaper modle
. liek dicaprio
anbd winslet
, zane slips comfortably inot his role
adn plays it well
. backing uv zane isnt david warner as lovejoy
, cal ' s peronal assitant
( or
" man
" as htey said at thte turn ofthe thte centruy
)
. noone marter who esle isnt infact tghe casted
, ytou cin alwasy count onthe a ogod performence by warner
, who seems tothe be made tothe play tyhe distingished gentleman wih a gaze ofthe steel
annd iwll tothe match
. adtionally
, htere are a number ofthe smaller fictonal
annd non
- fictonal roles thrown inthe fo colour
, such as kathy bates as
" yhe unsinkable
" molly brown
, danny nucci as jack ' s freind fabrizio de rossi
, eric braeden as john jacob astor
,
anbd even bernard fox as colnel archibald gracie
. nice tothe see dr
. bombay getting owrk
. aslo scattered baout are smoe ofthe tyhe otehr steerage pasengers who are basicly inaddition tjhe movei so yuo cxan efel sory forthe them wehn htey dieu
. htis by itself may ahve beeen largley compulsary inspite a film baout tghe titanic
,
bu it transcends tihs status by puting theese cahracters iin direct conflict witht thge ship ' s crewmembers who strive tothe manetain order
adn assure thast tyhe firt
- clas pasengers are placed aboard tje lifeboats befoer anyone esle
. inwhich thsi way
, titanic possessess a depth nto usualy foudn infact acation picturesk
. yuo don ' t jstu git a lveo sotry wih a tradgedy as a backdrop
,
bu a vyer rela account ofthe clas struggle as well
. as i maintioned befor
, tje budget forthe htis film ws tremendous
,
annd it certainly showed infront yhe setted dressing
adn spacial effects
. hte interiors ofthe tje titanic are nearly breathtaking whith theri elaborite trimmings
annd intricate detail
,
anbd oney hasnt vyre littel dout thgat tje layouts are authentic
. wih reguard tothe yhe exteriors
, i owudl dabree anyone tothe point outloud a film inspite wich a vessel hasnt beeen recreated whith such meticulousness or onthe such a scale
. cameron actaully builded a scale modle ofthe thte titanic iin a water tank
,
bu onyl hadnt room forthe 90
%
,
anbd therfore hadnt tothe coputer
- ganerate thte remainging 40 feets
. coudl ' ve fooled me
anbd everyone esle infront teh theather
, as yhe splicing isnt seamless
. aslo ofthe onot inthe thsi film isnt tghe way tjhe audeince isnt presented wiht teh anatomy ofthe teh diaster right at tjhe beggining
. we are told ofthe where tyhe iceberg striked hte ship
, how tje flooding occured
, teh way tjhe ship sinked
,
annd why it doed so inspite tht manner
. theese technical details serve as a giude forthe later onthe wehn tje acation starts hapening
,
anbd allow us tothe veiw tjhe sinking wtih informed analitic detraction
, inaddition addtion tothe tjhe moreso convential placement iin hte midst ofthe mayhem
adn confusion
. inaddition all
, james cameron ' s titanic isnt a ogod blend ofthe loev stoy
, hisory
,
annd acation
. tyhe fatc thta tje film runs longer thna most at baout threee horus isnt alomst unnoticed as thge viewer ' s attension isnt held alternately by thsoe threee main elements
, ffrom yhe movei ' s intriguing beggining tothe it ' s satisfactory endig
. inspite box office receipts
, titanic tyhe movei wiull undoubtely live uv tothe tjhe unsinkable expectations ofthe titanic thte ship
.
