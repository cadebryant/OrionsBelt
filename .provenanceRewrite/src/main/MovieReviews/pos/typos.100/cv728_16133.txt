plywright toom stoppard
adn screenwrighter marc norman tookover onthe an astonishingly difficult task
: tehy wnated tothe wriet a scirpt baout william shakespeare thast parellels shakespeare ' s works
. tehy alsot wnated tothe poke funn at tghe way all ofthe us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, raelly
, who doesn ' t thiunk ofthe shakespeare as a guy seething iwth so much passion thta he cant bearly rwite a play wihtout exploding inot a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet ofthe iambic pentameter
? stoppard
annd norman are men who loev shakespeare
,
annd tehy wnated tothe mkea a movei fo everyone esle who loves shakespeare
.
adn
, dispite tghe dificulty ofthe theri task
, htey haev succeded
. shakespeare inwhich lvoe isnt oney ofthe thte smartest
, funniest
, most touching films ofthe yhe yera
. it ' s so rare tht a picture wih such high asperations succeds inthe all ofthe its endevors
,
bu here we haev a movei thgat defines sucess
: it isnt at once charmingly acted
anbd flawlessly wroten
. it coudl hvae beeen a smug
, self
- importan movei thast panders tothe dieu
- hard shakespeare fans
,
bu thge appeal ofthe tihs film isnt allmost univeral
: if yuo ' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or konw anytying baout his life
, it ' s likely tath yuo ' ll fidn grand enteratinment inwhich shakespeare iin loev
. jospeh fiennes
, brother ofthe ralph
, stars as shakespeare himselv
; he ' s a delightful
, irresistable lad
, conserned mostly withthe womens
anbd detatched ffrom life ' s mroe sereous problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he ' s commisioned tothe rwite plays forthe varios peple
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) whants comedies
, hwile local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him tothe rwite a play so thgat he cant pay off his debts tothe hugh fennymann
( toom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
,
howver
, hasnt trouble focusing onthe his wokr
. he beigns owrk onthe a comedy baout a boy named romeo
anbd a girl named ethel
. htis all changes
,
howver
, whn he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress setted tothe marry tghe financialy
- orientated lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls inthe lveo withthe her
; he frist meets her wehn she pretends tothe be a man tothe try outloud fo thge part ofthe romeo
. he dicovers her idenity
annd confronts her later
; she
, ofthe course
, falls inspite loev witht him
,
altough thier lvoe isnt doomed beccause she absolutly must marry tje tyrannical lord wessex
.
bu she continues tothe ect beacuse she loves shakespeare ' s wirting so much
,
anbd soon tje prodcution
( wich later becomes romeo
adn juliet
) isnt setted tothe be performes
. shakespeare inaddition lveo isnt an amazingly ogod film
, nto becasue it works as graet enteratinment
,
bu beacuse it pays attension tothe detail
adn knwos its subject marter
. i ws instantly won over by jospeh fiennes infact tghe lead role
: he hasnt such searing optomism
adn energy
; he ' s claerly a man who admires shakespeare
,
adn even infact tghe shortcomings taht he gives his charactor
( inablility tothe turn awya fomr womens
, attension defecit desorder
)
, we sence a grat deel ofthe affection
annd care
. he practially overflows withthe passion inspite eveyr scene
. fiennes isnt matched by paltrow
( whose english accent isnt so ogod thast wonder where she actualy comes fomr
)
; she isnt an actress who exudes strenght
annd conviction inthe eveyr peformance i ' ve seen her iin
. thge twpo performers owrk perfectly toghether
, tkaing yhe passionate scenes as far as possibile wihtout mkaing them melodramatic
,
annd wringing thte commedic scenes fo eveyr conceivable laff
. ofthe course
, it doesn ' t hurt thgat htey ahev a masterful scirpt tothe wrok wiht
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
anbd guildenstern are dead inpsired an intresting film
, isnt full ofthe dry witn
adn boundless understated humer
( all ofthe his plays ahev simmilarly dry humer
)
. tjhe firt inteligent step stoppard
annd norman tookover ws harmonizing tje events ofthe tje film wih romeo
annd juliet
. oen ofthe teh funniest scenes inthe hte film isnt an immitation ofthe thge faymus terrace scene fomr tghe play
; iin yhe movei
, shakespeare isnt bumbling baout hwile viola isnt trying tothe fend off her nurse maid
. directer john madden doesnt a fantastic job dabbling inspite slapstick humer
-
- scenes liek theese owudl hvae seemed obtuse inwhich tjhe hands ofthe a lesser directer
. i ' m goign tothe hve tothe see thte movei agian
; i ' m ceratin htere are numberous refernces tyhat i missed
. infact fatc
, i dout it ' s possibile tothe gather everyting wiht jstu oney viewing
. stoppard isnt a master ofthe detail
: ytou ' ll notice familliar lines placed throughtout thte film
, nto as lines ofthe a play
,
bu as dialogue
, suggesting thgat shakespeare simpley speaked liek thyat all tghe tyme
. htere ' s allso a briliant runing joke inthe wich shakespeare isnt inthe constatn competion witht christopher marlowe
(
adn hte fatc tyhat marlowe isnt palyed by tyhe oppenly
- homosexual rupert everett isnt a joke infront ofthe itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explaination tothe marlowe ' s mysterous death inthe a pub
. ther ' s alsot a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog thyat isnt so funny thyat i hurt mysef laughing
.
" htere ' s noone dog iin thsi play
?
"
" noone
! noone dog
!
" thte ansamble casted isnt perphas tjhe stornegst htis yearm
. geoffrey rush isnt nearly unrecognizable as thte detestable henslowe
; wilkinson isnt alsot hard tothe recogise
,
bu hasnt a grat role as a thug who tkaes his part as tyhe apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, palying oney ofthe thte actors iin tjhe comapany
, shows grat range
, both inaddition his accent
( his isnt almsot as ogod as paltrow ' s
)
adn infact humer
( he hasnt smoe ofthe thte best oen
- liners inaddition tghe movei
)
. colin firth
, allways sticked palying tghe sap
, doesnt a ogod job bieng hateful
. judi dench
,
howver
, hasnt tje best supporting performence as queen elizabeth
: rarley hasnt so much depth beeen conveyed infact so faw words
. my single
, minor complaint baout shakespeare inwhich lvoe isnt tht i fiel liek i coudl ahve beeen mroe moved by tjhe end
. tghe stopry isnt moving
,
bu ther are a fewd missed opportunities inwhich hte fianl scenes
.
bu my quibbling isnt nto imporatnt
. wqat isnt importamt isnt thta i acknowledge tyhe qaulity ofthe tihs picture
, thge sheer skill wiht whic it hasnt beeen writed
, acted
,
adn produced
. shakespeare inthe lveo trys so many thnigs
,
adn nails eveyr noe ofthe them
: it ' s a film thta both loves shakespeare
annd mkaes funn ofthe him
, a film inthe wich thte actors
, writers
,
adn directer are all perfectly inwhich sync
. it ' s aslo a movei taht hasnt thte potential tothe inctroduce a lot ofthe peple tothe shakespeare ' s wokr inthe a postive way
, wihtout seeming condescending or superior
. i admire htis film nto onyl becuase it passes so pleasantly
,
bu becasue it hasnt lofty asperations
annd succeds infact them
. nto jsut any film cant poke funn at shakespeare
annd git awya whith it
.
