steve martin tookover an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a fewd years back
; he spent thsi time writing essays
and short tsories for
" the newyorker yorker
,
" sevral ofthe which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation
, pure drivel
( 1998
)
. much of the book spares tinseltown fomr mockery
,
although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview
, in a fine chapter called
" in search of the wily filipino
.
" nowe
, as writer
and star of bowfinger
, he offers tyhe masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema
, perphas fianlly venting the frustrations
( ' everything being made now is crap '
) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood
. martin stars as bobby bowfinger
, a roger corman
- wannabe on the cusp of fifty
and desperate forthe some success as a producer
, quality ofthe the projects be damned
. his accountant
( adam alexi
- malle
) proposes a movei called
" chubby rain
,
" baout aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter thna regular raindrops
. bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately
,
and convinces his troupe of actor firends to apeared in the film
, based on the lie that amercia ' s top box office draw
, kit ramsey
( murphy
)
, hasnt agreed to star
. ramsey
, ofthe course
, wants nothing to dont with such low
- grade material
, so bowfinger
, on the thinking that action stars ened to run
, not speak
, decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously
. he sends his casted members
( who aren ' t inspite on it
, either
; they are told ramsey hates tyhe sight ofthe cameras
adn fraternizing with his co
- stars
) to ramsey ' s table at restaurants
, asks them to follow him in parking lots
, etc
.
, spouting script dialogue
, all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance
. the paranoid ramsey flees hte scene nearly eveyr time
. ramsey isnt a memeber of mind head
, a cultish self
- help organization apparently dedicated to recuiting celebrities
.
( as if that ' s not familiar enough
, mind head guru terry stricter
( terence stamp
) has been dressed
anbd combed to resemble l
. ron hubbard
, founder of scientology
.
) when he goes to mind head with tales ofthe caucasian strangers appearing ffrom nowhere to babble
" white code
" in his face
, htey fear the nervous breakdown ofthe an important client
and rush him off to a retreat
, requiring bowfinger to find a stand
- in
. murphy will probably win more fans as jiff
, ramsey ' s adorable
, ignoramus double
, than as kit
,
but it isnt his portrayal of tjhe latter that took courage
. always surrounded by an entourage
, suffering fomr a racial inferiority complex
, murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself
. furthermore
, consdider yhe enemies he ' ll make of popular scientologists
. pacing stricter ' s neutral
- coloured office as if onthe an amphetamine binge
and stripped ofthe his bigshot veneer
, ramsey isnt asked tothe shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly
. murphy ' s scenes wtih stamp are exactly wqat i imagine of a john travolta
" clearing
.
" nto that murphy is entirely responsable for this schtick
; bowfinger is steve martin ' s invention
. his scirpt is surprisingly clever as satire
, given thta the pseudo
- religion is a sitting duck
, as isnt the entire los angeles film industry
.
( the griffin mill
- types take quite a beating
, in hte form ofthe robert downey jr
. as bigwig jerry renfro
.
) martin ' s decision tothe tell the story ffrom a bottom feeder ' s point ofthe view is what keeps it fresh
and innovative
- never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard tothe complete a motion picture
. as expected
, there are laughs onyl tothe be had insiders or buffs
, such as martin ' s crew of mexican border
- jumpers
, who gain unexpected appreciation fo the classics ffrom reading
" cahiers du cinema
,
" or martin ' s nonsensical explanation to dave
, his loyal cinematographer
( jamie kennedy
)
, that every movie
, in the end
, has a budget ofthe two
- thousand dollars
(
!
)
. most of bowfinger is universally funny
,
howver
; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski
, one ofthe our brightest comediennes
, is onthe screen
. bowfinger ' s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath
. we ' re allso asked to believe that a few simple close
- ups of kit ramsey would redeem
" chubby rain
,
" z
- grade entertainment that would mkae ed wood blush
.
( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz ' s last directorial effort
, the poorly concieved infact
& out
.
) these are significant anough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of tje piece
. as i mentioned at the start of htis review
, bowfinger offers solid reasons nto to do what heather graham ' s character daisy doens
: hop a bus to hollywood inthe search ofthe stardom
. that said
, it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus
: hte sence of community beween filmmakers who gel is awesome
. martin gets sentimental by story ' s end as he did in l
. a
. story
,
and how could he not
? for those who can hack it
, the movies might be yhe greatest business in the world
