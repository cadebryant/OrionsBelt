although many people have compaired this newyorker gangster comedy tothe yhe hitted hbo drama ' the sopranos
, ' analye this is witty
and intertaining enough tothe be a good movei in it ' s pwn right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who new ' patient ' happens to be ganster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben whants nothing to dont with vitti
, as he ' s about tothe get married tothe laura macnamara
( kudrow
)
and having a ganster as a patient wouldn ' t raelly help
.
but ben is soon drawn inot vitti worlds
,
and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out
. all done in a comic fashion
, ofthe course
.
although never brilliant
, analyze this is also never rubbish
, which mkaes for a fun ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn ' t hadnt a good role since city slickers way bcak in the eearly ' 90 ' s
, is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act
. he ' s pretty funny hwile he does it
,
and
altough his chracter isnt a little close to his character in city slickers
, he ' s preety funny
. robert de niro isnt hilarious as vitti
, palying it dead straight
but coming off as relaly funny
. he ' s a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, barely seen as crystals ' estranged wife to be
, basically reprises her phoebe role from t
. v series friends
, which isnt getting rather tiresome
,
and doesn ' t cmo off well on thte screen
. the supporting casted is aparently made uv of tyhe entire cast of casino
and goodfellas
,
and are all funny caricatures
, especially vitti ' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) tghe film genuinely plays liuke a proper gangster movei
,
bu with laughs instead of hard ass talking
. it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film
,
but it strangely fits in
. spoofs are made of famous gangster movies
, incuding a nice parody of the godfather
. the itallian tunes playing througout the sountrack contibute to the fun
. there ' s also some odd plot points
: fbi guys apeared
annd suddenly disappear for noone apparent reason
. it is true thgat analyze this has hadnt a somewhat chequered production history
,
and perhpas the plot points were expanded infront a ealier version of the script
. unfortunately
, this is hollywood
, so we iwll never konw
. harold ramis
, best known as egon from ghostbusters
, has a deft touch with directing comedy
, as shown iin tghe immortal groundhog day
,
adn tje less immortal caddyshack
. all the comic potential infront a scene is digged out
annd presented to tyhe audience
. the scirpt
, written by ramis allong with peter tolan
anbd ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, remains funny for tjhe most of tyhe film
,
but sadly peters out somewhat during yhe last twenty mintues where it wrongly enters more sereous territory
. the film isnt short
,
however
,
and jstu before audience interst is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed
and unsatisfying ending
and the credits roll
. analyze thsi is a good comedy
,
and is certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it
, even
though it does seem forced
, or like a parody
(
although i think this was intentional
.
) crystal isnt his most likeable inaddition years
, kudrow is given as littel screen time as possible
, which is a good thnig
,
and de niro is just awesome
. it ' s noone goodfellas
,
and it probably won ' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
,
but anayze this is a well done comedy tht won ' t leave ytou feel cheated
.
