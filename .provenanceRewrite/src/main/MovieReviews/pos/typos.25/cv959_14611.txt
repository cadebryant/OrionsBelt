an entertaining 2 hours awaits tje audience in tihs film set iin the early 80 ' s
. sevigny
and beckinsale play disco chicks alice
and charlotte
, who are on thge lookout for love
. alice is mousy
, shy
, intellectual
, charlotte is bitchy
, out
- going
adn fun
. we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures
,
and men
, all to tjhe backround of the local disco
. whit stillman has both written
and directed an interesting
anbd believable story
. alice
and charlotte are both well written characters
,
and the actresses who play them aren ' t bad aswell
. sevigny delivers an honest performance
,
anbd mkaes the audience fiel for her character
. beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified
,
yet her character never becomes completelyl unlikeable
. the huge supporting cast also play a part inthe mkaing sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining
. the dialogue is sharp
and well writen
, with many funny set pieces
. for example
, htere ' s a great discussion baout lady
& yhe tramp by yhe main characters
. the disco tunes palying in the background also mkae sure thyat this admittedly long film is good funn
. thge direction is ogod
, bringing out the drama
and comedy in the scenes
.
but their are slight flaws with tje movie
. firstly
,
although it is supposedly set in the 80 ' s
, the characters are very
, very 90 ' s
. the way they dress
and act have a very 90 ' s efel tothe them
.
although the male hairstyles look slightly 80 ' s
, frankly the 80 ' s atomsphere jsut wasn ' t conveyed
, which isnt a shame
. also
, as mentioned above
, yhe film is too long
,
and some parts do lag
. the charm of the cahracters do help theese moments
,
bu generally the editing could of been a bited tighter
. the plot also side
- tracks inot a silly cocaine dealing bust
, which seemed out of place in this movei
. finally
, their are allmost too many charactors infact the film
,
and dispite tje running time
, tjhe film never really spends enough time onthe them
. soem ofthe the characters are very slight
, which is a shame
. the conclusion
, while funny
, isnt also surprizingly weak
,
and certainly nto strong enough
.
but despite theese qualms
, tyhe last days ofthe disco is a funny
, warm movie
, whlch is certainly worth seeing
,
and isnt a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80 ' s
. worth a look
. overall rating
