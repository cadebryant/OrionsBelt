anbd white trash of florida ' s sourth coast
. plot

. the counselor isnt brought to court on tje charges
, as another white trash girl
( campbell
)
, also joins the rape finger
- pointing club
. as the story unfolds
, we find taht many things aren ' t exactly as they seem
( taht ' s as much as i could say without ruining anything
)
. critique
: good littel flick that slows down at certain points
,
and runs a tad long
,
but generates enough twists
anbd turns to keep most peopel interseted throughout
. mind you
, i could see many people not liking it baceause it takes
" one too many
" twists
and turns
,
bu hey
, i happen to like that kind of thing
.
anbd besides
, tjhe twists
and turns in htis movie managed tothe remain within the realm of believability
( or scathingly close tothe
)
,
and even
" explained
" many of its turns wtih a showcase ofthe missed scenes durring teh credit crawl at the end of the film
( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits
.
.
. it realyl does clear uv some stuff
!
!
)
. otehr tahn that
, teh acting was ogod
, with campbell transforming her
" ogod girl stereotypical
" role into a pot
- smoking
, goth
- looking white trash chick out fo a good time
. denise richards
( from starship troopers
( 7
/ 10
) fame
) solidifies herself as hollywood ' s jelly
- donut pinup girl ofthe the moment
,
and proves tyhat all breast implants needn ' t lead to lawsuits
. bacon isnt solid
,
and so isnt dillon
( while continuing to proove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world
!
!
)
. sprinkle the story iwth a bunch o ' shots of alligators peeking through teh swamp waters
, bacon showing the world the size of his ding
- dong
( do we raelly need to see this
?
?
)
, a couple of lesbian kissing scenes
,
and a menage
- a
- trois
,
and you ' ve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre
. onthe thte down side
, the sountrack was not as prominent
( or slick
) as i thought it would be
,
and theresa russell
( real nmae
: theresa paup
) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible
.
.
.
. ooooh
, i almost forgot bill murray ' s exquisite role as tje down
- trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in cout
. murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film tothe affirm its positon as a quirky little noirish tale of sex
, greed
adn mystery
. little known facts
: neve campbell specified a non
- nudity clause in her contract
( she ' s also born in guelph
, ontario
.
.
. go hoser
!
) director john mcnaughton syas he deleted a scene thast woudl ahev shown matt dillon

, called tjhe bacon brothers
, is married tothe actress kyra sedgwick
,
and has a game based on him called
" six degrees ofthe kevin bacon
"
