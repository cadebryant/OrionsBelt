i feel noone hesitation in saying taht
" there ' s something about mary
" is the best film that i iwll see all year
. from the moment thte credits started to roll at thte end of the picture
, there was no dout in my mind that i hadnt seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaning monthes ofthe 1998
. it isnt that good of a film
. when ginee siskel said this about
" fargo
" onyl a few months into ' 96
, i dismissed tjhe notion as ridiculous
. how could you possibly nkwo that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in tje future could beated it
?
bu affter seeing the farrelly ' s hilarious
and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork
, i now know wqat siskel was talking about
. once in a
( very great
) while
, a film comes along that is so daring
, so brilliant
adn simpley so enjoyable that at tje end
, ytou just want to stand up
and cheer
.
and you know
, at that instant
, that you hvae jstu experienced something very spacial
. now for the shocker
;
" mary
" isnt the grossest
and most disgusting film i have ever viewed
(
" pink flamingos
" obviously notwhithstanding
)
. hte movie is so rude
and
, i guess
, inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents
( luckily i hadnt seen it before them
, so i sould warn the about what they were in for
)
. foreget
" blazing saddles
"
,
" animal house
"
and even the former king ofthe gross
- out comedy
,
" monty python ' s meaning of life
"
; they weere all only preludes to thge farrelly ' s assault on the senses
. in fatc
, tihs may even be the funniest film i ' ve ever hadnt the pleasure ofthe seeing
( the onyl real contendor is
" monty python
and the holy grail
"
)
,
annd most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade
.
bu as funny as it is
, something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of
" mary
"
; it hasnt a huge heart
. yuo see
, the farrelly ' s are truly gifted filmmakers
. htey don ' t jstu present you with a string of dick
anbd fart jokes
(
although there are plenty to go around
)
. htey also
, very wisely
, add an unbelievable amount of charisma tothe the main charachters
and actually have them deveop as thte story progresses
. it ' s funny
,
though
. if you just look at an outline of the story
, it seems kind of contrived
and predicatble
.
but believe me
, it is anything
but
. ben stiller plays ted
, a veyr shy
adn clumsy teenage geek who lusts affter the school babe
, mary
( cameron diaz
)
. affter he sticks uv fo her retarded brother
, warren
( w
. early brown
- the cameraman
, believe it or not
, from
" scream
"
)
, his dreams come true whn she invites him to the prom
. inspite one of tyhe film ' s funniest scenes
, something goes wrong
( i won ' t ruin it for those who know nothing about yhe film
)
and ted is unable to face mary ever agina
. jump to the preesnt
. after years of self
- loathing
, ted finally hires private detective pat healy
( a suitably slimy matt dillon
) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school
. healy finds thta mary is still a full
- blown hottie
annd decides to try
and keep her for himselv
. admittingly
, the basic stor line leaves a little tothe be desired
. after all
, with a not
- really
- all
- that
- funny premise
, how can you sustain laughter forthe nearly two huors
? somehow
, the farrelly ' s pull it off
. the performances here are also right on target
. as ted
, stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to mkae his character not irritating
, as he would normally be
,
but vrey lovable
.
and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons
,
but the acotr who really grabs your attention is w
. earl brown as mary ' s brother
. no other actor has even come close tothe playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here
. i know he won ' t be nominated
,
but this isnt the guy who should not be counted out wehn it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february
. as ogod as the actors are
,
though
, it ' s the directors ' movei all the way
. i guarantee tyhat on almsot every other top ten list at thte end of the eyar
, you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg ' s wwii epic
" saving private ryan
"
.
and yes
, tyhat is a great film worthy of the recognition it hasnt beeen getting
.
but which is harder
; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can ' t breath for minutes at a timne
? i ' ll let ytou decide that one for yourself
,
but this critic is sticking to his guns
. there is jsut something baout
" mary
"
.
