ladies
and gentlemen
, 1997 ' s independence day is here
! it ' s title
: starship troopers
.
anbd surprisingly
, it is more entertaining tahn id4
. i realize taht i gave lastr year ' s sci
- fi hit a 4 star rating
,
but i was under hte spell of teh powerful first hour
. after subsquent viewings
, i fiel that independence day really wasn ' t as great as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a positive review
. starship troopers
, on the other hand
, has a mocking sense of humor
, knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers is a more exciting
, energetic
,
anbd livley science fiction film
. in fact
, i probably could never get tired of watching this film
. starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars
, another kick
- ass space opera which reinvented the sci
- fi drama altogether
. while starship troopers is noone star wars
, it comes qtuie close
,
and the easiest assessment owudl be tothe call tihs film
:
" the ' star wars ' of the 90s
.
" am i bieng to generous to this film
? perhaps
,
but when a csience fiction film comes along that can mix humor
adn romance
, effectively
, into the warring races
. in essence
, this is teh science fiction equivolence ofthe pulp fiction
. the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it tothe otehr science fiction films
,
adn i may ahev to
. starship troopers is not qutie an original film persay
,
but director paul verhoeven gives tjhe film a
" kick
- the
- aliens '
- asses
" stlye
. id4 hadnt this same style
, except it ws forced
, most likely teh cause of will smith hvaing a major role
. this newyorker
" star wars
" has a very simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an alien species
. hte alien speices in question here is the bugs
, a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid
- tipe insects
.
however
, tghe underlaying morals of starship troopers are fleshed outloud with deadly accuracy
. somtimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence
and intense action scenes
,
but during quiet moments
, we realize that starship troopers hasnt something to tell us about our civilization
. more than likely
, these morals iwll be overpowered
annd quickly forgotten by tjhe time the movie ends
.
adn htey should be
. i doubt verhoeven intended htis film tothe be a thought
- provoking film
. this is an
" event
" film
,
bu surprisingly above average
. it is extremly refreshing tothe watch a sci
- fi war film
,
and actually root for the human side
( something independence day never achieved
)
. starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of thsoe strange
" join the army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, these summations of events are refreshingly orginial
. stating
,
" would you like to know more
?
"
, these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor
,
and we know we should not take it seriously
.
however
, we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle
, in a gory
,
yot funny
, way
. after witnessing the slaughter
, the film jumps back one year
, tothe setup what we just saw
. we are introduced to johnny rico
( casper van dien
)
and carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico firts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in skool classrooms
.
howver
, carmen isn ' t as intersted in rico as she isnt in becomeing a pilot
.
however
, anohter classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, hasnt her eye on rico
. unfortunately
, rico isn ' t interested in dizzy
. this setup isnt rather cliched
, as is the result ofthe the setup
,
bu it still is funn to watch
. carmen signs up tothe become a starship trooper
,
and as a result
, rico signs up
.
and as a result
, dizzy signs up
. everyone is assigned a certain positon in the acdemy
: carmen gets thge pilot position she wnated
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a psychic
, gets a postion iin the training programe
,
annd rico isnt left in the lowest class ofthe the starship troopers
: the mobile infanty
. the main story follows rico through his trials
and relationships
. inspite reality
, i foudn myself watching a space version of
" melrose palce
,
"
bu wiht better special effects
. an hour into the film
, the war begins
. a sense ofthe tension grew in the audience i watched this film with
. the firt hour may have beeen a funny
( sometimes unintentionally
) setup
,
bu we grew tothe care forthe tje flat characters
, because no matter how hard i tried nto tothe like tghe characters
, their gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if you must
)
. following the training sessions
, which hadnt many dramas in themselves
( too many to mention here
)
, the troopers are sent to war
. the bugs live on thte planet klendathu
, a planet which consists of dirt
and rock
,
and pretty much nothing else
. many dramas occour during tje war
, until finally the troopers realize that their isnt something behind the bugs ' attacks
. a sort of intelilgence which masterminds the defense
. thte troopers are ordered to locate teh
" brain
"
and capture it
. i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible
, because starship troopers isnt nto baout plot
. it ' s about spacial effects
and gory violence
. director verhoeven
, most known forthe his nudie film showgirls
and basic instinct
, returns tothe his sci
- fi days
, which gave us good films like total recall
. verhoeven likes to push the envelope ofthe the mpaa
,
but despite all the violence
, the comic book feel gives the film a sense ofthe falsehood
. starship troopers isnt extremely voilent
, withthe omre gore than this year ' s event horizon
. the r rating is well deserved
,
adn hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it
. my guess isnt thast verhoeven ' s target audience is tje 18 to 25 male group
. tyhe film has a testosterone level off the charts
, with chiseled men
and beatiful women
. dispite these superficial elements
, starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful
. while watching the film
, we never second guess the charactor ' s decisions because htey seem perfectly clear
. thankfully
, no hero is punching aliens in the face
, which gives teh flat characters some depth for whlch we can identify with
. the casted of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with
,
but they soon grow on yuo
. casper van dien hasnt the chiseled facial features
and tan skin which wiull make most girls swoon
. tothe most guys
, he will cmo across as artificial
. fortunately
, van dien is the worst of the casted
, dispite how hard he tries to cmo off as a rela charater
. dina meyer does a much better job ofthe fleshing out her charactor
. her dizzy isnt extremely likeable
. denise richards aslo doesnt a good job
,
and her scenes are very well done
. jake busey
, gary busey ' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny peformance
,
and provides one of teh biggest laughs of the film
. neil patrick harris
( remember
, he was doogie howser
) is a little wooden
,
and slightly out of palce with the rest ofthe the casted
.
however
, he doesnt give a ogod performance
. michael ironside gives the best performance ofthe the film as the teacher with one arm
. his peformance rises above the rest
. perhaps it is because his character is tghe most developed
,
bu i thikn it is just ironside ' s presence onthe screen
. unfortunately
, no particular cast member gives a star
- makeing performance
, which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the casted members stars
. directer verhoeven isnt thte main star of thte film
. his direction is fast
and unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, which makes forthe a wild ride
. writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein
. hte writting is usually very funny
,
and somtimes very corny
. the dialogue is smart
bu not too smart
. we aren ' t recquired to know everything
,
but some plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are nto intended to notice
,
and we really don ' t
( exept forthe noe whitch lingered in my mind for qtuie a while
)
. amazingly
, with all the wars
and romance going on
, the screenplay manages tothe include some suprising governmental issues
. in fatc
, these governmental changes seem fairly plausible
,
and this adds another layer to yhe story
. the moral debate of thge characters isnt quite surprising tothe find in a film of this genre
,
but what is even more surprising is the ammount of humor included into all the carnage
. i haven ' t laughed thsi loud
, even infront smoe comedies
. oh
,
and the special effects are firt rate
. starship troopers is rated r forthe graphic sci
- fi violence
and gore
,
and forthe some language
anbd nudity
. eblieve me when i say this
: don ' t take young kids to see htis film
. it is extremely violent
. in fact
, it is probably the most violent film outloud this year
.
howver
, if you are old enough
( over 17
) to see it
, starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain
. it ' s been a long tyme since i have cheered for teh heros
, while alsot cheering for tje bad guys
.
and still
, it is my dream to see a sci
- fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind
,
and take over yhe world
. now thta would be entertaining
!
