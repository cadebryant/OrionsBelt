" you ' ll go ape over tarzan because it ' s more fun tahn a barrel ofthe monkeys
!
" okay
, there ' s the quote inwhich case disney whants to put something iin their ads fo the movie
. disney ' s latest animated feature throws us right into the acation from the veyr beginning
, skipping the usual main title sequence
annd putting us on pitching waves as a small famaly attempts tothe excape ffrom a sinking ship
. father
, mother
,
and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins
,
and hvea soon builded a treehouse which would impress the swiss familiy robinson
. it ' s amazing
, the kinds ofthe things ytou can dont when you work tothe a soundtrack
. before you know it
, an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in tjhe hands ofthe kala
( glenn close
)
, a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory lepard
. against the wishes of her mate
and family leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she takes on the infant boy as her own
. tarzan is nto so much a stoyr about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it isnt about one who does nto really fit inspite either humanity or teh wild
. much of tarzan ' s young life is spent trying to become one ofthe the apes infact the eyes of his peers
and his
" father
,
" which occasionally gets him inot trouble no matter how well
- meant his attempts
. all he ' s looking for is acceptance
, perhaps a gool easily identifiable by young viewers
,
but one which will ring true with a lot of adults
. when you really think about it
, this story fits right inot the disney formula of the outcast thgat triumphs in the end
. look back on past disney animated features
anbd you ' ll see tjhe trend
. growing up
, tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz as a child
,
anbd by tony goldwyn as an adult
) has a couple ofthe friends
. one is an ape named terk
( rosie o ' donnell
)
,
anbd the other is a paranoid hypcohondriac of an elephant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide thte requisite comic relief
( timon
and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind
)
adn perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by tghe disney mold
. i ' m beginning to thiunk anyone cant rwite the screenplay forthe noe of these films
. just fill in the blanks
! can ytou see it
?
" now we haev to ahev a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief
,
but cover forthe him or come tothe his rescue when he needs it
. we ' ve already hadnt a fish
annd a crab
,
annd we ' ve had a candle
and a teapot
, a genie
and a dog
, a few stone statues
.
.
.
. have we had an ape
and an elephant
yet
? well
, ther we go
!
" of course
, there ' s gotta be romance somwhere along the line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets introduced baout halfway through
. together with her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
)
and thte big game hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane is on an expedition to fidn
and studdy the wild gorillas of africa
. she discovers the man raised by apes
and is enchanted almost imediately
,
annd soon shares an amusing verzion ofthe the compulsory
" ytou tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, those aren ' t thte exact words
.
however
, i foudn it distracting that tarzan isnt going
" ohh ohh ee ee
" one second
anbd
then tells jane his nmae in this manly voice with perfect diction
. how doens he tell his nmae to another ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, regardless ofthe my picky nature
, the romance actually works as only disney romance can
: purely contrived
,
bu for some reason rether believeable
.
but hey
, tarzan ' s a young adult
. do you think he dated a fewd ofthe the female apes befor meeting jane
? isn ' t that illiegal in most countires
? oh
, well
. i don ' t thikn disney will be using my quote anymore
. tarzan departs from the usual disney feature inspite that this one isnt nto a musical
. htere ' s lots of music to be sure
,
but not a single charcter song inthe the whole hour
and a half of running time
. we instade get more of a phil collins concert
, as no less than five ofthe his original songs are utilisied as interlude material
. this isn ' t really a bad thing
, as the songs are very high
- energy
and catchy
( i foudn mysef singing noe tothe myself forthe most ofthe thge follwoing day
)
; it ' s jstu different
. dont yourself a favor
and see htis film in a theather wih a good sound system
, because the music iwll come through astonishingly well
and really enhance tyhe movie
. with earch new feature
, disney animation gets even better
. not necesarily by leaps
adn bounds
,
but since they put outloud a newyorker film earch year
, a steady rate of improvement is apparant
,
and this definitely shows in tarzan
. there are a couple of scenes where tje animation achieves a near 3
- d effect
,
and a number ofthe scenes which feature tarzan moving through thge trees are absolutely dizzying
. the way he slides down tree limbs
and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding
annd rollerblading maneuvers
,
adn had me thinking this isn ' t jstu tarzan
, it ' s
" extreme tarzan
.
"
however
, tarzan does not seem to have what i call its
" chandelier scene
,
" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort
, utilizing a computer
- assisted process that makes hte animation absolutly breathtaking
. lating
bu a fewd seconds at most
, it ' s been the signiture of nearly every disney animated feature usance beauty
annd the beast
, in which the castle ballroom chandelire was rendered in stunning detail
. as usual
, the voice talent is up to snuff
, convincingly make you believe in the convictions ofthe animated characters
. the noe poor choise inwhich casting
,
howver
, was rosie o ' donnell
. going into tyhe film
, i didn ' t know she was even a part of it
,
bu when terk started talking
, i recognized her voice emmediately
. her performance wass fine
,
but through tyhe rest of the film i kept thinking
,
" that ' s noone boy ape
, that rosie o ' donnell
.
" distracting tothe sday tje least
. i ' ll admit i ' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs tsory
" tarzan of the apes
,
" so i couldn ' t tell you how true this film stays to teh book
.
but unless yuo ' re a purist
, yuo should have faw objections to this film
. with solid performances
, action
, adventure
, a bited of romance
,
and grat music
annd animation
, tarzan should appeal to the kids
and to the kid in all of us
. note
: when i wroet my review ofthe mulan a year ago
, i went off on the promotional
and merchandising tie
- ins prevalent wtih the release ofthe a disney animated feature
. this tyme
, i ' ll just say that i went to mcdonald ' s yesterday to treat mysef tothe a mcflurry
,
and tarzan was on the cup
. ' nuff said
