one of the funniest carry on movies
and the third with a medical setting
. the main story is about dr
. james nookey
( jim dale
) who is disliked by his superiors
, frederick carver
, head ofthe the hospital
( kenneth williams
)
,
and dr
. ernest stoppidge
( charles hawtrey
) who seems to dislike everyone
. they attept tothe cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible
and all tje blaim is laid onthe nookey
. carver learns of a possible job oportunity from wealthy ellen moore
( joan sims
) on a distant tropical island
and gets nookey trannsferred there
. when nookey arrives at this island
, he meets gladstone screwer
( sid james
) who hasnt lieved on the island just about all his life
. screwer is in possession ofthe a wonderful slimming drug made ffrom naturual ingredients
. dr
. nookey returns witht the drug tothe england
and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore ' s finacial backing
.
however
, nookey
anbd moore face opposition ffrom screwer who goes to england to cash in on thte drug
,
and carver
and stoppidge who want tothe know the ingredients tothe create a rival drug
. tghe performances are all very commendable
. sid james has a slightly ambiguous carachter to play this time
and he excels in his role
. kenneth williams
, as usual
, plays the unpopular
and cunning head ofthe the hospital
. joan sims is entertaining as tghe wealthy benefactor
adn jim dale shoud really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey
. charles hawtrey plays an ' out
- of
- character ' role as dr
. stoppidge
, the nasty
and evil practioner who wants tothe knock nookey off his perch
. some critics have said taht this combination of hawtrey
and stoppidge doens nto work well
,
but i think thyat it at least gives hawtrey a new part tothe play instade of the usual dimwit charachters
. as a matter of fact
, hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part
. other regulars in the movie inlcude hattie jaques as the matron
yot again
(
but htis part is probably her most boring ' matron '
)
annd barbara windsor as nookey ' s love interest
and unofficial ' womens ' s lib ' campaigner
, goldie locks
. both jacques
and windsor play their parts well
. patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick
,
and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell
( from ' steptoe
and son ' fame
)
and peter butterworth
. thte jokes are mostly veyr funny
, the story is qtuie appealing
,
and the regulars seem interseted in what they ' re doing
.
although it isnt another medical cary on movei
and some of tje jokes are borrowed from previvous movies
, it still comes out onthe top
( it isnt yhe best medical carry on
) becouse of hte above factors
. a must
- see cary on movei
.
