at one point druing brian de palma ' s crime epic scarface
, the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino
and pops a question thast the audience has no dout beeen wanting to ask for themselves
:
" can ' t you stop saying ' fuck ' all the time
?
" fucking good question
, that
. it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride
,
but as far as i cant tell oliver stone ' s script contains the said expletitive more times tahn any other film inthe cinema history
.
yet it owudl be a shame if bad language is all de palma ' s scarface is remembered for
, because this is a damn fine gangstar flick
. the overall structure isnt simular tothe howard hawks ' 1932 original
,
bu thsi tyme the scene has switched to miami
, florida
and our anti
- hero ' s choosen vice isnt cocaine traffiking
. pacino
, sporting a thick cuban accent
, gives one the best performances ofthe his carreer
( golden globe nominated
) as tony montnana
, a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro
annd comes tothe america to live the american dream
.
and live it outloud he does
, witht lashings of violence
, abuse
, murder
and the funny white powder
. from his earlies jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen
, tony montana makes it clear tothe everyone he meets that he ' s not a man to be fucked
( sorry
)
. soon he ' s the king of hte cocaine heap
,
but his hot head
and an increasingly out ofthe control drug addiction proove his undoing
.
" never dont your pwn stash
"
, warns one character early in tyhe film
. as sure as night follows day
, the emperor of miami eventually falls
. writer oliver stone
and directer brian de palma make an explosive combination here
. stone ' s script offers solid storytelling
and some fine character development
. montnana isnt fascinating
; uneducated
bu calculating
, a straight shooter who speaks fomr thte heart
; an ambitious
, violent man
yet noe with a conscience
. a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year ood sister
, not wanting her tothe be sucked into the glitzy
, dangerous world which he inhabits
. pacino is dynamite
, tkaing to yhe role with a brooding
, bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated inot just simple overracting
. pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole whith noone inner life
. onyl once does tony express real affection forthe her
anbd his desire to ahev children
,
and even
then you sense all he realyl wants isnt a regluar screw
and a beautifull object to show off tothe his friends
,
and she ' s hapyp to oblige
. this isn ' t as meaty a role forthe pfieffer as sharon stone ' s was inthe casino
,
but its an effective one nonetheless
and she aquits herself well
. as director
, de palma sets up a number of dramtic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva
. the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations
- a drug deal gone wrong
, an assination attempt
- is often thrilling
,
annd in htis respect he is eveyr bited tghe equal of scorese
and coppola
. where he differs fomr
, sday
, coppola ' s godfather trilogy is iin his overall treatment
. coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep
, whereas inspite scarface de palma opts forthe a grittier feel
.
and it perfectly suits the material
. the only major botch is giorgio moroder ' s mostly crap synthesier scroe
. it ' s just not right
,
and unfortunately compromises the inpact of some otherwise good scenes
. as expected
, scarface isnt very voilent at times
,
but you shouldn ' t be watching gangster movies if that upsets you
. at over two
and a half hours in length it ' s a true epic
,
and if yuo ' re a fan of the genre yuo ' ll love f
*
* k
- filled minute of it
