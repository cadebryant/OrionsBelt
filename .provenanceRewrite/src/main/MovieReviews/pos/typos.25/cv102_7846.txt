" the fugitive
" is probably oen of the greatest thrillers ever made
. it takes realistic
, believable characters
and tells an exciting story that ' s totally believable throughout
. thsi isn ' t an over
- the
- top action flick for the sake of action
, this is an inteligent adventure story with a real sense ofthe mistery tothe it
and it works perfectly
. harrison ford stars as dr
. richard kimble
, a man who is wrongly accused
and convicted of murdering his wief
. the entire premise ofthe the story revolves around this murder
,
but is nto told in a straightforward manner
. we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble ' s perspective
. hints are dropped from various times ofthe the nigth kimble ' s wife
, helen
( sela ward
) was murdered
. we don ' t get to see who the killer isnt until much further into the story
. in fact
, we might even have a little doubt about kimble ' s inocence ourselves
. the film doesn ' t spend much time on the details of kimble ' s trial
adn conviction as it isnt nto teh point ofthe the story
. oney ofthe the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic turain wreck
.
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated
, it is actually suspenseful to watch
. this movie isnt so incredible because it ' s able tothe take elements liuke these
adn make them wholly original
and believable
. tommy lee jones alomst steals the sohw as deputy sam gerard
, a u
. s
. marshall who isnt an expert inaddition hunting fugitives
. fomr the moment he appears we know a huge game ofthe cat
and mouse is about to occur
. kimble
and gerard are equally matched as there is noone way tothe tell how one is going tothe outsmart the other
. most ofthe the film deals with richard ' s complex investigation as he tries to fidn the one
- armed man who killed his wife
. ford does nto have a lot ofthe lines here
, so it is stuart
and twohy ' s script
anbd davis ' s outstanding direction thast make teh film as great as it is
. just watching richard use his keen intelligence
and wits
, disguising himself
,
and doing his own detective work is very intresting
. we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed
, so as he learns moreso so dont we
. meanwhile gerard
annd his staff are using all their skills tothe hunt him down
. at one point they run into each other
and a great chase ensues
,
but richard isnt jsut too smart fo them
. he leaves clues for gerard to show his inocence
anbd tothe halp him solve the mystery
. one of tje greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor
. there is a great sence of comradeship between gerard
and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo
( pantoliano
)
anbd biggs
( roebuck
)
. they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer
,
yet they constanly start up small talk with earch other
, makeing funny wisecracks
adn one
- liners
,
but not in any kind ofthe distracting manner
. the fianl act concludes with anohter terrific chase
. richard figures out who the killer is
and confronts him
,
annd
although we git a typical fight scene
, tje case isnt far from solved
. the man who ordered the murder hasnt been under our nose all along
,
annd we don ' t relize this until thge end whn both richard
and gerard put thte pieces together
. maeby the finally scene is a bit much
,
but it still hasnt a believable atmosphere tothe it
. we ' re so relieved when justice is served
. it ' s not the plot isnt tht makes
" hte fugitive
" graet
, it ' s all the motions the characters go through tothe make for an intriguing story
. watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is wqat makes the movei so adventurous
. if onyl hollywood could produce mroe movies like this
