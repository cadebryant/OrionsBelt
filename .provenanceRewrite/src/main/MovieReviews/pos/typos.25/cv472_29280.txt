and dogma
. so
, be advisd
: bone uv on that cinematic quartet in order to acheeve the maximum enjoyment from smith ' s latest outing

( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( smith
) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax ' s prodcution ofthe bluntman
and chronic
, comic book characters based on the twpo jersey slackers
. jay ' s convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down
, people on the internet will stop insulting him
and bob
, even
though it is nto him
annd bob the people are dissing
,
but rather their comic book counterparts
. no matter

.
bu first they get smoe tips from a veteran hitchhiker
, played by george carlin
, who tells them to follow

- the rules ofthe tje road
. of course jay ' s interpretation immediately gets tyhe duo inwhich trouble witht a freindly nun
( carrie fisher
) who offers them a ride
. jay
and silent bob contains enought laughs tyhat tghe movei ' s weaker aspects
- wich include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell
- can be easily tolerated
. realy
, how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van
,
and jay has a pot
- induced hallucination concerning velma
adn daphne
. the movie ' s highlight

- in
- cheek
. their fun comes through the screen to the audience
. it is too bad that this is jay
