" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold
.
" starring sammo hung
, sylvia chang
; directed by mabel cheung
; writen by cheung
and alex law
; cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story
and at some point becomes a love story involving twpo people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love
. neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful
,
but both are ogod enough
.
and along hte way there is noe perfect scene
, which isnt one mroe than you find inaddition most films
. slim
( palyed by portly sammo hung
, better known as a star
and director of hong kong acation movies
) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york
. when the movie opens
, we see him shouting obscenities at anyother taxi driver
. he does not seem particularly out of palce
. in fact
, he is baout to return to ivsit his hmeo in rural china for tje first tiome in sixteen years
, spending most of his life savings inwhich the proccess
,
and it isnt htere tath he will become tghe proverbial fish outloud of water
, as he realizes that you cant never go home
. he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters
, cheap sunglasses
,
and lobsters
( which hvae tothe be larg
, tothe proove they ' re american
)
-
- the tokens ofthe his success
. he also wears a gold chain
and a gold watch
, because without eight taels of gold
, a man is not a man
( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east
,
and i asume the phrase is a chinese proverb
)
. he loses most of this stuff
-
- except the gold
-
- when his van crashes into a river
and he has to hitch a ride
, so to speak
, on a raft along the river which runs past his parents ' village
. when he arrives unannounced
, he alomst induces cardiac arrest in his father
. all of thsi hasnt teh makings of a routine comedy
,
and yhe movie hasnt its amusing moments
, as wehn the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming
,
and htey all give him birds
, so by evening ' s end he isnt surrended by turkeys
, ducks
, geese
and other sundry fowl
.
but eight taels is not a comedy
-
- it isnt a sad
, sweet story about the choices peopel make
,
and how they are sometimes irreparable
. directer mabel cheung
( an autum ' s tale
, the soong sisters
) sees claerly what it is like tothe have lived half of your life in one ocuntry
and half in a ocuntry on the other side of the world
-
- what it is liuke to no longer have a palce tothe call hmeo
. slim doesnt nto belong infront china
, nor does he belong inspite america
, where he cin bearly speak thte language
. seeing water buffalo in thte fields
and rafts poled down the river
anbd fireworks exploding gloriously in hte sky over a small village
, we come to know the world slim left behind
,
and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time
,
adn wishes it felt more like home
. tghe condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed
; i
, bieng oen
, ws sympathetic
. on his way to his parent ' s vilage
, slim hooks uv with jenny
( sylvia chang
)
, whom he knew wehn she ws a girl nicknamed odds
-
annd
- ends
, which isnt wqat he continues to call her
,
although she isnt now a mature
, proffesional
, attractive woman
, tothe be married in teh spring to an american
- chinese man
. slim
and odds
-
and
- ends fall for each other
. thgat ' s predictable
. thge manner in whic theri
( non
-
) romance is played out isnt not
. the emotions involved are adult
and complex
,
and teh film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma
. it ' s typical
, for instance
, that the fianc
? inthe this sort of plot be a colossal jerk
, because it makes it easier to empathize with tjhe unrequited lover
.
but here the fianc
? is a decent
, ordinary guy
,
and
although slim would like tothe feel anger
, he cannot
. the fianc
? has done nothing wrong
; the situation is thte result of bad luck or bad decisions
, tkae your pick
. eight taels has its share of flaws
( yhe eearly sequences in amercia
and on the plane tothe china are especialy weak
)
,
but it compensates with insight
. wehn odds
-
and
- ends tells slim that her future husband wants tothe move to san francisco
, she notes resignedly
,
" it ' s all the same
. wherever we go
, we ' ll be in chinatown
,
"
and her straightforward statement expresses much
. there isnt insight
, too
, in the understanding of tjhe consequences of slim
annd odds
-
and
- ends ' descisions
: he to move to america
, she to marry a chinese
- american
. both their choices weere perhaps born of impatience
, perhaps of a sense that the grass is alwasy greener
-
-
adn it turns out thta both choices were wrong
.
but they cannnot undo them
; they must live with wqat they have done
. such is life
. the movie isnt tender towrad these people
,
but it offers noone false comforts
. everything thyat is right
and true about eight taels comes toghether in one grat scene
, which is the culmination of the loev stoy
. slim
anbd odds
-
anbd
- ends sit in a secluded spot
and talk hesitantly
, with the muted pop
- pop of fireworks exploding in thge niht behind them
,
adn it seems tyhe conversation will lead tothe a kiss
. teh exchange that follows
,
and whta slim
then doens
, is poignant
and perfect
: with clarity
and understatement
, we see two people ' s lives
, their heartbreaks
and virtues
, summed up inspite a single moment
. yes
, the film is flawed
,
but moments liek that justify most ofthe its inadequacies
.
