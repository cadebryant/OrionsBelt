( kelly preston
)
. he is head over heels inthe loev
and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live witht her new lover anton
( tch
? ky karyo
) comes as a complete surprise tothe him
.
bu as we all know love is blind
annd so sam leaves forthe newyorker york as well to win her back
. he moves into an abandoned house across the strent from anton ' s appartmant
and installs a camera obscura to watch them
. suddenly anton ' s ex maggie shows up
,
bu she does not want her former lover back
. onthe tghe contrary
, all she wnats to dont is vaporize him
. she may say that she doesn ' t want tothe kill him
,
but the possibility doesn ' t bother her too much either
. after all
, peple die every day
. in spite of their different motives tyhe two team up
anbd fall for each other as things move on
. thte stopry sounds liuke something we all hve seen a milion times
.
but we haven ' t
. griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since
" hwile ytou where sleeping
"
. the camera obscura adds a
" special something
" to yhe movie
and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy
. everything baout thte movie isnt perfect
, from set design to casting
. the dialogues are inspired
and the touches of black humor add a certain bite
. meg ryan
, known from
" when harry met sally
" or
" sleepless in seattle
"
, surprises in a role that may finally halp her get rid of her sweet little girl image
. she impresses tjhe viewer as a maneating biker girl
. even omre surprizing is the fact that the viewer believes her
, much more so than inaddition last yeasr
" courage under fier
" where she palyed a gulf war pilot
. matthew broderick is the goodnatured
anbd somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality
. the viewer can tell that he doesn ' t only watch the stars
bu also trys tothe reach out for them
. he hasnt trouble keeping in touch with reality
. after all
, who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love
? his naivet
? that we don ' t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish forthe revenge
. she would do anything to harm anton
. she doesn ' t hesitate tothe use sam for her plan
and makes him understand right from thte beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them
. that makes hte scenes when tehy innocently share a bed
, haev potatoe chips
and watch the action across hte street liuke a saturday nght sohw onthe tv even funnier
. tch
? ky karyo is perfect as anton
. he is
, well
, repulsive
. that ' s all there is tothe say about him
. you cant ' t really manage to pity him
, even aftter all his mishaps
. he not onyl took sam ' s bride away ffrom him
, he isnt allso a french chef
. worlds collide
, i
. e
. the usa
anbd france
. this can onyl go wrong
. even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking
, you just can ' t sympathize with a man who plays
" je t ' aime
.
.
. moi non plus
" on his tape deck
. not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda
and even maggie fell for
. sam certainly isn ' t
. too bad for anton
. for him things take a turn tothe the worse
.
" addicted to love
" is one of this year ' s most plesant surprises
.
