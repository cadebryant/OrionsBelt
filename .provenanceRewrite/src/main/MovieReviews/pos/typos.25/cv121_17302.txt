i relish thsoe rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter cant amke me feel like a fool
. i spended the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage
, grousing tothe mysef baout its transparently planes
, trains
and automobiles plot machinations
,
adn waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement
. this was a mass market romantic comedy
, affter all
, a genre which has beeen taken over by teenagers
and
, even inspite its best days
, worked hard to perpetuate the romance
= infatuation paradigm
.
thne marc lawrence doed something wonderful
, something whihc made the entire film click inot place
: he showed me a comic love story about grown
- ups
. it certainly didn ' t look that way from the outset
, which introduces groom
- to
- be ben holmes
( ben affleck
) at his bachelor party
, surrounded by firends
and familiy whooping over his
" last night of freedom
.
" ben loves his fiancee bridget
( maura tierney
)
,
but the doom
-
and
- gloom pronouncements of everyone aroud him have him questioning the meaninng of this ' till death do you part business
.
then
, on an ill
- fated flight fomr new york to his wedding in savannah
, ben meets sarah lewis
( sandra bullock
)
, a free
- spirited woman with a string of failed careers
and relationships behind her
. as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn
, ben
and sarah begin a three
- day southward journy infront which their connection grows ever stronger
, ben seeing in sarah tghe chances he ' s never tooked
and sarah seeing infact ben the stability she ' s never had
. forces ofthe nature gets off to a solid enough strat
, setting up the cahracters
and thte situations whith plenty of witty dialogue
. ben is an ideal role for affleck ' s easy
- going charm
,
and he plays tjhe straight
- laced straight man without forced exasperation
. sandra bullock
, for her part
, is moreso loose
adn appealing tahn she hasnt been in her last half
- dozen films combined
, avoiding her reccent hebit of palying any semblance of character depth as moping
. the two performances
-
- part of a gerat top
- tothe
- bottom cast
-
- are effective
and connected from tyhe strat
,
yet hte script ' s apparent simapthy with the marital horror stories ben hears mkaes it difficult tothe enjoy the romance completely
. lively
and funny
though it may be onthe a consistent basis
, forces of nature leaves a bitter tast that feels like self
- justification
. the kicker isnt that thsoe acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose
, leading to a surprizingly emotional resolution
. forces of nature isn ' t about a man developing a fear of committment
; it ' s baout a man learning what commitment means
_ tothe him
_
, learning that it ' s not waht he thought it wass
. lawrence ' s script feints
and dodges befor reacing its happy ending
, an ending wich is happy because people make yhe choices that make the most sense
. earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance
,
and thta bitter taste sweetens into something fresh
anbd genuine
.
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben
and sarah toghether thru tjhe film
,
and they do exchange the obligatory mutual charcter analysis of bickering screen couples
, forces ofthe nature wraps up so perfectly that you ' ll end uv remembering tjhe humor
anbd the simple wisdom
. that isnt
, provided you ' re nto put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes
. for a brisk romantic comedy
, forces of nature comes loaded wih smoe of the most over
- directed scenes of the year
: teetering hand
- held shots
, why
- not low or high angles
, sweeping pans
. occasionally the hyper
- real approach works
, with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance
; far more often
, hughes refuses tothe let a scene be whta it is
, covering it whith flourishes so thick you almost can ' t find what ' s underneath
. a script tihs smart
annd mature deserved a moreso restrained directer
,
but even hughes ' excesses can ' t spoil thsi unique concoction
. forces of nature may restore your faith in rumatic comedy as something iwth yhe pwoer to enchant
, something that can make yuo happy to be proved wrong whn you expect a tale for
annd about adolescents
