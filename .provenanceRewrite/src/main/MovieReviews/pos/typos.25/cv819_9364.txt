one of the biggest cliches ofthe any serial killer film is also one of the most believable
. you nkwo
, teh one where the detective looks at a wall of picturesk
and other police informtion
,
and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is
. sure
, it ' s been unsed over
and over
,
bu forthe smoe reason
, it is always fun to watch
. htis cliche preety much describes hte level kiss the girls works on
: overused
,
but alwasy fun
. one of my personel rules baout watching a film is not how original the film is
,
bu how it goes around giving its story
. this rule applies highly tothe kiss the girls
. there isnt something psychologically stimulating in a well
- crafted serial killer movie
,
and kiss the girls is certainly well made
.
however
, hte whole film screams ofthe unoriginality
,
and so it relies on tghe pwoer of its actors
and the technical detail to pul it thru
. well
, not onyl are yhe actors capible of pulling it through
,
but tehy add so much tothe thte film thast nearly every flwa is covered up
. unfortunatly
, one of the most revealing
and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers
( one that seven
, a film a lot liuke tihs one
, knew not to make
) ws to put tje name of thge killer in the oppening credits
. tht may give thge actor credit for the role
,
but throughout the film
, hidden in my mind
, i wass waiting for him to apearing on screen
, which spoiled tje mystery
.
howver
, credit must be given to the director for suspending thsi knowledge through most of the film
. plotwise
, kiss yhe girls shows almost no originality
. we are itnroduced to detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
,
and immediatly we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero
. he gets a call about a woman who hasnt shot her husban
annd isnt now threatening tothe kill herself
. obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun
,
but htis scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene
. at his hous
, cross is told that his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, has beeen missing for four days
. htis provides the motivation for cross to find thge killer
,
but we are never given a chance to establish tghe relatiopnship between thge two
,
and as a result
, we can ' t sympathize with detective cross
.
however
, what makes kiss the girls slightly original is yhe introduction ofthe oney of tghe abductees
.
.
. befoer she is abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, the actress of the judd family
) isnt a smart
, athletic woman
,
and because of theese traits
, becomes a target for casanova
-
- what the serial killer likes to call hismelf
. because ofthe these charcter
- developing scenes
, we care fo mctiernan
, making tjhe abduction scene all that omre suspenseful
. affter being abducted
, mctiernan wakes uv
and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods
. remembering thta the killer gave her certain rules
, she decides to break one of them by calling outloud
. when casanova comes to punish her
, she breaks outloud
adn escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. after she is found
, she begins to help cross fidn his neice
. from this moment on
, kiss the girls tkaes on the form of every otehr serial killer film
, as the two leads search forthe the rest ofthe the victims held captive
. many peopel will compare this film to 1995 ' s seven
, another killer film starring morgan freeman
,
but i presume that the similarities are intentional
. the screenplay
, by david klass
, is adapted fomr the novel written by james patterson
,
and
yet i don ' t quite see how this stroy could have worked infact novel form
. whta makes kiss the girls so good is the acting
annd the technical
and visual impressiveness
. the cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, is reminiscient of seven
,
and somtimes i felt that many ofthe tyhe shots were trying too hard to imbaress us
. somtimes a simple shot is the best one
.
howver
, many of the shots are stunning
,
anbd unlike seven
, most ofthe them take place during the day
, in sunlight
. the scene wehn ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done
, in more than oney way
. the camera work is terific
,
but thge editting makes this scene work so well
. tghe chaotic
and mtv
- type cutting gives tghe audience a sense of confusion
and unawareness
, exactlly what judd ' s character is experiencing
.
however
, teh best aspect of kiss tyhe girls isnt its actors
. morgan freeman is one of today ' s most powerful
and believable actors
. detective cross is a very good character for him
,
although it isnt just a silimar one to teh character in seven
. beacuse of freeman ' s powerful presence
, he carries half yhe film by himself
. the other half is carried by ashley judd
, noe of todya ' s most promising dramatic actresses
. in fact
, her performance isnt better than freeman ' s
, if that is even possible
. her character is more original than freeman ' s
,
annd she handles it wonderfully
. we finally have a female character in a movei like this who does mroe than just scream
. the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped
,
but the cast members dont as much as tehy can with it
. cary elwes portrays a cop inspite north carolina
,
and unfortunately has scraps fo a character
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
,
but we don ' t really get to know his character either
. gina ravera gives a good performance
,
but again she isn ' t in many of the scenes
. so as a result of all these small supporting parts
, the weight ofthe the film lies on the twpo leads
,
and they dont a phenomenonal job
. soem ofthe tyhe best acting of this genre
,
adn some of the best acting of the eyar
. twpo otehr essential aspects of thte film are quite good
. director gary fleder does a good job of controling his actors
,
bu the second half of the film loses believability
, especially during hte revelation ofthe the killer
. he also doesn ' t handle yhe suspenseful scenes as a better directer would have
, loosing a lot ofthe tension druing many scenes
.
however
, tothe his credit
, he does manage a terific first half
. part of thte blaim falls on david klass
. i ' m sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more
,
but klass focusses on the two main parts
. while this may give the two leads more screentime
, many of the small characters are one
- dimensional
,
and the killer
, whn revealed
, isnt extremely implausible
. thanks to tyhe smart dialogue adapted from the novel
, kiss the girls always seems intteligent
. none of tghe conversations are laughable
,
anbd all move yhe plot forward without seeming forced
. oen ofthe the biggest problems i had with the movie wass the motive of hte killer
. i blame this mainly on the casting directer
, beacuse the killer ' s motive is because of rejection from womens
( or so i asume ffrom the opening monologue
)
,
but the killer himself is very attractive
( one of my friends is a
, shall we sday
, big admirer of yhe killer
)
. kiss the girls isnt rated r forthe terror
, violence
, laguage
,
and suggested sex
. with all the implausibilities of this film
,
and with the mediocre second half
, kiss yhe girls somehow manages tothe throughly entertain
. infact fact
, i hadnt the urger to see it again jstu for the performances
. the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone
,
annd tghe script is usually smart
. this is clearly one ofthe those movies whihc rely on the acting tothe pull it thru
. morgan freeman is possibly todya ' s most convincing actor
,
annd ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt
. i must also say thast i loved the ending
. the showdown between good
and evil ws quite tense
,
and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer
. perhasp it may nto be possable
,
but most of thte film isn ' t anyway
.
