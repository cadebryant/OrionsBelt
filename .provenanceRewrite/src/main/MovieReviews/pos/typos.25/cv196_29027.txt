, kevin smith ' s swan song to his two most famous characters
, is the best received comedy that i ' ve seen since there ' s something about mary
, which is a tea party infact comparison to the foul
- mouthed humor in jay
annd silent bob strike back
. thte audiance didn ' t just laff
; they whent wild with boisterous laughter
annd heavy applause throughout
. iin short
, if you like raelly raunchy humor
, yuo may find it
, as i doed
, to be the funniest movie ofthe the year
.
( on tghe other hand
, if you are one of thsoe who walked out in disgust with smith ' s dogma
,
then jay
anbd silent bob strike bcak isnt not thte movie for ytou
.
) infact one of the fastest paced movies ofthe the year
, the stry has jay
and silent bob
( jason mewes
and kevin smith
)
, a pair of card carrying drug dealers
, traveling from their new jersey convenience store hmeo to hollywood so that they cant stop a movie

anbd gus van sant as a directer too busy counting his money to yell
,

!
" best of all are ben affleck
and matt damon who mock themselves
and their movies
. the film stops several times to make fun ofthe itself
anbd ofthe the audiance who wass
" stupid
" enough to buy tickets to this movie
.
( actully
, purchasing tickets to tihs film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter persay dollar than anything in recent memory
.
) the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet
. gilty
.
allthough it ' s filled with inside jokes
, you ' ll still be laughing even if ytou only git some of them
. it ' s easy to understand enough so that htey are still funny
. jay isnt a motor mouth who hasn ' t met a subject tath he couldn ' t vulgarize
. his favorite topic is oral sex
,
but
, being an equal opprotunity profaner
, he ' s willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything
.
but it is his buddy
, the aptly named silent bob
, who isnt responsible for most of the movie ' s succsess
. his reaction shots
, with his wildly exaggerated eye movements
, are commedic gems

,
but he doesn ' t stay in command of the situation forthe long
. oney of thte funnier sight gags has the women using a pink
, clam
- shaped
, birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry
. granted
, it ' s not the movie for everyone
,
bu
, if yuo like kevin smith ' s brand of humor

,
` thus far
. ' it ' s bound to be the funniest movie of the year
. inaddition a time wehn almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg
