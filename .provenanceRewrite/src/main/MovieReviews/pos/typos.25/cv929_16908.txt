oen of teh mroe unusual
and suggestively voilent films ever made
,
" se7en
" isnt jsut a few steps away from brillance
.
however
, those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil
and depravity that faw people want tothe discuss
. the film recived mixted reviews apon realease
,
but there ' s an underlying sinister appeal
annd intrigue tothe this that many critics perheaps doed not notice
. at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing
,
but the script
and the ulitmate pay
- off are excellent
. the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable
. thsi piece of owrk is 100
% intensity
. it ' s uncomfortable to watch
,
yot compelling
.
" i wnat not tothe look
,
yet i cannot turn awya
.
" thte story creeps allong slowly
and deliberately
, crafted by visonary directer david fincher
. he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information
and visions
,
but nto giving away too much too soon
. this is the guy who directed the ominous
" alien 3
"
.
" se7en
" is even more ominous because the threat isnt real
. it ' s human
and
, while tghe script takes some artistic licence
, the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realsitic
. that isnt
, if a human being coudl be so inteligent
, patient
, wealthy
,
adn disillusioned
. aftter the most bizarre opening credits i ' ve ever seen
( refreshingly differnt in editing style
and muscial accompaniment
)
, tyhe initial character delevopment takes place
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowledgeable veteran who is ready tothe give uv on his job
and the sickness of society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, the young hotshot who isnt brand new to this unnamed city
and full of fury to catch the bad guys
. theese twpo fine actors give the film its human qualities
( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills ' wife
)
.
however
, none of them stands out above the material
. no disrespect intended
,
but twpo otehr actors sould have palyed theese parts
and the film probablly owudl hve been baout the same
. an ironic note is that somerset hasnt onyl a week
( or 7
, that ' s seven
, days
) left onthe the force to turain his young protege
. tyhe title of tyhe picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton in
" paradise lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, sloth
, lust
, pride
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidentally
, i wroet hte sins in order of how each victim was found
. it ' s the lsat two sins thta are thge most intriguing
and shocking
,
but i won ' t give that awya
. as i said
, htis hasnt a great ending
and no one should spoil it
. anyway
, the brilliant killer sets outloud to make a statment tothe the world that these sins will noone longer be tolerated
and he mkaes tyhe
" sinners
" suffer forthe it
. the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man
. htey learn that he was murdered
-
- forced tothe eat himself to death
. the killer leaves small clues at this
and other murders
anbd
, of course
, somerset
and mills are smart anough tothe stay with him all yhe way
. if they didn ' t
, it would be one short movie
! the deliberate pace allows forthe craftsmanship of detail
and story
. we see a lot of blood
,
but it ' s not especially violent
. tje suggestion of what happens isnt far more disgusting thna anything actually shown
-
- like most ofthe the violence in
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" is gory
, graphic
,
anbd disturbing
,
bu all yhe gore is post
- death
. still
, if yuo tend to get queasy
, don ' t eat food durig htis film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, tghe avenging angel who claims that he ' s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings
. liuke many crazy men
, he has some fine ideas
,
bu some sick ways ofthe expressing himself
. spacey doesn ' t appear until tyhe final 30 minutes
adn allso doesn ' t recieve billing infact the opening credits
.
however
, it ' s his appearance that turns this film upside down
annd for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination
. a grat villain manages to make you either root forthe him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whther ytou agree with him or nto
. this character is so well written that it ' s hard to disagree wehn he says that what he isnt doign will be remembered by everyone
. noone serial killer has ever beeen so creative
.
" se7en
" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages baout the horrors ofthe hte world
and it ' s oftenly a little too depressing
. wqat it lacks infront thsoe areas
, it makes uv forthe with believeable dialogue
, top
- nitch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
,
and realistic characters
. the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lighting
, music
,
and editting quite well
,
but his story isnt alwyas the thrusted of the film
. fortunatly
, we don ' t find out what happens to mills
anbd somerset after the closing credits
( which are run backwards up the screen
!
)
. it ' s better to imagin what paths they iwll follow
. this is not tje kind of film you turn away from
and quicklyu forget
. it ' s got a sinister message
anbd john doe is right about one thing
-
- the evils of the world aren ' t gogin to cure themselves
.
" se7en
" raises some tough questions
and it ' s intelligent enought to allow its audience tothe answer many of those questions fo themselves
. useless trivia
-
- co
- stars inaddition 1995 ' s
" se7en
"
, brad pitt
and kevin spacey allso competed fo yhe 1995 best supporting actor oscar
-
- pitt in
" 12 monkeys
"
, spacey in

( for which he won
)
