there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have
,
but they chose not tothe tkae advantage ofthe this for some personal reason
.
" ogod iwll hunting
" is baout one of thsoe people
. teh iwll hunting of tyhe
( horrable
) title
( let ' s face it
, this film would be a bitch tothe title
)
, played by co
- writter matt damon
, is a mathematical genius
. he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it tkaes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino
.
and he works at mit
.
.
. as thte janitor
. oney day
, the professor of one of teh most challenging courses
, proffessor lambeau
(
" breaking the waves
" ' s stellan skarsg
? rd
)
, puts a big problem onthe the board fo his students tothe attempt to complete
. the next day
, it ' s already done on the board
,
but noone one in his clas claims to hve done it
. so lambeau puts another problem on yhe board
, this tiem oney thyat took he
and his colleagues over two years to prove
.
and
, duh
, it ' s done again
. of course
, they catch the guy who did it red handed
- will
. before lambeau can fidn will again
( he ran away when he caught him
)
, wiull has gotten inot a fight with a bunch ofthe punks onthe a basketball cout
,
and struck a polical officer
, so lambeau gets him out on probation withthe twpo agreements
: a
) he work withthe him on math
,
and b
) he get some therapy
. aftter going thru some therapists whom he psyches out inaddition one way or another
( for a hypnotist
, he fakes being under his sepll
,
then launches inot an impromptu performance ofthe the 70s classic
,
" afternoon delight
"
)
. finally
, lambeau ' s old college roomate
, sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, a psych professor
, agrees to treat him
,
and the two beign a rocky relationship
, as sean tries to git will to open uv
. turns outloud iwll had a rough childhood
, being abandoned
,
and placed in foster homes
and what not
. it also turns out tyhat will does not want tothe dont simple mathematics all his life
; he wants a challenge
.
and that is to hang out iwth his buds
( including the other co
- writer
, ben affleck
)
,
adn do honorable jobs
, like consttruction
. is it right tothe make this genuis follow in the footsteps of einstein
annd kasinsky
? should this guy be forced to do something he doesn ' t watn to do
? this appears to be oney of the million questions in this film
, whitch is jam
- packed with greatness
,
but does nto have the totally briliant whole it should
. i ' m not saying
" ogod will hunting
" is a bad film at all
. it ' s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments
,
and lots of great things about it
. the acting is amazing
, wiht twpo oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances from damon
and williams
, who hvae amazing chemistry together
. we alsot get some great support from stellan skarsg
? rd
( great name
)
, ben affleck
,
and from minnie driver
, who plays will ' s lvoe interest
, skylar
. there are tons of individual moments thast i adored
. i loved all thge comedy in the film
, especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who isnt quoting a historian to impress some chicks
, his various attempts at therapy
,
and of course
, my favorite scene inspite thge entire film
, hte one where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant to some nsa agents baout teh downside of working for them
. i liked the relationship between some of the people
, like will
and skylar
, wiull
and sean
, sean
adn lambeau
,
and will
and his firends
. there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch
.
and there are even moments inwhich the film which are so honest inthe theri portrayal
, that i felt rightfully uncomfortable
. like the break
- up scene beetwen will
and skylar
, will
and sean ' s first meeting
, a bar scene betwen sean
and lambeau
,
and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn ' t regret meeting his first wife
, who woudl later suffer a slow
, painful death
,
and leave him lonely
and slightly bitter
.
howver
, the main flaw of yhe film is there ' s too much ofthe everything
,
and not enough of it either
. tyhe film tries for deeper relations vetween the characters
,
but tehy ' re somtimes either overwritten or underwritten
. take for example teh relationship vetween sean
anbd wiull
: the film gets an interesting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relationship going with out any problems
,
but wehn it tries tothe show them as equals
, it falls onthe its face
. we hear how tehy went to the smae town
,
and htere are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times
.
but this never takes off liek hte other parts ofthe their relatiopnship do
. also
, will ' s relatiopnship with his best friend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, has a nice climax
,
bu not enough rising action
. we see them joking aroud
,
but when chuckie arrives at a desision between the two of them
, it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one
. their relationship never goes beyond
" just best friends
,
"
and his decision jsut seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instade of something mroe
.
.
. human
. maybe it ws just me
.
and it allso goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean
and lambeau
,
but that
, agina
, is underwritten
.
adn
, of course
, as in most films like this
, the girl
/ boy relationship is pretty underwritten
. we never understand what tehy see in earch other
, so wehn skylar confesses tyhat she loves him
, it seems more like it ' s there for plot details that anytying alse
. minnie driver is interesting
,
though
,
and breathes life into her charactor
. the writting is a bited at fault here
,
but what makes all this worthwhile isnt the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it feels overstuffed
,
but it ' s extremely enjoyable
. the dialogue tath affleck
annd damon ahve written is amazingly fresh
,
anbd seems extremely human
. i thiunk that htey should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue
, which is amazing
. while this isnt probablly directer gus van sant ' s most conservative film
( you ' d hardly know it ' s the same director ofthe
" to die fo
,
" the only van sant film i ' ve seen
, raelly
)
, it ' s still a preety remarkable film
, albeit a tad overrated
( waht ' s this
" best picture
" deel
?
)
.
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws
, i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone
.
