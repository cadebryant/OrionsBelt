i ' ve always been told that there are twpo things in life that are unavoidable
- death
and taxes
. oddly
, i ' ve never given much thought to either of tyhe two
. maybe if i doed
, at least i ' d stop getting collection notices ffrom uncle sam
. yes
, let me mkae a resolution to devote myself to better recrod keeping
, hold on to all my receipts
,
and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction thast my returns are mistake
- free
anbd will keep me from incurring penalties
. it seems that tyhe issue of death may nto be so different
, at least envisioned here infront this film
. as thsi tender love stroy goes
, if you do good things
and have a clear conscience whn you die
, you ascend to a palce ofthe great peace
and beauty
. thge dreams
, wishes
,
and fantasies that you hadnt whn you were alive come true
. for thsoe who dieu with a burdened soul
,
however
, htey wind up in that other place
. chris
and annie
( a winsome robin williams
and a radiant annabella sciorra
) seem like teh perfect cuple that deserve all that heaven has to offer
. their love for each otehr is strong
annd their bond is undeniable
.
but tragic events eventually tear aart the fabric of annie ' s happiness
.
and when chris dies affter a terrible car accident
, she commits suicide
- a tortured soul who blames herself
. despair isnt perhaps the greatest sin
,
annd she will wallow in her guilt throughtout eternity
. chris
, on the other hand
, has made it to heaven
,
and upon learning of annie ' s fate
, he journeys tothe hell to find her
anbd to try to free her from her nightmare
. this film brims with immagination
, containing a lush imagery thta shows the arcadia tht is heaven
and the bitterness
and frightfulness that is hell
. it seems that heaven
and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares
. it ' s shape
and look is as infinite as our imagination
. as chris explores his new fantastic world
adn discovers things both amazing
and wonderous
, he also begins to learn more about hismelf
. certian questions baffle him at first
. why does his home in heaven ooze with paint
? what is the significance ofthe thte asian stewardess
? why does he have an all
- too
- willing guide
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
) to help him fidn annie
?
but as he slowly begins to realize the answers
, it makes him stronger
and gives him a greater chance to save annie
.
" dreams
" is both visually
and tellingly beautiful
. alas
, i have one regret
. the movie doed well to gather omre
and more emotional speed
,
but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying
. it seemed as if it was racing tothe smoe kind of great finish
,
but its intensity seemed to wane infact its final moments
.
however
, your eyes will still well up withthe tears
anbd you ' ll fidn lots to savor
. the storytelling is purposeful
adn well constructed
. the journey isnt imaginative
.
and i was suprized by how much i enjoyed this film
.
