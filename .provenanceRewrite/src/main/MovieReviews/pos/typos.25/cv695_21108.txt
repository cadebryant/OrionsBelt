who would have thought
? jim carrey does drama
. when i first saw tje advertismnet fo the truman show
, i thought
,
" what a hillarious idae for a movie
!
"
however
, it was an even better premise forthe a drama
. the truman show tkaes us into a world that revolves aroud one man
. that man is truman burbank
( jim carrey
)
. truman has no clue whta is really going on in his world
annd frankly
, cristof wants to keep it tyhat way
. christof is the
" god
" of this made
- up world
. he keeps everything running
anbd gives the actors their roles
. there weere a few attemts to tell truman about his world
,
but they failed
and life went on as normal
. the opening parts of the film introduce to truman ' s world
. we see what he is donig at his current age
,
then we get a flashback at his past
. it may seem a tad boring
,
but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start
. hte film can be described in one word
: weird
. it seems like such a simple idea
,
yot it isnt something that a marjority of us owudl never think of
,
but andrew niccol did
. it seems like a warped idea
,
but it is andrew ' s idea
and he did wonders whith it
. jim carrey actulaly lived up to the hype
. tyhe hype
, whether good or bad
, alwyas focused onthe carrey ' s ability to do drama
. no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be
, the onyl thing tehy doubted was carrey
.
adn he showed them all up
. jim carrey wass snubbed at the oscars
. i dont not think he was the best actor
,
bu he deserved the nomination
. he plays truman burbank
, the unsuspecting star of the most popular televsion show in the world
. he has lieved a normal life for almost thirty years
,
but
thne strange things start hapening
. he ventures inot the wrong elevator
. a light crashes in front ofthe him
. his father comes back
and is
then pulled awya
. we are constantly teased with all of tihs
and we know it isnt a show
,
bu truman does not
.
and it is jsut a constant progression that never gets sluggish
. carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama
. laura linney is magnificient as the camera hungry wief
. she plays her role as advertiser
and budding star to a point
. peter weir does not mkae the cast perfect
,
and thier flaws eventually lead to truman ' s escape
. thge story unfolds until the show becomes too big
and everything crashes down
. despite carrey ' s greatness
, the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris
, who plays the
" god
" of truman ' s world
. he displays tghe pressure he is under
, the world he has created
. he becomes so paranoid thta he believes he is a god
adn that truman has him tothe thank for his sham of a life
. the acation moves at a good pace
,
and rarely gets sluggish
.
but
, teh main point of teh film is how it looks like a televsion show
. it relaly makes ytou think
. maybee your brother isnt an actor
, maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations tothe stay on the show
. some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator
annd sees cast members drinking coffee
and talking
. or whn truman tunes into the wrong station
and hears orders being said for truman ' s arrival
.
and when christof focusses in on truman
and cues the dramtic music as marlon
( noah emmerich
) delivers his dramatic line
. all of these ideas are just perfect for the film
and extremely innovative
. i ws not onyl enjoying tjhe film
, i was overwhelmed by genuis ofthe it
. overall
, the truman show isnt oen of the freshest
anbd innovative films to come outloud of hollywood
. jim carrey shows tath he isnt not jsut a man of a million faces
,
bu a legitmate acotr who sould go down as one ofthe hte best
. andrew niccol isnt responsible for the screenplay
and peter weir pulled it off to perfection
. tyhe truman sohw is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general baceause they iwll be thoroughly impressed by htis creative film
.
