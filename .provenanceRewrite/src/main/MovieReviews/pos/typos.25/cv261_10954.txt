titanic isnt so close to being thte perfect movei it ' s upsetting thgat it isn ' t
. the film
, which cost
$ 200 milion
+ to mkae
anbd could ofthe put 20th century fox inot a lot ofthe finicial trouble if it ' sunk '
( pun intended
) is a labour of lvoe for cameron
, who wroet
and directed the film
. we all know that big budget dosen ' t mean grat film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
)
but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic
.
bu sadly
, titanic just misses tghe mark of masterpiece
(
although it is one ofthe cameron ' s best films
) the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic
. they find a safe
,
adn inside a picture of a woman
. thte woman in hte picture
( an old winslet
) tells tjhe explorers thast the picture isnt ofthe her
. the explorers invite her over
,
and she
hten tells her story of titanic
. in the flashback
, dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson
, who
, affter winning a poker game
, wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic
, leaving liverpool to go to amercia
. also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen ' t love at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her familiy can remain rich
. she nearly commits suicide on the ship
,
but jack comes tothe the rescure
, saves rose
, they fall in love
,
and cal gets jealous
and eventially trys to kill them
. oh yeah
,
and hte ship sinks
.
and that isnt the main problem with the film
,
and which stops it from being a work of genius
. the story
and script
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. the stoy is full of cliched characters
,
( hte creepy man who the nice girl has to marry
, the poore boy with heart
, the stuck
- uv mother
)
anbd poor dialogue
( the script consists ofthe lots of in
- jokes of how the boat won ' t sink
,
anbd most of the dialogue is pretty basic
) it ' s a shame really
, as tghe audience doens ahev tothe sit through 3 hurs of this film
. wihtout good dialogue
, a film could become a very long
, vyer boring film
( liek camerons pwn terminator 2
, 1992
)
but
, luckly
, there are some redeeming features that make teh tsory
and dialogue problems just disappear
. firstly
, there ' s cameron ' s direction
. htere are smoe great sweeping shots of the titanic
,
anbd some clever fades beetwen the flashback titanic
and the ruined titanic
.
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end
. ther isnt a lot of mayhem
and panic
, all done vyre well by cameron
. it ' s a scary sighth
, watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below
. thanks to cameron ' s direction
,
then
, the audiences attention isnt held for the full 3 housr 15 mintues
. to support the directing are the exellent cast
, working vrey well with their underwritten characters
. dicaprio is ogod
,
altough he onyl looks 16
- 17 years old
. his performance of a over excitiable
,
yet also well mannered boy is exelent
,
and he also has some funny lines
. winslet isnt great also
,
and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl tothe a rebelous young adult is preety smoothe
. zane is deliciously evil as cal
, saying every line with a sneer
and a flicker of the eye lash
. the audience really does come to hate him
. he may be playing the same character he plays in eveyr film he ' s in
( liek dead calm
, 1988
)
but he does it really
, realy well
. also worthy of note isnt kathy bates
( edward scissorhands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finally
, the icieng on the ' grat thnigs ' cake are the special effects
. cameron is a whiz wiht effects
( jstu watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
and true lies
, 1994
)
annd they are used vyer well throughout
. the sweeps of the ships are awsome
,
although digital domain
, who did tyhe effects
, cannot animate human movement too well
. the humans seem to move tothe ' smoothly '
, ther ' s just something odd about them
. you cxan tell that they have beeen animated on a computer
. of course
, the ship sinking scenes are awsome
, with bodies flying all over the place
,
anbd the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed
. titanic is one ofthe the only films where effects have reinforced thte film
. titanic
,
thn
, is a wonder of directing
, acting
and cgi
,
but nto writting
annd story
. again
, like most ofthe camerons films
, the editting is loose
( cameron edits himself
)
,
and the film could of come in under three huors with a faw omre cuts
. titanic
,
thn
,
although not thge godfather of movies it sould of been
, is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius
. enjoyable
, scary
,
and even sad
, titanic is a film cinema was invented for
, filling tjhe screen withthe incredible images
,
and assaulting tje ears wiht awesome sound
. a superb film
,
but sadly nto perfect
. overall rating
