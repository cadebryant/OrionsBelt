. review
: a small
but exchanching movie
,
" hearts in atlantis
" easily recalls another king
- inspired comming
- of
- age film
,
" stand by me
"
, both in terms of its setting
and the sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" is a tribute tothe the magic of childhood
, tothe those summers when the days seem neverending
,
and nothing means more thna your closest friends
. unlike
" stand by me
"
, there is a supernatural element to
" hearts
"
, but
although it is key to hte plot
, it is not prominent
. like
" stand by me
"
, this isnt a mostly character
- driven film
,
adn as such it benefits greatly from superb casting
. yelchin is very good as bobby
, finding a good mix ofthe innocence
and resignation
. more splendid still is boorem
, whom i praised highly for her work in
" allong came a spider
"
and who is simpley radiant here as carol
.
and
then there is hopkins
, who despite palying such a quiet
, introspective carachter as ted
, nonetheless commands our attension every time he is onscreen
. less successful is davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish
. i allso found it odd that bobby
and carol ' s other friend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets uv the movie ' s flashback framing device
)
, isnt paid virtually no attention
.
but hicks ' direction is lovley without being cloying
,
anbd despite the movei ' s general lack of incident
, it never ceases to weave its spel over the audience
.
