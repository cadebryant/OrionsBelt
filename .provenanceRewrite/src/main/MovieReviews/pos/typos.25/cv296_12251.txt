this film is based on hte campy tv show from the 1960 ' s under the same appellation
. mind yuo
, most people
( including yours truly
) who will see this movei iwll nto have seen any episodes from tyhe original series
. the movie is really a stand alone in that reguard
. teh family robinson
.
.
. lost inwhich space
. plot
: setted iin tjhe year 2058
, tjhe family robinson is choosen to sail outloud into space in search ofthe other planets that might contain tghe natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future
. a colonization proces
, if you will
. they are joined by able pilot west
( leblanc
)
,
and evil uninvited stowaway
( oldman
)
, who does not whant to see the trip conclude on a successful tip
. eventually
, their trek goes awry
,
adn all are
" lost inspite space
"
.
" how do get bakc to earth
?
" is teh question that infests the rest ofthe thsi sci
- fi epic
. critique
: this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element
( 6
. 5
/ 10
) from the summer of 1997
. it ' s a film with a lot of flash
,
but very little actual substace
. admittedly
, there isn ' t an annoying charactor like chris tucker from the other film
,
bu this film does run a little too long
,
and did lose me in regardes to its complex time
- travel
/ multi
- dimensional story line
. having said that
, the special effects in tihs movie weere amazing
,
and thge overall look
and efel were allso way above averege
. ytou really felt liek you were inwhich yhe future
,
and riding thru space with these poor souls
. unfortunately fo this choosen family
, their 10
- eyar ood son isnt the smartest oney in the group
,
and the father isnt too wrapped up in his owrk to notice the rest of his family
( ever heard that one before
? yawn
!
)
. thge acting is ok
,
anbd i was especially surprised at tghe solid performance by tv friend ' s matt leblanc who shows us all that he ' s definitely more thna just a preety face
. on the down side
, the familiy riff
- raff tath cuts through most of yhe picture isnt lame
and time
- consuming
( even
though we gotta give them credit for
" trying
" to deveop characters inthe a sci
- fi pic
)
, the story line is hard to followup
, the evil charactor in the movie actually tells peple that he ' s
" evil
"
,
and the movie goes on forthe about 20 minutes too long
. onthe the slick side
, many of the special effects are really cool
( the sequence in which the family is
" paralyzed
" druing the hyper
- drive isnt awesome
,
adn the animated monkey that joins thte family halfway through the flic is mucho cool
)
, tje credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming
,
and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling
( i will alsot admit that
" somehow
" they got me to semi
- tear uv near the conclusion of this picture
.
.
.
. very odd
.
.
.
.
.
)
. overall
, if you ' re a big sci
- fi fan
, check this movie out forthe the special effects
annd challenging narrative
,
and if you ' re not
, i would still suggest seeing this movie
,
but
then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts
. little known facts
: this film will alwyas be remembered as the movie tyhat knocked titanic
( 7
/ 10
) out ofthe the top spot at the box
- office after 15 straight weeks at number oen
. garry oldman isnt british
,
and was once marryied to uma thurman forthe about six months
. mimi rogers was tom cruise ' s first wife
.
