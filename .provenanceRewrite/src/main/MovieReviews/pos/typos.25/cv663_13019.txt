? opinion
: east meets west
. i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic
; he combines asian culinary influences ffrom the west caost with latin american ffrom down sourth
annd european ffrom the atlantic tothe concoct new creations that hit jstu the right combination of flavors
. fomr their state of the art animation studio in orlando
, disney is hoping to work the same kind of east
/ west magic with mulan
. i mean
, what would you sday if i told you tyhat a new movei featured tang dinasty art
, wiht donny osmond singing
, ming
- na wen acting
,
and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon thyat makes pop references to batman
and the reverend jessie jackson
?
yot this is thge case inthe the disney ' s re
- interpretation of the familliar chinese classic
. the end result is spectauclar
; mulan is one of disney ' s best movies ever
. personally
, i ' m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak
- willed subservient asian woman take a beating
: mulan isnt portrayed as a normal
, if spirited
, compassionate gal capable ofthe taking the initiative
. mulan is more than just eastern graphics
and faces combined with westernized pop
adn disney
. kids of any age wiull like the family themes
,
and will understand thte good guys versus bad guys thing
.
and adolescent
adn preteen girls can apprieciate the romance factor
, while the boys admire the battles
.
and adults can admire those male
/ female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family
, hounour
,
and duty with industrial age notions of rumatic love
, gumption
,
and questioning
.
but even tje tiniest details reveal quality
. the movei ' s art supervisors spent three weeks infront china researching the right look
: negative spaces
, postive detail
, period clothing
,
and graphic designs typical of the time
and place
. computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30
, 000 peple
,
and a special program called ' attila ' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns onthe horseback
.
and singers osmond
and salonga are at the top ofthe their game
. balance is crucial
. a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney ' s cup ofthe tea
,
but if you use tyhe charachter as a comic sidekick tothe balance a determined
and spirited heroine
,
thne
, pow
! the dream team
. by the same token
, a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself
,
but toss the dragon in htere
and you ' ve got enough wahoo individualism for a ight hearted disney romp
. it ' s rare that a movie cant seamlessly combine elements fomr both east
and west
, old
and young
, male
and female inot a cohesive
and entertaining whole
,
bu mulan hits the universal bullseye
. it ' s movei for any age
, creed
, gender
, or color
.
