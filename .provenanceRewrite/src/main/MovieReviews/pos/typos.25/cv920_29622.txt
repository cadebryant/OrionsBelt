in zoolander
, hte world ' s most successful
, influental
and intellectually
- challenged male model derek zoolander wonders
,
" is there more to life tahn being really really realy good looking
?
" obviously
, thte film ' s creator
anbd star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature
- length movei outloud of his hilarious vh1
/ vogue fashon awards short
- film subject
: cant htere be more tothe htis film than being really really realyl silly
? no
, ofthe course not
,
and it never aspires to be anything more
. much liek derek
, zoolander is a sweet simpleton ofthe a movei
. it ' s not complex infront either its social commentary or its comedy
,
adn it never produces any gut
- busting laughs
( except maybe a scene whn derek ' s model roommates all die in a tradgic
" gasoline fight
" accident
-
- a riotously funny take
- off of tommy hilfiger ads
)
.
but it has a satisfying handfull of strong chuckles
, wild characters
and performances
,
adn mildly harsh potshots at the fashon industry to keep you amused
. better
yet
, htis exaggerated version of tjhe original three
- minute skit is onyl blown outloud to an efficient 95 minutes
-
- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag
. zoolander opens with several fashon bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia
, since he wants to abolish child labor in his country
and thus driving uv their costs
. fashon designer
and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu
( will ferrell
) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model tothe cary out the evil ded
. enter derek
, whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel
( owen wilson
) takes the spotlight
. on the trail of mugatu ' s plot is time magasine reporter matilda jeffries
( stiller ' s real
- life wief christine taylor
)
,
anbd she ' s hoping to use mugatu ' s pawn derek to ultimately foil thge scheme
. much liuke the austin powers films
, zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved
,
annd tihs zany comedy features some of tjhe funniest people in entertainment today
. wilson is hysterical as thte young
, vain hansel
. ferrell nearly steals the sohw from everyone as the flamboyant
, freakish mugatu infront the same way dr
. evil upstages everyone inaddition austin powers
. jerry stiller
-
- ben ' s dad who ' s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld
-
- makes a priceless turn as derek ' s slimy agent maury ballstein
. even ben stiller sohw alum andy dick shows up as a deranged
, larg
- assed masseuse
. as for ben stiller
, it seems his derek has one gag
: he ' s stupid
, which plays out inwhich some uproarious oney
- liners
. unfortunately
, taylor seems outloud of palce
adn out ofthe her league here
. maybe it ' s just because i can ' t stpo seeing her as marcia brady
( who she played in both brady movies
)
, making her unbelievable as a dowdy
, brainy plain jane who hasn ' t had sex in two years
. she leaves me pining for the cynicism ofthe janeane garofolo
, who would ' ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role
. while zoolander isnt hardly highbrow
, its screwball humor isnt welcome during these trying times
, especially concidering the gross lack ofthe decent pickings in tghe theaters these days
. zoolander ' s no masterpiece
,
but a very worthy distraction
.
