, poitier chase earch other around the world the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when tyhe soviet union imploded
, the western countries lost thier shadow
. with the united states friendly whith the russians
, we no longer had an enity to blame fo the world ' s problems
. thsi showed uv inwhich hollywood films as the communist govornment was noone longer the easy bad guy
. it ' s time tothe rejoice because we ' ve found our new villain
. now it ' s no longer the russion government who sends killers out inot foregn lands
, it ' s the russian
_ mafia
_
. a perfect solution
, it combines the dread of organized crime
adn the still
- rpesent uneasiness with teh former eastern block countries
. best of all
, tje villains are still foreigners
: fear of the other alwyas plays best
. so it is a crime lord infact moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal
( bruce willis
) to assassinate a highly placed us governmnet figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub rayda
. thte fbi is at a loss as to how to protect hte target from someone they ' re not sure even exists
. coming to theri rescue is fromer ira operative declan mulqueen
( richard gere
) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston
( sidney poitier
)
and russian major valentina koslova
( diane venora
)
. mulqueen ' s ex
- girlfriend basque terrorist isabella
( mathilda may
) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal
.
( presumably ther is an exclusive international territorist club somewhere where tghe threee met
.
) thte film follows two parallel tracks as tyhe jackal prepares for his
$ 70 million hitted
adn mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makse sure taht the irishman doesn ' t slip away
. crossing numerous borders
annd donning various disguises for both himself
and his mini
- van
, the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers
. being very loosly based on tghe same book the 1973 thriller
" teh day of the jackal
"
, compairison between the two films isnt inevitible
. htere is no doubt that the original is the better movie
, palying tjhe stry fo suspense rether tahn the curent action
/ adventure
. as a mystery
,
" teh jackal
" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale
,
bu if you cin accept it for what it is
, there ' s entertainment tothe be hadnt
. holes
? let ' s see
? a pivotal clue for mulqueen isnt so obscure that he must posess psychic powers tothe pik it uv
. fo a 20
- year veteren that cin command the big bucks
, the jackal isnt an incredibly poor shooted
. tghe final scene between gere
and willis occurs infront a loction that shoudln be mobbed wih police
,
bu it ' s just yhe twpo of them
. willis ' disguises usualy look liek bruce willis
and are just as interesting as val kilmer ' s in
" teh saint
"
.
(
and lest you misunderstand
, that ' s not a compliment
.
)
but the three stars are funn to watch
. it ' s good to see gere in something other than a business suit
. willis hasnt a mixed history in picking projects
,
bu his characters are always watchable
. poitier is by far the superior atcor
,
but hasnt limited screen timne
. teh problems in logic are flaws
,
but don ' t ruin tyhe experience
. occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes
. this is one of them
