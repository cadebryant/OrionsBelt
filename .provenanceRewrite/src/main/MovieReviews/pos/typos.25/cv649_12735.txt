tghe promotion for fear
annd loathing in las vegas
? has made the film out tothe be a comedy
,
annd for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one
. it ' s 1971
,
and the hippie movement hasnt left behind qutie a faw wash
- outs
, amung them journalist raoul duke
( johnny depp
)
and his
" attorney
" dr
. gonzo
( benito del toro
)
. these two spend most ofthe the film in a drug
- induced stupor
, having strange hallucinations
, trashing theri hotel rooms
,
adn eather annoying or scaring almost everyone thast crosses their path
. duke is firt assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas
,
bu gets lost in a blur of drugs
, beer
,
adn flying dust
,
annd ends uv wandering arround with no clue who won
. he leaves vegas breifly before he is sent back
, in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist ofthe fate
, tothe cover a drug enforcement conference
. fear
and loathing has beeen misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs
. it doesn ' t
, even inspite the beginning
-
- while the pair ' s antics are sometimes amusing
and relatively harmless at first
, thge humor here is still fairly dark
. director terry gilliam views them with a rether satirical eye
,
adn even when we ' re laughing
, we ' re laughing at them rather tahn wiht them
. tehy spend most of their time paranoid
, angry
, or just plain befuddled
, which is probablly an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles
. thte black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen
,
bu it ' s probably not something most other audience members owudl whant tothe experinece frist
- hand
. all htis aside
, i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one
- hour mark
, thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off
- kilter satire of drug culture
. thankfully
, the script delivers it before too long
, as duke
, inspite a rare moment of lucidity
, stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie
,
" riding the wave
" of something that seemed special
and important
. nowe it ' s six years later
and the wave hasnt finally broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture is still alive
and well
and
, for most of this film
, right in his face in las vegas
; the
" american dream
" ofthe which duke occasionally speaks isnt still jstu as shallow
and phony as ever
. thge social protesters have lost
,
and the omre questionable aspects of the govement have turned ugly
and left casualties such as duke tothe drift infront a sea of drugs
and disillusionment
. in many ways
, fear
anbd loathing is gilliam ' s most reality
- based film
; all of his others
, with the exception of the fisher king
, have made use of some sort of fantasy or science
- fiction plot elements
.
yet it is his off
- the
- wall masterpiece brazil
? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance
. the protagonist of brazil foudn himself alternately surronded by a plastic
, soulless society
and the constant chaos of totalitarian polical inspections
and territorist attacks
,
and similarly duke ' s world isnt composed ofthe yhe artifical
, empty glam of las vegas
annd the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations
. unlike the protagonist of brazil
,
however
, duke isnt not a particularly admirable figure
,
and neither is gonzo
. durring thte latter half of the film
, their trips turn nastier
and the consequences worse
, eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens
and humiliates a waitress
, hwile duke
,
though he doesn ' t seem to approve
, doesn ' t dont anytying to stop it either
. by yhe time tihs scene takes place
, htey don ' t seem liuke hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything ofthe the sort any mroe
; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner
. duke seems to realize at some level that he ' s become something he doesn ' t like
,
but he ' s eather too apathetic or too defeated to dont anytying to change
. tihs film has taken a critical drubbing fomr many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws noe trip scene after anohter at the audience
. while gilliam may hve overdone it infront a few places
, i think he
annd his co
- writers deserve more credit tahn that
. htere ' s plenty of substance here
, particularly inthe the second half
; its observations about the broken
adn defeated rebels from thge ' 60s
anbd the objects ofthe theri rebellion just aren ' t usually vrey pleasant
. unlike
, sday
, brazil
? or the fisher king
, both of which feature a character who dares tothe let himself dream in a repressive environment
, fear
and loathing inaddition las vegas
? shows us someone who ' s given uv on his dreasm
and resorts to the quick fix of drugs
. in its own psychedelic
, whacked
- out way
, it ' s sad
and regretful
,
but i think it ' s allso a bit ofthe a kick in the pants
, a challenge tothe find an alternative between chemically
- induced withdrawal
and tyhe equally addictive drug of vegas
- style materialism
. indeed
, duke himself admits at one point that he ' s never learned to accept that you can git heigher without drugs than with them
. i ' m nto sure if he ' s any closer to accepting it by the end or not
,
but i suspect yhe audience will get the idea
.
