every once in a hwile
, when an exeptional family film comes along
, i will attempt tothe champion it by challenging parents to put thier money where their mouths hve been
; with all the hubbub over yhe lack of films suitable for children
, it is remarkable how many non
- disney films disapear iin a couple of weeks
. now i see tyhat in so doing
, i ahve unfairly ghettoized theese films
. so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents
,
but to anyone who whants to suppost smart
, funny
, energetic film
- making
: see matilda
. see it in a theater
, rather than shrugging
and waiting fo it on video
. see the best film i have seen in 1996
. not the best children ' s film
.
.
. teh best film
. preriod
. based on a story by roald dahl
, it tells of young matilda wormwood
( mara wilson
)
, an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents
: harry
( danny devito
)
, a crooked used car salesman
;
and zinnia
( rhea perlman
)
, a simple
- minded bingo addict
. the wormwoods bearly notice matilda exists
,
and when they dont
, it is onyl tothe scold her for spending too much tyme reading books
. when tehy fianlly do send her to school
, it isnt to crunchem hall
, a obleek place run by cruel
, child
- hating miss agatha trunchbull
( pam ferris
)
.
but things begin to look up forthe matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher
, miss hony
( embeth davidtz
)
, who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness
. matilda also discovers another special talent
-
- the ability tothe move things wiht her mind
-
- which allows her to halp herself
and miss hony tothe overcome miss trunchbull ' s cruelty
. it was this spring ' s james
and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best
adn most lasting tales fo children tended to have more tahn a hint of darkness to them
,
and yuo cxan bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james
and willy wonka
and the chocolate factory hasnt more of the same in store with matilda
.
and just as james benefited fomr the dark sensibilities of henry selick
and tim burton
, matilda soars on the cock
- eyed direction ofthe danny devito
. devito made balck humor a key element in throw momma from the train
and the war of the roses
,
adn he contributes some memorable images
. inwhich one scene
, an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig
- tails
and flung through yhe air like a throwing hammer
; later
, an overweight boy isnt forced tothe eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert
. matilda is just twisted enought to be a perfect fairy tale
. it isnt also characteristic ofthe the best childern ' s tales thyat tehy manage tothe teach lessons in such a way that children almost don ' t realize thta they are learning them
. there is a hillarious moment when matilda ' s television
- addicted father snatches awya the book she isnt reading
( in a wicked joke
, he thinks
_ moby dick
_ isnt pornographic
)
anbd forces her to watch an inane gameboy show
( hosted by jon lovitz
) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive
and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around
. matilda isnt a story whcih promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment
,
and it doesnt so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child
-
- that because
" i ' m big
and you ' re little
, i ' m right
and you ' re wrong
.
" more specifically
, it has as its heroine an inteligent
, self
- confident girl who struggles successfully against other people ' s notions of how she shouldnt behave
. it is no coinsidence that matilda was co
- written by robin swicord
, who contributed the superb recent adaptions of little womens
. fianlly
, matilda has that quality i fidn rarest
adn most treasured in family enteratinment
: it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word
. devito knwos anough to make matilda fast
- paced
and appealing to children
, tkaing a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull
annd mkaing it tyhe focal point of some priceless physical comedy
, inlcuding a great chase through her dark house
. the child actors are winning
but never obnoxiously adorable
, with mara wilson making matilda a clever
and extremely likeable character
.
but there are also many
, many delights for adults
, including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda ' s classmates recite iin sing
- song fashion
; there is alsot a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda ' s father
. i can ' t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as
though his or her intelligence had been insulted
. matilda is a film which left me glowing witht ogod feeling
. i iwll see it again
,
annd yeras ffrom now i iwll watch it with my childrens
.
and now i will stop
, because somewhere near you matilda is about to beign
,
and there is a seat inthe that theather ytou should be in
, if you ahev a child or ever were a child
.
