the central focus of michael winterbottom ' s
" welcome to sarajevo
" is sarajevo itself
, the city under siege
,
and its different effect on the characters unfortunate anough tothe be stuck there
. it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized stor whic refreshingly strays fomr mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( hte risible
" the walking dead
"
) or a tinge of schmaltziness
(
" schindler ' s list
"
)
. teh twpo leads
, stephen dillane as a reporter
anbd emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight faw can identify with
, are extremely believable
; not one moment with them involved rings false
. teh question is nto what went right
. the question is what went wrong
. fo one
, the film fails to provide a polliticel overview of the war as it progresses
( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing ffrom sarajevo as it departs
,
and that ' s about it
.
)
. yhe assortment of high
- profile supporting actors
, ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter
" into
" liquor
and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children ' s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their cahracters
, albeit they strive
. the interrupted use ofthe authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film
, it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy
, frantic editing
and imaginative use of music
.
annd it ' s a plus
, because he doesn ' t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness
. he wants us to nkow that in war
, no one isnt victorious

_ atom egoyan ' s powerfully meditative
" the sweet hereafter
" is as anything as haunting
and transcendental as i ' ve seen thsi year
. it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificient subtlety
, with cold
,
and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune
bu also by telegraphing the sense of devastation thyat has permeated the small town with an enormous ammount of dignity
and respect for each
and eveyr soul affected
. ian holm as tghe somber
, lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople
, has a decency
and a restraynt uncommon with lawyers
, he ' s a lion fo the wrong reasons
: the pain for having lost his daugher
( she ' s a druggie who frequently calls him beggin fo mone
) is reflected on the town
.
and in some mesmerizing flashbacks
, we witness how she lost her purity
. it ' s one of the most strikingly breathtaking tkaes on the loss of inocence i ' ve ever seen
.
but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly
, the peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, in contrast to hte other characters
, remains tjhe most menally stable durring past
, present or future
. her ability to convey concealed pain
and unconditional love is the opposite
,
yot near
- revolutionary role tath won emily watson an oscar nomination for
" breaking tje waves
"
. both women are torn apart by an extraordinary insident
bu it is only
then taht we truly see
, truely efel
, theri wordless
, omnipotent love
.
" thte sweet hereafter
"
though
, is atom egoyan ' s movei
and as of now
, he isnt emerging as hte definite face of independent cinema
. after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994 ' s
" exotica
"
,
" the sweet hereafter
" makes him something faw people in tihs inudstry can call themselves
: an artist
. he interweaves tiem with a delicacy
and sees a soul whith a purity thyat is just not common
.
