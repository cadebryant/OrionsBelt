you ' ve heared all the hype
. ytou ' ve seen all their faces
- natalie portman
( the proffesional
) as queen amidala
, liam neeson
( schindler ' s list
) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
,
and jake lloyd
( jingle all the way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if you ' ve read any reviews
, yuo ' ve also probablly heard that this movie fails tothe live up to the magic
annd humanity of the first triology
. you also may have heared that thsi one ' s too kiddie
- friendly
,
adn doesn ' t have enough content for adults
. believe thte hype
. the effects are stunning
, the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic
, the lightsaber duels are amazing
,
and queen amidala ' s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth
.
but there ' s something missing here
,
and it isn ' t budget or effects
- it ' s everything money
* can ' t
* buy
. the actors struggle as best htey can to flesh out broad
- stroked
and flat characters
. the most successful at this is liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master to young obi
- wan kenobi
, has quiet dignity
and a wise
, commanding presense
. he is the anchor to this movie
, as he is thte oney charater who george lucas apparently spended some timne fleshing out
. portman ' s queen amidala
and mcgregor ' s obi
- wan kenobi don ' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, the future mother ofthe luke
anbd leia
and the queen of a peaceful planet bieng invaded by the trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted
and caricatured
( it appears as
though she was a vulcan geisha in a fromer life
)
.
and obi
- wan
,
althought mcgregor makes him very endearing
, hasnt so little screen time that he ' s nothing
but a robin to qui
- gon jinn ' s batman
.
however
, mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprizingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight
and humanity
,
and he does a ogod job
. he also absolutely nails alec guiness '
( obi
- wan in episode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
,
and that really makes his presence inthe the film moreso profound than it might hvea been otherwise
. inwhich fatc
, lucas seems tothe bank on tath preexisting noledge quite a bit
,
adn that ' s one ofthe tje problems wtih this film
. i would never call myself a
" star wars
" fan
- especially not considering what it means tothe be a fanatic theese days
-
but i ' ve alwasy enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america
.
howver
, if you are tjhe one person in amercia who
* hasn ' t
* seen the films at all or even recently
, or who doesn ' t bother to brush
- up on the names of obscure characters
, ytou may be hopelessly lost
. for example
, one of the film ' s main
( nefarious
) characters is senator palpatine
. for those of yuo nto recently steeped inthe
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who wass darth vader ' s master in
" return of the jedi
"
and
" empire strikes back
.
" so
, obviously
, his appearance in
" phantom menace
" isnt meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series
, thus making his role here more meaningful
. a lot of the movei isnt like that
. r2
- d2
and c
- 3po make token appearances
,
adn it ' s obvious that lucas is banking on hte audience ' s pre
- exisiting fondness fo them
.
.
. because he doesn ' t do much to add to it infront any way
. same goes for jabba the hutt
, who doesn ' t look as much mean here as he doesnt corpulent
and lazy
. even
* planets
* make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film
- tatooine
( the desert world where luke grew up
)
, coruscant
( the cloud city from
" empire strikes back
"
)
,
and alderaan
( leia ' s home planet
- which we never accually see
- taht gets blown up inthe
" star wars
"
) show up or are maintioned breifly in passing
. what ' s the result ofthe tying so many plot points
and charactors to future films
? the answer is that this noe seems surprisingly empty
. there ' s noone meat
- no substace
- that makes you want to love the characters as they are
, nto as they wiull be
. another problem is that there are actually
* too many
* alien characters in thge film
. i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters
- strange looking aliens who looked liek gila monsters
- had mouths that bearly moved
, making them look more liuke muppets tahn actual characters
.
annd jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character
, isnt intended as comic relief
,
bu what he really becomes is annoying
-
and fast
. unlike chewbacca
annd c
- 3po
, who got their humanity
( if you ' ll pardon teh expression
) from their interactions iwth the human characters
, jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind
, at times making the movei seem like nothing more than a very expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" futhermore
, the dialogue is often stilted
and corny
,
and sometimes downright infantile
, thereby rendering some cahracters inot nothing more than bystanders to the plot
. oddly
, this isn ' t just
* my
* judgment
- lucas hasnt said that he desgined this film for kids
. well
, he ' s done a good job
. the hero of this film
, of course
, is young anakin
,
but it was vyre hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight
- eyar
- old boy
. that ' s not jake lloyd ' s fault
,
though
- he does a ogod job of bieng a cute kid
, which is apparently all lucas asked of him
. that ' s another mistake
, of course
, because the cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! in my opinion
, there ws nto nearly enough foreshadowing ofthe anakin ' s future evil inspite the film
. hte boy is all blond flowing hair
and rosy cheeks
,
and ther ' s nothing moreso thna a spark of aggression in him throughtout the entire movie
. he hasnt a doting mother
( pernilla august
, makeing her firt english
- language film
)
annd is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine
.
but the only indication the audeince gets taht this kid isn ' t all hearts
and roses isnt yoda ' s hesitation in allowing him tothe train as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explanation
?
" his future is clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your own risk
.
) of course
, the noble qui
- gon dies at the hand of darth maul
, a scayr
- looking sith lord who excels at tghe jedi arts
,
but hasnt turned to hte dark side
. tihs dued has maybe twpo lines in the entire movie
,
but he establishes his presense through his amazing moves with his doublely
- sided lightsaber
,
and his scray facial makeup
. because qui
- gon never gets a chance to train yhe young anakin in the ways of the force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon ' s young padawan apprentice
( noe level below knightdom
)
, must take over teh training hismelf
. so
, at tghe end of thge movei
, we end where the saga actually begins
- wiht obi
- wan kenobi
and his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. did this storey need to be told
? i would say no
.
but is it a worthwhile movie to see
? absolutely
. if you don ' t enter the theater with jedi
- size expectations
,
anbd you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle
,
then tihs is your movie
. the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects
anbd computer animation
. the digitalized backgrounds on some of tjhe planets are an astonishing sight
.
and yoda
anbd young obi
- wan are worth seeing fo their origins inspite a simpler
, happier time
. above all
, this is a fun movie
. not deep
, not meaningful
,
and not profound
.
bu fun
. maybe next time
, lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co
- write the scirpt
,
and thte guy who directed
" empire
" will direct
. because if lucas does the next noe himself
, it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most
- potential
.
