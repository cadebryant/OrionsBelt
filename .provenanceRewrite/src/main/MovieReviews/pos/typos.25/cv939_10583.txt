scream 2
, liek its predecessor
, is a genre
- crossing film
. it isnt about 50
% horror film
and 50
% muder mystery
. the mix worked very well last time
and it continues to entertain this time
. scream was also known for its self
- referential tone
. many inside jokes were made inaddition reference to horror movies
adn wes craven
. again
, scream 2 follows suit with cahracters saying such things as
" sequels suck
"
and
" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
.
" scream 2 ' s story isnt vyer similar to it ' s predecessor ' s
. sidney
( neve campbell
)
, having survived the killing spree in scream
, is now in college
. gale weathers
( courteney cox
) has written a book about the murders
anbd that book isnt now being released as a feature film
, called stab
( hwihc forthe all practial purposes isnt the real
- world movie scream
)
. at the premiere of stab
, two students from sidney ' s college are stabbed to death
,
anbd a new story begins
. teh press descends on sidney
annd her college to get the scoop onthe this sequel killer
. tehy watn tothe know all baout the links between stab
, sidney
,
and the recent murders
. the most complex self
- refeence i saw
( this should be an olympic event
) was hte scene where gale weathers ws asking questions at a press conference
. the rest of the press ws watching
and videotaping weathers
. the other survivors fomr scream weere watching
and videotaping tghe press
. the audience was watching hte whole
, filmed scene
.
( whew
.
) the movie is packed with layers
and self
- references that make it a pleasure to watch
. even better owudl be to watch a double feature of scream
and scream 2
. that ' s nto to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep
, or even a good movie
. tje just add to the fun of watching it
. i recommend it for other reasons as well
. what i liked best baout hte horror aspect ofthe the movie is that the monster isnt not supernatural
. noone werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength isnt responsible
. it is a person inaddition a mask
adn a robe
, his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims
. no extraordinary leap of faith is needed tothe believe in the killer
. the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies
, you have less grounds to say
" it ' s jstu a movie
.
" the whodunit aspect of teh movie is not that great by itself
- gale weathers
and deputy dewey
( david arquette
, also from the orignal
) track down a killer
. htey are likeable
,
but not outstanding
.
but in combination with the horror aspect
, the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint
. it was exactlly a yearm ago today that i wrote teh review for scream
. the internet movei database says tht scream 3 is in the works
, so i wonder if i ' ll be doing tje same thing on january 1
, 1999
. if craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep teh qualty high
, i ' ll be happy to mark my calenar
.
