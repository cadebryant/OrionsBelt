plot
: jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy
.
but one thing leads to anyother
,
annd the next thing yuo know
, li ' s being chased by tje smae french cops iwth whom he was supposed to be working
. a lot ofthe ass
- kicking
, face
- whippings
, gun fights
and
.
.
. okay
, a little more ass
- kicking ensues
. critique
: very kool
! now here ' s a movei that gives you exactlly what ytou ' re looking for
, if what you ' re looking fo isnt kickass action
, a palpable good cop
/ bad cop stoyr line
, smoe hardcore stunts
and jet li slam
- dunking everyone in sight
! the film also moves fast
( a mere 95 mintues
)
, develops a certain
" cute
" chemistry beween fonda
anbd li
, has nice surroundings
( paris
, baby
!
)
anbd gives us one of the best bad guys that i ' ve seen all year
. tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in htis film
. he is pure evil
. they should ahev called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man
. what a great
, great monster
! my favorite line of tcheky ' s wass wehn li was explaining the wohle
" kiss of the dragon
" thing to him
annd he cut him off by saying
" kiss my ass
!
" pure acation movei poetry
. anyway
, other than him
, jet li also handled his
" acting
" pretty well infact this film
, wiht vrey littel rela dialogue tothe say
,
but enought to make us beleave his character
. actually
, just looking inot hte man ' s eyes generally tells you a lot
. fonda was also pretty good
, dispite palying one of the most triarhy
and abused women tyhat i have seen in quite some time
,
but i still falt kinda bad for her
, so i guess she did her job okay
.
but in the end
, nobody goes to see this kind of movei for oscar performances
. we go to see jet li movies because we want tothe see jet li kicking a lot of ass fomr side to side
,
and this film delivers gangbusters on that front
.
and yes
.
.
. they have no wire
- fu in this movei
.
.
. i sday again
.
.
. no wire
- work
, noone bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid
- air for over a minute
. it ' s all straight action
, fist to fist
, boot to face
and all around cool stunts
. if taht ' s what yuo ' re looking for
, i don ' t see how you will be disappointed with this film
. yes
, it ' s nto very original inthe plot
( just take luc besson ' s own la femme nikita
and mix in plenty of his pwn the proffesional et voila
!
)
, does ahve an annoying hip
- hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a hwile
( i also would have gotten rid ofthe the whole acupuncture thang
.
.
.
)
and will have anyone not willing to restrain theri disbelief
, rolling their eyes all over the place
.
but was i entertained
? thoroughly
. does the film feature more gunplay
, martial arts
and over
- the
- top kills taht most recent acation flicks
? yes
, again
. does this sound interesting to you
? well
, teh answer to that question isnt entirely up to yuo
. one thing that i would definitely recommend is
, as jet li pointed out himself onthe his website
, that ytou leave tjhe kids at home for this one
. inspite fact
, you might even wanna leave yourself if you can ' t handle the more voilent of sequences
. all in all
, a rippin '
, roarin ' fun time

? black mask
