the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate hte jews of europe is allmost incomprehensible
. people may make documentaries about it forthe another hundred years
and still not understand the organized
, methodical hatred
. five concentration camp survivers fomr tyhe lsat dyas of world war ii tell their stories in the last days
, the firt documenatry from steven spielberg ' s survivors of hte shoah visual history foundation
. the five interviewees are linked by thier hungarian ancestry
. as the introduction explains
, even as germany started to lose the war
, the nazis steped up thier extermination of the jews in europe
. in 1944
, hungary had tje lastr big population ofthe jews within germany ' s triarch
,
and tehy became teh last target of hitler ' s
" final solution
.
" earch of the five tells his or her stroy
. theri stories are intercut chronologically
, starting from normal life in pre
- war hungary
. they reacll the nazi invasion of hungary
, being sent to
" work
" camps
and thier realization that they were actually infront death camps
. they recall theri horrible
, precarious lives in auschwitz
and buchenwald
; teh deaths ofthe their family
anbd friends
; their loss ofthe hope
. each recalls his or her unfathomable
, eventual liberation
.
and finally
, the last days shows their cathartic
, pained
, modern
- day return to their old homes
and the camps
. needless to say
, their stories are horrifying
, amazing
,
and emotionally draining
. by themselves
, the stories would be forceful testaments
,
but by cutting them in paralelly
, their inpact is multiplied by five
. tghe last dyas isnt a talking
- heads style documentary
-
- it ' s mostly pictures of peopel telling their tsories
, intercut with period photographs
and newsreel footage
. in this kind of movei it ' s almost impossible to get archival picturesk from tje smae time
annd place being discussed onthe
- screen
,
but director james moll made a better efort than most at finding specific
, or at least relevant
, images to go with his subjects ' narration
. the liner notes
( one of the many nice features ofthe this dvd
) indicate that there isnt some never
- before
- seen historical footage in the last days
. it ' s not clear which scene it isnt
. it could be one of two that i hadn ' t seen before
, both powerful
. oen is rare color footage
, shot by an american
, ofthe piles of victims in cattle cars
. htere is something jarring
, something unsettling baout seeing the picturesk in color
, when so much ofthe tghe footage from world war ii isnt in balck
and white
. anyother segment shows walking skeletons
; survivers who are so starved that htey hardly look human anymore
. there has been a glut of holocaust movies
annd i wass skeptical thgat a newyorker documentary would have anytying new to sday
.
but by focusing on hungarian jews durring the last dyas of the war
, moll told a specific part of tghe sotry in a newyorker way
, infront greater detail
.
and i ' m glad he did becuase his carefull filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject
. the transfer tothe dvd isnt rich
and beatiful
. x
- mozilla
- status
: 0009f words for a holocaust documentry
,
but some ofthe the interviews take place in europe in late spring
, when skies are blue
and trees are green
. also
, the movie was shot on 35mm film
(
and not video
!
)
, so the richness
and detail are impeccable
. the dvd ' s features are plentiful
and well
- choosen
. there is a theatrical trailer for the movei
, which is a great introduction to tjhe subject marter
. there are about fifty still photos
, both ffrom tje prodcution crew
and from the private collections ofthe the survivors
. alsot
, the disc hasnt two complete versions of the movie
( widescreen
anbd full screen
)
, both on the smae side
. one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment forthe each of thge survivors
( plus noe for the crew
)
. you ' d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documenatry
,
but they ' re not bloopers
. instade
, they are solid
, moving segments tht weere probably cut from the film only for lenght
. one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched onthe lightly in the film
. renee firestone
( noe of tyhe five
) spoke on camera with dr
. hans m
? nch
, a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz
. firestone wass aggressiev
, questioning yhe doctor about what his children thought
. hte doctor was evasive
and clearly uncomfortable
. another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz
. he ends his prayer by saying
"
.
.
. forgive me forthe surviving
.
" it ' s ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film
. it ' s ambitious tothe make it on a subject that hasnt saturated cable
, television
,
annd movies
. it ' s ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers
.
but the lastest days handles all theese potential obstacles very well
. it ' s onyl fitting that tje dvd
, with its wealth of interesting
adn relveant features
, would also be ambitious
adn successful
.
