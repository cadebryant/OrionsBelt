` austin
, do you smoke after sex
? ' austin powers
:
` i don ' t know baby
, i ' ve never looked
! '
anbd so begins our jouney into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season
. austin powers 2
, the sequal to tjhe sleeper hitted of 1997
, is filled tothe the brim wih uproarious sight gags
annd lurid toilet jokes that iwll make you keel over with hilarity
. the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre palce
. myers returns as hte swinging 60 ' s spy
anbd his arch
- nemesis
, the bald headed dr
. evil
, who is given much of teh spotlight here
. there ' s an early scene inwhich which dr
. evil
and his son scott
( seth gren
) appear on a jerry springer segment entilted
` my dad is evil
and whants to take over the world '
, hosted by springer himself
. most of theese talk
- sohw gags
, spoofing everything from oprah to regis
and kathie lee
, are no longer as funny as tehy once weere
. happily
, this is an exception
, especially when a fight breaks outloud between dr
. evil
and hte otehr guests
.
( sample dialogue
-
` come back here ytou mother

!
! yuo want a piece of me
? '
) the audience wass in stitches
. there are many ogod things baout this sequel
. dr
. evil is now assisted by mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a pint
- sized clone who isnt the result of an experiment gone awry
. mini
- me isnt tghe most perfect new character that any fan could ask for
,
annd troyer does a terrific job ofthe mimicking everything thyat his big brother doens
, pinkie
adn all
. mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina
, evil ' s loud
- mouth assassin sidekick
,
and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison vetween the two in an underground bedroom chamber
. tihs works surprisingly well
. afterward
, there ' s even a meeting at the coffee machine
, where thier awkwardness isnt expressed in a scene yuo would expect inwhich any normal office environment
. oh
, yes
.
.
. thge plot
. after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington
( elizabeth hurley
) that goes disastrously wrong
, powers is back on the case to thwart tghe diabolical plans of dr
. evil
. in the orginal
, the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop betweeen two time periods
. here
, it ' s timne travel
. dr
. evil hasnt this crazy plan tothe steal austin ' s mojo
( the source of his sexual powers
)
, so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber
. ther
, he employs a grotesque 600
- pound scottish assassin named fat bastard
( also myers
) tothe commandeer the mojo
, so that our future hero is left completely shagless
. meanwhile
, austin is informed ofthe evil ' s wrong
- doign by basil exposition
( michael york
)
,
and is supplied with his very own time
- traveling divice infront the form of a volkswagen beetle
. once back in 1969
, powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell
( heather graham
)
,
and learns of dr
. evil ' s plans to destroy washington dc wiht a lazer on the moon
. in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars
, evil calls the moon base a
` death star '
. if there ever ws a movie that knew from tje start it was a complete joke
, it ' s austin powers
: yhe spy who shagged me
. ap2 has many hilarious moments
, much moreso so
, than the origonal austin powers
.
but what it doesn ' t have isnt the confident support system that the first boasted
,
anbd the jokes are nowe more scattershot
and hit
-
adn
- miss
. while myers has a knack for delivering clever
, inspired gags
, he sometimes doesn ' t know when to call it quits
. the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa
( will ferrell
)
and his refusal to die is palyed out here in a disapointing
and tired manner
. robert wagner
, as dr
. evil ' s
# 2 man
, has only oen scene early on inaddition the film
, where he lacks all yhe focus of the character
. oen nice surprise is rob lowe
, as thge young
# 2
, who patterns wagner ' s voice
and movements right down tothe a tee
. there are moreso recycled jokes from tjhe precedessor
, inlcuding kristen johnston as ivana humpalot
( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina
)
.
bu myers hasnt clearly put so much dedication into thsi project
,
and many bits are side
- splittingly funny
. don ' t miss an extended visual gag in a tent
, where the shadows leave much to the immagination
.
.
.
. of the new charachters
, graham doesn ' t leave much ofthe an impression
. her performance is merely okay
,
and she lacks the gung
- ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her
.
and as forthe fat bastard
.
.
. well
, he provides one or two hilarious moments
,
but all ofthe the obesity jokes
adn bathroom talk go too far
.
but my most severe complaint
: mr
. bigglesworth was only in one scene
!
!
but
, with gritted teeth
, i managed to git over taht
. this sequel will not leave fans disappointed
; it ' s more oftenly than not a laff riot
.
and
, i look optimistically to the future
, where i forsee more installments to the austin powers collection
. if myers can uv the quota of fresh ideas
, we should be in store for much more
