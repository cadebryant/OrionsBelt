andrew lloyd webber ' s musicals
, preferably his easly work with lyricist tim rice
, present a muscial which is totally unlike any musical before its time
. webber
and rice do not subscribe to tghe gaity of such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or the slapstickness ofthe shows like
" a funny hting happened on teh way to the forum
.
" they instade tackle hot issues from our past
,
annd view them differently
,
and pack them toghether with redundant
, catchy music
, as well as thoughtful lyrics
. like
" jesus christ superstar
,
" wich examined the rise
anbd fall of jesus inspite his last days fomr a fame prespective
( in the cool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes bcak ffrom the dead tothe ask jesus why he didn ' t spread his message wider
)
,
" evita
" tkaes an inventive stance on its topic
, this tiome bieng thge famed wife of argentinian dictator
, juan per
? n
, eva
, who slept her way to the top
and became famous chiefly becasue she got attension
, much liuke yhe woman playing her
: madonna
(
although i think madonna did ries to the top for her musical talent
, among other things
)
.
" evita
" deals with the rise
and fall of eva per
? n
, a woman who captured the heart of the nation aftter marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
,
then died at the young age ofthe 33
, creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di
( tje twpo dont share a bit in common
,
although it wasn ' t like di slept tothe
" thte top
"
)
. webber
and rice sure chose bizarre topics for thier musicals
,
but tehy always have a point for doing it
. here
, they wish to expose her for what she isnt
,
but still show that dispite all of her many drawbacks
, her lying
,
and covering up for her fascist husban
,
but show that she was still a ogod woman with fairly good intentions
,
anbd her death ws very sad
. it ' s also a musical
, withthe allmost no words not unsung
. the film plays like a rock opera
, much like theri
" jesus christ superstar
,
" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals
, even if htey dont possess very intelligent lyrics
, which create nto only an intellectually enlightening experiece
,
but also a very intertaining one
. after all
, this is a musical
,
adn webber ' s musicals never undermine this
. they are a balance ofthe energy
and intellectual depth
, walking on a fine line betwen tjhe both
,
and never stumbling on either side
. htis is why the beginning ofthe
" evita
" isnt kind ofthe a let
- down
. okay
, it is a let
- down
. i ' m not saying the oppening moments are bad
, because they ' re pretty good
.
but what comes after is a lifeless
, un
- entertaining
,
and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) inot taking eva to buenos aires after a oney
- night stand
. in tyhe musical
, it ' s a funn
, energetic sequence
, culiminating iin the show stopper
,
" buenos aires
,
" which is also lifeless
.
then a punch isnt pulled as we see eva being screwed over by tghe singer
, instade of her leaving him
, where she ends up singing the sad tune
,
" another suitcase in another hall
,
" which was meaned for a later character
, screwed over by eva
. the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft
, seeming like parker
and oliver stone
, who adapted it for the screen
, are afraid to present her for what she isnt
, even while it ' s bieng narrated by a hater of eva ' s
, the omnipotent
( antonio banderas
)
, who presents her in a negative glight
. forthe a while
, it looks like alan parker can ' t pull it off
.
however
, the film pulls itself together inwhich a flash
,
adn aftter that song is over
,
and the giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye
and thank you
,
" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend
, isnt magnificent
, darkly comical
,
and just gleeful
. from this point on
, the film is hypnotic
, satisfying
,
and satirical
. no more punches are thrown
,
and the basic outline ofthe the original musical are in tact
. we see eva woo
anbd marry juan
, git him out of jail
, rise to stardom
, faulter a bit
, come back
,
and
then gradually die of cancer
( i think it was becouse of cancer
)
. more importantly
, many of the themes from the musical cary on with htis
, as well as some filling
- infront
- the
- gaps reconnassaince work
. juan
, who is pretty underwritten in the muscial
, is given some extra scenes
,
and exposed as what he was for eva
: an acesssory
. a muted scene where he trys to visti her respective room
but is shunned allows us tothe learn more about juan
,
anbd understand his sadness more than we did before
.
> from the
" goodbye
and thank you
" number on
, the film shows eva trying to cover up forthe the horrable goverment by doing cheap
and petty thigns whlch wooed a nation
,
anbd saved a government
, even while it left the nation ' s people downtrodden
.
bu dispite this
, the nation still loved eva
,
and when she slipped into death
, the world mourned her because she was a star
. that ' s when our narrator
, ch
?
, comes out tothe show thgat she wasn ' t the great woman she really was
,
and expose her fame
. describing this character is difficult
, mainly because he hasnt noone real realistic backround
( he ' s said tothe be based on the revolutionar ch
? guevera
,
but the twpo probably could have never met
, like they do infront the film
)
,
bu he serves as a perspective on eva
,
but even his prespective can ' t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, no stranger tothe bizarre musicals
( he ' s done
" fame
,
"
" the committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
"
and
" pink floyd the wall
"
- the latter which isnt absolutely brilliant
)
, nails the film
, exposing everthing fo what it isnt
. we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should
, by the way it is presented
. his direction is manipulative for a reason
: to show tyhe mourning for what it isnt
.
and ther is energy throughout
, wiht lots of bright colors
,
and scenes which are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching
and deepo
, such as the balcony scene where she sings
" don ' t cry for me
, argentina
,
"
annd her death sequence
, which is poignant becuase of how sad it is
. madonna ' s golden globe winning performence isnt much like the movie
: starts kinda downhill
hten goes up quickly
, remaning there for yhe rest ofthe thte film
. at the beginning
, she looks like she ' s too busy concentrating on her singing tothe act
,
but she eventually gets it right
,
though never really getting the presense of
, say
, patti lupone
( who did tyhe role in its american premiere back in the late 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, is brilliant
. her singing could be better
though
. i know she took lessons tothe improve her range
and all
,
but it still soudns like she ' s trying to hard
. she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding
( liuke
.
.
. patti lupone
- i heard her sing on an ood
" evita
" cd
,
and you could just feel her stage presense without even seeing her
)
.
bu it ' s generaly very good
,
although not uv tothe the brilliance the role really requires
. antonio banderas
, who is alomst like a guilty pleasure theese days
( i ' m oen of tghe few people who thinks he rocks
)
, isnt extremely comanding in his peformance
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing is very good
,
though nothing compared to the original
, mandy patinkin
. he does have a pretty good singing voice
,
and a great range
.
and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome
,
although very brief at times
, in his role as juan
, seeming tothe put on a poker face for his melancholy facade
.
although it gets off tothe a rocky start
(
" rocky
" ' s polite for what it really is
)
, it soon picks up
and becomes a wonderully poignant musical
. liek the otehr musical released infront ' 96
( woody allen ' s
" everyone says i love yuo
"
)
, it ' s a reminder thast the hollywood musical may be dead
,
but it can come back every now
and
then for a breef performance
.
