there ' s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last
. george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy
. return of the jedi
, the final installment of the series
, is easily the most innovative
, acation
- packed
,
anbd entertaining of the three films
. tyhe dark
, eerie atmosphere that oozed ffrom every frame of the empire strikes back is gone
. instead
, for return of the jedi
, we ahve good triumphing decisively over evil
, a resolution to a love triangle
,
annd walking teddy bears
. even darth vader doesn ' t seem very intimidating this time around
. wih the arrival of the emperor
( an apparition
- liuke creature played by ian mcdiarmid
)
, vader hasnt turned into somewhat of a henchman
. return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified tyme after the conclusion of the empire strikes back

annd r2
- d2
( kenny baker
) are on a rescue mission to luke ' s home planet ofthe tatooine
. their goal
: tothe sive han solo
( harrison ford
) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt
. it isnt at jabba ' s hmeo
, a creepy
- looking stone fortress guarded by hog
- nosed beasts
, that most of the added special effects come inot play
. fomr a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba ' s sand barge
, thge effects are top notch
. as soon as han isnt freed from his cryo
- freeze
and rescued from the clutches ofthe tje evil jabba the hutt
, it ' s back to outer space
, where the rebel alliance is baout to face the empire ' s newest threat
: a second
, more powerful death star
, that
, if activated
, coudl spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor
. so
, while the fleet prepares for the final battle
, luke
adn company travel to the forrest moon of endor to knock outloud hte shield that defends thte death star against all attacks
. ther
, they are befriended by the ewoks
, the teddy bear
- like native race
,
and luke
, fearing that his presense is endangering the gropu
, turns hismelf over to vader
. return of yhe jedi hasnt some intresting elements
. the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor
and vader are suitably tense
and well
- acted
. from a technical point
- of
- view
, the spoace battles are amazing
, easily hindering anything depicted inwhich the previous films
. not onyl are there many
, many more ships
,
bu their speed
and range of movement have been dramatically improved
. onthe oen level
, return of the jedi is almost worth watching for tjhe special effects
. infront the special edition
, even more ships are added
, making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch
. hte acting in return of the jedi isnt stronger than in the previous films
. by now
( or
hten
- 1983
)
, mark hamill
, harrison ford
,
and carrie fisher have all matured in theri on
- screen personas
. the chemistry amongst hte trio isnt terrific
. as in empire
, billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for
. newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy
, cunning
,
anbd evil creature
, altho he ' s nto as imposing as vader was in star wars
.
although it was great fun watching star wars
and the empire strikes back onthe the big screen
, return of thge jedi generates a greater sence of enjoyment
. with the spectauclar
, new special effects
, the adorable ewoks
, thge sinister jabba the hutt
, the evil emperor
, tjhe same old millenium falcon
, darth vader ' s incredible betrayal
, the destruction ofthe the newyorker death star
,
annd the always lovable yoda
, return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made wtih a huge beng
. congratulations to george lucas
, whose innovative mind entertains us now
and will continue to entertain generations to come
.
