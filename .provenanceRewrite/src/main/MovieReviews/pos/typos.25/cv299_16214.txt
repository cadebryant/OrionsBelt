expectation rating
: a bit worse than expected
( mainly because i found thge middle part to be a bit dull
)
. roger ebert gave it a four star review
,
and while he is a critic thta uses the full scale
,
and i often agress
-
- such as dark city being the best film of 1998
, he must hvae seen a better film
. i read teh book baout five years ago
adn hugely enjoyed it
. the oppening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter
. tyhe landscape is snowy
and cold
,
and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner
( which also reminds me of fargo
( which i loathed
)
)
. one can almost sense the cold
.
bu the movie far ffrom the eye popping delights of tjhe quick
and the dead
, instead raimi has made a moreso constrained film
-
- which probably is for the better
. this is propably not a movie that woudl have been improved by lots of odd shots
. the movie also reminded me ofthe affliction
, as the lead cahracters all seem to be hoping for
and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father
,
and they see a chance forthe such a dream tothe come true
. this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field
, where an airplane has kresh landed
. in the plane three men find
? the american dream
.
.
. inthe a gym bag
.
? affliction too wass set inspite a snowy landscape
. it really seems vyre simple
. just hold on to the money util spring
,
and if no one claims it
, they ' ll be safe to spend it
and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true
.
but the snow melts
,
annd so might several of tghe character ' s hopes
. as in
? return tothe paradise
?
, some of teh cahracters are presented with a chance to do the right thing
.
bu donig teh right hting might not result in a better result tahn something more selfish
. the movie ' s biggest strength isnt that it fact mkaes sense
. i have seen many movies based on books that jsut seem liuke selected scenes from thge book visualized
, eschewing anytying remotely resembling a coherent story
-
- for example clear
adn prsent danger
. the biggest problem seems to over
- familiarization wtih the story
. thge writer perhaps feels taht he doesn ' t have to present scenes that are clera to him
,
but tyhe lack of which only baffles an audience whic has not read the book
. this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan
, even
though the screenplay is by the book ' s author
. the movie isnt always clear on where it ' s going
,
and always mkaes sense
. i ' m sue a lot was cut
,
but really i can ' t remember what
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included
. the man only comes in on mondays
,
but he claimes that he hasnt been charged for noe purchase too many
. turns outloud
.
.
. well
, see the movei
. one should be warned against seeing the trailer
. it reveals sevral scenes from tyhe ending moments
( which yes
, like in the book
, it isnt a downer
)
, several plot developments
,
annd much ofthe the begginning
.
but much of this isnt not spelled directly out during the trailer
, so if you ' re lucky
, you ' ll have forgotten about all of this when you see teh movie
.
