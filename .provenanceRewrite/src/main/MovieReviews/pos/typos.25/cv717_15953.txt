usance most movies about slavery shield us ffrom the true horrors of what htey ' re portraying
, it ' s fitting tothe say that
" beloved
" come as a real shock as a film
. it ' s confusing
, bizarre
,
and as tough a film tothe watch as any film i ' ve seen all yearm
,
and that ' s not necessarily because of tje three
- hour runing time
.
" beloved
" isnt challenging to watch
, filled with tough
and poverful poetry that takes us completely off guard
,
and instade of a straight
- foward
, hollywood
- ized story about what happened tothe the slaves after htey were freed
,
" beloved
" comes off as a cry ofthe anguish from all those who actually lieved through what happened
( or
, rather
, toni morrison
, who wrote the novel apon which this is based
)
.
" beloved
" tells the story ofthe an ex
- slave named sethe
, played by oprah winfrey
, who lives on a larg farm in the north with her childrens
. wehn the film opens
, her hous is being terrorized by a poltergeist
, which shakes things up
, wounds the dog
,
and makes things generally uncomfortable fo the famaly
. sethe is proud
,
though
,
and will not move
. her sons run away
, leaving only her
and her daughter
, denver
( kimberly elise
) alone with the ghost which is ther without any factual explaination
. a cuple years pass
,
and the ghost remains
,
and one day
, a man named paul d
( danny glover
)
, another ex
- slave who knew sethe yeasr ago whn they worked on a plantation together
, arrives
, asking for lodging
. he has been wandering around since he left the plantation
,
and when he enters the house
, it turns red
and becomes incredibly hot
. when he remarks baout what he thinks is evil
, sethe replies
" it ain ' t evil
. it ' s just sad
.
" some more time passes
,
and paul d has become a fervent member of the household
,
and tjhe ghost dissapears
.
but when they return one day from goign out
, htey discover a young woman sitting in the hous
. her nmae is beloved
,
and as played by thandie newton
, she hasnt allmost zero motor skills
. she stumbles aroud
, half
- grabing onto things
and knocking them over
,
adn when she speaks
, she lets outloud a low guttural sound that eventually turns inot baby talk
. tehy let her into her house
,
and she begins to turn things upside down
.
" beloved
" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost stroy
. most of tyhe scenes consist ofthe people arguing in one claustrophobic
, low
- lit room
, with the occasional flash tothe the past
, where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern
- day psychoanalysts
. sethe
and paul d hve lived through such hellish times thta htey are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the ood plantation
, which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands
, with her nipples being licked
, prompting her to cry out to paul d wehn reminiscing baout it
,
" tehy took my milk
!
" worst ofthe all was tjhe month after her freedom
, when she was allowed to live like a free person
, working with other blacks onthe a farm
,
and
then seing tyhat her old planation owners ahev arrived to presumedly take her
and her childrens back
. she runs to tyhe barn near by
, carrying her four children
,
and when her old owners burst in
, tehy discover she has murdered one of them
and isnt ready to murder tghe rest of them if they don ' t leave them alone
. wehn she is inquired about htis moment by paul d in a moment halfway thru the film
, she syas she doesn ' t regret it
. she killed her daughter so that she would nto ahev to live through tyhe horror she did
,
adn she has conviced herself she doed the right thing
. of course
, beloved isnt really her daugher materialized
,
though we aren ' t flat outloud told thta until later on in tjhe film
. beloved represents the pain
and suffering the slaves went through
and shows how difficult it was forthe them to deel with theri freedom after being tortured for so long
. thus
,
" beloved
" becomes a sorta
- redux of tghe andrei tarkofsky sci
- fi classic
,
" solaris
,
" where a cosmonaut dicovers that his wief
, who commited suicide eyars before
, hasnt materialized when he isnt orbiting over a planet wih a complex brain system
. that film spoke volumes about humanity
anbd our memories
, how we are constantly regretting what happenned in the past
,
and when if it ever literally cameback back tothe haunt us
, it woudl control us completely
.
" beloved
" moves along freely
, without a lot of explanation
,
and for the most part
, tihs is extremely respectable
. the most interesting films are the ones taht don ' t explain everthing fo us
, leaving gaps in the charactors taht we are suppossed to fill in with how tehy ect in the presetn tense
. sethe is never fully explained as a character
,
bu we understand all her actions since she ' s being played by oprah winfrey
. it ' s been well over a decade since her lastr major performence in
" thte color purple
,
"
but judging from these two films
, i ' ll bet she ' s noe of hte best actresses working todya
.
.
. if she was strikely an actress
. her talk sohw
, which i supose is a great entity
, has prevented her ffrom becoming a noteworthy actress
,
and tath ' s a shame because she brings so much to this movie
. emotion
. sadness
. strenght
. watching the strong sethe
, who ' s so affraid of the past tath she ' s builded a rather storng protective coating arround herself
, break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what mkaes tihs movie really great
. she makes it real
. thast ' s not to say htis is a perfect film
. inspite fact
, i ' d wager to say that the fact that it ' s confusing
and painful to watch is waht prevents thsi from being the truly great film it is
. while oprah ' s performance is powerful
and easily sympathetic
(
and i ' m dying tothe see her win at least an oscar nomination this february
)
, the structure of thge film
, which doesn ' t sohw what happened tothe her children till halfway thru the film
, prevents us fomr really making a cohesive conection to the film
. it doesn ' t neccessarily move as
though they ' re memories of oen particular character
,
and by the end
, it has lost control over sethe
,
and as she takes to bed
, we are unable to truly identify with her anymore
.
but despite its tediousness
, perhaps tht ' s the point
. the distancing by the end ofthe the film may be just part of tje way it has been built fomr the start
, sicne tehy figure she has crossed over from being identifiable
,
and it needs tothe get back with reality
.
and forthe the most part
, this film seems like the cry of pain ffrom the slaves thyat it really wants to be
. jonathan demme ' s direction isnt bizarre
, in nature with the story
,
adn he creates the right mood
, making it a tough film to sit through
, making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the charactors
. htere ' s more tothe admire here
, liek the way that the flashbacks pop uv freely
anbd without real organiztion
, just like they would be infront real life
;
adn the way that the endig leaves it somewhat oepn to more pain
and sufferring
,
but laced with a touch ofthe optimism
. tjhe acting
, nto onyl from winfrey
, is amazing
,
and i anticipate nto onyl she iwll git an oscar nomination
. everyone has been raving about thandie newton ' s performence
,
and how it should be rewarded
.
however
, it must be noted thgat out of everyone
, she had tje easiest part
. act like a baby
. throw things
. stumble around
. chew food with your mouth opne
. i do think there ' s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation
,
but it ' s kimberly elise
, as the daugher who hasnt tothe stay sensible
and sane
,
and has to carry the burden of her mother ' s loss of reality towords tghe end
. it ' s not that newton isn ' t great
: she ' s as annoying
and wacky as the role demands
. it ' s jsut that elise has teh tougher job
adn pulls it off even better
. despite the fatc that thsi film hasnt winfrey writed all over it
,
and nto that of writter morrison or director demme
,
" beloved
" hasnt still nto done well
. costing
, i htink
, arround ninety million dollars
, it has usance grossed about twenty
- two
. unfortunately
, thsi film is a little too intense for viewers
, even for me
,
and i can stand almost anything
( i recently viewed the 2 1
/ 2 hour long epic
" caligula
,
" tjhe worst film i have ever seen in my life
,
anbd did it in a mere 2 sittings
)
.
although i respect
" beloved
,
" i cxan ' t sday that i really enjoyed it
.
