" the adventures of felix
" hasnt a number of things gonig for it as we followup felix on his journey ofthe discovery
. frist
and foremost isnt the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix
. he is a likable guy
, fighting his hiv with his doses of
" cocktails
,
"
and ights up the screen as he makes the long walk
, oftenly wih dance

, he grows a little bit more spiritually
anbd emotionally
. bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen
. teh casted of characters making up felix ' s new
- found family are nearly as charming as the star
, each in their pwn way
. patachou
, especially
, is wonderful as hte grandma character
and a kindred spirit to felix
. ariane ascaride
, along with her kids
, gives a perf that realyl mkaes ytou tihkn of her as the sister that the young man never had
. only the
" cousin
" chapter lacks the emotional depth ofthe the rest
and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix ' s
" famaly
.
"
" the adventures of felix
" does not reinvent teh road movie
,
bu it doens provide a charismatic telling of a young man ' s journey to find himself
annd
, to his surprize
, his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning
. it helps tath cinematographer matthieu poirot
- delpech ' s crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside
. i give it a b
