i must say from thte outset thgat i haev never been much of a kurt russell fan
. i ' ve seen some of his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
)
and while he gave adequate performances
, i have never been impressed with his wokr
. breakdown
,
then
, is something of a surprise
. russell gives a fine performance
, as dont most of the cast
, oney that is not upstaged by hte acation orchestrated in the second half ofthe the film
. tothe say that he holds the film together would not be completelyl true
,
but he does it noone harm
. russell plays jeff
, one half of a married cuple travelling with his wief amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross country to san diego to strat a newyorker job
and a new life
. while journeying through the dezert their car breaks down
and
, left helpless
and stranded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers to take them tothe a nearbye diner tothe call for a tow truck
. because of a nasty incident earlier with a cuple ofthe ruffians
, jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help
. that
, it seems
, is thge last time jeff
( or anyone else
) sees her
. breakdown has beeen compared tothe several movies
: george sluizer ' s tje vanishing
( the original
, hopefully
, not his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg ' s duel
adn any number of hitchcock films
. as with these
, breakdown does not
, fo the most part
, stray down thte conventional path ofthe tyhe american action
- thriller
. jeff does not become a gun
- toting vigilante onthe the hunt for his wife
,
bu instade becomes a scared
, confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on
. when we do find out what hasnt happened to amy
, it doens come as a slight disappointment
, if only because it ' s too early in tjhe film
; i for one sould ahve done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery
and bewilderment
,
bu this affects the film little
. russell
, as maintioned earlier
, is veyr good in his role
,
and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as the possibly evil truck driver
, is terrific
; he is one of the best ofthe hte fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn ' t seem to know what tothe do with
,
but director jonathan mostow is onthe the right track here
. tyhe reason he makes such a graet villain is that he actually looks like a real person
, one anyone would be able to trust
, which makes the plot that much more believable
. breakdown isnt what hollywood doesn ' t make anough ofthe
, a great thriller with believeable characters
and scenes that do
, indeed
, ahev viewers on the edge of theri seats
. one ofthe the most genuinely exciting films i ' ve seen infront a long time
.
