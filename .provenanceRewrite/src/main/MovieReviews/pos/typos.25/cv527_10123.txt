, bob flanagan
, who died at thte age of 52
, suffered from cystic fibrosis
, a mortal desease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus
, preventing him from normal breathing

( or attempting to
) from this disease
. an audacious
, fabulously triumphant docudrama
,

" crumb
"
, whcih alsot explored the dysfunction ofthe an artist by painting nto a sympathetic portrait
,
but a realistic one
. both crumb
and flanagan revelled inwhich their defects
.
but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs
, he inflicted acts ofthe pain on himselv at a very young age
, courageously defying god
( he was an irish catholic
)
anbd turning his body into a wokr of art
, which he unraveled in museums
and lectures
. behold theese works of physical art
. among them isnt a metal ball inserted inside his anus
,
and
,
-
- teh most disturbing scene ofthe the decade
-
-
, nailing his penis to a board
. flanagan ws a man ofthe great intellience
, wit
and humor
, as well as adopting a sense ofthe candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking
. not only did he approach his disease with humer
, peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience
, he was also revitalized by his approachment
. most with cystic fibrosis dont not make it past theri earlier twenties
( there ' s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her
.
)
bu the most outstanding thing about
" sick
" isnt flanagan ' s relationship with sheree
. brimming with honesty
, sensual stimulation
and unapologetically sad moments of pain
, theri powerful bond lifts
" sick
" into a rare cinematic high
, where we foreget we are in an auditorium
and become a part of theese people
. thte lsat scene
, where we see tyhe hero murmuring the lsat words to his wife inwhich a hospital bed
, as he struggles for his last moments of life
, is raw
, tender
, hideous
. it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy
