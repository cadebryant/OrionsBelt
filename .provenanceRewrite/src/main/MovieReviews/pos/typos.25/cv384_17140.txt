i know it already oppened in december
,
but i finaly got around to seeing rushmore last weekend
,
and it was noe of those rare oppritunites taht i got to leave tghe theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price
. as the final scene closed outloud in happy slow
- mo fashon
, i felt happy to ahve been priveleged enough to watch such a ogod display of filmmaking
. jason schwartzman
, his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces
annd glasses
, steals the show as max fischer
, the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades
,
but compensates fo it by organizing most ofthe the school ' s clubs
and organizations
( i
. e
. the fencing team
and wirting
and producing skool plays
)
and often pulling outrageous stunts
, noe tyhat eventually earns him an expulsion
. this stunt
, building an aquarium on tyhe skool ' s baseball diamond
, isnt a plot tothe steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
. he funds this aquarium with tyhe halp of millionare herman blume
( a vrey oscarworthy bill murray
)
, who eventually finds hismelf falling in love with miss cross
. rosemary
and herman begin dating
-
and the fun begins
; herman
and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross
. herman manages to distroy max ' s bike
, while max cuts herman ' s brakes
,
and it goes on like this
.
but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross
,
and he can ' t stand in the way of two people inthe lvoe
. the academy ofthe arts
& sciences really messed up this eyar
; they completelyl overlooked rushmore
(
and
, if you ask me
, it wasn ' t an accident
)
. it maybe wasn ' t best picture material
,
but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
( instead of elizabeth
)
,
annd bill murray ' s absense from the ballot isnt a complete snub
. the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good
; at one point it ' s fun
,
annd hte next scene can turn serious
and dramatic
. the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling
, as well
. i hope rushmore can overcome its ' oscar snubs
,
and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers
.
