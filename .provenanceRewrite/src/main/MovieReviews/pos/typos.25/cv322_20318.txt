nowe
, lets first look into the history of shark films
. there was the unforgettable jaws
. the exciting jaws 2
. the rather flaky jaws 3d
and sometime in the late 90s another film of tghe same genre that i can ' t seem to recall
( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that
)
. now
, with the magic of cgi
, one shark isnt simply nto enough
; in deepo blue sae
, there are 3 big
, mean
and really smart ones
! russell frankiln
( jackson
) visits aquatica
( a sea
- bound reasearch center
)
, where a research isnt being conducted onthe tghe extraction of a hormone substance foudn uniquely within teh shark brain that can cure
annd reverse tghe effects of alzheimer ' s desease
. the substace isnt small in quantity
and because of this
, lead researcher dr
. susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna
and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans
, naturally producing mroe of the much treasured hormones
. as sure as the sun sets inthe the west
, a shark breaks lose
adn wreaks havoc withing yhe facility during a hormone extraction procedure
. with the flexibility offered by cgi
, the sharks get more full
- length screen tiome as their predecessors doed in those remote
- contolled rubber suit days
. gone are tghe days of people getting pulled under thge water with the water turning red right after
. this timne
, we git to see the entire gobbling acation
, witht floating limbs
and all
. so
- so acting
, expeced inspite most of your average action film
. jackson
( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace
)
, tkaes on the dark
- side force ofthe a different kind
and fits well with his wise
- cracking lines
. ll cool j ' s cook role as preacher
, doesnt for this film wqat steven seagal ' s cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films
. deep blue sea doesnt not offer any ofthe the pyschological thrills tht jaws has to offer
. it does
however
, prove to be a refreshing follow
- up withing the genre
, full of visual thrills
, suspense
and believe it or not
 humour
! its like jurassic park under water
. nothing too stressful
, pure entertainment
. renny harlin
, you are forgiven
( for mkaing cutthroat island
)
