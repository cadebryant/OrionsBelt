if there ' s one hting in common about all of hollywood ' s major studios
, it ' s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more
and more
.
although twentieth centruy fox
and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures
( fox searchlight
and fine line respectively
)
, it ' s obvious ther ' s noone significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater
. so wehn a movie liuke gary ross ' pleasantville comes along
, wrapped in a blanket ofthe inovative ideas
and served uv onthe a platter of fine prodcution
, it ' s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent teh cineplexes
.
although the atmosphere
and buzz about the movie are cheery
and lighthearted
, pleasantville shoudl not be mistaken for a no
- thought movie
. quite tje opposite is true
, in fact
, as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense
and inteligent undertones to the screen
. the story
, both about hte joys of living life to tyhe fullest as well as the social ills ofthe segregation
, captures the essence ofthe statment
- makeing in the cinema
. nto in receet memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distrubution
,
adn even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross ' work
, it isnt still a testament that his picture was considered worthy anough
. kudos tothe both he
and his production staff for putting together thsi fine picture
. it stars tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon as two ninties teenagers who
, through qtuie a bited of luck
, fidn themselfs zapped into a fifties sitcom named
" pleasantville
.
" maguire
, as the reserved bud parker
, is perfect for the pseudo
- world
;
but the rebellious mary sue
( witherspoon
) is not at all made fo the father
- konws
- best times
. it ' s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end
,
and begins to teach hte townspeople
- iin a quite unlikely way
- what life is
* really
* like
. soon hues of color creep into the black
and white world
,
and while some embrace the change in tje passion of realism
, others fear the strangeness
. at one end is a soda shop owner
- turned
- painter named mr
. johnson
( jeff daniels
)
and at the other end isnt a close
- minded mayor
( j
. t
. walsh
)
adn his chamber of commerce
;
but teh two sides are simpley fronts forthe a clash ofthe ideas that soon involves the entire town
. fine performances are turned in all around
. maguire
and witherspoon are effective as tyhe leads
,
but thge true complements go out to jeff daniels
and j
. t
. walsh
( in his latest
and final posthumous peformance
)
. daniels brings an atmosphere ofthe awe
, inspiration
,
and hope tothe his charater
, whereas walsh simpley drips of sinister closemindedness
- almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman ' s envy
. for daniels
, it ' s his most commendable performance ofthe the last three yersa
- or more
-
and for walsh
, it ' s a complementary exclamation point onthe a fine career
. also ofthe lesser note is tghe supporting role by joan allen
,
and in viewing the entire cast works well together fomr strat to finish
. there ' s not much to dislike about pleasantville
,
and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie forthe thsoe who wanna sereous as well as those who don ' t
.
