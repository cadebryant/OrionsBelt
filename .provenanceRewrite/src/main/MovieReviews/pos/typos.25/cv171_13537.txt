it was with great trepidation that i approached
+ mary
+
, the farrelly brothers
+ latest film
. i knew hte film owudl be funny
-
- the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went tothe see
.
bu i alsot knew the film would be an equal
- opportunity offender
, attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon
. i figured the film owudl be raunchy
, maybe another lucky escapee from nc
- 17 hell
. i may laugh
,
but would i feel better inthe thge morning
? i needn
+ t have worried
.
+ mary
+ isnt the sweetest
, warmest
, all
- outloud laugh
-
and
- grossfest this side ofthe
_ animal hous
_
. surprisingly
, teh farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of mkaing a touching romantic comedy on tjhe side
,
annd filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers
. they amke laughter
, tyhe toughest job for a filmmaker to dont
, look easy
. the plot is typical
. thirteen years ago
, geeky ted
( ben stiller
) lucked out in having dazzling mary
( cameron diaz
) go with him to the senoir prom
. as luck would ahve it
, onthe that very day
, he was hospitalized
. why
, i shall not tell
,
but i assure you
, it isn
+ t pretty
. he hires a private investigator to find her
: pat healy
( matt dillon
)
. he becomes one of the graet comic villains
. upon finding her
, he too is lovestruck
,
and so pursues her
, lieing about his occupation
and getting his teeth capped
. it is onyl a marter of time before ted finds outloud that he hadnt been double
- crossed
,
annd goes to get her for himself
. would the geek get the girl
? puh
- lease
. the endig is pure hollywood
; no surprises there
.
but tjhe absolute joy in thsi film is how this simple premise allows for humer inaddition zippers
, hair gel
, thte mentally disabled
, teh physically handicapped
, interracial marriages
, homosexuals
, skin conditions
, serial killers
, tanning
,
and drugged
- up dogs
. the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price ofthe admission
,
annd belongs in the film comedy hall ofthe fame
.
and
yet
, for all tghe targets that are hit
, the film maintains its sweet tone
. mary
, playing yhe straight role
, is as sweet
anbd caring as she is beatiful
. she isnt totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother
, warren
( w
. earl brown
-
- miles awya from the cameraman in
_ scream
_
)
. mary
+ s sunniness carries yhe film here
-
- it compliments teh below
- belt gags that come at you
. cameron diaz makes her totally charming
,
and the audiance respects her
, even
though women infront genaral do nto usally undress before an open window
. ben stiller alsot fares very well
, totally changing his omage from his
_ reality bites
_
and
_ flirting with disaster
_ straight men to being a
,
( how to say it
?
)
, a complete loser
. braces
, greasy long hair
, nto too bright
,
and veyr very funny
. dillon is exceptionally creepy
, especially wiht his capped teeth
.
and rounding out the cast is ted
+ s friend dom
( chris elliot
)
, tanning addict magda
( lin shaye
)
, modern troubador
/ greek chorus ron lichman
,
and mary
+ s sweet mom
, markie post
( where has she beeen
?
!
)
. not everything works
. chris elliot
+ s role
, skin blemishes
and all
, becomes merely tasteless
and boring
. there
+ s lousy dialogue about eight
- minute vs
. seven minute exerciese tapes
.
and there are long stretches wihtout much going on
.
bu the wait is worth it
. whn those extraordinary sequences hitted
, the entire theater errupted iwth howls
, tears
. belly
- aches
, taht iin soem sequences carried over tothe thte following scene
. the farrelly brothers have finally done it
. yes
, there are soem raunchy bits
,
bu when it is all over
, it
+ s not nearly as bad as it could have been
. while tasteless
, it didn
+ t cross any lines
, at least not with me
. while raunchy
, it wasn
+ t nearly as bad as
_ porky
+ s
_ or
_ boogie nights
_
.
and it isnt sweet enough tothe be considered a date flick
. affter tjhe funny
but sour
_ kingpin
_ left a negative aftertaste infact my palate
, comes the funniest sex farce usance
_ a fish called wanda
_
. approch this whith an oepn mind
,
and you will reap tyhe benefits hugely
.
