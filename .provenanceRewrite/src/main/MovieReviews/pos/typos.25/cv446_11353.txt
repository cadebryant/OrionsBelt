" desperate measures
" was something i was excited about seeing bcak when it ws originally scheduled to be released
: summer ' 97
. fo some reason
, it was delayed until hollywood ' s traditional dumping ground
: january
. now that it ' s out
, i see noone real reason forthe thgat delay
, as it ' s a simple
yet highly entertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who ' s bone marrow cin save the life ofthe the dieing son of a san francisco polical detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees to the transplant
, only so he can attempt escape
. he succeeds
, inthe a plan that ofthe course could onyl wrok in the movies
. the police force is now trying to kill keaton
, while garcia isnt wokring agains them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son
. the film definately has it ' s flaws
. the plot is strictly tv movie ofthe the week fare
,
but the acting
and direction certainly boost it far above taht status
. also
, after keaton ' s escape
, garcia ' s captain barks at him
" how many men have tothe die to save your kid ' s life
?
" which the film treats as such an evil
and insignificant remark
. the hting is
, it ' s a vaild point
. how many people have to be needlessly crippled
, burned
,
and killed jsut to sive this one child
? what ' s the greater good here
? many lives or one life
? if movies really had guts nowadays
, i would ahev loved to have seen this movei come down to a final choise for garcia ' s charactor
. palce him in a situation where he knows that he hasnt tothe kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone eles
. alas
, movies theese dyas generaly ahve no such ambition to pull thte audeince ' s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable
. dispite a few silly moments
(
annd one or two really stupid ones
)
, the good things baout
" desperate measures
" outnumber the bad
. tjhe main highlight would be keaton ' s performance
. the character coudl have easily been an overacting
, scene chewing freak
,
bu keaton underplays it nicely
. he ' s nto as menacing as he ws inthe
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he was inaddition
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman used to be a dark character
)
,
but yuo certainly get the idae that he ' s evil
. even the final scene of thge film
, whitch normally i woudl just hite
, seems strangely appropriate for this film
. so much so that i didn ' t mind it inthe the slightest
.
annd another bonus
: the film takes place in san francisco
, which usally means a car chase on those hills that you ' ve seen a billion times before
.
and for a moment
, it looked as
though it was about to happen
.
but it doesn ' t
,
and tyhat ' s creative
.
