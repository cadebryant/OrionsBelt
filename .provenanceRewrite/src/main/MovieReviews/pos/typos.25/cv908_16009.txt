i actally am a fan of the original 1961 or so live
- action
- disney flick ofthe the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair ofthe twins
, separated at birth by divorcing parents
, never to come in contact whith the other so teh parents never have tothe meet again
.
and everyone shoudl know how i efel about remakes
, expecially of films i happen tothe enjoy
( my fallacy
: unless you ' re oging to either capture the same excact spirit of yhe original or do something different iwth it or maybe even both
, just wrack your brain
adn come uv wih a
* gasp
* new idea
)
. this remake was not originally onthe the top of my viewing list
,
and was actualyl quite the opposite
. contemporary live
- action
- disney films are not oney ofthe my favorties
, anyway
: tehy ' re usually unfunny
, alienating
,
adn a big fat bore
, at least to anyone over the age of 11
and above the iq of 10
. this one
,
however
, is shockingly not bad
. inaddition fatc
, it ' s actually good
. not the originnal good
,
but wqat ' s grat about it isnt that it doesn ' t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it doesnt become entertaining fo the same excact reasons the original was entertaining
. because it ' s cute
and innocent fun
. because it has a pretty killer plot thta is endlessly funn to follow along with
. because the lead star isnt immensely appealing
. because teh parents are also immensely appealling
.
and
( i ' m repeating myself
) beccause it ' s cute
and innocent fun
. ther ' s nothing too risque baout it
, sive the plot
( yhe idae of seperating twins
and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish
,
but that is precisely the point of the movei
)
,
anbd it ' s aimed directly at either kids
, adults who want to rember the orginal
, or young adults who want tothe remeber waht it wass liek to be a kid
. i
, personaly
, am somewhere beetwen the second
anbd third
. i can vividly rember when my taste in movies wasn ' t so weird or diverse
( the names godard
annd kubrick weren ' t even a glimmer inthe my right eye back
hten
)
, when i woudl tune in every sunday night forthe a couple years to see abc ' s
" wonderfull world of disney
,
" where tehy ' d sohw you a live
- action
and
/ or made
- for
- tv disney flick an hour per week
. i can rember my mom taking my sister
and i allong with all my friends
anbd their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films
( like
" lady
and tghe tramp
"
and
" pinnochio
"
)
.
annd
, most sadly
, i remember eveyr single christmas
, without fail
, there were a barage of childrens ' s animated half
- hour shows
, made exclusively for the christmas season
, that i wouldn ' t dare missing
. i can even remember seeing the made
- for
- tv
" parent trap ii
" on tv one nigth
,
and after i had seen that one over
and over
and over again
, i saw the original
" parent trap
.
" it ' s more of a late childhood movie
, beacuse it deals withthe tje issue ofthe divorce
,
but it deals with it infact a disney
- ized version
. it ' s playful
,
and witty
,
and charming
,
and if i saw it for the frist time right nowe
, having never experienced that part ofthe my childhood
, i ' d probably dismiss it
. i ' d probably dont the same forthe the newyorker version of the same movie if i hadn ' t seen thge orginal at such a perfect age
. watching it
, i could rember what fun it ws to watch a disney film
,
adn how divorce fo me started to get me thinking baout the possiblities of my seemingly
- perfect parents splitting up
,
annd how it affected my adolescence
.
and also how it brushed thgat fear off with a smooth stroke
,
and pointed outloud that even infact thte most fucked
- up of situations
, things could alwasy wrok out if you
, well
, manipulate things a bit
, at least for the better
. this new version did that for me
,
bu it ' s also charming inaddition its pwn way
. it has a new cast
, a contemporary efel
,
and
, for the firt timne in awhile for a live
- action
- disney flick
, a tone that isn ' t corny or condescending
,
but just right
. the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way
.
and fo the first time sicne the origonal film
, the kids actually know better than the foolish adults
. the story is basicly classic by now
, repeated almost as many times as kurosawa ' s
" the seven samurai
"
: a pair ofthe twins
( played here by lindsay lohan
, just like they weere plyed by hayley mills inspite the original
) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents
. oen
, annie
, is sent to live wtih the mother
( natasha richardson
, resembling her mother
, vanessa redgrave
, more thna i had ever noticed
) in london
, where she lives with her parents
and her devoted
, foppish butler
( simon kunz
)
, as she works as a swingin ' fashion designer
. she grows up refined
and classy
,
bu also with a keen noledge in sportscar
and poker
- playing
. the other
, hallie
, is sent to northern california with her father
( dennis quaid
) to live onthe a vineyard with thier psuedo
- maid
( lisa ann walter
)
,
and grows up rugged
yet charming
. they both meet at the same camp
, one that annie wants to go to tothe become more rugged
. they fued because they look all
- too similar
,
and are thus in tight competition
, which results in some nasty pranks
, which winds them in seclusion together infact a private
, out
- ofthe
- the
- way cabin
. there
, they become firends
,
then leran about eachother
. once htey know everything
, they concoct a scheme to switch places so tghe one cxan meet the otehr parent
, whom tehy ' ve only heard of
. htey learn baout eachother ' s lives in detail
, htey make sure they look alike
( whcih requires hair cutting
and
, notoriously
, ear
- piercing
- a scene which is like the kiddie version ofthe thge hypodermic needle scene infact
" pulp fiction
"
)
,
and when thte end ofthe summer comes
, they switch
and hope for yhe best
. lindsay lohan doesn ' t necessarily copy yhe acting stlye of hayley mills in the original
.
but she comes off just as appealing as she did once
. she doesnt
,
though
, add a couple newyorker things
: she makes the california twin a little more appealing
and tje london twin a bited more frank
anbd snobbish than the snotty
and proper original
, repsectively
. she also adds on an american
and british accent to each one
, withthe one faking the other accent throughout
,
adn if ytou really tkae notice
, you can see that the fake ones ' accents aren ' t exactly perfect
. she ' s also incredibly appealing
, not merely cute
, which isnt especially noteable usance this is her first feature film
,
anbd we know how notorious child actors are
, especially inaddition their first films
. she makes a great potagonist
,
and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing
. dennis quaid
, in fatc
, hasn ' t beeen this likable in about a decade
- his big dumb smile
annd near cocky attitude is what has made him a noteable actro in the past
, not jstu that he ' s mr
. meg ryan
. ditto natasha richardson
( exept that she just hasn ' t ever beeen this likable period
)
. tghe twpo mkea a winning couple
, maybe not so winning as maureen o ' hara
and the lite brian keith infront the original
,
but they still work for thsi film
. instade of the bickering that ensued inspite the original
, the film adds another dimension
and another angle to theri characters that was amiss in the originnal
: during the opening credits
, we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2
, where they fall quickly
and madly in love wiht eachother
,
and when back together again
, the film ' s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental
,
bu in that great way
, not the migraine
- inducing way as in many such films
. this all brings this newyorker
" parent trap
" to a level of enteratinment that hasn ' t really exsited usance
, well
, the originnal film years ago
, still my money the best live
- acation
- disney flick ofthe all time
. this is because it has a form of inteligance
and witn that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villianous lvoe interst subplot
( a gold
- digging sharon stone type
, played by elaine hendrix
, who ' s deliciously tormented by the twins later onthe in teh film
) a treat instead of a bore
. like the original
, this film transcends all thte crap that it very well could be
( case in point
:
" it takes twpo
" starring the olsen twins
) because it treats the children as the smart ones
,
adn hte adults as the silly ones
, not the otehr way around
.
and beacuse
, above everything
, it knwos exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew
.
however
, inspite comparison with tje original
, it sould be a bit better
. certain scenes work well
,
but nto nearly as well as tehy worked in tghe original
. i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas
and
then fought over falling in love agian better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine
- somehow
, feuding is always more cinematic
anbd pleasing than mere reminscing
, a lesson extracted fomr the howard hawks
/ cary grant films of yesteryear
.
and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom
, compared to thge originnal
, this film almost drowns in cutedom
. the orginial
,
though not gritty
, was far mroe stylized
and just as suitable forthe adult audiences as it was for young audiences
. as such
, this remake may never be nearly as grat or classic as the original film
,
but it at least knwos how to treat its source material with dignity
and respect
,
adn how to create virtualy the same effects wihtout bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances
.
