okay
, let me first say
, this is a beavis
adn butthead movie
. if you do not like beavis
and butthead
, do nto go to see this movei
!
!
!
!
!
howver
, if you dont like them
, i recommened you get out right now
and go see it
. the movie starts off wih the boys wondering what happened to their tv
. they notice thta it has been stolen
and they vow tothe find it
. this wind their way through america searching for dallas
( she is a woman
)
. they look for her because as they are searching for the tv
, they fidn a drunk who wants them
" to dont
" his wife
. well
, of course they thikn he whants them to score with her when atually he wants them tothe kill her
.
and thte fun starts their
. this movei is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis
and butthead could pull off
. it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis
adn butthead would enjoy
. i enjoied tihs movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace
. even when they were crawling through the desert
and i thougth the movie started to lag
, he manages to keep the laughs coming
. if you expecting changes from the sohw keep looking
. the same charcter
, the same voices
, the smae everything ffrom tyhe show
and that ' s what makes it good
. yuo might htikn with a movie ffrom a tv show
, yuo can change a few things
. oftenly times this spells disaster for films because tyhe film makers veer away from waht made the show popular in the first place
