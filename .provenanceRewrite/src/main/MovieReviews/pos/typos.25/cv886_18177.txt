bob the hapyp bastard ' s quickie review
: thge mummy brendan fraser ' s stuck in the past again
,
but at least thsi time he has something better to dont than to quote sitcom lines
annd try to woo alicia silverstone
.
.
. fraser isnt the lead star of the mummy
, the second directorial effort ffrom action director stephen sommers
( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that ws deep rising
)
. it ' s a rough adaption of teh 1932 film
,
and i say rough becouse it focusses omre on special effects than on smoe guy in bandages
, like boris karloff was engulfed inaddition
.
but who cares
, tje movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it ytou can ' t get from
, oh
, say
, godzilla or armageddon
. fraser plays a solider who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground
. basically
, it ' s a littel sign from the mummy buried underneath
- a priest named ihmoetep who ws buried alive for taking part ofthe mudering the king
and making out withthe his mistress
. his plan
- wake back up
and wake her uv also
, makeing him invincible
. ofthe course
, fraser returns to thte site years later with a librarian
( rachel weisz
)
and her brother
( john hanna
)
, along with a former buddy of his
( deep rising ' s kevin j
. o ' connor
)
anbd some
" americans
"
.
.
.
and guess what
? yup
, ihmoetep
( arnold vosloo
) awakens
annd wreaks havoc
. fire flies from the sky
, flesh
- eating beetles crawl about
,
and
, well
, ihmoetep ' s plan beigns to unfold
. ok
, so it ' s not really all that new a story
,
bu the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough
. the special effects ffrom industrial light
and magic are top notch
,
and the acting fomr fraser
and weisz isn ' t half bad either
. teh acation isnt pretty intense
( favorite scene
: the sandstorm
)
and there are a few shocking scenes just tothe jolt you horror
- loving folks as well
. no
, it ' s no phantom menace beater
,
but if ytou ' re looking fo a solid warm
- up to the summer movie season
, you won ' t fidn a better film under wraps thna the mummy
. if this doesn ' t give fraser forgiveness fomr blast ffrom the past
annd encino man
,
thne nothing will
.
