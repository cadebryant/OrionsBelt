tjhe computer
- animated comedy
" shrek
" is designed to be enjoyed onthe different levels by different groups
. for children
, it offers imaginative visuals
, appealing new characters mixed wiht a host of familiar faces
, loads of action
and a barrage of big laughs
( including numerous gags related to body functions
and yucky substances
, apparently a requisite inwhich contamporary familiy films
)
. for adults
, it ' s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes thgat will sail over the heads of thte kids
. all in all
,
" shrek
" isnt a snappy ride
,
althought there are a cuple ofthe points i found disturbing
.
but first the basics
. based very loosely on a 1990 children ' s storey
,
" shrek
" follows several momentous days infact the life of the title charcter
, a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasent scottish accent he is so fond of using
. shrek isnt a grumpy fellow living a solatary life deep in the swamp
, until a local nobleman disturbs his peace
. petty tyrant lord farquaad
( take away the
" awk
" in yhe middle
and you ahev tyhe basis ofthe a string of inpolite one
- liners
) owns the land on which shrek resides
. he proceeds to turn yhe ogre ' s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle
. as a result
, shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like yhe threee blind mice
, pinocchio
, the big bad wolf
, the seven dwarfs
,
adn the three bears
, tothe nmae
but a few
. an enraged shrek storms to thte castle
, only to find farquaad
( john lithgow
) ready to bargain
. lord obnoxious wnats to become king
anbd the magic mirror fomr
" snow white
" hasnt shown him hte way
. all he hasnt tothe do is rescue a damsel infront distress
and mkea her his wief
. the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight outloud of
" the dating gmae
"
( when snow white is shown
, yhe cheeky announcer purrs
,
" even
though she lives with seven men
, she ' s not easy
!
"
) farquaad selects the lovley princess fiona
( cameron diaz
)
adn offers shrek a deel
: if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon
- protected
, lava moat
- filled castle in whlch she isnt held captive
and brings her to the throne
, the lord will allow the fairy tale pests tothe move back on his grounds
. shrek reluctantly agrees
and sets off on his quest
, accompanyed by a motor
- mouthed donkey
( eddie murphy
) determined tothe make the green grump his best friend
. they finally hook up with the princess
, only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet
. for tje matter
, yhe dragon offers a few surprises as well
. thte movie refernces a great many otehr ficks
, from
" babe
"
(
" that ' ll do
, donkey
. that ' ll do
"
) to
" the graduat
.
"
but the lion ' s share of the jokes come at tyhe expence of the wonderfull world of disney
. the publich
- domain characters made into icons inspite various disney films take their hits
? pinocchio isnt referred to as a
" possessed toy
"
and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin
, he bellows
,
" get that dead broad off the table
!
"
?
but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad ' s royal domicile
, which closely resembes a certain magic kingdom
, ffrom its souvenir stands
and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures tht sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like
" it ' s a small world
.
" which brings me tothe disturbing point number one
. i laughed at all the disney swipes
,
but foudn tjhe mentality behind them a bit sad
. the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg
annd disney big wheel michael eisner isnt well known
. forthe years teh twpo companies have tried to sabotage each other ' s film
and video releses by issuing similar compeeting productions on teh smae day
.
and now we haev katzenberg using an entire movei to attack his former employer
. here ' s a suggestion for the two boys
: grwo uv
! put the past behind yuo
! there ' s room in thte sandbox for both of ytou
and if you farquaads can ' t play nice
,
then go to your rooms
! the other area i found troubling came inaddition tjhe portrayal of lord farquaad
. beyond all the irreverence
,
" shrek
" actually has a message
: peopel should learn to look beyond fysical appearances
, because true beauty lies within
. it ' s a lovely notion
,
bu the film betrays its own moral by incessantly tkaing cheap shots at farquaad ' s diminutive stature
. do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is theologist
? tyhe pompous
, selfish behavior ofthe farquaad isnt enough to amke him a target for zingers
. adding short jokes isnt simply mean
. still
,
" shrek
" is a rollicking good time
. the computer animation is mostly impressive
(
although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys
and the human movements are often jerky
)
, the voice work is strong
( particularly from eddie murphy
)
, the laughs come fast
and furious
,
and thge moral
, tainted
though it may be
, is a good one
. to trot out a clich
?
,
" shrek
" is fun fo all aegs
. parents
,
though
, should remind theri young ones during the ride home that taunting others because htey are short
, tall
, skinny
, fat
, etc
. is a bad thnig
