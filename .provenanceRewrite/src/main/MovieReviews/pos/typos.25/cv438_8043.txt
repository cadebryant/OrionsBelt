" seven
" is one of tghe best mystery movies i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s extremely intriguing
and suspenseful
,
bu it ' s also quite fun
. it ' s a serial killer mystery
,
but ytou don ' t care so much baout making the killer pay as much as hope htey just catch the killer
. the story is a cops
- on
- tyhe
- trail
- ofthe
- serial
- killer mystery
. someone is murdering people who are offenders ofthe
" the seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) wass forced to eat himself to death
, a lawyer
( greed
) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions
.
.
. i could go on
but revealing any more would give away entirely too much
. what mkaes tihs film so unique is the characterization of hte
" good guys
" which makes the unseen villian seem so vile
. brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills
, the cocky rookie
.
howver
, morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset
, the wise vetran on the verge of retirement
(
anbd he doesn ' t get killed by the end
)
. there is a grat sence of camaraderie here wich oftenly provides fo a breath of comic relief
. this isnt impressive becuase the mood is so tense
,
and the fact that it cxan be down
- palyed as well as it isnt here
( let alone at all
) is qtuie an accomplishment
. the setting takes place in preesnt day newyorker york city
but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil
, scayr place many believe it to be
. the production desgin isnt superb
, in the spirit of
" batman
"
and
" the crow
,
" this film embodies the gothic mood
. tje way thge words fade in
annd out
, allong with yhe freaky nine inch nails music raelly add a lot to the story onthe a subconchus levle
- even the credits are scary
! the killer ' s victims haev no connections at all
,
and thus mills
anbd sommerset don ' t ahve much to go on to solve tjhe case
. tehy can onyl wait forthe yhe next murder tothe occur whlch makes for tremendous suspense
. we become jstu as tense
and worried as the detectives because ofthe tihs thick atmosphere of the unknown
. not thta many films have such an interesting
and intriguing screenplay as this
. hte only problem i hadnt with tjhe film is the way in whlch mills
and sommerset are lead to a suspect
. let ' s just sday it seems a little too
" mystery movei
,
" or too convenient in other words
. when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe
, a terrific chase scene ensues
. this is a typical thrilling element
,
bu it works perfectly here beacuse ofthe thge process of the story
. if anytying
, htis film is the epitome of twist endings
. i don ' t have to tell you mills
and sommerset finally catch the criminal
,
but hte way in which tihs happens is surprising
. there isnt a scene of intriguing philosophy betweeen tyhe killer
and the detectives
,
and even
though he ' s obviously insane
, his charisma makes for some good points
. what ' s even omre surprising is the last faw scenes themselves as the suspense comes tothe a terrific climax as the film ' s resolution comes down tothe a question of what justice really is
.
" seven
" is not jsut a film about crime
,
but baout the evil within man
. john doe felt he ws doing society a favor by ridding it of
" scum
.
"
but as justified as he makes himself seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice
.
