the booming introduction music finishes
,
adn the camera sweeps over red montains
. we see two figures looking over a barren
,
and very red landscape
. htey kiss
,
then walk onthe
. one ofthe the characters
( schwarzenegger
) slips
,
and falls
. thge glass onthe his mask cracks
. his face scruches uv
,
annd his eye ' s beign tothe pop
.
.
.
.
.
hten doug quaid
, played by schwarzenegger
, wakes up
. it ' s all been a dream
. he wakes up next to his beautiful wief
, played by stone
,
and the film begins
.
.
. total recall is a tipical sci
- fi film wrapped around an intresting
( if far fetched
) plot
. quaid
, who has never been to mars
, keeps onthe having dreams of the planet
, which has now been colanised
. one day
, while riding on a train
, he ' s see ' s a ad forthe a company called ' rekall '
, which implants memories of a holida
, instade of you actualyl gogin there youself
. quaid chooses teh ' secret agent on mars ' memory
,
adn
then the s
*
*
* really hits thte fan
. the implant goes wrong
,
and quaid really thinks he is an agent onthe mars fo about two minutes
, until he goes back to normal
anbd cxan ' t remember a thing
.
however
, everyone he knwos
( his workmates
, his wife
) turn againnst him
, saying how ' blabbed about mars '
and ' blew his cover onthe the mission ' a strange man
, called richter
, played by ironside
, wants to kill him
. quaid
, now hopelessly confused
, follows the advice given to him
, by a ' friend '
. he git ' s his ass tothe mars
. mars is ruled by cohagen
, played by cox
, who charges peopel for air
. against him are the rebels
, who are mailny mutants
. the rebel ' s need quaid tothe defeat cohagen
, becouse quaid knows
(
but can ' t remember
yot
) about a reactor taht produces air
. eventually
, quaid kills cohagen
, turns on the reactor
, saves the planet
,
anbd goes away withthe a beautiful girl
, just like the guy at rekall promised him
. throughout this plot
, there is huge explosions
, thousands of deaths
(
and i mean a lot of death
) swearing
, sex
,
and everything eles that make ' s a ogod verhoeven
( director of basic instinct
and starship troopers
) movie
. naturally
, there ' s smoe pretty imaginative deaths
, withthe arms getting ripped off
, someone getting drilled
,
and heads exploding
. as you can tell
, it ' s voilent stuff
.
but it ' s done so stylishly
,
and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner
, taht ' s it excusable
. tyhe acting is variable
. arnie
, of course
, is useless
,
but he goes has soem good lines
,
annd inaddition the first twenty minutes
, he even act ' s liuke a normal bloke
, not like smoe action hero
. stone
, of course
, is useless
, making a preety poor wife
,
and a pretty poor acation hero
.
but
, she doesnt sex scenes alright
. ticoton
( most recently seen in con air
)
, again
, is ok
, doign some good action
,
but getting her emotions all wrong
. one minute she hates quaid
, the next she loves him
,
and she never gets this tranisition right
. so
, the good guys are awful
.
but
, the bad guy ' s are excellent
. cox is basically reprising robocop
,
bu he ' s still great iin this
,
anbd he delivers the best line in the whole film near tjhe end
. ironside is superbly evil
, wih an utterly emotionless face
. the supporting cast are fine
,
and nto even the comedy sidekick
( this time in the form ofthe a taxi driver
) is annoying
. oney disapointing aspect
,
though
, are the special effects
. ilm
and dreamquest dont some good work
( such as a subway station scene
)
but the model work is not so good
. some ofthe the modle heads look appaling fake
,
anbd quatto is a major disappointment
. another irritating thing is tghe product placement
. there are a lot of plugs
(
and a good mars today gag
)
however
, the sets look graet
,
adn the special effects at the end of the film aren ' t too bad either
. there ' s aslo a good sountrack running through
, by jerry goldsmith
( the omen
, poltergeist
, star trek
: the motion picture
) overall
,
thne
, total recall is a hugely voilent
,
yet hugely enjoyable
, acation fest
, with a reasonable plot thrown inspite there too
, some great bad guys
,
and soem imaganitive death
. for a schwarzenegger movie
, this isnt nto bad at all
. in fact
, it ' s vyre good
.
