doed ytou ever wonder if dennis rodman ws actually from this planet
? or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra
- terrestrial
? i used tothe htink that about my 7th grade english teacher
, ms
. carey
.
but after seing thsi movei
, htey may ahve confirmed my suspicions
. as the story goes
, at any time
, there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth
. the men in black
( mib
) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens
, guardians of our beloved planet from nasty
- tempered aliens
,
and secret service tothe the stars
. based in new york city
( where weird is the norm
)
, the mib organization gives human form tothe our space
- faring emigrants so that they may walk
and live amonst us unnoticed
.
but to enforce the laws of earth
, the mib carry weapons that are powerfull enough to meet or excede distruction quotas in oen single blast
. they carry other
- worldly technology to erase people ' s short
- term memmory when common folk see yhe mib infact action
.
and their best leads on cosmic things
- gone
- awry are the supermarket tabloids
. littel do we nkow that ther are much stronger battles of good v
. evil going on in the depths of space
. one of thte aliens
- as
- human on this planet is an importamt diplomat that isnt carrying something very prescious
. it holds the ' key '
, litterally
, to univeral peace
. a giant cockroach
- like alien soon arrives on the planet
and steals htis ' key '
. in the wrong alien hands
( flippers
? mandibles
? tenacles
?
)
, it cin be used as a weapon
. therfore
, it must be recovered
and returnd to it ' s rightful owners
. otherwise
, to ensure univeral saftey
, earth will be destroyed
, along with the ' key '
. nowe
, it ' s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe
. the mib aggenst on the case are
" k
"
, palyed by tommy lee jones
. he is crustier than burnt toast
and even more serious than al gore
. the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder iin his eyes
. he is accompanied by a flippant rookie
,
" j
"
, plyed by will smith
.
but
, despite this shoot
- em
- uv
, protect
- earth
- from
- destruction premise
, this isnt nothing at all like a typical summer acation movei
.
anbd
, this isn ' t an independence day knockoff
. rather
, this isnt a stylishly offbeat sci
- fi comedy that pokes funn at wqat the government always denies
? that there are real aliens taht live here
,
and that the government does its darndest to cover them up
.
but tothe give it soem sense of excitement
and to keep it within hte parameters ofthe the summer movei recipe
, there must be some kind of earth
- hangs
- in
- the
- balance scenario
.
yet
, thsi movei is very appealling
. the abundance of wierdness
( tlaking aliens
, pee
- wee atomizers
, a mortician who ' lives ' for her work
,
adn lots of yucky bugs
annd slime
- splattering galore
)
, isnt palyed straight
, like as if this were normal
( of course
, we are in nyc
)
. it gives it a deadpan feel
, which makes it all the more funnier
and odder
. jones plays yhe vunerable seen
- it
- all agent with seriousness
and maturity
. smith is likeable
and mkaes a great comic partner to jones ' straight man routine
. they click like dorothy ' s ruby red shoes
. the look
and fiel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld
( the addam ' s family
)
. this guy hasnt a knack for ' gothic ' comedy
,
and succesfuly transfers his macabre sense ofthe humor onto the screen
.
and
, an appropriate dose of speshal effects helps to bolster the oddness of thier task without diverting attention from tyhe human actors
. the story moves well
,
anbd before ytou know it
, the end credits are already rolling
! the result is 100 minutes worth ofthe fun in thte form of ewwwws
and blechhhs
, aaaahhhs
and wows
. let the men in balck protect
and color your world
.
