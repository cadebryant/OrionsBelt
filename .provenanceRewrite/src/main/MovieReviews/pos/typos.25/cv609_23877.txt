a group of high skool kids mix up with a group ofthe hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives to dicover why todya ' s youth seem attracted to black culture
. the review if black
& white
, the new film from writer
/ director james toback
, is eventually remembered for only one thing
, it will be the revelation that brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples
and mike tyson can act
.
however
, this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that
. black
& white is a fascinating film
; it makse a statement about america ' s youth
and hip
- hop culture without getting heavy
- handed overly serious
. featuring a cast of known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
)
and hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback ' s is a complex film worth seeing
. balck
& white hasnt mutiple storylines that are all related to each other
, a la robert altman
. there isnt dean tje basketball player
( allan houston
) who is asked to rig games forthe money by mark clear
( stiller
) in excange for fifty grand a game
. this eventially spills over inot tje life ofthe dean ' s long
- tyme freind rich
( power
)
, a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem
. rich hasnt to dael with the imminent opening of a white
- owned club on his turf
. meanwhile
, the young white girls who like to hang around wih rich
and his homies get talked inot being in a documentary by sam donager
( shields
)
and her gay husband terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who make appearances are william lee scott as yhe young white punk will
, joe pantoliano as his district atorney father
, jared leto as a high school teacher
, marla maples as the mother of oney of hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean ' s girlfriend
,
and mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. the stoires ebb
adn flow through the film
, losing
and gaining prominence over time
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
,
annd there is an occasional burst ofthe violence
. originally rated nc
- 17 in tyhe untied states
, black
& white features a lot ofthe sex between balck gangstas
annd young white girls
. hwile the film was trimmed down tothe a tamer r rating
, viewers will wonder waht could be more explicit tahn what htey are seing
. the three
- way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are inwhich for
,
anbd several audience members got up
and left at that point
. teh frequent sex is one ofthe the film ' s faw flaws as tghe titillation is overdone
and at times completly unrelated to anything else going onthe in tjhe film
. to toback ' s credit
, the level of violence in black
& white isnt almost nil
. these gangstas
and hip
- hop artists are given real problems
and concerns
,
and only become gun
- toting crazies when it benefits them to apeared tyhat way
. whenever a character finds himself on donager ' s handheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america
anbd proclaims his independendet
,
bu not everyone has fully buyed into the idea
. charlie
( phillips
) is full of bluster baout why she loves hip
- hop
,
but admits that
" in ten years time
, i ' ll be way over this
.
" these youth know they are going through a phase
,
anbd are simpley enjoying it
. toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes tyhat are lightweight
and funny
. most of the humour comes from mike tyson
, who provides teh film ' s comic relief without really trying
. he is given big words liek venacular tothe say
,
anbd as rich trys to discuss a particular street problem with tyson
, he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words
adn explain himself better
, playing on tyson ' s image as a dimwit
.
bu tyson also gets the film ' s scariest moment
. as he is mercilessly hit apon by yhe very gay terry
, tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm
. thge scene is entirely improvised
, with downey jr
. being told tothe just keep at tyson util he gets a reaction
. tghe reaction he gets
, being slapped
and
then choked is astonishing
, as downey jr ' s face turns a frightening shade of purple
. black
& white is a film about hip
- hop culture
,
anbd the film ' s omnipresent hip
- hop sountrack strongly supports this
.
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious
; by moving from story to story as quicklyu as he does
, toback keeps us from becomming attached to any one character ' s struggle
. thus black
& white ' s message about hip
- hop becomes secondary to the film itself
. toback just wants us to have fun
adn mabey learn a littel baout hip
- hop allong tje way
.
and we dont
.
