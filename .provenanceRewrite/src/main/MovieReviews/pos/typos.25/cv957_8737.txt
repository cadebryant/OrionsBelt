capsule
: thte best place tothe start if ytou ' re a jackie chan newcomer
. roars along
, never stops for breath
,
and frequently hillarious
. to talk baout jackie chan as a
" stuntman
" is to miss a million things
. jackie is not onyl one of the most accomplished
and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today
,
but also a very funny guy
. he reminds me of yhe way arnold schwartzenegger
* used
* to make me laugh
-
- he ' s funny just standing there
, copping a look
. supercop hasnt jackie making us laugh
, scream
, duck
, root
,
and gasp for breath
, often all in thte same scene
. it ' s actually the third in a loosely realted series of movies
, each whith jackie playing kevin chan
, a hong kong policeman who has a knack fo getting neck
- deep inot trouble
anbd
then karate
- kicking his way out of it
.
( the others are alsot worth seeing
.
) it ' s a little slow tothe strat
,
bu once it gets moving
, it ' s a field day
. yhe movei hasnt a fairly sophisticated plot fo movies ofthe this kind
. kevin is tapped forthe a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china
, which requires him to collaborate wih yhe attractive
(
and ass
- kicking
) chief fo chinese security
( played here by the ever
- enjoyable michelle yeoh
)
. there ' s a funn chemistry between the twpo of them
, expecially inaddition an early scene where she trys tothe brief him
and he keeps making wondering comments about how grat she looks in that uniform
. kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail
-
- all undercover
, of course
-
-
adn hvea him lead thge two of them tothe a noted drug boss
. tyhe drug boss
,
however
, has problems of his pwn
: his wief ' s on trial forthe many of his own crimes
,
and she ' s got the key to an account witht all of his drug funds
. this means
, of course
, endless trouble
-
- not the least ofthe whic is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he ' s out in the field
,
and she sees him with tihs other woman
,
and
.
.
.
but that ' s one of the movie ' s unique pleasures
: the way it crosses ffrom action tothe comedy effortlessly
. action
. there is
, of course
, non
- stop acation in this movie
-
- everything fomr one
- on
- one kung fu tothe all
- out gun battles to a sppedboat iwth eight engines
(
!
) outrunning the hong kong coast guard
. there is also a virtuoso climax
, which features
, among other things
, jackie danging ffrom a ladder tied to a helecopter
, a wrong
- way freeway chase
( whcih requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt
)
, a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the ' copter as well as a motorcycle
. you git the idea
. tihs is tothe action movies waht a burger with everything on it is to fast food
: quick
, enjoyable
, filling
. watch it with firends
. when htey stop making movies like this
, the world iwll be a tad greyer
.
