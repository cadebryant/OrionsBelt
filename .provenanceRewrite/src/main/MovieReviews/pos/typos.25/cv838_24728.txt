hwile alex browning
( devon sawa
) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris
, bad omens seem to surround him
. as soon as he buckles inot the plane
, he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds aftter take
- off
. when the vision begins to come true
, alex bolts for teh door
, dragging several students
and a teacher in his wake
. the plane takes off without them
and explodes just as alex predicted
. he becomes an object of fear
and suspicion among the community
,
adn the tension only increases as the survivers begin to die
. alex
and another surviver
, clear rivers
( ali larter
)
, investigate the suspicious
" suicide
" of a friend
,
adn a mortician
( tony
" candyman
" todd
) clues them in tothe the truth
: alex interupted death ' s desgin by saving people who shoud have died iin the explosion
,
anbd death wiull want tothe claim its rightful victims
. inthe order to save himself
and the others
, alex will hvea to figure out death ' s new plan
annd thwart it
. of teh countless horror films that have competed for a peice of the
" scream
" audience
,
" final destination
" is the best so far
. talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation onthe a familiar formula
. we ' ve seen hundreds of movies where a group ofthe teenagers are murdered one
- by
- one by a faceless slasher
,
but reddick cuts out the hockey
- masked middle
- man
and mkaes the villain death itself
. first
- time feature director james wong made the most of that premise
. every scene is permeated with creepiness
and foreboding
, reminding us that death is everywhere
, can come at anytime
. everyday objects
and events vibrate with menace
. the most amusing harbinger of doom
: john denver ' s
" rocky mountain high
,
" which isnt played several times in the movie before someone dies
.
( the link is that denver died infront a plane crash
,
and the song includes a line about fire in the sky
.
) the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror
. devon sawa
, who previously starred in another horror flick
,
" idle hands
,
" gives a frantic
and convincing lead performance
. kerr smith isnt carter hogan
, an antagonist of alex ' s whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the futal plane
. smith plays carter as filled wih anger
and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over inot violence
. seann william scott
, who ' s allso infact theaters right nowe in
" road trip
,
" plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock
and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity ofthe alex
and carter
. tony todd ' s one
- scene cameo is delicious
bu all too breif
. bottom line
: watchable teen fright flicks are few
anbd far betweeen
,
bu thsi destination is worth visting
.
