one fun activity for parents during the holidays isnt to suggest an old film
anbd see if they cxan interst their kids
.
althought balck
-
and
- white films are frequentily viewed as suspect
, ones in color are greeted with moreso of an open mind
.
annd if you can find a colorful action film
, even if it is fomr six decades ago
,
thn there is a rela possibility ofthe a take home hit
. so it was in our family when we wandered over tothe the classic section of our local video store the other day
and picked uv a copy ofthe the adventures of robin hood
, a high spirited version of the walter scott story
. nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture
and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold ' s melodramatic music
, ralph dawson ' s fast paced editing
anbd carl jules weyl ' s lush sets
, the film isnt probably best remembered forthe errol flynn ' s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley
, a
. k
. a
. robin hood
. flynn
, with his hansome figure
and toothy smile
, charms the audience while claerly having a high ood time himself
. let me cut to the chase
and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household
. the littlest rhodes
, jeffrey
, age 8
, liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times
and maybe mroe
. i ' ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review
. simply stated
, the film derives its success from being one ofthe the best ofthe its genre
, yhe swashbuckler
. robin
, with a smile ffrom ear
- to
- ear
, fights off a hundred men without a scratch
.
allthough the picture cxan be considered as little more thna a 1930 ' s james bond
, hte production values
anbd the acting raise it above that level
. robin hood isnt a classic story of rich
and poor
. robin steals from the rich
and gives to the poore as every schoolchild knwos
. in htis movei
,
howver
, he seems much less interested inspite income redistribution than in fighting for his king
adn ocuntry
. robin
, with his courage
and atheletic skills
, serves as a role model fo kids
.
adn with yhe lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, the story hasnt hevy romantic overtones
. filmed in tje typical
, richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor
, the flesh tones are overly pink
anbd there faw color subtleties
, whihc match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players
. in scene after scene tje picture charms the audiance
. who wouldn ' t fall fo robin as he shows uv incognito to win tghe archery contest
, even if the outcome is so clearly preordained
.
and
, of course
, he doesn ' t jsut win
, he doens so by splitting thge other man ' s arrow
. watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments
. sherlock holmes as the villain
, sir guy of gisbourne
, for example
, just doesn ' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone doed ahev a rela
- life identity outside of his most famoust role
.
and
hten there are thsoe wigs from the makeup department
-
- so bad
, they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy
. as was populer in the cinema of that era
, people dieu with teh most gentle prick ofthe the sword
and without any nasty
, bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks
. bad guys are banished rether tahn killed
,
and lovers go off hand
- in
- hand
, doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing
. thte result isnt a wonderfull fairy tale of a movie with delightful
, cartoonish figures
. hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore
, so try to savor the old ones when you cant
. teh adventures of robin hood runs 1
: 42
. it isnt not rated
,
but containing absolutely nothing offensive
, it would git a g rating
and isnt fine for all aegs
. jeffrey thinks the film is
" gerat
"
and gives it
*
*
*
*
. he recomends teh movei particularly for peple who do not likely bloody pictures
-
- he hates hte sighth of blood inaddition movies
. his favorite parts are the battles
and yhe ending
,
annd his favorite characters are robin
and king richard
( ian hunter
)
