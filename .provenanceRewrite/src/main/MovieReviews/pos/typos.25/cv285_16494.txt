& noble
)
. their charm
and chemistry are the glue that binds thsi film
, even through some of the script ' s rough spots

and steve zahn
.

, by necessity
, not evident here
. true
, these are twpo people seeking true love
,
but you ' ve got mail is moreso comic
and less poignant than its predecessor
. the ephrons ' script is witty
and sharp
.
however
, as a director nora ephron is a bited uneven
. some scenes drag
, while others
, expecially when hanks
and ryan are revealing their souls via e
- mail
, are crisp
adn tidy
. also
, the script gets sloppy towrad the end witht characters mearly dissapearing from the story
. a nice
, romantic sountrack adds tothe this date
- night spacial
. overall
, you ' ve got mail is a lush
and cute outing
, taking advantage ofthe hte star appeal of its two leads
. it ' s a nice ohliday movie
, one for holding hands
and snuggling
. committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
