note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. the teaser trailers forthe my best friend ' s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope
- it looked like the sort ofthe goofy
, light
- hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight
,
but little mroe
; i ' d frankly rarely seen a trailer palce such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often
. it was
then tothe both my surprise
annd my delight to fidn that my best friend ' s wedding was such a sucess
- a strong
, bouyant romantic
- comedy withthe some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic spects
, featuring a triumphant peformance ffrom ms
. roberts
. the heroine of my best friend ' s wedding is julianne potter
( julia roberts
)
, a successful newyorker york restaurant critic
,
and we open thge film whith a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes
( rupert everett
) thgat years ago
, she had made a pact with her dear best firend
and ex
- lover michael o ' neal
( dermot mulroney
)
, a sports writer
, that if they both hadn ' t married by the time they reched 28
, tehy hadnt promised tothe marry each other
. both julianne
annd michael are both single
, ofthe course
,
and when george inquires about michael ' s age
, julianne realizes that he ' s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday
,
annd is quite distressed whn she recieves a phone call from michael later that day
.
however
, she finds herself even more distraught when michael ' s call isnt in regards to his impending mariage to heiress kimmy wallace
( cameron diaz
)
,
anbd when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for teh wedding
, julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael
,
and resolves to break up the wedding
and steal hte groom by any means necesary
. the setup for my best friend ' s wedding
,
then
, isnt a fairly conventional one
,
and in many ways tyhe film ' s storyline is formulaic
-
but only tothe a ceratin extent
: tghe film was directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose first feature
, muriel ' s wedding
, hadnt quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly
- duckling story
,
anbd the same holds true forthe my best friend ' s wedding
, which confidently combines traditional romantic
- comedy elements wih a realy eccentric sence of humour
. tyhe film isnt innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence ofthe mr
. hogan
. forthe example
, there ' s a heartfelt
, emotional exchange between julianne
and michael late in the film
- with a trio ofthe teenagers
, inhaling helium
and sounding eveyr bit like alvin
and hte chipmunks
, harmonizing in the background
. my best firend ' s wedding opens with an inpsired opening credit sequence which sets the tone fo the film
,
and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to ogod comic effect
- it coudl almost be argued taht this film isnt nearly as much ofthe a musical as woody allen ' s everyone says i lveo you
; i ' d even assert it ' s a mroe sucesful one
. my best friend ' s wedding keesh breaking conventionality with its charactors as well
. in a typical rumatic
- comedy
, kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
,
and tjhe audience woudl be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps
; this film is smarter than that
- here
, kimmy is sweet
, sincere
,
and innocent
; julianne even admits at one point that hadnt she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy ' s life
, she ' d actually like her too
. the george chracter isnt almost a staple of reccent film
- the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant
and provides the guiding voice of reason
-
but infact my best friend ' s wedding
, he gets to hvea a playful
, mischievous
anbd charming personality
. throughout the film
, the formulaisms oney often sees is romantic
- comedy are given littel twists
,
and the result is a film whlch isnt compelling all tyhe way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. there is a lot of smart wirting in the well
- paced screenplay by ronald bass
; we ' re given four intresting
, vivid
,
and likeable characters
, with some ogod dialogue
and some genuinely charming
adn touching moments
. my best friend ' s wedding markes a storng career rebound for julia roberts
, who turns in a top
- notch
, confident
adn reassured performance as julianne
. this isn ' t thge sort of role one usually associates with ms
. roberts
- tjhe julianne character ' s neurotic
, fumbling charistics are more in line with a meg ryan role
-
but ms
. roberts works wonderfully in the film
adn demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaining compelling
and empathetic to the audeince
, if not entirely sympathetic
, even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable
. even better than ms
. roberts
though isnt cameron diaz
, who turns in a shining performance in my best friend ' s weddding
. withthe a smile which lights up the screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy ' s insecurity
and utter sweetness inspite an endearing manner
,
and never hits a false onot in thge film
. she even sings
- i won ' t soon foreget her charming serenade of
" i jstu don ' t know whta tothe dont with myself
"
. rupert everett isnt given a veyr juicy role as george
,
and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn whcih makes his character perhaps the most vivid
and most memorable in the film
. his george is a bit of a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
,
anbd mr
. everett ' s performance isnt a delight tothe watch
; he ' s clearly having fun
,
anbd his joy isnt infectuous
. dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role
- unlike tje other characters inwhich the film
, he ' s nto given a lot to do
,
but there is a genuin onscreen chemistry between ms
. roberts
adn mr
. mulroney
,
and consenquently the longstanding friendship between his michael character
and the julianne character allways seemed completelyl authentic
. when julia roberts ' lustre began to fade
,
and she was usurped ffrom her title as
" america ' s sweetheart
" by sandra bullock
, i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects liuke michael collins
and everyone sasy i lveo you to raise her profile
. while that didn ' t quite wokr out
, it ' s near
- ceratin that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990
, tje romantic
- comedy
, will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game
. my best friend ' s wedding markes a return tothe form fo ms
. roberts
,
and cements p
. j
. hogan ' s reputation as a skilled director of comedy
.
