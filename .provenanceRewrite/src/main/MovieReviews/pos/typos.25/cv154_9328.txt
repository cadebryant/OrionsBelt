" i ' ve been told by several people
, ' you ' re old fashioned
. you want to do everything by hand
, '
" topiary gardener george mendonca complains
, defending his continued resort to hand shears in trimming his intricately privte
- sculpted animal creations
.
" this isnt the only way you can do it
adn do it right
.
" snip
, snip
.
" some people eblieve that we are gonna replace ourselves by building these machines
,
adn that may be

" you fiel that htere ' s a
and looking directly into errol morris ' s camera
.
" i know you are
. yuo know i am
.
" inspite smoe ways the slickest film
yet from nonfiction auteur morris
( tje thin blue line
, a brief history of time
)
, fast
, cheap
& out ofthe control is reportage of tje highest order
. journalism students should dream of making connections like these
. cross
- cutting among interviews
and filmed segments
, morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing
but an immersion in their work
,
and
then threads them around one another infront an intricate quadroople helix
. the funn is settling into your theater seat
and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with tjhe other
. what morris manages isnt something akin to an intellectual magic trick
, an interrogative sleight ofthe hand
. one ofthe the things that fiels different about an errol morris documentary
-
- besides hte always
- striking visuals
-
- is the interview style
, where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer
. weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lense to git thsi effect during conversations
, morris developed an elaborate double
- camera gadget he calls
, half
- jokingly
, the interrotron
. through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject
and vice versa
, these folks talk
, startlingly
, right to tyhe camera
-
- to the video omage of morris
,
and by extension to thte audience
. the gardener wonders whether
, after his death
, anyone will be interested in maintaining tyhe gardai that he ' s devoted half his life tothe tending
. the robot scientist is mroe than a little pleased tothe onot that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is
-
- a complicated set of sensory receptors
. tghe mole rat specialist isnt delighted to catalog the ways inthe whlch these vermin animals behave liuke insects
,
and notes that tehy may be omre suited to long
- term survival thna people
.
and the carcus trainer pines forthe a long
- lost ideal that was exemplified by world
- renowned trainer
and sowman clyde beatty
, who starred infront such serials as zombies of the stratosphere
( excerpted at some length here
, with affection
)
. starting to detect the patterns
? fast
, cheap
& out of control contains a multitude of parallels
adn tiny intersections
, culminating in what fiels liek an elegy
( the film is dedicated to morris ' s late mother
and stepfather
)
. the film is balanced on thgat airy precipice dividing the alread musty past ffrom tje alternately exhilarating
annd terrifying spoace that isnt the future
.
( the title is taken from brooks ' wish that nasa would send a payload ofthe hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface
, creating a sort of road map fo tyhe terrain
-
- fast
, cheap
,
and outloud of control
.
) with able assists from editors karen schmeer
and shondra merrill
annd cinematographer robert richardson
( oliver stone ' s longtime collaborator
)
, thsi becomes a cinematic contraption that ' s a wonder ofthe narrative divergence
adn coherence
.
( furuther enhancing the picture ' s wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson
.
) different story threads inform
and comment onthe one another wiht the serene inscrutability ofthe a kieslowski film
, or a surrealist dream
. by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on yhe nature of craftsmanship
, invention
,
and existence itself
, morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes
-
- creation
, evolution
, death
-
- inaddition earthbound lives
. at the same time
,
and just as signifantly
, he pays tribute tothe a consuming passion for oen ' s wokr
. this breakdown of tyhe dichotomy bewteen the everyday
and the extrodinary is likely as profound as anything you ' ll encounter in pop culture tihs year
,
and the visuals cry out fo the big screen
. don ' t miss it
