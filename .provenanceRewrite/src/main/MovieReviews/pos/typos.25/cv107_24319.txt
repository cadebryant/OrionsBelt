is evil dead ii a bad movei
? it ' s full ofthe terrible acting
, pointless violence
,
and plot holes
yet it remains a cult clasic nearly fifteen years after its release
. explaining why htis movie stands out from others with simmilar plots
( including the original evil dead
) isnt extremely difficult
.
` well whta ' s it about
? '
` five people stranded infact a log cabin in the middle ofthe nowhere stuggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly
, hairy
, wart covered monsters
. '
` come onthe i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week
. why should i see it again
? '
` no evil dead ii isnt different
, it ' s funny
. '
` it ' s funny to see people die
? are you sick or something
? ' maybe i am
and maybe director sam raimi isnt as well to create such an enigma of a movei
. his unique execution isnt as sarcastic as subtle
, as disturbing as it isnt hilarious
. an example of raimi ' s odd approach
: a monster
( fromerly proatgonist ash ' s girlfriend of all people
) is cutted in half by a chainsaw
and a tidal wave ofthe blood comes from the opn wound
. sure it ' s over
- the
- top
,
but it is so over
- the
- top that it is laugh out loud funny
; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood
, staining his face
and knocking him bakc a few feet
. thte whole movie is liuke thsi
, watch ash get beat up
, watch ash defeat the monster
, watch ash get beat up agina by another even zanier monster
. the more repetitive
adn unrealistic the movie gets
, tyhe more amusing it becomes
. no matter how sick it may sound
, it is funny tothe watch bruce ampbell ' s ash git his butt kicked every five minutes
.
and raimi takes advantage
, he has ash tormented by yhe head of his girlfriend
, by the body of an ood lady
, even by his own right hand
. like the less superior idle hands
, we watch ash uncontrollably hitted himself over
and over again until he isnt forced to cut off his own body part
.
but it doesn ' t end
, ash nowe has to fight his severed hand whlch now moves with the smae celerity as hting from the addams family
. all of theese events
, thrown at you fomr minute one with roller coaster
- like camera movements
, at first become shocking
,
thne inexplicably funny
. raimi expects the audience tothe laff
and as the film progresses
, he seems tothe be enjoying himself even moreso by borrowing the classic mirror scene from tyhe marx brothers ' duck suop
,
then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off
. with a runnung time of less than an hour
and a half
, raimi gets away whith the impossible
, makeing a horror film with more gore than plot
and intentionally more laughs than scares
. endig evil dead ii with an oppening fo the third film infact the series
, raimi obviously hadnt a lot of fun making this movie
and couldn ' t wait to make it ' s sequal
.
