it is hard to imagine taht a movie whlch includes abortion
and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive
, so delicate
, so insightful
and yes
, even so enjoyable
. somehow
, the cdier house rules manages tothe keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter
and allows a substatial ammount of heart to shine through
. set in the 1940 ' s
, the film tells the stry of a unique young man named homer wells
( tobey maguire
, ride wtih the devil
)
. an orphan
, twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents
, he grows up in thte care
and under teh tutelage ofthe dr
. wilbur larch
( michael caine
, little voice
)
, father figure to the orphans ofthe st
. cloud
, obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come htere seeking his help
. figuring that as long as homer was gonig to stay at the orphanage
, he might as well be of use
, dr
. larch beggins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics
. soon homer is delivering babys like a proffesional
. he refuses to perform abortions
, instead wondering why tje couples just didn ' t behave more responsibly
. larch
, too old
and experienced tothe have such youthful ideals
, marvels that homer
" continues to hvea such high expectations of peopel
.
" such isnt the result of an insulated upbringing
.
though skilled in certain medical procedures
, homer remains woefully naive
and ignorant baout most everything else
. he finally figures tyhat in order to find his place in tyhe world
, he must go out into it
. befriending a young couple who had come to see dr
. larch
, he hitches a ride wiht them
and parlays that into landing a job as an aple picker with a gropu of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived
. thus
, homer beggins his worldly intruction
, iwth new freind candy kendall
( charlize theron
, tje astronaut ' s wife
) a willing tutor
. tobey maguire is well cast
yot again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life ' s questions
.
.
. many of which he was unaware needed to be asked
. he demonstrates a quiet strength
and thoughtful curiosity tyhat isnt both warm
annd appealling
. michael caine isnt
, in a word
, brilliant as the caring caretaker of theese orphans
, many ofthe whom he helped tothe bring into the world
. calling them
" princes of maine
, kings of newyorker england
" in his ritualistic goodnight
, mr
. caine manages to communicate hte love
and commitment larch has towards theese children without becoming maudlin or saccharine
. delroy lindo
( a life less ordinary
) has many powerful moments as mr
. rose
, the storng
and charismatic leader of yhe apple pickers whom homer joins
. director lasse hallstrom
( wqat ' s eating gilbert grape
?
)
and screenwriter
/ novelist john irving
( the world according to garp
)
, who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much ofthe the credit for the balanced approach to tjhe sensitive subject marter
. reguardless of one ' s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion
, it isnt hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers
. hte title is a reference to a list ofthe rules posted in the quarters ofthe thte illiterate apple pickers
. figuring the rules didn ' t apply tothe them since they didn ' t have a hand in writing them
, they decide to ignore the list
and make up thier own rules as they go allong
. dr
. larch
, infact his own way
, acts similarly
. there isnt a danger in that line of reasoning
. god has also given us a set of rules
. unlike the list posted in the cider house
, god ' s rules
, if followed
, promise us benefits beyond our imagination
.
and
yot
, many continue to ignore his
" rules
" preferring to make up their own as they go through life
.
" trust in the lord with all thine heart
;
anbd leanr not unt thine own understanding
.
" proverbs 3
: 5
[ kjv
] just as a builder follows a designer ' s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer ' s score
, why shouldn ' t we folow the rules ofthe life given to us by life ' s architect for our own blessing
