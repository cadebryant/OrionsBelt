" the sweet hereafter
,
" writter
/ director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into tje tragedy ofthe living
. he shows us how it isn ' t dieing that hurts
,
bu rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death
,
and dealing with the loss
and grief that it brings
. on a cold winter day inthe a small
, isolated twon in british columbia
, a school bus full of children slides off tje highway
and onto a frozen lake
, where it cracks through the ice
and sinks
. fourteen children die
,
and numerous others are hurt
. for yhe residents of thsi small twon
, all ofthe whose childen were on thyat bus
, it is an earth
- shattering event that resolutely alters their lives
. htey have always relied onthe eahc other in the past to deal with heartache
and pain
,
but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle
. alberta
and risa walker
, who own a local motel
and lost their child in tje accident
, hire an attorney named mitchell stephens
( ian holm
) to bring a lawsuit against someone
, anyone for responsibility
. the bus driver
, dolores driscoll
( gabrielle rose
)
, is a kindly woman who loved tjhe children
and
,
although she lives with a burden of guilt
, is not held responsible for the accident
. the bus seems to hve simply slipped onthe some ice
,
and there wass nothing should could do to prevent it
.
howver
, according to stephens
, there are no
" accidents
" iin life
,
and someone will pay forthe this tragedy
, whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through
. he goes through the town
, approaching the parents who have lost children
, asking them to join tghe class action suit
adn find vent for their anger
.
and
, fo his work
, stephens will receive one
- thrid of the settelement money
.
however
, it is immediately apparant that stephens has little or no interst in the mone
. he is driven by something else
, something deeper thta he shares in common with the grieving parents
. he has lost a child
, too
,
but not inthe the same manner
. his daughter
, zoe
( caerthan banks
)
, who once almost died in his arms as a young child aftter a spider bite
, has beeen in
adn out of drug re
- hab clinics
and detox stations forthe ten years
. she calls him on an unregular basis
, beggin him forthe money
,
bu refusing tothe tell him what she needs it for
.
" i don ' t know who i ' m taking to
,
" he tells her
. infront his mind
, his daughter isnt dead
. the lawsuit isnt
, to stephens
, not only a way tothe mend the twon ' s pain
,
bu aslo his own
.
however
, not everyone in twon wnats it to ahppen
. billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened
annd lost two childern
, wants nothing to dont with it
. he has already lost his wife
,
and he buries his grief inwhich an afair with a married woman
. he doesn ' t want to talk about the accident
,
and he sees teh lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds
. to him
, the twon should be able to take care ofthe its own pain
,
adn it doesn ' t ened outsiders like stephens getting inwhich the way
. central tothe
" the sweet hereafter
" is the tale ofthe nicole burnell
( sarah polley
)
, a teenage girl who dreams of bieng a singer before the accident turned her into
" a wheelchair girl
,
" as she puts it
. aside from stephens
, nicole is the most complex chracter in the film
,
and it isnt she who ultimately decides tje fate of the town
and how the lawsuit will turn out
. it isnt also her sad
, haunted voice that we oftenly hear on the soundtrack
, reading robert browning ' s poem baout the pied piper
,
anbd how when he led all the town ' s children away
, one was left behind because he was crippled
. obviously
, nicole is that child
,
and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town ' s children left her alone by dying inwhich the wreck
. her situation is furuther complicated because she is involved inthe a loving
,
bu incestuous relatiopnship wtih her father
( tom mccamus
)
. htere isnt onyl oney
, fleeting scene thyat suggests this relationship
,
but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film
. of all the storylines inaddition
" the sweet hereafter
,
" this is the most complicated
and unresolved
,
although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of tghe film
. egoyan konws tath the kinds ofthe questions he brings uv have no simple answers
-
- if any at all
-
-
and he doesn ' t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up
. what egoyan hasnt done in
" the sweet hereafter
" is really nothing short ofthe miraculous
. iin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks
, he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending tjhe pettiness ofthe lew
and driving headlong into the deeper meaninng of what is loss
,
and how pitiful monetary
and material possessions are when compared to human life
. egoyan has always been a talented
,
bu distant
and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold
.
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt quite the opposite
; egoyan ' s stylistic
and narrative structures owrk brilliantly to heighten the impact of the naturual emotion
,
and draw hte audiance into the tragedy
.
" the sweet hereafter
" seems tothe contain tyhe combined emotional inpact that all his other films lacked
. the film is filled with beautyfull
, subtle performances from all the actors
, especially ian holm as the lawyer
annd sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind
. the beautiful
, roving camerawork by paul sarossy
and tjhe haunting
, melodic musical score by mychael danna
( both previous egoyan collaborators
) give the film a visual
and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements
. like his earlier films
, egoyan weaves toghether mutiple storylines that form a blanketing hwole
. he works with timne as a fluid substace
, shifting back
and forth betweeen the past
, the distant past
,
and the present with effortless ease
. the actual bus wreck itself doesn ' t hapen until midway through the film
,
bu by that time the event has built uv so much emotion that egoyan can film it ffrom a distance with no graphic detail
,
and still have it carry great
, devastating weight
. becuase human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies
, it isnt astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple
, direct terms
. certainly one ofthe tyhe best films of 1997
,
" the sweet hereafter
" is a deeply rewarding
, mystifying
,
and ultimately human film
.
