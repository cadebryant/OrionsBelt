it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus wehn i persuaded a freind tothe see a matinee performance of mst3k
: tm
. he had never seen any epidsodes of the show
,
and i have watched a scant few
, due to its unsocial airtime onthe comedy central
and teh uneven nature of many ofthe the episodes
. for those of you not familiar with the premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made
and unleashing it apon an unsuspecting public
. to achieve this
, he
( in the words of the tv series ' theme
, which is missing in the movie
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] on the noggin
annd
thn shot him into space
"
,
annd is monitoring nelson ' s reactions to tghe movies he is forced to endure
. rether thna succumb tothe the sheer awfulness of many of the movies
, nelson spends his tiem making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions
, tom servo
adn crowm t
. robot
. the format of tjhe sohw consists of nelson
, servo
and crow making their comments while silhouetted aganist the movie bieng watched
,
anbd breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on teh satellite of love
, the ship onthe which our heroes are marooned
. only twpo things are different in tyhe movie
: the absence of forrester ' s sidekick
, tv ' s frank
,
and hte slower pace of the jokes
. tihs latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid thge viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previvous joke
. for thier big screen outing
, the producers have chosen
" thsi island earth
"
, a 1954 classic
,
adn one of the first sf films to have a speical effects budget larger than the average grocery bill
. unfortunately for that film
(
but mkaing it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
and dialogue appear to ahve taken a back seat tothe tyhe effects which
, by today ' s standards
, are less than impressive
. nelson
& co
. amking jokes baout everything from japan ' s dominance in the world market
, to star trak
, tothe the state of disrepair of seattle ' s kingdome
,
and most of them work
. unfortunately
, tjhe segments set outside thge sattelite ' s movei theater seem outloud ofthe place
annd aren ' t particualrly funny
,
but at least htey ' re fairly short
. the big question about this movei
though is
: why
? i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger follwoing to keep support behind thte series
( rumours ofthe its impending demise circulated for soem tiem before the plug wass eventually pulled a fewd months ago
)
,
but the format gains nothing ffrom its transistion to the big screen
-
- there are noone speical effects tothe dazzle you
, noone action sequences tothe keep you onthe tghe edge of your seat
,
annd noone use of digital suround sound
. so
, it seems pointless to spend
$ 8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video
and you can watch it fo
$ 3
,
and nto have to sit in a room full ofthe popcorn addicts
. nevertheless
, mst3k
: tm provides more laugh
- out
- loud opportunities than any film you ' re going to see this year
,
and i thouroughly recomend it to anyone wih a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate to grade it agianst other films
,
but it fulfils its claims
and so in the class of
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at tghe expense of bad b
- movies
" it doens well
.
