i ahve a soft spot infront my heart for pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liked showgirls
( there
, i said it
)
. i typically enjoy myself when sitting through tyhat eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild things is the best sleazy film i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s filled iwth great performances
, graphic sex
, threee
- way sex
, rape charges
, double
- crosses
, plot twists
, genialia ofthe all genders
, graphic violence
, death
, witty humor
,
and
, best of all
, denise richards
. criticizing this film for bieng disgusting
, raucous
,
and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for bieng disturbing
, or titanic for being lofty
and epic
. wild things is a film that succeeds inwhich its endevors
,
but i don ' t just admire it for this
-
- i admire it for being so entertaining
annd such a fun time at the movies
. i must admit uv
- front
,
howver
, that i am directly inspite the center of the age group tothe hwihc this film has beeen engineered to appeal
. i imagin that this shows
. it ' s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces taht shouldn ' t be known
. i thought i had teh whole thing worked out from yhe trailer
,
bu i was wrong
; there are a lot of turns here
. i ' ll jsut say that the film takes place in blue bay
, a rich little town in florida
. inaddition blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who isnt accused of rape by two ofthe his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
and suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly ' s mother
, sandra
( theresa russell
)
, immediately presses charges
. all of htis happens fairly easly in tyhe film
.
and right up until this point
, i had the hwole film predicted
. i was wrong
,
though
,
anbd every tiem i was proven wrong
, i was shocked
. wild thnigs isn ' t even remotely plausible
,
bu it isnt so fun to see where tyhe story takes us thast the implausibility of every scene is meaningless
,
and often invited
, just fo kicks
. i remember firt seeing the preview forthe wild thigns before the relpacement killers
. i ' d give the preview four stars
. it made me want to see tjhe movie so much thyat i ' ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since
. over the past few weeks
though
, i started to realize tht there was no way the film could live uv to the preview
( see independence day
)
; thankfully
, i was proven wrong
. thte preview for this film isnt one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution comany
: not only does it make us want to see tghe film
,
bu it doesn ' t give away any of the secrets
.
but i ' m not here tothe talk baout tjhe preview
. i ' m here to talk baout denise richards
. now
, i foudn her mildly intresting inaddition starship troopers
,
bu in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she ' s in demands attention infront a way that alomst noone other performer cant
. of course
, htis might have something to dont whith her oceanic eyes
.
.
.
and flawess body
.
.
.
but i thought she did a great job acting
, too
( stpo laughing
)
. no
, richards isnt truely a fidn
-
- she is talented
,
and always convincing in this film
. this mixed in whith her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future
. the other actors are good
, too
. dillon is as suave as ever
( it ' s nice tothe see him bouncing bcak from albino alligator
and in
& out
)
. bacon doens a ogod job acting all determined
and stuff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives the most layered performance ofthe all of them
,
though i won ' t pretend that any of these cahracters are deep
and complex
. for a plot like this to work
, all of these people hvae to be insane
and basically contrived
. that ' s okay
, because director john mcnaughton knwos taht he ' s making a self
- consciously wicked film
. each scene
-
- even the three
- way sex scene
-
- is observed withthe hilarity by mcnaughton
,
and the result is a sleaze
- fest that ' s too smart to resist
. there isn ' t an inconsistent moent in wild things
: every bit of it is alluring garbage
, so trashy it ' s funny
,
and so entertaining it ' s painful
. i loved it
.
