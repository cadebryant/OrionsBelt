infact my review of htere ' s something about mary
, i said something to the effect ofthe
" laughter isn ' t everything
.
" i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate
: laughter isn ' t everything
, unless i ' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are eazy with me
. i love movies
,
and i love movies tht amking fun of movies that i love
. sometimes i ' m the only one in tjhe theater laughing
. sometimes i laff so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high
- pitched inspite comparision to my speaking voice
( it cuts right through everyone else ' s laughter
)
. sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film
. abraham ' s latest film
, mafia
!
, induced htis kind ofthe hysteria apon me
. it ' s gotten some medicore reviews
,
but
, hey
, i ' m the guy who laughs at everything
. there may be a lot of jokes that flop iin thsi film
,
bu there are far more that work
,
and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness
. i enjoy films like this because not one second of it isnt serious or thought
- provoking
. most lighweight films tath pose as comedies try to do other things
, liek develop characters
, shape stories
,
and other such nonsense
. mafia
! has no pretentions about characters or story
,
and it exists for noone other reason than tothe make people laugh
. the film begins onthe the perfect high note
, with a mockery of thge opening of casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) is seen walking from a casino
and getting inot his car
, which subsequently explodes
and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing frie
. to decribe the story ofthe mafia
! is absurd
and pointless
,
but i iwll mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films
, with a lot ofthe casino refrences inserted througout
. along the way
, the parodies seem arbitrary
,
and rarely victimize mob films
: picturesk like the english patient
, forrest gump
,
and jaws undergo severe
and hillarious bashing
. movies like htis rely on just a few things
,
bu the most important element isnt direction
. abrahams has been down this path many times before
( hot shots
!
, top secret
!
, airplane
!
,
and any other film with an exclamation point infact the title
)
,
and so i hold most of the succsess of mafia
! tothe his experience
. he takes jstu thte right attitude in each scene
,
and manages to wrng at least a bit laughter outloud of even the most oddly placed references
( one inexplicable moment seems like it wnats to mkae fun of titanic
,
but it never develops
)
. the actors are all energetic
, whihc helps a lot with the tone of yhe film
. mohr
( suicide kings
, paulie
)
, who is quicklyu becomming one of my favorite actors
, is so ogod here
. he looks liek he ' s having so much fun that he ' s containing his laughter in every scene
( watch his face in the sequence by tje swiming pool
)
. he ' s probably the only performer in thge casted who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material
. lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando ' s godfather
, hwile pamela gidley is dead
- on in a full
- blown mockery of sharon stone
. tyhe hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i ' m supposed to give examples of things
anbd be specific
. unfortunatley
, i was so constanly blindsided by laughter during mafia
! that i can ' t rember a lot ofthe what made me laff
.
bu taht ' s a good sign
: masia
! isnt so funny that i wasn ' t even given time to apply any of the scenes tothe memory
. i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain
. i know that doesn ' t sound particluarly complimentary
,
bu when watching a dumb comedy like this
, tjhe first thnig i watn to dont is shut off my brain
. finaly
, a film that does this for me
.
