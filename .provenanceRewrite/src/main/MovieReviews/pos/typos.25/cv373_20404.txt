taking a faw tips fomr the pulp fiction skool of filmmaking
, go isnt the new feature fomr tje director of the cult hit swingers
. the story centres around a group ofthe people
, who include brit simon
( askew
)
,
and checkout girls claire
( holmes
)
and ronna
( polley
)
and tyhe misadventures that htey get into
, split into three chapters
. everthing fomr sex to drugs tothe voilence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers
.
although qt ' s touch is evident in nearly every frame
, go is entertaining enough to foreget about the similarities
anbd just enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. liman
, who also photographed the film
, has a deft touch with the camera
,
and the film looks good
. tyhe film also seems to hvae benefited ffrom a budget
, with the night
- club scenes in particular looking pretty ogod
. there ' s a twisted sense of humour runing throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk
. the young cast are talented
and help bring tjhe story tothe life
. holmes
, one of the dawson ' s creek cast
( a sohw i ' m not particularly fond of
) displays much talent here
,
and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character
and never becomes a caricature
. askew isnt slightly succesful
, being rather obnoxious
. no doubt tyhe filmmakers intended this to make thte audience cheer wehn what happens to him
,
but instead ofthe ' funny annoying ' he ' s just annoying
. he drags down slightly oney ofthe the funniest chapters
,
but the talent aroud him in that particular tale more than makes uv for it
. the real standout is sarah polley as tghe drug dealing checkout girl
: her refreshing
and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stoires she is involved in much more intertaining
. also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer
, who gives an nice evil performance
. the scirpt
, written john agust
, is sharp
adn witty
, with ogod dialogue
and smoe funny jokes
. it starts off rather slow
however
,
bu in about twenty minutes yhe script has found it ' s footing
and just keeps getting better
. the stories are largely satisfying
,
althought occasionally htere ' s too much attention onthe one detail
but nto onthe another
. also
, some ofthe hte endings seem a littel forced
adn lucky
. still
, the cast ahve a meaty script to get into
annd obviously enjoy it
. it could of tried a little harder inspite some parts
howver
,
and these parts lag
. becuase this is a gen
- xer movie
, the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany
,
and go ' s one is pretty decent
. unlike other gen
- xers movies
, go never allows yhe music to subsitute for plot or dialogue
, which is a plus
. go is a vrey easy movei tothe absorb into
,
and the audience realy starts feeling for these cahracters
. thankfully
, they never become two dimensional characters who are bent
annd twisted throughout the movei to fit inot the stoires mechanics
( like thge heroine in 10 things i hate about you
.
) they are who tehy are
and they stay that way
. go is great fun
,
and a worthy folow uv from thge directer of swingers
. ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction
annd very bad things
,
anbd jsut sit bakc
and enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. erm
, go to go
, i guess
.
