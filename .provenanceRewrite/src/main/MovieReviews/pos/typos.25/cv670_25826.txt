whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films
, yhe end result is always a mess of a script
, acting
, directing
,
and generally a waste of time for any audience iwth an average iq above 40
. tjhe latest movie morass from hollywood
, the crew
, appeared equally destined to fail
, a strange combination of grumpy old men
and goodfellas tossed toghether with the likes of richard dreyfuss
and burt reynolds helming the ship
. the scary thing is tath it ' s actually intertaining
and a breath of fresh air in thsi otherwise stale month
. the crew works for several reasons
. the clever scirpt isnt reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie
, folowing four
" past their prime
" wiseguys from jersey who nowe live in hte raj mahal apartment house in miami beach
. the wiseguys find themselves being evicted ffrom their
" golden paradise
" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies
and boys looking for beachfront property
. the four mobsters
, bobby bartellemeo
( richard dreyfuss
)
, joey
" bats
" pistella
( burt reynolds
)
, mike
" tyhe brick
" donatelli
( dan hedaya
)
,
and tony
" mouth
" donato
( seymour cassel
) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from thte morgue in order to drive out the new tenants
adn keep their home
. this
" simple plan
" suddenly goes screwy
, of course
,
annd yhe boys become involved with a stripper named ferris
( jennifer tilly
) who wants her stepmother killed
, a paranoid latin drug lord who ' s convinced a mysterious rival isnt out tothe get him
,
and a rat with its tail on fire
. thte crew works as a strong comedic vehichle driven by a grat ansamble cast ofthe talented character actors
anbd subtle leading men
. instead ofthe concentrating on bobby ' s searc for his daughter
, the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys
, balancing tyhe production
. the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya
, seymour cassel
,
and the great
, gerat burt reynolds are brought outloud by eahc character ' s uniqueness
and synergy withing the wiseguy circle
. a strong supporting casted inlcuding jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend
/ cop
/ partner
and miguel sandoval as yhe paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs
. the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld
and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner
, emmy award
- winning director of the wonder years
. tjhe quick script written by barry fanaro
, screenwriter of kingpin
, is carried by plenty of subtley dry humor
and wit
. yhe crew is a prime example ofthe how simple
and dry
- witted a comedy can git these days
. the great thing is that thsi comedy doens not need tothe be punctuated by bodily fluids
, phallus symbols in the head
, or grandmothers giving head iin a spa
. in the steady flow of
" extreme
" comedy theese days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main
, it ' s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss
, reynolds
,
and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with onyl a few weapons of choice
- a decent scirpt
and good acting
.
