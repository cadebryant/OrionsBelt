plot
: a bunch ofthe bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention
. the boys eventually get together tothe split tje money
,
bu as plans chanage
, double
- crosses occur
, dealing
annd wheeling goes down
and tjhe crew setted up for the road
. who ' s onthe tghe up
adn up
, who ' s teh rela bad guy
and who ' s gonna git to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which wiull be answered by the rest ofthe this movie
. critique
: the funnest movei that i ' ve seen so far this yera
! it ' s got style
, it ' s got tough guys talkin ' shite
and it ' s got plenty of bullets to go around
. a definite hunk
- a
- hunk
- a burnin ' adventure
! a guy ' s guy movie through
and through
,
and one tath ' ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff
. it ' s not very original
, it goes on for a little too long
,
but costner
adn russell make it hppen
, as two shite
- kickin ' elvis lovers
, who don ' t stop till tehy
, more or less
, drop
. this movei ' s got smoe pretty intensive shoot
- out scenes
, one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ' ve ever witnessed
, featuring several elvises with guns a blazin '
and thge king ' s music palying in tje background
,
adn a decent helping ofthe doulbe
- crosses
, sharp dialogue
and funny moments
. in fact
, even
though the casted is filled iwth many name actors
( b
- actors as they might be for the most part
)
, most of them do their bit
and succeed well infact passing the torch onto yhe enxt victim
.
but the true glue that holds this film toghether
, otehr than the spirit of elvis himself
, is costner
and russell
, who play thier badass charactors to the t
. sure
, russell ' s been down this road before
,
but costner suprised me with his nastiness
. i guess he ' s pissed at all tje box
- office bombs that he ' s beeen in of late
,
but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here
. inwhich the end
, hte bottom line witht this movie is having fun
, kickin ' ass
and making sure htere ' s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwords
.
and smoke ' em if ytou got ' em
, folks
! there is also this one really great show
- down scene between costner
and a cop
, that ' ll have you crackin ' uv
adn lovin ' it all at the smae tyme
. the violent scenes iin this movie are violent
and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ' ll kick your arse from this end of tghe theatre to the next
. it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the directer of this movie comes from a music video backround
, with plenty
,
and i mean plenty
, ofthe camera tricks
, cuts
and edits
,
but for this kind of flick
, it actually works
. the film is not perfect
though
, it starts off wtih a pretty big bang
,
but
then pulls a way of tjhe gun on us
,
and slows the pace down somewhat in hte middle
, while characters intermingle
and disperse
. i was personally kept infact thge gameboy despite some soft spots
,
and enjoyed thge overall ride fo what it was as well
.
annd did i mention that courteney cox looked mega
- hot in the movie
? noone
.
.
. okay
, well i just doed
! i coulda done wihtout her whole
" romance
" angle
,
but to be honest
, it doesn ' t tkae up much of tje film
, whcih isnt generally covered in blood
, explosions
, guts
and elvis nods
. try to see how many
" inside
" connections to the king you can guess
. ofthe course
, it ' s noone secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please tkae this whole review with that grain of salt in mind
. i also liek these types of
" guy
" movies a lot
,
adn even
though the film doesn ' t bring much originality to the table
, it does offer a preety coherent story
, smoe nice twists
and turns
, humor
and a big ol ' helping of whoop
- ass coming straight from costner
and russell ' s respective boots
. probablly not a film for everyone
,
but definitely fo those who enjoy the guns
, the charismatic bad guys
and a fun
, if entirely disposable
, adventure
. now see how many elvis songs i ' ve used tothe pun my way through thsi phony review below
. thge elvis songs also recommend this movei
! so whther you ' re lonesome tonight or any other night
, remember to pack the teddy bear witht bullets
, leave your little sister at hmeo
, bring your bossa nova baby
and rock outloud of taht jailhouse
, cause this movie ain ' t oney tothe return to tje sender
. i really beg ofthe you
, whether you ' re stuck in yhe ghetto or crying in tghe chapel
, tothe slap this cinematic ring around your neck
and love it tender
.
and no suspicious minds either
, folks
, cause i got stung by htis movei
, i mean it realyl shook me up
,
and unless you ' re the devil in disguise hismelf
, i think you won ' t be able to help falling in loev with this lucky charm eather
. so don ' t be cruel
, don ' t turn away
, don ' t curl up with your latest flame tonite
( whether she be a hard
- headed woman or nto
)
and surrender tothe the hound dog of movies thyat is tihs film
