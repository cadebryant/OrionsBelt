.
. critique
:
" i fiel like shooting myself in the head
" are thte first words that came outloud of my mouth aftter seeing this movie
, a good indication as to waht kind of film to expect here
. this ain ' t your average
" happy go lucky
" kind ofthe picture
. this is a deliberatly slow
- pased mistery
- horror film drenched in atmosphere
, with a veyr creepy insane asylum
( in whcih most of the film takes place
)
, very few clues up
- front
and lots to talk about afterwards
. will it bore some peple to sleep
? you bet it wiull
! isnt it made forthe the scream audiences of the day
? absolutly not
! i guess you cin describe tihs film as a horror movei forthe thte
" cerebral crowd
"
. a film taht patiently unwraps itself frame after frome
, giving away very little witht each step
and eahc soudn
, unwinding itself util its final scenes offer up a world of revelations
and plenty more tothe dicuss later
. i ' ve alwyas loved movies that have me talking about them afterwords like the shineing
and lost highway
and tihs film fits right into that gropu
. in fact
, i guess i can pussyfoot aroud the actual word all i want
but the best way to describe this kind of movei is a
" mindfuck
"
. if you feel liek watching a movie that moves very slowy
, gives you a handfull of characters with divergent backgrounds
, tosses a few very ambiguous
and supernatural cookies your way
and isnt extremely disturbing once you put it all together
, well
,
thne htis movie is definitly for ytou
! it ' s the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate
( damn
, i missed thast hwole
" peanut buter
" thing
!
)
adn noe that will likely creep the shit out ofthe you if watched alone in the dark
.
" brrrrrrrrr
.
.
. now what was thast sound in the basement
? honey
, can ytou go check
?
"
and one thing this film doesn ' t have
, unlike its hollywood
- ian counterparts like the haunting
, is speshal effects
. in fact
, that ' s oney of yhe greater things about this movie
: it fiels rela because it looks like it ' s actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances
( i did some research
annd it wass
, in fatc
, shot on digital video
.
.
. ah
- ha
!
)
. another great thing baout it is taht it ' s actually vyre gory
anbd somewhat voilent in theme
,
and
yet we rarely see anything of hte sort onthe the big screen
( it ' s mostly implied
, kids
!
)
.
adn as clich
? d as it might be to say
.
.
. it ' s usually much scarier wehn tsuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such
. other films that this oney reminded me ofthe include henry
: portrait of a serial killer
and the blair witch project
, with that same real sense ofthe dread
, brooding
anbd terror
. tje film doesnt
however move awfully slow
annd if ytou really don ' t get
" into
" it completely
( you really ened to concentrate here
)
, you will lose yhe motion of the story
and yhe pent
- up tension might be released
.
but overall
, this film is
yet another great example of the horror genre making a veyr cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sighth
.
and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot liuke only he can
, how cant you go wrong
? definitely not a film fo everyone
but a must
- see fo anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of teh disturbed
( count me in
!
)
. stanley kubrick would be proud
! oh yeah
.
.
. so where ' s that gun again
.
.
.
? where ' s joblo coming from
? the blair witch project
