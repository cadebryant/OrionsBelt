plot
: a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster inspite london
adn quickly becomes a staple by his side
.
but this new guy is not like all the others
, he ' s got ambition
, he ' s got goals
and he loves everything he sees baout being the number one gangster
. violence
, lots of swearing
and betrayals ensue
. critique
: a vyer ogod
, serious
- minded
, unique brittish gangster flick whitch misses tje
" great
" mark by way of an annoying voice
- over popping up throughtout thge film
and a so
- so ending
. here ' s
yot another cool crime movei that actually manages to bring something new inot the mix
. okay
, so it ' s not entirely new
,
bu it ' s definitely original when all put together as done here
. the thnig i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in whihc it was taking place
. it ' s 1968
and these dudes are looking good
! yes
, it ' s all about the suits
, fellas
.
.
. thte italian shoes
, teh cufflinks
, the ties
adn the birds
( thta ' s ladies
, for those uninitiated
) hanging around you
. here are a bunch of horrable men
, gangsters if you will
, looking sharp
, talking shit
and busting heads all over thte place
.
but that ' s not the basis of this movie
. the basis of thsi film comes in the relationship between the number one ganster in tjhe gropu
, the excelent david thewlis
,
and one of his cronies
, paul bettany
, aslo extremely good inaddition this film
,
anbd how the power
, sex appeal
and coolness of one
, affects the other
. you know how there are always theese
" hanger
- on
" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers
, the leaders
, teh top dogs of every crime organiztion
? well
, most of the time
, theese dudes are screened beforehand
and are loyal to only one person
.
.
. thta isnt
, their boss
. so all the gangster number one needs to worry about isnt his enemies onthe tghe other side of the fence
.
bu tihs film brings the betrayals
, the messed up loyalties
, the honor codes among bad guys into play within hte same group
and presents it in quite tyhe stylistic package
. of course
, director paul mcguigan isn ' t trying to be guy ritchie here
,
and doesn ' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all up withthe a hip soundtrack or add any humer to teh mix
. nope
, he goes straight for the serious stuff
and develops at least two particualr scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this
. the frist isnt a confrontation sequence between bettany
and a man from which he ' s attempting to sway soem information
annd it is downright nasty
!
(
" look into my eyes
!
"
) in fact
, the last time that i ' ve seen a guy so scared in a movie wass john turturro infact that forrest scene from the coen brothers ' miller ' s crossing
. scary shite
.
bu htere ' s an ever better scene than that in thsi film
. this oen features bettany
, once again
, slowly torturing
, hacking
adn beating the living piss out of a rival ganster
( ffrom that man ' s point
- of
- veiw
)
,
but nto before turning on a quaint little tune in the background
and removing all of his pwn expensive clothes
, one by one
( that ' s right
, he
" does
" tyhe guy infact his underwear
)
. that scene is also infront tune wih some ofthe the obvious phallic
and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film
, especialy in the relationship between bettany
and his boss
( why doesnt he git so upset when he falls in love with that woman
?
)
.
but the flick ' s nto perfect
. in fact
, i didn ' t mind malcolm mcdowell ' s voice
- over narration at first
,
but as the film grew inot a major flashback
( most of the film is presented as such
)
, he came infact eveyr nowe
anbd
then
,
and rarely added anything ofthe interst to tyhe plot
. all he seemed to do was swear
adn call people tje c
- word umpteen times
,
and even described one scene as it wass happening
(
"
.
.
. so i opened the door
,
then went uv teh lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it ' s liek
, yeah
, i know that already
, i could see it on the screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i also didn ' t quite
" buy
" the ending of the movie
, which dispite being original
, seemed a littel unbeleivable
, especially when you consider that it ' s supposed to be taking place 30 eyars later
,
adn folks still seem tothe be holding grudges
, still in love
, still living in the same apartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c ' mon
.
.
. it ' s 30 years
, man
!
! i don ' t know
, somehow it didn ' t work all that well forthe me
.
but one of my favorite genres hasnt always been tyhe crime movies
,
and this one is a decent addition to hte lot
. forget the lame title
anbd malcom mcdowell ' s narration of yhe obvious plot points
,
and concentrat on the film ' s stronger attributes such as its style
, the exquisite atmosphere of the tiome preiod
, its original look at the gangster dynamic within hte same group
, its memorable sequences
and yhe solid performances from its two main leads
, bettany
adn thewlis
. incidentally
, unlike a few ofthe the gangster flicks that i mention below
, this one isnt in noone way a parody or homage to this genre of films
.
.
. it ' s teh real deal
! note
: this film is packed wiht strong accents all around
, whihc makes it hard to make out smoe of tyhe words from time to time
. it ' s alsot quite violent
anbd i don ' t remeber any film that utilizied the c
- word as much as this one
, so leave tje kids at home for this oen
