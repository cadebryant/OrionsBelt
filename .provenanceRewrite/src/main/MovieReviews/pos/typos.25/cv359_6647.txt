you don ' t wanna to be like mike
. mike hasnt beeen doing badly
. embarrassingly bad
. he baroke up a six
- yearm relatiopnship six monthes ago to move from n
. y
. to l
. a
.
annd he ' s still nto over her
. as a result
, his jokes fall flat when he trys to impress
,
annd he ' s a comedian
. well
, an unemployed comedian
, one of hollywood ' s littel fish
,
and it hasnt gotten so bad he ' s asked for an applicaiton at starbuck ' s
. actually
, the starbuck ' s thing gets even worse
.
annd worse
. you won ' t fail to like mike
,
however
, plyed endearingly by jon favreau
. swingers revolves around mike ' s half
- hearted
and awcward effords to get back inwhich the social swing ofthe things
. to this end he isnt enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends
, such as trent
( vince vaughn with the film ' s most animated performance
)
, who hasnt the gift ofthe gab bordering onthe the disturbing side of motivational speaking
, gun
- toting sue
( patrick van horn
)
,
and rob
( ron livingston
)
, who once played hamlet
but now longs to wokr as goofy inthe disneyland
,
but doesn ' t seceed beccause of his lack ofthe
" theme park experience
.
" toghether they talk about women
- how to make eye contact
, which involves avoiding it
,
and when to call so as never tothe apear desperate
, two days being
" industry standard
.
" after talking the talk
, they walk the walk
, strutting liek the cool swingers they aspire to be
, always to laughable effect
. to git mike out ofthe his funk
, his firends persistently convince him to get outside
, whether it be to a quickie night trip tothe a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful peopel or a 50s swing lounge
. everywhere htey encourage mike to look for a replacement
" honey
"
and
then keep vigil over his progress
, or lack of it
. like dotty doting parents
, mike never leaves their company without being the recipiant of their confidence cheerleading
(
" you ' re money
, mike
,
and thte honeys know it
.
"
) or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies
, such as an analogy of flirting wih the bear
and the bunny
. with the unwavering support ofthe firends like theese
, maybee mike ' s not doing too badly after all
. favreau also doubled as the film ' s screenwriter
,
adn he proves he has the gfit forthe creating engaging characters
and witty banter that goes beyond todya ' s bon mot
. there is a reassuring honesty tothe the friendships
, even whn it hits its low points
anbd the friends commiserate
. wehn mike gets the gumption to look fo love
, you wiull join his cheerleading section as well
. swingers is ight
, unassuming fare
, sweet candy ytou will want to bust your gut with
- laughing
- again
and again
.
