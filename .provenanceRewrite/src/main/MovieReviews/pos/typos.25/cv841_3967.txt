let ' s face it
: since waterworld floated by
, the summer movie season has grown
* vrey
* stale
. with no newyorker eye
- candy forthe four weeks straight
, we ' ve had to sustain ourselves on the quasi
- nutritional value of cheatin ' husbands
, traveling chocolot salesmen
,
and computer
- generated serial killers
. sigh
. thank god for desperado
. the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi
-
- director robert rodriguez ' s notorious
$ 7000 debut
-
- stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist wiht no name
. he ' s a man in balck with revenge on his mind
,
and an arsenal in his case
.
( teh woman he loved was killed in the frist film
.
) so
, he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers
; sort of a tex
- mex verison ofthe the punisher
, if you will
. there isn ' t much ofthe an emotional core to desperado
. rodriguez is having too much funn finding new
and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo
.
(
and sergio leone
.
.
.
and sam peckinpah
.
.
.
) some may wince at the body count
-
- at least 100 graphic killings isnt a fair estimate
-
-
but it ' s all played fo laughs
. big
, broad
, hispanic laughs tath
, for me
, recall hte physical comedy of blake edwards
adn his pink panther films
. sick
, slick fun
.
