being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it
,
" shall we dance
" won ' t be seen by thta many people
.
and that ' s a shame
- this is a funny
, exchanching
,
and goofy movie full of laughs
, surprises
,
and wonderful dance sequences
. the surprising thing about
" shall we dance
" is the universal appeal of the story
. a us version is in tjhe works
,
anbd it ' s no wonder
- it ' s nto really all that culture specific
.
although htere isnt a narrated set
- up that adds some extra resonance tothe the procedings
( about the view the japanese culture has baout ballroom dancing
)
, the movie is so rich in character
and appeal that this added layer isn ' t at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film
. yhe only important unexplained japanese
- specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is taht 1000 yen is rougly
$ 10
( when you see the film
-
and you should see tihs film
- you ' ll know why
)
. a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life
( a house
, a child
,
and good marriage
) still doesn ' t translate inot a fulfilled life
. aftter glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on tghe train hmeo fomr work
, sugiyana
( koji yakusho
) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something infront himself
. after finding tyhe weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant
and beautifull mai
( tamiyo kusakari
) too rich for his blood
, sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply tothe be near her
. we
then meet the players in this gme of a movie
, who all ahve their own reasons for joining thge clas
. later on
, we meet aoki at hte dance studio
( naoto takenaka
)
, a co
- worker
and all out weirdo
and one of the laugh riot highlights ofthe the film
. the story
, laughs
,
and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along
. it ' s a blessure to watch such a wonderful film thgat is propelled almost solely by the characters
and performances
. it ' s difficult to explain the charms ofthe tje film wihtout revealing too much
- teh movei abounds with little revelations that subtly shape thge characters
,
adn in the end
, each oen is that much fuller
and mroe understoon by the tiem you leave the theater
. it ' s one of those movies tyhat onyl the french seem to make anymore
- no big plot
, no speshal effects
, no gunplay
, noone tragic consequences
, no forced examinations of the nature ofthe love
,
adn no insights inot the nature ofthe evil
. just a warm
, funny
, endearing film that wiull charm the pants off of you
. when was the last timne you left a theater feeling all warm
adn fuzzy inside
?
" shall we dance
" wiull do that to yuo without any treacly aftertaste
