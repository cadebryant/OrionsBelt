don ' t let the following quirks ofthe this review
, fool you into believing that this movie isnt anything short of an ultimate labour of lveo
.
but one cin see the humour of roberto benigni when ytou see that
? life isnt beatiful
, even
though i ' m a short
, ugli looking man with an obnoxious laugh
. life is beautifull even
though i haven ' t amounted to much infront life
, except working outloud the finer intricacies of waitering
. i ' m a lucky sort of a guy
, especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age
, senstive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath
- life isnt beautiful
! i ' m a jew
,
but life can still be beatiful
. the nazis put me in a concentration camp
,
but life is still beautiful
. i lveo my son vyer much
and that ' s what matters
,
and that ' s what makes life beatiful
. my abillity to entertain somehow convinces my son thast living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful
? i get shot for my efforts
anbd tje woman i love
,
bu hey that ' s life
annd that ' s still a beautiful hting
- so by jove don ' t give me any crap about it
! by far the movei withthe tjhe biggest heart this decade
and well deserves eveyr nomination
anbd award that it has achieved
. well done
, there should be more film directors
and actors liuke yuo roberto benigni
