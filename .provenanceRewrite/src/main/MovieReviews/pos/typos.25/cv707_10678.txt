the reunion film is not an orginal idea inspite any way
, shape
, or form
. it ' s beeen done throughout film history over
and over agian
,
annd has become one of the many sub
- genres
, like the prep school sub
- genre
, the angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
,
and the slasher sub
- genre
. what makes
" peter ' s friends
" so remarkable is not how it doesn ' t follow tyhe rules of this sub
- genre
,
but how it follows it so well
,
and creates characters thyat i wouldn ' t mind hanging with
. what are the rules of tje reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. ytou need a gropu of friends
, most of them married or at least dating
,
annd sometimes even married or dating eachother
. 2
. you need to have them brought back toghether over soem sort of a crisis
. 3
. they are not to have spoken toghether much since htey split apart
. 4
. the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. they all have to be slightly tothe highly neurotic
. 6
. the reunion has to bring them together
, seperate them wiht little crises
,
thn bring them back together because
, after all
, they ' re friends
. 7
. there has to be some sex or at least some making outloud either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited
. 8
. eightly
, they ' re all unhappy or marginally so
. 9
. there ' s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them tht ' s built up over the years
. 10
. the friends are all wildly successful inspite the world of entertainment
and the arts
, sometimes internationally so
. 11
. the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the tiem when they were friends
, sometimes causing them to get together infront dance
/ song
. since it follows these rules so closely
, it will probablly be
(
and has been
) coined off as just a
" british ' big chill
. '
"
and iin some ways it is
. both folow tjhe rules
, as i said
,
and both feature lots of bitching
, big confessionals
,
and broken relationships
.
but while
" the big chill
" was
, at least to me
, a tad too whiny
anbd unsatisfying
,
" peter ' s friends
" hits its mark
, makeing this film funny
, dramtic
,
and poignant
. the friends ofthe peter ' s were all infront the same theatre gropu back in ' 82
, performig wildly outrageous british acts for peple far too stuck up to enjoy them
( tje opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops
and tutus
)
. after peter ' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly on screen enough to register
,
but oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mension tothe him
, he has to decide whther or not to keep it
. not sure what to dont with it immeadiately
, he decides tothe throw a giant reunion party
, inviting back all his old chums
. ofthe course
, all or most of his chums follow the tenth ruel
. andrew
( kenneth branagh
, also directing here
) is an actor who ' s unhappily married to a tv star
, carol
( co
- writter rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) is a successfuly publisher ofthe self
- help books
,
bu looks liuke she needs them more thna her customers
, as she is lonely
and unhappy
. roger
and mary
( hugh laurie
and imelda staunton
, who were also married in
" sense
and sensibility
"
) are married
,
and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk
,
but have suffered a tradgedy as one of their newely born twins has recently died
.
and sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) isnt as promiscous as ever
, having a newyorker boyfriend as of two weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who ' s married
and whants a divorce because of her
, giving her doubts
. as for peter
, things seem okay
.
.
. the film features lots ofthe intertube
- friend jokes
,
and even some old theatre anecdotes
( which i at least find a lot of fun in
, as i ' ve done lots of theatre myself
)
.
annd htere are big confessions
, brawls between the friends
,
and by the end
, almost everyone is unhappy
, even
though some hvea resolved their problems long before yhe end
( which i kinda digged
)
. thge fianl twist would seem forced an anti
- climactic
,
but for some reason
, i felt the same way tghe rest ofthe thte friends did
. maybe it ' s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wnated to join their clique
. that ' s really waht makes
" peter ' s friends
" so lovable
: hte way you just watn to hang with a group of firends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes
,
but when someone ' s in crisis
, cant cmo together wonderfully for noe anyother
. it ' s wehn you have a giant crisis like htis
annd people want to selflessly help yuo out instead of subtely pushing ytou away tath makes yuo realize you have true friends
,
adn these peopel are true friends
. not to mention kenneth branagh is able tothe make teh film seem nostalgic for the 80s
( a decade i grew uv in
, unfortunatly
) wihtout tkaing us outside of thge 90s
. there are some 80s classics
and anti
- classics liuke tears for fears
" everybody wants to rule the world
,
"
but unfortunately no stupid
/ fun 80s songs
( i htikn if i ever did an 80s reunion film
, i ' d put some crap go gos song on
, or at least soem ogod ood
" come on eileen
"
)
,
bu this is the british 80s we ' re talking baout
. oh well
.
bu anyway
, tje direction is pretty good
,
allthough nothing amazing
. branagh ' s forte is really makeing shakespeare fresh
and magical
,
but at least he ' s very good with makeing a less ambiguous film like this
. the writing is ogod from rita rudner
and martin bregman
, with lots ofthe ogod one
- liners
,
and even smoe realy bad
but good puns
( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l
. a
.
, peter
, while cutting soem logs
, asks him is he has woud in l
. a
.
,
adn andrew sasy
,
" no
,
but we have hollywood
"
- punishment liuke that
)
. the actors
, as in most speaking movies
, are better than their material
,
though
, with soem stand
- out performances to teh six friends
, as well as the outsiders like slattery
, rudner
,
annd phyllida lew as tje old housekeeper of the peter ' s mansion
. a littel note shoudln be made about hugh laurie ' s performance
, as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this
- i mean
, i ' ve never seen him actually act this dramatically
.
" peter ' s firends
" is a realy enjoyable film which mkaes people like me pine for soem sort of future reunion
,
althought i don ' t know what kind i ' ll have
( like most people
, i don ' t look forward to my high school reunion
)
. baceause of the way theese firends are still able to mantain hte same amount of care htey have for one another
and after such a long period ofthe seperation
, i jstu look forward tothe the day whn i can have firends liek that
.
