and other hazardous materials from tyhe spooky old mental hospital in prepartion for relocating town offices there
. thier guided tour of the facility by a local official
, bill giggs
( paul guilfoyle
)
, brings them through smoe of the creepier parts of the former asylum
.
but
, a job is a job
adn
, if htey finish in a week
, as promised
, there isnt a
$ 10000 bonus in store
. as they get down tothe their work
, thnigs
, normal
and not so normal
, begin tothe hppen
. gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him
. phil
( david caruso
) is conflicted working with a guy

( josh lucas

, who is seeing his old girlfriend
. mike
( co
- screenwriter steven gevedon

- personality patient with a dark secret

, hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with somone
( something
?
) in the hospital
. tensions mount
adn distrust build among the rest as they watch theri chance for the bonus strat tothe slip awya
.
but
, htere is omre
, much more
, at stake as the hospital
annd its history of insanity weigh on them all
. i don ' t wnat to give away too much of thge story ofthe
" session 9
,
" so i ' ll stop there
. what we have here isnt a spooky horror flick thast uses none of the jump
- out
- at
- you
- from
- the
- dark cheap shots that have become part
and parcel with horror films since the advent of
" halloween
"
and
" friday the thirteenth
.
" htere is no cat leaping out ofthe the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a stratagically placed mirror
. with the exception of one shadowy
and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film
, there is little that yuo can git your arms around as far as wqat
, specifically
, is
" frightening
.
" as i watched
" session 9
" i became aware ofthe hte subtle things that built up durig the stopry that make it a true horror movie
. tjhe striking high
- definition video camera work by uta briesewitz
( who worked with the directer
, brad anderson
, on his
" next stop wonderland
"
) helps to build up tension with close
- ups
, fluid camera movement
anbd odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud
. music
, too
, is used tothe intense effect
, joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening
, even horrifying
. couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of
" the shining
,
"
" the blair witch project
"
anbd
, even
" the texas chainsaw massacre
"
and ytou get a decent
, intriguing horror flick
. additionally
, the brilliant dicision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character
, the institution itself
, hwihc lends even moreso chills tothe the equation
. acting is another factor taht raises
" session 9
" above thte usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like
" scream
,
"
" i nkow wqat you did lastr summer
"
and their sequels
. thsoe films took good
- looking
,
though generic
, young actors
and actresses
adn put them tothe ule to build up a body count
, substituting mayhem forthe real horror
. anderson opted
, instade
, tothe use mature
, experienced actors like peter mullan
and david caruso to fill his characters ' shoes
and the difference infact casting quality is notable
. mullan
, in particular
, puts an arc on his character
, gordon
, as the troubled guy who slowly
anbd inexorably falls under the pressures of family
, job
and
, finally
, danvers state hospital
. the rest of the small cast ift the bill as people
, not just fodder forthe the mayhem
. david caruso
, as gordo ' s senior man
and near equal in the busness
, shows jstu how good an actor he is
. he made the jump ffrom tv ' s
" nypd blue
" tothe film far too soon
and his descisions inspite the roles he took
( i ' ll never forget the horrendous
" jade
"
) were less tahn star making
. he rolls his sleeves uv
anbd doesnt the job well here
. gevedon
, lucas
and sexton are more than fodder
, too
. the onyl probelm with
" session 9
" lay in tjhe uninspired ending
. it takes onthe a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground
and isnt a bit of a disappointment after the terific
(
and inspired
) build up
. tyhe pleasure isnt getting there
and i wish that anderson
and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during tjhe bulk of the film
" session 9
" isnt an unusual feat
. it is scary
, doesn ' t ule cheap tricks
and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered
, subtle horror
. because of tje local interst of danvers
, it should dont well with yhe northeast crowd
. i hope it gets the national distrubution it deserves
. i give it a b
+
