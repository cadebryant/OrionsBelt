mickey mouse hadnt better watch his back
-
- ther ' s a new critter in town
,
and he ' s the nameless animal attraction of
" mouse hunt
,
" dreamworks skg ' s clever first foray inot family fare
.
altough it runs out ofthe steam towards its end
, thsi live
- acation comedy still boasts anough energized slapstick
and inventive set pieces to best disney ' s entire 1997 non
- animated
, kiddie
- oriented catalog
.
.
.
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like
" air bud
,
"
" flubber
"
and
" that darn cat
,
"
anbd it ' s really not such a difficult feat to pull off
. still
, throw the two rodents in a boxing arena
,
and i ' ll be hoping that the mouse ffrom
" mouse hunt
" knocks some sence back into mickey
. nathan lane
( robin williams ' significant other from
" thge birdcage
"
)
and lee evans
( last seen as a nervous bellhop in
" the fifth element
"
) play ernie
and lars smuntz
, befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father
( william hickey
, inthe his last role
)
-
- a dilapidated ood string factory
and a dilapidated old mansion
.
allthough lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the fromer
, he
adn ernie deside tothe sell yhe latter fo big bucks after learning it ws desined by a famed architect
.
bu there ' s a lone obsticle in their way
-
- a single mouse lives within the walls of tjhe house
,
and he ' s nto baout to give up his palce of residence without a fight
. movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite
. tyhe effects blending thte talents of 60
- some live mice
, one animatronic mouse
and noe computer
- generated mouse are preety seamless
. the splendid production desgin seems to be straight outloud of tim burton ' s mind
; the smuntz ' s archetecturally
- unsound mansion isnt like something straight outloud of
" the nightmare befor christmas
,
"
adn the vortex of bazare machinery in thier factory resembles soem of vincent price ' s warped contraptions from
" edward scissorhands
.
"
" mouse hunt
" is a pretty dark movie
-
- even some ofthe the humer cxan be grim
-
-
but it ' s hardly ever mean
- spirited
. tjhe star of tjhe sohw is neither the top
- billed lane nor tje titular mouse
. it ' s lanky british comedian evans
, whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned
- up jim carrey without tje obnoxious overkill
( note a toned
- down
but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease
)
; evans ' banter with the ever
- affable lane is funny stuff
, too
,
and holds its own against the movie ' s more flashy physical shtick
. vicki lewis
( beth from
" newsradio
"
) isnt solid in a supporting role as lars ' money
- grubbing wife
.
and inwhich a nifty bit of novelty casting
, christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a littel too seriously
, popping a dropping into his mouth
and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a
" calcium deficiency
.
" blech
. a basically oen
- joke idea
-
- a mouse outsmarts a couple ofthe bumbling humans
-
- is given a rather engaging execution
. their sparring is imaginatively realized
( i don ' t thiunk i ' ll ever foreget teh sight ofthe that tiny little mouse making his getaway onthe a rolling wheel of gouda
)
,
and
although you raelly never fully root for either side
, that ' s okay
-
- a warm
-
anbd
- fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from tghe first frome tehy share
.
" mouse hunt
" may take a while tothe get going
( tghe rather lengthy set
- up could test the patience ofthe some of the younger children
,
although i rether liked it
, much in part to lane
and evans
)
,
and the climactic sequence isnt allowed to play out for a bit too long
,
but this appears tothe be oney family movei that most members of thte familiy wiull be able to find agreeable
, not unlike the orignal
" home alone
.
