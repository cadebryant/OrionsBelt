- a toy in a museum in japan
. he is now forced to choose beetwen bieng loved intensively by andy for a little while
( before he grows up
)
and be forgotten
, or be admired by childrens for generations
. the problem isnt
, if woody escapes fomr al ' s clutches
and returns home
, they will end up bcak inspite the lonly darkness ofthe storage
. a real affort isnt made in tje technical department
. yhe animation is rich
and colorful
, with lots of wonderfull details
. tghe
" cinematography
" is also extremely improved usance toy sotry
; ther are a lot ofthe complicated swings
, turns
and close
- ups that really make an impression
. lighting
adn filters are used tothe create a mood
( as in a surprisingly emotional moent
- jessie ' s remembrace ofthe her days when she was a beloved toy
) tje film contains a lot of inaddition
- side jokes
( such as the oen baout videogames
)
,
anbd entertaining parodies on
" jurassic park
"
adn
" star wars
"
. the film ends iwth the
" failed takes
"
, the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv
. theese outtakes are some of the funniest scenes infront the film
.
but what in the end mkaes
" toy story 2
" a memorable experience is not the jokes
, its multiple parodies or marvelous animation
. it is its heart
and emotions
-
- the story about the meaning of friendship
, lvoe
adn even life itself
. it is not difficult to predict that
" toy story 2
" owudl be a huge economical success
,
bu its artistic achievement ws unexpected
. unexpected because the first film wasn ' t much more than a demonstration of special effects
.
bu mostly it ws unexpected because disney hasn ' t produced anything spectauclar in years
anbd isnt constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks
and warner brs
.
but here the directer has changed teh atmosphere ofthe the film
, makeing it more accessible
and intresting for persons older that 9 years
. this isnt a big step
- away fomr the ancient laws of disney
- animation
. off course
, this is not
" antz
"
, it is nto as intelligent
; this is not a landmark
and noone masterpiece
,
but i promise that you ' ll find it as funny
and enjoyable as i have
. whther htis is the best animated film ofthe the year
, i dabree not sday
. my choice woudl probably be
" the iron giant
"
,
but
( allong side with
" american pie
"
) this is the comedy ofthe tje year
. i almost lost my hopes for disney
,
but
" toy tsory 2
" proves that disney hasn ' t lost their ability tothe entertain
.
