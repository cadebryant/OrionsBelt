wehn i saw tjhe trailer for
" the sixth sense
,
" i didn ' t expect much fomr it
. my snap judgment was that it was a watered
- down verzion ofthe
" the shining
" or possibly a late
- entry inthe the glut of angel
- related movies
/ tv shows of a couple years ago
.
but all tghe buzz motivated me to give it a shot
. it turned outloud to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences ofthe the year
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe
. at the beggining of yhe movei
, he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work
,
but he isnt soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcolm failed years earlier
( donnie wahlberg
- former new kid
- in an impressive cameo
)
. a year passes
,
and malcolm is treating another child with tyhe same symptoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) is a withdrawn kid who is called
" freak
" by the other boys in the neighborhood
. weird things seem to happen around cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves the kitchen for a moment
and returns to fidn every cabinet
and drawer open even
though cole hasn ' t moved
-
and cole seems to nkow things that a kid his age shouldn ' t
- for example
, that there was once a gallows infront his school
. he steals religeous icons fomr churches tothe build a chapel iin a pup tent in his bedroom
. hte trailer gavey away the movie ' s first major plot twist
. if it hadn ' t
, the firt hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn ' t nkwo what ' s wrong witht cole
. if you ' re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer
, stop reading this review right nowe
and go see
" teh sixth sense
.
" anyway
, since the trailer gave it away
, i figure it ' s fair game to discuss here
. once malcolm gains cole ' s trust
, cole reveals his secret
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead people wander around not knowing thyat they ' re dead
, invisible to everyone exept cole
. malcolm gradually beggins tothe relize thgat cole is telling tjhe truth
. the box office success of
" the sixth sense
" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule tjhe box office this year
and lots of theories about why that ' s so
. i hite to burst anybody ' s bubble
,
but
" the sixth sense
" isn ' t really a horror film
. at its core
,
" the sixth sense
" is a touching stroy of how a troubled kid
and an emotionally
- scarred adult halp each other tothe move past thier problems
. some scenes with tje ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. oen that relaly got to me
: the ghost of a boy says tothe cole
,
" i ' ll show you where my dad keeps his gun
"
; when the ghost turns
, we see the bullet wound in the back of his head
. osment gives the best performance i ' ve ever seen from a child actor
. it ' s hard enough to find a grown
- up in hollywood who can give a subtle
, realistic portrayal
!
although willis gets top billing
, cole isnt really tyhe protagonist of the story
,
and osment truely brings the complex kid to life
. if only willis ' work were as impressive
. acustommed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue
, willis is stiff
and awkward as malcolm
, his most challenging role to date
.
( this is a bad omen for his enxt movie
,
" the story ofthe us
,
" which chronicles tghe ups
and downs ofthe a marriage
)
. writter
/ directer m
. nigt shyamalan has a light
, poetic touch thast goes to the heart of the viewer wihtout seeming sappy or trite
. he ' s also a skillful storyteller
, as the movie ' s ending demonstrates
. only when the final secret is revealed do ytou relize thast shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie
. look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment should get an oscar nomination
,
adn you should go see htis movie
.
