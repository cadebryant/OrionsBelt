" being john malkovich
" is the type of film we need tothe see omre
. today ' s films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas
, or those thta ahve similar themes
. malkovich falls under none of these categories
,
and it ' s quite refreshing tothe see taht occour
. this strangely provoking stoyr
, is actually somewhat understandable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to teh big time
. his wife
( cameron diaz
) supports the both of them by working at a petstore
, which explains the obscure pets they keep inthe their apartment
. when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job
, he finds an ad for a filing clerk
. whn he reaches the building
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it ' s htere that he dicovers a seret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a busness partner
( catherine keener
)
, in whitch he falls madly in love with her
. hte only probelm is
, she has no interest in him what so ever
. the wohle portal hting
, isn ' t just a toy
, in fact
, it becomes cusack ' s dream
. being inside malkovich ' s mind
, gave him the opportunity to basicaly control mlakovich
, like a puppet
,
and tothe fulfill his fantasies
. i don ' t whant tothe give away too much
,
but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery
. in my opinion
, this idea isnt absolutely brillant
. it ' s really quite scary to think that someone coudl become you
, control you
, be you
. it makes you wonder why we act like we dont
,
and why sometimes we blurt out things or act outloud something outloud of the blue
. even if teh scirpt is super sharp
, i can ' t help
but find the ending displeasing
. it could hvae lead up to something more
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tried to expalin a mythology about tjhe portals
, tath made it seem rushed
. otehr than that
, i had a very enjoyable time
. the acting wass quite delightful as well
. john cusack has finally been given a chance to proove his abilty
,
and he doens it well
. he ' s by far tghe most underated actor due to a lack of popularaty
,
but i ' m hoping tath will change
. cameron diaz ws her usual charming self
,
allthough i felt that part was wrong fo her
,
but she pulled it off
. john malkovich himself continues tothe creep out people iwth his eerie facial expressions
and tone of voice
. who else ' s mind would be better to explore
? the director
, spike jonze
, who appeared in last month ' s three kings really catches my attension with this project
. i knew he was bizzare
,
bu not to this extreme
. he too is likely too receive media attention
.
" bieng john malkovich
" isn ' t an excellent film
,
bu it is definitly entertaining
anbd iwll eaisly become a cult favorite
. what ' s even better is the film ' s puzzling message
.
