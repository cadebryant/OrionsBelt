" you leave little notes on my pillow
. i told you a millon times i can ' t stand littel notes on my pillow
. ' we are all out of corn flakes
- f
. u
. ' it took me threee hours to figure out thyat ' f
. u
. ' was felix unger
.
"
-
-
- a frustrated oscar madison
( walter matthau
) running down a list of his complaints agianst his roommate felix unger
( jack lemmon
)
, inspite the odd couple
. the classic neil simon comedy
( based on his own stage play
) about suicidal felix
( lemmon
)
, who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar
( matthau
) to stay with him in his apartment after felix ' s wife throws him out
and files for divorce
. the hook
: oscar is messy
and likes his apartment taht way
, while felix is an obsessive
/ compulsive neat freak
. the two men
, despite thier friendship
, instantly clash
. movies just aren ' t as delightfully funny as this one is
. every line of neil simon ' s dialogue flows like comedic poetry
,
and all tje actors are just perfect in their performances
. lemmon is at his best as yhe anixety ridden felix
,
but it ' s matthau who shines brightest as oscar
, whose world is being invaded
and rearranged
, mostly aginst his wishes
( teh type of character i alwyas enjoy identifying whith
)
.
and who can forget thgat catchy score by neal hefti
? the best thing about the film
(
and thsi is a testament to the quality of the writting
) is that it ' s a comedy with substance
. these two men
, even hwile at earch other ' s throats
, genuinely care for one anyother as friends
. when htey clash
, it isn ' t cartoonish hatred bieng displayed
,
but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good firends
but jstu cannot manage to co
- exsist
. movies nowadays
, take grumpy old men for exmaple
, just don ' t ahve that extra spark there
. theese days it ' s just animosity forthe the sake of comedy
. a television sories followed
( starring jack klugman
and tony randall
)
, which i ' ll admitt i ' ve never seen an episode of infront its entirety
,
adn neil simon even scripted the sequel
, the odd couple ii
, which was released in 1998
. neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece
though
. it ' s one of the best comedies ofthe all time
and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films
.
