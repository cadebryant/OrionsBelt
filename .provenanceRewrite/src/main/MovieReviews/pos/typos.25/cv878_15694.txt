" i know wqat you did last summer
,
" tje first high
- profile slasher thriller to be released aftter 1996 ' s
" scream
,
"
and writed by the same screenwriter
, kevin williamson
, isnt a stylish
, effective horror film that became 1997 ' s biggest hitted ofthe the fall season
. while
" scream
" was a more knowing film about thte genre
,
" i nkwo what you doed last summer
" is more reminiscent of a straight
- forward slasher flick
,
but it is far moreso inteligent than such bottom
- of
- the
- barrel gilty pleasures as all nine ofthe the
" friday tjhe 13th
" films
( well
, okay
,
" jason goes to hell
" was pure hell tothe sit thru
)
. the film starts off with four talented
, aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating twon of southport
, n
. c
. it is the 4th of july
,
and they will soon be heading their separate ways
. kind
- hearted julie
( jennifer lvoe hewitt
)
,
and outsider ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
) will be headed off tothe college
, while helen
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, who has jsut been honored croaker queen in the town
,
and her ignorant jock boyfriend
, barry
( ryan phillippe
)
, are gogin to new york tothe become an actress
adn football player
. wehn the four of them travel to a nearby mountain
- side beach for the evening
, they are dismayed after hitting a man infact the road onthe their way hmeo
. distraught
and confused
, tehy deside tehy can ' t go tothe the police because they iwll be charged with manslaughter
, so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean
, in hopes no one will find him
. julie isnt apprehensive about it
,
but is forced inot it by barry
. switch to exactly a year later
, julie
, still unable to cmo to terms with what she did
, reluctantly returns hmeo from college to find that all three of her old firends are still in the twon becasue thier career plans did not work out
. alomst immediatley
, julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads
,
" i know what you doed last summer
,
"
and that is tjhe strat of their problems as htey fidn themselfs being terrorized by a mysterous figure dressed inthe fisherman gear
and yielding a giant hook
.
" i know waht you did last summer
,
" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons
. tjhe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
,
annd other clever devices to add atomsphere tothe the proceedings
. the characters
, particularly julie
and helen
, are realistically written
,
anbd the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes
, hwihc is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort
.
annd last
, the film creates a fewd dazzling
and scary set
- pieces that are some of the most memorable i ' ve seen inspite a horror movie
, particularly the suspenseful
, superbly shooted sequence involving helen at her famaly ' s store with yhe killer inside with her
. perheaps the best character is that of missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thikns they hitted
. heche ' s performance is a standout
, as she is able to create a full character in only baout ten mintues ofthe screen time
.
" i nkow what you did last summer
,
" coudl have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems
. prinze jr
. gives a performance tothe be desired here
,
and much of his dialogue soudns wooden comming out of his mouth
. allso
, hte climax of the film almsot completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer
, who isnt a decidedly bad actor
and should not have been given any lines
. luckily
, the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale
, which includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- in
- your
- seat
" scare
. infront the main roles
, hewitt
and gellar are highly talented
,
anbd hewitt
, especially
, is one of the best screamers i ' ve ever herad
. she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a littel competition forthe the best
" scream queen
.
"
anbd gellar is touching as a young woman who
, in tyhe course of one year
, finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered
.
althought not up to the level ofthe either
" scream
" movies
, or thte more receet
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i know what you did last summer
" is a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made
.
