by phil curtolo mel gibson
( braveheart
) gave a gripping performance as tjhe father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard ' s ransom
. gibson plays toom mullen
, a wealthy buisness tycoon whose past actions are coming bcak tothe haunt him as a deranged psychopath
, played by gary sinise
( forrest gump
)
,
and his band of low
- life thugs kidnap his only son for
$ 2 million
. tom
adn his wife
, kate
, played by rene russo
( tin cup
) were instructed not to inform tyhe police
,
bu they contacted the fbi
. minutes later
, an elite team ofthe aggenst led by delroy lindo
( broken arrow
) are in tom ' s house
and wiring eveyr phone
. the plot sounds average
, just liek most other kidnap movies that you ' ve already seen
,
and it was nothing more tahn thta
. that is until about half
- way through the movei
. suddenly
, tom goes tothe tyhe fox 5 news room
anbd mkaes a live broadcast saying
,
" this is your ransom
.
but this is as close as yuo will ever get to it
. instead
, i am offering this money as a reward on your head
, dead or alive
.
" at this point
, the plot thickened
,
and thge unusually slow start ofthe tghe film turned into a suspense
- filled acation film with great stunts
. the last half of the film is very well done
. another hting that carries tihs film are tyhe superb performances by gibson
and sinise
, as they collide in a agme ofthe wits over their cellular phones for most ofthe the movie
. owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject
:
" it mkaes you wonder waht kidnappers doed befoer cell phones
.
" before this movie
, sinise played mostly
" good guys
,
" first in of mice
& men
,
then in forrest gump
,
annd most recently
, in apollo 13
.
but he was surprisingly devilish
adn cold infact his portrayal of a cop
- gone
- bad
. gibson
, of course
, was just being gibson
, in an oscar
- worthy performance
.
although most of the scenes were quite predictable
, ransom is a very intertaining
and suspenseful film
.
