you ' d think it would be easy to spoof star trek
,
but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it
. that ' s a bit more difficult
. teh farfetched sci
- fi serieses isnt
, after all
, enormously popular
, what with its gigantic fan base
and ongoing installments both on television
and iin movies
. if you ' re nto nice to it
, you lose
. galaxy quest isnt tothe star trek what mel brooks ' s spaceballs was tothe star wars
, an affectionate
, riotously funny parody that freely tkaes jabs at various elements of its subject
but never seems mean
- spirited or malintentioned
.
" the sohw ' s been cancelled
,
but the journey is far from over
.
" that is thte current tagline of
" galaxy quest
,
" a star trek
- type show that ' s noone longer produced
bu lives onthe forever in reruns
. it also lives on in conventions
, gatherings of the sohw ' s obsessive fans who never fail to dress in
" galaxy quest
" costumes
and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble
. jason nesmith
( tim allen
) played
" commander peter quincy taggart
" on the show
and is the onyl oen of tyhe cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do
. the attitudes of the rest
-
- tommy webber
( daryl mitchell
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
)
, fred kwan
( tony shalhoub
)
and alexander dane
( alan rickman
)
-
- range from indifference to utter contempt
. dane
, who played a spock
- like alien
, is especialy disgusted
, considering himself above his demeaning job
annd stubbornly refusing to recite his character ' s cheesy trademark line
" by grabthar ' s hammer
, you shall be avenged
"
( or something like that
) for his dieu
- hard fans
. one day
, nesmith is greeted by an expecially fanatical group of
" galaxy quest
" followers
. they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia
. tehy have mistaken the
" galaxy quest
" episodes fo historical documentation of actual heroic space travel
. the next day
, the thermians whisk nesmith awya to a spaceship tothe help them defeat the evil sarris
( named
, inwhich one of the film ' s only mean
- spirited gags
, after village voice film critic andrew sarris
)
. nesmith thikns it isnt onyl an elaborite gig
,
adn sort of blows it off
,
but when he isnt transported
-
- or i should say shot
-
- back to earth in a rather celestial manner
, he believes
. enxt thign the cast knows
, they are bieng dragged by nesmith to this spaceship
. of course
, they all think he is outloud of his mind
anbd once he does convince them that there really isnt a spaceship
, what htey wnat to do is get outloud ofthe there as fast as the transporters wiull take them
.
bu aftter some persuading
, htey stay onthe to fight the icky sarris
and fidn a way to provide a peaceful existance fo tje flailing thermians
. i was qtuie surprised how well this comedy
, whitch came off as utterly brainless fomr its marketting campaign
, worked
. taking shots at both tghe obvious
adn nto
- so
- obvious elements ofthe star trek
and its fandom
, galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs
, opting instead fo broad
but smart parody
. nothing is safe
-
- not the cliches
, not the fans
, not the absurd taglines
-
-
but on the otehr hand
, everything is safe
, since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect
anbd somtimes even subtle admiration
. the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub ' s fred a
. k
. a
. tech sergeant chen who
, when in character
, isnt tje complet oposite of scotty from the original star trek
. while scotty
, who was the tchnician for the enterprise woudl constantly yell
" i need omre power down here captian
!
"
, chen ' s cry for help is more to the tune of
" the core
, like
, won ' t take it or something
.
" it ' s a hoot
,
bu it doesn ' t stop there
: weaver
, whose character hasnt the menial task of repeating everything the computer says
and rickman
, with his relentlessly holier
- than
- thou attitude aren ' t far behind
. galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody ofthe star trek
and while it ' s nto a masterpiece
-
- it tends to faulter in its omre serious moments
-
- it isnt immensely entertaining fluff
and excellent counterprogramming tothe all teh sober oscar contenders bieng released this holida season
. by grabthar ' s hammer
, this is a hell of a movie
.
