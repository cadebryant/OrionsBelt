: the verma family is haveing a wedding
and all the relatives will come fo the multi
- day festivities
. mira nair ' s film isnt pleasant enough iwth a little human drama
, a few family secrets
, soem sadness
and some happiness
. you have seen it all befor
,
but perhaps nto fomr india
. the photography isnt colorful
anbd thte music is very agreeable
.

) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay
and mississippi masala
. her newest film
, written by sabrina dhawan
, isnt very simmilar tothe previvous films like betsy ' s wedding
bu it is set in newyorker delhi
. a wealthy famaly is haveing a wedding
. an indian wedding is a multi
- day affair as much a familiy reunion as a nuptial
. even more tahn inthe thte us
, it is an excuse fo a lavish
and extravagant family get
- together
. the film shows us whta tyhe family does toghether
anbd at the same time follows several family members ' individule tsory lines
. aditi verma is marrying hemant
, an indian engineer working in the us
. she had previously had a relationship with vikram
, her supervisor
. latit
, her father
( played by naseeruddin shah
)
, isnt juggling many problems
, not thge least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey
. dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating thte marigolds he uses for decoration
. even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes intersted in alice
, one of hte family servants
. several family members arrive giving ries to several plotlines involving sex
, family secrets
, or both
. there are heartbreaks
and there are peopel falling iin lveo
. some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films
. western audiences will apprieciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs liek women painting their hands iwth henna
. onthe tyhe otehr hand it wass not clear
( to me at least
) if scenes like yhe famaly singing toghether are typcial ofthe indian culture or if htey are a convention of indian musical films
. this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters
and the family speaking mostly english
. the latter will
,
however
, halp with an international release
. sabrina dhawan ' s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog
. we have seen films with plotting vrey much like this
,
but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference
. directer mira nair calls teh film an affirmation of life
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
