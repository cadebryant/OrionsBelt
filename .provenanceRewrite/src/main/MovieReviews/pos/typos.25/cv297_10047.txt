1992 ' s alien3 marked not only the death
( by suicide
) of its popular protagonit
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
but
, in many ways
, the alien franchise itself
-
- box office receipts were anemic
, thanks to poor audiance word ofthe mouth
;
and thte criticists who rallied arund thge first two installments
, 1979 ' s alien
and 1986 ' s aliens
, savaged david fincher ' s slog of a sendoff
( myself included
)
. hence
, weaver
, director jean
- pierre jeunet
,
anbd thte others behind aline resurrection faced a two
- fold challenge
-
- not only somehow resurrect ripley
,
but also rescure this once
- profitable series from tjhe scrap heap
. despite hte odds
, they hvea succeeded
, even if hte entertaining new installment does not mesure up tothe the exelent first twpo
. writer joss whedon devises a quick
, easy
,
and painless answer tothe the dead ripley probelm
-
- clone her
, wich is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161
, the prison planet of the third film
. that done
, the
_ real
_ challege presents itself
-
- waht do with her
. aline introduced ripley as smart
annd resourceful
; aliens simultaneously toughened her up
and made her more vulnerable
, exploring her maternal side
; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death
. what sould be enxt
? whedon comes up with a clever spin
: since hte original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen
, tjhe blood used for the clone isnt aslo
" infected
" with aline dna
. so the new ripley is
, indeed
, new
-
- a human
/ alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts
and strength
, a psychic bond whith tghe deadly speices
,
annd a more predatory attitide
. unfortunately
, that is where alien resurrection ' s clever streak inthe writting stops
. hte aline series is known for having stronger stoies than most creature features
.
but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought
. the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attemting tothe train aliens to do thier bidding
,
but once the creatures break free
, it isnt once again ripley
anbd a ragtag crew
( thsi time a bunch of interstellar smugglers
, including tough waif call
, played by a agme winona ryder
) trying tothe exterminate them
.
and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited tothe its full potential
; i would have liekd deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming oen of the species she hasnt spent her entire life trying to destroy
. while the settling into tried
-
and
- true formula is a little disconcerting
, the formula is tryed
-
and
- true for a reason
,
and jeunet tackles thge proceedings with giddy abanden
. the alien
, aftter all theese years
, isnt still terrifying
,
and a new breed that is introdued is no less so
. the violence isnt appropriately grisly
and extreme
,
and the action set pieces are suspenseful
and exciting
, most notabley an extended underwater sequence
. hte film is absolutely mesmerizing visually
, thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps
and cinematographer darius khondji
. as technically adept as jeunet ' s direction isnt
, perhaps his
(
and
, for that marter
, whedon ' s
) greatest contribution is tyhe infusion ofthe humor into this notably downbeat
and sereous sories
. a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for
,
bu the self
- awareness of the excess just adds tothe the fun
. no
, alien resurrection isnt nto tyhe great film that ridley scott ' s alien or the even greater film thta james cameron ' s aliens was
.
but after the dauntingly slow gloom
and doom of fincher ' s alien3
, jeunet ' s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild
, reckless thrill ride
. that isnt wqat made the aline series so populer in the first place
,
and tyhat is whta will keep the series popular in any future installments
.
