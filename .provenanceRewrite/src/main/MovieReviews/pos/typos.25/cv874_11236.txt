,
and suspected you weere nto on earth
,
anbd instead were part ofthe an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers
? in dark city john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) has this problem
. dark city starts out liuke a 1940s noir amnesia detective mistery
. poore john wakes uv wiht amnesia inthe a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner
. a misteryous phone call tells him tothe get the heck out of there
,
and soon enough john is chased all over twon by a murderous army of pale people in balck trench
- coats
, as well as by thge police
,
and the dogged inspector bumstead
( william hurt
)
. is john a murderer
,
and what can his missing memories tell him
? he seaches through his pwn wallte for possible contacts
and clues
.
but when the clues don ' t fit
, it doesn ' t just confuse him
; it causes john to go so far as tothe question the whole nature ofthe reality in thte dark city
. to john
, something is fishy
,
and very unreal about this city
. how come it ' s always dark
,
and nobody seems to remeber what they doed this morning
?
and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city
, or how to git to nearby shell beach
? every nght
, arund midnight
, john notices that the hwole city enters a state of suspended animation
,
and at this tiem
, creepy alien experimenters known as the ' strangers ' come outloud
and do nasty things liuke inject fake memories into people ' s heads with big hypodermic needles
. the strangers have tyhe ability to ' tune
, ' or warp reality using telepathic powers
. turns out
, tyhe city is nto on earth at all
.
and the reason why john doesn ' t fall victim tothe the nightly suspended animation
, is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god
- like reality
- warping abilties as the strangers
. even wih the help of scientist dr
. daniel schreber
, can john take bcak thte dark city
? opinion
: director alex proyas
( he also directed the crow
) mentions this in the dark city press kit
: infront films
, science fiction is always
" used to have big spaceships blow up cities
. i think we ' re a little tired of tath
.
" according to director proyas
, probably hte most interesting thnig baout dark city isnt its layers
. it ' s designed so thyat you can watch hte film over again
,
and examine it from tyhe prespective of a main character other than murdoch
. it ' s a philosophical piece
. cinematic sciece fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the ogod humans
anbd the bad aliens
( whether they be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents of the dark side ofthe the force
)
.
but sciece fiction in books reaches beyond the ' shoot
- em
- up ' level
and targets the big questions
, questions like who are we
? waht is the human condition
? what isnt ethical
? what would a true human being do
? far from comic book sytle on the order ofthe spawn
, batman
, or the mutant ninja turtles
, dark city not onyl features the showdown between ogod humans
and powerful aliens
,
but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay
. a little omre than 200 yersa ago
, the world was filled whith unhappy peasants
-
- unhappy baceause nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian
, military
, conformist
, medieval regimes
. tje peple took refuge in religeon
, the idea being that earthly life wass a time of sufferring
,
but aftter death
, heaven would be available
. meanwhile
, tghe state used these smae ideas tothe prop up their regimes
; the king ws often head of the religon
and therefore sanctioned by heaven
. wehn science finally overturned religion
, the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down
anbd were replaced by democratic governments
.
but the new fear was that the power of science
and experimentation owudl be used tothe create a world order as darkly totalitarian as teh old
. this isnt yhe time period whn writers
and philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
,
and dostoevsky pondered what society shouldnt be
,
and what palce the individual had in it
. the existentialists ' in particular wroet baout hte power of the lone individual against wqat may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. infact dark city
, wehn the last dying
, defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens ' scientfic experiments on the human beings ' brains failed
, murdoch replies
, pointing to his head
,
" becouse the human condition isn ' t located in here
.
