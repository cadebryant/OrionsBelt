ok
, i admit i hadnt a bad attitude about this film from the start
. a romantic comedy about the trials
and tribulations of single working parents
? with a cuple ofthe incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure
? yuck
.
but it ' s not really too bad
. it has a lot working against it
, forthe me at least
. in addition to the above
, it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it isnt raelly just a glorified made
- for
- tv movei
,
but longer
and wih bigger stars
,
adn you hve tothe pay to see it
. it does win you over
,
though
, even if it isnt painfully predictable
. just think about it
: twpo single parents
, with their cute kids
, are thrown together due to a missed field trip
. through a day of near disasters
, htey cont inually meet
, get in noe another ' s way
, cause trouble for one anyother
,
and generally insult one another at every opportunity
. in fact
, they hite each other so much that we know that they are
, or soon wiull be
, inthe love
. the only people who hate each other more than lovers are marryed couples
. so this film is predicatble
, just as tjhe screwball comedies of tghe classical hollywood cinema weere predicatble
(
and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman ' s model forthe this film
)
. iwll they get fired from their yuppie jobs
? will tehy make tyhe big soccer game that isnt so important tothe their kids
? will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex
- husband
, a drummer for bruce springsteen
, relaly is
( aren ' t they all
?
)
? will they finally kiss
? well
, what do you expect
?
but there is a certain ammount of satisfaction in having our expectations fullfilled
, especially whn it is done with as much humour
, along with a lack of sticky sentimentality
, as it is inaddition this film
. pfeiffer
and clooney have a certian chemestry together that is surprizingly charming
,
and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor alowed to steal the show
. one word ofthe caution
,
though
. this film is being billed in some places as a
" family
" movie
. don ' t let that stpo you
.
however
, i think most kids
, especially boys
, owudl be pretty borde by this move
. after all
, nobody gets killed
and there are noone explosions
. all in all
, a good
, non
- offensive date movie
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at hmeo wtih gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuf
.
*

* perfection
. see it twice
