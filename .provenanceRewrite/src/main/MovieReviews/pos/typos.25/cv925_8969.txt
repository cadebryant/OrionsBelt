contact is a film that tries to do sevral different things
. it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like
, tothe restore a sense ofthe wonder
anbd mystery to the issue of extraterrestial life
, tothe raise questions about science
adn faith
and how they woudl be relevant in such a situation
,
and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr
. ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
and the religious spokesman palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
. the film succeeds wonderfully at its first twpo goals
. the portrayal of the communiation fomr an alien world is much more reasonable
( albeit less immediately engaging
) than
, say
, the cold
- blooded destructiveness of tghe invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions
anbd genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line ofthe tv ' s the x
- files
. tyhe aliens in contact seem to be like us
- they are more curious than anything else
. htey know we exsist
, they want us to know tath they exsist
,
annd they woudl like to make the next step
adn communicate inwhich person
. the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens direcly
,
and between the characters ' ongoing speculation baout the extraterrestrials
and the oustanding visuals infront thge climactic
yot enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world
, that sence of wonder
and mystery comes through with a force rarley seen sicne stanley kubrick ' s 2001
: a spoace odyssey
. most of the film
,
howver
, takes place onthe earth
, where there isnt an extended publich deate on how to respond tothe these aliens
. scientists are enthusiastic
, ultraconservative religeous leaders are wary
,
and govorment officials are caught somwhere in between
. the debate is fueled largely by dr
. arroway ' s atheism
; she seems teh obvious choice tothe pilot the spacecraft for which tghe aliens have provided blueprints
,
but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind ' s representative to another species
. tyhe film is partly sucessfull infact raising
and exploring these questions
, expecially when it reaches a conclusion tath suggests that the two approachs
- science
and faith
- coudl be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed
. still
, the film falls a little short infact its representation of this conflict as it exists inwhich american society
. the twpo
" sides
" are represented primarily by arroway
and by far
- right fundamentalists
,
but in reality probably 80
% ofthe americans are neither atheists nor far
- right fundamentalists
. palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground
,
but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives
and comes acros as a less
- than
- ideal spokesman for any ideology
.
then again
, the film does oncentrate mostly onthe public debate
, which does
, affter all
, tend to be dominated by extremists
, rather tahn on dinner
- table or college
- dormitory discussions
. contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues
,
hten
,
but only withing the narrow scope tothe wich it confines itself
. the film ' s oen clear failure isnt in tyhe portrayal of the romance vetween arroway
annd joss
. for one thing
, it resorts tothe the tired movie clich
* that two attractive peple will immediately fall in love as soon as they apear onthe the screen together
, as there doens not seem tothe be any other reason forthe their instant mutual attraction
. the romance rarley
, if ever
, sheds any ight on the characters
,
altough it occasionally tries
and fails
- joss ' s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement
(
" i guess you could say i ' m a man of thte cloth
,
but without thge cloth
"
)
, for example
, is more liuke a punchline tothe a joke than character development
. instead
, the romance mostly seems tothe exist for the sake of later plot developments
. granted
, this is a plot
-
and idae
- driven film
adn the characters are secondary
,
but this jstu seemed liek lazyness on the writers ' part more thna anytying alse
. the successes of contact
,
howver
, far outweigh its failures
. even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether
( which it didn ' t
)
, the simple
yet mysterious story of aline communication still would have made it a memorable film
. contact doesn ' t quite cover all teh bases
,
but it covers about as much as oen could hope for in a two
- hour film
,
annd its rejection ofthe big
- budget theatrics forthe a moreso realistic story isnt certainly admirable
.
and i would not be suprized if
, ten years from now
, contact is mentioned in the smae breath as 2001
and blade runner as one ofthe the finest examples of sophisticated
and intellectually relevant science fiction
.
