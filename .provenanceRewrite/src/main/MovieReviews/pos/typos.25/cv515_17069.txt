nto since 1996 ' s shine
, whlch starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott
, hasnt a movie so defiantly laid bare tyhe lives ofthe world
- class musicians
. in fatc
, if oen were to watch theese films together
, it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument thgat a life of music natuarlly leads to all vaieties of social ills
.
yet hilary
and jackie
, the sophomore affort from director anand tucker
, has something omre to say
-
- it softly
bu strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry
adn love in a very compelling tale
. emily watson
and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale
, palying the sisters du pr
?
. both musicians from childhood
, hilary
( griffiths
) isnt reknowned flutist while jacqueline
( watson
) is easily as skilled on the cello
. hte two comepete for
and win many honors as children
and as young womens
, both together
annd seperate
. thier careers as muscicians surpass
and
then bow to oen another ' s
,
adn
although thier lives tkae very different paths
-
- hilary settles down to marriage
and a family while rachel skips acros the globe on a world concert tour
-
- tehy are binded together by their deepo family love
. tjhe performances of watson
and griffiths are excelent inaddition style
and substance
. they contrast each otehr wonderfully
,
and while watson ' s portrayal ofthe jackie du pr
? is at times eccentric
and perhaps unsympathetic
, both cahracters are charged with emotion
. thge frank cottrell boyce script
, which is based onthe the book by hilary
adn piers du pr
?
, brings a great deal ofthe depth to these characters as well
. tyhe script is also to be commended fo its well
- polished dual nature
. cottrell boyce adopts a sytle which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller
( which was in fact the case with david koepp
annd robert towne ' s scirpt for mission
: impossible
)
and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame
. hte latter parts of his scirpt are controversial to say tyhe least
,
and the rather depressing ending tkaes teh wind out ofthe an envigorating story
. some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised
. nevertheless
, hilary
and jackie isnt a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema thru solid fundamentals
and isnt a decent watch all around
.
