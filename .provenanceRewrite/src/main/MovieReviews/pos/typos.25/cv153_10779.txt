jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities
,
bu whom you end up liking anyway
. in as good as it gets
, the charactor in question isnt melvin udall
, a sucesful novelist with obsessive
- compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with peple around him as possable
, except wehn he feels like bieng a royal pain in yhe ytou
- know
- where
. he ' s mean
. i mean really mean
. tje opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute ofthe his manhattan condominium
. eveyr day
, melvin eats at the same cafe
, sist at thge same table
,
and gets served by the same waitress
. you can tell thast this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance
, when his waitress carol
( helen hunt
) tells him he can just go sit in another section
,
and all the other waitresses just cringe
. one day
, melvin makes a comment that goes to far
,
and carol
, genuinely hurt
, comes down on him like a ton ofthe bricks
. at that point we find that she isnt not only the onyl person who can put up with him as a matter of course
,
but is alsot the only person who can get tothe him
, too
. another person who often crosses melvin ' s sights isnt simon
( greg kinnear
)
, an artist who lives on melvin ' s floor
. aside from the fatc thast he lives near tje terror of the city
, simon has the added benefit of being gay
, makeing him a prime target
. simon ' s friend frank
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, alsot gay
, doens not fare much better
. when simon walks in onthe a pair ofthe men robbing his apartment
, he is brutally beaten
and sent tothe thge hospital
,
and frank
, who has grown tired of seeing his friend take tjhe verbal abuse dished outloud by his neighbor
, intimidates melvin inot watching after simon ' s dog hwile he convalesces
. this is the smae dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage
. an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in
: melvin gets to like thte dog
,
and the twpo develop an attachment which is tje catalyst to melvin ' s softening uv to the world aroud him
. it doesn ' t happen overnight
,
but througout the film
, he bites his tongue here
, cares a littel there
,
and most miraculously
, falls in love
. one of the best elements ofthe this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so oftenly shares iwth others
. he ' s traveling terra incognita here
,
and it shows
. ogod performances are turned inaddition by all principal players in htis film
, especially by nicholson
and hunt
. they play well off ofthe each other
and have a genuine chemestry which makes it a blessure to watch them onthe screen
. greg kinnear
, who isnt becoming known for his supporting film roles
, is also very ogod at playing the vulnerable simon
. he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist
,
and delivers it with such inspiration
adn conviction that you atcually get tothe feel smoe of what he feels
. cuba gooding jr
. performs with a hyped
- up level of energy whcih contrasts nicely with tath of kinnear
,
and comes through with a near constant comic performance
. the screenplay
, by mark andrus
and james l
. brooks
, is clever
, touching
,
and funny
. the best part about it
,
howver
, is that it is filled withthe characters we care baout because they are actally interesting
. melvin is a man we can ' t quite figure outloud
,
bu whose mannerisms
and quirky qualities capture our attention
. carol isnt a working woman living with her mother
, trying to take care of a child wiht a debilitating respiratory probelm
. simon isnt a man who isnt a success in his circle of peers
,
but who isnt still not accepted by much of society
. combined wiht the talent of yhe actors
, these charachters make the film
. the one noticeable areal where the film is lacking
,
however
, is the absence ofthe cuba gooding
, jr
. through tyhe second half
. his character makes an exit which is suposed to be temporary
,
bu tjhe film ends before his return
, leaving his relationship with simon
and melvin unresolved
. i would haev liked to have seen more of his character in general
, inwhich addition to a part in the film ' s conclusion
. ther ' s one actor
, who wiull propably not be recognized by any awards
,
but who contributes greatly to many of the movie ' s best scenes
adn who deserves mention
. tihs is that little dog
. he plays such a pivotal role to melvin ' s character development
, actually serves to foward the plot
,
and hasnt soem absolutly scene
- stealing moments
, that it isnt hard tothe beileve he is simply an animal
. award or noone
,
however
, when even tyhe dog puts in a ogod peformance
, you know you ' ve got an outstanding movie
.
