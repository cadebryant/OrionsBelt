well
, i know that stallone is 50 years old now
,
but in daylight he doesn ' t look it
! daylight is a great disaster movie
. if ytou ' ve seen cliffhanger
, you ' ll nkwo stallone ' s charcter already
. a guy withthe a bad past
,
but isnt in the right place at the wrong time
. a tunnel connecting new york
and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide wtih a truck carrying
* very
* flammable toxic waste
. a dozen or so people survive the collapses
anbd the incinerating fireball
(
and what a fire ball it was
!
) stallone
, a former emergency medical service man
, isnt chauffeuring a rich couple around
, when they reach yhe outside ofthe the tunnel
, befoer the explosion
.
thn
, 30 minutes inot tje movie
, boom
!
> from here on
, the plot takes a back seat
,
and we are treated to smoe of the best camera work
and acation staged
. most all the action is plausable
anbd will hold you at the edge of your seat
. there are a fewd melodramatic parts here
,
but
, htey tend to work out well
. there isnt no general antagonist in thsi film
,
but the action
and suspense mkaes you forget all about that
. daylight is a great film
, i saw a non
- matinee showing of it
,
and i thought it was worth every penny
. the characterizations are mostly flat
, one dimesional
,
but they haev enough in them tothe get yuo tothe care for some of tyhe charachters
. rob cohen
( dragonheart
) doesnt a great job whith this film
.
