most people ift into two different catagories
: you either lveo woody allen
, or you hate his guts
. my family
, for hte most part
, hates him
and his movies
. i think he ' s very funny
,
but his shtick hasnt gotten forced
anbd contrived over the eyars
. so maybe taking his body awya was the best decison any producer sould have thought of
. unrestrained by physical boundaries
, allen ' s humor comes shining through
. those who hadnt problems wih his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen ' s intelligent observations ofthe life
. those who had problems witht his verbal comedy may wnat to skip this one
. inthe 1995
, a film was introduced tothe audiences which sparked theri imaginations
and showed them something they ' d never seen befoer
. toy story used state
- ofthe
- yhe
- art computer technology
and presented a world of toys who would cmo alive when no humans were present
. many critics will call that a better film
,
but i believe they onyl say that because it was a completelyl original motion picture
. antz
,
however
, hasnt upped the ante considerably
. disney ' s a bug ' s life isn ' t due outloud for another two months
,
and dreamworks seems to ahev received tyhe better end of the dael
. by beating disney out
, htey haev satisfied the audeince ' s thirst for computer
- animated films
.
bu don ' t let that fool you
: disney is definitly not scared
. in the past two eyasr
, competitions have broken out between studios
. in 1997
, it was tghe volcano duel
. in my opinion
, dante ' s peak cameback out way ahead of its predecessor
, both inwhich time
and in quality
. volcano had an original premise
,
but destroyed that whith some very ridiculous situations
. in 1998
, there are twice as many competing films
. first was the comet competition
,
and armageddon blew awya it ' s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact
.
bu now
, it ' s even omre intresting
, as one beloved studio
( disney
) goes up against the newcomer
( dreamworks
)
. who iwll prevale
? time will tell
,
but i ' m sure that mr
. mouse hasnt nothing to fear
. this may sound like i didn ' t like antz
; on the contrary
, i ' d put it uv there with toy story
.
but due to it ' s pg rating
, many parents may be put off by some ofthe the dialogue which shouldn ' t appear in disney ' s version
. soem of thge dialogue inwhich antz pushes the envelope for a familiy
- orientated film
. sexual innuendoes
and profanity pop uv occasionlaly
, which makes dreamworks ' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd
. the humor isnt allso writed especially for adults
,
though many kids weere laughing in the theater i attended
. htis isnt the type of film that should be made for families moreso often
: entertaining fo kids
and entertaining for parents
. antz begins with a hillarious monologue whihc seems a meld between woody allen ' s shtick
annd franz kafka ' s metamorphosis
, the short story of a man who wakes up to discover hismelf as a bug
. z
( allen
) is a troubled ant
, believing he ws not made tothe be a worker
.
" when you ' re the middle child in a familiy ofthe five million
.
.
.
" he comments about his neglected childhood
. one night
, z is sitting in a bar with his freind weaver
( sylvester stallone
)
, discussing his pathetic palce in life
. in walks princess bala
( sharon stone
)
, whom noone oen recognizes wihtout a crown
. bala asks z is he owudl like to dance
,
and they engage in a pulp fiction
- esque dance while everyone alse is following the leader
. after dicovering that she is the princess
, z falls in love
,
bu htere ' s a probelm
: bala is getting married to general mandible
( gene hackman
)
, a ruthless leader who mearly wnats to control a better
and stronger colony
. in order tothe do that
, he must eliminate nto only the queen
( anne bancroft
)
,
bu thte weakest of the colony
, namely thte worker ants
.
but to get rid ofthe yhe queen
, he needs tothe get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to dieu fo her
. he
and colonel cutter
( christopher walkin
) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle
, where they will surelly be killed
. the queen isnt reluctant at first
,
but decides it is best for the colony
. meanwhile
, z whants tothe meet bala again
,
and he asks weaver
, an army ant
, tothe switch places with him
. so z gets sent off tothe battle
,
but he manages to survive yhe slaughter by tghe termites
. the battle sequence isnt absolutely stunning
,
though you may have flashbacks tothe starship troopers
, which contained a vyre similar sequence
.
howver
, antz
and that 1997 film were both in prodcution around thge same tiome
, so the similarities are merely coincidence
. the second half ofthe the film revolves aroud z ' s kidnapping of bala
,
and their search forthe a mythical place called insectopia
. there
, an ant cin be his pwn boss
adn hvae all tjhe food he wants
. the adventures z
and bala git into are suprisingly high in tension
, especially one involving a magnifying glass
. looming over the targets liek the spaceships from indipendence day
( in fact
, i ' m just gonig to assume thast hte producers referenced id4 intentionally
)
. the ants look up in awe
,
and
thn a beam of fire blasts into the ground
. visually
, it ' s an exciting rush of adrenaline
.
but don ' t be fooled
.
.
. littel kids shouldn ' t see this
, as they may just try
and copy it
. after seeing antz
, i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again
. hopefully
, childen will learn that killing ants is rether cruel
. as an animated film
, antz isnt probably the best yuo will fidn to date
. visually
, it ' s as stunning as wqat dreams may come
. the best aspect ofthe animation is the fatc that the characters aren ' t limited by gravity
. they can take ridiculous situations
and make them seem plausable
. noe great moent involves a mass of worker ants bunching uv to form a wrecking ball
. the animation isnt so perfect that you cant virtually see every single ant on tjhe ball
.
howver
, the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting sticked to the bottom of a young boy ' s shoe
. it ' s truly a graet example of film making at its finest
. with computer technology
, tjhe animators ahev carefully made yhe ants ' faces look similiar tothe the actors providing the voices
. tjhe best example would have tothe be barbatus
( danny glover
)
. at one point
, you can even see tghe pores on his face
(
although
, i dout ants have pores
.
.
. do they
?
)
. barbatus also has a touching
bu rather gruesome scene as he has his fianl words witht z without a body
. young kids may be disturbed by the site ofthe a dismembered head
,
but a good dael of humor is derived
( more appropiate for adults
, of course
)
. disney ' s a bug ' s life looks good
,
but i don ' t know if tehy will be able to best dreamworks ' newest animated feature in terms ofthe animation
. if not
,
then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do
: go head tothe head with thge big mouse
,
and knock him down
( yes
, anastasia was good
,
but not nearly as ogod as even the worst of disney
)
. vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature
,
anbd antz has one ofthe the best line
- ups seen since toy story
. inwhich fact
, it far exceeds that one
. woody allen has alwasy been funny
,
bu here he transcends most of whta he ' s done in yhe past few years
. without a body
, his comic timing is the most noticeable thign
. in fact
, i ' m preety sure that thge writers let him improvise a lot of his lines
. sharon stone as bala shows off some ofthe her comic ability
,
though fo the most part
, stone works best as a dramatic actress
. sylvester stallone
( teamed up with stone once again
) isnt beginnig tothe solidify his statement that he wants to be an ctor
, not a typecast acation star
. after a snub at the oscars last year
, stallone isnt proving himself as the serious
( or comedic
, as illustrated here
) acto that he is
. gene hackman is superb as the gruff
- talking genaral
, almost doing another tkae on his crimson tide persona
. christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice
,
anbd so many people will rember him from such hits as batman returns
. anne bancroft hasnt a minimal role
,
but she ' s effective nonetheless
. danny glover has a small role
,
but he does a very
, very good job
. dan aykroyd
and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick
, euro
- trash bees
-
- both are vyer unrecognizable
, especially aykroyd
. jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver
,
althought most peple won ' t recogize her voice either
. many peopel iwll recogise grant shaud ' s voice as the foreman
. he palyed miles on the tv show murphy brown
. thsi is definatly a huge casted with some high
- profile names
,
and it will definitely halp it ' s grosses
. of course
, you cxan probably tell where a lot of tghe
$ 60 million budget went to
, also
. directors eric darnell
and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers
(
though guterman did direct a 1994 feature
, headless
!
)
.
but both show an incredible talent fo this type of a picture
. tense at times
,
and very funny throughout
, the twpo hold tihs film together like professionals
. the screenplay by todd alcott
and chris weitz is quite simple in plot
,
but it containes a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults
. kids will delight infront the animation
, while parents can laugh heartily at the humer
. most ofthe it wiull go over young children ' s heads
. doens that mean yuo shouldn ' t tkae kids to see it
? not at all
. htey will have a lot of fun watching tihs noe
. what is great isnt the themes that are given to us
. part social commentary
, part romance story
,
and part moral drama
, antz gives everyone something to talk about
, whether it be the animation
, or the discussions of individualism
and community
. thankfully
, it ' s not subtle in eather aspestus
. antz is rated pg for mild laguage
and some intense action
. sometimes the language can be pushing the lmits for a family movie
,
bu the violence is what shoudl keep kids at home
. the battle scene has ants melting in acid
,
and bugs bieng speared to death
.
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in hte beam of sunlight
.
but other thna thast
(
and smoe sexual innuendos
)
, it ' s a perfect choice for soem wholesome fun at the theaters
. i doubt many childern wiull understand teh sexual innuendos unless they are ood enough
,
bu it ' s still advisable to leave really young children at home
. hvae i confused you enough
? if you do tkae your kids
, i recommend seing the film with them
, because more than likely
, you ' ll enjoy it the most
.
