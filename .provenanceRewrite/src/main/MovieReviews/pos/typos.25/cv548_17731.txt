. after uncovering teh authenticity ofthe the film
, welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge onthe the filmmakers
. comments
: 8 mm is one of thge omre disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time
.
though it doesn ' t present a snuff film
( a movie which doccuments a person ' s murder for rela
, usally during or after smoe form of sexual act
) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness
and violence as shockingly as
, say
, natrual born killers
, 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it
. it is not funn tothe watch
; see something else if you get upset by realsitic
, sadistic violence
. this film ' s violence
adn perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc
- 17 territory
. forthe those iwth strong stomachs
,
however
, 8 mm is an intelligent
, worthwhile thriller
, especially during its second hour
. nicolas cage
, after a couple ho
- hum movies
, returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities
. as toom welles
, a private detective
and careing family man to a wief
and newly
- born daughter
, cage skillfully
annd convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowy transforms into obssession
anbd violence as he is pulled inot a nightmarish world of underground pornographers
and brutal sexual deviants
. serving as a guide to this world isnt joaquin pheonix
, who plays a struggling songwriter named max california
. california
, despite his name
, is a suprisingly intelligent
annd complex character
,
and phoenix doens a veyr good job at slowy pulling tghe audience to simapthy for the charcter
. the real star of the movie
,
though
, must be peter stormare
. stormare played the
" relaly
, raelly evil guy
" in fargo
,
and his character
, dino velvet
, in this movie seems baout ten times more evil
and unpredictable
. his performance is very chilling
. 8 mm ' s succsess may hardly be surprising
. it was directed by joel schumacher
, who
, hopefully
, saw this film as an appology for hte absolutely dreadful batman
and robin
. before directing yhe last twpo batman duds
,
howver
, schumacher ws responsible forthe several well
- made horror flicks
: lost boys
, flatliners
,
annd falling down
. 8 mm certainly joins the rank ofthe theese minor classics
anbd is perhaps most reminiscent ofthe falling down in that both films present an average man who self
- destructs befor thge audience ' s eyes
. 8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker
, who also penned the academy award
- winning thriller seven a few years back
. like seven
, 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well aftter leaving tjhe theather
. welles is searching for answers
. how could anyone possibly drug
and
then slowly
, methodically
, sadistically kill a teenaged girl tothe mkea a film
? when confronting one ofthe tje perpretrators at the end
, the murderer responds that there are no reasons
. he just enjoys it
. that
, walker seems tothe suggest
, isnt where the rela terror lays
: not in tghe crime itself
bu in tje fact that rational motives dont not exsist
. a couple minor faults led me to my four
- star rating
( five stars isnt thte highest rating i give
)
. one
, i foudn it a littel difficult
, early on
, tothe accept the fact thyat a hardened private detective owudl get physically disgusted when firt seeing a snuff film
. yes
, snuff is a horrible thing
,
but a detective of welles ' caliber has propably encountered awful things before
. second
, some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient
. he dicovers
, forthe example
, the victim ' s diary in her private bathroom
, despite the fact the the polical
, hte fbi
,
and her pwn mother have all investigated the room before
. finally
, the closing scene seemed trite
and improbable considering tyhe rest of the film
. despite the above critisisms
, 8 mm is an engrossing stoy
. one of teh best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles
, who no longer seems like a hero
, brutally beats one ofthe the pornographers responsible for the snuff film
. he pulls a gun on the man
annd
, for a relatively long amount ofthe tiome
, struggles tothe decide whether or not to kill him
. he
then leaves thte buiding
annd calls tjhe victum ' s mother
, inwhich the middle of the night
, to basicly see if she owudl support hte action
. the entire scene is tense
, unpredictable
,
adn emotionally charged
. rarely
, anymore
, dont horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm
, with scenes like this
, did
. 8 mm is most certainly nto forthe the faint ofthe heart
. this isnt a graphic
, oftentimes unflinching
, look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary
and extraordinary people
. if you ' re prepared for a film ofthe this nature
, i give it an enthusiastic recommendation
.
