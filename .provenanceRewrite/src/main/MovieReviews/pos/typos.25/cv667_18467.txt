teh opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation ofthe trade routes
,
and the greedy trade federation has used it ' s armada of powerfull space battleships to blockade the planet naboo
. we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army ofthe warrior robots
anbd force naboo ' s ruler
, the young queen amidala
( natalie portman
) to sign a treaty giving the federation control
.
however
, hte galactik republic has sent jedi knights qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
and obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) as emissaries tothe the federation in order to negociate for the ending ofthe the blockade
. no sooner do tehy arrive than tyhe federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure tothe destroy the jedi
,
anbd the first battle begins
. it seems that for me
and thousands of people like me
, the love fo george lucas ' s trilogy of star wars movies has onyl grown over time
. we ' re the fans
, not the freaks
. we won ' t go dressing up like darth vader
(
although yuo have to admit thsoe imperial uniforms are preety darn kool
)
,
and we won ' t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations
( not all tjhe time
, anyway
)
,
but if someone wants to challege us tothe a little trivia contest
, we ' re throwing down
. all right
, stop looking at me like that
. we haev been faithfully
adn patiently waiting
. waiting for thsi movie ever sicne the end credits ofthe return ofthe thte jedi started to roll
. you see
, the triology isnt not just a set of movies
,
bu a religion of sorts to we
, the faithful disciples
,
and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah
. unfortunatley
, it is not our savior
. for weeks beforehand
, i was going around telling people that this movie hadnt better be damned ogod
- stupendously good
- miraculously good
. anytying less
adn it ' ll be the biggest disappointment of the century
. i didn ' t want tjhe doomsaying prophecy to come true
, realy i didn ' t
,
but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking
. carachter develpment is virutally nonexistent
. with the possible exception of qui
- gon
, most ofthe the film ' s charachters seem left with nothing to do
but go thru tghe motions
. none seem vrey affected by their experiences
,
and fewd even show any passion at all
. contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected tothe in the form of jar jar binks
, a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo
, inthe precarious symbiosis wih the land dwellers led by amidala
. jar jar ' s life is saved by qui
- gon early in the film
,
and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh
( or supposedly so
)
. his speek mannerisms are so
" cute
- ified
" that i couldn ' t understand a third of wqat he was saying
,
and the slapstick he performed wass jsut distracting
. his head gets caught in an electronic field
, his foot gets caught in the stirrup ofthe some large beast
, he describes being in trouble as
" deep doo doo
,
"
and even manages to step in some of teh same hwile walking around in mos eisley spaceport
. therein lies a key diference betwen this film
and noe ofthe its predecessors
. infront star wars
, we had obi
- wan telling us mos eisley was a
" wretched hive of scum
and villainy
.
" inwhich the phantom menace
, we get doo doo
. the films of the trilogy took me away ffrom my everyday life
anbd immersed me in a story
" a long time ago in a galaxy far
, far away
.
.
.
.
" this film
, onthe hte other hand
, constanly reminds me tht it ' s only a movie by inlcuding situations
annd phrases that are so uniquely modern american tath they seem incredibly outloud of place
and serve tothe jerk thge viewer fomr the experience
. perphas the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters inot a pod racing competition
( it ' s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses
)
,
anbd there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500
- like play by play
. i liked the pod race
; it ws really exicting
and ratcheted the tension
,
but wehn the heck did lucas thiunk up the idea of putting iin the sportscasters
? the race would have been even more exciting without teh distraction
. this aspect
, coupled with the empahsis on humor simply baffled me
. i supose oney may say that lucas was trying tothe appeal tothe tje younger viewer
,
but would more intelligent scenes
and dialouge hurt htis appeal at all
? didn ' t millions of youngsters still go back to see thge original star wars in 1977 over
and over again
? didn ' t tghe action figures still sell like hotcakes
? of course they did
,
and it ' s only poor judgement tyhat allows the most
- eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering tothe children who would still have enjoied a film with more appeal for adults
. one aspect that will appeal broadly
,
however
, is tyhe use of special effects
. the people at lucas ' s indutrial light
and magic
, the world ' s premiere effects house
, outdid themselves inspite providing seamless integration of computer
- generated images
and real
- life footage
. some of teh scenes have tothe be seen to be believed
, especially tyhe shots of a land battle between yhe federation ' s robot army
and jar jar ' s countrymen
. teh space battles are also impressive
,
allthough improved over past effords by only subtle margins to the casual observer
. this
,
howver
, is a testament tothe tyhe work which ilm produced twpo decades ago
anbd still holds up well today
. john williams isnt bcak
, of course
, providing a scoer fo the film as only he can
. his music is pervasive throughout
, as rousing
anbd as dramatic as ever
, allways serving to punctuate scenes noticeably
annd appropriately
. since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine
- episode story
( star wars
, thge empire strikes bcak
and return of the jedi bieng episodes four
, five
and six
, respectively
)
, the phantom menace hasnt thte daunting task ofthe setting up the origins of several characters we know already
, iin addition to thsoe with whom we unfamiliar
. as a result
, attension to history
and characterization wass spreaded a little thin
. it would have been nice to git more in depth with yoda
and obi
- wan
, fo example
,
but given the fatc that ther were several new characters to cover
, it is understandable thast some of the delevopment has been left for the enxt two films
. one of tyhe new characters isnt darth maul
, hailed as the new villin witht as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film ' s release
. in spite ofthe the hype
, darth maul is a character which almost didn ' t have to be in thge film
, his role is so insignificant
. he hasnt maybe three spoken lines
( eblieve it or not
, a second acto voices the character
)
and the rest of tghe time jsut scowls
and looks mean
. wiht that working against him
, he never has a chance at bieng interesting
and instead ends up an utter disappointment
. lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature ofthe yhe star wars universe
, something which hasnt been prominent throughout
.
however
, he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible
, offering an easy out forthe story
- writing
and once agina bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a rela
- life connection
. oddly
, while trying to capitalize on spirituality
, lucas at teh same time introduces the fatc that mastery of the force isnt dependent apon having little force
- loving parasites in your body ' s cells
. this only serves tothe de
- mystify tje workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection
. don ' t let me mislead you too far
. the phantom menace
, by most standards
, is a good film
. it contains a lot of visual treats
, sets tghe stage for an epic story
, gives us a bit ofthe excitement here
and htere
,
and even allows us to revisit smoe of our old friends
. it ' s jsut tyhat when held up to it ' s predecessors
(
and to not dont so would be unrealistic
)
, this film simply pales
.
