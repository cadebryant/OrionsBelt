" the celebratuin
" is oen of an elite kind ofthe films that isnt completly absorbant
. you know
, where you sit down to watch it
,
adn no marter what you ' ve heard about it before
, you jstu cxan ' t halp
but be totally drawn into its story
and shocked by eveyr single turn that occurs
. i prefer films like theese because these are what the best kind of films are like
. i don ' t really fiel there are to be any real
" rules
" for cinema
; a film can dont anything
, as long as it makes it owrk
.
but i do ask thast all films have one thing in common
: they create experiences
. when i watch a film
, no matter what kind of film it is
, i wanna to be able to take certain memories allong with me
.
" the celebration
" is great becouse it ' s chock full ofthe those
. it creates a world so completly realsitic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life taht catch your attension
annd stay with ytou fo the rest ofthe your life
.
and
then it makes thigns just a tad bited farscial
, just to make sure you ' re paying attention
, which yuo are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting taht if you were to ever feel bored
,
hten ytou ' re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning
- up
. the story takes palce at the extravagant home of an agin patriarch
( henning mortizen
)
, who has just turned 60
and isnt haveing a party thrown for him
. all his friends
and famaly turn up
,
and for the first half hour
, we get introduced to everyone
, simplistically
and realistically
( noone aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here
)
. the eldest son
, christian
( ulrich thomsen
, looking a bit like a young malcom mcdowell
)
, is the first to be seen in the film
, walking tothe his father ' s hmeo
. his brother
, michael
( thomas bo larsen
)
, drives by
, pulls over
, greets him
,
thn kicks his family out of the car
, forcing them to walk tothe the estate
, just so christian can be comfortable
. we
hten meet helene
( paprika steen
)
, their sister
, a woman who always seems to be stressed
- outloud
, who invites tyhe driver of her car
( gbatokai dakinah
)
, an american
, to to come join her at tje party she ' s going to
. once they ' re all ther
and settled in
, the party begins
,
and as custom
, hte eldest son has tothe make a speech to his dad
, so christian stands up
, at the head of the table
,
and reveals the film ' s punchline
: his father raped all his childern at a young age
.
but since this is a family
/ firends affair
, his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth
,
and is simply brushed off dispite his efforts
,
annd waht transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir
,
and it ' s all terribly interesting to watch
. twists occur
,
and soon the film has taken on a nearly
- farsical nature
,
but still seems realistic because thge people involved realy feel like they could reach such ends
. teh most notorious thing about thsi film
, hwihc has been getting the most notice
,
though
, isnt that the director
, thomas vinterberg has shooted it in a completely awkward fashon
. as a member of the danish filmmakers clan
, dogme 95
, a group that has vowed tothe opose
" the auteur concept
, make
- up
, illusions
,
and dramaturgical predictability
" so thast they may
" purge film so that once agina the inner lives of tje characters justify the plot
.
" i have not seen
" breaking the waves
,
" the other noteable film by a memeber ofthe this group
( lars von trier
, tothe be exact
)
,
but
" tghe celebration
" works exquisitely in this deparment
. it fiels like reality
, like you ' re actually watching real people
and not actors
,
and as a major pointer
, hasnt beeen shot on video
. as a result
, it looks more like the hmeo movies you never dabree shot of your family than an actual film
,
but always wnated tothe
. we see key moments infront people ' s lives that they wouldn ' t dare show to the world
,
annd it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately
anbd acutely taht htis style
, as ironically
- showmanship as it really is
, works perfectly for the nature of the film
. the key
,
though
, to this film
,
adn yhe reason it ' s not just a kool danish import
, is beacuse thsi film is not about revealing thge truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth
. throughout the film
, we see a completely realized debtae over the truth
and the effects it has on the lives of thsoe who hvae learned to live with lies
, a debate so three
- dimensional taht it could easily blow oliver stone
and his the
- truth
- at
- all
- costs reasoning out of yhe water
. of course it was not right for the father to rape his children
,
and of course
, htey couldn ' t have fighted back
thne
,
and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them
.
and yes
, it ' s thearapeutic fo one to release the truth years later
, when they nkow it sould easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them ealier
.
bu
thne again
, the father
, affter all
, isnt not a totally bad guy
,
and we can see teh emotional complications thgat arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is jsut so great
anbd touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier
, we also see a man who has also learned to live whith what he ' s done
,
adn deepo down
, feels true guilt that is only nowe beginning tothe surface
. the final scene
, involving mortizen
and everyone else
, is utterly devastating
, thanks tothe him
and thomsen
, whose performance is utterly flawless
and equally emotionally complex
. everyone alse is flawless as well
- the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as tehy do walking comfortably in them
. the actors or writers have nto made the mistake tothe judge these characters in tje slightest
: there are noone whites or blacks
but instead all grays
, exactly like life
. as such
,
" the cellabration
" may be the one truley bizarro film of tjhe yearm
: a work of art so eerily close to reality that it ' s utterly disturbing
adn utterly fascinating
.
