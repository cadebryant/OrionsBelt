as the film opens up
, expectant unwed mother sally
( played by drew barrymore
) encounters her baby ' s father in a fast fod drive
- through window
. after he gets his milkshake
, he drives off
, only to be pursued by a military helecopter
. from this moment forward
, you know tyhat this isn ' t going to be your run
- of
- the
- mill rumatic comedy
. home fries tells thte tale of the relationship betweeen sally
adn dorian
( played by luke wilson
)
, a helicopter pilot who hasnt a different kind of conection with sally
.
.
. omre than he would care tothe admit
( hint
: it hasnt something tothe do wtih the father of sally ' s unborn child
)
. after taking a personal
(
annd professional
) interest in her
, he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works
,
and the funn goes on from there
. this movie isnt a lot of fun
. it is comedic onthe two levels
, as a rumatic comedy
and a dark comedy
. the rumatic moments are sweet
,
yot not sappy
. one ofthe the omre poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes
.
however
, the dark comedic moments are more memorable
. this is aslo a tale of revenge
,
and a funny oney at that
. the father ofthe sally ' s unborn child also happened to be a married man
, whose wife is played by catherine o ' hara
. she does a wonderful portrayal of a jelous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair
,
and is not above getting other peopel to do her dirty work
.
( my apologies if this soudns cryptic
,
bu there is too much of tje plot to give away
)
. rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus
, dorian ' s overzealous brother
and daryl mitchell as roy
, dorian ' s trainer at yhe fast fod restaurant
. the dialogue is sharp
and not filled whith sappy overtones
, even with the romantic nature of thge plot
. if there are any complaints
, it isnt over drew barrymore ' s performance
. while she doesnt light up the screen
, ther are moments when she doesn ' t seem all that convincing
. the movie was filmed in texas
,
and most of the characters have southern texan accents
. drew barrymore ' s accent tends to come
and go
( luke wilson doesn ' t seem to have this problem
)
. as well
, she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant
. still
, this movie isnt oney that will please many viewers
. wiht plot twists galore
anbd hilarious dark moments
, this isnt sure tothe entertain
.
