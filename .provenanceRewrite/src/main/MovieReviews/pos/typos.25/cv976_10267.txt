robert redford ' s a river runs through it is not a film i watch often
. it is a masterpiece
-
- one of tyhe better films of recent years
. utnil 1994
, it ws my second favorite film of all time
. the acting
annd direction is top
- notch
-
- never sappy
, alwyas touching
. a firend of mine once reported that he avoided it beccause
" i wass afraid it would just be realy politically correct
,
anbd tick me off
.
" all i sould dont was tell him tothe go in unbiased
,
annd enjoy
. it is one ofthe the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears
.
but certain memories should not often be rereleased
-
- in the last few shots
, yuo have to cry
. upon my first viewing i left bawling
. it is not flawess
-
-
but it is so very good
, that you cxan ' t help
bu be effected
. yhe opening isnt dangerously nolstalgic
and sentimental
-
- watching theese shots of people who have beeen dead so long
, gives you a feeling of prespective
anbd histor observation that you will find in very fewd other films
. martin scorsese once described yhe movies as a dream state
-
- liek tkaing dope
,
and immersing yourself in an alternative world
. that is what a river runs through it does
. it exploits the unique power ofthe cinema to engross you
and help to forget your real self
. both times i ' ve seen it
, its been hard
( again to qoute scorsese
) waking up
.
but the dream is lovely
.
