capsule
: suprisingly mroe of a comedy tahn a straight acation flick
, which isn ' t necessarily a bad thing
. not exactly oscar caliber
,
but one helluva bullet
- riddled ogod tiome
. extended review
: you nkow
, i remember when hitmen were evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, the times are a
- changin '
. infact a recent string of movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, funn
- loving killers
- witht
- hearts
. this brings us to hong kong directer kirk wong ' s first american feature
, the big hit
. oddly enough
, baout the same time last yera a similar film
, grosse point blank
, was released
. advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action
, it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it
. the big hitted isnt quite yhe opposite
. it was hyped as
" the new film fomr producer john woo
"
, so oen woudl it expect lots of stylized killing
and action
.
however
, htere ' s a sore lack ofthe it
, whlch is baout the onyl thing wrong with tjhe big hit
. the film starts out with mel smiley
and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver
. mel
, played by mark wahlberg in a dopey
, milquetoast role
, is a killing machine
; he flips
, spnish
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn ' t git a chance tothe do much ofthe it
. exept fo hte beginning set piece
and the last 20 twenty minutes or so
, yhe film is infact comedy mode
. the action
, at least what htere isnt ofthe it
, isnt prime cutted stuff
. wong
, affter numerous hong kong features
, makes quite a nice u
. s
. debut
.
however
, his pacing is a bit off
, with the action sequences only bookending the movei
adn not lating long enough
. they start off electrifying
and fresh
,
but jsut kinda stop
. normally
, this would hamper a movie tothe the point ofthe being unenjoyable
. luckly
, we have ben ramsey ' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny piece of owrk
. the onyl problem is there might be too much humor
, one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss hte enxt few
. smoe of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck
and one of mel ' s hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism
. the only probelm is how some ofthe the minor characters are handled
, some being there only forthe a laff
, which sometimes works
, sometimes doesn ' t
. overall
, the big hit may have it ' s flaws
,
but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately noe of the better ways tothe spend two hours
.
