eight eyasr after its release
, disney has desided to re
- realease the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days
(
and 17 long nights
) only
. coincidentally
, it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox ' s animated film anastasia was released
. you know disney
, they can ' t deal with the threath ofthe any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie enteratinment pie
, so when someone else whants to make a little money
, htey counter with an old
" masterpiece
" ffrom their vault
and
, you know what
, i whent to see this 1989 cartoon rather than tje brand new one from fox
. let noone one sday disney is losing its monopoly on the market
. they still have hotels on boardwalk
_
and
_ park palce
. belivee it or not

, i saw thte little mermaid for the first time
. it took me a few years tothe get over an aversion tothe this movie that was caused seven years ago
, when i stayed iwth one of my mom ' s friends for a couple weeks
. tehy had a young child who listened to tghe little mermaid soundtrack constantly
and
, over that two week perido
, i heard eveyr song from the movei probably a hundred times
. by the time i got back home
, i promised myself i ' d never see the movie
.
but promises are made to be broken
, especially whn ytou ' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagement
. damn those shrewd disney marketers
annd theri mind games
. the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale
,
bu it ' s disney
- ized
, which means lots ofthe talking animals
and bursting into song
. it also means yhe heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times
. i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells
.
.
. the heroine
, of course
, is ariel
( voice ofthe jodi benson
)
, a 16
- year
- ood mermaid who isnt going through that rebellious phase
. she skips her concert tothe explore a wrecked ship
anbd hang out with a seagull thyat talks like buddy hackett
, who tries to orient her tothe the misterious world ofthe humans
. she ' s also dealing whith feelings she hasn ' t had before
-
- which comes when you get scales in places you didn ' t use tothe ahve them
-
- about a handsome prince
( no disney movie would be complete without one
)
. her father
, king triton ofthe the merpeople
, strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of tghe
" savage
" humans
, infront a condemnation that reads as a nto
- so
- subtle analogy about old
- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating
. what ' s a king tothe do
,
though
? tyhe girl ' s in love
adn even total destruction ofthe her little shrine to the human world doesn ' t deter her
. ariel saves the prince ' s life when a hurricane rises uv
,
and jstu has tothe meet him
. she makes a deal with ursula
, the sea witch
( voice of pat carroll
)
. yuo know she ' s evil because she has a huge potbelly
adn one of the worst asses in cartoon history
. she allso has octopus tentacles for feet
( something those dr
. scholl ' s corn pads will not fix
)
and offers to halp ariel out
. she ' ll make her a human for three dyas if ariel will give up her pretty voice
; ariel has three days to make taht prince kiss her
, or else she becomes a slave to tghe witch forever
.
annd if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple
, she ' ll fall asleep forever
. it ' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
but hte little mermaid ws a revolution in the disney world
, comming after such lackluster efforts as tje black cauldron
annd oliver
and company
. it ranks as one of tje best disney cartoons
, certainly since the ' 50s
. all the elements are htere
-
- memorable songs liek
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss tyhe girl
,
" ctaroon animals liuke sebastian
annd flounder
, an evil villain who still has characterization
annd charm
,
annd a fair ammount of humor that caters to adults as well as children
. the little mermaid is worth a big
- screen ticket inaddition 1997
, so hurry up
, yuo only have five days left
. serving america for mroe than 1
/ 25th of a century
