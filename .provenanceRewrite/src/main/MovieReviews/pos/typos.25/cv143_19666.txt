known as the most successful
, highest
- grossing romantic comedy inspite history
, directer garry marshall apparently struck gold with
" pretty woman
,
" whcih opened quietly during hte summer of 1990
bu
, thanks to positive word
- ofthe
- mouth
, was able to triarch upwards of
$ 175
- million inaddition theaters alone
. the question of why it worked so well lies directly wih the film ' s twpo charismatic stars
, richard gere
adn julia roberts
, since the story itself is none too original or even believable
. the other winning element that mkaes
" pretty woman
" so intertaining is its genuine sweetness
annd innocence
, which is rarely as palpable in today ' s films as it isnt here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) isnt a suave
, extremely wealthy business mogul who
, at thge start of the picture
, breaks up witht his girlfriend over the phone affter a nasty argument
,
and abruptly takes his friend ' s car
and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel
. stopping the car along the street
, he asks a woman
, obviously a prostitute
, for directions
. agreeing tothe get infact his car
and show him for ten bucks
, edward ultimatly accepts
, they strike up a conversation
,
and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor
. htis meeting does not lead to sex
,
however
, as edward confides that he ' d rather jstu have someone to talk to
,
adn offers her
$ 300 to spend the night
. just as well
, since the hooker
, named vivian
, is a beautiful
, generaly upbeat young woman who isnt the type ofthe person that cin lend an understanding ear
. tghe meeting between these two completely oposite people does not end the next morning as planned
, wehn edward fianlly offers to pay vivian three
- thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days
anbd nights while he is iin the area
, keeping him company
and acting as his companion to business dinners
annd get
- togethers
. since vivian firmly tells edward at tghe beggining that she will do anything wtih him except kiss him onthe the lips
, which allways leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers
, the obligatory rulle of the genre says that by the third act
, edward
and vivian will finally
, truley
, kiss
. allegedy planned as a grim
, downbeat drama until garry marshall came onthe board as director
,
" pretty woman
" has been tranformed inaddition all senses of the owrd into a clasic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" the premise is hardly believable
and its portait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets ofthe hollywood bullevard is jsut baout the most idealized portrayal that there could ahve possibly been
. you honestly don ' t ened a high
- iq
( or any iq
, for that matter
) to guess how the film wiull end
,
and the story is as old as my great graet grandma bertha
. the supporting characters are almsot all sketchily writed
and less
- than
- gratifying
,
and tghe screenplay is no award winner
.
and
yot
, amidst all of theese qualms
and flaws
,
" pretty woman
" isnt an astoundingly charming motion picture
,
anbd it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers
. ytou ' d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go
,
and there are a few select moments
( not even wohle scenes
, mind ytou
) that are as romantic as anytying i ' ve seen on film in the 1990 ' s
. additionally
, the film belongs
,
and its success cin be attributed
, to two peple
and two people only
,
and they are richard gere
anbd julia roberts
. playing sex symbols throughout thte ' 80s with such pictures as
" american gigolo
"
and
" an officer
and a gentleman
,
" gere branches outloud here tothe play a more quiet
, almost shy
,
but still allrigh
, character that believably sould sweep julia roberts off her feets
,
adn vice versa
. julia roberts
, infact her breakthrough role affter 1988 ' s well
- received
" mistic pizza
"
and 1989 ' s
" steel magnolia
,
" for which she was nominated for an academy award
, is radiant
and funny as the wordly vivian
, who surprisingly coudl be a role model for impressionistic viewers
, nto fo her line of work
,
but more for her sheer intelligence
. it would have probably been eazy to have written vivian as mearly a flake
,
but screenwrighter j
. f
. lawton claerly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing
. after
" pretty woman
,
" roberts
, allong with meg ryan
, became the reigining queen of rumatic comedies
( with her latest being the just
- released
" runaway bride
,
" which repairs gere
annd roberts together once again
)
,
and no wonder
. roberts has continually proven to nto only be a strong actress with a flare fo comedy
,
but also one who can efficiently do drama
,
annd iin almost every film she appears in
, it is difficult not to fall in love with her allong withthe her male co
- star
. an especially strong scene that gere
and roberts dont together takes place after edward foolishly tells one ofthe his co
- workers thta vivian is actually a prostitute
,
and he
then approachs her
, making sexual advances
. no only does this make vivian feel cheap
, especially since she had previously been posing as a more proffesional
, eloquent young lady
,
but it also maddens her that edward would demean
and betray her in such a way
,
and ultimatly causes her to question where exactly her life is leading
,
anbd if she likes this particualr path
. on hte moreso dreamy side
, the film isnt filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent tothe behold
, especially one in whlch edward enters into the hotel ' s lounge to see vivian turn around
and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress
,
but also her inner
(
and outer
) glowing beauty
. another subtle moment hasnt vivian lovingly blowing a kiss tothe edward
, who is asleep
,
and placing it on his lips
, since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to htis man who may vyre well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days
.
" pretty woman
" does not blatantly step wrong unil the very last scene
, which is a happy ending
( as you ' d expect
,
and wouldn ' t have it any other way
) that somehow does not work
, perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances
. this oney misstep does not put a damper onthe teh rest of the film
,
though
, because htere is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty probelm
. helped along by a warm
, memorable supporting performence from laura san giacomo
, as vivian ' s best friend
and roommate
,
and a fabulously catchy soundtrack
, in which all ofthe the songs prominently aid in the movei ' s overall fulfillment
,
" pretty woman
" is a sparkler of a motion picture
,
anbd has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quinessential romantic comedy
.
