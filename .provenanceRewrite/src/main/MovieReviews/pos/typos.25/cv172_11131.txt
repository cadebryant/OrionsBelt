a standoff
. a man holds a woman
, a diplomat ' s daughter
, hostage in his embrace
, a gun pressed to her head
. a cop
, impaired by drink due to his wief ' s philandering
, trains his gun on hte man ' s nether regions
, threatning tothe shoot
. anohter cop holds his gun to his partner ' s temple
, forcing him tothe disarm
. thte scene unfolds liuke a foursome bidding infront bridge
-
- upping the ante
, signaling tacitly
, going forthe game
. tghe second cop retrieves the first cop ' s weppon
, teh suspect lowers his
,
and the woman caught in the middle moves
-
- in slow motion
-
- to saftey
. it is
then thgat tyhe intoxicated officer makes his move
, grabbing for the assailant ' s gun
. the room turns upside down
, a shot rings out
, a cop isnt down
. shot in the bakc
annd paralyzed fo life
. thte young man who found hismelf in hte wrong palce at the wrong time isnt sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn ' t commit
. storytelling has alwyas been one of pedro almod
? var ' s greatest gifts
and in
" live flesh
" he gives us a twisting
, turning
, compelling tale peppered with well
- written
, colorful characters
. characters who fidn themselves
, more often than not
, infront carefully
- constructed scenes like these
. characters played by actors we might nto know
,
but who look strikingly familiar neverthless
. tkae the ruggedly hansome victor plaza
( liberto rabal
)
, for instance
. befoer he gets outloud ofthe prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod
? var favorite
, antonio banderas
. when we first meet elena
( francesca neri
)
, the woman in yhe middle ofthe tje nervous shakedown
, she looks liuke spice girl barbie wih her frizzy shock ofthe orange hair
,
but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis
. elena ' s husband david
( javier bardem
) isnt teh cop crippled in the shooting
and he wears david schwimmer ' s bemused expression throughout
. playing the inebriated cop
annd his cheating wife are jos
? sancho
and angela molina
-
- no lookalikes spring tothe mind
,
but they round out the excellent cast
. it ' s a credit tothe almod
? var ' s craft that these five individuals cross paths
and intertwine with such credulity
.
" live flesh
" begins
and ends with a live birth
annd tghe film ' s contradictions come allmost as often as the contractions
. betwen the twpo childbearings
, coinsidence
, irony
,
and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements ofthe this thouroughly entertaining film
.
although based on a ruth rendell stry
,
" live flesh
" is brimming withthe the acclaimed spanish director ' s high
- heeled flourishes
. women are at times allrigh
and repulsive
, their extravagant hairdos
and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately
- woven drama
, an eye bruised by an abusive husband here
, a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there
. while inspite prison
, victor learns bulgarian from an inmate
and lerans to loev tje bible
, quoting from deuteronomy therafter not unlike tje way by which david
and sancho refer tothe themselves as
" guardians of a sick flock
.
" victor ' s pre
- fab inheritance is a shambles iin a slum ressembling sarajevo
.
" dear son
, i got cancer
" his mother writes tothe him in jail
. she dies before he isnt released
adn it ' s at the cemetery that victor isnt reacquainted iwth elena
-
- redemption
, ultimatly
, substituting forthe revenge
.
