armageddon
, in itself
, symbolizes everyting tyhat is wrong in modern filmmaking
. stories hve been replaced with special effects
; charcter development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue
; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown uv
. armageddon is as stupid
, as loud
and as shallow as any movie you ' ll see come out tihs summer
, or maybe even any other summer
.
but i loved every freaking minute of it
. believe me
, i ' m just as shocked as you are
. hell
, i don ' t even konw why i whent to see it inthe the first place
. the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be tghe worst film ofthe the year
, or at least iin the running
. i ' m sorry
,
bu
" somebody dial 911
!
!
!
" isn ' t quite the tagging that ' s going to sell a movie
. it isn ' t too wise either to market the film using the movie ' s stupidest lines
(
" beam me uv scotty
"
- yeah
, that sure is great writing
.
.
.
)
. i mean
, let ' s face it
; armagdedon ' s previews rival the truman sohw ' s as bieng some ofthe hte worst of the year
. neither of them even cmo close tothe doing their respective films justice
. of course
, you all knwo the story
. when the earth is threatened withthe total annihilation via an asteroid thge size ofthe texas
, nasa calls in the us ' s top oel drillers
(
!
) to go inot space
(
!
)
adn implant a nuclear device eight
- hundered
and someodd fezent into teh asteroid
(
!
)
. inthe the coarse of all this mayhem
, we are introduced to some interesting
-
and not so interesting
- characters
. belonging to the fromer group is rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
, a horny little womanizing genius who ' s alwyas full ofthe wisecracks
, even when flying inot space at a huge amount of g ' s
. aslo
, there ' s the always cool
- as
- hell billy bob thornton as dan truman
, the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers
. he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13
, only without the intensity
and great lines to deliver
.
then on the flip side of the coin is the tired
, contrived character ofthe harry stamper
( bruce willis
, who does the whole movei employing wtih annoying accent i can ' t qutie place
)
, the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler
and ben affleck as yhe token lovers yuo must have in any summer movie
. basically
, that ' s about it
. as i said
, tihs is hardly a film baout plot
. it ' s another summer blockbuster with plot points thyat are beyond unbelievable
and dialogue
and charactors tath are mostly completely wooden
. case in point
: nasa doesn ' t know that there is even an asteroid on it ' s way until eighteen days befor inpact
- huh
? another exmaple
: at one point in the movie
, two children are playing with toy spoace shuttles infact front of a poster of kennedy
. how pretentious is that
?
?
?
!
!
! want anohter one
? okay
; before the oil drillers blast off into space
, one of them starts singing
" leaving on a jet plane
"
,
and soon
, all the rest join inwhich
. did michael bay attened teh school ofthe sappy filmmaking before he made this picture
?
but naturally
, all this sappiness
, melodrama
and special effects accumulate tothe one bitchin ' time at the movies
.
and don ' t get me wrong
- dispite all of the things i foudn wrong with armagedodn
, i still very much enjoied it
. so even if you don ' t win one of mcdonald ' s free tickets
, it ' s still definitely worth checking out
.
