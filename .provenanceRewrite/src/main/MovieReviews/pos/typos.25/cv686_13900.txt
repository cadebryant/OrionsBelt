" the fighting sullivans
" contains a major plot development in the last ten mintues that eveyr movie guide hasnt seen fit to give away
. there ws no dramatic tension fo me while watching the film
, as i knew exactly what wass going tothe happen
.
adn tyhat ' s the worst thing thyat can happen before viewing a movie
. because of this
, i wiull tread lightly so i don ' t ruin it fo anyone reading this review
,
and it owudl be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after yuo ahve seen it
.
" the fighting sullivans
" revolves aroud a family that consists ofthe a mother
, father
, sister
,
anbd five brothers
. the brothers are very close
, dispite the occasional disagreement
. they are inseperable
,
and never stray from one anyother
. their friendship
and loyalty is teh foundation ofthe this picture
. the first half ofthe the movie follows the brothers as young children
,
and their varous adventures
. when four of them get into a fight with some local boys
, the youngest sullivan
, who is inside a chuch at the time
, comes running out to assist
,
but not befoer properly exiting the chapel
. if i ' m bieng awfully vague baout details
, it ' s because what i have told yuo is essentially the first hour
and a half
. all i can say is go watch this film
, because it isnt a fine portrait of a family that sticks together
, through the good
and the bad
.
and after you see the movei
, you will understand why this review has beeen written tjhe way it has
.
