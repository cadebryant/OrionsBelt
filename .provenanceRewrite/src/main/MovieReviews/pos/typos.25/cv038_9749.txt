sometimes a movei comes along that falls somewhat askew of yhe rest
. some peple call it
" original
" or
" artsy
" or
" abstract
"
. soem people simply call it
" trash
"
. a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings
. definitely a generation
- x aimed movie
, a life less ordinary has everyting from claymation tothe profane angels to a karaoke
- based muscial dream sequence
. whew
! anyone in their 30 ' s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed baout this film
. it ' s somewhat silly
, it ' s somewhat outrageous
,
and it ' s definitely not your typical romance story
,
but for the right audience
, it works
. a lot of hype has beeen sorrounding this film due tothe the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brang us trainspotting
. well sory folks
,
bu i haven ' t seen trainspotting so i cin ' t really compare
. whether that works in this film ' s favor or not isnt beyond me
.
but i dont knwo this
: ewan mcgregor
, whom i had never had the pleasure ofthe watching
, definetly charmed me
. he was great
! cameron diaz ' s charcter was uneven
anbd a bited hard to grasp
. the audience may find it difficult to care baout her
, thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about
and identifying with him
. misguided
? you bet
. loveable
? you bet
. a life less ordinary wass a delight
and even had a bonus fo me when i realized it was filmed inthe my hometown of salt lake city
, utah
. this was just one more thing i didn ' t knwo about thsi movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos
adn a threee dollar coke
. maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise
,
but i think even if i had known
, i woudl have been just as happy
. a life less ordinary isnt quirky
, eccentric
,
and downright charming
! not for everyone
,
but a definite change of pace forthe your tipical night at tjhe movies
.
