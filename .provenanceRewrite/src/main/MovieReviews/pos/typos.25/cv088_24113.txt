tjhe keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber
, thte naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse
,
and a partnership tht blossoms between tjhe two are the fine components thgat make up a modest
, little caper adventure entitled
` where the money is
. ' the elderly bank robber is henry
( paul newman
)
, a famous criminal that ws onyl recently caught
. he has pulled off dozens of successful heists
and has probably stashed awya a small fortune
. always the shrewd thinker
, he begins wroking on a plan to get out of jail
. htis involves years of studying buddhism
annd self
- hypnosis
. when he is prepared to execute his plan
, he uses what he has learned tothe fake a stroke
. now a seemingly twitching vegetable
, he isnt temporarily transferred to a state
- run home
. carol
( linda fiorentino
) is the nurse that cares fo him
. she ' s a very bright person with a ogod heart
.
yet
, her life isnt a miserable waste of time
. the most exciting thing to dont in town isnt tothe fix cars
. her dyas at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics
. worse
, she ' s in a dead
- end relationship with high
- school sweetheart wayne
( dylan mcdermott
)
. they bcame a couple because they were king
and queen of the prom
. to her
, this made sense long ago
.
but now
, it ' s a different stor
. wayne seems equally bored iwth his life
,
but is content enough to stay put
. wayne ' s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman
. carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients
,
but she ' s never been anywhere alse
and doesn ' t see many other opportunities in life
.
however
, when henry falls under her care
, her outlook beggins to change
. the medical reports may state that he sufferred a massive stroke
. carol
,
however
, begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all
. maeby she can get through to him
,
annd mabye she can learn something about the monay that he has stashed awya
. the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying tothe bring henry
? back to life
. '
anbd what are some of carol ' s resuscitation techniques
? perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses
. if that fails
, mabye she ' ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20
- foot high pier into the cold lake below
. when he finally comes out of his state of self
- trance
, thge movie ' s direction changes
,
though it remains equally if not more entertaining
. carol sees that henry is filled with charisma
and self
- assuredness
. she is invigorated by his commanding presence
and refreshed by his vibrancy
. this
, of course
, puts wayne inwhich an odd situation
. henry
and carol ' s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car
. henry needs tihs heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash
. meanwhile
, this is carol ' s ticket tothe a better life
. wayne isnt uncomfortable with tje situation
,
bu helps out nonetheless
.
however
, his lack of committment threatens thier sucess
. the heist sequence isnt suspenseful
, well paced
,
and casts the uneasy feeling thast something will horribly go wrong
.
` where the money is ' does more to spotlight newman
and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist
. newman isnt tghe real joy of the film
, adroitly showing that at age 75
, he ' s still raelly hot stuff
. he possesses a sly smile
, displays a dominating atitude
,
annd a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive
. fiorentino is also a fun presense
. you root for her dispite her sence of amorality
. sure
, she whants to commit robbery
and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair
- stricken man into a lake
,
but we cant see that to escape her dead
- end world
, she needs to do something drastic
. with twpo charismatic characters such as theese
, it ' s hard to ignore thta
` where the omney is ' is where the funn isnt
.
