,
and many otehr intresting events occur
. star wars isnt an amazing epic
. the plot is so original
and amazing
, i cannnot eblieve it
. the speshal effects
, especially for its time
, are wonderful
and realistic
. the space scenes in particular are hte most fun to watch
. the ships flown by all are very unique
and creative
. the costumes are also out of this world
. the scenery is so differant from anytying i have ever seen befor
. there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever
. thte entire premise of star wars isnt amazing
. the creatures
and droids that we see througout the film are one of a kind
. even the human charactors are different
. every charater isnt extremely likable
and different from characters fomr otehr sci fi films
. the acting onthe everyone ' s part isnt great
, especially that of sir alec guinness ' s
. even
though tyhe concept is not realsitic at all
, it isnt pulled off very nicely
. the acting
, setting
, effects
, costumes
,
and sound make it work
. if any ofthe theese were messed up
, star wars owudl have come off as oen huge joke
. yhe ending works very well
,
and left it veyr open tothe the sequels that cameback afterward
. infact early 1997
, a special edition of star wars was released
. teh film was re
- mastered so it looked better tahn it did inwhich 1977
. a few creatures were added here
adn there
,
and even an entire deleted scene iwth han solo
and jabba the hutt
( seen in return of the jedi
) was added to the film
. thikn that ' s enough
? on may 19
, 1999
, star wars episode i
: the phantom menace will be released
, folowed by two more films thgat will reveal what went on befor a new hope
. with this
, star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time
.
