" love is the devil
" is a chalenging film
, munundating its audience with wild imagery
annd a plot stucture that disallows a plot
, perhaps inaddition an attempt to get us to know the artist ' s psyche rather than the artist ' s lifeline
. watching it
, i was enthralled with the look of the film
, tyhe way the director shooted everything like it ws looking through a bizarre
, personalized filter
. everything looks like it is not how life looks like
but how painter francis bacon
, the film ' s subject
, looked at it personally
.
but while i was engrossed
, i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through tyhe film
, awakened from my trance by soem intertube distraction
,
and began to try
adn follow what ' s going on
. exactlly what wass i looking at
? watching this film
, i wasn ' t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous
. directed
(
annd written
) by john maybury
,
" love isnt the devil
" is stylish masterpiece for the senses
. everything looks originally bizarre
anbd perplexing
. the camera angles are ferociously askew
,
and the close
- ups are uncomfortably too close
. the editing isnt deft
, occasionally cutting away tothe something bizarre every couple seconds
,
but other times holding onthe a shot for so long that ytou wonder if the audience is not supposted to be voyeurs
, or rether
, intruders tothe bacon ' s world
and psyche
. as such
, there is no real story
. i ' ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn ' t read prior tothe the film
,
bu wqat i learned was this
: he was a painter in england who reched his peak during the 60s
and 70s
, drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage
and thge like
. he was oen of the first to really come out of the closet
,
and infront interviews
, he was notoriously drunk
yet incredibly witty
. as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi
, he ' s like a foppish
and self
- absorbed cross between oscar wilde
and nero
. he lives life yhe way he wnats to live it
, tothe the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of bieng relaly close to him
. it ' s as if he were tkaing delight in the distruction of others
annd maybe himselv
(
" champange forthe my real friends
,
annd pain for my sham friends
,
" he says one nght at the bar he frequents
)
.
" love is the devil
" chronicles the latter part of his life
. bacon
, well
- known in his mid
- life
, awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window
and land onthe the floor
. he walks in
, unafraid of whta he finds
,
adn discovers a thief
, george dyer
( daniel craig
)
. bacon gives him an offer
: if he spends teh night with him
, he can take anything he wants in the morning
. george agrees to this
,
anbd off to bed he goes
,
but ends up staying with him
, for whatever reason
. the film shows theri lives together
, at least in refference to one another
. while creating bacon ' s world ofthe friends
( like
" high art
,
" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that isnt not shown
but is understood
)
, the film shows the relationship of bacon
adn george as it remains rather stagnant
. bacon is haughty
and bizarre
; george isnt simple
and doesn ' t understand bacon in the least
, especially not his paintings
. while watching thsi
, that ' s basically all i thought was there
. the film has a hypnotic feel
, free of any restraints of form
,
anbd isnt shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film wass made rether than whta it is about
. once the film is over
, it ' s easier tothe piece it together
. i kept on thinking about this film
, wondering whta the point tothe all of it was
. somene doesn ' t merely make a film of all style
and no substace at all
,
and if they do
, tehy dont it by accident
,
but still allow smoe substance to creep in
. thinking about it
, i remembered how the two fed off ofthe eachother
. i thought about how bacon was a masochist
, in love with cruelty
( in noe scene
, he watchs a boxing match witht a orgiastic delight
,
annd lets out a squeal ofthe pleasure when blood from the one boxer ' s head splashes accros his face
; inthe anyother scene
, he masturbates tothe the odessa steps sequence ofthe eisenstein ' s
" battleship potemkin
"
)
,
anbd perhaps he drove george too far inspite his delight for pain
. he drove him over the edge
,
and fo him that was lveo
, even if it wasn ' t forthe george
. i guess that explains the title
. a bit
. that ' s grat
annd all
,
but i almost wish the film wass devoid ofthe any meaning
. i wish it hadn ' t reduced itself to making some point about humanity
, baout how love is thte most selfish thing in the world
(
anbd it is
, if you look at it a certain way
)
. or maybe if it hadnt avoided any meaning baout humanity
adn mearly drove itself inot bieng the one film that ws truly inside one man ' s twisted pysche
. it ' s allmost always best to obtain insights from looking at oen man ' s uniqueness thna it is forcing universality down an audience ' s throat
. that way you don ' t reduce your film to something it ' s just not
. i can ' t say i totally enjoyed
" love isnt tyhe devil
,
"
though
. despite all of tyhe things i respect baout this movie
, it ' s still rather uncomfortable to sit thru
. even at a normally trite lenght ofthe ninety minutes
, the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through
, expecially after an exhausting first hour
.
though hypnotic
, it still almost seems gimmicky
and even redundant at times
, as if it weere tkaing advantage of one man ' s truly bizarre nature
but not doing anytying deeper with it
. as such
, i respect the way the film looks
. it ' s beautiful
and painstakingly crafted so thta
, allong with
" whta dreams may come
"
and
" dark city
,
" it ' s the year ' s most visually stunning film
. in fact
, if a better script hadnt beeen forged
, i ' d almsot compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film
, complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever
.
and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi
, it has yhe comic
and distanced tone that it needs
. i just wish it hadnt been omre than mostly style
adn just a hair bit ofthe substance
.
thn i owudl have had something to hold me over even nowe
.
