and especially the band steel dragon
, to whom he ' s devoted a tribute band inspite which he sings
, gets launched into stardom when tyhe rela gropu git rid of their lead singer
and call on him tothe tkae his place
. critique
: i ' m a sucker for movies like this
. a young man with a humble background
and lofty dreasm
, works hard
, devotes the time
, the energy
and teh patience
,
and ultimately hits it big
- time
. inwhich the case of this film
, our boy loves a certain heavy metal band
and as luck would have it
( yup
, luck always finds its way into these types ofthe equations
,
although generally tied very closely to hard work
)
, they ened a new singer
. his entry
and adaptation to the whole
" rock ' n roll
" lifestyle fills tghe rest of the film
and is really fun to watch
.
although i will preface this by saying that oen thign that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love
( or past love
) ofthe heavy metal music
and the whole scene around it
. metal wass one of my firt loves as a teen
and even
though the genre of music isn ' t that prominent anymore
, i still check out my motley crue
, twisted sister
and anthrax cds eveyr now
and agian
. that ' s not to sday that ytou won ' t like this film if ytou don ' t like the music
,
but the music
and live performances fomr the band
, play a big part inspite yhe movie
,
and i for one
, had a blast watching
and listening tothe it all
.
bu thge even greater draw in this film is hte standout performance given here by mark wahlberg
. wow
, hand this fella some major props
, as he totally becomes this hevy metal geek
/ god
( incidently
, metal god was the film ' s orginial title
,
and a much better one if you ask me
)
. he is tihs movei
and i wass qtuie taken by his character preety much the whole way through
. he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals
and work ethic
, who was willing tothe do anything in order tothe fulfill his dreams
. aniston was also suprizingly good as the girlfriend
(
and the romance angle between them was sweet
)
,
bu she didn ' t pul me in hard enough durig theri emotional scenes
. i wass also impressed by some of the
" real
" musicians who palyed inspite the film
( zakk wylde fomr ozzy osbourne
, jeff pilson from dokken
, stephan jenkins from third eye blind
, blas elias from slaughter
)
,
but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members
. it ' s to note that this film ws based onthe a real
- life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band
and
then went onthe to become their actual singer
( their original singer also admitted to bieng gay
, as in this film
)
. just for the rocord
, i ' m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements
, since most of this stuff hasnt already been covered in some way or anohter inwhich other movies
,
but because it ' s a funn
, uplifting
, well
- paced movei with a solid central showing by wahlberg
annd energetic live performances
. oh yeah
,
and for those who dig the
" heavier
" side ofthe music
, tghe soundtrack also rocks
!
! you see
.
.
. dreams can come true
