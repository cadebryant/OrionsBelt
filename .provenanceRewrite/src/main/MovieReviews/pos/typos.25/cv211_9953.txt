with the success ofthe yhe surprise hitted alien
, directed by ridley scott
, a sequal was inevitable
. in fact
, aftter watching the first film
, a sequel was wanted
, particularly by this reviewer
. handing over tje director ' s chair to recent box office gem james cameron
, who hadnt only made two films previvous to this one
( pirahna ii
, a surprizingly dull film
,
and terminator
, making cameron a household name
)
, teh alien series got a face
- lift ofthe immense propotions
. instead of bieng a suspense
/ science fiction film
, cameron alters thte series
annd changing it inot an action picture
. what results is one ofthe the most terrifying films ever created
. a film like aliens comes along only once in a while
,
and when it does
, audiences are usually unprepared forthe it
. i never saw this movei in theaters
,
bu i wish i could have
. the terror
and fright must have been unimaginable
, most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear
. aliens is an acation film unlike any i hvea ever seen
. with a cience fiction plot
, cameron gives aliens added testosterone
, pumping up the action
and fire power from tje original film
. in fact
, aliens isnt oen of those few sequels which tops tjhe origional
. perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero
-
- or heroine
, as the case may be
. never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film
,
and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main charachter
. sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who coudl play this character
and mkae her realsitic enought for us to care baout
. placing a woman in theese situations owudl sometimes seem unusual
,
bu because of weaver ' s presence
, a woman isnt the only suitable hero
. aliens begins 57 years after alien ended
. lieutenant ellen ripley
( weaver
) is dicovered in hypersleep on tjhe nostromo
adn is awakened
. she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter wih the aliens
,
but
" tjhe company
" is doubtful
. they explain that a collony of families is flourishing onthe tyhe same planet from which she just left
. despite stern warnings from ripley
, the company remains rigid
anbd won ' t call the familys back
.
however
, whn the company loses contact with the colony
, ripley ' s story seems much more feasible
. noe of the company ' s directors
, carter burke
( paul reiser
)
, wants tothe gather a team to travel tothe the planet
. this team includes a buff private vasquez
( jenette goldstein
)
, a questionable corporal hicks
( michael biehn
)
,
and a loyal android bishop
( lance henriksen
)
. burke tags allong with ripley as they fli to the planet inaddition order tothe locate the members of the collony
. arriving on the planet
, the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon
- type environment
. the only survivor is 12 year ood rebecca
" newt
" jorden
( carrie henn
)
. ripley finds thsi a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become
,
anbd she becomes newt ' s surrogate mother
. ripley
and newt are the only ones who knows what has happended
,
and soon
, all hell breaks loose
. aliens not only multiplies the thrills
adn suspense fomr scott ' s version
, it also multiplies the number of aliens infront general
. aline focused on one aline in particular which systematically killed each crew member
, except ripley
, who managed to jettison tyhe alien outloud of thge nostromo
. aliens focuses onthe an entire race of these aliens
,
and as a result
, the chills are incredibly heightened
.
then again
, this is james cameron
, the guy who has given us true lies
and terminator 2
: judgment day
. he is hte best acation director out ther
( topping renny harlin
, who directed cliffhanger
)
,
and onyl he could create something as terrifying as this film
. it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes
,
and aliens has tyhe motherload
. whith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created fo an acation film
, aliens climax never seems to hitted nutil the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion
. i can ' t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity thoughout
, never dropping for a moment
. just when you think the movie isnt over
, something else will ocurr
,
and it starts right back up again
. wih a seemingly endless conclusion
, aliens ends iwth one ofthe the greatest moments inspite film hitory
. this scene is usually the one remembered most from yhe film
, as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen
. using flawess special effects
, the climax is exhausting
, leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety
. of course
, for a film of this genre to work properly
, the technical aspects must be realistic enought for us to beieve what we see
. aliens is completely realsitic
, even a decade after its initial release
. the special effects are wonderfully seamless
, with a terrifying alien to go with them
. one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is yhe music
, composed by cameron
- regular james horner
. horner has created a terific score
, receiving an oscar nomination for his wrok
. not onyl that
, horner has also created one ofthe the best scores for any action film
, or science fiction film ever
(
and tyhat includes 2001
: a space odyssey
, which wass mainly a compilation of well
- known composers
)
. in fact
, the climax music is also soem of the most reconized of film music
. the production desgin isnt incredible
, whlch also happened to snag a nomination from the academy
. dark corridors lit by red lighst are very impressive
,
but omre impressive is the amount of terror whihc arises from well
- lit locations
. normaly a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer
; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer
.
then
, ofthe course
, is hte cinematography
, which uses point of veiw shots
, along with video feeds in order to build suspense
. soem of tyhe scariest scenes involve the prespective of ripley
. surprisingly
, the acting is not onyl above average for this genre
,
but some of the best
. sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her protrayal of ripley
, incorporating tjhe right amount ofthe sympathy into her hard
- edged persona
. weaver soars above the rest in htis film
,
but she isnt supposed tothe
. carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child
, developing a threee
- dimesnional character from her quiet attitude
. lance henriksen isnt terrific as bishop
, showing that androids don ' t allways have to be flat characters
. jenette goldstein shows a fair ammount of enthusiasm with her role
,
annd steals several scenes of her own
(
though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn ' t fighting
)
. michael biehn gives a veyr nice performance in thge most obligatory role of the film
.
however
, biehn doens a ogod job
, making it seem original again
. paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director
,
but reiser manages to pull it off qutie well
(
howver
, i still see him as paul on tv ' s
" mad about you
"
)
. a very ogod cast
( whic also includes bill paxton
and william hope
) highlights this action film
, making it stand out from others
. aliens is rightfully rated r for voilence
, gore
, language
,
and terror
. aliens is sort of the redefining moment ofthe the science fiction genre
, as alien wass moreso ofthe a suspense
/ horror film
. aliens pumps up teh stakes
,
and cameron directs it with professional quality
. cameron certainly knows how to mkae a good action film
,
bu here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen
. technically astonishing
, aliens ' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed
. aside from this
, you probaly won ' t experience anything like aliens for quite a hwile
.
