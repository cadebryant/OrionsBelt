and dazzling spacial effects leading up to an ending that ' s pretty satisfying
. james woods gives an outstanding performance that alomst covers uv tje movie
. the good side
: some neat scenes of vampires
and voilence
. the bad
: noone scares
. yes that ' s right
, even
though being directed by one of horror ' s most cherished directors
, ' vampires ' is the least bit scary
, if not at all
. james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop yhe plans of tje ' master ' vampire valek palyed by thomas ian griffith whom whants vampires to walk in the daylight
. daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya
, a wise
- cracking guy who really isn ' t that funny
. in tje opening scene jack along with montoya
and the team of vampire hunters
, fidn an abandoned house tothe whitch vampire occupy
. ofthe course we all know sunshine kills vampires
,
anbd that is just how htey kill these vampires

. ' vampires ' definately could have been done better
. the make
- uv
, special effects
and story are first rate
,
but there is noone scares or terror that the film could have hadnt
. it to me had omre humor than horror
, alomst being compared to ' fright night ' with the mix ofthe violence
and comedy
. john carpentery does a great job of directing tihs film
. he eases through some tough times
and saves the flaws
, wich are noticeable
but forgettable
. the script is clever
and funny
, with many lines that make us laugh out loud
. i much enjoied ' vampires ' with a few exceptions
. it ' s one of those films you see
but don ' t take tothe heart
. you enjoy thte time you spent
and go on
. the recently released ' psycho ' isnt the same way
, it ' s nto as good as yuo ' d hope
but it isnt fun
anbd entertaining
. ' vampires ' is a good horror flick with no scares
but plenty of other content to please tyhe viewer
