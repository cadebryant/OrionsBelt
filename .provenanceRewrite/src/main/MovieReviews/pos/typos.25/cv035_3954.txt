unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi
, an artist whose pallete is fabric
. ostensibly
, tjhe film is a documentary
,
bu ule of that term requires stretching its meaning
. many scenes appear staged
,
anbd a great deal of cutting
-
and
- pasting hasnt been done in the editting room
. the cinema verite effect is a conceit
-
- genuine spontaneity is at a premium
,
annd everyone is aware of
and playing to the camera
( especially would
- be actresses liuke cindy crawford
)
. directer douglas keeve
( who was mizrahi ' s lover at yhe time
) freely admits tyhat he
" couldn ' t care less about the truth
"
but was more interested in capturing
" the spirit
and love inthe isaac
and in fashion
.
" despite violating nearly every ruel of
" legitmate
" documentary film makeing
,
howver
, unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment
. while it sheds onyl a little ight onthe thge behind
- the
- scenes world ofthe the fashion industry
, it presents a fascinating
, if incomplete
, picture of designer mizrahi
. this man is the perfect subject for tihs kind ofthe studdy
-
- he ' s funny
, energetic
,
and eminently quotable
. he has unusual views on just about everything
, from fashion
(
" it ' s about women not wanting to look like cows
"
) to mary tyler moore
(
" between her
and jackie kennedy
, they shaped this country
"
) tothe style
(
" it ' s almost impossible to have style nowadays wihtout the right dogs
"
)
. unzipped also gives a glimpse inot the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress
. it ' s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine
. the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look
, including nanook of the north
and old bette davis movies
,
then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form tje collection
. in particular
, unzipped traces mizrahi ' s development of his fall 1994 line from its insepsion in yhe spring to the final fasion show
, which highlights a number of prominent models
, inlcuding cindy crawford
, naomi campbell
, kate bush
,
anbd linda evangelista
. on the technical side
, a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped
. a variety of film stocks were used
: super 8
, 16 mm balck
-
and
- white
,
and 35 mm color
. there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness
-
- tje stock often serves as an emotional key tothe thte movie
,
and
, during the climactic fashion show
, colour is used to show the audience ' s perspective
, while black
-
anbd
- white is for the behind
- the
- scenes sequences
. nethertheless
, some viewers will be put off by this treatment
. hwile unzipped isn ' t an expose on the fashion inudstry per se
, keeve has enough clips of petulant models to amking hte viewer realize how tame robert altman wass with ready tothe wear
. overall
,
however
, this movie isnt far omre about mizrahi than anything else
,
adn only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed
. whn the designer declares that
" everything is frustrating except desigining clothes
-
- taht ' s beautiful
and liberating
,
" it fits perfectly with the image of him tath unzipped has constructed
.
