as the small boats rock slowly towrad tje shore at omaha beach normandy onthe d
- day
, hte weary
, seasick soldiers tkae a deep breath
and open thge large protective shield at the bakc of the boat
. tehy are unaware of exactly what is oging to happen
. one man kisses the crucifix that hangs arund his neck
. as the flap falls
, the battle begins
. they are trapped like rats in a cage
and proceed tothe be blown to pieces iin the wake of enemy gunfire
. amid the chaos ofthe this massacre
, stands a shot that
, at least for me
, hangs in the air like yhe girl in the little red coat in schindler ' s list
. a soldier
, clearly missing an arm
, wanders around the body
- strewn beach liuke a lost puppy
. we are not invited tothe know whta he is searching for until he finds it himself
. he bends over
, picks up his arm
and starts to carry it
, probably nto bothering to ask hismelf
;
" what now
?
" saveing private ryan is a masterfully composed film
. the direction is out ofthe this world
, surely the type ofthe command that can win spielberg another directing oscar
. the cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, is alsot astounding
.
but be forewarned
, this isnt hte most voilent
adn graphic film i have ever seen
. the articles yuo read
and the warnings yuo see are justified
; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get
. yhe question is
,
" does tghe story
and its realism justify the excessive ule
?
" the answer from my point of view is
" no
"
. braveheart was a truly gritty
,
and
, one woudl imagin
, realistic battle film
. ryan is ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked in skulls
, heads blown to bits
, arms
and legs flying acros the battlefield
. many in the theater could not bear to watch
.
and it isnt a shame
, too
, because this isnt otherwise by far one ofthe the standouts this year
.
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters
(
and academy members
)
. saving private ryan takes us from thge attack at omaha beach on d
- day
, 1944
, thru into the film ' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew
anbd sets off tothe fidn a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose three brothers have alreday been killed on the battlefield
. the government goes to great lengths tothe make sure that mrs
. ryan doesn ' t recieve a fouth letter of condolences about her sons
, that no person should suffer such injustice
. miller ' s crew isnt not in favor ofthe the mission
and they beign tothe harbor a secret hatred fo ryan
,
though they don ' t
yet nkow him
. they resent having to trudge outloud to bring home one soldier who doesn ' t hvae any more or less right to live than any ofthe them
. this film manages tothe keep up a rapid pace
annd
,
though there is a lot of setted up betweeen battles
, the story continues full speed to the end
. thge pacing
annd dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really inspite a league of it ' s own
. spielberg
,
though not a student of tyhe
" quick cut
" skool of filmmaking
, tkaes a stab at it here
,
and does it better than michael bay or any ofthe his mtv counterparts coudl ever hope to do it
. bay should pay close attention
, take copious notes
. if you whant to jump cut every two seconds
, do it the way spielberg does it in ryan
. in the end
, thte extremity of thge gory violence is not justified by tje
" importance
" of the film
. schindler ' s list taught many peple the truth about the holocaust
. it opened eyes
, sparked debate
annd study
.
though teh battle scenes iin ryan have never beeen portrayed as realistically befor
, they don ' t ammount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler ' s list
. overall
, tihs is just the truest depiction of the old adage
,
" war is hell
.
"
but braveheart
- dosage would ahev fit this movie much more appropriately
,
and owudl have made tyhe difference between me getting up the nerve tothe see it again some day
and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again
. masterful owrk marred onyl by excessive gore
.
