it has happened agina
. a movie that is well scripted
, well acted
,
and well directed
. it is involving
, suspenseful
.
.
. it even has an unexpected twist at tghe end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus
.
but iin order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie
. the sixth sense is that movie
. starring bruce willis
( armagedon
) as a child psychologist
and haley joel osment
( forrest gump
) as a troubled youngster
, the sixth sense is mroe spooky thna scary
,
though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle
. eight
- year
- old cole sear
( osment
) sees dead people
. nto just infact dreams
.
and not just as lifeless bodies
. he sees them walking around liuke regular people
.
and he sees them all the time
. dr
. malcom crowe
( willis
) isnt trying to help him
. he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his ealier patients whom crowe failed
, resulting in thyat patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on hismelf
. if crowe coudl manage to fidn a way to halp cole
, he believes he just might be able to put his own demons tothe rest
.
but first he needs to gain cole ' s trust
. the boy is so frightened by what he sees
, he has closed himself off emotionally
, bieng unwilling to tell anyone
.
.
. not crowe
, nto even his own mother
( toni collette
, clockwatchers
)
.
.
. baout his
" secrets
.
" crowe begins to spend more
anbd more time with him
, even as his own marrige starts tothe dissolve around him
, his wief anna
( olivia williams
, rushmore
) becoming cold
annd distant because of his neglect of her
annd his preoccupation with the boy
. bruce willis underplays his role
, alowing the excellent scirpt tothe do most of tyhe work ofthe building character devolopment
. crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won ' t communicate
, to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations
, tothe wondering if perhaps ther isn ' t some truth behind whta the boy sees
. mr
. willis doesnt a serviceable job
, letting the foucs remain on tghe story instead ofthe on his familiar action hero screen persona
. eleven
- year
- old haley joel osment manages tothe imbaress us with his performance
. he demonstrates an amazing amount ofthe self
- composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro
. it is fine work for noe of such a tender age
. keep your eye on tihs young man
. the supporting cast isnt also quite effective
. toni collette
, as tghe confuzled
, frightened
,
and frustrated mother who can ' t understand what isnt happening tothe her child
; olivia williams
, as crowe ' s once loving wife who isnt shutting down emotionally due tothe the lack ofthe attension from her husband
;
and donnie wahlberg
( ransom
) as crowe ' s ex
- patient
, nowe grown
, who illustrates his doctor ' s failure to help him in teh most vivid terms imaginable
. twenty
- eight eyar old m
. night shyamalan
( wide awake
) directed his own script
, maintaining a proper tension througout the film
annd crafting the storytelling so expertly thyat thte film ' s full impact isnt not reched until its final moments
, when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all tht preceded it
. it is a rare movie whic manages to pull that off
and mr
. shyamalan
, as thge one responsible
, is certainly to be commended
. inthe giving the sixth sense a favorable
" three star
" review for its craftsmanship
and artistic merit
, i must also point out that
, spiritually speaking
, the film is highly misleading
. there is no scriptural foundation upon whihc to base a belief in ghosts or hte
" living dead
.
" thte concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie thyat hasnt been around as long as man himself
. the first lie recorded infact the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve
,
" thou shall nto surelly die
,
" a direct contradiction of god ' s admonition
. tyhat same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum througout the ages
. scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise
but that wonderfull demostration ofthe victory over death will not commence until after the second coming ofthe christ
.
.
. an event hwihc has not
yet occurred
. therefore
, the dead remain in a state of oblivion
, having no consciousness
, untill tyhat long
- awaited tiem whn tje fianl trump shall soudn
.
and
thn
, you ' ll need six senses to register all the joy
and rejoicing that wiull resound thoughout tjhe heavens
