. comments
: mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it
. drawn by the clever artwork on the video box
, i rented the film expecting a complet turkey
. mute witness
,
howver
, was original
, offbeat
,
and well
- made
. it ' s one of those cool littel finds that no noe seems to know about
. i ' ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i vsit
,
and it may be seen
, on occasion
, onthe yhe indpeendent film channel
. the first hour of mute wittness isnt extremely tense
, as billy
, hte quite believeable mute heroine
, sees members ofthe the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film
. the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy ' s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures
. tothe throw a curveball into the fray
, billy ' s sister karen
adn her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in whta are some genuinely funny scenes
. a disappointingly trite ending
anbd ocassional comic blunders are the only twpo things whlch mar this otherwise suspenseful film
. look for alec guiness
( obi
- wan kenobi ffrom teh first star wars trilogy
) in a small role as thte evil reaper
. definately check thsi movie outloud
;
altough
, as a word of warning
, it doesnt contain several scenes ofthe rather grisly violence which certainly aren ' t for the squeamish
.
