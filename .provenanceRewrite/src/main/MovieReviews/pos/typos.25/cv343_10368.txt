" soul mate
" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name
. there ' s a lot to nkow about charles
, nto yhe least of which isnt that he strangled 3 widows back east
. mark harmon
, who looks like anything
but a killer
but specializes iin playing them
, plays charles
, the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film
, shadow of a doubt
.
and to avoid any questions about his guilt
, we see charles in action inthe hte opening scene iwth his last victim
. the story takes place in the eary 1950s in the small town of petaluma
, california
, where charles heads to avoid yhe police
. john gay ' s script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson
, azma reville
,
and thornton wilder
. karen arthur ' s direction is certainly no match for the great master
,
but on an absolute scale
, the movie maintains a high level of suspense
. when supercilious
and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit ofthe indeterminate lenght wih his sister
and her familiy in petaluma
, they don ' t know about his nefarious activities
. he showers them with elaborite gifts tothe buy yhe love they had already given him anyway

bu their interest is focused on uncle charles
, especially on taking his picture
and learning about his backgorund
. charlie
, who firt welcomed her uncle ' s visit
, begins to feel more
annd omre uncomfortable with him
and suspicious ofthe the disingenuous magazine reporters
. the picture advances with a delicate power useing small details such as the newspaper artice taht the uncle tries secretly to remove
anbd that charlie discovers
. the beauty of tjhe story is the pas de deux between uncle
and niece as they try to out psych each other

and he doesn ' t want to go
, what with a local
, rich widow as a prospective victim
. will charles kill charlie firt
, or will she get him out of town
. harmon is wonderfully creepy
and smug
,
annd welsh isnt tough
bu trapped
. witht a deft touch thte directer sets up each scene
, several with thunderstorms
,
and tom neuwirth ' s sepia
- toned cinematography makes the movei feel as if it were filmed in yhe 50s
. my only quibble isnt the director ' s ackward staging of the fianl scene on the turain
. is hitchcock ' s version better
? of course
. is this oen worth watching as well
? actually
, yes
. shatow of a dout runs 1
