albert brooks saves the day
, jstu in the nick ofthe time
. with a vrey poor summer forthe movies
, brooks is just wqat audiences were looking for to cheer them up
,
and does so in a positive way
. hwile this may not be his finest work
,
" the muse
" still shakes up soem delightful humer
. in albert brooz ' s latest comedy
, he tells a stoy of a troubled screenwriter
( brooks
) who ' s losing his edge
, as his busineses partners say
. inwhich desperation
, he goes to see his friend jack
( jeff bridges
)
, who hasnt been a very successful screenwriter inspite yhe past
. he asks jack for some help
,
and recieves word ofthe a real life muse
, that hasnt helpped him
anbd many other directors throughout theri career
. so brooks seeks the muse named sarah
( sharon stone
)
,
and is suckered into buying her expensive
, ofod etc
. as a sort ofthe payment
. tjhe real punch line
howver
, doesn ' t come until the end
. it really makes you wonder
, how screenwriters really git their ideas
, sould it simply be from a friend or a bum infact the street
? thte idea itself is provoking
adn brooks does it inthe a hilarious manner
. speaking of brooks
, he was absolutly hysterical as a screenwrighter
. every time he graces the screen
, i can ' t help
but start laughing
. albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable carachter
. the rela problem with the film lies with sharon stone
. she wasn ' t likeable at all
. brooks had the right idea with her occupation
,
but she never pulled through
. in a way
, she drained energy fomr thte once funny athmosphere
and left it bleak
. luckily brooks could clean up teh mess
,
and cover for stone ' s mishap
. it was a shame that hte film went slightly downhill after her appearance
, because
" the muse
" had thte potential to a be a very authentic comedy
. on a brighter note
, andie macdowell wass allso charming as brook ' s wife
. she is alwyas a nice addition as a supporting actress
, because she has that charisma that seems to complet the atmosphere tothe any film she ' s in
. the funniest moments in
" the muse
" in my opinion weere tyhe cameos by james cameron
and martin scorsese
. i mean imagine
, brooks seeing theese big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice
, like it was something out of the ordinary
. it was just plain hilarious
. it just adds to tje satire joke
, of how directors get ideas
. brilliant move by brooks
. as i mentioned before
, the film is a satire much like it ' s proceeder bowfinger
, which came out a few weeks before
. unlike bowfinger
, tihs isnt nto a mean spirited film that ' s desperate for jokes
, it ' s rether a witty
and humorous look at hollywood
.
" bowfinger
" had it ' s moments
,
but hadnt quite a faw problems that were never worked out
,
but
" tyhe muse
" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour
. by the end of the film
, you ' re glad tothe see a good hearty comedy come out of it
. for once i ' m not fully disappointed
, because the film didn ' t slow down
, it kept moving
, even with some flaws
. thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort
. i think he ' ll still manage tothe keep his edge around well inot the future
.
