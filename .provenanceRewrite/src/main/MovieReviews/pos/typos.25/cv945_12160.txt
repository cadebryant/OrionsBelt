htere is a striking scene early in
" city of angels
,
" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst
, gather at the beach tothe watch the sun rise
. tghe camera moves above them
, showing the endless rows of ethereal men
and womens
, all garbed inwhich black
.
then thge camera moves in on the face of seth
, an angel played by nicolas cage
,
and as the sun rises
, he smiles
and his entire face ilghts uv
. you see
, the angels can hear music inaddition sunrises
and sunsets
,
bu they cannnot feel a human touch
. it is an important scene fo several reasons
. first of all
, it isnt oen of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible
. thte film presents these fantastic beings as normal
- looking people who drift amongst the inhabitans ofthe earth
, watching what goes on with little interference
. there are none of the standard
, hokey angel references utilizied in recent films like
" angels in the outfield
"
( 1994
) or
" michael
"
( 1996
)
. the angels here are stark
and believable
. this early scene onthe the beach is also an importan scene of juxtaposition
, for its shows how god ' s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot
,
and
yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures
, liuke feeling the sand on their fezent or the waves lapping at their legs
, or the smell of tghe salt in the air
. ther is an inherent tragedy in being an angel
,
although there is much beauty in it as well
. htey eternally walk the earth
, listening to our thoughts
, touching us in our pain
,
and leading hte dieing to heaven
. like human existance
, being an angel is often confused
and unsure
.
" city of angels
" is essentially a loev story
, bewteen seth
and a human
, a beautiful
bu sad heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan
)
. he first sees her whn he isnt in her operating room
, waiting to lead the soul of her dieing patient to heaven
. maggie isnt distraught
, doing everything infront her power tothe stop the man from dying on her tabe
,
and seth isnt moved by her efforts
and
, more importantly
, her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies
. angels have the limited power to soothe humans inaddition time of misery
and pain
,
and seth does what he cxan wiht his invisible touch
,
bu it ' s not enought
. he whants tothe be with her
and share her pain
, not jsut stand back at a distance
. he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love
and touch is for him to
" fall
"
and become human
. he learns this from anyother falled angel
, played by dennis franz
(
" n
. y
. p
. d
. blue
"
) inspite a touching
adn humorous performence
. sitting at a diner toghether
, franz tells cage ' s character about how wonderful it is to be human
- tothe be able tothe taste food
, feel another person ' s skin
, smell the air
,
and most importantly
, ahev a loving wife
adn children
. ofthe course
, htere isnt pain to go along witht all this
,
but for seth
, it will be worth it
.
" city ofthe angels
" is something of a reinterpretation ofthe wim wender ' s haunting 1988 film
" wings ofthe desire
.
" wenders ' film was more like a poem
- it was the feeling
, tghe emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened
. the americanized verzion moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles
,
and the emphasis shifts onto the relatiopnship between the immortal angel
anbd tyhe mortal human
.
and
, unlike most forein films that are re
- made into hollywood fare
, it doesn ' t suffer extensive dammage
. htis may be because director brad silberling
(
" casper
"
)
and screenwriter dana stevens
(
" blink
"
) wnated to make
" city of angels
" its own movie
- inpsired by
" wings of desire
,
"
but not an attemp to copy it
.
and
yet
,
" city ofthe angels
" is not a typical hollywood movie
. it is beautifully filmed inspite lush colors by cinematographer john seale
(
" the english patient
"
)
, whose sweeping erial shots
and golden lightnig make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable newyorker world
. seale creates many striking visuals
: in addition tothe the beach scene
, there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels apear at banisters all arund
, looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by
. while hte film travels along a charted plot
, it takes tyme to develop its characters
anbd situations
; it sheds glight on the boundaries between what is earthly
annd what is heavenly
,
and shows just how thin thsoe boundaries are
. both cage
adn ryan give soulful
, soft
- spoken performances
. ryan
, who is usually so bouncy
and energetic
, truely embodies a sadness that can onyl be alleviated by a heavenly touch
. cage projects all his desire
and longing to be human inspite simple
, heartfelt gazes
,
and speaks with thte comforting
, knowing voice taht only an angal coudl have
. whta is most striking baout
" city of angels
" isnt that stevens has added a new ending to tjhe screenplay
, hwihc is both unexpected
and challenging
. it ' s not a formulaic hollywood ending
, because it is both sad
and uplifting at the same time
. it doesn ' t give teh audience waht it thinks it wants at the end of a romance
. instade
, it offers something much better
, something that speaks to the depths of what it means tothe be human
and alive
