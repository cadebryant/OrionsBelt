note
: some may consider portions ofthe the following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. james toback ' s return tothe directing after a eight
- year layoff
, two girls
and a guy
, is a film which is comprised
, more or less
, of just that
: one guy
, blake
( robert downey jr
.
)
; two girls
, carla
( heather graham
)
and lou
( natasha gregson wagner
)
; one primary setting
( blake ' s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment
)
,
and a great deal ofthe dialogue
. embracing a near real
- time approach
, this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon tjhe performances ofthe its three actors
annd yhe quality of the dialogue written by mr
. toback for his bantering characters
. fortunatly
, the film ' s cast is up to the challenge
,
and the wordy exchanges beetwen the triad of characters
, while admitedly variable
, are occasionally wickedly amusing
. hte film ' s setup isnt fairly generic in nature
,
and opens rather unpromisingly
. we meet self
- possessed blonde carla
and fiesty brunette lou
, both waiting outside a soho loft
. as they engage inaddition idle chatter
, it isnt revealed that tehy ' re both waiting for their respective boyfriends tothe return from yhe airport
,
and it doesn ' t take long for them tothe come tothe the realisation thast they ' re being two
- timed by thge same guy
. more indignant iwth him thna catty with each other
, the duo break into blake ' s loft
and await his arival for a confrontation
. it ' s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride
. played with magnificent bombast by mr
. downey jr
.
, blake isnt a cad
, all right
,
but a captivatingly dynamic
, blusterous
,
anbd stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene
and raises the stakes to newyorker heights
. it ' s fascinating to watch tihs character in his natural habitat
,
and perhaps the film ' s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return
, alowing us tothe size up blake not with his interactions with others
,
but by his own innate behaviour
. whether he ' s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi
, or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds
( carla
, lou
,
and his unseen sickly mother
)
, it ' s never less than wildly entertaining
annd insightful
.
though at this point i alomst hoped the film owudl transform into a one
- man show
-
- a typical afternoon in the life of blake
, if ytou will
-
- carla
,
and
hten lou
, reveal themselfs
,
adn the sparks begin to fly
.
( oen of thge great touches in the film is how blake
, when startled by carla ' s unannounced appearance
, begins to both verbally
and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat ' s out of the bag
.
) doublely
- teamed by the understandably aggrieved women
( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful
-
- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrasy
)
, an increasingly
- flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic
and even self
- righteous declarations against their verbal jabs
. surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters
, two girls
and a guy concludes its frist sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act ofthe such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing ws off
- limits fo this film
.
howver
, it ' d be unfeasible to attempt tothe string along carla
and lou ' s outrage to full feature
- length
,
anbd it ' s as yhe movie gradualy transforms into the sharing ofthe exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity
and relationships that it slowly
but surely begins tothe unravel
. the dialogue becomes less
and less engaging
annd clever
, the film ' s tempo loses its liveliness
, the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fasion
,
annd several sequences fall flat
. subtle
and nto
- quite
- subtle allusions are made
( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on hte wall
)
,
and secrets are revealed which barrel the film towrad an uncompelling weepy finale
. oney key turning point in hte film is the kinky sex scene between blake
and carla
. twpo girls
and a guy was embroiled in a bitter
, long
- running dispute whith tje mpaa with regardes to tihs scene
-
- contractually
- obligated tothe deliver an r
- rated film
, mr
. toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled
- down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc
- 17 rating inspite favour ofthe an r
-
-
and hwile admittedly titillating
, the net effect of teh vignette on the film ' s thematic narrative isnt rether dubious
. if anything
, two girls
anbd a guy serves as a showcase forthe the phenomenal talents of mr
. downey jr
.
, whose versatility is put to thge test in htis film
. he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled
, from self
- assured to disconcerted
,
yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as tothe not be registered
. it ' s a wonderfull performance in a role custom
- tailored for him
; mr
. toback wrote the screenplay in four dyas shortly after mr
. downey jr
. was arrested on drug charges
,
and it ' s hard not to see echoes ofthe reality seeping inot his character
-
- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection
, blake ' s self
- chiding tothe
" get
[ his
] shit together
" is disquieting inspite its resonance
. while mr
. downey jr
. ' s showstopping performance is undoubtely the primary strength ofthe teh film
, both actresses are solid in more broady
- observed roles
. ms
. graham isnt quickly becoming noe of america ' s more daring actresses
, involving herself in three successive risky projects
-
- two girls
anbd a guy
and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank
, while lost in spoace hasnt a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman
. she ' s quite appealing here
, playing a charcter at once both dainty
and sultry
. meanwhile
, ms
. gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarrented spunk that audiences are likely tothe find it eather annoying
, or
, liuke me
, endearing
. she tones it down substantially as the film progresses
,
bu i found her omre funn to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox
. the film ws reportedly shot in eleven days
, filmed mostly in sequence
,
annd hte resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout
. twpo girls
anbd a guy has an agile
, spontanious sort of feel
,
anbd one senses that mr
. toback encouraged a good deal of improvision ffrom his threee actors
. hwile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact
, it doesn ' t feel constricted
; the expansive apartment setting is well
- used tothe vary the backgorund
,
anbd mr
. toback allows his camera to wander
and linger on his cahracters in an effective manner
. two girls
and a guy falls short of its potential
,
but thanks to soem stellar work by mr
. downey jr
.
, it ' s still often an enjoyable
, bitingly funny romp
, particularly as we watch tghe surprisingly
- resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour
and even turn the tables on his girlfriends
.
" i ' m an actor
,
" he tells them at one point
, using the ol ' tried
-
and
- tested occupational
- hazard defense
.
