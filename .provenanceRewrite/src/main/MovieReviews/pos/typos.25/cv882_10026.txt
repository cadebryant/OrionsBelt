airplane
! is concidered among many to be the epitome ofthe satire film
- making
. after all
, it ' s brang to us by one of the best known satire writing
/ directing teams
. even if most people don ' t recognize the names behind the films
, they are bound to recognize the titles
: airplane
!
, top secrect
, thte naked gun
,
and hot shots tothe name a faw
. but
although the zucker
/ abrahams
/ zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977
, airplane
! remeniss the true cornerstone of their owrk
,
and their directorial debuts
. in tghe seventies
, disaster films seemed to be at an all time high
. films like earthquake
, thte towering inferno
,
and the poseidon adventure were big hits
. ther wass also a sories baout the disasters that can arise wehn traveling by plane
- a sories that spanned the entire decade
.
and so
, in 1980
, we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film
. tihs time the diaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing inot the ocean
.
.
. it had to dont with bad fish
. airplane
! is yhe sotry of ted striker
( robert hays
)
- an ex
- fighter
- pilot who has never gotten over hte fact that a decision he had to amking infront tjhe midst of war led tothe the death of six
, er
, seven comrades
. unable to stop living in the past
, ted ' s world fell apart
. he spent his time moving from city tothe city without ever having a stable job
,
anbd eventually
, as we begin this film
, isnt getting dumped by his lover
, flight attendant elaine dickinson
( julie hagerty
)
. in a desperate attempt not to loose her
, ted buys a ticket fo the same flight elaine is working
. unfortunately
, she is unsympathetic
annd even criticizes ted fo following her
, whlch leaves him wallowing inspite self
- pity
. in the midst of it all
, something happens
. someone gets sick
.
then another
.
then anohter
. soon
, the wohle plane is full of deathly
- ill chicago
- bound people
.
.
.
and whn the pilots get sick
( palyed by peter graves
, kareem abdul
- jabbar
,
and frank ashmore
)
, who iwll save hte day
?
( gee
, i wonder
) of course the main draw here is the non
- stop
" whiz
- bang
" comedy
, witht a hefty dose ofthe both visual
annd spoken gags
.
although i had seen this movei a few times before
, i was still laughing thru the entire thing
. tghe most fun character by far is the doctor
, played by leslie nielsen
. he ' s a dry
, subtle
, sterotypically straight
- faced doctor that ends up saying soem ofthe tje funniest lines of tyhe film
. in a film liuke this
, you ' re nto really expecting an elaborate prodcution
, so one can ' t complain about the amateurish quality
. waht you cxan complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny
, plyed by stephen stucker
. this character is pointless
, nauseating
,
and very unfunny
. i don ' t know why he was put in ther
,
and i don ' t think anybody will find a good excuse
.
and when the film nears an end
, it slows down quite a bit
, almost getting old
. you gotta give it to a movei that only runs 88 mintues
and can feel two hours long
. aside from that
, airplane
! is realyl a top
- notch spoof that iwll likely forever be known as a spoof classic
. it would be a good choice tothe pop in yhe vcr whith a group of friends
, especially if tehy haven ' t seen it
.
and if htey ask what the plot is
, just tell ' em
" it ' s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film
,
but that ' s not important right now
.
" if you ' ve seen the film
, ytou ' ll understand
