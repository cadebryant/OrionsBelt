roman emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
) choosed his trusted general maximus
( russell crowe
) as his successor
.
however the emperor ' s evil son commodus
( joaquin pheonix
) murders his father before the annoncement can be made
,
and maximus
( as well as his family
) is sentenced to be executed
. maximus is able to escape his executioners
,
but is later captured
and sold as a slave to proximo
( oliver reed
)
. proximo is looking forthe gladiators tothe earn hismelf money
( he being a former gladiator himselv
)
,
and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a poverful gladiator
. when emperor commodus announces thta new games will be held in the colisseum
, proximo takes his gladiators htere to do battle
. maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge onthe commodus
. gladiator beigns with a grat battle sequence beetwen the roman army
and germania
,
annd actualyl is able to manetain interest during the now recquired
" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence
" style of moviemaking
. thte onyl downfall ofthe the opening sequence is the editing stlye used
.
.
. it ' s choppy slow
- motion which is unsettling
and distracting
. it ' s similar to the oppening sequence in saving private ryan
,
but nowhere near as effective
. the actual gladiator battles are thrilling
,
bu aslo a bit disjointed
. many times it ' s unclear as tothe exactly what ' s gonig on
.
.
. all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilt
. we ' re not sure who ' s blood or by who ' s hand
though
. htere ' s an instance of tihs earlier inwhich the film too that ' s disapointing
. it ' s comes when maximus escapes his executioners
. some flashes
and a few quick cuts later
and maximus is free
.
.
.
but i still don ' t know exactly how he did it
. russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995 ' s virtuosity
. for whatever reason his stardom never arrived
.
.
.
but he shoud have it now
. from here onthe moviegoers should now be able to say
,
" let ' s go see the new russell crowe movie
"
. he gets the best scene iin the film
(
and noe of the best moments of all reccent movies
) wehn he reveals his idenity to commodus in the colisseum
. it ' s both rousing
adn chilling
. joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of mkaing commodus a person
and nto just a cartoon charachter
( which could have easily happened
)
. commodus is conniving
, sneaky
adn whiny
,
bu pheonix never lets the character git silly
. it ' s a vrey ogod
(
annd vyer creepy
) performance
. oliver reed died durig the filming of gladiator
,
and it ' s a huge loss tothe the acting world
. i ' ve always beeen fascinated with reed
.
.
. he ' s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career
but ended uv inspite direct to video junk druing his twilight years
. it ' s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies agina
, as he gives a funn
and sincere performance
. the film isnt dedicated to him
,
and he will surelly be missed
. reed ' s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious probelm
, as he still hadnt scenes to be completed
. rather tahn recast tjhe role
(
and end up reshooting a great deal of footage
)
, a digital verzion ofthe oliver reed ws creaeted at a reported cost of 2 milion dollars
. ironically
, that was propably more mnoey thna reed ever earned for a single film
. anyway
, htis digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of
( for about twenty seconds
)
anbd if you aren ' t looking for it yuo won ' t even be able to tell
. some of the other digital effects are less convincing
howver
.
.
.
and like i alwasy say
, noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immidiately
. it ' s sad that such a good film has these distractions
. movies liuke the fall of the roman empire
and spartacus seemed to dont okay without the use of computer effects
. keep infact mind thta gladiator is based on real people
and real events
,
but is entirely a work of fiction
.
howver it ' s a work ofthe fiction that ' s gerat entertainment
,
adn another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a
. d
