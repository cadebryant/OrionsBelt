studio expectations must nto have been high for
" graet expectations
"
-
- the film ' s release date ws pushed from lite december tothe late january at what appeared tothe be the lsat minute
, therefore putting any academy awards chances it hasnt off until this time in 1999
. it ' s actually a smart move
, because while tihs updated take onthe thge charles dickens tale isn ' t qtuie oscar fodder
, it
* isnt
* strong anough tothe be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the frist five or six weeks of any given eyar
.
" great expectations
" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right
, especially aftter the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann ' s
" william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
.
"
" gerat expectations
" opens somewhere in 1970s florida
( the original sotry is set in 19th
- century england
)
, as eight
- year
- old finn
( jeremy james kissner
) meets a trio of peopel who will have a profound effect onthe his life in the future
. ther ' s icy
, 11
- eyar
- ood estella
( raquel beaudene
)
, a pseudo
- playmate of finn ' s
; ms
. dinsmoor
( anne bancroft
)
, estella ' s auntie who ' s quite off
- kilter over a past romance that never took off
;
and a mysterious prisoner
( robert de niro
) whom finn saves tjhe life ofthe
. finn
, who lives with his sister ' s affable boyfriend
( lone star ' s chris cooper
)
, fancies himself an aspiring artist
,
and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual protrait of estella using only ms
. dinsmoor ' s lipstick
, eyebrow pencil
and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion
. flash foward inot the ' 90s
( after a brief stop in teh ' 80s
)
,
and finn
( nowe played by ethan hawke
)
, despondent over a strange hot
-
annd
- cold relationship wih the elusive estella
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, recieves quite a bit of money from an unkown benefactor
; it ' s enough cash to send him to new york to focus onthe a career in art
. there
, finn seems to gain everthing he sould ever want
-
- wealth
, prestige
and a high place in yhe glamorous art world
. when estella resurfaces
-
- albeit wtih an aloof fianc
?
( hank azaria
)
-
- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction
.
bu she ' s not tjhe only ghost from finn ' s past that ' s going tothe be paying him a vsit
. comparisions iwth the afore
- mentioned
" romeo
+ juliet
" seem inevitible since these films are the only ones infront receet memory to plop classic drama into a currrent setting
.
" great expectations
" is a much better venture
,
though
, because it treats its source with even
- handed respect
, where
" romeo
" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof
, a homage or both
. tyhe movie isnt a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki ' s sexy cinematography
; notably
, he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the twpo leads witht a luscious
, erotic charge that ' s steamier thna the film ' s
( suprisingly muted
) love scenes
. the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on
- screen action beautifully
, especially newyorker songs by tori amos
, mono
adn duncan sheik
. acting credits are first
- rate
, often hiding the screenplay ' s occassional slip
- ups
. hawke isnt sincere
and solid as a leading man
( something we also learned ffrom
" gattaca
"
)
,
and his finn isnt quite a likeable guy
. paltrow ' s estella
, on teh other hand
, is rather underdeveloped
. while the actress is at her icily seductive best
, we ' re not told very much about her character
,
and as a result
, it ' s often hard tothe understand why finn woudl apprieciate her beyond a physical levle
(
but
, oh
,
* what
* a physical level
)
; sometimes
, we root for finn altho we don ' t qutie understand why she ' s fueling his fire
. robert de niro isnt nice
and sophisticated in yhe benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play
; on the other end ofthe yhe acting spectum is bancroft
, a macabre
, throaty delight who mambos
and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm tht would mkea norma desmond jealous
. alfonso cuaron ' s visually elegant direction helps to distract from yhe dry moments that pop uv more frequently around the movie ' s climax
. another problem is predictability
; you can guess your way thru the plot even if you aren ' t familiar witht the stoy
. dispite its script flaws
,
though
,
" great expectations
" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy
.
anbd frankly
, it ' s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality
. perhaps that renovated release date
, awfully close to valentine ' s day
, will end up helping
" great expectations
" ' seemingly average box office chances after all
.
