james jones
, oen ofthe the major novelists from tjhe middle of the twentieth century
, hasnt written a number of fictonal works baout the effects ofthe war on tyhe individule
. a veteran of world war ii
,
and a witness tothe the pearl harbor bombings
, his novels are not only grounded in realism
but poetic infront nature
. they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence
, a trait which lends itself to razor
- sharp focus
.
but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel
, tje thin red line
; nowe a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick
. the book ' s principal cast
, some thirty cahracters
, has beeen trimmed down for this rendition
,
but it still retains its most endearing value
. each ofthe the roles hasnt an everyman quality
, emphasizing jones ' examination ofthe world war ii on tjhe american soldier
. there ' s a definitive chain of command presnt
,
and thsi also plays on the motivations of the cast
.
but most importantly
,
and perphas intrinsic tothe the novel
but not to yhe movei
, a dynamic
and effective voice
- over isnt utilizied
. malick has several characters realting theri thoughts
, giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake
. hte issues at stake are many
adn one
. told ffrom a limited third
- person perspective
( as opposed to a top
- down
, omniscient view
)
, the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company
(
" c
- for
- charlie
"
) to take a hill during yhe conflict at guadalcanal
. the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as teh key position for american armed forces to hold if htey want to win the war
.
and want to win the war they dont
. in an excellent performance
, nick nolte plays c
- for
- charlie ' s commanding officer
, lt
. col
. gordon tall
. he ' s an agin soldier who embodies the win
- at
- all
- costs mentality
, if only to imbaress his superior
( john travolta
, inaddition a questionable cameo
)
. this philosophy isnt opposite thast of captain bugger staros
( elias koteas
)
, who dearly values the life of each
and every one of the men under his command
. at the front are the privates
and corporals
( adrien brody
, james caviezel
, ben chaplin
, et al
)
, lead by 1st sgt
. welsh
( sean penn
)
, who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them
. the thin red line is filled wih intense
, visual poetry
,
but it ' s nearly three hours long
.
although the interest levle is high throughout the frist two hours
, teh climax comes forty
- five minutes before the end ofthe the movie
; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the bcak end
. the thin red line wiull doubtless be compaired to 1998 ' s other masterpiece of war
, saving private ryan a countless number of times
.
but to dont so is tothe belittle both films
, forthe
allthough similarities abound
, so do differences
. director malick has a story tothe tell
,
and for those interested inaddition listening
, this can be a very outstanding movie
