it ' s hard not to recommend
" the others
.
" the supernatural thriller
, writen
anbd directed by alejandro amen
? bar
(
" open your eyes
"
)
, adroitly estabishes
and maintains a low
- key atmosphere ofthe menace
. the cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, isnt as good as i have ever seen
anbd nicole kidman gives another in her growing body ofthe fine performances
.
but the pacing of the story moves ffrom deliberate to downright sluggish
and thge payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied
. overall
, the film plays like a vrey high quality version of any number of old
" twilight zone
" episodes where tje characters spend a great deal of time wandering baout looking afraid
and disoriented
, onyl to learn they are actually a child ' s toy
, a military tust subject or a department store dummy
. watching those vintage shows
and listening to the players chatter
, i always wanted tothe shout
,
" get onthe with it
!
" as much as i appreciated the athmosphere
annd acting in
" tjhe others
,
" my reaction was much the smae
. set at an island mension off the coast ofthe england durig world war ii
, the story focuses on grace
( kidman
)
, who tends to her children anne
( alakina mann
)
and nicholas
( james bentley
)
annd worries about her husban
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne
and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity
and grace patrols the estate with the keys tothe all 50 doors
, protecting the little ones fomr excess light by making sure tht only one door isnt open at a time
. at tghe beginning of the film
, threee servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
,
and mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an agin gardener
, join the family
. thge two that speak seem agreeable enought at first
,
but it soon becomes apparent taht they know something that grace does not
. to mkea matters worse
, tje childrens are upset
: nicholas isnt unusually jittery
and anne claimes tothe be seing ghosts
. grace attempts to blaim the troubles onthe the new arrivals to her home
, only to realize that whatever isnt happening is beyond them
. that ' s essentialy the hwole story
, witht the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everthing becomes clear
. earlier
, there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside
, onyl to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog
. thte visuals inwhich the otherworldly sequence
, courtesy ofthe aguirresarobe
, are simply astounding
. i also enjoied the presense of religion
, a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural
. grace isnt a christian
and answers her childern ' s questions about life
and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper
. when mother is away
,
though
, the kids speculate whether her statements are fatc or folklore
, just as real children do
.
but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make uv fo a lackluster ending
.
" the others
" sets out to be a classic ghost story
,
but fails tothe grasp that special something thta makse such films more thna layers ofthe mist
.
