,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a feverish tale ofthe a homeless madman
- cum
- detective who
, on the morning ofthe february 14th
, discovers a
" valentine
" just outside his new york cave
: one of ella fitzgerald ' s strange fruit
, stuck in thge croch of a tree
-
- a young male modle murdered
annd frozen to a branch
. believing at first taht his imagined nemesis stuyvesant
, shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building
, is responsible for the murder
, romulus
( samuel l
. jackson
) is put on the trail ofthe an avant
- garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould
, david leppenraub
( colm feore
)
. his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit
and bouts with an ecstasy ofthe creation
( romulus ws a brilliant julliard
- trained pianist prior to his psychosis
)
, romulus uncovers clues
adn harrases suspects on his way tothe convincing his police
- woman daughter
( aunjanue ellis
) thast even
though he ' s a nut
, that doesn ' t mean that he can ' t solve a high
- profile society murder
. every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas
,
and every character teh same
,
_ hte caveman ' s valentine
_ is a consept so
" high concept
" that it suddenly became claer to me that the film fits inot tje comic book genre of entertainment
, with romulus ' s
" caveman
" a slightly omre mundane version of todd mcfarlane ' s urban noir hero
, spawn
. with a long
- vanished wife
( tamara tunie
) acting as a spiritual guide
, the occasional social caste commentary
, the secret base in a cave
, a divergent genuis personality withthe a network of informants
annd supporters
,
and a wickedly colourful arch
- enemy
, teh film piles on the lurid comic book details
and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren ' t inscribed with
" gotham pd
.
" that being said
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy
, a frank miller graphic novel thgat has the audacity to portray the blood staining a feild of virgin snow expanding tothe form thte shape of a heart
. the difficulties with the film spring ffrom the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when
, in fact
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of tjhe homeless
( again like mcfarlane ' s spawn
) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in governmnet
and thte arts
. it is no small detail that our hero
, romulus
, is nto only named fo a member of the ruling class who lieved his life
( in legend
) without knowledge of his royal birth
,
but also that our romulus has turned his back on tghe comforts of the literati in favour ofthe a mystical xistence living in a cave inwhich a park
. in thte romulus mythology
, signs of romulus ' royal blood is brung by twelve vultures
, while in yhe film
, hte call to acation for our hero comes in hte form of nto the carrion birds
,
but of the carrion itself
. whether or nto romulus of
_ yhe caveman ' s valentine
_ will found a nation
, or
, in the case ofthe novelist george dawes green
, upon whose novel his own screenplay is based
, a franchise
, the fatc remains thyat
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is easily the most misunderstood film ofthe 2001 thus far
. it
, along iwth m
. night shyamalan ' s
_ unbreakable
_
, is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format wich hasnt
, since miller ' s seminal
" the dark knight returns
"
, redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics
. readers of sam keith ' s brilliant
" tyhe maxx
" comic series
( or of mtv ' s short
- lived animated adaptation of the same
) are already familiar with the diea of a homeless man placed in yhe position of knight errant
and king of his own twisted demesne
. thte failure of both
" the maxx
" tv show
and of
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_
( not forgetting the inital backlash against
_ unbreakable
_
) suggests that the publich may not be ready for america ' s suprizing contributions to dark fantasy
. luxuriantly lit
, brashly saturated
,
and comic
- panal framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent
(
_ death in venice
, ca
_
)
, hwile inhabiting robin standefer ' s
(
_ practical magic
_
) mesmerizing sets
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film
. kasi lemmons
, folowing uv her briliant 1997 debut
,
_ eve ' s bayou
_
, which played onthe similar themes of manufactured realities
and mysticism
, fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs
annd lost boys
, artists
and sufferring
.
_ tghe caveman ' s valentine
_ is an elevant
anbd piquant expression of hope for justice inaddition a tilted landscape
. claerly not for every taste
, when approached with the corect paradigm
, it is noe of the most stunning
and intensely fascinating films of the year
: a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post
- modern audiance with urine
- stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights
and red capes
.
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a fine
and a courageous film
, crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is hte best
anbd truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot ' s rat ' s alley wasteland
