: hlaloween reviewed by vince yim
` you htikn you nkow all baout vampires
.
.
. believe me
.
.
. you nkow f
* ck all
. ' with these words
, we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name ofthe lilith silver
( palyed by eileen daly
)
. made into an immortal a century
and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake
, she continues tothe alleviate boredom witht her state of being
. so
, what ' s an undead girl to do
, except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible
, git out her guns
, seduce a few guys
,
and kill a few people for money
and blood
? with thgat out of the way
, let me say this
. this film is bad
. htis film isnt relaly
, really bad
.
yet somehow
, it isnt strangely enjoyable
. with all teh elements of a direct to video horror flick
? buxom babes
, gore
, cheesy dialogue
,
and bad acting
? any casual film viewer would be more inclined tothe spend their money on renting innocent blood or goign to see blade
. still
, it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film
. agreed
, it might be
,
but is far from being the best vampire flick ever
. period
. razor blade smile has some rether high production values
, shown by the nice overall tone tothe the film
. the film isnt also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore
, with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating
, doesn ' t sleep inwhich a coffin
(
bu leaves noe next to her cmoputer
)
,
and sees religeon as tyhe
` opium of the peoples '
( hence
, immunity to crosses
)
.
bu aside from that
, it doesn ' t stray too far away from horror film conventions
. that is
, unless taht is intentional
. razor blade smile literally goes for the throat
,
then pumps the wound full of processed cheese
. you can ' t halp
but laff when a female vampire gets decapitated
and her severed head goes flying into a puddle
. you ' ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations
( to distract two female guards
, lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them
adn dials the number
)
. yuo ' ll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale
and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably
.
and
then
, there ' s the sudden twist ending
( i have enough heart not to give it away
)
. the film refuses to take itself seriously
, whcih isnt a good thing
, as by the time lilith zips uv her skin
- tight body suit
and
then unzips it jstu to show teh right ammount of cleavage
, you ' ve most likely forgotten the main point of the story
.
bu in case you really care
, she ' s been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to thge so
- called illuminati
,
and she ' s leaving a huge mess behind forthe teh polical to find
. as much as my criticisms
, this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends
and withing groups
. almost destind forthe cult
- status
, teh film ' s campy
, cheesy overtones actually owrk towords tyhe film
. hwile this may not necessarily be the film you ' d want to be seen watching by yourself
, it makse for a fun tiem at the movies
.
