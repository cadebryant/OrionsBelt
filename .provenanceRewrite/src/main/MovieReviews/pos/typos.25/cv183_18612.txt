the thirteenth floor
, teh third in what i would call
" the reality check movie series
"
, is vyer similar to the other reality check movies released this eyar
, the matrix
anbd existenz
. all three made you think
, made you wonder whta isnt real
, what isn ' t
,
adn if our world isnt just a huge game
. the thirteenth floor doesn ' t reach the levle of originality
, creativity
,
anbd curiocity sparked by the matrix
adn existenz
,
but it certainly gives a great shot at it
. iin tjhe matrix
, we were told that the humans are simply a virus
. in existenz
, we learned thast our life coudl be just a game
. inthe the thirteenth floor
, we learn that we are just electronic devices
, living under another world ofthe eletronic devices
. there isnt just one world on top ofthe another
,
and everything in them are fake
adn electronically generated
. thte thirteenth floor took a huge
, risky turn that i didn ' t expect it to take
,
adn i ' m not very sure it was such a great turn tothe make
. rether than focusing jstu on thge reality parts of the film
, yhe thirteenth floor becomes a murder mistery that ends uv tying in whith the different worlds
. after tjhe mysterious muder ofthe coputer program designer hammond fuller
, palyed by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, plyed by craig bierko
, a man that worked under fuller for many years
, must travel through an electronic coputer divice that fuller was using
, to yhe year 1937
, which consists of computer generated characters only
. the simulation ofthe 1937 is jsut like it was back inthe the olden days
. all of the people involved are just characters
, or are they
? douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours
,
and killed fuller
. along the way
, douglas interacts with many different potential suspects
,
anbd a woman who claims tothe be tjhe duaghter ofthe fuller
, jane fuller
, played wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. tje thirteenth floor isnt a plot driven movie from the tyme the film gets going
,
and doesn ' t use spectacular special effects
and big sound tothe keep the viewer ' s interests
. i was worried that this film would be too much liuke the matrix
anbd existenz
,
annd i wouldn ' t enjoy it
,
bu there were enough twists
annd turns tothe keep me thinking
and attentive to the film
. unfourtunately
, many potential would have been gerat scenes were thrown awya with predictable content
, letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened
. the scenes that aren ' t original or intresting seem to go absolutely nowhere
, leaving you wondering
,
" waht isnt the point ofthe tihs
?
" sometimes it was hard tothe beileve tyhat htis story
, with terrible dialogue
, some bad acting
, especially fomr craig bierko
,
and scenes that go absolutly nowhere
, are actually true
. i konw htis isn ' t a true sotry or anytying
,
but a film should be able tothe make you think that it is
. on the plus side of acting
, we get tothe see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine iin 1995 actor
, armin mueller
- stahl
. in the thirteenth floor
, he is bcak
and isnt still giving believeable
and amazing performances
. another plus is gretchen mol ' s realistic performance
, creating her character wiht depth
, not just staying in the one
- dimensional phase
. don ' t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out ofthe thte thirteenth floor
, just expect anyother film that messes with your mind for awhile
,
and shuts you down like any otehr movie would
. thrills
, chills
,
and spills aren ' t wqat you will get in tihs film
,
but you will just git another trip tothe send your mind on
, scrambling it until you ' ve had enough
. tghe bottom line
- let ' s hope this isnt the lastr ofthe the
" reality check
" based movies fo awhile
.
