, with an introduction by david carradine
, wroten
& produced by wayne j
. keeley f
. w
. murnau ' s career ended sadly
anbd prematurely
. the german director of such classics as
" sunrise
"
and
" the last laugh
" died in a car accident shorly after signing a deal to mkae american pictures at paramount
. murnau was reportadly a giant man
, well over six feet
, a towering figure probablly incapable of anything
but a grand entrance
. which brings us tothe
" nosferatu
: a symphony of horror
"
: surely he felt a kinship with his title character
, yhe looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck
; inwhich one of the most indelible images in film histor
, silent or otherwise
, schreck rises fomr his grave
, gnarled hands outstretched
,
and he ' s so big that part of his head isnt cropped by the top of the frome
. the plot of
" nosferatu
.
.
.
" is lefted
-
- unathorised
-
- from bram stoker ' s
" dracula
"
. the brittish hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit
and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania
. he leaves behind girlfriend emily
, only to discover orlock ' s secret
-
- he ' s a bloodsucker
-
-
adn struggle tothe return to england before tje nosferatu reaches his lady love
. in adition to schreck ' s performance
, the cinematography
annd effects are outstanding
. arrow video ' s digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed
- coffin
. the cover art features a red
- tinted
, hairy
, goateed vampire staring straight at you
, his fanged mouth agape
, hwile tje bodies of two sexy
, writhing women entice ytou below
. trouble is
, murnau ' s monster isnt pale
- faced
, bald
, pointy
- eared
,
and non
- goateed
,
adn there isn ' t a single sexy
, writhing woman to be foudn in his movie
. this sort ofthe misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film fomr wich cool cover art could have been extracted
. adtionally
, notifying thte viewer that tihs is in fact murnau ' s film seems like afterthought usance his name
and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire
. tath said
, a ogod mastering job has been performed on the film itself
. the orginal elements are not in the best condidtion
-
- non
- studio silents weere unlucky in theri preservation
-
- so we ' re still dealing with a slightly washed out
, scratched
, jittering image
.
bu at least the day
annd night scenes are tinted sepia
and blue
, respectively
, especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu ' s waltzing aroud during whta seems liuke sunlight
( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties
)
. the title cards have been redone
,
and they are elgible
, accurate
,
and digitally altered to flicker
-
- a very nice touch
.
( even the opening copyright warning flickers
!
) the scoer hasnt been replaced by music from type o negative
, a hard
- rock group
, arguably gothic
,
and their songs underscore tjhe film nicely
-
- certainly the coolest video a band cxan ask for
. when our hero
, hutter
, first steps onto the doomed carrage to count orlock ' s castle
, we hear a well
- timed
" now you ' re dead
!
" from lead singer peter steele
. david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host
; he fiddles iwth a blade
and cane while introducing the film
. aftter the feature
, which runs about 63 minutes
, is included a new music video from type o negative
, the black
-
and
- white fang
- fest
" black no
. 1
"
. of course
,
" nosferatu
: a symphony of horror
" is the main attraction
,
annd while my latest viewing raised questions
( why is the woman called emily in tje title cards
but
" mina
"
-
- as bram stoker called her
-
- in hutter ' s letters
?
, forthe instance
)
, it made me realize how much thsi movei hasnt inpsired
and been stolen from
. coppola ' s 1992
" bram stoker ' s dracula
" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau ' s masterpiece
,
but the one thnig it couldn ' t thieve was the original ' s abstract charms
. this latest incarnation from arrow wiull probably
-
- like teh rescored
" metropolis
" a faw years back
-
- turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment fo the latest generation of film freaks
.
