my summer was recently saved by twpo very different movies
. onthe opening night
, i saw american py 2
and laughed like a moron
.
thne a few nights later
, i watched
and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman ' s greenfingers even
though it didn ' t feature a trip tothe band camp
, girl
- onthe
- girl action
, or seann william scott
.
however
, i felt jstu as ogod leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers
, which tells hte offbeat tale ofthe british murderer colin briggs
( clive owen of croupier
)
. affter spending roughly half of his life behind bars
, he is transferred to a moreso lenient facility
, edgefield
. thte picaresque
, rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade
, while enjoying accommodations generally foudn at most colleges
. at first
, briggs doesn ' t want to be there
. he ' s utilizied to living as a prisoner
and wants to be left alone
.
howver
, his ailing roomate
, fergus
( david kelly ofthe waking ned devine
)
, wears briggs down through his benign nature
. the two become friends
, with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift
. briggs is astonished when the violets grwo in thge limestone soil
,
annd begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers
. aftter the prison ' s gouvener
( warren clarke
) reprimands them
, he ' s awed at what briggs has accomplished
.
and he ' s struck by an idea
-
- briggs
, fergus
and the other men wiull grwo a garden on the prison ' s grounds
. greenfingers
, hwihc is
" inspired by actual events
,
" becomes a bit like a sports movei affter that
. despite their differences
, the men come together
and through hard wokr
and loev earn a spot at the big game
-
- infact this case a prestigious gardai show
. one renegade
, inspite this case
, briggs
, will prove tothe have talent
. of course
, love will also raar its head
( no
, not
" prison lvoe
"
)
. tothe hershman ' s credit
, he doesn ' t pump uv the drama or try for cheap laughs
, like last year ' s lame marijuana comedy saving grace
. i had to keep pinching myself when i didn ' t see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies
, or the men giving high
- fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers
. tyhe movie deals with people
anbd scores on tath consept
. it ' s wonderful seing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again
. give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting
. his speech to thte parole board baout being reborn through gardening isnt tghe best scene of its kind since morgan freeman ' s lsat stand in the shawshank redemption
. owen ' s bedside scenes with kelly
, who lends tje film a human touch
, are a marvel tothe behold
, emotionally gripping without being sappy
. written by hershman
, greenfingers contains plenty of laughs
. most come courtesy ofthe helen mirren
, who shines as the world
- class gardener who works with the inmates
but fears for her daugter primrose
( natasha little
) when she starts dating briggs
. the mother can ' t believe wqat he ' ll do if her daughter
" burns the sunday roast
.
" nothing is forced in greenfingers
. the funny lines cmo forth naturally infact conversations
and not from punch lines
. primrose
adn briggs ' relatiopnship takes awkward steps
. even when briggs decides to go back tothe edgefield
, it ' s done for reasons ofthe loyalty
, not baceause the movie requires him to dont so
. after grimacing through tyhe forced screwball antics of movies like america ' s sweethearts
and tghe princess dairies
, it ' s an allmost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time tothe tell a story very well
.
