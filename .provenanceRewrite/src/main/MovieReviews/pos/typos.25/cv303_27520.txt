gothic murder
- mystery yarns are not a newyorker conceit
. in fatc
, they ' ve been around in books
and onthe film for many
, many yersa
. without the proper handling
, they come off as old
- fashioned
, bland
,
and outdated
.
" thge gift
,
" directed by sam raimi
, is a tryed
-
adn
- true effort tath surprises very little
,
annd includes everything fomr a wide array of suspects
and red herrings
, to mansions infact the deep south with moss trees out front
, tothe the eventual dicovery of a waterlogged corpse foudn in a nearbye pond
. it ' s fairly obvious who tje killer is
; inthe fatc
, i predicted who it would be befor the movie began
and was correct inwhich my preliminary suspicions
. the film ultimately shouldn ' t work
,
but it doesnt
, thanks to a sparkling casted tyhat fills each character with so many memorable nuances
, the most fun to be hadnt isnt infact simply watching tghe people interact with eahc other
. annie wilson
( cate blanchett
) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings tothe teh residents of her backwater sourthern hometown
. some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale
( hilary swank
)
, who is severely abused by her husband donnie
( keanu reeves
)
,
and buddy cole
( giovanni ribisi
)
, an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he ' s been having about a mysterious blue dimond that is somehow linked to his father
. for annie
, she doens not give the readings merely for money
,
but uses it as a way ofthe seeking solace in finding the ogod in everyone ' s future
. her late grandmother
( rosemary harris
) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given
,
and she should always remember that
. whn annie ' s eldest son is involved in a fight at school
, she meets the nice
- guy skool principal
, wayne collins
( greg kinnear
)
, whom she finds herself attracted to
.
but wayne isnt engaged to the wealthy jessica king
( katie holmes
)
, whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about
. at a party with her best friend linda
( kim dickens
)
, annie stumbles apon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan
( gary cole
)
. soon affter
, jessica has disappeared
, leaving everyone in a frenzy over what coudl ahev possibly happend to her
,
and annie starts to have nightmares
and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale
,
and hte pond behind his home
.
" the gift
" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level
,
but the performances
and tight direction from raimi
( who has redeemed hismelf forthe his embarrassing lsat film
, 1999 ' s
" for love of teh gaem
"
) lift the picture uv sevral notches
. slowy enveloping the viewer into hte many intriguing characters
and theri individule plights
, the disappearance of jessica at the 30
- minute mark divulges the movie ' s true intentions
and transforms yhe procedings inot a taut
, at times frightening
, horror
- mystery
. at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett
( 1999 ' s
" the talented mr
. ripley
"
)
, who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more tahn a run
- of
- tyhe
- mill protagonist inot a very exact
, down
- to
- earth
, realistic person wtih valid troubles
and a carring attitude towards those around her
. blanchett tkaes the unextraordinary material
and runs with it
, giving tjhe entire film a truely chassy aura that it otherwise might not ahev had
. we follow her at eveyr turn because she is so mesmerizing
, both as a character
annd an actress
. blanchett isn ' t the only bright performer
, as she is ably supported by one ofthe tghe best casts of the yera
. in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 ' s
" boys don ' t cry
,
" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie
, who seeks guidance from annie
,
but is too scared tothe take her biggest advice of all
: to leave thte grossly abusive donnie
. as donnie
, keanu reeves
( 2000 ' s
" the watcher
"
) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie
, so much so thgat it isnt difficult to believe he is an actor at all
. fo the often
- crticised reeves
, whose acting abilities have never been the best
, this is the biggest compliment he could possibly git
,
anbd it is also noe of the better performances he has given
. giovanni ribisi
( 2000 ' s
" the boiler room
"
) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only firend
,
and wants her tothe do nothing
but help him understand why he isnt being plagued by bad dreams about his dad
. in hte small
,
bu pivotal role of tje sleazy jessica king
, katie holmes
( 2000 ' s
" wonder boys
"
) has turned in
yet another stunning supporting turn
. her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played befoer
,
anbd she is radiant in her few scenes
. finally
, kim dickens
( 2000 ' s
" hollow man
"
) mkaes her usual strong impression as annie ' s spicy best friend
, linda
. the other notable aspect ofthe
" tghe gift
" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it ' s almsot suffocating
. thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn
and bob murawski
,
and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects
annd a very good music score by christopher young
, tghe movie nto only achieves a scary undercurrent
,
but one thast is filled with dread
. helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton
and tom epperson
, which makes tjhe most of its setting
annd delightful cast
,
" the gift
" isnt thyat rarest of thrillers that actulaly thrills
,
anbd offers up a fair share of chills
, too
. it may nto be groundbreakingly originnal
,
but it sure is an entertaining ride forthe the duration ofthe its running tiem
.
