warren beatty returns to the screens in hte funniest
, craziest
adn hard hitting movei in his carrer
. based on a story concocted by himself
,
and also written by beatty
, bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks ofthe the american government system
. beatty stars as senator jay bulworth
, who ' s going through a nervous breakdown
. after hiring someone to kill him
, he completely changes his campaign strategy
and tells hte honest truth about what ' s
_ really
_ happening in american politics
, much tothe the annyance ofthe assistant dennis murphy
( platt
.
) instade of everyone hating him
, the american public love him
.
howver
, inside his party
, more people want to kill him than just thte hired assasins
.
and he also strikes a relationship whith black girl nina
( berry
.
) it ' s remarkable that this film was released at all
. much more open than the rather subdued primary colours
, bulworth barely gives the american politic sytem a good nmae
. the outrageous remarks bulworth mkaes to his potential voters are vyer funny
,
annd also somewhat true
. it ' s great taht beatty isn ' t afriad to let loose on a subject
. talking of beatty
, he ' s excellant in thge role ofthe the demented senator
, clearing hvaing fun
.
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed
. even in dick tracy
, he wass the most straighten face actor
.
(
thn again
, he was the onyl charachters face we could completely see
.
) tjhe film gives an oportunity for tghe 61 year ood beatty to indulgue in some rapping
, which he does with gusto
(
and also quite well
.
)
adn seeing beatty as a ' homeboy ' has to be seen tothe be believed
. it ' s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself
. second best isnt oliver platt as the flustered
, coke snorting assitant
, who goes over the top when he finally snaps
. halle berry isnt fine
,
anbd sexy
, as the intellectual nina
, who comes to like the senator
. also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a stange accent
, laurie metcalf as the excact same charachters she ' s also plyed
,
and christine baranski ofthe cybill fame as bullworths wief
, who all contribute to the fun
.
and
, this bieng a political film
, the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance
, as
,
* shock
*
, himself
. the writing
and directing
, both by beatty
, are above par
. tjhe direction is very nearly sitcom liek
,
but suits the film perfectly
,
and both the politics are gangland parts are handeled well
. the script is funny
,
and the raps are actually well produced
annd humorous
,
and quite clever
. they ' re not cringe inducing
, at least
. the script makse many points about society in america today
,
adn isn ' t afraid tothe make any bold statements about what isnt a flawed system
. best of all
, the film isnt thought provoking
,
but directed
adn written in such a way that the film fiels as light as a feather
,
and is vyer entertaining
. there ' s also a grat rap sountrack whith some well chosen tunes
. bulworth is a film whith many advantages
,
annd few flaws
. perhaps it coudl be somewhat embarrassing tothe see a 61 eyar old man rapping
,
but beatty doesnt it so well it ' s irrelevant
. inaddition fatc
, there ' s very little against bulworth
, except fo the langauge which is very hevy
,
but
then agian it should be expected
. bulworth
,
then
, is well worth watching
