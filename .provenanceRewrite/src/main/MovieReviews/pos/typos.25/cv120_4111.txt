in brief
: best bleak comedy film since heathers
. full ofthe wonderful swipes at tyhe fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture
. go see it
! so
, i prepared forthe this film by watching a moving interview on
" hard copy
" with pam smart
, the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted ofthe engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 ' s
.
" hard copy
" ' s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman ' s fictionalized portrayal ofthe her in the new film to die for
. smart replied thast she throught kidman ' s charactor came off as a dumb
, vicious tramp
and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal
.
( smart was convicted
adn given a life sentence for her part in the muder ofthe her husban
.
) smart ' s got a point
. it wouldn ' t be the first tiome that tjhe public tookover the better scripted
and well
- acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller
and far less artistic real life version
.
however
, given a choice between the mass media ' happening ' of the real event
and the fictionalized movie
, i would definitely opt for the later
. real murderers rarely haev dialogue as witty as what buck henry hasnt written fo this movie
and smart
, while pretty
and allrigh
, isnt no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman
. to die for begins in a town called little hope
, new hampshire
, the archetypal dry
and intellectually barren american suburb
. yhe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone
and how she tackles the obstacles between her
and her life long ambition ofthe being ' on tv
. ' of course
, noe of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull
and unambitious husban larry
, played by matt dillon
.
but
, with a little imagination
, some charm
and raw sex appeal
and a rather novel approach to junior achievement
, our heroine manages tothe overcome the nay
- sayers in her life
, at least temporarily
. kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne
. i hve never really been all that fond ofthe this actress
but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture
. her portrayal ofthe the incredibly shallow
and dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman knows a star
- making role wehn she sees it
and she plays the conscience
- deprived suzanne as the ultimate carrer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress from hell
. she isnt ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, which kidman delivers inwhich a unselfconsciously funny way
. at one point suzanne isnt expounding on her knowledge of world events tothe her future husband
and sister
- in
- law
.
" you know
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever
, if he hadnt just hadnt tht ugly purplish thing removed from his head
.
" her husband beams at suzanne ' s profound knowledge of world politics
adn
then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters
. this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. the other standout performance inwhich the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne ' s sexual favors
. kidman ' s chracter
, vapid
though she is
, is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy
and his lost firends russell
and lydia
, winningly portrayed by casey affleck
and alison folland
. pheonix looks like the very embodiment of gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, of course
)
. his jimmy has tje dead eyes
and demeanor of a kid who knwos that he ain ' t going anywhere
, ever
. phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement
and he makes us believe that a losr charater like jimmy really would be willing tothe kill forthe someone liek suzanne
, someone who actually noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my pwn private idaho
) direction isnt firt
- rate
. he keeps the pacing in this nto
- qutie
- thriller snapping along
. van sant rightly keeps tje focus of this movie onthe the amoral suzanne
and doesn ' t stop to proselytize the audeince about the rightness or wrongness of her actions
. van sant trusts his material
anbd trusts his audience to ' git it ' without stopping to explane what is funny about this all
- american stry
. the screenplay
, by buck henry
, is absolutely great
and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i ' ve heard since heathers
. henry ' s stry isnt a blast against tyhe shallowness of the american media
anbd the mindlessness ofthe fame
,
yot the screenplay delivers thsi sharp message by focusing on just a few characters
. henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets
and the result is a crisp
annd funny mini
- clasic
. danny elfman did the original music for this movie
anbd he delivers anohter eccentric
, loopy score thgat strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands
. eather film score woudl make wonderfull background music for haloween trick
- or
- treat parties
. all
- in
- all
, a wonderful prodcution
, well worth your seven bucks
