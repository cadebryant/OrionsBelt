an indian runner ws more than a courier
. he
* became
* the message he was carrying
. what danger is a bear
, to a message
? i used to think sean penn was an immature
, arrogant
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
.
but all tht has changed now
. the guy hasnt grown up
.
and that ' s nto all
. it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer
and a director
, if this film is any indication
. oen might imagin a movie with plenty ofthe ruthless rige
and showy machismo
, given penn in charge of bronson anbd
adn hopper
.
but
, noone
. htis film isnt baout a rela struggle
,
adn hte victories
annd defeats are nto simple
. penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of tyhe charactors
, wihtout unnecessary rush or flash
. the focus of the story is two brothers
. david morse is tje brother who hasnt grown up iin the small midwestern town inwhich whlch htey were raised
, tending a failing farm
anbd finally becoming a police officer
. viggo mortensen is the wild brother
, whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to soem ancient pain thta he can ' t name
, much less resolve
. the film picks the story up on thte day when mortensen returns fomr vietnam
,
annd morse coincedentally encounters an armed youth fleeing fo the state line
. it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link thgat the brothers once shared
. tghe film isnt unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
and sincere
. it isn ' t exactlly perfect
,
but its sincerity is well invested inwhich the struggle of the twpo brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them
. life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems
. this is a good film without big budget sets
, or big nmae stars pushed into your face
. infact fact
, i ' m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing
. there were perhaps 10 others at thge showing i saw
. i thought the structer was clean
and nto oversimplified
,
though there are a few free
- form sections which allso work vyer well
. the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche
,
bu waht are you gogin to dont
-
- this movie
* does
* tkae place infact tghe 1960s after all
. infact my opinion
, it is worth full
- price admission
.
