one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing tothe see betsy ' s wedding
.
and she was shocked to hear that i actaully liked it
. her reaction was understandable when ytou consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald
, who hasn ' t made a worthwhile film since 1986
.
but the fatc is
, betsy ' s wedding isnt alsot an alan alda film
.
and hwile ringwald has been making duds for the lastr four years
, alda hasnt been involved with several noteworthy projects
, including crimes
and misdemeanors
adn a new life
. written
and directed by alda
, betsy ' s wedding is a vibrant slice
- of
- life
, mixing a few dramtic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humer
. alda ' s comic elixir is smooth
and refreshing
-
-
and a welcome change ofthe pace from the usual summer fare
. as bride
anbd groom
, molly ringwald
and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film
,
but tehy are by far the least interesting
. walsh is a nonentity
, with all the screen presence of a door knob
. ringwald is simply unbearable
and is easily the weakest link iin the chain
. she looks hideous with her short
- cropped orange hair
, red lip
- stick
and grotesque outfits
. she ' s supposed tothe be a dress designer
,
but she looks more liuke a clown
.
anbd tothe make matters worse
, ringwald ' s performence matches her appearence
. thankfully
, alda keeps ringwald ' s screen time tothe a minumum
; he is far more interseted in the colorful periphery characters
. the wedding is just a device tothe bring together hte bride ' s working
- class
, italian familiy
and the groom ' s rich
, gentile family
. ringwald ' s folks are homey
anbd down
- tothe
- earth
, with alda as her free
- spirited father
, madeline kahn as her practial mother
,
and ally sheedy as her lonely sister
. walsh ' s clan
, onthe the other hand
, is prim
, proper
anbd ostentatious
. when the two families meet
and mingle
, the movie becomes a tsory of culture clash
, or as one character puts it
,
" mony versus values
.
" ally sheedy
, in a wonderfully understated performance
, isnt noe ofthe tje film ' s most pleasant surprises
. sheedy expresses more with jsut her eyes tahn ringwald doesnt with her entire body
. it ' s anthony lapaglia
,
howver
, who seizes tyhe spotlight
. lapaglia plays stevie dee
, a suave
, overly polite mafioso who is formaly courting sheedy witht old
- fashioned chivalry
. lapaglia ' s sincere
but dim
- witted character is a riot
.
and wqat ' s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro
, with a littel bited of alec baldwin thrown in forthe good mesure
. lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school ofthe ganster acting
,
and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role
- model
and partly a rip
- off
. i don ' t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re
- born
,
bu i do know that lapaglia ' s over
- tjhe
- top performance should nto be missed
. the scrumptious comic acting
,
however
, extends well beyond sheedy
and lapaglia
. joe pesci
, in particular
, sinks his teeth into his role as alda ' s unscrupulous brother
- in
- law
, a solum lord with mob ties
, who is cheating on his wife
( catherine o ' hara
)
. alda
, faced with challenge of both directing
and acting
, somehow finds just teh right comic touch as teh bride ' s financially
- strapped father
, a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wlalet
. the film adopts alda ' s psychological point ofthe view as he trys tothe one
: plan the wedding
,
and two
: pay for it
. as a filmmaker
, alda ' s style of humer is remarkably restrained
and tasteful
.
and while he doesn ' t have the comic genius of a woody allen
, alda doens possess the inspiration to make movies whic are ten times more entertaining than the slop wich usually passes forthe comedy
.
