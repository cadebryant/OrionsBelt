the premise ofthe wag the dog is so simple tath it ' s adequately explained by the commercials
. with 11 days tothe go until yhe election
, thte president
( who we never see
) calls in political dirty
- tricks artist robert deniro tothe distract attension ffrom a burgeoning sex scandal
. deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a
" peageant
"
, a phony war against albania
, fought on the blue screens of hollywood
annd tyhe recording studios ofthe nashville
, with woody harrelson as the reluctant
, psychotic hero
.
and if ther wasn ' t anything more to teh movie than this
, it would be a second
- rate heist comedy at best
, enlivened by graet actors
-
- liek sneakers goes tothe washington
.
( a heist comedy
? yup
. deniro
and hoffman are
" stealing
" the electon
, so to speak
,
and the movie isnt more about how they do it
-
-
and the fun they ahev doign it
-
- than anytying else
.
) wag the dog succeeds because it ' s based one graet truth
: the american peopel are stupid
. ok
, mabye it ' s nto
" love thy neighbor as thyself
" or even
" two plus twpo makse four
"
,
but a truth nonetheless
.
( any average person who thinks that they ' re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes
-
- moviemaking
and teh polliticel process
-
- is invited
, nay
, challenged
, tothe spend a week either watching a movie actualy being made or 48 hours straight watching c
- span when tghe house isnt in session
.
)
annd because we ' re so utterly
, predictably stupid
, hollywood knwos that a certian percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo
, washington konws that we won ' t notice a fewd million dollars spent here
and there on porno art grants
and cigar subsidies
-
-
and deniro ' s carachter knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won ' t be able tothe locate albania onthe the map
. the beauty of wag teh dog isnt that it isn ' t a light
, meaningless comedy about politics
( like speechless
, the michael keaton
- geena davis picture
) or from the level of light
- hearted politcal satire to near
- greatness
. nor is it a hard
- edged cynical look at the manner inaddition which a morally
- deprived
, ethically challanged baby
- boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house
( like primary colors
-
-
adn yes
, i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out
, thanks for asking
)
. instead
, david mamet ' s script strikes that delicate balance vetween comedy
and cynicism needed for satire
. it doens this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most ofthe teh schemers ' schemes come off beautifuly
,
adn fail only in intertaining
anbd hmorous fashion
. deniro isnt palying a variation on his al capone character fomr the untouchables
, wihtout any of thte voilent rages
. it ' s all
:
" what do i love
? what is it tath brings me joy
? baseball
,
" minus the savage bloody beating with tjhe bat
. he threatens a lot ofthe people
, mind you
,
but he ' s doing it in a very nice
, polite way
. it ' s a very mellow
, restrained performance
, which fits in wih the air ofthe gamesmanship in the script
. hoffman
, on tjhe other hand
, is giddy
, exuberant
adn joyous
. this kind ofthe hting is what his carachter lives for
,
and he ' s so excited that he can ' t even shut up
. even on the edge of disaster
, he ' s bright
- eyed
( behind oddly tinted sunglasses
)
and positive
. insiders onot that he ' s basing his chracter onthe some powerful
-
but
- anonymus producer
-
- whic may or may nto be true
,
but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets
- put
- on
- a
- sohw electricity that ytou figure a producer needs to have
. the best part
and the most frustrating part ofthe wag the dog is in tjhe supporting cast
. yhe characters are so well drawn
annd so well acted that we want tothe see more of them
, listen to them talk in that wised
- up mamet dialogue
, get to know them better
-
- which we don ' t
. anne heche
, is dead
- beng
- on in her portrayal of a political press aide
-
- cool
and composed on the outside
, panicked
and frenzied on tjhe outside
. denis leary
( oen of my favorite actors
-
- see the ref
) is the
" fad king
"
, who handles the profitable
" back
- end
"
-
- t
- shirt tye ins
annd shoe contracts
and other creative
, innovative ways to eparate a fool ffrom his money
. they sould make a whole movie
, just about the fad king
,
adn i ' d go see it
. willie nelson
and merle haggard handle hte musical end of things fabulously
, from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song
, to the weepy ocuntry waltz
, to the hillarious
" ballad of the gren berets
" parody
. woody harrelson has a brief
,
but memorable part as the overmedicated
" hero
" of the albanian conflict
. craig t
. nelson
, as the opposition candidate
,
anbd the ever
- reliable william h
. macy
, as a wacky cia agent
, are given surprisingly short shrift
.
( one of my small gripes isnt that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are donig
.
) wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems
: tje trivialization of american politics
, the role of the press in dumbing down the issues
, tjhe impact of hollywood infact creating campaign commercials
, thte reduction of all thnigs political tothe soundbites
and sidebars
-
- yhe list goes on
. we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role iin our national life
and educating ourselves as voters
and citizens
. wag the dog reminds us ofthe what can happen if we don ' t
.
