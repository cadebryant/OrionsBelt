as a devout atheist
annd an avowed believer inwhich aliens
, i hvae soem diea of how ellie aroway
( jodie foster
) feels
.
but beacuse my reasons for nto partaking in religion are different than hers
, i can ' t say that i do exactlly
. her reason is thyat she needs solid proof
: there is no proof that god existed
, so therefor she does not believe
. ellie also believes inaddition aliens
,
and has spended most ofthe her life trying to prove they exsist
. how can she say she doesn ' t believe in god because of the lack of proof
,
anbd
then say she believes in aliens
, whitch are gereally less beleived in than god without sounding liuke a hypocrite
? that ' s the catch
- 22
. when aliens ffrom the star vega fax her some plans for a divice to transport someone tothe them
( okay
, well
, htey didn ' t realyl
* fax
* them
.
.
.
) ellie wants to be the one tothe go
,
but because of her atheism she is denied the position
. how dumb is that
? she dicovers hte transmitions
,
then she isn ' t allowed tothe go
. well
, because of a bomb
and a psychopath
( jake busey
)
, she
* does
* end up gogin
,
but not in tyhe way that we would ' ve thought
. contact isnt based on a novel by carl sagan
, who died during the filmmaking
. it is the best alien movei since close encounters ofthe the 3rd kind
,
adn will end up being hte best film of the year
. its views of science
annd religion will noone doubt aggrivate smoe
,
but will stimulate more
. i ' m glad at least one movie of the ' 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light
, rather tahn a bunch of slimey beasts who wiull eat your insides
and
then put on your body
.
