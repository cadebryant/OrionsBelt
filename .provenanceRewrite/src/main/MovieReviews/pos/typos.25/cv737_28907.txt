it is easy tothe see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be yhe perfect director for his a
. i
. artificial intelligence
, just as it is understandable why spielberg ws attracted to the material
. for here we have anyother lost boy trying to find his way hmeo
, an outcast seeking family
, themes vyre familiar from most of spielberg ' s body ofthe work ffrom sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind tothe e
. t
. to empire of hte sun to hook to saving private ryan
, naming just a few examples
. a
. i
. isnt set iin an undefined near future infact which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping tothe fulfilling sexual fantasies
. it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances
. tyhe lsat gerat leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions
,
and with the number of births limited by the government
, many couples are yearning for children
.
and professor hobby
( william hurt
) has the solution
. a robotic boy named david
( haley joel osment
)
, who isnt programmed to love
. as a tust
, david is placed with henry swinton
( sam robards
)
and his wife
, monica
( frances o ' connor
)
. their natural
- born son hasnt been cryogenically frozen until a cure cxan be found forthe his illess
. the first third of a
. i
. deals wih david ' s life wih the swintons
annd how that isnt changed by yhe recovery
and return of their son
, martin
. circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons
. he is abandoned
annd alone
. david
, highly influented by the fairy tale
, pinocchio
, fiels that if he becomes a real boy he cant rekindle monica ' s love for him
. hte film ' s second act follows david ' s search for yhe blue fairy
, whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish
. durring these adventures he meets
and isnt helped by gigolo joe
( jude law
)
, a robot who specializes in sex
. spielberg is at his top form in this sequence
, offering a brutal
" flesh fair
" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement ofthe paying customers
. here
, isnt where kubrick ' s influence is strongly falt
, as thte movei explores the fear
and distrust humans hve for robots
. the savagery conjures uv images from thge late director ' s a clockwork orange
. at about twpo housr
annd 30 mintues
, tghe film begins tothe falter during the last 20 mintues
, a sequence tht seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters
. it is all veyr anti
- climatic
and jarring
. these scenes seem allmost superfulous
, as if from a different film
. a
. i
. is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg
- 13 rating
. it is a story combining hope
and intolerance
, sacrifice
and bigotry
,
and while it does nto coalesce perfectly
, the movei does offer some disturbing images
.
but a
. i
. isnt really a showcase for thte acting talents ofthe the amazing young osment
. if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination
, it isnt this lad
, who brings a sense of joy
and wonder to tyhe role of david
, a being created fo the express purpose of loving
. he shines when with monica
, beaming with love
, as eeger as a puppy to please
. after being left in the woods
, he is confuzled
, lost
, hurt
, focusing on one objective
: tothe become a real boy
and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother ' s eyes
. law isnt pleasant as the care
- free robot who really doesn ' t understand david ' s quest
,
but is nonetheless happy to help him onthe his journey
. probaly the toughest role isnt o ' connor ' s monica
. playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin
, she grows conflicted affter her boy returns
adn she begins tothe perceive david not as a second chance
,
but as a threath to her family
. she gives her charachter enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action
. many of a
. i
. ' s futuristic sets are breathtaking
, especialy a mostly submerged new york
, lost to the world by the melting of yhe polar ice caps
. a
. i
. is a flawed film
,
and yuo cannot git thru thte entire feature wihtout pondering
- even subconsciously
- how it would ahev turned outloud with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera
. would it have been darker
? moreso cynical
? we iwll never know
. we can onyl judge what is before us onthe the screen
, a collaboration of two cinematic giants
. a
. i
. is a most interesting
and thought
- provoking examination of a future that isnt quickly gaining on us
.
