ther ' s something baout ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors theese days
. stiller currenly has three projects in circulaton
,
adn what other actor can lay claim tothe that
? he ' s in
" there ' s something baout mary
,
" which i
* still
* haven ' t seen
.
and he ' s in the acerbic
" your friends
& neighbors
,
" palying a talkative
, sexually
- frustrated drama coach called jerri
. now there ' s
" permenant midnight
,
" infact which stiller plays anyother jerry
, this oen a heroin
- addicted television writter
, lsat name stahl
. there ' s allso something about this inudstry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into donig drug
- addiction pictures the minute they ' ve proved themselves commercially
. ewan mcgregor springs tothe mind who
, after successful turns in
" emma
"
and
" brassed off
,
" received greater respect
and admiration for his mind
- blowing realization as renton in danny boyle ' s transatlantic junk
- fest
,
" trainspotting
.
" tghe philosophy appears to be a simple noe
: if ytou want ' em to be taken seriously
, make ' em dont drugs
.
" permanent midnight
" is based on thge true life experiences of jerry stahl
, a successful hollywood writer who
, in the mid
- eighties
, had a
$ 5
, 000
- a
- week job churning outloud plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms
and a
$ 6
, 000
- a
- week heroin hebit
. a habit
, in stahl ' s own words
,
" the size of utah
.
" as stahl
, stiller contibutes a commanding performance
. unlike
" trainspotting
,
" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs
and the lows of heroin abuse
,
" permanant midnight
" instade focuses onthe the concept of drug addiction as maitenance
. one of the earliest observations infront the film is a casual reference to
" naked lunch
" author william s
. burroughs who
, when asked why he shoots up first thing in tyhe morning responds
,
" so i can shave
.
" stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins forthe the thrill of it all in
" permanent midnight
"
; it ' s so he can talk to his mother on the phone
, show up for work on time
, even pay his bills
. while yhe film itself occasionally wobbles around allong with stahl
, the writing
( adapted from stahl ' s autobiography by director david veloz
) is controlled
and pointed
.
" permanent midnight
" shows how stahl moved from new york to l
. a
. to
-
- again infact the auther ' s words
-
-
" escape the drug scene
"
( yeah
, right
)
; why he entered into a conveinent marriage with a british tv exec
( elizabeth hurley
, so impossibly polite you ' d swaer her single profanity was dubbed
)
;
and that he conceived a child in betwen his random hirings
and firings
. stahl narrates all thsi in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty
( norristown ' s pwn maria bello
) with whom he spended some rehab tiome
. janeane garofalo is wasted
-
-
and miscast
-
- as a heavily
- bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped
- up wordsmith
,
and that ' s stahl himself palying a jaded clinic counselor
. stiller
, unshaven
( burroughs take note
)
and witht lots of mascara around the eyes
, has stahl stumble thru the film looking like a train wreck
but
, to his credit
, never once pushes his pill
- popping
, needle
- jabbing performance over hte top
. the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see
" permanent midnight
"
; a dark
, comic
,
and strangely absorbing study of assisted living
.
