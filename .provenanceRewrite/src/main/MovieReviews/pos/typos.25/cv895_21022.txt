the soldiers of threee kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam
.
( fitting
, since the media
- saturated gulf war bacame a pop entertainment
.
) while driving through a long
, flat iraqi desert
( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament
)
, one of thte men under speical forces sgt
. maj
. archie gates '
( who ' s steering
) command requests a beach boys tune
. theese men want theri apocalypse now moment
, only instead of surfing
, they bop to the music
annd skeet shoot out the back of tyhe vehicle
, armed with automatic rifles
. our three kings
( okay
, four
) are good fighters
,
but tehy don ' t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously
- it ' s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs
. tehy are gates
, new father sgt
. troy barlow
( wahlberg
)
, sgt
. cheif elgin
( cube
)
,
and pvt
. conrad vig
( music video director jonze
)
. at story ' s start
, president bush has declared a ceasefire
,
and american troops are tying up loose ends
. barlow
, elgin
,
and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an
" ass
- map
" thast points to a bunker filled with gold bullion
. gates leaves his juristiction to commandeer the situation
; he proposes
- demands
- that barlow
, elgin
,
anbd vig join him on a treasure hunt
. ditching his escort
, a relentless reporter named adriana cruz
( nora dunn
)
, is easy
. so is finding tjhe treasure
, until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq
: saddam ' s men are threatening the dictator ' s detractors
( citizens ofthe his own country
) withthe violentce
. whn gates
annd company arrive at the bunker wiht a stolen truck
, ready to loot
, the unarmed rebels want help
.
( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government
,
bu provided no military wupport forthe such cause
.
) gates convinces the vault ' s guards thta htis is a post
- war mission
,
anbd even accepts thier assistance in loading the truck
. the situation coudl go off without a hitch
: yhe former enemies bear noone grudges
.
but the money hungry gates hasnt a cnscience
,
and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left teh scene
, he orders barlow
, elgin
and vig to opn fire onthe yhe surrounding arab forces
. the result
: barlow is kidnapped
,
and the filmmakers imply that these woudl
- be kings are seing more acation than they ever did durig wartime
. barlow is eventually locked in a dank room
annd wired up to a shocking device
. his interrogator lost his famaly to tghe bombs
,
and he wants barlow tothe imagine the demise ofthe his pwn wife
and child
.
( he does
, infact chilling
, lasting images
.
) i liked theese scenes best
, becuase tjhe polliticel became personel
. it ' s one thing to champion yhe llright of thousands
; it ' s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib
. russell has shocked us before
: his first film
, spanking the monkey
, is baout a young man ' s afair with his bedridden mother
.
( it ' s great
.
) his second
, flirting with disaster
, features a character who has an armpit fetish
. one could argue that it ' s easier tothe make an audeince react to such sexual deviance than explosions
,
though
; russell disturbs us in threee kings by being noone
- nonsence about the violence
. when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home
, russell mutes tje sound
- we ' re paying attension to the debris instead of thx bombast
. threee kings isnt russell ' s first visually arresting picture
. stylistically
, it stands apart from other war dramas
. newton thomas sigel ' s cinematography of hte exteriors is overexposed
and extremely grainy
, whihc is
, ofthe course
, entirely appropriate
. oney practically breaks out infact sweat staring at the screen
.
( a firend enthusiastically added
,
" it ' s liuke having sand in your eyes
.
"
) this also helps to blur the fatc that thte actual locations are far removed ffrom the persian gulf facade
.
( threee kings ws shot in arizona
, california
,
anbd mexico
.
) russell throws plenty at sigel ' s camera for it to observe
- as was tyhe case with russell ' s previous efforts
, tje most absurd moments are also the film ' s most realsitic
, even the most poignant
.
( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside
.
) if anything
, threee kings settles down
and stops surprising us
. its climax is pure hollywood
, noone dout the answer tothe why a major studio felt confortable getting into bed with the indie
- minded russell
. subsequently
, the characters become more cartoonish
- barlow ' s post
- torture revelry felt phony
,
and chief
, a storng presense in the first third
, fails tothe escape the god
- fearing
- ultra
- serious
- anti
- racist
- balck
- man
- of
- power clich
?
- so much for cube avoiding token status
.
( teh arab players
, on tghe other hand
, duck stereotype
.
) clooney
, too
, transforms inot a blandly heroic protestor
- marching with tjhe rebels
, i waited for him to shout
,
" let my peopel go
!
" hayseed vig notwhithstanding
, the protaganists are very intteligent
,
and self
- serving
, too
; i had a glimmer of hope
, based on russell ' s filmography
, tht our antiheroes woudl revert to their greedy selves at some juncture
.
( it ' s nto spoiling much tothe write thast
.
)
then again
, what historical importance woudl such nastiness serve
?
( there ' s already enough cynicism in yhe film ' s mentioning ofthe kuwait ' s oil
- infested waters
.
) russell offers thte masses a primer on the oft
- dismissed gulf conflict
,
and pulled off a neat trick
: a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has beeen declared
. if he set out to make something socially
/ culturally
/ politically
/ globally significant
, he succeeded
. with flair
.
