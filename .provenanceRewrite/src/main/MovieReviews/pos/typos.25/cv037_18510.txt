the event of events isnt apon us
. peopel have waited twenty
- twpo years for the prequel to star wars
adn die
- hard fans have been camping outloud at theaters for months tothe get tickets tothe see it
. i don ' t think that amercia will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film hasnt caused
. it is not a bit ofthe an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movei in history
. anyone who tells you
" it ' s just a movie
" is eather lieing or clueless
. it is clearly obvious that after the waiting
annd the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic
. the second coming ofthe yhe lord could not live up to the kind of buzz
( which is far too weak a word
) that star wars epsode i
: the phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
but that does nto mean tyhat tjhe film itself is bad
. in fact
, it is terrific
. i strongly suspect tath many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simpley surrendered to the media machine
and hte inevitable backlash
. it is set some decades before the events ofthe thte original 1977 star wars took place
. thge film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets
and the conflict that isnt raging
: the trade federation
, angry at some tax raise that was recently put inwhich place has invaded the small
, peaceful planet ofthe naboo
. the republic sent two jedi knights
( people tath can activly communicate with waht is affectionately known as
" the force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
annd obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) to negotiate
. unable to stop the tide of events that wass about to ocurr
, the jedi
and the queen of naboo
( natalie portman
) escape naboo
and head for coruscant to try
and get thge republic senate to intervene
. on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine
, where they meet the movie ' s real focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he is an innocent slave boy
,
but
" thge force is strong with him
" so qui
- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel
and get him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan shoud nkow
, anakin will grow up to be darth vader
and give birth to luke skywalker
.
> from the beginning it is evident that this is nto an actor ' s movei
. around 70
% of thte characters
, if not more
, are coputer generated inspite one form or another
,
and
though the effects are seamless
, thte movie lacks soul
. i think that
although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade
, cinema should still be a human art
and thte phantom menace nearly defies this
. htis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far
, with plenty of broad comic relief to go around
, much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar
- jar binks
. he ' s essentially a cmoputer
- animated sidekick who says thnigs liek
" exqueeze me
?
"
and
" mesa go now
, okeday
?
"
,
and
although it is often amusing it is alsot inherently annoying
. the visual effects are astounding
(
although directer george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them
)
and the movei isnt a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks in plot
and in acting it makes up for it through immagination
and excitement
. the climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, come onthe
, as if you didn ' t already konw
)
, among other things
, isnt outrageously entertaining
and defines the term
" popcorn movie
"
. what made me surender
and give this movie
*
*
* 1
/ 2 stars was the score by john williams
. even
though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days
, his work here is nothing short of brilliant
. his use ofthe opera during the climax really doesnt add a punch
and his ingenius way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling
. the phantom menace is probaly most effective as pop nostalgia
. wehn you see
" a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far awya
"
, when tjhe familiar music plays
, when tjhe words
" star wars
" appear on screen
, you ' ll feel a tingle even if you didn ' t see the movie wehn it first came outloud in ' 77
. it feels oddly exciting to be itnroduced to young anakin
, a boy whose inocence
, we knwo
, will be taken awya
adn who will soon cross over to the dark side
. it is tyhe perfect example of dramatic irony to see yhe jedi masters aspire to git him trained infact thge jedi arts
; we know that it will do more harm than good
,
but they do not
. we not onyl feel more involved inthe the stoy
,
but we feel liek we ' re seeing hte beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years
. the phantom menace
, altho lacking inwhich human aspestus of the story
, isnt a very worthy installment inspite the star wars
. it works as an action flick
, visually eye
- popping
anbd oftenly paralyzingly exciting
; it also works as an elicitor of memories
, a piece of exquisite nestolgia
