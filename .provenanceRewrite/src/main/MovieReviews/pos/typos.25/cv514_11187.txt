krippendorf ' s tribe is a formula comedy
. done poorly
, formulaic comedies might seem to signify tyhe downfall of american cinema
.
however
, every now
anbd
then
, noe emerges
, like krippendorf ' s tribe
, tht actulaly works
. profesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
)
, the renowned anthropologist
, is in trouble
. his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in newyorker guinea
.
howver
, he foudn
.
.
. nothing
. his wife has recently died
,
adn he hasnt spent the remainder ofthe the grant moeny in raising his three kids
: shelly
( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
)
and edmund
( carl michael lidner
)
. tongiht
, he is expeced tothe lecture on his newfound tribe
. rather than break yhe news
(
adn face the consequences of misusing his funds
)
, he invents a tribe
: tje shelmikedmu
( named after his kids
)
.
however
, one lie begets anohter as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof ofthe the shelmikedmu
,
but his research becomes a populare phenomenon
. soon
, professor krippendorf isnt caught uv in an elaborate ruse infront which he films mockumentary footage starring his childen as the shelmikedmu tribal members
. his efforts are hampered by the boasts ofthe an over
- eager colleague
, veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
,
and the intense scrutiny ofthe a rival anthropologist
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
. krippendorf ' s tribe does seem to require a little suspention of disbelief
. no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem tothe be shooted with multiple cameras
, or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes
. luckly
, as the film builds momentum
, that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by
.
though there ' s some mild humor infront the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe
, the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies
. the double meanings to many ofthe the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable
,
anbd tyhe comic timing required for some of the film ' s latter scenes is superb
. richard dreyfuss is terrific as tjhe hapless profesor who soon loses control of his own imagenary tribe
. jenna elfman ' s position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times
,
but she plays the part whith extreme affability
. even the kids
, who in films like htis tend to be a bit on teh precocious side
, are endearing
and humorous
. yes
, the film does veer occasionally into smoe rather lowbrow humor
,
but it has the best excuse ofthe all
: it ' s funny
. it may not go down as an all
- time classic
,
bu it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy
: plenty of laughs
.
