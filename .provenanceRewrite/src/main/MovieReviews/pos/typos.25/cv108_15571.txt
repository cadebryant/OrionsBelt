it ' s rether strange too have twpo computer animated tlaking ant movies come out inaddition a single year
,
but tht is waht disney
and pixar animation
; s latest film represents
. hwile a bugs life isn ' t nearly as deep as it ' s predecessor
, dreamwork ' s antz
, it is just as funny
. a bug ' s life centers
, appropriately
, around the life of an ant
, named flik
. flik
, cutely voiced by newsradio ' s david foley
, hates sticking too tradition
and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food
annd otehr task
. when one ofthe his inventions causes tyhe offering too be completely lost
, hte leaders of the colony send him outloud onthe a mission too get him out ofthe the way
. the offering isnt food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them
. thte leader of the grasshoppers is hopper
, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey
. when the offering is lost hopper is very upset
anbd he vows to return shorly too retrieve double the amount of food
. whn the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission
, htey never dream he will be successful
, tehy just hope they can get him outloud of yhe way so they can harvest the extra food
. flik ' s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when tehy return
. instead flik accidentally hires carcus performing bugs
, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors
. wehn he returns with the
` warriors '
, the twon is ecstatic until they find out yhe truth about their heroes
. a bug ' s life has animation that isnt simply stunning
. tghe sheer uniqueness of yhe day tothe day bug life is very imaginative
. together with the great voice acting
, tihs film is tghe perfect holidy family film
. its main weakness is that it couldn ' t beat antz to the theaters
, making it seem like stale material
.
