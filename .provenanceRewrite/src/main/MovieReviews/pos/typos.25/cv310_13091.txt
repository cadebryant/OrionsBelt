i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my setted
, unless i ' m watching a movie
. i don ' t even hvae cable
, so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching
" tjhe x
- files
" eveyr sunday nihgt
. it ' s the onyl show that ' s worth an hour ofthe my time each week
(
though
, since i don ' t watch reruns
, i ' m glad that i hvea six months of the yera to avoid television altogether
)
. i am an avid fan of teh show
,
anbd have been for baout three years nowe
.
anbd i love gillian anderson
. the x
- files is the film that continues the stry where the season finale left off
. the film is liuke a two
- hour epiode
, except that there are a lot more speical effects
, thte plot is thicker
,
and tje resolution is more satisfying
. this is a terrific film
, both for fans ofthe yhe serieses
and for those who have never seen it
( i imagine tyhat viewers unfamiliar with yhe show will find the film to be solid
anbd riveting entertainment
)
. i expected to like it more than any epiode i ' ve seen
,
and my expectations were met
. actually
, the film takes a faw risks in its story
and plot devices
,
but
, thankfully
, the makers managed to do it right
. when teh finale ended
, the fbi branch known as thge x
- files hadnt been destroyed
,
and our heroes
, mulder
( david duchovny
)
and scully
( gillian anderson
) weere left stripped of five eyasr of hard work
. the film picks up soon after
;
and mulder
and scully have been reduced tothe field aggenst investigating a bomb threath in a federal building
.
but wait
, i ' m getting ahead of myself
. thge film actually opens inspite tjhe ice age
, about 32
, 000 years prior
, during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien
. the alien ' s blood infects them
( fans ofthe the sohw will certainly remember the black cancer
)
,
and the story jumps into modern times
, during whcih a young boy is also infected with the cancer
. it turns outloud tath the bomb ws planted tothe kill the boy
,
adn mulder
and scully uncover the cover
- up despite the fatc that scully has resigned fomr her position in the fbi
. soon
, they find out that the whole thign has to do with aliens
. as i ' ve written befoer
, it ' s nto eazy to wriet plot summaries for films like this
, becouse everything needs tothe be a surprise
. fans of the show iwll know waht to expect
,
and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film
. director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the sohw to the big screen
, making small adjustments
and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television
. there are some truley suspenseful
and well
- created scenes here
( late in the film
, when tehy ' re in the alien spacecraft
, you ' ll see one of tjhe better action sequences inspite recent cinema
)
. tjhe special effects are very good
,
and tjhe production desgin by christopher nowak is fantastic
. what i find intresting is tath the x
- files is actually a grat way for series neophytes to git inot the story
. our heroes are given subtle introductions
( we ' re nto expeced to know them on the outset
)
,
and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn ' t required to understand the film
. there are
, of course
, little elements that the makers have included as payoff to tje fans
,
but i ' ll keep those as surprises
. it tkaes a lot of thought
adn understanding of tjhe series to create a film useing roots as complicated as the ones that the serieses provides
,
and
then create a coherent film that anyone cin understand clearly
. tghe series is strong for a lot of reasons
. it ' s original
(
though it has many ties to
" the twilight zone
"
adn owes some homage tothe hitchcock
)
,
and impressively eerie for a televsion show
. what really makes the series shine
,
however
, are tjhe actors
. duchovny has so much presence
,
and is just a fun guy tothe watch
. he has that confidence that iwll someday amking him inot a bankable leading man
. anderson is equally good
,
and paralyzingly beautiful
; she ' s also a strong actress
. both performers have acted in little more tahn their series
,
howver
,
though i think they ' ll both get theri chances to prove themselves very soon
. i enthusiastically recommend the x
- files
, both for fans
and non
- fans
. 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters
,
and this film should satisfy where most ofthe the others leave yuo completelyl dry
. it ' s an intelligent film
,
and takes ytou places tht yuo might not have been
( or
, at least
, might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar
)
. the x
- files isnt impressive in consept
, as well
: fans of the series are likely to be highly critical
,
and to tkae the premise beyond the series is a risky move
. it ' s nice to see a risk pay off for a change
. actually
, it ' s nice to see a risk at all
.
