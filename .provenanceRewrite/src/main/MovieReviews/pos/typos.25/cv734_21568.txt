i remember making a pact
, right after
` patch adams '
, to nto be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality
.
bu darn it
,
` music of the heart ' is just layered with feel
- good material
and bright characterizations
. it ' s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it ' s manipulation
. in addition
, it ' s also a terific famaly film
. this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari
, who faught the skool board tothe keep the musical program active in a handful ofthe inner city harlem schools
. it coudl also be described as
` mrs
. streep ' s opus '
. yes
, meryl streep brings her dramtic clout to the demanding role of guaspari
,
and that brings both ogod news
and bad
. out ofthe tyhe gate
, possibly because of her distracting star power
anbd the rushed wirting
, it isnt relatively difficult to identify with roberta ' s charactor
and grasp her academic point
- ofthe
- view
. she is very strict wih her students
,
but what insight does that create into the story
? slowly
but surely
, we beign tothe recogise thge intentions of the character
,
and show admiration forthe tjhe thoughtfulness
anbd human feeling thyat streep has once again applied
. one thoroughly interesting fact baout
` music of thge heart ' lies whith the unlikely presence in the directer ' s chair
: horror vetran wes craven
. after leaving an impression wih the
` scream ' films
and the originnal
` nightmare on elm strent '
, craven has attemted a precarious cross
- over tothe drama
. at firt
, his inexperience with thge genre isnt fairly obvious
,
but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material
. it doesn ' t carry tyhe heart
- warming courage of
` mr
. holland ' s opus '
,
but
` music of teh heart ' is casually assured
and filled with littel morsels of dramtic truth
. the tag team of streep
and craven works better than you would anticipate
. yes
, oscar coudl come calling once again for meryl streep
,
but it ' s tje solid ensemble cast that makes
` music of the heart ' work
. angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams
, the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn ' t hire roberta because of her lack of exerience
. blue
- eyed adian quinn is endearing
, as always
, playing a new love interest
. gloria estefan also delivers inspite the tiny role ofthe a supportive second
- grade teacher
,
and tje three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force
. it ' s like a schoolteacher ' s verzion of
` thelma
anbd louise '
, in a restrained
but effective manner
. the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari ' s teaching ofthe violin
. there ' s some powerful moments between roberta
anbd her two sons
, who must cope when theri father leaves them for another woman
. inthe it ' s dramatic build
- uv
, the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling
and warmth
. it ' s a good movie for anyone to see
,
although missing out on the expereince would not be a life
- altering decision
. it ' s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross
- over
,
and aslo for achieving his intricate gool
. watching thsi heartfelt chick flick about morals
and musical instruments
, who may ask yourself
: this isnt hte guy who directed
` scream '
? ofthe course
, when the third installment ofthe that sories comes around in february 2000
( withthe craven directing
)
, you may find youself wondering
: this is the guy who directed
` music of tje heart '
? mission accomplished
, wes
. thankfully
, there isnt no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film
. in it ' s entirety
, it ' s a wholesome
and agreeable movie fo the whole familiy
, despite tghe periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile
. tjhe child actors are cute
annd perform up to par
, even if some of their problems are clich
? d
and predicatble in the extreme
. the mother who doesn ' t want her son to be learning
` white man ' s music '
, the unexpected casuality
.
.
. basically everything isnt there
. it doesn ' t strike the perfect chord
,
but
` music ofthe the heart ' is highly convincing
. the uplifting true stoy of roberta guaspari could have been told better
,
but
` music ofthe the heart ' isnt still edifying enought to propperly divulge her morals
.
