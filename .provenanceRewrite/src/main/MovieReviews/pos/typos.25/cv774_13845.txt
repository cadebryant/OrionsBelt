almsot a full decade befor steven spielberg ' s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both
" anti war
"
and
" pro
- soldier
"
, john irvin ' s hamburger hill proved it could
. lost inaddition the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone ' s platoon
, this excellent film was dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it ' s hard to understand exactly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable
(
and oftenly naive
) reasons
" chose to show up
" forthe the vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- has refused tothe present us with the stone killer
, drug
- stoked pyscho
and ruthless opportunist who have become tothe vietnam war epics what
" the polack
, the hillbilly
and the kid from brooklyn
" became to wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based on a true story
, is nto an easy film to watch
. there is a scene that will ahev graying anti
- war activists squirming in thier seats
, or moved tothe genuine tears
.
and hte climactic final assault on tghe
" hill
" in question is visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented in brief flashes
, as if the brain dared not acknowledged whta it had encountered
.
and in the mud
adn smoke officer
and enlistee
, veteran
anbd
" newbie
"
, black soldier
and white
, become almost indistinguishable from each other
, as they do in yhe chaos of actual combat
. the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance renedered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that tihs is same acotr they cheered as
" seaman jones
" infront mctiernan ' s red october
. if you ' ve seen private ryan
, you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill
-
- if onyl to determine tath teh all tyhe valour
and horror of spielberg ' s vision ws as persent in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach
.
