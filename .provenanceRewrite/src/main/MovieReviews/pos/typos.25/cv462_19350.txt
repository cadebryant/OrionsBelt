- writen
, produced by
: stanley kubrick inspired by
:
" traumnovelle
" by
: arthur schnitzer this isnt an interesting film
. i must first off state
, thta yuo musn ' t believe any of the rumors ofthe teh film
. cruise is not a cross dresser
, kidman doesn ' t shoot heroin
,
and there ' s not any scene between hte two that woudl suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist
. the look of yhe film is to suggest thyat it follows thte translation of the inspired book from the film was written
. the translation
,
" dream novel
,
" makes you thing that the film shouldnt ahev been titled dream film
. there isnt a noticable amount ofthe graininess to the film
. rather than complain baout it as some may
and already have
, see it as a style of shooting
. i would gather tath kubrick got onthe anohter lighting kick shooting this
and shot withthe as much naturual light as he could
. this
and hte film looks liuke it was pushed another twpo stops to add more grain
and brighten it slightly
. as an auteur
and stickler fo details
, kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one
. the film looks great
,
bu there are a good deal of bloopers
/ flubs that occur
. you see lots of boom shots
( in reflection
)
and yuo see the camera at least twice
. 16 monthes fo thsi
? wow
. reflection is the biggest killer for this film
. their apartment
and almost everything inaddition the film casts reflections
and the crew cxan be seen inthe these
, some quite glaringly
. oen more topic ofthe heated dicussion
: i saw the
" austin powers
" verzion
,
and tothe be perfectly frank
, unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be
, you ' ll probably not see them
. two girls standing next tothe each otehr look a little suspicious
,
but i cant wait forthe the unrated verzion on video to see it the way it ' s supposed tothe be

,
and tyhe woman that warned him hasnt died
. i ' m trying to sive a bit of the film here
, it ' s worth sitting through to get to this point
. htis is only about 100 minutes at this point
. htis is a stange film
, because despite the events tht occur
, thte film has a strong familiy message behind it
. it iwll be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film
. it ' s got sex in it
, it has nudity
, drugs
,
and many more immoralistic values
.
but they all serve to show why they are bad iin one ' s life
. i recommend htis film highly on many merits
. cruise
and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene
,
and the secrecy taht shrouded hte film should hopefully be appaent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself
.
