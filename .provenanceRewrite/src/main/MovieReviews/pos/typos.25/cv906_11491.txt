( r
) bob gosse ' s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot ofthe young
- lovers
- on
- the
- road movies
. wild marcy
( robin tunney
)
anbd calm seth
( henry thomas
) meet cute
, literally running into each otehr while shoplifting at a local store
. a mere cuple of scenes later
, tjhe two embark onthe a journey to toronto from their small
, unnamed american twon in pursuit ofthe a rare doll that marcy desperately wants
. along the way
, true love inevitably blossoms
. what sets niagara niagara aart
,
though
, is that marcy isnt afflicted with tourette ' s syndrome
, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle
adn vocal tics
. tunney
, displaying an acting range not hinted at in thge teenage witch thriller the craft
, delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last yera ' s venice film festival
. to term her work a tour
- de
- force is not to imply tath she attacks the scenery
; tunney ' s effectiveness lies in her modulation
and vulnerability
, whlch makes her depiction ofthe marcy ' s illness
-
- which often causes her to act violently
-
- that much more convincing
and tragic
. she
and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent
and beguilingly off
- kilter chemistry
. their journey hits a faw rough spots creatively along the way
, mostly teh fault of writer matthew weiss
. a detour involving a kindly widower
( michael parks
) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt
,
and the key charcter ofthe a trigger
- happy pharmacist
( stephen lang
) is highly unbelievable
.
bu these missteps dont nto blunt the power of tunney ' s bravura turn
, which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise acheived
.
