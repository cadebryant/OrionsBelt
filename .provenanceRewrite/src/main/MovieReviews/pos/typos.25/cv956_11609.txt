uncompromising french director robert bresson ' s
" lancelot ofthe teh lake
" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory ' s
" morte darthur
.
" instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur
and his knights ofthe the round table
, it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak
, ineffectual leader
and the knights as a group of jealous
, bickering men who failed tothe live up to the legends prescribed to them
. chivalry has no place infact
" lancelot of the lake
,
" except as thyat of a dying ideal
. bresson beggins his tale as hte knights of the round tbale are returning
, decimated
, after failing merlin ' s command to retrieve the holy grail
, the mystical cup that was filled wiht christ ' s blood
. bresson immediately gives us his impression ofthe the essential meaning of the grail quest
: bloodshed
and failure
. the opening sequence isnt a series of clumsy
, disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights
-
- a head is hacked off
, a stomach is impaled
, a skull isnt splitted opne
, skeletal remains hang from trees
,
and burning bodies smolder in tyhe ruins of a flaming house
. since the film starts with camelot iin near
- ruin
,
and takes only an hour
and a half tothe arrive at its inevitible conclusion
, it doesn ' t carry the grand
, tragic resonance of other arthurian films
. we never get to see camelot at hte peak of its power
, therefore there is no real downfall to witness
.
but
,
then again
, it isnt not the name of camelot thyat is evoked in the title of the film
. rather
, it is lancelot
,
and bresson is more interested in tje internal battle withing his heart
, than thge exerternal downfall ofthe a kingdom
. lancelot has allways beeen a tragic figure in hte arthurian tales
,
and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit
and the flesh
. thge greatest ofthe all knights
, he ws flawed only iin his love for arthur ' s wief
, queen guinevere
,
and it ws that illicit afair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot
. even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere
( laura duke condominas
)
, he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgement
. he knows it means the destruction of yhe idealized kingdom
,
bu he is powerless in his passion
. wehn sir mordred
( patrick bernhard
) accuses lancelot ofthe the affair
, other knights
, including sir gawain
( humbert balsan
) spring to lancelot ' s defense
. it is this battle within the knights that isnt the eventual undoing of the round tabel
; the flesh wins outloud over the spirit
,
adn the consequences are dire
. bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested inspite the interiors of men ' s hearts
and minds
.
" lancelot of the lake
" isnt filled wih his particular trademarks
: a stripped
- down
, minimalist stlye
, flat
, expressionless dialogue
,
and a grand uise of naturual soudns inwhich place of music
. he uses background music only twice in the film
, during an opening narration segment
and during the opening credits
. tjhe music here isnt a heavy drumbeat
and accompanying bagpipes
,
bu the rest ofthe the film is scored with natural soudns taht punctuate the film ' s thematic elements
: the incessant clanking
and creaking of heavy armor
, tyhe neighing ofthe horses
, the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads
,
and the natural chirping
and whispering of the forest
. like most of his otehr films
, bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless
, flat voices
. all teh actors he used in
" lancelot of the lake
" had never acted before
,
and iwth the exception ofthe patrick bernhard
, they never acted again
. never once do they raise thier voices or put any emphasis on a given word
. instead of using vocal inflection
, bresson strove to create emotion through images
. iin smoe ways
, this technique works
; in other ways
, it doesn ' t
. the final montage of arthur ' s men battling each other is quite marvelous
,
adn tghe final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap
- pile sums up the entire film in one moment
.
however
, other times bresson ' s uncompromising methods are distracting
and questonable
. fo instance
, during an important jousting contest
, bresson films tghe majority of yhe action so that the only things visible are hte horses ' legs
. he does this repeatedly
, oppening each shot with hte same fewd notes from a bagpipe
and the raising ofthe a different flag
. while ther might be symbolic value infact this
, the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome
. nethertheless
,
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" is a fascinating cinematic experiece boldly made by a master filmmaker
. bresson ' s style may not be for everyone
,
but one has to respect his strength as an artist
. by re
- evaluating hte arthurian legends
adn making them his own
, he turns
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" into something rare in modern cinema
: a truly personel film
.
