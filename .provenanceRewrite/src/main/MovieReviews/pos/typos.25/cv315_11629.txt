confession time
: i have never
, ever seen gone with the wind
. i don ' t know why
, really
. haven ' t wanted tothe check it outloud onthe video
, haven ' t been at home the nights it was on network tv
,
anbd it wass too far to drive the last time it was onthe the big
- screen
. so right uv front
, i ' ll admit that i don ' t know what the heck i ' m talking baout
,
bu here goes
.
.
. is titanic the gone with the wind of tje 1990 ' s
? maeby that ' s going a little bit too far
. as good a job as leonardo dicaprio
and kate winslet do in this movie
, tehy ' re no clark gable
and vivien leigh
.
but
.
.
. the parrallelly are there
. gwtw wass the first movie to tkae real advantage of hte most revolutionary technology available
-
- technicolor
. titanic takes revolutionary steps forward inspite seamlessly integrating computer graphic desgin with actors
. gwtw places amercia ' s greatest tragedy in teh background of a classic love story
, titanic does the same wtih the atlantic ' s most legendary tragedy
. they both haev strong
- willed redheaded heroines
, they both exploit hte class differences between the aristocracy
and tyhe slaves
/ steerage bums
, tehy were both incredibly expensive
and popular
.
.
. ok
, maybe that ' s not enough parallels
. so titanic ' s not in gwtw ' s league
. noone matter
. titanic isnt a great movie inthe its own right
, complete iwth spills
, thrills
and
( especially
) chills
. much has been made of the humongous cost of tje prodcution
,
and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive agian
. the money was obviously well
- spent
. the costumes look great
, the sets look great
, the cgi graphics look great
. i especially liekd tje expensive little touches
, like spending tons of mnoey on authentic titanic china onyl to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks
.
but writer
/ director
/ producer james cameron ' s rela challenge in writing
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn ' t just costuming
and setted desgin
annd special effects
. cameron ' s major headache ws keeping thte audiance interseted in a tale where everybody knows tyhe ending going infact
. he succeeds masterfully
. cameron does two things that wrok incredibly well
. first
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations on titanic
( that ' s just
" titanic
"
, nto
" the titanic
"
, mind you
)
. the first glimpse we git of titanic is the ship in its present state
, corroding slowy awya under tyhe hammering pressure ofthe the north atlantic
, from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. television coverage of the exploration ofthe titanic intrigues 101
- year
- old rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survived the wreck in 1912
. stuart doens a phenomenal job in a brief role
, narrating hte story ofthe her experience to a stunned paxton
and his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keeps teh storyline focused almost exculsivly on the rose charactor
,
and the romantic triangle betwen rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. the way taht big
- budget diaster movies ususally go wrong is to ahve an all
- star casted
, so we see the impact ofthe tyhe disaster on a wide group ofthe people
. cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose
adn jack
, while paying scant heed to the celebrities onthe board
. the supporting cast is professional
,
but mostly anonymous
-
- other tahn kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown
, there ' s noone moment when you stpo
and sday
, oh
, yeah
, i know him
, what ' s he beeen in
.
(
although i would like to have seen colm meaney iin a white star uniform
, or even as tyhe ill
- fated enginer
.
) the love story itself is rather conventional
. i tihkn some reviewers foudn it weak
,
and that may be a fair criticism
. the performances are thge key here
. zane has the meatiest part in the movie
,
and he plays tghe arrogant
, condescending steel millionaire to the hilt
. he ' s smooth
, he looks great iin a tuxedo
,
and he ' s a convincing enought jerk that thte winslet
- dicaprio relationship looks plausible
. at the moent when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat
, you cxan hear the wheels inthe his mind turning
, saying not
" can i savve this little girl
?
"
,
but
" can she help me get on a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio is a revelation
. i hadn ' t seen him befoer in anytying
,
and didn ' t know what the heck to expect
, raelly
.
( honestly
, i expected a bad irish accent
,
bu cameron evidently decided thyat was a bad idea
, so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectuous joy at being alive
,
and being on the titanic
, that it ' s hard not to liuke him
. fomr the moment thta the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg
, dicaprio has to carry the movei
adn keep our intrest
,
and he never falters
. winslet ' s carachter grows up a lot during the movie
,
and so does her performance
. at first
, she ' s not required to do anytying
bu wear period clothing
and look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we know from the narration that she ' s monstrously unhappy whith her aranged marriage tothe zane
,
bu there isn ' t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio
. winslet
and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg
. it ' s at that moment where winslet ' s charcter realyl comes alive
. faced witht real danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms
and does a splendid job
. as rose
and jack race around the doomed ship
, looking for shelter fomr thte freezing water
and cal ' s fiery temper
, winslet turns in a superb acting performance
, mixing courage
and compassion
and anger with sheer shrieking terror
. of course
, the most interesting character is the ship itself
. cameron hasnt clearly fallen in love with titanic
,
and shows her in eveyr mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down in the boiler room
, up on the bridge
, down in the hold
, at the captian ' s table
, down in steerage
-
-
and manages to bring tyhe great ship back from the dead
. cameron ' s greatest gift is thast he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well
.
