well i ' ll be damned
, wqat a most exelent surprise
. nto to be confused with the campy
anbd far inferior 1988 remake starring ex
- porn star traci lords
, thsi mroe recent attempt at remaking the 1950 ' s drive
- in schlockfest nto of tihs earth is a real gem
adn was quite possibly the best sci
- fi flick ofthe 1995
. once again
, b
- movei king roger corman is behind this effort
( he directed the orginal
)
but this tiem he appears only inaddition tyhe role of executive producer
. the rest ofthe the crew
and cast are relative unknowns
. it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video inwhich most ocuntries
, because it ' s an absolute must
- see for sci
- fi fans
adn a treat fo anyone who enjoys decently acted
adn written thrillers with a kooky bent
. the plot in brief
. paul johnson
( michael york
) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who
,
though needing to kill people tothe live
, is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons
. his race isnt dieing of a mysterious blood desease
anbd he desperately is trying to find a cure
, the key ofthe which lies iin the blood of humans
. he visits
anbd soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr
. rochelle
, whom he hypnotises into doing secret reasearch on his behalf
. he alsot has the doctor convince smart
and sexy nurse amanda
( elizabeth barondes
) tothe move in withthe johnson as his private nurse so as tothe give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires
.
bu before long
, amanda
annd johnson ' s sleazy chauffeur release that johnson isnt a lot more thna just eccentric
. i must admit
, my frist glimpse of the video cover for not of htis earth was not encouraing
. brittish acotr michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past fewd decades
, a far cry from the quality fare ofthe his yuonger days such as caberat
( 1972
)
.
bu his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding
. tyhe weird twitches
and bizarre modes of sprech
, the dapper clothes
and cool spectacles
, tghe unexpected pathos which he invests in his character
. york is by turns hillarious
, menacing
and tragic
. htis isnt a tour
- de
- force
and quite simply tjhe best performence i ' ve seen from him
.
and while obviously made on a modest budget
, the film boasts enormous strengths
. the casting isnt spot on
, the acting isnt terrific
and tyhe script is intelligent
, witty
and consistently engaging
, cleverly updating the original
. the balance of horror
annd humour is just about perfect
, a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988
. the film doesn ' t drag for a second ofthe its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing
and the sure hand ofthe little
- known director terrance h
. winkless
.
and it doesn ' t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy
- thsi is schlock affter all
, even if it is high class schlock
. in fact my onyl criticism ofthe the film is that things git a tad weak towards the end
. tighter direction could have given yhe climax more urgency
adn a few of the cahracters act rather illogically given their life
- threatening situation
.
but these are minor complaints
. just see it
. not of this earth is one of tyhe biggest sci
- fi surprises in years
.
and michael york
: in noe cool swoop you ' ve made yourself a b
- movei legend
, dude
