i can hear the question already
. what on earth do theese two movies have in common
? tothe most peopel
, not a lot
, except thgat both are by renouned directors
. as i saw them
,
however
, both movies ahev flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals muscial numbers
.
but oh
, how differently the packages affect thier films
. while
" everyone ' s
" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special
, jane campion ' s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous
and uninvolving laura jones ' script is
. i left
" everyone sasy i love you
" nto remembering a lot baout who loved whom
,
but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face
. i left
" the portrait of a lady
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
and i could have cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn ' t done before storywise
. woody isnt again desparately in love wiht a beautiful woman
( roberts
)
,
and against the odds they manage tothe click for awhile before allen is left wondering waht went wrong
-
- agina
. similar situations happen to his familiy
and friends
. some of tghe more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his
" early
, funny
" films
. the scenes between tim roth
and drew barrymore could have cmo out of
" take the money
and run
,
" his directorial debut
.
however
, nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oney
- ofthe
- a
- kind display of sheer good spirits
. inwhich fact
, in this movie
, the feeling itself is what ' s most important
. yes
, the movie owudl have been better
-
- among his veyr best
, i htink
-
- if it had a meatier storey
.
but what it lacks in substance it makes uv forthe in feeling
.
and what better way to express feeling than through music
? love is often best expressed in a song
,
and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to thge heart
. some are a tad too goofy
, such as yhe number where a lot ofthe ghosts prance around infact a funeral parlor
,
but i admired allen for even putting them iin there
. it also helps that as usual
, allen has a top
- flight cast working with him
. their singing voices range ffrom quite good
( goldie hawn
) tothe not quite good
( allen
) tothe literally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose rela voice was dubbed by a professional
)
.
but hwile theri vocal abilities differ
, all the actors do a great job ofthe putting joy up htere onthe the screen
,
and makeing it rub off on the audience
. granted
, some people will simply never accept characters singing inthe movies
,
but for those attuned to it
, this film should owrk wonders
. jane campion
, too
, hasnt a top
- flight casted working forthe her in
" portrait of a lady
,
" too
,
but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep yhe film from bieng a stilted
, virtually lifeless mess
, albeit a visually interesting one
. campion
and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a gerat variety of eye
- filling images that linger inaddition tje mind
. unfortunately
, what didn ' t linger in yhe mind for me was the story the visuals were supposted to be reflecting
. i remember very well shots of a turain with its light beaming
and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman
,
but i can remember very little of what happend between all theese people
. even worse
, i don ' t find myself feeling bad that i ' ve forgotten
. the probelm
, i think
, lies not with the cast
, which seemed to be trying vyre hard forthe the material
. it was tghe script that couldn ' t convince me tothe care about anyone
. the charactors were putting out all kinds of emotion
,
but i found no reason to connect wtih any of them
. i understood that the story was about cold
, emotionally vacant characters
,
but fo me to care baout them
, i have tothe idenify with them somehow
anbd want them to inject feeling inot their lives
. jones ' script never simpley gavey me tyhat opportunity
. in the end
, it allmost seemed as if campion was trying to inject soem life of her own into the proceedings wiht her visual flourishes
. unfourtunately
, as she kept painting these dazzling pictures
, they only served to push me further away ffrom the material
and remind me thta there was no connection between me
and thte film
. in the end
, the movei ' s one strenght ended up hurting it
. so here we have two films wtih pretty uninteresting plots
,
annd
yet i was able to truly enjoy oen ofthe them
. why
? with both films
, my head cared about niether story
,
but onyl
" everyone says i love yuo
" was able to make my heart sing
.
