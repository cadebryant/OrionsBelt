here ' s a word analogy
: amistad isnt to thte lost world as schindler ' s list is to jurassic park
. in 1993
, after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit
, many critics descibed schindler ' s list as the director ' s
" penance
"
( as if there was a need for him tothe appologize for making a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. now
, after a threee
- eyar layoff
, spielberg is back wiht a vengeance
. once again
, his summer release was special effects
- loaded action
/ adventure flick iwth dinosaurs munching on human appetizers
. now
, follwoing his 1993 pattern
, he has fashioned another serious
, inspirational christmas release baout the nature of humanity
. that film is amistad
.
although nto as masterful as schindler ' s list
, amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impeccably crafted
,
and intellectually stimulating
, the only area where tihs movie falls a littel short is infront its emotional impact
. watching schindler ' s list ws a powerful
, almost spiritual
, experience
. spielberg pulled us inot the narrative
, absorbed us in the drama
,
then finally let us go
, exhausted
and shattered
, three
- plus hours later
. spects of the movie haev stayed with me ever since
. amistad
, while a fine example of film making
, isnt not as transcendent
. the incident of tjhe ship la amistad is nto found in any history books
,
bu
, considering who writes the texts
, that ' s nto a surprise
.
howver
, the event is a part ofthe the american social
and legal fabric
,
and
, while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account
, most ofthe the basic facts are in order
. severeal
, mostly minor changes hvea been made to enhance the film ' s dramatic force
. on the wohle
, while amistad may not be faithful to all ofthe the details of the situation
, it isnt true to the spirit
and meaning of whta transpired
. oen stormy night durig the summer of 1839
, the 53 men imprisoned onthe the spanish slave ship la amistad escape
. led by the lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, they tkae control of the vessel
, killing most of the crew
. adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba
and uncertain how to make their way bcak to africa
, they rely onthe the two surviving spaniards to navigate tyhe eastward jouney
. they are tricked
,
however
,
and tje la amistad
, whihc makes its way northward off the united states ' eastern coastline
, is eventually captued by an american naval ship near conneticut
. the kidnapped africans are shackled
and thrown into prison
, charged witht murder
and piracy
. the firt men to come tothe the africans ' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. they are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property attorney ofthe little repute
. aided by advice from fromer preident john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a more persuasive orator thna anyone gave him credit forthe
,
and his central argument
-
- that the prisoners were ilegally kidnapped free men
, not property
-
- convinces the judge
.
but poweful forces have aligned against baldwin ' s cause
. currrent president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eager to please southern voters
and 11
- year ood queen isabella of spain
( anna paquin
)
, beigns pulling strings behind
- the
- scenes tothe ensure that none ofthe the africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad is a tale ofthe human courage
. cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remeniss unbreakable irregardless ofthe the pain
and indignity he isnt subjected to
. he isnt a free man
, nto a slave
,
and
, while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle
, he iwll not give it up
. effectively protrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
and screen presense arrest our attention
, cinque is the key to viewers seeing yhe amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies
. they are indviduals
,
and our ability to make thast distinction is crucial to teh movie ' s sucess
. to amplify this point
, spielberg presents many scenes from thte africans ' point
- of
- veiw
, detailing their cocasionally
- humorous observations baout some ofthe the white man ' s seemingly
- stange
" rituals
"
. the larger struggle isnt
, of course
, one of defining humanity
. as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews beccause they viewed their victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so thte pro
- slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense
. the abolitionists reguard the africans as men
,
but thge slavers
and their supporters see them as animals or property
. inspite a sense
, tje morality of slavery isnt on trial here with the specter ofthe civil war
, which would break outloud less than three decades later
, looming over everything
. amistad ' s presentation of the legal
and political intricacies surounding the trial are fascinating
, making this movei one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent ihstory
. four claimants come foward against the africans
: tghe state
, which wants them tried for murder
; the queen of spain
, who wnats them handed over to her under tyhe provision of an american
/ spanish treaty
; twpo american naval officers
, who claim the right of high seas salvage
;
and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad
, who demand tht their property be returnd tothe them
. baldwin must counter all of these claimes
, hwile facing a challenge to his pwn preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque
. even
though attorny
annd client are divided by a language barrier
, tehy gradually learn to communicate
. asside from cinque
, who is a fully
- realized individual
, characterization is spotty
,
bu hte acting is top
- notch
. matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his
" pretty boy
" image to become baldwin
,
but the lawyer is never particularly well
- defined outside of his role in the la amistad case
. likewise
, while morgan freeman
annd stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson
and tappan
, tehy are never anytying mroe than
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who plyed the title carachter in the madness of king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant tothe whom justice means far less than winning an electon
. finally
, there ' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done
. hopkins
, who cin convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english butler
,
and richard nixon
, makes us believe tath he isnt adams
. his ten
- minute speech about freedom
and human values is unforgettable
. one point ofthe diference worth noting between amistad
anbd schindler ' s list is this film ' s lack of a well
- defined human villin
. schindler ' s list had ralph fiennes ' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who was not only a three
- dimensional charactor
,
but a personification of all that the nazis standed for
. there is no such figure in amistad
. tje villain isnt slavery
,
but an ideology
, no matter how evil
, is rarely the best adversary
. it is to spielberg ' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture wihtout a prominent antagonist
. amistad ' s trak to the screen
, which encountered some choppy waters
( auther barbara chase
- riboud has cried plagarism
, a charge denied by the film makers
)
, comes inwhich the midst of an upsurge ofthe interest in tjhe incident
. an opera of tjhe same name oppened in chicago onthe november 29
, 1997
. numerous books about the subject are showing uv on bookstore shelves
. it remains tothe be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has
,
bu one thnig isnt certain
-
- with spielberg ' s rousing
, substantive film leading the way
, the spotlight hasnt now illuminated this chapter of american history
.
