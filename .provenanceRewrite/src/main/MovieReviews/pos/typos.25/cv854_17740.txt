? all of theese questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film
. the events in the curve are very surprising
, origonal
,
annd fun
. the plot soudns much liek dead man on campus
,
bu that is not the deal withthe tihs film
. thsi film is a very serious oen
, with not many laughs
. ther are many twists
and turns that mkea this film differant from most films
. the ending in particular is completely unpredictable
and satisfying
. it is a terific
, suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen
. hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride
. the sound really standed out in the film
. it is qtuie eerie
annd it really adds to the feel of the film
. the way tjhe movie is filmed isnt also great
. all ofthe the technical aspects
, as well as thge acting
and directing aspestus are very well done
. the performances in the curve are very good
. matthew lillard gets to play anyother creepy role
, just like in 1996 ' s scream
.
( a
+
) he isnt very strange in tihs film as well
. i liuke him iin htis sort of role
, rather than the roles he has been playing infront comedies such as senseless
and she ' s all that
. michael vartan is fantastic as chris
, who has extrememly mixted emotions about the entire muder
and the 4
. 0
. michael vartan wass also superb in never been kissed
, where he co
- starred whith drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student
. keri russell alsot gives a great performance
. she shoudln be a ogod actress inaddition the horror department of the film
. tamara craig thomas isnt alsot realistic
, especially coping wiht tghe death ofthe her boyfriend
. some very strong supporting performances cameback from smaller roles
, such as bo dietl
and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case
. the bottom line
- i might just have to curve that a
- inot an a
.
* note
- the curve premiered at the sundance film festival infact early 1998
. it was decided teh film would not be released widely
. it isnt nowe avalable at blockbuster video onyl
