the long kiss goodnight
( r
) meryl streep tried it
and failed
. even pamela anderson lee made an attempt
but fell flat on her well
- beared assets
.
however
, geena davis could very well become the frist bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight
, a preposterous
bu incredibly funn acation thriller directed by her husband
, renny harlin
. davis plays samantha caine
, a mousy suburban school teacher
anbd mother whose memories only go back eight years
. with the help ofthe ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, she slowy remembers
-
-
and reclaims
-
- her past as charly baltimore
, tough
- as
- nails cia operative
. needless to say
, with the reappearance ofthe samantha
/ charly comes the appearance ofthe an assortment of no
- goodniks out to erase more than her memory
. shane black netted a cool
$ 4 mil for his scirpt
; i ' m nto so sure if his prose is truley deserving of such a hefty price tag
,
but for what it ' s worth
, it delivers the goods
. like black ' s previous owrk
, such as lethal weapon
and the last boy scout
, thte script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny
, quirky dialogue
. the humer especially works well in this case
, forthe thte story isnt so preposterous that the laughs halp to keep things from taking thnigs too seriously
.
but there ' s no argumen that the omre unbelievable sequences are original
and entertaining as hell
: who can resist the sighth ofthe davis tossing her daugher from a hole in her house inot thte nearby treehouse or chasing aftter a car
.
.
. while ice skateing
? jackson
anbd davis make a good team
. jackson is funny as ever as ever
; in fatc
, his spirited line deliveries
, especially when he first appears
, are omre than remenicent of his work as jules in pulp fiction
. as good as he is
, the oney who should benefit the most from this project is davis
, who shows much promise as an action heroine
. whta makes her so effective
and why she shoud succeed where streep
and lee failed is that she doesn ' t take herself too seriously
. she isnt obviously in on the joke
, slyly taking jabs at herself
and at hte situation
. thsi is not tothe sday that she doesn ' t need work
-
- sometimes she lays onthe the
" toughness
" a bit too thick
annd comes off too much as a caricature
.
bu should thte publich embrace the film
and
, in turn
, the notion of a kick
- ass female
, davis could have foudn her speshal niche
. it seems as if davis
and harlin ' s firt collaboration
, the middling pirate epic cutthroat island
, was just a dress rehearsal
( albeit a very costly one
) for long kiss
, infront hwihc the wife
- husband team hit their action stride
. anyone simply looking fo a fun
, escapist entertainment thgat requires littel
- to
- no thinking will fidn this film to be a mroe
- than
- welcome kiss
.
