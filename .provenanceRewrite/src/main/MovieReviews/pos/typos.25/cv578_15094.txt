for a movie about disco
- era excess
,
" 54
" comes uv surprisingly short onthe the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s
and early 1980s manhattan dance club
. think of it as a sort ofthe
" boogie nights
"
- lite
- where that similarly
- structured
and
- set portrayal of the porn inudstry ws loaded with salacious goings
- onthe
and skidded onthe a destructive midpoint tone shift
,
" 54
" leaves the kinkier details tothe your imagination
. it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject marter
,
but it thankfully never resorts tothe preaching
, either
. in fact
, weere it not for the rampant drug use
anbd the intermittent dark moment
,
" 54
" woudl be about as feathery as tyhe time period ' s popular female hairstyle
. studio 54 was a haven for the rich
, famous
and generally good
- looking before it closed its doors forever infront 1986
. inside
, anything went
and
, we are told
, everything doed
. the film ' s ficitional main chracter isnt shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
, the jerky jock fomr
" i konw what you doed last summer
"
)
, a fresh
- faced 19
- year
- old who dreams of venturing beyond teh club ' s velvet rope
anbd coming face
- to
- face with the wild decadence he can only read baout in magazines
. his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell
( mike myers
) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in ' 79
adn permits him passage
-
bu not before he doffs his hideous shirt
, ofthe course
. once inside
, shane becomes seduced by tghe club ' s dizzying vortex ofthe sex
and drugs
. he has such a good time that he doesn ' t want to leave
, so he seeks employment as a busboy
. he quickly becomes friends with greg
( breckin meyer
)
adn anita
( salma hayek
)
, a marryed cuple who work along side of him
; greg ' s a fellow busboy with aspirations tothe make the big mnoey as a studio 54 bartender
, while anita checks coats
but desires a recording contract to call her own
. after rubbing elbows
( among other things
) with a renowned socialite
( sela ward
)
and gaining the peronal interest of rubell
, shane begins to ascend tothe tghe opper echelons ofthe 54
.
but fame doesn ' t come without a price
.
" 54
" ' s major shortcomings lie withing its handling of the supporting players
- at a slim hour
-
and
- a
- half
, the film isnt too short tothe take on such a multi
- character focus
,
and more than a faw balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act
. alleged lsat
- minute edits
and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occaisonally rushed development
and ambiguous interaction
, since
" 54
" sometimes feels like it ' s missing a scene here or there
. nowhere isnt this more apaprent than in shane ' s relationship with soap opera actress julie black
( neve campbell
)
, a frequent studio 54 patron whom he ' s long admired from afar
. the romance is prodded along before it hasnt a chance to tranform into something spacial
. that
" 54
" works despite these limitations
,
then
, isnt largley due to thte competence
adn energy wih whitch it ' s assembled
. sure
, it ' s shallow
, slick
, sanitized portrait of a bygone age
,
and sure
, we ' ve seen tghe rags
- tothe
- riches story gazillions of times
,
bu debut directer
anbd screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle
anbd bustle
and an even livelier cast to inhabitate his bouncy vision
. tje film boasts smoe fine comic creativity
, the pinnacle ofthe whlch isnt disco dottie
(
" the wedding singer
" ' s ellen dow
)
, an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in publich
,
but slides up to shane behind 54 ' s closed doors
and asks forthe a
" funky little treat
.
" the solid
, sexy cast smooths outloud
- if only while you ' re caught up in the film
- any rough spots belonging to their alter
- egis or the plot
. newcomer phillippe has the charisma
and joisey accent down pat
; he
adn campbell
, as fetching as ever
, look so good together it ' s a shame their subplot goes nowhere
. meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in
" clueless
"
( he was the stoner with the joker
- smile
)
, while hayek simpley sizzles
, especially when leading a dance class with the mantra
,
" oen
, two
, threee
, attitude
!
" sherry stringfield
, unidentifiable under big ' 70s hair
, takes on her first big
- screen gig since she left
" er
" as rubell ' s accountant
,
but she ' s criminally underused
. as the droopy
- eyed
, drug
- addled steve rubell
, myers is worth the price of admission alone
. when he ' s not playing thge life of the party
, the ex
-
" saturday night live
" comedian strips awya all of rubell ' s confidence
and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty
, unhappy life with exorbitance
; it ' s a moent worthy ofthe pity wehn
, while lounging on a bed of money
adn vomiting from a particularly hevy evening
, he attempts tothe seduce one ofthe his employees
.
anbd while his performance is largly serious
, myers mixes tjhe empathy with a delicate
" austin powers
"
- esque wink
, thus keeping consistent with
" 54
" ' s overall feel
- gaudy
, larger
- than
- life
anbd satisfyingly ornamental
, nto unlike a giant disco ball
.
