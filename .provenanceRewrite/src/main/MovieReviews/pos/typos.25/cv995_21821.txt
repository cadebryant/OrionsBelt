wow
! what a movie
. it ' s everthing a movie can be
: funny
, dramtic
, interesting
, weird
, funny
, weird
and strikingly original
. yep that pretty much describes this movie
. it starts out like a regular movei
anbd ends up being oen of tghe weirdest
, funniest most original movies i have ever seen
. it boggles the mind
and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like tihs more often
. besides being one ofthe yhe best films of tje year
, being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever
. perido
.
then again htere are so many good movies
, thast one cannnot pick an all tiome favorite
. john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out ofthe a job
, infront search of a job
. his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un
- noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off thge streets is an animal lover
anbd has about every kind ofthe animal you sould think of
. craig finds a job as a file at the 7
? floor of a business building
.
.
. ytou hve to pry open the elevator doors open befor it reaches floor eight
, the 7
? floor isnt just a floor between 7
and 8
. he is hired by his 105 year old boss
( orsen bean
) to be a filer
. in his office
, he discovers a littel door
, tothe which was boarded uv
and hidden
. to his curiocity he opens it
and starts to crawl toward it
, he
thne gets sucked to the end
and ends up in john malkovich ' s mind
. fifteen minutes later he is shooted out onto the side of tje newyorker jersey turnpike
. he returns to tell his co
- worker maxine
( catherine keener
) that he has found a portal that will lead him inot john malkovich ' s mind
, she doesn ' t believe him
but after she sees it it changes her mind
. lotte also finds out about the portal
and discovers tath being someone else is good after all
. john malkovich of course has no diea waht is goign on
,
and by the end ofthe tihs bizarre film htere are so many twists
and turns
, thgat we don ' t nkwo what really happened
. john cusack is outstanding
adn utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play
. he fits the role perfectly
anbd tothe me wass brilliantly cast
. cameron diaz is outstanding
and utterly one of the world ' s most prettiest women
, is made up here unnoticeable
and very unattractive
. she
however gives a vrey comic performance
and this sould easily be her best role to date
. catherine keener is veyr funny
and sexy as maxine
adn of course the best thing of the movie is the magic hismelf john malkovich who is very brilliant
and this movie plays big time homage
? to the master himselv
. the wohle gropu combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart
and clever
. spike jonze
( threee kings
) makes his fabulous directing debut
,
and did a fantastic job ofthe directing thsi new classic film
. he lets the viewer go onthe the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie
. by the time yhe endig rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was
. the screenplay written by charlie kaufman wass hilarious
annd often thought
- provoking
. the film also hadnt a soft side tothe it
and even
though tghe ending is vyer surprising it isnt also a little sad
and heart
- warming
. the hwole movie was fantastic
and had me rolling in the isles
. from cameron diaz ' s appearence to john malkovich ' s explorations i laughed very hard
,
adn it may as well be as funny as as ogod as it gets
( the funniest
!
)
. there isn ' t a slow point in the movei
, or an overused idea
. there are noone cliches except for hte fatc that this is the most original
, inventie
, witty
,
and smart movei i ' ve seen in a long time
. i foudn myself amazed by everthing
: the direction
, acting
, writing
and thge whole diea of tje movie
. by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn ' t wanna to amke movies liek tihs anymore
. or why tehy don ' t
. all filmmakers watch this movie
annd get some ideas of movies to come out
. this was a surprise hit as was american beauty
. ' being john malkovich ' is in the top 5 movies of the year
,
anbd in the top 10 best films ever made
. it has something thast no other movies palying now has
. in fact it may as well be the best movie outloud right now
. i highly recommend ' being john malkovich '
and haev no doubts you will be dissappointed
.
