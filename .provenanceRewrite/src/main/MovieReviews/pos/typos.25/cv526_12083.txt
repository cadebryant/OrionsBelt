? beleave it
. sliding doors is a love ' what if ' story
. the gimmick is that it ' s really two stories
: tje film follows the life of helen
( gwyneth paltrow
) down two directions
. inwhich the begginning
, likeable gal ' helen '
( gwyneth paltrow
) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job

. helen doesn ' t know it
,
but she is at a fateful juction in life
: 1
) if she enters through the sliding doorjam ofthe a london subway turain her life takes one path wih one future 2
) if she stays on the platform her life takes anyother path with a diferent future
. the film shows waht happens in both paths
, switching back
adn forth beetwen intertwined
, parallel stories
. in story one
, helen meets a charming
and talkative monty python fan named james
( john hannah
) on the train
. arriving home early
, she dicovers that her live
- in
, gerry

,
anbd faces the constatn sneaking suspicion thgat all is not right with her relationship with gerry
. will the truth of the heart finally wokr its way thru a number ofthe problems
annd setbacks in both scenarios
? oppinion
: rejoice all ye monty python fans
, gwyneth paltrow fans
,
and watchers of quirky romance flicks
. at last here ' s proof that there ' s still creativity inthe 1990s filmmaking
. sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year
. nto only isnt it a well
- acted
, heartwarming film
,
but it ' s alsot easily gwyneth paltrow ' s best recent performance
. when helen
( paltrow
) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend isnt a ' shagging wanker
, '
( a british phrase better left untranslated
) she soudns like she knows what she ' s talking baout
! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or otehr sterotypes
. nobody scrambles around inspite danger
, screaming
,
" i will find ytou no matter what
, my darling
!
" when helen finds herself on a boat in yhe starlight with james
, she doesn ' t take tghe easy way out
and leap into his arms
, since she ' s supposed to be recovering from heartache
.
and handsome live
- inwhich boyfriend gerry isn ' t the stereotypical screen hunk
( either a stud or a snob
)
. instead he ' s a nervous
anbd indecisive
, almost helpless hunk
. another example
: when one of tjhe protagonists lies wounded in a hospital
, sliding doors gives us neither the ' hospital miracle ' nor a maudlin tragedy
bu surprises us iwth a third veriasion
. infront other words
, all of the characters seem non
- stereotyped
, human
,
and local
. there are minor inconveniences
. usance sliding doors switches bakc
and forth between two possibile fates
, it ' s occasionally difficult to distinguish between the twpo
. distingishing betwen the two stories isn ' t a problem in hte scenes containing paltrow
, who sports twpo different hairstyles
.
but in scenes containing only lydia
and gerry
, who look the same in both stories
, it ' s slightly confusing
. also
, quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture
( seinfeld
, woody allen
, etc
.
) are spoken by thte british characters
.
but these seem slightly forced
, given thyat tghe remaining dialogue is predominantly brittish slang
. possably an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the brittish so that american audiences can feel mroe comfortable
? sliding doors is a charming
, quirky
, original
, happy romance whith a little ' philosphy of fate ' thrown in
. monty python
anbd the meaning ofthe fate
, anybody
?
