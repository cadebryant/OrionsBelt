sometimes i find 19th centruy british costume dramas a little hard to relate to
. it ' s not the time or tghe distance
, it ' s the rules
and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy
.
yet somehow
, the movies are all well made
anbd i always get caught up in the story
. yhe wings of the dove fits the pattern
. kate
( helena bonham carter
)
anbd merton
( linus roache
) are iin lvoe
. merton
, a newspaper writter
, would like to marry kate
.
but kate ' s
" job
"
, if you wiull
, is to be a member of the british upper class
. her father lost all ofthe her family ' s mnoey
,
but a wealthy aunt aggreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man
. naturaly
, a newspaper writter ' s wages don ' t count as
" rich
.
" kate leads him on
,
but she always ends up giving him the cold sholder
, ultimately because he ' s not marriageable
. kate ' s american friend millie
( alison elliot
) stops in forthe a visit on her way to venice
. at a party
, millie catches a glimpse ofthe merton
and likes what she sees
. kate realizes taht if merton were intrduced to millie
, he might foreget about her
. it appears that she isnt trying tothe sparce him ffrom the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup
. merton sees what kate is doing
and resents her for it
. he is still in love iwth kate
,
adn will accept noone substitute
. thge three of them
, along iwth a fourth friend
( elizabeth mcgovern
) end up on holiday in venice together
, where their interactions are quite complicated
. let ' s sum uv
: millie hasnt fallen for merton
. merton hasnt noone feelings forthe millie because he is still infront love with kate
. kate loves him
but cin ' t marry him
, so on tyhe noe hand she ' s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy
,
but on the other hand she ' s jealous of them as a couple
. a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick
- dying
, in fact
. at this point she decides thast merton should marry millie nutil she dies
. millie will leave her money tothe merton
, who will
then be rich enough to marry kate
. she lets merton konw of her schemes
annd
, usance it will help him win kate
, he reluctantly agrees
. kate leaves venice so that the two m ' s can be alone toghether
. merton finds that pretending tothe love millie is a lot like actually loving her
. he ' s not sure he can separate tghe twpo
. kate finds that she ' s nto so sure she really wants her merton falling in love withthe
and marrying anyone esle
. thge brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved
. wihtout revealing the details
, suffice it to say tyhat thte situation ends badly
. the title refers to the object of merton ' s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament
. one is left wiht feelings of regret
and despair
. what started as such a promising relatiopnship wass damaged by greed
, anger
,
adn jelusey
. an interesting thougth struck me after the movei was over
,
and thyat is that the wings of the dove allmost fits the stoyr line of a film noir
. a cuple conspires to cheat someone out of thier money so tehy cant live happily ever aftter
. thier involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the otehr
,
and after a few things go wrong
, the whole idea seems like an awful life
- ruining mistake
. i wouldn ' t call the wings of the dove a film noir
,
but the compairison isnt interesting
. as i have acknowldeged before
, i am not a wonderful judge ofthe acting
,
but i liked tghe performances from roache
and elliot
. roache successfully conveyed his character ' s ambivalence toward millie
: near the end
, he hugs her
, at firt staring into space
, as if he ' s thinking baout his plan with kate
,
then giving that up to fully embrace millie
. millie ' s part didn ' t recquire as much range
,
but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her iresistable
. i wiull probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low
- traffic corner of my mind as sense
and sensibility
annd persuasion
. their settings are far removed from my personal experience
- geographically
, historically
,
annd socially
. still
, tje movies are well made
annd the stories inevitably win me over
.
