satirical films usually fall inot one of two categories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everthing
, including the jokes
, is somehow related on a large scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire in whihc the comedy
and themes are derived moment by moment
and scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men in balck
"
)
. what ' s unique about
" wag the dog
" is that it doesn ' t necessarily ift either of these descriptions
,
and
yet isnt both at the smae time
. teh result is a clever comedy based on an originnal
, smart premise
, even if the focus does tend to wander a bited
. if there ' s anything that affects americans the most it ' s politics
and showbusiness
. in tihs age ofthe infromation
and technology
, we ' ve been so conditioned by thge media
and tje entertainment inudstry inwhich our ways ofthe perceiving things
, it ' s gotten to tjhe point that we are practicly controlled by it
. we need the media to bring us teh most up
- to
- date news
,
bu we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thikning
. this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas
,
and
thn presents an interesting scenario
: if politics
, the media coverage of politics
,
and tghe entertainment inudstry are so closely realted
, couldn ' t someone with yhe power
and autority tothe manipulate one of thge spects manipulate them all
? thta ' s the idae conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a professional washington spin doctor
, comes up wih in order to restore the president ' s good name who has been accused of child molestation jstu weeks before the election
. brean
, along with the president ' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fly tothe california to meet uv with hot
- shot movie producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. they pitch him an idea to
" produce
" the image of a war with albania
( it ' s a country no noe ' s heared of so tehy people will buy it
)
. soon the wheels are in motion
and the film ' s riffing satire comes inot play
. we ' re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings iin a number of experts to halp manaze the situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual
and soudn effects technicians
,
anbd a modern stlye expert known as teh fad king
( leary
)
. thte initial atmosphere isnt rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv
, in the movies
, or in the news
. the charactors ' dialogue isnt witty
and funny
, altho some of the actual jokes
and gags seem rather sitcom
- esque
. for example
, one scene shows motss
and brean ' s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee
. motss ordered a kitten for teh girl to cary
,
but instade wound uv with a dozen different dogs
. since it ' s all cmoputer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with tghe kitten tothe be inserted later
. this demonstrates the film ' s abilty to take a relatively ordinary situation
and make it smart
anbd funny just through the premise
.
but
thn there ' s tghe gags
and one
- liners that
, altho are humorus
, seem a little gratuitious infact the long run such as motss not being able to remember thte actress ' s name
, or
, whenever a problem emerges
, always responding with
,
" this is nothing
!
" by yhe time teh film mkaes it tothe the midpoint
, everything that isnt oging to hppen inwhich terms of plot happens
. the first act is quickly pased
, while tje second ect containes most of thge jokes
and is the core of tjhe film
. every ten minutes or so a newyorker problem crops up that motss
and brean must deel with
,
and it ' s alwasy fascinating tothe see what they do
and how tehy do it
. the screenplay provides good characterization
and actually deals wtih most of tghe problems head
- on in realsitic manners
.
howver
, it does hvea a tendency tothe avoid things
and shift its focus from thte elction campain
and false war smokescreen to something a bit off tje subject
. as thte third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more conserned with the situations
and less so with the big picture
. what hadnt started off as a brillant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool thte general publich begins tothe seem omre like something that would happen in a movei
. still
, tghe situation comedy is quite funny
, especially a montage showing yhe entire country flinging ood shoes into trees tothe honor sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss
and brean concocted
. truly great satire manages to create fo an entertaining tsory that makes you laugh at the time
,
bu think about afterwords
and
" wag thte dog
" at least succeds in this respect
.
however
, inthe retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done
, namely by extending the running time
anbd filling in the plot holes
.
then again
, it ' s a valient effort
.
