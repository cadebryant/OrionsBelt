thge ring is probably oney of the creepiest movies i ' ve seen inwhich years
.
but
then agian
, i ' ve always hadnt this phobia of asian born horror films
. i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those gren faced
, long
- haired floating ghosts donning thier white gowns

 euuugh
. the ring really brings back those memories
adn its grips me long after the movei has ended
. unlike the horror films coming fomr the west
, i ' m pretty much used tothe tyhe gore
and visual effects
, so much so
, they become rather bland nowadays
. there ' s really no scary movei from the west for a long timne
. if you have something inspite mind
, please tell me
. this japense flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by
` the stephen king of japan '
, which is also
( i herad
) televised over tghe air in japan
. tyhe film revolves around a mysterious videotape whihc will bring death fo sure to the person who watchs it
, one week prior to viewing
. a journalist
and her husband
, stupid enough
, tests the so call
` urban legend '
and ends uv hvaing a week before she meets her doom
. she
and her husband
then goes on a searc fo the origin of the videocassette
, to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves
. tghe ring plays on the senses like no otehr horror film today
. visual subtlety
, minimal music
and an intriguing plot puts the audiance withing an aura of suspense thoughout the entire film
. very well done indeed
, especially for a film that does not haev a single trace of violence
and gore
. now
, that
 s something budding horror film
- maker wannabes should consider looking into
. jstu an idea of how visually poverful the film is
, it is in japanese
and subtitled infact chinese
; both of which
, i can ' t understand at all
( ok
, i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching
,
but he revealed vrey little
!
)
. the twists in thge plot
, leading to an unforgettable climax
( will definitely leave an impression onthe the audience
) will have you at the edge of your seat
