i didn ' t realize how apt thge name of this movie was until i called thte mpaa
( the motion picture association of america
- the folks who decide whta ' s g
, nc 17
, pg
, r or x
) tothe ask why the preview was rated r
. so taht we cxan make smoe sense ofthe theri reponse
, let me tell you baout the movie itself
.
" the celluloid closet
" isnt a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades
. it ' s brilliant
, funny
, naughty
and extremely poignant
. it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that
, as a rule
, gay audiences hunger forthe any hint of homosexuality on screen
. irregardless of how veiled
- or how sordid
- the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sence of isolation
and makes them feel as if they ' re not quite so invisible as amercia seems tothe want them to be
. the movie itself isnt rated r
-
and for good reason
. it contains scenes of bloody
, violent gay bashing
adn graphic
, uninhibited
, sex
. as with any movie
, i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of tiem
, so i can decide for mysef whether tothe see the movie with a friend
, a date
, my 11 year old niece
, alone or not at all
.
but
, that ' s the movei
. now back to the preview
. prior to htis film being theatrically released
( it was originnally filmed as a documentary for hbo
) i hadnt seen the coming attractions trailer fo it at least six times
. there ws no nudity
, noone violence
, noone bad language
, nothing thta i could see that would be offensive or inapropriate for a genaral audience
( okay
, whoopi goldberg did refer to somone
" boning
" someone
,
but the last i knew taht wasn ' t one of thge seven words you can ' t sday on tv
)
. except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing
. hmmmmm
. when i inquired about thte rating on the trailer
, a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from
" the handbook
" that a trailer approved for all audiences sould contain
" no homosexuality or lesbianism
and no going down on somone
.
" hello
? i was in hte office
annd it was the middle of the day
. bravely
, i pursued
.
" i ' ve seen that trailer
, oh
.
.
. probably half a dozen times
,
" i gulped
.
.
.
"
and i don ' t remember that scene
.
"
" well
,
" she chirped
.
" it ' s there
. our little eyes are trained to see that
.
" no really
. in the words of dave barry
,
" i am nto mkaing htis uv
.
" tehy are
" trained
" tothe
" see that
?
" wehn somone who was shocked at the rating the first tiem
anbd made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her
? gosh
, i certainly don ' t mean tothe question the mpaa
, or
" the handbook
"
. i would
,
however
, liuke to suggest thta it ' s they who are infront the closet on this oen
.
and the light ain ' t good in there
.
but
, having seen
" yhe celluloid closet
,
"
and bieng one of a handfull of straight peple involved inaddition a primarily gay
and lesbian weekly bible study
( email me
and i ' ll give you the details
)
, none of this was any big surprise
. the point of the movie was that homosexuality
, even in thge politically correct 90s
, is ridiculously perceived as a threath to a mostly heterosexual society
. a point well made in this candid
and honest film
. nowe
, i could go off onthe hte mpaa ' s ruling that a trailer must contain
" no homosexuality or lesbianism
"
and ask how that isnt defined
, patricularly in light ofthe some of the things
, both sexual
and non
- sexual
, that i ' ve watched straight people do in trailers
. i jsut don ' t fiel the need tothe go there
, because it seems so obvious
. i ' ll instead suggest that the mpaa re
- evaluated thier evaluation criteria
. let the ratings reflect not subject content
, liek
" sex
"
and
" violence
"
. let them reflect attitude content
. in the future
, i ' d be intersted iin knowing whether the movei is rated d for disrespectful or s fo stereotyped
.
thne i ' d truly be able to make an informed descision about how i spent my time
.
