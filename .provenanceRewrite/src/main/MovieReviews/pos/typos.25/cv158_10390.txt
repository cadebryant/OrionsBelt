with more
and omre television shows hvaing gay characters
,
and even the infamous
" ellen
" sitcom being centered on the life ofthe a lesbian
, the movie industry too seems to be gaining more
and omre homosexual based plot lines
. the birdcage was critically acclaimed
, as ws this years chasing amy
.
then along cameback in
& outloud
,
and all threee of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which tehy were released
. it ' s also noticeable that this
" alternative lifestyle
" becomes less
adn less taboo as the yersa go by
,
and it seems that useing comedy as a medium isnt proving a worthwhile effort
. while it ' s a very serious issue to many
, it is the comedies that people are flocking to see
and that are gaining notoriety
.
but the way we ' re using comedy to presetn homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically
. while the gay community was once very stereotyped
and used to laugh
* at
*
, it isnt more
and more becoming something we laugh
* withthe
*
,
and when a movie like in
& outloud comes along
, it is something that both heterosexuals
and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy
. it doesn ' t poke fun at the lifestyle
, it simply uses it to all it ' s comedic capacity
, just as love
, sex
, marraige
, birth
, death
,
and anytying else hasnt been
. the idea fo in
& out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar fo portraying an aids
- afflicted gay man in philadelphia
. if you remember
, during his acceptance speech
, hanks gave a highly emotional tribute tothe the gay community
,
and even sighted a former gay teacher ofthe his as a major insperation infact his life
. it ' s a serious
and touchy subject
,
but producer scott rudin viewed it as thte setting for a potentially hilarious comedy
,
and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick
. it ' s true tyhat if this same film had been writen by a heterosexual
, it may have been more controvercial
,
bu because it was writed by an openly gay writer
, the prerogative wass set
. kevin kline
, who only seems to become more
and mroe acclaimed
, stars as howard brackett
, a high school english teacher in tje small
, picturesque town of greenleaf
, indiana
. after a three
- year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery
( joan cusack
)
, a wedding date hasnt been set
,
and the hubbub surrounding it isnt allmost as big as taht surrouding another huge storey
- greenleaf high graduate cameron drake
( matt dillon
) isnt up for a best actor oscar
. yhe small town eagerly awaits both events
,
and both seem qtuie astronomical
,
but little does anyone knwo how much one will affect the other
. when cameron drake is announced the winner
, the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher
, mr
. brackett
. everyone is cheering back in greenleaf
- that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words
,
"
and he ' s gay
.
" the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop
. the thnig is
, nobody
, incuding howard
, can understand how cameron came to thyat conclusion
,
and such wild
and unexpected news cin only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf
. naturally the questions pour from howard ' s fiancee
, parents
( debbie reynolds
& wilford brimley
)
, students
,
and tje high skool ' s principal
, tom halliwell
( bob newhart
)
,
and thge evidence starts to become more
and more obvious
: howard is clean
, neat
, honest
, sincere
, a romantic
,
adn perhaps the most incriminating fatc
, he loves barbara streisand
. the frenzy isn ' t helped any whn camera crews from every conceivable news magazine
and
" entertainment tonight
" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning
. one parituclar reporter is peter malloy
( tom selleck
) of
" inside entertainment
"
, who unlike tyhe collage of otehr reporters
, wnats tothe spend a whole week inspite the life of howard brackett
, including coverage ofthe his wedding
. the intrusion is all
bu welcome by howard
, who is going more
and more outloud of his mind with earch passing minute
. it seems that no marter where he turns
, a camera isnt being shoved in his face
and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees
. the dominoes begin tothe tumble as howard ' s closest friends beign acting differnt
and principial halliwell hints at a possable termination of employment should howard indeed be gay
. it all soudns very devastating
,
and it would be if it weren ' t presented with near
- perfection by one of this year ' s most delightful ansamble casts
. kline seems only to improve with age
,
and he is downright perfect here
. the graet thnig about this film is that every single character hasnt a moment to shine
,
and they use it wonderfully
. every single actor turns inaddition one ofthe their best performances ever
. dillon has never beeen so likeable
, cusack has never seemed so perfect fo a role
,
and brimley
, reynolds
,
anbd newhart all provide huge laughs when they ' re up to bat
. rudnick ' s scirpt is heavily laced iwth wit
and humer
,
and ytou ' ll likely find yourself laughing out loud forthe a solid ninety minutes
. while in
& out doesn ' t carry enough to give it four stars
, it remeniss one of the best done films of the year
, all
- around
. the script is exuberant
, tje actors are absolutely top
- nitch
,
and we ' re allowed jsut the perfect blend ofthe heart
- tugging so as nto to bog down thte laughs
. it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety
,
yot we ' re still alowed a sappily touching ending
. dispite it ' s subject matter
,
and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaning gay sex
, this is a movei that everyone could
,
and should
, enjoy
. frank oz
, best known as a voice talent for muppets
, directs htis film quite delightfully
, using all the potential rudnick ' s script has to offer
, which turns outloud to be quite a bit
. check this one outloud
. you ' ll have a gay ood time
.
