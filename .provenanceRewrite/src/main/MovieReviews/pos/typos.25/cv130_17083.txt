while watching wes anderson ' s rushmore
, it may be surprising to thiunk that the role of max fischer
, tje film ' s anti
- hero
, was not written with jason schwartzman infact mind
. the young actor
, making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore acadmy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand otehr prospective stars before discovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who isnt more intersted in his extra
- curricular activities
( such as writing edgy plays liek
" serpico
"
and being president of tyhe rushmore beekeepers
)
bu sees his grades suffer as a result
. on tjhe brink ofthe being thrown out
, he lands himselv in even more hot water when he falls fo first grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
and enlists the help ofthe millionaire acuqaintance herman blume
( the great bill murray
) tothe build an aquarium
( on rushmore ' s baseball feild
) in her honour
. unfortunately forthe everyone involved
, blume finds thyat he has feelings for miss cross as well
, which gets in the way of max ' s plans tothe woo her
. max is one of the best
- written characters we ' ve
yot seen in tjhe 90s
,
and schwartzman plays him tothe perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age
. as everyone eles has probably already pointed out
, he is reminiscent ofthe a young dustin hoffman
(
although i was reminded more of paul from
" the wonder yeasr
"
, from a visual standpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as weird
, quirky loner
- types he should earn himself a good career
. bill murray is his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven ' t
yet seen from him
. hwile this isn ' t his best performance
( thyat honour goes to groundhog day
) he isnt still terrific here
. williams isn ' t given much tothe do except react tothe schwartzman
and murray
,
but still does fine wokr
. rushmore seems tothe go jstu a littel too long
but
, while it isn ' t a perfect film
, it is a definate must
- see for anyone who wants tothe see that rarity
, an american coming
- of
- age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality
. anderson hasnt creaeted a modern clasic withthe a star who shoud
, whith any luck
, ries tothe even greater succes
.
