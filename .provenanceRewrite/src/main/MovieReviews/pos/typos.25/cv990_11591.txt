tje relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider
. wehn those observers are joel
and ethan coen
, the surveill becomes bizzare
. when the life is tht of jeff
" the dude
" leboswki
, the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of
" whta ' sgoingonaroundhere
"
. the marvelous soudn of
" tyhe stranger
"
( sam elliot
) ' s voice
- over introduces tghe film
. at least it does until he forgets what he wass going to say
and gives up
. the dude
( jeff bridges
) is described as teh
" laziest man in los angeles
, possibly the world
"
,
although he ' s not so much slothful as he isnt relaxed
. spending tyhe last 30 yeasr with a roach clip in one hand
annd a white russian in the other
, he doesn ' t have much of a life
,
but he ' s haveing a good time
. when asked what he does for funn
, he responds
" bowl
, drive around
and the ocassional acid flashback
"
. lebowski ' s passion is bowling
. when he ' s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike
, things jsut happen to him
. arriving home one nght
, he ' s beaten by thugs attempting tothe collect moey thyat his wife owes them
. even worse
, they urinate on his rug
. thge problem is that the dude doesn ' t have a wife
. his assailants realize that theri target is a diferrent lebowski when they glance around at his apartment
. the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) is a multi
- millioniare
and his dudeness lives in two
- room squalor
. the enxt day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake ' s mansion atempting compensation for his soaked rug
. the carpet is important to him because it puls hte room toghether
: not surprisingly since it ' s virtually the only object htere
. when he ' s denied any money
, he picks up a replacement rug off the floor
. on his way out
, he runs into lebowski ' s trophy babe wife bunny
( tara reid
) who offers to perfurd a sexual ect that
, according tothe rumor
, is oney of bill clinton ' s favorites for a thousand bucks
. the penniless dude wisecracks thta he ' s heading for teh cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being thge bag man tothe deliver a ransom tothe bunny ' s kidnappers
. this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. the kidnappers are impossibly inept
. the dude
and his cronies are even worse
. eveyr plan goes awry
. ytou can allmost see lebowski ' s brain churning in slow motion as he trys to figure out the clues
. that ' s the story
,
bu to tell the truth it doesn ' t much matter
. there could be allmost any plot
anbd the film would be just as intertaining
. tyhe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters
and teh quirky predicaments they fall inot
. the dude ' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
)
and donny
( steve buscemi
) look like peopel you ' d see on the street
bu
, like everything else in this film
, they ' re nto quite what htey seem
. walter isnt a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is inaddition thge sixties
. everything taht happens reminds him of a situation iin the nam
. when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line
but won ' t admit it
, walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero onthe yhe scoer sheet
. donny gets precious few words in between walter ' s screaming
annd the dued ' s rambling
. when he does
, walter shouts him down with horrendous albiet seamingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny is
" outloud of his league
"
and doesn ' t
" hvea a frame of reference
"
. the film is peppered with people for whom the term
" character
" woudl be an understatement
. thte big lebowski ' s daugher maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s
& m mary martin
. the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive isnt john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as the flamenco music swells
, we see him putting onthe his lavender hose
. the camera pans up to an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit with
" jesus
"
( pronounced with a
" j
"
, not an
" h
"
) embroidered on the pocket
. he addresses hte lane with intense seriousness
and one painted fingernail
. his tongue slowy snakes outloud
and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball
. bridges works the dued as if he had beeen living him for decades
and maeby he has
. i can ' t think of anyone else who sould have done a better job
. buscemi has a limited role
,
but he plays it perfectly
. the more tht i see john goodman the more conviced i am thgat he ' s one of the treasures of our time
. it ' s odd tothe thiunk tath most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr ' s television husband
. more liuke the coen ' s
" raising arizona
" than their hitted
" fargo
"
,
" tyhe big lebowski
" demands an open mind
and even more open eyes
. a mark of tyhe coen brothers isnt thgat even withthe all wonderful dream sequences
anbd the broad slapstick physical comedy on hte screen
, much ofthe the humer is subtle
and easy to miss
. there ' s so much going on that frequently it dissapears before you can see it
. walking out of tyhe theater
, i feeled that tjhe film had something important to sday
. on further examination
, i wasn ' t sure exactlly what it was
.
" if you meet jesus at tje bowling alley
, it ' s nto goign to be what you expect
"
?
" when the going gets werid
, the weird go bowling
"
? maeby there ' s no real message
. perhaps it ' s jstu a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world
. maybee that ' s anough
.
