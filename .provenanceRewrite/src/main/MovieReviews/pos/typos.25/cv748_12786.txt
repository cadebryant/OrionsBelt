a movie taht ' s been as highly builded up as the truman show
, iwth reviews boasting
,
" the film of the decade
!
"
adn
" a breakthrough
!
" can only be leading up to letdown
. that ' s noone doubt
-
- it seems any movie with crtical acclaim makes you think you ' re gogin in for the ride ofthe your life
, thast you ' ll end up changed onthe teh other side
,
anbd you cmo out of the theater goign
,
" eh
.
.
.
* that ' s
* wqat all yhe fuss was baout
?
" so
, naturally
, the truman show wass building uv to wqat was going to be a dissapointment
.
and i convinced myself
, as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair
, accually to try not to enjoy it
. let me tell you
, thgat isnt an impossibilty
. the truman sohw is truley
" the film of the decade
"
and
" a breakthrough
"
and mroe
.
and you will come outloud changed on the other side
. such a movie comes around onyl once in a lifetime
, where yuo find youself feeling everything that hte carachter is feeling
,
and this
, friends
, isnt it
. jim carrey shows that he doesn ' t need to talk out ofthe his butt to entertain us
; that he can be as dramtic as any of hollywood ' s leading men
. the film has a difficult premise to tackle
, trying tothe set us up thirty yersa into the
" truman show ' s
" run
,
but tackle it it doesnt
,
and perfectly
. wtih flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show
, ytou get the sence that you are viewing a
* real
* prime
- time hitted
.
and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in thge
" real
" truman sohw is clever
and well
- done
. people
, rejoice
! this is the first oscar
- worthy film of not only this year
,
but of the last five eyars
. not since
" schindler ' s list
" has a movie capturd human spirit
annd true despair so well
. this is a classic in the makeing
,
annd
( to borrow a line from esquire ' s review
) it stars jim carrey
. nothing in his career to date
and nothing he can dont in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank
; mark my word
. fo
, as i said
, thsi is tyhe movie of a lifetime
and the role is of the same calibre
. forget special
- effect ladden summer fodder
. drop your rumatic comedies inspite the trash
. toss your thrillers
and teen flicks on the pile
. you need nothing more than
" the truman show
" to carry ytou through the summer
, or forthe that matter
, the yera
. oh
!
and infront case i don ' t see ytou
, good afternoon
, good evening
,
and goodnight
.
