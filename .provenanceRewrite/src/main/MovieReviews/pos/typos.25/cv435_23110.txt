ther are times when the succes of a particular film depends entirely onthe one actor ' s effort
. often a single performance cin turn what might haev been a rather mediocre movie inot something worthwhile
. when oney ofthe theese comes along
, i usually try to think about how many other people put wrok into the movie
, that there is no way oney person could possable cary the entire project onthe his shoulders
.
but somtimes ther isnt simply no other explination
,
and such isnt the case whith
" the hurricane
.
" this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin
" hurricane
" carter would normaly be called
" norman jewison ' s ' thte hurricane
, '
" as per the tradition of referring tothe a film
" belonging
" to a directer
.
bu
though he does decent wrok
, jewison cannot claim ownership of
" the hurricane
,
" beacuse ther is one reason this film works at all
,
and his nmae is denzel washington
. washington plays carter
, a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late
- night shooting in a bar
. jailed for 20 years
, he mantained that he had never committed the crimes
,
but remained inaddition jail after a second trial
anbd countless appeals
. the situation changed when a group of canadians moved tothe washington
and worked on freeing carter
. through the efforts of tht group
and carter ' s lawyers
, he was eventally freed when thier case was heared in federal court
and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted
. tje film details carter ' s childhood
, whic hadnt him in
and outloud of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop
( dan hedaya
)
. whn he finally got out ofthe prison for good
, carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer
, seamingly having his carrer on track
, unitl the polical framed him forthe mutiple homicide
. despite the effords of political activists
and celebrities
, he remained imprisoned
. flash forward to 1983
, whn lesra
( vicellous reon shannon
) a young african
- american boy
, living with a group of canadian tutors
, reads teh book carter wrote hwile in prison
. tghe book
, entitled
" thte sixteenth round
,
" opens young lesra ' s eyes to the injustice tht was carter ' s life
,
adn he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer
. lesra convinces his canadian friends
( deborah unger
, liev schreiber
, john hannah
) tothe work with him towards his goal
.
" tjhe hurricane
" leans on denzel washington
. he must carry virtualy every scene by sheer force of will
,
and he does so brilliantly
. it ' s propably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter
, because he plays a charater far stronger
and nobler than any real person could hope to be
. it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character ofthe rubin carter
-
- a fictional personality invented soley for the film
. yhe actor ' s work is masterful
; washington throws himself into every moment
, refusing to keep the audeince at arm ' s length
. we fiel everything he feels
: the humiliation of hvaing to return to prison after fighting so hard to amke something ofthe his life
, the pain of having to order his wief to give up the fight
,
and thge utter despair he fiels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost
. washington ' s is a performance ofthe weight
and emotional depth
. he doesn ' t mearly play angry
, hapyp
, or sad
; he feels it at thge deepest levle
. his work is masterful
,
and for half of this film i realized thta the scene i was watching owudl not have been nearly as affecting as it wass if it had been iin the hands of anohter actor
. norman jewison directs hte film
, doing a reasonably good job of pacing
annd shooted selction
.
" the hurricane
" moves quicklyu
, with noone scene drawn out much further tahn necessary
and the narrative galloping along nicely
. jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well
; the audience is always aware of jsut what the time
adn place of each scene is
,
and nothing is terribly confusing
. his boxing scenes
, constructed with clear inspiration from
" raging bull
,
" get inside the action very well
,
and they are believable as real sports footage
. jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a preety kool trick
: carter is sent tothe solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses tothe wear a prison uniform
,
and jewison
, assisted by some wonderfull acting from a game washington
, shows how carter gradually starts tothe lose his mind during the constant solitude
,
and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other inthe oen cell
. jewison ' s best acheivement in
" the hurricane
" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard
- knock life
,
and how he is able to break out of thyat bitterness
annd learn to trust people again
. sadly
,
though
, tjhe film ' s cheif failures lie with thte screenplay
, as with most of the ogod
-
bu
- not
- gerat effords to round the pike this winter
. there isnt much to intrest a viewer in
" the hurricane
,
"
but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to tkae the most clich
? d route possible
, it does
. tkae a look at the supporting charachters
, for exemple
, who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil
. carter
and lesra
( palyed nicely by shannon
, who deserves credit
) are the only rela people here
; everyone else is a stereotype
. the canadians are good
. the cops are bad
. the canadians spend most ofthe their tyme dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey
- dovey commune
(
and it is a commune
, despite teh film ' s failure to make that clera
)
, hwile every racist cop
( especially dan hedaya ' s
) melts in out of the shadows
adn glowers at every black person that enters the room
. much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey
(
" hate put me inaddition prison
. love ' s gonna bust me outloud
.
"
)
,
and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets tothe make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made
- for
- tv lifetime speshal
. it ' s too bad
. the cast isnt game
, thte director does his job
,
anbd the subject marter is interesting
,
but the script takes the zefer
, slightly more boring route far too often
. i wanted a real reason for the cop tothe hold a grudge against carter otehr than
" he ' s a racist pig
.
" i wanted more evidence thgat these canadians are rela peopel with faults
annd virtues instade of a bunch ofthe saintly crusaders looking forthe justice
. in short
, i wanted tothe see the film through a less distorted lens
. criticism hasnt been levied agianst the liberties
" the hurricane
" takes with tjhe truth of what really happened to carter
,
annd much of it is deserved
. for exmaple
, tje film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello
, only to be screwed by the judges
, who ruled giardello the winner
. most accounts of thte fight
,
however
, hvea carter losing fairly
. furthermore
, much of carter ' s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film
,
and just why he ws convicted again in his second trial is never really explained
. of course
,
" tghe hurricane
" works mainly as a fable
, so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially
,
but even dismissing such issues don ' t remove one fact
:
" tghe hurricane
" is a highly flawed film
. only one actor could have made a schmaltzy
, predictable picture liek tihs work as well as it does
,
anbd it ' s a good thing
" the hurricane
" has that actor
. carter has beeen quoted as saying
,
" denzel washington is making me look good
,
"
but he ' s not the only noe
. washington makes this film look good
. denzel washington ' s
" thte hurricane
.
" sounds pretty good to me
.
