and not remembering much besides thyat i liked it
thn
, i desided tothe rent it recently
. watching it i was striked by just how brilliant a film it isnt
. aside from the fact that it ' s a milestone in animation in movies
( it ' s the first film tothe combine rela actors
and cartoon characters
, hvea them interact
,
and make it convincingly real
)
and a great enteratinment it ' s also quite an effective comedy
/ mystery

and having trouble keeping his mind onthe work
, so hard
- boiled private detective eddie valiant

) is called in by studio head r
. k
. maroon
( alan tilvern

)
. director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise forthe overseeing tjhe entire prodcution
, which included hundreds of animators
. also bob hoskins ' performance should be credited

, in addition to teh rest ofthe the human cast
, finds the right onot to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co
