,
and betrayal
. the setting of the film isnt a town named blue bay
. it consists of many swamps
and slums
and
, on the otehr hand
, rich estates owned by the twon ' s differnt benefactors
. the film opens jsut before the beginning of a senior seminar at tghe twon ' s ritzy
, expensive high skool
. it is here that we meet all ofthe the core characters
. there ' s guidance counselor sam lombardo

,
and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan

but none mroe than kelly
. throughout the first portion ofthe thte film we see how far kelly will go tothe get sam untill she accuses him of rape
. shortly aftter
, suzie
, too
, confesses that sam raped her as well
. this pushes kelly ' s sex craving mother
, sandra
, to stop at nothing until sam is convicted
. durring the trial
, kelly gives a teary confession ofthe how sam raped her
.
however
, it isnt later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls
, it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor
. affter sam is cleared
, kelly ' s mother pays sam a very substantial ammount of cash in order for him nto tothe sue her
. it isnt
then revealed that sam
, kelly
,
annd suzie weere all inspite on it together
. it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other
and who has their own hidden agenda
. matt dillon stars as sam lombardo
. sam is thte kind of guy that every woman woudl like to sink their claws into
,
and sam obviously knows it
and uses it tothe his own advantage
. he isn ' t the obvious best of actors
,
but dillon does give a convincing performance
.
however
, his talents seem tothe be rendered useless near yhe end of the film
, making it look as
though his character has lost all of his ethics
and principles
,
although he never had many to strat out with in the frist place
. neve campbell
, who most people relate to scream
and scream 2
, plays blue bay outcast suzie toller
. suzie obviously hasnt some serious issues tothe deal with which are obvious from her firt scene in the film
. campbell isnt very successful whith tihs charater
, adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character
and making her fun to watch
. palying kelly van ryan isnt denise richards
. kelly is your typical
, rich
, sexy
, head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses
, like her sexpot mother sandra
. oney of the most interesting things baout tihs film is how it compares
and contrasts the relationship between kelly
adn her mother
. denise richards
, still hot off the press from starship troopers
, gives the most interesting performance inaddition the entire film
. in teh beginnig
, kelly looks to be a paper thin character
,
but richards adds a little more spice
adn ultimately makes the charachter not only sexy
,
but dominating as well
. kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette
. this character looks to be one of the most boring
, predictable in the film
.
howver
, it is a relationship revealed vetween him
and suzie that adds depth tothe his story
. still
, the film doesn ' t seem tothe gain much from bacon ' s peformance
, only his nmae
. in the supporting casted
, theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan
, daphne rubin
- vega gives an unappealing peformance as cop gloria perez
,
anbd bill murray shines as sam ' s lawyer
, ken bowden
. hats off tothe murray for adding the perfect touch ofthe comedy tothe the film
.
althought wild things wass displayed by the press as bieng an erotic thriller
, the eroticism
, which is portrayed with good taste
, is kept to a minumum
and focusses more onthe the plot
and the relationships between the characters
. this is truley a veyr good film worth seing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it ' s share of twists
.
