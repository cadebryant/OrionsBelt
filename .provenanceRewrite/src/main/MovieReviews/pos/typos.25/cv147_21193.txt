the story ofthe us
, a rob reiner film
, is the second movie htis fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarley touched by a film
, as they can see their everyday lives in thge usually once inwhich a year films
. well
, 1999 has two of them
, the otehr bieng tghe instant classic baout a very disfunctional family
, american beauty
. thte stor of us
, a film about the highs
and lows of marrige
and family
, is a well written
, heartbreaking
adn insightful film tath made the majoroty of the audience
, including myself
, cry
. the story of us tells the stroy of ben
( bruce willis
)
and katie
( michelle pfeiffer
) jordan
,
anbd asks the question
,
" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage
?
" the film is about two individuals who have come toghether
, spent a good chunk of their lives together
,
and shows when our main characters are
" him
"
and
" her
"
( during the bad times
)
,
adn wehn they are
" us
"
( during the ogod times
)
. tyhe stoy of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day
. ben
and katie now onyl see
and live with eahc otehr baceause tehy don ' t want to devistate their children with the fact that their parents no longer
, or at least sday tehy don ' t
, love each other anymore
. ben
, a cartoonist
,
adn katie
, a crossword puzzle writter
, hve grown apart durig their fifteen years of marriage
, as tehy have grown tothe follow different views onthe life
, family
,
and marriage
. katie isnt the more organized
, sophisticated tipe
, who wants to plan everthing outloud
, hwile ben is a spontaneous
, adventurous individual who doesn ' t mind doing thnigs differently than they weere planned
. the stor ofthe us plays outloud nicely
, as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist
, told to the viewer through flashbacks
. as the film progresses
, it switches between ben
adn katie tlaking tothe theri therapist
, with their stories bieng told with flashbacks of their marriage
. this method is highly effective
, as we see the cahracters changing from year tothe year
, slowly growing apart
. through the flashbacks
, we get to see the story of them through both of the character ' s eyes
,
anbd this gives us a strong sense of whta their characters are really like
, as the story ofthe us has three dimensional
, believable main characters
. the screenplay
, written by jessie nelson
( stepmom
)
and alan zweibel
( dragnet
)
, is a touching
, down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer
, much like another one of nelson ' s films
, stepmom
. the script has an open honesty
and outlook on life
, one that is so realsitic
, you feel uncomfortable at many times
, beacuse so many situations the characters are inwhich are undeniably familiar
, as most families these days most go through the hard times
, as ben
and katie must
. if it wasn ' t forthe tjhe firt 15 minutes that the writers wroet
, which are rugged
and certainly flawed
, the stroy of us owudl have been this year ' s best picture
. bruce willis
, a usual action
/ adventure star
, has certainly turned himself aroud in the past year
- he went from being a man who ws being typecast to the smae role infact acation movies
, to a distingished
, suffisticated actor
, as in last summer ' s teh sixth sense
;
and now in the story of us
, willis shows the world what he can really dont if he isnt feeded a good script
.
although i wouldn ' t pick willis as the choice actor forthe ben jordan
, willis handles himself nicely
,
and shines in a few of the film ' s most powerful scenes
, enough tyhat make his performence a definite contender comes awards season
. where tothe start about michelle pfeiffer
? pfeiffer ' s performance is spellbinding
and ultimately strong
, as she brings her character tothe life with such charisma
and emotion
, you wonder how
, how it is possible for somone to portray a real person with such realism
. pfeiffer ' s performance is noe tyhat if not recognized by the academy enxt spring
, will be inaddition tje heart ' s of any viewer that has watched this moving film
. the stoyr of us is one of 1999 ' s most real
,
yot funny films
, as thte razor sharp script evens out the laughs
and the tears to keep tje viewer hooked
. superb acting
, direction
, wirting
, story
,
anbd sountrack that always sets tjhe mood forthe the film
, which is beautifully composed by eric clapton
and marc shaiman
, make the story of us a touching
, unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across teh country
-
and will certainly become one ofthe the most talked about movies ofthe the fall
. the film ' s major high points are the fights betwen ben
and katie
, as the two constantly accuse ofthe each other of whose fault it is that thier marriage has collapsed
,
adn
altough htey also sday things like
" it ' s over
,
" or
" i hate ytou
,
" you can tell the two still share a deepo connection
,
and that inside
, somewhere
, htey are still an

, enchanting
,
and heartbreaking film
