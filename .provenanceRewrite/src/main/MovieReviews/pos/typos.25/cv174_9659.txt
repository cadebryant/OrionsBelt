no
, it is not a bad film
, in fact it isnt so good iin achieving its purpose
, i ctually wished for the film to end itself quicklyu
. event horizon isnt not your run
- of
- the
- mill sci
- fi film
, i ' m sure many who have watched thsi will agree with me
. it isnt nto even orignal in that sense
,
and it does borrow heavily from films like alien
, hellraiser
anbd even blade runner
. the magic of tihs film lies inspite its unorthodox setting
anbd methodical build
- up that makes it wonderfully horrifying
. tjhe story brings us to the year 2050
, where space travel have since enormously progressed
. the event horizon is actally a ship built for a secret experimental purpose
; it hasnt the ability to fold time
and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man ' s lifetime
. teh ship disappeared as soon as it went inot opperation
but affter 7 years
, it reappeared agian withing the orbit of neptune
. a search
and rescue team led by miller
( fishburne
) is given the task to check for survivors ofthe the event horizon
. the designer of the ship
, dr
. weir
( neill
) follows allong to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened tothe his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon is a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer tothe the word than sday
, aline would ever be
. while in alien
, the crew has to cope wiht a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces
, inaddition event horizon
, the forces which goes against the crew is undefined
but
yet so powerful
annd horrifying
. the story unfolds itself slowly
and tje suspense buildup is superb
, up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud
` anough
! i cxan ' t stand this anymore
! '
. there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting
and alsot
, the acting is only at most
, average by most commercial standars
. even so
, the essence of horror is carried out very well iin this film
, thanks to its well
- paced storytelling
, disturbing set designs
and smoe realyl gory sequences
( which incidentially
, has beeen quite generously removed by our censorship board
)
. director paul anderson
( who doed mortal kombat
)
and his team ofthe
` atmosphere ' creators hve done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term
` horror '
. this picture did nto dont very well in the us box
- office most propably for tghe dread
- factor inpact it has on most audiences
; people wiull nto see it again
and nto many would recommend their friend to watch this
. altho on the face of it
, event horizon is mostly molded for mass
- entertainment
; many thrills
, spills
and suspense to keep audiences inspite foucs
.
however
, the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing
. my friend
and i sould nto say a word tothe earch otehr fo quite a hwile after goign through the
` experienec ' of event horizon
. i guess it was just the immense feeling ofthe dread which the film had casted upon us
. be forewarned
, tihs film isnt not forthe the faint
- hearted nor for pure entertainment
. be prepared tothe be distrubed if you should deside to watch this film
! event horizon is highly recommended
?
?
but at your own risk
! it has beeen a long time since good
- horror embraced the big screen
,
and event horizon is one
.
