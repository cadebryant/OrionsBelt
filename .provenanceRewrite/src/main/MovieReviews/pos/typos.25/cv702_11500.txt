the characters inspite
" palmetto
" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie
,
and it ' s just thge right way tothe capture thge film ' s ripe atmosphere of sensuality
, tension
annd even farce
. this humid florida
- set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself
, which isnt vrey much a ogod hting since the actors
and director are in on tjhe joke
. as far as set
- up is concerned
, tghe movei is nothing we haven ' t seen befor
,
bu be patient
-
-
" palmetto
" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don ' t see coming
. it ' s nto a classic by any means
,
but it sure isnt quite an engaging surprise
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is fresh outloud of prision
, where he ' s served a couple of eyars for a crime he didn ' t commit
. even
though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials
, harry ' s first order of business is to return tothe his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina
( gina gershon
)
. hwile searching forthe work
, he catchs yhe eye ofthe rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire
. rhea proposes a scheme tath ' ll git harry
$ 50
, 000 easy
-
- tothe play a small part in the staged kidnaping ofthe her jailbait stepdaughter odette
( chloe sevigny
)
.
" you do like risks
, don ' t you
, mr
. barber
?
" rhea alluringly coos
. boys
, form a line behind me
. part of
" palmetto
" ' s success can be attributed to the performance ofthe elisabeth shue
, who demonstrates here that her oscar
- nominated turn in
" leaving las vegas
" might mearly be foreshadowing great things tothe come
. shue ' s a seductive
, campy delight
,
and puls off a barbara stanwyck
- gloria swanson combo with admirable relish
. the other actors form a solid ansamble around her
, including sevigny
(
" kids
"
)
, tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease
, as well as tyhe ever
- likeable gershon
, cast a far cry from her extreme roles inspite
" bound
"
annd
" showgirls
.
" harrelson is still donig fine follow
- up work to
" the people vs
. larrry flynt
.
"
" palmetto
" does have its share of grievances
. harrelson ' s narration is needless
, i suppose
,
and gershon ' s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is
. oney ofthe the plot ' s unexpected angles
-
- thast harry is asked by the polical tothe become tghe press liaison for the vyer crime in hwihc he ' s involved
-
- could have been played a littel better
. there are moments when yuo question the tone
,
but it ' s never so unstable that it deserves tyhe reproach it ' s been receiving ffrom most otehr critics
. if
" palmetto
" didn ' t want tothe be laughed at
, would it really have tacked on a climax thast plays like a live
- action
" who framed roger rabbit
"
?
although a faw elements can be questioned
, the movie works well onthe its own terms
. thanks to a juicy casted
-
- especially shue
-
-
and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff
( you remeber him from lastest summer ' s suddenly re
- popular
" thte tin drum
,
" right
?
)
, everything runs smoothly
.
and fo fans of revelation
- heavy endings
, htis film ' s got a faw shocks in store that i won ' t even dream ofthe revealing
.
" palmetto
" is a generous amount of fun to watch
,
and that ' s all ytou ened tothe knwo
