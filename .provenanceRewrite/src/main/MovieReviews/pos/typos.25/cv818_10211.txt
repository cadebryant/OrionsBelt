it has beeen threee long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival ' s palme d ' or
, a
$ 100 millon
- plus box office gross
,
and an oscar nomination
? all for his sophomore outing
, pulp fiction
. since
then
, the talented film maker hasnt been virtually inivsible
, surfacing briefly as a co
- directer of the wildly uneven four rooms
adn the screenwriter ofthe the gory vampire
- fest
, from dusk till dawn
. in between
, he has moonlighted as an
" actro
" with severeal decidedly unmemorable performances
. now
, withthe much fanfare
and anticipation
, tarantino has returned with his thrid directorial effort
, jackie brown
.
adn
, hwile this motion picture
, adapted from elmore leonard ' s novel
, rum punch
, offers solid entertainment
, thsoe expecting anohter bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed
. for tghe most part
, jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie
. the story
, whcih starts out slowly
, develops into a twisty affair
, wih double
- crosses
and triple
- crosses
.
anbd the movei is littered with occassional tarantino trademarks
: witty dialogue
, unexpected gunfire
, ' 70s pop tunes
,
and close
- ups ofthe womens ' bare feet
.
yet
, forthe all of thast
, the production isnt something ofthe a letdown
. the sheer
, inthe
- your
- face exuberance that marked reservor dogs
anbd especialy pulp fiction is absent
. tjhe mostly
- straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn ' t match uv favorably to the non
- linear style ofthe tarantino ' s previous efforts
? an approach that added tension
and edginess to the narratives
.
annd there aren ' t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around
. ther ' s a samuel l
. jackson monologue about guns
, a jackson
/ chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk
,
and a jackson
/ robert de niro exchange tht recalls some of the jackson
/ travolta material from pulp fiction
,
but that ' s about it
. jackie brown ' s lone
" innovation
" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three differant perspectives
. this isn ' t exactlly an original technique
? it has been done numerous times befoer
, most famously infact akira kurosawa ' s rashomon
anbd most recently in edward zwick ' s courage under frie
.
however
, hwile in those two movies
(
and others
)
, ther wass a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points
- of
- view
, tarantino ' s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it ' s unconvential
. hadnt the scenes iin question been shown from only one of the three vantages
, nothing would have been lost
. as a result
, this aspect ofthe the film is little mroe than a curiosity
. for the second picture in a row
, tarantino is attempting to revive the career ofthe a ' 70s icon
. this time around
, instead of john travolta
, it ' s blaxploitation queen pam grier
( foxy brown has become jackie brown
)
. in oen of many nods to the most famouse segment ofthe grier ' s career
, tarantino uses a ' 70s song tothe accompany her first apprearance during the opening credits
. htere are also severeal instances druing jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towords certain conventions of tje blaxploitation genre
(
altough grier never does any butt
- kicking
)
. grier is jackie brown
, a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs
and moey inot the united states
. she ' s wroking for gun dealer ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
,
but she keesh her mouth shut under questioning
, despite presure from ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, a federal official
. no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie
, ordell arranges fo a bail bondsman
, max cherry
( robert forster
, tv ' s
" banyon
"
) to post the necessary
$ 10
, 000
,
then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal
. jackie passes ordell ' s test
,
however
,
and soon tjhe two of them are plotting a way to smuggle
$ 500
, 000 of ordell ' s money inot hte untied states without tipping off the feds
. soon
, just baout everyone isnt after tath money
, includng jackie
, max
, ray
, ordell ' s perpetually oversexed
adn drugged
- out girlfriend
, melanie
( bridget fonda
)
,
and his right
- hand man
, louis
( robert de niro
)
. unsurprisingly
, the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l
. jackson
,
but ordell isn ' t nearly as invigorating or compelling a charactor as jules ffrom pulp fiction
. inaddition adition to looking fantastic
, pam grier is also quite ogod
,
although hers is not an oscar
- caliber performance
(
although she might get a nomination
)
. robert forster
and michael keaton are solid inwhich theri tough
- guys
- who
- rarely
- smile roles
. bridget fonda is around fo three discernible reasons
: tothe look sexy in a bikini
, to provide a littel twisted comedy
,
and to satisfy tarantino ' s foot fetish
. robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could hve beeen palyed equally well by any grungy
- looking
, middle
- aged actor
. the film
, which clocks in at severeal minutes over teh two
-
and
- a
- half hour mark
, is probably too long for the material
,
but the plot isnt convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughtout
(
allthough yhe payoff is a letdown
)
. tarantino keeps things moving along nicely
, with a heavier dose ofthe humer
annd less violentce than inthe pulp fiction
,
but
, on yhe whole
, this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from tjhe director himselv
. when it comes to recent caper films
( liuke the grifters
and bound
)
, jackie brown is a second
- tier effort
. it ' s an entertaining diversion
,
but not a masterpiece
,
adn certainly not an oscar contender
.
