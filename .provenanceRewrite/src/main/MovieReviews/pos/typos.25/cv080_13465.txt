just how inseperable is the team of sgt
. martin riggs
( mel gibson
)
and sgt
. roger murtaugh
( danny glover
)
? let ' s jsut sday tyhat when one partner asks yhe otehr partner to strip tothe his boxer shorts
and
then further asks him tothe run out into the middle of the road
, flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction
, his partner ctually doesnt it
! the familiar leathal weapon familiy is back
, including rene russo
, who is now the expectant mother of riggs ' child
and joe pesci as the soprana
- like
, foul
- mouthed former accountant who has desided to become a private eye
. new to the team is chris rock
, also a fast
- tlaking
, uv
and coming detective
. trouble seems to folow the two veteran detectives where ever tehy go
,
and iin this film
, thgat is noone exception
. even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride
, they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship
. we here smoe ominous music
, wich clues us that a confrontation is baout to happen
. gunfire ensues
,
and when it ' s all over
, the detectives want tothe leran more baout this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord
.
although they don ' t know what tehy ' re looking for
, their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some acation
.
and there ' s plenty of action here for two movies
. led by fighting sensation jet li
, whose martial arts skill is nothing less tahn impressive
, he does what he can to make sure that no one finds outloud whta they are up tothe
. li is ruthless inaddition his approach
, will kill anyone just to make a point
,
adn develops enormous disdain forthe the twpo detectives
. ther are terific car chases
, explosions
and gunshot galore
. it ' s a summer action recipe followed to the letter
,
and thge result is nothing less tahn pure
, unadulterated summer fun
.
bu even too many explosions can get boring
. to counter that
, we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li
. luckily
, he ' d rather fight hand
- to
- hand instade of firing off guns
. meanwhile
, when the detectives aren ' t reloading their guns or runing from fireballs
, htey ' re engaged in sophomoric banter
anbd silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail ofthe bullets
. everybody gets in onthe the shtick
. russo screams during her delivery
, the crime lord has a fewd funny bits when he ' s being interrogated hwile being given laughing gas
,
and pesci
and rock are very funny as htey go at it discusting tghe drawbacks of having cellular phones
. gibson
and glover are always in sync
adn the film moves at a brisk pace to git to the final
and terrific mano a mano
. score one for tje old guard
