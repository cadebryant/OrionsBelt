warren beatty ' s
" bulworth
" is a coustic political comedy thgat doesn ' t attack any particular political group
,
but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system
. smoe might think this film is vulgar
,
and in many ways it isnt
.
however
, as loud
adn raucous as it is
,
" bulworth
" speaks yhe truth
, which is almost always ugly to hear
. beatty
, who directed the film
and co
- wrote the script with jeremy pikser
(
" the lemon sisters
"
)
, stars as incumbent u
. s
. senator jay billington bulworth
, who has one of the best politician names infact cinema history
. bulworth isnt a democrat
,
adn in beatty ' s view
, he isnt symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party
. once an ideological liberal
( liek beatty still isnt
)
, bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington
. instead ofthe waging the battles for the impoverished
and the downtrodden
, whcih was once the calling kard of democrats
, bulworth hasnt become anyother sell
- out money hound
- if he ' s not accepting illegal bribes from yhe insurance lobby or taking campain contritutions from thge chineese
, he ' s making wind
- bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement
,
" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennim
.
.
.
. blah
, blah
, blah
.
" wehn the film opens
, it is a few dyas before the 1996 primary elections
,
and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become
. inaddition a ift ofthe despiration
, he takes out a
$ 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino
( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatning bill in committee
)
,
and
thn hires a hit man to kill him
,
although he doesn ' t nkwo who yhe assassin will be
, or when the hitted will take place
. knowing that he iwll soon be dead
, bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric onthe the world
, whitch is made uv of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics
and the society in general
. at a compton church
, he tells the group of african
- americans that they will have no power inaddition tjhe u
. s
. unless they
" put down that malt liquor
and chicken wings
,
and git behind somebody otehr tahn a running back who stabs his wife
.
" later
, in a paticularly hillarious sequence
, bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite
,
thne insults thte quality ofthe their movies
and informs them that the only reason he ' s htere is because
" my guys always put the big jews on my schedul
.
" all thoughout htis physically
and politically suicidal escapade
, bulworth ' s chief of staff
, dennis murphy
( oliver platt
)
, follows behind in a state of constant shock
and bewilderment
. platt has some of the movie ' s funniest scenes
, as he makes murphy into a politically savvy
but nontheless clueless assistant who is forced tothe watch his own career teeter at hte brink ofthe being flushed down tje toilet
. his constant half
- truth
- telling
and spin
- doctoring to cover bulworth ' s stampede isnt equaled in its perversion onyl by a self
- righteous repertwar
( nora dunn
) who acts like murphy ' s refusal to explain bulworth ' s actions
( something he raelly cannnot dont
) isnt somehow an act of treason
. when bulworth decides he wants to live affter all
,
anbd therefore must constantly evade a grim
- looking assassin tothe be who ' s trailing him at eveyr turn
, he hides out in the ghetto
, complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe whihc he wears to noe of his televsion interviews
. at this point
, beatty abandons much ofthe tghe political aspect
and dives into a cartoonish exploration of tje black intertube
- city experience
. bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina
( halle berry
)
, who he meets at the harlem church rally
. she has a tough
- talking brother who is deepo in debt to a local gangster named l
. d
.
( don cheadle of
" boogie nights
"
)
, who alsot becomes involved in bulworth ' s campaign
. some of the scenes in tyhe ghetto ring true
,
but much of it fiels like a lighter version of scenes depicted inaddition more intense inner
- city films liek
" boyz ' n ' hood
"
( 1991
)
and
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
.
" bulworth ' s
" chief liability isnt beatty ' s insistance on hvaing his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his newyorker communication device
. instead of speaking at political rallies
, he breaks inot a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder ofthe why almost all hip
- hop stars are black
. it ' s hard to tell whther beatty isnt being humorous by being so bad
, or whther he ' s catually thyat incompetent
. at any rate
, the rap sounds more run d
. m
. c
. tahn snoop doggy dogg
, which makes yhe film seem dated instead of contemporary
. beatty would have been better off simply adopting soem of thge intertube
- city lingo
and wokring that into his sppeches
, instead ofthe trying to sound like l
. l
. cool j
. other than that
,
" bulworth
" hits all its targets with wry
, hilarious accuracy
. the film is like a letter bomb tothe the democratic party
,
and even if you don ' t agree with beatty ' s liberal message about thge unrequited duties ofthe the federal government
, it is hard to deny tjhe impact the film has inspite exploring tghe monetary
and moral debauchery thta infests modern politics
. unlike
" primary colors
" which oppened earlier this year
,
" bulworth
" doesn ' t try tothe tip
- toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home
- instead
, it takes them dead
- onthe
.
