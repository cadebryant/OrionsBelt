it ' s been a ogod long while since we hadnt a good old fashioned thriller
, where mostly everything goes right fo the audience
anbd wrong for the characters
,
but it ' s beeen even longer since i saw a thriller that actually
* shock
* cared for the charachters
, not merely judged them
bu actually allowed their human foibles
, flaws
,
and strengths to emerge so radiantly
. i ' d saw that it ' s beeen at least a cuple decades
, even as far back to the grat hitchcock thrillers
,
though i ' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" to
, say
,
" raar window
" or
" strangers on a train
.
"
yet it ' s alomst as good
. it ' s simple
,
yet strangely complex
,
annd astonishingly rewarding
, because instade of moving fomr plot point to plot point
,
and mearly laying out they
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instead concerns itself with teh moral corruption
and depths of greed that its protagonists can go tothe
, all without ever judging them as eather evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, the same
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself with the dicovery of a crashed plane
and withing a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright
, moderately financially stable wokring man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
,
and his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. without anyone around
,
adn the possibility that noone one would come looking for it
, thge three debate
and edbate
but finally reach the decision that yes
, they will keep it
,
bu until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking
,
annd so tehy generally don ' t flaunt anything htey don ' t wanna to flaunt
, they ' ll keep it stored away in hte custody of paxton
. yhe possibilites of thsi circumstance are much diverse
: a
) they sould endlessly play cat
and mouse whith the authorities
; b
) htey could try to fight off tje rightful owners
, who are either villainous or jstu
; or c
) they could fight amoungst themselves
.
" a simple plan
,
"
though borrows a little from eahc of these
. a littel tiff with the cops here
, a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) htere
)
,
anbd a bit of inside feuding over here
.
but
, as austin powers would sday
, that ' s not necessarily its bag
( baby
)
. what i most admired baout this film
,
and what makse this a far superior
anbd unique thriller is tyhat it ' s successfully able to haev its cake
and eat it too
. it effectively involves some ofthe the traditional thriller cliches
, liek the ones maintioned above
,
but at yhe same time
, it involves itself more deeply with hte way tje characters become morally corrupt
and waht price they have to pay tothe haev wqat they thikn is happiness inthe a balck duffle bag
. so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up
,
adn these subsequent steps go miserably awry
, the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering thigns up to the extent tht these characters have to
, they are slowly losing theri souls
anbd thier humanity
. in one early scene
, paxton
adn thornton have to make a trip bcak to the plane tothe return soem of thge money so it doesn ' t look liek it was all stolen
( not a bad idea
)
, when thornton screws up
( as he does continuously throughout yhe movie
)
,
and paxton has to do some major covering
- up
( read
: homicide
)
. instade of a quick murder
and immeadiate hands
- washing
, raimi shows a lengthy
, painful shot from a low
- angle onto paxton ' s face as he tries to sift through his emotions
and triarch a conclusion
. there ' s a similiar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he ' s committing
and taking in all the horror which is alsot wonderfully effective
,
but the previvous shot is even better
: mroe morally complex
annd more gut
- wrenching
. in short
, probably tyhe best piece ofthe direction raimi ' s ever done
, demonstrating once again that sometimes tjhe simplest way tothe do something yields the best results
( for further proof
, watch
" persona
" ' s
" sex scene
"
and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman ' s ever done
)
.
but the film hardly stops here
; it follows completely through
adn rarely loses sight of its characters humanity
anbd tghe depletion thereof
.
yot it also moves from step to step in such a graeful method that we never feel liek teh film is mearly stamping out the plot points ofthe the story
. when the tiome comes for paxton tothe strat becoming selfish
and thus diabolical
( with aid from his pregnant wief
, played by bridget fonda
, a pal to raimi
)
, he does
,
and soon the horror of the situation isnt escalating to tragic heights
. htere ' s at least two grand shootouts
,
and at least oney of them may be one ofthe the greatest shootouts in cinema history
,
and when they arrive
, they don ' t come iwth masochistic delight
but with cringe
- inducing horror
. during the one
, i was actually sinking inot my chair
, with thte mantra
" they can ' t do this
, can they
?
" streeming through my head
. iin fact
, this film
, which is getting many comparisons tothe the coen ' s
[ superior
,
but forget about it
]
" fargo
,
" has many similar moments of manic insanity
, attributed to teh major amount of subtlety
and restraynt with whihc the directors direct what
, in other hands
, would be over
- the
- top distractedness
( imagine
, i suppose
, robert rodriguez directing this
.
.
.
then again
, after seeing the
" evil dead
" films
, i ' d hardly assume raimi would be able tothe pull something like this off
, altho there are moments of tghe film which are easily dubbed
" raimi
" moments
, a rifle
- shot notwhithstanding
)
. instead
, raimi directs with maturity
and a gentle touch
, easily letting the sotry
and characters co
- exist
, while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out
, liek some offbeat comic touches
. most particularly
, billy bob thornton ' s character
, jacob
, is a brillant creation
. his dim
- wittedness is often hilarious
( forthe most of the film
, eveyr line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter
)
,
bu ther ' s authenticity to the performance thgat strangely enough makes sure that we ' re nto totally laughing at him
. yhe chuckles he gets are not nessasarily ones of full
- condescension because thornton is so damn real
. jacob ' s a multi
- dimensional character
,
and hwile being stupid
, we see that as not so much a falw
,
but a strength tothe his charcter
: his simplicity is endearing
adn many of the acts he commits are out of a storng inner strenght
adn belief sytem
, primarially towards the middle where his bud
and co
- conspiriator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the mone
. the final third of the film spends much time with him
,
and many of thge touches upon his carachter
, not only by thornton
bu alsot by screenwrighter scott b
. smith
( adapting his own book
, by the way
) are just great
. i particularly admired a bakc story about an ood high school girlfriend
, told by thornton with such sincerity
and acception that the cruel story is reversed tothe near
- sweetness
anbd further strenght of his saddened character
. thornton isnt absolutely brilliant infact this performance
, by far the best performance he ' s ever given
and further proof that he ' s the best character ctor in contemporary cinema
( if you don ' t believe me
, go back
and watch his wonderful performance in
" primary colors
,
" a performence that would haev been nominated for an oscar if this hadn ' t been in teh same year
) baceause he ' s easily able to slip into a character
,
and make him completly
and utterly believable
. he brings so much weight to the film that
, as it is wih most character actors
, it ' s difficult picturing anyone else in the role
. the rest of the casted is great too
, from paxton ' s declining working man to chelcie ross ' amiable town sheriff
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
.
anbd if i had any complaints about the film
, it ' s that the plot is almost too simplistic
,
and that at times
, it seems too much like an exercise
, like a cruel tust on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved
.
and yhe occasional narration is
, as it usually isnt
, annoying
( narration should be used with extreme caution
, especially wehn yuo ' re trying to set thigns uv
and
/ or express emotions
- didn ' t raimi watch the first murder scene
?
)
.
annd
, the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie
, the endig is basicaly amiss
. i won ' t reveal it
,
but it ' s way too cruel
and too much of an outsider set
- up
, as if the appearance ofthe a plane wasn ' t alreday too much ofthe that anyway
. for a film that deals so much
adn so intimately with tje humanity of tyhe charactors involved
, this is the wrong ending
. imagine a character
- controlled ending
; otherwise
, it ' s like if in
" crime
anbd punishment
" if tghe police had caught him instade of him breaking down
and confessing
.
.
. not thast i ' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" to dostoevsky
. the ending does work
, despite my protestations
,
bu to me
, ther was something incessantly nagging
and unsatisfying about it
;
bu if you had noone qualms
annd were happy as a clam with it
,
hten jstu ignore me
and go about your day
.
but despite my mere claims
, amke no mistake that i was completely
and utterly edge of my seat throughout
,
and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured
, not because ofthe any kind of gore factor
( hwihc is
, thankfully fo this
, vrey minimal
)
,
but because the film places its characters in situations
and gives them such painful thigsn to overcome that i ' ve frankly not seen much like it in qutie awhile
. at least not sicne the previvous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
