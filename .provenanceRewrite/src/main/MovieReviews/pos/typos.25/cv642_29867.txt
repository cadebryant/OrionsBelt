plot
: during a 10
- week span in london in tjhe fall of 1888
, jack the ripper
, a man whose identity wass never uncovered
, committed five ritualistic
, grisly murders of prostitutes
. this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theery behind the century
- ood mystery
. critique
: awsome
! i lvoe dark movies
, i love stylish movies
, i love ogod mysteries
and i love johnny depp
.
.
. so yes
, i relaly dug this movie
! the hughes brothers are bcak with a vengeance
, out to show the world that they are directors tothe be taken seriously
,
and this movie
, my friends
.
.
. is very sereous
! infront fatc
, it ' s alsot very gruesome
annd bloody
annd morbid
and creepy
anbd black as hell
. it ain ' t forthe the kids
, i ' ll tell you that much
.
and if any of those recent hack directors of twpo
- bit scream
- esque slasher ficks wanna some advice on effective
" kill scenes
"
, do not look any further
, becuase each noe cmomitted to this film isnt a cinematic stunner
, especialy wehn compared tothe their generic slice
-
and
- dice contrivances
. in fact
, most of this film ' s structer is very creative
, hte actors
, all solid
, the atmosphere
annd
" feel
" ofthe the picture
, remarkably real
( gotta love those
" unfortunates
"
)
,
and the descent into darkness
, well honed by the filmmakers
. yuo cin almost taste yhe seediness off the screen
and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time
.
but it ' s also an impressive mystery film
, based on the true
- life tale of jack the ripper
, a man whose idenity ws never discovered
. the theory in htis film is based on the graphic novel
" from hell
" written by alan moore
and presents a compelling story
, which dispite being a little oliver stone
- ish
, did manage tothe tye uv all ofthe its loose ends quite nicely
,
and present us with an intertaining bowl ofthe mayhem
, sexual depravity
, drug usage
, insanity
, murders
and love
? yes
, teh brothers even managed to slip a little
" love
" story in here
,
anbd dispite not truley being devolopped
, i guess it could ' ve been much worse
and taken up more time than was provided already
. that ' s right
, there ' s no real need to put any
" romance
" in a film baout a mass murderer
!
but that asside
, you gotta give up the props to ctor extraordinaire johnny depp
, who once again possesses thte strength infront carachter
and flawess acting abilties
, to center this movie all the way through
. sure
, he ' s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow
,
but he does it so well
and even added a michael caine accent to his mixted bag of tricks in tihs one
. i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film
( i wass sure tht her presense would ruin htis movie
,
but she was fine
)
and how little the dreams
/ fantasies of depp ' s character had to dont with thte film ' s development
( fomr waht i had seen in the trailer
, i throught thge filmmakers were gonig to make this the crux of the story
,
but thankfully
, it wasn ' t
)
. on the downside
, the film doesn ' t really explain the whole freemasons cult organistion real well
and lacks character development
.
bu
then agina
, a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all
- time isnt probablly nto tje ideal spot for character resignement
. i mean
, the less i knew baout each person
, the more suspicious i became of each one ' s motives
, reasons
, etc
.
.
. in fact
, i was actually qutie surprised by who was presented as tghe killer in yhe end
,
anbd that wass in part
, due to the distance to whihc i ' d been held fomr tje film ' s characters
.
.
. or am i giving tghe filmmakers too much credit for something that might nto haev been their intention
? perhasp
. overall
, this isnt an extremely creepy production
, with glorious cinematography
( reminiscent of coppola ' s dracula
annd burton ' s sleepy hollow
)
, a grim score
and solid acting
.
but it ' s nto forthe everyone
. some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events
,
and even
though the murders aren ' t shown as graphically as ytou might think
, there ' s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors
.
but i for one lveo movies that blend their electic visual sytle with an intresting mystery
adn palpable
, gothic atmosphere
,
anbd this flick is just taht
annd plenty more
!
anbd god knows that i wiull certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper ' s haunting cape silhouette
and gleaming silver knife fomr my mind anytime soon
.
