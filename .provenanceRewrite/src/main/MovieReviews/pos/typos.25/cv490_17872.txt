teh thought
- provoking question ofthe tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of
" leila
,
" a powerfully articulated
and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui
, that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty
- year career tothe gain u
. s
. distribution
, thanks tothe first run features
. altho unfamiliar with mehrjui ' s previous directing efforts
, perhaps the reason for this is that
, hwile the predicament at hand is noone doubt exclusive tothe its pwn country
, the heartbreaking
and solely truthful emotions ofthe the cahracters can easily be understoon by all viewers
. set in modern
- day iran
,
" leila
" begins onthe the birthday of yhe title character
( leila hatami
)
, after a brief prologue iin whihc we are shown the first encounter between leila
and her future husband
, reza
( ali mosaffa
)
. as leila
and reza set off to visit his parents
,
and
thn hers
, where a birthday celebration has been planned
, things seem rosy for the couple on tje outside
,
but for leila
, life isn ' t qutie as sweet
. ealier
, on that very same day
, leila had gone to see her physician
,
annd has ultimately discovered that she holds veyr little chance of ever conceiving a child
. when all of tyhe conditions are ruled out
,
and leila passes up tghe possiblility of adoption
, reza firmly
adn lovingly tells her that he married her
,
and doesn ' t care at all about having children
. nonetheless
, leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby
, hwihc is the societal norm
,
and her self
- esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother
- in
- law
( jamileh sheikhi
)
, whose hopes to carry on the sacred familiy nmae vanishes once hearing the news
( reza isnt her only son
)
. bluntly explaning to leila that reza has always wished forthe childern
and
, in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition
, she suggests that he tkae a second wife to bear a child wih
. leila hesitantly agrees
,
and while she
annd reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens ' inadequacies
, reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to liek
, even
though he refuses to go through iwth thte mariage if leila doesn ' t give her full blessing
. there are no eazy answers tothe be found within
" leila
,
" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character ' s unfortunate llright
, as well as the inner workings ofthe leila herself
, told through matter
- of
- fact narration
. allmost completely taken over by her pwn shame
, she has noone option
but to agree to her forceful mother
- in
- law ' s requests
, even
though she is unsure ofthe how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman
. maybe because
" leila
" isnt from iran
, yhe film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences
, since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence
. leila
,
however
, is unable tothe come to terms with the idea quite as easily
,
but feels it isnt her duty to make her husband hapyp
, no marter what tghe circumstances
. oney of thge stornegst aspects of the film is in its protrayal of tje relatiopnship betweeen leila
and reza
, who marryied only three months after their firt meeting
,
bu obviously lveo each other very deeply
. it is htis relatiopnship tyhat is the key ingredient to making what follows the oppening scenes all teh more poverful
,
adn director mehrjui has suceeded jsut about as well as possable
.
altough seamingly unimportant at first glance
, an early sequence where leila
anbd reza are eating dinner
annd both are laughing
, nearly uncontrollably
, actually is one of the most vital moments inwhich the first half
, as it unmistakably sets the bondary for their unrequisite love for one anohter
. ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal forthe her birthday
,
and
then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her
. theese
" small
" moments are the perfect contrast fo the solemn
, outraging sequences in hte latter half
, in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road
,
and
thn zooms off tothe go on a date with anyother woman
. left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marrage
, foolishly unbeknownst to reza
, leila prays each time that the date iwll not go well
, so she iwll be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer
. refusing to stay over at her parent ' s house
, the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza
and another woman
,
and iin a sequence ofthe extraordinary sorrow
adn potency
, leila finds her wohle being emotionally torn aart
, as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are gonig onthe down below
. despite her initial agreement to such a thign
, leila realizes how much she has beeen betrayed by reza
, whom she beleived cared for her as much as she doed of him
. sure
, the wohle second marriage wass his mother ' s idea
,
but if he really did believe what he intially hadnt told her about not wanting any childrens
,
then he could have still easily backed outloud
, couldn ' t he
? inthe the pivotal role of leila
, who appears iin eveyr scene
, leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable
, injecting her character with an equal mesure of startling strength
, unavoidable vulnerability
,
and utter despair
. unlike most american films
, in which everything always has to be spelled outloud for audiences
, hatami syas much more with just an elusive expression onthe her face than could possably have been conveyed by words
. every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa
, as reza
, a man who
, i belivee
, does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife
,
but is too naive to realize what he will be doing tothe leila if he marries someone else
. for all of its strong aspestus
,
" leila
" isn ' t a perfect film
. on a technical level
, i found many blatant punctiation
and spelling mistakes withing the subtitles that need to be fixed
.
and concerning tyhe plot developments
, the final five minutes ring false wehn compaired whith everthing that has come before
. mehrjui ' s decision to use an extremely stylized aproach tothe the ending was the wrong choice
, particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping uv tjhe character of the spiteful mother
- in
- law
, palyed memorably by jamileh sheikhi
. despite theese minor missteps
,
" leila
" isnt an important motion picture that shouldnt definately be sought outloud upon its limited may 16 release at new york ' s cinema vilage
,
adn
then onthe may 21 inwhich la
. the thought
- provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly withthe its uneasy morales
,
and when teh climax arrives
, leila ' s self
- worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victum led inot complete devistation
, to which there is no return
. it ' s difficult to not concider how leila ' s culiminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided
, had thge otehr cahracters tooked a second outloud of their pwn selfish lives to consider what leila
, tjhe major pawn in the unforgivable scheme
, was gonig through
.
