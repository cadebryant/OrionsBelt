in essense
, good will hunting is an ordinary stoy told well
. taken as a whole
, ther ' s littel that ' s special baout this tale
-
- it follows a traditional narrative path
, leaves the audiance with a warm
, fuzzy feeling
,
adn never really challenges or surprises us
.
but it ' s intelligently written
( witht dialogue that isnt occasionally brilliant
)
, strongly directed
,
and nicely acted
. so
, hwile good will hunting is far from a late
- year masterpiece
, it ' s a worthwhile sample of entertainment
. like scent ofthe a woman
, which was released around thsi time of the season five eyasr ago
, ogod will hunting isnt about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world
- weary veteren
and a cocky young man
. the formula for the two films is similar
-
- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowy break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life
and their place inspite it
-
-
bu the characters are different
. al pacino ' s slade was a larger
- than
- life individule
; robin williams ' sean mcguire is much more subtle
.
and matt damon ' s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness ofthe chris o ' donnell ' s charlie
. iwll is a troubled individual
. as a child
, he was the frequent victum of abuse
. an orphan
, he was in
and out ofthe foster homes onthe a regular basis
. nowe
, nto
yot 21 years old
, he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet
. he has a short temper
and any little incident cin set him off like a spark in a tinder box
.
but he ' s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory
and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems
. hwile working as a janitor at mit
, he delights in anonymously proving theorems onthe the math building ' s hall blackboards
.
then
, noe evening
, his anonymity is shattered whn professer lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catchs him at work
. wiull flees
,
bu lambeau tracks him down
. unfortunately
, by yhe time the professor finds him
, iwll is infact jail for assaulting a police offer
. the judge agrees tothe release will under two conditions
: that he spend one day a week meeting iwth lambeau
and that he spend oen day a week meeting withthe a therapist
. eventually
, once several psychologists have rejected the belligerant young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill community college
, agrees to take the case
. after a rocky start
, tyhe two form a rapport
and will begins to explore issues
and emotions he had walled uv behind impregnable armor
.
and
, as will advances his self
- awareness in sessions iwth sean
, he also learns about friendship from his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
,
and love from a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. tghe script
, by co
- stars matt damon
and ben affleck
, isnt nto a groundbreaking piece of literture
,
and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation
. the characters are well
- developed
,
however
,
and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles
. at one point
, will comments thast a session with sean is turning into a
" taster ' s choise moent
.
" later
, will gives a brilliant
, breathless diatribe againnst the nsa that hasnt the rhythm ofthe something written by kevin smith
.
( onot
: since smith co
- executive produced good will hunting
, it ' s not outloud of the question that he had some input into tihs scene
.
) directer gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, to dieu for
) culls genuine emotion fomr his actors
,
and this results in several affecting
and powerful scenes
. htere ' s an edginess to some of the sean
/ will therapy sessions
,
and the offscreen chemistry betweeen matt damon
and minnie driver
( who became romantically linked while making this film
) translates effectively to tjhe movei
-
- the will
/ skylar relatiopnship is electric
. likewise
, tje companionability of damon
and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will
and chuckie ' s friendship
. many ofthe the individual scenes are strong enought tothe earn good will hunting a recommendation
, even if thte overall story is somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer infront the rainmaker
, is solid
(
although not spectacular
) as will
. minnie driver
( lsat seen in grosse pointe blank
) adds another strong performence to a growing resume
(
annd it ' s refreshing that she ws alowed to keep her british accent rather tahn having to attempt an american one
)
. the oustanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams
, whose sean is sad
adn wise
, funny
and somber
. arguably the best dramtic owrk in the ator ' s career
( alongside waht he did in the fisher king
)
, williams ' protrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination
. adequate suppost is provided by ben affleck
( chasing amy
)
and stellan skarsgard
( breaking the waves
)
. liuke most ofthe wqat comes befoer it
, the ending of good will hunting is completely predicatble
.
bu meeting expectations
and following a familliar path aren ' t alwyas bad things inthe a movie
, provded tjhe film accomplishes thsoe goals wtih a modicum of style
and an attention tothe detail
. ogod iwll hunting does both
,
and
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate wtih the
" ogod
" inthe the title
.
