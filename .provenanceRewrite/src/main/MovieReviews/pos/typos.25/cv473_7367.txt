a sci fi
/ comedy starring jack nicholson
, pierce brosnan
, annette benning
, glenn close
, martin short
and other stars
. a warner bros picture the martians hve landed in this hillarous tim burton movie
. befoer entering tje cinema
, i was initially a little bited nervous baout what this film would be like
. many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish
,
annd there wass no point to it all
. how wrong they weere
. i left this film feeling much happier tahn i was before i entered the cinema
. teh story isnt about martians attacking earth
. using ravy guns
( hooray
!
) they generally cause havoc around tghe u
. s
and other countries
. nicholson plays the rpesident who must try tothe stpo invasion
,
and also taking advice from his loopy officials
.
but
, basicly
, its a load ofthe set pieces showing the martians destroying earth
. tghe way people are killed by the ray guns is great
, they is a hillarous
(
and mildly disturbing scene
) involving a martian lady
, a mad general who jsut wants to nuke the aliens away
,
(
annd ends uv getting squashed by an aliens foot
)
and a gory finale involving lots ofthe alien heads exploding
.
bu
, most of all
, tihs film isnt fun
. the martians are full of character
, the performances are spot on
,
anbd the all star cast halp make the film more enjoyable
. the film isnt a millon times better
then thte dire independance day
,
adn isnt a real tribute to the tacky ' 50s invasion movies
. htey are is a great score by danny elfman
,
and lots of laughs
. this hasnt to be yhe best invasion i ' ve seen fo a long time
.
