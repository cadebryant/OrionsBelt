at frist glance
, threee kings looks to be just another war movie
, the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannnot remeber
. the 90s verison
, it definetly is
, just anohter war movei
? nto in your dreasm
! imagin pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan
, that
 s threee kings for ytou
. believe it or not
, it bears thge cool of the former
anbd teh stark humane meaning of the latter
. the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war
, wiht the allied troops victorious
. majpr archie gates
( clooney
) leads an enterprising bunch ofthe grunts tothe a rether unorthodox post
- war looting spree
; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed awya by saddam in a desolate village inaddition tghe desert
. as the rest of the troops are celebrating thier victory
and getting ready to be shipped home
, this
` wild bunch
 goes awol on an armed hum
- vee
( the vehicule of choice of the us army
)
. they soon find out that they have much resistance
, as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddam
 s forces
. frequently switching thier modes between looters
and robin hood
 s merry men
, they become conciously attacked by their own morals
. as the film beggins to roll
, it seemed tothe hvea a rether
` light
 mood to it
.
` speical
 effects such as when gates describes tothe his men how a bullet cin kill simply paves the way for a light
- hearted funny action movie
. three kings isnt much smarter thna tath
. as the conflict becomes more
and moreso complex
, thte audience will be trapped in a limbo
, trying to stay focussed on tyhat light
- mood
/ serious
- mood thta thte film seem tothe protray
. i personally found this analagous to the same feelings of tje main charachters involved in the film
; trapped between thier initial plan paved by greed
and their own sence of humanity
. this simply made yhe entire experience of watching threee kings truley brilliant
. action sequences are not shot as your old
- fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielberg
 s inthe
- your
- face war violence
. they are carefully built to generate tension with jsut the right tight close
- ups
and pauses
, right before the action starts
. not john woo for sure
but more of sergio leone
 s spaghetti western style
( tons ofthe them starring clint eastwood
)
. great performances by clooney
adn wahlberg
but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film
; the screenwriter
adn the director
. three kings ranks among hte best films of tghe year
, well
, for me at least
. highly reccomended
.
