plot
: a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes
. he is tooked prisoner along with some otehr humans
,
anbd trys his best to escape his simian captors
. oh yeah
,
and did i mention thast the apes can talk
? kewl
! critique
: despite this film not looking liuke a
" tim burton movie
" or its lead human character showing any signs of bieng a human bieng hismelf
, i did find myself generally entertained throughout most ofthe this film
and do recommend it as fun
, summer fare
.
although the thing thyat sets this movie appart from all others isnt definitely its incredible ape amking
- up jobs
and characterizations
. i mean
, i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was forthe real
! i also have to
" give it up
" to all of tyhe actors inside the costumes
, nto only forthe waking up at three iin the morning every day tothe get make
- up slobbered all over them fo 2
- 4 hours
,
but for coming through their costumed exteriors
adn selling us their characters onthe tjhe screen as well
. i especially enjoyed bonham carter ' s performance
, who i believed to be the most developped charcter infront the entire film
( human or ape
)
and tim roth ' s bad guy
, who chewed up scenery
annd oozed evil inwhich eveyr scene iin which he took part
. plot
- wise
, i liked tjhe beginning ofthe the film
, the wohle build
- up once wahlberg got into the village
, the escape
and most of thge fight scenes
,
but once thnigs got out into tyhe deserted area
(
and the final battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bit of my interest
. i was much omre intrigued by the interactions between the charactors
and the whole idea of
" human beings as animals
"
then i wass baout the end battle sequence
, whic jstu seemed a bit too typical forthe thsi kind ofthe film
. i also hated tghe
" kid
" character who jsut got on my nerves
and didn ' t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved
( i won ' t ruin it here
but c ' mon guys
.
.
. you coulda thought of something a little mroe plausible than that
, no
?
)
.
but the thing that held this movei back more than anything else wass its lead character
, his cold demeanor
and the zero chemestry that he shared with either one of his inter
- species love interests
. this dude didn ' t seem tothe give a rat ' s ass about anyone
but hismelf
and i ultimately didn ' t really care about what happened to him either
. nowe i ' m not sure if tihs wass the fault of the actor or tyhe script
,
but tjhe film suffered because of it
. visually
, thte movie was also nice tothe look at
( especially the apes
!
)
,
but i definately expected greater coolness fomr tim burton
. the
" surprise endig
" that highlighted teh original planet of the apes film back in 1968
, falt a littel tacked on here
,
and despite being interesting
, didn ' t really mkea all thta much sense to me
( unless yuo look at it from a sequel point of veiw
)
. so overall
, i loved the hwole
" feel
" of the planet
, the apes that ruled it
, the manner in which tehy treated the humans
, screamed
, shouted
and reverted thte entire evolution chain
,
bu didn ' t appreciate hte film ' s lack of human character devolopment
( why was kris kristofferson even in this movei
?
)
and the fact that its lead male
and female humans were just plain boring
.
but i would still recommend this film as a fun
, summer movei with laughs
, creepiness
and a really cool premise
. ps
: forthe anyone who has seen tje original
, i cannot believe that they didn ' t at least bring bakc the scene in which the lead human character
( infront this case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at the world in whitch he ' s suddenly beeen thrust
(
" this is a mad house
!
"
- type ofthe thing
)
. tyhe guy in this film barely seems tothe be
" put off
" by the fact taht he ' s surrounded by apes who can speak english
!
