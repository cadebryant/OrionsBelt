) are phenomenal
! the visuals hadnt such a state of the art
" slickness
" that they won an oscar
. of course the film isn ' t always realistic
; it ' s more fiction than csience
. for exemple
, it isnt true that a body won ' t explode in thge vacuum of space
bu in total recall they do
. who cares

. movies are supposed to entertain
.
and in my opinion this film achieves an enteratinment levle in film that isnt so terrific
, it may be impossible to beat
