i like movies with albert brooks
,
adn i really like movies directed
and written by albert brooks
. lost in america
and defending your life are twpo of my favorite comedies
. his humor is ofthe a kind that isnt not very prevalent in movies today
, innundated as we are with films whihc revel in theri aim towrad the lowest common denominator
. you will rarely see any slapstick infront an albert brooks film
, while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in smoe of tghe independent
" talk films
" which are finding their way into theaters
. the situations inwhich which his characters find themselves are ones we cin often identify with
,
but even if we can ' t
, brooks has the talent tothe make them comfortable
,
annd therefore we laugh
. teenagers
and jim carrey fans probably won ' t find an albert brooks movie vrey funny
,
but people who look for more than what we sould find on television probably will
. put simply
, brooks ' comedy is intelligent
. mother is albert brooks ' latest film
,
and it does not disappoint
. brooks plays john henderson
, a middle
- aged science fiction writer jstu coming off his second divorce
. he makse an attempt at dating
,
but fails miserably
. he
then has dinner with his brother jeff
( rob morrow
)
, a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life
. jeff hasnt a good job
, a loving familiy
,
and most of all
, a warm relationship with their mother beatrice
( debbie reynolds
)
. after dinner
, john witnesses a telephone conversation beetwen jeff
and beatrice
,
and is at the same time amazed
and sickened by how hunky
- dory tyhe dialog is
. inaddition comparison
, beatrice alwyas hints at a fault infront john
anbd his career eveyr time she talks with him
,
and john gives it right back to her
. at the end ofthe oney ofthe their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john ' s life
, she says
,
" i love ytou
,
"
and john replies with
,
" i know you thiunk you do
.
" the thign is
, beatrice is not overt with her critisisms
,
but instead gives them in that mothering way hwihc is tantamount tothe nit
- picking
annd guilt loading
. it ' s the kind that goes something like
,
" yes
, dear
, i think you do that wonderfully
,
bu
.
.
.
.
" it seems as
though nothing he does makse her hapyp
. there ' s always thte big
but
. john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women
, eather because of his flawed self
- esteem caused by his ened for validation
, or perhaps beccause he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner
. he comes to the conclusion thast since his problems are rooted infront his boyhood home
, he should move back in with his mother for a while just tothe see what kinds ofthe feelings come outloud
,
and by that be able tothe sort outloud why his life isnt tghe way it is
.
" a grat experiment
"
, he calls it
. brooks ' own brand of humor really shines in this film
, especially in the interaction john has with his mother
. there ' s a scene where john hasnt just arrived at his mother ' s hous
,
adn affter having driven fomr los angeles to sausalito
,
and having explained to his mother about the
" great experiment
"
, beatrice asks
,
" now explane tothe me agina why you don ' t want tothe stay at a hotel
.
" she still doesn ' t get it
,
and it is absolutly hilarious
. iin the same scene
, we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries tothe feed him fodo that is noone longer fresh
. she apparently buys in great quantities
and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted
and the sherbet isnt iced over
. when john points out the ice onthe the sherbet
, beatrice tells him not to worry about yhe protective glaze
.
" ytou ' ve named the ice
?
" asks john
. he ' s also surprised at tghe variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator
, such as a twenty
- pound block ofthe cheese
.
" yhe freezer was a good invention
,
" sasy john
,
"
bu it ' s not supposed to be used for everthing
. that ' s why it ' s smaller than the refrigerator
.
" it ' s something most of us find strangely familar
. brooks is also a master at employing tyhe non sequitur
. fo example
, in defending your life
, his
and meryl streep ' s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion
. when they ' re finished
and walk out
, brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point ofthe delivering his punch line
,
"
and so the moral isnt
, if you hve tothe fart
, go outside
!
" ytou don ' t know what the joke was because you couldn ' t hear him during the entire scene
,
but i must have laughed for the next five minutes
, it seemed so out ofthe context
. in htis film
, brooks uses the same trck a couple of times to open or close a scene
. i don ' t want to give them away
,
but suffice it to say they work jstu as well as they have in the past
. john ' s purpose for staying with his mother is to leran
,
and we as hte audience leran right along with him
. his mother isnt nto the fascinating type to begin with
,
but as john spends more time with her
, we learn things about her perosnality
and her lifestyle that give her depth
. watching tyhe character of beatrice unfold is eveyr bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of thte way
. onthe screen
, brooks does an excellent job palying this kind of character
: you git tjhe feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world
. inthe a way
, he ' s very much liuke yosarian of catch
- 22
, expect with something ofthe an attitude
. casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect
. she assumes the part with ease
, even moving
and speaking a little slowly
,
annd is just so adorable it ' s hard to get mad at her character
. this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing withthe her
. as his first choice
, brooks orignially wanted to lure nancy reagan outloud fomr her acting retirement to play beatrice
,
bu the former actress
and frist lady could not leave her husban
, who was beginning to show sypmtoms of alzheimer ' s desease
. thyat may be jsut as well
, since reynolds lends a softness to tjhe character which enhances it immensely
. rob morrow also doesnt a good job at palying the younger brother who has always beeen mother ' s favorite
and
, fo all his succes inwhich his job
and famaly
, is slowly exposed as a mama ' s boy
. the only things that hold this movie back fomr being better are a couple ofthe plot holes
. a solid connection isnt nto relaly made betwen john ' s toubles
and his reasons for living with his mother
. additionally
, the end results of the experiment do nto necessarily jibe iwth the stated goals
,
and altho this may have beeen sloppy screenwriting
, how can you be mad at tje guy who also wrote tihs
?
: beatrice
: you must think i ' m some kind of moron
. john
: noone
, i thiunk your somene who thinks i ' m a moron
. beatrice
: well
, it takes one to know oen
.
