you ' ve seen this moment before
, recently
: a particularly troubled charachter senses danger of yhe paranormal kind whn the room temperature inexplicably plummets tothe below freezing
. the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor ' s nell in thte haunting
, we don ' t care
. the hero ofthe teh sixth sense
, a young boy named cole
, is a rich creation
,
and we wish nothing more than forthe the ghosts who haunt him to tkae a hike
. the seasons have changed since an ex
- patient shot jaded child psychologist malcom crowe
( willis
) in the comfort of his own bedroom
. edsperate to git his career bakc on trackr
, even at the expense of his crumbling marriage
( to williams
, of rushmore
)
, malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. thte preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm ' s would
- be killer
: scars on his body
; antisocial behaviour
;
and the reluctance to reveal a big secret
. onyl after cole isnt locked inthe a closet by some bullies
(
and hospitalized as a result
) does he divulge to malcolm
, in a spine
- tingling scene
, that he sees dead people walking among us
, all the time
. malcolm assumes
,
and given his profession
, reasonably so
, that cole is schizophrenic
, not psychic
,
but the sincerity in cole ' s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures
. he will instade pursue the supernatural angle
, becoming a kind ofthe surrogate father to cole
( who lives with his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) in thge process
. the sixth sense hasnt more in common iwth ghost than poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan does
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib the self
- rearranging kitchen business from the latter
.
) it ' s far mroe heartwarming tahn frightening
,
and hte film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks
. cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown
,
but they ' re not out to harm him
, really
- they just whant to be heared
, even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler
. perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us
, at firt
, than they really are because we ' re looking at the situation thru tje eyes of an eight
- year
- old
. that ' s right
: willis
, for thge first time in years
, gives up the spotlight to his costar
. we appreciate malcom ' s domestic delimma
,
but we identify with cole
, recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or tje thnig under the bed
. both actors deliver immensely likable performances
,
and their dynamic is mainfest
. willis convinces us that he ' s a doctor
, something he was unable tothe do as a horndog shrink in hte overheated colour of night
. osment is phenominal
, a true professional who resists mugging for the camera liek some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do
. teh sixth sense
( atmospherically shot by the silence of tyhe lambs ' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) is actually a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campaign isnt misleading
. only baceause i was expecting something different doed i notice
- rather
, feel
- the movie ' s running time
, whlch is just shy of two hours
. the story unfurls slowy
but engrossingly
; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait
. i ' m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof
,
but i admired its audacity
.
