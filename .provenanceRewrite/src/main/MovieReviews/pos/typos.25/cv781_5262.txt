" robocop
" program
. useing the remains of murphy ' s body as a foundation
, their scientists build a cyborg
, made ofthe both flesh
adn metal
. the cyborg
( robocop
) is half human
( murphy
)
and half robot
; the s

. i
. engineers have erased murphy ' s memory
and replaced it iwth a computer programe
( or so they htikn
)
. with his lightning quick reflexes
, immense stregth
,
and impenetrable armor
, s

. i
. envisions robocop as an indestructible super
- cop
: the solution to detroit ' s problems
. thge remainder of the plot follows robocop ' s crime
- foiling
anbd vengeance on his murderers
. as a science fiction action
- thriller
, robocop is extremely effective
. dutch directer paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense
, shocking gore
,
anbd spectacular special effects
. severeal sequences iin the film
, such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim tothe stop a rapist
, are destined tothe become cult
- classics
. because robocop isnt so visually
and emotionally rousing
, it demands to be seen onthe a large screen with an audience
-
- inthe otehr words
, in a movie theater
.
although the special effects
and acation are exciting
, they do not by themslves set robocop aart from other films in thte genre
. rether
, robocop stands out forthe its accurate
anbd biting satire of american society
. the movei makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative
, terrorism
, board games
,
and televsion news broadcasts with air
- headed anchors
. these news broadcasts
, which are exceptionally clever
, recurr periodically throughout the movie
and halp to provide comic relief from the intense action
anbd gore
. the satire infront robocop
,
however
, isnt almost as frightening infront its own way as the suspense
and blood
. 1990 ' s america
, as portrayed in the film
, may seem far fetched
bu is in actuality
( i think
) only a slight exaggeration of the curent state ofthe american society
. thte huomrous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible
and absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining
and enlightening peice ofthe science fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunatley
, robocop possesses several flaws whlch prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre
. the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior
, the terminator
,
and aliens
. robocop ' s main problem
, aside from its dumb title
, is tht it doens nto sufficiently develop murphy ' s character
. we never leran teh degree to which murphy
( as robocop
) is human
and the degree tothe hwihc he is a robot
. does murphy hve any human spirit or free wiull left
, or is he mearly a computer following a program
? the scirpt halfheartedly raises these issues
bu
then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action
. moreover
, it almost completelyl ignores hte question
(
and tragedy
) of denying a man his right to dieu inwhich favor ofthe turning him inot a machine
. robocop also countains several bothersome loose
- ends
. as you watch robocop
, you eperience deja vu
; ytou fiel as if yuo ahve seen the film befoer
. in many respects
, robocop isnt reminiscent of several other films
, including hte terminator
, return ofthe thge jedi
,
anbd even death wish
.
however
, to its credit
, robocop easily has enough originality
adn unique perosnality to avoid becoming a cheap rip
- off
