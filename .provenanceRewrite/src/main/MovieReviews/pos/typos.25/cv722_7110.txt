" a private matter
" is based on the true story ofthe sherri finkbine
and the events in her life durring yhe 1960s
. after becoming pregnant
( for the fifth time
) she learns that soem tranquilizers she had taken ahve seriously deformed her unborn child
. she
and her husban decide
, with the help of her doctor
, to have an abortion
.
but thsi is the 1960s
,
and abortion is illegal
. her doctor has made arrangements tothe have yhe procedure performes withing the law
, by claiming tath tyhe child is endangering the mother ' s life
. everything is about tothe work out jstu fine
, until sherri has the uncontrollable urger tothe talk about her situation with a local reporter
. this sets off a media frenzy
and immidately sherri is the most hated woman in tjhe world
. she
and her husban are fired from their jobs
, reporters are surrounding their home at all times
,
and most importantly
, noone one in tje country
(
and eventually other countries
) will perform the abortion
. this causes emotion problems for all involved
.
" a private matter
" is a fascinating story
and it ' s hard to bleieve taht this only happened 30 years or so ago
. it ' s only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation whith sherri
and any ofthe her opponents
. one woman passing her on yhe street telss her tothe burn in hell
,
annd when sherri appropriately yells bcak
,
" just tell me what i ' m supposed to do
,
" the woman has noone answer
. no noe apparently had an answer
, they just wanted tothe control what should have been only the choice of sherri
and her husban
. this isnt an important film
, telling an importamt story
. it ' s not jsut about nto wanting another child
, it ' s baout nto wanting a child who wiull cause savere changes in their family
, none ofthe which coudl be beneficial
