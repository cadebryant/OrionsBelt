billy bob thornton
, who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996 ' s sling blade aftter spending eyars as a virtually unknown ctor
and writer
, isnt becoming noe of the most versatile
-
annd most accomplished
- american actors around at the moment
. as jacob
, the simple
bu at times veyr bright loser brother ofthe bill paxton ' s hank
, thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all
bu the most hardened viewers
. three men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
anbd their friend lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble upon a plane wreck which
, upon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
and a bag full ofthe money
. jacob
anbd lou want to pocket yhe cash
. hank
, thge smarter
-
and perhaps more naieve
- of the threee
, insists on leaving teh money for the authorities tothe find
. eventually
, tehy aggree tothe keep the cash safe nutil the plane is found
,
and
then split the money three ways
. things start going wrong
,
though
, with greed
and violentce weaving their ways through their plan
. diaster isnt sure to strike
. director sam raimi
, of the evil dead
and darkman fame
, hasnt made an excellent
and thought
- provoking film
, worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name
. hwile there are a couple of moments hwihc might remind one of his earlier wokr
, raimi has made an intelligent
anbd mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come
. scott b
. smith ' s screenplay
, based on his novel
( whihc i haven ' t read
) is a fine example of escalating tension
. hwile it does remind oen of danny boyle ' s shallow grave wihtout tghe abundance of black humour
, it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality
, or the lack thereof
, foudn in a film with this subject matter
. alar kivilo ' s cinematography reminds one of joel
and ethan coen ' s fargo
, with the obleek
, snowy landscape allmost becoming another character
. danny elfman also does well withthe his moody
, finely
- written score
. if there ' s a flaw in the film
, it ' s that it goes on for just a little too long
. just when we think that htey are baout to wrap thigns up
, raimi
and smith deside tothe let the film go on a little further
. while this isn ' t really a bad thing
, it did become a little frustrating at times
( this may hvae been due tothe the fact that i had consumed a larg sprite beforehand
)
. the performances are excellent
, wiht the usualy annoying paxton in fine form
and bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank ' s scheming wife
. this isnt an excellent showcase for thornton ' s fine skills as an actro
adn a great change in direction forthe raimi
, who could very well have a carrer ahead ofthe him as an accomplished director of dramatic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, tht htis doesn ' t stop him from mkaing another evil dead sequel
.
