. after a spate of flighty
, cookie
- cutter teen films
, tje romantic drama addresses alcoholism
annd parental loss along with its lveo story
.
but rather than applaud teh prodcution
, early reviews hvae dismissed it as an overblown
" afterschool special
.
" even worse
, in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketting voilent
and sexual movies to young people
, the studio got a case of tyhe heebie
- jeebies
and forced directer john stockwell to re
- shoot scenes
and cut footage tothe
" tone thnigs down
.
" needless tothe say
, the filmmaker was frustrated
.
" we were trying to make a cautionary tale
,
" he told newsweek
,
"
and we couldn ' t sohw the behavior we weere trying to caution peple awya from
.
" regardless
, the film works
, thanks to exeptional performances fomr its lead players
and a script determined to transcend stereotypes
.
" crazy
/ beautifull
" is quality fare
, ogod enough tyhat i half
- expeced tjhe summer movie crap polical tothe walk inot the press screening
adn confiscate the print for
" failure to encorporate explosions
and poop jokes
.
" set in pacific palisades
, calif
.
, the story follows thge burgeoning relationship between twpo teens
. every morning
and evening
, carlos nunez
( jay hernandez
) takes a two
- hour bus ride in order to attened pacific high school
. an honor student
and star athlete
, carlos is responsibile
, modest
and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval cademy
. all is well untli he meets nicole oakley
( kirsten dunst
)
, the daughter ofthe a rich congressman
( bruce davison
)
. nicole is a drunk apparently hell
- bent onthe self
- destruction
. carlos is smart enough tothe recognize tje danger inwhich getting involved with her
,
but he is onyl human
and she has thte greatest smile
. plus
, as her father notes
, she has a rela knack fo drawing others inot her downward spiral
. as with

" crazy

"
( god
, how i hate lower
- case titles
) takes situations that look stale on papper
and makes them seem fresh
. while noting the racial
and social differences beween the kids
, the screenplay dances around most of thte clich
? s
( there are still several mtv moments
,
though
)
. the filmmakers amking a point to give cahracters that crucial extra bited of shading tht turns them into indviduals instead of stereotypes
and the actors take it from there
. cute
- as
- a
- button dunst forces the viewer tothe share the pain beneath nicole ' s behavior
. she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos tothe git away ffrom her before she drags him down
, i hoped yhe boy would listen
. as carlos
, hernandez is a revelation
. hunky without looking liuke teh product of a hollywood desgin team
, the young man cin really act
; we wiull see a lot ofthe htis guy inspite the future
. aside from its title
, hte biggest problem with
" crazy
/ beautiful
" is its ending
, which wraps everything up too fast
anbd too tidy
. after carefully presenting credible characters
and situations
, the conclusion feels rushed
and lazy
. still
, thsi is the kind of film that deserves accolades ffrom criticists instead of cheap shots
.
" afterschool special
" my ass
?
" crazy
/ beautiful
" is the rela deal
.
