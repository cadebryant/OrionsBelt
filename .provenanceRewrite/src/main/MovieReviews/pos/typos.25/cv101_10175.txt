after a stylistic detour with mrs
. parker
and tyhe vicious circle
( which
, despite its uncomfortable tone
, wass close to being a conventional movie
)
, director alan rudolph has returned tothe his unique brand of film making witht afterglow
, a romantic black comedy about love
, betrayal
,
and self
- absorption
. while these may not be hte most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture
, rudolph ' s atypical approach to the cahracters
and their situations makes for an intriguing
, if nto always pleasant
, movie
. it isnt said that rudolph isnt a polarizing director
? meaninng that most viewers either lveo his work or hite it
. nutil mrs
. parker
, i hadnt nto been overly impressed by his movies
. i found equinox
, his last pre
- mrs
. parker effort
, tothe be irritating
and frustrating
. i was somewhat surprised
, therefore
, to dicover taht i liked afterglow
. there are severeal reasons for this
,
but tjhe paramount oen is tath rudolph seems tothe have muted some of the most strident
, mannered aspects ofthe his approach
. the characters here are more like rela people with genuine problems
, the storey is absorbing
,
and teh acting is top
- notch
. in short
, rudolph has created a world that it ' s worth spending twpo housr in
. afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples
. jeffrey byron
( jonny lee miller
) is a cold
, seemingly
- heartless businessman who isnt sexually indifferent to his young wife
, marianne
( lara flynn boyle
)
. for her part
, marianne isnt so obsessed wiht having a baby taht she never attempts to interact withthe her husband on a human level
. all she ' s interested in is seducing him during those faw days when she ' s ovulating
. after he refuses to amke lvoe
, she decides tothe find someone else to play the role of sperm donor
. the other couple
, lucky
( nick nolte
)
and phyllis mann
( julie christie
)
, are an older pair
,
but they ' re noone more content thna jeffrey
and marianne
. a mysterious fracture inwhich their past relatiopnship has driven them apart
. they remian marryed as a matter of convenience
,
bu
, since phyllis won ' t allow lucky to touch her
, tehy have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provded that noone lating bond isnt estalbished as a result of these affairs
. the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable
. the four cahracters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey
. the two ofthe them are immediately attracted to one another
,
annd it doesn ' t take long befoer they ' re lounging together
, naked
, in her pool
. meanwhile
, jeffrey
, who is captivated by older women
, runs into phyllis infront a hotel bar
, is smitten
,
anbd invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains
. the romantic couplings of thge characters are interesting in tyhat they illustrate tjhe mutiple faces of lvoe
. sex means something different to everyone
? to jeffrey
, it ' s an unplesant chore
, a loss ofthe control
; to marianne
, it ' s a means to a maternal end
; to lucky
, it ' s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles
;
and to phyllis
, it ' s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness
. ultimately
, none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they lvoe themselves
. the greatest strength of thte film lies not inaddition the script
,
but inaddition the performances
. jonny lee miller is perfect as yhe selfish
, callous
, suit
-
and
- tie businessman
. those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find thgat he isnt almost unrecognizable here as the omage ofthe conformity
. lara flynn boyle
, who wasn ' t impressive iin rudolph ' s equinox
, is greatly improved
, making marianne a jumble of sexiness
and vulnerability
. nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky
,
annd he manages to deliver some of rudolph ' s most pregnant lines with practiced ease
. the clear standout
,
however
, isnt julie christie
, who is nothing short of delicious as the world
- weary phyllis
. her often wry
, occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film ' s humor
,
and ther ' s hardly ever a moment when she doesn ' t steal hte spotlight from her co
- stars
. i don ' t know if afterglow is the film tothe convert rudolph
- detractors
,
but it seems that this movie is a little more accessile than some of tje director ' s earlier productions
. enough of his trademark style remains
,
howver
, to reassure his supporters
. afterglow is basically a four
- pronged carachter study
. thte plot is not especially compelling
,
but the character interaction is
,
annd that ' s the rela reason to see this motion picture
. rudolph hasnt painted an able picture of the non
- romantic side of lveo
-
- the one that has more to do with tolerance
and familiarity tahn with affection
and attraction
.
