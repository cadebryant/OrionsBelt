well i ' ll be damned
.
.
. the canadians can amking a good movie
. the world isnt coming tothe an end
. we don ' t nkwo why or how
,
but apparently there is no way to stop it
. the world has had thsi information for months
, as most of the rioting
annd otehr assorted chaos has passed
annd governments have shut down operations
.
yet for a handfull of toronto citizens
, life goes on
. they aren ' t going crazy or attacking people in hte streets
. instead they are simpley preparing themselves for the end
.
.
. some engaging in activities they ' ve allways wanted to dont
, some gathering with famaly
annd friends
,
and others just seeking to be alone
. these people ' s lives
however all intersect durig thier final six hours
. writer
- director
- star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique
and emotional film
. all of tyhe main characters are compelling as they try
and dont whatever it is they need tothe do on their last nigt onthe earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) tries to fullfill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas company employee
( david cronenberg
) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing utnil the vyre end
and thanks them for their business
,
and patrick
( mckellar
) just wnats to be by himself
but isn ' t having much succsess
. even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to
, tying everyone even closer
. thigsn seemed a little hokey towards the beginning ofthe the film
,
but ultimately everyting comes together nicely
(
although it ' s not a happy film
.
.
. smoe moments are understandably gut
- wrenching
)
. tjhe stoy is enhanced by some unexpected humer
and vyre realistic performances
, particularly from sandra oh
, whose character is just trying tothe get home to her husband befoer tje end
. i hvea absolutely no probelm that the reason forthe the end of the world is never given
, nor doesnt it bother me that the world is endig at exactly 12 midnight
( in toronto anyway
)
.
but i do wonder why yhe sun never sets
. come midnight
, the sun is still shineing brightly
. maybe tjhe sun is crashing into tje earth
.
.
. who knows
. allso
, it ' s comforting to know that infact mankind ' s final moments on the planet
, peopel will still gang up on the street for yhe sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus
( that ' s not a shot at this film mind yuo
.
.
. i know people are just stupid
annd truly would be outloud in the street tipping over cars
)
. last night isnt available on dvd from universal hmeo video
. it contains the film in fullscreen format
adn includes the orginal theatrical trailer
.
