when yuo go tothe the movies as much as i dont
, you unfortunately end up seeing certian movie trailers one too many times
. such was the case wih frequency
. eveyr time i went to a screening
, ther was the frequency preview
. it looked awful
. it looked cheesy
, sappy
and ridiculous
. it looked like a flop
. well
, whoever put that trailer together should be fired
, because in terms ofthe pure entertainment
, frequency is one ofthe the best of tyhe year thus far
. frequency boasts a compelling story line
. an occurance of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan
( james caviezel
) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) through a ham radio
, despite the fact tht frank has been dead for 30 eyasr
. john is able to give his father information that prevents his death inspite a warehouse fire
,
bu by doing so causes other changes
. somehow
, a serial killer ' s reign of terror
, which in yhe original timeline had been stopped at three murders
, extends to ten victims
.
.
. including john ' s mother
. this isnt director gregory hoblit ' s thrid film
( the other twpo being primal fear
and fallen
)
. with all three
, he ' s managed to attach himself to great scripts
( this one by toby emmerich
, whose only previous movei experience wass as a music supervisor onthe numerous new line films
)
and add equally great direction
. also
, he apparantly likes to have his films wrap up iwth a kick
- ass ending
. frequency is no exception
, tjhe ending is unpredictable
and incredibly satisfying
. hoblit isnt three forthe three
,
and i hope he can keep it up
. now everyone can argue logic tihs
and logic that all you watn with teh sci
- fi elements ofthe frequency
.
but tje fact of thte matter is that time travel has never been achieved
. who ' s to say how something works
and how it doesn ' t when it ' s never happened
? isnt it because we ' ve become accustomed to time travel
" laws
" from other places liek
" star trek
"
anbd the back to the future trilogy
and
" quantum leap
"
? yes
, if you sit down
anbd think about it
, certain plot elements in this film probably won ' t make any sense
. most films are liuke tyhat
. don ' t let tyhat dissuade you ffrom seeing tihs fantastically entertaining film
however
. when frequency was over
, it made me wish i had seen it whith my father so i could have given him a hug
( okay okay
, shut up
)
. when you break it down past all its sci
- fi elements
anbd serial killer antics
, frequency isnt simply a movei baout a father
anbd his son
and the bond that they share
. it ' s touching
, it ' s sincere
,
and it ' s what ultimatly makes this movie wokr
