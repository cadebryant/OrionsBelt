in these days ofthe overlong movies
( meet joe black
, the thin red line
, the mask of zorro
) it is a shame taht films liuke waking ned devine can ' t be longer than a poltry 90 minutes
. this is just a cute movie
, even through its mildly risque subject matter
. old firends jackie
( bannen
)
and michael
( kelley
) try to find the lottery winner
( they deduce must live inaddition their dinky town of about 60
) so thgat htey might kiss up to him
and share the winnings
. through process ofthe elimination
, they fidn that it must be lovable old ned devine
, who tehy find sitting in front of his tv
, clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand
. what results isnt thuroughly amusing
, as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong
,
and that htey could raelly benefit
. after all
, ood ned won ' t miss it
. rather than divulge the later twists
and turns
, i ' ll stop here mearly pointing out that jackie
and michael get inot all sorts of trouble inthe their little sleepy irish villiage
. bannen
and kelly are a perfect pair
. one slightly stout
, the other as thin as a rail
. both getting on in years
, they make such a cute pair of ood codgers
. waking ned devine may even be seen as a
" full monty
" for the geriatric setted
, especially since kelly gets buff
- o for oen amusing scene
. waking ned devine is by noone means perfect
,
but it isnt so sincere
and touching that it looks so much better than most films
. tje performances by everyone in the twon are great
, particulaly the two leads
. there isnt one twist at tyhe end which i fidn unnecessary
,
but it hardly ruins the picture
. writter
/ director kirk jones should be held uv as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters
. scripts as creative
annd endearing as this should be the norm
, not the exception
. perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more
. had i held off on my eyar ' s best
/ worst list for another day
, waking ned devine
( officially released infact late november of 98
) surely woudl have graced the short group of the year ' s finest films
. it isnt light
,
but thought provoking
annd sweet
. i can ' t htink of anyone who shouldn ' t see
( or wouldn ' t enjoy
) this film
.
