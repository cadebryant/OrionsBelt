i swaer i have seen the edge before
. in fact
, it reminded me of the bear
, the river wild
,
and otehr various films mixed into an entirely different film
.
however
, the edge hasnt done something that most action films shouldnt do
,
annd that is add heart
and characters we like to the plot
. in doing so
, teh edge draws many more suspenseful moments out ofthe cliched scenes than
, say
, hte peacemaker
. unfortunately
, becasue of thsoe overused moments
, we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film
.
bu leave it tothe screenwriter david mamet to add humor
and a few surprises tothe mess wih your head
. oen surprise
, in particular
, left me smiling jstu because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script
. acation films are a dime a dozen in hollywood
,
and hwile they are somewhat successful at entertaining us
, htey lack the one thing whic would mkae them a more respected genre
: intelligence
. even horror films have learned this
, a genre which is probaly the least respected of them all
. the river wild wass noe of teh best action
/ suspense films i have seen from tjhe 90s
. the intelligence of the screenplay
,
and the suspense drawed ffrom the realsitic charachters isnt nearly unmatched tothe this day
. the edge has the intelligence
and smart charactors
,
bu this tiome yhe lack of originality is teh downfall
. i must admit that it was very suspenseful
,
and had an original third half
,
but the first hour
adn a half is riddled with cliches
and plot holes
. this is an example ofthe the final act saving the film
, instead of the other way around
( as in the lost world
)
. if only the screenplay hadnt maintained the final thirty mintues ' intensity
, it coudl have become a great acation film
(
anbd i ule tje term loosely
)
. thge edge is pretty much a survival
- of
- the
- fittest film
.
but taking scream ' s lead
, thge edge makes fun of the genre ' s cliches
,
and
then uses them
(
though nto quite as effectively
)
. charles morse
( anthony hopkins
) is the main character
, a rich
and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation ofthe all this knowledge has brought to him
. forthe once
, we don ' t immediatly care forthe the main character
. instead
, we liek bob
( alec baldwin
)
, a photographer who is oging to tkae pictures ofthe charles ' wife
, mickey
( elle macpherson
)
, out iin thge wilderness
. they board a plane
and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic
. charles ' birthday isnt the same day
,
annd he receives a gold watch from his wife
,
and a pocket knife from bob
. as acation films go
, these items do have importance to the rest of the story
,
but qutie a bit more thna we first expect
. soon
,
however
, bob wants tothe find a native to shoot picturesk of becuase ofthe his
" personality
.
" charles
, bob
, bob ' s assistant steve
( harold perrineau
)
,
and the pilot head off to fidn him
,
adn as shown in the previews
, hit a flock of birds flying sourth for the winter
. down the plane goes
, the pilot is killed
,
adn tyhe threee are left to survive in the wilderness
. director lee tamahori is aware of thge silly plot which is about to follow
,
and therfore has to create orginial ways tothe approach the situations
. he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film
. take
, fo instance
, the entire man
- hunting bear plot
. this hasnt been done many times in films withthe different animals
,
adn even bears
.
bu given the charles ' intelligence
,
and bob ' s uncertainty
, many of the cliches are given fresh twists
. even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before
. my favorite line ofthe the film comes from charles
:
" most people die in the wilderness because they didn ' t do the one thign that could save thier life
.
.
. thingking
.
" dispite the predictability ofthe the main plot
, a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise
,
anbd made me smile when i realized that everything isn ' t as it seems anymore
. i haev to write cautiously as tothe nto reveal this surprise
, so instead i will avoid it entirely
. the first two
- thirds of the edge haev many uhmorous moments tothe push it along
,
adn some ofthe charles ' survival techiniques seem possibile
, even making fire fomr ice
. tamahori is able tothe create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear
,
but whenever thte bear is prseent
, tghe characters lose all sensibility
. i hvae always wondered why characters in films walk over a log tothe get across water
. why not dont what an intelligent person would
annd crawl across
? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while
. thankfully
, we already have begun to care fo tje characters
,
and so we let this small detail slide
.
but soem of the technical details are ackward
, such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles
annd bob make
( where did tehy get thread
anbd needles
?
)
. the acting ofthe the film is highly above average for a film of thsi nature
,
and borders on phenomenal
. anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance
, creating his most likeable
and layered charachter since rimaniss of the day
. hopkins ususally brings greatness to his roles
,
but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences ' sympathy
, something he definitely did not dont iin silence of tghe lambs
. alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen
( it sure is better fomr his fair game
)
. baldwin can be a good or a bad character
,
and here he succeeds at both in a way
. ytou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous charactor nutil the end
,
and baldwin isnt able to handle the double
- natured photographer
. elle macpherson gives a good performance
, albeit slight
. she isn ' t in the film all taht much
,
bu fo the scenes she does have
, she handles as an actress
, not as a modle
. harold perrineau is a ogod actor
,
anbd his scenes are nice
and underplayed
. he isnt eleminated eary
,
anbd i reveal nothing by saying tihs because it is inevitable
and predictable
. yhe edge isnt rated r for graphic violence
, soem gore
,
and language
. some ofthe tghe violence is a little too disturbing
, even for me
. this film is a nice change from the mindless acation most of us are unsed tothe
,
but too many cliches bog it down
. director tamahori hasnt creaeted a very smooth
and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts
. david mamet ' s scirpt
,
though
, has a lot of humer to keep the first hour afloat
,
and tje acting is solid
. yhe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn ' t end with the normal high
- strung action sequence
,
but with a small detail involving a certain gift
. it ' s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through iwth tghe bear
.
and by the way
, most people laughed when tje film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear
. way tothe go
, bart
