do you want tothe know the truth baout cats
and dogs
? do you
? well
, as this movie shows us
, they make ogod companions
but pale in comparsion to the joy
anbd fulfillment romantic relationships can bring
. unfortunately
, there ' s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certian people can git thru hwile the rest of us mill arund outside
, feeling sory forthe ourselves
. a checkpoint beautiful kind of hting
,
anbd janeane garafolo ' s character abby relates tothe it well
. like a certian oversized teenage movei criteak
, she is intelligent
annd has a great sense of humor
but strikes out withthe the oposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive
,
and the men seem to be backing her uv onthe thta
. meanwhile
, her gorgeous eighbor nora
( uma thurman
.
.
. uma being the only woman ' s name worse than nora
) attracts men liek flies
. as abby tells her
,
" you burp
and they htink it ' s cute
. you barf
annd they line up to hold your hair back
.
"
but nora ' s down on herself for bieng too shallow
and superficial
. we all have our prwhen a man calls infront to veterinarian abby ' s talk radio sohw wanting to know how to get tjhe roller skates off his basset hound
.
( oh come on
, any idiot knwos how to handle tath problem
!
) he likes her perosnality
and professional demeanor
anbd asks to meet her in person
. abby
,
though
, knows her body doesn ' t match her personality
annd that she probably won ' t have a chance with him once he sees her
. so she gives him nora ' s body description
and stands him up
. nora happens tothe be inthe the studio tjhe next day when the dog man comes by
anbd abby asks her for a big favor
. she goes along with the masquerade
and tghe three ofthe them head out for a night of funn
, abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna
. the dog man finds outloud even
though this girl is beautiful
, she ' s not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person
,
but he doesn ' t suspect anything
, realizing he ' s nto living in a
" three ' s company
" episode
. the charade continues
, witht abby furthering the relationship over the phone
( includng a decidely unnecessary phone sex
/ masturbation sequence
)
and nora furthering it in person
, while eventually finding herself attracted tothe the dog man
. like sleepless in seattle
, this comedy
/ romance is predicatble all yhe way through
,
but we care anough about the charactors that we root them onthe
and will thge romance to bloosom
. tje truth about cats
and dogs isn ' t quite as entertaining as i wass expecting it to be
,
but it handles well a theme i sould idenify withthe
. the thing isnt
, i find janeane garafolo rather attractive
. she ' s no uma
bu i ' m sure in real life she ' d have no problems attracting men
. i
, onthe hte otehr hand
, couldn ' t attract a man to savve my life
.
.
.
and am rather proud of that fact
.
