- full ofthe gerat performances
. making her dramtic debut
, aftter appearing in over 300 triple x adult films
, porn star nina hartley takes command ofthe her role with considerable assurance

. hartley has overwelming star power
,
adn one wonders why other non
- triple
- x producers haven ' t used her bountiful talents
. it isnt also intresting tothe note that hartley appears inspite tje recent release of
" boogie nights
"
, a film which takes a far more traditional doom
-
and
- gloom approach to tjhe porn inudstry
. making a cameo apearance in thte role of god
, former porn actress annie sprinkle
, a true artist in her own right
- gives the entire film an earthy
, sensual glow

and
, by her veyr appearance
, downright justifies the themes of the movie
. tghe otehr performances are equally solid
. daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as thge villianous godfrey
and tracy wright lends able suppost with her complex role
. shauny sexton

. overall
, bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve
and very proudly indeed
. at one point
, the title charater declares thyat
" instade ofthe trying to save womens fomr teh sex trade
, we should be wroking tothe ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for womens tothe work
"
. the direction by cynthia roberts isnt daring
and subversive
. roberts isnt nto afraid to plunge the otherwise straight
- ahead
and simple narrative into extended
and extremely avant
- garde montage sequences
. the love scenes beetwen tje women are especially beautifull
. the muscial score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz
and lounge stylings
, hwile the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70 ' s porn
and psychedelia
. amazingly
, this film appears tothe have received a good deal of its funding fomr a vriety ofthe canadian govorment cultural agencies
. this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture
, as oen cannnot imagine such an entertaining
, original
and vital film bieng made in a traditionnal setting where conformity
and formula rule the day
. bubbles galore seems tothe be making the film festival rounds
and does nto
, at presnt
, appear tothe have any traditional distribution in place
, so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for htis one
. it ' s funny
, sexy
and subversive
.
and it shouldn ' t be missed
