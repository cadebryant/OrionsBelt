in 1998
, directer brett ratner
and his stars
, jackie chan
and chris tucker
, breathed new life into the buddy
- action film genre with the cross
- cultural
" rush hour
"
- to hte tune of about
$ 250 million
. you don ' t mess wih success
, so thte team isnt back agina
,
and better
, in
" rush hour 2
.
" the combo of the terific physical talents of chan
and thge non
- stop motor mouth ofthe tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in
" rush hour
" that played well tothe audiences around the world
. the formula worked so well
, in fact
, thta the sequel ws inevitable
. i ' m never thrilled with the idea of a follow
- up to a successful orignal since htey rarely meet tghe previously setted expectations
. surprisingly
,
" rush hour 2
" wastes no time getting down to buisness
and turns outloud tothe be better than the flick taht spawned it
. thge script
, by jeff nathanson
( utilizing the charachters developed by ross lamanna in the first film
)
, wastes no timne getting to the point right ffrom tje start
. terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong
, killing two american translators
,
adn chief inspector lee
( jackie chan
) is handed teh job of solving the crime
. concurrently
, his friend james carter
( chris tucker
) arrives on the island for smoe much needed r
& r
and expects his friend tothe spend some time
and show him hte sights
. instead
, lee drags carter into the case
and tyhe duo get involved in stoping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds ofthe million ofthe us dollars
. the makers of
" rush hour 2
" are wroking at a distinct advantage over hte originnal
. we
, the viewer
, are familiar with the two lead cahracters
adn the laready
- existing chemistry that chan
and tucker developed so well the first time around
. thyat chemestry was a high point
(
adn probably the saveing point
) before
annd
, nowe
, the pair wears their friendship like a confortable suit
. little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on thsoe things we liked best infront
" rush hour
.
" first
and foremost to me
, in
" rh2
,
" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan ' s artistry in fight choreography
. the 47
- eyar old martial arts master hasnt a renowned reputation forthe doing all of his pwn stunt work
adn
, here
, he doens not disapait
. chan ' s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand
, such as a trash bucket
. his moves look eveyr bit as good as tehy ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding
, on the tail end of a yacht
, infront a hong kong massage parlor
annd
, for the finale
, in a las vegas casino
. like harold lloyd or buster keaton
, chan takes pride in putting his fysical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry
adn isnt a joy to watch
. chris tucker reprises his role as thte motor mouthed la cop
, carter
, who teams
, again
, with lee tothe put down the bad guys
. when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleage
and friend with the big case
, he still looks to have some fun
. when lee goes into a karaoke bar
, the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan
( john lone
)
and his hoods
, carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff
. the comedian made the move from tje improv stage to tjhe big screen
anbd
, with jackie chan
, has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay teh bills
. the combo ofthe chan ' s flying feets
and fists with tucker ' s fast mouth amking a duet more endearing than riggs
and murtaugh iin the
" leathal weapon
" films
. the supporting cast is here tothe move thigns allong efficiently
. john lone
, as ricky tan
, is a suave villain who isnt the real power behind hte throne of american bigwig steven reign
( alan king in a walk thru performance
)
. lone doesn ' t chew scenery or make pronouncements tothe
" git lee
and carter
,
"
bu gives the chief bad guy elegance
. zhang zi
- yi
(
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky ' s taciturn henchlady
, hu li
, who carries on an ongoing battle with carter
.
( carter has a problem
, thru most of the film
, with hitting a woman
,
but thsi falls aside with thier eventual oney
- on
- oen melee at the conclusion
.
) roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous
(
and resembles sandra bullock
) as undercover agent isabella molina
- she doesn ' t add much to the equation
but is terific tothe watch
. directer ratner
and the original
" rush hour
" prodcution team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen tothe work behind the camera
. cinematographer matthew f
. leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks
annd gives
" rh2
" yhe fluid camera movement the genre film needs
. production desgin by terrence marsh spans continents
annd gives tjhe right look
, whther it is inspite a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino
. the rest ofthe the techs are ofthe the smae high qualiyt
. i ' m surprised tothe even say that
" rush hour 2
" is teh most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies
. it tkaes the best ofthe the first film
annd kicks jurassic dino butt inaddition its fun
, frolic
and fast pace
adn isnt the best mainstream thing out
, so far
, this summer
