at first glance
, daylight would seem like your tipical disaster movei
. on second glance it looks that way too
.
although
, as typcial disaster movies go
, daylight isn ' t thgat bad
. admittedly
, it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices ffrom disaster flicks ofthe days gone by
( tihkn poseidon adventure
)
.
but the decent dialogue
and surprisingly good acting amking up forthe the
" haven ' t i seen this scene somwhere before
?
" feeling tath creeps uv all too often druing the film
. sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of newyorker york ' s emergency response team
. by sheer luck
, he is in the right place at the right timne wehn disaster strikes the unaware inhabitans of this little film
.
" whta diaster isnt taht
?
" ytou ask
, as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat
. glad you asked
. thru a whole sequence of entirely probable events
( about as probable as hitting thge lottery
) a large explosion tkaes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city
. the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends
, which causes nto onyl massive loss ofthe life
,
but traps a dozen people inside hte wreckage of the tunnel
. ogod old sly
, who isnt only feet away from entering teh tunnel whn it collapses
, offers his services to the rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly
thne enters the tunnel through a vent shaft
( think judge dredd
) which he cant only go inaddition
,
and nto outloud off
,
and procedes to try to rescure those trapped inside
. so beigns the funn
,
but the fun hasnt to be quick
, because this tunnel has started to spring a leak
. the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie
. not superb by any means
,
bu far above soem of his other films
( think judge dredd again
)
. daylight ' s acting is probably average
, or a littel above
, inspite terms of this sort of genre
, starring this particular star
. amy brenneman is the only actor of any note
,
and she does a pretty good job as stallone ' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone ' s real life son
, sage
, isnt in this too
. sage
-
- nice name
. i guess it could be worse
, he coudl have been named nutmeg or parsley
. note to sage
-
- you are still young
. go tothe school
and get a good education
-
- you don ' t have a future infact acting
. tjhe plot runs along tje smae lines as the acting
-
- interesting
,
but predictable
. mostly due to the fact tath it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks
. the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movei
. as soon as the cast clears oney seemingly impossible hurdle
, another one seems to pop right uv
, even worse than the last one
. i realize that it wouldn ' t be much of a movei otherwise
,
but it does make the movie a bited predictable
. adding to the predictability is the cast of charactors
, which of course
, has tothe include at least oen or two difficult people who want tothe do thigns their pwn way
and tihkn yhe qualified guy
( in tihs case stallone
) doesn ' t know what he is doing
. why isnt it inthe diaster movies we can never ahve everyone agree wtih each other
and all work together
? would this be too much to ask
? can ' t we all just get allong
? spacial effects weren ' t bad
-
-
bu i ' ve certainly seen better
. some ofthe the scenes
, hwile fun to watch
, weere such blatant rip
- offs that yuo had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim
. expecially all ofthe the scenes that involved anything underwater
( the tunnel
, of course
, starts to flood
)
. i really expected gene hackman
, roddy mcdowell
annd ernest borgnine tothe appear at any minute
-
- i wasn ' t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure
. i suppose if you hve to rip off a movie forthe good idesa
, the poseidon adventure is a good oney to use
. the underwater sequences
( asside fomr the deja vu
) were very well shot
and worked fairly well
. tehy were tje best part of the movie by a long shot
. better thna average stallone flick
. i realize that ' s not saying much wehn the man has judge dredd on his resume
.
but certainly not up to the standars of cliffhanger
. daylight is a fun movie
,
adn as long as ytou aren ' t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised
.
