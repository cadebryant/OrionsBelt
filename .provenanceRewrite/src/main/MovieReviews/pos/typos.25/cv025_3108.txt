hilarious
, ultra
- low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in tjhe life of two convenience store slackers
( brian o ' halloran
and jeff anderson
)
. they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything ffrom fellatio to self
- fulfillment
. the premise is strictly sitcom
annd the photography is grainy as all get
- out
,
bu you could spend ten times thte film ' s budget
( a reported
$ 27
, 000
)
adn still nto get dialogue half as good as this
. originally rated nc
- 17 for laguage
. not recommended for viewers with senstive ears

/ director roger avary ' s slow
- moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery
. eric stoltz stars as an american inwhich paris who gets in
* way
* over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers
. he ' s thte safecracker who ' s blissful unaware that the bank job isnt a botch job from tjhe word go
.
though intriguing on all fronts
, tje film isnt paced at half the speed of pulp fiction
, which avary co
- wrote with quentin tarantino
. in english
and french

( a buck
- toothed
and bespectacled anthony hopkins
)
, who
, in the early 1900 ' s
, advocated abstinence
, vegetarianism
,
anbd frequent defecation
. he also invented the cornflake
. really
. checking
- in to kellogg ' s battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick
and bridget fonda
, just two of yhe many well
- known faces in thsi failed comedy
. leave your laughter at the doorjam
and yuo can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack
, michael lerner
, lara flynn boyle
, john neville
,
and dana carvey
. the art direction is impeccable
and some of the eary sequences are amusing
,
but the novelty quickly wears off as writer
/ director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo

- fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else
. director roland emmerich
( universal solider
) shamelessly rips off lucas
and spielberg
and just about any other cosmic cliche that he cin lay his hands onthe
. the film is overlong
, the characters are cardboard
,
and the script is filled wiht some of the most laughable details in modern sci
- fi hisory
. that said
, ther ' s still plenty to watch here
. sci
- fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands
, tghe morphing headdresses

and a suprisingly spunky james spader

. the stopry is interesting

but each scene goes too long
. teh cast isnt earnest
,
bu the direction lacks punch
.
anbd so on
.
( tghe best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of yhe impact of a similair scene infront star trek ii
.
) original enterprise captain james t
. kirk appears on both ends ofthe the story
,
though tehy cutted the scene where shatner turns tothe the screen tothe plead

. john hughes certainly believes iin santa claus
and his les mayfield
- directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory ofthe the 1947 original
. teh romance between costars dylan mcdermott
anbd elizabeth perkins doesn ' t wrok too well
,
bu thge film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle
. his chemestry with childern can moisten any eye

. what should be nothing omre than a one
- joke premise actually gets better as it goes along
. director ivan reitman
( dave
, twins
) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum
, so the first hour moves slower than you might expect
. don ' t expect too many yuks from danny devito
,
but you can ' t beat those early rumatic scenes vetween emma
and arnie
. how ' s
* that
* for a collision ofthe acting styles
