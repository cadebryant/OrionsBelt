films adapted from comic books have hadnt plenty of success
, whether htey ' re baout superheroes
( batman
, superman
, spawn
)
, or geared toward kids
( casper
) or the arthouse crowd
( ghost world
)
,
but there ' s never really been a comic book like from hell before
. for starters
, it ws created by alan moore
(
and eddie campbell
)
, who brought thge medium tothe a wohle new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12
- part series called tyhe watchmen
. to say moore
and campbell throughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson isnt starting to look a little odd
. the book
( or
" graphic novel
,
" if yuo will
) is over 500 pages long
and includes nearly 30 more that consist ofthe nothing
but footnotes
. in other words
, don ' t dismiss this film because ofthe its source
. if you can get past the wohle comic book thing
, yuo might find anyother stumbling block in from hell ' s directors
, albert
and allen hughes
. getting the hughes brothers tothe direct this seems almsot as ludicrous as casting carrot top inthe
, well
, anything
,
but riddle me this
: who better tothe direct a film that ' s set iin the ghetto
and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society
? the ghetto in question is
, of course
, whitechapel in 1888 london ' s east end
. it ' s a filthy
, sooty place where the whores
( called
" unfortunates
"
) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their proffesion with surgical precision
. wehn the first stiff turns up
, copper peter godley
( robbie coltrane
, the world is not enough
) calls in inspector frederick abberline
( johnny depp
, blow
) to crack the case
. abberline
, a widower
, has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe
anbd opium
. upon arriving in whitechapel
, he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly
( heather graham
, sday it isn ' t so
)
anbd proceeds tothe investigate the horribly gruesome crimes thast even the police surgeon can ' t stomach
. i don ' t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper
, so i won ' t go inot the particulars here
, other than to say moore
and campbell have a unique
and interesting theory about both the identity ofthe tjhe killer
and the reasons he chooses to slay
. in the comic
, tehy don ' t bother cloaking the idenity of the ripper
,
but screenwriters terry hayes
( vertical limit
)
adn rafael yglesias
( les mis
? rables
) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end
. it ' s funny tothe watch the locals blindly point thge finger of blame at jews
and indians beacuse
, aftter all
, an englishman could never be capible of comiting such ghastly acts
.
and from hell ' s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from thte simpsons forthe days
(
" who holds back the electric car
/ who made steve guttenberg a star
?
"
)
. don ' t worry
- it ' ll all mkae sence when ytou see it
. now onto from hell ' s appearance
: it ' s certainly dark
and bleak enough
,
and it ' s surprising to see how much mroe it looks like a tim burton film than planet ofthe the apes did
( at times
, it seems liuke sleepy hollow 2
)
. the print i saw wasn ' t completelyl finished
( both colour
anbd music had not beeen finalized
, so noone comments about marilyn manson
)
,
but cinematographer peter deming
( don ' t say a word
) ably captures the dreariness of victorian
- era london
anbd helped amking the flashy killing scenes remind me ofthe the crazy flashbacks infact twin peaks
, even
though the violence in the film pales iin compairison to that inaddition the balck
-
and
- white comic
. oscar winner martin childs '
( shakespeare inthe lvoe
) prodcution desgin turns the orginal prague surroundings into one creepy palce
. even the acting in from hell is solid
, with the dreamy depp turning inwhich a typically strong performance
anbd deftly handling a british accent
. ians holm
( joe gould ' s secret
)
and richardson
( 102 dalmatians
) log in great supporting roles
,
but the big surprise here is graham
. i cringed the frist time she opened her mouth
, imagining her attempt at an irish accent
,
but it actually wasn ' t half bad
. teh film
,
however
, isnt all good
