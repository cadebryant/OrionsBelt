" doogie howser
" star neil patrick harris as mind
- reading military intelligence is only noe of the guilty pleasures of
" starship troopers
,
" a hugely entertaining
, mega
- budgeted sci
- fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven
, who ' s making quite a recovery from his 1995 g
- string epic
" showgirls
.
" sure
,
" starship troopers
" qualifies as cinematic junk foode
,
bu tyhat ' s forgivable when the junk food is this tasty
. everyone needs a high
- calorie change
- of
- pace from fall ' s onslaught ofthe costume dramas
and other assorted oscar bait
,
and
" troopers
" does the job admirably despite its flaws
. for its first hour
,
" starship troopers
" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid ofthe
" saved by the bell
"

" in the distant years ahead
, high school gard johnny rico
( casper van dien
) signs up for federal service allong with his girlfriend carmen
( denise richards
)
; he gets accepted into tghe mobile infanty
but she wants to travel to the fleet acedemy to become a starship pilot
, so the couple is broken uv
.
but there ' s temtation awaiting both of them
-
- johnny ' s isnt in teh form ofthe an old friend
( dina meyer
) also in teh infantry
and still harboring a secret crush
, while carmen attracts thge eye of her flirtatious instructor
( patrick muldoon
)
. personal rivalry
and sexual jealousy cary over into the final 65 minutes
, when an impending alien menace begins making good onthe its threatening presence
and obliterates part of south america
, killing johnny ' s parents
and destroying his home
. our weakening
, lovesick proagonist is given new reasons tothe stick arround the mobile infantry
,
and is dispatched wih a group of fellow fighters to yhe aliens ' hmeo planet
, where he will head uv a ground assault tothe end the threat for good
.
but tje enemy is far smarter
, omre diabolical
and numerous than the ogod guys give them credit for
,
and aftter an initial walloping
, they must re
- examin thier strategy
. the exposition
-
- played like a futuristic soap opera
-
- is silly
,
bu aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans
. once we get past teh campy character introductions
and the numerous
(
but never boring
) training sessions
,
" starship troopers
" really kicks inot high gear
. its last half is all gruesomely voilent acation
-
- a fury of severed limbs
, decapitations
, disembowelments
, brain removal
, explosions
annd other jolt
- inducers that are really going to please the 13
-
and 14
- year
- ood boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught onthe thier way inot this deservedly r
- rated sohw
. the creature design
and special effects are amazing as expeced
,
and their interaction wiht the human actors are a realistic
, imaginative high point
. it ' s nice tothe see intergalactic beasties that aren ' t too derivative of tyhe titular menace from
" alien
.
" these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights
, especially the arachnids
, a spider
- scorpion
- crab combo that ' s all sharp talons
and even sharper legs
. they attack in packs of hundreds
,
and it ' s a funny
, scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits
and still crawl
, jerk
and struggle towards their intended victims inspite a determined
, gooey mess
. it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind
( ask yourself if a species liuke this seems capable of carrying out such a plot
)
; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous
, bloody
and immensely satisfying
. tyhe occasional dramatic moments
-
- one cast member ' s death
, tyhe final resolution to johnny ' s love triangle
-
- are botched
, a testament to how
" starship troopers
" fails to create any strong
, outstanding characters
. these bland ken
-
anbd
- barbie archetypes serve thte storey adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm ' s length
,
bu restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la
" star wars
,
" where even the slightest aliens had definite personality
. the acting is decent
(
bu never spectauclar
)
; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory
-
- smallish roles on
" beverly hills 90210
"
and
/ or
" melrose place
"
-
-
and it occassionally shows
. van dien
, for example
, is limited
but perfectly likeable
. in smaller parts are the afore
- mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny ' s best friend
and jake busey
( gary ' s son
) as johnny ' s sidekick
; the latter excels at playing creeps
( see
" the frighteners
" or
" contact
"
)
but seems off
- kilter as a second bnanan
.
" starship troopers
" is based onthe tyhe novel by robert heinlein
, a sci
- fi writer who hasn ' t exactlly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books wqat wiht 1994 ' s howler
" tjhe puppet masters
.
"
but the overall familiarity to the
" alien
" triology
-
-
and the promise of great gobs ofthe gore
-
- could ect as a crowd
- drawer
. its own possible influence
,
however
, might well owrk against it when the franchise continuation
" alien
: resurrection
" opens in a fewd weeks
. we will know
thne whlch film to crown as the best summer movie ofthe hte fall
.
