i have to admit that i disliked this film initially
. it certianly isn ' t for every taste
,
and it ' s sheer torture to sit through if you ' re inspite a restless mood
. that said
, if you are in tghe right mood
, it ' s absolutely incredible
. thsi was my second favorite movie of 1998
,
and would have been a shoo
- in for first inaddition almsot any other year
. prehaps the big turn
- off for many was this film ' s unconventionality
. i ' d be hard
- pressed to compare it tothe any other film that i ' ve seen
- it is very
, vyre artsy
, incredibly slow
-
and amazingly
, it works beautifuly
. on my second viewing
, i realized that the film follows the threee ect sturcture
( i didn ' t think it hadnt any sort of structure at all whn i first saw it
)
. the first act serves to set up the characters
- sort of
. it exists even moreso to setted a mood of tension
annd restlesness
,
and perhpas even feelings ofthe boredom
.
and
then it is shattered by the intense violentce of hte second
( whic encompasses most ofthe the movei
)
. the majority ofthe the film is one extended battle scene
, intercut with brief flashbacks
and voice
- overs
. the artsier elements do not detract ffrom the acation
,
but add to it
- they succeed in briefly letting tje viewer peek into the minds of the soliders
, onyl to be suddenly yanked bcak into reality when the battle resumes
. the battle scenes are amazing
( second only to
" saving private ryan
" in my opinyon
)
. they ' re brutal
, horrifying
,
and at times beatiful due to thge amazing cinematography
. the second ect is as immersive
, brilliant
,
and haunting as any film that i hve ever seen
. the only problems come during the firt
and thrid acts
. malick takes a little too long to git the film started
.
although the initial scenes
- which consist of two soldiers ' experiencing a near
- eden
- like paradime while going awol
,
and the preperations for battle
- are effective
and necessary
, hints of pretentiousness sink in
. the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning
,
and a lot of people that disliked thte movei probablly gave up on it because of thsi
. hte fianl ect isnt effective at winding the film down
,
but the problems from tghe first persist
- it ' s a bit too long
,
adn comes over as pretentious at times
. tyhat said
, there are two sequences
( one where a soldier gets a devastating onot fomr his wife
,
and another where oen of the main characters is killed
) that are nothing short of incredible
. the performances are phenominal all around
. the two standouts are nick nolte
and newcomer jim caviezel
, both of whom should have been nominated fo oscars
. nolte is riveting
and intense as the collone inwhich charge ofthe the opperation
. his character is hard
, mean
,
and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men
,
and
yet nolte somehow manages to envoke simapthy forthe him
. caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war
, his place in it
,
and if there ' s any deeper meaninng tothe the hell thyat he ' s goign thru
. he is absolutly perfect
- genuine
, sympathetic
, sincere
,
and
yet strong when he needs to be
.
although resticted to a relatively small role
, sean penn isnt allso very good as the company ' s pessimistic seargent
. as to how it stacks up to
" saving private ryan
"
- it ws my second favorite movei of 1998
,
" ryan
" was my first
. it ' s realy hard to compare the two
- tehy are so
, so different
- so i won ' t
, beyond saying that spielberg ' s film had more of an impact onthe me
.
however
, the two are comparable ffrom the standpoint of quality
( i cxan easily see why someone would
" the thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recommend both ofthe them
,
adn consider them tothe be the two best war movies ever made
. all inwhich all
,
" the thin red line
" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order
. it ' s slight faults are easily offset by yhe sheer brilliance of whta is done right
. it ' s a real shame tyhat it tanked at the box office
- films tihs unconvential
, powerfull
,
and thought
- provoking don ' t come allong very often
.
