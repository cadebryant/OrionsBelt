mary norton ' s children ' s book series
, the borrowers
, has been made into several below
- average television movies
. so
, i wasn ' t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big
- screen debut of the minute clan
.
but i wass in fo a shock
, the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs
and even soem decent special effects
. the lender familiy is bieng thrown out of theri longtime home
. thier aunt
, who owned the property
, never left a will
. now
, an unscrupulous lawyer
, ocious potter
( john goodman
) plans to demolish the hous
annd replace it witht an ultra
- modern housing development
.
but the lenders are not alone in their house
. living under the floorboards isnt a famaly of borrowers
, 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers fomr the human
" beans
" above
. thge clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders
, expecially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the iwll which leaves the home to tje lenders
. so it is uv to the clocks
( pod
( jim broadbent
)
and homily
( celia imrie
)
, along with their kids
, arrietty
( flora newbigin
)
and peagreen
( tom felton
)
) tothe recover the will
and save the household
.
but when potter learns of teh tiny people
, he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff
( mark williams
) to kill off the clan
. there ' s plenty of attention tothe detail in the borrowers
, expecially infact the furnishings of the clock family house
, made out ofthe lost board game parts
and credit cards
. yhe backgorund details are nearly as rich as hte entertaining story
. the varios predicaments of the clock family are clever
anbd thrilling
. based on an original story
, the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential
and unusual perils that could exist for a 4
- inch tall person
. as the villin
, john goodman ' s performance veers on the edge ofthe being over
- the
- top
.
but his performence suits the role well
,
and he does vrey well iin the film ' s many slapstick moments
. with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets
, bluescreen shots
and cgi
, the special effects in tghe borrowers are very well done
. there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work
,
but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspention of disbelief
. hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children
- only movie
, fo it isnt surprisingly entertaining
and fun to watch
.
