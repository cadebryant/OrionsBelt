clint eastwood
, in his ripe old age
, is cashing one talent infront for anohter
. midnight in the garden ofthe good
and evil is an eastwood
- directed film clint isn ' t even in
,
annd it ' s damn good
. adapted fomr a best
- selling john berendt novel based on true events
, tihs movie is setted in the bizarre georgia town ofthe savannah
, where people walk invisible dogs
and attach horseflies to thier head
.
and tath ' s jsut the mayor
. as director
and producer
, eastwood contibutes a self
- indulgent
but vyer competant 150 minutes
, neatly balancing drama
, suspense
and humor
. like all great movies
, midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves
,
and not from some contrived
, juvenile intrusion
. the acting
, ffrom big
- time stars john cusack
anbd kevin spacey
, is as good as you ' d expect
,
but it ' s the supporting stable that gives the movei its offbeat charm
. cusack plays a free
- lance reporter sent to savannah to rwite a fluff story for town
& country magazine about one ofthe eccentric millionaire spacey ' s parties
. lots of food
, beverages
and gunplay
. yes
, an employee of spacey ' s has a huge argument inwhich front of cusack
and later turns up dead
. it seems like a simple matter of self
- defense
-
- the guy threatened spacey
, shooted at him
, missed
,
then spacey took him out
-
-
bu being a movie
, htere ' s much moreso to it than tath
,
adn cusack decides to stay in twon
and wriet a book about tjhe murder
, a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in
. tghe weird circle of entertainment
. this is where the stable of supporting cahracters comes inaddition
. there ' s the requisite sexy woman
( alison
" nepotist ' s daughter
" eastwood
)
, the strange piano player
, the voodoo woman
and the transvestite
. miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his
/ her own
, as tyhe stealer of eveyr scene she appears in
-
- waht would this movei be without the castilian scene
and her testamony
? chablis
, playing herself
, is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul
,
but never seems exploited as the movie ' s comic relief or out ofthe palce infront a basically serious movei
. there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes
, which these days almost never seem welcome in a movei
,
but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating
. certainly the characterizations ofthe the judge
and spacey ' s lawyer both help immensely
, as does having the fly
- guy as tjhe jury ' s foreman
. it ' s here we realize the case boils down tothe an indictment of spacey ' s homosexuality
. yes
, spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man
-
- before he shot him
, of course
. midnight in the garden of good
and evil isn ' t a clasic
,
bu it is one of the better celebrity
- directed
, true
- stoyr best
- seller adaptations out there
. likewise
, no oney from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations
,
but the performances are all graet
. in fact
, i ' d alomst recommend that the acadmey add a best supporting transvestite category
. serving amercia fo more than 1
/ 25th of a century
