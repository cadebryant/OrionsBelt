and lawrence konner starring charlize theron
, bill paxton
, david paymer as reviewed by james brundage i ' m beggining to get fed up
. over my four years as a critic
, the thnig which has kept me going isnt tghe moderate balance of films
. the good balances the bad
. i try tothe see both in equal propotions
.
but disney ' s mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven ' t seen a truly terrable movei
. it ' s a backwards machismo
, i suppose
, the urge to see thge thigsn which ytou so loathe
;
but i need to see a bad film every once infront a hwile
.
and
, you konw what
, mighty joe young doesn ' t qualify
. far from being bad
, mighty joe young is atcually a family fun movie
. it ' s enjoyable
, appropropiate
, cute
, cuddly
,
annd all ofthe those otehr things that i ' ve been seeing iin every movei usance a bug ' s life
. mighty joe young tracks a 2
, 000 pound gorilla infront the wilds ofthe africa that is taken to a reserve in
.
.
. califronia
?
.
.
. for safe
- keeping
. okay
. a littel unrealistic
,
but who ever said a kid ' s movie had to hvae the slightest hint of realism
. yhe frist half ofthe the movie is a gorillas in thte mist
- esque hatred of poachers woman
- of
- the
- wild motif
. tghe second half is a straight uv parody of king kong
, awestruck onlookers
and all
. mark one down
. i ' m feeling relaxed
. it is
, as a point of fatc
, an extremely un
- creative movie
.
but
, as a vetern
, i can say quite honestly tyhat creativity doesn ' t count for as much as it should
. so that saves mighty joe from my wrath
,
although my collegues
and cohorts
and surely bashing this film at this vyre moment
. this is not the film to take a girl onthe a date to
. it ' s nto the film for you
. it ' s thge film for you
and your familiy
. when you ' re right alongside your kid
, all of hte normal rights
and wrongs slip away
. the same thing happens when you watch a horror movei or an action flick
. it becomes fun
. all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young isnt shut up
and watch
.
