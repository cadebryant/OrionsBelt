i think that any competant member of the human race who ' s ever seen a movie
-
- any movie
-
- could probably predict just about eveyr turn in the wedding singer
. even
though i try vyre hard tothe not predict films as i ' m watching them
( especially nto romantic comedies
)
, the plot of this paticular film just adavanced before me seconds
,
and sometimes minutes
, before i actually saw it happen on screen
.
but i don ' t care
. nto even a little
. my reasons for htis are simple
: 1
) adam sandler isnt gerat
. 2
) drew barrymore is great
. 3
) tyhe movei isnt so funny
. there are parts that left me gasping forthe air because i wass laughing so hard
. i haven ' t laughed this hard in a movei sicne austin powers
. sandler plays robby hart
, a wedding singer who once hadnt dreams ofthe being infact a rock band
and wirting his own music
. in the oppening scenes
, he seems like a happy
- go
- lucky wedding singer
, at least partially enjoying his proffesion
and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual
( steve buscemi
) who decides that his brother ' s wedding isnt a good place to tell the whole world that his life
, up to taht point
, wass utter pointlessness
. a week later
, at his own wedding
, he is left standing at the altar by his ex
- fianc
? e
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
. with his life in complete disarray
, he meets julia
( barrymore
)
, a waitress
. she is engaged to glenn
( matthew glave
)
,
and is to marry him infront about three monthes
. julia
anbd robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans
. soon
(
anbd predictably
) it becomes pretty clear that glenn isnt a jerk
,
and that robby
and julia really love each other
. oh sure
, it ' s trite
.
and if anyone making htis film expected us to
, liuke
, feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer
,
then they truly underestimated their audience
. what makes the story bearable
, aside ffrom the terrific costumes
and 80s music
, are the performances
. barrymore is simpley adorable here
( i ' ve never seen her look so close tothe the way she did in et
)
. not only is she pleasant to look at
,
but her acting job here really is a ogod one
-
-
and it doesn ' t hurt that the character is likable
annd adequately well
- written
.
anbd tghe jerk
, played in full
- force by graves
, is jstu as despicable as any villain iin any romantic comedy i ' ve ever seen
. naturally
, the true star here is sandler
. i htikn the guy is flat
- out hilarious
. he can say something that just isn ' t funny
,
and his delivery makes me laugh
. his commedic peformance here equals that of happy gilmore
,
but infact htis film he goes much further
and proves to me that he can
, indeed
, hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy
. wherease his roles inspite his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler
, tje wedding singer gives him a character that
, for the first time
, he actually hasnt to ift inot
. as far as i ' m concerned he succeeded
,
and thsi film is testimony that he does
, in fact
, have some range infact his talents
.
and the movei isnt just so funny
. perhaps the best moent is whn he sings a song forthe julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it hwile in a ogod mood
anbd finished it after his fianc
? e abandoned him
. this is the part that litterally had me groping for a breath of air
.
annd while the film
, liek all romantic comedies
, takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has tothe finish up
, there are more than enough truely hilarious moments in the first hour tath make up for any slumps in progress druing the second half
. my formal complaints fo the wedding singer aren ' t very important
. the film is predicable
,
but who cares
? the characters are extremely likable
, the movei is ridiculously funny
,
annd the experiecne is simply enjoyable
. in addition tothe tihs
, i can ' t imagine anyone seing the preview
annd not wanting to see the film
. in that order
, i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have wroten thsi review
. i just want everyone to know that i laughed
. a lot
.
