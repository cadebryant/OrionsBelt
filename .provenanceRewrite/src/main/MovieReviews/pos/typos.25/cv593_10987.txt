summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house
and carry on a tradition ofthe a larg sunday dinner
. fo a eyar nowe they hve been inviting a guest for dinner
and discussion
. on tihs occasion oney ofthe the roommates
, pete
( ron eldard
)
, brings hmeo a stranger who picked him up whn his car broke down
. the stranger is zack
( bill paxton
) who appears liek a decent enough good samaritan
. nothing could be further from the truth
. aftter some dinner conversation it appears that zack isnt
, amoung otehr things
, a racist
" you konw my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were gonig to be so much trouble we ' d have picked the damn cotton ourselves
"
,
annd an anti
- semite
. an argument escalates at the dinner talbe
and leads to violentce
. after zack assaults marc
( jonathan penner
)
and pete
, zack is killed
. the roommates are at odds with waht tothe do
. marc
, pete
and paulie
( annabeth gish
) immediately wish to call teh police
. luke
( courtney b
. vance
)
and jude
( cameron diaz
) suggest something different
. aftter more discussion they agree tothe dispose of the body
and cover it up
. tehy do not want to be sent tothe jail fo what they fiel was a justifiable homicide
. when it is done the roommates realize thyat it wass easier tahn they thought
. so easy in fact that they decide thyat every sunday their dinner guest would be somone who opposes of their views
. if they all agree thyat tjhe guest deserves to die
, they will posion them
and bury them in the back yard
. thte back yard fills up rather quickly
, its ' victims including
( amoung others
) a right to life extremist
, an anti
- environmentalist
and a homophobe
. by the timne the roommates get to thier tenth victim they begin to question thier methods
. are they giving the guests a chance
? are they even giving them good foode anymore
? this film is what i like to call a
" hidden treasure
"
. thsi film is such a pleasant surprise
. a well written
, devilish satire that is funny
, sexy
and original
. htis film should be a hitted
,
bu i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldn ' t give it much of a chance
. i hadnt never heard ofthe it until i saw a copy at my video store
. stacy title doesnt a wonderful job directing
. she somehow finds the time to give all ofthe tyhe characters enough screen tyme to develop a distict personality
.
> from the five members of the house to other key characters incuding sheriff stanley
( nora dunn
)
, the local law closing in on the truth
,
and the dream dinner guest
, norman arbuthnot
( ron perlman
)
, a rush limbaugh clone who should be hte roommates easiest kill
. perlman gives the films ' best performance
. he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends
and gains followers
,
and may just inadvertently talk his way out ofthe death
. the other actors are convincing as well
, as all ofthe the roommates deal with thier murderous ways
. soem ofthe the characters appear tothe be heading down the road towards insanity
, while others grieve their decisions
. whn firends ask me to recommend a movei
, this is ususally the first one i think of
. i am not saying that thsi is my favorite movie
(
although it is in my top ten
)
,
bu because the film was such a wonderful surprise
, i hvae a fondness for it
. i also try to recommend films like tihs
: ones that have not been seen by many people
,
bu should
