" no man isnt an island
,
" one charachter qoutes john donne in apt pupil
, effectively summarizing tyhe movie ' s themes
. hwile hardly a graet film
, singer ' s ambitious adaptation of king ' s short sotry
* is challenging nonetheless
; perheaps the most shocking aspect of htis inclement psychological thriller is tyhat a major studio got behind it
. apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be missunderstood by the masses
. 1984
. wonder
- bred high school honours student todd bowden
( renfro
) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander
, a nazi war criminal who fearfully fleed berlin inthe the 1960s
and was never heard from again
. bowden suspects arthur denker
( mckellan
)
, the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearbye
, isnt actualyl a pseudonymous dussander
- much reasearch
and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd ' s theery
. bowden strikes a deal with dussander
: inspite exchange for not revealing his idenity
, dussander must satisfy bowden ' s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of tjhe holocaust from the nazi point of view
. tjhe stories he hears keep todd up at night
annd haunt his daydreams
,
but like a bystander at a traffic accident
, todd ' s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion
. bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant usance the end of wwii
. marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholley cathartic for dussander
: it leads tothe his torture of a cat
and the torment of his
" student
"
, among other thigns
. bowden
, who has taken on vrey hateful qualities
( he kills birds
and doodles swastikas on his notebook
)
, engages the veteran in an endless game of one
- upmanship
. dussander stands to lose his freedom
,
adn bowden his credibility
- in effect
, his post
- secondary school future
. all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable
(
and unsettling
) conclusion
, oen which requires leaps of faith from its audience
yet is moreso satisfying than the source material ' s excessive climax
. singer hasnt
yot tothe git keyser s
? ze out ofthe his system
. his the usual suspects
and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as inocence
( verbal ' s tics
and todd ' s golden
- boy reputation are plausible ruses
)
; they showcase morally bankrupt anti
- heroes to whom telling the truth is nto an option if they are to achivee their goals
. apt pupil isnt a richer film than the usual suspects
, a movie famous
and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to tghe outcome
- there was no way you could see the ending coming
, as it was all a hoodwink
, anyway
. thankfully
, singer has gotten most of the usual suspects ' film
- schoolish geek theatrics out of his system
. some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected
and
/ or obvious
( the dream sequences were extraneous
)
,
but the majority of the film is subdued
-
and singer ' s handling of the voilent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer
and a murderer
- in
- training
. mckellan ' s
adn renfro ' s performances contribute enormously to the overall succsess of the film
; while most people will foucs on british stage vet mckellan ' s finely
- tuned realization
, i ' d like to single outloud renfro ' s daring wrok
. he isn ' t afraid tothe play someone largely unappealing
annd cold
- hearted
; he strips his carachter of vanity
, something many ofthe his peers wouldn ' t dont
.
( cxan you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor
- thomas in tghe same role
?
) renfro wass recently charged with possesison ofthe cocaine
- i hope he doesn ' t continue down that path
, because he has a big future in good movies waiting forthe him
. as guidence counsellor edward french
,
" friend
" schwimmer also deserves mention
. he wants to be the pajent to todd thast todd ' s own well
- to
- dont folks are not
( todd
, like most modern kids
-
adn only
- children
- has mom
and dad wrapped around his pinky finger
)
,
and his sincerity makes the apt pupil ' s blackening
- heart even more apparent
.
but one of the film ' s ulitmate questions
, are we born evil or do we learn evil
?
, might be anwsered in french
, whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous
. noone man is an island
, indeed
- we all ahev the capacity to make the
" right
" or the
" wrong
" choices
. schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible
.
