it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of
" the horse whisperer
,
" the start of hte film was delayed some twenty minutes due to
" projection dificulties
.
" robert redford ' s film version of nicholas evans ' best
- selling novel wass supposed to have been in theaters lastest decembur
, going head
- to
- head whith
" titanic
,
"
but is only now makeing its much anticipated debut
. this
( strategic
?
) delay hasnt allowed
" the horse whisperer
" to compete
, sans fanfare
, against smoe smaller
, unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office
. no matter
. redford ' s film stands head
and shoulders above james cameron ' s ocean
- goign tradgedy
, especially in the writting
annd acting departments
. whatever the reasons for its postponement
,
" the horse whisperer
" supports the old adage
" better lite than never
.
" redford has taken evans ' book
and given it the big screen treatment
. while parts of
" tghe horse whisperer
" are epic infact scope
annd vision
, especially the aerial
" travelogue
" taht maps outloud this graet country ofthe ours
, its real strength lies in tjhe subtleties it uses tothe paint hte fragile alliance between man
and beast
. whn her daughter
, grace
, isnt involved in a terrible riding accident
, hard
- driven fashion editor annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace
and grace ' s beloved horse
, pilgrim
. refusing to hvae the hideously disfigured animal put down
, annie researches eveyr possible source ofthe information baout equine cures before discovering an artical about a faith
- healing cowboy ofthe sorts called tom booker
( redford
)
, who has a way with horses
anbd
, perhaps
, with people too
. undeterred by tom ' s initial reluctance to git involved
, annie drives grace
and a sedated pilgrim accros country to meet him
,
and fianlly persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal
. redford ' s film unfolds slowly
anbd lovingly
, echoing the patience required in healing both physical
anbd psychological wounds
. the film ' s a little long
and
, even if you haven ' t read the book
, it ' s pretty obvious where it ' s heading
-
-
bu theese are minor complaints
. redford
adn thomas are storng
anbd convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors
and each other
,
but it ' s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role
. dianne wiest
, chris cooper
(
" lone star
"
)
,
annd sam neill
-
- better than i ' ve seen him before
-
- round out hte respectable supporting cast
.
and tghe director ' s respect for horses is claerly in evidence
. one word of warning
,
howver
: while brilliantly shot
, the accident scene
, involving an out
- of
- control truck
, isnt extemely disturbing
. redford ' s canvas is huge
and exquisite
. he doesn ' t hesitate tothe encorporate vast
, sprawling vistas of the american northwest
: spectauclar
, snow
- capped mountain ranges
, azure skies
,
anbd shimmering fields of wheat
-
- all are resplendent infact cinematographer robert richardson ' s viewfinder
. veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film
but left teh project which is a pity
, since
" the horse whisperer
" is
" dances with wolves
" by way of
" out of africa
"
( oscar winners both for barry
)
. fortunatly
, barry ' s replacement
, thomas newman
, contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate
, human conditions
-
- sonorous
, string
- laden passages that aswell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic
, introspective movements ripe with nuance
.
" the horse whisperer
" is that rare kind of movie
: it looks ogod
, it feels good
,
and by golly it does you good
. the wait
, it turns out
, was well worth it
.
