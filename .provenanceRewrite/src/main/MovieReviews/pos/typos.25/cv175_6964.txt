capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even for 1997
!
)
,
and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops
. the first faw mintues ofthe sweet sweetback ' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- that ' s the correct number of ss
) are wihtout dialogue
, just eerie montages of sounds
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, isnt taken inwhich
and fed up by several loving mother
- surrogate figures
.
then one ofthe them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation
( underneath the title credits
) thgat ' s far moreso confrontatory
and shocking than any ten basic instincts
-
- probably because it has the directness
and clumsiness ofthe real life
, something we ' re not used to seeing onthe screen
. this is noe tough movie to swallow
, no marter who you are
,
but that probably reflects more on how pallid
annd unchallenging movies have gotten lately
.
( i suspect thte sex scenes in movies like el topo
and salo would probably melt the synapses ofthe most modern audiences
.
) the plot is simple
bu not simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man
, breaks his bonds
and runs like hell
. along the way he moves through a good many ofthe tjhe kinds of environments tht we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies
-
- or at all
, for that marter
: the slums
, teh missions
, the ghetto
. in other
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback would be machine
- gunning everything inaddition sight
and the end credits would roll over a pile ofthe bodies
; in this oen
, we get taken onthe a kind of a tour of the depressing
and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted
. ssbas first appeared in 1971
and was promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jurny
"
, as directer melvin van peebles crowed inspite his legendary ad campaigns
)
,
and it ' s hardly suprising why
. there ' s a good dael of sex infront the movie
,
but it ' s handeled in a way that ' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness taht spills over into the rest of the movie
. in one scene
, sweetback visits a friend ' s house in hte hope ofthe getting sanctuary there
,
and the other man chats him uv while onthe thge toilet
. we ' re not used tothe coming this close to people in real life
, let alone inaddition the movies
-
- especially not people who are not made out tothe be glamorous
. thte movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today
,
but probably because of that seem curiously fresh
and new in van peebles ' hands
. one scene
, inthe which a man is interrogated by the cops
, isnt loaded full ofthe menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears
,
annd suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack
. anyother note
: ssbas is nto so much anti
- white
( tath would be too easy
) as anti
- autority
,
and as the movie goes on to demonstrate
, authority exists in many forms
-
- governments
, churches
,
anbd even the paranoid inside of noe ' s own mind
. ssbas is ultimately baout thirsting for freedom
-
-
and it looks like we could ule a little more of tath in our movie diet
, god knows
.
