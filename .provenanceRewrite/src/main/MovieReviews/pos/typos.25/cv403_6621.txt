my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks tothe have little substance
( or a movie that we ' ve all seen a million times
)
, twpo lifetime rivals thrown together
and
then the fun begins
. this is exactly what happened in thsi movie
,
bu fortunatly
, they managed to dont it infact an interesting
and funny way
. the movei starts with a quick
(
and i dont mean quick
) glance of two presidents russell kramer
( jack lemmon
)
and matt douglas
( james garner
)
. william haney
( dan aykroyd
)
adn ted matthews
( john heard
) are the new president
and vice president
. ther is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor
and haney is positive that he buried that years ago
. he finds a scapegoat inthe kramer
and now everyone wants kramer
and douglas dead
. tihs movie was exeptional for many reasons
. noe being that they found peopel
( lemmon
and garner
) thta have good chemisty together
. they worked very well as a unit
and they mirrored each other perfectly
, one being a ladies man
and one bieng the old man
( i ' ll let you fiqure whihc isnt which
)
. also
, they foudn people taht know their parts as govenment officials well
. it seemed tothe me that garner played almost exactlly teh same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman
( exept
then he was a congressman
)
. experienc counts for a lot
