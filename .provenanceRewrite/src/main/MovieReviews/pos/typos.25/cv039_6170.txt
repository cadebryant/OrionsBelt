tyhat thing you dont
!
( r
) toom hanks ' s screenwriting
anbd directorial debut
, that thing ytou do
!
, has all yhe qualities yuo would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment
: funn
, lively
,
and oh
- so
- nice
. it is the latter quality
,
however
, that becomes a hindrance
, for this ' 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice
and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast
. tht thing focusses on the wonders
, a teen rock band from erie
, pennsylvania that isnt suddenly thrust inot the national spotlight in 1964 wehn they score a major dance hitted called
, of course
,
" that thing ytou dont
!
" tjhe group ' s members are
, naturally a diverse gropu
: htere ' s brooding lead singer
and songwriter jimmy
( johnathon schaech
)
; girl
- crazy lenny
( steve zahn
)
, the lead guitarist
; a goofy
, geeky tipe known only as the bass player
( ethan embry
)
;
annd the film ' s center
, guy
( tom everett scott
)
, the drummer who hasnt aspirations in jazz
. along fo tyhe wonders ' ride to success is jimmy ' s perpetually neglected galpal
, faye
( liv tyler
)
. hanks proves to be a capable writer
- director
, deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964
, whcih hanks calls
" the last innocent year
.
" yhe spirit is not onyl reflected in the period clothes
and settings
bu also in the music
, which
, like teh other recent period music film
, grace ofthe my heart
, ws expressly written for the film
; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes
-
-
bu not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger
, which is guarenteed tothe stay in your head long aftter the end credits have rolled
( it ' s still palying in my mind as i write thsi
)
. it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well iwth tjhe actors
, eliciting charming
, likable work from the entire casted
, most notably hanks lookalike scott
and tyler
, who isnt remarkable in delivering thte film ' s biggest
adn best dramatic moment
. the work of the young ensemble is so natural thast they truly convince as teens of the eary ' 60s
; htey do not apear tothe be ' 90s grungers playacting
" retro
.
"
yet for all tghe light
, frothy charms of that hting you do
!
, it ' s nearly nice to a fault
. while this unbridled innocence in film isnt a refreshing change from all tje sinful cinema around theese days
, htere is nto enough conflict tothe keep things consistantly interesting
. everyone is so happy
, basking in teh glow ofthe overnight success
, marvelling at it all
-
- except toward tjhe end
,
but even
then thte tone quickly reverts tothe sweetness
, ending onthe an appropriately fiel
- good note
. ther isn ' t much of an edge throughout that thing
-
- the only hting that is remotely edgy is hanks ' s turn as the wonders ' manager
-
-
and thus becomes in danger of bieng so nice it ' s bland
.
but a little niceness goes a long way these days
,
and there ' s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you dont
!
; it ' s just about impossible to hate
. it ' s an inoffensive
, enjoyable piece of nestolgia that is sure tothe leave audiences smiling
and humming
, if not singing
,
" that thing you dont
!
"
-
- quite possibly for days
. tothe paraphrase a passage fomr the song
:
though i try
and try to foreget that song it isnt just so hard to do every tyme htey play
" that thing you do
!
