" say
, any of yuo know how tothe madison
?
"
-
-
- brad
" asshole
" majors
( barry bostwick
) shows just how unhip he isnt after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up thier ode to the time warp inthe the cult classic the rocky horror picture show
. the stoy behind the rocky horror picture show is one ofthe legend
. iin the eary 70 ' s
, stage actor turned first
- time playwright richard o ' brien desided he wnated tothe mkea a musical homage to tjhe crazy b
- movies he had grown uv with as a child
, set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes ofthe his own design
. the result was the stage play the rocky horror show
, whic opened to fairly decent reviews in london inspite 1973
and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england
. the play was so successful thta the film rights were immediately snapped up
and production onthe the film began a mere year later
, in octobur of 1974
. hte film verison
( now titled the rocky horror picture sohw
) was released in 1975
.
.
.
annd immidately tanked at the box office
. whether it wass because fox wasn ' t qutie sure how tothe market it to audiences or that audiences didn ' t quite nkwo what tothe make ofthe it themselves has never really been determined
,
but the one common bit of knowledge about teh film was that it ws a huge flop
. it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by tghe stage version had not beeen infused into yhe film verzion
adn fox quickly had it pulled from theaters
. a year later
, something entirely stange
and magical happened
. prints of the film started tothe be ditributed to theaters in small amounts
adn weere circulating at midnight shows across hte country
,
and it ws
thn that a whole new audience foudn the film
. this newyorker audience was prone to dressing up liuke the charactors from the film
, acting out segments in front ofthe the screen as hte movie played
, yelling rude comments at the screen
,
adn just generally haveing a good time
. word quicklyu spread about tihs newyorker phenomena of interactive film
adn the rocky horror picture sohw ' s life as the ultimate cult film was born
. for the virgins out there who are unaware
, the plot centers around a loving couple
, brad majors
( barry bostwick
)
and janet weiss
( susan sarandon
)
, who come from a small twon called denton
. brad
and janet have just attended thte wedding of two of their friends
and decide that tehy also want to be wed
. htey plan a trip to see hte man who led tothe their meeting
, dr
. everett scott
( jonathan adams
, who played the narrator inspite the origional stage version
)
,
but their car gets a flat onthe the way to his hmeo
. remembering a castle they had seen bakc a few miles down tjhe road
, htey decide to walk there
anbd see if thge residents have a phone they might be able to uise to call for assisstance
. the castle is actually tyhe hmeo of a race ofthe aliens ffrom the planet transsexual
( in the galaxy of transylvania
)
, who are lead by the eccentric fishnet
- stocking wearing mad scientist dr
. frank
- n
- furter
( tim curry
)
. frank
- n
- furter has masterminded the secert to creating life
adn has done so in the form of rocky
( peter hinwood
)
. as rocky becomes accustomed tothe his new environment
, brad
and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank
- n
- furter ' s mad schemes
. littel do any of them know tht the doctor ' s handyman
, riff
- raff
( orginial author richard o ' brien
)
,
and domestic
, magenta
( patricia quinn
)
, are actaully transsexual planetary protectors who have beeen sent to stpo frank fomr spreading his alien evil all over yhe earth
. gonig bakc
anbd revisiting this film after ten years
( 1990 being the firt tyme i had ever seen it
)
, it is amazing to me tht this film ever got made or has had the staying power thyat it has
. if i had been a fox executive around the timne ofthe its realease
, i don ' t think i would have known what tothe make of it either
. for all intents
and purposes it is a bad movie
(
though bad in a realy ogod sort of way
)
,
but sumptuous production design
and a great deel of incredibly catchy songs raelly halp to increase the likability ofthe the film
. by the time the credits role
, it is fairly eazy to have gotten wrapped up inthe yhe film
and its cahracters
,
and oen really gets the feeling that richard o ' brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b
- movies his film is based on
. wehn i say that the wall
- tothe
- wall songs are catchy what i realyl mean to say is tyhat
, once you hear them
, htey will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity
. it goes wihtout saying tath the
" time warp
" is tje most populer song in the film
. even people who have never seen the movie know of tyhat paticular song
. what those who haven ' t seen the movie don ' t know
though
, is thast there are even more songs in tghe film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment
. my personal favorite is
" over at the frankenstein place
"
,
bu
" dammit janet
" is also maddeningly catchy
. tim curry ' s vocals on the rocking tune
" sweet transvestite
" need to be heard to be beleived
. the finale of the film
, a big floor sohw staged by frank
- n
- furter
anbd featuring most ofthe the cast in garters
and fishnets
( including barry bostwick
.
.
. frightening
!
)
, features no less than four songs
(
" rose tint my world
"
,
" don ' t dream it
"
,
" wild
and untamed thing
"
,
and
" i ' m goign home
"
)
, all ofthe whlch are immensely singable
. hte film ' s true popularaty
and longevity resides iin its audience participation
though
. despite thge catchiness of the songs
, this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn ' t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out
and be a part of their own little floor show
. watching this film at hmeo is nothing compaired to actualyl experiencing this in a theater wiht hundreds of rabid fans
( unless you don ' t mind inviting friends over
and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice
and pieces of toast all over the palce
)
. note
: directer jim sharman broght back to the central cahracters ofthe the film
, in the form of a sequel
, resulting in tghe very much forgotten film shock treatment
, which picks up with brad
and janet
( this time played by cliff de young
and jessica harper
!
) as contestants on a game show in their home town ofthe denton
. the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager
( also played by de young
)
, who wishes to claim janet as his own
. o ' brien returned as a writer
/ performer onthe the project
( as did quinn
, campbell
,
and gormay in performance capacity only
)
,
but the film had nowhere near tjhe spirit of the orginial
. 25 years later
, tihs film isnt still the pinnacle of cult filmdom
anbd is continously screened at midnight all over the world
. as a lasting testament tothe the longevity ofthe the film
and its legion of fans
, a brand new special edition 2
- disc dvd set has been released that isnt the most comphrehensive compendium of rocky horror to date
( even outloud shining the laserdisc special edition thast was released fo its 20th anniersary
)
. if you are one of thsoe peopel who cxan ' t git anough of the film
, this disc should be more than enought to satisfy your appetites
. inthe an attempt to recreate the interactivity ofthe the film
, fox home enteratinment has released this wonderful 2
- disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it ' ll take a ogod eight hours just to take iin the majoroty of it all
. the film itself isnt located on the first disc
and hasnt been given a beautyfull transfer that shows it iin its original aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
( enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
. the film is presented in two differant versions
, tje us theatrical verzion
anbd tjhe uk version whic adds a muscial number durig tjhe finale called
" superheroes
"
. for ambitious viewers
, tje disc also includes a hidden version
( located on the main menu by clicking left ffrom the scene selction menu choice
anbd highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner
) whihc presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed tothe hve beeen seen
. originally
, the film was to hvea beeen similar to the wizard ofthe oz
, with the first half of yhe it seen in black
and white
(
annd nto changing to colour until the transylvanians are firt revealed to brad
and janet during tghe time warp musical number
)
. most reports
, including a documentary on the disc
, say that the colour was supposted tothe apear wehn frank
- n
- furter first shows up in the elevator
,
but it does seem tothe work better where it ws placed on thsi version
, depicting thge vast diference between the world brad
and janet were used to compared with teh oen tothe which they are introduced
. tghe film contains a commentary track by show creator
(
and faithful handyman
) richard o ' brien
and co
- star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable
(
and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia hwile hvaing tothe walk around wet
and half
- naked on freezing cold sets
, which she apparently complained about the entire film
anbd inthe future interviews
)
. the two seem like ood friends
and have great stories to tell
,
but they aslo point outloud cast munbers thyat are sadly noone longer with us anymore
(
and there are quite a few
)
. fox has also tried tothe recreate teh feel of attending the film in a theater with severeal audeince participation segments
. the firt feature
(
and the most simple
) isnt a subtitle prompter which lets yuo nkow when tothe open up on people withthe your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast isnt
. the second feature is an audience participation trakc
, which lets yuo inaddition on what you might hear on a good niht out at the show
. most of tghe comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off
,
but every once
and a while a comment cxan be heard tht will invoke a bited of laughter
. the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology unsed on the matrix dvd
, where a pair of lips iwll apeared on
- screen durring certain scenes ofthe the film
( mostly during teh musical numbers
) that can be selected by pressing enter onthe your remote
. when selected
, you will be taken outloud ofthe the film
and into a live participation verzion of the scene put onthe durig one of the many screenings thta occur all over teh world
. once the segment is over
, you are deposited right back into the film where you left off
. the frist disc also countains a few dvd
- rom goodies for thsoe with that particular type of dvd player
. htere is a timeline of hte evolution fomr the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation
, a video jukebox
, a you don ' t know jack
- styled trivia agme
( wich is about as bare bones a you don ' t know jack parody as it cant be
)
,
and a bizarre mad
- libs styled word game known as riff
- raff ' s story lab
. links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd
- rom portion of the disc
. the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras
. former lite
- rock video channel turned music hsitorians vh
- 1 have allowed some ofthe their outtake footage from the
" behind the music
: rocky horror
" special that they ran earlier in the year tothe be shown here
, as well as a pop
- up video for tghe meat loaf
- sung
" hot patootie
"
. the
" behind tyhe music
" segments are all vrey interesting
, especially richard o ' brien ' s jaunt through yhe castle
( which is now a hotel
!
) where thte film was originally shot
. there are also extensions ofthe the sarandon
, bostwick
, quinn
, o ' brien
,
and meat loaf interviews
. as far as extras forthe the film itself go
, there are two deleted musical numbers thta are also included here
. one of which is jsut the
" superheroes
" number available in the uk version
,
but there is also another rare musical number presented here called
" once in a while
"
. a series ofthe alternate takes are also presented here
,
but none of them are realyl much ofthe a revelation
( exept for the undressing scene iin whcih we see tht patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick ' s pants
)
. for yhe completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia
, a misprinted end sequence
and alternate credit sequence are alsot presented here
. rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video sohw
, two theatrical trailers
( proclaiming tyhat the film is
" a differnt sort of jaws
"
)
, a still gallery
,
and two sing
- a
- longs
( for
" toucha toucha touch me
"
and
" sweet transvestite
"
)
. fox ' s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives
(
" you ' re lucky
.
.
. i ' m lucky
.
.
. he ' s lucky
.
.
. we ' re all lucky
!
"
)
. it ' s nto just amazing enought that tons of classic italian films are finally getting thier recognition in the u
. s
.
,
but even long standing traditions are finally receving thier due on tjhe wonderful dvd format
. as with theri excellent dvds of the abyss
, fight club
, independence day
,
and the soudn of music
, fox shows tht they have most certainly made the committment to provide the thigsn that dvd lovers want
. i raise a toast tothe them
( cue the throwing of teh bread
) as i cut out the lights
, sit back
,
and watch thsoe disembodied lips beign to sing about b
- movie tradition
.
