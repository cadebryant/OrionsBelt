melvin van peebles '
" sweet sweetback ' s baadasssss song
" was a watershed moment in the history ofthe american cinema
and tje black movement
. it wass released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun
and almost twenty eyars before the rodney king incident
. its violent
and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting bakc against white oppression
and winning was something tht hadnt never been seen on an american movie screen before
. in style
, content
,
and how it was conceived
anbd produced
,
" sweet sweetback
" wass a cinematic revolution
, whther or not one agrees with its subject marter
. van peebles
, a balck american who frist gained recognition by writing novels infact france
, builded
" sweet sweetback
" fomr teh ground uv almost entirely by himself
. because no studio would dare fund such a film
, he was forced tothe raise all the mnoey himself
. teh movei ended up costing baout
$ 500
, 000
, part of which wass put uv by none other than bill cosby
. van peebles cut costs by hiring non
- union labor
and taking on most ofthe the film ' s responsibilities himself
. he wrote the script
, scored the music
, edited
and directed the film
, as well as starred infact the central role
. he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who allways found a way to make an extra buck
. for instance
, when thte mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x
- rating
, van peebles not only threatend to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti
and the mpaa
,
but he also developed a little marketing scheme
: he coined thge phrases
" rated x by an all
- white jurny
,
" which he put on the movie posters tothe help advertise the film
. he also printed the phrase on tee
- shirts which he had no probelm selling
. the storyline in
" sweet sweetback
" is deceptively simple
. it tkaes place infront los angeles
,
and van peebles stars as the title charachter
, a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel
,
and mkaes money by doing what he doens best
: having sex
. one day
, he agrees to go with a couple ofthe amiable white cops down to the station to mkea it look like they ' re bringing in suspects on a politically
- charged case involving murder
.
however
, on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu
- mu
( hubert scales
)
, who they proceed to beat viciously
. acting outloud ofthe complete impulse rather than political motivation
, sweetback fights bcak
and beats the cops to the brink of death
. the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades tje cops on his way to eventual excape in mexico
.
although the repetition ofthe watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film
, this plot allows van peebles ' camera to roam teh darker side of l
. a
.
- the ghettos
, alleys
,
and back
- street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked
. van peebles ' entire point in making the movei wass to secure on celluloid a vision of the balck expierence infront america that other filmmakers hadnt ignored
. at the beginning of
" sweet sweetback
,
" he offers htis epigraph
, which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messanger brought bad news
:
" sire
, theese lines are not an homage to brutality that thge artist has invented
,
but a hymn from tyhe mouth of reality
.
.
.
" van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality
, not of exaggeration
. ofthe course
, with today ' s abundance ofthe raph
and hip hop music thgat sings tghe smae ode tothe balck inner
- city life
, as well as films by spike lee
, john singleton
,
annd the hughes brothers
,
" sweet sweetback
" doesn ' t seem all taht revolutionary
. it is important to remember thyat thsi film must be viewed inspite thte context
and time period in which it ws made
. at that time
,
" sweet sweetback
" wass so controversial that only twpo theaters in the entire united states would play it
. distributors were petrified ofthe a film that
, inspite van peebles ' words
, gave the black audience
" a chance to see some of thier own fantasies acted out
- about rising outloud of the mud
adn kicking ass
.
" of course
, once it caught on
, it caught on big
.
" sweet sweetback
" is now concidered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era
,
allthough van peebles disassociates
" sweetback
" from other movies liuke
" shaft
"
( 1972
)
anbd
" the mack
"
( 1973
)
, because thsoe were financed by big hollywood studios
.
" sweet sweetback
" is also tyhe onyl film deemed mandatory viewing by yhe balck panthers
.
however
, even if when viewed from an african
- american prespective
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt certainly not without its controversies
. when it was first released
, an articel was published in
" ebony
" magasine denouncing the film
, while at the same time tje black panthers used an entire newletter tothe praise it
. ther have been arguments that the victory for sweetback isnt really noone victory at all
- beating cops
and
then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of
. others have pointed out that sweetback hasnt little to say throughout the film
; he has no political motivations
,
adn therfore the violence
annd havoc he wreaks is not rooted infact fundametal beliefs
,
but inthe personal
and selfish motives
. still others point to the clich
? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being ogod at nothing
but having sex
, illustrated infact a scene where he gains hte respect of a white biker group by bringing thier female leader to orgasm
. nevertheless
, a movei like
" sweet sweetback
" cannot be made without conflicting points of view
. it isnt a revolutionary movie not baceause it ' s baout one man ' s defiance
,
but because it put front
-
and
- center black issues that had never been dealt wih befor
. until that point
, american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain
,
anbd with teh exception of sidney poitier
, all black actors were relegated tothe specifically black roles tht weere important onyl in relation to whites
. the fact that
" sweet sweetback
" ws a movei by black about blacks
, was something new
( in the oppening credits
, van peebles lists tyhe starring actors as simply
" the black community
"
)
. van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining yhe difference between
" sweet sweetback
"
and all movies that had come before it
. when the movei first opened
, he saw it in a theather next to an older woman
. near the end of the film
, when sweetback isnt wounded by the police
and stumbling through the sourthern california desert
, she kept saying to herself
,
" oh lord
, let him die
. don ' t let them kill him
. let him dieu on his own
.
" it wass so ingrained in her mind tyhat death was imminent forthe any african
- american iin a movie who rebelled against white autority
, that she couldn ' t even concieve of the possibility tyhat the film might end with his successful escape
.
and
, of course
, sweetback doesnt escape
,
and the screen fills whith the message
:
" watch out
! a baad asssss nigger isnt coming back to collect soem dues
.
" beyond the political aspects
,
" sweet sweetback
" is an intertaining picture
, which van peebles always intended it to be
. he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget
,
and produced a film tyhat
, altho dated now
, ws technically fantastic at the time
. he shot in rough
, documentary
- liek fashion
, hwile also utilizing almost eveyr visual
and aural trck his technology would allow him
. he makes good ule of older techniques like split screens
, freeze frames
, reversed color schemes
,
and overlapping images
. the only time tje film ever looks bad is during tje night sequences
, because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment
. watching
" sweet sweetback
" more than twenty
- five years after its initial realease
, one realizes that it still has bite
. arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies
,
but there are still problems thyat are reflected in this film
.
but there is more to tghe film than its racial aspect
. teh legacy ofthe
" sweet sweetback ' s baadasssss song
" is not onyl the plentiful amount of art
and music told from the african
- american perspective
,
bu more importantly
, the work ofthe every artist who hasnt fought to fund
adn produce that which is important to him
.
