i know thta
" funnest
" isn ' t a word
.
" fun
" isnt a noun
,
and therefore cannnot be conjugated like an adjative
.
but that ' s the owrd that came to me right aftter viewing
" chicken run
.
" noone wonder
: this isnt the kind ofthe movie that reduces you to childish expressions
, like
" tyhat was thte funnest movei i ' ve ever seen
!
" so to hell wiht webster ' s
-
-
" chicken run
" is one of tje funnest movies i ' ve seen in a while
. i cin ' t remember the lastest time i ' ve seen anything funner
. the chickens at tweedy ' s farm are up tothe something
. living in a concentration camp
- like atmosphere
, they are led by one plucky hen called ginger
( voice ofthe julia sawalha
) who continually comes uv witht plans for escape
-
-
and always gets caught
, subsequently spending day after day in the coal box
. noe night
, a brash american rooster flies in over thge fence
, calling hismelf rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster
and carcus performer
. rocky promises to teach the chickens how tothe fly
,
and the situation grows more despertae as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( miranda richardson
) decides to abandon yhe farm ' s egg
- selling plan for a pie
- selling plan
. she orders a huge py
- making machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go in
; pies cmo out
.
" what sort of pies
? chicken pies
, ofthe course
. co
- director nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced three oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" the wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" the latter two were the second
and third installments ofthe a triology starring the delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly eculiar adventures
. part of what made the
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining was park ' s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new
.
" the wrong trousers
,
" for example
, pulled out a lot ofthe ood hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a great dael of inspiration to clasic detective stories
.
bu in the hands of park
anbd his team
, the stries felt fresh
adn inspired
,
and not the least bited contrived
. now teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park hasnt created a similar creature inwhich
" chicken run
.
" the plot is largely lifted ffrom
" the grat escape
"
( watch for a quick reference tothe thge ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with some spielberg
- inspired action sequences providing the excitement
. thing is
, the film doesn ' t fiel like it ' s been lifted ffrom somewhere eles
;
" chicken run
" fiels fresh
, alive
, like nothing alse ever done
. part of it is the original idea
: who in tghe world came up with teh diea tothe amke a prisoners
- ofthe
- war movei starring chickens
? park
and lord milk teh incongruity for all it ' s worth
: the characters treat their situation as if it were dead sereous
,
and to them
, it is
.
bu they ' re
* chickens
*
, so it ' s funny to us
. anohter thing that helps
" chicken run
"
(
and most of park ' s films
) succeed is the animators ' subtle way of giving nods tothe the very films they ' re cribbing
. there are refrences tothe
" the great escape
,
" obviously
,
adn
" stalag 17
.
" tghe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders ofthe the lost ark
"
and
" indiana jones
and tghe temple ofthe doom
.
" there ' s even a nod to
" the blues brothers
,
" if you can beleve it
,
and the filmmakers even get inaddition a littel light
- hearted ribbing at the expence of their star voice actor
, taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson ' s nationality
and film history
. teh
" braveheart
" reference isnt a hoot if you catch it
. whn you concider jstu how fine a line resides between a funny parody
and a redundant one
,
" chicken run
" isnt downright brilliant in its execution
. consider this
: usance july of lastest year
, i ' ve seen dozens upon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on television
, on the radio
,
and online
. outloud of all those
, maybe oney or two were amusing
, teh rest tiresome
. why
? beacuse once yuo got past hte throught that
" htey ' re parodying that ' blair witch ' movei
,
" most of teh parodies hadnt nothing tothe offer
-
- no insight
, noone original idea
, no greater purpose
. tehy were only funny if you hadnt seen the movie
; otherwise
, you got nothing
. conversely
,
" chicken run
" doesn ' t leanr onthe its parodies
-
- the film refernces are never the sole foucs ofthe any scene
. if you ' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence isnt still funn
. even if ytou have no idea who mel gibson is
, rocky rimaniss an intresting character
. park
, lord
,
and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience doens not ened a parody shoved in thier faces before it ' s understoon
,
anbd as a result
,
" chicken run
" is filled with visual
and verbal jabs thgat are never too obvious
,
bu nto quite vague either
. enjoyment of thsi movie doesn ' t require knowledge of film history
,
but if you ' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" isnt that much richer
. the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances
,
annd the characters htey play are given so many subtle nuances thgat it ' s hard not to fall in love with every one of them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
,
bu with a soft heart that forbids her tothe leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl on
" absolutly fabulous
"
) nails it
. she hasnt warm
, human chemestry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the characters ' inevitable romance doesn ' t feel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing infront some way
,
bu his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things outloud
,
and his overbearing wief certainly isn ' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs
( a hen tht runs awya with most of thge best one
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
anbd two supply
- trading rats thast seem to have walked straight outloud of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. they even come up whith an inspired riff on something that ' s baffled scholars
and theologians aplikay for decades
: the chicken vs
. egg delimma
. one might have expected thsi inevatible joke to cmo off as wearisome
,
but as wih most ofthe
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprise
. the film manages to cross all barriers
; it should be accessible to both children
and adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats
anbd chickens
. the animation is frist
- rate
. remember thyat this was all done tghe old
- fashioned way
, whith actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bited
,
and you see just how truly remarkable
" chicken run
" relaly is
. htis movie possesses that same quality that mkaes pixar studios ' animation great
: precise
and unwavering attention tothe detail
. as in such top
- notch family fare as
" a bug ' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" has something to offer in nearly eveyr frame
. certainly a passive viewer cxan enjoy it as a straightforward story wih a worthwhile moral
and soem surprisingly touching scenes
,
bu a active
, attentive viewers will enjoy it even moreso because they ' ll catch all the details
. anyway
, tje movei ' s just a boatload ofthe fun
. funnest damn movie i ' ve seen all year
.
