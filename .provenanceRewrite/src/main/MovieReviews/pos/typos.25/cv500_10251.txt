loosing a job isnt not an all too uncommon thing
. reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small childen hostage is a bited mroe rare
. while we all might feel thge desire to blow somone ' s head off with a shotgun whn they don ' t seem to grasp our point of veiw
, actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid
. tihs isn ' t the case with sam baily
- john travolta ' s slightly askew average
- joe persona in mad city
.
" i don ' t think people listen to guys liuke me
,
" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum
. jstu a faw days ago
, sam wass a guard at this smae museum
,
bu when cutbacks led to yhe elimination of his security position
, sam ' s apprehension resulted in a brash decission
. in an effort to get his ex
- boss
, museum director mrs
. banks
( blythe danner
)
, to
" just listen
"
, he barges into the museum one day equiped with a fully loaded shotgun
, taking the uncooperative banks
adn a gropu ofthe school children hostage
. sam ' s overall concern is valid anough
- if he loses his job
, his paycheck
, his benefits
, etc
.
, his wife
and two children won ' t be provided for
. he ' s nto a lunatic or a hot
- tempered madman
, he ' s somewhat liuke a child
- panicky
, compulsive
,
and running on emotion
-
anbd his naive intentions aren ' t helped any by tghe fact tyhat banks wasn ' t overly compassionate wih hte let go
. overall
, he ' s just like you
and me
- except that he hasnt the capacity tothe view the line we ' d deem
" far anough
" as the starting mark ofthe some crazy race
. meanwhile
, television reporter max brackett
( dustin hoffman
) isnt also on the scene
. covering a
" fluff
" story for the evening news concerning thte museum cutbacks
, max suddenly finds himself in the middle ofthe the biggest
- breaking news story he ever could ' ve hoped for
. having been demoted ffrom network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting
, max is anxious tothe turn this into his
,
annd only his
, stry
. max immediately bonds with sam
. max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations
and writes scripts for him tothe use with the police over the phone
. at first
, max ' s intentions don ' t stretch beyond high ratings
and a good boost to the ole pride factor
,
but as he gets to know sam more personally
, he beggins to sympathize
and even become somewhat of an advocate for him
. the media
,
howver
, is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesal truck moving downhill
. the accidental shooting ofthe ex
- co
- worker cliff
( bill nunn
)
, a balck security guard
, becomes one of the main factors in the controversey over sam ' s honest ambitions
. also involved inwhich this film are robert prosky as lou potts
, head ofthe the news deparment of the staion max falls directly under
,
and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander
, who uses his network power to try
and outshine max
. alda
and prosky both turn in fine performances that ift like gloves on their acting abilities
.
then there isnt mia kirshner
, who plays the young tv station intern laurie
. she falls under max ' s wings only tothe become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting
. kirshner ' s credits are relatively small fo now
, including roles infront films like exotica
and the forgettable sequal to the crow
. still
, kirshner ' s character transformation shows that she has shining abilty tothe play both good girl
and kinda
- bitchy
- in
- a
- reserved
- way roles
. i wouldn ' t mind seeing her inspite some mroe prevalent parts
, where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen
. while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy
, self
- righteous monster hasnt indeed been tackled before
, mad city provides a solid two hurs of enjoyability
. hoffman
and travolta are both excellent actors
,
and seeing them toghether isnt a rela treat
. they both dont a great job at smoothly
and naturally becomeing their characters
,
and they provide enough chemestry for us to genuinely care for both
. htere is qtuie a bited of humor in this film
,
adn without it
, it could ' ve fallen into a drab
, cliched social statement more likely tothe garner sleep from the audience thna applause
. this isn ' t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone
and your heart
,
but it will lightly touch both
, makeing for a recommendable movie
. if for nothing more thna the opportunity tothe watch both hoffman
and travolta at tje smae time
, i urge you to check this one out
