maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it ' s nto handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the mounth
, because it very well sould have beeen a manipulative tearjerker
, broadcasted on abc on a monday ngiht
, starring kelly martin
and yasmeen bleeth
, respectively
. because it ' s not handled liuke the greatest stor ever told is precisely why it ' s so great
. underneath the to
- die
- for cinematography
, the brilliant acting
,
and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty
, not sure whther or nto this sotry is totally great
but with the balls to run with it
, tell it inwhich a certian original way
. it doesn ' t merely go fomr plot point tothe plot point
. it goes ffrom character to character
. it obsesses itself with the depth
adn the stlye of it all
,
annd makes the story of a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms
and dies prematurely into the sotry of two sisters
, both musicians
, who have a totally unique relationship
. it ' s that their relatiopnship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball
, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it coudl have had
and makes htis
, unlike
" patch adams
,
" effortlessly emotional
and real
. in short
, this movei is just awesome
. it merely tells its story really well
,
and that ' s something that just has tothe be commended these days
, when most stories are botched because they ' re not told by great storytellers
. director anand tucker tells this story well
. he overdramaticizes everything
,
but still keeps it real
. the film tells yhe stoyr of hilary
and jacqueline du pr
?
( rachel griffiths
and emily watson
, respectively
)
, twpo sisters who are frist seen infact childhood
( played by auriol evans
and keely flanders
, respectivly
) as the vyer best ofthe firends
. they are also both muscicians
, hilary a flutist
and jackie a cellist
,
and when it all begins
, both are considered child prodigies
,
bu hilary is seen as hte better ofthe the two
. jackie
, a bited jealous
, works
and works at her playing skills
,
anbd soon thte tables are turned
. when they both hit adulthood
, hilary strives fo a comback
, hwile her sister is playing in famous halls around the world
,
bu instead ofthe fame
, captures the heart of a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, inaddition a semi
- star
- making turn
)
. they marry
, after a short courtship
,
adn move to a lovley ocuntry hous
, makeing jackie incredibly jealous since her chello palying becomes a symbol ofthe her current life
: wehn she plays
, she has the eyes ofthe yhe world
,
bu when she stops
, she ' s alone
. she enters inot a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, in hopes that she may overcloud her sister
,
but she eventually beigns to loose it
,
and runs away to hilary ' s country home
, where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband
, since no one she sleeps witht gives her any pleasure
. it ' s all terribly melodramtic
, as you can see
,
and by the tyme jackie has contracted ms
( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in teh semi
- smiliar
" shine
" in technical
and emotional devastation
)
, it would have been tyhe time that i coudl easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn ' t been handeled in such a way
. the key thing here is that it ' s nto about her gradual death
anbd slip into insanity
but rather that it ' s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister
, which
, i might add
, is perfectly realized
. thier relatiopnship isnt the most down
- to
- earth complex entity of yhe yera
: they love eachother mroe than anyone else in the entire world
,
but they ' re also completely jealous of one another
. when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilties
, she trys in vain to make a comeback
but can ' t
,
and allmost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success
. when jackie lands on top
and sees her sister marry a wonderful man
, she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks tht i ' ve ever seen infront a film
( onyl two sisters who truely love eachother would dare share the same man
)
.
and the whole time
, their loev for eachother isnt never doubted or even tested
. another thing i really liked is emily watson ' s performance
. i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actr fo playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone whith a mortal disease
( or any combination of the threee
)
. my reasoning for thsi is that it ' s a fucking easy job
. the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in
" beloved
"
: sure
, she ' s good
,
but what ' s so tough baout playing a woman who stumbles around
, slurs her words toghether
,
and acts like a three year old inside a 20
- year ood ' s body
? hell
, i sould play that if i had a pair of breasts
. infact that smae exact movie
,
though
, is a peformance by kimberly elise where she has to be tghe rock that holds the family together as her mother slowy goes insane
, her brothers run off never to be seen again
,
and her mother ' s lover is scared off
. she has to actually dael whith real emotions
, something much harder than mere stumbling about
.
but the academy of arts
and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons
. if you don ' t believe me
, look at jack nicholson ' s performance inthe
" as good as it gets
"
: great performance
,
bu eazy job
. this isn ' t so for watson
,
though
, becouse her insanity comes from real emotions
, not just a plot point
.
and thanks to tje opening sequence
, where we see her
and hilary as kids
, we understand hte motives behind all her actions
,
and by thge timne she actually contracts ms
and begins to loose her sanity
and her life
, we ' ve already understood thyat this is the lsat straw forthe a woman plagued with terrible neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who would ahev otherwise been the understudy tothe watson ' s protagonist
, actually matchs watson step
- forthe
- step
, because as watson grows insane
,
adn demands unspeakable things from her
, griffiths holds her pwn
,
anbd has to deel witht what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unknown actress
(
and watson being famous from
" breaking the waves
"
annd
" tjhe boxer
"
)
, is absolutely brilliant
, just as absolutely brilliant as watson is
,
adn if the academy
and all the other critics groups
, who ' ve aready deemed watson ' s performance the best of the year
, glance over hers because she ' s teh one who doesn ' t git tothe go insane
( read
: she gets the boring role
)
,
then the scream ofthe hysteria ytou hear will be from me
. after all
, griffiths has hte thankless job of keeping things real
- tghe tom cruise role in
" rainman
"
( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration
adn not hoffman
)
. she does
,
and if anyone deserves accolades from hte academy this year
, it ' s griffiths
. together
, hte twpo actresses work extremely well
,
though
,
and both have to go through deepo emotional hell
, the likes of which haven ' t been seen this year
. if it hadn ' t been for an otherwise nto
- totally
- graet final section that deals way too much with jackie
and not enough wiht hilary
( whn the two hadnt gotten equal treatment for teh entirety
)
, i ' d say this is one of the top ten best films of the year
. it ' s so close to perfection
, in its sturcture
, its treatment of its subject
,
and its beautiful technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, without a shred of doubt in my mind
,
and maybe film editing
)
, that it ' s nearly a shame thyat it ' s not the flawess gem that it shouldnt be
.
but
, hey
, as it isnt
, i can hardly complain
.
