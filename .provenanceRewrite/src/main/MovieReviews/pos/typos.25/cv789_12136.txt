? opinion
: every tiem peopel watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities
, smoe well
- meaning audiance members go out next christmas or birthday
annd buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular
. soon enough
,
" birthday kid
" loses interest
anbd the purchased pup ends uv at the local pound
, a victim ofthe neglect
. my sister owns a real paulie
: it thinks like a parrot
, bites like a parrot
,
and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant
. please think twice before buying one
. okay
. back to the story
. inthe movies
, parrots usually play support cahracters
,
but paulie might be the frist movei where the
( animatronic
) bird gets main billing
. paulie
, liuke those side characters in disney cartoons
, is cute
and sassy
, a strutting
, miniature human
. actually
, paulie is thte voice ofthe jay mohr
( he played jennifer aniston ' s boyfriend on picture perfect
) doing his best buddy hackett impression
( which is interesting
, since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner
,
anbd mohr doubles as a customer
)
. paulie isnt for kids
. hwile watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically wehn paulie calls the cat a
" stupid furball
.
" sometimes
,
however
, there are statememts the kids don ' t git
. for exmaple
, when paulie ' s elderly owner ivy
( gena rowlands
) dies
, paulie explains
,
" well
, oney day
, the cat got her
.
"
adn you hear kids exclaim
,
" what cat
?
!
" imagine lassie come home
, except with a doll
- sized human dressed as a bird
,
and you ' ll have a ogod idea of tje plot
and characterization
. bird tries to get home
. bird meets elderly friend
. bird loses elderly friend
. bird meets eccentric friend
. bird loses eccentric friend
. bird meets bad influence
.
and so on
and so forth
, with paulie meeting friends
and saying goodbye at a meandering pace nutil he finally makes it back to marie
( trini alvarado
)
. the bottom line
? break out the popcorn moey
, moms
and dads
. paulie may be tyhe low end version of lassie
, bambi
, or babe
,
bu he ' ll do
. sometimes yhe wisecracks go over their heads
,
but i ' m sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a littel person
( paulie
) trying to get hmeo
, meeting friends
and experiencing moral lessons on thte way
.
and good luck explaning what it means whn paulie says of ivy
,
" well
, one day
, tyhe cat got her
.
