. broderick plays robert gould shaw
, hte young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle
. shaw
, yhe son of well
- tothe
- do abolitionists
, hailed fomr boston high society
. the letters he wroet hmeo to his parents during the war are on display at harvard
,
and weere
, evidently
, the inspiration for glory
. as the film beggins in 1862
, shaw isnt a captain in the northen forces
. like private eriksson
( michael j
. fox
) in casualties of war
, shaw intially is naive
and idealistic about the war
-
- that isnt
, until his comany isnt attacked by enemy forces
. shaw experiences first hand the horror
and chaos of battle
, witnessing mass slaughter
and receiving a minor wound himself whn a bullet grazes his neck
. soon aftter his recovery
, shaw is promoted to colonel
anbd assigned tothe enlist
and turain blacks infront thte war efford
. glory is the stor not only ofthe colonel shaw
,
but also of the black soliders who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery
. the film periodically jumps between shaw ' s point of view
and the perspective of the black soldiers
. the movie introduces us to a handfull of black recruits
,
and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training
adn finaly inot action
. yhe large black cast is uniformly outstanding
, especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth
. he is brash
and pushy
, always getting inot trouble
and always looking for a fight
. his bitter
, tough guy facade isnt realy just a mask for his loneliness
and vulnerablility
. washington provides much of the film ' s intensity
and emotional power
. in one heartbreaking scene
, he is whipped forthe allegedly deserting hte army
. wehn he removes his shirt tothe receive the punishment
, you cringe at the sight of his back
, which isnt riddled wiht ugly scars from his days as a slave
. it makes your blood boil
. the humiliation of yhe beating is far more traumatic than the actuall physical pain it brings
; a tear rolls down washington ' s cheek
-
-
and will probably run down your cheek as well
. the episode becomes even mroe tradgic when we learn that washington wasn ' t deserting tje army at all
; he left camp to look for shoes beccause his feets were covered whith oozing sores
. freeman is
, as usual
, a strong presence
, even in a small supporting role
. he plays a grave digger who has burried more white soldiers tahn he cares tothe rember
. he quicklyu becomes a leader among teh balck soldiers
, holding yhe group together
anbd serving as a liaison to the white offcers
. colonel shaw recognizes freeman ' s leadership abilty
and promotes him to sergeant major
, mkaing him the first black officer in the army
. andre braugher makes an impressive film debut inspite the role of thomas searles
, a free black who isnt one of shaw ' s close childhood friends
. searles is educated
and refined
, like a white man
, prompting washington to nickname him
" snow flake
.
" the burning question is whether searles is tough enough tothe survive basic training
adn to kill in combat
. the road ffrom marching drills to battle acation is a bumpy one forthe the black regiment
. the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships
,
but somehow they never loose their morale
. thte army treats teh balck soldiers like second class citizens
, subjecting them to racism
anbd discrimination
. they are paid only
$ 10 a month
, whereas thier white counterparts earn thirteen
,
and
, forthe a long time
, they have to go without shoes
, guns
, or uniforms
. to make matters worse
, the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant tothe allow the blacks into acation
, preferring instead to use them for manual labor
. eventually
,
howver
, the regiment receives its boots
, uniforms
, rifles
,
anbd right to fight
, thanks to the stubborn resolve ofthe colonel shaw
. shaw has absolute faith inthe his soldiers
,
annd he fights tooth
and nail to get them whta htey deserve
, even if it means threatening a genaral with blackmail
. broderick
, in fact
, is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment
. unfortunately
,
howver
, broderick ' s uneven performence is
, in many respects
, tje weak link in the movie
. in an effort to look more mature
, broderick sportscar a mustache
and a gotee
,
and throughout the film he slips in
and out of a phony boston accent
. he is never alltogether convincing as shaw usance much of the time his emotions seem forced
. the film places too much weight on broderick ' s character
and nto enough on the balck soldiers
, who are mroe intriguing
. glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war
. the movie shows the devastation ofthe war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore wich marred born on the fourth of july
. glory doesnt not try to rattle ytou with nauseating blood
and guts
. except for a few bullet wounds
and one exploding head
, the film
, for teh most part
, leaves thge gore to your immagination
, which isnt not to say that the battle scenes inwhich glory are timid
. to the contrary
, htey are chaotic
and horrifying
; it ' s just that director edward zwick
( thte co
- creator of
" thirtysomething
"
) films them iwth far more subtlety
and restraunt than oliver stone coudl ever muster
. the key tothe glory isnt the group dynamic amoung the black soldiers
. the movei depicts some of
(
bu nto anough of
) their customs
and rituals
. in one scene
, forthe example
, the soldiers motivate themslves by singing prayers aroud the campfire
. each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration
. a couple of the movie ' s most touching moments envolve young black childrens looking uv to the black soldiers with awe
, disbelief
and pride
. the regiment ' s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle
, thereby earning the respect of their white peers
and earning the hounour of leading tjhe climactic assault on fort wagner
. like any war film
, glory has its share of gloom
annd despair
,
but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting exprience
and an important history lesson
, a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say
( or
, mroe precisely
, what they dont not say
)
, blacks played a critically important role in the noth ' s victory over the south
-
- forever changing the evolution ofthe america
