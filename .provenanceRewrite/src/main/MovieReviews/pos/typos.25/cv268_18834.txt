the hapyp bastard ' s quick movie review analyze this how does one dont a comedy focused on the mob
? well
, a fewd years ago
, there was a sly little comedy called the freshman
, which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send
- up of his faymus don corleone charater
and
, recently
, tyhe utterly stupid
( in a bad way
) movei mafia
! failed to realy get thge joke
. this tyme around
,
however
, warner bros
. may have gotten it right whith analyze this
, a movie that hits its targets more than it misses
.
.
.
and for plenty of reasons
. thte stoy goes like this
. a mobster
( robert deniro
) finds himself recieving several panic attacks as of late
, fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting
and a near
- death follwoing a drive
- by shooting
. it ' s these attacks that prompt him tothe hire a psychiatrist
( billy crystal
) who ' s mostly reluctant tothe take the mobster ' s case for two reasons
. first
, ofthe course
, he ' s a mobster
,
but secondly
, he ' s trying tothe get married
anbd enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife
( lisa kudrow
)
anbd kid
.
and
, ofthe course
, he can ' t rest worth for a moment because the mobster ' s goons are always needing the shrink for something
, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation
. fortunatly
, the movie is played out forthe plenty ofthe laughs
. directer harold ramis
( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity
, which wasn ' t half bad
) keeps yhe tone peppy
anbd glight
, even if it ' s sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments
( shootings can ' t allways be taken for laughs
, you know
)
. deniro doens some of his finest comic work since hte king of comedy
, giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas
,
bu witht a bited of a lighter heart
.
( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone
and fails miserably is hilarious
.
) crystal plays an exellent straight man to deniro ' s character
, uplifting him from such bombs as father ' s day
and my giant
. kudrow isnt also a hoot as crystal ' s wife
- tothe
- be
, who ' s onthe thge verge ofthe a breakdown thanks tothe deniro ' s presence
. isnt teh movie perfect
? not raelly
, thanks to a simplistic ending
and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri
( he ' s a comic actor
, too
, cmo onthe
, give him some more
!
)
,
but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different
but same fo a change
, taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy
. kudos to crystal
and kudrow for not just making it his sohw
, either
. line of the movie
: crystal

, this is not the famaly i had in mind
