i don ' t know what movie the criticists saw
,
but it wasn ' t this one
. tyhe popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movei is unfunny
anbd dreadfully boring
. in my personal opinion
, htey couldn ' t be more wrong
. if you were expecting airplane
!
- like laughs
and agatha christie
- intense mystery
,
then yes
, this movie would be a dissappointment
.
however
, if you ' re jstu looking for an enjoyable movie
and a good time
, this is one to see
. honest
, it is
. this stopry is about a 4th network
, wbn
, taking to america ' s airwaves iin 1939
. penny henderson
( mary stuart masterson
)
, the staion owner ' s secretery
, must deal whith her overbearing boss
, an unimpressed sponsor
and writers ready to qutie on a moment ' s notice
, partly due to tjhe fact thta they haven ' t been paid in weeks
. amonst the mayhem
, she must also deel withthe her soon
- tothe
- be ex
- husband
, roger
( brian benben
) who desperately wants her bcak
. unfortunately
, her problems only git worse as the night goes on
and the body count rises without explanation
. while trying to woo penny back
, roger must deel wiht hte police
and try to fidn the killer thgat lurks at wbn
. mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny
( i ' m trying to be unbiased so i won ' t tell yuo how amazing she looked
)
,
although brian benben gets most of the screen tiome
. allong with the twpo leads
, are several recognizable faces
, including corbin bernsen
( l
. a
. law
)
, michael mckean
( laverne
& shirley
)
anbd bobcat goldthwait
. the special effects are amazing
,
and fooled me
( whlch some may argue isn ' t vrey difficult to do
) in many scenes
.
although the movie somtimes goes overboard with the physical comedy
, it more than makes up fo those mistakes throughout tghe movie
. overall
, i gavey it
, or an
, depending on what system yuo use
