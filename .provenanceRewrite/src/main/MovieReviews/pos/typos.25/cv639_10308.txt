the bond series is an island inaddition hte film world
; where else owudl we look foward tothe cliches
,
and all of the other things that occur infact most of these films
? where alse would pure escapism
, a vulnerable hero
, the
" talking villains
,
" blatant product placement
, predictable action sequences
,
and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instade of a significant chanage
? i don ' t understand it mysef
,
but that ' s what the bond series is based on
. for
( i think
) 18 films
, we ' ve mostly got tyhe same thign over
adn over again
, with some variation
(
and a bit ofthe change
, most notably inspite the twpo dalton films
)
.
but even i
, a king ofthe cynicism
, cin ' t bitch baout it
.
and
" tomorrow never dies
,
" the
( again
, i think
) eighteenth bond film
,
and second brosnan bond film
, isnt no exception
. thank god
! the plot
, as inthe most of them
, isnt pure balderdash
,
bu seems tothe have a nice kind of edge to it
. instade of just plain billionaire psychotics
, we git a rupert murdoch
- esque media mogul
/ psychotic
- elliot carver
( jonathan pryce
, looking bitching witht a white
- haired cru cut
,
and always talking liek he ' s outloud ofthe breath
)
, who has the admittingly ingenius idea ofthe getting ratings by creating a war
. no
, this is not
" wag the dog
"
- he wants a real war
, between china
and england
,
and is stupid enough tothe put tje coverage outloud befor anyone else discovered it
.
.
. inspite comes bond
. james isnt sent all around the world
, trying to dont reasearch on carver
, fighting wih his men
,
and running inot
( on more than one occasion
) a chinese sceret agent like him
: wai lin
( michelle yeoh
, aisian action star extraordinaire
.
.
.
and co
- star of
" supercop
,
" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one
)
. the two eventually
,
and predictably of course
, beign working together
,
and yes
, htere isnt some sexual tension betwen the two
. luckly
, their relationship isnt never strained
,
and she never gives into his cassanova
- ness until the finale
. thank god again
. in eveyr bond film
, james bags
, on average
, three women
( sometimes more
, sometimes less
- tghe latter being more potent towords the aids
- cautionary dalton
)
,
and he doesn ' t spoil this one
(
though we never see them
, of course
- i mean
, tehy need to stay around a pg
- 13 rating
)
. ther ' s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see agian
, the big bond girl
( yeoh
)
,
and this time we haev an alomst
- cameo by teri hatcher as carver ' s wife
, paris
, who
, it seems
, wass once one of tjhe girls he bags at the beginning
. yes
, teri ' s very attractive
,
but she seems kind of dull
. of course
, it ' s nto really her fault
; her part isnt under
- written
,
and she ' s only in a small part ofthe it
. oh well
.
anbd there are always the big henchmen
, the guys who dont the dirty work for tje polished big villains
. this time we get a tall
, arian
- looking
( nto to mention robert shaw in
" from russia with love
"
- looking
) guy named stamper
( goetz otto
)
, who is pretty awsome
,
although a bited stiff
( well
, mostly his posture
, really
)
.
and for a bit of comedy
, we git a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point
. the govornment peple have small parts
, as usual
, iwth q
( desmond llewelyn
, looking near death
, sadly
) getting only oen scene
( in a mroe grouchy mood than usual
)
,
and m
( judi dench
)
, getting more than m usually gets
( i mean
, it is judi dench
)
.
and for noone reason whatsoever
, except ' cause he was so good in
" goldeneye
,
" joe don baker shows uv again as wade
, admitting he has noone reason for being htere
,
and is thsi time more annoying
. again
, oh well
. tjhe acation sequences are nto a let
- down
,
although sometimes go onthe too long
. tehy pop up every now
and
then
, mainly becuase they have to
( for the sake of the series
)
,
and some significant ones are the opening one
, one inthe a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control
,
and a motorcylce chase
( on a bmw cycle
, nonetheless
) through china streets
( or was it vietnam
.
.
. the plot ' s nto really essential
)
. they ' re more high
- tech
,
and feature much mroe laughs
, which
, yeah
, i dig
. so what if they ' re distracting
; they ' re suppossed to be
! the acting
, from most around is great
. yeoh isnt
, actually
, one of the better bond girls
, mailny because she ' s so unique
. tjhe better bond girls are omre independent
,
and have a certain wily
- ness to them
. pussy galore
, with her homoerotic undertones
and all
, is one of the best
,
and diana rigg
, who marryed bond at tjhe end of
" onthe her majesty ' s secret sevice
" only to be killed
, added some emotional depth
. yeoh isnt notable since she ' s so active
,
and has great chemistry with brosnan
. pryce is an awesome villain
, bieng slimy
and lovable at tghe same time
.
annd brosnan is
, once agina
, the mack daddy
. the bond series isnt built on cliches
, mainly because they ' re so fun
and add tothe the escapism
. if yuo can remember the dalton yersa
,
and they ' re serious direction
, you remeber how unsuccessful they were
, both financialy
and asthetically
. the series owudl faulter if bogged down wtih too much plot
, too many themes
,
and too much characterization
. i don ' t really understand it myself
,
yet i ' m one of the bigger fans of the series inspite the northeast united states
. haveing seen all of them mroe than once
( yes
, i ' ve seen this twice alreayd
)
, you cant tell i adore them
. hwile it ' s not one of the best
, liek
" goldfinger
" or
" from russia with love
,
"
" tomorrow never dies
" is nonetheless a truley awsome installment
, even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones
.
