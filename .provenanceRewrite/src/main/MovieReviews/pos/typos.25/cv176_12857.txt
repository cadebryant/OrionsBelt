a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
! i didn ' t raelly expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family
. the movie bombed at the box office
,
and i had never realyl liekd the saturday night live sketch onthe whitch the movie wass based
. my rela consern
,
though
, was thge general reputation ofthe snl
- related movies translating tothe the big screen with less
- than
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i wass surprised tothe discover a truly entertaining
, often hillarious
yet also touching little film
. it is an al franken prodcution through
-
and
- through
, who nto onyl created the title charater
but also wroet
and starred iin the picture
. for those of you who don ' t know
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who has a really annoying show on a public
- access station about increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
allthough not a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley isnt
, as the program proudly boasts
,
" a graduate ofthe several 12
- step programs
.
" stuart isnt doing well enought with his tv show
,
bu he keeps getting distracted by family troubles
. stuart ' s relatives are a mess
: his dad
and brother
( harris yulin
and vincent d ' onofrio
, respectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister is overweight
and getting over another divorce
,
and his mom is in constant self
- denial
and solves all percepted problems by baking
.
then
, diaster strikes
. stuart accidentally insults the manager ofthe the station
and gets his show revoked
. he is forced tothe move back in withthe his famaly after he can no longer support himself
,
and ther the comedy truly picks up
. franken wrote all of the characters nto jsut as cliches or stereotypes
,
bu as sharply
- drawn
, rela people
.
although smalley ' s dad has always imbibed too much
, stuart can still recall times when his father seemed liuke an okay guy
. also
, after an accident towards thge end of thte movie
, both stuart
and the audience leran that ther is more to his mother than previously thought
.
although filled with small
, very funny scenes
, stuart saves his family also hasnt its share of dramtic moments
, especially towards the conclusion
. for a lightweight comedy
, it handles these scenes especially well
, often better tahn many so
- called
" serious dramas
" ofthe today
. all the omre amazing is that such a movie comes from a saterday night live sketch that is essentially a one
- joke bited
. if you feel like renting a comedy
,
and ytou haven ' t seen this film
, i definatly recommend ytou try this one out
. you ' ll laugh
.
.
. you ' ll cry
.
.
.
. it ' s all there
.
