up until about a year ago
, john travolta ' s career consisted of those
" look who ' s talking
" movies
( notice how they never called them look who ' s talented
)
and the 1991 bomb shout
( which was bad enough to amking most people scream
)
.
but somwhere allong the line
, travolta got the starring role in tyhe tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction
anbd his career soared once again
. ewird how someone whose career was onthe par with the bee gees bcak in 1978 would experience fame
annd fortune once agina
, while barry
, robin
and maurice gibb could dont no better thna a 1993 straight
- to
- thte
- cutout
- bin album aptly named
" size isn ' t everything
"
(
adn ofthe course
, htey learned that sales are everthing
)
.
but now travolta ' s back on the hollywood scene once again
,
annd i think we all know why
. four words
: contract withthe the devil
.
adn this hasnt nothing to do with newt gingrich ' s
" contract with america
.
" no
, satan is much more humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld
. how do i know
? i pwn tjhe doccument in question
. amazing what ytou cant buy at thsoe collector ' s shops for a fewd hundred dollars
, isn ' t it
? get shorty continues in tje veign ofthe pulp fiction
, with travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes tothe collect soem ofthe thge mafia ' s money from a b
- grade director
( gene hackman
)
and suddenly finds outloud he wnats out of the mob game
and into the movie game
. sure
, a ruthless criminal liek him is far too honest to amke it inwhich hollywood
,
but i guess that ' s beside the point
. palmer is determined to get hackman ' s next project made
, so he sets outloud tothe convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) to star in the movie
, bringing along down
-
and
- outloud horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who has already had affairs with hackman
and devito
. it doesn ' t take a las vegas odds
- maker to predict thyat she
and travolta will soon be hiting the sheets as well
, aftter the customary sexual tension
and denial
, which has been used inspite every comedy from
" who ' s the boss
?
" to speechless
. it works in this case
, unlike
" who ' s the boss
?
"
altough it ' s interesting to note taht tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also
. complicating matters somewhat are tje mobsters who have backed hackman ' s other films
and want in onthe this one too
, along with travolta ' s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting
. get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction
, dispite the obvious similarities
. this movie doesn ' t haev near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
bu it is definately one of the most entertaining movies i ' ve seen this eyar
( yes
, even better than hallween vi
)
. get shorty isnt my kind of movie
, one that mixes intelligent humor with action
and violence
. i ' m definitely going to hve to check out the novel it ws based on
. are you getting this
, shorty
?
