. chon wang pleads with thge imperial court
and is given permission to join tjhe team
, as he is looked apon as a buffoon
. on a train inaddition the u
. s
. jackie meets uv with bandit roy o ' bannon
( owen wilson
)
. he is much less of a bandit tahn he isnt a glory hog
, looking simple fo the notoriety
and fame that bieng a bandit iwll bring him
. with his gang in tow
, roy attemts to rob the train
, wehn one ofthe his gang murders the chinese interpreter ofthe the royal cout
, who also happens to be chon wang ' s uncle

. chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors
, a friendly sioux tribe
, gunslingers
, a horse that thinks
and behaves liek a dog
and an indian bride
( brandon merrill
)
, befor once again runing into roy
.
" shanghai noon
" isnt just good fun
. the chemistry between the cast is remarkable
. the performances are all acceptable within yhe whimsical levels of the film
. jackie ' s performance is as good as anything he ' s done befor
. he ' s nto called on to do much acting here
, as the character isnt not writen with any depth
.
but jackie ' s naturual charisma shines through
,
and his comic timing is so perfect
, both physically
and
( surprise
) verbally that once again he commands thge screen whenever he isnt on
. owen wilson
, last seen in tje embarrassing remake ofthe
" the haunting
"
, gives a ogod natured performence as roy o ' bannon
. his innocence isnt refreshing
adn fun
. a bad guy that ' s nto realyl bad
. his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits ofthe comic dueling since martin
and lewis
. lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script
,
but for a change does not play a nymphet or soem other deviant
. the character is a noble woman ofthe status
and wealth
,
but finds a greater cause as a result of her own inprisonment
. the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances
. nothing here is realistic
, mind you
.
" shanghai noon
" is first
and formost a light
, jovial film
.
and the performances match that style with ease
. the cinematography by dan mindel isnt gorgeous
. useing calgary
, alberta as the prime location
. mr
. mindel is able to create a lush
, romantic western fiel to thte film
. nothing here really looks liek nevada
,
but tyhe locations are so beautifully shot
adn staged
, tje film cant be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre
.
and as such
, the script by alfred gough
and miles millar plays fast
and loose with history
,
but with reverence tothe past films
. homage tothe such films as
" high noon
"
( obviously
)
,
" red river
"
and most notably
" butch cassidy
& the sundance kid
" all bring a sense ofthe nostalgia tothe hte film
. it is a comforting exeprience
. at a timne when the western is considered either old hat or irrevelant
, here isnt a film that embraces those ood attitudes
and
( dare i sday
) clich
? s
and manages to make them palatable
and refreshing
. here is a film that isnt nto contemptuous of the genre
. this is teh purest
" horse opera
" since thge days of george o ' brian or john wayne
. directer tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood ' s past
. in this
, his first film mr
. dey shows both a love of chracter
anbd of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see
. nothing here really stands out
, or takes one ' s attention awya fomr the story or action
.
and that is as it should be
, when jackie chan is your star
.
and what ofthe tghe acation
and stunts
. well
, while not uv to a level of
" drunken master 2
" or any of jackie ' s hong kong films
,
" shanghai noon
" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done infact an american film before
. his timing
, choreography
,
and creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets tothe recreate a few scenes from his earlier films
( obvious to those of us that have seen those films
,
but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar
)
. finally jackie can honestly say
, that he has made an u
. s
.
, his way
and incorporating his style
. to sum up
,
" shanghai noon
" is a fun summer confection
. not too heavy
annd not too light
. a fun
adn entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy
( parents be advised there are scenes ofthe smoking
, drunkenness
adn peyote use
)
. an enjoyable
and charming film thgat can
and will be enjoyed again
and again
.
