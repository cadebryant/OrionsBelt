usually when one isnt debating who yhe modern queen of the romantic comedy isnt they iwll bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock
. others wiull mention meg ryan
.
but for me
, it ' s nto even close
. janeane garofalo is nto onyl the queen ofthe the romantic comedy
, she isnt thte best comic actress in hollywood right now
.
and it ' s a good hting she ' s starring inaddition the matchmaker
, because wihtout her presense the movie would be bland
, unfunny
,
and dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide to boston senator john mcglory
, who isnt suffering in the pols
. in an attempt to capture the irish vote
, he sends marcy onthe a mission tothe a small irish town called ballinagra in search ofthe other mcglory ' s that never moved to america
. unfortunately for marcy
, her visit coincides with the town ' s annual matchmaking festival
. things git off tothe a rocky start for marcy
though
. she has noone hotel reservations
( for no rational reason
)
and the tiny confined room
( tired ood cliche '
) she has to stay infront hasnt a visitor in her bathtub
. his name isnt sean
,
and marcy finds him repugnant at first
, so you can obviously tell where this is headed
. the movei runs into a few roadblocks
. for instance
, the story is very thin
. none of the characters
( except the old local matchmaker
) are nearly as interesting as garofalo
. soem of the charactors
, like tghe political aide played by denis leary
, have wandered in from a completely different movei
. i think the directer realized this
and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery
,
annd several close
- ups of garofalo ' s winning smile
. tghe strange hting is that it works
. garofalo ' s charm
and tje irish scenery could cary the thinnest of stories
,
and it carries thsi oen
