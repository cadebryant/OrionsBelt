hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death
( noone pun intended
- honest
)
. it ' s a shame
, too
, because the good count wass probably the most frightening out the old b
- movie monsters
. i mean
, come onthe
. are people realyl going to get that scared over a big gren guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed ofthe five miles per hour
? hell no
.
and not only was the idae of a vampire frightening as hell
,
but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well
, not commongly associated with horror films
.
and not only has tjhe idea been done too many times
,
bu with the possible exception of from dusk ' till dawn
, has not been done veyr well lately
, either
. thsi isnt precisely why it was so much funn for me watching the original nosferatu
. i got to go back to the times when makeing movies
( even horror movies
) was concidered an art form
,
and not just done tothe amking cash like nowdays
.
annd that is exactly whta this film is
; art
. i ' ve been a horror fan usance i was eight yeras old
,
and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover thge intelectual ground that this film covers
. let me backtrack a minute
. when i say
" intellectual ground
"
, i don ' t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that
, i just mean that in order for thge film to work teh way it ws intended tothe
, a little bit of thingking is involved
. with most modern slasher movies like friday tje 13th
anbd what
- not
, you cxan just simply sit bcak in your chair
and be frightened by the gore that is shown
. those movies could have been made by a fifth grader wiht a good makeup kit
; movies liek thsi require the viewer tothe acutally pay attention
and ponder whta isnt happening onthe the screen
. you see
, this movei has bearly any violence in it
and even less blood or gore
. tihs is a thinking man ' s slasher flick
. the
" nosferatu
" ofthe the title is orlock
( max shreck
)
, a stange
, hermit
- like count that
, as the film opens
, isnt looking fo a new home to buy
. he imploys hte help of hutter
( gustav von wangenhein
)
, a real estate salesman
( or something to that effect
) who has a nice home
and even a fiancee named ellen
( greta schroeder
)
. upon orders from his boss
, hutter treks tothe thge transylvanian mountains tothe ivsit orlock ' s castle
anbd speak tothe him baout his new home
( wich just happens to be right next door to hutter ' s
)
. the enxt morning
, he wakes up to find teeth markes on his neck
.
.
. nto really a good sign
. he
hten discovers through smoe reading that the count is a
" nosferatu
"
, or vampire
, oney of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans
.
bu by the tiome he pieces thsi together
, he is too late
; orlock hasnt aleady embarked to hutter ' s hometown via boat
. will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock
? the charachter of orlock isnt
, of course
, dracula
. tjhe only onyl reason his name was changed was because this was an unathorised account ofthe bram strocker ' s novel
. just thought that was an intresting little side note
.
.
. probably the only way you will get tothe see this fine film isnt by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment ' s digitally restored cut
, nowe availaible in stores
.
however
, this version is quite different than maunau ' s original masterpiece
. the movie is nowe sporting a new soundtrack by band type o
- negative
and color tinting
, much like tjhe 1984 verison of lang ' s metropolis
. now
, i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying tothe do here
, bringing a classic like this tothe the attention of a wider audeince tht might have otherwise just skipped this one
.
but alas
, i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen
.
but that ' s just my bag
; ytou may like the newer
, moreso
" modern
" version better
. either way
, i suggest investing your money inthe a copy
. if you like whta they hvae done with it
, pop it in the vcr
and enjoy
. if you ' re like me
, jstu do what i ' ll do during future viewings
; turn the color all the way down onthe your television
, hitted mute
, turn on some bach or mozart or whatever
, dim the lighst
and prepare to view what is truly one ofthe the greatest films ever made
.
