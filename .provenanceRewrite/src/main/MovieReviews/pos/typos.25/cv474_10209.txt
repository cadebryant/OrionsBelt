let ' s face it
: the
$ 100 milion
- plus smash that was
" goldeneye
" was not a ogod film by any means
,
and as a bond movie was only marginally better than
, say
,
" a view to a kill
" or either ofthe the timothy dalton pictures
, by virtue of nice pacing
.
but it did revive the series
,
and granted thge producers some newyorker directions in which tothe take tje it
( ie
. thte new
" m
" is a woman
)
.
" tomorrow never dies
" is the picture
" goldeneye
" should have been
; it ' s also the most entertaining bond outing usance
" tghe spy who loved me
"
. the new picture opens wtih china considering war with britain after a standard millitary operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine
. as an attack occurs
, yhe front
- page headline is already bieng prepared

. carver
( pryce
) the man is a deluded magnate
, a sort of hybrid of ted turner
, bill gates
,
and peter sellars ' german scientist from
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physically
, pryce even recalls sellars infact his kubrick days
)
. it ' s up to james bond to take him down
, with assistance
, of course
, from a wealth of gadgets
( including a multi
- purpose cell phone
)
,
and beautifull womens
. enter michelle yeoh
, fresh ffrom
" supercop
"
, as a chineese secret agent wiht her own agenda
; with effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seemingly withthe the ease of preparing pasta
,
and refuses hte advances of our philandering hero
. htey mkae a great team
.
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt a surprisingly entertaining
and efficient film
, given that at the helm is none other than the directer ofthe
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces
, each much moreso intricate
and impressive than
, for instance
, tje tank scene in
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan has at lastest settled into teh role some efel he was born to play
; last time out
, the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders
,
and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language
. returned in brosnan ' s eyes has smoe of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv ' s
" remington steele
"
, as has his deadpan wit
.
and
though carver ' s motives are muddy
( when carver explains that
" genius is insanity with some success
"
, screenwrighter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makes an agreeable
, memorable villain
. in the future
, they should persue actors as talented
annd experienced as pryce to breathe life inot these cardboard figures
. there a few too many explosions inthe
" tommorow never dies
"
, perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue
.
annd it could have utilisied a sharper script
,
though i was ammused by the double entendres
, none ofthe which i will reveal here
. as it stands
, the plot suffers many holes
( i ' m not tkaing baout implausibilities
)
,
and the dialogue tends towords tyhe hackneyed
. now that thte elements are in place
: modern speshal effects
and stunt work
, cool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it ' s time to put them tothe uise inwhich something truly speshal
. there ' s noone mistaking
,
however
, that
" tomorrow never dies
" isnt ideal holiday escapism
,
and forthe the first tyme inthe perhasp years
, you ' ll walk out wanting more bond movies
