, silky smooth
and irish liek a pint ofthe guinness
. a lackadaisical
, naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts
adn gambols
. an acerbic
, sing
- song metered voice taht evokes the startling imagery
and language of anthony burgess '
" a clockwork orange
.
" a voice thast deliciously conjures scenes both porcine
and puerile
, like those out ofthe
" delicatessen
,
" or
" the tin drum
.
" imagin all of that
,
anbd you ' ll get a good sence ofthe what you can expect from
" tghe butcher boy
.
" imagin thyat
and more
. neil jordan ' s latest film
" stars
" rea in more ways than one
. rea
, the accomplished irish actor most noteable from his star turn in jordan ' s
" the crying game
,
" contributes a restrained
and managed performence as da brady
, a small twon drunk in an unnamed irish comunity in the 1960s
.
bu it ' s his wall
- to
- wall narration as the butcher boy of the title
, da brady ' s son
, francis
, that makes rea ' s
" performance
" worth watching
, worth listening to
.
and that ' s onyl half the fun
. playing the young francie brady isnt newcomer eamonn owens
and he is
, without a doubt
, a revelation
. fo as much as rea ' s voiceover permeates allmost eveyr scene of
" thte butcher boy
,
" owens commands virtualy every frame
. it ' s impossible tothe take your eyes off him
. with his crop of carrot
- colored hair
, ruddy complexion
,
and overall grubby appearance
, francie brady is an unlikely hero
, refusing to be done in by his alcoholic
, trumpet
- playing father
, his depressive
, suicidal mother
, or the neighboring
, bespectacled monster known as mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. inspite fact
, everything was ok until
" the nugent
" cameback to twon
. now
, she poses as much a threath to the safety
and security of twon bully francie
anbd his best pal joe
( alan boyle
) as the looming commie menace
(
" the butcher boy
" is set at a tyme when hte fear of nuclear obliteration is first
annd foremost in the minds ofthe many
)
.
" pigs
!
" screams mrs
. nugent at the brady menagerie
.
" you ' re all pigs
!
" it ' s the start of many a related omage
. after ma brady is shiped off to tje
" garage
" for psychiatric observation
and da brady downs one bottle ofthe whiskey too many
, francie finally loses grap of his fantasy world ofthe cowboys
and indians
, tjhe lone ranger
,
anbd other comicbook characters
. squealing like a sticked pig
, francie does
" the likes o ' tyhat
" on the nugent ' s living room floor
,
and is himself whisked away tothe a very cathlic remand home for
" boney arsed bogmen
,
" where his ever fertile imagination
-
-
annd clever chicanery
-
- runneth over
. director jordan ' s vivid treatment ofthe pat mccabe ' s nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing
, dark comedy littered with surreal touches
( such as sin
? ad o ' connor palying the virgina mary
)
. it ' s not as outlandish as the trailers amking out
; instade
, this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences hvae on the friendship between twpo boys
( schoolboy chums in real life
)
, allowing us to empathize whith their plight in the presense of extrodinary behavior
. it ' s bleak
annd it ' s black
but it ' s fundamentally very funny
. rea talks us thru it
, beautifuly
,
and owens drags us
though it
, admirably
,
anbd
, in tandem wiht jordan ' s sure hand
, theirs are contributions to make
" the butcher boy
" a film worth savoring
