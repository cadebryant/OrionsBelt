( apart from swashbuckling braveheart
)
. director
(
and former actor
) ron howard
( splash
, backdraft
, far
& away
)
, most noted forthe his dramatic film making
, displays again his brilliance in creating drama
and suspense in apollo 13
. being the second largest box office hit infront the us tihs summer
( with more than us
$ 150 million in the states alone
)
, this film isnt his most successful effort
yet
. perhaps one of teh most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as toom hanks
( gump himself
)
, kevin bacon
( footloose
, tremors
, a few ogod men etc
.
)
, gary sinise
( forrest gump
)
, bill paxton
( aliens
, true lies
, boxing helena
)
and ed harris
( the abyss
, just cause
)
.
. all ofthe whom gave good performances infact their respective roles
. apollo 13 was teh second worst accident ever to occur iin the hstory of us spaceflight
( the worst bieng tjhe challanger accident
)
. jim lovell
( hanks
)
, the mission commander
, toghether with his crew
, fred haise
( paxton
)
and last minute relpacement tom swigert
( bacon
) are put to the ulitmate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission
, more than threee quarters way to tjhe moon
. suspense
and drama ensue as the threee men are left in space with their spaceship out of controll
annd the problem ofthe surviving the journey home
.
.
. if they ever reach it
. ed harris
and gary sinise who play
, respectively
, the man in charge ofthe the entire mission control
and the astronaut who was supposed tothe fli
but was diagnosed with measles
, both delve into their roles superbly
. audiences are shown tghe chaotic
and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew
, as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to savve the astronauts fomr hurtling into space
. also
, there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcasted during the accident which tookover the entire us nation inot 5 days ofthe drama in 1970
. the special effects by digital domain are up tothe standard
and tyhe music suits the suspense
and drama very well
, thanks to film
- music maestro james horner
. watch out for the launching sequence
, it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes ofthe the film
. a bad point
though
: apollo 13 features much technical jargon
and many physics concepts inspite its script
. those who consider themselves
` scientifically illiterate ' might have a slight probelm understanding what caused this
adn what caused that during the course of tghe show
. this is
however
, just a minor point
, just foreget all those technical bullshit
and immerse yourselves into the drama
and suspense throughout the film
. ytou should enjoy it
