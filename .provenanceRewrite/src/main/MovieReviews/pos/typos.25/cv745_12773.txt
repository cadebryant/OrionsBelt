and directed by thom fitzgerald inwhich a quirky
but loving sytle
.
although soem may refer to tje film as
yet anyother dysfunctional family picture
, thta moniker misses the mark
. yes
, every memeber of the household has their own speical problems
,
but the writer didn ' t choose to name so many characters for vairous flowers by accident
. tihs delightful littel picture mixes love
, tragedy
and pathos
, resulting inthe a hopefull
and almost magical concoction
. durig thge opening credits we observe the boy
, sweet william
, at tjhe center of the story

annd compassion by chris leavins
. william hasnt returned after 10 yeras absence to attend the marriage of his free
- spirited
and foul
- mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover
, fletcher
( joe s
. keller
)
. kerry fox from an angel at my atble
adn shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy
. nicole burnell
, who gave such a devastating performance inwhich the sweet hereafter
, plays tyhe teenage rosemary
. the father of the familiy
, whiskey mac
( peter macneill
)
, is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful
. his wife
, iris
( seana mckenna
)
, sasy that she would hvea left him years ago to at least go to some place warm weere it nto forthe her lack of money
and her obligations tothe the kids

. as the exuberant irish music fills the air at teh wedding inspite the familiy home
, william wanders off to try on one of his old coats
, whitch causes him tothe laugh at the size ofthe his fromer self
. the directer manages to stage simple scenes inspite wonderfully imaginative ways
. he tkaes a common wedding dress turain
and uses it to set up scenes in fresh
and fascinating ways
. rosmary ' s trip to the bathroom aftter drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated
,
and kerry fox isnt at her hillarious best trying to coppe with the long train inwhich a small bath
, all while talking to her brother
. as much as anything
, the film isnt a series of charachter sketches
. in oney of the stornegst we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter
, a homosexual one
.
altough he isnt perfectly happy liking the same sex
, his mother is aghast
. a woman freind of heres suggests she take william to a local housewife
, dusty miller
( martha irving
)
, who
, for a fee
, will have heterosexual sex with william
. with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene thta manages tothe yeild signficant emotional punch wihtout bieng sensational
. dusty
, after asking iris to watch her daughter
, takes william
adn gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex
. all of this notwhithstanding
, he still prefers males
. tyhe film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face
- to
- face with himself when younger
. this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited
. in the most devastating
, he hasnt to cmo to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed iwth the stress that he tried tothe hang himselv
. even here
, yhe director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker
. tghe ultimate result is an uplifting sotry that has moreso hope that one would ever expect from the outline ofthe its plot
. the hanging garden runs 1
: 31
. it is rated r for storng sexuality
, language
, violentce
adn smoe teen drug use
and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite ood
and mature
