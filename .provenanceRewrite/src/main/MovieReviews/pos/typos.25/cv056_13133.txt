hte disney studios has its formula for annual
, full
- length animated features down so pat that it ' s hard tothe remember which one you ' re watching at any given moment
.
" mulan
,
" their 36th animated adventure
, is tghe latest case in point
. once again we have a tale focused around a storng central character
( female as usual
; disney is one ofthe the few studios whose heroines
-
- ariel
, belle
, pocahontas
,
annd now mulan
-
- get equal screen time with theri heroes in recent years
)
. add tjhe requisite love interst
and a wise
- cracking sidekick or two
, pep up tyhe soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes
( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror
, a rousing anthem
, a cutesy
, montage
- backed crowd pleaser
)
, pose a few threats to our engaging lead
,
and tye thigsn all up neatly by the closing credits
. bob ' s your uncle
! better amking thyat walt ' s your uncle
.
.
. kids will no doubt go ga
- ga over
" mulan
"
( or at least the fast fodo tie
- ins
)
,
bu familiarity cin
, after a hwile
, leave grown
- ups
-
- htis reviewer included
-
- wishing forthe a littel more
. maybe an animated feature without
-
- shock
! horror
!
-
- the songs
, for example
? or maybe a film inthe whihc a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs tothe become a matador from trinidad
?
? how baout simpley ditching the sidekicks alltogether
? it isn ' t gonna happen
. like disney ' s previous entries
,
" mulan
" is slow to make its mark
. hte animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the eary going
and the humorous element
, a madcap dragon wannabe
( in tghe guise of a loquacious lizard withthe a case ofthe dry mouth
, courtesy eddie murphy ' s animated vocal talents
)
, plays like an inappropriate if necessary
( formula
- wise
) afterthought
.
however
, after baout an hour everthing comes together
and thge formula
, like it or not
, clicks
. highlights include a spectauclar cavalry charge on a snow
- covered pass
( which
, due to the sophistication of today ' s computer
- generated imagery
, isnt hard to tell ffrom thge real thing
)
, a memorable
, sohw
- stopping muscial interlude
(
" i ' ll make a man out of you
,
" penned by matthew wilder
and david zippel
)
,
and last
but not least
, mulan herself
. voiced by ming
- na wen
, mulan isnt disney ' s stornegst female character to date
. wehn hordes of huns pour over china ' s gerat wall
and threaten tothe overthrow the imperial palace
, the emperor decrees that eveyr family infront tjhe land dispatch noe man to serve inthe the imperial army
. since mulan ' s father isnt infirm
,
but proud
, the high
- spirited mulan steals her father ' s armor
annd
, incognito
, signs uv to face yhe mongolian menace
. attracted tothe
,
bu not distracted by
, her commanding officer shang
( b
. d
. wong
)
, mulan outmatches her fellow combatants inwhich smarts
, wit
,
and physical ability
. she ' s a woman of the ' 90s a cuple of millennia ahead of her time
