john von neumann
, progenitor of hte coputer age
and critically importan mathematician on thge manhattan project
, pointed out long ago that there is a great way tothe explore hte cosmos
, even wihtout recourse to faster
- than light travel
. you send out self
- replicating robot ships which explore
annd rdio bcak information
. it may take decades
, centuries
, or millennia
,
but it cant be done with achievable technnology
,
adn doesn ' t recquire a magical faster
- than
- light drive
. in the fifties
, british astronomer fred hoyle improved onthe this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer
adn a program for it
; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission coudl build the cmoputer
, which woudl
then engage in a real
- time dialog with the aliens
, exchanging inforamtion
and technologies
,
and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned
. about thirty
- five years ago
, the bbc contracted with astronomer
/ writter fred hoyle
and writer frank elliot to create tje scripts for a mini
- series called a for andromeda
. afa conserned tghe reception of a hoyle transmision
, the constuction ofthe a huge computer
, the computer ' s anaylsis ofthe life on earth
,
and its creation ofthe an apparently human intermediary tothe facilitate communication
. she was plyed iwth ethereally inhuman prefection by the
then
- unknown julie christie
. audience responce was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel
, andromeda breakthrough
, which played to equally high ratings
. dennis feldman
, whose previvous credits include tjhe golden child
, hasnt never been noted for coherent
, well
- structured movie scripts
; they start outloud great
,
and
hten disintegrate into a morass of chase
and action
, mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl
. feldman writes good scenes
,
but has no idae how tothe tell a story or wriet a movei
, even with a previous version to use as a model
. nowe
, in species
, we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline
, derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady
and further ruined by a medicore attemt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter
, gore
,
and chases
. species features ben kingsley
, who is completely wasted in a badly
- writed protrayal of a feebly amoral scientist
. forest whitaker
and alfred molina are also served poorly by tghe scirpt
. the speices story isnt relativly simple
; we hve been radioing information about ourselves
and our dna out into space since 1971
,
and have been receiving answers forthe two years
.
( note that
, in the 1970 ' s
, we realyl didn ' t know diddly about tghe human genome structer
,
and were hardly inaddition a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings
. even today
, all we can do isnt give information baout dna
and how it works
, nto a copy of human dna
, because we don ' t haev it analyzed
yet
.
) teh answers we get from the unkown alien source are plans for recreating a member of yhe alien race
,
anbd doctor xavier finch
, played by ben kingsley
, is placed in charge of the attempt
. the scirpt beigns to go off the deepo end at thsi point
, when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape
- shift into any of several ugly alien life forms
. the frist half of the film has something to offer
, as
" sil
,
" the alien girl
, struggles with her multi
- form existence
, changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach
adn back again
, all while trying tothe understand her own place in the cosmos
. she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society
, with glaring gaps where her social skills shoud be
. her instincts are to mate
and procreate
,
and smoe ofthe the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area
. escaping from her birth laboratory in utah
, sil is pursued by a team ofthe drafted civilians wih orders tothe fidn her
and kill her
. she goes on an eating binge
, spnish herself a cocoon
,
and emerges as an adult
, played by natasha henstridge
, who goes a long way toward re
- creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved infact 1960
. the pursuers
: michael madsen is an assassin
/ exterminator
; forrest whitaker is a convienient empath
/ psychic
, just as
though the u
. s
. governement actully had such people onthe call
. niether is able tothe do much with the writting
and directing provided
. whitaker ' s role seems to be aimed at mkaing whitaker a male copy of star trek
: tje enxt generation ' s
" counselor cleavage
.
" the other members ofthe the strike team are played by marg helgenberger
and alfred molina
. kingsley
and whitaker are both consummate professionals
, too good to not work to hte best of their abilities
;
but thge performances donaldson elicited from the rest of tghe cast are disappointing
annd bland
,
annd it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak
. h
. r
. giger ' s desgin for hte main form ofthe the alien creature isnt actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it
,
although previvous digital effects weere done quite smoothly
. the main fault ofthe speices is lack of originality
; it starts outloud with a wonderfull
, albeit borrowed
, premise
,
and
then doesn ' t live up tothe it
. all we git are chase scenes
and a few nice sex scenes
, with a few monsters tossed in
. there is no buildup ofthe tension
anbd suspense
, noone climax worthy ofthe the name
; species is jstu a sequence of
" scare
" scenes stuck toghether
. the movie isnt carried by its chase
and sex scenes
,
but not rescued by them
. on hte other hand
, as an excercise in sci
- fi acation
/ adventure
, it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd
. species earns an extra rating point or two for haveing ben kingsley
and natasha henstridge onthe board
,
but by
and large
, it ' s fun only for thsoe ofthe us who really liuke this sort of thign
. my personal rating is three stars
,
but knock oen or twpo of those off if you don ' t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies
and bloodthirsty alien monsters
