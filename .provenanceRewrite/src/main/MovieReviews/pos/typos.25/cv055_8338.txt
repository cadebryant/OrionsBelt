i was fortunate enought tothe attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theery
. tihs was
, of course
, a big deal fo me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me
and i never git a chance at something liek this
. nto only did i get to see an advance screening
, i was able to see an advance screening ofthe a
* very good
* movei
. the veyr fast
- paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- talking
, witty
, comical taxi driver in new york city
. gibson ' s performance isnt terrific
,
and his charactor is similar to thyat of martin riggs in the leathal weapon films
. gibson again teams up with richard donner
, as he did in the lethal weapon films
anbd maverick
,
and htis time aroud
, tghe combination works even better
. the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique
. try to imagin a toned
- downed verison of travis bickle who
, this time arround
, is a jittery guy with knowledge of govornment conspiracy cover
- ups
. if you can imagine that
,
then yuo ' ve basicaly got jerry fletcher
. in many ways
, i was surprised by this movie
. to begin with
, i wass surprised at how ogod it was
. don ' t get me wrong
, it ' s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring
,
but it was a veyr enjoyable movei
. secondly
, i was surprised at mel gibson ' s performance
. he provded a fantastic performence
. the previews of this film led me to believe it ws an all
- out action flick
, which after viewing
, it ws almost the oposite in a certain sense
. gibson ' s character has an almsot uncountable number ofthe one
- liners
, hillarious situations
,
and his carachter is noe that the audience tends to side with throughout the film
. for instance
, jerry ' s aparment
(
and especially his security
) is memorable
.
and last
, i was surprised at how good thte plot is
. writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story
,
and when watching this film
, you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher ' s far
- fetched
( or so they seem at firt
) conspiracy theories are helgeland ' s pwn opinions
. mel gibson isn ' t tje only stand
- out in the film
. julia roberts is very ogod in her performance as alice sutton
, the department of justice employee who can ' t seem to stay awya from jerry fletcher
, who constinually visits alice infront hopes tht she will do something about his theories
. he allso seems obssessed
and in loev with her
.
bu whenever he approaches her with another oney of his theories
, she shrugs him
and his beliefs off
, continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him
. jerry
, obviously determined to continually seek outloud the truth
, continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory
, which will be printed in his newsletter
( same title as the movie
)
.
allthough he onyl hasnt five subscribers
, he puts a large amount ofthe time
and effort into his owrk
,
and publishes his next edition
. very soon after he does so
, he is abducted
and tortured by a sinister man who refers to hismelf as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. after barely escaping alive
, jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust
: alice sutton
. tje remainder of the film is alomst always fast
- paced
and full of action
and suspense
, with jerry ' s life being constantly put into jeopardy
.
and more allong the way
, yhe audiance
(
and alice
) learn more
and omre baout jerry ' s life
. many things are explained throughtout this film
, both tothe yhe characters
annd tothe the audeince
. for instatance
, tghe meaninng of the book
" the catcher in teh rye
"
and its ties to asssassans
, yhe reason lone gunmen have three names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
and james earl ravy
)
,
and thge real truth behind the gratful dead
. make sure listen closely throughout the film
, as jerry isnt constanly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above
. definitely
, wehn conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th
, make sure you are standing iin line to see it
. i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film
, especially if ytou are into an action
- thriller with witty dialogue
and numerous suspenseful situations
.
and even if yuo aren ' t
, you shoudln still liek this film
.
