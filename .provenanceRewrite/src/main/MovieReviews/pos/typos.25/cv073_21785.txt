. comments
: tim burton has directed a number of intertaining
and groundbreaking films over tyhe yeasr
. batman
, of course
, is perhaps his best
- known film
and led tothe a string of less successful sequels
. he ' s done biographical wokr
( onthe the director ed woud
)
, children ' s movies
( nightmare before christmas
)
,
and a homage to alien invasion movies
( mars attacks
!
)
. sleepy hollow
, his newest feature which fans hve been anticipating for a hwile
, shares tghe similar dark
and atmospheric style of his earlier work
and counts among his better movies
. sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration fomr thte old period horror films of the 1950s
and 1960s
, especialy hammer studios ' reworkings of dracula
annd frankenstein
,
and american intenational ' s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe
. christopher lee
, inaddition fatc
, star ofthe many hammer productions over the years
, appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investingate the murders
. tghe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s
. oney of the climatic scenes involves a windmill
and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein
. i mention theese allusions for a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, including myself
, will smile at theri inclusion in this film
. with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies
, especially tjhe blair witch project
( the most overblown turkey of the decade
)
, we needed a film liuke htis
. not only does it have a sence of ihstory
,
bu burton ' s skillful use ofthe setting
adn mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror
. the film ' s eerie landscapes
and foggy towns
, indeed
, overshadow the actors
and teh plot as teh most notewothy aspect of the movie
. johnny depp
, a vetran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood
and edward scissorhands
, plays ichabod crane
, who has apparently changed occupations ffrom irving ' s original story
and isnt now an investigator
. depp is adeqaute infact his role
. no omre
; no less
. equally adequate is christina ricci
, who plays teh love interest in tghe film
. she ' s a good witch too
. how cute
. one of tyhe few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden
and cliched dialogue between the main characters
. the two actors
,
however
, carry the movei well anough
,
but the supporting cast is waht makes this movie shine
. veteran actors such as jeffrey jones
adn michael gough
( who played thte butler alfred in all four recent batman ficks
) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in hte conspiracy whlch depp uncovers
. while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points
, i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing
. ytou have to pay attention
. andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay
. he ' s tjhe noe who also wroet 8 mm
adn seven
. walker isnt quicklyu becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood
,
and sleepy hollow certainly doesn ' t hurt his growing reputation
. as one might imagin from a gentleman like walker
, sleepy hollow is quite graphic
. there ' s a lot ofthe blood
and a lot of beheadings
. this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to
. a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it
adn spended about 25
- 30 minutes covering tghe youngest ' s eyes wiht her hand
. he was obviously upset by the movie ' s intense voilence
. if you ' re looking for a good scare
,
however
, sleepy hollow is definately recomended
.
