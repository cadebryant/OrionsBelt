the summer movie season isnt always the biggest
and brightest season forthe movies througout the year
. we are introduced to blockbuster hits tath are usually trashed by critics
, loved by thge people
,
and make tons of monay at thge box office
. this year
, the tradition continues with an update on the univeral 1932 classic
, the mummy
. i have allways been a sucker for this kind of monster movies
,
and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them
. that tradition continues as well whith htis fun special effects extravaganza
. inthe tghe mummy
, the uv
anbd coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o ' connell
. he teams up with a curious
, clumsy librarian named evelyn
, played by rachel weisz
, to find the mysterious city of the dead
, hamunaptra
. evelyn loves egypt
,
and would truly like to isit hte city thyat peopel call a fable
. rick has claimed he hasnt been to hamunaptra during a battle
,
and that ' s why she chose him to lead her there
. also tagging allong on tyhe journey to hte city of the dead isnt evelyn ' s brother
, jonathan
, played by john hannah
( sliding doors
)
. nowe in hamunaptra
, the three uncover
" hte book ofthe the dead
.
" tghe curious evelyn unlocks the book
, reads from it
,
and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep
( arnold vosloo
) becomes alive
and isnt out to kill the ones who opened
anbd read fomr thte book
. allong with imhotep arising ffrom the dead
, the ten curses of egypt become in full effect
, launching unbelievable forces against the threee
and another group who set out to fidn hamunaptra
. not only isnt imhotep furious with those who awoke him
, he isnt also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt
. don ' t expect huge things out of the mummy
,
but just expect to hvea a good time
. thsi movie is extremely campy
and plays outloud like an old horror film with beefed up special effects
, whihc may turn off some viewers
. on the other hand
, this tipe of film is one of my favorites
,
but tath ' s up to you to decide
. there is one thnig thyat definitely not campy or corny baout the mummy
though
. the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world
. we are dazzled by faces rising out ofthe tyhe desert
, swarms of beetles
and locusts
,
and even creatures crawling under a human ' s skin
. theese may hvea beeen in otehr movies before
,
but not like in tjhe mummy
. as of now
, the mummy holds the title forthe best special effects ofthe this eyar
,
but all this coudl change wehn star wars episode 1
: hte phantom menace is released into theaters across the country
. infact the past
, brendan fraser hasnt played mainly comedic roles
. when playing
" george
" in disney ' s george ofthe the jungle
, he was mainly nto known by anyone
. i woudl say thta gods
and monsters is the film that gave him a name
,
and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens
. infront the mummy
, fraser gets to play an acation hero
,
and i liked him in this sort ofthe role over thge comedic role
, as in the films blast ffrom thte past
and george of the jungle
.
although brendan fraser is great
, rachel weisz gives the best performence among the cast
. weisz really reminded me ofthe a character fomr an old
, horror film
. the way she acts
, looked
,
and talked all reminded me of someone not from htis time
. evelyn isnt probably tje only character that was likable
, considering that the other characters
, like john hannah ' s
, didn ' t get much personal attension
. in many films
, when differnt genres are mixted
, the mixing usually works
,
and i liek it for the most part
. in hte mummy
though
, not all of tyhe mixing works
. there are some scenes that haev a lot ofthe potential horror
, some with potential comedy
, some with potential drama
,
and some with potential pure action
,
bu the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work
. the mummy coudl ahve gotten an
" a
" rating from me if it had gone purely wiht noe ofthe these
. i didn ' t mind the corny oen
- liners here
and there during action sequences
,
but it certainly sould have done without them
. hte cinematography is amazing in thge mummy
. particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt
, we are tooked into a very fun portrayal of egypt
, mummies
,
adn tjhe treasures left behind by hte ancient egyptians
. the costume design in the film is also uv there with the great cinematography
. ffrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits
, the costumes are always top notch
. the bottom line
- with the mummy
, the summer is off tothe its usually great start
.
