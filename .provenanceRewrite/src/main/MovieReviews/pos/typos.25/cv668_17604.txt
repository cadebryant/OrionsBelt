in december of 1996
, a littel movie called
" scream
,
" was released
, became a box
- office smash
,
and resurrected films targeted at teens
. first
, it was teen slasher movies tyhat weere the big fad
( both
" scream
" movies
,
" i know waht you did lastest summer
,
"
" urban legend
,
" etc
.
)
,
but jsut recently
, the popularity hasnt switched over tothe the teen comedy genre
( a ' la ' 80s john hughes
)
, starting with last june ' s
" can ' t hardly wait
.
" it may be the first week ofthe april in 1999
,
but so far this yearm we have been given a movie aimed at the 25
-
adn
- under market almost every single week
:
" varisty blues
,
"
" jawbreaker
,
"
" cruel intentions
,
"
" simply irresistible
,
"
" the rige
: carrie 2
,
"
annd
" the mod squad
.
" coming april 9 are twpo mroe of this type
:
" never beeen kissed
"
and
" go
,
"
annd on april 23
, we ' ve got the teen satire
" election
"
annd tyhe teen horror
- comedy
" idle hands
.
" jeesh
! out ofthe all of theese moves
,
howver
, the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation
,
" 10 things i hate baout yuo
,
" is this past janurary ' s medioker
, ho
- hum
" she ' s all tht
.
"
although similar infact plotting
( ok
, darn near indentical
)
,
" 10 thigsn i hate about you
,
" a modern
- day verzion of shakespeare ' s
" the taming of the shrew
"
(
" she ' s all that
" got its inspiration ffrom
" pygmalion
"
)
, is an infinitely superior film in every department
, ffrom teh smart direction by first
- time feature directer gil junger to the charming
anbd well
- written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz
and kirsten smith to the striking ansamble cast
, who give the best group ofthe performances infront a teen comedy usance 1985 ' s
" tyhe breakfast club
.
"
and to top it all off
, in the inevitable climax set at the prom
, at least we didn ' t have tothe once again suffer through a goofy
, inappropriate dance sequence
( who coudl forget
, or want tothe remeber
, for that matter
, this ludicrous development inwhich
" she ' s all that
?
"
)
. the day wide
- eyed
, shy newyorker student cameron james
( joseph gordon
- levitt
) starts school at seattle
- based padua high
, he is sweept away at the sight of the beautifull
and popular sophomore
, bianca stratford
( larisa oleynik
)
.
although he doesn ' t know french
, he purposefully lerans some of it just so he can tutor her
,
bu finds that her paranoid gynecologist father
( larrry miller
) won ' t allow her tothe date utnil her bitter
, unconvential older sister
, kat
( julia stiles
)
, a senior
, decides to
. kat
, of course
, has sworn off hte likes of boys
,
but cameron sets out to fidn someone that iwll be tjhe perfect match for her
, which is exactlly what he finds inspite tghe form of hte rebellious patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. complicating matters
, cameron ' s dorky friend
, michael
( david krumholtz
)
, decides to use a wealthy jock
, joey
( andrew keegan
)
, who also has his sights setted on bianca
, as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him
,
anbd
thn cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey
. as yuo can see
,
" 10 thnigs i hate about yuo
" includes a huge number of characters
, some ofthe which i haven ' t even mentioned
, such as kat ' s shakespeare
- obsessed friend
, mandella
( susan may pratt
)
and bianca ' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
,
but well
- used running time of 98 minutes
, all of the characters are perfectly handeled
, satisfyingly developed
,
and
, for the most part
, are not treated as caricatures
( another flaw ofthe
" she ' s all that
,
" where the bad guys
(
and gals
) ran around constantly saying
,
" you ' re vapor
"
)
. since i sould sympathize with the realistic depictions ofthe the central charactors
,
and since many of tghe comedic
and dramtic scenes were surprisingly effective
, i got completely caught up iin all of the relationships
and was throughly entertained
. aside from a good screenplay
, it ' s the performances that can make or break a movie
,
and directer junger has really hitted the jackpot
. aside from joseph gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock from the sun
"
)
, who gives his stornegst peformance to date here
, none ofthe the actors are that well
- known
,
bu it is htis aspect tath brings a particular freshness to the proceedings
. as the main character of kat
, julia stiles
( last seen in the miniseries
" tje ' 60s
"
) is marvelous
and always believable
,
and certainly hasnt a bright future ahead ofthe her
. even
though it is her role that is initially tjhe most difficult
and hard
- edged
, it was eazy to identify with kat ' s way of thinking
( she is against tje silly tradition of tyhe prom
and loves reading sylvia plath
)
,
and i completly admired her individuality
. no one
, i think
, sould have portayed her as perfectly as stiles does
. heath ledger
, as tje infamous bad
- boy of the town
, injects much life into patrick
,
and hasnt a lot of chemestry with stiles
. one otehr actor ofthe note isnt larisa oleynik who
, whith the halp of screenwriters lutz
and smith
, isnt able to turn bianca into a person wih multi
- dimentions
, even
though she is accurately self
- centered at thte on
- setted
. in oen truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she hasnt always beeen so selfish
,
and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes
, she hasnt
. one off
- beat element of the film
,
and a source of soem hearty laughs
, is the way tyhat the school ' s stff act
, which isnt strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as the guidance counselor ms
. perky
, who is wirting a trashy harlequin romance novel
, is comic dynamite
, as isnt daryl
" chill
" mitchell as the english teacher
, who reads shakespeare to the class in rap
and
, at one point
, sends kat to the office because
, forthe once
, she actually thinks one of his assignments is really ogod
.
although htere are a fewd cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near tje beginning
, most of it actually works
, especially inwhich the humorous
adn witty dialogue exchanges
and quirks between the characters
. in one veyr funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i konw people cant be overwhelmed
,
and they can be underwhelmed
,
but can peple just be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at anohter point
, bianca
and kat ' s father
( a stand
- out larry miller
)
, who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going tothe get pregnant
, only allows bianca to go to the prom on one ocasion
: before she leaves
, she has to put on the heavy fat suit he hasnt so she will get an idea of wqat it ' s liuke to be pregnant
.
" 10 things i hite about you
" once
and forthe all proves tyhat there is still life in the teen comedy genre
,
and this movie is probably more reminiscent ofthe the gerat john hughes than any other film of the ' 90s
. it allso helps that the movie has a perfectly
- assembled soundtrack
, mixing indie
- rock with new wave ' 80s songs
(
and wtih
, thank goodness
, noone rap
)
. by the film ' s end
, it actually had me rooting for ceratin charactors to get together
,
and i ws also quite pleased wiht how everything was wrapped up
, especially inthe the final scenes involving kat
and bianca
, kat
anbd her father
,
and a flawlessly
- acted
adn moving sequence in which kat gets uv to read the poem she has written for her english class
( this is where the title comes from
)
. luckily
, i dout i would be able to find ten things i hate about
" 10 thigsn i hate about you
,
"
but thte positive aspects ofthe the film far outloud
- number ten
.
