every once inspite a hwile a movei comes allong that completely redefines yhe genre
: withthe dramas
, it was citizen kane
, with arthouse it was pulp fiction
,
and with comedy it wass
, well
, thta jim carrey guy
( okay
, so he ' s nto a movie
,
but he did have a huge influence on the genre
. not to mention an expensive one
.
) somtimes a movei even combines them all into a big
, sprawling motion picture event
, as did forrest gump four years ago
. wiht acation films
, it ws aliens
, whic was released to much hype seven years after it ' s equally
- innovative pparent
, alien
( 1979
)
. directed
and writed by james cameron
( t2
: judgement day
, the abyss
, true lies
)
, the authority on action films
, it wass a masterful encore to his sci
- fi thriller the terminator
( 1984
)
. hwile the original alien film was a dark
, enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew
, james cameron tookover the big
- budget action film iwth aliens
, which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thnig
,
allthough on a much
- larger scale
.
anbd boy
, did he take that route
! i ' d sday at about 165 mph or so
.
.
. the film opens 57 eyars affter the original
, wiht lt
. ripley
( weaver
) being found inspite her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel
. if you ' ll recall
, at the end of alien ripley
, the only surviving member
, cryogenically
" hibernated
" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship
. unfortunately
, she thought she ' d only be out for a couple ofthe weeks
.
.
. once she ' s returned to earth
, ripley is quickly interrogated by
" the company
"
, who quicklyu dismiss her
anbd her stories as lunacy
. in truth
, htey believe her
, as htey soon approach ripley with an offer tothe travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an
" alien advisor
"
. it seems that yhe colony planet was a once
- breeding ground for tjhe nasty aliens
,
and now all communication with the planet has been lost
.
.
. it doesn ' t exactly take a genuis to guess what happens enxt
: ripley agrees
,
and before you can sday
" big misteek
"
, she
annd the half dozen marines
, plus the slimy corporate guy
( reiser
)
, who has more than it looks liuke up under his sleeve
, are off to the collony
. when tehy arrive
, they find the planet in ruins
. only oen survivor is found
, a little girl
, newt
, who confirms that
, yes
, the aliens weere here
and that she only managed tothe survive by hidding inthe hte ventilation sytem
.
and soon enough
, the marines come under attack from the aliens
.
.
. what happens for the next hour
adn a half or so is what completely sets thsi movie apart fomr any otehr standard aline sci
- fi movie
: the action scenes
. cameron directs them so skillfully
,
and so suspensefully
, thgat you ' re literally ringing your hands by tghe time the finale rolls arround
. which features
, in my opinion
, yhe best fight scene ever recorded on film
, as ripley straps herself inot a huge robot
and battles thte nasty queen alien to the death
. many people will tell you that tihs film
, while being a great acation film
, has no real drama
annd is all cliches
. well
, htey would be wrong
, my friends
. if htis film had noone
" drama
"
,
then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 acadamy awards
? that ' s right
, best actress
. you nkwo that any action film that hasnt an oscar nomination attached tothe it for something other than technical stuff like editing
and f
/ x has got to be good
. in short
, aliens combines all the right elements
( great acation
and f
/ x
, drama
, a good plot
, good dialogue
,
and great villains
) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time
.
then again
, maybe not
. movies rise
and fall from glory
annd
, sad to say
, aliens was wrestled from it ' s throne ofthe best action movie by anyother cameron film
, t2
: judgement day
, in 1991
. so who iwll be the next king
? well
, let ' s wait until december 19th
and see
yet another james cameron film
- tghe highest budgeted film ofthe all time
- titanic to make that decission
. i can ' t wait
.
