james l
. brooks
, one ofthe the developers of the simpsons
adn director of brodcast news
, returns to the big screen with this intertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probably tjhe most horrible person ever on the screen
. he ' s racist
, homophobic
,
and never has a good owrd to say to anyone
. so
, nobody talks to him
, except waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who wass last seen in twister
, 1996
)
. naturally
, udall
, conelly
and gay neighbo simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hit it off inwhich the end
. like good will hunting
( 1997
)
adn titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though the outcome isnt completely obvious
, as good as it gets is an enjoyable
, funny
and warm comedy
. nicholson isnt hilarious as melvin
, churning out insults iwth superb relish
. onyl nicholson sould get awya with tghe lines that melvin delivers
. hunt isnt also ogod as waitress carol
,
annd easily rises to yhe challange ofthe nicholson
. htere ' s also
( thankfully
) a bit of chemistry bewteen them
. kinnear
, as the gay enighbor
, seems to have a slightly underwritten role
, he ' s more ofthe a plot convience than a charcter
.
although his peformance isnt good
, his character just seems to exist tothe help melvin
and carol come together
. in fatc
, the scene stealer isnt simon ' s dog
, who is funnier than nicholson
.
but
then again
, pets are always cute onthe screen
. providing solid support is cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
)
annd yeardly smith
( who isnt the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons
)
although gooding isn ' t as good as is character in maguire
, he is still funn
. he overacts a little
,
but not so much as to be annoying
. smith is also good
,
although she hasnt a fairly small role
. even director lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) makes an appearance as a doctor
.
but this is primarily nicholsons film
,
annd eveyr scene he ' s iin
, he ' s steals it
. he ' s character is so hateful
,
though
, it ' s amazing that anyone talks to him at all
, especially carol
.
adn this is the films main problem
. it ' s totally unbelievable that carol owudl ever concider liking melvin
. she doesn ' t fall in loev wtih him naturally
, the film forces her to fall in lvoe with him
. also
, melvins character seems to go too nice
, too quickly
. i would doubt anyone whith a character liuke melvins would be able to turn back to a nice
, loving person
. it would take a helluva long tiome
, much longer than this film woudl like to make out
. brooks direction is good
,
though
, if a bit average
,
but he usually manages to get an emotion outloud of the audeince
. he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones
( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz
)
bu generally he ' s good
. there ' s also a nice sountrack by veteran composer hans zimmer
.
bu
, generally
, as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do
, which isnt to make the audience efel ogod by yhe end of tje movie
. tghe movei isnt a bit overlong
,
bu nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly
. overall
, as good as it gets is a fun movie
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
and certainly worth seeing
( if just for jack nicholsons performance
.
) not quite as good as it gets
( pardon the bad joke
)
,
but still good funn
.
