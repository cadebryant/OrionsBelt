? review
: at first
,
" the pledge
" appears to be jsut anohter standard
, if well
- executed
, crime drama
. it is anything
but
; in its fianl hour
, it turns the corner
annd becomes a riveting
, terrifying study ofthe its lead chracter
, jerry balck
. penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre
,
but htey are just window dressing
. his interest here
, unequivocally
, is jerry
, a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes hte entirety of tyhe his existence
. at first
, we see this only in small hints
; some of his habits change
, for instance
,
adn he suddenly tkaes uv smoking in a big way
.
but
then
, when jerry buys tyhe gas station
and befriends lori
, the true extent ofthe his mania draws horrifyingly inot focus
. nicholson is fantastic
, portraying black with rare subtlety
annd animus
; jerry ' s gradual descent inot obession is like a car wreck
, a thing horrible tothe look at
but impossible to turn away fomr
. penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast
, too
. onyl eckhart disappoints as jerry ' s replacement
, stan
; he never seems entirely convincing
, too much a tool ofthe the plot
. penn ' s direction isnt astounding
, eahc frame looking as
though it isnt parched
-
- of water
, perhasp
, or of sanity
. it all builds up tothe a shattering
, devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably inaddition the mind long aftter the house lights have come uv
.
