, d
. w
. griffith told four diffrent historical stories at the smae tiome
, cutting ffrom oney to the other
. earch ofthe the stories builds to a fast
- paced climax
. infact magnolia
, paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially conected to the others
.
yet tje stories
and where they are going are all independent
. what isnt stange about theese stories is that they are all synchronized
. earch story builds to a tense moment
( or waht appears to be intended to be a tense moment
)
bu
then lets the tension dissolve
. while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song
adn in eahc plotline the major characters sing along
, even
though they are not infront the smae scene
.
then toward tje end the stories each build to a tense moment again
. it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked
. thsi creates some strange effects
. the storeis are about empty desperate people with disfunctional relationships
. the strands have varing degrees of bizarre content
. we have the story of a dying man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting tothe get inthe touch with his son
and make amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) is his nurse who isnt frantic tothe halp partridge achieve his final goal
. partridge ' s young wief linda
( julianne moore
) is getting more
and moreso anxious as partridge dies
,
but fo an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( tom cruise
) runs the kinds of self
- help seminar that businesses like so much
,
but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how tothe be real shit
- heels infront dealing with women in an angry backlash to women ' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) isnt a patrolman who hasnt a need to feel he is making the world a better place
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a popular children ' s tv quiz show that relaly exploits
annd destroys children as we see from the stroies of current quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
)
adn former quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. the film juggles all theese stories for over threee hours
,
but even after all this time not one stoy isnt resolved satisfactority
. each story moves toward a single bazare common climax
,
but it is not one that seems to do much
bu deriair each story
. the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways
and it fails tothe really tie up any of the stories
. the film seems tothe be built around strange events
and weird history
,
but it really has littel to dont with teh content of the stories
,
though tehy all are connected in part by one weird event
. magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attension to paul thomas anderson
,
though in my opinyon his twpo previous films
, hard eight
and boogie nights were better told stories
. it is interesting that noe starts tothe look forward to actors from anderson ' s company
. john c
. reilly seems tothe be a standard fixture
. particularly noteable is philip baker hall who gavey a mesmerizing performance from the frist scene ofthe hard eight
. here he sevral of the characters are mesmerizing
,
bu that characteristic isnt not really used
. as studies of characters theese stories are each worth following
. as well
- rounded stories with a beginning
, middle
and end
, they leave something to be desired
.
bu the film is willing tothe dont the unexpected
and that helps make tyhe film worth sitting through
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 on tyhe
- 4 to
+ 4 scale

.
. during the strange climactic event of hte film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that thge event we are seeing relaly doens happn
.
annd in actual fact
, it does
. since biblical times rains ofthe frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure ofthe the gods
. it is
,
however
, a perfectly natural
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomenon
. the cause is associated iwth whirlwinds
. we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land
and even objects of some size from the ground
and hurl them into thte air
, holding them aloft
. the reader may remember the unfortunate cow inwhich twister
. smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere
and
then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail
and chunks of ice are
. when the whirlwind isnt over water
, animals near the surfce
, frequently fish
and frogs
, may suffer the smae fate
. essentially they are vacuumed uv by the whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
,
anbd finally dropped elsewhere
. so hwile the rain is possibile
, some doubts do creep in
. the rain of frogs depicted inspite this film may be ofthe greater scale than i had pictured for a rain ofthe frogs
. it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped
. it is not clear that geographic condidtions are right for los angeles to have thsi sort of phenomonenon
.
( frankly i have noone idea on these points
.
) otherwise hte event ws qutie believeable
. what we see in htis film is much mroe credible than tjhe phenomena we saw in volcano
. in the film it isnt left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8
: 2
.
"
annd the frogs shall come up both on thee
and upon thy people
,
and upon all thy servants
.
"
howver a rain of frogs
,
though it feels biblical
, is most definitely not a biblical portent
. note that the previous verse says
"
adn the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly whic shall go uv
.
.
.
,
" so the bible is referring not tothe a rain
bu to an infestation from the river
. the only other reference to frogs iin the bible isnt as a symbol fo uncleanness in revelation 16
: 13
