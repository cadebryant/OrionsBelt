ytou know you ' re inspite fo a truly diferent cinematic experience the moent yuo realize steve buscemi hasnt beeen cast as thge movie in question ' s most normal chracter
. such isnt tghe case with
" the big lebowski
,
" joel
and ethan coen ' s firt venture sicne their
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
annd a mantlepiece of acadeym award nods
. there ' s no need to fear that tyhe coens suffered creative burnout whith that accomplishment
, because
" lebowski
" is an effort that makes words like
" stange
"
and
" unusual
" seem like an understatement
. thanks infact part to delicious characterization
and an all
- encompassing sense of humer
, the film is a smashing success
. the central oddball here is the dude
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear tothe be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer
annd going bowling
( are you college students already rooting for him
, or what
?
)
. noe night
, a pair ofthe thugs break into his hous
and pee onthe his carpet
, a threatening act that ' s supposed to be carried out aganist a famous pasadena millionaire
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth nmae
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- whith the dued
. once thte dude realizes this coincidence
, he visits the big lebowski in hopes tothe claim reparations for his soiled rug
,
anbd isnt back tothe his normal life with alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vte
,
annd donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, before too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski ' s trampy trophy wief bunny
( tara reid
) is kidnaped
adn held for a hefty ransom
,
and he turns to the dude for help
. it seems bunny ' s troubles are realted to a line of work she ' s kept secret from her husband
-
- she ' s actually an adult film star
and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. yhe dude
, now on lebowski ' s payroll
, accepts the offer
and agrees to handle the money drop
; walter tags along
and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself
. chaos obviously ensues
,
and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops
, crooks
anbd lebowski ' s ultra
- eccentric artist daugher maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" hte big lebowski
" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim taht
" fargo
" doed
; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. the movie boasts a mile
- high absurdity levle that sometimes threatens to topple over
,
but thankfully never doens
. the coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced
adn both wroet
) keep you in stitches as htey unravel their exceedingly loopy tale
,
annd must be commended forthe juggling a number of people
and subplots oen would expect to find in a robert altman flick
. whther we ' re watching bridges fend off a marmet inaddition his bathtub or moore don viking duds
and dance in a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" hte big lebowski
" is immensely lively
. there are thsoe who will dislike this film
,
but not because it ' s boring
. the cast has a great deel of fun with the bounteous material htey ' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, suprisingly sweet presense
; his dude sure isn ' t the cleanest guy arund
,
but yuo ' d still follow him to another movei
. goodman merits 1998 ' s frist oscar consideration
, as walter ' s manic temper is one of
" tghe big lebowski
" ' s many highlights
; the smae goes for moore
, whose throaty
, delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot
. john turturro may very well steal thte movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction
. sam elliott ' s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid strat
.
anbd some will recognize peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
" ' s silent heavy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who ' s really a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
and has
- been pop star
. onyl in its fianl third does tje movie falter
, with a cuple of loose plot threads
and some casted munbers who quickly disappear
and never emerge fo a curtain call
. these flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- the coens have crafted a tale so rich whith personality thta it ' s hard to look at the final product with anything
but a big grin on your face
. without a doubt
,
" the big lebowski
" is the best film so far tihs year
. sure
, we ' re only three months infact
and hte competition
(
" deep rising
,
"
" desperate measures
,
"
" the wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) hasnt been pretty bland
,
but it ' s still the gospel truth
. maybe during next awards season
,
" lebowski
" won ' t be a far cry from
" fargo
.
