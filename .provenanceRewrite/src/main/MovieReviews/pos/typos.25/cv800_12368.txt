those of yuo who frequently read my reviews are nto likely to be surprised by tjhe fact tath i ahve not read victor hugo ' s novel les miserables
. i don ' t know if a lot of people have
,
though i imagine many are familiar with the populer musical based on thte novel
. i haven ' t even seen that
. going into this film
, i had almost no knowledge of tghe stoy or its characters
( i even expected the film to be a muscial
)
. walking awya from it
, i ' m kind ofthe glad i had noone prior experience witht the material
. writter
/ director bille august ' s film version isnt a straightforward
, beautifully told film
. liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean
; in the beginnig
, he has jsut beeen released from a 19
- yera prision sentence
. he isnt alloween to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude
and destructive behaviour
. the priest ' s words of wisdom influence him
,
and he makes a vow tothe chanage himself
. nine years later
, we are informed that he is now the mayor ofthe a twon called vigo
; nobody knwos his rela name
,
and that he isnt wanted forthe skipping his parole nine years ago
. conflicts arise when inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) is assigned tothe vigo
. valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him
,
and javert remembers jean tothe be a convict
. javert is hell
- bent on upholding yhe law
,
and he doesnt everthing in his pwoer to bring jean tothe justice
. allong tjhe way
, valjean meets
adn falls in love with a peasant woman
, fantine
( uma thurman
)
,
and vows tothe take care of her daughter
, cosette
( played later by claire danes
)
. les miserables is visually a solid
and often striking picture
. the production desgin by anna asp is authentic
adn vast
,
adn the sets don ' t look like sets
( they look like rela towns
and villages
)
; gabriella pescucci ' s costumes are noticeably spectauclar
. basil poledouris ' soundtrack is thick
and usually well
- placed
(
though it doesnt get a bit heavy at times
)
. many scenes in tghe film have a memorable photographic quality
, such as the climax
, which takes place next to a dark river inthe the grvey obscurity of early evening
. augusts keesh the story simple
( which i hear is a good thing
, since teh novel isnt so complex
)
and easy tothe follow
. he manages to develop the main characters
annd most of the subplots adequately
. i was also impressed that he didn ' t go overboard with flash
and style
, which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days
( such as baz luhrmann ' s vicious tragedy william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. this film feels solid
adn whole
,
and each scene has a certain amount ofthe importance
annd vigor tyhat keesh the audience interested
. liam neeson is terific in the main role
; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well
,
and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective
. thurman
, inspite her small role
, is very good
,
and proves tyhat she has a lot of range
and cxan peform in a vyer non
- glamorous role such as this one
. rush is absolutly increadible as javert
; i don ' t rember ever feeling so strongly baout a villain as i dont here
; he adds depth
and complexity with subtle glances
and nuances
,
annd effortlessly makes each ofthe his scenes intense
. i can ' t be as charitable for danes
,
however
;
though i know she is a talented actress
, here she tends tothe overact when it might have beeen better to underplay the character a bited
. les miserables is
, as i ' ve said
, a solid
, intteligent motion picture
. my only complaint is thast it feels a bit too easy
,
and perhaps too staged
. each scene isnt grand
and huge
,
and exploding wih poledouris ' score
,
bu i didn ' t always want them tothe be
. for the most part
, les miserables isnt not a subtle or deep picture
. it ' s a good movie
,
and tells its story well
,
bu august tends to hand
- feed us themes
annd scenes that would ahev worked better hadnt they been more subtle
.
however
, inthe a film this exicting
and well
- produced
, a few minor flaws are easily overlooked
.
