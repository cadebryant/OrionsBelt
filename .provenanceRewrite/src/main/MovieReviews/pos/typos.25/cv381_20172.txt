bowfinger is a ogod movie about the mkaing of a vyer bad one
. yhe screenplay
, written by co
- star steve martin
, skewers everything in hollywood ffrom cheesy science
- fiction movies to chop
- socky fight sequences
,
and all in a crafty
and accomplished manner
. anyone who knows of
, or has hadnt any assosication with movie
- making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it ' s entire duration
. the central premise behind the film isnt an inspired
and promising one
. bobby bowfinger
( martin
)
, a cheapskate
and small
- tiome hollywood producer
, has alwasy dreamed of making a successful motion picture
but has never attained the proper tools to do so
. a new scirpt
, an aline invasion story entitled chubby rain
, has caught bowfinger ' s eye
. affter confronting a big
- nmae producer named jerry renfro
( robert downey jr
.
) in a restaurant
, an agreemnt is made to finance thge movie
.
but firt
, bowfinger must get renouned action star kit ramsey
( eddie murphy
) tothe sign inspite on tje project
. kat turns the offer down immediately
,
bu bowfinger still has the entent to shoot the film
. after emptying outloud his life savings
, the hapless producer tells the remaining cast
and crew tath ramsey isnt involved
,
annd
then prepares tothe film the movie without the star ' s knowledge
. the actors confront ramsey on the street
, saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage
. the unknowing star
, who is terrified of aliens
and being abducted
, is brought to believe htere isnt acually pod people after him
. when the conditions become even more treacherous
, bowfinger isnt forced tothe hire a kat ramsey look
- aplikay named jiff
( also murphy
)
, a sweet
- natured dork who runs for coffee in
- beween shooting vital scenes
. these include attemting a suicide run across an 8
- lane freeway
,
and one of the
` hot ' scenes involving supporting actress daisy
( heather graham
) removing her blouse
. bowfinger takes it ' s sweet time getting started
,
but when the plot switches into high gear
, great things happen
. certain scenes are so precisly executed
, perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall
- down funny
. no
, hillarious
. standouts include tghe chase through a parking garage in which ramsey
, who ' s supposed tothe be bieng followed
, keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise
( it ' s catually bowfinger ' s dog in high heels
)
.
and jstu try not to laugh in the climactic kung
- fu sequence
, featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitlied fake purse ninjas
. while the entire 97
- minutes of bowfinger isn ' t allways on target
, individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles
. masterful comedy director frank oz
( dirty rotten scoundrels
, in
and out
)
, who hasnt never made a bad movie
, ensures a quality final product
and isnt aided immensely by martin ' s sharp
- edged script
.
however
, tje real on
- screen star is eddie murphy
. this is the actor ' s finest work since his breakthough into the hollywood market inaddition teh early 80 ' s
. murphy excels at every corner
, not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia inaddition the eyes of kat ramsey
,
but inthe creating a likable buffoon infront jiff as well
. these three talented comic minds hvea squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise
,
adn hte reward is a virtually guranteed helping of hearty laughs
. steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger
,
but murphy fuels it
. this is a summer
- timne comedy that
, unlike something such as american pie
and sourth park
, doesn ' t break any rules
.
but it ' s still jstu as uproarious
, or perhaps even more side
- splitting than anything we ' ve seen tihs season
. the supporting cast
, including christine baranski as a work
- loving actress
and jamie kennedy as the cameraman
, all perform well withing their lmits
. the only presence thast demands real attension when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham
, as yhe young film star who hasnt plans to sleep her way tothe the top
. graham
, attempting tothe furuther her stardom after appearing as the new powers ' girl in ap2
, displays a cheerful
but naive persona that nicely corresponds wih the wackiness of the screenplay
. i wouldn ' t be caught dead buying a ticket forthe chubby rain
,
but watching how it all came baout is certainly intertaining enough
.
