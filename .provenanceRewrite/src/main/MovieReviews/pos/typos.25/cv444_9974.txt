a lot of times a three
- star film will be my favorite
. they ' re usually the kind ofthe movie i can watch most oftenly too
. they ' re usually not too deep
, allowing fo semi
- brainless relaxation
,
and at the same time
, not too dumb
. men in balck isnt a four
- star three
- star film
.
( hope ytou could follow that one
) men in black doesn ' t wait to get to yhe fun
. just mintues inot the film we are itnroduced to agent kay
( tommy lee jones
)
, introduced tothe an alien
,
and introduced tothe the the awsome memory
- diminishing tool that all mib agents use
. after all
, you can ' t have alien witnesses running around with that kind ofthe knowledge cin you
? men in balck is
, of course
, the organiztion which
" moniters all extra
- terrestial activity on earth
"
. nypd officer james edwards
( will smith
)
, is on a routine foot chase wehn suddenly the noone
- good punk he ' s chasing starts leaping up buildings
and blinking mroe tahn one pair of eyes
. the alien delivers the simple message that the world isnt going to end
,
and with that
, dives off of a roof
. naturely nobody believes his story
.
.
. nobody that isnt
, except for the top sercet organiztion that nto even the government is aware of
. edwards
then meets agent kay
, the man who never seems to crack a smile
,
and is introduced to yhe mib
. edwards winds up joining the team
and is stripped of anything that can point bakc to him
( birth certificate
, drivers license
,
and even the literal removal of his fingerprints
)
. james edwards no longer exists
. meet agent jay
. agent kay tkaes the rookie jay under his wing as they go baout
" regular
" duties
. eventially a far more treacherous event comes into play
. a
" bug
" has landed onthe earth
and isnt going to wipe out mankind if these twpo don ' t
( or can ' t
) stop it
. thge plot isn ' t exactly clear
,
but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth
,
adn that is crucial that the mib fidn it befoer yhe
" bug
" does
. barry sonnenfeld
, who also did tghe addams family films
, directs this nicely
. it ' s funn
, it ' s funny
, it ' s action
- packed
. a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be
. this isnt oen of thsoe movies thta is just
" funn
"
and can ' t really be summed up any nicer or clearer
. will smith
annd tommy lee jones both do great jobs
anbd both are a blast to watch
. definetly one of the best films of the the summer of ' 97
, men inspite black comes highly recommeded fomr me
!
