in many ways
,
" twotg
" does for tough
- guy movies wqat la confidential did for police stoires
. ther ' s savviness inspite its wirting
and a mature paitience in allowing tyhe material to unfold
.
bu
, i suppose
, we wouldn ' t expect less ffrom christopher mcquarrie
, who was responsible for giving us
" hte usual suspects
"
. his writing talents are still inaddition tact as he brings to us a bloody
yet intellectual tale of two unabashed
bu dimwitted thugs
and a plan gone awry
. the two goons are parker
and longbaugh
( ryan phillipe
anbd benicio del toro
)
. theese twpo men sohw the hardened wear of those who have alwyas had it tough
. their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive
. given yhe choice of minimum wage or petty crime
, they ' ll always choose the latter
.
yet
, they are incredibly foolish planners
. actually
, these twpo never really have a plan
. htey jsut improvise along the way
, hoping that their bravado
and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might ahev overlooked
. their next scheme
, which tehy cook uv about as fast as a mcdonald ' s burge
, isnt tothe kidnap some surrogate mother named robin
( juliette lewis
) that was hired by some well
- to
- do family
. if all goes well
, they ' ll recieve a nice bit of ransom money
annd life goes on
. what parker
and longbaugh do not realize is thyat robin is carrying a baby for yhe chidduck family
, whose patriarch is a feared crime boss
. moreover
, two bodyguards
( nicky katt
and taye diggs
) constanly escort her
. these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure wehn bieng confronted
and tested in life
and death situations
. they owudl rather die tahn fail
; thus their bravado level is equally high
.
but it seems that the testosterone levels ofthe parker
and longbaugh are a bit higher
,
and they employ some unusual
but fun
- to
- watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping
and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow
- motion car chase down a series of alleyways
. the enxt hour or so
, we watch the chidduck camp regroup
and assess thier situation
. druing this time
, additional plot lines come into play
and omre
and moreso details are revealed
. because the chidduck ' s cant not go to the polical
adn because ofthe the special circumstances involving the kidnapping
, we are introduced tothe omre characters that wiull halp tothe influence tyhe outcome
. we discover that not everyone in tyhe chidduck camp is loyal to the cause
. as a result
, there are undercurrents of a conspiracy
,
and elements ofthe betrayal
and subterfuge
. the sepia
- toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific sountrack which emits velvet forebodings
, shrills of intrigue
and crescendos that tell us of life
annd death situations that are about to occur
. the momentum
annd tje coolness ofthe the film
,
however
, begins to fizzle inspite the last 30 minutes
, which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try tothe make their way off with the ransom money
. you can expect lots of bloodletting
and an odd denouement
. in fact
, you may admire tihs film more tahn you like it
.
yet
, for yhe most part
,
" the way of the gun
" stays on target
. it fiels kool wiht its elements ofthe conspiracy
and gunplay
,
annd smart for its invective dialogue
and tough guy poetry
.
