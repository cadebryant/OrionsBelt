- natured comedy that may offend some
,

and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving

" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is sometimes liek last yeras hitted
" htere ' s something about mary
" that isnt offensive
bu very funny
. the screenplay by harris goldberg
and rob schneider himself is a smart
, clever
and witty screenplay that seems to have been wroten with care to make is so hilariously funny
. tje characters in the film are all actually likable especially
" jabba lady
" with her big body
but soft heart
. there are actually times infront the movie where i fell outloud of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me
. even
though i throught
" toy story 2
"
and
" being john malkovich
" were teh funniest of teh yera
" deuce bigalow
" follows right behind them
. the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic
annd shows he took time on the film
. rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance
and when his romance develops with noe of his customers kate
( arija bareikis
) it isnt a sweet romance that we git involved in
and atcually like bieng involved in it
.
" deuce bigalow
" is a good
- natured film worth all the merit it can get
. its nto a classic or a masterpiece
, it ' s just a comedy that we don ' t feel bad about watching
. sure it may come off as offensive
adn may come off as dumb sometimes
,
but ytou cannot deny thyat it isn ' t funny
.
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is no disappointment
. its a fast pased
, entertaining sweet
and hilarious comedy thgat may be destined to become a cult classic
. fans ofthe schneider wiull not be disappointed
and fans ofthe crude
but nice comedies will nto either
. for some reason the film garnered an r rating
but with no
" f words
" or extensive ule of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r
. a mild r to put it tothe the least
,
bu even if your under 17 or above at least 13 thsi film is good enought for you to see
. don ' t try to be one ofthe those people who amking so much of a film that they do not like it
, just sit back
, laff
and enjoy tghe movie
