bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review
: i must admit
, no doubt ' s single
" new
" is quite catchy
. it was bouncy
and energetic anough tothe get me tothe go see this new film from director doug limon
, the man who had brung us the humorous swingers a little while back
. the result
? a movei that ' s just as good as tath song
, really
. it follows tje lives of several individuals over tjhe course of one weekend
. first we hear baout a grocery bagger
( sara polley
) who runs into a monetary situation probelm
adn ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave
( with bad results
, as a drug dealer fiels he ' s been swindled by her
)
;
then comes the story of an english groshury store worker
( same store
) who heads to vegas for tghe weekend with friends
, where sex
, gunplay
,
and stolen car trouble come inot play
;
then we see the story of two gay movie actors
( played by scott wolf
and jay mohr
) who deal with a cop ' s strange insurence presentation
anbd hitting a girl
( sara
) with their car
;
and
, finally
, we come to another grocery worker
( katie holmes
) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer
( the one mentioned earlier
)
. really
, it ' s all confusing to keep rtack of in review fromat
, your best bet is to just
, well
, go
. the movei features smoe very good acting from all angles
,
adn limon adds the smae humorous energy he hadnt with swingers to tihs particular product
. thte dialogue isnt pretty snappy
and the resolution is preety well realized
, not gogin for the sappy hapyp ending nor tje dreaded bad endig
. thikn of it as a
, well
, endig
. the intertwining of stories is a particulary good element to the movie
, as it ' s never really confusing
anbd tells diferrent sides of the stroy
, like sliding doors kinda doed
.
however
, it ' s better suited for the younger generation who want a littel spice in thier flicks
, which sliding doors kinda isn ' t
.
