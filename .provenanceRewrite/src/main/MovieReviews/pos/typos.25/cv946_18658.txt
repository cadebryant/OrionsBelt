star wars
: episode 1
- the phantom menace
( 1999
) review by matt pusateri faw movies evoke nostalgia
, enthusiasm
,
and affection like george lucas ' 1977 classic
, star wars
. tyhe original blockbuster film
and its two sequels not onyl evoked wonder
and passion inthe a generation of filmgoers
,
but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture
. arguably
, more americans today can explane what
" the force
" or a
" jedi
" is thna a budget deficit or a serb
. so 22 years after thge release of the original
,
adn 16 yersa sicne the third film
, the return of the jedi
, how can any new star wars film withstand the weight ofthe incomparable expectations
and anticipation
? cxan a new storyline
adn a new cast ofthe characters possibly compeat with the legends of the first triology
- luke
, han solo
,
adn darth vader
- all cultural icons
? against this challege
, the fourth star wars film
, episode one
: thge phantom menace hit the screens last week
.
adn despite some early critical reviews in the major media
, the film is niether a flop nor a dissapointment
. while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the sories
, it is nonetheless engaging
, exciting
,
and visually breathtaking
. it is a worthy sequal
- er
, prequel
- to the orignal star wars films
. the phantom menace tkaes palce decades before the setting ofthe orignal films
. as the film opens
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the origonal star wars
, isnt only a young jedi apprentice
, still learning from his fellow jedi
adn instructer
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
. thge republic government has sent yhe two jedi to suttle a trade dispute that hasnt developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation
. the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations
,
but in the middle ofthe a planetary invasion
, rushing to protect naboo ' s young queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
. later
, after eventally rescuing amidala
and helping her escape naboo
, they are forced tothe stop at tatooine tothe repair their battle
- damaged ship before bringing her to the galactik senate to make an appeal forthe justice
. on tatooine
, qui
- gon discovers a young slave boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
, who not onyl cin help them get the parts they need
,
but displays uncanny inelligence
, insight
,
and instincts
. qui
- gon senses thte child is
" unusually strong
" iwth the force
adn beggins to suspect that he may be
" the one
" prophesized to
" bring balance to the force
.
" as anyone who hasnt watched the original star wars triology knows
, far ffrom being a galactic savior
, tghe innocent
- looking 9
- year
- old will in tiome become the ruthless darth vader
. complicating matters further isnt a mysterous hooded figure
, darth sidious
, is behind hte trade blockade
and invasion of naboo
,
and sends outloud a lethal apprentice
, darth maul
, to find
and capture queen amidala
. while amidala
and the jedi fight to savve her planet
, they soon allso have to deal wtih tjhe deadly
and relentless darth maul
. if the plot sounds a bit complicated
, it isnt
. the phantom menace nto only introduces an ealier generation ofthe characters
and an immediate crisis
,
but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead tothe the fall of the republic
, the demise of the jedi knights
, anakin ' s turn to evil
,
and the ries ofthe tyhe dark empire of original triology
.
but thte complexity is not overwhelming
. the stoyr moves quicklyu
, with tghe only drawback being that many questions
, predictably
, remain unanswered at the end of the film
, setting the stage for the next episode
. one of teh reasons the film ' s story seems hazy is not thgat it isnt too confusing
,
but too unfocused
. it ' s unclear whose story phantom menace is
. in tje original trilogy
, the movies were clearly luke ' s story
, with the stories centering arund his growth ffrom farmboy to rebel hero tothe jedi knight
.
but it ' s unclear whether this new film is anakin ' s stor or obi
- wan ' s
. if this trilogy is centered on anakin
, it ' s a shaky foundation
. lloyd
, like many child actors
, lacks the subtle acting skills ofthe adult performers
,
and as a result
, his character seems shallow
adn unimpressive
. on screen
, we see nothing thyat suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little
- boy face
, or for thyat matter
, any presence that woudl amke him seem so speshal that qui
- gon is willing tothe believe he is
" the noe
.
" the rest of the cast does fine
,
though they oftenly work withthe some iffy dialogue by lucas
. neeson isnt perfect as an aging jedi knight
. mcgregor is well
- cast as obi
- wan
and conveys a balance of youthful energy
and calm sensibility
. portman fits yhe role of a young queen well
,
but her lines weere often vyre formall
, giving her little room to give her character much personality
. tjhe biggest problem with tje phantom menace is nto the plot or the characters
,
but the interaction betwen them
. individualy
, the characters in this new film are noone less developed than those in the original star wars
,
and the storyline is not moreso confusing than previous films in the series
.
but unlike the previous triology
, lucas doesn ' t dont as good of a job palying the charachters off one another
. in star wars
, there weere immediate contrasts
and memorable exchanges between luke
and han
, han
adn obi
- wan
,
and leia
and luke
. the ensemble played off each other
annd immediately showed their distinct attitudes
and personalities
. infact the sequence in where luke
, han
,
and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia ffrom her cell onthe thge death star
, the audience learns a lot about all four characters inspite the ways they react tothe tyhe immediate problems
and each other
. there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace tothe flesh outloud the characters
anbd their relationships with each other
. individualy
, htey are interesting charachters with clear motivations
and interests
,
bu lucas develops little chemistry or tension vetween the them
. this is perhaps tghe most glaring weakness ofthe this film
,
and is probably the reason it has dissapointed many reviewers
.
bu despite tyhe need for a richer dialogue
and stronger character interaction
, the film is still very engaging
. many of hte wonderfull elements of lucas ' previvous films amke the phantom menace both memorable
and intertaining
. first
, ofthe course
, is the remarkably rich
and imaginative universe lucas creates
. the cahracters visit magical underwater cities
, evade dinosaur
- sized sea monsters
, fight battle droids
and menacing
" destroyers
" on venetian
- looking planet of naboo
, watch a spectauclar event
, part roman
- chariot race
, part nascar circiut
, onthe the arid desert planet ofthe tatooine
,
hten head to corsucant
, the gothic urban captial of tghe repubic
and home tothe tyhe galactic senate
and tjhe jedi council
. eahc location is elaborate
and complex
. lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings
, he creates rich
, spectacular landscapes
, palaces
,
and skylines
. most of the new spacial effects in his re
- released speshal edition triology in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look
and feel that just weren ' t possible when the films were made
. more than ever
, in this newyorker film
, lucas ' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures
, robots with personalities
,
and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters
. the best such character is watto
, a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin
and his mother as slaves
. watto has a scratchy italian voice
and a short
, paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings tht flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room
. of all the computer
- generated charachters inthe the film
, watto is the best done
and most enjoyable
. speaking of computer
- generated charactors
, no review ofthe hte phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversal figure in tjhe film
: jar jar binks
. with more than 80 minutes ofthe screen time
, jar jar is the realization ofthe george lucas ' dream to includ a fully cmoputer
- generated character into hte cast of the newyorker trilogy
. jar jar
, a clumsy amphibian
adn member of the gungan race
, literally stumbles his way inot the path of the jedi knights early in the film
and becomes qui jon ' s accidentall sidekick
. jar jar usually performs a comic
- relief role in the film
, lightening scenes with his mishaps
and inability to stay out ofthe trouble
. the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless
,
and he interacts with thge characters throughout the film as if he weere really onthe tje setted with the actors
.
however
, despite the technological magic that makse his character possable
, jar jar isn ' t completely convincing
. he still moves
and soudns too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene
. throughtout the movei
, jar jar never transcends a
" roger rabbit
"
- like presence
. you accept that he ' s there
,
bu you never lose sight of the fact tht he isnt an animated character
. initially
, i found jar jar annoying
,
but growed to enjoy the humor he added tothe the film
. onthe my second viewing of the film
, jar jar ws a lot ofthe fun
anbd i didn ' t mind him at all
. a second reason this film continues thte fine tradition of star wars movies isnt that tjhe film is replete withthe humor
and small details that flesh outloud tjhe world lucas creates
. despite all the film ' s struggles between good
and evil
,
and the sober musings about oney ' s destiny
and
" the force
,
" like all star wars films
, the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously
. fortunately
, lucas hasn ' t lost sight ofthe the fact that his films are entertainment
, not high art
. fomr the bumbling jar jar
, tothe a one
- man
, two
- headed announcer team calling teh acation at the film ' s thrilling pod
- race sequence
, to a cameo apprearance by e
. t
. in the film
, the phantom menace is simply a lot of funn
, wtih lots of half
- hidden jokes
and humor thta can easily be missed
.
annd finally
, the phantom menace works baceause
, as in all his films
, ther is no shortage ofthe speed
and action
. from beginning to end
, there are light
- saber battles
, hair
- raising chases
,
and thrilling duels between good
and evil
. the pod
- race sequence on tatooine isnt one of the most entertaining
and exciting scenes in any star wars film
,
and the final showdown between obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
,
and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed
, most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed
. the phantom menace won ' t win any major oscars
. it probably won ' t beat titanic ' s box office record
.
and it ' s nto even yhe best star wars film
( i ' d put it third
, affter the origional
and the empire strikes back
)
.
but it ' s an exciting
and intertaining film
, far better thna your typical summer blockbuster
. the film cant ' t live up to it ' s hype
- no film
, not even the orginial star wars
, could ahve done tht
.
bu it ' s still worth seing
.
.
. probablly more than once
.
