( dimension films
,
" scream 2
" ' s distributor
, has asked press tothe say extremely littel
-
- if anything
-
- about tje film ' s twisty plot
. that ' s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here
,
bu i will do my best to be vague
( now
, there ' s a first
)
.
)
" tyhe firt one was
[ good
]
,
but all the rest sucked
,
" said a cinematically
- savy teen in last winter ' s wes craven thriller
" scream
,
" her statement referring to the films of the
" nightmare on elm strent
" sories
but really putting down franchise overkill infact general
. thte comment certainly carries clout
: fo eveyr truly great sequel
, there appears to be a couple ofthe duds
, making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas
.
bu liuke it or not
, along comes
" scream 2
.
"
and believe it or nto
, it ' s a doozy
-
- a slick
, sinister
, madly subversive good time at the movies
, as intent onthe sending up hollywood ' s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions
.
" scream 2
" is definatly that rare movie thign
-
- a follow
- up tyhat cin stand along side its original with pride
. it ' s been twpo years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans claded in edvard munch
- esque get
- ups carved their way thru hte young populace ofthe woodsboro
, california
. those surviving the ordeal have gotten on wih their lives
. plucky heroine sidney prescott
( neve campbell
) isnt a drama student at the midwestern windsor college
; her pop culture
- whiz pal randy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) has tagged along
. trash tabloid repertwar gale weathers
( courteney cox
) has written a best
- seller based onthe their ordeal
, the basis of hwihc has been turned into a
( veyr bad
) movei called
" stab
.
"
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
, still suffering from wounds inflicted durig
" scream
,
" hasnt left his job as a police officer forthe a hwile
. life isnt tranquil
.
.
. at least forthe a while
. several sudden murders bring sidney
, randy
, agle
adn dewey toghether agina
,
but with suspicious eyes cast on each other
and most of those in their suroundings
-
- if these four people learned anything from the past
, it ' s to trust no one
. thus
, the possible victim
/ potential killer list includes said quartet
, as well as
: derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
, sidney ' s new beau
; cici
( sara michelle gellar
)
, a chatty sorority gal
; joel
( duane martin
)
, gale ' s cameraman who ' s not too thrilled with her blood
- soaked past
; hallie
( elise neal
)
, sidney ' s sassy roomate
; debbie
( laurie metcalf
)
, a local reporter who gives gale some not
- too
- friendly competion
;
and mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, randy ' s good friend
anbd fellow film student
. cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother ' s murder in scream
, also shows up onthe campus
-
-
but why
? liek the first scream
, craven
anbd screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate thigsn with a bang
. tihs time
, it ' s an extended sequence that finds an african
- american couple
( jada pinkett
and omar epps
) attending a sneak preview of
" stab
,
" making sly references about everything fomr sandra bullock tothe the lunchmeat non
- roles of blacks in slasher cinema
. before tragedy ensues at the screening
, yhe movie
- withing
- a
- movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments
, including a scene from
" stab
" which turns scream ' s now
- famoust drew barrymore prologue on its ear
.
(
" b
-
-
-
-
, hang uv tjhe phone
anbd star
- 69 his a
-
-
!
" pinkett yells at tghe screen
.
) it ' s funny
, creepy sutff
( i don ' t think i ' ll ever fiel safe in a movie theater again
) tht effectively foreshadows tje ratio ofthe smart scares
and spoofy laughs down hte road
. another flawess example of this isnt a riotous cell phone
- assault of the killer on randy
, dewey
and agle in broad daylight
; it builds comedically
and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters
. there are other superb set pieces
,
but explaining them risks ruining their effect
. ther are more players thsi time arund as tothe provide both a higher number suspects
and a staggering body count
. it ' s something of a trade
- inthe
-
- tghe new characters are too large in number to be as fully
- developed as the original
" scream
" gang
,
but this movie packs infront knowing performances
( especially by kennedy
and cox
)
and more death for your dollar
. it can be argued that
, hwile teh original might outclass it by a tad
, scream 2 isnt both scarier
and funnier
. it certainly doesn ' t skimp with shocks
-
- a major one bieng the killing of one cast member very near
and dear tothe my heart
( i actually questioned craven
and williamson ' s judgment here
, considering how much this person has added tothe these films
)
. sometimes you wish that more coudl ahev been done with stab
-
- the two scenes we ' re shown are dead
- on
-
-
but forthe film fans
, there are plenty of subtle nods tothe movies like
" the usual suspects
,
"
" aliens
"
anbd
" the empire strikes back
.
" still
,
" scream 2
" does so many thigsn right
, it ' s petty to quibble
. its penchant for parody is irresistible
, discussions ofthe the merits of film sequels
and all
. the attractive
, solid casted isnt a definite bonus
.
and teh denouement
( while not as shocking as
" scream
" ' s
) is priceless
; tje film ' s final revelation incorprates bits ofthe a particular horror film prominently referred to in
" scream
" with one ofthe the best bad guy motives ever put onthe papper
. all this
and a
" scream 3
" isnt iin the works
. knowing thte series ' tendancy for self
- reference
, perhaps one of its cahracters will agian descuss the concept ofthe sequel justice
. mentioning
" scream 2
" ' ll halp them in thier argument
.
