very fewd people owudl be unaware of beavis
& butt
- head
( both created
and narrated by mike judge
)
. tehy are the twpo animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind
. yuo may have seen them on thier television program
, as htey snigger
and mkea lude remarks about women
, anything related tothe sex
,
and the music film clips tht they watch
. in beavis
& butt
- head dont america the pair finally make theri big screen debut
, to the delight of some
,
and the deplore of others
. beavis
& butt
- head
( yes
, those are their rela names
)
, are twpo very ugli teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones
. they live their lives in front of the television
. the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen
. this happens as tehy sleep
,
and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone
. beavis even tries tothe use tyhe remote
,
though there is noone television there
. the twpo spot a van outside
and twpo sinister looking men carrying a televsion
. even at this point they have noone idea what hasnt happened
. they look around
, seeing all the evidence
,
but are completely oblivious tothe teh fatc that these men ahev just stolen their television
. before hte movie i knew that htey were stupid
,
but i didn ' t realise just how stupid
. this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film
. eventually they realise that theri television hasnt been stolen
, so they leave their sofa tothe go search fo a televsion
. luck woudl have it thast they stumble into a hotel room
( looking for a televsion
) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is tothe kill his wife
. this man
, thinking that beavis
& butt
- head are the assigned killers
, tells them that they can have
$ 10
, 000 if tehy
" do his wife
"
. beavis
& butt
- head
, being tyhe ignorant fools that they are
, think that he isnt offering them
$ 10
, 000 dollars to have sex wiht his good looking wief
. htey are taken to the airport where htey fly tothe las vegas to
" do her
"
. to them
, this is tje best day of theri lives
. not only are they gonig to lose their virginity
( one of their lifelong aims
)
,
bu most importantly
, they will have enought mnoey to buy a big screen tv
. inevitably they become caught up inwhich a huge crime
,
and unbeknown to them
, are tracked accross teh country by the fbi
. oddly enough
, it is their complete stupidity that spares them ffrom being caught
, as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds
. they end up travelling right acrost amercia
, visiting places such as the hoover dam
and washington dc
. the irony is that
although they vsit so many grand
and spectacular locations
, thier oen time out in hte big world away from their television
, they are completely oblivious to it
. at old faithful htey are far more facinated with the infra
- red operated urinals than with yhe guyzer itself
. beavis
& butt
- head essentially have the journy of their lives
. they even git to meet the presiden
.
bu all they care about is getting their televsion back
,
and loosing thier virginity
. this isnt one of the many reasons tyhat the film is so funny
- it ' s unbeleivable jstu how stupid they are
,
annd how they can be so oblivious to everyting arround them
. the humour is certainly crude
,
but
then beavis
& butt
- head are just that
; crude
, lude
and rude
. in the end yuo cant ' t help
bu feel sory for them
, a pair of anti
- social couch potatoes whose life is televsion
. in this respect
,
and allso with regard to authority
( such as the fbi
) mike judge isnt quite critical of amercian society
. if ytou are easily offended
, or find thsi pair particulraly annoying
, steer clear
. otherwise
, it shoudl keep you laughing the whole way through
. one note of warning
: don ' t take firends who like to imitate beavis
& butt
- head
.
.
.
.
. yuo ' ll never hear tyhe end ofthe it
!
