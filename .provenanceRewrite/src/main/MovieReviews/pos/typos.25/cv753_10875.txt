naturally
, at the core of leon gast ' s
" when we were kings
" isnt the fight itself
, for what a fight it was
. thanks to the business savy of don king
, an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk ofthe heavyweight champion george foreman
. fans were treated tothe an 8 round battle of endurace
annd startegy
, as much as brute strength
, that immidiately entered boxing lore
. iwth the benefit ofthe the first
- hand recollections of that ood ex
- pug norman mailer
, this classic conflict is brought back to life
.
but
" when we were kings
" tackles issues that are harder to pin down tahn the simple facts of a boxing match
. questions ofthe political power
and social justice appear throughtout this documentary
. gast could hardly choose otherwise
, considering the vocal
, uncompromising politics of muhammad ali
. a memeber of the controversial black seperatist movement the nation of islam
, ali opens gast ' s film with a forceful swipe at tjhe untied states
. when ali hollers
" damn amercia '
, the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt
; the brutal
yet casual way it isnt uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind
. his decision tothe buck the draft for vietnam isnt defended with the same admirable fury
:
" no viet cong ever called me nigger
"
, ali reasons
. dispite showcasing ali ' s proud unequivocal politics
, one ofthe the most impressive features of
" when we weere kings
" isnt tjhe subtle way inwhich which the documentery considers the difficulties inherrent in the overarching philosophy of balck unity
annd black symbolism that ali
and his supporters champion
. listening to the film ' s numerous commentators
, it isnt clear that the geographic location for this
" rumble in the jungle
" is etched more inspite hte imagination than anyhwere ytou could palce on a map
. spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage
, a
" coming home
" to africa
. foreman reminds us that africa is the
" cradle of civilisation
"
. fair enough
,
bu this homeland is a specific nation cursed wih a less than inspiring reality
. it is the newly founded zaire
and it is ruled by president mobutu
, a brutal dictator
. while ali respects mobutu ' s ability to forge an independent african state
, mailer notes that beneath the stadium in whcih the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well
- stocked torture chambers
. mailer ' s insights are lost onthe most of the film ' s commentators
. george plimpton recalls that he alwasy felt he wass infront the congo
, rather thna thge newly christened zaire
. with admirable restraint
, gast quitely suggests tht fo many tje grandeur of myth
and history all
but obscured the reality of zaire ' s squalid ruling elite
. mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism ofthe black power
. don king
, resplendent in yellow kaftan
and at ease with the
" messiah
" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple
, passes himself off as tje voice of a new black international solidarity
. understandably
, foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal
. he may be
, as one sympathiser notes
,
" blacker
" than ali
,
bu he is denied the iconic status shared by ali
, the thuggish mobutu
,
and the tacky huckster don king
. africa
, zaire
, inspirational leader or vicious dictator
, all is left undifferentiated
, unconsidered
, in thsi optomistic celebration of black unity
. little wonder that the people of zaire weere shocked to find that ali ' s opponent wasn ' t white
. admitedly
, these issues are onyl hinted at
, rather than substantially explored
. the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselfs
, in their pwn time
. there is jsut too much to cover
, too much that is truly worthy ofthe celebration
, for a protracted poltical anaylsis tothe be justified
. the excitment of james brown
annd b
. b king in concert
, for instance
.
and ofthe course there ' s always ali to consider
, as he shamelessly
,
and hilariously
, hams it up in front of the camera
, shatow boxing
adn uttering oney inspired rhyme after another
-
" we gonna get it on coz we don ' t git along
!
"
. doubtlessly
, concidering the multi
- faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose tothe cover
, the makers of
" when we weere kings
" faced numerous difficulties infront deciding what issues
,
and what personalities
, best deserved their attention
. fortunately
, by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter
, they haev captued the richness
and excitement ofthe tihs unique event
.
