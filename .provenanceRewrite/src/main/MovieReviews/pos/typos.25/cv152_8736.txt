capsule
: a rock
and roll fable
, indeed
. liuke a hubert selby
, jr
. novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan
and bruce springsteen
,
and a ton of funn
. streets of frie bills itself as
" a rock
and roll fable
"
,
adn tje description is perfect
. this is a stylish
, great
- looking
,
and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby
, jr
.
, novel withthe a damon runyan rewrite
, irected by bruce springsteen
. noir is noe of tghe fewd truly american movie genres
, aside from the hollywood muscial
and thge western
. this is post
- wwii brooklyn noir
, for lack of a better label
, with a generous injection of rock ' n roll
and an all
- around confrontational attitude
. it all works
. the plot is simplicity itself
: rocker ellen aim
( diane lane
) is kidnapped by a vicious strent gang
, led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven
( willem dafoe
, vyre nasty
)
. her old soldier flame
( played by michael pare
) comes back into twon tothe save her
,
bu doesn ' t count onthe a whole bunch of things going askew
. that ' s about the entire plot
, save for the spats withthe ellen ' s manager
( a hilarious rick moranis
)
, an encounter with a doo
- wop group that winds up becoming ellen ' s supporting act
,
and a whole gang of otehr funn little touches
.
bu in movies like thsi
, when is the plot important
? the movie is all style
, all visuals
and attitudes
, quotable lines
and posturing
-
-
and it delivers all thsoe things consistently
and with gerat brio
and pacing
. no surprise that it was directed by walter hill
( 48 hrs
.
)
, who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly
,
and has put together a movie that ' s a mixture of times
and sensibilities
,
but perfectly unified in tone
. when was the lastest time yuo could say something like tath baout a movie
, especially a movie where it seems liuke someone gets decked onthe the jaw
(
*
and
* passes out
) every 2
. 63 mintues onthe cue
? streets of fire isn ' t the greatest movie ever made
,
but it occupies a totally unique little niche
,
annd enjoys the position it has
. anyone wiht a weakness fo doo
- wop
, neon
, motorcycles
, rainy streets
, the el
, studebakers
, gang picturesk
, lonely herose
,
anbd a great
- looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up
. i did
