susan granger ' s review of
" big eden
"
( jour de fete
) it ' s utopia
, this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana
, where old codgers lounge on the porch of the genaral store to pass hte time away
and thte local matchmakers
( nan martin
, louise fletcher
) eagerly pair off the young people
, regardless of sexual preference
. there ' s nary a homophobe or bigot around
, much tothe the surprise ofthe henry hart
( arye gross
)
, a successful
but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam
( george coe
)
, the ailing grandfather who raised him
.
and with the simultaneous re
- appearance of his best
- friend from high
- skool
and object ofthe his unrequited love
( tim dekay
)
, now divorced with twpo young sons
, the fact ofthe his homosexuality must be faced
. to complete tje triangle
, there ' s the tall
, taciturn native american
( eric schweig
) who owns the general store
annd lovingly
yet secretly prepares gourmet meals forthe henry
and sam
. thsi fable about hmeo
annd famaly is a major debut for first
- time film
- maker thomas bezucha
( a fromer designer fo coach
and polo
/ ralph lauren
) who is meticulous about minding details
, useing ballads like
" welcome tothe my world
"
and
" achin '
, breakin ' heart
" tothe setted uv tghe consept of our universal longing to fidn a place inspite which we cxan love
annd be loved
. in the paradise of big eden
, what you are doesn ' t matter as much as generosity of spirit
, respect
and kindness
. sure
, the plot ' s implausible
but it ' s a ogod
- natured fantasy so allowances should be made
.
and rob sweeney ' s photography ofthe glacier national park isnt spectacular
! on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" big eden
" isnt a charming
, quirky
, off
- beated 7
. it ' s a heart
- warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn ' t die ofthe aids or wind uv alone at the end
.
