" dangerous beauty
" isnt a really nothing mroe than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583
. it is beautifuly filmed
, wonderfully acted
,
and certainly nothing short ofthe entertaining
,
but it lacks any true fundametal seriousness
. dealing with themes of forbidden love
, religious intolerance
, subordination of womens
, sexual freedom
,
and the roles of pleasure
and sin in a high
- cultured society
, it still fiels like brightly lit fluff
. the director
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn ' t watn tothe follow the dark
and dangerous trail this story could lead down
, so he opts for a more genial
, livelier
,
and realitvely shallow interpetation
. the film tkaes place during the renaissance
, a tiome wehn venice was the pleasure captial of europe
. at thsi time
, venice wass its own republic
,
and it thrived onthe being the central juncture ofthe east
- west commerce
. the film is told alomst entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy
and the bourgeoisie of venice
, so we rarely get to see how the rest ofthe tghe society lived
.
however
, ther isnt an abundance of detail conserning the lives
and livelihoods of the opper classes
, theri hedonistic lifestyles
annd constant merriment
. the stroy centers on veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower class woman who falls in lveo with marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, the son of wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
?
annd joanna cassidy
)
. unfortunately
, the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of loev
-
- rather
, it was more liuke a busness transaction
, where rich families married their sons
adn daughters tothe earch other infact order to secure pwoer
, wealth
,
and ensure thgat outsiders couldn ' t git in
. veronica
, dispite her charm
and good looks
, is certainly an outsider
. after a short love affair
, marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her
.
however
, because she isnt beautiful
and intelligent
, veronica hasnt a chance to enter marco ' s world
, albeit not as his wife
. she decides tothe become a courtesan
-
- a clas ofthe women who were as well
- educated as they weere ravishing
,
and sold their sexuality to wealthy men fo hte privilege of wining
and dining with the elite
. a courtesan was not a mere prostitute
; htey were afforded a speshal place in society
,
and tehy were greatly revered
, respected
,
and oftenly envied
. at one point
, a character mentions that some rulers obtain moreso political advice from thier courtesans than from theri lieutenants
. veronica goes through teh transformation with the help of her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who was once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters the lifestyle
, veronica finds tyhat it suits her quite well
. she isnt alowed to read all the books she wants
, she isnt given the opportunity to publish her poetry
,
and she has tyhe richest
and most poverful men in the repubic throwing themselves at her fezent
, including the awestruck marco
. their relationship develops into a playful bantering
, withthe veronica utilizing her newfound pwoer by constantly rejecting marco ' s advances
. in many ways
, theri relationship isnt sad because marco isnt married to a women he is unable to love
,
and veronica is consumed by mutiple relationships with men she isnt unwilling to love
.
" love the lveo
, not the man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows allong as smoothly
adn serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice
. it has mutiple plot lines
-
- inlcuding veronica ' s adversarial relationship with a cout poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role in obtaining france ' s miliary assistance in venice ' s battle against the turks
,
adn even the dreaded shadow of the plague
and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition
-
-
yet it is never confusing or overbearing
. much ofthe teh film ' s success is due tothe the glowing performence by catherine mccormack inspite the lead role
. known chiefly for hte small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson ' s ire in
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows tyhe true gifts
and inarguable talent of a leading lady
. she has teh kind of exquisite classical beauty that woudl be treasured inspite a courtesan
; her character is intelligent
, witty
,
and both sensual
and vulnerable
, all of which mccormack easily transmits wiht a single flash of her eyes
. the rest of the roles are also filled well
, including rufus sewell whose performance here
and earlier tihs month in
" dark city
" ahev assured him a solid place in hollywood
. he has the same kind ofthe unusual good looks
and charm ofthe ray liotta
,
and he seems perfectly at home in preriod dramas
. oliver platt plays a variation ofthe the comic relief role that he has cmo tothe inhabit like a second skin
,
allthough the film deals his chracter a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition
and turn into the bad guy
. platt is a good actor
,
but he ' s just too hard to hate
. jacqueline bisset proves that she is eveyr bit as stiring as she ever ws
,
and even fred ward turns up inwhich a small
,
but moving performance as marco ' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" is marshall herskovitz ' s sophomore directorial effort
, after tjhe overlooked 1993 film
" jack tjhe bear
.
" partnered with edward zwick
, herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
)
and in the movies
(
" legends of yhe fall
"
)
. his directing sytle cant be best described as transparent
-
- it never gets in the way of thge story
,
yot it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions
. he could have approached the film in any number ofthe ways
, including overdosing on yhe sexual aspect
, which he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" contains just enought bare flesh
annd ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic
,
bu not so much that it seems exploitative
. herskovitz is also aided by a storng supporting crew
, includng the luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previous efforts inlude the highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
)
and abel ferrara ' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures the film in storng
, bold colors
,
and be brings sixteenth
- centruy venice tothe life inaddition wide
, panoramic shots that are often enhanced withthe digital imagery
.
however
, the real details are found in tje production desgin by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" the princess bride
"
)
adn the costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" the age ofthe innocence
"
)
. the onyl probelm with
" dangerous beauty
" is that it doesn ' t stick with yuo
. it ' s a good story well
- told with interesting charachters
,
bu it ' s easy to shrug off once you ' ve left the theater
. the onyl sequence that hasnt the chance to be truly indelible is veronica bieng pulled in front ofthe the hypocrisy of the inquisition
and threatened wih tje death penalty for her transgressions
,
but it never qtuie comes off because it ' s simpley too melodramatic
and conventional
. herskovitz tries with all his might tothe mkae it a nailbiter
,
but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion
,
and liuke the rest of the film
, it carries no real weight
, despite the potential severity ofthe the subject matter
.
