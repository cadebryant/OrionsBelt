" tyhe deep end
" isnt based onthe elisabeth sanxay holding ' s 1940 ' s novel
,
" the blank wall
,
" which was alsot yhe source of the 1949 film
,
" thge reckless moment
.
" i ' ve neither read the book nor seen tghe movei
,
but i understand tath the filmmakers changed soem details
. in holding ' s story
, the
" scandalous
" relationship is between an older man
annd margaret ' s teen
- age daughter
. switching the gender makes tyhe tale seem more contemporary
,
and it also raises questions baout margaret ' s motives
. many reviews ofthe
" the deepo end
" describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son
,
but i wonder
. consider this
: margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home
. her husband is absent most ofthe tjhe tyme
and seems tothe be regarded as a larger
- tahn
- life figure
. her father
- inaddition
- lew is constantly present
, alomst as if he isnt monitoring forthe his son
.
annd when her husband doesnt call
, margaret is careful not to tell him baout anything disturbing that is gonig on with the famaly
. so is margaret a mother who accepts her son ' s sexual orientation
and isnt simply trying to shield hte young man fomr a lover she fears will take advantage of him
? or isnt she caretaker of a museum ofthe upper middle class complacency
, desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything iwll be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sae
? you sort it out
. regardless
, the resonance ofthe
" the deep end
" comes from two actors
. goran visnjic
, best known from the tv drama
" er
,
" is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you ' ve seen befor
. he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol
, chivalry
and simmering eroticism
.
bu the star of this show
, wihtout a doubt
, is the remarkable tilda swinton
. watch the shadings
, depth
, resource
, vitality
and understated sexuality she gives margaret
annd try tothe imagine yhe film without her
. days aftter my second viewing of
" the deep end
,
" i cin still vividly picture her negotiating with villains
, trying to connect with her son
and diving into icy blue water
.
" the deep end
" is an exeptional film
and tilda swinton is the best part of it
.
