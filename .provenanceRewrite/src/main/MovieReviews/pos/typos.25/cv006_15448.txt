apparently
, director tony kaye had a major battle whith new line regarding his new film
, american history x
. i don ' t konw teh details ofthe the fight
,
but it seems that he isnt not happy with the fianl product
,
and nearly removed his name from thte credits altogether
. i ' ve heared about thsi kind of thing hapening before
,
and it mkaes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce
. as it is
, i found american hitory x tothe be an extremely good film
, nto just because of tony kaye ' s focused look at hte touchy subject of racism
,
but because of a powerful
, charismatic peformance from edward norton
. it ' s hard to believe that it hasnt only been twpo years usance norton ' s fantastic role iin primal fear
,
but
, here he is nowe
, starring in his own film
anbd making hismelf a star
. norton is one of those performers who becomes his character
,
and his work infact american histor x is oney of the very best performances thsi year
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living in venice beach wtih his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d ' angelo
)
,
anbd sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. the film opens with a flashback
, in which derek brutally kills two balck men vandalizing his car
. we find out that this lands him in prison
,
and the film from that point is seen through the eyes ofthe danny
. in the presnet
- tiem of the film
, danny is in high school
,
and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother
. much of the film is told inthe flashback
,
adn we see the path that leads to derek ' s adoption of white supremacy
. when derek is released
, haveing served three years in prison
, he finds that his brother is now a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
,
however
, hasnt given up thge violence
,
and tries to get his brother to understand why racism
and hte violence tyhat comes iwth it are bad things
. what makes this all intresting is that these two young men are not stupid
, thoughtless people
-
- they are intelligent
and articulate
,
and voice theri belives infact disturbingly straightforward terms
. it ' s hard to make a controversial movie
and nto preach
,
but kaye has found the right note for his material
. beacuse american history x isnt a mainstream film
, htere has tothe be a redemption phase for our main character
-
- some people may think that this is teh only way tothe make him sympathetic
. i partially disagree with this
, because
,
although i dont not advocate racism inaddition any way
, it ' s interesting the way kaye presents derek
-
- he is a loud
, obnoxious man
,
but he ' s also very smart
. the reasons forthe why he becomes a skinhead are believeable
-
- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men
. it ' s clear that he ' s passionate about his beliefs
,
and that he ' s not just a punk looking fo an excuse to beat peple uv
. ofthe course
, it helps tht kaye hasnt an actor as talented as norton to play this part
. it ' s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head
and a swastika on his chest
. in addition tothe getting the look just right
, he ' s perfect for this role
-
- derek requires intelligence
, depth
,
adn a whole lot of shouting
,
and norton does it all with ease
. even when he ' s at his meanest
, derek has a likable quality tothe him
,
and that ' s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead
. what adds depth tothe the story is a subplot inthe which the principal of danny ' s school
( avery brooks
) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny
. thte other performances are all terrific
, wih standouts from furlong
, d ' angelo
,
and lien
. visually
, tjhe film is very poweful
. kaye indulges inwhich a lot ofthe interesting artistic choices
,
and most of them work nicely
-
- lots of slow
- motion
and strange camera angles add to a moody atomsphere
.
bu
, like a lot of movies lately
, american history x skims past greatness in the lastr few minutes
.
although thge climactic scene is very moving
, the picture ends with a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed
. for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point
, it felt liek a slap in the face tothe be hand
- fed a theme in such a simplistic way
. it makes me wonder what
, exactlly
, tony kaye disliked about tghe final version of his film
. perheaps this last scene was tghe problem
. it ' s hard tothe imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good
-
- in a time when so many movies are timid
anbd weak
, american history x manages to mkae a compelling argument for racism wihtout advocating it any way
.
