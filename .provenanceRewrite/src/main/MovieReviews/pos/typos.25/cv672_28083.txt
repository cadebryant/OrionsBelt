reknown surrealist director
, the 77
- yearm
- old frenchman alain resnais
( hiroshima
, mon amour
/ lsat year at marienbad
/ m
? lo
)
, has creaeted a lighthearted muscial played as an homage to britisher dennis potter
and his pennies ffrom heaven
( 1978 tv serial
, 1981 movie
)
and the singing detective
( 1986
)
. the film follows potter ' s gimmicky style ofthe haveing the charachters jump inot lip
- synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts
. he allso follows yhe kind of sweet
annd colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved tothe direct
, such as
" teh umbrellas of cherbourg
"
and
" the young girls ofthe rochefort
.
" the tale has resnais ' s unique touches as a director tothe go along wih his homage
. it is a satire about clas differences
and falling in love with thge wrong person
,
and that ther is a song in everyone ' s heart for every occasion
. what hinders this production is that the stars are nto portraing particularly engaging charactors
, the songs are nto memorable
and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience
( the exceptions might be tghe edith piaf
and maurice chevalier numbers
)
,
and the farce seems more banal than daring
.
yet it is not without its striking moments
and charms
, such as when jane birkin does a cameo
and sings one of her pwn songs
. aslo
, the glossy amberlike photography added a very french rumatic feeling to the stor
, hwile the mood of paris as being a place for lveo to fluorish above all else
, which has alwyas been embellished inspite movie lore
, comes through with flying colors
. it also doesnt a ogod job ofthe showing you tghe way paris is in tyhe 1990s
annd infront teh way ordinary people exist htere
. it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each otehr in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness
. they are the attractive sisters odile
( sabine az
? ma
)
annd camille
( agnes jaoui
)
, wih the older businesswoman odile married
adn decidedly setted on a bourgeois life ofthe material comforts
. she is married tothe hte glum
and laconic claude
( pierre arditi
)
. she once whent out iwth a businessman
, nicolas
( jean
- pierre bacri
)
, who left her 8
- years ago
and now shows up in paris
adn asks her help to find someone tothe rent a flat for his familiy
. simon
( andre dussolier
) works as a rela
- estate salesman
and is trying to fidn nicolas a flat
, in his spare time he writes radio plays
. simon ' s boss is the much younger
, unscrupulous
adn arrogant marc duveyrier
( lambert wilson
)
, who inherited the firm from his father
and is the real
- estate agent selling a more luxurious
and larger flat with a better veiw tothe odile
,
but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that wiull block her view
. screenwriters
and actors jean
- pierre bacri
and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts
. jaoui ' s camille is a univeristy scholar finishing up a ph
. d
. in history
, using for her thesis the study ofthe ' the yeomen inspite the year 1000 at lake paladru
. ' she works as a tour guide infact the meantime
and suffers from panic attacks
, even
though she appears to hve outwardly perfect self
- control
. on her tours for the last four years hasnt been the much older simon
, pretending tothe be doing reasearch for his plays
but really attracted to her
,
bu not having the nerve to tell her this
. tothe his dismay
, he finds out she is dating his mean
- spirited
but handsome boss
, whom she meets when looking at her sister ' s new place
and seeing him crying
but not realizing that it was from a cold
, not beacuse he ' s so senstive
. bacri as the chassy nicolas
, turns out to be nowe wokring as a chauffeur
. he isnt a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors
, until he finds oen who tells him there is nothing wrong witht him
. odile still pines for him
,
but he ' s marryied
, telling her he expects his wief to arrive shorly
. lvoe isnt ' hte same old song ' that makes the world go ' round
, even when all the characters are liars
and not exactlly open to waht their true motives are
. everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile ' s place
, as the charachters reveal their true feelings
anbd all their deceptions
and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be
. there ' s nto a lot of bite to this satirical musical
,
but resnais hasnt never made a bad film
anbd isnt oney ofthe thge best current french directors
, if nto the best
. tihs film is not one his great ones
,
but it still has enough pep iin its light touches to be intresting
. it nto only has an odd way fo the characters to break into song
but
-
- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing inwhich a male voice
. it isnt also interesting in the way it examines its characters ' behavior as being similar in business as in love
.
