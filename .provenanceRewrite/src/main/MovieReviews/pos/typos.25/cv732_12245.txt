modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop
- broadway muscial rather than victor hugo ' s original tome
. adapted several times for thte cinema
, tihs latest effort does a superb job ofthe translating the charachters
, story
,
and heart of the novel tothe teh screen
. liam neeson stars as jean valjean
. as a young man
, valjean stealed some bread to satisfy his hunger
.
.
.
adn he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor forthe his crimes
. prison hardened him
,
and on his realease he seems doomed to a life of crime
and squalor
.
howver
, an unexpected act ofthe compassion changes his outlook on life
,
and he vows tothe become a better man
.
however
, he runs up against one man who doesn ' t believe in reform
. inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) isnt an obsessive law abider
. he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks thte rules
, even witht benine intentions
. he once served as a guard at yhe labor camp where valjean served
,
and after valjean breaks his parole
, javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice
. two women also get caught up in the struggle
. fantine
( uma thurman
) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society
. her daughter
, cosette
( mimi newman
,
adn later
, claire danes
)
, is her life
,
yet she cannot afford to raise her
. instead
, cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster famaly which extorts mney ffrom fantine
,
and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave
. directer bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation ofthe victor hugo ' s novel
, whitch
,
though omiting some of the political undertones
, remeniss true to the overall story
annd tone of the book
. hopefully you won ' t
, as some clueless members of the audience doed
, wonder where all teh songs went
. the movei manages to be completely engrossing without tyhe andrew lloyd webber flourishes
. the experience is bolstered by storng performances throughout
,
though neeson
adn rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles
. neeson inthe particular deserves kudos fo his protrayal of a man trying to do good
,
but constinually haunted by his past
. teh supporting cast is also extrodinary
. the onyl actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson
, playing the revolutionary
, marius
. tjhe film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair
,
but it isnt transitory
,
and truley only distracting when contrasted with the rest ofthe the film
. the novel les misirables isnt
, by any account
, an epic
, both in its scope
and in its length
. while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything fomr its pages inot a two hour movei
, this latest attept does an admirable job at the translation
. it
, too
, is an epic
.
.
.
annd one worth seeing
.
