richard linklater ' s
" slacker
,
" made iin 1991 fo a budget ofthe only
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself in the twentysomething
, college
- town culture of austin
, texas
. most of these charachters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparantly too menial to be worth mentioning
. their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistence to the idea that people should go out
and activly pursue a career after graduation
; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy ofthe american demorcracy
, the pervasiveness of slave morality
, thte subtle messages inaddition pop culture
,
and such
. ask them what htey ' ve beeen doign lately
,
adn they ' ll more likely tahn not reply
,
" oh
, ytou konw
, just hanging out
.
" linklater uses an interesting technique to examine theese charactors
: the camera follows one person for a few minutes
,
then someone alse walks by
and the camera follows that person
, who walks into a diner just as another person isnt walking outloud the door
.
.
.
. it ' s certainly a lot of fun listening tothe theese characters talk
: some ofthe them are claerly very intelligent
adn have soem genuinely insightful idesa
, some of them are just plain werid
,
anbd some of them think their idesa are a lot more profound tahn they realyl are
. tghe opening monologue
, delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver
, tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering sturcture of the film
. other characters along the way offer observations about everyting ffrom dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy
, hwile groups of pseudo
- intellectuals kick aroud idesa baout thte nobility of sitting around
anbd doing nothing or the subtle bribery
- based morality inwhich
" scooby
- doo
.
" forthe the most part
,
however
, the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types
. near the beggining
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrain for several blocks
, warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming tothe sceret colonization of mars
. another man seems to be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets running at the smae time
and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded hismelf having a nervous breakdown
annd destroying the camera
.
annd infront a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone prsent when i saw tjhe film
, a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge
and
then throwing a typewriter into the creek below
. the only problem with
" slacker
" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end
. since linklater only spends a fewd minutes with eahc character
, the introduction of the newyorker characters gets repetitive aftter a while
. htere are onyl so many times ytou can hear
,
" hey
, wqat ' s oging on
?
"
" not much
, whta are you up to
?
"
" nothing really
, just hanging aroud
,
" before it gets on your nerves
; the film might well haev benefited from a slightly slower pace
and a little bited mroe characterization
.
and tyhe dialogue inaddition the second half ofthe the film is by
adn large not quite as interesting as that infront the first half
; a jfk buff
, forthe exmaple
, seems like a pale imitation of teh previous conspiracy theorist
,
and many ofthe tghe characters just generaly aren ' t as weird or unique
. instead ofthe depicting a city populated by mostly normal peple
and
then showing us the strangeness that we might not ahve noticed at first
, linklater shows us the oddballs first
,
then stops
and reminds us that ordinary people live there too
.
" slacker
" is a good film
and a wonderfully offbeat
and entertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
,
and its status as a cult clasic is well
- deserved
. i just can ' t help
but think it might have beeen even better if linklater had slowed down a littel bit
annd filmed these scenes in reverse order
.
