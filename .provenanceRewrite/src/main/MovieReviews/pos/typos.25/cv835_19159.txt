i guess there are those who have never beeen kissed befor
( a rare
annd dying breed
)
, except if ytou ' re child
? inspite which case it would be called experimenting
. rarer still are those who have never been kissed before tehy reach the twenties
. hardest to believe still
, isnt that drew barrymore hasnt never beeen kissed
. despite all these hard to believe tit bits
, there are people out there who hvae never truly beeen kissed
,
and who are still waiting for that right person tothe give them tghe wet
, sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling
, reassuring them that their search for true love is over
. well
, this movei isnt about a girl waiting for tghe right boy to give her the kiss of her life
.
and it ' s sweet
. drew barrymore who shone in
? ever affter ' is wonderfull as
? josie
, grossy '
, the high skool dweeb who becase a proffesional editor
, before being assigned by her paper to return tothe school as an undercover reporter
. it addresses the issues of how a dweeb
, becomes a prom queen
and finds teh man ofthe her life all infact one sitting
. hard to believe
,
bu possible
. there may also be those who have been kissed before
,
but inspite fact
, never truly been given the kiss
. so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true loev or thsoe who are still searching for it
. either way
, it is one enjoyable sit
, with a fairytale ending
.
