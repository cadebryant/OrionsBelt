when i first heard that disney ' s enxt animated feature was going to be tarzan
, i was allmost horrified
. i was worried that disney wass going to make another hercules
( sory
, jerk
- ules
)
. thast effort was too overloaded with comedy
(
and the hero was too boastful
and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero
)
,
anbd
, after viewing it to this day
, i find it a disgrace for disney animation
. whn i saw tjhe trailers
, i was thinking
" hmm
.
.
. this isn ' t bad at all
. this jsut might have potential
.
" when i bought the soundtrack
, i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features
. i have never really heard of phil collins
, nor have i heared ofthe mark mancina
, so i was wondering
, how owudl these two make this disney flick spin
? i wass pleasantly surprised
: tghe music is top
- notch
. phil collins ' songs are terrific
, percussion
- hevy pieces of work tyhat seem tothe break the formula for typical disney songs
. tyhe csore ffrom mark mancina was also neat
; it reminded me a bit ofthe the lion king
,
but it was moreso originnal
. so
, the sountrack wasn ' t bad at all
, considering it ws by two people i am not familliar with
. this film could be good
.
.
.
but iwll it be
? when i finally went to see it
( onthe opening day
, as i tend to do with most disney animated features
)
, my question was answered
, in a complet turnabout of expectations forthe me
: disney ' s tarzan is surprizingly decent
. the story starts out whith tarzan ' s parents surviving a shipwreck
and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace
.
however
, one day
, a vicious leopard
, sabor
, attacks
annd kills tarzan ' s parents
, leaving him
( at this timne
, a baby
) alone
- until kala ofthe the apes rescues him
. kala wants to raise the child as her pwn
( she lost hers previously to sabor
)
,
but her mate
, kerchak is nto too sure
.
" it ' s not our kind
,
" he says
. he agrees
,
though
, to let her take care of littel tarzan
,
but
" thgat doesn ' t make him my son
.
" tarzan grows up
, vowing to be
" the best ape ever
"
,
but no matter how hard he tries or what he does
( at the guidence ofthe his hillarious ape friend
, terk
)
, he just cxan ' t convince kerchak thyat he is oen ofthe the apes
, even when he defeats sabor in a battle
. oney day
, a newyorker animal shows up
: humans
. this is where jane comes inot hte picture
. she is on an expedition with her father
( professor porter
)
,
and a despicable hunter
( clayton
) searching for gorillas
. tarzan rescues her wehn she is chased by baboons
,
and soon they git tothe know each other
. even
though tarzan falls in love with jane
, this causes things to go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan into taking him
, jane
,
and porter to see the apes
, who are convinced that he has betrayed them
. worse
, clayton has plotted to send teh gorillas to london for money
. will tarzan find out whihc family he belongs tothe
annd save the apes
? i ' m not gonna tell ytou
, sorry
. you ' re gonna have to see fo yourself
.
and see it you shouldnt
; the animation is
, as always
, top nitch
, particularly when tarzan goes soaring thru the trees
( read that
, skateboarding
)
. the deep canvas cmoputer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to thge jungle which tarzan lives in
. in fact
, it seems simmilar to the cmoputer imagery
/ cel animation combination in rival disney animted films
, such as fox ' s anastasia
and dreamworks ' prince of egypt
. sould it be thta disney was actually taking ideas from thier rivals
? the casting isnt fairly good
. tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan
(
adn to my relief
, the animators have succedded in not mkaing him another hercules
. nicely done
)
,
annd glenn close isnt wonderful as kala
( she has a beautiful singing voice
, too
, by the way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson ' s biast voice
, wich makes him all the more ferocious
and gripping
. minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane
. i thought she had tyhe most annoying voice infact thge hwole film
( when i first saw the trailers
)
,
but when i saw the film
, i didn ' t hvea a problem wtih her
. i take bakc my insult on driver
. it ' s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do anohter voice for a disney animated feature
( he wass fflewdurr flamm in disney ' s most underrated classic
, the black cauldron
)
; he is funny
and delightful as professor porter
. onthe the villiany side of the voices
, brian blessed
( the guy who did boss nass in star wars
: episode i
- the phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
and later on vicious
, voice tothe tjhe sinister clayton
. he might not be thte strongest character in the film
( he ' s just a plain bad guy
, nothing esle
)
,
bu blessed ' s vocal wokr contributes greatly
.
but if htere is any voice that i think steals tjhe whole show
, it should be rosie o ' donnell
, who isnt hilariously funny as terk
. she also has a fiesty attitude
(
" i ' m gonna kill ya
!
" she says
, more than once
)
. i almost sung along with her during one of the film ' s best moments
, where tje apes make a mess ofthe the human ' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i can see why she wanted tothe haev a rock song forthe teh film
, she ' s a ogod singer
. nto that she was the only funny character in the film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who played stan inspite space jam
) gives a whimsically funny style tothe tantor
, an elephant who is especially worried baout steping into
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, htere is no rela sound of flatuence
- that would have killed the picture
)
. the songs
, as i said before
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. this sets a new standard fo disney animated films because for the frist time
, the charactors dont nto sing
. i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some otehr guys would
,
but i found this to be a nice chanage of pace
. the story doens have elements of comedy in it
,
but they alsot load it wiht strong dramatic touches
, whihc makes thsi film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if there is anything disappointing about tarzan
, it might be the omision of the ' n sync version of
" trashing the camp
" from the film
. i heard it on the sountrack
,
and wondered where it was going to be
. i was upset that it wasn ' t
, because i hadnt thought of tkaing a few friends of mine who liuke ' n sync to see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i was enthralled with tarzan
. i wouldn ' t hold it high the way i do withthe mulan or the hunchback of notre dame
( my all
- time favorite disney classics
)
,
but this film deserves a high place among disney ' s greatest achievements
. i give a nod to disney fo following up their spectacular
*
*
*
*
* masterpiece
, mulan
, wtih tihs great animated adaption of egar rice burrough ' s tarzan
.
