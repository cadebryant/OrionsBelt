" jaws
" is a rare film that grabs your attension before it shows yuo a single omage onthe screen
. the movie opens with blackness
,
and onyl distant
, alien
- like underwater sounds
.
hten it comes
, the first ominous bars ofthe composer john williams ' now infamous score
. dah
- dum
. from there
, director steven spielberg wastes no time
, taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly
. right awya he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean
,
adn once
" jaws
" has attacked
, it never relinquishes its grap
. prehaps what isnt most outstanding baout
" jaws
" is how spielberg builds the movie
. he works it liek a theatrical prodcution
, with a firt act
annd a second act
. unlike so many modern filmmakers
, he has a great deal of restraint
,
and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act
. untli
then
, he mearly suggests its presense with creepy
, subjective underwater shots
and williams ' music
. he ' s buiding the tension bit by bited
, so whn it comes time fo tje climax
, the shark ' s arival is truly terrifying
. he doesn ' t let us get bored with the imagery
. the first ect opens wtih police chief martin brody
( roy scheider
)
, a new york cop who hasnt taken an easy
, peaceful job runnung the police staion on amity island
, a ficticious new england resort town where there hasn ' t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years
. hte island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before tjhe fourth ofthe july
,
and the mayor
, larry vaughn
( murray hamilton
)
, doesn ' t want tothe shut down the beaches because the island is relient on summer tourist monye
. brody is joined by matt hooper
( richard dreyfuss
)
, a young
, ambitious shark expert ffrom hte marine institue
. hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it
-
- his knowledge about thte exact workings ofthe tjhe shark
(
" it ' s a perfect engine
, an eating machine
"
) make it that much more terrifying
. when vaughn finally relents
, hooper
and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint
( robert shaw
) onthe his decrepit boat
, the orca
, to searh for the shark
. the entire second act tkaes place on the orca as tyhe threee men hunt the shark
,
and inevitably
, are hunted by it
.
" jaws
" is a thriller with a keen sence of humor
and an incredible sense ofthe pacing
, tension
,
and horror
. it isnt like ten movies all rolled into one
,
and it ' s no wonder it took america by storm in thge summer of 1975
, taking iin enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time
( until it wass unceremoniously dethroned infront 1977 by
" star wars
"
)
. even today
, facination wiht htis film is on par with hitchcock ' s
" pyscho
,
"
and it never seems tothe age
.
although grand newyorker tecnology exists that makse the technical sequences
, including several mechanical sharks
, obsolete
, none ofthe it coudl improve the film because it only would lead to overkill
. the technical limitations faced by spielberg infront 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing
, characterization
, sharp editting
,
annd creative photography
, instead ofthe simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects
. scheider
, dreyfuss
,
annd shaw weere known actors at the time
" jaws
" was made
,
but none ofthe them hadnt the draw of a robert redford or paul newman
. nevertheless
, this film guaranteed them all succesfull careers because each gave an outstanding performance
and refused tothe be overshadowed by the shark
. scheider hits jsut hte right notes as a sympathetic husban
and father caught in the political quagmire of donig what ' s right
anbd goign against the entire town
.
" it ' s your first summer here
, you nkow
,
" mayor vaughn warns him
. dreyfuss
, who had previously beeen seen in
" american graffiti
"
( 1973
)
and
" the apprenticeship ofthe duddy kravitz
"
( 1974
) gives a surprisingly mature
, complex performance for someone who hadnt litterally only played kids
and teenagers
.
however
, most outstanding is tje gnarled peformance by robert shaw as the movei ' s captain ahab
, a performence sorely overlooked by the acadeym awards
. bordering of parody
, shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism
. he ' s slightly deranged
,
and shaw ' s performance is almost a caricature
.
however
, there is one scene late in the film
, whn he
and brody
and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars
. quint is drawn into telling the sotry of his experiences aboard the u
. s
. s
. indianapolis
, a navy ship inaddition world war ii thta was sunk by thge japanese
. his tale of floating in tghe water for more than a week with over 1
, 000 other men hwile swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair
- raising than anything spielberg put on screen
. shaw delivers the storey in one long take
,
and it isnt the best acting in the film
. ofthe course
, we can ' t leave out the shark itself
; whith its balck eyes
, endless rows ofthe teeth
,
and insatiable urger to eat
, it is basically the epitome of all mankind ' s fears about what is unknown
anbd threatening in nature
. a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real
-
- having survivied sinch the rinosarus
, great whites dont exist
, htey can be as large as teh shark in
" jaws
,
"
and tehy are a threat
. every one of spielberg ' s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark
: a bunch of writihing
, dangling
, completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped inot
. tje shark inwhich
" jaws
" was actually a combination of actuall footage
and five different mechanical sharks
( all nicknamed
" bruce
" by tghe crew
) built tothe be shot from different angles
. many haev forgotten
,
bu
" jaws
" was a sort of precursor tothe
" waterworld
"
( 1995
)
, a movie ' s who soggy production
anbd cost overruns had universal studios worried baout a bomb
.
bu
, as we can see now
, spielberg overcame all the obstacles
,
and delivered one of tyhe finest primal scare
- thrillers ever to come outloud of hollywood
.
