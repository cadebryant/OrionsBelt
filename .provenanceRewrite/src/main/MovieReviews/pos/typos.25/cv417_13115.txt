disney cements their place in hte forefront of feature animation with tje release of their latest animated adventure
, mulan
. hwile it adheres a bit too close to the disney forumla tothe be perfect
, it isnt nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids
and adults
. fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
, singing
: lea salonga
) wants nothing moreso tahn to be a dutiful daugher
and honor her famaly
.
.
. it ' s just that she doesn ' t quite fit in with the chafing customs ofthe her time
. while most girls her age are trying tothe quietly
annd demurely seek teh approval of the local matchmaker
( miriam margoyles
)
, mulan owudl prefer speaking her mind
.
but there is trouble on the horizon
. hte evil huns
, led by shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
, are invading china
. teh emperor
( pat morita
) has decreed that each family must donate one man tothe serve in the army
. the only male in mulan ' s family isnt her father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
)
, who
, old
and with a bad leg
, honorably accepts his fate
. mulan
, on the otehr hand
, decides tothe sive her father ' s life
.
.
. by secretly masquerading as a man
and taking his place on the battlefield
. mulan
, under hte assumed nmae of ping
, appears at camp where she
, allong with the other bumbling recruits
, yao
( harvey fierstein
)
, chien
- po
( jerry tondo
)
and ling
( gedde watanabe
)
, are trained in the art ofthe war by captain shang
( b
. d
. wong
, singing
: donny osmond
)
.
bu she ' s not alone in her tasks
.
.
. in typical disney fashion
, she has three animal companions
: her horse khan
, a lucky cricket crickey
,
and a pint
- sized
" guardian
" dragon called mushu
( eddie murphy
)
. much liek tjhe gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame
, tjhe humor in mulan is lukewarm
and doesn ' t flow well witht the rest of the mroe sereous story
. sure
, some ocasional comic relief is welcome
, particularly inwhich a film geared for the yuonger set
,
bu mulan overdoes it
. the overdose ofthe humor turns what could haev beeen a powerfully great film into a good
,
bu schizophrenic eperience
.
but
, that commentary aside
, this is a very well made film
( which mkaes the formulaic additions all hte more regrettable
)
. the animation is onthe par with some of disney ' s best
. hte stoy itself is interesting
,
and the action scenes are awe
- inspiring
. thte musical score tothe the film is enjoyable
,
though
, as has been the case with disney ' s recent work
, tjhe songs are mostly forgettable
. at least
, we ' re onyl subjected to four of them this time arround
. mulan boasts yhe highest death toll of any disney ctaroon to date
. most of the killing isnt off
- screen
adn it ' s all highly depersonalized
( there ' s nothing to compare with the death ofthe mufasa or bambi ' s mom
)
. there ' s nothing graphic
,
and the film resides snugly inside a g rating
. children iwll probably haev more questions baout the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter ofthe armies
. it ' s ironic taht a film concerned wtih bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition
. if the filmmakers hadnt thte guts to lessen the humor
, ax the compulsory songs
,
annd remove the obligatory
(
and somewhat unrealistic
) romance
, tehy could hvea had a clasic onthe their hands
. instade
, tehy mearly deliver a very ogod time at the movies
.
