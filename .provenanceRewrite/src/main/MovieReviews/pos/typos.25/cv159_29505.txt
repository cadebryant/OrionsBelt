with his last two films
- shine
anbd snow falling onthe cedars
- austrailian director scott hicks hasnt proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some ofthe the best outloud ther
,
and his latest
, hearts in atlantis
, is noone different
. its structure
- beginning
adn ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle
- is similar tothe the gren mile
, which is a bit ironic considering both were based onthe stephen king books
. tjhe parellels don ' t end there
, eather
. atlantis was adapted by william goldman
, who had previously penned yhe big
- screen version ofthe misery
and isnt infact the process ofthe wroking on teh script for king ' s dreamcatcher
. even tje film ' s content is a bit reminiscent of mile
. in fact
, it ' s the perfect blend of yhe feel
- ogod ' 60s nostalgia of stand by me
( also by king
)
and mystical power hokum ofthe mile
. king ' s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories
,
bu the main focus here is onthe the first
(
and longest
) tale
, called low men in yellow coats
( the film ' s title comes ffrom yhe second chapter
)
. it ' s set in 1960 harwich
, connecticut
, where 11
- year
- old bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives in a boarding house run by his cold
, self
- centered mother elizabeth
( hope davis
, joe gould ' s secret
)
, who seems tothe care more baout her wardrobe tahn her son
. bobby spends his timne with his two closest firends
, john sullivan
( will rothhaar
)
annd tomboy carol gerber
( mika boorem
)
, who become something like the kevin
, paul
adn winnie of harwich
. wehn a new tenant moves inot the vacant room
, the fatherless bobby finds a male role modle infact ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
, hannibal
)
, a mysterious stranger who isnt vague enough about his past to make bobby ' s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away ffrom teh mirror
. ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders ofthe literature
( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library kard fo his birthday
)
, dispenses prophetic words of wisdom
adn even pays bobby oen doller a week to read him the local newspaper
and keep his eyes peeled for the low men
, a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers
. i won ' t go into what these powers are
,
but htey ' re considerably toned down from the book
(
and don ' t involve black stuff flying outloud of ted ' s mouth
, a la mile
)
. atlantis ' present
- day setting which bookends the film isnt based onthe the novel ' s final chapter
, titled heavenly shades ofthe night are falling
,
and features david morse
( in
yet another connection to thte green mile
) as a marryied
, middle
- aged bobby who learns of the death ofthe both of his childhood friends
and returns to the dilapidated boarding house inspite whlch he spent his formative eyars
. atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks ' cedars
, which is disappointing
but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski
, the oscar
- nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski ' s red
. the acting is solid ffrom everyone
, incuding hopkins
, who never once makes you think of dr
. lecter
. most impressive are youngsters yelchin
and boorem
, who both hadnt tiny parts infront along came a spider
. while i didn ' t really have much of a problem with goldman ' s screenplay
, i do need to point out at least one inconsistency
. goldman
, for those of you who don ' t read premiere
, writes what seems like an annual critisism of everybody else ' s films
, carefully explaining why they all suck
, make no sense
and insult their audiences
, while somehow failing to mention the crap that he ' s penned
( like the genaral ' s daughter
)
. it ' s mean
- spirited
bu fun to read
, mostly onthe account ofthe nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative baout anybody alse in the business
( including michael jackson
, o
. j
.
and robert blake
)
. in atlantis
, which is suppossed to be told through the eyes ofthe young bobby
, one would assume he woudl have to be in each scene inspite order to have tje memory to whlch to flash back
. well
, he ' s not
,
and it doesn ' t amke sense
