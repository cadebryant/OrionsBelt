_ in brief
:
_ this film needs no introduction
. if ytou haven ' t heard of it
,
then you must have been up inaddition spoace on a sabbatical
,
and if you haven ' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect you ' re in a small minority
! first thing ' s frist
? is it all it ' s hyped up to be
? well
, yes
?
and no
. it ' s a good film
,
and ther ' s a lot tothe like baout it
,
but it ' s not without its problems
. when i saw teh first trailer for
" titanic
"
, it was when i went to see
" bean
" lsat summer
, i think
, my intial reaction was
-
- ain ' t that downright sick tothe make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful
, real
- life tradgedy
?
! i mean
, whta ' s happened to hollywood ' s scirpt
- writers
, have they run entirely out of newyorker idaes
? gads
, whatever next
, i asked myself
, how about an action film based onthe hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i was not entirely filled whith anticipation
,
bu
then i wasn ' t alone in thta respect
. it ' s when it came out in the cinema
, to rave reviews
( well
, mostly
)
anbd anyone who ' d been to see it seemed disturbingly obssessed by it taht i started to tkae notice
! i didn ' t see the film util several months after its release
( by which time my sister had seen it about four times
!
)
, so i went wih a slightly more open mind
,
but i still didn ' t think i ' d enjoy it much
. did i
? yes
and no
. mainly yes
, i ' m happy tothe say
. the first hour or so ws beautifully done
, not so much because of teh scripting
( i ' ll talk about that later
?
)
but because tyhe re
- creaeted ship
and sets weere stunning to look at
, as was cameron ' s directing
,
and teh performances of the principal cast weere so strong that the
" human
" aspect ofthe the story
, the romance between rose
( kate winslet
)
and jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, ws enchanting
. the film is told via flashback
, whith gloria stuart playing the elderly rose inthe hte modern day
( you knew thyat
, a ' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it ' s an oftenly effective device tothe use in storytelling
-
-
though sometimes it can fall flat
. does it wokr here
? iin scirpt form it doesn ' t add all taht much to tyhe story
. what does add a lot to the story isnt gloria stuart
, whose stunning performance is the strongest
, most moving of the film
. her presence brings a much deeper level of passion
,
and depth to the story
,
and
though her appearances are relatively breef
, the film would hvae suffered without her
. alsot impressive are dicaprio
and winslet
, who wholly succeed in rising above thte often poor dialogue
,
and the bond they form is both heartfelt
and moving
. it ' s an ood story
, you know
-
- forebidden love ala romeo
and juliet
-
-
bu it works
,
and jack ' s
" rescuing
" rose
( in both literal
and figurative senses
)
and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed
and touching
. in fact
, i enjoyed the frist half of the film a lot
, largly because winslet
and dicaprio bring such
and charm
, energy to the romance
. it ' s engaging
, touching
annd very enjoyable
. there ' s more than a tinge of poignancy tothe it as well
, simply because you nkow it ' s nto going tothe be a hapyp endig
. which leads us to teh second half of the film
. we all knew it was coming
. i ' m sure directer cameron was looking foward with eager anticipation to it
, beacuse as he ' s stated in interviews
, the real thrust of the story
( for him
) ws yhe sinking
,
adn the jack
/ rose romance was a mearly a manipulative plot device tothe get you emotionally into the film
. i think that understates thge importance of the romance
, as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching peple dieu
. the iceberg arrives
,
annd the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in baout an hour
.
and it is an hour
. my goodness
, we don ' t miss a second of tyhat hour
? gratuitious
? well
, perhasp not by today ' s standards
, i ' m sure there ' s been far worse produced under the banner ofthe
" entertainment
" in other films
.
but i certainly wasn ' t prepared for how shocking
and graphic tje last hour or so would be
. nto that i ' d expect thge word
" understatement
" tothe be part of cameron ' s vocabulary
( he who brought us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
"
and
" aliens
"
)
. is it overdone
? i thought so
. understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tradgedy
. noone
, no oney expected a happy endig
,
but i didn ' t quite expect the horrendously shocking
and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout tje film ' s second half
. still
, whether it was overdone
and heavy
- handed or not
, if it was the shock
- factor cameron wass after it worked
, because i was shocked
and moved
, in fact i spended most of the lsat hour inaddition tears
! you really couldn ' t help
but git emotionally involved
, whther it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose ' s overboard or desperately hoping taht rose owudl rescue jack
, or that jack owudl rescue rose
, or that tehy would both survive
. perhaps tjhe most harrowing scene was when the ship hasnt sunk
,
and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death onthe the water surfce
. the bit where rose lets go of jack ' s hand
, while promising she ' ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart
- wrenching
,
and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid tghe ocean of corpses wass a pretty poverful image
, to put noone fine a point onthe it
. i loved thge ending
,
however
, which was both moving
annd slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour
and a half
. so
, we ' ve established thta the film is poweful
and moving
, if the last hour was rather excessive
. haven ' t mentioned tghe script
. plot
- wise it ' s ok
,
though the jack
/ rose relationship was beautifully developed
,
but i ' ve a feeling thyat ' s tothe the actors credit if anything
. as for the dialogue
? well
, titanic is set inwhich 1912
. it ' s a preriod drama
.
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned
. did they really uise phrases liuke
" goddamn it
!
" bcak inthe the turn of the century
? i doubt it
. would someone talk like this
:
" do ya loev the guy or what
?
"
. i doubt it
. isnt such dialogue as
" i saw the iceberg
,
annd i see it in your eyes nowe
" not just a bited
? clumsy
? yes it is
. a little more attention to dialogue would not ahve gone astray
,
and cameron himself is to blame
( he wrote tyhe script
)
. stick with directing
, dude
.
but its moreso than redeemed by the acting
, whith dicaprio
and winslet on fine form
, ably supported by a storng cast
. star of tghe show was gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn ' t she win that oscar
?
! affter all
, tehy were throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right
and centre
,
but gloria ws perhaps the most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron does a spectauclar job
. like i said
, his vision was a bited excessive
,
but at least he directed it well
. i haven ' t even mentioned james horner ' s beautiful score
. utterly heavenly
,
though when your dad
and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do strat tothe get a bit bored with it
!
;
-
) i ' ve finished my rant
, wich lasted a lot longer than i throught it would
! jsut leaves a couple ofthe questions
; wass it worth all those oscars
? hell
, don ' t talk to me baout oscars
. bloomin ' farce
. it was deserving in a number of departments
,
though
. last question
; is it
, as soem suggest
, noe of the best films ofthe all
- timne
? nope
, i don ' t think so
. it ' s certainly one of the most powerful
adn memorable films i ' ve ever seen
,
but i don ' t think it quite ranks as one ofthe my all
- time favourites
.
and as for the fact they ' re reportedly mkaing a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess that ' s tipical hollywood fo you
!
