swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both childrens
and adults
. steven spielberg may not have directed
( he onyl executive produced
)
but his touch certainly isnt evident iin thsi movie
.
and he knows a money making winner when he sees one
. the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster
: big action
, funny comedy
,
and the pacing of a rollercoaster
. hopkins plays don diego de la vega
, otherwise known as zorro
. a fighter fo the people
, he isnt eventually captued by don rafael montero
( stuart wilson
)
, who also
, unintentionally
, kills his wief
. the film cuts tothe twenty years later
, where vega still wants to montero dead
.
however
, he ' s far too old now
,
and trains up thief alejandro murrieta
( banderas
) to become the new zorro
. banderas motive
? to avenge the death of his brother
, who was killed at the hands ofthe captain love
( matthew letscher
) who rether tastefully keeps the head in a jar
, infront oen of thte moreso graphic scenes inaddition this family movei
. with the scene setted
, the movie goes on full blast
, iwth sword fights a
- plenty
and witty one liners
. banderas
and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro ' s
, playing each other off with ease
. hopkins seems tothe come off a littel better
,
but banderas does some excellent owrk
. as the bad guys
, wilson
and letscher seem oen dimensional
,
but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above averege way
. the audience does hate them
, which can ' t be bad
. catherine zeta
- jones also pops up as hopkins daughter
,
anbd
although she provides littel omre than the usual female lead
, she delivers a charming
,
but noe note
, performance
. the chemistry is excellent between banderas
adn jones
. there ' s a delightful little scene where banderas
and jones hvae a sword fight
,
annd every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed
, until jones clothes fall off all together
. thge director
, fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye
( 1995
) handles the film perfectly
. the action is well done
and fast paced
, the comedy put across well
. the cast help a lot
,
but the direction is still outstanding
. altho teh film isnt very long
, hte plot keeps chugging along
,
and there ' s barely a dull moent
.
howver
, the film is a little over indulgent
,
and it sould have beeen trimmed
. it manages to hold the attention
, thankfully
,
and the adventure
and charm holds right uv to tghe last reel
. screenwriters john eskow
, ted elliot
and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched
and one dimensional script
.
although they ' ve buyed zorro up to date with big explosions
and wild action
, the plot itself isnt bearly existent
. there ' s lots of little sub plots hanging around
,
but ther ' s nothing substantial to bring them all toghether
. tyhe main story seems tothe be the fatc thast rafael wants to ' buy ' california useing gold stolen from the guy he ' s buying tjhe land off
. this sets uv forthe a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven inot getting the gold from little mines
.
however
, thsi doesn ' t seem to apearing untill nearly over a hour into the film
, so the film isnt never qtuie sure where it ' s going
. iin teh end
however
, zorro provides action
and comedy in spades
. it suitable for everyone
, so put yhe guilt behind
,
and put some more money into spielbergs bank account
. you won ' t regret it
.
