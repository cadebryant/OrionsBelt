. steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production
. the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing hte horror ofthe war
. please keep tjhe kids home as the r rating is for reality
. toom hanks is stunning as capt john miller
, set out in france durig ww ii tothe rescue
and return hmeo a soldier
, private ryan
( matt damon
) who lost three brothers in the war
. spielberg at time tkaes us inside the heads of these indviduals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes
. private ryan is not for everyone
,
but i feeled the time was right for a movie like this to be made
. the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men
and women
. we must nto ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice
, their lives so that we may live inwhich freedom todya
. for this i thank them
anbd for steve spielberg for making a movei that i wiull never forget
. the academy will not foreget toom hanks come april 1999
, as anohter well deserved oscar with be in tom ' s posession
