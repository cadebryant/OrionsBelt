in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because
, inaddition a year plagued by brothers mcmullen
- style
, earnestly shallow gen
- x angst picturesk
, it seemed to be actually baout something
. it angered people
, started arguments outside the theather
, riled things up
. it ignited a spark of excitement in waht otherwise has beeen a disapointing year for independent film
. haveing endured my share ofthe the hype
, i waited calmly forthe men tothe reach the hinterlands wherein i reside
,
and
then checked in to see what all the fuss was about
. does men live uv to its press
? well
, yes it does
.
adn it may amking ytou think twice befor ytou consider dating anyone your office
. for the uninitiated
, newcomers aaron eckhart
and matt malloy play chad
and howard
, two corporate drones who are despatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment
. chad
annd howard are archetypes
, examples ofthe which you cin noone doubt find in your pwn place of business
. chad is the blond golden boy
, genetically engineered for success
, the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly uv the corparate ladder
. howard is chad ' s boss
,
bu he is weaker of will
, the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his postion through dogged persistence rather than raw talent
. we firt meet them awaiting their flight iin a drab airport lounge
. there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain
: he
and howard iwll find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office
, woo her simultaneously
, win her love
,
annd
then dum her
. the reason
? both men ahev recently beeen dumped themselves
,
and chad sees an eazy route to revenge aganist the fairer sex
.
" it ' ll restore a little dignity to our lives
,
" he says
. howard
, helpless against the force ofthe chad ' s will
, agrees to the plan
. tehy quickly spot thier prey in the form of christine
( stacy edwards
)
, a fragel deaf woman working as a temp
. chad moves in forthe the kill
, flashing his golden boy smile
, plying christine with lunch
,
then flowers
,
then dinner
. howard follows suit
,
though his efforts are in contrast ham
- handed
and desperate
. flattered to ahev teh attention of two eligble men
, christine dates them both
. you can guess whihc one she falls fo
. soon a tragic lovers ' triangle develops
: christine loves chad
, chad loves himself
,
and howard loves christine on the grounds that
, since she ' s handicapped
and shy
, she just might be wretched
anbd lonely enough to settle for him
. adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high
, does it
? in chad
, writer
/ directer labute
annd actor eckhart have created oney of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film
- hannibal lector may eat human flesh
,
but chad is an eater of souls
. his evil isnt as subtle as a viper ' s
,
and as eazy as his smile
. we watch in stunned disbelief as he back
- stabs coworkers
, humiliates his subordinates
,
and works his deadly venom into christine ' s heart
. his charactor would be a joke if he wasn ' t so chillingly rela
- all ofthe us have worked wtih a chad
,
and some ofthe us may be him
. he ' s hte guy who takes your job
and
then laughs at you for your weakness
. if one of his co
- workers shoudln happen to go postal
and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns
, he had best have his escape route claerly in mind
. politics is his game
,
and the modern cubicle
- filled office is his playground
. men wears the guise of a black comedy
,
but it functions best as allegory
. the most contravercial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company
,
then forces him to proove it in a manner i won ' t describe
. the scene is charged with racism
adn fraught wih peril
. could it happen inthe the real world
? probably not
. taked as allegory
,
however
, it is representative of the treatment of thge meek by hte powerful in all facets of society
. maybe it ' s just the english major in me
,
but chad
, inthe his motiveless cruelty towards christine
and his careful manipulation ofthe howard
, can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism
, of greed without coscience
. the entire film is a methaphor for social darwinism
- only the strong iwll survive
. the marvel of labute ' s multi
- layered scirpt is that it can disturb each member ofthe its audeince in an entirely diffrent way
.
bu does the film work as entertainment
? its darned funny in spots
, particularly infact the men ' s room scenes
, which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation hwile engaged in thte most basic of bodily functions
. it works less well as drama
, usance by necessity the characters iin an allagory tend to be flat ciphers
. stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine
,
and succeds in mkaing us care for her
,
but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her
. likewise
, chad
and howard are simply tyhe sum of thier actions
. by the end of the film you ' ll feel as if you ' ve met a genuin monster in chad
; perhaps we can aslo classify men as a horror film
. certainly those expecting a convential hollywood resolution to teh storey will walk away disapointed
.
but thge picture is oftenly mesmerizing
,
and tje script isnt a owrk of fine craftsmanship
, which makes it well worth your tyme
. like all good films
, it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world
. hwile watching chad in his moment of triumph
, i couldn ' t help
but think that bill gates must have felt thte same sort of cold
, merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs
. there may be a little bited ofthe chad in all ofthe us
,
bu some ofthe us hvea taken chad
- ness tothe the levle ofthe art
.
