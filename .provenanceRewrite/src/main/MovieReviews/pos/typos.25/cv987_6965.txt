trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors
, steve buscemi
. he gave memorable performences inwhich infront the suop
, fargo
,
and reservoir dogs
. nowe he trys his hand at wirting
, directing
and acting all in teh same flick
. the movie starts outloud awfully slow withthe tommy
( buscemi
) hanging around a local bar the
" trees lounge
"
anbd him pestering his brother
. it ' s obvious he a loser
.
bu as he says
" it ' s better i ' m a loser
and know i am
,
hten being a losr
and not thinking i am
.
" well put
. tyhe story starts tothe take off when his uncle dies
,
adn tommy
, not having a job
, decides to drive an ice cream truck
. well
, hte movie starts to pick up iwth him finding a love interest in a 17 yera old girl named debbie
( chloe sevigny
)
and
.
.
. i liked this movie alot even
though it did not triarch my expectation
. after you ' ve seen him in fargo
and reservoir dogs
, you know he is capable of a better performence
. i think his brother
, michael
, did an excellent job for his debut performence
. mr
. buscemi is off tothe a good career as a director
