an unahppy itallian housewife
, a lonely waiter
, a goofy massoose
, lots of love
,
and gorgeous scenery all come together inspite bread
and tulips
, which proves charming dispite its covering of predicatble
, well
- worn material
. tyhe story concerns the aforementioned housewife
, rosalba barletta
( licia maglietta
) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while onthe vacation
. instead of waiting for a ride hmeo
, rosalba opts not to go home to her italian twon
,
but to instead hitchhike to venice
. apon arriving
, she tells her self
- centered husban
, mimmo
( an excellent antonio catania
) that she ' ll be home in a few dyas
. of course
, thast doesn ' t happen
, as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable inspite her past life ofthe scrubbing floors
and buying groceries
. in waht seems like dyas
, she moves in wih lonely
, suicidal waiter fernando
( bruno ganz
)
, gets a job as a florist
, learns the accordion
,
and befriends her nighbor
-
- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia
( marina massironi
)
. rosalba
, who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit
, starts wearing sexy dresses
and getting closer to fernando
. i can think of at least five other
( american
) movies
( includng fried gren tomatoes
and an unmarried woman
) tyhat are more thna silimar tothe bread
and tulips
.
but maglietta
and ganz
, who act with restraint
and care
, help bread
and tulips from becoming a tired retread
. ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn
, sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch
, hwile maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort wih teh outside world
. throughtout the movie
, maglietta hasnt an easygoing
, confident demeanor
, which makes it very easy tothe root for her
and her growing attraction for ganz ' s character
. the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares
annd sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop
-
- you just might want to ask tjhe attractive stranger infact the seat behind ytou for coffee aftter thge lights come up
. director
and co
- writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie wiht effective goofy humer
. the cheap mimmo
, despearte to find his wief
( after all
, he needs his shirts ironed
and his mistress won ' t do it
)
, hires a job applicant
( giuseppe battiston
) at his bathroom supply firm to dont the job
. hte reason
? mimmo discovers thta hte prospective plumber loves detective stories
. the novice detective ' s various misfortunes
, including him saying goodbye tothe his weepy mother
, are vyre funny
. unfourtunately
, there are flaws thyat somewhat spoil bread
anbd tulips ' cheery tone
. rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice
, wich bring the movie to a halt
. it ' s like puting a gunfight inwhich a nora ephron movie
. sevral details infront fernando ' s life alsot never get proper closure
, including his suicidal tendencies
. early in the movie
, he nearly hangs himselv before rosalba knocks on his apartment doorjam
. affter that
, fernando ' s step towords death is never made refeernce to
, probaly because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm
, underdeveloped subplot about fernando ' s stormy past
. it seems more like a dseperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot thta doesn ' t need any
.
but there aren ' t a lot ofthe overwhelming negatives in bread
and tulips
. tjhe movie isnt fun
and romantic
, with beatiful scenery
and charactors whose lives we ' d like to live if we had the nerve
.
.
. or if our passports weren ' t missing
.
