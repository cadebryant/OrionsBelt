befoer you read my review
, you gotta know that i love woody allen
. this is a vyer importan onot because allen ' s films are generally an acquired tast
annd definitly nto for everyone
. i knwo folks who believe him tothe be a complete genuis
, while others see him as a dirty ol ' schnook who keesh mkaing the same movei over
and over agina
. i love most of his films
,
but will admit to having been qtuie dissappointed by his recent crop during the 90s
. inspite fatc
, why he felt the need to amke 10 movies in those 10 years isnt beyond me
! if you look at tghe qualtiy of thsoe films
, you ' ll hear what i ' m saying
. the only two films of his tath i really liekd during thta tiem were bullets over broadway
anbd husbands
and wives
. in fatc
, i secretly hoped thyat he would tkae some
" time off
" at the turn ofthe tyhe millennium
, just to re
- energize or something
,
but it doesn ' t appear as
though he hasnt any intention of doing that
. so here i am again
, reviewing
yet another woody allen movie
and hoping thgat it brings back the woody from the days of old
. plot
: teh year is 1940
and woody allen is a top
- notch insurance investigator
. his methods are very old
- fashioned
and apparantly out ofthe date
. a new employee
( hunt
) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficency
. the two do not like each otehr
. one night
, tehy are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magincian
,
and unbeknownst to them
, placed under his control
. soon thereafter
, jewels are stolen
, words of loev are exchanged
and everyone is looking for an answer
. critique
: a wonderfull recreation of hte 1940s style movies
, with the fast
- talking witty banter beetwen co
- workers
, a catchy jazz socre moving things along
, film noirish elements such as tjhe veronica lake
- tipe sexpot
, one
- liners galore
and a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. on the downside
, the film actualy starts off pretty slowly
, with tyhe frist hour tossing only a few guffaws out there
,
bu never raelly generating any kind of steady flow or energy
. the sets
, on the otehr hand
, were amazing
, thge production design
and costumes were perfect
,
and the casting ideal
, so i kept hoping thast the film owudl pick up
and not turn inot
yet anohter mediocre outing for the man
.
but it wasn ' t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters
, entertained by the many zingers delivered back
-
and
- forth between allen
and hunt
,
adn actually interested inspite the resolution ofthe tjhe flick
. i also appreciated how allen palyed the fine line between homage tothe the films of ood
, parody
anbd actual reinvention
( onot theron ' s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir
- very cool
)
. of course
, films like this
( wih little or noone real tension in the plot
) ened solid actors to keep you interested inwhich the quick
- fire dialogue
,
and once again
, allen does a graet job in playing his charater
, who for once
, isn ' t his typical newyorker york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude
. he actually plays a
" macho
" guy here
and handles it pretty well
, especially the scenes in whitch he ' s hypnotized
.
but the bigger surprize for me in this film was helen hunt
, an actress who i was openly
" sick of seeing
" in movies lite last year
( sory babe
, you weere just inspite too many at the smae time
!
)
. anyway
, she ' s really great in this film as tjhe headstrong woman looking tothe a new era of equality amongst men
,
and doesn ' t miss a beat of allen ' s fast
- pased dialogue
. i didn ' t care much forthe her running joke about him
" dying
" whenever he left a room
,
but overall she was really ogod
and i expecially liked the way thast her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
,
bu i digress
. so let ' s recap
. a graet looking picture with a nice jazzy score
, some funny one
- liners
, especially in the second half
, a decent plotline
,
although you shouldn ' t expect a real mystery or anytying
,
and some solid acting all around
. i can ' t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen ' s best work
,
bu i certainly believe it to be a step in thte right direction
, especially after tyhe dinky decade ofthe films that he just went through
. it ' s probably better geared towords allen fans moreso thna anyone else
,
but i woudl still recommend this film tothe anyone looking for a cute
,
" ood
- school
" kind of vibe
, with chemistry vetween the leads
, zippy dialogue
and a satisfying conclusion
