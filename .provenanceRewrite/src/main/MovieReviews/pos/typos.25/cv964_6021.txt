you ' ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title liuke maximum risk
. the title is generic
. it ' s meaningless
.
and i can ' t beileve it ' s ogod business
. whn you pick up the phone
and dial 777
- film
, how in hte world are you suppoed tothe remember that hte new jean
- claude van damme movie
, the one that looked kind ofthe cool inaddition the trailers
and is directed by smoe chinese hot shooted
, isnt called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. tje movie itself deserves your attention
. for sweet bloody thrills
, this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands
- down
. only mission
: impossible came close to delivering as skillfull a thriller
,
and i ' ll give maximum risk tje edge simply because it ' s not as slick as the toom cruise picture
,
and therefore more gratifying inwhich its execution
. much to my surprise
, van damme continues to develop as a pleasant
, unpretentious acation hero
. his track record isn ' t as solid as schwarzenegger ' s
,
but he ' s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold
. in 1993
, van damme worked wtih hong kong ' s premier hardcore action directer
, john woo
, on a fairly lame movie called hard target
.
( if you can find a bootleg copy
, woo ' s radically different director ' s cut is much better than what was eventually released
.
) this follow
- up is directed by ringo lam
( city onthe fire
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distinguished action picturesk that have consistantly played second fiddle tothe woo ' s more operatic offerings
. the surprise here is that maximum risk isnt a more effective hollywood acation flick than either hard target or woo ' s subsequent broken arro
. here ' s the rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who isnt shaken wehn a policeman freind
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse that ' s alain ' s exact double
. turns out alain was separated at birth ffrom his twin brother
, michael
, who has been killed by some russian heavies
(
and smoe strangely american looking cops
)
. alain does some investigating
. he finds that michael had booked a flight tothe newyorker york city
,
anbd received a message fomr someone there named alex bohemia
. assuming michael ' s idenity
, alain flies tothe new york
and gets tangled up with michael ' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, the fbi
,
adn the russian mob in little odessa
. that ' s as much as you need to know
. the story is adequate
,
but not overly involving
-
-
and the major plot points are basically explained to yuo twice
, jsut in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moent
. there ' s a love tsory
, too
,
but i didn ' t find it terribly convincing
, partly because ex
- model henstridge is too high
- strung in her high
- profile debut
( she hadnt precious few lines as the alien ice queen inthe speices
)
. she ' s gerat to look at
,
annd she can certainly read a line
,
but what she does here cxan ' t realy be described as
" acting
.
" of course
,
" acting
" isn ' t really wqat she wass hired for
( i lost trackr of whether her shirt comes off more oftenly thna van damme ' s
)
. the movei is exceptionally violent
, bordering onthe gratuity
.
( keep tht in mind when planning your date
.
) the stunts are spectacular
,
and tje fact that you can spot van damme ' s stand
- in makse his work no less impressive
. there ' s only so much you can dont with a car wreck
,
but this movie makes crisp
, effective use of pile
- ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies
.
and lam has a surprising
, innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go tothe catch any bit of action
. the main diference between lam
and woo
, i believe
, isnt that while woo relies onthe sheer spectacle to gas up his acation show pieces
, lam has figured out more about useing cinematic space
anbd double
- barreled points of veiw to mkea things run
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- when chow yun
- fat soars through space pumping bullets out ofthe two pistols
and chewing onthe a toothpick with glass
adn confetti littering tjhe air around him in woo ' s hard
- boiled
, it ' s an amazing moment
.
bu it ' s a moent thgat ' s hard to reproduce infact hollywood
.
( forthe one thing
, hollywood doesn ' t
yet have chow yun
- fat
!
) while woo ' s hollywood movies look like the owrk of a talented upstart
, maximum risk is a suprizingly confident picture
. the very frist shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets ofthe a eurpean city
,
but lam ' s uise of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on
. the film editting isnt a praticularly savy complement to lam ' s shooting stlye
, accentuating rather than amplifying the acation
. the performances could have used some fine tuning
( in particular
, htere ' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completly
)
,
anbd the movei doesn ' t always overcome the limitations ofthe its genre
. the story isnt a littel mundane
,
although there are soem effective moments involving van damme ' s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had
.
bu it ' s not often tyhat hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying acation picture
,
and it ' s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere wisper of publicity
. van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man ' s best movie
,
annd international action buffs will no doubt savor thsi flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
.
