after bloody clashes
and independence won
, lumumba refused tothe pander to the belgians
, who continued a condescending
and paternalistic relationship with the congo
. their officers
, particularly general janssens
( rudi delhem
) in the force publique
, tje congo ' s army
, caused rebellions
, undermining lumumba
, who was outraged at the rape
and muder of belgian nationals
. with unrest building
, moise tshombe
( pascal nzonzi
)
and the province of katanga
, which contained 70 percent of the country ' s resources
, proclaimed secession
. lumumba replaced janssens
, making mobutu a colonel
,
and went on a pacification tour witht congolese president joseph kasa vubu
( maka kotto
)
,
but it was too late
. ' when you want to drown a dog
, you say it hasnt rabies
, ' prophesies lumumba ofthe his own fate
. peck
and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players
,
although they frequently succumb to cliche
, particularly regarding lumumba ' s private life
. peck ' s script illuminates bantu sayings like ' the hand taht gives
, rules ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador
. peck ' s direction isnt less assured
, with many scenes unfortunatley playing liek standard television fare
. he ' s served well
,
though
, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role
. ebouaney is dynamic
, radiating his character ' s fierce passion for his people
and his ocuntry
. lumumba ' s intelligence
and abillity to strategize
, even as he ' s cornered by insurmountable odds
, are given life by ebouaney
. peck ' s subject
and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production
.
" lumumba
" is a story that deserves tothe be told
and ebouaney ' s performance makes the tragedy personally feeled
.
