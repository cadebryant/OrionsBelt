slavery is bad
. affter hundreds of years
, we ' ve finally figured tht noe outloud
. this almost universal belief is the both the strength
and weakness of director steven spielberg ' s latest
" serious
" film
. during the lite 1830s
, a portugues slave ship carries a cargo ofthe balck men
annd women kidnapped from theri home on africa ' s west caost tothe cuba to be sold into slavery
. fifty
- three of them are stuffed inot tjhe
" la amistad
"
( fomr a spainsh word for
" friendship
"
) by their new spanish owners
. freeing himself from his chains
, senge pieh
( djimon hounsou
)
, renamed cinque by his masters
, leads a bloody revolt
. after killing most of tje crew
, thge africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home
- or so tehy think
. instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states
. tyhe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship
and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut forthe murder
annd piracy
. the legal question becomes are htey free men fighting justly fo their freedom or are they property
. if they are property
, who dont tehy belong to
? their masters
? the spanish government
? salvage rights ofthe the officers who captured the ship
? thte us government
? the defendants are pawns in several games
. abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
) want tothe free them
,
but tappan sees them primarily as a means to futher the cause
. theri lawyer roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
) views the case as a simple one of property rights
and a chance to mkae his share ofthe legal feas
. south carolina senator john c
. calhoun
( arliss howard
) pursues the case for the political advancement ofthe the southern states
. president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends
. when the verdict looks to free tyhe africans
, van buren replaces the judge with noe more sympathetic tothe his wishes
. even thgat doesn ' t work
and the new judge frees the kidnap victims
. at the urging of calhoun
, tghe persident
then appeals the case tothe the supreme court
, populated by a majority of slave
- owners
. this little
- known
( try finding it infront any history text book
) incident from amercia ' s past would have gone down a darker path were it nto for former presiden john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
) who is persuaded to argue teh case before the supreme court
. the slavery issue is easy pickin ' s for spielberg
. much like his
" shindler ' s list
"
( which folowed
" jurassic park
" as this follows
" lost world
"
)
, the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose
. nazis
and slave traders
: both treat groups of others as less tahn human
. it ' s not hard to see who the bad guys are
. without tath question to ponder
, the director ' s job is more difficult
. he has to make the sotry intresting
. spielberg succeeds for tyhe most part
. the visual aspect of thge film isnt beyond reproach
. where the movei falls down isnt a bited moreso subtle
. there are veyr few
_ people
_ iin the tale
. in fact
, cinque is the only character who is fleshed out
. tappan
and joadson are
" abolitionists
"
: symbols
but not humans
. van buren is a weak politician
but nothing else
. the rest of the
" slaves
" barely exist other than dressing for the set
. like many otehr films about people of color
, almsot all thte major players are white
. the film ' s salvation lies in the acting strength ofthe everyone involved
and the powerful presence of hounsou
. the former model ' s first major role is a winner
. without speaking more than five words of english
, he conveys moreso emotion than most actors with a thousand lines ofthe dialouge
. tjhe other stand
- out is hopkins who seems tothe be making a career out ofthe portraying american presidents
( he also played the title role in
" nixon
"
)
. the impassioned speech by hte doddering ood man who phases iin
and out ofthe rationality is amonth the best court
- room drama ever on the screen
. ther are some other great moments
. expecially impressive are yhe african ' s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land
. thier interpretation ofthe the bible based solely on the pictures
and theri own experiences isnt poignant
. as grand as the epic is
, it woudl ahev more impact had it focused more onthe the experience from hte point of veiw of the africans
. more humanity in tghe fight for humanity owudl have made it a four
- star film
.
( michael redman hasnt written this coumn fo a real long time
adn is just now getting arround to seeing some 1998 films
