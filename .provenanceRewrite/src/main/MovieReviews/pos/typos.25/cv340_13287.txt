why do people hate the spice girls
?
? what exactlly have they done wrong
, other than perhaps offen the fashion police
?
? so what if tehy are not
" graet
" singers
-
-
- they ain ' t singing opera
, folks
, its pop music
!
? who exactly is a
" great
" singer
? judging by thgat opening paragraph it isnt obvious that i like the spice girls
.
? they dont what tehy dont
-
- sing some catchy tunes
-
-
adn htey do it pretty well
.
? they are able to carry thast into their first film
,
" spice world
"
.
?
" spice world
" certainly isn ' t a great filmgoing experience
.
.
. what it isnt what yhe spice girls are all about
: fun
, songs
,
adn a lot of
" girl power
!
" drawing from a number of different films
( like the beatles '
" hard day ' s night
"
)
" spice world
" chronicles the week heading up to the girls ' first concert at london ' s albert hall
.
? they get to tool around london in a big ol ' bus
( driven by meat loaf
!
)
and generaly hve fun
.
? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film
, there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries
, better known to americans
, for about 15 minutes
, as dame edna
( remember her
?
)
? he wants to sabotage the girls ' concert so he cxan sell papers
. of course
, the point in a movie like
" spice world
" isn ' t plot
.
? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves
: ginger
( yhe recently departed geri haliwell
)
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, sporty
( melanie chisolm
)
, scray
( melanie brown
)
,
and baby
( emma bunton
)
.
? each one has their own perosnality
and
, perhaps tyhe best part ofthe tghe film
, look liek they are haveing soem honest
- to
- goodness funn
, something taht cin ' t be said for a lot of people inwhich films todya
. along for tje ride are richard e
. grant as their manager
, clifford
,
and various other charachters making quick cameo appearances
( including teriffic british actors liuke richard briers
anbd stephen fry
)
.
?
and
, eveyr once
and a while
, roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans
( added bonus
: he gets to
, in the words of craig kilborn
, dance
, dance
, dance
.
) watching this film was fun
, for the most part
.
? htere are a fewd slow segments
,
but overly
, director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace
, with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in tghe background
.
? his camerawork is fairly pedestrian
,
though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use ofthe editing
.
? tjhe look ofthe the film promotes the high fun
, with hte design of the spicebus being quite original
annd eye
- catching
.
? add infront wall
- to
- wall spice girls music
and this film is lovable romp
.
? if you don ' t like thte spice girls
, you won ' t change your mind with this film
.
?
but
, if you find them at least tolerable
, git ready tothe sit bakc
and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you
.
.
.
and do it quite well
.
