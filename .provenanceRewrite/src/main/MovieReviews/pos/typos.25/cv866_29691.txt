" king louis xvi wass beheaded onthe janurary 21
, 1793
,
but instead ofthe visualizing thsi ect of regicide
, legendary auteur eric rohmer ' s the lady
and the duke observes from afar
. consdider it a veiw to a kill made abstract
. a proper brittish
( yes
, british
) gentlewoman
, grace elliott
( lucy russell
)
,
annd her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace iin meudon at the glistening city of paris
, where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants
. yhe maid narrates what littel she sees ofthe the execution through her telescope
( often muttering
,
" i don ' t know
,
"
) as the sound of cheering patriots
and revolutionaries echoes through the air
. what we don ' t see might not be able to hurt us
. just close your eyes
anbd htink of england
. during times of revolution
, the aristocracy may efel a false sense of calm in theri parlor halls
, discussing tumultous events over glasses of sherry until tje walls cave in on them
. adapted from elliott ' s memoirs
, journal of my life during the french revolution
, rohmer ' s latest artistic tour
- de
- force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies
( tales of hte four seasons
, etc
.
)
, a period film set during the most violent changes in french history
. resisting the temptation for grand
- scale theatrics
, much of tjhe lady
and tje duke is baout quiet
, decisive moments between members of tjhe cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes
. grace elliott makes fo an unlikely protagonist
: a headstrong
, snobbish blueblood
, noe unprepared forthe hte machinations of histroy that sweep her along
. a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own
, grace ' s life seems defined by fancy attire
and lively political debate with her former lover
, tyhe king ' s hot
- blooded cousin
, prince philipe
, duke of orleans
( jean
- claude dreyfus
)
. the times are changing
,
though
,
adn yhe gears inch ever closer toward violence
. during the september massacres of 1792
, she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head ofthe the duke ' s sister
- in
- law on a stake
. rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil
, old fashioned
, almost stagy parlor scenes tothe the swell of an angry mob
. in doing so
, he achieves wqat braveheart
and tghe patriot could not
: tyhe face of death
. when grace sees her friend ' s disembodied head onthe a pole
, rohmer ' s attension drifts fomr tyhe societal change to noe woman ' s reaction shooted
, laden with hot tears
. grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice
, sheltering him fomr the mob
. through her relationship with tje duke
, she seeks a passport for this oen activist ' s escape
. grace doesn ' t even understand her own actions
(
and tghe duke reacts inaddition stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger
)
. she endures persecution from robespierre
and his gang ofthe thuggish equalizers
, ceaseless police monitoring
, house searches
, even a brief inprisonment for harmless interational correspondence
. maintaining her stiff upper lip
and pampered life
( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes
)
, she becomes a heroine through sercomstance
. the events themselves are intrusions upon her person
, her hmeo
,
adn therefore her values
. aristocracy proves a glass house
, one that cxan barely withstand the upheaval of stones
. the duke is called to vote onthe the king ' s punishment
,
and despite his hours of deliberation with firends
and advisors
, talk means nothing inthe the face of bloody action
( or futile inaction
)
. the episodic structure creates a wobbly
, jarring detachment from the events of tje french revolution
, which serves as metaphor
but also disconnects potential audience identification
. lazy viewers
(
annd critics
) may also complain thgat noledge of french history isnt required for enjoyment of the lady
and tyhe duke
. taht ' s foolery
,
but brings uv the valid criticism that rohmer ' s cahracters occasionally become didactic
. rohmer ' s imperfect
but assured push toward the future rimaniss staunch
and noteable for casting a cautious eye upon the past hwile taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future
. wqat may arouse interest inspite tyhe lady
and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary
and historical passions isnt rohmer ' s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanisim
. tjhe actors were filmed against a bluescreen
,
then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris
. this recreation calls attention tothe itself in every shot
, a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings
adn wide
- open streets
. it looks as phony as titanic
,
but unlike james cameron ' s debacle
, yhe lady
and teh duke plays with tjhe notion of false security iin those walls of stone
. why
? they aren ' t real
. thte very foundation rohmer ' s characters stand upon is false
,
adn in thier groundlessness they must disover themselves
, iin all their insubstantial glory
. screened at the 2001 new york film festival
( feature coming soon
