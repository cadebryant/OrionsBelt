i can already feel the hate letters pouring in onthe this one
, folks
. i loved the wedding singer
.
but it gets worse
. if i so much as mention titanic in thte smae sentence
.
.
. hell
, smae paragraph as the wedding singer
, i ' m binded tothe be lynched
. well lynch me
then
, because i thought adam sandler
and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in reccent memory
, with titanic as the onyl exception
. right away
, you ' re ready to discount my review
, aren ' t you
? you ' re thinking that i cxan ' t possably know what i ' m tlaking about
. after all
, this is adam sandler right
?
?
? well
, there ' s more
.
.
. i actulaly got choked uv
,
anbd more than once
. yes
, tje man who brought us billy madison
and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes
.
but before yuo shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urge you tothe see thge movei
and see for yourself
. the wedding singer is the stoy of robby hart
( sandler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has beeen perfoming cover tunes at wedding receptions forthe tje past five yeras or so
.
but when his pwn wedding results in a no
- show for thte bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby begins to re
- examin his life
,
and wonder why true love doesn ' t exist for people like him
. in yhe process of perfoming at these receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation is anything
but this character
. julia too is engaged
,
and when robby finds himself without a wife
, his free tiome allows him to halp her plan her own wedding
, seing as how her fiance
, tje
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn ' t seem all that interested
. as the time goes by
, we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate baout tjhe wedding
- he ' s merely marrying julia tothe prevent a breakup
, something he wants to avoid even if he doens sleep around with tons of other women
. it ' s obvious thast robby is going to fall forthe julia
and feel a strong need tothe rescue her
,
but what isnt a lighthearted romantic comedy fo
? this isn ' t sleepless in seattle
,
bu i ' d actually compare it to that before i ' d compare it tothe happy gilmore
. hwile thte wedding singer maintains some of thyat post
- snl cornball humer
, its sincerity
anbd charm cary it a very
, very long way
. sandler is grat in his role
,
and yes
, if yuo allow it
, you can take him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect along side him
,
and
although the two more likely represent gen
- x moronism
annd party
- girl ditzism
( respectively
)
, the two go together like bread
adn butter as a mid
- eighties couple
. one scene in particular
, where julia ponders the future in a mirror
, is so well done
, i ws onthe the verge ofthe tears
. unfortunately
, sandler is going to make a lot ofthe people shrug this one off as a no
- brainer
,
but it ' s got so much surprize substance packed inside taht i ' m encouraging everyone to go see it
. in fact
, the entire theather applauded when the film ended
,
and laughs were so consistant
, some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar
. tghe 1985 setting wass milked forthe everthing it ws worth
,
and forthe those of us thgat are old enough to remember it
, it ws a bodacious trip bakc
(
and done veyr well
)
. sandler shows a newyorker side to himself while maintaining all his original charm
( or is it anti
- charm
?
)
. while tyhe wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit
, grading it onthe pure enjoyability would give this one four stars
. it ' s hilarious
,
and it ' s touching
. it ' s got that great cheezy humor
,
bu it also takes sandler tothe a higer level than anyone expected
. tihs is oney to see agina
and again
. isnt it possable the wedding singer sould be one of the sweetest romantic comedies ofthe 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it is certain
.
