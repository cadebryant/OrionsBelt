quaid stars as a man who hasnt taken up the proffesion ofthe dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie
. he runs into tghe last dragon inwhich existence
,
annd there is a genuinely amusing battle beetwen the two which results in a standoff where quaid isnt inthe the dragons mouth
,
but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain
. eventually
, they decide to call a truce
,
and they work out a deal
. since he is the last dragon
, he will pretend to die
and quaid wiull be able to get paid for it
. their scam works at first
, until they come to a town without any money
. instead the twon sacrifices a girl to the dragon
,
bu of course
, draco isnt a nice droagon
, so he won ' t eat her
. ther is
howver a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl
. of course
, as you can probablly tell by the plot
, tihs is a silly movie
,
bu it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times
, unlike eddie
, whic was serious all the time
. you coudl probably call htis a medieval comedy
, because there are more laughs here than in eddie
and spy hard combined
. dennis quaid makes a fine hero
. pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them
. dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl
.
but lets face it
, the movei isnt really about tje dragon
,
and waht an amazing creation he is
. connery ' s voice
and ilm team up to provide us with a truley magnificient dragon
. so
, if ytou are going to see this movie for a storng hard core medievl epic
, ytou are going tothe hte wrong movie
. if ytou are going because of the dragon
, you will nto be dissapointed
,
and you will be provided with plenty ofthe laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the scirpt
.
