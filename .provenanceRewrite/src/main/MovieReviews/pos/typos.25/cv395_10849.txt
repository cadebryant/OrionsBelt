jake kasdan
, son of noe of the best screenwriters around
, breaks into filmmaking by writing
and directing this hard
- to
- categorize detective story
: part mistery
, part comedy
, part character study
and part romance
. fo the most part
, kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully
and create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) is a modern day sherlock holmes
. tyhe prallel is present down tothe his lveo of music
(
though zero plays thge gitar rether than the violin
)
,
annd his addiction to drugs
( amphetamines
, rather than morphine
)
. he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces
, the case baout the man who lied about his age
, or the case ofthe the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
.
however zero ' s observance of the fine art of detachment
,
though it makse him a brilliant private investigator
, mkaes him somewhat ofthe a self
- imposed outcast in society
. he could do nothing without the legwork ofthe his trusty assistant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo is not happy with his job
. he is thrilled to be aroud zero ' s brillance
,
but his bizarre behavior
,
annd stange requests
, are frustrating to the former lawyer
.
annd they ' re even more so to his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who is fed uv that her boyfriend ' s boss means omre to arlo thna her
. this is thte situation whn a newyorker case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o ' neill
) hires zero to find his lost keys
. it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring
,
and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence
. now
, stark is being blackmailed
,
and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end
. tothe solve this case
, zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell
.
however
, this is when he is vulnerable
.
.
.
and htis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved inspite the blackmail scheme
. for the first time
, zero has tothe question his pwn objectivity
, as he finds his client less
and less sympathetic
. zero effect is weakest inaddition its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero ' s odd behavior
. such scenes might be appropropiate in an out
-
adn
- out satire
, making zero an ace ventura
- ish character
.
however
, htere ' s a much meatier movie infront here
.
.
. it just tkaes a while to get outloud
. thyat ' s nto to say that there ' s not a place fo humer inaddition this film
. in fact
, soem of yhe best scenes are ben stiller ' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust
and frustration with his employer
.
howver
, teh over
- the
- top scenes never qutie gel with teh rest of the film
,
and they aren ' t funny enough to stand on theri pwn
. once the investigation is underway
,
however
, zero ' s brillance really begins to shine
. his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many ofthe sherlock ' s own
. as the mistery beigns to unfold
, zero ' s deductions lead yhe plot in interesting directions
,
but never loose tghe viewer
. zero effect works well durring its romantic scenes as well
. zero ' s relationship wiht gloria is low
- key
,
but it hits all the right notes
.
however
, we are always kept distant from gloria ' s character
. she ' s given plenty of development
,
bu we never understand what she is thinking
. perhaps tht may be intentional
: tothe place the audience in zero ' s zone of detachment
.
bu
, onthe the whole
, it is frustrating
. bill pullman
, wehn he ' s not spacing out
, creates a vibrant charater in daryl zero
. there ' s noe moent when zero breifly connects to the world which he hasnt managed to detach fomr for many years
,
and it is shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated witht the character
,
but one whic fits in well
.
anbd
,
although it is somtimes hard to take a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it isnt at htis moent that the viewer understands the meaninng behind the nmae
.
although zero effect is a bited awkward in places
, it isnt a storng debut for kasdan
,
anbd shows great promise
.
