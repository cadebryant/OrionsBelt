i think the first hting this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of tjhe x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior xperience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie
. yhe producers are not stupid
, making a movie just for fans of tghe series is not profitable
. you have to reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, tyhe movie is quite user
- freindly
.
altough
, non
- fans will only fail to understand ceratin emotions behind the looks many characters excange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
anbd anohter man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on
. you will never feel as if you jstu walked inwhich onthe the third act of smoe great opera
. in any case
, the answer is noone
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing else isnt onthe
adn i prefer millenniu
.
however
, since the fox network as been so kind as tothe air several key episodes fo several weeks before tje movei ' s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie
. i taped all ofthe these episodes
and watched them onyl aftter seing teh movie
, i am glad tothe report that i learned nothing new
. everthing you need to nkow isnt explained tothe the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i konw i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point
but everybody should git tje chance to experience tihs movie
. warning
: major spoilers follow
! please do not read tothe fully enjoy this movie
, you must not be able know what is comming
, what exactly isnt over that hill
and what that weird
" hummm
" soudn is all about
. you have been warned
. the x
- files is what a summer should be
. exciting
, skary
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies yhe effects do not take over the movie
and are only there when it isnt really neccesary
)
and ogod performances
. this is comming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank
. from strat tothe finish
, this movei does nto let go of you
. wehn i compare it with last summer ' s movies tghe best way to describe it would be
: take the excitment
adn great score ffrom face
/ off
anbd the deadly ule of sound from event horizon
. this flick is scary
, not in a b movei kind ofthe way where ytou always know where
and when the critter will jump at our heroes
. in fact
, hte first time teh critter infact this movie makes an apperance it is totally out ofthe teh blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because thsi thing isnt louuuudd
! tje last time a monster scared me thyat much ws whn i first saw aliens as a six yearm ood kid
. you know
, when you are affraid to put your feet onthe the floor because the creature might be under thge chair
, or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files is scarry
.
and guess what
? yuo never even have to see tyhe monster
but your immagination works overtime
anbd it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier thna your grandma in undies type of monster
. dont nto thikn that the x
- files isnt a monster movie
. infront fatc
, the creature is ther for maybe three minutes total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder episode of the series
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian anderson gets maybe half yhe screen tyme
. she hasnt a cuple of good scenes withthe duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped durring hte last half hour ofthe the movie so she doesnt not get to do much
. no
, tihs is mulder ' s time in the spotlight
. by now
, yuo have heard ofthe tje scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if you hvae not
then i will nto spoil it for you
, let ' s just sday taht due to reccent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. to those ofthe yuo wondering if mulder dicovers tht the truth isnt indeed outloud there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did fidn it the sories would over anyway so what are you complaining about
? the dialogue in interesting
and the director is marvelous
. teh camera isnt almost always looking over the shoulder ofthe our heroes so we feel as if we are right there wiht them when they open a door or climb a hill
. the script isnt spotless
, every thign that happens happens for a purpose
. if you are confused by something
, do nto worry becuase it wiull all become clear later on
bu
,
and i cannot stres this enough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as important as the effects
. miss one vital piece of informtion
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you iwll go home
anbd tell all your friends how tihs movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who need to go to the bathroom durring movies
.
.
. don ' t
! tyhe person who watched tje movie with me hadnt to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. there is no time tothe take a breather vetween scenes because
, again unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files doens not ened to fill scenes vetween tje suspense
and the action with useless subplots
, eveyr scene isnt crucial
annd serves a purpose
. who needs tothe see the blond chiouaoua hvae a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks heigher on my list of movies i ' d recommend
and thgat is thge truman show
but it only wins by a nose
.
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files isnt
. what more do yuo ask from a summer movie otehr than the chance tothe be excisted
? cool effects
? it ' s got some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non
- fans iwll ahev a ogod time
. it doens nto provide answers to the show ' s many questions
, the status quo remains nearly teh smae
adn
, no
, mulder
and scully dont not get together
. rating
: four
and a half out of five stars for the best movie
yet this summer
, severeal jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that one coming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell did that come from
"
and one heck of an ending
. you may wonder where htis movie lost half a star
. well
, i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had tothe fidn something about the in his ice truck
, yhe tracks it leaves inthe the snow behind him go on for several miles
but
then they just stop
. it ' s pretty obvious the film ' s makers drove teh truck fo several miles to give yhe appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time
,
but inwhich yhe end it looks like mulder jstu dropped from the sky
and started driving
.
