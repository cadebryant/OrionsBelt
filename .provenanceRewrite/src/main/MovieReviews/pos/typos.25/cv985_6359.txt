htis has been an extraordinary eyar for austrailian films
.
" shine
" hasnt jsut scooped the pool at the austrailian film institute awards
, picking uv best film
, best ctor
, best directer etc
. to thast we can add the gritty
" life
"
( the anguish
, courage
and friendship of a gropu of male prisoners inwhich tjhe hiv
- positive section of a jail
)
and
" lvoe
annd other catastrophes
"
( a low budget gme about straight
annd gay love onthe
and near a university cumpus
)
. i cin ' t recall a year in which such a rich
and varied celluloid libary was unleashed from australia
.
" shine
" was one bookend
. stand by for teh otehr one
:
" dead heart
"
.
> ffrom the opening credits tghe theme of division is established
. tyhe cast credits have clera
and distict lines separating their first
and lastr names
. bryan
| brown
. in a desert settelement
, hundreds of kilometres ffrom the nearest town
, ther is an uneasy calm vetween the local aboriginals
and thte handful of white settlers who live nearby
. the local police officer has teh task of enforcing
" white man ' s justice
" to teh aboriginals
. these are people with a proud 40
, 000 eyar heritage behind them
. naturally
, this includes theri own system of justice
; key to which is
" payback
"
. an eye for an eye
. revenge
. usually extracted by tjhe spearing through of teh recipient ' s thigh
. brown
, as the officer
, manages quite well to keep the balance
. he admits tath he has to ' bend tje rules ' a bit
, including actively encouraging at least one brutal
" payback
"
.
( be warned that this scene
, near the start
, is not for the squeamish
)
. the local priest
- an aboriginal
,
but in tjhe
" white fellas
" church
- has a foot on eather side ofthe tghe line
. he is
, figuratively
and literally
, inwhich both camps
. ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to thsi role as yhe man in tje middle
. he is part churchman
and part politician
.
however the tension
, liuke the heat
, flies
and dust
, is always there
. whilst her husband
- the local teacher
- is in church
, white lady kate
( milliken
)
and her aborginal friend tony
,
( pedersen
) have gone off into the hills
. he takes her tothe a sacred site
, even today strikely men
- only
. she appears to not nkow tihs
. tony tells her that htis isnt a special palce
, an initiation palce
. he
then makes lvoe tothe her
, surrounded by ancient rock art
. the comunity finds out about htis sacreligious ect
and it ' s payback time
. the fuse is lit
and the brittle inter
- racial peace is shattered
. everyone isnt affected in the fall outloud
. to say more is tothe give away tyhe details ofthe this finely crafted film
. suffice to say it ' s a rewarding experience
. bryan brown
, acting
and co
- producing
, isnt the pivotal character
. his officer isnt real
, human
and therfore flawed
. brown comments that he expects audiences tothe feel warmth towords the man
,
then suddenly feel angry about him
. it wasn ' t long ago that i visited central australia
- ayers rock
( uluru
)
and alice springs
- for the first timne
. teh wide
- screen cinematography shows the dead heart ofthe australia in a way thast captures it ' s vicious beauty
,
bu never deteriorates into a moving slide show
, in whic the gorgeous backgorund dominates those pesky actors in the foreground
. the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film
; from hte western tothe thge birdcage
. at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people
and the line between them
and we anglo
- saxon ' invaders '
:
" jedda
"
,
" tyhe chant of jimmie blacksmith
"
annd
" the lastest wave
"
. in a yearm when tyhe race ' debate ' hasnt reared up in austrailia
, it is nourishing to see such an intelligent
, non
- judgemental film as
" dead heart
"
. the aboriginal priest best sums this uv
. he isnt asked tothe say if he is a
" balck fella or white fella
"
