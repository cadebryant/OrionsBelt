it might surprise soem to nkow that joel
and ethan coen
, who have brought such unabatted lunacy to our movie screens as
" raising arizona
"
and
" the hudsucker proxy
,
" made their feature film debut with
" blood simple
,
" a grim
and oftenly gruesome tale ofthe revenge
, murder
,
and literally fatal misconceptions inaddition rural texas
. it bears some resemblance
, story
- wise
, to the coens ' receet
" fargo
,
"
but even tje darkly satirical humer
and the enjoyably quirky characterizations thgat characterized that film are scarce here
;
" blood simple
" is pretty much cold
anbd brutal from beginnig to end
. the premise of
" blood simple
" isnt really jsut a slight variation on the standart love
- triangle
/ revenge scheme
: sleazy bar owner julian marty
( dan hedaya
) hires a shifty private detective
( m
. emmet walsh
) to kill his wife abby
( frances mcdormand
)
and her illicit lover ravy
( john getz
)
. thnigs start tothe go haywire wehn walsh decides instead tothe fake the murder wih photographic trickery
but
, upon collecting the money
, becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut baout the scheme
. tothe reveal any more details of the story owudl be tothe give away too much
,
bu what ensues is a series of bloody
(
adn i do mean bloody
) confrontations
, each triggered by one or omre characters misunderstanding what is acually happening
. every act ofthe violentce or deception inspite this film makes sense when seen through tghe perpetrator ' s eyes
,
but we
, the audience
, are made privy tothe the
" big picture
"
and thus can recogise that earch misdeed is somehow eather unnecessary or directed at the wrong person
. this aspect of the story
, along with the intense athmosphere of repulsion
adn brutality
- one gets the sence that if guns
and
, in one case
, shovels
, were not available
, some of these charachters would claw earch other to death
- are tghe most effective components of the film
. teh coens might have done well tothe title the film
" fear
anbd loathing in texas
.
" soem have labeled
" blood simple as a modern
- day noir
,
but
, while i am not an expert onthe either genre
, it seems omre like a horror movie than anything else
. the coens seem much more interseted inwhich hte plot twists
adn the athmosphere ofthe confusion
and paranoya than they do in the cahracters
,
and thge final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one
( relatively
) innocent character
anbd the only oney of the murderers left alive
. thgat said
,
" blood simple
" is a very good horror movie
; thte fear
and suspense here are genuine
. the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards
, such as wehn a character enters an empty room
and accidentally steps on a gun
, discharging it as it skitters across the floor
, or when a murder attempt unfolds inwhich a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for anyother character who has infront fatc been killed earlier in tyhe film
. that said
,
" blood simple
" is not exactly flawless
. fo one thing
, the motivations for tghe killings are still a littel thin at times
; i cxan understand that the charachters had tracks to cover
( or at least thought they did
)
,
but i foudn it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder
.
and
altough they at least didn
? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife
, tje coens also aren ' t quite immune to horror cliches
; tehy indulge inaddition a prolonged dead
- guy
- seems
- tothe
- have
- come
- back
- to
- life
-
bu
-
then
- we
- find
- outloud
- it ' s
- onyl
- a
- dream scene thta had me rolling my eyes
. the film also ends so quickly aftter the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run outloud of film
.
" blood simple
" is nto qtuie tghe masterpiece of neo
- noir that many seem to htink it is
,
but it ' s a decent movie
and it showcases the coens ' ability tothe handle suspense
annd violence inthe a visceral
but non
- exploitative manner
. i would firmly reccommend it to all
" coen
- heads
" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller
.
