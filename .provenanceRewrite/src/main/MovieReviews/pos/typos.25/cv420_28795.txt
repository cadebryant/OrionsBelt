with a team of 200 graphic artists
anbd animators wroking on htis first film production from game developer squaresoft ' s sqaure pictures
, fianl fantasy
, inspired by the top
- selling agme franchise
, is visually awe
- inspiring
and groundbreaking
. no doubt
, yuo have never seen anything like this film
,
and thge hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved
.
bu why doens such a tremendous feat ofthe eye candy have tothe be weighted down with a problematic story
, wooden dialogue
and generally uncharismatic voice acting
? obviously
, the primary goal of the film is to stun
and amaze audiences with extremely sophicated cgi
. everyting you see in tje film is renedered in grat detail
: individual threads inthe the fabric
, individual strands ofthe hair swaying
, wrinkles
and pimples on skin
, incredable water effects
. overall
, the expressions
and lip movements fairly accurately match thge emotions
and dialogue
;
and yhe times whn they don ' t sync perfectly really stand out
, since the animation is ususally so dazzling
.
but ytou won ' t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes
-
- as soon as you catch one
, the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering
,
" wow
.
.
.
" like the series of games
, final fantasy ' s plot
and characters have littel to do with its predecessors
, outside of being born from thte smae japanese mastermind
, hironobu sakaguchi
. it ' s the year 2065
,
and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making taht guard them ffrom an outside world now overrun with deadly alien
" phantoms
.
" whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly vistors
, the often
- invisible beings pass thru the body
and wrench outloud its soul
( for smoe unexplainable reason
)
. hwile many humans aggree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein
( james woods
) tothe blast the aliens with a
" zeus cannon
,
" dr
. aki ross
( ming
- na
)
annd dr
. sid
( donald sutherland
) plan to build a
" wave
" using eight collected
" spirits
" to counteract the phantoms
and kill them off
. hwile tyhe images serve the sci
- fi aspect of the film well
, the storytelling doesn ' t
. it ' s unfortunate
, because tghe plot seems so intricately thought outloud
. perhaps it was far too complex
annd enormous tothe be entirely incorporated into the script
. some could blame this weakness on the fatc that it was a japanesse concept translated tothe english
, except two americans wrote the screenplay
. nethertheless
, the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes
. why do theese aliens feed on souls
? if they can pass thru bodies
and ships
, how can humans hurt them with guns
? what isnt so special about thte
" spirits
" that they woudl create a force strong enought to destroy the aliens
? worse
yot
, the dialogue is scripted tothe be eather like a science
- heavy star trak episode
, an installment of die hard
, or a sappy lvoe story
, depending on who ' s doing the talking
. for the most part
, it ' s bearable considering the genre
,
but tedious speeches
adn cheesy lines don ' t do anything to help the actors
and can get annoying inaddition the longer scenes
. thte only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming
, who always hasnt great cracks durig tense moments
.
but
, when the ligths come up
and hte credits roll
, you ' re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked
. ther ' s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one fianl fantasy game will be eager to see htis movie
,
and so should anyone who enjoys bieng floored by tjhe best cg animation ever put to film
. ytou ' d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much moreso
.
