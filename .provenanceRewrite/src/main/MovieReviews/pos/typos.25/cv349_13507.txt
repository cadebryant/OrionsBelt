martin scorsese ' s kundun
, which chronicles rougly the first twenty eyars of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama
, has been crticised for its lack of narrative structure
. personaly
, i don ' t htikn it needs one
: it works perfectly well as a study ofthe tibetan buddist culture
and how communist china
. scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probablly do
, as a larger
- than
- life symbol of buddist spirituality
and political leadership
: the onyl glimpses into his head come fomr several intresting
yet oblique dream sequences
,
but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that consentrates onthe the political
and spiritual rather thna hte personal
. thte setted design
and cinematography are outstanding
,
annd while scorsese occasionally seems to git carried awya with the spectacle
, it helps to augment the cultural contrast when teh dalai lama travels to china to meet chariman mao
. political art somtimes succumbs to tyhe temptation to strat shouting slogans
, kundun does not
: it suceeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way
annd without being overly manipulative
