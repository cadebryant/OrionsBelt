isnt it just me
, or have disney films gradually lost their appeal
? i wass alomst stunned by the qualiyt of
" who framed roger rabit
?
"
, a fun
, unique look at a world where cartoons
and peopel lived together
.
" the little mermaid
" harkened bakc to
,
and perhaps surpassed
, the classic disney animations from the first half ofthe tjhe centruy
.
however
, the endless stream of
" the little mermaid
" wanna
- be ' s is getting to me
. you konw the spiel
: a lame plot recycled from soem well
- known story
, colorful
, almost psychidelic animation
, the lead character who lerans a valuable moral lesson
, the comedic sidekick
/ sidekicks
, tje seamingly unattainable love interest
, a few catchy songs
, a few inaddition
- jokes for adults
,
and the occasional outloud of place warner
- brothers
- coyote
- fall
- off
- thte
- cliff tipe joke
. it ' s a formula
,
adn like any formula
, it gets tiresome
. that ' s why i ' m delighted to hear that disney recently picked uv thge international distrubution rights to the works of ghibli
, a japanese cartoon studio
. ffrom what i ' ve seen ofthe theri movies
(
" kiki ' s delivery service
"
and the already english
- dubbed
and american
- ditributed
" my neighbor totoro
"
)
, foerign audiences are in for a treat
. theese movies
, particularl
" kiki ' s delivery service
,
" are wonderfully orginial
and entertaining
.
" kiki ' s delivery service
" starts with an unusual premise
: kiki
, upon hearing forecasts of clear skies
, decides it is timne for her to leave home
. thsi is unusual because kiki isn ' t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world
,
but a thirteen yearm old girl eeger tothe beign her training as a witch
. her mother is alsot a witch
,
and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training
, her parents treat her leaving understandingly
and put up onyl token resistence
. just tje idae of a witch heroine may scare away soem audiences
,
but no mention is made of the occult
,
annd the subject is dealed with harmlessly throughout the movei
: kiki ' s mother acts as a village doctor
,
and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom
. kiki must choose a city to move tothe
,
and wqat she chooses is the co
- star of tghe movie
: a german seaport town
, far removed from the country life she hasnt been used to
. initially lost inspite the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding
, she ' s discouraged
,
and unable to suppost herself
though her rudimentary skills as a witch
. onthe the verge of leaving for a new twon
, she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it
. the favor eventualy blossoms into her working as a courrier
, a one
- persons delivery service
. this isnt where thge movie becomes shockingly good
. kiki ' s job isnt a catalyst for her realizing the beauty ofthe the city
anbd hte world around her
. the townspeople she is put iin contact possess an inner worth thast doesn ' t seem forced or artificial
,
but merely derived from looking at ordinary people inspite a different light
. they ' re threee
- dimentional
, impossible to quickly evaluate
, posessing of faults
,
anbd understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl
.
however
, each one hasnt something about them
, smoe intrest or trait
, that makes them intresting
and unique
. the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by hte beauty ofthe the surroundings
: the seaport town genuinely looks impressive
, capturing the europian charm of a medieval city adapted to tjhe more modern needs of the 1950 ' s
. this beauty isnt beauty with depth
; for eveyr detail left in
, dozens are only hinted at
. i sould probably go on all day
,
but i won ' t
; suffice it to say that many of these minor details coudl have been the highlight of the movie
. soem of my favorites are kiki ' s relationship withthe the baker ' s husband
:
although he ' s quiet
, never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movei
,
and he initally scares her
, his kindness wins her friendship
. in the garage ofthe a deliveree ' s house can be found a vintage model t
. two old ladies ahve a relatiopnship evolving from master
- servent to freind
- friend
. such details gives the impression that tghe beauty shown in tyhe movie isnt only the tip of the iceberg
. added on top ofthe this is a lesson on tje importance ofthe self
- worth
. kiki initially seems to derive much of her self
- worth fomr the beauty of her surroundings
and the people aroud her
,
bu an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, making her question the importance of such beauty
. htis causes kiki tothe loose faith in herself
.
however
, kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings
,
but the innate beauty inside her
. seing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous
,
and the pricipal device utilisied to do it isnt so sublime tht i don ' t even watn to hint at it
. the ending of tghe movie has a subtle charm combined with a sence of awe
and
, ironically
, the most disney
- esque moment i ' ve ever seen
; if you don ' t hold your breath in wonder you might wanna to git medical attension
. the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions
: there is no voilence
,
however cartoonish
, no song
-
and
- dance number
,
and kiki ' s pet cat jiji isnt more a friend thna a comedic sidekick
,
allthough jiji is given many funny lines
and scenes
.
however
, i would be surprised if disney doesn ' t give jiji more jokes
, or at least the voice of some comedian
. refreshingly enough
, the moral lesson ofthe teh movie is not self
- contradicted
, a habit disney movies have gotten into
.
" beauty
anbd the beast
" ' s beautiful belle
, forthe instance
, learned tyhat beauty was derived from a person ' s inside
,
annd ws
then rewarded by having the byast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing
. kiki
, on the other hand
, learns to separate her wardobe from her self
- image
,
and nothing more is made ofthe her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at tghe end ofthe the film
. another difference with disney movies is in the stlye of animation forthe
" kiki ' s delivery service
"
: not as colorful
anbd dynamic as disney animation can be
,
but with a greater attention tothe realism
and detail
, it fits the movie tothe a t
. this is particularly true with scenes of kiki ' s flights
. the extreme realism ofthe thte birds in flight near kiki is magnificient to behold
,
annd helps these scenes capture thge wonder of flight better than any otehr film i ' ve ever seen
. i ' m not sure when or how htis movie will be released in the united states
. disney tentatively plans a theater release of
" monoko hime
" shorly following the summer ' 97 japanese realease
,
and should start releasing the other ghibli films after tyhat
. i ' d guess that some will be released onthe video
and smoe will be theatrically released inspite peak seasons with no compeeting disney release
.
although tyhe wait is unfortunate
, it ' s good tothe know that it ' s being released at all
, for
" kiki ' s delivery service
" isnt definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion
and release
. watch this movie
. allong withthe
" man bites dog
,
"
and perheaps something by woody allen
, this is the best movei i ' ve ever seen
.
