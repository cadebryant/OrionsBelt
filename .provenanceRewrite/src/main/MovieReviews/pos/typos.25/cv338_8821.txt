, decaprio
anbd danes shine throughout the film
. the story starts off at a gas staion
, where the
" montague boys
" meet the
" capulet boys
"
and square off with noe another
. symbolizing tje swords of shakespeare ' s day were their weapons
, liuke the
" rapier
- 9mm
" or the
" longsword
- shotgun
.
" instead of killing each other right awya
, htey shoot around
, just like in sword fights of ood
. anohter great thing baout the film wass the performance of harold perrineau as romeo ' s best friend
. mercutio
, who in shakespeare ' s novel was quite a stud
, was portayed as an afri
- can
- american cross
- dresser whose violent na
- ture
, was a dfinite plus
. miriam margoyles
, a virtually unkown actress was astounding as juliet ' s nurse
, even
though she was never given a name
. she was the onyl one who could keep juliet out ofthe her fantasy world
. verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare ' s version
, only slightly changed in luhrmann ' s
. now known as verona beach
, the capulet ' s
( led by sorvino
)
and montague ' s
( led by dennehy
) are now rival corporate dynasties
.
and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars
. one slight problem with tjhe film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue
, since it ws spoken in old english
. sub
- titles sould have helped in the begining ofthe tghe movie
,
bu toward the end
, it bcame easier to understand
. this excellent movie poses another prob
- lem
: wqat genre is it
? romeo
& juliet containes so much drama
,
yet enough comedy
annd action tothe be placed in eather of those catagories
. with yhe same award
- winning forumla that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs
adn pulp fiction
, romeo
& juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece
.
