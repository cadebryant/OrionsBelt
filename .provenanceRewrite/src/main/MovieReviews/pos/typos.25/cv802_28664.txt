tyhe coen brothers are bakc again
, this tiem with homer ' s
" odyssey
" as the backdrop in their tale of threee fugitives fomr a missisipi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" right for thge beginning of
" o brother
" the coens grab your attention wtih a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along tje road in unison to a work song
. the camera flows around the hard toiling men
, giving a visually exciting symetry to thte scene tht ends whith our threee heroes
- ulysses everett mcgill
( george clooney
)
, delmar
( tim blake nelson
)
and pete
( john turturro
)
- escaping across a cotton field
. it isnt the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings
and urgencies to each member of tjhe trio
. a storng suite
, as always with the coen brothers
, is the depth ofthe character of the folks they create in their films
. their characters are goofy
and comical
, like nicolas cage in
" raising arizona
"
; or
, dramatic
, as albert finney
anbd john turturro in
" miller ' s crossing
"
;
and
, even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in
" fargo
.
" in all cases
,
and in
" o brother
,
" too
, tghe characters populatin theri films are three
- dimensional people
. ulysses everett isnt a handsome
, hair
- obsessed petty criminal with a silver tounge
annd not a lot in the brains deparment
.
bu
, he seems like a genius whn compared to the simple
, sweet delmar
and the maladjusted pete
, who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of
$ 1
. 2 million
. their odessy takes onthe the mystical proportions of homer ' s original material as they meet all manner of peple along the way
, including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals
and a cyclops who beats them
and takes all their mnoey
. ther is magic
, too
, when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens
. tyhe stoyr meanders through thge different vignettes of the boys ' adventures
, giving the flick a choppy
, episodic feel taht disrupts the overall flow
. some ofthe the interludes are an epiphany
,
though
. hte trio becomes a quartet when tehy pick up guitar
- playing tommy johnson
( chris thomas king
)
annd viit a radio staion in thge middle of nowhere
, run by its blind owner
( stephen root
)
. they become thte soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man
and
, without their knowledge
, are recoreded as they sing the traditionnal tune
,
" i am a man of constant sorrow
.
" it is a wonderfull moent of moviemaking
and gives us
, in my mind
, the best movie song of the year
. contrasting this
and other wonderfull moments
( the sexy seduction by hte sirens comes to mind
) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of
" o brother
.
" inthe particular
, near the end
, is a scene where ulysses
, delmar
and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched
. the scene isnt overblown
and flashy
and reeks of
" tjhe wizard ofthe oz
.
" they don ' t say
" lions
and tigers
and bears
, oh my
!
"
and htere ' s no dorothy
,
but it is the land of oz we ' re seeing here
. the highs
and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels
. george clooney is funny
, charming
, a littel dumb
and noe of the handsomest actors in the business today
. he has hte charm of a 30 ' s movei idol
and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity
. ulysses has an ongoing obession with his hair
, risking life
and limb to git a parituclar brand ofthe pomade
and a suply ofthe hairnets
. his vanity wiull come tothe plague him as it would any mystical hero
- wanderer
. while clooney is tyhe name draw for
" o brother
,
" the sohw stealer isnt tim blake nelson as delmar
. the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who
, at one point
, hears tyhe owrd ofthe tje lord
anbd joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism
. delmar is saved
adn dedicates his life to doing ogod
and provides a richness tothe his simple character that makes him shine
. the taciturn pete
, as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro
, is the sullen member of the trio
and gives them tghe necessary angst
. all together
, the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of tyhe three stooges
and thte three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons
, albeit brave ones
. the colorful supporting cast isnt rampant with homerian characters tothe meet
adn git to know along the way of yhe boys ' odyssey
. charles durning appears as incumbent gouvener pappy o ' daniel
, who keeps crossing paths with them inaddition his bid for re
- election
. john goodman is wicked as tghe noe
- eyed bible salesman
and con artist
, big dan teague
. michael badalucco is manic
anbd outrageous as outlaw
adn bank robber extraordinary
, george
" babyface
" nelson
. stephen root is amusing as tyhe blind dj
, rep ' ing one ofthe the many references to the sightless that abound iin the film in mystical ways
. holly hunter is wasted in yhe small role as ulysses ' estranged wife
, penny
(
and thge rela reason for thsi adventure
, not secret treasure
)
. techs are
, as expected in a coen brothers venture
, first class
. cinematographer roger deakins
, who hasnt worked onthe five previous coen films
, captures the sultry atmosphere of the sourth
. the photography complements the lush period production
and costume provided by dennis gassner
and mary zophres
, respectively
. once again
, roderick jaynes
- the alter ego ofthe ethan
anbd joel coen
- is on board as editor
. thte high points outweigh the low through most of
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" whith particular praise for the wonderful selction of period
and traditionnal music
. i give it a b
.
