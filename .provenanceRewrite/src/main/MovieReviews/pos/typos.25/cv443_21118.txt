' lake placid ' is definately not your tipical creature attacking people movei
, ok so maybe it is
,
bu this one is enjoyable
,
and clever
. actually it comes off more of a comedy tahn a horror film
. well tjhe ending is kinda scary
,
but in most horror
/ comedies htey are
. i will admited that ' lake placid ' isn ' t an oscar worthy film
,
but it doesnt come off as an inventive movie that is original
and funny
. bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating
, is forced to go to lake placid
and investigate a tooth
, after a man is bit in half
. she gets there
but really doesn ' t understand why she is there
. bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened
, along with yhe sherriff
adn a rich croc obssessed man
, tehy go out
and fidn what is going on
. waht they find
though isn ' t great
. a huge
anbd i mean huge crocodile isnt living in lake placid
, over 150 years ood
, he has migrated here for who knows why
. they have tothe fight agains the croc
annd try to trap him so they can study him
and see where he came from
. betty white plays a woman who lives onthe the shores of lake placid
,
and well you ' ll ahve to see the movie to fidn outloud
. her charater is very funny
and foul
- mouthed
, wich is surprising to hear betty spew words
and phrases that are preety bad
,
but funny
. to me tyhe movie came off as a spoof of jaws
. with the oppening sequence
,
and soem others
, it isnt not original
anbd isnt
. wehn you watch this movie
, you definately notice yhe smartness
and cleverness of it
. david e
. kelly who is the mastermind of hte pratice
annd ally mcbeal
, writes htis movie with ease
and surprisingly does a great job
. the characters have smartmouths
, two foul
,
and soem great one
- liners
.
but believe me
, don ' t take ' lake placid ' too seriously or you won ' t like it
.
but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a funn ' popcorn ' type movie
.
bu i guess it rates above hte ' popcorn ' rating
. sit back
, watch the movie
, laugh
, scream
,
and whatever you want
. even
though the movie isnt r
,
anbd i put violence
and gore
. there ' s raelly not that much gore
,
but what there is might seem kinda gross tothe smoe
. ' lake placid ' is a smart
, clever
, funny
,
anbd scary movei taht i enjoyed
anbd i thiunk you will too
.
