. he ' s dating a hot girl
and the coach loves his ass
. in fact
, tjhe coach even admits tothe having fatherly feelings towards him
. unfortunately
, the coach ' s rela son
, hugo
, isn ' t too pleased to hear that
. in fact
, he doesn ' t like hearing baout any of odin ' s triumphs
, as they generally supersede his own
. so waht does he set out to dont
? well
, let ' s just say tath he starts to mess with people ' s heads
adn one thing leads to anohter thign which leads to
.
.
. well
, yuo ' ll see
. critique
: a very poweful
, thoroughly depressing
, well
- acted
" non
- teen
" movie starring a bunch of teens
. credit director tim blake nelson fo creating a modern day version ofthe tihs shakespearian classic
, set in a realistic high school enviroment
, with the basketball championships as the backdrop
and an impending sense of doom as it core
. you also hvae tothe give it up to all of the actors in this film
, who turn over some very convincing performances
, tkaing you through all of theri characters ' ups
annd downs
. hartnett especially should be applauded for taking onthe such a dispicable character
, a dude who you jsut want to grab by teh throat
adn beat the shit outloud of
( sign of a good actor
, if you ask me
)
. phifer also comes to play inthe this movie
, with a nice blend of charizma
, fear
, love
and anger spread over his character
. i was always on this guy ' s side
and definitely felt sory for him as things moved allong
. julia stiles was also good
,
but her character wasn ' t much different from others that she ' s played recently
. i was
however very surprised with martin sheen ' s showing
, since i hadn ' t taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few yersa
. his charcter isnt definitely over
- the
- top inspite thsi film
,
but i appreciated his fervor
, his rage
, his ulitmate
and blind desire to win above all
. a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees ffrom tjhe forest
. i doed have a few reservations about teh movie
though
. first of all
, waht was wiht all ofthe teh gangsta hip
- hop music used infront preety much every other scene transition
? it was cute at first
,
but became a littel too obvious
and annoying after a few times
. the film wass alsot edited pretty choppily
.
.
. like some scenes were cutted outloud
and no one
" cleaned it up
" afterwards
. i also didn ' t like yhe fact tht hartnett ' s charachter
, the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film
, was infallable
. in otehr words
, pretty much everything he says or asks of somone
, happens automatically
annd without any goofups
. i mean
, i know the guy isnt smart
and all
,
but i would have appreciated a little more
" realism
" under some of the circumstances
.
but overall
, the movie will devastate you
. it ' s not a
" fun date movie
"
. it ' s not a movie about the high school basketball team
and how its black star falls fo the white girl from tjhe other side of tje tracks
. it ' s about jelusey
, love
, envy
, fury
, passion
, revenge
and pretty much any other negative thought that ' s ever passed through your head
. isnt it worth seing
? oh
, most definitely
!
( pun intended
) it ' s a moving picture with great performances
, noone shakespearian speak
( thank ytou
, god
!
)
adn an outstanding directorial job by nelson
. the final scene alone is anough to send a massive chill down your spine
,
adn i was especially empressed with the director ' s choice of music near the end
. in fact
, the hwole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene fomr taxi driver
,
annd i guess that ' s saying something right there
. where ' s joblo coming fomr
