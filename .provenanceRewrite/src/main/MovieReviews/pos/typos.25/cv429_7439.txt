- time film director tom hanks
, isnt an enjoyable tale about a fictional band
, the wonders
, that goes fomr a garage band to the band wiht the fastest selling album in the country
.
but
, the question arrises
, will the seduction of fame
and fortune corrupt the band
anbd lead them to become just another one
- hit wonder
, or will they stick toghether
and become the next teen sensations
? the
" oneders
"
, as tehy are originaly known
, hve their first gig at a very small
- timne contest
. jimmy
, the lead singer
, has writed a catchy song
and intends to play it at the contest

, a short tiem before the contest beggins
, the current drummer becomes injured
and a relpacement is needed
. enter guy patterson
, skilled musician who currently works at his father ' s appliance sotre
annd isnt looking to break free from the restricting clutches thast bind him
. he seems tothe fit inspite well
, untill the group tkaes the stage
. when they begin to play
, guy ' s beated is much too fast
and hte pace is way off for the intended song
. it looks as
though thge group is doomed to failure
.
but
, the
" new
" song is a hit
! this leads to anohter gig
,
and soon enough
, the group has an agent
. he doesn ' t dont too much for them
,
bu they do git theri song played onthe tghe radio
. eventually
, mr
. white ofthe playtone records approachs the gropu
,
and he informs them that they want to release a rocord
. befor you cin say
" billboard
"
, teh band is now renamed
" the wonders
"
and tghe members are speeding thier way to fame
. the gigs are getting better
, their fame isnt increasing
,
and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records histoyr
. tyhe band is invited to apeared in a feature film
,
and
, they
then fli out tothe hollywood tothe appear on televsion
. after the appearance onthe television
, things start tothe fall apart
. two of the members of the band preety much disappear
,
and things are not working out well vetween jimmy
and guy
. will the band work it out
, or will they split up
annd go on thier own sepaarte journeys towords success
? that thing you do
!
, complete with a nifty orignal song that actually sounded authentic
, is a fun
and enjoyable movie thyat
,
although it doesn ' t become clear if it wants to be a comedy
, drama
, or romance
, is a well
- made look into the world ofthe music
. tom hanks ' directorial debut was a good one
and should lead to more wrok for him
