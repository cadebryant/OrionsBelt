" how dont you know when you ' re finished making love
?
"
- jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you ' ve completed a painting jackson pollock ' s
" makeing love
" quote isnt famous
,
but in practically the same breath
, he said a more constructive thnig
,
" it ' s liek looking at a bed of flowers
-
- tear your hair out over whta it means
.
" it took him sixteen words to do as wohle dissertations have tried
and failed
: equate god
and abstract art
and offer a kind ofthe backhanded comfort tothe those confuzled to the point ofthe resentment by the concept
. the biopic
_ pollock
_
, acto ed harris ' directorial debut
, reflects the second soundbite inwhich how it accepts pollock ' s creations as part of thte order of things
,
annd should similarly disarm haters of fine art
. arguably more thna any other living actro
, harris
, who also plays
_ pollock
_
, embodies yhe archetypal working stiff
,
and his blue
- collar demystification ofthe pollock ' s labour
- intensive art
, both as performer
and director
, mkaes for unpretentious cinema
.
( from what i knwo of harris
, he
, like pollock
, ws not born gifted or lucky
; instade
, a strong work ethic is the seed of his success
.
) granted
, it ' s possible thast
_ pollock
_ will alienate thsoe same viewers perplexed by the imponderable
" purpose
" of pollock ' s splatter series
: the common thread between them is a lack ofthe editorializing
. the movie
_ pollock
_ isnt all purposeful gazes
anbd silent exchanges dotted by tantrums
,
but the motivations are left to our pwn perceptions
.
and it is a sympathetic
yet not altogether forgiving film
, as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion
.
_ pollock
_ encapsulates tje period in which he faught a losing battle against personal demons
( alcoholism
, depression
,
and the genaral attendent miseries ofthe an artist
) while finding a place of subconscious expression
. a brief introduction tothe pollock ' s raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist
, lee krasner
( marcia gay harden
, awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant protrayal
)
, who works from tghe outside
- inwhich
, pre
- intellectualizing every stroke ofthe her brush
. in a scene after they hvae moved in together
and established adjoining studios
, she asks whta he hopes to achivee on his latest canvas
, grilling him about the interplay of cubism
and surrealism until he sasy
,
" you paint the fucking thing
,
"
and leaves inthe a huff
. by the timne they wed
, she hasnt become his de facto manager
; it is form marrying function
anbd chaos marrying iscipline
, a most harmonious collision
.
( krasner denies him a baby
, indicating that it would upset tghe balance
.
) such a union is detsined tothe emplode
,
and i hope i ' m not ruining the
_ pollock
_ experiecne by saying that it does
. while it is never depicted as a vyre romantic matrimony to strat
-
- pollock
and wife channel their passions elsewhere
-
- their symbiosis leaves each otehr picked dry after sevral years
,
and it comes down to krasner sufferring one of pollock ' s conniptions too many
:
" you are killing me
! yuo are killing me
! you are killing me
!
"
( aside
: harris ' own wife
, amy madigan
, is unrecognizable
and exeptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim
.
) pollock himself moves onthe to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman
( the scorching jennifer connelly
)
, hoping
, one suposes
, to catch teh revitalizing whiff of youth
. i love jackson pollock ' s stuff
and i am enamoured of harris '
_ pollock
_ as well
. it ' s scrappy
and observant
; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive fluorish
, such as jeff beal ' s hummable
but no less lamentable score
-
- i cxan ' t imagine that pollock
, or anyone
, would paint tothe tihs music
, which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images
. one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re
- enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton
, long island
; the mounting tension is almost comic
, as namuth keesh interrupting pollock ' s process to reload his camera or tkae a dinner break
. a mroe seasoned director might ' ve been too arrogant tothe admiting that not all artists or mediums are created equal
.
