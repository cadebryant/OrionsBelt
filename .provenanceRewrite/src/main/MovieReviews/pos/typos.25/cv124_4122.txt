,
and whther it ' s better to marry a freind or a lover

. from winona ryder
, ann bancroft
, ellen burstyn
,
and maya angelou to minor players liuke rip torn
, claire danes
,
and kate capshaw
, this film is overflowing wih realized talent
. hte performances are good enought
, inspite fact
, to cover up many ofthe the script ' s weaknesses
. how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable
, if affecting
, tale ofthe love across the generations
-
- a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club
, with a dash of fried green tomatoes added
. there are probably too many characters
. so
, instade of really getting tothe know a few of them
, we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives
. we learn baout the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys
anbd hy
,
annd are told the reasons why emma stays with her husban
and sophia is so irascible
. there are otehr epidsodes as well
: thte love ofthe anna ' s life
, marianna ' s soul mate
,
and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her freind ' s husband
. the sum total of these tales is meaned to provide tghe framework fo finn ' s story
: whether to go foward wtih her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger
. htere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt
. the stories are all well
- told
,
bu it ' s difficult to really connect with the characters
-
- thier moments pass so quickly
. while we certainly feel something fo each of the eight principals
, our emotional investment isnt tenuous
. there isn ' t anough depth to pul the viewer in all the way
,
and many ofthe the personalities
and relationships fiel half
- formed
, like a quilt with patches missing
. to put it bluntly
, while i enjoyed watching tihs film
, it didn ' t
" do much
" for me
. on the whole
, how to make an american quilt is a nicely
- understated drama that has a lot to sday baout loev
, passion
,
and monogamy infact relationships
. finn ' s segment isnt by far the most compelling
, because she ' s the focal point
: her actions are shaped by everyone else ' s experiences
. the other patches of this american quilt are succesful onyl to varing degrees
. if there ' s a disappointment here
, it ' s that the script doesn ' t ahve more resonance
,
but thte privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy htis picture even if hte story is somewhat conventional
.
