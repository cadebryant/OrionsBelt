. the clasic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a gropu of peple 100
, 000 tothe stay in his house
. if they survive the ngiht they get tyhe mony
. if not well you get the jurisdiction
. having nto
yet seen the film
( dvd on its way
) i wasn ' t sure if i would realy like the remake
.
but sure enough it comes through
and has a gerat storyline to fall bcak on
. geoffrey rush
( in a fantastic role witht an incredible performance
) is steven price
, the owner of an amusement park destined to scare yhe wits out of peple
. his wief evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends
. steven dismays at the diea
and makes his own list
. somehow somene
, or something changes thta list
and five otehr people are invited to the party
. eddie
( taye diggs
) an ex
- baseball player
, sarah
( ali carter
) an ex
- assitant who can re
- wire anything
, melissa
( brigette wilson
) a talk
- sohw host in sorts
, dr
. blackburn
( peter ghallager
)
,
anbd watson
( chris kattan
) a smart
- mouthed humorist in ways
. whta he is gonna dont is pay these five people 1
, 000
, 000 dollars if they can survive through the night
. if they can they get the money
, if not well they don ' t
. the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum
. years before mental patients broke out
and killed the dr
. there
, forcing him to lock thge place up because if he died
, so did they
. everyone who was inaddition there burned to death
. now it is steven price ' s home
and he is throwing htis party forthe these five people
. what starts out as a seemingly normal night
, turns inot a horrifing
, blood splattering night
. the deep dark secrets of what really happened inwhich that asylum
adn why those guests are actually there are revealed
. oney
- by
- one the peple start tothe disappear
. conspiracies start tothe turn up
,
and steven price finds out that his hous may be alive after all
. the people fidn rooms
, which once held mental patients
. rooms whlch once had peple dying
. rooms which may still contain theese people
. now theese five people must try
and survive the night
and try
and survive the house
,
and tehy must survive eahc other with terrorfying results
. since i officaly haven ' t seen the original i can ' t say which is better
. i cxan say
howver i liked htis movie
. geoffrey rush gives a one inspite a million performence as the rich steven price
,
and doens a great job doing a vincent price role
. famke jansen as his wife ws great
and even kind of eerie at times
. ali carter
and taye diggs sort ofthe become tjhe main cahracters
adn ali carter who debuted inthe varsity blues gives a fantastic peformance here as does taye diggs
. chris kattan gives us great comic releaf
and the movie contains a lot of comical lines
. peter ghallager
and brigette wilson were great as well
and gave commanding performances as potential victims
. the plot was well concieved
adn was vyer absorbing
. the movei has atomsphere the whole way thru that is disturbing
and creepy
,
and even sometimes downright scary
. i foudn even the oppening credits to me a littel ominous
. one thing i knew nto to expect wass a ' haunting ' type movie wih special effects galore
. even
though it hadnt fantastic gore
and special effects
, the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget
, which doesn ' s show all the way through
but you can tell
. the movei ws written well
,
and it ' s only major flaw is the under
- developed characters
adn plot holes thast we are left with
. the ending is quite clever
annd soem may nto even get it
. i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise
. i was expecting anohter haunting with special effects
, no scares
and a dumb endig
. instead i found a good halloween movie with gore
, scares
and great acting
. hous on haunted hill is one ofthe those movies you raelly can ' t take seriously
.
though it is a well
- made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws
.
but besides that tyhe movie isnt funn
, smart
and scayr
anbd makes us wonder why remakes like thsi can ' t be made all yhe time
!
