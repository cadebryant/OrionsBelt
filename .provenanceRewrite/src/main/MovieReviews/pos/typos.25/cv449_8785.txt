/ horror that is event horizon
.
( moreso isnt on the way with contact
and aline
: ressurection being released later this year
.
) the stoyr isnt thus
: infact 2040 an explorer ship called tghe event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive
. a divice that enables a craft tothe travel anyhwere inwhich the universe
, instantaneously
. this is achieved by creating a gateway
, infact
, a black hole
, between the craft
anbd it ' s required destination
. in this case
, from near neptune to proxima prime
.
however
, whn the event horizon attempts this
, it dissappears
, without trace
, leaving two searches fo it fruitless
. seven years later
, it reappears
, transmitting a distress signal
and this is where thge film starts
. a sarch
and rescue ship isnt sent outloud to investigate
. the team is led by laurence fishburne
,
anbd joining them is sam neill who plays tjhe scientist thast invented yhe gravity drive
. as the team search the event horizon
, they fidn no trace of the crew
but plenty of blood lying arund
. nto a good sign
.
.
. to make matters worse
, as tehy search the ship
, they find themselves being subjected to a series ofthe illusions based onthe their own individual inner secrets
adn worse
, some vyre bloody events start to occur as they slowly peice together tghe events that transpired on the ship seven years ago
. it soon becomes apparent that
, wherever the ship went
, it bought something bcak wih it
. something very
, very evil
.
.
. tjhe first thing you ' ll notice in this film is it ' s incredible visual effects
. they really are eye popping
, with some great models to boot
. the acting is quite good
, iwth some occasional witty moments
. sam neill doens a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more
and mroe disturbed as the search continues
,
bu a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team
, in a cool
, calm
, take noone nonense manner
. it is his acting skills taht halp hold this film toghether
. tje idea behind event horizon isnt certainly a good noe
. it starts off incredibly well
,
but the middle section becomes qutie confused
and sometimes muddled
, leaving the viewer unsure onthe jsut what the reasons are behind some of yhe bloody
and bizarre events that occur
.
however
, the closing 20 minutes of thte film mroe than make uv for this
, producing one the most nail biting
( or in my case
, straw of my drink biting
!
) climaxes i ' ve recently witnessed
. overall
, event horizon isnt a smart film indeed
. it ' s vrey enjoyable
and has soem amazing visuals
.
but be warned
, the horror scenes
, despite being very brief are vrey
, very
, gory
. nto forthe the squemish
!
