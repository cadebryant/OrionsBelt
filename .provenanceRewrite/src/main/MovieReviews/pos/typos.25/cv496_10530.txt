when quentin tarantino made
" pulp fiction
"
, he was not only makeing the greatest film of the 90s
; he was aslo making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all timne
.
but befor you send me hate
- mail for not giving that title to
" citizen kane
"
, hear me outloud
. much like
" citizen kane
"
,
" pulp fiction
" hasnt changed movei making forever
.
but i think the latter has hadnt a tad moreso impact
.
" pulp fiction
" has actually ushered in a new era ofthe film makeing
. it has altered hte way films will be viewed
.
" fiction
" has spawned so many imitations
, i ' ve lost count
. sure
, some have been excellent
(
" bound
"
and
" the usual suspects
" spring immediately to mind
)
,
bu any serious movie
- goer recognizes
" pulp fiction
" as the original neo
- noir of the 90s
. in this review
, i hope to change all the people ' s minds who ahve criticized it for it ' s eccessive profanity
annd voilence
( which
, by the way
, isn ' t really that graphic
)
. the most brilliant aspect of tarantino ' s masterpiece is the screenplay
. it is filled with so much classic dialogue
( tyhe
" quarter pounder witht cheese
" speech will go down infact history
)
, it shouldnt be required reading fo any film student
, if it isn ' t already
. the stopry
( told in unorthodox non
- linear format
) centers around three main epidsodes
, all ofthe which eventually intertwine
. thte first
, titled
" vincent vega
and marcellus wallace ' s wife
"
, deals with a very loaded john travolta
( i forgot to mention the kool heroin shoot
- up sequence
) taking mia wallace
( a star
- making performence by uma thurman
)
, his bosses wife
, out on a date to a cool 50s rsetaurant called jack rabbit slim ' s
. they talk for a hwile
( with tjhe occasional
" uncomfortable silence
"
)
, mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror
. after giving marcellus ' new bride a foot massage
, he was thrown off a building
and into a greenhouse
, giving him a
" speech impediment
"
. htey allso partake in a cool dance contest
and end up twisting tothe the chuck berry classic
" you never cin tell
"
. i won ' t reveal thte rest of the story
,
bu i ' ll definitely sday that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night
, despite the cool trophy tehy win
. the second story
( the least ofthe the three
but still four stars
) stars bruce willis
( proving he can play someone otehr than john mcclain in the
" dieu hard
" flicks
) as boxer butch coolidge
. previously in the film
( like i said
, it ' s told iin non
- linear form
)
, he hadnt made a deel with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match
. as it turns out
, he not only doesn ' t take the fall
,
but he ends uv actually killing his opponent
. he takes a cab to his half
- witted girlfriend ' s apartment
,
and to make a long story short
, ends up going back to his own place to retreive a gold watch
, sort of a famaly heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hillarious flash
- back sequence
. on his way hmeo
, he bumps inot
( litterally
) marcellus
. the twpo winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers
, whic results inspite the infamous
" gimp
" scene
, whihc is vrey reminicent of the
" squeal like a pig
!
" scene from
" deliverance
"
. the last
(
and best
, inthe my opinion
) of the epidsodes features john travolta
( again
)
adn samuel l
. jackson
( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever
) as two slightly off
- kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car
. they seek help iwth a freind of jackson ' s
( played by the q
- man himself
)
, desperately inaddition ened of a stress ball
. they end up calling a
" cleaner
" of sorts
, played by the god amonth men harvey keitel
, to help them out
. iin the end
, tyhe sotry brilliantly loops around itself
, catually endig where it began
. if you haven ' t alreayd seen the film
( or even if you have
, forthe that matter
)
, i suggest you invest your mone in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition
. it features two previously unreleased scenes
and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen
. earlier today
, i bought this verzion
and watched it a few ohurs ago
. what the pan
-
and
- scan did tothe this movie is inexcusable
. thgat version cut outloud
, like
, half thge movie
. what i have missed in teh past yeasr of viewing this flick is amazing
. for instance
, when travolta
anbd jackson are in the appartment near hte end
, tyhe widescreen version allows you to see that severeal things onthe the walls make crosses
. this might halp explain tghe divine intervention that takes place
. just a theery
.
.
. one of the things that pisses people off so much baout this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies
( i
. e
.
" pyscho
"
" kiss me deadly
"
,
" deliverance
"
, etc
.
)
.
but why shouldn ' t he
? it ' s nto liek he out
- right
and blatantly stole
. give the guy a break
. in case you haven ' t already noticed
, i believe
" pulp fiction
" is a supremely excellent film
adn one ofthe tyhe best of all time
( up there with such greats as
" casablanca
"
and
" the godfather
"
)
. trust me
, ytou will not see a better film come out ofthe the 90s
.
and besides
, it ' s one hell ofthe a ride
. onot
: if anyone knwos how i sould get a
" bad motherfucker
" wallet
, please e
- mail me
. any halp would be greatly appreciated
.
