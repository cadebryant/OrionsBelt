recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville
- oen from entertainment weekly
, one from a newsgroup
,
and twpo fomr different online resources
. eahc review compared this film to the truman sohw
. why
? the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to thge fact that thier lives are on television
. other than tyhat
, the two movies are completely different from earch other
. reviewers seem tothe love to pick one movie
( i
. e
. the truman sohw
)
, obsess over it
,
and mkea it a guideline for other movies
. when pleasantville
and edtv opened
, all critics seemed tothe treat teh two films like they were subjects of king truman
. the same goes for the thin red line
, as well
. when it opened in decemeber
, probablly 98
% ofthe reviews compaired it to stephen spielberg ' s saving private ryan
, giving thin line noone chance whatsoever
. critics loved private ryan so much
, that they automatically decided noone movie is good enough to triarch its standards
. this is why i think pleasantville wass underrated
. if the truman show had never been made
, pleasantville probably would have recieved better reviews
, done better at tjhe box office
,
and would be remembered affter it ' s long been on the video store shelves
. sure
, it wasn ' t perfect
,
and it wasn ' t very believeable
,
but niether was tje wizard of oz or star wars
,
anbd there stands two of the most prominant movies in history
. wih yhe exception ofthe don knotts as the annoying
" tv repairman
" the film is casted perfectly
: the ice storm ' s tobey maguire is david in real life
; he watchs the old 50 ' s sitcom
" pleasantville
" to escape from his feuding parents
. his twin sister
, jen
( reese witherspoon
) isnt a popular slut who
( steriotypically
) smokes
and wears revealing clothes
.
but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue
- thsoe eccessive 90 ' s terms such as
" like
"
,
" whatever
"
,
and
" cool
" amke her sound like the total dimwit she ' s supposed to be
. the twins
, with a littel help ffrom a tv repairman
( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo
- esque cast rather than a true acting oney
)
, are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote
. their new parents
, played by william h
. macy
and joan allen
, are perfect in every way
. their new names are bud
annd mary sue
,
and right awya htey start to corrupt the town of pleasantville
. after the siblings fit comfortably inaddition their new roles
, the movei beigns tothe take form
. it ' s just liuke watching a sitcom in itself
; ytou don ' t want it to end
.
" mary sue
" has sex with her date
, the school basketball champion
; when he tells all his firends about it
, they stpo preforming perfectly at basketball
,
annd things start to take color
. soon we learn that these people don ' t know how to express true emotions
,
and when they learn tothe do so
, tehy eventually turn inot colour
. htis eventually sparks a racial war between the
" coloreds
"
and the
" black
& whites
.
" entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claimes the movei has
,
" none ofthe the depth
, poignance
,
annd brillance of the truman sohw
.
.
.
" yes
, the truman show was maybe a littel more intelligent
.
but yhe racial setting
- intensified by tghe forcing of thte coloreds to sit in thte upper box of teh courtroom
- certainly classifies as deepo
, considering it ' s what i least expected
. gary ross did not try tothe create an intelligent
, award masterpiece
- he just tries to convey moral messages within his wokr
. take for example big
and dave
, his past films
. big
- be careful what you wish for
. dave
- ogod or bad lieing is still lying
. did these movies win big awards
? no
,
bu they won the heart of millions
. pleasantville could have done that too
, if it wasn ' t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films
. pleasantville
: a
- ad2am
" i almost lost my nose
.
.
.
and i like it
. i like breathing through it
