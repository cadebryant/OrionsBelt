50 ' s
` aliens vs
. earth ' idea revamped
! if you have been following the movie news over the net
, you could not have escaped the hype over id4
. it promises to be the summer film of the year
and it has all the elements necessary
. id4 oppened in the us on 2nd of july
,
and up till now
, onyl after a week ofthe release
, it has nearly touched the us
$ 100 million mark
, a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park wass released bcak in 1993
. the premise of tghe movie is disgustingly simple
: earth defends itself aginst the aliens
, a typical
and highly popular 50 ' s hollywood theme whlch manifested itself in many films produced in taht era
. thte movie opens via star wars
,
however unoriginal it may be
, it worked
. the aliens have sent a large mother ship
( supposedly to be 1
/ 4 size of thge moon
) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles infact raduis to all the major cities on earth
. thte us presidnt
( pullman
) does nto know of the aliens ' intention
but soon finds outloud when david
( goldblum
) a scientist
, discovers that tyhe aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities
. capt
. hiller
( smith
)
, a hot
- shot f
- 18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned tothe take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc
. his squadron came under hevy alien fire after discovering that theri weapons were useless agaisnt the invaders
, he crash lands after a spectauclar 1
- on
- 1 chase over the grand canyon
, one of the many highlights of the movie
. id4 features many characters
annd we are shown teh impact on them as the story progresses
. acting onthe yhe whole was ok
although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role
but he did make a very rousing speech befoer sending his troops into battle
( do we smell a bit ofthe braveheart here
?
?
)
. no prizes for guessing how id4 ends
, its jsut plain obvious
. id4 borrows heavily ffrom star wars
, return of the jedi
, alien
and in some parts of the movie
, i could even sense a bit of x
- files on screen
. if i were to critically review this movie
, id4 is full of plot holes
, corny dialogue
,
anbd ridiculously dumb aliens
.
however below that wafer
- thin plot
and on
- screen flaws
, id4 scored well in playing wtih the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences tothe unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion
. an idae which will have tjhe audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie
, thus maintaining a screen
- viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in teh movei acceptable
, no matter how ridiculous
. id4 was produced under a modest budget of us
$ 68 millon
, a film of such magnitude would hvea easily been another waterworld
but director roland emmerich
( univeral soldier
, stargate
)
and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their pwn special effects rather thna commissioning it tothe ilm or any other special effects comany
. some of the effects are not too good
but most of it are very believable
, especially tje epic standoff between 150 f
- 18 ' s
and 250 alien saucers
, reminiscence of the classic space battle featured inaddition return of the jedi
. id4 is a movie forthe all
.
though there are many explosions
and implied deaths
, there are noone gory scenes ofthe human destruction
, thus young kids should be able tothe take it
. sit back
and don ' t be too critical
, chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i wass
. if you are not planning to watch any movies this year
, please
, at least mkae time for this oen
. this film isnt best watched on the big
- screen
.
