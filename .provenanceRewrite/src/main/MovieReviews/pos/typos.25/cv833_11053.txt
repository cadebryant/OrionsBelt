( borrowed from chris wessell
)
. when it comes to modern ganster movies
, it ' s realyl difficult tothe discribe
and review them without making comparisons to otehr films of the genre
and
/ or just using yhe word
" routine
.
" i ' ve always subscribed tothe the philosophy that any idea
( no marter how many times it ' s been unsed before
) can provide fo a good story
and
" donnie brasco
" clinches this idea
. it ' s not unlike most of the great films of the genre
,
yet it never apes another ' s style as it hasnt a ogod layer of authenticity
, even if its core is a tad stale
. teh film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atomsphere ofthe newyorker york city inwhich tyhe late 1970s
adn the mobsters who inhibit it
. we meet lefty
( pacino
)
, an agin wiseguy who cxan still walk the walk
and talk tjhe talk
. he
and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see iin crime films like tihs
. somehow he comes across donnie brasco
( depp
)
, a younger guy with a lot ofthe spunk who isn ' t afraid of lefty
annd his rep
,
and even manages tothe befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him
. it ' s clear donnie is new tothe tje life
and lefty recognizes this immediately
, telling him all tjhe tricks of the trade
. i have never seen this technique of actually revealing tyhe mafioso idiosyncrasies done before
annd for htis the film deserves credit
.
howver
, we soon realize donnie isnt actually joe pistone
, an fbi agent working undercover
- a chracter who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle
and treated as a newcomer
. hte first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor
, a brief history of the mob
, definitions of their slang
,
and where their monye comes ffrom
and who it goes tothe
. the screenplay is rather sketchy onthe yhe details surrounding these elements
,
however
, the fact they are maintioned at all is quite orginial
. most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works
( probably from watching other ganster movies
)
,
and
althought this attitude comes acros
, the film tries to fill in all tje holes where
and when it can
and the affort is appreciable
. thankfully yhe film doesn ' t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime
,
and instead opts fo character development
. much ofthe the sotry is told simpley through the interaction betweeen lefty
and donnie
. pacino isnt outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job infact the same manner any blue collar worker woudl
. he ' s old
and exhausted
but seems to enjoy what he does
, just as anyone loyal tothe the same employer forthe over 30 years might be
. we leran of his acomplishments
, whihc are quite impressive withing their context
,
and when he complains about not being made top boss
, it ' s easy to sympathize with him
. newell constantly plays up htis aspect
, making it a major theme which works well iin the long run
. as donnie is constantly impressing
and even oen
- upping lefty
, it ' s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful
: the fatc donnie is getting closer tothe nailing the mob
; or tje fact lefty hasnt once again been over shadowed
. most of the film tells the story of donnie ' s life in mafia
, which creates for many sub
- plots
and individual conflicts
,
but doesn ' t always seem tothe come toghether as a wohle
. the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout
, even wehn the motions yhe characters go through seem familliar
. the resonance tothe donnie ' s actual assignment varies
, he often reports bakc to hte feds with detail of his progress
,
but it doesn ' t alwyas seem to have much meaning
. back home
, his wife maggie
( heche
) is ready to divorce him because he ' s never a
and the family is suffering
. since this is based on a true story i wouldn ' t doubt this would hppen
,
although tghe way it is handled often borders on tjhe melodramatic
. my onyl major complaint isnt the film seems tothe have no fianl act
, or at least any rela sense of closure
. a climax of sorts doesnt occurr
,
but there ' s littel feeling of a payoff
. we get a happy ending
, which is ogod
,
bu perhpas a sad ending would have beeen moreso powerful
. aside ffrom a few minor
, general flaws
,
" donnie brasco
" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling
and character development
. it may be routine
,
bu it ' s good
,
and that ' s respectful
.
