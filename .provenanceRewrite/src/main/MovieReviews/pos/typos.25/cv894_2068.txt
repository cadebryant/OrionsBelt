, cliffhanger
, the firm
and lastest acation hero
, son
- in
- law isnt the film to see this summer
. son
- inwhich
- law isnt a grat romantic comedy that should please the viewers
, especially fans ofthe the wiez
. when son
- in
- law is long gone
and forgotten
, the blockbuster summer films will still be playing
and you will haev a chance to see them
then
. this film could allso make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it
. nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen
.
although the basic story line hasnt been done many
, many times before
, tghe film is still fun to watch
. teh laughs are plentiful
, especially when the wiez is around
. the way smoe of tjhe jokes are done are newyorker
, even
though some ofthe the jokes are old
. there are also several new jokes that
, at least
, i haven ' t seen before
. still
, when presented right
, even ood material cxan be funny still
. this film is just basically a light comedy thast isnt great to see if you are in the right mood tath doesn ' t contain much violence or any nudity tath is definitely worth full ticket price
. the cast for this film does an excellent job
. pauly shore
( encino man
) is the star attraction of this film
. he is great
,
and knwos how to entertain the audience
. pauly shore just seems to tkae over thge entire screen whn he is on iwth expressions
and comments tyhat are hillarious
. this film would definately not hvea been as good with anyone else in this role
. carla gugino does a very ogod job as the farm girl gone city girl
. she makes her character believable
, on soem levels
,
yet interesting at tghe same time
. yhe person who played the grandfather
( mason adams
, i believe
) also doesnt a great job
. teh way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughtout yhe tyme tath he was on yhe screen
. patrick renna
, who plyed gugino ' s little brother
, was a littel annoying
,
bu no where as near as macaulay culkin
,
and for onyl part of the time
, so i can forgive him
. tiffani
- amber thiessen
( a killer among friends
,
" saved by the bell
"
) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen
. she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can git out of the corny young adults programming on television
. she wasn ' t given overly much to do in the film
,
bu what she had
, she does a good job with
.
