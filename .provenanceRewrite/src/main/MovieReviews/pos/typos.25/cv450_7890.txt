scarface
, a remake of thge 1932 film ofthe the smae name
, is a very gripping
and
, as far as i know
, a true
- to
- life story of how power
and violence lead tothe corruption
. al pacino
, as tony montana
( for whom the movei isnt named
)
, also provides a brillant performance as a cuban refugee who comes tothe america witht less thna nothing
and becomes one of the most highly respected
anbd feared drug lords in miami
. oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writting roles
. the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail
adn head for the coasts of the united states
. many of these cubans had criminal records
, such as tony montana
, a cocky
, fast
- talking man who hasnt tjhe look of crime
. nearly right after his arival in miami
, tony is thrusted inot hte gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy tyhat goes awry
. along with his friend
and partner
, manolo
( steven bauer
)
, tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez
( robert loggia
)
, a high
- roller in tjhe organized crime field
. tony aslo begins to fall in lveo with elvira
( michelle pfeiffer
)
, who at the time was frank ' s lover
. of course
, sooner or later in this industry
, betrayal
and corruption amount inot a force greater thna anytying else
,
and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to thsi force
. this is not before he becomes one of the most respected
,
annd oftenly feared
, men inwhich miami
. tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone
,
adn everyone he konws basicly feels the same way towards him
. no oen can trust him
,
and basically
, noone one doens
. scarface
,
although incredibly violent
, isnt one of thge best crime films of its timne
anbd stands out as another gerat performence for al pacino
.
although he did nto recieve any recognition from the academy for his performence
, it truly isnt a very good oen
. in fact
, his accent
and facial movements alone are enough in my mind tothe win at least a nomination
(
although he did get a golden globe nomination
)
. another element that stands out wehn somone mentions this film is the profanity
. a figure tagged to hte film boasts that thge word
" fuck
"
and it ' s uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film
, which isnt apparently a record
. the thing isnt
, hte vulgarity fits rather well iwth the movie
. as odd as it sounds
, it ' s true
. in the end
, scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard
.
