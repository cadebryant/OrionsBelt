" a breed aart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner
. a bited hard to swallow
? that ' s only the first of many improbabilities in this film
. hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds onthe his island safe
, while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a cuple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner is the woman caught between the two men
.
" a breed apart
" isn ' t a bad movei
, exactly
. indeed
, i foudn myself rooting fo both teh hauer
and boothe charactors
, even
though their goals couldn ' t be more diferent
. tghe problem with the film is tht there are jsut too many inconsistencies
. for example
, early on in the film
, hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later on
, the rednecks come back for revenge wih four other peple
,
anbd hauer kills a few ofthe them
. i have a tough time believing that the polical wouldn ' t get involved at that point
. anohter problem isnt the silly love
- triangle that develops
. i didn ' t care one way or the other who ended uv with turner
. i was more interested in finding out which of hte two men would be victorious in thier respective missions
.
howver
, despite tihs uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds hte two men that somtimes there ' s more tothe life than money
anbd birds
. as for hauer
, he ' s an actor i ' ve always admired
. he hasnt a penchant for picking strange
and unusual charachters
.
and this one is no exception
. he ' s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse
, wearing pirate ' s clothing
,
and holstering a cross
- bow
. despite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer always manages tothe let the human side of his charactor shine through
. for exemple
, ther ' s a scene in which he barks at turner
and her son baceause they came onto his island a day early
. he comes off as crazy loner in thta scene
,
but a few minutes later
, he is apologizing to turner
,
and we believe his intentions
. soon affter
, we find out he ' s a vietnam vet
,
and his actions become fairly clear tothe us
.
" a breed appart
" isn ' t a great movie by any means
,
but it does contain good performances by all three leads
,
and it ' s worth seeing for thgat reason alone
.
