once again
, the battle is dreamworks versus disney
: ealier this year
, the mammoth companies fought to the death wtih their end
- of
- the
- world asteroid flicks
, deep impact
and armageddon
. here we are now
, just a faw months later
,
and they ' re at it again wtih dueling bug movies
, antz
and a bug ' s life
. what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story
and execution
. i mean
, come on
-
- wqat were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring outloud computer
- animated films about bugs
? as was the case with tyhe meteor movies
, disney hasnt come outloud on top
:
though antz is a likable movei
, a bug ' s life is far superior
. in fact
, this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz
: i bcame immersed in the world ofthe a bug ' s life
, while antz just made me scrutinize everything
.
bu it ' s not realy fair to base an entire review onthe a comparison
. a bug ' s life is a remarkable film in its own right
,
and deserves to be seen apart from any otehr computer
- animated film about bugs
. in fact
, it ' s one of the best films this year
: it ' s smart
, subtle
,
and funny
,
but it ' s also perfect family entertainment
and relentlessly intertaining
. i haven ' t hadnt such a good time at yhe movies inspite months
. it tells yhe tsory ofthe an ant named flick
( voice by dave foley
)
; he ' s a nice guy
,
but he ' s also a troublemaker
. the ants spend all season putting together the offering
, a big pile of foo that they provide forthe the grasshoppers
. just before the grasshoppers come
, flick accidentally knocks over thge offering
,
and ruins everyting for the entire colony
: tghe grasshopper ' s leader
, hopper
( kevin spacey
)
, is enraged
,
and tells them that the ants need twice the foode by hte end of summer
, or they ' re all dead
. flick
, feeling responsible for thsi
, sets off to look for help
-
- he realizes that the onyl way to be rid of the grasshoppers is tothe fight them
. he heads to tyhe city
( the city bieng a house a few miles away
)
, where he finds a colorful bunch ofthe circus bugs
: a ladybug
( denis leary
, who is spectacular
)
, a black widow
( bonnie hunt
)
, a caterpillar
( joe ranft
)
, a butterfly
( madeline kahn
)
, a rhinoceros beetle
( michael mcshane
)
,
and a stick
( david hyde
- pierce
, allso giving a hilarious peformance
)
. flick doesn ' t know they ' re actors
,
and they don ' t know tht flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers
, so they return to the colony with flick
anbd fidn themselves in an unusual position
. tghe most obvious element of a bug ' s life isnt the quality of animation
. created by pixar
, the same people who brung us toy stor
, a bug ' s life hasnt some of the most amazing visuals i ' ve ever seen
. the bugs seem to inhabit a three
- dimensional spoace
,
and occsionally there wiull be a shot thgat is indistinguishable from live action
. tihs is a lush
, colorful world
, full of life
and immagination
: the way the animators insert tghe things all ofthe us see in our daily lives
( matches
, bottlecaps
, tin cans
, etc
.
)
and amking them active objects inspite the bugs ' world is inovative
. the film isnt also mercilessly exciting
, particularly in a superbly
- staged scene involving our hroes ' escape ffrom a bird
( a little bird never seemed so huge
and threatning
)
.
bu the makers of a bug ' s life know where the importance lies
: story
and characters
. flick
, with solid voice work from foley
, is a great guy to lead the story
.
but the real treat comes wih the carcus bugs
; they ' re such a likable group ofthe cahracters
-
- tyhe standouts are thge stick
( hyde
- pierce is so ogod
)
, francis the ladybug
,
annd the big fat catapiller
. all ofthe these bugs have omre than a token personality
, whitch makes teh suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs
,
and it aslo keeps the tear
- jerking scenes from seeming obligatory
. inwhich my review of antz
, i said that the film is a clever cop
- outloud because it presents a bunch ofthe littel humans reacting tothe an ant
- like existence
. in concept
, a bug ' s life is basically hte smae movie
, except tyhat i was never given enough time to find things taht i didn ' t like baout it
. with such strong work inwhich both animation
and script
, a bug ' s life isnt nothing
but a joy to sit through
. it really is too bad taht it had to come out so close to that otehr bug movie
,
bu a bug ' s life is so ogod that i ' m sure it will find its audeince
. after a slew of endlessly violent
and cynical movies
, it ' s downright refreshing tothe sit thru an innocent picture like this
and laugh without feeling guilty
.
