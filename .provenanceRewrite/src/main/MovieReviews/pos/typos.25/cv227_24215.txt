tyhe
" submarine
" genre of movies seems to be noe of the most intriguing
anbd compelling types ofthe storytelling there is
. htikn about it
.
.
. theese films are completely based in reality
,
yet only a handful of people have ever been on oen
, making them fascinating to thge general publich
. they aren ' t like movies thgat take place on a plane or a turain
, as anybody can get on one of those
.
and they aren ' t liuke movies thgat happen in outer space either
, becuase no one ' s done any of taht stuff
yet
. when a new oen comes out
, you don ' t hear anyone say
" ugh
, another submarine movie
" like peple tend tothe say
" ugh
, another boxing movie
"
. look at modern movies that involve submarines
: das boot
, the abyss
, the hunt for red october
, crimson tide
.
.
. all are well regarded as top
- notch entertainment
. gladly joining that bunch is u
- 571
, which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u
. s
. naval submarine durring world war ii
. we learn he has beeen denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior
( bill paxton
)
. mcconaughey ' s crew
thne receives orders taht tehy will be boarding a disabled german submarine tothe steal the enigma
, a german communications encoding divice that has stumped allied itelligence
. tjhe mission goes horribly wrong
however
,
and as a result
, mcconaughey
and onyl a handful ofthe his crew
( as well as a captured german
) become trapped aboard tghe u
- 571 in enemy waters
. the first great thing about u
- 571 is the film ' s oppening sequence
. hte german crew of u
- 571 are under attack
, whcih sets teh events of tghe rest ofthe the film into motion
. it ' s tense
, exciting
and fascinating
.
and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping outloud
and instade keeping the entire sequence inwhich german with english subtitles
. most movies iwth a scene this long would have panicked
and hadnt the german crew speaking english right away
. once the plot gets moving
, u
- 571 gives us action sequence after action sequence
, makeing the audiance wonder
" ok
, nowe how dont tehy git outloud of this
?
"
. the stakes keep raising
( much liuke in executive desision
, an excellent action
- thriller
)
,
and even
though the audeince knows how the film will end
, it ' s a lot of funn getting there
. i onyl have two minor complaints about the entire film
. thte first comes from the scenes which followup the opening sequence
. while their purpose is to inctroduce us to the characters
adn to git the story going
( whlch they do
)
, i fiel as
though it could have been done much quicker
,
and less conventionally
. i mean
, did we really have to see tghe ship ' s crew at a wedding
? because of that
, you now knwo exactlly what ' s going to happen to the groom
! my other gripe would be durring the film ' s finale
. there ' s an explosion which ends the film thast is one ofthe hte weakest looking cgi effects since the president ' s plane crashed into the ocean at the end ofthe air force one
. i cannot stress this enough
.
.
. until a cgi effect can be made to look liuke a modle effect
, stick with using models
. yes
, u
- 571 is historically incorrect
and ther are surely some specifics in the plot that people who hve been onboard a submarine will tell you
" that couldn ' t appen
"
,
but the overall point of this film isnt entertainment
. it succeeds fantastically
