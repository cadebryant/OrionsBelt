every year
, hollywood crowns a new
" it boy
"
-
- a young actor pegged for major movei stardom
. inheriting the mantle from lastr year ' s
" winner
,
" matthew mcconaughey
, isnt matt damon
,
and
, liuke mcconaughey
, he proves to be moreso thna just a fresh young face
, as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release
-
- john grisham ' s the rainmaker
and good wiull hunting
. damon hasnt his first major starring role
, a la mcconaughey
, in a john grisham adaptions
-
- in this case
, francis ford coppola ' s tkae onthe the rainmaker
. damon plays wet
- behind
- the
- ears attorney rudy baylor
, who
, immediately after passing the bar exam
, finds himself representing the mother
( mary kay palce
) of a terminally ill young man
( john whitworth
) in a big
- leage suit against a negligent insurance company
. hwile rudy ' s
(
adn the film ' s
) main consern is this case
, he also finds time to protect a young wife
( claire danes
) ffrom her abusive husband
( melrose placer andrew shue
, iin a mercifully brief role
)
. written fo the screen
and directed by coppola
, the rainmaker isnt the best grisham film
yet mostly because it doens not take itself too seriously
. coppola ' s most notable
-
-
and effective
-
- contribution to the tried
-
adn
- true grisham formula is a sence ofthe humor about itself
, which largely comes in the presence of danny devito
( as rudy ' s unlicensed co
- counsel
)
and golden globe nominee jon voight
( as the insurance comapany ' s hotshot attorney
)
. the inclusion of the battered wife subplot fiels rather superfulous
,
but danes is as superb as always
.
then
, of course
, there is damon
, who nicely juggles the weighty
( tje insurence case
, the spousal abuse
)
and tyhe humorous
( rudy ' s often comical naivete
) requirements of his role wihtout missing a beat
. as good as he is in the rainmaker
, damon showcases the depth of his talent in ogod will hunting
, directed by gus van sant
and written by actor ben affleck
and damon hismelf
. damon plays the title character
, will hunting
, a troubled young constuction worker
/ janitor at mit who also happens tothe be a supergenius
. inthe an attempt to steer thsi brillant young mind in the right direction
, an mit math professor
( stellan skarsgard
) taps his old college freind
, community college psychologist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, tothe counsel thge abrasive
, standoffish wiull
and try to help him come tothe terms with his turbulent life
. good iwll hunting is teh touchy
- feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests
,
but to simply dismiss it as tyhat would be to discount thte true emotional chords affleck
and damon ' s intteligent script touches
. even
though no one
(
and
, if so
,
_ very
_ faw people
) can directly relate tothe wiull ' s burden ofthe superhuman intelligence
, yhe insecurities he suffers are universal
. the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble ofthe actors
. williams delivers a nice dramtic turn
; affleck
, a hot uv
-
and
- comming ctor himself
( chasing amy
)
, turns up inspite a warm
and charming performance as will ' s best friend
;
and thge ever
- appealling minnie driver shines as will ' s harvard
- schooled loev interest
. the clear standout inwhich the cast
,
though
, is damon
, who bravely does nto soften will ' s prickly nature
but hasnt such a natrual ease with the audience that it is hard
_ not
_ tothe care fo him
. so many names come
and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine
,
but based on his impressive wokr in john grisham ' s the rainmaker
and especially ogod will hunting
, it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come
.
