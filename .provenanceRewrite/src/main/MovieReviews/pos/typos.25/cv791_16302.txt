ther is nothing like american hitory x iin theaters or on video
. noone otehr feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure
, the culture
,
and the brotherhood of white supremacy
. nice guy ed norton jr
.
( who sang in everyone sasy i lvoe you
) plays derek
, a twenty
- year old skinhead
. dad ' s subtle racism grew large in derek
, after gang members killed his father
. dad was fighting a fire when tehy shot him
. now derek keeps his head shaved
and hasnt a giant swastika tattooed over his heart
. derek is more intersted in the ideas of white supremacy than inthe its culture of violence
. at a basketball court
, balck
anbd white tempers flare
. derek channels the agression inot a game
, balck versus white
, fo ownership of the courts
. when the choice presents itself
, derek goes for gam point instead ofthe the sucker
- punch
. cameron
( stacy keach
) steps inaddition to derek ' s life as a surrogate father
. he takes derek under his wing
and nurtures his racist feelings
. keeping his own criminal record spotless
, he uses derek as a leader
and organizer for high
- visibility racial intimidation
. derek obliges by leading his younger
and dumber firends in race
- motiviated mob crimes
. at the bottom of hte chain
, derek ' s younger brother danny
( edward furlong
, made famous in terminator 2
) joins hte skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons
,
but beccause he admires his brother
and he whants to belong
. one nihgt three black youths break inot derek ' s truck
, which is exactly wqat derek has beeen waiting forthe
. outside in his shorts
annd his tattoo
, he shoots them all
. the third woudl
- be thief
, unarmed
, is only wounded
. iin the key scene ofthe tje film
, derek commands the kid inot a position where he can be killed with oney glorious
, enraptured
, awful stomp
.
( the fun
- spoiling nc
- 17 ofthe orgazmo seems even more inappropriate
, considering american history x ws rated r
. what sort of country is this that syas sex comedies are a bigger threat tothe our youth than brutal
, ecstatic violence
?
) yhe police arrive just as derek kills tghe lsat thief
. derek doens not resist teh cops
,
and as they spin him around to cuff him
, the film slows down
. derek raises his eyebrows
and smiles at his little brother in a chilling
, sadistic
, satisfied grin
. now in prison
, derek faces new challenges
. as the balck man in tghe laundry tells him
,
" infront the joint
, yuo the nigra
, nto me
.
" ther isnt a clique of swastika
- wearing skinheads
,
but they are not interested in thge ideology ofthe white supremacy
. they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation
. derek finds himselv truly alone
, truly in danger
,
adn truly affraid
. wehn derek finally gets out of prision
, he finds that his friends from tghe gang have also changed
. wihtout derek ' s leadership
, they ahve shunned the white supremacist ideology forthe the white supremacist culture
. it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he ' s screwed up
. in the end
, he spends quality time withthe is brother trying to undo the respect
and admiration he hadnt earlier inspired in danny
. teh film ends a littel too deliberately
, too neatly aftter the unchained emotion
and violent glee of the rest of the film
,
but it bearly detracts fomr hte overall experience
. edward norton gives an oscar
- worthy performance
.
although smoe of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction
, norton ' s performance compensated
.
( an exmaple that comes to mind isnt his pep talk befoer looting the store
.
) he also captured the essence of an older brother
. he took his responsibility as a role model to his yuonger brother very seriously
, very lovingly
, both before
and after his change of heart
.
though clearly not for all tastes
, this film is bold
and daring
. the subject matter is ugly
, cruel
,
and at times hard to look at
. nevertheless its subjects are part ofthe humanity ' s great face
. kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating
, if distasteful
, american subculture
.
