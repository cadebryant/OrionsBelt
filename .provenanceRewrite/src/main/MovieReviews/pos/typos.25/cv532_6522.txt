i ' m not quite sure what tothe say baout mars attacks
!
, which isnt obviously the work of a deranged genuis
. wehn tim burton ' s twisted alien invasion comedy really works
, it ' s breathtaking
and hillarious in equal measure
.
adn when it doesn ' t work
, it ' s just dull
. i ' m nto even sure it works more often than it doesn ' t
,
but where it counts
-
- that isnt
, when this gleefully evil invading force fomr teh red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come
-
- mars attacks
! isnt brilliant
. mars attacks
! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s
,
and it takes its cues fomr tje same sources as this summer ' s independence day
-
- old alien invasion flicks
, disaster movies
,
and big
- budget special effects extravaganzas
.
but unlike independence day
, which was a painfully middle
- ofthe
- the
- road appeal to the hearts
, minds
and wallets ofthe america
, mars attacks
! hasnt a fully developped
annd veyr personel sense of wonder about it
. teh big diference is thgat while independence day celebrated teh resilience of human beings
, mars attacks
! portrays us as the greedy
and hapless schmucks that we are
. the title sequence is just splendid
-
- an incredible swarm ofthe flying saucers rises out ofthe the canals of tghe red planet
and
hten storms earthward through tje solar system inaddition formation
. tghe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for hte invading forces ofthe movies past
,
and thier first appearance onthe the big screen in combination with danny elfman ' s thundering
, theremin
- driven score is absolutely jaw
- dropping
. it ' s so overwhelming that
, i swaer to yuo
, i had trouble breathing
. the movie lays low for the enxt 40 minutes
. we git a glimpse of the alien leader
, resplendent in a purple
- sequined cape
, when a television message isnt broadcast to the peple of the world
-
- naturally
, the onyl way to communicate with earthlings isnt to preempt our regularly scheduled programming
.
but mostly
, thge firt act is spent developing characters
, setting up mildly comic situations
,
and drawing a quirky
but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton
. it ' s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs tothe the aliens
, because burton ' s just nto intersted in making more thna caricatures out of his human stars
. anyone who comes tothe mars attacks
! expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is binded tothe be dissapointed
-
- withthe few exceptions
, theese characters are despatched as tghe film progresses
. jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states
but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer
. rod steiger does an amusing enough tkae on dr
. strangelove ' s buck turgidson
, glenn close brings some star pwoer tothe the role of the first lady
,
and martin short isnt a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house ' s
" kennedy room
,
" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries tothe seduce an alien dressed up as a big
- haired
, pointy
- breasted sexpot
( lisa marie
, the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood
)
-
- in an earlier scene
, it ' s made claer thast the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an ood issue of playboy
. sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show
anbd michael j
. fox isnt her newsman husband
. tghe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles
,
" they blowed up congress
!
"
and plays a decisive role infront the defeat of the aline menace
. jim brown
and tom jones are the film ' s vegas
- based heroes
,
and director barbet schroeder
( reversal of fortune
) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president
. also on hand
and underutilized are annette bening
, pierce brosnan
, pam grier
, lukas haas
anbd natalie portman
( the latter two alsot sohw up in woody allen ' s everyone says i love yuo
)
. the real stars
, of course
, are thte computer
- generated martians
,
and they ' re fantastic
. with bare brains glistening atop thier grinning skull
- faces
, round egg
- eyes wtih red pupils darting this way
and that
, these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate
-
- joe dante ' s gremlins are thge closest equivalent in recent memmory
,
but burton ' s littel monsters are more inventive
. the film ' s raison d ' etre are the scenes ofthe crimes against mankind
-
- the most famous monuments of yhe world crumble under tjhe alien assault
, easter island is turned into a bowling alley
,
and yhe nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans
. the sheer level ofthe mayhem isnt staggering
, especially when yhe aliens make their first attack
, blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons
. parents are urged tothe pay special attention tothe yhe pg
- 13 rating
-
- it ' s earned
. the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy
,
and at least a cuple of shots of massmedia distruction seem tothe have been engineered specifically in reponse to independence day
,
although mars attacks
! was in production long before that film ' s release
. cinematographer peter suschitzky
, who makes the most of wynn thomas ' s wildly imaginative production desgin
( thomas helped define the spike lee style
)
, accually took time off from his mars attacks
! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg
. cronenberg ' s movie will almost certainly be more somber
-
- it won ' t be released inthe the u
. s
. until early next year
-
-
but mars attacks
! is surely a similarly elegant nightmare
. this is nto a nice movie
.
(
and which studio executive was duped into giving burton
$ 70 million to make it
?
) by setting the film ' s final scenes infact the nearly empty
, holocaust
- ravaged america that independance day conveniently avoided
, burton ' s invasion epic suggests that the world we ' ve got may not be worth saving untli many of the people on it are dead
. the victims ofthe his invasion are naive
, greedy
, or disastrously self
- absorbed
-
-
adn a ogod thing
, too
, since the movei ' s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish
- fulfillment fantasy
. the surviving cast munbers are the innocents
adn the entertainers
, who triumph by determinining that tghe alien invaders
-
- the ultimate elitists
-
- are actually susceptible to tje kitschiest strains of american pop culture
. ultimately
, thsi messy masterpiece is the year ' s funniest comedy
and a weird
, winking affirmation of the power of the people
.
