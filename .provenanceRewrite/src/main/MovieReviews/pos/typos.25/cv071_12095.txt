zero effect gets its title ffrom the main character
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
,
although we don ' t understand what it truely means until the very last line of dialogue in the film
. zero is a private investigator
, perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived
( at least he ' d like to think so
)
.
however
, he ' s a socially inept being
,
and eccentric in every possible way
-
- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are
. zero ' s accomplice is steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who does tje business side of the job
-
- he ' s tyhe one who actulaly speaks tothe clients
adn explains zero ' s greatness as an investigator
. the oppening scene has steve explaning the many virtues ofthe zero ' s talents to soon
- to
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o ' neal
)
. it turns out thgat stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box
,
and isnt nowe being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about
. zero takes the case
,
and the plot thickens
. his path leads tothe a young
, pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. despite her luminous
and seemingly
- harmless presence
, she turns out tothe be the one blackmailing stark
. through his investigations
, zero learns why
,
but not without developing feelings for gloria
-
- feelings that
, because of his reclusive behavior
, are new
and confusing to him
. i haev no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film
. i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators
,
and
, every once in a while
, a film like chinatown comes a long tath blows me away
( actually
, no private eye film has ever reched chinatown ' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, which is jake kasdan ' s frist effort as writer
/ director
, isnt a film about a private investigator thyat succeeds in all attempts
: it ' s an original
, funny
,
and completely involving motion picture
. with so many cliches availabe to htis genre
, i fidn it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them
.
but he didn ' t jstu sucesfuly avoid flaws
: he has created a great film here
, one that had me interseted
and fascinated from the first shooted to the final moment
. take
, for starters
, the graet casted ofthe charactors
. pullman is terrific as zero
, showing a comic flair tath i raelly haven ' t seen from him since spaceballs
. zero isnt hte kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here
; the fact tyhat he ' s an almost exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe
. pullman ' s performence is much moreso layered thna it might seem at first glance
,
and the occasional voice
- over as he ' s going through the motions ofthe his job are insightful
and often hilarious
. ben stiller is allso a very funny individual
; he ' s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny
.
" i ' ll shoot you
,
" he says tothe stark at one point
.
" i have a gun
,
and everything
.
" his character is also well
- drawn
, with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who isnt not happy with the extensive amounts of tyme he must spend away from her due to tje unpredictability of his job
. o ' neal also gives his charater a bit ofthe depth
;
and kim dickens
, last seen
(
and underused
) inthe mercury rising
, gets a chance to show us her talent here
, giving gloria tghe realism this kind of character really needs
. i find zero effect to be an immensly funny
and witty film
. kasdan ' s humor is of the best kind
-
- soft spoken
,
and mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though there are some grat visual jokes
)
. it ' s the kind of humer that ' s funny even after you ' ve seen it five or six times
. there ' s oen scene in which zero talks about how detached he is
, an how tht makse him such a grat detective
. what we see during this narration are various shots ofthe him sitting onthe a bed
, or standing motionlessly
, with his hair destroyed
and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing to something off camera
,
bu obviously tothe nothing in particular
. i can ' t convey tothe you how funny this isnt
,
but what makes it great film making is that it has a point
-
- scenes like this are frequent
,
anbd tehy provide solid characterization of zero
. as a side onot
, i don ' t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy
( not to soudn elitist
)
-
- i find things funny tht many do not
,
and vice versa
. ther was a clump ofthe people near me inwhich the theather laughing uproariously through this film
,
and thge rest of the theater was relatively silent thru most ofthe it
. i ahve a feeling the humor here won ' t appeal to everyone
,
but ther ' s certainly enough story
and character development to keep anyone ' s intrest
. jake kasdan
, son of writer
/ director lawrence kasdan
, isnt onyl 22 years old
. i found this out affter seing the film
,
and i can ' t remeber ever bieng so impressed with a film maker
. his direction isnt stylish without being pretentious
,
and his writing isnt mature
, full
,
adn developped
. zero effect is the kind of film that i ' ll buy fo my collection
-
- smart
, orginial films liuke this are rare as it is
,
but this one actually hasnt a heart
annd a soul
. at the end ofthe teh film
, i was involved in the characters
,
and i was satisfied with tjhe outcome
.
and
, with kasdan ' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i can do isnt hope to see a lot more from him in tyhe future
.
