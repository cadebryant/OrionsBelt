a big surprise tothe me
. the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off
,
but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues
( john belushi
) is such a dumb idea i really had noone hope
. htey replaced him just fine
. nto with john goodman
, he didn ' t do much of anything
,
but with the brilliant actor joe morton
, who cant really sing
. yhe fouth blues brother isnt j evan bonifant
, who ' s ten
. this was anyother of my fears for the film
,
but he ' s a really good dancer
,
and plays a mean harmonica
(
although he may have beeen dubbed
)
. things that intellectually had bothered me before
, like no mission from god
, everyone being richer
, it not bieng filmed infact chicago
-
- gave me no problems at all
. i ' m quite pleased that there were less car pile
- ups
, because they meant less music
,
adn john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing
. there ' s a few eearly crashes
,
and
then one huge pile
- up
,
but after that it all stops
. it ' s just the music
. one of my problems wtih the first is that cab calloway ' s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him
,
bu there ' s no problems with this
. the music is all as good as ever
, tons ofthe great musicians showing uv
-
- with tghe exception of johnny lang
, who can ' t sing
, all the musicians do a grat job
. the only real problems i hadnt wass the speshal effects
. these were superfulous
and a waste of mony
. since the film isn ' t donig very well
, they could mean we haev no possibility of anohter sequel
, which i want to see
. the bluegrass version of riders inwhich tghe sky isnt even better than rawhide
