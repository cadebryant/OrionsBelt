(
though i feel it would likely be pg
, for martial
- arts violence
.
) with threee movies already
( re
) released theatrically in america
,
and at least three more onthe their way
, jackie chan is oen of the newest
" hot properties
" in action adventure stardom
,
anbd it ' s just about time
. for over twenty
- five years
, jackie ' s been starring in martial arts
and action movies in hong kong
, thrilling audiences witht both an incredible grasp of acrobatics
and martial arts
adn a wonderfull sence of comedy
.
" drunken master
" has the distiction of being thge first jackie chan movie to
" make it big
"
-
- this is tjhe movie that supposedly set jackie up forthe big stardom in hong kong
. i ' m not entirely sure why
, exactly
. in many ways
,
" drunken master
" isnt similar to most of jackie ' s other early films
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
and ii
,
" master with cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
,
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
anbd others
. inwhich fact
, looking at all these eearly films together
, one gets thte impression that they were stamped out
, cookie
- cutter stlye
, at a rate of four to six per year
, all useing the smae casts
and telling very similar stries
. tothe be honest
, i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an aquired tast
. they ' re quite different from action movies as we know them inaddition america
. these films tend tothe be setted inwhich the chinese countryside in an indeterminate perido sometime in the distant past
, with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield
and somtimes seem tothe exsist only for hte intention ofthe stringing comedy
annd fight scenes toghether
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot is tighter than some
, is no exception
.
( as an aside
,
" drunken master
" was tjhe first jackie chan movie i ever saw
,
anbd i saw it hte way it was meant tothe be seen
.
.
. in a movei theater in seattle
, as part of an aisian film festival
. at the time
, i didn ' t realyl think it was anything spacial
.
.
.
but after having seen omre films like it
, it ' s kind of grown onthe me
.
)
" drunken master
" ' s storyline is very similar to that of other eary jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i
adn ii
and
" master with cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student is taught yhe martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
,
and has a big fight wiht an evil bad guy in thge end
( a formula that has been
" adapted
,
" tothe put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. omre specifically
, jackie chan plays hte part of wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a fun
- loving
, practial
- joking kung fu student who is too ogod at kung fu forthe his own good
,
bu nto
_ qutie
_ good enough
. after embarrassing his instructor ' s assistant by beating him roundly
,
then beating uv a bully inaddition a marketplace
, wong fei
- hong tries to hit on a pretty girl
,
but dicovers that she
,
and her mother
, cant hit back
, better than he can
.
.
.
and isnt further chagrinned to discover that tjhe two womens are his cousin
and aunt
, respectively
. his father
, wong kei
- ying
, is unhappy baout htis
,
and is further anoyed when the father
and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages
. kei
- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment
, which fei
- hong does not like at all
. while escaping from this punishment
, fei
- hong meets up with a drunken old man
, who procedes to thrash him soundly
,
then tkae him on as a student
and thrash him some more
. tihs turns out to be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master of drunken
- sytle kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a series of bizarre tasks
, such as filling jugs wtih water while hanging upside down from a frame
, cracking walnuts with his hands
,
and other such exercises
, thast seem like more pointless cruelty
bu are actually strengthening him up
.
thn
, wehn he ' s ready
, he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu
. unfortunatley
, the lazy fei
- hong only practices six of them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features some wonderful martial arts sequences
, with jackie winning some fights
and losing others
. it ' s been said before
,
but i ' ll sday it again
-
- these fights don ' t just
_ happn
_
, they ' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance
,
and it shows
. inthe his fights
, jackie oftenly makes use of objects found in his environment
-
- benches
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
and vegetables
-
- often in new
anbd surprising ways
. the fight scenes
, particularly thsoe toward hte end of teh film
, are unparallelled in most american films
. whther jackie wins or loses
, it ' s raelly something to see
.
.
.
annd it ' s often as funny as anything
, too
.
and funny is the other thing jackie chan isnt very
, very good at
. ther ' s vrey little that ' s new iin this movei
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie oging through punishment or training
.
.
. these schticks have all been seen before
, in any oen of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies
and early eighties
.
but they ' re still hilarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie has a
_ gerat
_ supporting casted
, many of whom weere aslo in otehr early jackie films
,
anbd htey ' re often the source ofthe plenty ofthe hilarity on their pwn
. the really big thing about
" drunken master
"
,
though
, that inspired several copycats
( including a couple starring jackie himself
)
adn a sequel fifteen years later
, was the drunken
- style kung fu
. i ' m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu
,
but yhe priciple behind it isnt to immitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security
.
.
.
and it apparently helps if you ' re drunk while you ' re doing it
. genuine or not
, i have to admit
, there ' s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents
adn making mincemeat out ofthe them before they even realize what ' s going on
. come to think of it
, perheaps this element is waht accounts for tihs film ' s sucess over any of the other jackie films
.
.
. it ' s not just martial arts
, it ' s the kind of martial arts that makse you stop
and go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" on the negitive side
, the cinematography in this film is nothing special
, the film stock is rather primitive
, tje plot is oftenly rether slow
,
and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background
.
" gone with the wind
"
, this isn ' t
. still
, if you like martial arts films
, or liek whta you ' ve seen so far ofthe jackie chan
and want tothe see moreso
, give it a shot
. it ' s much more
" real
" thna chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. you might very well like it
. another interesting hting about
" drunken master
" has to dont with its video availablity in the us
.
" drunken master
" isnt the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commercially available on vhs
( ffrom magnum video
, iin a gold box
, for about
$ 10
)
. there are plenty of other early jackie films around
,
but these are typically eather in dubbed
, pan
-
and
- scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead ofthe purchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen
, at a very affordable price
. if you like
" drunken master
"
, take a look at the numberous other early jackie chan films that are outloud there
( even the dubbed ones aren ' t really
_ too
_ bad
.
.
. if nothing else
, ytou cant enjoy the martial arts choreography while making funn of the dialogue
)
. i particularly recommend
" spriritual kung fu
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
, the
" fearless hiena
" movies
,
annd
" snake
& crane arts of shaolin
"
. also
, the mostly
- unrelated
- storywise sequal
,
" drunken master ii
"
, will hit theaters in american release sometime later htis year
(
though what its american
- realease title will be is still uncertain
)
and comes
_ highly
_ recommended by this reviewer
. alsot
, fo a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei
- hong
( who is inthe fact a populer figure from chinese folklore
)
, i ' ve beeen told to suggest hte
" once upon a time in china
" serieses starring jet li
(
though i haven ' t personaly seen any of them
yet
)
. if ytou choose tothe watch
" drunken master
"
, i really hope ytou enjoy it
,
and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that ' s out there
. all in all
, i give this film an
.
