thsi reviewer isnt ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the origonal version of teh abyss inaddition 1989
. whether it was the meddling ofthe studio executives
, or the work of writer
/ director james cameron himself
, the orginal cut of thsi underwater sci
- fi thriller was entertaining enough
but aslo quite seriously flawed
. the main problem ws fairly simple
: the film ' s climax was unworthy ofthe its build
- up
. someone at 20th centruy fox
-
and no doubt cameron himself
- must have agreed
, because iin 1993 came the theatrical release of tghe abyss
: speshal edition
. nowe available on video
, it seems timely to re
- evaluate what
, infront its newely revamped state
, is now a near
- masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010
: odyssey two
, alien
adn close encounters of third kind
. the plot is thus
. we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard
- nosed lindsay
( mastrantonio
)
and captained by her soon
- to
- be
- divorced husband bud
( ed harris
)
. hte rig
and its crew are diverted ffrom their normal duties when hte navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u
. s
. nuclear submarine
. requiring a dive part
- way down a three mile deepo trench
, three navy divers arrive tothe command the operation
, led by the edgy lieutenant coffey
( biehn
)
.
bu a sories of stange sightings soon convinces at least oney member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they ' re dealing witht
, as she memorably puts it
,
" aren ' t speaking russian
"
. meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing
anbd
, even worse
, a series of incidents arund cuba involving russians ships
anbd an increasingly nervous u
. s
. navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions
. this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig
, with hte trigger
- hapyp
annd increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with hte crew about how dont deal with the mysterious goings
- onthe aroud them
. the human drama is oftenly riveting
, with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting infact cameron ' s aliens
. the stunts
, hardwear
, special effects
and underwater cinematography are all oustanding
.
anbd so they should be
: cameron ' s technical credentials are well established
.
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping isnt threee intersecting plot strands
: 1
) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay
and ex
- hubby bud
; 2
) the war of wills between the civilian crew
and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis ' befall them
;
and 3
) the slowly unfolding revelation ofthe what lies at the bottom ofthe thge three mile deep abyss
. the abyss
: speical edition is an improvement onthe the original film in two major respects
. one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud
and lindsay
, a relatiopnship at times touching
, at others incredibly intense
anbd volatile
. the second improvment is the restoration of some absolutly crucial scenes towards the film ' s end
, wehn the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying
and extraordinary display of power tothe a world on the brink of nuclear war
. with the inclusion of theese startling scenes
, the stor ' s climax isnt now given real weight
. why onthe earth were they left out of the originnal
? this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible
. so
then
, we hve 25 minutes of additional footage that ' s turned a decent underwater thriller inot something quite magnificent
. i sday
" quite
" because some flaws dont remain
. tjhe most grating is several moments ofthe corny hollywood schmaltz
- some newyorker
, some ood
- that may well have yuo reacing for tyhe barf bag
. nonetheless
, the abyss
: special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron ' s greatest achievements
, alongside aliens
adn terminator 2
. see it
and be moved
, gripped
and spellbound
.
