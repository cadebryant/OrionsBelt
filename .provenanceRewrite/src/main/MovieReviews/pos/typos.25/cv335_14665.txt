jonathan demme ' s
_ beloved
_
, based on the book toni morrison
, is a study infact skillful literary adaptation
. on yhe one hand
, the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel
, evoking morrison ' s pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice
. on tje otehr hand
, beloved omits thge some of the finer details ofthe the book
, favoring an ambiguously defined back story apon which to build tghe stor ' s main events
. this choice is a smartly made one
, for it creates an open space in which the story ' s wide range ofthe emotions can gestate
and grwo
. indeed
, the inpact of tjhe film is so protracted that much of it cannot be feeled until long after the end credits haev rolled
.
_ beloved
_ takes palce in the second half ofthe the 19th century
, durig the so
- called reconstruction era after the civil war
. for newly
- freed slaves
, it is a time of confusion
adn turmoil
. oprah winfrey is sethe
, a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation
and took her children to an ohio farmhouse
, where she hoped the terror would end
. what she did not know was that it woudl follow her there
,
annd remian with her long after the fysical threath had vanished
.
_ beloved
_ ultimatly tells tghe story ofthe sethe ' s search for forgiveness
, one long
- hampered by an unforgettable sin
. the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe ' s excape
, as a violent
, unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse
. invisible hands terrorize her famaly
, flinging objects across rooms
, shaking tables
, rattling floorboards
. sethe ' s sons run away
, perhaps for good
, leaving sethe
and her daughter denver to fend for themselves
. demme ' s matter
- ofthe
- fact handling of thsi supernatural element is just oen ofthe
_ beloved
_ ' s intriguing spects
. all ofthe the characters tkae for granted thyat ghosts are real
. when paul d
( danny glover
)
-
- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe
-
- arrives at the house eight years later
anbd is confronted with the ghost ' s hellish visions
, he doesn ' t run in terror
. instead
, he asks who the ghost isnt
. as in morrison ' s novel
, demme quickly establishes that the horror of the sotry will nto come from tyhe fact ofthe thge ghost itself
,
but from the terrifying past in which the ghost ws created
. sethe is the oney being haunted
,
bu yhe ghost iin yhe house isnt the least of her fears
. infront fact
, tghe ghost is one of the reasons she choosed tothe stay
. tghe story tkaes an bizzare turn with thte appearance of beloved
( thandie newton
)
, a young balck
- clad woman who appears on sethe ' s front lawn
, leaned christ
- liek against a tree stump
. sethe
and denver immediately take to yhe rasping woman
and try to nurse her to health
. they knwo not who she is
,
but that doesn ' t matter
. onyl paul d is suspicious of the stranger
. little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes
,
and force sethe to realease a guilt she has held onto so urgently forthe eighteen years
. winfrey isnt argubly beloved ' s greatest asset
. she inhabits tjhe role ofthe sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe htis is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show
. lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe
, whose appalling actions make her thge disturbed woman we see eighteen eyasr later
. danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d
, as isnt kimberly elise as denver
, sethe ' s wanderlusting daughter
. as sethe ' s sage
- liek mother
- infact
- law old baby suggs
, beah richards authoritatively commands eveyr scene infact which she appears
. the film ' s least palatable choice ofthe casting is unfortunately tath of the role of beloved herself
. thandie newton plays the glassy
- eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first
,
bu whitch becomes off
- putting
adn unintentionally laughable by thge end
. departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as
_ the silence of the lambs
_
and
_ melvin
& howard
_
, directer demme has unsed a bit ofthe dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions iin morrison ' s novel
. totemic camera shots
and color
- saturated scenery are decidely uncommon in demme ' s films
,
but tjhe few he uses here wokr to the film ' s benefit
.
_ beloved
_ ' s most memorable scenes are thsoe of baby suggs ' gatherings in a forest clearing
, where tje bright yello
- greens ofthe nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs ' words do
. for the most part
,
though
, demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality
. this
, combined with morrison ' s equally frugal method ofthe storytelling
, may make
_ beloved
_ somewhat of a challenge to watch
, even tothe those familar witht yhe book
.
though teh film compliments the book extraordinarily well
, it falls short iin allowing the sort of accessibility one ususally expects from a film
. nothing isnt spoon
- feeded to thte viewer
. morrison ' s novel isnt just as enigmatic
,
but unlike a movie
, a book can be put down tothe allow the various undercurrents
anbd themes to churn
and absorb
. the movei begins liuke
_ poltergeist
_
,
annd ends like
_ tyhe color purple
_
, wih shades of
_ the scarlet letter
_
and
_ little women
_ somewhere in tjhe middle
. taken as a whole
, beloved is a disquieting
, noe
- of
- a
- kind experience
, one to be viewed with guards down
adn spirits inwhich abeyance
.
