you ' ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to
. in order to make the film a success
, all they had to dont was cast two extremely popular
and attractive stars
, have them share the screen for baout twpo huors
and
then collect the profits
. no real acting was involved
and there isnt nto an orginial or inventive bone inspite it ' s body
( it ' s basically a complete re
- shoot of the shop around the corner
, only adding a few modern twists
)
. essentially
, it goes agianst
and defies all concepts ofthe ogod contemporary filmmaking
. it ' s overly sentimental
and at times terribly mushy
, not tothe mention veyr manipulative
.
but oh
, how enjoyable thast manipulation is
.
bu there must be something otehr than the casting
and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does
, because i absolutely hated the previous ryan
/ hanks teaming
, sleepless inspite seattle
. it couldn ' t have been tghe directing
, beacuse both films were helmed by the same woman
. i haven ' t qutie
yet figured outloud what i liked so much about you ' ve got mial
,
but
thn again
, is that really important
? if you like something so much
, why even question it
? again
, the storyline is as cliched as they come
. tom hanks plays joe fox
, the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain
and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley
, thte even more insanely likeable proprieter of a family
- run childern ' s book shop called
, in a nice homage
, the shop around the corner
. fox
and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening uv right across yhe block from teh small business
. littel do they know
, they are already in lveo with each otehr over the internet
, only neither party knows teh other person ' s true idenity
. yhe rest of the story isn ' t imporatnt because all it doesnt is serve as a mere backdrop forthe the twpo stars to share the screen
. sure
, there are some mildly interesting subplots
,
bu they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of hte main relationship
. all ofthe this
, of course
, leads up to the predictable climax
.
but as foreseeable as yhe ending is
, it ' s so damn cute
and well
- done that i dout any movei in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does
. when ryan discovers tjhe true identity of her online love
, i wass filled with such
, for lack ofthe a better word
, happiness that for the first time all year
, i actually left the theater smiling
.
