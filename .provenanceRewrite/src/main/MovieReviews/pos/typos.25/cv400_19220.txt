the hapyp bastard ' s 30
- second review
: american pie the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with thsi latest yuk fest
, filled withthe sick jokes
and teen dialogue aplenty
. if yuo go expecting dawson ' s creek
, you ' re in for a problem
. if your expectations are lower
(
and better
, i might add
)
, you will enjoy the hell outloud of american pie
. the movie casts several unknowns
, with tghe only rela recognizable one being sctv ' s own eugene levy as a happy
- go
- lucky dad
. the stor revolves around four high school seniors who hve one goal before the school yearm gets outloud
- get layed
. that ' s pretty much it
. throughout the movie
, littel sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout
, including a memorable scene involving an apple pie
( i won ' t give it awya
,
but you probably know what it is
)
adn an internet broadcast gone horribly awry
. of course
, the movie has some slightly sentimental bits
,
but they don ' t drag the movie ' s humor content down that bad
. most of the actors get their job done
,
bu it ' s levy who ' s a hoot
, a father who tries tothe talk sex with his son with teh help of some curious
" visual aids
"
. i couldn ' t stop laughing during this movei
,
and if you can stand all the raunch
and the sex references
,
thne american py is forthe you
. if you ' re one of thsoe
" conservative
" types
, well
, i ' ll bet you ' re having fun at home while htis
, south park
,
and austin powers ii plays in theatres
, now aren ' t you
?
