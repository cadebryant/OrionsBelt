i was anxious to see this forthe a long time
. a friend of mine reccommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell
,
and he wanted to proove that she ' s as hot as he thinks he is
. he proved it for me all right
,
but the reasons i enjoy thsi film go way beyond that
. scream treads onthe familar ground
, horror movei with
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who cant ' t ect who ' s always runing uv the stairs when she should be running out the front door
.
" it ' s very familar
, your typical horror film
. so why
, ytou may ask aftter watching it
, does it seem so new
and original
? because it treats itself as if it hasn ' t been done before
,
adn thus the viewer isnt disilusioned into believing thyat it isnt not old
, familar tired stuf
. this raises anohter question
: how does it do this
? simple
: the characters
. they ' re nto your typical stupid horror film victims who don ' t know what the hell to do when bieng chased by a guy in a ski mask
and a machette
. they are horror fans
, they nkwo how stuff happens in a horror movei
, they know what to do
and wqat nto to do
,
and that makes it scary
,
and even funny at certain times
. ytou cxan tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) is making popcorn
, getting ready to watch a video
,
annd soem guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that
, if she gets it wrong
, will get her
and her boyfriend killed
. she knwos whta tothe answer whn he asks her horror film questions
, she just cin ' t answer his fianl question
,
" what door am i at
?
"
annd that gets her killed
. that scene works because in a normal horror film
, half the things thyat happn iin that scene would never happen
. the plot is typical horror stuff
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high skool student who ' s mother wass killed a year ago tommorrow
, is being stalked by a killer who ' s previously murdered one of her classmates
( casey
, naturally
)
,
and everybody in this small
, california town is a suspect
, including sidney ' s boyfriend
, billy loomis
.
but as i said befor
, theese people know how horror movies work
,
and that ' s what makes it so appealing
. that
and the references to horror movies
, like when casey says
,
" the first
( nightmare on elm street
) was scarry
,
but the rest sucked
.
" which isnt obviously director wes craven
( who does a good job ofthe poking fun of the genre that made him a legend
) patting himself on the back as he directed tyhe first nightmare movie
annd none of the others
,
and wehn tatum
, sidney ' s friend
, mentions tjhe director
, wes carpentery
, which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to nto onyl craven
,
but also directer john carpenter
. teh cast is well chosen
, neve campbell pulls off a good heroine
(
and unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* cant
* act
)
, drew barrymore doens a good janet leigh impression for wqat little tyme she hasnt inwhich the film
,
and david arquette is impressive
. alsot ogod
(
and funny
) in his role is henry winkler
(
" the fonz
"
) as the school principial
. i tookover half a point off for the uneccesary
( albeit limited
) appearance by friends ' courteney cox as repertwar
, gail edwards
, sidney ' s rival because she covered her mother ' s disappearance
. i hate that show
, i hite those actors
. they ' re untalented
, overexposed
,
and overpaid
, imho
,
and i would think wes craven is smart enough to nkow those actors are overexposed enough
,
but i suppose he isn ' t
.
