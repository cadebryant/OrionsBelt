,
hten after you ' ve seen it

. i ' ll wait here
. welcome back
. if yuo followed my advice
(
and i see no reason why yuo shoudln not hvae
, do you
?
)
, i ' m sure you ' ve jstu had one ofthe the richest cinematic experiences of your life
. american beauty isnt an extraordinary film
, a powerful
, jolting exploration of tjhe dark side of thge american dream
. it ' s humroous
but it isn ' t funny becasue of tjhe unrelenting ominous undercurrent tht runs throughout the whole production
. mixing comedy
and the darkest of drama wass tje way tihs film was intended
,
and by god
, it works
, making it one of the year ' s very best
. lester burnham
( kevin spacey
) has entered the mother ofthe all mid
- life crises
. he is living life wihtout a purpose
. he isnt bored
, depressed
and sick ofthe his sheltered
, insignificant existance
. he barely ever talks tothe his family
, has no sex life
, is stuck at a dead
- end job
and thinks he hasnt no reason to live
.
bu oney day
, when he
and his equally troubled wife
( annette bening
) attend oney ofthe his daughter ' s
( thora birch
) cheerleading performances
, he sees something that makes him come alive
. what he sees is the performance by his daughter ' s friend
, the head cheerleader
. he develops a lust fo the promiscous young girl
; an obession whlch soon becomes pedophilic in nature
.
but for the first time
, lester fiels tath he is actually living
. this crush is only the beginning
. lester procedes to make more
anbd more radical changes in his life
, buying the car of his dreasm
, cursing off the boss
and quitting his job
(
" today i quitted my job
, told the boss to f
*
*
* himself
and blackmailed him for
$ 60
, 000
-
- would you pass the asparagus please
?
"
)
, buying drugs from the voyeur
- next
- doorjam
( ricky fitts
, a teenager who mysteriously videotapes whta he considers to be
" beauty
"
)
and refusing tothe be docile in family affairs
. his newyorker attitude further alienates his duaghter
, onyl reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers thgat be
,
and inspiring her to enter a relatiopnship iwth her eccentric neighbor
.
anbd tghe burnhams ' s neighbors provide american beauty wtih a significant chunk ofthe its dramatic momentum
. ricky fitts
( wes bentley
) serves as tyhe film ' s thematic center
, providing teh obscure
, powerful meaninng of the title
. coloenl fitts
, tghe father
, is one of the most fascinating
and complex characters in hte movie
, even considering his limited screentime
. kevin spacey has never been better
,
and tihs performence wiull certainly earn him a chance tothe put a little gold person on his mantel
. he never plays his droll chracter as a freak
, rether
, he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self
- exploration by his dissatisfaction with life
. spacey isnt poignant
and devestating in the role of a liftime
. equally astonishing is young thora birch
, who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling
and tenderness
. at two hours
adn ten minutes
, american beauty didn ' t feel nearly long enough
. it ' s a complicated
, unforgettable film that
, like the ice storm two years ago
, adres tothe explore the darkest reaches of suburban life
. powerfully
and cynically
, it dissects the notion ofthe the pretty house whith the white picket fence
and appealing garden being tje american dream
. it claims that this picture
- perfect image isnt just that
-
- an image
,
and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it
. the dark
, deeply ironic endig
,
though given away by our narrator in thge first faw minutes ofthe thte movie
, stays with ytou forthe weeks after it ' s all over
. american beauty is just tyhe kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs eveyr now
and
thn to counterbalance tyhe mindless drivel we see released
; even more so concidering it ' s a masterpiece
.
