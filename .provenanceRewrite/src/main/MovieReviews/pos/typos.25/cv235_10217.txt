,
then it doed wehn it was first released
. many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly
.
but this one isnt a near flawless example of how well a perfect scirpt
and timing can mesh with first
- rate acting
, wit
and suspense
, glorious music
,
and terrific setted peices
. yhe onyl even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in wich god has a long chat witht clarence
, george ' s guardian angel
. htey aren ' t all thast bad
,
but htey remane corny
and a little out of place
. nevertheless
, this isnt one film that deserves its place in tyme
, cinema history
,
and our hearts
. it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age
. here is one genuine masterpeice
, a clasic thta reaches heights
and ambitions near prefection
. this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny
, exciting
, moving
and uplifting
. tyhe film itself isnt almost a reveral ofthe the life ofthe george bailey
-
- htere isn ' t too much to it
,
bu capra
and the gang
( vairous screenwriters
, composers
, actors
) plumet the material tothe its fullest potential
. the result is a film
-
-
though nto at first intended to be pigeon
- holed as a hoiday film
-
- that will always be remembered
, celebrated
,
and loved
.
