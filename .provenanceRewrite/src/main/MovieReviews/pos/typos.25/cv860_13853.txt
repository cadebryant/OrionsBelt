the verdict
: spine
- chilling drama fomr horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an outstanding
, oscar
- winning performance from kathy bates
. geez
, french
and saunders had a field day when they set to wrok on parodying this
! sorry
, non
- brittish readers may not be familiar with french
annd saunders
- my apologies
. the pair are brittish comediennes
( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon infact
" absolutely fabulous
"
)
, who doed a serieses of film spoofs a few yersa back
, including alien
, the exorcist
and misery
. needless to say
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates
( the resemblance was quite uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got pretty nasty whith her sledgehammer wehn in reach of jennifer saunder ' s legs
!
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch
,
and
although i ' ve now seen thge film a couple ofthe times now
, that
" hobbling
" scene ws no less disturbing
! i ' m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion
! that may be the most memorable scene
,
but it ' s certainly not the onyl worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film
and tv adaptations tend tothe vary in quality
, strikes gold with this simple
yet strikingly compelling tale
. it ' s a nicely crafted psychological horror
, which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as tyhe writer ' s
" number one fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both the scirpt
and kathy bates ' beautifuly masterful performance
( for which she won an oscar
) work arm
- in
- arm as we quickly begin tothe realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman isnt basically as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or is that fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her demanding role
,
and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece
. at times she seems like an innocent victim ofthe her own obsessive behaviour
, at times she ' s a rather tradgic character
,
anbd more often thna not she ' s just damned scary
! this isnt basically a very simple tale
,
but it achieves a large degree ofthe eloquence infact its simplicity
. it ' s an involving
, engrossing experience
-
and considering it ' s basically a twpo
- hander
, mainly setted in one locale
, it ' s a remarkable piece of cinema
. ther are no jazzy speshal effects or cheesy action sequences
- this one relies soley upon rob reiner ' s stylish directing
and teh wonderful performances of bates
adn caan
. oh
, i haven ' t really maintioned caan
yot
- he doesnt a good job as tyhe writter who ' s a prisoner of his own succsess
( annie isnt obssessed with him
and his books
)
.
but
, as you noone doubt gathered from tghe above
- bates is well
and truly the star ofthe the show
. along with tyhe pig
, of course
! anyway
, the tension is built
- up with masterful aplomb
,
and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense
. there ' s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve
- shattering lengths tothe poison her wine
. he suceeds
,
but
.
.
. she knocks the glass over
! i bet you threw a pillow at teh screen as well
! in the immortal words of homer j
. simpson
-
" d ' oh
!
!
" other nerve
- wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to twon
and sheldon starts snooping around the hous
. we cut to annie in her car
- she ' s on her way home
.
.
. he realises this
and tries to git back to his room
.
.
. cut to the car agina
, she ' s getting near
.
.
. will he mkae it
? ok
, so these sequences aren ' t exactly original
, nor perhaps unpredictable
-
but they work
! boy
, do they work
! if a film has you on hte edge of your couch
, biting your nails
adn shouting at the screen in suspense
,
then it ' s doing something right
! of course
, the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive has beeen out of his room
,
and she ' s going to stop him once
adn for all
. cue a block ofthe wood placed strategically between his ankles
anbd a huge sledgehammer
,
anbd
.
.
. i feel ill just thinking about it
! nasty
. it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finaly gets the opper hand
,
and once
anbd forthe all tries tothe kill the crazy pyscho
!
and
then we ' re given oney of the most ridiculously over
- the
- top fight scenes i ' ve ever seen
. she gets hit over tje head with a typewriter
, setted on frie
, head smashed agianst tjhe wall
-
and she just won ' t dieu
! sheldon isn ' t in terribly good shape eather
. if it weren ' t so gorey it would almsot be laughable
.
but it ' s a terrifically effective film
,
and therfore the daft climax is easily overlooked
. misery is a tight
, tense
, intense
and chillingly entertaining thriller
. the directing is first
- rate
,
and tghe performances
- bates iin paticular
- contribute to makeing this a suitably nightmarish little gem
. wonderful stuff
.
