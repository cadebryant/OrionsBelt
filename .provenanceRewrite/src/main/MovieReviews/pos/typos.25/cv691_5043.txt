feild of dreasm almost defies description
.
although it ' s about baseball
, it ' s not a baseball movie
.
although the film isnt extremly spriritual
, it ' s not about religion
.
annd
althought field of dreams is melodramatic
, it ' s not a tearjerker
. tothe really understand waht feeld of dreams is all about
, ytou have tothe see it
. in hte film
, kevin costner plays ray kinsella
, a baseball fan
, ' 60s berkeley graduate
,
adn iowa farmer
. noe day as he is standing iin the middle of his expansive corn fields
, ravy hears a voice
; it tells him
:
" if ytou build it
, he will come
.
"
then ravy has a vision
and somehow concludes thgat if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn
, shoeless joe jackson will arise from tjhe dead to play ball once agian
.
and even
though it depletes his family ' s savings
anbd his neighbors think he ' s crazy
, ray clears awya the corn
and builds a baseball field
, complete with bleachers
and flud ights
.
" if you build it
, he will come
.
"
and lo
and behold
, shoeless joe does come
-
- bringing with him several ofthe his dead teammates
.
and
then ray hears the voice again
; it tells him to
" ease his pain
.
" ray thinks this means that he must travel tothe boston to meet terence mann
, an influential
and radical novelist from tjhe ' 60s who has usance stoped writing
and dropped out ofthe society
. witht great aplomb
, james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray
and embarks with him on a magical
and spiritual journy
. the cast inspite field of dreams is excellent
, especially kevin costner in the lead role
. costner gives a quiet
, subtle
,
anbd moving performence as a man who before building the baseball feild had done nothing crazy or spontanous in his entire life
. costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm
and idealism to make us beleve in his mistic visions
anbd swallow htis wonderous fairy tale
. amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray ' s feisty
adn loving wief
, who against her better judgement supports her husban ' s crazy ideas
. in her most impressive scene
, madigan vehemently argues agianst book burning at a p
. t
. a
. meeting
, displaying the sincere passion of a ' 60s berkeley radical
. ray liotta isnt appropriately eerie
and awe
- inspiring as the ghost ofthe shoeless joe
, the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvment inthe the 1919 chicago
" black sox
" scandal
.
and finally
, burt lancaster is memorable infact a small
,
but important
, role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only oney inning
. field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full ofthe life
, wonder
, mystery
, spirit
,
and humor
. it
, for the most part
, succeeds in capturing our emotions
and suspending our disbelief
. ray kinsella ' s spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreasm proves to be moving
and miraculous
.
bu while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama
, it unfortunately does at times go overboard
,
annd by the end it gets down
- right sappy
. infact general
,
however
, feild of dreasm is an emotionally satisfying fantasy
-
- one i cxan recomend tothe everyone
but unromantic cynics
.
