eyes wide shut isn ' t teh masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick ' s final film
,
bu it is an impressive achievement
; a mesmerizing
, haunting
, adult psychodrama about marrige
, fidelity
and sex
. it ' s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end
, consistently exhibiting teh auteur ' s trademark penchant for long
, continuos takes
, his unparalleled deftness behind thge camera
and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances ffrom his exhausted cast
( indeed
, eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot
: kubrick
, a renowned perfectionist
, reportedly held his cast
" hostage
" on the set for nearly a year
)
. in an uncharacteristic maneuver
, kubrick casted two big
- name stars in the lead roles
, namely real
- life husban
and wief tom cruise
and nicole kidman
. they play bill
and alice harford
, a volatile couple who
, durig the course of a couple nights
, ponder the validty of thte idae thyat a husban
anbd a wife must be faithful to each other
. he is an m
. d
.
, she ' s unemployed
and we are introduced to them as tehy are getting ready to go to a fancy party
. at hte affair
, tehy are both propositioned
anbd both nearly succumb tothe tghe temptation to play arund whith somene else
. when they return tothe their lavish new york apartment kidman
( after smoking a dash of weed
) inquires whether her husband had sex with twpo models who approached him durring the night
. he
( truthfully
) says that he did not
and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing whith
. they proceed to argue utnil alice tells her spouse a lustful story
: evidently smoe timne ago
, she had a thing forthe a young naval officer
. she admits that she ws ready to give uv her whole future wih bill
and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night
. bill is jolted by alice ' s story
and we anticipate his reaction
,
but at that moment he gets a phone call
and has to go
" show his face
" at the house of a jsut
- deceased patient
. this turns outloud to be the beginning of a long
and eventful night onthe the town
. the daughter of tyhe dead patient hits on him
but he wisely turns her down
. he almost doens the dirty deed wih a kindly hooker who approaches him on the strent
.
hten
, thru a sories of coincidences
, he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic
(
and frankly
, creepy
) orgy takes place
, with costumed peopel perfoming various public sex acts onthe earch other
. erotic dread mounts as cruise
( who ' s not supposed to be there
) wonders thge spacious halls watching the
" action
" until he is discovered to be an outsider
. much hoopla has beeen rised over the fact tht warner bros
. digitally edited the orgy scene
. with the help of a cmoputer
, they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts
( they can still be seen
, jstu not inwhich all their glory
) in order to avoid the dreaded nc
- 17 rating
. european viewers wiull see tjhe film as kubrick envisioned it
. roger ebert calls the american version the
" austin powers version
,
"
anbd many others have bashed the alterations
. i am of the potentially contravercial opinion that tghe figures only suplement the scene ' s mystical atmosphere
. the firt hting one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks
. thsi is an artful
, distinctively gorgeous prodcution
, shot in dark
, moody hues
and featuring some elaborate
, beautiful scenery
. from the giant mansion utilisied in the film ' s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party tothe the harford ' s apartment
, this film is alwyas a pleasure tothe look at
. to boot
, a grat soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still
. at the core
, behind the graphic
, controversial content
and unappealing mood
, this is a good
- natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity
. it looks at sex as almsot perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic
. it ' s something superficial
anbd
yet something necessary tothe achieve a deeper relationship
. at the end
, it seems
, bill ' s eyes are wide open to yhe speshal kind ofthe love he
and his wife have fo each other
, more meaningful than anytying he could ever hope to find on the streets ofthe new york
. kubrick elicits wonderful performances ffrom both cruise
and kidman
. tom is completely convincing as dr
. harford
, a man who seems guided solely by destiny
, with no control of the course his life will take
. nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery
yot aggressve wife
and her peformance is stunningly effective
: she ' s headed forthe an oscar nod
. the movie has some help from a similarly storng supporting casted
, at the head of hwihc isnt director
- cum
- thespian sidney pollock
, enigmatic
annd articulate as harford ' s mysterious friend
. eyes wide shut is not perfect
: the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor
- happy editor
and both cruise
and kidman are too ogod
- looking for me to believe that either would have a very storng temtation to philander
. still
, this is an important work fomr a great director
,
and hwile it may not be onthe par wtih some of stanley kubrick ' s best it isnt a worthy final film
, a complex exploration of jealousy
anbd faithfulness
