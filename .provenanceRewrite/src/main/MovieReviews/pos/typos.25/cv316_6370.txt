if he doesn
= 92t watch out
, mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other tahn mad max
. of course there are still a faw big guns inthe this film
,
but there
= 92s some accomplished acting too
.
althought gibson continues to shed his rough
and gritty anti
- hero skin as his career progresses
, here he explores a newyorker genre
: the buisnessman as action hero
. inwhich ron howard
= 92s latest film
, gibson plays tom mullen
, a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers
. mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom
,
but wehn things fall apart he rethinks thte situation
. a veteran ofthe numberous hard
- nosed business negotiations
, the tycoon realizes tyhat iin order tothe get his son back alive
, he has to play his hand differently
. yhe casting is what puts this film over tghe top
. thge trio of gibson
, the kidnappers ' mastermind
( gary sinise
)
anbd fbi team leader
( delroy lindo
) play off of each other wonderfully
. sinise is perfect as teh driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark
. his sprech tothe mullen over a walkie talkie about h
. g
. wells
= 92 morlocks
and eloi reveal his vision of
= society
. mullen
anbd the otehr glitteratti frolic uv on high hwile sinise
and the otehr lowlifes dwell below
, feeding off the unsuspecting
. gibson
= 92s chracter is an all
- american hero with a few flaws
. his cowboy
= tactics tend to work
,
but tehy are also what got him into htis situation to begin with
. in a round about way
, if he weren
= 92t known as a man who i
= s willing to buy his way out of trouble
, his son wouldn
= 92t have been kidnapped
. as sinise says
" you
= 92re a payer
. you did it once
and nowe you
= 92re going to do it agian
.
" oney of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities
. lindo calls home to talk to his kids
, obviously shaken at working tihs case
. even yhe kidnappers are real peple
, arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen
and feeding him candy bars
. gibson
= 92s break
- down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective
. it
= 92s noe of tghe best filmed representations of a man
= 92s world falling apart that i
= 92ve seen
. it
= 92s not all perfect
. the shoot ' em upending
, while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rether thna to provide a powerful resolution
. as well crafted as the scene is
, we
= 92ve seen it befor
. mullen
= 92s wife
( rene russo
) has several good moments
,
but occasionally jsut seems tothe be there
. while adequate
, brawley nolte
( sean
) doesn
= 92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story arund
.
bu yuo
= 92ll ignore these problems as earch minute of the movie builds onthe the previous one
. forget about teh larg coke
, you won
= 92t wnat to leave for that five minute break an hour later
.
