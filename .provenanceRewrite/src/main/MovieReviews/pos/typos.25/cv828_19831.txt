all those who were offended by ther ' s something baout mary should not tread in the waters ofthe american py
, a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride ofthe raunch
.
and hwile htis uproariously funny
, gross
- out summer movie is basicaly an exercise in bad taste
, it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end
. american pie is the latest entry tothe the offensive teenage
- targeted fare this season
. i must question the studio that releases a movie like htis
. the producers are aiming these films at the 15
- 24 crowd
,
but while pushing tje limit of possable sex
and violentce in an r
- rated film
. some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc
- 17
, a rating thte mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie
. american pie was threatened with an nc
- 17
,
but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product
, it wass given an r
.
but at least this new addition is not as careless
and unforgiving as something like sourth park
. it isnt sick
, perverse
,
and ultimately disgusting
- nto tothe mention extremely funny
. american py is about four despeate teenagers who make a pact to loose their virginity by prom nihgt
. jim
( jason biggs
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
adn finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) are a quartet of high skool students inaddition their senoir year who htink sex is something they must experinece to be successful in theri lives ahead
. jim inquires what it feels liek when you reach third base
, to which one of his friends replies
:
` like warm apple pie
.
.
. '
. ofthe course
, this prompts hte scene unfairly exposed in tghe trailers
, in which jim
annd a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kichen corner
. htere are many moments
, such as this
, in which director paul weitz uses a game
- plan similiar to the one frequently displayed in mary
: tothe cause teh audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief
. american pie is a hard
- fought effort thast has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it
. i loved tyhe young cast in this movie
. consider the subject matter that these actors have dealed wiht
, obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any ofthe their previous projects
,
anbd ytou should appreciate their performances
. biggs is more than enjoyable
,
and chris klein
( who recently played a simmilar jock inspite election
) is obviously a young talent onthe tyhe ries
.
but in a teen
- dominated movie
, teh best performence comes fomr comedian eugene levy
( ofthe television ' s sctv
)
, who is unexpectedly briliant as jim ' s uneasy father
. scenes in which thge familiar father
- son conversations are broght tothe interesting new levels are the funniest moments tothe be found in american py
. after levy discovers jim ' s new uise for apple pie
, he tells him
,
` i did a fare share ofthe that sort of thing wehn i was your age
.
but i never unsed baked goods
. ' it is performances such as his
,
and bill murray ' s inaddition rushmore
, thyat are oftenly unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out
. htere are soem less
- than
- original aspects of the film
. a bathroom incident involving finch
and a bottle of ex
- lax is something we ' ve seen before
. if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers
,
then this is a decidely unwise move
: hte same prank was pulled in the brother ' s dumb
and dumber
,
anbd used to greater effect
. secondly
, the characters are forced into a half
- hearted climax thta seems more artificial than amusing
.
bu at one point
, in whcih we discover that american pie doens have a heart of it ' s own
, biggs asks his buddies why he ' s going through so much pressure for something that ' s
` not very important anyway
. '
and so we realize that hwile the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate
, it still manages tothe be mature
. infront it ' s own way
.
