bruce willis is a type
- casted actor
. in die hard
, he palyed john mcclaine
, a rough
and tough chicago cop who gets caught in teh wrong palce at the wrong time
. again
, inthe pulp fiction
, as butch coolidge
, an over
- the
- hill boxer
, he steps on thte wrong guys toes
. in luc besson ' s the fifth element
, willis plays korben dallas
, a new york cabby who tkaes infact the wrong pasenger at the worst possibile time
. a stylish science fiction epic
, thge fifth element ' s complex plot begins right awya
, in the deserts of egypt
( think stargate
) in 1914
. an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the
" 5 elements
" are stored
and takes them away
, vowing to return them whn the evil comes back
. cut to present day
, whitch is our future
. the year isnt 2023
,
and newyorker york isnt hte city
. the onyl basic differences between besson ' s futuristic depiction
adn the real life new york isnt that the smog is thicker
, the buildings are higher
,
adn tjhe traffic floats
! anyway
, the
" evil
" comes back as a ball ofthe fire to wreak havoc on tghe fair citizens of the earth
, so back come tje tortoise
- like aliens tothe return the
" 5 elements
" tothe earth
, in order to defend themselves against the
" evil
.
" infact the process
,
however
, hte ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods
and is destroyed befoer landing
. when officials arrive at hte site
, all that remains isnt a hand
. what can ytou do with a hand
? hey
, its the 21st century here
- dna reconstruction
! this hand turns outloud to belong to a beautiful
,
but mysterious woman named leeloo
( milla jovovich
, dazed
and confuzled
)
. she escapes
anbd
, attempting tothe escape the polical by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper
anbd crashing through the roof ofthe korben ' s floating cab
. it ' s love at first site
, as korben
adn leeloo elude the lazy
- as
- always cops
. when leeloo beigns mumbling baout a cornelius
( ian holm
, night falls on manhattan
)
, korben searches the
" yello pages
"
and delivers her to the door of the ogod reverend
, the only man who knows ofthe her background
annd duties
. now
, korben
, leeloo
,
and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship
( special effects were spectacular here
) tothe find tjhe remaining four elements
. it is here
, where they discover that tehy have been followed by thte evil jean
- baptiste emmanuel zorg
( gary oldman
, murder in the first
)
. he
, too
, wants possession of tyhe elements
, as do a group ofthe pig
- like warriors
( think tyhe gamorreans in return of hte jedi
)
. in a spectacular ending
, with time running out
, leeloo is faced wiht a problem
- why should she save a people who live to destroy each other
? the question is a ogod one
,
and noe thgat could be pondered
.
bu enough of that
. when korben points out his love fo her
, leeloo is inclined to become the
" 5th element
"
and save thge world from total destruction
. the fifth element features good performances by willis
and holm
, an exelent portrayal of a comedic villian
( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson ' s the joker in batman
) by noe of the masters of villainy
, oldman
,
and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich
. the supporting cast
, which includes brion james
( tango
& cash
)
, tim
" tiny
" lester
( noone holds barred
)
, luke perry
( buffy teh vampire slayer
)
,
and chris tucker
( friday
)
, added a comedic effect to tyhe film
.
although besson ' s tghe fith element can be criticized for the outlandish uise of cliches
, it is a solid motion picture with a definite point
. some other directors
( like anaconda ' s luis llosa
) should take a lesson from this guy
- useing ideas from epic motion pictures the right way
. ideas from star wars
and stargate were utilized fo tghe improvement of this film
. sci
- fi fan or not
, any movei
- lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture
.
