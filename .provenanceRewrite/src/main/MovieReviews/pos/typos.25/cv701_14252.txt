] modern society is now inundated with omre sex
and sexuality thna it ever has been before
, from teenage sitcoms tothe nc
- 17
- rated films about fetishes
. the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or jsut reflects it
.
" your friends
and neighbors
" takes a different approach as it ' s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex
and how can be used for both pain
annd blessure even withing a small circle ofthe friends
. one of the most importamt aspestus of tyhe film thyat most be noted
and analyzed before hte film cin really be dissected as a hwole isnt writer
/ director neil labute ' s basic setup
and soem ofthe the unique methods he employs to tell the story
. firstly
,
anbd most importantly is tje fact the script tells a rather complex
, detailed story of lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocricy
, greed
,
and just plain stupidity between six different characters
( threee men
, three womens
)
, without hardly any supporting characters
,
( a few have a line or twpo
)
, mostly extras
. everything they dont will somehow affect another charater
annd ultimately come full
- circle bakc tothe themselves
, whther it be positve or negitive
.
but to jstu state tihs is arbitrary
,
and explaining
adn criticizing the process isnt difficult
. labute ' s ability to tell his storey through a few charactors is a remarkable feat
,
but waht ' s specifically impressive is the fact the charachters ' names are never revealed until the end credits roll
. for the sake ofthe htis review
, i will discribe thge characters
and refer to them as their main characteristic
. anyother interesting accomplishment is the fact eveyr scene takes place inside with limited focus
. we ' re allways able to tell where the characters are
( someone ' s home
, the gym
, a restaurnat
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
,
but what the city they live in
, what year it isnt
, what teh society is like
, etc
. is relatively unknown
. the film is a complete character study with the tight
, intense drama of the theater
. noone one plot dominates tje story
, which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack ofthe background
. we ' re simply dropped in on the characters ' lives
and are expeced to figure outloud the rest
. thte characters are a group of middle
- class white people who are all successful at whta tehy do
,
but they ' re onyl concern right now seems to be thier sex lives
. frist htere ' s barry
( eckhart
)
and mary
( brenneman
)
, a married couple who are oging through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don ' t know whta tehy ' re problem is
. barry isnt kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife
,
annd the sex they have
,
bu doesn ' t have a lot of ambition
- he just follows everyone else
. mary is a writer of some sort
,
but lacks aggresion
and emotion like her husban
and is thte meekness character
,
but ironically
, doesn ' t hesitate to commit adultery jsut to feel something
. labute ' s scirpt does a ogod job in characterizing mary
and barry as individuals
,
bu is very light onthe chemistry
and connection bewteen the two
. obviously
, this is thge theme
, which isnt enhanced by the actors ' good performances
,
but at thge smae time seems jsut a bit hollow
. another couple is jerry
( stiller
)
and terri
( keener
) who live together
anbd seem to have been involved whith each other for a long time
,
yet they constantly argue over anything
annd everyting
. their sex life is also fraught with problems
adn forthe some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship
. if onyl one aspect of the film could use improvement
, it would be this area
. it ' s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other
,
but why would two people who can bearly stand each other continue to have sex
anbd live toghether
? what did they ever see inaddition the other person tothe begin withthe
? labute never relaly answers
,
bu sicne the film is more concerned with the payoff thna hte process
, it still makse fo good drama
, tension
,
anbd manip ulation so intricate
and deceitful it ' s fascinating
. two other characters ect as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
)
and cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary isnt an arrogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines the word
" bastard
.
" somehow he is able tothe bend womens to his will
, either through charm or just attitude
, into getting his way
. he ' s the kind of guy everyone should stay awya from as we realize he ' s secretly perverted
,
but somehow barry finds comfort in his company
,
altough jerry is always nervous arround him
. patric gives an oustanding performance
, so much so tht we want to know more about him despite how intimidating
and unlikable he is
. cheri is a chracter labute uses as a catalyst to see how tje other charactors react to her
. she works in an art museum
and at some point throughtout the film
, each character will engage her in alomst the excact same conversation
and her reaction is always diffrent
, from becoming involved in a relationship with one
, to brushing it off as small talk with anohter
, to bieng outright apauled by
yot another
. she ' s a sweet woman
, perheaps the most normal ofthe any of the characters
,
and
although her symbolism is obvious
, her role as the outsider is the most relatable
. i will not reveal who cheats on who
annd how each chracter is specifically affected by the others ' acation
, as taht ' s the hook of the film
. the first two acts beign to set up the characters
and each ' s scenarios
,
bu it ' s oftenly difficult to tell what they will dont about it
and with whom
. the result is sometimes surprizing
, other times predictable
,
but the actual course of actions is allways fascinating
. for a while everyone has their fun
,
but ultimately each charater ' s guilt
, attitude
, or ignornace will disserve them
. noe of yhe most important thigsn to note is how realsitic the story is suppossed to be
. sicne tghe characters only interact with each other ther isn ' t much pop culture refrences
, as almost everything has a deeper philosphy behind it
. are we to assume that theese people are
, as the title states
, our firends
and neighbors
? i don ' t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people
. often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama
, other times situations are like thsoe nto seen outside a porno movei
.
but what htis film does hve thast the others don ' t is repercussions in the end
.
although the film creates its own reality
, it goes to show taht even the immoral aren ' t immortal
. in what way
" your firends
and neighbors
" is supposed to work is open to interpetation
. it definatly has a lot to sday about teh price that comes wiht infidelity
,
but it coudl have beeen even better had it expanded onthe tyhat theme more specifically
. still
, it ' s an accomplishment in film
- makeing becasue it hasnt put a timeless theme into a modern prespective
.
