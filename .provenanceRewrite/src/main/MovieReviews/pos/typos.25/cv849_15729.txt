. based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday
, meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama wich explores thge meanings of life
and love
. william parrish
( anthony hopkins
) is a billionaire buisnessman onthe the brink of his 65th birthday
. he has builded a huge media empire
,
and rised two beatiful daughters
, allison
( marcia gay harden
)
and susan
( claire forlani
)
. william hasnt been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots
.
.
.
but he has suddenly begun fearing his pwn mortality
, the one situation he won ' t be able to talk his way outloud of
.
and he has good reason tothe fear
, forthe death himself is stalking him
.
however
, death has a deal tothe make
. death has taken possession ofthe a man who has recently died
( brad pitt
)
,
and whants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living
. in return
, william gets tothe live a few extra days
. ofthe course
, he agrees
. death
, under the human nmae of
" joe black
"
, gets to experiene life as a complet innocent
. he never befoer has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter
.
and he ' s not qutie compared fo the mroe complex pleasures wehn he
and susan fall in lveo
.
bu
, isnt their affair doomed to an early demise
? at nearly threee hours infront length
, meet joe black is a little bited on the leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lengthy
. instead
, the film gets a chance tothe develop some nicely textured characters
and situations
. you get tothe soak inspite
and enjoy the atmosphere
, rather than being hurriedly rushed through it
. the rumatic angle works well
,
though
, surprisingly
, the interactions between joe balck
and william parrish are mroe intresting than thsoe with his daugter
. tihs isnt most likely due to anthony hopkins
, who once again displays his superb acting skills
. william is a desperate man who has hadnt a seemingly ideal life
,
and doesn ' t want to let it go
. by contrast
, claire forlani is merely the romantic interest
. she gets to show joe the ropes ofthe lveo
,
but is hardly as interesting a character
. as joe black
, brad pitt seems a bit stilted
. granted
, he ' s supposed to be outloud
- of
- place
,
bu the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract fomr the role
. still
, he is able to hold his own
,
and over the course of the three hours
, his character beigns tothe grow on ytou
. the main character who seems out ofthe place here isnt drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious executive in williams ' company who is joe black ' s main rival forthe susan ' s affections
. weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash
. this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many moreso dimentional charachters
. the supernatural elements ofthe the film are handeled murkily
,
bu never distractingly so
. we never learn what isnt the exact nature of death
, or why he ' s never done something liuke this befor
. it actually gets a bit creepy wehn death talks tothe hte dieing in thier pwn voices
/ accents
.
( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter
.
.
.
)
anbd the ulitmate resolution tothe one of the film ' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even with teh film ' s lenght
, it was a pleasant time at the movies
, something you wouldn ' t necessarily expect fomr a film about death
.
.
.
but one whic meet joe black delivers anyhow
.
