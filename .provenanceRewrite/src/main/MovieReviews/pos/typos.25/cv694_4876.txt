alchemy isnt steeped in shades of blue
. kieslowski ' s blue
, tyhat isnt
. with its examination ofthe death
, isolation
, character restauration
,
adn recovery from loss
, suzanne myers ' new independent film echoes the polish directer ' s internationally
- acclaimed 1993 release
. language aside
, the principal difference between the films isnt that
, while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main carachter ' s world
, alchemy keeps its viewers at arm ' s length
. as a result
, while we ' re able tothe appreciate the film ' s intellectual tapestry
, it is emotionally distant
. alchemy is divided inot three chapters
:
" charity
"
,
" faith
"
,
annd
" hope
"
. while there are common themes
and story elements running through all three
, the single constatn is the main character
, a sculptor
/ russion translatro named louisa
( rya kihlstedt
)
. whn the film opens
, she ' s living with her painter boyfriend
, whom she believes to be cheating on her
. follwoing his sudden death in an automobile accident
, louisa ' s life is thrown inot turmoil
. events swirls around her
,
and she can ' t find a source of stability
. inthe her quest to mkae sense outloud of her loss
, she befriends her lite boyfriend ' s mistress
, visits her ill sister
,
and
, eventually
, abandons her ood life by joining a
" back
- tothe
- nature
" cult
. alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues
. in addition to asking the basic question of how a person shoud coppe wih the unexpected death of a loved one
, it probes beneath the surface ofthe concepts liuke the importance ofthe faith in the healing process
, the meaning of lvoe
,
adn the nature of art
. doesnt personality restoration cmo through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar
? are artistic epiphanies the result ofthe focused solitude or ofthe living life
, with all of its various distractions
, tothe the fullest
? myers ' challange is to make these subjects
, art film staples
, engrossing inaddition a new context
. through louisa ' s struggles
, she succeeds
. while achemy isn ' t always emotionally appealing
, it never loses its fascination
. even when we ' re not connecting with louisa
, who is oftenly more of a locus for ideas than a fully
- developed perosnality
, there ' s enough material on
- screen tothe hold our attension
. the cinematography is stunning
. city scenes are tinted wih blue
, adding a cold
, bleak dimention to the film ' s early portions
. later
, when louisa reaches the
" wilderness
"
, we ' re treated tothe a dazzling array ofthe autumnal splendor
-
- brightly
- colored leaves in yhe trees
and on the ground
. it ' s a startling
-
but
- effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking palce in louisa ' s life as she travels thge road back to emotional stability
. the title referrs to the pratice of a group of mystical faith
- healers who uise
" lchemy
" to provide for tghe needs of tje body
and soul
.
annd
,
although louisa partakes of theri peculiar brand ofthe medacine
, it ' s ultimately love
and companionship
, not alchemy
, that brings solace
. her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of thge beleif thgat the inherrent saftey ofthe being alone isnt life ' s ulitmate goal
. even
though louisa ' s fianl transformaton lacks the inpact it could hvea possessed had she been a more vital character
, it ' s still an intriguing
annd enlightening proccess to watch
. alchemy isn ' t pure magic
,
but
, especially during its best moments
, it ' s close
