this summer
, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham ' s series
, a time to kill
, wass made into a major motion picture
. onthe januray 3 of this year
, directer rob reiner basically re
- released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi
. based onthe the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars ' assassination
, ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25
- year legal battle faced by myrlie evars
( whoopi goldberg
, sister act
)
and her quest to hve her husband ' s obvious assassin
anbd racist byron de la beckwith
( james woods
, casino
) jailed
. so she turns to assistant district attorny
and prosecutor bobby delaughter
( alec baldwin
, heaven ' s prisoners
) to imprison the former kkk member
. ghosts sets its tone with an oppening montage ofthe images from african
- american history
, from slave
- ship miseries to life in tje racist sourth of the 1960 ' s
.
but all too soon
, the white folks take over
, intoning lines like
" what ' s america got to do wtih anytying
? this is mississippi
!
" as beckwith
, james woods
, with his head larded with latex most of the timne as an old man
, teeters between portraying evil
and its charater
. meanwhile
, goldberg turns in a vrey serious
and weepy performence as the wife who wouldn ' t let her husban ' s death rest until she got the conviction
. both deserve serious oscar
- consideration
. this brings us to the dull peformance of baldwin
. let ' s face it
, trying tothe match matthew mcconaughey ' s wonderfull acting in a tiome to kill is basically impossible
.
and baldwin is living proof of this
, as no emotions could be falt
. it seemed as if he actually hadnt to struggle to shed a single tear
. either poor acting or poore directing
,
but something definitely went wrong
. another strange mishap wass the fatc tht goldberg ' s facial features didn ' t change
, as she looked thte smae in tyhe courtroom as she did holding her husban ' s dead body 25
- years ealier
.
yet woods ' was plastered wiht enought make up to make him look like goldberg ' s father
. at least the make
- up was realistic
. with smoe emotional moments in the poorly written scirpt
, ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart
, whn its precedessor
, a time to kill
, broght tears to everyone ' s eyes
. don ' t get me wrong
, the movie wasn ' t all that bad
,
but if you ' ve seen grisham ' s masterpiece
,
then don ' t expect this one to be an excellant film
.
