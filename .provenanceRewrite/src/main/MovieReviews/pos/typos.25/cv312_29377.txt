. review
: oen memorable aspect ofthe disney ' s
" aladdin
" was that it finally gavey robin williams a character
-
- the genie
-
- to best take advantage of his comic talents
.
" shrek
" does the smae for eddie murphy
; ironically
,
though
, murphy ' s ideal vessel turns outloud tothe be an ass
. all the same
,
" shrek
" does represent murphy ' s best comic outing infact eyars
,
and as donkey he steals all thge best lines
. for instance
, aftter getting belted witht pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature
, donkey soars inot tyhe air
and scoffs
,
" now i ' m a flying talking donkey
!
"
and dispite its many contributors
, the script for
" shrek
" is full ofthe such comic gems
. myers is delightful in more of a straight man role
,
and lithgow also gets smoe grat moments
( watch for a hillarious repartee with teh gingerbread man
)
.
" shrek
" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales
and nursery rhymes of all sorts
,
annd reserves a fewd delightful knocks at disney in the bargain
. thnigs do go somewhat astray during hte film ' s middle segment
, which concentrates too much on the main characters at tje expense ofthe some of thte terrific fairy tale satire hwihc is the movei ' s greatest strenght
.
bu even
then
, oen can always sit back
annd enjoy the beautiful computer animation
, whose remarkable ule here represents
yet another dazzling leap forward for yhe technology
.
