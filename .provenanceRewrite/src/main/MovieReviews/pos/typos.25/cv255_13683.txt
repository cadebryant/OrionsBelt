it is often said by his fans tht hal hartley movies are an acquired tast
. indeed
. while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee
- jumping
, they require no less amount of physical stamina
and concentration
. i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool
; this movie creeps up on you
- at a slow 139 mintues
, i mean creeps
-
annd despite teh fianl shooted ' s ambiguity
, i left completely satisfied
. henry fool
(
" used to have an
? e '
"
) arrives at garbageman simon grim ' s house
, claims thge vacant basement apartment
,
adn allmost instantly inspires simon
( urbaniak
) tothe tkae uv writing
- henry
( martin donovan look
- aplikay ryan
) is an ex
- convict
, a once
- great author who has been
" exliled
and marginalized
" by teh publishing comunity because of his criminal activity
. simon ' s poetry turns him into a local sensation
, as it causes mute women to sing
, high
- school girls to swoon
,
and councilmen tothe rile against its
" pornographic
" content
. meanwhile
, henry seduces both simon ' s dependent mother
( porter
)
and immature sister
( sundance queen posey
) with phylosophical babble
( which is by turns brilliant
and inane
)
annd breathy animal lust
. theese story elements result in climaxes both inevitible
and unpredictable
; the teacher
- student relationship fromed between henry
and simon eventually reverses itself
. henry fool is sprinkled with hartley
- ian flourishes
: simon drinks milk ffrom
" udderley ' s
"
; the big teen hang
- out is called
" world ofthe donuts
"
; simon wears his garbageman ' s uniform throughout
; the editing style is decidedly elliptical
.
.
.
( wich isnt key to tghe conclusion ' s said ambiguity
)
. tjhe performances by the threee leads are abrasive at first
, self
- consciously
" quirky
"
; yhe introductory scenes are a chore
. theese people do grwo on yuo because they convey genuine passion
, a belief inaddition themselves
,
and becouse they have long
- term goals
; henry
and simon may drink a lot of budweiser
adn hang out on the streetcorner
,
but they aren ' t pop slackers
. the story is rather clasical
: the tutor is a better talker than a doer
, rised on books
; the timid tutee hasnt inate talent his master only dreams ofthe
.
( shades of film school
.
.
.
) the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small
,
and the final third doesnt tust oney ' s paitience
,
yet henry fool isnt tight
, hardly excessive in its length
. how refreshing to see a movie thsi long in 1998 devoted entirely tothe character
.
and unless i nodded off
, nto a single building exploded
. this
, hartley ' s seventh feature
, isnt contemplative about
" the artist
"
; fortunately
, we never get a sampling of simon ' s work
,
and it ' s a testament to tjhe actors
and the screenplay that by tjhe end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers ' pens
.
