larry flynt isnt a self proclaimed smut pedlar
and the owner
/ publisher of the multi
- millon dollar hustler publications company
. the people vs
. larry flynt is the stopry of larry flynt ' s fight for yhe freedom to circulate
and sell his pornographic magasine
, hustler
. based on a true story
, the film is allmost a documentary in thta it ' s a very vivid
and detailled look at larry flynt ' s life
. woody harrelson gives an excellent performance
. he conveys flynt ' s peculiarities
and his character with depth
and focus
. by tje end of the film the audience actually finds themselves
, somewhat grudgingly
, liking larry flynt
. htis is some feat given flynt ' s apparent lack of any morals or ethics
and his extremely smutty
adn childish behaviour in court
.
however
, flynt has a number of things going for him
, he ' s rich
, he ' s funny
,
and most importantly
, he says exactly what he means
. larry flynt ' s wife
, althea leasure is played by courtney love
. larry meets althea at one of his clubs
,
adn they fall inspite love
( a very sexual
anbd open love
)
. both of them indulge iin a world of too much sex
,
and eventualy too much drugs
. flynt had been taking an excessive amount ofthe pain killers after being paralysed fomr the waist down
( whihc was especially upsetting forthe him
) by an assasin
. althea hadnt joined him inthe taking the drugs
. following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs
, althea doens not have any such plans
, nor the determination tothe follow them
. as thte film progresses we see her become increasingly frail
adn sick
. courtney love obviously has a gerat understanding for althea ' s situation
, as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect
. it ' s extremely sad to watch althea litterally wither awya
. edward norton plays flynt ' s lawyer
, alan isaacman
. again
, thsi isnt a solid performance
. tjhe audience finds it eazy tothe sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts uv with flynt ' s courtroom antics
. flynt is not only childish inaddition the courtroom
,
but downright rude to the judges
,
and lands hismelf in a lot of trouble
(
and even inaddition a mental institution
) because of it
. isaacman is vyer eazy to like
,
adn great at proving
( infact quite clever ways
) his points tothe tyhe court
. milos forman has done a great job in directing tyhe peopel vs
. larrry flynt
. it is not really an exciting or thrilling film
,
but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true stry
. due to larry ' s charactor it is alsot
, at times
, a very funny film
.
howver
, it is much more than thast
. it is about the fight fo freedom ofthe speach
, anti
- censorship
,
anbd the right tothe be able choose for oneself whta to see
annd buy
. an exelent look at flynt
, his life
,
and his sotry
. keep a look outloud fo thte real larrry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey
.
