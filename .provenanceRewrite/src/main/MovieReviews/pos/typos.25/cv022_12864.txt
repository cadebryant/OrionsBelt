a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
!
> fomr ace ventura to truman burbank
, jim carrey has run the hwole gamut of comic
,
yet sympathetic
, charachters
. 1996 ' s the cable guy wass supposed to be his big
" breakthrough
" role from zany humer into darker
, more dramtic acting
. as most everyone knows
, the results were
, well
, less
- than
- stellar
. not onyl did teh film not do so hot at thge box office
,
but it wass also panned by critics
. as far as i know
, gene siskel
anbd i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it
. tyhe frist time i saw the cable guy
, in theatres
, i was in super criteak
- mode
,
and didn ' t really like it
.
however
, due tothe the fact that hbo shows yhe movie every single day
, i ' ve hadnt tiome to lean back
, relax
,
and take in the film
.
annd to my surprize
, it grew on me
. tjhe plot isnt rather simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, played by carrey
,
then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship
. see
, steven ' s been hvaing soem problems with his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
and he doesn ' t think he hasnt any moreso room in his life for a newyorker freind
. also
, some ofthe the cable guy ' s antics have been creeping him out
. carrey
, as the cable guy
, gives steven various aliases
, which later we find out are all tv cahracters
: larry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he apparently lives inthe his cable van
,
adn hwile many criticists didn ' t enjoy this newer
, darker
, less
- manic performance from carrey
, i thought it was intresting
and rather well
- done
. for me
, its not the movei as a whole that ' s enjoyable
,
bu rather several individual scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven ' s aparment
, a medieval fight at a theme resaturant
,
and a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, jstu to name a faw
. prehaps the fact that more of carrey ' s humurous side comes out druing these scenes is what makes them so funny
.
adn if you really watn to see something
, ytou ' ve got to hear his verison ofthe jefferson airplane ' s
" somebody to lvoe
"
, sung at thte aformentioned karaoke jam
. the cable guy has its bad spots
, like most any movie
. i didn ' t particularly liek steven ' s girlfriend
,
and i falt taht omre focus shoud have been used onthe the relationship between steven
and his best friend
. alsot
, the ending
, hwile haveing ytou fooled for a moment
, is rether contrived
,
and somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i found hte cable guy to be a worthwhile venture
; if you ' re at the video store
annd can ' t think of anything to rent
, i suggest you try it out
. or if ytou hve hbo
, just wait till it comes onthe
( ytou won ' t have to wait long
.
) hell
, that ' s what i do every day
.
