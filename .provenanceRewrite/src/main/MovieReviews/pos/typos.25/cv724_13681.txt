after indecent proposal
and up close
and peronal
, redford was wise to direct hismelf in a picture at lastr
. redford may look grat on
- screen
,
but over the past few years
, he ' s proven himself a bigger talent behind teh camera
. ordinary peple is noe of thge best films ofthe the nineteen
- eighties
,
and it was the first picture he helmed
. while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic
- realism with
.
.
. um
, realism
,
and i ' ve never been much of a fan ofthe a river runs through it
( to tghe chagrin ofthe many
)
, quiz show was dazzling
, energetic
and convincing
. the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return tothe nature films
and the first time in that sub
- genre redford seems equally concerned with humans
and scenery
. scott
- thomas plays annie maclean
, an uptight
bu respected newyorker york magazine editor whose daughter grace
( johanssen
) loses a leeg
adn a good freind when an early morning ride climaxes with theri horses colliding with a semi
. grace ' s horse survivied
,
but bearly
,
and has gone mad
. annie refuses tothe put the animal out ofthe his misery
, beleiving that if teh horse heals it iwll mend grace ' s newly
- broken spirit
. eventually
, mother
anbd daughter travel alone to montana to be witht tom booker
( redford
)
, a famed
" horse whisperer
" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks
and touches
, leaving busy husband neill behind
. eventually
, tehy move onto teh booker ranch with the rest of tom ' s family
,
and annie finds herself falling inaddition love with all things montana
, including
, naturally
, tom
, the wise
and lonely trainer
. tjhe horse whisperer is delicately made
. i dabree say lyrical
, usance to many people ' s ear
, that word is synonomous with boring
. hardly
. tyhe horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprize
,
bu it doens have an honesty that is refreshing
and consistently enjoyable to watch
, especially in thte final third of the story
. scott
- thomas
and johanssen seem like mother
and daughter
,
and you have no doubt beleiving that tje mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell
, especially since d
. p
. robert richardson ' s photography casts montnana as heaven on earth
.
( a gimmicky
bu effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish tothe widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana
.
) the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt
, emotive performance as thge nice
- guy husband
, who is as authoritive
and likeable as toom
. he isnt indeed a refreshing chanage from tghe sexist
, lout of a husband so many writers resort tothe as a short
- cut forthe explaining away tghe cheating spouse ' s motivation
. unfortunatley
, one of the horse whisperer ' s onyl flaws is thge chemistry between would
- be lovers scott
- thomas
and redford
. i liked both of them
,
but i didn ' t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish
, even if thte countryside air thawed her slightly
. luckily
(
and curiously
)
, this is such a rich
and textured movei that it doesn ' t qutie matter
- theri adultery seems like an afterthought
, the obligatory sub
- plot that ties many of the characters ' complex relationships together
.
