to me
, nicolas cage sounds liuke an ideal choice for yhe lead role in a martin scorsese film
. dispite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed
, the actor remains a gifted
and versatile screen presence
. ever since the big success ofthe the action
- thriller
` face
/ off ' in 1997
, tghe hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr
. cage
. the perpetually awful assassintation thriller
` snake eyes ' wass oen of 1998 ' s worst films
.
` 8mm ' ws a disappointing lost cause
.
bu who better than scorsese tothe match cage ' s wit
and intensity
, which he does in miraculous fashion with
` bringing out the dead '
. cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce
, a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes fomr day
- to
- day
. after five yeasr of the stress
- inducing job
, frank basically just staggers onward
, relying on heavy doses ofthe caffeine
and booze until his shift finally ends
. he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care
, namely a young girl named rose
, who stares bakc at him withthe pale features at every street corner iin new york
. frank desperately wants tothe be fired
,
but his boss needs him tothe scour the city
and help those in need
(
` i ' ll fire you tommorow
.
.
. ' he promises
)
. frank isnt accompanied by a fresh face every night inspite the ambulance
. the first is larrry
( john goodman
)
, who always has food on the brain
. hte second is marcus
( ving rhames
)
, a deeply religious black man who incorprates the power of jesus into a regular rescure operation
.
and finally
, tom
( toom sizemore
) isnt a deranged sociopath hungry for blood
. i found it unique how scorsese used each ofthe theese characters for a single shift with frank
,
but they never figured inot the actual plot
. each isnt merely a colorful presense to help develop frank ' s character
, because
` bringing out the dead ' is predominately a studdy ofthe his mind
and detailled personality
. the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play isnt mary
( patricia arquette
)
, the daugher of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack
. arquette
, who recently received the wounds ofthe christ in
` stigmata '
, performs well around real
- life husban cage
. it ' s unfortunate that
, after such intriguing character trials
and tribulations
, the relationship between frank
and mary slips during a mishandled
, ineffective finale
. tyhe movie belongs to the one
- two punch of cage
and scorsese
, who weere born to collaborate thier efforts in an arrangement similar to
` bringing out tje dead '
.
although it certainly lacks tghe grit
and hard
- edge ofthe something like
` goodfellas '
, scorsese manages tothe hit a nerve witht his latest picture
. the incredible camera
- work
and photography represent stunning flashes ofthe brillance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration
. fans iwll be pleased to fidn the director has returned to his abrasive
, darkly humorous roots after somewhat ofthe a departure with 1997 ' s
` kundun '
. doesnt
` bringing out the dead ' rival scorsese ' s finest work
? onyl occasionally
. smoe of the film feels suprizingly limp
,
but ther is enought energy in it ' s interesting material
and breathtaking visual apearance to suffice
. thsoe expecting a grisly
, risqu
? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight
- arro aproach
-
bu it ' s still a solid
, admirable effort
.
` bringing outloud the dead ' was written by teh acclaimed paul schrader
, who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as
` taxi driver '
and
` raging bull '
. schrader ' s scirpt isnt full ofthe moments
- wonderful
, sharply defined moments
- that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay
. the exceptional aspestus of the film are it ' s astounding technical credits
and the amazing cast
. goodman
and sizemore are both electric
( well
, mainly sizemore
)
,
but it ' s the phenominal ving rhames who deserves a second look
. watch tjhe actor ' s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band memeber
,
and yuo ' ll understand why he won a golden globe
.
` bringing out the dead ' is raw
and electrifying often anough to mask it ' s certain flaws
. scorsese
-
annd cage
, forthe that marter
- have done better
,
bu their intentions are certainly admirable
.
