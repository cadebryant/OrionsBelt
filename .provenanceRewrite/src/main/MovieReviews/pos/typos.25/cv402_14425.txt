in some respects
, rush hour isnt the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking
. the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone
. thge cop iin question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble
. all chinese people are somehow involved in tghe criminal element
. the duo must always be completely mismatched
. the hero has to say soem smart
- assed comment befoer
(
and after
) shooting somene
.
howver
, that doesn ' t necessarily mkae for a bad film
. rush hour is jackie chan ' s first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector
( 1985
)
. proving once again that hollywood can leran many things from ofreign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan is given much more free reign thna befoer
. still
, smoe die
- hard jackie chan fans may be dissapointed
, as even chan himself hasnt voiced displeasure over the lenght of the fight scenes
( which he views as too short
, according tothe oen interview
)
. this film takes a familliar theme of east meets west
. jackie chan is lee
, the straight laced inspector who is imported to help dael with a kidnapping case
, while chris tucker is carter
, the loudmouthed
, destructive cop that is
` promoted ' to the fbi to halp him
. or
, at least
, so he thinks
( also another classic notion in action films
: the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes
)
. dispite the necessary conventions of action films
, rush hour is some of the most funn you ' ll spend
and hour
and forty mintues watching
. jackie chan continues tothe be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen
, continuing to perform his own stunts
and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks
and punches
. chris tucker
, familiar fomr his whiny
, annoying role in tghe fifth element is more palatable
, complementing jackie chan ' s straight
- laced carachter
.
however
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expected of him
and his films
. perfectly downplaying the
` fish
- out
- of
- water ' routine thru his character ' s attemts at mixing inot american culture
, he makes uv for the down tiem his character experiences
. when he isnt in action
,
however
, you ' ll be amused
annd dazzled
. still bieng inventive in the use of objects to beat people uv
( in this case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
,
and a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker ' s character may cmo across as irritating
,
yet is aslo humorous
. since he ' s nto a physical actor to the level of jackie chan
, he uses his main weapon
: his mouth
( hence
, the tagline
,
` fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west '
)
. while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare
, it is appropriate for yhe film
and still veyr funny
. while not neccessarily poignant
, attempts at character development
annd growth between characters come off surprisingly well
. lee ' s
` knowledge ' ofthe american pop culture
(
` that ' s thte beach boys
! '
) when contrasted against carter ' s lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an intresting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick
, while carter teachs lee hip
- hop dance moves
. while rush hour is not at the smae levle as police story 3
and 4
( known inthe noth america as supercop
and jackie chan ' s first strike
, respectively
)
, it omre than mkaes up for hte poorly recived films operation condor
anbd mr
. nice guy
. with its appropriate mixture of high kicks
and lots ofthe laughs
, it makes for a fun film
. as well
, it is a true departure from jackie chan films
, as it is missing noe common element
: a whiny female co
- star
.
