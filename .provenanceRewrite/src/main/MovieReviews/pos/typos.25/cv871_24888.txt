, the series ' new agent phelps
, takes ethan hunt

)
, wants to use the desease
and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company inot selling him enough stock to make him owner ofthe teh company
( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak ofthe the virus he is going to cause
)
. posing as ethan hunt
, ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long anough to get only tjhe cure
, not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with hte virus tothe prevent exactlly what ambrose ws trying to do
. the rela ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautifull theif nyah nordoff
- hall
( thandie newton
) to assist the imf team in retrieving tjhe stolen goods
. ethan
and nyah fall quickly in love

. reluctantly
, he sets up nyah to be rescued from prision by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound
and send back inetlligence to thte team
. ethan must race against tiem to keep ambrose from obtaining
and spreading the virus
and prevent any harm fomr coming to nyah
.
although the first mission
: impossible film wass a moderate box office succsess
, audiences panned it because they falt the plot was too confusing
anbd there wasn ' t much action
( altho being a fan of the series both old
and new
, i thought teh movei was pretty decent
and especially gutsy tothe mkea phelps a bad guy
)
. thast problem has been rectified inwhich the sequal by making the plot more accessbile
( courtesy ofthe one of tjhe writers ofthe thge previous entry
, robert towne
)
adn by turning the film into oen gigantic action setted piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo
. the end result is one of the most entertaining
(
yet simple
) acation films made in a long while
. unfortunately
, the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow
, dwelling mainly onthe ethan
annd nyah ' s quickly blossoming romance
and seeming omre in place inthe a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission
: impossible tv series
. ethan ' s conflict is a compelling one
,
but it seems very rushed
(
anbd comes baout because of a near futal car wreck that ethan himself causes
!
)
. john woo handles all of this whith an artistic flair that seems out of place
, featuring a great deal of slow fades
and dramatically framed close
- ups
. the surreal nature of theese sequences are distracting
adn ultimately a detriment tothe hte film
. thankfully
though
, at the point ambrose dicovers nyah ' s deception
, mission
: impossible ii becomes very entertaining
and acation
- packed
. robert towne ' s screenplay tkaes smoe ofthe hte conventions setted uv inaddition tje first film
and parodies them durring a sequence where ethan must break into a high
- rise buildng
and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus
. after that
, the action scenes jsut begin to build in intensity
, as is tje case wiht many of woo ' s previous high
- octane films
. the final half hour isnt an all out assault of action
( a ogod deal of which is ruined by the trailer
, unfortunately
)
. as far as summer entertainment goes
, mission
: impossible ii is serviceable fare
. anyone looking for hardcore action won ' t be disapointed
( except fo durring the first half of the film
, perhaps
)
. even if you weren ' t a fan ofthe tje first film
, this entry deserves some checking outloud
