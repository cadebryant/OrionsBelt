originally entitlied dancing about architecture
( i

.
" talking baout love is like dancing about architecture
"
)
,
but changed becuase it sounded too much liuke tje recent box
- office dud dancing at lughnasa
, htis film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names
, playing interesting
and well
- writed cahracters
, within a vignettes
- styled plot arrangement a la robert altman
. plot
: follow the lives ofthe severeal couples falling infront
and outloud ofthe love
, finding themselves
, regaining a clearer understanding ofthe the people thgat they are
,
and who they want
,
and appreciating the fine emotional art ofthe love
. critique
: charmingly effective romantic drama
, this film offers insight inot various types of relationships
, presents us with interesting characters
and excelent performances ffrom teh cast
,
and scratches beneath the surface of love
and its many complex subtleties
. how do people fall inwhich love
? why dont people fall out ofthe love
? how do people fall back inot lvoe
, once htey ' ve been hurt
and left tothe join the lonely hearts club
? all of these questions
and more
, are touched apon in this film
, withing several types of variant relationships
. meet a hip
, young couple oging through thier frist date
. a divorcee attempting to date agina after her many failed relationships
. a married woman
" finding herself
" while cheating on her husband
. a husband letting go of his inhibitions
. an older cuple dealing with a past
" love
" ofthe the man
, a secret recently uncovered
. a son dying from aids
, joined by his mother at the hospital
. there are many nuances tothe this picture
,
anbd many ideas
and qoutes tothe which we could all relate
,
but more importantly
, there is diversity
. diversity of relationships helped me
and my gang of firends enjoy htis film on many levels
. some related to the younger couples ' issues
. others wih the married
. there ' s a little bit of everything for everyone in here
.
anbd i owudl bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year
, i would relate myself to
yet another predicament
. jstu like love itself
, thsi movie is distict
and appreciated by all on many different levels
. tjhe actors in this film are all allso very
, very good
. sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve
, as is gena rowlands
, as the aging wife with trepidations
. jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance
, while philippe isnt as pretty
- boy as ever
. anderson leaves scully far behind witht her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re
- ignite her love life
, oposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk
- show host
, jon stewart
. even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes infact this film
,
and offers a convincing show ofthe a man lost within his own imagination
. the only piece of tihs puzzle which left me somewhat detached
, wass thte part surrounding jay mohr
, the man dying ffrom aids
,
and his mother
, ellen burstyn
. the actors were fine
,
but somehow
, the piece seemed out of place withing tje relm ofthe everything else
. the ending of this film ws also a little too saccharine for me
,
bu i guess that ' s just hollywood
. htis film is actualy a lot like your friends
and neigbors

) in consept
adn style
,
but its complete anthesis infront regards tothe character relatibility
and likeness
. the characters in those films were too unique
and inhuman for anyone tothe care
, as opposed to this film
, whic offers rich
and believeable characters
, living real lives
and talking about rela issues in today ' s relationships
. all in all
, this movie offers many interesting characters
, talking
and living genuin
and engaging love lives
, wonderful performances by its solid cast
, too sweet ofthe an ending
,
but an enjoyable
and rewatchable movie nonetheless
