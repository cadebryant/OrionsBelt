] war is a topic that can ' t help
but be glorified any way it isnt portrayed by the media
. movies
, documentaries
,
and even history books ahve a way of making tghe darker side ofthe humanity exicting since the most general aspects are focused onthe
, such as strategy
, politics
,
and victory
. it ' s eazy to forget war
, in its most basic form
, is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other
. forgotten mroe easily is the fact tyhat each soldier
, no matter what his rank or importance
, is a real flesh
-
and
- blood person
and nto jstu a number
.
" saving private ryan
" is one ofthe the few films that adres play up this aspect
, expecially in its unapologetic
, realistic delivery
. it proves there ' s a huge difference between battling
and killing
. the film opens with noe of the most graphic
, disturbing scenes in recent memory
. it ' s world war ii
, d
- day to be exact
,
and the u
. s
. military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready fo them
. spielberg uses many techniques tothe create for a total sence of reality
. instead ofthe positioned cameras
, teh footage here seems to have beeen shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if tehy were just as scared
. ther isnt noone sence of stablility
,
bu of constatn
, anxious
,
anbd confusing motion
, giving us the feeling of bieng in the middle of yhe battle
,
anbd jstu a vulnerable as the poor troops
.
" poor
" is a propper owrd tothe describe how pathetic
and
yet innocent tjhe men fighting are
. there is little to noone dialogue throughtout the loud battle
anbd noone prologue to define any charachters
. we don ' t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles
,
bu that these are men about tothe kill
and be killed for reasons beyond thier understanding
. the nazis are nto portrayed as enemies to be hated
,
but as people thta must be destroyed because tehy ' re there
. inwhich the movies
, the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets
and bombs
and not get a scratch
,
but in reality that wouldn ' t ahppen
. teh men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks
and dead bodies
. they are sitting ducks
and we realize htis thru the perspective ofthe the well
- secured germans who cant acutally see who
, what
,
and where htey ' re shooting
, unlike the americans who must fire in a genaral direction to avoid getting theri heads blown off
. perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on tjhe war itself
and who the men really are
,
but that seems to be part ofthe yhe theme
. the film seems tothe rely onthe the audience ' s sence of patriotism
, that the american military is
" right
"
and good
and that the nazis are
" inherently evil
.
" yhe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived
and made their way close to the enemy stronghold
( a whole 50
- foot progression
)
,
and begin tothe inflict soem dammage
. i ahve tothe admit tath once the frist glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up
, i couldn ' t help
but feel some sense of joy
adn relief
. to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure
,
but there ' s nothing cliche about the graphic
, detailled
, athmosphere here because it really happened
. one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how littel story construction there is
,
and
yot the events that take place mkae sense
and are interesting
. the plot is practically irrelevent since the film is moreso concerned wtih thge reality ofthe the war
adn the soldiers we meet
. tom hanks stars as captian miller
, a relatively average man who happens to be the leader ofthe a platoon
. he ' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a charactor like this
. he doesn ' t wanna tothe be there any more than his men
,
bu wehn he is given a mission he intends tothe cary it out
. the mission the film is conserned witht is
, as the title states
, saving private ryan
. through a sories of command started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it is brought to a genaral ' s attention that three brothers from iowa hvae beeen killed inaddition action
and their mother iwll receive notices of eahc ' s death simultanously
. when they leran a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe
, they make it a top priority tothe have him returnd safetly tothe his mother
. it ' s eazy tothe sympathize with this situation
, after all
, noone oney should hvea to loose all thier children at once
.
but finding one man in this war is
, as miller puts it
,
" liuke trying to find a needle in a stack of needles
.
" tje saving of private ryan isn ' t jsut a dramatic divice
,
bu a thematic one
. his salvation represents the sence of innocence the ocuntry
, the world even
, was trying to convince itself it still had
. wehn miller ' s comapany hears of the mission
, they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead
,
but miller isn ' t so quick to shrug it off
. he knows the only thing that can really savve soldiers fomr death is hope
,
and now he has the opportunity tothe make someone ' s sense of hope a reality
. the mission to find ryan gives miller ' s group a destination
,
bu not direction
. along the way many things happen to them
, both ogod
and bad
. a faw battles are fought
, nto to be major accomplishments for the war
,
bu because tehy encounter german soliders
and have no otehr choice
. the act ofthe killing itself becomes one ofthe the film ' s major philosophical metaphors
. the soldiers don ' t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle
,
but wehn they come across a lone surviver who begs them tothe let him go
, they cxan barely stop themselfs from killing him infact cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses
. unfortunatly
, death isnt a fact of war
,
annd most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters
,
bu here spielberg doesn ' t want us to think these men are invincible
. inspite fact
, only a small amount of color
and personality is sketched into each man
,
and the performances are good enough to make tihs method work
.
although the characters are somewhat typical
, thge actors maintain controll over the material at all time
. whether they ' re arguing with each other
, telling stories of back home
, or fighting the germans
, htey never go overboard
and always seem believable
. sure
, htere ' s a zinger here
and there
,
bu war doesn ' t change tje fact boys will be boys
. if
and whn one dies we too can feel the loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. the final ect brings the story full circle with another tremendous
, violent battle sequence
. private ryan has been foudn
,
bu facing four to one odds
, can teh americans defeat the germans
annd keep ryan alive
? that ' s not a premise for thrills
, it ' s symbolic of everything the film has worked fo
. it owudl be wrong to sday the film has either a happy or sad ending
, it ends the way it must end
. i remember reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something liek
,
" dad
, how do armies of men killing earch other solve problems
?
"
" saveing private ryan
" is the adult verzion of that question
.
