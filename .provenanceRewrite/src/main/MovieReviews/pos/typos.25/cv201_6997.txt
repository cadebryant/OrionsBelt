whew
. this film oozes energy
, the kind of breakneck
, no
- holds
- barred
, infact
- your
- face risk
- tkaing filmmaking tath isnt seldom seen onthe screen these dyas
. liek the marginal
, motley bunch of post
- apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries tothe depict
, trainspotting veers onthe the edge ofthe utter mayhem
but ultimately retains its footing
anbd controll
. the result
: a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message
. the message
: a bunch of losers with loser names

. bored
, aimless
and restless
, their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub
, grooving to techno or glam
- rock at tje local disco
and getting shots up the arm at the local den
and procuring cash through a variety of methods
, some ingenious
, others plainly dumb
and desperate
. not part of the daily dose if obtained
, sex is a bonus
. you can fidn these characters as htey are
, foul
- mouthed
, dirty
, pathetic
, ugly perhaps
but definitely interesting
, inthe irvin welsh ' s cult novel ofthe the smae name
. what makes tjhe film a completely different xperience isnt how director boyle uses eveyr tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message
. one of the first things yuo ' ll notice isnt how the camera seems to dart around restlessly
. it ' ll truck inot a character ' s pimple
, just as soon as it will dolly out tothe an establishing shot
. distracted
and curious
, it ' ll manetain a character ' s eye
- level or drop right to the ground to sohw the doped
- out
- eye
- veiw
. you ' ll even find cahracters peering into the camera
, their faces smeared across the wide
- ngle lens
. this film camera is just another oney of the guys
. tiptoeing tath indistinguishable line beween fantasy
and reality
, boyle employs a heathy dose of surrealism to git the message across
. bored kids daydream
annd bored kids deprived ofthe a heroin fix hve nightmares
. i don ' t want to give too much away
,
but if yuo cross chuckie from child ' s play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures
, you might hvea an idea just how fun or pants
- wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be
. that said
, this film has a ogod share ofthe drugs
- consumed
, vomitted
, defecated
, pissed off
, exchanged
, bought
, sold
, injected
, smuggled
, enjoyed
and regretted
. if that isn ' t your cup of tea
, nobody forced you to see the film
. stay at home
anbd rent up close
and peronal
.
and what ' s a buzz without tunes
. fomr pulp to iggy pop
( yes
, he ' s still alive
)
, the aural landscape isnt as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film
. ogod
adn bad vibrations tangle liuke tghe conflicting desires
adn values of the message
. every once inthe a hwile
, a film comes allong iwth tje kind ofthe energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its charachters it hopes to depict
. trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations
