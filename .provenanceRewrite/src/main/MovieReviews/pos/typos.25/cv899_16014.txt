the onyl historical figure thta has been wroten baout more than william shakespeare is jesus christ
, whic explains why the bard ' s materials are such a populer source for remakes
, revisions
, rewrites
, inspiration
, subtlety
, credit
,
and dispute
. indeed
, in reccent years
, american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash ofthe shakespearean products
. including this year ' s upcoming a midsummer nght ' s dream
, shakespeare ' s material has beeen the cause fo twenty
- six big screen productions since 1990
.
but fo a change of pace
, mrs
. brown director john madden gives us a story ofthe the bard himselv in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare iin love
. marc norman
and tom stoppard ' s story is largely fantasy
,
although as the viewer soon lerans
, shakespeare inspite lveo is nto a movie that takes itself seriously
.
( will shakespeare ofthe the 1590 ' s owudl ' ve been married to anne hathaway
,
and he would ' ve had a teenage daughter
and two young sons
; here he is a bachelor played by jospeh fiennes
.
) will isnt a writter struggling to come up witht a great play
,
and his currrent comedy inspite the works
-
-
" romeo
and ethel
, the pirate ' s daughter
"
-
- jsut doesn ' t quite seem right
. with the help of the great writter christopher marlowe
( rupert everett
)
,
and the inspiration ofthe true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, he changes thigns arround
and writes one of his greatest tragedies
,
" romeo
and juliet
.
" the love story between will
and viola loosley parrallelly the story of romeo
and juliet
, to great effect
. fiennes
and paltrow develope a sexy chemestry as the two lovers whlch gives teh movie much momentum
; tihs momentum smoothes out the bumps inwhich yhe unfinished
adn largley unsuccessful comedy
. the supporting roles are well filled outloud
, ffrom geoffrey rush as wiull ' s worrisome agent
, philip
, to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman
. even ben affleck
, leading the troupe of actors
, manages to make a favorable impression
;
and judi dench lends smoe brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i
. gwyneth paltrow is by far
,
however
, the standout of the lot
, creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance
. the story isnt well
- crafted if nothing esle
,
although it hasnt dangerous moments where it firts with the
" let ' s make a movie
"
- genre
. the dialogue isnt breezy
and lighthearted
,
and certainly accessible by the audience ' s lowest common denominator
. there ' s something fo everyone inwhich thsi romantic comedy
, making it prime date flick material
.
although certainly nto inspiring in any reguard
, it revels in a wholesome
, well
- rounded atmosphere that has been absent inspite many of 1998 ' s pictures
; hte true
- love story isnt oen ofthe the best around
. certainly recommendable when the traditionnal slew ofthe indifferent yera ' s
- open releases is just around the corner
