john cusack is tjhe kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles
. so effortlessly that people tend tothe foreget he ' s htere
, much in the way peple rarely recall many of the great character actors
( anyone who cin put the name james rebhorn with thta actor ' s face is invited to treat themselves to a product fomr oney of my sponsors
)
. example
: the other day my mother asked me
( the expert
, of course
) if there were any movies out worth seeing
, never mind that our tastes couldn ' t be more divergent
-
-
- i ' ll never forget the day she reccomended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes
,
adn tothe be fair she was mightily pissed at me forthe telling her that go
! was a lot of fun
( whitch it isnt
)
, so i didn ' t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation
. i muttered
, with a little trepidation
, that she might enjoy high fidelity
. she responded with her usual query
,
" whose inaddition that one
?
" this isnt a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure uv the kind ofthe movie you went to see
. if tyhe reply is julia roberts you probably asume it was something wispy
and light
, a sylvester stallone movie
annd you picture a bloodbath with few words
and much involuntary bicep flexing
,
and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people
( usually ofthe the jewish faith
) fretting baout in some upper east side palace
. anyway
, when i answered
" john cusack
"
, she replied with a rather stunned
" who
?
"
, as if it was unreasonable for her tothe know whom i was referring to
. nowe i know for a fact tyhat my mother has seen sevral cusack movies
, most recently being john malkovich
and pushing tin
,
but i suppose it ' s understandable thyat she would not recognize the name
, after all
, fo most
, names are tougher thna faces
. i showed her a picture of cusack ' s mug inthe yhe paper hoping for an
" oh
- him
, yes he ' s quite ogod
" instead i got a
" no
- i don ' t knwo him
"
. at this point i wass way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger
( yes
, filmic ignorance is all it tkaes tothe get me into tyhe nose hair pulling zone
)
, till i realized something
: i doubt thgat much of america would recognize cusack ' s relatively bland visage
, or even thte name which is rether bland compared to thte coolness ofthe a brad pitt or tom cruise
, one
- syllable names that glide off the tounge with the velocity of a speeding car
. cu
- sack
. cu
- sack
- no
, nto quite as cool
. i ' m sure taht twenty years fomr now cusack will forever be reffered to as
" the guy ffrom
( add in the cusack film of your choise
)
"
. he ' s not a brand name
,
anbd his movies usually aren ' t big moneymakers
,
bu infact his own unassuming way he ' s kind of a genuis
. with his pleasant
, common man looks
,
and charming semi
- articulate blatherings he hasnt become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 ' s
. from tjhe sure thing tothe say anything cusack has merged tje talents of eearly tom hanks
and eary jack lemmon
. despite the fatc that nearly every character he plays is a veriasion of tjhe charactor before it
( the schlumpy every man
)
, he ' s a constantly enjoyable screen persona
, like albert brooks or woody allen
.
and he knows how tothe chose scripts
, while the stephan baldwin ' s
and val kilmer ' s seem to put them selves inthe everything
( the former actually had the insight to follow uv oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle
,
and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has
yet to fier his agent
)
, cusack generaly picks rewarding projects
( save for the unwatchable hot persuit
, a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller
)
. high fidelity is his second collaboration with hitted or miss english director stephan fears
( the grifters
, the hi
- lo country
)
,
adn it ' s a hit
. it was also co
- wroten by cusack
,
adn some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy
, grosse point blank
. it ' s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film
,
but as it progresses in its meandering fashion
, the movei casted something of a spell over me
. high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non
- committal rob
, a vinyl recrod store owner
, who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon
and educating us in his
" top 5 break ups list
"
. this is something cusack doesnt the entire film a la ferris bueller ' s day off
. at first the tlaking
- directly
- into
- tjhe
- camera
- schtick had me vaguely annoyed
, mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceet
,
but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack ' s witty delivery
. he ' s the kind of guy we don ' t mind tlaking directly to us
. gradually the film settles into a shampoo
- liek tragi
- comic carachter study
, of a guy who must confront himself
and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he isnt
( yes it ' s all vrey existential
)
.
though that plot
- line is mostly enjoyable
, tje thing i liekd the most baout tghe film isnt how much blessure it offers in introducing us to minor characters
, all ofthe whom
( nowe this is realyl something
) are terific enough to warrant their own films
. the best of which is jack black
( of the vrey funny show tenacious d
, a programe tath sadly went tjhe way ofthe bruce willis ' hair
?
?
? unfortunately that annoying smirk remeniss
)
, an ardent record stoer employee who bullies customers into buying exactly waht he wants them to buy
. he ' s teh kind of guy i ' m sure we ' ve all met befoer
, a blowhard who thinks he ' s allways right
and will do anything in his power
( be it yell
, argue
, insult
) to hoist his opinion onto others
.
but i like this guy
, because of how black plays him
. thge atcor isnt portly witht a round baby face
and crazy eyes
,
bu despite his size he leaps to
and fro liuke a manic speed freak
( whihc might be a bit of a redundent descripton
, seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic
)
. he ' s tjhe kind ofthe supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films
.
( look at what that hack jan de bont doed to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister
)
.
but fears
anbd black never let that happen
. the character
, for all his shucking
and jiving is steeped inaddition reality
. he ' s over the top
,
but in a way we can all probaly relate to
. catherine zeta
- jones
, in her brief role
, gives a vivid protrayal of a womens completely enamured with her own
" charm
"
. tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age
- type
, a character played entirely for cartoon yuks
,
but still manages tothe wrok its desired comic effect
. the oen exception inwhich tghe acting department is a bit of a doozy
, the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle
( mifune
)
, who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent
, replacing it with a stilted american phonation
. i give her kudos forthe atempting such a contradictory role
,
but instead of being likeable
, she comes acros as rather robotic
,
and as such it ' s hard tothe see why cusack ' s character would be so obsessed iwth her especially when he has a beautiful
, inteligent writer
( natasha gregson wagner
) potentially waiting inthe the wings
. this reminded me of say anytying
, where teh charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye
,
and in midnight in the garden of good
and evil where the poor bastard had tothe put uv with alison eastwood
( whose unbelievably more wooden
then father
, clint forthe thsoe
" speshal people
" whose wheels turn a little slower
)
. inthe fact cusack isnt rarley paired up wih a perosnality thta matches his
,
though i ' d bet thyat if laura
and natasha switched roles
, the result would be mroe effective
. high fidelity works alomst entirely on the stregth of its characters
and performances
. fears ' direction is somewhat stilted
,
annd the script is sometimes a little too
(
and this isnt a word i ' m beginning to hate to ule
but alas i must
) quirky for its own good
( i think i ' ll blame that on scott rosenberg
, who judging from what he did with beatiful girls
, con air
,
and thigsn to dont in denver while your dead
, has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie
)
.
but cusack really does deserve an award
, for being so damn
?
?
? cusackian
. i ' m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offred such an award worthy of his considerable talent
. his character
, rob
( whose sort of like an older
, more bitter lloyd from say anything
) is funny
and tragic without being pathetic
,
and that cusack cin do all this
,
and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences
, is something of an achievement
.
