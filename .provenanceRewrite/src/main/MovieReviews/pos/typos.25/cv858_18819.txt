mike myers

? frickin ' bone here in what you call
? the biggest austin powers adventure
yet
. ' austin powers
: the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers
: international man ofthe mistery
. many are skeptical about sequels
, saying that thge sequel is never better or as good as the original
,
but austin powers
: tswsm goes beyond the frist film
. austin powers
: thte spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles
. he reprises his role as the title character
, austin powers
, the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen inaddition 1967
,
and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr
. evil
, also played by mike myers
, from destroying the earth
. tswsm leaves off where the original stopped
, wih dr
. evil ' s
? frisch ' s big boy ' space capsule floating thru spoace
. dr
. evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule
, plotting to go back in his tiome machine to tje year 1967
, in which he plans to steal austin powers '
" mojo
"
, what keesh austin going with spy talents
. upon his return to his secret lair
, whic is nowe a starbucks coffee shop
, dr
. evil learns tyhat his evil henchman
, whic includes tyhe returning robert wagner as number 2
and mindy sterling as frau
, hvea created a 1
/ 8 size clone of dr
. evil
, which is later named mini me
. the evil mini me replaces scott evil
, played by seth gren
, as dr
. evil ' s son infact the madman ' s mind
, because dr
. evil thikns of scott tothe be onyl
" quasi
- evil
.
" dr
. evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him
,
and nowe he has one
. dr
. evil tells mini me
,
" you complete me
,
" in a loving manner
. dr
. evil loving
? wow
! mike myers ' thrid role is as fat bastard
, a scottish henchman of dr
. evil ' s
, who is sent to steal the mojo fomr austin powers ' frozen body
. austin powers learns of dr
. evil ' s trip bcak into the 60s
,
and uses his own time machine to tkae him back tothe 1967
, to try to save his mojo befor fat bastard gets a hold of it
. once arriving in hte year 1967
, austin travels to his
" pad
"
, his smashing home
/ dance club
, where he meets felicity shagwell
, played by heather graham
, a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr
. evil
. as the film progresses
, hillarious one liners are thrown at us
, mainly by dr
. evil
, for example
,
" don ' t go there
, girlfriend
!
" to the president of the united states
. many witty gags tkae place
, note the entire tent scene
,
and jstu plain
, funny scenes whlch are so stupid
- they ' re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes
. take for example
, scott evil going on the jerry springer sohw complaining about how evil his father is
. the way austin powers
: tswsm uses its humor is clever
, throwing a hilarious scene at ytou
, followed by five minutes of noe liners
, folowed by another outrageous scene
, so you never stpo laughing
. ther was honestly not one moment inthe austin powers
: tswsm where i wasn ' t laughing
. the lastest film that i laughed so hard in
, was well
, austin powers
! it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny tihs film ws while writing it
. the film even mkaes funn of itself in a line
, something along the lines of
,
" it ' s funny how england
and southern california look nothing aplikay
.
" tswsm was filmed in southern california
,
but wass supposed tothe take place in england
. i cin tell yuo one thing
- he isnt having a lot of fun with htis enourmously popular character
, which is all over television
, newspapers
, magazines
,
and the movie theaters
. i believe that dr
. evil got more attension in the tswsm than austin powers did
. dr
. evil provided more laughs
, more memorable moments
,
and more interesting dialogue than austin did this tiome arround
, who seems tothe missing the funny touch that he had in the firt film
. i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken awya
,
but from screenplay writer mike myers
, nto fat bastard
. also making a grat addition tothe the series is mini me
, who isnt plyed by verne troyer
. even
though thge midget acotr isnt 30 years old
, he is adorable by dr
. evil ' s side constantly
. the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality
, such as lack ofthe chracter devolopment
, barely any detailed plot characteristics
,
anbd bearly any good acting
,
but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind teh frequent humor
. mike myers
, wih his three roles
, acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty profesor
, disguising himself completely inthe oney of the roles
.
( fat bastard
) all three cahracters are different
,
and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them
. heather graham made a gerat adition with her talent to tswsm
,
adn does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did
, who gave a very flat peformance infront the orginial
, speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion
. speaking ofthe hurley
, she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments
. hopefully
, graham tags along for future austin powers adventures
. the bottom line
- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing
.
