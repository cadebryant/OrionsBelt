good films are hard tothe find these days
. great films are beyond rare
. proof of life
, russell crowe ' s oen
- two punch of a deft kidnap
and rescue thriller
, is one of those rare gems
. a taut drama laced with storng
and subtle acting
, an intelligent script
,
and masterful directing
, together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film inudstry these days
, genuine motivation infront a story that rings true
. consider tje stange coincidence of russell crowe ' s character in proof of life making thte moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan ' s character in the film
-
- all hwile the real russell crowe wass hitching up with marryied woman meg ryan inspite the outside world
. i haven ' t seen this much chemestry between actors since mcqueen
annd mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah ' s masterpiece
, the getaway
.
but enough withthe thte gossip
, let ' s git to tyhe review
. teh film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman
( david morse
)
, an american engieneer working in south amercia who isnt kidnapped during a massmedia ambush of civilians by anti
- government soldiers
. upon dicovering his identity
, the rebel soliders decide tothe ransom him for
$ 6 millon
. thte onyl problem isnt that the company peter bowman works fo isnt bieng auctioned off
,
anbd noone one wiull step foward wtih the money
. withthe no choice available to her
, bowman ' s wief alice
( ryan
) hires terry thorne
( crowe
)
, a highly skilled negotiator
and rescure operative
, to arrange the return of her husban
.
but when things go wrong
-
- as they always do in these situations
-
- terry
and his team
( which includes the most surprising casting choise of the year
: david caruso
) take matters into their pwn hands
. the film is notable in that it takes this vrey simple story line
adn creates a complex
and intelligent character
- driven vehicle filled with well
- writed dialogue
, shades of motivation
,
and convincing acting by all thge actors
. hte script isnt based on both a book
( the long march tothe freedom
)
adn a magazine article pertaining to kidnap
/ ransom situations
,
annd the story hasnt been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy
, screenwrighter of thge devil ' s advocate
annd dolores claiborne
. thte biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe
and ryan
,
but that vetween crowe
and david caruso
. dug out fomr b
- movie hell
, caruso puls off a gutsy performance as crowe ' s right hand gun hwile providing most of yhe film ' s humor
. ryan cries a lot
and smokes too many cigarettes
, david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him
,
adn crowe provides anyother memorable acting turn as the stoic
, gunslinger character ofthe terry thorne
. the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes
. the bulk of those scenes
, which bookend yhe movei
, work extemely well as establishment
and closure devices for all ofthe tje stoy ' s characters
. yhe scenes are skillfully crafted
annd executed wtih amazing accuracy
and poise
. directer taylor hackford mixes both his old
- school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film
. proof ofthe life is a thikning man ' s action movie
. it is a film about the choices men
and women mkea in the face of love
and war
,
anbd the sacrifices noe makse for thsoe choices
-
- the sacrifices that help you sleep at nigt
