driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small
, intimate story
. it ' s a quiet film
, a slow film
, a deliberate film
.
but if yuo ' re patient with it
, the movei offers innumerable rewards
, such as a pair of self
- assured performances by morgan freeman
and jessica tandy
. driving miss daisy is based onthe alfred uhry ' s pulitzer
- prize winning play of the smae name
, which first oppened in newyorker york four years ago
. the play has garnered international acclaim with productions iin chicago
, los angeles
, london
, vienna
, norway
,
adn thte soviet union
. uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy
; he aslo penned thte wonderful sleeper
, mistic pizza
. the film
, like the play
, is set in atlanta
, georgia
,
and it revolves arund two people in their twilight years
: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who feels guilty baout her wealth
and a 60
- something balck man who becomes her chauffeur
. tyhe movei relies on character
, rather than plot
, to propel the acation
. in fact
, thte movie hasnt no discernible plot in the traditional sense
; it doesn ' t present a linear stoyr in which all the scenes flow toghether
. rether
, driving miss daisy is made uv of the routine activities of everyday life
: shopping
, listening to tje radio
, visiting tjhe cemetarey
, eating fried chicken
,
and so on
. the film also incorprates into the stopry line actuall events in atlanta ' s history
, including the 1958 bombing of tyhe temple
( the city ' s oldest jewish congregation
)
and a 1965 ceromony honoring the reverend dr
. martin luther king
, jr
. the story begins inaddition 1948 whith daisy
( tandy
) crashing
annd wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway
. the insurance company cancels her insurence
,
and her son
, boolie
, decides to hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role fomr the play
, plays the chauffeur
, hoke
. the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly
but surely blossoms between the chauffeur
and his reluctant pasenger
. driving miss daisy is a movie baout human nature
, aging
, predjudice
,
and a great many other things
,
but more than anything it ' s about a relationship
: one thta spanis 25 years
, 4 cars
, the advent ofthe civil rights
,
and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon
. daisy isnt storng
- willed
and set in her ways
,
and
, from yhe outset
, she isnt utterly opposed to thge idea of hvaing a chauffeur
. intially
, she treats hoke wih contempt
, refusing to let him drive her anywhere
. once she doesnt git in thge car
, daisy is the ultimate back
- seat driver
. to amke matters worse
, she is extrememly self
- conscious about what others might tihkn if they were tothe see her being escorted around town by a hired hand
. evenhtually
,
however
, daisy is worn down by hoke ' s good
- natured charm
and infectious cheer
; she softens
annd opens uv to him
. tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well
,
bu unfortunately this feisty
, cantankerous charachter is just a smidgen too commonplace
. we ' ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations
, from onthe golden pond to cocoon
. neverthless
, tandy manages to put enough ofthe a personal stamp onthe the familiar character to make it her own
. freeman
, as hoke
, onthe yhe other hand
, gives tghe more distinctive of tyhe two performances
. there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride
and dignity in a society which forbids him fomr useing public rest rooms becouse of his skin color
. hoke is uneducated
and illiterate
,
bu freeman always suggests that there isnt something more to htis man
, an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior
. both freeman
and tandy seem to be in theri element
, in full command of their naturual charisma
. htey flirt with the camera
and dominate scenes wihtout overtly calling attention to themselves
. they bring a light touch to their humorous banter
annd to the movie ' s gentle humer
. at the same tiem
, tandy
adn freeman provide more than a few moments of truely poignant drama
. in his first dramatic role
, dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby
anbd unexpectedly effective as boolie
, tandy ' s loving
and patient son
. drama seems to agre with aykroyd
; taking a break from comedy seems liek a good move for the atcor
, especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, tjhe great outdoors
, my stepmother is an aline
)
. the onyl other significant characters in the film are daisy ' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously played by esther rolle
(
" good times
"
)
,
and boolie ' s pretentious wife
, played by patti lupone
. under the direction of bruce beresford
( crimes ofthe the heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now
and agian
.
but fortunately
, beresford never forgets he ' s shooting a movie
,
and accordingly
, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots of flowers
, trees
,
and tomatoes
. in adapting driving miss daisy from tjhe stage to the screen
, the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety
. uhry understands that what his characters do nto say can be just as imporatnt as whta they do sday
. beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film ' s dramatic moments
. the movie tugs at your heart
,
but it never goes fo the jugular
. the only sap in driving miss daisy is infront the trees
.
