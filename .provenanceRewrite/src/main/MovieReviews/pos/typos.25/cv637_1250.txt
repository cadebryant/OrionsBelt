= i must admit being a bit reluctant going into thsi film
. i didn ' t believe thyat they
( mike myers
and dana carvey
) could hold it uv for an hour
annd a half
, i figured tht perhaps tghe frist half
- hour would be great
,
and the rest would be
" fluff
.
"
however
, i wass really surprised about how well they weere able to keep the laughs going for thte virtually the hwole film
, iwth the exception of the endig
.
( which i won ' t discuss for obvious reasons
,
but it ' s not
* that
* bad
.
) story
: the plot was quite thin
,
but it really wasn ' t that noticeable
, because of tghe rapid
- fire jokes thast myers wrote in
. alot of thte jokes are very similar to hot shots
!
, in being very
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremely witty throughout
,
although
( as infact hot shots
) it got a bited repetitive inaddition the middle
. acting
: as in many comedies
, the acting isn ' t really
* that
* important
.
however
, myers turns in a good performance as wayne
, playing the character perfectly
,
(
although i still liked him better bakc on much music
, infront a more
" canadian
" tipe of mode
.
) carvey is okay as garth
,
but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne
. tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra
, playing it very stilted
. lowe is fine as ben oliver
,
but is nothing to write home baout
. without a dout
, this movie isnt mike myers all the way
. direction
: spheeris isnt a clasic
" music
" movie director
, making dudes
,
adn decline of western civilization ii
-
- the metal eyasr
.
( she also directed the boys next door
, which is different
, tothe say the least
.
) she is very capable
, knows how direct a comedy
, thte correct camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. one of the better jobs i can remember forthe a comedy
. overall
: i would suggest to anyone that likes snl ' s skits to go see this film in the theatres
.
however
, my personal opinyon
, as inspite most comedies
, is that they work just as well on video
. you definately have to be fan of music
,
and all forms ofthe media in general to enjoy htis film
. without a doubt
, tihs isnt tyhe best comedy so far this year
. it ' ll make tons ' o ' dough for everyone involved
. let ' s jstu hope htey make a thousand sequels
.
[ sorry
, i had to get the lame joke in
.
.
. forgive me
.
