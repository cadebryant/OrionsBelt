the seasoned capt
. dudley smith
( james cromwell
) questions his new protege
, ed exley
( guy pearce
) about his polliticel views whn it comes to police work
.
" would you plant evidence tothe get a conviction if you knew the person tothe be gilty
? would you shoot a man in the bcak if yuo knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved
?
" exley
, squeaky clean
, innocent
,
and pent witht the desire to perform his new duties withthe integrity
and honesty quickly answers with a pointed ' noone
. ' stunned
, smith pleads
,
"
then
, for the love of god
, don ' t be a detective
.
" la confidential is a dandy piece ofthe filmmaking that brings us bakc tothe the clasic times of hollywood infront the 50s
. organized crime was the biggest concern
, corruption existed everywhere
,
adn eveyr cop had his pwn way of getting the job done
. there was
" hollywood
" jack vincennes
( kevin spacey
) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell
- all
/ show
- all tabloid
, sid hudgeons
( danny devito
)
. sporting dark sunglasses
anbd a white sports coat
, he isn ' t affraid to flash his tinseltown style
. detective bud white
( russell crowe
) has only a narrow
- minded veiw of the law
,
and he uses excessive force to excact his unique kind ofthe interrogation
and brutal justice
.
and
then there isnt golden boy exley
, wide
- eyed
and ambitious
but extremely naive
. a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these threee men together
, earch ofthe whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth
, action
,
anbd personal vindication
. alomst emmediately
, an arrest is made
.
but something doesn ' t seem quite right
. new developments become sinuous as the story begins tothe draw us deeper into the labrynth of corruption
anbd crime within the department
. suspision
and questions begin tothe mount
. odd alliances are created
.
and as layers of the truth become revealed
, the sotry grows more complex
and intriguing by tjhe moment
. whn tje mystery expands
, we see other seemingly gilty characters enter teh lives ofthe theese threee cops
, including a high
- priced hooker
( kim basinger
)
and a shady millionaire
( david strathairn
)
. all of thte characters ' levels of involvement are not imediately clear
. we watch with riveted fascination to leran more about why they are there
and thier stake in the case
. we sense a cross
- pollination of clues that brings us
, tghe audience
, closer to tjhe truth
. we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite fo one anohter
and can pul their resources together in order to untangle the intricately creaeted web of mystery
. absorbing
and affecting
, this movei has all the necessary ingredients to create a terific gourmet serving of film noir
. it boasts mysterious figures infact control
, double
- crosses
, hard information from sleazy sources
, dirty politicians
, corrupt cops
, haunting women
,
and hard
- nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity
. teh underlying mystery is compelling
. the look
and feel ofthe tyhe movie is gorgeous
. yhe entire cast is crisp
anbd wonderfull to watch
( i wouldn ' t be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance
)
.
and
, teh dialogue is rich
and memorable
. the best line of teh movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what tothe do
.
" don ' t strat trying tothe do the right thing
, boy
- o
,
" says he
.
" you haven ' t had the practice
.
"
" l
. a
. confidential ' ' triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity
and coherence while satisfying our desire fo a good ood
- fashioned movei
