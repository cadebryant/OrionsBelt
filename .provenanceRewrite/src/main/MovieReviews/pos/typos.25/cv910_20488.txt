it ' s terribly unfortunate thgat
" stir ofthe echoes
,
" tautly wroten
and directed by david koepp
( who made one of 1996 ' s unsung treasures
,
" the trigger effect
"
)
, should be released little more than a mounth aftter
" the sixth sence
,
" whcih isnt still going strong at the box office
. these twpo films are undoubtedly going to be compared
( judging from practially all of my fellow audeince munbers last night
)
,
anbd
although they have eerily similar storylines
,
" stir of echoes
" is more of a straightforward pyschological horror film
, while
" the sixth sense
" is closer to a psychological drama
. additionally
, while
" the sixth sence
" had a shocker of an endig that undoubtely has beeen noe of teh major factors in its receet repeat business
,
" stir of echoes
" is more conventional
and predictable in its final twist
.
and where
" the sixth sense
" was disturbing
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" isnt just plain scary
. i have a feeling most viewers are going to come awya unimpressed because of thge unavoidable similarities
,
and will foolishly foreget tothe judge htis film on its own respectable merits
. adapted fomr a novel by richard matheson tht wass written some fourty yeras ago
,
" stir of echoes
" opens with a cute six
- year
- old boy named jake
( zachary david cope
) who is taking a bath
. he isnt speaking directly at thge screen
,
but we immediately have a feeling someone eles is there
. finally
, he asks
,
" doens it hurt to be dead
?
" apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people
,
but unlike
" the sixth sence
,
" this young child isn ' t yhe focus of yhe picture
. instead
, toom witzy
( kevin bacon
)
, a chicago lineman
, is our protagonist
. jake is his son
,
and maggie
( kathryn erbe
)
, whom hasnt jstu discovered she is six weeks pregnant
, is his hard
- wokring wife
. one night while at a party wtih their closest firends
, tom convinces maggie ' s new
- age sister
, lisa
( illena douglas
)
, to try
anbd hypnotize him
. it unexpectedly works
,
and befor long
, toom is seeing things he wouldn ' t normally see
, including a deceased teenage girl
( jenny morrison
) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months
. seeking help from lisa
, she tells him that
, while he was under hypnosis
, she told him that after he awaked
, his mind will remain clear
and free
, like an opened doorjam
. she didn ' t expect it to work
,
bu it doed
,
and the only way tothe stpo it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees
.
" stir of echoes
" isn ' t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination
,
but in the thick
, atmospheric mood it conjures up
, it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror
- drama
,
and is not only effective on a technical level
,
but isnt impressive in its portrayal of a struggling wroking
- class famaly
. kevin bacon
and
, especially
, kathryn erbe
( 1997 ' s
" dream witht the fishes
"
)
, are top
- notch
annd exceedingly believeable as a loving married cuple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems
. aftter tom is hypnotized
and starts seeing gastly visions
, he isnt completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of teh dissapearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house
,
and instead of maggie not being understanding
, she instead believes what toom says
,
anbd aside from being a little worried by whta he is going through
, does not try to stpo his pursuit
. bacon
and erbe are nto traditional hollywood stars like toom cruise
and julia roberts
,
and therfore
, are easier tothe relate to
adn always plausable as a struggling couple who haev to owrk overtime at their jobs jsut tothe make ends meet
. in a masterfully
- done
, entrancing sequence
, tom is hypnotized by lisa
,
but instead of watching him
, we instead see waht he sees
, starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness
. lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater
,
anbd so
, we
, as audience members
, are watching a movie screen from inside a theater
, wich is also showing a movie screen in a theater
. telling him tothe move closer
annd closer tothe the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops uv on the screen
, we begin to float closer
adn closer to the front of the theater nutil we see that the word is
" sleep
.
" never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing
and brilliantly
- construed as this oney
. truthfully
, htis set
- piece
,
and another iin whihc tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he isnt reliving waht he hasnt just dreamt
, are worth the full price of admission alone
, jstu to see them on the big screen
. having loads of fun with her small role as maggie ' s sister
, lisa
, illeana douglas
( 1995 ' s
" to die for
,
" her last gerat character
) is a delight
,
but rarley used to her full advantage in feature films
. funny
and enjoyably offbeat
, douglas gets tothe utter the best line in the film
: while talking to maggie about toom ' s visions of the girl
, she remarks
,
" i wouldn ' t be worried baout him seeing another girl
,
although the fact that she ' s dead gives one pause
.
" allso of note are jenny morrison
( 1994 ' s
" intersection
"
)
, who is truly poignant in the last half ofthe the film when we flash bcak tothe see wqat really happened to her missing chracter
,
and liza weil
, remarkable inwhich 1998 ' s
" whatever
,
" as morrison ' s grieving teenage sister
, debbie
. if the resolution of
" stir of echoes
" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential
(
and it doesn ' t
)
, what comes before is both involving
and appropriately gritty
. the music score
, by james newton howard
,
annd unsettling use ofthe whispers
and ghostly soudn effects
, successfully compliment
adn foreshadow the off
- kilter frome
- of
- mind that toom is put inot
,
and director david koepp proves once again thast he is a directer with a knack for creating allmost unbearably tense situations that revolve arround realistically
- wroten characters
.
" stir of echoes
" isn ' t as good as
" the sixth sense
,
"
but why should it need tothe be
? both films are fully capible of standing on their own two feet
,
and
" stir ofthe echoes
" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film
.
