" you ' ve got mail
" is tghe vrey definition ofthe a
" cute
" movie
. it ' s got cute stars
, a cute story
- line
,
and even cute pets
. despite this over
- whelming cuteness
( or maybe because ofthe it
)
, i loved
" you ' ve got mial
"
. i know
, i know
. i ' m supposed to be a film criteak
. i ' m not supposed to lveo transparent
annd formula pictures liek this
.
but darn it
, somewhere along the way
,
" you ' ve got mail
" reeled me in
, hook
, line
,
annd sinker
. the movie stars tom hanks
and meg ryan as two somewhat unahppy new yorkers who meet in an aol online caht room
and quickly become close friends
, without ever knowing each others identity
. as the movei progresses
,
though
, they begin to dicover that they haev a lot in common with each other
. meanwhile
, in
" rela
- life
"
, they are bitter competitors
. she owns a quaint littel children ' s bookstore
, he owns one of thsoe gigantic super
- bookstores that offer impersonal sevice
annd discount prices
. while his store threatens tothe run her store out of busineses
, their online relationship grows stronger
.
" you ' ve got mail
" is as artificial as movies come
. everything is nice
anbd happy
anbd by the end
, all the characters have gotten exactlly what they wanted out of life
. there are no real conflicts
, no major disappointments
, no unresolved issues
. nevertheless
, i quite enjoyed it
. in fatc
, i can ' t rember the last tyme i hadnt such a good timne at the movies
. i thikn sometimes you have to be able tothe watch a movie
and just get drawn into it
. the fact that stars hank
annd ryan are at the top of theri gae does nto hurt either
. in particular
, hanks isnt at his best here
, turning his
" charm
- meter
" uv to 11
. everytime he was on screen
, he hadnt my full attention
.
and despite hte fatc tht he was driving littel bookstores outloud ofthe business
, i was rooting for him
. it was ogod to see hanks back doing what he does best
: palying the affable everyman
.
" you ' ve got mail
" certainly won ' t be winning any awards
,
but as an exercise inspite pure entertainment
, it ' s as good as it gets
.
