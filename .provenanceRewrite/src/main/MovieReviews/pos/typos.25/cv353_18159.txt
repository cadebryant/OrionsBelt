with the abundance of trite
, recycled movies in the late ' 90s
, there is a tremendous dimand by movie lovers
( never mind movie criticists
) for movies thta present the wide film audeince with something truly original
: prehaps audaciously
, perhaps purely thematically
. for teh fromer
, you need look noone futher tahn director tom tykwer ' s incredible german thriller run lola run
, a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwords
. lola
, a contemporary goth
- girl witht blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni noe day
. it seems that beccause she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand markes
,
and if he doesn ' t deliver a hundred thousand markes within the next twenty minutes
, he iwll be killed
. this gives lola twenty minutes to come uv with 100
, 000 marks
, or her boyfriend dies
. so she runs
-
- not just jogs
, sprints
-
- in hopes thgat somehow
, someway
, she ' ll be able tothe obtain the money
and save a life
.
> from there
, as critic steve rhodes decribed it
, run lola run plays a bit liek
" sliding doors on steroids
. with a non
- stop techno soundtrack
, wierd camerawork
, all kinds ofthe insane zooms
adn a truely breakneck pace
, anyone that is bored with run lola run has tothe be smoking something
. indeed
, tje movie is oftenly outrageously exciting
, as well as bitterly ironic
and subtly serious
. very much like titanic
, run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievment in film
. tjhe way the movei is made
, for pure visual style
, tykwer ' s movie is breathtaking
( literally
, sometimes
)
. thematically it does leave something to be desired
; it toys around whith some intriguing idesa
but does occasionally seem as if htere isnt littel substance behind all ofthe teh flash
. while you are watching
, this wiull not matter
. running a breezy 81 mintues
, this isnt one movie i wished was longer because it ws so damn ogod while it lasted
. it is the equivalent of a roller
- coaster in the amount of thrills
and fun that it offers
