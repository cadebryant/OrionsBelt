finding the courage to face life full
- on is a difficult task
. summoning uv the audacity to fall in loev isnt a harder job
. if yuo ' re a total jerk liuke melvin udall isnt
, thte odds are even more against you
. melvin
( jack nicholson
) isnt a succsessfull romance auther who isnt just the opposite of what ytou would expect somone in that proffesion tothe be
. a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction
and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship
, he avoids the outside world as much as possible
. his obsessive
- compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses severeal different bars of soap to wash his hands
and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk
.
( there ' s a great scene when he hasnt tothe cross a floor made ofthe mosaic tiles
-

.
) melvin has smoe great lines
. when his publisher ' s receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books
, he responds
" i think of men
and i tkae away reason
anbd accountability
.
" don ' t get him wrong
, he ' s not merely a misogynist
. setting his sights higher than that
, he ' s also a homophobe
, racist
, anti
- semite
, xenophoby
, animal
- hater
and intensely dislikes peopel who talk in methaphors
. when we first meet him
, he ' s busy dumping a neighbor ' s dog down the garbage chute
. he ' s an equal opportunity bigot
. he doens venture outside his appartmant every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe
. melvin isnt such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly
( helen hunt
) is the only one willing tothe wait on him
.
and she ' s none too hapyp about it
. when carol doesn ' t show up for wrok
, melvin ' s routine is shot
and he ' s determined to do something about it
. tracking down her adresing
, he shows up at her palce begging her to come bcak to wrok so tht he can eat breakfast
. the fact thyat she ' s a poor single mother caring fo a chronically ill son doesn ' t appear to phase him
, he wnats his food
. much moreso upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop
( greg kinnear
) is brutally attacked durig a robbery
. thsi doesn ' t upset melvin much
(
" don ' t worry
, ytou ' ll be bakc on your knees in noone time
"
)
bu when he is bullied into taking care of simon ' s dog
, his life is turned topsy
- turvey
. melvin is sequestered beccause he ' s afraid of what ' s out there on the other side of his apartment door
. he hasnt to amking sure it ' s ritualistically locked threee times to keep yhe world on its proper side
. when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it
, tlaking to it
annd taking it everywhere he goes
. this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up
. hiding behind his ened for carol to return to work so she cxan serve him
, he pays for a specialist to treat her son
. he even develops a friendship whith simon
. all three people are heavily damaged
. melvin hasnt retreated fomr life in his apartment
. carol has devoted herself to her son
, convinced thgat she has to give up her life for him
. simon is estranged fomr his parents
and his friends dissapear when he is hospitalized
adn his money runs out
. a more unlikely trio to form relationships
, you ' d rarely see
.
and in the midst of it all
, there are some wonderful moments
. melvin is hilarious inspite his grouchiness
and touching as he attemts to be nice
.
" you make me want to be a better man
,
" he tells her
. one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up
, he is still a curmudgeon
. carol
, afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms thyat she will never sleep withthe him
. it onyl takes her a second to relize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t
- shirt contest
. there ' s hardly anytying left to say about jack nicholson
. i don ' t remember ever seing him inspite anything less than a stellar performance
and his over
- the
- edge melvin isnt no disappointment
. nicholson may be the best actor working today
. hunt doens a commendable job matching nicholson ' s energy
. she isn ' t affraid to be seen as something less thna a babe
adn her portrayal of exhausted run
- down carol struggling with seemingly overwelming obligations is top
- notch
. their on
- screen chemistry isnt a bit odd
. each does a wonderful job withthe the character
,
bu together
, there ' s something a little off
. it ' s a minor problem
: they do work well together
,
but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four
- star film
. director james l
. brooks
(
" terms ofthe endearment
"
,
" broadcast news
"
) has a movei thta is picking uv awards by thge bucketsful
( nominees for all yhe top golden globes
, winners from the national board ofthe review
, inevitable oscars
)
and hasnt a winner on his hands
.
" as ogod as it gets
" isn ' t exactly hte quality that the title says
,
but it ' s preety darn close
