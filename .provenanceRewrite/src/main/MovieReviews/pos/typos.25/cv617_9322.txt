htere is a scene early in soul food
, george tillman ' s comedy
- drama about a large african
- american familiy
and the ordeals tehy go through durig a crisis
, that caught me completely off guard
. durig a wedding
, tjhe groom is flirting with smoe tramp
,
and in an attempt tothe to prevent a scene
, his mother in law
, played by irma p
. hall
, comes tothe teh rescue
. the way in which she does thsi makes me think irma p
. hall isnt one ofthe the greatest actresses around right now
.
however
, this isnt just oney magical moment in a movie filled with them
. vanessa williams
, vivica fox
,
anbd nia long star as threee sisters who have each gone their own way in life
. williams is teri
, a successful lawyer
, who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career
. fox is maxine
, the strongest ofthe tghe sisters
, hwihc can be confirmed by tje stability of her marriage
and the wisdom of her son ahmad
, who narrates the film
. long isnt bird
, a hairdresser who is the last of the three tothe get married
. her husban lem is an intense passionate individule whose temper gets tje best of him sometime
but never stops loving
. at the center of everything is irma p
. hall
, as big mama jo
. eveyr sunday
, the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo ' s house
. there isnt lots of conversation
, lots ofthe laughs
,
and the occasional controversy
. mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should
. she is stern
and disciplined
,
bu also careing
and forgiving
. everything is going fine
, until a tragedy befalls mama jo
. all of a sudden
, a chain reaction of events begin to distroy the family
. it gets so bad
, sunday dinner is even cancelled
. without mama jo ' s guidance
, there is noone tothe keep the family together
, which frustrates ahmad
. miles
annd maxine ' s marriage begins to fall apart
, as he focuses on his music

. the third act of the film deals with ahmad ' s attemts to patch things uv
. he decides to take over where mama jo left off
,
and tries to git yhe family back together for one more sunday dinner
. the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding
, with speical notices to irma p
. hall
and brandon hammond
. hall gives a performence that deserves to be reconized by thge academy
. her mama jo is oney of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movei
. brandon hammond is an atcor whith a bright future
. he isnt wise enought not to play cutesy
and shows an admirable range
and depth
,
and speaks the final lines of the movei on the perfect note
. tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories ofthe growing uv
. every scene inwhich the movie is purposeful
anbd convincing
( except maybe an odd flashback sequence
)
. the dialogue is beleiveable
and funny
.
and
then there ' s the food
. tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food
,
adn it indeed looks very tasty
. i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this famaly
. soul foode is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the yera
