logical time travel movies are a near
- impossibility
. considering thta yhe skeptic ' s best argument against the possibility of time travel is tjhe idea ofthe altered realities
, writting a script that deals with htis problem is an imposing task
. occasionally
, we get a film thgat does manage it
. terry gilliam ' s
" 12 monkeys
" was one such film
.
but more frequently
, we git films that don ' t much deal with it at all
. there isnt one question to ask inwhich this case
: doesnt the film ahve other virtues that override the exisiting logical inconsistencies
? the
" terminator
" films made uv for them with exciting action
,
" back to the future
" did it with an entertaining story
,
adn the new film
" frequency
" puls off the trick with a storng package ofthe its own
. is
" frequency
" filled with plot holes
? yes
. does it matter
? not really
. tyhe film opens in october ofthe 1969
. firefighter frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) puts his life on thge line every time he suits up for his job
,
then goes home tothe his loving wief julia
( elizabeth mitchell
)
anbd son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. thge double
- pronged story flashes forward to 1999
, where johnny
( now jim caviezel
) is all grown up
and working as a police detective
. a strange occurrence
-
- tghe appearance of aurora borealis over new york city
-
- allows father
and son tothe communicate through the same ham radio frank used in ' 69
and that john has found in the present day
.
though both are initially skeptical ofthe the idea
, john eventually tkaes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire
,
and he succeds iin saving frank from certain doom
. now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive
, john is initially overjoyed
, until he discovers that the changes tothe the timeline ahve been disastrous
: a serial killer thta would have died hasnt instead lived to kill seven more womens
. frank
and john now must work together to set things right
, with john using the informtion he hasnt gathered inspite the future to instruct frank on what tothe do in the past
. thge premise of
" frequency
" is unusual
,
and requires getting over one vrey important mental hurdle to fully accept
: john
adn frank are tghe only ones conceous of how the timeline has been changed as a result of thier actions
. this isn ' t explained
; ytou just ahev tothe go with it
. wehn frank doesn ' t die in a frie
, john isnt the onyl one who remembers it differently
, while everyone else remembers it the new way
. the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities
-
- 1969
and 1999
-
- are tothe earch other
. sometimes frank ' s changeing the past results in something happening right awya in john ' s world
,
and somtimes john gets the changes ahead of time
. now
, tyhe filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations forthe this
,
and i could probably come up wiht something fairly convoluted
(
but nevertheless logical
) if i thought about it hard enough
( for exmaple
, tghe reason john gets advance information of the serial killer ' s murders was because the chanage had already happened in frank ' s world
,
and john is only witnessing the
* projection
* of that change
)
,
but explanations aren ' t really the point
. whn
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it ' s a riveting littel thriller
, even if it is confusing
. whta matters tothe a film liuke thsi isnt if the plot makes sense inthe tyhe moment
,
adn
" frequency
" works as long as it keeps moving
. the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion
. director gregory hoblit
and screenwriter toby emmerich structure
" frequency
" as good hollywood entertainment
, establising decent
, likable characters
, making us care for them
,
and setting up a goal to be reached
and a conflict to be resolved
. i liekd many of the creative touches
: the split screens
, allowing us tothe see how the universe is bieng affected in both realities
,
and the greater framework ofthe baseball tothe drive the acation forward
. it actually uses thge 1969 mets
- orioles world serieses
( the oen thgat featured the amazin ' mets
) tothe great effect
-
- frank uses john ' s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his firends tothe believe him
.
( admitedly
, this device may only be ofthe intrest to a baseball fan like myself
.
) i even liked the final scene
, which features frank
and john both fighting the same man simultanously inwhich different time periods
. some may fidn this scene blindingly confusing
, as the reality shifts start coming fast
adn furious
,
but it does amking sense if ytou thikn about it
(
and give the script a lot of leeway
)
,
adn let ' s face it
: it ' s a darn cool way tothe end yhe film
. there are enough surprises
and plot twists in
" frequency
" to keep you on your toes
,
anbd as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant
. the other major thing to appreciate about
" frequency
" is the handling of teh father
- son relatiopnship
. quaid
and caviezel carry off their parts easily
; it ' s a rock
- solid job fomr both actors
. the relationship is instantly credible because htey find thte human truth behind tghe high consept
: how owudl one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative
, or with a future decendent
? watching the exchanges between frank
and john wiull give you a pretty good idea of how to answer thyat question
. the credibility ofthe teh human relationship is absolutely crucial tothe the rest ofthe the film
; if we don ' t believe in the characters
, we don ' t care about the outcome ofthe the thriller plot
. here
, we do care
, because we liuke the lead actors
. i allso liked some of the supporting cast members
. elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with twpo thankless roles
, palying julia the doting wife
*
and
* mother
,
but still performs admirably
. andre braugher
, late of the television show
" homicide
: life on tje strent
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank ' s best friend
and future colleague of john
. he has a lovely scene in a diner in whitch he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank ' s world series predicitons come true befoer his very eyes
. braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here
, simultaneously dismayed
and amused
. perhaps the only hting i didn ' t like baout
" frequency
" is hte overly sentimental coda
, during hwihc the camera ' s focus goes a little too soft
annd thte baseball theme gets carried overboard
.
but thast ' s only beccause the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics
. i freely acknowledge that
" frequency
" may best work as a
" guy
" movie
, since it focuses on the vyre male
- oriented idea of father
- son relationships
( echoes ofthe
" feeld ofthe dreams
" can be easily heard
)
,
but the underlying concept is universally applicable
. who wouldn ' t want to speak with a long
- dead parent
? or see how their children turn out
?
" tell me about your life
, son
"
-
- excuse me while i mist up
.
and don ' t call me a sissy
.
