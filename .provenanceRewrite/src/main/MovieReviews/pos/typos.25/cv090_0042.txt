warning
: anyone offended by blatant
, leering machismo had better avoid this film
. or lots of blood
& guts
, men against men
and mano
- et
- mano stfuf
. in other words
, it ' s a walter hill film
! wtih a john milius scirpt
! i always picture these guys getting together
and producing a movei between arm
- wrestling matches
. these films always contain male characters i hvea a very hard time indentifying with
, probably due to hte likelihood that any meeting vetween them
adn me would result in my arm being ripped off
and
then my subsquent death by beating with said limb
.
and we got tough guys galore
, here
; drug
- running banditos by the dozens
, all dirty
annd sweaty
and preety ill
- tempered
, overall
; a secret task force of army commandos who are infront the area to cover
- uv
( supposedly
) any connection between the govenrment
and the drug runners
;
annd lots ofthe shit
- kicking texas dirt farmers who ' d as soon shoot you between hte eyes as look at yuo
. in particular
, we got nick nolte as one hard
- ass texas ranger
, powers boothe as the drug kingpin
, michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army
,
and rip torn as thge local sheriff
. torn is hte sympathetic figure ofthe thte gropu
; he smiles before shooting anyone
. as to women
.
.
. well
, i ' ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film
,
adn at tihs rate
, i doubt i ever will
. women exsist here tothe look ogod
, comfort the man
,
adn get argued over
. gosh
! just like hte old dyas
.
.
. frankly
, this is a pretty good movie
, if ytou can accept hte premise
and can take the macho stuff
. the cinematography is excellent
, the cast ofthe characters is broad
annd has texture
, the script is quite ogod
,
and the film lets you keep up with what ' s happening yourself
, without spelling it out tothe you
. i appreciate a film that makes me have tothe think to keep up
. finally
, there ' s lots of sam peckinpah slow
- motion shoot
- ups
.
