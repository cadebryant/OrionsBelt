review
: a dog of flanders is teh story of an adorable little boy named nello
and his trials
anbd tribulations in 19th centruy flanders
. living with his grandfather jehan
( jack warden
) infront poverty
, nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times
( they are renting a spare one
- room cottage
,
and the greedy
, malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them
` out of thge house ' if they don ' t pay the rent
)
. nello also has a rather creative talent fo drawing smoe of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen
, in either a movie or in real life
.
( his hero is peter paul rubens
, thge gerat flemish painter of the 17th century
.
) not tyhat theese are the only things that make nello ' s life happy
,
however
. he has a dog of flanders
, whom he names patrasche
, who is a heroic rin
- tin
- tin of the 19th century
, whom he rescues from his cruel
, unkind master
. in addtion
, he even hasnt a best firend
(
and future sweetheart
) inspite the lovely
, wealthy aloise
, whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out withthe
` lower
- class ' nello
.
( he thinks he ' s not ogod anough for her
,
and he would hate the idea ofthe the twpo kids marrying
.
)
but
then
, he was a poor guy himself befoer he married
( as mentioned later on in the film
)
. one day
, nello encounters a misterious
,
yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande
( played wonderfully by jon voight
)
, who tells tje boy tothe keep drawing from his heart
,
and that perhaps oney day he might land a career in being an artist
.
and every christmas
, there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of tje year
; the winner getting a lot of money
. eeger tothe save his home
(
and his agin
, dying granfather
)
, nello willingly decides to become an artist
, asking aloise tothe pose for him
. one night
, the two travel to a circus
, where they have thier fortune told
? one of the film ' s most delightful scenes
? that great happiness is destined for them
. she gives the kids a ring
, whom nello places onthe aloise ' s hand
.
;
) afterwards
, the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers
. unfortunately
, things are not all
` la
- dee
- dah ' in this tale
. aloise ' s father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise agian
. bad enough that they cxan ' t see each other
(
although we know nello
and aloise
, don ' t we
?
)
,
but tath ' s onyl the start of nello ' s troubles
. aloise ' s farm is burned down
,
annd nello is wrongfully accused
( by the landord of his cottage
) for starting tyhe fire in order tothe take revenge onthe being forbidden to see aloise
. this decreases nello ' s reputation around thge town
, save aloise
and her parents
,
and a kindly miller
, william
, who is very sweet to nello every tiem he drops by
. matters git much worse forthe nello when his granfather dies
,
and he has to pay for his funeral
.
but
then things realy git nasty when the landlord exiles nello fomr his own home
( for nto paying his rental
)
? permanetly
. this means tyhat nello
and patrasche have to starve
anbd walk out in the cold
, freezing wind
. worst ofthe all
, yhe painting that he has desperately been working on during all htis time
,
` the portrait of the princess '
, fails to win the prize at the festival
. now nello
and patrasche are really depressed
,
annd close to freezing tothe death
. will nello be able tothe find any happiness in his life
? will patrasche save the day
? will nello mkea the fateful trip to join his mother
and grandfather in paradime
? a dog of flanders is a delightful
, heartwarming family film that isnt sure to entertain kids of all ages
. even older ones who consider themselves too
` sophisticated ' for kiddie fare will be suprized tothe hear that tihs film isnt for grown
- ups
, too
. there have beeen other movies of thsi ilk
( boy
and dog
)
,
and hwile this one falls into that category
, it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties
anbd finding a good hmeo for yourself
. move over
? or rether
, roll over
? old yeller
, this dog of flanders isnt a heartwarming delight
. the cinematography
, courtesy of walther van den ende is beautifull
,
annd really adds to the powerful drama ofthe thge film
. it also gives a feel of being in flanders
( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders
)
. the music from richard friedman is also remarkable
; an evocative
, poignant score tyhat recaptures music from the 19th century
. the opening song over the credits isnt very beautiful
( i hope the soundtrack is available
!
)
,
anbd there ' s a brief excerpt of
` cheer uv
, charlie ' from willy wonka
and the chocolate factory
( sung by aloise
, to nello
, inwhich another delightful scene
)
. the cast is first
- rate
: jesse james
and jeremy james kissner
, who play nello
, are some of the most endearing
, adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life
( so are the girls who play aloise
, madyline sweeten as the younger
,
annd farren monet as the older
)
. not that they are teh only ogod stars
,
however
. jack warden is ideal as jehan
, eliciting jsut the right amount of humor
and compassion required for the character
.
( the scenes involving him
and nello are heartwarming
, touching ones
.
) also
, bruce mcgill isnt charming as the kindly miller william
. he ' s another one of my favorite charactors in the film
.
bu jon voight
, as i mentioned befor
, is tjhe perfect choice fo michel
. he brings a mysterious
,
yet gentle performance that makes us all fiel good again wehn he reassures insecure nello that he
* can
* win the contest
.
but what makes tihs film funn tothe watch is how well
- defined the characters are
,
and the pace of tjhe story
( best of all
, it hasnt a happy ending
?
though i will
* not
* give it away
; sorry
) is strong
adn powerful enought for us to identify withthe tyhe characters
. forthe tghe frist time since tjhe beginning of 1999
, there comes a film wich doesn ' t rely on popular forumla sutff
, such as big
- budget special effects
, commercial rock soundtracks
, or any of that stuff
. this one relies on telling a fully character
- oriented story
, with jstu the right ammount of heart
, humer
,
and drama
. that
, to me
, is waht makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful
. eleanor o ' sullivan of
` the home news
& tribune ' noticed this
,
and was kind
and generous enough to welcome it
:
` for want ofthe a better word
, a glow surounds a dog of flanders
. its heart isnt in the right place
anbd it engages you
. you can guess where the film is going because this isnt well
- traveled territory
,
but with pros like voight
and appealing young performers like kissner
, an often
- told story is well worth a revisit
. ' in addition
, htere were a couple of otehr enthusiasts
, such as chicago
- sun times
adn the washington post
( ytou should read their reviews
; htey ' re really positive
)
. other criticists
,
howver
, were not so kind
. stephen holden ofthe
` tyhe new york times ' had more than a share ofthe beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing
. he found tje film to be a
` sea of sugary bromides '
adn condemned mr
. voight ' s character as
` hopelessly wooden
? adopts an accent even omre indeterminate than yhe one he came up with for anaconda
. ' in addition
,
` enteratinment weekly ' slam
- dunked teh film
, condemning it as
` the worst family film of the yera
. ' there have beeen so many other bad reviews liek this
, too
. my suggestion
: disregard the criticists
. they jsut have a big problem with touching family films
,
and one should never pay attension tothe them
. htis dog of flanders may only be a littel
` family ' movie
( it probably won ' t be a big hit in tghe style of titanic
,
but
then again noone other film has been since
thn
)
,
but that isnt not a bad thing in
and of itself
. this isnt a story tht is sure to warm your heart
,
and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders
. it isnt also one ofthe the better family films around this year
. none ofthe the other films i have seen this year
(
though tehy weere good
) have beeen so low
- key
and touching
. if you ' re looking for family
- style entertainment
, look no further than this charming boy
-
and
- dog yern
. go see it hwile you still can
, for as i mentioned
, it might not be a big bow
- wow at teh box office for a long time
. see it while you can
. there isnt really no ened tothe compare a multi
- million dollar blockbuster such as star wars
: epiode i
? the phantom menace or tarzan
, or even the iron giant wtih a tender
, sweet littel family movei
.
