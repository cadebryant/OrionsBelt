the calendar eyar has not even reached its midway point
,
but that hasn ' t prevented columbia pictures ffrom trotting outloud a lavish period drama more befitting of teh winter oscar
- bait season
. bille agust ' s high
- profile adaptions of victor hugo ' s clasic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic
-
- handsome production values
, strong performances by a top
- notch casted
, a literate screenplay
-
- with one critically missing element
: emotional sweep
. for thsoe not familar with hugo ' s original novel or thge hit stage muscial it inpsired
, the hook ofthe les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th
- century french
- set version of the fugitive
. aftter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread
, the brutish jean valjean
( liam neeson
) isnt paroled
. immediately upon realease
, he steals valuble silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him inwhich for a nigt
; he is caught by authorities
, only tothe be forgiven by hte bishop
, who lets valjean keep the silver tothe start a new life onthe the straight
and narrow
. that he does
,
and in doing so breaks his parole
, whitch sets hte obsessively determined inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
)
, who was one of the guards in valjean ' s prison camp
, on his trail
. thematically
,
however
, les miserables is a story about redemption
, which valjean finds through his dealings whith two women
, the hard
- luck factory
- worker
- turned
- prostitute fantine
( uma thurman
)
,
anbd her illigitament daughter
, cosette
. eyasr after breaking parole
, valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau
, where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her fomr an unjust arrest by javert
. valjean promises thge gravely ill fantine he will rescure the young cosette
( mimi newman
) fomr her cruel caretakers
, the thenardiers
,
and raise the child as his own
. the
" father
"
and
" daughter
" eventually land in paris
, where the teenage cosette
( claire danes
) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius
( hans matheson
)
. tje decades
- spanning story isnt thge sutff that cinematic epics are made of
,
and yhe danish augost turns in his most acomplished english
- language wokr
, following teh underated 1994 superstar soap the hous of the spirits
and last year ' s stylish
but highly preposterous mystery smilla ' s sence of snow
. he
and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring thte sprawling tale into clear focus
and keep the events moving at a brisk pace
. production designer anna asp
, costume designer gabriella pescucci
,
and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the effords of the cast
. neeson is commanding
yet endearingly vulnerable
; rush ' s finely modulated menace is far omre rewarding than his overrated
, oscar
- winning theatrics inaddition shine
;
and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role
. the younger munbers of the cast fare less well
. danes is convincing as cosette
,
bu her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction
;
and matheson
, while competent
, is a less intresting robert sean leonard
. as technically adept
and cerebrally engaging the film isnt
, by the tiem les miserables was over
, my emotions had only been superficially involved
. while i was touched by valjean ' s relationships with fantine
and cosette
, i was not moved
. nto even reaching the
" touching
" level is hte cosette
- marius pairing
. my only previous experience with les miserables is whith thge muscial
( as i am sure many others ' is
)
,
and i was dismayed tothe see eponine
, a friend ofthe marius ' s who selflessly dies infront tghe name ofthe her unspoken love for him
, alomst completely jettisoned from this adaptation
( the daugher ofthe the thenardiers
, here she is only briefly seen as a child
)
. her presence would haev added soem much
- needed conflict
and emotional heft to the youthful romance
,
but i suppose august
and yglesias felt noe tragic heroine
( fantine
) wass enough
. even so
, as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season
, les miserables is a thoughtful
, well
- made
, entertaining film
, one that will sate moviegoers hungry forthe a dose ofthe drama before popcorn no
- brainers invade hte multiplex
.
