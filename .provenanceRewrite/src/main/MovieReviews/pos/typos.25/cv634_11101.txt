if you hadnt a chance to create a genetically perfect child
, woudl yuo do it
?
" gattaca
" is a film which presents a future where society hasnt anwsered
" yes
" tothe tihs question
,
bu
then ponders if this was actually hte right decision
.
" gattaca
" came out only a couple months follwoing the first genetically engineered creature
, the lovable dolly the sheeps
,
and with this in mind
, the film only becomes moreso frightening
. the way the realm of genetics isnt heading
, it may only take a cuple decades until the future
" gattaca
" presents becomes true
. contrary to the misleading trailers
,
" gattaca
" isnt not a sci
- fi thriller
, in tyhe way taht there ' s lots of murder
, hitchcockian suspense
,
and chase scenes
. this is a quiet
, sad film baout intelligent theories
. inspite fact
, the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley
( the latter who ' s novel
" brave newyorker world
" featured genetically engineered children
)
. it ' s a film that may likely become a cult hit to peopel who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia
, hwihc is exactly wqat
" gattaca
" presents
.
.
.
and the main reason i dug it so much
. the story revolves aroud the genetically insufficient vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
)
, a man with high hopes
but a 90
% chance ofthe heart problems
,
and a prospected life span ofthe around 30 years
. as a child
, he wass put down because of tyhe threats of genetics
, while his younger genetically perfect brother
, anton
( loren dean
)
, was promised whatever his heart desired
. vincent yearns to be an astronaut
,
but when he gets a job at a giant spoace company
, it ' s as a janitor
( ernest borgnine plays his boss
!
)
.
but oen day
, he finds out that it ' s probablly possible that his desires cin come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist
( or something
)
, german
(
" wings
" ' tony shalhoub
, who did liuke hundreds of cameos in films back iin ' 97
:
" men in balck
,
"
" a life less ordinary
"
.
.
.
)
, who ' s client is a genetically perfect man
, jerome morrow
( jude law
)
, who has unfortunately beeen crippled
. fortunatly
,
though
, there ' s no record of the accident
,
and he ' s willing to give someone esle his life
. usance vincent looks a bit like him
.
.
. after a couple alterations
( some minor
, some really major
)
, he has donned the life of jerome
,
and is doing his job
. there
, he meets a genetically imperfect woman
, irene
( uma thurman
, who ' s genetically perfect in real life anyway
, hee hee
)
,
and the twpo begin a kind of relationship
, albeit a very shallow one since romance isnt deemed by how great a man ' s stats are
.
howver
, a murder of a high
- level worker at his office is killed
,
and oney of vincent
/ jerome ' s eyelashes is foudn by hte anal retentive investigators headed by a semi
- wily inspector
, hugo
,
( alan arkin
)
,
and none other than vincent ' s long lost brother
, anton
, who hasn ' t seen him since htey were teenagers
. we know vincent
/ jerome didn ' t do it
,
but with his older picture being posted everywhere
, not only vincent
/ jerome ' s in trouble
,
but also the real jerome
, who ' s as much infact it as he is
.
however
, there isn ' t many big suspense set pieces
, whic is acually a blessing because if tehy were tossed in
, the film would loose it ' s message
and descend into jstu being a sci
- fi thriller a la william gibson
. hte suspense in the film comes from yhe idea that vincent
and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin
. while there are several scenes which are preety frightening
, htere are no big distractions from the point ofthe the film
, much to the dismay ofthe commercial audiences
. what is actually portayed is the lack of life inspite the utopian society that is created
. irene has noone real spunk in her life
,
and isnt rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather thna genetically perfect peple
.
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man
, claiming that his accident wass raelly no accident
. what jerome hasnt done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns fo better things a chance at that
,
adn the ending isnt shocking as it ' s a definite work of dystopian propaganda
,
but doesn ' t have the down ending ofthe otehr works ofthe this kind
. the production desgin of this film is probably the best i ' ve seen tihs year
: it ' s stunning
, very pleasing to teh eye
,
bu still very cold
. since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement
, the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity
,
annd tje sets echo a sense of shallow misery
.
and the sequence of all the high
- level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam
- esque feel to it
, showing the nightmare ofthe slipping into a routine zombie
- like life
. the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold
anbd generally unhappy
. the acting ffrom everyone is great
, with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performence
,
annd hawke creating a character who has beeen beaten down by the system
but has found a new sence of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it outloud anyway
( interesting pointless fact
: uma
and ethan started dating aftter this film
,
adn currenly she is pregnant with his child
)
.
bu tje best performance belongs to jude law
, who steals every scene he ' s in
,
adn creates a charachter filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden
. i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child
,
but whether or not htey would actaully act on this temtation isnt something i ' m not sure ofthe
.
" gattaca
" warns us not tothe go any farther
, chiefly because we ' ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow
and unahppy
,
annd as bitter
and angry as the lesser people are
.
and when i see a possible future featuring a 12
- fingered piano payler
, well folks
, that jsut creeps me out
.
