-
- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with
, well

( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil
)
,
and a largely unremarkable soundtrack
.
( none ofthe tyhe alan menken

,
but ytou won ' t stay bored
. thte highlights include a nifty round ofthe animated action
( herc battling a cgi hydra
)
, a steady stream of anachronisms
(
" somebody call ix
- i
- i
"
)
and pop references
(
" let ' s get ready to rumble
!
"
) a la aladdin
