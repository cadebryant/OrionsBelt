i cxan sum uv firt strike in oney owrd
: awesome
. never inwhich my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan
. for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movei he ' s ever appeared in
, he should be awared greatly
. the smae tom
and jerry formula that was used to amking chan ' s rumble in the bronx
and supercop so entertaining cin be found here as well
.
howver
, firt strike was probably the most exciting outloud of thge three
, for the simple reason thyat practice mkaes perfect
. his last two movies were allmost like practice
anbd this one was gerat
. like rumble
, this film is about yhe masia
, the fromer kgb
. now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures ofthe the ukraine against a gropu of very large bad men
. the trailer for the film sums it up quite well
. first strike is acation
- packed
,
bu thge fight scenes are so fast
and furious
, tehy almost have a witty
, italian
- like humor to them
. jackie chan is a regular comedian
. well
, he ' s no eddie murphy
,
but he can really crack yuo up
. for example
, he is hanging off a roof
and he humorously taunts his foes to cmo
anbd get him
, as he claimes to be the korean 007
( that ' s secret agent james bond
)
. even yhe plot to this film improved above the others
, as a sort
- of twisted nuclear
- weapon smuggling deal is botched
and jackie takes teh blame
.
but never fear
, as the chinese masia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident
. with some of the most high
- flying stunts
and side
- splitting comedy
, first strike is a sure
- fire hit that ' s garanteed tothe draw smoe major
, world
- wide attention
.
