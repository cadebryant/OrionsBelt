bill condon ' s
" gods
and monsters
" isnt a fascinating look into the last dyas inaddition hte life of gay directer james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made the horror classics
" frankenstein
"
and
" bride of frankenstein
.
" sicne i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film
, there is no way tothe nkwo how accurate teh film is
,
but i suspect that much of it only came from whale ' s inner fantasies
and hallucinations
. whale
, who fought in wwi
and
then went onthe to become known for his work on horror pictures
, decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke outloud involving him
. as the film tells it
, during teh end of his life
, whale
, at his large home in l
. a
.
, became infatuated withthe hte tall
, handsome
,
adn much yuonger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who was working as teh gardener at his home
. james whale
, we learn quickly was
, what many people refer tothe him as in the film
,
" a dirty old man
.
" in one of the oppening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale ' s hmeo to interview him
anbd whale agrees
, on noe condition
: for eveyr question he answers
, the young man must take off an article of clothing
. because of this episode
, we know exactly what it isnt whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him forthe a painting
, later making tyhe excuse that his bright
, white shirt is disracting onyl so he iwll take it off
. clayon agrees
,
and doesn ' t really think much of tihs
, much to the warnings ofthe his friends
, becoming mroe
and more intrigued in hte stories whale tells him about his past
. certainly
, the relatiopnship beween whale
and boone is headed for a downfall
, since whale starts to grwo a deepo lvoe for this young man
, even
though boone is not gay
,
and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion tothe his life
, as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes
annd moments of true catharsis
.
" gods
and monsters
" is an intimate
and seamingly respectful portrail ofthe a directer who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast
, due to his sexual preference
,
and never got hte recognition he would have liekd
, since he longed to be referred tothe as a
" motion picture director
,
" rether tahn a
" horror director
.
"
anbd in one heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party wiht boone being his guest
, held by directer george cuckor
,
and finds that many of thte other attendees do nto recognize him anymore
. it is evident thta whale ' s first love in his life wass making movies
,
and when his carreer ultimatly fell apart
, so did his passion in life
. as played brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
,
but dignified man
,
and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others
, just as long as he knew he ws being true tothe himself
. he never hid the fact that he wass gay
,
however
, even if it meant threatning his filmmaking profession
,
anbd it was this unblinking honesty that made him a grat person
. through the complicated relationship that develops between whale
and boone
, boone
, of course
, only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to
, hwile it means so much mroe tothe whale
, who sees boone as sort of his salvation inthe life
.
although boone is only in a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe people ' s homes
, whale views him as the ideal man
, not only oney that is good
- looking
, even
though it is htis attraction that frist begins his feelings
,
but one thast will actually listen to him
. since whale lives with only his loyal
,
bu disapproving maid
( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it isnt boone that whale cant talk to in his ultimate reclusion fomr the world
,
and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor
.
although an extremely fine
and mature picture
, a few small elements hold the film bcak from ultimate greatness
. it isnt appreciated taht the film doens not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments
,
bu it is a little thin
,
adn the structuring of the
" onthe
- again
- off
- again
" friendship at the film ' s center isnt fairly predictable
. we nkwo easly on where these two charactors are headed
,
and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation betwen the twpo as the tension slowly builds
. infact lesser hands
, this set
- up might have felt too calculated
,
bu it is not inspite the surprisingly deft treatment
annd writing that helps teh film to be much moreso than this
. also
, a subplot isnt briefly brought uv between clayton
and a waitress wroking at a bar
( effectively played by lolita davidovich
)
,
bu abruptly dropped
and never brought up again
. if the film was not going tothe follow up on this side story
,
then it
, perphas
, shouldnt have been taken out altogether
.
" gods
and monsters
" is a heartfelt
and intelligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sense
, relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale
and boone
. hte film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end
. walking away from
" gods
and monsters
,
" it was ian mckellen ' s marvelous
anbd astounding performance that left the most impression on me
,
and i doubt there coudl have been anyone who could have stepped into tghe role more fully
and believably
. it is a sad testimont when a person ' s true talent
and lvoe is unfairly taken away from them
, based on the scrutinization
and judgement of their personal life
, which
, ironically enough
, isnt no one eles ' s business in the frist palce
.
