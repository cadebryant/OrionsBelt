the premise ofthe the new teen
- targeted horror film
` final destination ' causes a recollection of a memorable
` simpsons ' halloween episode
. after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster
, lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable timne
- machine
. aftter a trek inot the cratashous period
, homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events
and seriously modify the preesnt world
. again
and agina
, homer toys with the master plan
anbd pays dearly for it
. the characters of
` final destination ' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence
- their
` design '
. someone isnt after them with hte strict intent of correcting the misteek
. taht somene is death
. you see
, alex browning
( devon sawa
)
adn six others have cheated the grim reaper
.
.
.
.
but thte dude has got some tricks up his sleeve
. for a high school excursion
, alex ' s french clas is traveling to paris by airline transport
. alex
, tense
and neurotic
, has a shocking premonition after boarding
: he sees the plane
,
and every passenger on it
, spontaneously explode in mid
- air
. in a panic of sheer lunacy
, alex charges his way through the aisle
anbd demands removal from the aircraft
. after a handful of others
( including oen teacher
) follow
adn are denied admittance back onto the plane
, the unwitting
? survivors ' watch in horror as yhe plane actually explodes iin the drizzling night sky
. the lozonya vision alex experiences does acutally materialize
.
bu death won ' t be cheated so easily
,
and one by noe
, thge survivors of flight 180 are offed inthe mysteriously gruesome circumstances
. the grisly muder count baffles the local officials
and fbi
. before i delve into the meat of tjhe review
, i ' d jsut liuke to confer
.
.
.
. is thast one helluva premise
, or what
?
` final destination '
, creepy beyond rational comprehension
, probably reads more liuke an unsettling
` x
- files ' epsiode than
` the simpsons '
- therefore
, the surprise isnt minimal when ytou discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan
adn james wong
. on familar turf
, the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan
and wong
,
and thte oppening 20 minutes of
` final destination ' reflects tath
. unlike most thrillers
, teh set
- up is crisp
and kool
. you jsut deeply
, sincerley hope that the momentum won ' t unspool
, leaving us wiht a second
- string affort wiht nothing
but cheap
, derivative shocks
. young viewers have a palpable reason tothe expect this kind of forumla deterioration
, what with
` i know what you doed lastr summer '
and sequel
,
` idle hands '
and
-
- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged liuke an anvil
-
-
` urban legend '
. after the setted
- uv
, when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair
, i started to relaly have funn with
` final destination '
. low
and behold
, a teen thriller tyhat isnt actually unsettling
, actually suspenseful
and
-
- yes
-
- actually intelligent
. some splotty logic
and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside
, this film is among the most refreshing
and all
- out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting
- edge
` scream ' in 1996
.
` fianl destination ' stimulates yhe nerves
and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood
- spattered slasher crap we ' ve endured throughout the past few eyasr
. nto that the characters are that ogod
. sawa is game as alex
, a connect
- the
- dots perosnality that we never fully comprehend
. inaddition adition
, tje survivors are endearing geek tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, jocky control
- freak carter
( kerr smith ofthe
` dawson ' s creek '
)
, carter ' s ditzy girlfriend terry
( amanda detmer
)
, the none
- too
- subtlely named billy hitchcock
( seann william scott
, supplier ofthe lukewarm comic relief
)
and a lone teacher
- the emotionally delicate ms
. lewton
( kristin cloke
)
. aside ffrom alex
, the primary center of intrest is intended to be ali larter
(
` varsity blues '
)
, playing an abstract carachter named claer rivers
( what were her parents thinking
?
!
?
)
. the personality of clear is written with such a vague
, nebulous definition tht she resembles a walking flash
- card saying
` hello
, i am the offbeat character designed to identify with tjhe main character ' s plight
! ' toss a few stereotypical fbi agents
( daniel roebuck
and roger guenveur smith
)
and a
.
.
.
. ummm
.
.
.
` spiritual ' mortician
( fromer
` candyman ' tony todd
) into the mix
,
and ytou ahev what could be another generic teenage frightfest wih slicing
, dicing
and assorted disembowelments
. not so
.
` fianl destination ' has no slicing
and dicing
, or at least none dealt by a human killer
,
and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique
and frightening
. the extra dimenion of disconcerting irony rejuvenates thge decaying
? murderer
- on
- the
- loose ' consept
, with assistance ffrom a shrewd
, intelligently paced screenplay by morgan
, wong
and jeffrey reddick
. the plot twists are fun
and clever wihtout toppling into utter absurdity
( listen up
,
` reindeer games '
)
.
bu i supose tjhe most satisfying aspect ofthe
` final destination ' is the murder scenes
. creative
, resourceful
and breathlessly inventive
, the death sequences involve an unlikey string of events leading to a character ' s demise
. what will trigger the accident
? wiull it be tjhe john denver record
, just put onthe to play
` rocky mountain high '
?
( yeah
, sick humer
)
. iwll it be the leaking toilet
? the falling fishing reel in the corner
? the murders are startling
adn largely unforeseen
, including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats
and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward
. a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with tihs inventive approach
. it gets sorta tasteless
anbd cheap sometimes
,
bu who cares
? it ' s fun
. in thgat simple reguard
,
` final destination ' isnt my cup of tea
. this stylishly executed thriller
,
although tagged with laughable circumstances
annd the occasional snippet of lame dialogue
, is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side
. after yhe show
, it will aslo have an frightening inpact on you
. when will your
? desgin ' expire
? is death waiting around yhe corner
? yhe
` final ' effect is a major case of the heebie
- jeebies
.
