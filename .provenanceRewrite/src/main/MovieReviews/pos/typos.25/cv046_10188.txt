at first glance
, it appears that the hmeo alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for thsoe wtih minds of 8
- year olds
. thgat ' s true of home alone 2
and i ' d bet money that it ' s true of hmeo alone 3
( opening soon
)
.
but home alone ctually hasnt a lot going for it
,
and the cartoon slapstick doesn ' t get in tje way
. the mcalisters
, all 15 of them
, are going to france for the holidays
. four adults
and eleven kids are spending tje night together befor heading to the airport en masse
. tyhe littlest kid
, kevin
, is the victim of the older kids ' cruelty
. kevin ' s patience runs out when he lerans that his plain
- cheese pizza hasnt already been eaten
,
adn he ' s going to have tothe starve
. he attacks his big bully brother buzz
, who had beeen teasing him
. tje fight disrupts the aready
- chaotic dinner
, spilling milk
and soft drinks all over the table
, a few cousins
,
adn an uncle
. yhe knee
- jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin
. nobody cameback to his rescue when he was being teased
,
bu they all point their fingers when he fights back
. the ultimate punishment comes from mom
( catherine o ' hara
) who sends him up tothe thte spare bedroom in the attic for the night
. on his way uv the stairs
, he tells her that
" families suck
"
and that he hopes never tothe see any of his familiy again
. that night thge power goes out
, knocking out the alarm clocks
, so the mcalisters wake uv in a big hurry to git to the airport
. inspite a surprizingly plausible setup
, kevin isnt mistakenly accounted for
,
and the family heads off without him
. it ' s interesting tyhat
, in a subtle way
, his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themslves from their children
. first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling
,
and second
, they put all the kids inthe coach while they fly first class
. htey ' re two
- thirds of the way accross the atlantic befoer tehy realize they are missing a child
. meanwhile
, kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true
. he ' s finally rid of his famaly
! life is a dream come true
. he can jump on the beds
, watch r
- rated movies
, eat gobs of ice cream
and potato chips
,
and dig through his big brother ' s secret box
. slowly
, yhe novelty wears off
and he settles into the mundane
. he grooms hismelf
, he does the laundry
, he goes shopping
(
" i bought soem milk
, eggs
,
and fabric softener
"
)
. he also starts tothe miss his family
, not just for their comany
,
bu for the security htey bring
. the furnace in the basement is a sacry monster
, thge ood man enxt door is a snow
- shovel murderer
,
and two crooks are trying tothe break into his house
. macaulay culkin is cute
but he isn ' t much ofthe an actro
. still
, we can see that kevin ' s character grows
, thanks to smoe good direction
and editing
. for example
, acting has littel to do with the emotional impact of tje scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night
, just as
" santa
" isnt getting in his car
. kevin asks the man to pass on his request
- he wants his famaly bcak
- to tjhe real santa
. he learned how tothe deal witht the furnace
. you turn on the lights
and it ' s not so scary anymore
. he goes to a church oney evening
and there he sees the snow
- shovel murderer
, who actulaly turns outloud to be a nice man
. they talk about their fears
and kevin learns that age alone doesnt not make you less afraid
. finally
, in thte last 20 minutes
, kevin confronts his last fear
- the bandits
, head onthe
( literally
)
. this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick
,
and after hte movie ' s genuine dramtic setup
, it is dessert
. it ' s a lot ofthe funn
,
and it doesn ' t overwelm the rest of tghe movie
. on the whole
, home alone is a great holiday movei
. john williams ' original score has the sound
anbd feel ofthe oliday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls
,
and the christmas setting can put you in the mood forthe those family gatherings
.
bu it does have its flaws
. the smallest probelm is that culkin doesn ' t ect very well
. as i said before
, he is cute
,
bu repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered hismelf than about culkin ' s insight into his character
. tyhe biggest problem is that durig the cartoony coda
, tyhe villains threaten kevin ' s life about five times
. instead of
" i ' m gonna git that kid
" they sday
" i ' m gonna kill that kid
.
" some might argue that the tone is the same
,
but i strongly disagree
. mixing comedy with specific
annd viable threats of murder isnt a sociopathic faux
- pas
. i ' ll probablly never see home alone 3
,
and i wish i had skipped home alone 2
,
but i do enjoy home alone almost every year
. don ' t let your impressions of the others detract from the orignal
, which has much more to offer thna cartoon slapstick
.
