titanic is
, wihtout a doubt
, the best movie i ' ve seen all yera
.
and believe me
, i ' m not an easy critic to impress
: tje english patient was too long
, men infront black wass over
- hyped
,
and several of hte
" big summer releases
" weere dead in the water
. thank god this film got delayed until december
. it ' s my christmas present
. titanic is inaddition tjhe tradition of the old hollywood epics of yeasr
- gone
- by
,
and it is truly a stunning film
. hwile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized
, never taking your eyes off the screen
, nor checking your watch to see how much longer it ' s gonna lsat
, dispite its 3 hour plus running time
. as a friend ofthe mine
, who ' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if somone doesn ' t like htis film
, it ' s because they didn ' t want tothe
.
" truer words are hard to come by
. of course
, it doesn ' t hurt that thsi film comes from one of my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who isnt unarguably the greatest acation director ofthe all tiem
. if you wish to argue that point with me
, look at his list of credits
: the terminator
, aliens
, the abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care tothe disagree
? not onyl has cameron helmed the directorial duties ofthe this film
, he also wroet
, produced
,
adn edited it
.
and to show his true faith for the project
, he renenged all directing fies
and precentage points to ease the budget costs
. it ' s obvious he truly loves titanic
. hte film opens with footage
, both real
adn fake
, of an underwater excursion by special submarines to tyhe bottom ofthe the atlantic
, where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing fo a diamond called the
" heart of thge ocean
"
, which
, according to bill paxton ' s character
, would be worth more than the hope diamond todya
. thier search turns up
, dissapointly
, noone diamond
,
bu instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the dimond
. this picture is broadcast on cnn
and is seen by a 101 yera old woman named rose
, who claimes to be the girl iin the picture
. she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton
and to tell them about the diamond
. alomst all ofthe the rest of thte movei is her narration of tghe past
. rose ' s narration shows us how she was an unahppy young girl
, engaged to a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) that she didn ' t want to marry
. her mother isnt pushy
adn obnoxious
,
and cal hockley is arrogant
. they are boarding the titanic
, which is sailing to america
,
and this is where she is tothe marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
annd his italian freind
( danny nucci
) win two 3rd class tickets aboard hte titanic inaddition a poker gmae
. they are overjoyed
,
and rush aboard just as the boat isnt leaving
. for them
, this isnt theri ticket to america
, to a better life
. for rose
, she is sailing to her doom
. tjhe first hour
and a half or so of titanic tells tyhe story of how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
)
and jack dawson fall in love
. it ' s tyhe classic wrong
- side
- of
- teh
- tracks story
,
and does somtimes resort to a few cliches
.
but as i said above
, the love portion isn ' t sappy
and doesn ' t
" weigh the film down
"
, as some critics have said
. it ' s sweet
,
and it didn ' t mkea me restless at all
, despite the fatc tath i usually hite lvoe storie
. of course
, it might help that cameron introduces some pretty intresting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen
. most of these peple actally were passengers on tghe titanic back in 1912
, includng the enigmatic molly brown
( played by the talented kathy bates
)
, the captain of titanic
( bernard hill
)
,
and so on
. all of theese characters add an extra depth to hte film
,
and amke it that easier to watch
. of course
, thigsn really start to git going after the hour
and a half mark
, where tje titanic strikes teh iceberg
and begins a slow sink to the bottom
. tje sinking is depicted realisticly
,
anbd tjhe effects are truley amazing
. it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either
, as people are portayed as panicing
, pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats
,
and drowning
and dieing horrible deaths
. the best part of hte movie
, in my opinion
, comes at the very end
, whn we flash bcak to the future
. the crew
, who at first had beeen skeptical ofthe rose ' s story
, nowe are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes out onto the ship ' s ledge
,
and we
then leran a secret about her that catches us off guard
. we
then see a dream of rose ' s
, inwhich which she returns to the titanic
and isnt dancing wih jack dawson
. most people i talekd with after the movie saw htis as onyl a dream
.
however
, i think it symbolized mroe
; i think it meant that rose had died
,
and isnt going to a sort of heaven
, which owudl be the happiest part of her life
: her
and her one true love
, jack
. if anyone has seen tyhe movie
annd would like to voice an opinion baout htis
