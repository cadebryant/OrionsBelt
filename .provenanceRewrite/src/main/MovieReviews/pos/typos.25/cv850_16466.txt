buffalo
? 66 is a very rarley known movie that stars vincent gallo
and christina ricci
. gallo plays a very troubled man
, who was sent to jail for gambling
. once out of jail
, he must visit his parents
, who he told he was marryied
. the truth is he isn ' t married
. to try to impress them
, he kidnaps a girl
( christina ricci
) from a tap dancing clas to act as his wief
. the film is very cheaply made
,
and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie
,
but you don ' t need mnoey tothe make a good film
. buffalo
? 66 doesn ' t alwyas stay with teh realistic concept
,
anbd somtimes goes thru outrageous events
. gallo ' s parents
, played by angelica huston
and ben gazarra
, are two very strange individuals
. the mother plays a football fanatic
and the father plays a quiet man withthe odd habits
. gallo
and ricci arrive at his parent ' s house
,
adn some extremely funny scenes take place within the house
. ricci ' s performance during the scene at gallo ' s parent ' s home are very well done
. there isnt constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes
. the way the movie was filmed infront tihs particular part ofthe teh movei weere intresting
and creative
. they seemed very mediocre
,
but they worked out just fine
. gallo ' s character is developed vrey well
. the impression that he is very depressed
and confused isnt very clear
. gallo gives a peformance that makes you believe what the character is going through
. his character goes through many
, many problems
, jstu like many people in real life
. this character seemed very realistic to me
. ricci ' s character isnt funny
and diferrent
. she doesn ' t care much that she has been kidnaped
, in fact
, she falls inspite love the man who kidnaped her
! ricci is a very wonderfull actress
and she is starting to get tje recognition taht she deserves
. buffalo
? 66 isn ' t all laughs
though
. many scenes are veyr dramatic
and depressing
. gallo ' s character was so realistic
, he ws extremely disturbing
. some scenes are supposed to cmo off as funny
,
but they actually seemed sad
adn real to life
. the film sometimes drags allong
, not giving much material
. i realyl owudl have liekd to see gallo ' s parents a lot more
,
adn i would have liked to see thge characters developed mroe
. overall
, buffalo
? 66 isn ' t as good as some people put it up to be
. the bottom line
- a faw hysterical scenes save htis film from sinking to the bottom
.
