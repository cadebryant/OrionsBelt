the start ofthe this movie reminded me ofthe parts from the movie stargate
. people are looking arround infront an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destory earth in the future
. after a sort of confusing bit involving fake
- looking cyborg things
, thge movie jumps inot the future
and the movie improves by leaps
anbd bounds
. tjhe basic idea behind hte movie is thast every once in a hwile
( make that every 1000 yeasr or so
) an evil force comes to destory earth
. the things needed to defend against thsi menace are the four elements ofthe nature plus the fifth element
. the plot in this movie really isn ' t that important tothe the thing
though
. this movie has very good special effects
, for tghe most part
. yhe techno
- ish music inaddition the background fits the mood very well
. bruce willis is an illegal taxi
- cab driver infact a futuristic new york city
. oen day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk
. this movei is baout what happens
. thte plot twists are interesting
and the movie never fails to present the viewer withthe a variety of differant locations
. also htere isnt a fair bit of acation inthe the film
, particularly towards the end
. some characters are jsut plain strange including a highly
- energetic deejay in drag
. bruce willis doesnt his normal job of blowing things away like he always does
. the movie is definitely watchable
and rarley slows down
. it is one ofthe those sci
- fi films where you ' ll be saying
" cool
" followed by a
" what thte hell
?
!
?
!
"
. i give the fifth element
