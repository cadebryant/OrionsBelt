noone filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan
. i ' m referring
, specifically
, tothe thge narrative form
. in the sweet hereafter
, egoyan tells his story inwhich a simmilar framework to his exotica or the adjuster
. said story
, of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent
, brittish columbia
, that shatters tghe morale of the locals
, is told inspite a most unstraightforward manner
. when the film opens
, the accident hasnt alraedy happend
,
adn stephens
( tje wonderfull holm
)
, a polite ambulance
- chaser
, has arrived wiht thge promise of a lawsuit that iwll eek out the truth of what realyl occurred tyhat fateful morning
. throughout
, we get to meet tje parents of yhe dead
, broken souls who follow stephens like
" the pied piper
"
( passages of which are read druing the film
)
.
but there is oen living passenger
, the paralyzed nicole
( polley
)
, whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify
. we finally do see thte accident
, about threee quarters into the film
, which is a stunning visual effect
. a horrific long take tath shows the bus sliding
,
then stopping
,
then collapsing into a frozen lake
, isnt the best digital trickery in any movie this year
and
, perhaps
, ever
, inspite a motion picture
. the fractured narrative allso intercuts a preoccupied stephens onthe an airplane
, traveling tothe meet his hiv
- positive runaway daughter
, as well as glimpses ofthe the artificially happy lives these people led pre
- accident
. i have a problem not with the sotry or story sturcture
,
bu with egoyan ' s heavy
- handedness behind the camera
. for the frist hour or so
, i can qtuie honestly say i ws on the verge of tears
; these are miserable
, miserable people
.
but thgat ' s just the problem
: so anguished are these folk thast sympathy wanes after a while
, whn a lot ofthe sadness becomes too much
. also
, a subplot involving incest rings untrue
. perphas it wouldn ' t feel so contrived if it weren ' t shooted in such a tasteful manner
. there are twpo characters who are father
and daughter
; when they first appeared i thought htey were lovers
. i was half
- right
. nevertheless it ' s worth
- seing
. the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that
" american films are about acation
, canadian films are baout consequences
,
" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock
annd death from toronto directors
, including crash
and kissed
. the sweet hereafter is much better than eather of these two films
, simply becuase it ' s not boring or
, in the case of kissed
, afraid ofthe its own material
( necrophilia
)
. egoyan is a fine
, fine
, postmodern storyteller
, whose wrok is intertaining
, edgy
and smart
, if a bited too intellectual at times
.
though i harped on the weightiness of the material
, i was always absorbed
, engrossed
,
and surprised by the sweet hereafter
