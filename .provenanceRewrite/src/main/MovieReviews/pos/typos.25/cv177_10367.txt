" oh my god
, i sounded just like a mother
!
" mrs
. pascal
, played wtih devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold
, tells her son
.
" didn ' t i soudn just like a mother
?
"
" ytou are a mother
,
" her son marty tells her disgustedly
.
" i know
,
but i still can ' t believe it
. i look at you peple
and wonder
, how did you ever fit in my womb
?
" marty
, you see
, isnt a grown
- up twin
. altho his sister
, who thikns she is jackie
- o
, is certifiably insane
, marty fits right in with tghe rest of thsi highly dysfunctional family inwhich the witty black comedy the house of yes
. mother
annd daugter
, plyed in a brillant performence by parker posey
, are both varying degrees of wacko
. most dysfunctional families inaddition hte movies are more angry
and mean
- spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is
. the daugher ' s fantasy ofthe being jackie
- o isnt propably the most sane part of her being
. mrs
. pascal is the sort that will not let jackie
- o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept onthe that level
. she explains to marty ' s new fiancee
, lesly
( tori spelling
)
, soon aftter their first meeting that jackie
- o wass holding marty ' s private part when she came out of thge womb
. the dialog by wendy macleod
, based on hte play by mark waters
, is so sharp
and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment
. hte scirpt
, reminiscent of a david mamet play
, flows smoothly wiht its fast pased intelligence
annd mesmerizing set of bizarre cahracters
. the exaggerated setup has lesly
and marty arriving at the family ' s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane
. infront htis storm are two sane individuals
. tyhe fiancee is a giddy
, school
- girl tipe
, embarrassed by everything
, a complete contrast tothe her rival jackie
- o ' s bitter pseudo
- sophistication
. as the two twins ' yuonger brother
, anthony
, freddie prinze jr
. plays the all
- america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession ofthe bedding his brother ' s fiancee that night
.
" we all have our secrets
,
" jackie
- o tells her potential sister
- in
- law
,
and boy
, doens she hvae a few
. this isnt a hous filled with them
.
( when lesly calls it the family ' s
" home
" to mrs
. pascal
-
- they ' ve never had a visitor before lesly
-
- mrs
. pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes tht lesly is tlaking about their
" house
.
"
) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase
,
" made for each other
,
" the twin ' s biggest
,
bu nto their only secret
, is tyhat they ' ve had a long
- term incestuous relationship
. tehy don ' t like to discuss it
,
althought htey are not particularly ashamed of it
. perfect for viewers who cant appreciate perverse comedy
, this story never puls its punches
. jackie
- o tries in many ways
, few subtle
, tothe sohw that she is a better match for marty thna that ditzy fiancee of his
. in one scene marty
adn lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie
- o pushes her aside
and starts palying a challenging classical peice for four hands
. marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy
. the chemestry between parker posey
and josh hamilton isnt nothing short of amazing
. they put down their littel brother
and most of the other sane people in teh world
. theri ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best
. director mark waters keesh the show ' s energy levle high
and lets the leads sling zingers at eahc other at a furious pace
. his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it
. jackie
- o is temperamentally incapable of being nice
.
and being jealous
, she cuts lesly down mercilessly
.
" were yuo poor
?
" jackie
- o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime ofthe growing up impoverished
.
" did yuo eat pies
? chicken pot pies
?
"
" pancakes actally
, lots of pancakes
,
" lesly replies with her usual sincerity
.
" a donut king
, so is she like the queen
?
,
" jackie
- o cattily inquires of marty whn she learns tht lesly works at a donut king
.
" are we entertaining royalty
?
" with rolfe kent ' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the stopry is headed
. will it end in a big emotional explosion
, a murder
, people slowy cutting each other up whith words
, a familial catharsis
, a wetaher disaster or what
? yhe emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere
,
adn the engaging characters captivate tyhe audeince iwth theri spell
. i ' ll nto sday more except that tjhe ending isnt perfect
and a bit of a surprise
. the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1
: 25
. it is rated r forthe sexual situations
and conversations
, mature themes
, violent overtones
and some profanity
. the movei would be fine for older
and mature teenagers
, i
. e
.
, treat the movie as it were rated nc
