wehn i firt saw the previews for ron howard ' s latest film
, my expectations were discouragingly low
. a show baout nothing
? sounds like
" seinfeld
.
" a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day
? soudns like
" the truman show
.
" what is it withthe hollywood that no sooner thna one production company puts out an animated feature baout ants
, another puts noe outloud about bugs
? whlch is why i was pleasantly suprised by
" edtv
,
" which turns outloud to be a fresh
, insightful
,
and often times hillarious film about the follies ofthe instant celebrity
. tje writing
, by howard ' s longtime collaborators lowell ganz
annd babaloo mandel
, is right onthe teh money
adn howard himself shoudl be credited forthe giving the subject marter a fresh focus
. in the hands of a less
- experienced director
,
" edtv
" could easily hve had all the flavor of yesterday ' s meatloaf
. wtih their ' true tv ' cable ratings being threatened by ' the gardening channel '
( apparently people owudl rather watch soil
)
, the northwest broadacasting company is looking for a novel consept to attract viewers
. program directer cynthia topping
( ellen degeneres
) comes up whith the idea ofthe putting a nobody on the air
and broadcasting his every waking
and sleeping moent
. the hook is to find a regular guy
, someone normal that peple can relate to
. while scouting possable candidates
, cynthia ' s camera crew disover ed pekurny
annd his pig brother ray
( woody harrelson
) in a bar
, where ravy believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes ofthe fame
.
bu on watching the videotape
, thge show ' s producers are more taken whith ed than with ray
. he ' s cute
, he says all the wrong things
,
and he ' s 100
% usda hick
. cynthia ' s boss
, played by rob reiner
, gives the sohw a week to deliver tjhe goods
and it ' s tough gonig in the early stages
. the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth
.
" acation shot
!
" wags one of the prodcution assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of teh toaster
. you get the idae
.
but soon enough
, things
-
- nielsen
- boosting kinds ofthe things
-
- start to happen tothe tihs unassuming san francisco video stroe clerk
and the ' true tv ' cameras are right there tothe document it
. ed ' s privacy is no longer his own
, his newfound fame starts having a negitive impact on his family life
,
and what little dignity he has left is trampled onthe by the media
. who should ed go out with
? you cin be sure the pollsters hve a list
. not only is the film exceedingly well cast
,
but its performers are consistently excellent
. matthew mcconaughey provides the face
, teh body language
,
and the lovable texan accent tothe fill the shoes of amercia ' s latest phenomenon
. he
and harrelson look like tehy really coudl be brothers
. sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed ' s mother
,
and martin landau is one of the film ' s highlights as al
, ed ' s ailing stepfather
. jenna elfman
( from tv ' s
" dharma
and greg
"
) proves herself surprisingly worthy inwhich the comany of kirkland
adn landau
,
althought thsoe alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting
. even degeneres
and reiner are better tahn yuo ' d expect
. in 1979
, writer
/ director
/ comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called
" real life
" in which a small
- time opportunist makes a real
- time documenatry about a typical american family
. thte scenes of ed ' s family sitting around the dinner tabl feasting on kentucky fried chicken
and waxing idiotic play like a big
- budget variant on that film
, paralleling its wickedly inventive humor
. as wih most films by albert brooks
,
" real life
" was funny
,
bu absurd
. the funniest
-
-
and scariest
-
- thing about
" edtv
" is thyat it is absolutly believeable
.
