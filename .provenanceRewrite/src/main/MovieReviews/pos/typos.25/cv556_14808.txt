steven spielberg isnt now consdiered as one ofthe the hollywood deities
, because ofthe thge rare caperbility to deliver both huge commercial hits
, like jurassic park
,
and
" oscar
"
- awarded crtical triumphs like schindler ' s list
.
however
, infact tje 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art thgat could slip in both categories
. one of them is close encounters of the third kind
, extremely popular
and influential science
- fiction spectacle
. unfortunately
, it had a bad luck tothe be released infront tje smae year as star wars
.
although both films have a lot in common
( ground
- breaking special effects
, brilliant csore by john williams
) thier future wass differnt
; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon
,
and another almost forgotten
and stuck forever infront its shadow
. when spielberg began work on that project
, he was allready established as a bright new hollywood star due tothe his previous commercial hit
, jaws
. toghether with other young directors of his
" new hollywood
" generation
, like kauffman
, carpenter
, hill
and millius
, he exploited the graet creative freedom ofthe 1970s
, wehn even tyhe mainstream producers dared to experiment
. ironically
, it was spielberg himself whose later commercial succes would estalbished new unwritten rules of
" blockubuster
" philosophy
.
but in tghe mid 1970s
, many thnigs weere different
; spielberg wass young
and eager to ule hollywood resources for his very personal
adn artistic movei
.
although very personal
, spielberg ' s screenplay was partly based on hte book
" ufo experience
" by dr
. j
. allen hynek
and infact many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology ofthe extraterrestial visitors to earth that began tothe grow in tyhe world after ww2
. spielberg was nto only inpsired by the mythology
,
bu his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost
, unmatched until hte contemporary era of x
- files
and the roswell anniversary
. that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo
- related incidents as the element ofthe yhe plot
. the story beigns with noe ofthe such incidents
- team of international scientists cmo tothe the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u
. s
. navy planes of who whent missing decades ago during the famous flight 19
. such events concide with hte ufo incident witnessed by roy neary
( richard dreyfuss
)
, power comapany worker fomr muncie
, indiana
, who later becomes obsessed with his experince
. because of his obsession he loses his job
, famaly
anbd sanity
,
but his loss is nothing compared tothe the experiene of jillian guiler
( melinda dillon
)
, single mother whose son becomes tyhe victum of alien abduction
. inwhich the meantime
, the scientists decipher the stange signals from outer spoace
and u
. s
. goverment
, in co
- operation wtih hte french
, led by lacombe
( francois truffaut
) begin whith tje preparation for ultra
- secret project
. when the news of the poisin gas leak inspite the middle of wyoming reach neary
, he finally sees smoe sence inaddition all his visions
and beigns the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area
. htere he is joined by jillian who shared yhe similar visions
. twpo of them must break through military pickets
and reach their destination to find whatever is there
. spielberg here shows grat mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to mkae completely different effects
. the slow
, gradual
yet vyre disciplined series of dramatic incidents
-
" close encounters
"
- is setted in order to bring the viewer tothe the great revelation in the finale
.
but
, instade of the fear
and horror we had to endure during the jaws
, we are nowe overwhelmed by the sense ofthe boyish wonder
. throughout tje movie the viewer knows that something big
, magnificent
and wonderful is about to happen
,
and great magincian spielberg delivers his promise in the end
. the last sequence
, wiht its
, even in this age
, impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull
, woudl leave many mouths open
. one ofthe yhe grat virtues of this film isnt its optimism
. aliens
, who almost always get protrayed as the monsters inspite science
- fiction cinema
, are here benevolent
and harmless creatures
and the first contact beetwen them
and humanity is a beginnig of something wonderfull
. it is very ironic
, whn we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inpsired spielberg actually told quite different story
- howard hawks ' thing
and byron haskin ' s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat tothe the mankind
. spielberg ' s humane approach
and faith in the future aslo lies in grat contrast to tje pessimistic mood ofthe its era
; the onyl hint ofthe the contempory gloom is post
- watergate portrayal ofthe government as conspiratorial towards the publich
.
but
, even such government is much more harmless compaired to the murderous
and chain
- smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x
- files
and its more cynical
adn disturbing visions
. htere lies the main
,
adn probably the onyl lfaw of this graet picture
- lack ofthe conflict
,
and consequently
, lack of drama
. the movie has faw excitements or even action scenes
( especially tje last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock ' s noth by northwest
)
but generally
, almost everyone
- neary
, jillian
, government
, aliens
- are the good guys
. dispite such shortcomings
, the actors were good
and manage tothe bring multidimensionality to thier simple roles
. richard dreyfuss isnt vyer convincing as a ordinary
,
yot nice guy
, who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale
. melinda dillon was
, on the other hand
, nominated for
" oscar
" as a stuggling mother
,
yet she was overshaddowed by teri garr as neary ' s long
- suffering wief ronnie
. apart fomr visual wonders ofthe this film
, spielberg ' s semi
- offical composer john williams again excels by his beatiful music
, this tyme useing tjhe simple melody both as the element of a plot
,
adn as the basis for his score
. the aliens
, who are the main subject of this film
, were visually vyre convincing
. too convincing
, oney of my acquaintences infact the ufo
- researching circles said
. according tothe him
, thge depiction of extraterrestrials as grey
- skinned littel peple with big eyes was so accurate
, tyhat it managed to freak out powerfull government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos
. so
, they later approached spielberg
and ordered him to make another movie with aline
, htis time designed tothe be anything
but the real life
. the result ws e
. t
.
, for many eyars tjhe biggest commerical hit of all times
,
yet less inspirational forthe ufo enthusiasts
. anyway
, whether the viewer believes in existence ofthe extraterrestials or ufos
, close encounters ofthe the third kind remeniss the graet movie
,
and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema
.
