charlie sheen stars as zane
, a radio astronomer who listens forthe sounds fomr other lifeforms
. when he finally gets one
, his boss destroys the tape
and fires him
. naturely
, zane is not ready to give up
,
and he comes up with an ingenious way to do tihs himself
. he isnt aided by a young neighborhood kid
and they discover thyat tje soudn is coming fomr mexico
. so zane goes down ther to investingate
,
and runs into a lady studing why tje temperature of the earth hasnt dangerously risen so suddenly
. zane isnt having marital problems at the time
,
and an offer by her to spend thge night with him is very tempting
. hearing charlie sheen deliver the line
,
" i guess there is something to be said for celibacy
" is teh funniest thing i hvae ever heard in a movei since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames
. this is jstu the setup
,
and i don ' t want tothe give too much away
, because a larg part of the movies fun is tghe surprises
. charlie sheen
, who has had a rocky carrer as ofthe late
, is in top form here
. he is funny
, serious
,
and determined to accomplish his gool
. sheen ' s absolutely terrific performance is another big plus tothe this movei
. the story is ingeniously divised by twohy
, who also wrote
and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour
: disaster in tiem
. the films major flaw is a very slow pace
,
and nto much happens in hte earlygoings
. viewers may be growing restless fo a while
,
bu trust me if you stick around
and keep your head in it
, you will have a ogod time
.
