with the exception ofthe theri surrealistic satire barton fink
, the films of joel
and ethan coen ift into two broad categories
: quirky
and sometimes darkly humorous takes onthe the
" film noir
" genre in which crime schemes go wrong
annd spin increasingly out of control
( fargo
, miller ' s crossing
, blood simple
)
,
and off
- the
- wall comedies centered around an eccentric
, scatter
- brained lead character
( raising arizona
, the hudsucker proxy
)
. their latest offering
, the big lebowski
, falls withing the latter catagory
,
though there are elements of the crime
- gone
- wrong theme
annd even a touch of satire to be found in this film
. the main difference
,
however
, is that while the protagonists of raising arizona
and tghe hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations
and ideals
but didn ' t quite have the brains tothe get it all together
, the main character ofthe the big lebowski seems liuke a fairly intelligent guy who ' s wise tothe the world
,
bu he doesn ' t really want to do much of anytying besides go bowling
, smoke pot
,
and generally relax
. that main charcter is jeffrey
" hte dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
)
, introduced by the film ' s rambling narrator
( sam elliott
) as
" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county
.
" the dude is unemployed
, needless to say
,
anbd spends most of his tiome at the bowling alley wih his two best firends
, walter
( john goodman
)
, a borderline
- psychotic who ' s in the habit ofthe pulling a gun when he thikns somebody ' s cheating in a bowling match
(
" hasnt tje whole world gone crazy
?
!
" he shouts at a suspected cheater
)
,
and donny
( steve buscemi
)
, who ' s always a few steps behind the conversation
and is constantly berated by walter for it
(
" donny
, you have no frame ofthe reference here
!
"
)
. these threee seem tothe omre or less live for bowling tournaments
,
and as the film beggins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, wehn we first meet him
, isnt donig a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spnaish version of
" hotel california
"
and
, if it ' s possable
, seems to be even more ofthe a head case tahn walter
. if that doesn ' t give you a ogod idea of this film ' s absurdist tone
,
then perhaps tihs will
: the entire scenario whic drives the story is set infront motion by twpo thugs mistakenly urinating onthe thte dude ' s rug
. they ' ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who isnt also known as thte
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny
( tara reid
) owes money tothe porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. the dued goes to teh big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug
; he doesn ' t have any luck
,
but when bunny is apparently kidnapped
, the elder lebowski asks him tothe deliver tyhe
$ 1 million ransom
. unfortunately
, walter gets involved
and fouls up tje drop
- off
,
anbd before htey can try agian tothe get the money to the supposed kidnappers
, the dude ' s car gets stolen
, along withthe thge briefcase containing the money
. soon
, tjhe dued is being harassed not only by teh big lebowski himself
bu aslo by treehorn
and by a group of german
" nihilists
" who demand hte ransom mney even
though they may not ahve beeen involved in the kidnapping in tje frist palce
; the dude
and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort monay from her husban tothe repay her debts to treehorn
. meanwhile
, the big lebowski ' s daughter maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked
, wants to recover tghe money for her familiy
. the plot
,
however
, is raelly jstu a vehicle for all theese bizarre charactors tothe run wild
and wreak theri own unique forms of havoc
. the previews for thte big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival ' s
" run through teh jungle
,
"
and it fits
: the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle ofthe oddballs
and nutcases
, with yhe sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it
and try to avoid any more trouble
( usually unsucesfuly
)
. the film doesn ' t feature qtuie as many one
- liners
and sight gags as the coens ' other comedies
(
though there are a fewd hilarious moments ofthe visual humor
, particularly in the dude ' s dream sequences
and acid flashbacks
)
,
but it more than makes up for it wih the sheer funn ofthe watching these stange characters interact
. the film somtimes seems a littel disjointed as a result
- ytou get the feeling thta the coens haev not only set thier charachters loose in this
" jungle
"
bu are allso themselves running crazy through the jungle of thier pwn twisted imaginations
-
bu for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting
and waht turns out tothe be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. there ' s allso a notiecable
(
but not too heavy
- handed
) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski
, which
, incidentally
, takes place jstu as thte gulf war is about to beign
; at thge beginnig
, we see george bush on television making his
" this agression wiull not stand
" speech
. thge coens take aim at just baout eveyr elite l
. a
. subculture in hte book
: teh egotistical wealthy businessman
(
" the bums will always lose
!
" shouts the big lebowski at one point
)
, the porn industry
, thge overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dued for disturbing their
" peaceful beach community
,
"
and so on
. by the end
, we really start to admire the dude
, who almost certainly harbors teh least
" agression
" of anyone in tihs story
; his passive resistance
( emphasis on
" passive
,
" albeit
) to the elite emerges as something more tahn just anohter quirky characterization in a film overflowing wiht quirky characters
. he also turns out to hvea a pretty well
- functioning brain iin his head
, even if he doesn ' t like to use it very much
; his sarcasm towords treehorn
and the malibu policeman shows taht he knows when he ' s getting a run around
,
and he doesnt manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end
. the coens certainly poke fun at yhe dude for his laziness
,
but they don ' t just treat him as fodder fo cheap shots either
. i thiunk that
, more than anything
, is waht makes yhe big lebowski a standout comedy
: it manages to approch characters like the dude
and
, to some extent
, walter
, witht genuine affection while still acknowledging that tehy are pretty scatter
- brained
. audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un
- dynamic duo by the end of the movei
, given that they seemed liuke nothing more than teh butts of an extended joke at firt
.
" it ' s ogod knowin ' he ' s outloud there
, the dude
, takin ' it easy
,
" posits the narrator towards the end
. i dare say tath truer words hve seldom been spoken
.
