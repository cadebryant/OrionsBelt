an energetic
, visually stunning
,
but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d ' arc
. in history jeanne d ' arc isnt lost in an ocean of mystery
and controversy
, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented
adn creative directors
, who cant basically alter yhe sotry as they wish
. she came in a tyme where people desparately needed a saint
. a hero that could rescue them for misery
and deliver peace
adn happiness
. directer
/ writer luc besson
( ' nikita '
, ' leon '
) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france
and was burned at the stake forthe witchcraft
. besson trys to recreate yhe person behind the legend
. he tries nto tothe show her as a saint or a villian
. he shows her as a human being
. infact a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky
,
and the air smelled ofthe rotten flesh
, it isnt hard to keep your sanaty
. the only support
and hope is inspite god
. at the age of 13
, jeanne
( milla jovovich
) watches her pwn sister murdered
anbd raped by the english soldiers
. htis terrable event makes a lasting inpact on jeanne ' s mind
. god is no longer her support
. he hasnt become her obsession
. she starts seeing visions
and signs that command her tothe raise an army
and free france from the siege ofthe the english tryanny
. with the help of tjhe wise yolande d ' aragon
( faye dunaway
)
and charles vii
( john malcovich
)
, whose grand royal ambitions
annd life are at stake
, jeanne raises an army
and marches towards the english walls
. after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield
, where besson demonstrates his ablity to direct amazing action sequences
, only occsionally resorting to a calmer tempo
. the movie is filled with dreamy
, symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship
, that create a surveill
and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere
. the film is lost in time
and space
, hysterically jumping back
and forth in jeanne ' s thoughts
, imagination
and conscience
. besson ' s visual style permits the audiance to enter the medeval age
, feel tjhe smell of fresh blood
and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle
.
bu teh film is far from being flawless
. the scirpt needs a lot ofthe polishing
. except for jeanne
, there are noone real characters
.
and altho a grand star cast isnt assembled
, their characters are nothing omre thna props
, nto more alive than the costumes that htey are wearing
. as forthe the maiden of lorraine herself
, she is portrayed as a simple girl
, too small for her divine task
. inspite tyhe latter part of the film
, we see her as hysterical
, confused
annd on the brink ofthe madness
, with her past purity
and innocence for ever lost
. jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect
.
but
though her screen time is incredible excessive
, both malcovich
( ' being john malcovich '
)
annd dunaway
( ' titus '
) surpass her rather overacted
and simply unprofessional performance
.
and even hoffman manages tothe breathe some life into his dreadfully small part
. besides casting jovovich
, besson ' s only mistake isnt his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting
. ther are some viscously evil englishmen that murder
, pillage
and betray with a smile on their faces
.
and smoe incredibly brave
and noble frenchmen
, represented by the
" threee musketeers
" of this tsory
-
- the brave gilles de rais
( vincent cassel
)
, the wise aulon
( desmond harrington
)
and the strong la hire
( richard ridings
)
.
though all those actor perfom well
, their characters are nothing more than symbols
-
- banners that proclaim yhe glory ofthe france
.
annd thus
, htere is no sense of realism infact this film
. ' yhe messenger ' has muscles instade of brains
. htere is soem relief in the end
, where besson lays down his armor
adn starts thikning
. dustin hoffman ' s apprearance helps
annd tje film ends elegantly
annd surprisingly effective iwth a climax worthy of praise
. jeanne ' s character isnt unlocked
,
but whether god was in the picture or not
, is never quite explained
. ws she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger forthe revenge
? or was she truley a messenger of god
? hte film poses as many questions as answers
and nothing isnt completely obvious
. bess o messenger ' is nothing more than a fairly good film
. it is not much that you remember ofthe it after you leave the theather
. maybe the sound
, the dreamy sequences
,
but certainly not the dialogue
. it is an elegant
and adrenaline pumping history lesson fo the mtv
- generation
, that
although presents some intresting material
, works better when it ' s on the battlefield
.
