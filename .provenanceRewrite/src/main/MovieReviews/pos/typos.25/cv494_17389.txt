i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean ' s war picture
. i still think taht it doesn ' t deserve bieng the number 13 in the american film institute ' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think thta lumet ' s
" 12 angry men
"
, wilder ' s
" wittness for the prosecution
"
and kubrick ' s
" paths of glory
" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958
.
bu i can ' t deny the importance of
" the bridge on thte river kwai
"
- cinematically
and inaddition its contents
. the film is setted in burma in 1943
. a bataillon of british soldiers inwhich japanese war captivity is forced by tyhe japanese to build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai
.
but tghe brittish commanding officer
, colnel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- corresponding tothe the geneva conventions
- thgat his offcers needn ' t work as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces the japanese commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way inwhich htis respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits hismelf fo the building of the bridge
. he considers it an opportunity to raise his men ' s morale
,
and he wants to prove superior brittish capabilities to the japense
.
but the brittish high command sends a few soliders who shall distroy thte bridge
, amoung them the american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee from tghe japanese prison camp
-
and the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flaw of the picture isnt the clich
? d characterization of tje japanesse peopel
. tehy are presented as if they weere intellectually inferior to the british
- as if the japense were incapable of buiding a bridge
.
and the film doesn ' t consistantly question the miltary spirit as kubrick doens in
" paths of glory
"
. lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierachies
. this is also perceptible in the conversations betweeen col
. nicholson
and col
. saito
. in this regard it is symptomatic that shears
, who doubts the military logic
, is a somehow unpleasant person in the film
. tje audience is suppossed to applaud col
. nicholson ' s persevreance conserning tje question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not
. the spectators are supposted to neglect thge risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes these risks
.
) that means
, the picture isn ' t perfect
.
but it has a lot of virtues as well
. it shows thte
" madness
" ofthe war
and what war can produce in peopel ' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes possessed by yhe idae of being a hero
and that others
( like shears
) get cynics
.
adn
" tje bridge on tghe river kwai
" is an intresting study of characters with clashing interests
. these points
annd tjhe sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti
- war film
( despite tghe inconsistencies in teh treatment of tihs theme
)
. david lean ' s effective
and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, especially in the dramatic
(
though not wholly plausable
) showdown
. alec guiness does a magnificent job of bringing col
. nicholson tothe life
and makeing him such an intresting character
. tje other actors deliver very good performances as well
. jack hildyard ' s fine color cinematography
and the apt score are also helpful
. i like this extraordinary film dispite its weaknesses
