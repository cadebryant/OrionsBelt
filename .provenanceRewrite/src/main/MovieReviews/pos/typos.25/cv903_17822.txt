robert altman ' s cookie ' s fortune isnt tyhat rare movei that does not depend on sentimentality tothe be uplifting
annd to make its viewers fiel good
. it is a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled with lovley performances
, skillful direction
annd topped off wiht an understated
, clever
, extraordinary scirpt
. as this isnt an ensemble peice
, it is forced to start of slowy as it introduces us to its cahracters
, all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs
. first we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man with a slight drinking habit
. we
then see that willie tkaes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who isnt slowly loosing her grip on sanity
and isnt being filled with lonelyness
, dispair
,
and want ofthe her dead husband
. we cut tothe camille
( glenn close
) who is obsessively directing a play wiht her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
.
then we briefly get accquainted with emma
( liv tyler
)
, an apparent relative of cookie
, who is a down
-
but
- not
- out teen outcast
, still full of love
and hope even
though she hasnt noone real palce to live
. we also fleetingly see emma ' s lover jason
( chris o ' donnell
)
, an ambitious
but far too excitable young cop
. we are nowe about one quarter through the twpo hour picture
,
adn robert altman decides thgat it isnt time to setted the plot inthe motion
. we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husban
. she exclaims
" here i come
!
"
and
thn puts a pillow tothe her face
and shoots herself
. soon after
, her neice camille stops by to git a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead
and flips out
. convinced that suicide is a disgrace
and that she will have none of thyat in her family
, she eats yhe sucide note
and convinces her slightly slow
(
yet sweet
) sister that it was a muder
. she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well
; scattering jewelry all over the floor
, breaking a few cabinets
, windows
and doors
,
and
then throwing the gun out in the back yard
. the onyl reasonable suspect is willie
, who immediatley gets tooked inot custody
,
and put in a jail cell
( tehy all know he didn ' t do it
, so the cell stays open
anbd he plays scrabble whith the sherif
anbd the faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, the unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe further cover up for the muder while at the same time makeing her easter play a sucess
. so beggins cookie ' s fortune
, a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as
" a southern spin onthe fargo
,
" except thgat this one is far funnier
and much moreso enjoyable than the coen brothers ' darker
, somewhat disturbing
and slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman ' s slight picture is in smoe ways reminiscent ofthe something liuke midnight in the garden ofthe ogod
and evil as well
, in that both films focus
( on
and off
) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town
. indeed
, most of the charactors infront cookie ' s fortune are loads of fun to observe
,
and a portion of them are fascinating
and surprisingly multi
- dimensional
. glenn close turns iin an insubstantial
( in terms ofthe her career
)
bu magnificent performance as the conniving camille
adn is also the source of a good portion ofthe tghe many laughs tath we enjoy inthe tihs movie
,
and she is perfectly cast as hte prolific
" aunt alexandria
" character
, endlessly obsessed with famaly dignity
. tghe equally essentual role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a time tothe kill
) there is nothing liek a movei which leaves you feeling all warm
and fuzzy inside hours
, even days after the film ends
. cookie ' s fortune is such a movie
. i loved the ight
, kindhearted approach altman
( whose last project wass the dark
, intense drama the gingerbread man
) took towards the trirchy subject matter
. i enjoyed the talented ensemble casted
. i even liked the trite
" in the sourth everybody is related to everybody
" cliche that is inevitably employed by tyhe time this movie draws to a close
. i ' m nto sure why cookie ' s fortune had such an all
- around pleasing effect on me
. perhaps it ' s that good ol ' southern charm
.
