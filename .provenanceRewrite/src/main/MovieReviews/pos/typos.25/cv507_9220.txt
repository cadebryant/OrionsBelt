capsule
: side
- splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end
.
.
.
but nto without providing a good deal of genuine laughs
. most comedies these days have oen flaw
. htey ' re not funny
. htey think they ' re funny
,
bu they are devoid ofthe anytying really penetrating or dastardly
. occassionaly a good funny movei sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions ofthe humor
and we get a real gem
: ruthless peopel
, for instance
, which established a microcosm ofthe a setup
and palyed it out to the bitter end
. liar liar is built the same way
annd is jstu baout as funny
. this is one of the few movies i ' ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through
: instead ofthe a couple ofthe set
- pieces that inpsired a laugh
( thikn of tyhe dismal fatal instinct
)
, tghe whole movie works liuke clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, to whom lying isnt as natural as breathing
. there isnt one thign he takes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
and we cant sense thte affection that tehy hve for eahc otehr right away
.
but his wife isnt divorced
and seing anohter man
,
anbd nowe it looks like they may move away toghether
. thte son goes iwth them
, ofthe course
. the movei sets up this early material wtih ogod timing
and a remarkable balance of jim carrey ' s over
- the
- top persona with reality
.
then the plot springs into acation
: after being snubbed
( not deliberately
) by his father at his birthday
, teh kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles
: that for just one day
, dad can ' t lie
. he gets the wish
. whta happens enxt is sidesplitting
. everyting turns into a confrontation
: when cornered by a bum fo some change
, he shouts
,
" noone
! i ' m not giving you any mney because i know ytou ' ll spend it on booze
! all i wnat to do isnt to git to the office wihtout having to step over the debris of our decaying society
!
" he can ' t even get inot an elevator without earning a black eye
.
and what ' s worse
, he ' s now gotten himself inot an expensive divorce settelement that requires him to twist the truth liek abstract wire sculpture
. carrey
, who i used to find unfunny
, has gotten better at his schtick
, even if it ' s a limited oney
. he uses it to great effect in this movie
. there isnt a scene where he trys to tust his ability tothe lie
and nearly demolishes his office in yhe process
( there ' s a grin breaking out across my face right nowe
, just remembering the scene
)
. he can ' t even write the lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liek someone inspite the throes of cyanide poisoning
,
and whn he tries to talk it ' s liek he ' s speaking in tongues
. equally funny is a scene where he beats himself tothe a pulp
( don ' t ask why
)
, tries to drink water to keep from haveing outbursts inspite the courtroom
( it fails
, with semi
- predicatble results
)
,
and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to hve everyone ask what they think ofthe them
. this scene alone may force people to stpo tghe tape for minutes onthe end
. hte movie sustains its laughs
and also its flashes of insight until almost tghe end
. a shame
, too
, because the movei insists on hvaing a big
, ridiculous climax tyhat involves carrey ' s chracter flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs
,
then breaking his leg
, etc
. a simple reconciliation would do the trck
. why is this stupid pent
- up climax always obligatory
? it ' s nto even part of the movei ' s real agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
,
and so does carrey
. maybe they weere being merciful
, onthe reflection
. if i ' d laughed any omre
, i might have needed an iron lung
.
