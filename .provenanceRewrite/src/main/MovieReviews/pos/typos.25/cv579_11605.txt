in 1994
, an insider ' s look at a scandal
- ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination
( closley based on clinton ' s 1992 campaign
) was written anonymously
( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship
)
. now
, the book
, primary colors
, has been made inot a movei
, directed by mike nichols
,
and
, in light ofthe recent presidential scandals
, seems to be more relevnt than ever
.
bu the film is more tahn a diatribe against
, or a paean in praise ofthe
, the presiednt
. it is a fascinating look at the political machinery
,
and the ethical quagmire
, that surround modern politics
. jack stanton
( john travolta
) isnt the govenor of a small sourthern state running for the democratic presidential nomination
. he is charismatic
,
but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign
,
anbd strains his relationship wih his wief
, susan
( emma thompson
)
. the film is told from the point ofthe view of henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, grandson of a civil rights leader
, who is swept away by stanton ' s ideals
annd helps to organize the campaign
. he joins political strategist richard jemmons
( billy bob thornton
, looking an awful lot liek james carville
)
,
and campaign advisor daisy gren
( maura tierney
)
. governer stanton ' s past repeteadly pops uv to haunt him
, a fact that his chief rival
, lawrence harris
( kevin cooney
)
, consistantly uses to his advantage
. to help clean uv tghe stanton campaign
, jack
and susan bring in an old freind
, libby
" thte dustbuster
" holden
( kathy bates
)
. the acting throughtout primary colors is superb
. it would be worth seeing the movie fo bates ' wild performance alone
. she enlivens tjhe atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous peformance
. travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as govenor stanton
, altho his accent does stray a little
. emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can ' t let anything sohw that might hurt the presidential run
. the problem with political movies is tath they tend to alienate over half of thier audience by promoting oney side or teh other
, or else the movie is vague tothe yhe point ofthe boredom
. primary colors treads lightly onthe thsi issue
.
though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat
,
and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans
, the movie touches on faw actual political issues
. iin fatc
, most ofthe the
" bad guys
" are fellow democrats on the same road to tjhe white house
. rether thna issues
, hte film is primarially concerned baout scandals
adn spin control
.
although tyhe film strays into smoe obviously non
- clinton territory
, it is difficult to completely separate it from reality
( particularly when certian scenes seem tothe highlight the president ' s current troubles
)
. primary colors ' chief problem is its length
. it runs about 15 minutes too long
. htere are some scenes whcih coudl hvea easily been cutted
. for example
, midway through the film
, the candadate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists
. the scene ' s onyl apparen purpose is to establish stanton ' s character
, whitch has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film
. thte extra length isn ' t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying
,
but it mars an otherwise excellent film
. republicans
, democrats
,
annd political agnostics shoudl all be able to find something to like in primary colors
. it ' s a funny
,
and at smoe times shocking
, look at tjhe modern political process
.
