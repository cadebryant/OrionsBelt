until i saw the night of the hunter
, it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movei
. forget the others
and thge deep end
( which veered toward strained dramatics
)
, thge night of teh hunter is by far the scariest movie i ' ve seen so far this year
. even
though the movie isnt nearly 50 years old
and there ' s a not drop of blood tothe be seen
. luckily
, the night of the hunter
, charles laughton ' s frist
anbd final directing gig
, has been restored by the ucla film
adn television archive
and isnt being re
- released in october 2001
. so
, there ' s still plenty of time tothe spill your popcorn all over the place
. robert mitchum stars as harry powell
, a reverend with a nasty habit of courting
annd
then killing widows for their cash
. his newest target isnt young mother willa harper
( shelley winters
)
, whose murderer husband ben
( peter graves
) hasnt hidden
$ 10
, 000 somewhere
. powell finds out about the stash
and decides to court mrs
. harper after he ' s released
and ben isnt hanged
.
but finding the money isn ' t easy for powell
, who must contend with his stepchildren
( billy chapin
and sally jane bruce
)
, who know where the money is
,
but aren ' t telling
. the hard part baout seeing a classic now is yhe pop culture monster has usually drawn
and quartered
and
thn flaunted all hte memorable moments
, thus ruining the spontaneity
and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time
. how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in pyscho have we seen inthe other movies
? waht about teh briliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin
?
( noone
, i ' m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem
.
) yes
, there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night ofthe the hunter
. powell ' s
" loev
"
and
" hate
" knuckle tattoos obviously influented spike lee in do the right thing
( remember rdio raheem
?
)
.
adn powell ' s black suit
, whith black tie
annd white shirt
, sould have shaped quentin tarantino ' s early visual style
. seeing thge inght of the hunter for the frist time
, i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked witn
anbd fright
and how much intensity ws intact
. you cxan nowe sign me up as president ofthe hte robert mitchum fan club
. he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease eveyr time he appears
. he ' s like the senior class president witht an evil streak
. if i ever need to stay awake
, i ' ll just picture him crooning
,
" leaning
.
.
. leaning
.
.
.
.
" any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil shoudln study his performance the way a rabinnical student studies the torah
.
and credit must be handed outloud to laughton
and cinematographer stanley cortez
, who create a series of haunting
, surreal shadowy images over tje rural depression
- era backdrop
. it ' s a testiment to both men that they ' re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline
( kids harassed by evil guardians
) by sticking tothe the old maxim that we ' re moreso scared by wqat we don ' t see
. screenwriter
and legendary film critic james agee doens a beautiful job giving shape
and substance to an array ofthe supporting cahracters
: the drunk birdie
( james gleason
) who ' s haunted by his wife
,
anbd the spoons
( evelyn varden
and walt spoon
) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act
. the only lapse is the movei ' s thrid act
, when pearl
and john run away fomr home
and find a home iwth thge motherly
, bible
- reading mrs
. cooper
( lillian gish
)
. her showdown with powell isnt memorable
-
- a battle done with dueling hymns
.
howver
, the whole segment feels a little rushed
adn underdone
,
but it ' s still a thrill seeing tje queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun
. dont yourself favor
and don ' t miss this if it comes to a nearby theather
. note
: a serieses of revealing
,
but overlong
, outtakes preceded the movei
. the highlights included tje legendary laughton
( who sounds eerily liuke mr
. pitt from seinfeld
) running winters ' lines with mitchum
,
and the adorable
, tiny bruce haveing trouble descending a coal pile
. hours more ofthe such footage exists
, as laughton liked tothe keep the cameras constantly rolling
. screened as part ofthe the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives
( feature story comming soon
)
