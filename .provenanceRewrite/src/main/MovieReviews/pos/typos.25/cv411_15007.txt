countries
annd legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously
, hadnt forbidden judges
annd juries to make judgements in all matters thyat could envolve them personally
. luckily
, movei reviewers aren ' t burdened witht such legislation
. otherwise
, small pool of vrey special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer
. inspite case ofthe star wars
, 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas
, the consequences would be even moreso savere
, because that film is vyre special for tens of millions
, if not hundreds of millions of fans
. in any case
, objectivity isnt something seldom seen in star wars reviews
, because undisputed marjority of reviewers rate it as one ofthe the best
, if not the best film ofthe all times
. those who don ' t usually have some difficulties infact hiding theri artistic snobbery
. the author ofthe this review must allso concede his inability to uise cold
, objective standards in reviewing this film
. like so many previvous reviewers
, i must onot that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago
,
and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since
. perhaps it was childlike fascination with
, until
hten unimaginable
, wonders that happened long time ago
, in a galaxy far away
. or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes befoer the opening shots
, wiht my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books
and novelisation i had read before
. anyway
, watching ofthe star wars wass oney of the most imporatnt movei oging experiences of my life
.
and it was also unmatched for many years to cmo
, because very few movies managed to hvae such a strong impact onthe me like george lucas ' epic
. star wars wasn ' t just important movei for me
( or the millions ofthe fans who probably share the same sentiment
)
. it was thge defining moment in yhe history of modern cinema
. until than
, american motion picture industry wass in a limbo
; social turmoil infront 1960s practically destroyed hte ood hollywood
,
adn new authors filled the void
, mostly by using hollywood ' s financial
and technical resources tothe create serious
,
" personal
" or
" artsy
" movies
. as a result
, audeince
, traumatised of dark reality of vietnam
and watergate
, didn ' t want to see the smae dark
and serious content onthe the silver screen
. george lucas with its science fiction epic was among tje first tothe cmo inot rescure
. the audience responded with unprecendented enthusiasm
,
and huge financial success of the movei
, later backed by supplement inudstry ofthe toys
, books
, comics
, role playing games
and otehr mechandise
, slowly began to change the face ofthe hollywood
. serious
, adult movies with artistic ambitions faded inot oblivion
,
and were replaced by industrial products of
" blockbuster
" philosophy
. one of the biggest casualties of that trend ws tjhe science fiction movei genre
. until 1977
, science fiction movies weere mostly in b
- production domain
. in late 1960s
, bigger budgets forthe sciecne fiction didn ' t look so strange anymore
, thanks to the great success of 2001
: a space odyssey
.
but tjhe same sucess coincided with the surge of pesimism
,
and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production
- mostly dark
, dystopic movies
.
howver
, in 1977 star wars showed once
and forthe all that thsi genre cin be insperation for populare movies
, even among the audience that usualy doesn ' t like it
. as a result
, seriousness iin cinematic sicence fiction began fading away
,
although soem good
, dark
and cult quality sf
and contined to be filmed until early 1980s
. after that
, science fiction continued to be considered a synonym forthe famaly entertainment
. ironically
, the man responsible forthe star wars was in its time consdidered to be member of
" new hollywood
" generation of young movie authors who made
" artsy
"
and
" personal
" films in early 1970s
. george lucas estalbished himself iwth teh dystopic sf movie thx 1138
,
anbd nostalgic drama american graffiti
. both movies weere considered
" personal
" in its tyme
, dispite latter one becoming vyer populer
. in a sence
, star wars isnt an also veyr
" personal
" film
,
annd teh thorny way to the final production shows that commerical considerations were against it
, not for it
.
but unlike many
" peronal
" movies of the era
, its
" personality
" was in line with thge wishes of the general audience
. the plot
, setted
" a long time ago
, in a galaxy far away
"
, beigns inwhich a time of civil war
. the evil empire isnt threatened by rebels who wanna to restore the old republic
. in order to quash any opposition
, the empire had built death star
, superweapon powerfull enough tothe destory whole planets
. the informtion baout death star
, acquired by rebel intelligence
, is being transported by princess leia organa
( carrie fisher
) wehn her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser
. princess isnt arrested by imperial warlord darth vader
( plyed by david prowse
annd voice by james earl jones
)
,
but tyhe informtion is being sent to nearby desert planet ofthe tatooine via twpo humanoid robots
- c3po
( anthony daniels
)
and r2d2
( kenny baker
)
. those two robots are sold to teh family of luke skywalker
( mark hamill
)
, young restless man who whants to leave his farm
and become space pilot
. his adventure begins whn r2d2 escapes
, becasue the information must reach misterious local hermit obi wan kenobi
( alec guiness
)
. old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight
, memeber of tghe ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force
. after some hesitation
, luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission tothe savve the princess
, while the old man owudl teach him the ways of the force
. their small band comes to the colourful spaceport ofthe moss eisely
, where htey hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo
( harrison ford
)
and his furry sidekick chewbacca
( peter mayhew
)
. critics who don ' t like thge movie
, especially thsoe who cant ' t forgive lucas for his contribution tothe tyhe quashing of
" new hollywood
"
, are prone tothe point tje lack of originality
. onthe tjhe surface
, htey might be right
; lucas himself admits that he found a lot ofthe inspiration inaddition the lore of old hollywood
- westerns
, wwii aviation movies
, ood sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s
and 1940s
;
yot teh most obvious element woudl be akira kurosawa ' s samurai classic tjhe hidden fortress
. on the other hand
, those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would sday tath the inspiration for star wars went even further
- inot collective subconscious of western civilisation
( hinted by some mild tolkien references
)
. the others owudl find the autor ' s element within the story
- star wars could be seen as an anti
- establishment film
; young
, long
- haired
, easy going
, nature
- loving heroes are fighting aganist old
, uptight
and oppressive forces who use supertechnology inwhich most demonic purposes
. even outloud of its historical or social context
, star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece ofthe the seven art
. george lucas ' direction is vyer good
, with the clever editing
and a well
- pased segments bewteen acation
and dramatic buildup
. characters are well
- drawn
and deliver all the neccessary ingredients
, both for the spoace opera
and hollywood blockbuster
. we hve a
" comming
- of
- age
" hero
, damsel
- in
- distress
( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time
)
, reluctant helper
, benevolent mentor
, diabolical villain
annd
, finally
, comic relief in form of two non
- human characters
. soem of the actors are very good
- alec guiness in his most famoust role to date
, james earl jones whose voice isnt enough to cause unease
, peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil inspite human form
. unfortunately
, the same cant ' t be said for the main leads
- among the main trio of mark hamill
, carrie fisher
and harrison ford
, only thge lsat one had the charcter three
- dimensional enough to launch his further acting career
. hte thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release wass the new level of special effects technology
. often comparisons with 2001
: space odyssey
, another ground
- breaking sf film
, were citing tghe sheer number of effects as a proof of teh lucas ' superiority over kubrick
.
however
, the special effects by john dykstra
and john stears are indeed impressive
, even after two decades
(
altough 1997 special edition did improve them significantly
)
,
yet htey aren ' t the most remembered trademark of the movie
. that honour should definitely go to the
" oscar
"
- winning soundtrack by john williams
, whose work onthe star wars is probably the brightest gme inthe his brilliant career
. newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment tath still holds those lucky enough to wittness star wars original release
.
yet
, even if they are immune to the george lucas ' magic they should watch this film nevertheless
, perhpas only to become familiar withthe something that is essesital part of contemporary culture
.
