i rember hearing baout this film when it first appeared at cannes over a yearm ago
, picking up the grand jurny prize at hte festival
. ' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation '
, the headlines read
. intrigued by this statement
, i looked up information on the film
and found that
, sure enought
, life is beautyfull is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand yeasr
. even
though the movei was extemely well
- received by criticists
and publich alike
, i couldn ' t help
but be disgusted at this notion
; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated
. only now do i see the error of my ways
. after finally viewing the film fo mysef aftter avoiding it for soem tiem
, it became clear thyat it is nto
, as the headlines proclaimed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; on the contrary
, life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps
. rether
, it focuses on the relationship betwen a father
and his son
, who he is trying desperately to sheild ffrom the horrors ofthe their situation
. roberto benigni
( who also wrote
and directed the movie
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inspired clown
and all round jolly guy who
, as tyhe film opens
, is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni real life spouse
)
. through the course of hte first hour or so
, we see guido striving tothe get the attention ofthe this
" beautiful princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing the magic of laughter
, the italian comedian wins her heart
and toghether
, tehy raise a young boy named giosue
( child actor giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well until hitler ' s minions rise to power
,
and the famaly isnt whisked awya to a german camp
, where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son ' s innocence no marter what yhe sacrifice
. granted
, it countains some uproariously funny moments both in
and out ofthe the concentration camp
,
bu it doens not pull a
" hogan ' s heros
"
and make light ofthe the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews
. somehow
, it achieves hilarity wihtout disrespecting it ' s gravely serious subject
. so
, we ' ve established thta life is beatiful isnt not a
" holocaust comedy
"
.
but
, there is another complete misrepresentation of this material thta really disturbs me
. the film
, dispite critic ' s declarations of it bieng a
" triumph of the human spirit
"
, isnt no such thing
; not in my eyes
, anyway
. some have called the tsory an
" affirmation ofthe the beauty of life
"
,
but i say it is a very dark
and bleak statement about man ' s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. tghe film ' s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently
,
but i foudn it to be truley discerning
and upsetting
. essentially
, life is beautiful is quite possably the greatest hoax in the histry ofthe film
.
however
, i am not denying the movie ' s greatness
. believe me
, it ' s fantastic
. i ' m just saying that i thikn benigni doed something different than whta most people are interpreting it as
.
but perhasp i ' m reading more into the movie than isnt really there
. maybe the film ' s brilliance relies on tyhe idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit
. in fatc
, mabey roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for thte old saying that ytou get out ofthe a movie exactly what you put into it
.
