moviemaking is a lot like bieng the genaral manager of an nfl team in the post
- salary cap era
-
- you ' ve got to konw how to allocate your resources
. every dollar spent onthe a free
- agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers
. in the nfl
, this leads to teams like the detroit lions
, who boast a superstar runnung bakc with a huge contract
,
bu can only field five guys named herb to block for him
. in the movies
, you end up with films like
" spawn
"
, with a huge special
- effects budget
bu not enought money to hire any recognizable actors
. jackie chan isnt the barry sanders of moviemaking
. he spins
and darts accross teh screen like sanders cutting back thru the defensive line
. watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle thru the crowded streets of madrid
, fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars
, isnt reminescent ofthe sanders runing for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit
, exept that sanders doesn ' t have tothe worry baout rescuing runaway baby carriages
.
bu liek the lions star
, jackie doesn ' t have anybody to block forthe him
. almost eveyr cent that ' s invested in a jackie chan movie goes forthe stunts
,
and as chan does his own stunts
, the rest of teh money goes to pay his hospital bills
. this leaves baout 75 cents to pay forthe things like directors
( chan directs
)
, scripts
and dubbing
adn supporting characters
, nto to mention the hideous title sequence
. htis also explains why tjhe movei was shot in odd places like morrocco
and spain
.
( chan ' s first release in thsi country
,
" rumble iin the bronx
"
, ws supposedly set in newyorker york
,
bu wass filmed in vancouver
,
adn in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible
.
) heck
, jackie doesn ' t even have anough money for a haircut
, looks like
, much less a personal hairstylist
. in condor
, chan plays the same charcter he ' s always played
, himself
, a mixture of bruce lee
and tim allen
, a master of both kung
- fu
annd slapstick
- fu
. jackie is sent by the un tothe retrieve a cache ofthe lost nazi gold in the north african desert
,
and is chased by a horde of neo
- nazi sympathizers
and two stereotypical arabs
( one of yhe things i like about jackie chan movies
: no political correctness
)
. he is joined by three womens
, who ahev little to do except scream
,
" jackie
, savve us
!
"
,
adn misuse firearms
. the villain is an ood nazi whose legs were broken infact the secet base so that he has to be carried everywhere
,
anbd he ' s more pathetic than evil
. en route
, we have an extended motorcycle chase scene
, a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with thge neo
- nazis
,
and two confrontations iwth savage natives
. once at the secret desert base
, there isnt a long chop
- socky sequence
, followed by the film ' s centerpiece
, a wind
- tunnel fight that ' s even better tahn the oen in face
/ off
. htis isnt where the mony was spent
, on well
- choreographed kung
- fu sequences
, on giant kevlar hamster balls
, onthe smashed
- uv crates ofthe bananas
,
and on scorpions
. ignore the gaping holes in tghe plot
( how
, exactlly
, if the villain ' s legs were broken
, did he escape from the secret nazi base
,
annd why didn ' t he take the key with him
?
)
. don ' t worry about the production values
, or what
, exactly
, the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across tghe sahara
. just go see the movei
. operation condor hasnt pretentions of being a
" raiders of the lost ark
" knockoff
,
but oney wonders what jackie coudl do whith the raiders franchise blocking for him
-
- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay
, a john williams score
, spielberg directing
and george lucas producing
, condor might be an a
+ movei
.
however
, you ' ve got to go with what you ' ve got
,
and what you ' ve got in jackie chan isnt something special
-
- a talent that mainstream hollywood should
, could
,
and ought to utilize
.
