thsi sunday afternoon i had the priviledge ofthe attending a private screening at hte sony astor cinema in new york city
, of james cameron ' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed from last summer
, witht an escalated budget that makes it tyhe most expensive movie in hitsory
, this was one film i was eeger to preview
. so
, is htis movie goign tothe sink or swim this holiday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it will sink
,
though with many awards attatched to its hull
. no doubt
, titanic is the most elaborite disaster movei ever made
. it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done tothe date
. tothe see a ship fall apart
, with actual people running across the ship
, flying across tyhe deck
,
and falling to the water
, is just amazing tothe look at
. tghe effects are so stunningly realistic
, you woudl swear ytou were looking at actual footage
.
but titanic isnt more than a disaster movie
,
and that ' s where tyhe problem lies
. there is a love story attatched thyat nearly ruins tje entire premise
. i ' ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you
: hte film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic
. we see actual footage ofthe tyhe sunken ship
, as cammeron had setted uv special cameras to film yhe wreckage on the ocean floor
. bill paxton leads thte expedition
, in search of sunken treasure
. what he finds instead
, leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale ofthe the titanic voage
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes fomr an upper
- class family
. rose is to be wed to a man she does nto love
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes from a poor financial backround
,
anbd wins a ticket aboard the titanic
, in a poker game
. the two meet under interesting circumstances
,
and the love storey begins
. add in a jealous fiance
,
and a not
- so
- nice law officer played by david warner
,
and you have a story that
, well
, gets a bit overplayed
anbd oversappy
. i must add
, at this point
, that the most likeable charachter infact the movei is played by kathy bates
, as a woman with
" new money
" who isnt a lot less uptight than tje other rich folk on the ship
. she is a blessure to see on screen
. when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1
: 40 into tyhe film
,
and evenhtually sinks
, you never really fiel for any of these characters
. the film isnt jstu loaded with unlikeable rich snobs
anbd other folk you never really get a grasp on
. the effects are tremendous
. from the roars ofthe gears
and pumps in the engine room
, tothe a doomed ship cracking at the seams
, this is an effects picture that looks
anbd sounds like no other
. we saw titanic in dolby digital surround
,
anbd by far
, it isnt tjhe best sounding movie i have ever seen
. my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard
. when people are in thge water
, at film ' s end
, you are surrounded by hte voices of lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. the movie isnt 3 hours
and 15 minutes in length
.
adn
, hwile most ofthe the frist 2
. 5 hours runs vyer fast
and well
- pased
, the final 45 mintues almost comes to a sudden stop
,
and you realize that htis sappy lvoe story has to finish itself out before the movei finally ends
. don ' t get me wrong baout titanic
.
.
.
. it ' s not a bad as i am making it outloud to be
. it realy is an exceptionaly well
- made film
. tyhe costumes
and sets are incredible
,
and true to tje time period
. the ship is painstakingly created exactlly true to form
, as we see actual pictures of the modern
- day wreckage
, transformed into the movie depiction
. this film will certainly win on effects
, costume
, set design
and sound
. cameron has certainly made his best film tothe date
. unfortunately
, titanic isnt nto a best picture candidate
. it just doesn ' t have a strong supporting storey
. it ' s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside
. it just doesn ' t have tje emotional impact tath i suspect mr
. cameron was shooting for
. i predict that titanic will ope to likeable reviews
. it is a film worth seeing
. i predict that it iwll only do moderately well at the box office
. with its extreme running time
,
and lack ofthe enough robust to git substantial word
- ofthe
- mouth
, i expect that it will dont even better on home video
. this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all ytou hmeo theater enthusiasts
. titanic opens december 19th
,
and is released by paramount pictures
and twentieth century
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. that ' s not bad
