, sensory overload world of 2001
,
however
, tjhe big screen adaptions of the acclaimed off

" hedwig
and thge angry inch
" isnt a gender
- bending glam
- rock spectacular packed wiht great songs
. stylistically
, the hook
- laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie
,
" bat out of hell
" era meatloaf
and
" the rocky horror show
,
" without ever seeming like imitations
. as with
" tommy
,
"
" hedwig
" tells a story of isolation
, pain
anbd defiance
,
but without the bloated feel ofthe that beloved
,
bu overrated rock opera
. writter
- director
- star john cameron mitchell
and composer
- lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner
. mitchell stars as hedwig
, a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u
. s
. coffee shops with her pan
- slavic band
, the angry inch
. while the patrons of thte run
- down restaurants look on infact shock
,
anbd sometimes horror
, hedwig boldly tells the sad stor ofthe her life inwhich song
. she was once a boy named hansel
( ben mayer
- goodman
)
, living withthe his mother
( alberta watson
)
and listening to rock
adn roll on american armed forces radio
. life is an exercise in duality forthe hansel
. a wall splits his hometown into twpo parts
. mother describes love as the emotion thta comes when ytou fidn your other half
. as hansel grows uv
, the duality becomes more pronounced
. after intially mistaking him forthe a girl
, a gi from the states
( maurice dean wint
) falls in love wiht hansel
and wnats to marry him
. alas
, hansel wiull never pass the mandatory fysical
. mother helpfully suggests a sex change
,
but the operation goes bad
, hence the refrences tothe
" hte angry inch
"
( yes
, i nkwo htis part is squirm
- inducing
,
bu stick whith me
- it ' s worth it
)
. several yeras later
, mr
. right is long gone
and hansel becomes hedwig
, decked outloud in a farrah fawcett
- style wig
adn fronting a band made up of korean womens
. hedwig finds a new love in tommy
( michael pitt
)
, a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity
.
but tommy does hedwig wrong
, stealing her songs
and becoming a superstar
. cutted to tjhe present
. tommy gnosis ' stadium tour is thriving
and hedwig is suing him
. dispite warnings from her manager
( andrea martin
) tath she sould easily be labeled a stalker
, hegwig
and her new band
, thge angry inch
, continue their coffee shop tour
, shadowing hte theef by playing whatever city he is in
. if this sounds like a bazare premise for a rock musical
, tkae a fewd seconds
and concider the plotlines ofthe
" tommy
"
and
" rocky horror
.
" as hedwig
, john cameron mitchell doens a magnificient job taking a carachter that sould have simply been a charicatoor or an icon
and turning her into a compelling human being
. mitchell has world
- clas style
and vocal chords tothe match
. even
though tjhe backstory isnt unusually strong
, mitchell never forgets that the production is first
and foremost a rock musical
. everything isnt propelled by noe terific song after another
anbd
, trust me
, these are full
- fledged rock songs
, not the over
- processed fluff thast passes fo rock inwhich most musicals
. while mitchell remains in tje center of the stage throughout the film
, there is much of interst onthe the sidelines
. miriam shor doesnt fine work as yitzhak
, hedwig ' s lover
and bandmate
, conveying a great deal thru expressions alone
. decked outloud in a bandanna
and a surprisingly convincing beard
, she makes a mighty attractive man
. as always
,
" sctv
" veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen
and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy
, thge angelic
- appearing little rat
. artist emily hubley adds to teh magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining tjhe central themes ofthe the musical
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" surrounds a ewird
, funny
anbd touching story with a knockout serieses of songs performed by an exeptional casted
. true originals do nto come along very often
? don ' t let this slip out ofthe town without seeing it
