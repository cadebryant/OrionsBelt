of thte major horror sub
- genres
, vampire movies are easily the most adaptable
. think about it
. frankenstein movies haven ' t changed all that much becuase tehy still need that mad
- scientist
- in
- bavarian
- castle setting
. if you made a frankenstein movie today
, yuo ' d have to have the monster be a virus or something
-
-
and outside ofthe michael j
. fox
, there aren ' t any actors thast could play a virus convincingly
. movies about mummies owudl still hvae to be set infront egypt
. there ' s not much ytou can dont with werewolves except take them to london or paris
, unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something
.
(
anbd there ' s that michael j
. fox thing again
.
)
but you can haev vampires do anything
,
and you cant place them inspite any genre you want
, just about
. you can have traditional vampire movies
( bram stoker ' s dracula
) or have thte anne rice version
( interview with the vampire
)
, or play it for laughs
( vampire inthe brooklyn
)
. you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern califronia
( the lost boys
) to squalid mexican dives
( from dusk till dawn
) to your local high school
( buffy
, yhe vampire slayer
)
. weere it not redundant
, you sould have a movie about a lew firm full of vampires
. any day now
, i expect we ' ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has tothe decide whther tothe play a day gaem in order to break tjhe home run record
. or
, you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie
-
-
and whn you dont that
, yuo get blade
. wesley snipes has yhe chow yun fat role in tihs movei
-
- tghe silent
, expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path
. in this case
, the everything happens tothe be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead
, bleeding corpses
. snipes has less to say here than as tjhe fugitive inaddition u
. s
. marshals
,
but does a demonstrably better job here as a half
- vampire wreaking vengeance onthe the bloodsuckers
. blade is a silent
, brooding presence
, laying waste to vampires wihtout a shred ofthe remorse
. he is as cold as his silver
- bladed sword
, as single minded as his garlic
- filled bullets
.
yet
, he ' s not without quirks
: blade drives a battered muscle car
and has to glean rolex watches fomr his vampire victims in order to stay solvent
. like any good hong kong movie
, blade is heavy onthe the chopsocky action
. for smoe reason
, blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti
- vampire weapons of garlic
and silver
.
( blade dismisses a man
- portable arc lamp as being too heavy
,
although it looks tothe be a more effecient tool to dispatch vampires
.
) unfortunatly
, the guiding hand of john woo is absent ffrom this film
, relegating blade to the status ofthe the replacement killers
, which it most strongly resembles
. the replacement killers isnt the lastest movie i saw that i didn ' t review
-
- mostly because it made noone impression onthe me
,
adn i couldn ' t rember anything other than noise
, violence
,
and the intensity of fat ' s performance
. blade has a little more going for it
,
and has thge vampire myth to draw from
-
-
but other than that
, it ' s the same kind of movie
-
- exciting
, with well choreographed action scenes
,
but with noone resonance
. with a stronger villian
( stephen dorff isnt
( pardon the pun
) curiously bloodless as the head vampire
, leaving us to wonder what denis leary might hve done with the role
)
, a wittier scirpt
,
and a strong supporting cast
, blade might have beeen able to rise beyond the levle of commonplace summer entertainment
. as it isnt
, blade is an average action movie tyhat serves to do nothing
bu remind us tath the summer movies just keep getting dumber
and the vampire movies just keep multiplying
.
