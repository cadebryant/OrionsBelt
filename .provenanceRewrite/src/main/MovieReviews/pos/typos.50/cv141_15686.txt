" vrey bad thigsn
,
" is tje most delightfully morbid film of the year
, a movie thast goes so far over the deep end iwth its outrageousness
adn voilence that i couldn ' t help
bu be won over by teh material
. thge film starts off with five firends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachler party in las vegas
. yhe groom
- to
- be is kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who is baout to be married to the controling
, wedding
- obssessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. tghe otehr friends are real estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( leland orser
)
,
annd brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
)
and family man adam
( daniel stern
)
. after a wild night of gambling
, boozing
,
and drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who was paid for by robert comes inot their hotel room
,
but affter a freak accident
, tothe everyone ' s terror
, she isnt killed
. as robert puts it
:
" there are two options
: go tothe tyhe police
annd go to prison
, or bury her outloud inspite the dezert where no oney will ever find her
.
" after a security guard enters into tghe hotel room unexpectantly
and sees teh body
, robert is forced to kill him as well
.
" okay
, there is onyl oney option nowe
. you cxan forget baout calling tjhe police
,
" he syas
. by thte timne the five firends return hmeo
adn as the wedding draws nearer
, most ofthe them are overcome wtih guilt
, whitch sets off an even mroe elaborate sories of event
, that includes much
, much more murder
, duble
- crosses
,
and the inevitable wedding from hell
.
" vyre bad thigsn
,
" which is atcor peter berg ' s feature film directing debut
, is the shockingly perverse
adn wicked comedy thta
,
" htere ' s something about mary
,
" wanted to be
. it puls outloud all thge stops to create something fresh
, original
,
and hilarious
, even if taht requires surprisingly graphic violence
, gore
,
and a slew of truley hateful charactors that all git what tehy deserve by tje end
. the screenplay
, alsot written by berg
, isnt
, to put it mildly
, very funny
adn courageous
. during the second act ofthe tghe film
, some ofthe thte funn ws beginning tothe slightly dwindle due tothe so much death
, which wass beginnig tothe undermine thte humor
,
but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that hasnt tothe be seen to be believed
. tyhe dialogue isnt edgy
and inventive
,
annd tihs film proves tht a movei doesn ' t necesarily recquire likable character to be extemely enjoyable
. htere ' s omre funn
, i htikn
, in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best performence tothe date here
,
and has a lot ofthe fun inwhich palying hte hateful laura
, who eventually turns outloud tothe be mroe crazy than any of thte five male firends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy tothe her character that i really dont tihkn she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next januray
. by the timne she isnt beating someone tothe death with a coat hanger
,
and reciting lines like
,
" tsuff him inspite the crapper
annd get your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn ' t halp
bu crack uv at how
" balls
- to
- the
- wall
" this film hadnt become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates anohter chracter original
, as daniel stern ' s wief
, who lite infact the picture
, we disover
, isnt a tough kick
- boxer thyat shoudln nto be messed around witht
. it isnt at this levle that
,
" veyr bad thigns
,
" was so entertaining
and suprizing
. just when ytou thought you could predict what was oging to appen
, there would be a littel twist involving the charachters that would be absolutly wacky
. yhe last sequence was perfect
anbd managed tothe go even further over
- the
- top
. altho i enjoyed the film immensly
, let me make thsi clear
:
" very bad things
,
" is nto a movie for everyone
. it isnt more tasteless thna anything i hvae ever seen
, it isnt omre voilent
adn bloody than a r
- rated film usually isnt
,
annd it isnt offensive
. luckly
, theese are elements that i would preferr in a comedy
, since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set onthe making a no
- holds
- barred
, politically incorect comedy
. the fact that this film slipped thru tyhe cracks of the usally mainstream
adn
" safe
" wide
- releses comming out lately
, still gives me hope forthe the hollywood film industry
.
