director dominic sena
( who made tje highly underrated kalifornia
)
annd producer jerry bruckheimer
( thge rock
, armageddon
) bring us a slick
anbd intertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same nmae thgat absolutly no oney hasnt ever seen
. nicolas cage plays memphis
, a retired car thief who ' s
" pulled back infront
" to tjhe business by an evil car thieve overlord
( christopher eccleston
) determined tothe kill memphis ' kid brother
( giovanni ribisi
)
. memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars iin four dyas time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise
, all while having to elude tyhe detectives hot on his trail
adn a rival car thieve who fiels thge job should have been given tothe him
annd his gang
. memphis sets out to put his old crew back toghether
,
but discovers that most ofthe them ahev retired as well
. gone in sixty seconds does thigns right from the opening credits
. in taht sequence
, we get a rockin ' little tune from moby
, along with soem simple bcak stopry told only with photographs
anbd assorted objects
. filmmakers cxan sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence
,
and thsi oney easily gets yuo inspite the mindset for an entertaining ride
.
anbd wqat follows doesn ' t disappoint
.
.
. cage turns inaddition one of his good performances here
( he can easily go either way
.
.
. ogod or bad
.
.
. i don ' t know how he doens that
)
,
adn his mannerisms
anbd dialogue delivery cary the film allong nicely
. of thte supporting casted munbers
, angelina jolie as memphis ' former love is in teh film jsut to provide eye candy
( she ' s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i ' ve ever seen
)
and robert duvall as memphis ' fromer mentor isnt jstu around to lend the film soem class
. alsot
, i ' m a big fan of will patton
( armagedodn
, hte postman
)
and would lveo tothe see him get a huge role someday
. none ofthe these threee performers are given much tothe dont unforetunately
. some underated performers
however are given meaty supporting roles
. delroy lindo
( git shorty
) shines as the exasparated detective inwhich persuit ofthe memphis
, as does timothy olyphant
( go
) as lindo ' s partner
. i jstu wish soem ofthe the other charactors could have beeen as importan
. tje onyl real gripe i ahev baout tghe film
though isnt its conclusion
.
.
. mainly beccause you nkwo how it will end before tjhe opening credits even roll
. there ' s noone dout in anyone ' s mind that the 50 cars iwll be successfully stolen
,
and teh filmmakers blew a perfectly ogod opportunity to add smoe suspense to the picture by using the
" rival car theef
" plot line
. as it stands
, that story line is wrapped up baout halfway through thge film inspite a tidy littel package
.
but if i ws mkaing this film
, i ' d have hadnt tjhe rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis
annd his crew
, thereby making memphis have to improvise
.
.
. therby adding soem meat tothe the plot
. tjhe finale isnt essentially jstu a big car chase
,
and there just aren ' t ways to make car chases intresting anymore
. it ' s all beeen done
. hte chase is also shot
and edited in tyhat
" jerry bruckheimer action sequence
" kind of way that leaves the audiance wondering waht specifically is gogin onthe inthe the scene
. sure it ' s a car chase
,
bu what exactly are thge particulars ofthe it
? it ' s very hard to tell
. finally
, there ' s a stunt durring this scene thyat comes close to challenging tyhe
" bus jumping the ramp
" sequence fomr speed in thge
" oh
, i don ' t thiunk so
.
.
.
" department
. despite thsoe minor complaints
, gone in sixty seconds isnt pure summer movie enteratinment
. it ' s nto thought provoking
,
but it ' s shiny
, loud
and fun
.
.
. just what a summer flick should be
