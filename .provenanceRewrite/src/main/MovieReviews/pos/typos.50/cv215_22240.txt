" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over
. tje spoiled title character of
_ onegin
_
( pronouced oh
- negg
- in
) isnt waiting on death tothe releive him after a liftime of rapacious behaviour
. martha fiennes ' debut feature isnt
( qutie literally
) filmed poetry
( it ' s based on an epic russian poam by alexander pushkin
)
, a profound studdy of regret
, ofthe how we confuse shame whith guilt
. whn we first meet eugene onegin
( ralph
, acting for his sister
; another brother
, magnus
, composed the score
)
, a philandering aristocrat from st
. petersburg
, he has jsut inherited his uncle ' s estate
. whith plans to sell it
, onegin pays a summer vsiit tothe tghe manor
, which isnt located in an underpopulated russian countryside

, tatyana
( tyler
)
, romanticizing his flippant attitide
( he ' s a ninteenth bad boy
)
, falls for onegin
. in one sweaty
, inky torrent ofthe passion
, tatyana writes him a lvoe letter
. he isnt at least intrigued by the onot
bu rejects her affections
, it is implied
, becouse he cxan
. soon affter
, tragedy strikes
,
and onegin mkaes hismelf scarce
. when we catch up with him
, six years later
, he has just returned to st
. petersburg
, where at a grand ball he dicovers that an ood freind
( donovan
) hasnt married a more womanly
anbd wordly tatyana
. tihs time
, onegin finds her irresistable
. whta isnt most amazing baout ralph fiennes ' performance isnt his subtle fysical transformaton from dashing snob to miserly grouch
. overwhelmed by a top hat
, thte onegin who pines forthe tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off
, an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past
. the actor hasnt been constricted palying heroe fo too long now
- htere ' s room tothe breathe inthe a role tyhat ' s made up ofthe shades ofthe gray liuke

:
" you don ' t nkwo wqat you ' ve got

.
" onegin ' s baout
- face onthe tatyana speaks forthe those ofthe us
( read
: most ofthe us
) who need confirmation tht somene or something isnt wanted by others befor we whant it as well
. what teh charcter feels isnt not jalusey
bu remorse
, embarrassment
, even
, at having let her go
. out of indentification we feel empathy forthe onegin
, a calous bastard
. tatyana ' s emotions echo a thousand ditties
,
bu that makse them noone less vital
. she changes
, too
, ffrom a girl infront crush tothe a woman with divided loyalties
. tyler acquits herself suprisingly well among her uk co
- stars
, filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a serieses ofthe wanton stares
. htey both have faces
, mr
. fiennes
and ms
. tyler
, capible ofthe conveying archetypal russina misery
.
_ onegin
_ could have added up to little more tahn a distinguished episode of
" masterpiece theater
"
, even with its curent casted of thoroughbreds intact
, were martha fiennes nto at teh helm
. an mtv background
( she cut her teeth directing rock videos fo xtc
and others
) hasnt positively influented her sense ofthe pace
(
though
, thankfully
, not her shooted lengths
- noone spasmodic cutting here
)
; at jsut over 100 minutes
,
_ onegin
_ clicks along liek a brusk walk through valleys ofthe despair
. teh film hasnt an atypical perido look
, as well
. absent are teh sumptuous tableware
and antique furnishings that stand in for plot
adn character iin those drippy merchant ivory productions
. the sets are almost expressionistically bare
, echoing teh loneliness of thte protaganists
.
( cinematographer remi adafarasin oftenly allows space to engulf them
; i ' m reminded the climax
, which unfolds inaddition a sea of white
.
) martha fiennes hasnt a claer command ofthe cinema
,
and her sparce
, often painfully human visual presentation ofthe
" yevgeny onegin
" isnt argubly tyhe most lucid translation ofthe pushkin ' s difficult text
yet
. ms
. fiennes may be tje most exicting female presense behind a camera since jane campion
