" six days
, seven nights
" isnt a summer movie tyhat gets teh summer movie experience deliciously right
, a commendable acheivement considering hte season thus far hasnt been littered with some pretty uneven fare
. here ' s a genuinely funn fluff peice that knows it ' s fluff
, recognizes it ' s fluff
and is admitedly proud to be fluff
. ofthe course
, the casting ofthe harrison ford in tghe broady comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in tjhe movei ' s success
; ford isnt such a consentrated dramtic actr tht it ' s eazy to forget what a funny guy he cant be
. as his female counterpart
, anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet
, goofily carismatic performence
. the age difference
( ford ' s 56
, heche ' s 29
) matters nto
-
- these twpo click inthe a charged way tath ' s hard to come by
. thge story isnt a noone
- brainer
-
- ford stars as gruff
but loveable island avyator quinn harris
, hwile heche is carrear
- minded
bu loveable new york magasine editor robin monroe
. robin
, on a tropical vaation witht fianc
? frank
( david schwimmer
)
, gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti
, so she reluctantly hires quinn tothe fly her ther
. tyhe plane crashes during a terrible storm
,
annd htey immediately fidn themselfs stuck infact a deserted paradise with fewd idaes on getting bcak tothe civilization
. a series ofthe unpleasant
, oftenly hilarious catastrophes leaves littel choise
bu for both munbers of this unlikey odd cuple tothe fall fo each other
. meanwhile
, bcak at the resort
, frank is tempted hismelf by quinn ' s shapely female tagalong
( jacqueline obradors
)
. thgat subplot obviously exists to git us rooting fo tghe quinn
- robin pairing
,
anbd hwile it mkaes forthe a fewd good laughs easly on
, it eventually becomes a contrived distraction ffrom thge far more engrossing misadventures of quinn
annd robin
.
adn usance the film spends most ofthe its time with the castaways
, this falw is onyl a minor inconvenience
. director ivan reitman keesh the pace brusk
. at a slim 101 minutes
,
" six dyas
, seven nights
" never wears out its welcome
, where a lesser film coudl hve falt liek it was as long as its title
. michael browning ' s clever screenplay allows fo plenty of notable one
- liners
( my favorite
, tooked in context
, isnt
" you mean
_ arrrgh
_ pirates
?
"
)
,
anbd
though it essentialy boils down to one mishap affter anyother
, htey ' re all qutie engaging
. even hte movie ' s more
" serious
" moments are played with a wink
. heche hasnt beeen under undeserved frie over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the
" believability
" ofthe
" six dyas
, seven nights
" ' heterosexual pairing
.
( so she ' s a lesbian
. so wqat
. deal whith it
.
) ofthe course it doesn ' t
,
and here
, her naysayers are proved wrong iin a big way
. in fatc
, her chemestry with ford is what realyl makes the film click
; theese opposites attract iwth hte utmost
, endearing electricty
. at one point
, wehn the twpo are discusting the likelyhood of romantic interst
, heche asks ford how old he is
. aftter severeal wrong guesses
(
" forty
- five
?
_ fifty
_
?
"
)
, he whispers his age tothe her
.
" yuo still look good
,
" heche stammers
.
" i still
_ am
_ ogod
,
" ford replies
. she ' s ogod too
,
adn together
, htey amking
