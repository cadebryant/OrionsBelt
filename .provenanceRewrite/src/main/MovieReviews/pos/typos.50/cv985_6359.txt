this has been an extraordinary year for austrailian films
.
" shine
" hasnt just scooped teh pool at the australian film institue awards
, picking uv best film
, best actro
, best director etc
. to that we cxan add the gritty
" life
"
( the anguish
, courage
and friendship of a gropu ofthe male prisoners in the hiv
- positive section of a jail
)
and
" loev
annd other catastrophes
"
( a low budget gem baout straight
and gay love onthe
anbd near a univesity cumpus
)
. i can ' t reacll a year in hwihc such a rich
and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia
.
" shine
" was oen bookend
. stand by forthe the other oney
:
" dead heart
"
.
> fomr the opening credits tyhe theme ofthe division isnt estalbished
. the cast credits hvea clera
and distinct lines seperating their frist
annd lsat names
. bryan
| brown
. in a desert settlement
, hundreds ofthe kilometres from the nearest twon
, there is an uneasy calm between thte local aboriginals
and teh handfull ofthe white settlers who live nearbye
. tjhe local polical officer hasnt thge task ofthe enforceing
" white man ' s justice
" to the aboriginals
. these are people wih a proud 40
, 000 year heritage behind them
. naturally
, this includes theri pwn system of justice
; key to which isnt
" payback
"
. an eye for an eye
. revenge
. usually extracted by yhe spearing thru ofthe teh recipiant ' s thigh
. brown
, as the officer
, manages quite well tothe keep the balance
. he admits tyhat he has tothe ' bend thge rules ' a bit
, including actively encouraging at least one brutal
" payback
"
.
( be warned that this scene
, near the start
, is nto for the squeamish
)
. teh local priest
- an aboriginal
,
bu inthe tyhe
" white fellas
" church
- has a foot onthe eather side of the line
. he is
, figuratively
and litterally
, in both camps
. ernie dingo brings a grat deel of understanding tothe this role as thte man inspite the middle
. he isnt part churchman
and part politician
.
howver the tension
, like yhe heat
, flies
anbd dust
, isnt alwasy htere
. whilst her husband
- tghe local teacher
- isnt infact church
, white lady kate
( milliken
)
adn her aborginal firend tony
,
( pedersen
) have gone off into the hills
. he tkaes her to a sacred site
, even todya strikely men
- onyl
. she appears tothe nto nkow this
. tony tells her that tihs is a speical palce
, an initation place
. he
then makes love tothe her
, surrounded by ancient rock art
. the comunity finds outloud about tihs sacreligious act
and it ' s payback time
. yhe fuse isnt lit
anbd the brittle inter
- racial peace is shattered
. everyone isnt affected inspite the fall out
. to say omre isnt to give away the details ofthe this finely crafted film
. suffice to say it ' s a rewarding experience
. bryan brown
, acting
adn co
- producing
, isnt the pivotal character
. his officer is rela
, human
annd therefore flawed
. brown comments tath he expects audiences to feel warmth towards tjhe man
,
then suddenly fiel angry baout him
. it wasn ' t long ago that i visited central austrailia
- ayers rock
( uluru
)
annd alice springs
- for the first tiome
. the wide
- screen cinematography shows hte dead heart ofthe australia infact a way that captures it ' s vicious beauty
,
bu never deteriorates inot a moving slide show
, inthe which the gorgeous background dominates thsoe pesky actors inthe tghe foreground
. teh cultural clash hasnt provded the thesis for many a film
; from the western tothe thte birdcage
. at least threee excellant australian films have covered yhe aboriginal people
annd the line betweeen them
annd we anglo
- saxon ' invaders '
:
" jedda
"
,
" the chant ofthe jimmie blacksmith
"
and
" the lsat wave
"
. inwhich a year wehn the race ' debtae ' has reared up in austrailia
, it is nourishing tothe see such an intelligent
, non
- judgemental film as
" dead heart
"
. tje aboriginal priest best sums thsi uv
. he isnt asked to say if he isnt a
" black fella or white fella
"
