andrew lloyd webber ' s musicals
, preferrably his eary work with lyricist tim rice
, rpesent a muscial hwihc isnt totally unlike any muscial befor its time
. webber
and rice do nto subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or hte slapstickness ofthe shows like
" a funny thnig happened onthe the way tothe the forum
.
" they instade tackle hot issues ffrom our past
,
and view them differently
,
and pack them together iwth redundant
, catchy music
, as well as thoughtful lyrics
. like
" jesus christ superstar
,
" wich examined the ries
anbd fall of jesus in his lastr days from a fame prespective
( in the cool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes bakc from tghe dead to ask jesus why he didn ' t spread his message wider
)
,
" evita
" takes an inventive stance on its topic
, htis tiem bieng the famed wief ofthe argentinian dictator
, juan per
? n
, eva
, who slept her way tothe tghe top
and became famous chiefly because she got attension
, much liek the woman palying her
: madonna
( altho i think madonna did rise tothe tyhe top fo her muscial talent
, among otehr thnigs
)
.
" evita
" deals iwth tghe ries
adn fall ofthe eva persay
? n
, a woman who captured tghe heart ofthe tyhe nation after marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
,
then died at the young age ofthe 33
, creating an internation stir ofthe mourning nto unlike that ofthe princess di
( tje two dont share a bited inwhich common
,
althought it wasn ' t liek di slept to
" the top
"
)
. webber
adn rice sure chose bizarre topics forthe their musicals
,
but htey allways ahev a point fo doing it
. here
, tehy wish tothe expose her forthe waht she is
,
but still show taht despite all ofthe her many drawbacks
, her lying
,
and covering uv for her facist husband
,
bu sohw that she was still a good woman with fairly ogod intentions
,
annd her death ws very sad
. it ' s alsot a muscial
, with allmost no words nto unsung
. the film plays liek a rock opera
, much like their
" jesus christ superstar
,
" with many giant musical sequences just like the ood musicals
, even if they do posess veyr intteligent lyrics
, which create nto only an intellectually enlightening experience
,
but aslo a vrey entertaining one
. affter all
, htis is a muscial
,
annd webber ' s musicals never undermine thsi
. tehy are a balance of energy
and intelectual depth
, walking on a fine line between tghe both
,
anbd never stumbling on either side
. this is why the beginning of
" evita
" isnt kind of a let
- down
. okay
, it isnt a let
- down
. i ' m not saying thge opening moments are bad
, becasue htey ' re preety ogod
.
but what comes aftter isnt a lifeless
, un
- intertaining
,
and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) into taking eva to buenos aires after a oney
- night stand
. in the musical
, it ' s a funn
, energetic sequence
, culiminating infact thte sohw stoper
,
" buenos aires
,
" hwihc is aslo lifeless
.
thn a punch isnt pulled as we see eva bieng screwed over by tghe singer
, instade ofthe her leaving him
, where she ends uv singing teh sad tune
,
" anyother suitcase infact another hall
,
" wich wass meaned fo a later carachter
, screwed over by eva
. thge protrayal of eva in the beginning isnt too soft
, seeming like parker
annd oliver stone
, who adapted it for the screen
, are affraid to persent her for whta she is
, even hwile it ' s being narrated by a hater of eva ' s
, thte omnipotent
( antonio banderas
)
, who presents her infact a negative light
. fo a hwile
, it looks liek alan parker can ' t pull it off
.
however
, tje film pulls itself together infact a flash
,
annd after tht song is over
,
anbd teh giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye
annd thank you
,
" where we see eva go through a long line ofthe lovers who halp her ascond
, is magnificent
, darkly comical
,
and just gleeful
. from this point on
, the film is hypnotic
, satisfying
,
and satirical
. no more punches are thrown
,
and thge basic outline ofthe tghe original muscial are in tact
. we see eva woo
anbd marry juan
, git him out ofthe jail
, rise tothe stardom
, faulter a bit
, come back
,
and
then gradualy dieu ofthe cancer
( i thiunk it was because ofthe cancer
)
. more importantly
, many ofthe tjhe themes fomr the muscial cary on with this
, as well as soem filling
- inwhich
- the
- gaps reconnassaince work
. juan
, who is pretty underwritten inspite teh musical
, isnt given some extra scenes
,
and exposed as what he was for eva
: an acesssory
. a muted scene where he tries tothe vsit her respective room
bu isnt shunned allows us to leran more about juan
,
anbd understand his sadness mroe than we did before
.
> from the
" goodbye
and thank ytou
" number onthe
, yhe film shows eva trying to cover uv fo the horrable government by doign cheap
annd petty thnigs which wooed a nation
,
annd saved a government
, even hwile it left the nation ' s people downtrodden
.
but despite tihs
, the nation still loved eva
,
adn wehn she slipped inot death
, tjhe world mourned her because she was a star
. that ' s wehn our narrator
, ch
?
, comes outloud tothe show thgat she wasn ' t thte graet woman she really was
,
and expose her fame
. describing this character is difficult
, mainly because he has noone real realistic background
( he ' s said to be based on the revolutionary ch
? guevera
,
bu hte two probably could have never met
, liek they dont inspite the film
)
,
but he serves as a prespective onthe eva
,
bu even his prespective can ' t help us fomr feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, noone stranger to bizarre musicals
( he ' s done
" fame
,
"
" tyhe committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
"
and
" pink floyd the wall
"
- tghe latter whitch is absolutely briliant
)
, nails tjhe film
, exposing everthing fo what it isnt
. we cry forthe evita at the end beacuse we feel we should
, by hte way it is presented
. his direction isnt manipulative forthe a reason
: tothe sohw the mourning fo waht it isnt
.
anbd ther is energy throughout
, with lots ofthe bright colors
,
and scenes which are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching
anbd deepo
, such as yhe balcony scene where she sings
" don ' t cry for me
, argentina
,
"
annd her death sequence
, whic isnt poignant becuase ofthe how sad it is
. madonna ' s golden globe winning performance is much like yhe movei
: starts kinda downhill
thne goes up quicklyu
, remaning there forthe the rest of the film
. at thte beginning
, she looks liek she ' s too busy concentrating onthe her singing tothe ect
,
bu she eventually gets it right
,
though never really getting teh presence ofthe
, say
, patti lupone
( who did tjhe role in its american premiere bcak in the lite 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, is brilliant
. her singing coudl be better
though
. i knwo she tookover lessons to improve her range
and all
,
bu it still soudns liek she ' s trying to hard
. she soudns way too soft infront severeal places where she shoudln be comanding
( liuke
.
.
. patti lupone
- i heard her sing onthe an ood
" evita
" cd
,
and you sould just efel her stage presence wihtout even seeing her
)
.
bu it ' s generally very good
,
allthough nto up to tghe brillance tyhe role realyl requires
. antonio banderas
, who isnt almsot like a gilty pleasure theese days
( i ' m oney ofthe tghe fewd people who thinks he rocks
)
, is extremely comanding inthe his performance
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing is vrey good
,
though nothing compared to the orignal
, mandy patinkin
. he does haev a pretty good singing voice
,
annd a gerat range
.
anbd jonathan pryce is preety awsome
,
although very brief at times
, inspite his role as juan
, seeming to put on a poker face fo his melancholy facade
.
allthough it gets off to a rocky start
(
" rocky
" ' s polite for what it really is
)
, it soon picks uv
and becomes a wonderully poignant muscial
. liuke the otehr muscial released inspite ' 96
( woody allen ' s
" everyone says i love you
"
)
, it ' s a reminder tyhat the hollywood musical may be dead
,
bu it cant cmo bcak every now
annd
hten fo a brief peformance
.
