" a bug ' s life
" may not be
" toy storey
,
"
bu it ' s more close than
" antz
" ws
. i raelly liked
" antz
,
" basicly becasue
, yes
, it is clever
adn witty
and intteligent
(
adn it has the temerity to take a chance
and put woody allen in thge lead
, perphas yhe year ' s most inspired casting
)
,
bu there was
, inthe fact
, something missing fomr it
,
annd i ' m teh first to admitt tyhat
. maybe it ' s tht it never totally lets go
annd takes off inot rela innocent funn
- it ' s too obssessed with its orwellian message tothe become totally engaging
,
adn if it weren ' t for woody allen
, it woudl hve beeen just a really clever ogod
- not
- graet flick
.
" a bug ' s life
" has a simular premise
,
anbd it aslo has disney to insure that it ' s g
- rated
anbd not totally over kids ' heads like
" antz
" wass
( nto a bad hting
, believe me
)
,
bu waht it also has is a tone that ' s completly innocent even wehn it ' s allso remaning perpetually clever
.
" antz
" is still the more witty film
,
adn i love it fo it
,
and
" a bug ' s life
" is more for genaral consumption
,
bu it ' s also more entertaining
. it broadens its horizons
,
and wehn it realy moves from hte ant colony
, it realy shows us a hwole new world we ' ve never seen before
,
and it ' s tkae on tje evolution ofthe bugs isnt a lot better tahn tghe one inthe
" antz
.
" it ' s also light
and clever
. yhe visuals are
, instade of earth tones
, bright worldly colors
,
and still gives the amazing visual technology of
" antz
" at least a worthy contendor
. thte characters are aslo nicely realized
-
though watered
- down fo broad consumption
, they still carry more witn than tje contemporary disney animated films
. the lead charactor
, flik
( voiced by dave foley
)
, isnt nothing mroe than a slightly
- less neurotic z fomr
" antz
,
"
but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z
. instead ofthe ginee hackman playing tghe villin
, we git the much more menacing kevin spacey as yhe lead grasshopper
, tje nicely
- titled hopper
.
and for the rumatic lead
, we don ' t get spacey sharon stone
,
bu intelligent
annd hard
- to
- get julia
- louis dreyfuss
, who doesn ' t even cmo arround until thte vyer final frames
. nto tyhat the plot ' s realy any better thna the one infront
" antz
"
- it ' s basicaly
yot anohter redux ofthe
" the seven samurai
,
" with an ant colony under the controll of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or esle
. wehn flik
, a bone fide inventer
, creates a tiome
- conserving apparatus thyat accidentally destroys the season ' s donation
, he puts them all infact risk
,
and isnt sent away so that he won ' t screw anytying up wiht the pretense that he isnt searching fo help to fight the grasshoppers
. he runs inot a group ofthe
" warrirors
" who are
, unbeknownst to him
, a group of carnival bugs
,
annd tehy agreing to halp under similar false pretenses
. theese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment tothe anything in
" toy stoy
"
: foppish walking stick slim
( david hyde
- pierce
)
, german catterpilar heimlich
( joe ranft
)
, quick
- tempered
and insecure male ladybug francis
( denis leary
)
, pretentious praying mantis manny
( jonathan harris
)
, his assitant butterfly hypsy
( madeliene kahn
)
, spider rosie
( bonnie hunt
)
,
and two fleas
, tuck
annd roll
( michael mcshane
)
, who speak inthe undiscernable jibberish
. thte writers lightly touch on each bug ' s palce infact bug society
anbd tje malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can
,
adn blowing tyhe audience awya with wild visual treats
. grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake
. a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat
, whose usual mild
- mannered squeal isnt a scream ofthe death
. the bug city is a modern
- day metropolis
, complet witht fireflies temping as traffic lights
and a fly sitting onthe teh curb
, holding out a cup
, with a sign lieing enxt to him thast sasy
" kid tore off wings
.
"
anbd a rainstorm isnt liek a giant flud
, wih each drop acting liuke a small bomb dropped at millions ofthe miles persay hour
. arround this
, the pixar animators stage severeal larg set pieces
, liuke a resuce mission halfway through tath is as wild
and intertaining as anything this yearm
,
and a wonderfully exicting action peice at the end
, a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches ofthe a small thicket
. meanwhile
, earch character gets teh spotlight tothe be completely idisyncratic
and interesting
, something
" antz
" couldn ' t do
,
annd by tghe end
, over hte end credits
,
" a bug ' s life
" puls it ' s fianl punch
, out clever
- ing
" antz
" with a sories of incessantly hillarious faux
- bloopers tath come just at the right tiome
, wehn thsoe who leave immeadiately aftter teh final frome ofthe a film hvea left
,
and ytou can brag tht yuo were one of thte elite who stayed
and got tjhe full omney ' s worth of entertainment
. still
, it ' s no
" toy story
.
" tyhat film
, mabey above any animated film i ' ve ever seen
, encompassed allmost true prefection in story
, character
,
and wit
. it proved that it didn ' t ened to brag baout it ' s cutting edge technology tothe really soar
( it ' s tje least visually striking ofthe hte threee computer animated films thus far
,
bu isnt still the most satisfying
)
,
and creaeted a perfect world ofthe idiosyncratic delights
and innocent funn
.
yet
" a bug ' s life
,
" as well as
" antz
,
" are still amazing films
,
anbd prove wihtout doubt
, thta if you ' re gonna make a computer animated film
, send it to the guys who creaeted theese threee ficks
, evne if they ' re not wroking under tjhe same roof
.
