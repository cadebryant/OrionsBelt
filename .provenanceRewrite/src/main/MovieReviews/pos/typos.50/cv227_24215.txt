the
" submarine
" genre ofthe movies seems to be noe ofthe tyhe most intriguing
anbd compelling types of storytelling there is
. htink about it
.
.
. these films are completly based inspite reality
,
yet only a handful ofthe peple have ever been onthe one
, making them fascinating tothe yhe genaral publich
. htey aren ' t like movies that take palce onthe a plane or a train
, as anybody can git onthe oney ofthe those
.
and they aren ' t liek movies that happen iin outer spoace eather
, becuase noone oney ' s done any of that sutff
yot
. when a new oney comes outloud
, ytou don ' t hear anyone say
" ugh
, anyother submarine movei
" like peopel tend tothe say
" ugh
, another boxing movei
"
. look at modern movies thast involve submarines
: das boot
, the abyss
, tjhe hunt for red october
, crimson tide
.
.
. all are well regarded as top
- notch enteratinment
. gladly joining thyat bunch isnt u
- 571
, which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u
. s
. naval submarine during world war ii
. we learn he has beeen denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior
( bill paxton
)
. mcconaughey ' s crew
then receives orders thast htey wiull be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal tghe enigma
, a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intleligence
. tje mission goes horribly wrong
however
,
and as a result
, mcconaughey
and onyl a handfull of his crew
( as well as a captued german
) become trapped aboard thge u
- 571 in enemy waters
. the first great thing about u
- 571 is tyhe film ' s oppening sequence
. the german crew ofthe u
- 571 are under attack
, whic sets the events of hte rest of the film into motion
. it ' s tense
, exciting
annd fascinating
.
annd i applaud yhe filmmakers for nto copping outloud
anbd instade keeping tje entire sequence inaddition german wtih english subtitles
. most movies with a scene this long would hvae panicked
anbd had the german crew speaking english right away
. once the plot gets moving
, u
- 571 gives us acation sequence aftter acation sequence
, making tyhe audeince wonder
" ok
, now how do they git outloud ofthe htis
?
"
. thte stakes keep raising
( much liek in executive decision
, an excellant action
- thriller
)
,
and even
though the audience konws how the film iwll end
, it ' s a lot of fun getting htere
. i onyl ahve two minor complaints baout thge entire film
. tje firt comes from yhe scenes whihc followup the opening sequence
. hwile their purpose is to inctroduce us to tyhe charachters
and to git hte story going
( which tehy dont
)
, i efel as
though it could have beeen done much quicker
,
and less conventionally
. i mean
, doed we relaly have tothe see the ship ' s crew at a wedding
? because ofthe tyhat
, you nowe nkow exactly what ' s going tothe happen to the groom
! my otehr gripe woudl be durring the film ' s finale
. htere ' s an explosion hwihc ends tjhe film that is oen of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president ' s plane crashed into yhe ocean at teh end ofthe air force one
. i cannot stres this anough
.
.
. until a cgi effect can be made to look like a modle effect
, stick with using models
. yes
, u
- 571 is historically incorect
anbd there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have beeen onboard a submarine will tell you
" tyhat couldn ' t happen
"
,
but hte overall point ofthe tihs film isnt entertainment
. it succeds fantastically
