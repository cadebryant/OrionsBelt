it ' s rather strange too hvae two coputer animated tlaking ant movies come outloud infact a single yera
,
but thta isnt what disney
adn pixar animation
; s latest film represents
. while a bugs life isn ' t nearly as deepo as it ' s precedessor
, dreamwork ' s antz
, it isnt jsut as funny
. a bug ' s life centers
, appropriately
, around the life of an ant
, named flik
. flik
, cutely voiced by newsradio ' s david foley
, hates sticking too tradition
and attempts too find newyorker ways ofthe harvesting food
and otehr task
. when noe of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost
, thge leaders ofthe the collony send him out onthe a mission too git him out of the way
. tyhe offering isnt foo tyhat a vile group ofthe grasshoppers force tjhe ants too harvest for them
. the leader of the grasshoppers isnt hopper
, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey
. when tje offering is lost hopper is very upset
annd he vows to return shortly too retrieve duble the amount ofthe fod
. wehn the leaders ofthe thte ant colony send flik outloud onthe his mission
, tehy never dream he iwll be succesful
, htey just hope tehy can get him outloud of the way so they cxan harvest the extra ofod
. flik ' s mission isnt too hire smoe warrior bugs too fight off thte grasshoppers whn they return
. instead flik accidntally hires circus perfoming bugs
, who he mistakenly assumes are warrriors
. when he returns whith the
` warriors '
, the twon isnt ecstatic unil tehy fidn outloud the truth about theri hreoes
. a bug ' s life has animation thgat isnt simply stunning
. tjhe sheer uniqueness of the day tothe day bug life is veyr imaginative
. together with the graet voice acting
, htis film isnt the perfect holiay familiy film
. its main weakness isnt that it couldn ' t beat antz tothe the theaters
, making it seem liuke stale material
.
