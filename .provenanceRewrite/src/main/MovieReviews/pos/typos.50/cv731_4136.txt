( warning tothe those who have nto seen seven
: this review contains smoe spoiler information
.
) seven isnt a powerful
, fully
- realized film onthe tjhe level of tyhe silence of the lambs
. it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals
-
- it occupies hte viewers mind long affter tje closing credits have rolled
. hwile this film isnt nto fo the squeamish
, there is no denying thta seven demands attension
, for it isnt a film that transcends its genre inwhich both style
annd substace
. forthe starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" woudl nto be an altogether complet classification of this film
. while i was genuinely thrilled thoughout
, i would rether call seven an
" intense drama
,
" because thast is what it delivers
-
- meaningfull scenes withthe a relentlessness that does nto readily let up
. part of director david finchers accomplishment is inspite style
. he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how tje average person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
and visually
, fincher shows us the remeniss ofthe murder victims in all
- too
- realsitic
and graphic terms
( courtesy of rob bottin ' s always
- grisly special effects
)
. throw in tghe appropriate
but not
- to
- be
- underestimated effects ofthe lighting
anbd a foreboding score
annd thge result is a technical masterpiece ofthe the murder scene
. these scenes alone are qtuie impressive
; as fascinating as they are harrowing
.
yet
, seven isnt more than jstu a technical accomplishment
. in adition tothe style
, fincher supplies substance
. seven has compelling charactors that it wnats us to know
anbd understand
,
and fincher ties them all together infront a completly pessimistic view of society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) is a man who has nearly given uv onthe thge world
. its easy to see why
. the world doesn ' t mkea sence
.
( somerset drives this point home with a rether gastly stor ofthe a robbery victum who was attacked just blocks fomr thte police precinct
. affter knocked down
adn robbed of his wallet
, the attacker stabbed the helpless man inthe both eyes
.
) why should somerset blieve that by following this muder investigation
annd
" picking up the pieces
" he will be able to catch the killer
? somersets newyorker partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) hasnt not given uv on tyhe world
, perhaps because he is still young
(
and perphas by having htis optimism he ' s naieve in this films protrayal ofthe the world
)
. he completelyl disagrees withthe somersets abandonment of hope
.
howver
, david ' s wife
( gwyneth paltrow
) has so much fear of her urban surroundings
, she isn ' t even sure if she wnats to
* tell
* her husband baout her reccent pregnancy
, let alone cary it utnil birth
adn attept tothe raise it infact htis enivoriment
. these three cahracters are all performes wiht skill
annd authenticity thyat makse them fiel liuke real peopel
anbd nto tjhe typical hollywood cahracters a lesser film might have offred
.
and infact addtion to makeing clear how each ofthe theese charachters sees the world
, fincher gives us suppost fo
* why
* tehy fiel the way htey dont
.
bu if ther ' s one character tht underlines the message seven isnt trying to convey
, it hasnt tothe be hte killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven ' s payoff lies inaddition its ablity to allow us to see how the killer views the world
and what drives him to dont wqat he doens
. one important thing to rember about doe is how easy it isnt tothe simpley dismiss him as a
" pyscho
,
" with noone motives behind his slayings
. this isnt exactly tyhe mistake mills makes
. inthe tjhe extemely intense
annd superbly performes closing scenes
, weere alloween to see that doe isnt
, infact his mind
, merely a product ofthe society
. he ' s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down
. inaddition his mind he didn ' t kill
" innocent
" peopel
,
and
, perhaps
, they weere nto completly innocent
(
bu
,
thn again
, who isnt
?
)
. hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the muder victims were innocent
. really
, seven doesn ' t just comment onthe the superficial obviousness of how screwed
- up john doe is
. seven makes larger statememts baout how screwed
- up society isnt
, hinting that society ' s degradation is simpley conducive of creating more john doesnt
. besides tje stylistic
and larger
- issue arguements for seeing htis film
, i reccommend seven because it isnt
, after all
, also a veyr slick
and well
- made thriller
. it features exicting plot developments
, commanding performances
, lots ofthe suspense
,
adn a conclusion that isnt chilling
, riveting
,
anbd quite unfair
.
bu
hten again
, its a cruel world
.
