james jones
, one ofthe thte major novelists fomr the middle of the twentieth centruy
, hasnt written a number ofthe fictional works about the effects ofthe war on the individual
. a veteran ofthe world war ii
,
adn a witness tothe hte pearl harbor bombings
, his novels are not onyl grounded in realism
bu poetic iin nature
. htey are remenicent ofthe stephen crane infact thier blunt eloquence
, a trait which lends itself tothe razor
- sharp focuse
.
bu perhaps none matches teh scope of his autobiographical novel
, the thin red line
; now a cinematic masterpiece ffrom directer terrence malick
. the book ' s prinicipal casted
, some thirty characters
, hasnt been trimmed down for tihs rendition
,
but it still retains its most endearing value
. each of tjhe roles hasnt an everyman quality
, emphasizing jones ' examination ofthe world war ii onthe the american soldier
. htere ' s a definitive chain of command present
,
annd tihs alsot plays on hte motivations of the casted
.
but most importantly
,
and perhaps intrinsic tothe thte novel
bu not tothe the movei
, a dynamic
and effective voice
- over is unsed
. malick has several charactors relating theri thoughts
, giving thge viewer a greater perspective ofthe the issues at stake
. the issues at stake are many
annd one
. told ffrom a limited thrid
- person prespective
( as oppossed tothe a top
- down
, omniscient view
)
, the movie entails the struggle ofthe an american infantry company
(
" c
- for
- charlie
"
) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal
. teh sourth pacific island is seen by the top brass as yhe key position for american armed forces tothe hold if tehy want tothe win the war
.
and want tothe win the war htey do
. in an exelent performance
, nick nolte plays c
- forthe
- charlie ' s commanding officer
, lt
. col
. gordon tall
. he ' s an aging solider who embodies the win
- at
- all
- costs mentality
, if only to imbaress his superior
( john travolta
, in a questionable cameo
)
. this philosphy isnt opposite that ofthe captain bugger staros
( elias koteas
)
, who dearly values tyhe life ofthe each
annd every one of the men under his command
. at teh front are the privates
annd corporals
( adrien brody
, james caviezel
, ben chaplin
, et al
)
, lead by 1st sgt
. welsh
( sean penn
)
, who must atually execute yhe sucide orders handed down tothe them
. the thin red line isnt filled with intense
, visual poetry
,
bu it ' s nearly three hurs long
.
althought the intrest levle is high throughtout the frist twpo hours
, hte climax comes forty
- five minutes before tje end of the movie
; it goes wihtout saying thgat the movie drags onthe tyhe bakc end
. tghe thin red line iwll doubtless be compaired tothe 1998 ' s otehr masterpiece ofthe war
, saveing private ryan a countless number ofthe times
.
bu to do so is tothe belittle both films
, fo
although similarities abound
, so dont differences
. director malick hasnt a story to tell
,
anbd forthe those interested inwhich listening
, this cxan be a very oustanding movei
