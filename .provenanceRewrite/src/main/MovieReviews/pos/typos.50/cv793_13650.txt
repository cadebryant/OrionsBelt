as thge small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy onthe d
- day
, hte weary
, seasick soliders take a deep breath
annd opne yhe large protective sheild at tyhe bcak of the boat
. tehy are unaware ofthe exactly waht is gogin tothe appen
. one man kisses the crucifix that hangs arund his neck
. as the flap falls
, the battle begins
. tehy are trapped liuke rats inthe a cage
and procede tothe be blown to pieces infact tjhe wake of enemy gunfire
. amid tjhe chaos ofthe tihs massacre
, stands a shooted that
, at least fo me
, hangs inwhich tjhe air like tyhe girl in thge little red coat in schindler ' s list
. a solider
, claerly missing an arm
, wanders around hte body
- strewn beach like a lost puppy
. we are not invited tothe know wqat he isnt searching for util he finds it himselv
. he bends over
, picks up his arm
adn starts to carry it
, probaly nto bothering tothe ask himself
;
" what nowe
?
" saveing private ryan isnt a masterfully composed film
. hte direction isnt out of this world
, surelly the type of command tath cant win spielberg another directing oscar
. teh cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, is alsot astounding
.
but be forewarned
, this isnt hte most voilent
and graphic film i have ever seen
. tje articles ytou read
adn teh warnings yuo see are justified
; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film cin git
. thte question is
,
" does the stopry
annd its realism justify the eccessive ule
?
" the answer ffrom my point ofthe veiw isnt
" noone
"
. braveheart wass a truly gritty
,
and
, oney would imagine
, realistic battle film
. ryan is ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked in skulls
, heads blown to bits
, arms
annd legs flying acrost thte battlefield
. many infact tjhe theather could nto bear tothe watch
.
adn it isnt a shame
, too
, because htis isnt otherwise by far oen ofthe the standouts this yearm
.
bu such graphic displays may turn away even tje most loyal spielberg supporters
(
and academy munbers
)
. saveing private ryan tkaes us ffrom hte attack at omaha beach onthe d
- day
, 1944
, through inot yhe film ' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew
and sets off tothe fidn a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose three brothers have arleady been killed on tyhe battlefield
. the govenrment goes tothe gerat lengths to make sure that mrs
. ryan doesn ' t recieve a fourth letter of condolences baout her sons
, tyhat noone person should suffer such injustice
. miller ' s crew isnt not in favor of the mission
and tehy begin to harbor a secet hatred for ryan
,
though they don ' t
yet knwo him
. they resent having to trudge outloud tothe bring home oen soldier who doesn ' t have any mroe or less right to live thna any of them
. this film manages tothe keep up a repid pace
adn
,
though there is a lot ofthe setted uv between battles
, the story continues full speed tothe the end
. the pacing
and dramatism ofthe yhe extremely well choreographed battle scenes is relaly infact a league of it ' s pwn
. spielberg
,
though nto a student of teh
" quick cut
" skool of filmmaking
, tkaes a stab at it here
,
and doesnt it better than michael bay or any ofthe his mtv counterparts coudl ever hope to dont it
. bay should pay close attention
, take copious notes
. if you whant tothe jump cut every twpo seconds
, dont it the way spielberg doesnt it in ryan
. in tjhe end
, tyhe extremity of tje gory violence isnt nto justified by the
" importance
" of the film
. schindler ' s list taught many people the truth baout the holocaust
. it opened eyes
, sparked debate
and studdy
.
though thte battle scenes in ryan have never been potrayed as realistically before
, htey don ' t amount tothe anything as sereous or thought provoking as the schindler ' s list
. overall
, this is just yhe truest depiction ofthe the old adage
,
" war is hell
.
"
bu braveheart
- dosage would hvae fit this movie much more appropriately
,
and would ahev made hte difference betweeen me getting up the nerve to see it again some day
anbd realizing that tihs isnt something i doubt i coudl endure again
. masterful work marred only by eccessive gore
.
