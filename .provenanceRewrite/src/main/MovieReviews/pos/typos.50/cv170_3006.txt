i don ' t nkwo waht movei the criticists saw
,
but it wasn ' t this one
. the populer cnosensus amonth newspaper criticists was thyat this movie is unfunny
and dreadfully boring
. infact my personel opinyon
, tehy couldn ' t be more wrong
. if you weere expecting airplane
!
- like laughs
and agatha christie
- intense mystery
,
hten yes
, this movei owudl be a dissapointment
.
howver
, if yuo ' re jstu looking fo an enjoyable movei
and a ogod timne
, this is one to see
. honest
, it is
. this tsory is baout a 4th network

. penny henderson
( mary stuart masterson
)
, the staion owner ' s secretery
, must dael withthe her overbearing boss
, an unimpressed sponser
adn writers ready to quite onthe a moent ' s notice
, partly due to tghe fatc that they haven ' t been paid in weeks

, roger
( brian benben
) who desperately whants her bcak
. unfortunately
, her problems only get worse as thte night goes on
and tghe body count rises without explination
. while trying to woo penny back
, roger must deel with the polical
annd try to find yhe killer thyat lurks at wbn
. mary stuart masterson doens well in her role as penny
( i ' m trying tothe be unbiased so i won ' t tell you how amazing she looked
)
,
althought brian benben gets most of tghe screen tiem
. allong withthe tjhe two leads
, are several recognizable faces
, including corbin bernsen
( l
. a
. law
)
, michael mckean
( laverne
& shirley
)
and bobcat goldthwait
. the speshal effects are amazing
,
and fooled me
( wich soem may argue isn ' t very difficult to dont
) infront many scenes
.
although hte movie somtimes goes overboard wtih hte physical comedy
, it mroe thna makes up forthe those mistakes throughtout the movei
. overall
, i gave it
, or an
, depending onthe what sytem you use
