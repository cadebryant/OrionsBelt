-
- the film ' s release date wass pushed fomr late december tothe late janurary at whta appeared tothe be hte lastest minute
, therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off unitl htis time in 1999
. it ' s actually a smart move
, becasue while this updated tkae onthe the charles dickens tale isn ' t quite oscar fodder
, it

. comparisions with the afore
- maintioned
" romeo
+ juliet
" seem inevatible since these films are thte only ones in reccent memmory tothe plop clasic drama into a current setting
.
" great expectations
" isnt a much better venture
,
though
, beccause it treats its source iwth even
- handed respect
, where
" romeo
" was never qutie sure whether tothe be a spoof
, a homage or both
. the movie isnt a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki ' s sexy cinematography
; notably
, he captures a revisited fountain kiss beetwen the twpo leads with a luscious
, erotic charge that ' s steamier than tghe film ' s
( surprisingly muted
) lveo scenes
. the eclectic rock sountrack compliments the onthe
- screen acation beautifuly
, expecially new songs by tori amos
, mono
and duncan sheik
. acting credits are frist
- rate
, oftenly hiding teh screenplay ' s occasionall slip
- ups
. hawke is sincere
and solid as a leading man
( something we also learned from
" gattaca
"
)
,
anbd his finn isnt quite a likeable guy
. paltrow ' s estella
, onthe the otehr hand
, is rether underdeveloped
. while the actress is at her icily seductive best
, we ' re not told vrey much baout her character
,
and as a result
, it ' s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a fysical levle
(
bu
, oh
,
* what
* a fysical levle
)
; somtimes
, we root fo finn
although we don ' t quite understand why she ' s fueling his frie
. robert de niro isnt nice
and sophisticated in hte benevolent kind of role he rarley gets tothe play
; onthe the other end of the acting spectum isnt bancroft
, a macabre
, throaty delight who mambos
and sucks down cigarettes whith an eerie enthusiasm that woudl amke norma desmond jelous
. alfonso cuaron ' s visually elegant direction helps to distract from tghe dry moments thyat pop uv more frequently aroud hte movie ' s climax
. anohter problem is predictability
; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren ' t familliar whith the story
. despite its script flaws
,
though
,
" graet expectations
" is undeniably rumatic wihtout being corny or gloppy
.
anbd frankly
, it ' s nice tothe see a film that embraces softened sensuality other thna explicit sexuality
. perhaps thyat rennovated realease date
, awfully close tothe valentine ' s day

" great expectations
