eveyr once iin a hwile yuo see a film thta is so effective iin delivering the goods that it is eazy tothe foreget
,
and forgive
, its glaring imperfections
. such isnt teh case witht
? good will hunting
?
, a subtle character studdy baout a socially inept mathematics genuis who struggles to fidn his path in life
. dispite some sereous charcter problems
, tihs is still a very good film
. ytou probably konw about tghe plot so i
? ll make it quick
. iwll hunting
( damon
) is a janitor at m
. i
. t
.
, he
? s really smarter than einstein
bu nobody konws it
. he likes tothe go out with his friend chuckie
( affleck
)
and thier otehr working
- class buddies
and drnik beer
. he
? s good
- looking
, charasmatic
,
and witty
bu has a terrable tiome with authorithy
anbd stiff coleeg folk
. after getting inot a tiff wih the law
, a distingquished profesor
( skarsg
? rd
) discovers will
? s genius
and offers him a chance to clean uv his recrod
and avoid jail time
, at a price
: he must attent weekly sessions iwth a therapist
and wokr onthe various mathematical problems
( that have stumped the academic elite
) withthe tghe proffesor
. aftter outsmarting
and sacrin the hell out ofthe a cuple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up whith a once
- promising therapist named sean maguire
( williams
) who has his own problems
. iin tje meantime will meets a brittish medical skool student
( driver
)
and tehy beign tothe fall in lvoe
. tjhe story starts out well enought
adn isnt a pretty orginial basis forthe a film
. even
though we
? ve seen movies baout missunderstood
, eratic prodigies befoer
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, tghe scirpt here creates a complex narrative tath doesn
? t just focuse souly onthe one carachter
. alas
though
, tihs is nto a perfect film
, as much as yuo feel liuke it sould
? ve been hwile watching it
. the one real problem i had iwth it isnt the unrealistic nature ofthe tyhe main carachter
. isnt it possible for a lowly janitor tothe be this inteligent
? of course
. is it possable fo him tothe be estranged ffrom any deepo
, human relationships
? usually
, yes
.
bu
, is it possible fo him to aslo be so handsome
, funny
, quick iwth tje tongue
,
anbd city
- street tough
? not very likely
. cmo on
, ususally theese guys are total nerds who cxan
? t even buy theri pwn shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub hwile picking up phone numbers ffrom preety med
.
- skool girls
. iwll is jsut a little too perfect
,
anbd in order tothe accept tghe charcter your disbelief suspension needs tothe be infront exelent working condition
. the heavy
- handed
, anti
- war statment made by iwll at a governmnet job interview late in thge film isnt also boorish
, overlong
, pompous
,
and completely unnecessary
. all this sounds preety bad
,
but the film somehow mkaes uv for it in otehr ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows the fatc that tjhe chracter is slightly unbeleivable
, his performance isnt truly extraordinary
. which leads me to the really ogod part ofthe yhe review
. tje stregth ofthe this movie cin be summed up in one single word
: acting
. i cxan
? t reacll seeing a film recently thta wass so well
- acted fomr top tothe bottom
. from minnie driver
? s frustrated lover tothe ben affleck
? s laid
- bakc best friend
,
adn all hte small roles inaddition beween
, the performances are magnificent
. robin williams
? skill isnt a given as a bereaved psychologist who could
? ve had a legendary career
bu ws knocked off the path somwhere down the line
. tyhe real gme
though isnt stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as professer lambeau
, an award
- winning mathematican who feels reduced in compairison tothe a yuonger
, smarter will hunting
. teh scenes bewteen williams
annd skarsg
? rd
, as twpo ood college pals who
? ve beeen broght bakc toghether by htis enigmatic kid
, display some of the best acting i
? ve ever seen
. whn i sday delivering the goods
, htis isnt what i
? m tlaking about
. watching theese two wokr is what going to see movies is all about
. gus van sant
? s
( tothe dieu for
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction isnt right onthe
, as well as danny elfman
? s sauntering musical socre
. i highly recommend
? good iwll hunting
?
. dispite its faults
, it is still an intriguing
adn fascinating film
and you are nto likely tothe see a better acted oney this year
.
