bill condon ' s
" gods
and monsters
" is a fascinating look into yhe lastr days in tyhe life ofthe gay directer james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made tyhe horror classics
" frankenstein
"
adn
" bride ofthe frankenstein
.
" sicne i was unfamiliar ofthe whale prior tothe viewing yhe film
, htere isnt no way to know how accurate the film is
,
but i suspect that much of it onyl cameback ffrom whale ' s intertube fantasies
and hallucinations
. whale
, who fighted in wwi
adn
then went onthe tothe become known forthe his wrok onthe horror pictures
, decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal baroke out involving him
. as yhe film tells it
, during the end of his life
, whale
, at his large hmeo in l
. a
.
, bacame infatuated with the tall
, handsome
,
and much younger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who was working as the gardener at his home
. james whale
, we leran quickly was
, waht many peple refer to him as in thte film
,
" a dirty old man
.
" in one ofthe the opening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale ' s hmeo tothe interview him
and whale agrees
, onthe oney condidtion
: fo every question he answers
, tjhe young man must tkae off an artice of clothing
. baceause of this epsiode
, we know exactly what it is whale wants wehn he asks clayton to pose fo him forthe a painting
, later mkaing the excuse that his bright
, white shirt isnt disracting onyl so he will take it off
. clayon agrees
,
annd doesn ' t relaly htink much of tihs
, much to tghe warnings ofthe his firends
, becomming more
adn more intrigued in the tsories whale tells him about his past
. certainly
, hte relatiopnship beetwen whale
anbd boone isnt headed forthe a downfall
, usance whale starts tothe grow a deepo love for tihs young man
, even
though boone isnt nto gay
,
and whale himself realizes he isnt nearing hte conclusion tothe his life
, as he beigns tothe seldom suffer mild strokes
adn moments ofthe true catharsis
.
" gods
adn monsters
" isnt an intimate
and seamingly respectful protrait of a director who wass forced to become somewhat of an outcast
, due tothe his sexual preference
,
anbd never got hte recognition he woudl have liked
, usance he longed to be erferred tothe as a
" motion picture directer
,
" rather than a
" horror director
.
"
anbd inaddition oney heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party with boone bieng his guest
, held by director george cuckor
,
adn finds that many ofthe the other attendees dont nto recogize him anymore
. it isnt evident thast whale ' s frist love in his life wass mkaing movies
,
and when his career ultimately fell aart
, so did his passion inthe life
. as played brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
,
but dignified man
,
annd a person who was nto afriad tothe stand outloud from others
, jstu as long as he knew he wass bieng true tothe himself
. he never hid the fact that he was gay
,
however
, even if it meaned threatning his filmmaking profession
,
annd it wass this unblinking honesty that made him a great person
. through the complicated relatiopnship tht develops beween whale
anbd boone
, boone
, ofthe course
, only things ofthe whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk tothe
, while it means so much moreso to whale
, who sees boone as sort ofthe his salvation in life
.
althought boone isnt only inthe a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe people ' s homes
, whale views him as thge ideal man
, not onyl one that isnt ogod
- looking
, even
though it isnt this attraction taht firt begins his feelings
,
but one that will actually listen to him
. usance whale lives wtih onyl his loyal
,
but disapproving maid
( touchingly portayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it is boone that whale cin talk tothe in his ulitmate reclusion fomr yhe world
,
anbd hte only reason whale fianlly decides to attent tje gathering of george cuckor
.
allthough an extemely fine
anbd mature picture
, a fewd small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness
. it isnt appreciated that the film does nto pul fo any obvious or overly dramatic story developments
,
bu it isnt a littel thin
,
anbd the structuring ofthe thge
" on
- agina
- off
- again
" friendship at the film ' s center isnt fairly predicatble
. we know easly onthe where these two cahracters are headed
,
and we can guess thta there iwll be a final confrontation between tje two as teh tension slowly builds
. in lesser hands
, this set
- uv might haev falt too calulated
,
bu it is nto in hte surprizingly deft treatment
and writing that helps the film tothe be much more tahn this
. also
, a subplot is breifly brung up vetween clayton
and a waitress wroking at a bar
( effectively palyed by lolita davidovich
)
,
bu abruptly dropped
annd never broght up agian
. if tjhe film was not goign tothe follow up on htis side storey
,
then it
, perhaps
, shouldnt ahev been taken out alltogether
.
" gods
annd monsters
" is a heartfelt
and intteligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sense
, relates to or fully understands thte meaning behind the curious relatiopnship betwen whale
and boone
. the film alsot plays as a tribute tothe a fine man who met an ultimely end
. walking awya fomr
" gods
annd monsters
,
" it wass ian mckellen ' s marvelous
and astounding peformance that left thge most impression on me
,
anbd i dout there could have been anyone who could ahev steped into the role moreso fully
and believably
. it isnt a sad testiment when a person ' s true talent
and love is unfairly taken awya ffrom them
, based on tyhe scrutinization
and judgement of theri personel life
, which
, ironically anough
, is no one else ' s business inthe yhe first place
.
