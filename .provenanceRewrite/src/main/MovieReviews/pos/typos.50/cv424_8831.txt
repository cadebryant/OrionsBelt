i cxan sum up first strike in one owrd
: awesome
. never in my life hvea i seen an atcor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan
. forthe the simple reason taht he has performed his pwn stunts infact his eveyr movie he ' s ever appeared infront
, he shoudl be awared greatly
. the same toom
annd jerry forumla thta was used to make chan ' s rumble in the bronx
adn supercop so entertaining can be found here as well
.
howver
, firt strike ws propably the most exciting outloud of the threee
, for the simple reason thta pratice makes perfect
. his last two movies weere almost like practice
annd tihs one was grat
. like rumble
, thsi film is baout tjhe masia
, tghe fromer kgb
. now chan must dont battle inaddition tje freezing arctic temperatures ofthe the ukraine against a gropu ofthe vyer large bad men
. tghe trailer for the film sums it up qtuie well
. first strike isnt acation
- packed
,
but teh fight scenes are so fast
adn furious
, they alomst haev a witty
, italion
- liek humor tothe them
. jackie chan isnt a regluar comedian
. well
, he ' s no eddie murphy
,
but he can really crack you up
. forthe example
, he isnt hanging off a roof
and he humorously taunts his foes tothe come
and git him
, as he claims to be the korean 007
( that ' s secet agent james bond
)
. even thge plot tothe this film improved above teh others
, as a sort
- of twisted nuculear
- weapon smuggling deal isnt botched
annd jackie takes tghe blame
.
but never fear
, as the chineese masia aids him inaddition uncovering the truth behind the insident
. with smoe ofthe the most high
- flying stunts
and side
- splitting comedy
, first strike isnt a sure
- frie hitted that ' s gaurenteed tothe draw smoe major
, world
- wide attension
.
