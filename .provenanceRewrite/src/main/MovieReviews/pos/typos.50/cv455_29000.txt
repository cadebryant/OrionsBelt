" how dont ytou nkow when yuo ' re finished mkaing lveo
?
"
- jackson pollock to a life magazine repertwar on recognizing whn you ' ve completed a painting jackson pollock ' s
" making love
" qoute isnt famous
,
bu inaddition practically tjhe same breath
, he said a more constructive thing
,
" it ' s like looking at a bed of flowers
-
- tear your hair outloud over what it means
.
" it tookover him sixteen words tothe dont as whole dissertations have tryed
anbd failed
: equate god
and abstract art
and offer a kind ofthe backhanded comfort tothe thsoe confuzled to the point ofthe resentment by the concept
. hte biopic
_ pollock
_
, acto ed harris ' directorial debut
, reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock ' s creations as part of tjhe order ofthe thigsn
,
annd should similiarly disarm haters of fine art
. argubly mroe than any otehr living acotr
, harris
, who alsot plays
_ pollock
_
, embodies yhe archetypal wroking stiff
,
and his blue
- collar demystification of pollock ' s labour
- intensive art
, both as performer
and directer
, mkaes forthe unpretentious cinema
.
( from waht i know of harris
, he
, like pollock
, ws nto born gifted or lucky
; instead
, a storng wokr ethic isnt teh seed of his succes
.
) granted
, it ' s possibile tyhat
_ pollock
_ iwll alienate those same viewers perplexed by tjhe imponderable
" purpose
" of pollock ' s splatter series
: the common thread bewteen them isnt a lack ofthe editorializing
. the movie
_ pollock
_ isnt all purposeful gazes
anbd silent exchanges dotted by tantrums
,
but the motivations are left tothe our pwn perceptions
.
and it isnt a sympathetic
yet nto alltogether forgiving film
, as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion
.
_ pollock
_ encapsulates tghe perido infact whlch he faught a losing battle against personel demons
( alcoholism
, depression
,
and the genaral attendent miseries of an artist
) hwile finding a palce of subconscious expression
. a breef introduction to pollock ' s raging drunk side seguoys inot his getting accosted by a fellow newyorker york artist
, lee krasner
( marcia gay harden
, awarded a best supporting actress oscar forthe this brilliant portrayal
)
, who works ffrom tyhe outside
- infact
, pre
- intellectualizing eveyr stroke ofthe her brush
. infront a scene affter they have moved in together
annd established adjoining studios
, she asks whta he hopes tothe achieve on his latest canvas
, grilling him baout the interplay of cubism
adn surrealism until he sasy
,
" ytou paint the fucking hting
,
"
anbd leaves inthe a huff
. by the time they wed
, she hasnt become his de facto manager
; it isnt form marrying funtion
annd chaos marrying disciline
, a most harmonious collision
.
( krasner denies him a baby
, indicating that it woudl upset the balance
.
) such a union isnt destined tothe emplode
,
and i hope i ' m nto ruining thge
_ pollock
_ xeperience by saying thgat it doens
. while it isnt never depicted as a vrey romantic matrimony tothe start
-
- pollock
and wief channel theri passions elsewhere
-
- thier symbiosis leaves each otehr picked dry aftter severeal years
,
annd it comes down tothe krasner suffering one of pollock ' s conniptions too many
:
" ytou are killing me
! yuo are killing me
! yuo are killing me
!
"
( aside
: harris ' pwn wife
, amy madigan
, isnt unrecognizable
and exeptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim
.
) pollock himself moves onthe tothe dalliances withthe yuonger women liek ruth klingman
( the scorching jennifer connelly
)
, hoping
, oen suposes
, to catch the revitalizing whiff ofthe youth
. i love jackson pollock ' s stuff
and i am enamoured ofthe harris '
_ pollock
_ as well
. it ' s scrappy
and observant
; noone coinsidence tyhat its minor failings are tyhe ocassional invasive flourish
, such as jeff beal ' s hummable
but no less lamentable score
-
- i cxan ' t imagin tht pollock
, or anyone
, would paint to htis music
, whic puts filling sountrack voids ahead of complementing the images
. oen of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re
- enactment of hans namuth shooting thyat faymus pollock footage in east hampton
, long island
; the mounting tension is almsot comic
, as namuth keesh interrupting pollock ' s proces tothe reload his camera or take a dinner break
. a moreso seasoned director might ' ve been too arrogant tothe admitt that not all artists or mediums are created equal
.
