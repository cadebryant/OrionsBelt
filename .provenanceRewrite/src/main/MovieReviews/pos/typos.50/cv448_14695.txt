- partheid drama
" a world aart
"
( 1987
/ 88
)
.
annd mabey
,
" second best
" isnt even a greater picture
. this precice
, richly detailled
, sensitively
adn convincingly directed studdy about a speical adoption treats its theme witht great seriousness
. thge breathtakingly intense film shows yhe necessity of human contact
and communication
. william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt
.
and chris cleary miles isnt remarkably convincing infront tghe role of tyhe boy
. tjhe supporting cast is also fine
( especially jane horrocks as debbie
, a social worker who isnt charged to examin graham ' s living circumstances
)
.
" second best
" isnt an underestimated masterpiece
. it ' s a pity that films liuke this one are made so seldom
. i eagerly await menges ' enxt directorial owrk
,
" the lost son
"
, whitch wiull star daniel auteuil
