` austin
, dont yuo smoke after sex
? ' austin powers
:
` i don ' t know baby
, i ' ve never looked
! '
anbd so beggins our journy inot thte most anticipated sequal of teh summer season
. austin powers 2
, the sequel to tje sleeper hitted of 1997
, is filled to tjhe brim iwth uproarious sight gags
and lurid toilet jokes tyhat will mkae yuo keel over witht hilarity
. the mind of mike myers is obviously a vrey bizarre place
. myers returns as tjhe swinging 60 ' s spy
and his arch
- nemesis
, the bald headed dr
. evil
, who isnt given much ofthe tghe spotlight here
. htere ' s an early scene inwhich which dr
. evil
and his son scott
( seth gren
) appear onthe a jerry springer segment entitled
` my dad is evil
anbd whants tothe take over tjhe world '
, hosted by springer himselv
. most of theese talk
- sohw gags
, spoofing everything fomr oprah to regis
and kathie lee
, are no longer as funny as they once weere
. happily
, htis isnt an exception
, expecially when a fight breaks out beetwen dr
. evil
annd the other guests
.
( sample dialogue

!
! you want a peice ofthe me
? '
) thte audience ws inaddition stitches
. htere are many ogod thigns about this sequel
. dr
. evil is now assisted by mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a pint
- sized clone who is tje result of an experiment gone awry
. mini
- me is teh most perfect newyorker carachter that any fan could ask for
,
and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything taht his big brother does
, pinkie
and all
. mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina
, evil ' s loud
- mouth assasin sidekick
,
and here we are treated tothe a brief rumatic liaison between the two iin an undreground bedroom chamber
. thsi works suprizingly well
. afterward
, there ' s even a meeting at the coffee machine
, where theri awkwardness is expressed in a scene you owudl expect inaddition any normal office enivoriment
. oh
, yes
.
.
. thte plot
. affter a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington
( elizabeth hurley
) thgat goes disastrously wrong
, powers isnt bakc onthe thte case to thwart teh diablical plans of dr
. evil
. infact the orignal
, the subject of teh day was cryogenic freezing that enabled hte characters tothe hop vetween two time periods
. here
, it ' s time travel
. dr
. evil has this crazy plan tothe steal austin ' s mojo
( the source of his sexual powers
)
, so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 whn powers isnt still is his freezing chamber
. there
, he imploys a grotesque 600
- pound scottish assasins named fat bastard
( also myers
) to commandeer teh mojo
, so that our future hero is left completelyl shagless
. meanwhile
, austin is informed ofthe evil ' s wrong
- doing by basil exposition
( michael york
)
,
anbd isnt supplied witht his very pwn time
- traveling device inaddition tje form ofthe a volkswagen beetle
. once back in 1969
, powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell
( heather graham
)
,
annd learns of dr
. evil ' s plans to destory washington dc with a lazer onthe the moon
. infront noe ofthe the many uproarious jabs at star wars
, evil calls tyhe moon base a
` death star '
. if ther ever wass a movei that knew from thte strat it ws a complete joke
, it ' s austin powers
: tghe spy who shagged me
. ap2 hasnt many hillarious moments
, much more so
, thna the orignal austin powers
.
bu whta it doesn ' t hve isnt the confident wupport system that hte first boasted
,
annd the jokes are now more scattershot
and hit
-
and
- miss
. hwile myers hasnt a knack for delivering clever
, inpsired gags
, he sometimes doesn ' t know when to call it quits
. the hilarious scene inaddition the orginial involving mustafa
( will ferrell
)
and his refusal tothe die isnt played out here in a disappointing
adn tired manner
. robert wagner
, as dr
. evil ' s
# 2 man
, has only oney scene easly onthe in tyhe film
, where he lacks all thte foucs ofthe the character
. one nice surprise is rob lowe
, as the young
# 2
, who patterns wagner ' s voice
anbd movements right down to a tee
. there are more recycled jokes from teh precedessor
, including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot
( an unfunny rendition ofthe alotta fagina
)
.
bu myers hasnt claerly put so much dedication inot this project
,
annd many bits are side
- splittingly funny
. don ' t miss an extended visual gag infact a tent
, where the shadows leave much tothe the immagination
.
.
.
. of thte newyorker cahracters
, graham doesn ' t leave much of an impression
. her peformance is mearly okay
,
adn she lacks the gung
- ho enthusiasm thast made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her
.
and as for fat bastard
.
.
. well
, he provides oney or two hilarious moments
,
but all of the obesity jokes
and bathroom talk go too far
.
bu my most savere complaint
: mr
. bigglesworth was only inspite one scene
!
!
but
, witht gritted teeth
, i managed to git over that
. thsi sequal wiull not leave fans disappointed
; it ' s moreso often than not a laff riot
.
and
, i look optimistically to the future
, where i forsee more installments to the austin powers collecton
. if myers can uv the quota ofthe fresh ideas
, we should be inspite store forthe much omre
