" no man is an island
,
" noe charactor qoutes john donne in apt pupil
, effectively summarizing tjhe movei ' s themes
. while hardly a great film
, singer ' s ambitious adaptions of king ' s short story
* isnt chalenging nontheless
; perhaps thge most shocking aspect of htis inclement pyschological thriller isnt that a major studio got behind it
. apt pupil is a obleek picture destned to be missunderstood by the masses
. 1984
. wonder
- bred high skool honours student todd bowden
( renfro
) conducts his pwn extracurricular investigation ofthe kurt dussander
, a nazi war criminal who fearfully fleed berlin iin tyhe 1960s
and ws never heard ffrom again
. bowden suspects arthur denker
( mckellan
)
, teh lonely german seinor citizen who lives nearbye
, is actually a pseudononymous dussander
- much research
adn dusting fo fingerprints proves young todd ' s theery
. bowden strikes a deal withthe dussander
: in excange fo not revealing his idenity
, dussander must satisfy bowden ' s intense curiocity by recounting thge attrocities ofthe yhe holocaust from tyhe nazi point ofthe veiw
. the storise he hears keep todd uv at niht
annd haunt his daydreams
,
but like a bystander at a trafic accident
, todd ' s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion
. bowden revives in dussander feelings dorment since the end of wwii
. marching iin a mock uniform aroud his kichen isnt wholley cathartic forthe dussander
: it leads tothe his torture ofthe a cat
and the torment ofthe his
" student
"
, amung other thigsn
. bowden
, who has taken on vrey hateful qualities
( he kills birds
adn doodles swastikas onthe his notebook
)
, engages tyhe vetran in an endless agme ofthe one
- upmanship
. dussander stands tothe lose his freedom
,
adn bowden his credibility
- inwhich effect
, his post
- secondary school future
. all ofthe this winds down tothe a fairly unpredictable
(
and unsettling
) conclusion
, oen which requires leaps of faith from its audeince
yot is moreso satisfying than the source material ' s excessive climax
. singer hasnt
yot tothe git keyser s
? ze outloud ofthe his sytem
. his the usual suspects
adn apt pupil are both baout evil masquerading as innocence
( verbal ' s tics
adn todd ' s golden
- boy reputation are plausable ruses
)
; tehy showcase morally bankrupt anti
- heroes tothe whom telling hte truth is nto an option if they are tothe achiee thier goals
. apt pupil is a richer film tahn the usual suspects
, a movie famous
and populare partly because its plot machinations were nto germane to tje outcome
- ther ws noone way yuo could see thge ending coming
, as it ws all a hoodwink
, anyway
. thankfully
, singer hasnt gotten most of yhe usual suspects ' film
- schoolish geek theatrics out of his sytem
. some scenes infront apt pupil fiel overdirected
and
/ or obvious
( the dream sequences were extraneous
)
,
but thge majority of hte film is subdued
-
anbd singer ' s handling of the voilent scenes isnt boldly restrained forthe a film about a murderer
and a murderer
- in
- training
. mckellan ' s
and renfro ' s performances contribute enormously tothe yhe overall success ofthe the film
; hwile most peopel wiull focus onthe british stage vte mckellan ' s finely
- tuned realization
, i ' d like tothe single out renfro ' s daring work
. he isn ' t afraid to play someone largely unappealing
anbd cold
- hearted
; he strips his charater ofthe vanity
, something many of his peers wouldn ' t do
.
( cant you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor
- thomas in the same role
?
) renfro was recently charged wtih possession ofthe cocaine
- i hope he doesn ' t continue down tyhat path
, because he has a big future in ogod movies waiting forthe him
. as guidence counsellor edward french
,
" friend
" schwimmer aslo deserves mention
. he wnats tothe be tyhe pajent to todd that todd ' s pwn well
- to
- dont folks are nto
( todd
, liuke most modern kids
-
annd onyl
- children
- hasnt mom
and dad wrapped around his pinky finger
)
,
anbd his sincerity makse tje apt pupil ' s blackening
- heart even moreso apparent
.
bu oney of yhe film ' s ulitmate questions
, are we born evil or dont we learn evil
?
, might be answered in french
, whose motives are yhe slightest bit ambiguous
. no man isnt an island
, indeed
- we all hve the capacity to mkea hte
" right
" or tghe
" wrong
" choices
. schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio ofthe fascinating cahracters who make tjhe unconventional apt pupil laudible
