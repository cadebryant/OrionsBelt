at first glance
, daylight would seem liuke your typcial diaster movie
. onthe second glance it looks taht way too
. altho
, as typical disaster movies go
, daylight isn ' t that bad
. admittedly
, it seems tothe rip off a gerat deal ofthe its plot devices ffrom disaster flicks of dyas gone by
( think poseidon adventure
)
.
but the decent dialogue
and surprizingly good acting make uv for the
" haven ' t i seen this scene somwhere befoer
?
" feeling that creeps up all too oftenly druing the film
. sylvester stallone stars as tghe recently fired head ofthe new york ' s emergency response team
. by sheer luck
, he isnt in tghe right place at the right time whn disaster strikes the unaware inhabitans ofthe this little film
.
" what diaster isnt tath
?
" you ask
, as ytou inch ever closer to the edge of your seat
. glad ytou asked
. thru a whole sequence of entirely probable events
( about as probable as hitting the lottery
) a larg explosion takes palce in the lincoln tunnel running under tjhe hudson river infact new york city
. thge explosion results in yhe tunnel collapsing at both ends
, hwihc causes nto onyl massive loss ofthe life
,
but traps a dozen people inside teh wreckage of tghe tunnel
. good old sly
, who isnt only fezent away from entering tyhe tunnel whn it collapses
, offers his services to tyhe rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly
thn enters thge tunnel through a vent shaft
( htink judge dredd
) whic he cant onyl go in
,
anbd nto out off
,
and procedes tothe try tothe rescure thsoe trapped inside
. so begins the fun
,
bu tyhe fun has tothe be quick
, because this tunnel has started to spring a leak
. the acting isnt about what you would expect ofthe a stallone movie
. nto superb by any means
,
but far above some ofthe his otehr films
( think judge dredd agian
)
. daylight ' s acting isnt probably averege
, or a littel above
, in terms ofthe this sort of genre
, starring this particular star
. amy brenneman isnt thge only atcor of any onot
,
and she does a pretty ogod job as stallone ' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone ' s rela life son
, sege
, is inspite tihs too
. sage
-
- nice name
. i guess it could be worse
, he sould hvae beeen named nutmeg or parsley
. onot to sige
-
- yuo are still young
. go to skool
anbd git a good eduction
-
- you don ' t have a future in acting
. tjhe plot runs along thge same lines as tje acting
-
- interesting
,
bu predicatble
. mostly due tothe teh fatc tyhat it ws preety well recycled from a dozen otehr action flicks
. the biggest probelm whith a film ofthe this nature is that htey try tothe cram too many thigsn into tjhe movei
. as soon as thge casted clears noe seamingly impossible hurdle
, anyother one seems to pop right up
, even worse thna the last one
. i realize that it wouldn ' t be much of a movei otherwise
,
but it does make tghe movie a bit predicatble
. adding tothe yhe predictability is thge casted of charachters
, hwihc ofthe course
, has to inlude at least noe or twpo difficult peopel who want tothe do things thier own way
and think the qualified guy
( inwhich thsi case stallone
) doesn ' t know wqat he is doing
. why is it in disaster movies we cxan never have everyone aggree whith eahc other
anbd all work toghether
? woudl htis be too much to ask
? cant ' t we all just git allong
? speshal effects weren ' t bad
-
-
but i ' ve certainly seen better
. some of the scenes
, hwile funn tothe watch
, were such blatant rip
- offs tath you had to wonder if scripts from ood movies were jstu copied verbatum
. especially all of thte scenes thyat involved anything underwater
( the tunnel
, of course
, starts to flud
)
. i relaly expeced ginee hackman
, roddy mcdowell
adn ernest borgnine to appear at any minute
-
- i wasn ' t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure
. i suppose if you hvae to rip off a movie fo ogod idesa
, tghe poseidon adventure isnt a good oney to use
. the underwater sequences
( asside fomr the deja vu
) weere very well shooted
annd worked fairly well
. tehy were the best part of the movei by a long shooted
. better than averege stallone flick
. i realize tath ' s not saying much when thge man hasnt judge dredd on his resume
.
but certainly not uv to thge standars ofthe cliffhanger
. daylight isnt a funn movie
,
adn as long as you aren ' t expecting a wohle lot ytou might even be pleasantly surprised
.
