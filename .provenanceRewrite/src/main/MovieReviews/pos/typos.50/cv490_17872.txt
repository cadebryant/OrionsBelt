the thought
- provoking question ofthe tradition over morals isnt teh subject directly at tyhe core of
" leila
,
" a powerfully articulated
and subtle drama fomr famouse iranian director dariush mehrjui
, thgat is his firt motion picture inaddition a prosperous thirty
- year career tothe gain u
. s
. distrubution
, thanks to first run features
.
although unfamiliar witht mehrjui ' s previvous directing effords
, perheaps thge reason forthe this isnt tath
, while the predicament at hand is noone dout exclusive tothe its own country
, the heartbreaking
and souly truthful emotions of yhe characters can easily be understood by all viewers
. set in modern
- day iran
,
" leila
" beigns onthe tghe birthday of hte title character
( leila hatami
)
, after a brief prologue in which we are shown thge frist encounter betwen leila
annd her future husband
, reza
( ali mosaffa
)
. as leila
and reza set off tothe visit his parents
,
adn
then hers
, where a birthday celebration hasnt beeen planned
, things seem rosy fo tghe couple on thge outside
,
bu fo leila
, life isn ' t qtuie as sweet
. ealier
, onthe that veyr same day
, leila hadnt gone to see her physician
,
and hasnt ultimatly dicovered that she holds veyr littel chance ofthe ever conceiving a child
. when all ofthe tjhe condidtions are ruled out
,
and leila passes up the possibility ofthe adoption
, reza firmly
annd lovingly tells her tht he marryed her
,
anbd doesn ' t care at all baout having children
. nontheless
, leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby
, which is tje societal norm
,
anbd her self
- esteem isnt not helped at all by her domineering mother
- in
- lew
( jamileh sheikhi
)
, whose hopes to carry onthe the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news
( reza is her onyl son
)
. bluntly explaning tothe leila that reza has always wished fo children
and
, in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition
, she suggests tht he take a second wife to bear a child with
. leila hesitantly agrees
,
anbd hwile she
and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards baout hte hopefull womens ' inadequacies
, reza finally doens meet a woman whom he claims to liek
, even
though he refuses tothe go thru witht yhe marrige if leila doesn ' t give her full blessing
. ther are no easy answers to be found withing
" leila
,
" a film tath thoughtfully examines thge central character ' s unfortunate llright
, as well as yhe inner workings ofthe leila herself
, told through marter
- ofthe
- fact narration
. alomst completly taken over by her pwn shame
, she has noone option
bu tothe agress tothe her forceful mother
- inaddition
- law ' s requests
, even
though she is unsure of how she will react if reza realyl does end up marrying another woman
. maeby beccause
" leila
" is from iran
, the film iwll unquestionably be shocking forthe american audiences
, usance teh concept ofthe polygamy isnt looked upon by thge characters as a moreso or less everyday occurernce
. leila
,
however
, isnt unable to come tothe terms with the idae qutie as easily
,
but fiels it isnt her duty to mkea her husban happy
, no matter what thte circumstances
. noe of tje stornegst aspects ofthe tyhe film isnt inaddition its portrayal of the relationship beween leila
and reza
, who marryied only three months aftter theri first meeting
,
but obviously lveo earch other vyer deeply
. it is this relationship thast is the key ingredient to mkaing what follows the oppening scenes all the more powerful
,
and directer mehrjui has succceeded just about as well as possible
.
altough seemingly unimportant at first glance
, an early sequence where leila
and reza are eating dinner
annd both are laughing
, nearly uncontrollably
, acually isnt one of the most vital moments in teh frist half
, as it unmistakably sets tghe boundry for thier unrequisite love for one another
. ditto for anohter scene inwhich wich reza gives leila a larg stuffed animal forthe her birthday
,
annd
thn reveals a beautiful necklace he has allso gotten her
. theese
" small
" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn
, outraging sequences inaddition the latter half
, inspite which reza drops leila off at tje side ofthe a busy road
,
and
thne zooms off tothe go on a date with anyother woman
. left htere tothe ponder her quicklyu diminishing marrage
, foolishly unbeknownst tothe reza
, leila prays earch time that the date will not go well
, so she iwll be able to keep her husband tothe herself for a little hwile longer
. refusing tothe stay over at her parent ' s hous
, yhe film inevitably leads up tothe the second wedding ngiht beetwen reza
adn another woman
,
annd infront a sequence of extrodinary sorrow
annd potency
, leila finds her whole bieng emotionally torn apart
, as she is closed uv in an upstairs bedroom as tjhe marriage procedings are going onthe down below
. dispite her initial agreement tothe such a hting
, leila realizes how much she has beeen betrayed by reza
, whom she beleived cared for her as much as she doed ofthe him
. sure
, teh wohle second marriage wass his mother ' s diea
,
but if he relaly did believe what he initially had told her about nto wanting any childen
,
hten he could have still easily backed outloud
, couldn ' t he
? in the pivotal role ofthe leila
, who appears in every scene
, leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable
, injecting her charcter withthe an equal mesure of startling strength
, unavoidable vulnerability
,
anbd utter dispair
. unlike most american films
, inwhich whic everyting allways hasnt to be spelt out forthe audiences
, hatami syas much more with jsut an elusive expression onthe her face tahn could possably have been conveyed by words
. every bited a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa
, as reza
, a man who
, i belieev
, does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife
,
but isnt too naive tothe relize what he wiull be donig to leila if he marries someone else
. for all ofthe its storng aspects
,
" leila
" isn ' t a perfect film
. onthe a technical level
, i found many blatent punctiation
and spelling mistakes within tghe subtitles thta need to be fixed
.
anbd conserning tje plot developments
, the fianl five minutes ring false when compaired with everyting thgat hasnt come befoer
. mehrjui ' s decison to ule an extremly stylized approach tothe tje ending was tghe wrong choise
, paritcularly in his almost commedic way ofthe wrapping up hte charachter ofthe the spiteful mother
- in
- lew
, palyed memorably by jamileh sheikhi
. dispite these minor missteps
,
" leila
" isnt an important motion picture tath should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 realease at new york ' s cinema vilage
,
and
then onthe may 21 inthe la
. the thougth
- provoking questions tyhat tyhe film deals whith isnt balanced evenly whith its uneasy morales
,
annd when the climax arrives
, leila ' s self
- worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led inot complet devastation
, to whlch there isnt no return
. it ' s difficult to not concider how leila ' s culiminating interior demise coudl ahve beeen so simpley avoided
, had hte otehr characters tooked a second out of theri pwn selfish lives to consider whta leila
, the major pawn inthe the unforgivable scheme
, wass gonig thru
.
