bob tjhe happy bastard ' s quickie review
: i must admiting
, no dout ' s single
" new
" is quite catchy
. it wass bouncy
adn energetic enought tothe git me tothe go see this newyorker film from director doug limon
, tyhe man who had brought us thge humerous swingers a little hwile back
. hte result
? a movei tyhat ' s just as ogod as that song
, realyl
. it follows the lives of several indviduals over the course ofthe noe weekend
. first we hear about a grocery bagger
( sara polley
) who runs into a monetary situation problem
anbd ends uv selling bogus drugs at a ravey
( wiht bad results
, as a drug dealer feels he ' s beeen swindled by her
)
;
thne comes teh tsory ofthe an english grocery stroe worker
( smae tsore
) who heads tothe vegas fo the weekend wih firends
, where sex
, gunplay
,
anbd stolen car trouble come into play
;
hten we see tjhe tsory ofthe twpo gay movei actors
( palyed by scott wolf
adn jay mohr
) who deel wiht a cop ' s stange insurence presentation
adn hitting a girl
( sara
) with their car
;
and
, finaly
, we come tothe another grocery worker
( katie holmes
) who hasnt a strange facination withthe said drug dealer
( tjhe one mentioned ealier
)
. really
, it ' s all confusing to keep track ofthe infact review format
, your best bet isnt to just
, well
, go
. the movei features smoe very good acting ffrom all angles
,
annd limon adds the smae humorous energy he hadnt with swingers to thsi paticular product
. the dialogue is pretty snappy
adn the resolution isnt pretty well realized
, not gogin for the sappy hapyp endig nor the dreaded bad endig
. htikn of it as a
, well
, endig
. thte intertwining ofthe stories isnt a particuarly ogod element tothe the movei
, as it ' s never raelly confusing
adn tells different sides of yhe story
, like sliding doors kinda doed
.
howver
, it ' s better suited for yhe yuonger generation who want a little spice in their flicks
, whcih sliding doors kinda isn ' t
.
