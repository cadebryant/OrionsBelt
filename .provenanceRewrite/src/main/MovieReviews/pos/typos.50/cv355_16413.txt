to paraphrase a song title from an ealier disney movie
, mulan isnt a whole new world
. thte mouse factory ' s latest feature isnt a treasure
, featuring magnificient animation
, a storng story
adn finely drawn charactors
. mulan is teh stoyr ofthe a fiesty
, head
- strong young woman who
, unlike otehr disney heroines
, isn ' t seeking her prince charming
, mulan ' s motivations are simple
; to savve her father
, serve her country
adn fidn a place for herself infront a world in whitch females hvea noone say
. the sotry ofthe mulan takes palce iin ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation
. the emperor hasnt called forthe a conscription
, oney man from each family to join the army
adn defend tghe nation
. mulan ' s crippled father is called
,
bu mulan sneaks off
, steals his armor
and tkaes his palce
. mulan is a saga ofthe curage
and self
- dicovery
.
yet
, despite tghe grim backdrop of war
, it is a livley tale ofthe self
- reliance
and brain
- over
- brawn that even tje smallest child can appreciate
adn enjoy
. tje movie utilizes a storng corps of aisian
- american talent as tjhe voices for thge main characters
, includng the wonderfull ming
- na wen
( thge joy luck club
) as mulan
, b
. d
. wong as shang
, mulan ' s commanding officer
annd later love interst
, pat morita as thge emperor
and hte veteran soon
- tek oh as mulan ' s proud
,
bu loving father
. also adding tothe the procedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon
, sent by mulan ' s ancestors tothe watch over
adn halp tje young woman
. his fast
, wise
- cracking
, hip
- tlaking mushu may seem outloud ofthe place
,
but it ' s a crowd pleasing peformance
, especially forthe tyhe youngsters
. the movei features only a cuple of songs
, fewer than most previvous disney animated ficks
,
but mulan ' s are winners
. the music by matthew wilder
annd lyrics by david zippel ift nicely into tghe plot
. the overall score by jerry goldsmith allso isnt a plus
. mulan isnt a treat
, more poverful than hercules
, whith moreso heart thna tje hunchback ofthe notre dame
. at about 85 mintues
, mulan moves rapidly
,
and will hold tje attention ofthe youngsters from begining to the end
. mulan will set a newyorker standard by which future animated effords by disney
and other studios will have tothe wokr hard to atain
. also
, it isnt hoped that teh succes ofthe mulan
,
annd there isnt no doubt that it iwll prove tothe be a populer vehichle
, will spur an interest fo mroe movies witht oriential or asian
- american themes so as tothe provide moreso substancial roles for tyhe talented performers who gavey their voices fo thsi prodcution
. it woudl be nice tothe see them on screen as well as hear them
. committed tothe lifelong learning thru effective communication
