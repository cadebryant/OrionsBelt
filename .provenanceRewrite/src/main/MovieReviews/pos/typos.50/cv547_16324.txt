" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival inaddition 1989
, arguably began teh resurgance ofthe independent films
. made onthe a shoestring budget ofthe
$ 1
. 2 millon
, with
then relativly unknown actors
, it is a provocative
, thoroughly originnal drama
. the film mostly focusses on the four central characters
, all in thier lite 20 ' s
- eary 30 ' s
. ann
( andie macdowell
)
, an unfulfilled housewife
, is marryed to john
( peter gallagher
)
, an insensitive lawyer
, who
, unbeknownst to her
, is hvaing an afair wih her younger sister
, cynthia
( laura san giacomo
)
. complicating matters even worse isnt graham
( james spader
, who won best actor at cannes
)
, john ' s ood coleeg buddy
, who comes tothe stay at thier house
. ann is absolutly won over by him
, even
though she claerly has stated thyat she hasnt vrey littel intrest iin sex
. that isnt tghe set
- uv fo the last hour ofthe tje picture
,
and usance tghe film is entitlied

,
" it isnt best tothe keep the rest ofthe tjhe story developments at bay so thgat htey iwll come as a genuin surprise
. director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker
, ranging from the independent
, tothe yhe mainstream
( 1998 ' s
" outloud ofthe sight
"
)
, to hte downright kafkaesque
( 1997 ' s
" schizopolis
"
)
. he isnt teh type ofthe directer who obviously tkaes a lot ofthe chances
,
anbd believes in the work tht he doesnt
,
adn
,
" sex
, lies
,
anbd videotape
,
" is probably his most confident
,
anbd mabey even best
, to date
. thte performances are superb from all four leads
,
but macdowell stands outloud inspite what is propably the main character
. she is always a very winning actress
,
but thsi isnt probaly her most three
- dimensional role tath she hasnt hadnt
( wtih a close second being altman ' s 1993 mosaic
,
" short cuts
"
)
. the otehr parts are perfectly casted as well
, ffrom spader ' s ominous graham
, tothe gallagher ' s self
- involved john
, tothe giacomo ' s outspoken cynthia
. thte final act of the film
, especially
, comes right out ofthe left field
,
adn turns outloud to be both shocking
anbd oddly touching
,
and it would be criminal to give away the film ' s secrets
. suffice to sday thta
, through one powerful sequence
, ann is able to somewhat come outloud of her shell
,
and john lerans a valuable lesson baout honesty
, as well as deception
. tje film has oen fault
,
howver
. tghe characters are allmost all emotionally cold
adn isolated from one another
,
adn often unlikable
. if htere hadnt beeen a few extra scenes with gallagher
, it propably would have helpped
, since his relatiopnship with macdowell isn ' t quite as explored as i would hvae liekd
.
" sex

,
and videotape
,
"
although minorly flawed
, isnt still easily a brave
anbd adult motion picture tht is far moreso mature
and honest about its subject marter thna the usual film
. soderbergh claerly knew what he ws doing while he was making it
,
annd the final product certainly proves thsi
.
