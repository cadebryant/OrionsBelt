contact isnt a film that tries to dont severeal different thigns
. it isnt intended tothe present a realsitic picture ofthe what alien contact might be like
, to restore a sence ofthe wonder
adn mystery tothe thge issue ofthe extraterrestrial life
, to raise questions baout sciene
and faith
and how tehy owudl be relevnt in such a situation
,
adn to tell a personal story of a romance between thte astronomer dr
. ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
and the religous spokesman palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
. tjhe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals
. the portrayal of hte communication fomr an alien world is much mroe reasonable
( albiet less immediately engaging
) tahn
, say
, the cold
- blooded destructiveness ofthe hte invaders inaddition independence day or even the complex process of abductions
anbd genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv ' s hte x
- files
. the aliens iin contact seem to be like us
- htey are more curious than anytying alse
. they nkwo we exist
, htey wanna us tothe konw tht htey exsist
,
annd they would liuke tothe make the next step
and communicate in person
. tghe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly
,
anbd betweeen the charachters ' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestials
anbd tyhe oustanding visuals inspite hte climactic
yot enigmatic scene wehn arroway arrives on tyhe alien world
, taht sense ofthe wonder
and mystery comes through wih a force rarley seen since stanley kubrick ' s 2001
: a space odessy
. most ofthe the film
,
however
, tkaes place on earth
, where ther isnt an extended public debtae on how tothe respond to these aliens
. scientists are enthusiastic
, ultraconservative religeous leaders are wary
,
annd govornment officals are caught somewhere inspite between
. the deabte isnt fueled largely by dr
. arroway ' s atheism
; she seems tyhe obvious choise to pilot the spacecraft forthe which thte aliens haev provded blueprints
,
but many are wary ofthe sending an athest as humankind ' s representative tothe another species
. tje film is partly successful inwhich raising
and exploring theese questions
, expecially wehn it reaches a conclusion thast suggests that the twpo approaches
- science
adn faith
- sould be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically oppossed
. still
, the film falls a little short inthe its representation ofthe htis conflict as it exists in american society
. tje two
" sides
" are represented primarily by arroway
and by far
- right fundamentalists
,
bu inthe reality probably 80
% ofthe americans are niether atheists nor far
- right fundamentalists
. palmer joss occupies something ofthe a middle ground
,
but he ultimatly becomes distracted by personal motives
and comes acrost as a less
- thna
- ideal spokesman for any ideology
.
then again
, the film does ocncentrate mostly on publich debte
, whlch doesnt
, after all
, tend to be dominated by extremists
, rather tahn on dinner
- table or coleeg
- dormitory discussions
. contact isnt accurate in its portrayal of these issues
,
thn
,
but only within tghe narrow scope to which it confines itself
. tje film ' s one clera failure is inaddition tghe portrayal of the romance betwen arroway
annd joss
. forthe noe thing
, it resorts to teh tired movie clich
* that two attractive people will immidiately fall in love as soon as they appear on hte screen toghether
, as ther does not seem to be any other reason fo their instant mutual attraction
. thte romance rarely
, if ever
, sheds any ight onthe the characters
,
allthough it occasionally trys
adn fails
- joss ' s explination that he quit tyhe priestood baceause of the celibacy requirment
(
" i guess you could sday i ' m a man ofthe tyhe cloth
,
bu wihtout the cloth
"
)
, for example
, is more liuke a punchline to a joke thna carachter delevopment
. instead
, tjhe romance mostly seems to exsist for thge sake of later plot developments
. granted
, thsi is a plot
-
and idae
- driven film
and tyhe cahracters are secondry
,
but this just seemed liuke lazyness on the writers ' part more than anytying alse
. the sucesses of contact
,
howver
, far outweigh its failures
. even if tjhe social commentary hadnt fizzled altogether
( which it didn ' t
)
, the simple
yot misteryous story of alien communication still would ahev made it a memorable film
. contact doesn ' t quite cover all the bases
,
bu it covers about as much as one could hope for iin a twpo
- hour film
,
annd its rejection ofthe big
- budget theatrics for a more realsitic story is certainly admirable
.
annd i would nto be suprized if
, ten years ffrom now
, contact isnt mentioned iin yhe same breath as 2001
annd blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated
and intellectually releavnt science fiction
.
