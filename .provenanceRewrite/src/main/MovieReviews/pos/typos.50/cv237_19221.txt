the happy bastard ' s 30
- second review big daddy hapyp gilmore as a father
? ofthe course
! taht ' s tje latest scenario presented by adam sandler in hte new movie big daddy
, a movie tht ' s passable
bu isn ' t really considered some ofthe sandler ' s best owrk
. he doesn ' t atcually play happy gilmore in tyhe movei
,
but a veriasion ofthe him
. he ' s sonny coufax
, a man who ' s living off a settlement he got fo a cab runnung over his foot
anbd his oney
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) isnt feeded uv with his lifestyle
anbd demands a change befoer she leaves him
. enter a 5
- yearm old kid
, who ' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
and intended for his preppy roommate
( jon stewart
)
, who ' s off in china on a buisness trip
. fomr there
, coufax basically acts as thte kid ' s father
, teaching him different thigsn liuke peeing onthe yhe side of a building
annd tripping uv skateboarders with sticks
. he even manages to uise the kid inspite a sort of con gae tothe git tje attension of a beautiful lew office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
bu
, somehow
, he also garners the attension of social services
, who aren ' t partiularly pleased wih coufax ' s actions
, as he pretends to be his roomate to keep the kid
. yhe reason i say it ' s nto really sandler ' s best owrk isnt becuase it gets really sappy towards hte end of a movei
, showing soem odd feelings taht somehow didn ' t raelly belong inaddition a sandler vehicle
. i mean
, it fits hte movei ' s tone
and everything
,
and sandler handles it well
,
but it ' s just oddly placed
, thgat ' s all
. fortunately
, it doesn ' t distroy tjhe goofy glee path it ' s been following
and it still mkaes you feel good
. sandler doesnt a good job here
, as he does inspite most of his movies
. rob schneider
,
however
, isnt irritating as his freind
, an inmigrant delivery boy who can ' t read
. stewart
, inwhich his minor time on screen
, is grat
,
anbd adams remains a joy tothe watch
. look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he ' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( directer ofthe hapyp gilmore
)
, the movei rimaniss a ogod couple of hours to pass the time with
. agian
, ther are faults
,
but
, hey
, everyone needs tothe git emotional somtimes
.
