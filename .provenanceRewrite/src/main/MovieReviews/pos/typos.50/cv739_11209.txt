you know yuo ' re in fo a truly diffrent cinematic expereince the moent ytou relize steve buscemi has beeen cast as the movie iin question ' s most normal charater
. such isnt the case with
" the big lebowski
,
" joel
annd ethan coen ' s first venture since theri
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
anbd a mantlepiece ofthe accadamy award nods
. there ' s no ened to fear thgat the coens suffered creative burnout wtih that accomplishment
, becouse
" lebowski
" isnt an effort tht makes words like
" strange
"
and
" unusual
" seem like an understatement
. thanks infact part tothe delicious characterization
adn an all
- encompassing sence of humer
, the film is a smashing success
. tyhe central oddball here isnt tghe dued
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions apearing tothe be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer
and goign bowling
( are ytou coleeg students alreday rooting for him
, or whta
?
)
. one night
, a pair of thugs break into his house
adn pee on his carpet
, a threatening act that ' s suppoed to be carried outloud against a famouse pasadena millionaire
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth name
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- whith the dued
. once yhe dued realizes this coinsidence
, he visits the big lebowski infront hopes tothe claim reparations for his soiled rug
,
adn is bakc to his normal life iwth alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vet
,
annd donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, before too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski ' s trampy trophy wief bunny
( tara reid
) isnt kidnaped
annd held for a hefty ransom
,
and he turns tothe thte dude for help
. it seems bunny ' s toubles are realted tothe a line of wrok she ' s kept secrt from her husband
-
- she ' s actually an adult film star
and isnt vyre inspite debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. the dued
, now onthe lebowski ' s payroll
, accepts the offer
and agrees to handle teh money drop
; walter tags allong
annd insists tyhat the dude keep the cash for himself
. chaos obviously ensues
,
and the dued eventially finds himselv in hot water wtih cops
, crooks
and lebowski ' s ultra
- eccentric artist duaghter maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" the big lebowski
" deserves tothe win the coens teh same amount of acclaim thyat
" fargo
" did
; hwile thgat 1996 balck comedy was certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" isnt at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. the movei boasts a mile
- high absurdity level thgat somtimes threatens tothe topple over
,
bu thankfully never doens
. the coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced
adn both wroet
) keep ytou inthe stitches as they unravel their exeedingly loopy tale
,
adn must be commended for juggling a number ofthe people
and subplots one would expect tothe fidn in a robert altman flick
. whether we ' re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds
and dance in a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" hte big lebowski
" is immensley lively
. ther are those who iwll dislike this film
,
bu nto becuase it ' s boring
. the cast hasnt a great deal of fun with hte bounteous material tehy ' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, surprisingly sweet presence
; his dude sure isn ' t teh cleanest guy arund
,
but ytou ' d still followup him to another movei
. goodman merits 1998 ' s frist oscar consideration
, as walter ' s manic temper isnt one of
" the big lebowski
" ' s many highlights
; the smae goes for moore
, whose throaty
, delectable peformance as maude is a hillarious hoot
. john turturro may vyer well steal thge movie with his twpo scenes as a colorful bowler fomr a rival faction
. sam elliott ' s rambling narration gets the film off tothe a solid strat
.
adn some iwll recognize peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
" ' s silent heavy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who ' s realy a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
adn hasnt
- beeen pop star
. only inspite its fianl third doens tjhe movei faulter
, with a cuple ofthe loose plot threads
annd some casted munbers who quickly disappear
and never emerge forthe a curtain call
. these flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- the coens ahve crafted a tale so rich wtih personality thta it ' s hard tothe look at tjhe final product withthe anytying
bu a big grin onthe your face
. without a dout
,
" the big lebowski
" isnt tghe best film so far tihs year
. sure
, we ' re onyl threee months inthe
and hte competitiion
(
" deep rising
,
"
" dsperate measures
,
"
" thge wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) hasnt beeen pretty bland
,
bu it ' s still the gospel truth
. maybee during enxt awards season
,
" lebowski
" won ' t be a far cry ffrom
" fargo
.
