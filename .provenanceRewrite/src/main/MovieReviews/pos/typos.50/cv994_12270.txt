,
then this film is definetly forthe ytou
. it isn ' t the most original premise inwhich thge world
,
bu it is handeled preety well here
,
anbd pretty quicklyu for that marter
( a speedy 90 mintues
)
. i tihkn one of thte main reasons tihs film worked for me isnt the groundbreaking performence by mark wahlberg
( of boogie nights infamy
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. he completely captured all tyhe goodness
,
and badness
, of the main charactor ofthe this film
,
and alwasy kept me wanting tothe see more
adn omre of him
( his performence scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience
, as
" best villian
" at the 1997 mtv movie awards
)
. teh sountrack is allso very effective in this setting
,
and of course
, teh slutty performence by alyssa milano is something we sould all indulgue inspite
( look forthe the nice bikini
anbd butt shots
.
.
. if you ' re inot that kind ofthe thing
, that isnt
:
)
. i didn ' t much care for the father
/ david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived
,
but for the most part
, i was really inot this movei
.
then agian
, daddy dearest doed have one of tyhe coolest lines inthe tje movei wehn his wief isnt asking him what thte
" big deel
" wass about his daughter dating david
. his reply
:
" teh big deal is that the guy gives me thge creeps
,
annd the girl isnt my daughter
.
" ogod point
. all in all
, thte movie kicked soem fun ass
, mindless as it was
,
adn effectively demonstrated every pparent ' s worst nightmare
. mind you
, i still cin ' t tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag
,
bu hey
, life goes onthe
.
annd onthe a personel note
, we finaly desided tothe add smoe taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual
