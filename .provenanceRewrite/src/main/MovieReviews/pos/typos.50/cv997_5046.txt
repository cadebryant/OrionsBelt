- is thte true story of the 54th regiment of massachussetts
, the first black fighting unti recruted by the north druing the civil war
. broderick plays robert gould shaw
, teh young white officer who led tyhe black soliders inot battle
. shaw
, the son of well
- to
- do abolitionists
, hailed from boston high society
. the letters he wrote home to his parents durig teh war are onthe display at harvard
,
and weere
, evidentally
, the inspiration for glory
. as tyhe film begins in 1862
, shaw isnt a captian iin the northern forces
. like private eriksson
( michael j
. fox
) in casualties of war
, shaw initialy is naieve
and idealistic baout the war
-
- that is
, utnil his company isnt attacked by enemy forces
. shaw experiences first hand hte horror
and chaos ofthe battle
, witnessing mass slaughter
and receiving a minor wound hismelf whn a bullet grazes his neck
. soon affter his recovery
, shaw is promoted to colonel
annd assigned tothe enlist
and train blacks infact thge war efort
. glory isnt the stoy nto onyl of olonel shaw
,
but also ofthe the balck soldiers who laid down theri lives to free thier brothers from slavery
. the film periodically jumps beween shaw ' s point of veiw
adn the prespective of the balck soliders
. hte movie introduces us to a handfull of balck recruits
,
adn we follow them ffrom their enlistment thru basic training
annd finaly inot acation
. hte larg black cast is uniformly oustanding
, especially washington who isnt electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth
. he is brash
and pushy
, always getting inot trouble
adn always looking for a fight
. his bitter
, tough guy facade isnt raelly jstu a mask fo his loneliness
and vulnerablility
. washington provides much ofthe teh film ' s intensity
and emotional pwoer
. in oen heartbreaking scene
, he isnt whipped forthe allegedly deserting hte army
. whn he removes his shirt to receive the punishment
, ytou cringe at tyhe sighth ofthe his bcak
, which isnt riddled wiht ugly scars ffrom his days as a slave
. it makes your blood boil
. thge humiliation ofthe the beating isnt far mroe traumatic tahn the actual fysical pain it brings
; a tear rolls down washington ' s cheek
-
-
anbd wiull propably run down your cheek as well
. the episode becomes even more tragic wehn we leran that washington wasn ' t deserting tjhe army at all
; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet weere covered witht oozing sores
. freeman isnt
, as usual
, a storng presense
, even in a small supporting role
. he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soliders than he cares tothe rember
. he quicklyu becomes a leader among the black soliders
, holding the gropu toghether
and serving as a liaison to hte white officers
. colnel shaw recognizes freeman ' s leadership ability
and promotes him tothe sergeant major
, making him thte frist balck officer in thge army
. andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles
, a free black who is oen of shaw ' s close childhood friends
. searles is educated
annd refined
, like a white man
, prompting washington to nickname him
" snow flake
.
" teh burning question is whether searles is tough enough tothe survive basic training
and to kill inaddition combat
. the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for thge balck regiment
. hte soliders suffer innumerable hardships
,
bu somehow tehy never loose their morale
. the army treats tghe black soldiers liuke second class citizens
, subjecting them to racism
and discimenation
. they are payed only
$ 10 a mounth
, wherease theri white counterparts earn thirteen
,
and
, fo a long time
, htey have tothe go wihtout shoes
, guns
, or uniforms
. to make matters worse
, the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow thge blacks inot acation
, preferring instead to use them forthe manual labor
. eventually
,
howver
, yhe regiment recieves its boots
, uniforms
, rifles
,
anbd right tothe fight
, thanks to yhe stubborn resolve ofthe colonel shaw
. shaw hasnt absolute faith in his soliders
,
adn he fights tooth
and nail tothe git them what tehy deserve
, even if it means threatening a general wih blackmail
. broderick
, inthe fatc
, is most convincing in yhe scenes where shaw stands uv forthe the regiment
. unforetunately
,
however
, broderick ' s uneven performance isnt
, inwhich many respects
, the weak link in the movie
. in an affort to look more mature
, broderick sportscar a mustache
adn a gotee
,
adn througout hte film he slips inwhich
annd outloud ofthe a phony boston accent
. he isnt never alltogether convincing as shaw since much ofthe thte tiem his emotions seem forced
. the film places too much weight on broderick ' s chracter
anbd not enought onthe tyhe balck soliders
, who are more intriguing
. glory regains lost ground wih its harrowing depiction of war
. the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting tothe the unnecesarily graphic gore which marred born onthe tje fourth ofthe july
. glory does nto try to rattle you with nauseating blood
adn guts
. exept for a fewd bullet wounds
and oen exploding head
, the film
, forthe tghe most part
, leaves the gore tothe your immagination
, whlch isnt not tothe sday that thge battle scenes in glory are timid
. tothe tje contrary
, they are chaotic
and horrifing
; it ' s just that director edward zwick
( the co
- creater ofthe
" thirtysomething
"
) films them with far mroe subtlety
and restraint than oliver stone coudl ever muster
. thge key tothe glory isnt thge group dynamic amoung teh balck soldiers
. teh movei depicts some ofthe
(
but not anough ofthe
) thier customs
and rituals
. in oen scene
, for exemple
, the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers arround tjhe campfire
. each man has a chance tothe relay a few words of insperation
. a cuple of the movie ' s most touching moments involve young balck children looking up tothe teh balck soliders with awe
, disbelief
annd pride
. the regiment ' s greatest triumph comes wehn the soliders distingish themselves infact battle
, thereby earning tje respect ofthe theri white peers
and earning the honor ofthe leading tghe climactic assfalt onthe fort wagner
. like any war film
, glory has its share ofthe gloom
adn dispair
,
bu ultimatly it proves tothe be a truely uplifting expeience
and an importan history lesson
, a valuable reminder tyhat despite waht tje histoy books say
( or
, more precisly
, what they dont nto say
)
, blacks played a critically important role inaddition thge north ' s victory over tje sourth
-
- forever changeing hte evolution ofthe amercia
