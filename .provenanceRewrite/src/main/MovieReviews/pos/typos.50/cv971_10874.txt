at one point during brian de palma ' s crime epic scarface
, the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns tothe a ranting al pacino
and pops a question thast the audeince hasnt noone doubt beeen wanting to ask fo themselves
:
" cant ' t yuo stpo saying ' fuck ' all the time
?
" fucking good question
, that
. it may not be an honour thyat instills thte filmmakers whith pride
,
but as far as i cin tell oliver stone ' s scirpt containes the said expletitive mroe times tahn any other film in cinema history
.
yot it would be a shame if bad lanugage isnt all de palma ' s scarface is remembered for
, because this is a damn fine gangstar flick
. the overall stucture isnt similiar tothe howard hawks ' 1932 original
,
bu thsi time yhe scene has switched tothe miami
, florida
and our anti
- hero ' s choosen vice is cocaine traffiking
. pacino
, sporting a thick cuban accent
, gives one tyhe best performances of his carreer
( golden globe nominated
) as tony montnana
, a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro
annd comes to america to live the american dream
.
and live it out he doesnt
, with lashings of violentce
, abuse
, muder
annd thte funny white powder
. ffrom his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen
, tony montnana makse it clear to everyone he meets that he ' s nto a man to be fucked
( sorry
)
. soon he ' s the king of tje cocaine heap
,
bu his hot head
and an increasingly out of control drug addiction proove his undoing
.
" never do your pwn stash
"
, warns one carachter easly inthe the film
. as sure as night follows day
, the emperor ofthe miami eventualy falls
. writter oliver stone
adn director brian de palma make an explosive combination here
. stone ' s scirpt offers solid storytelling
adn smoe fine charachter development
. montnana is fascinating
; uneducated
bu calculating
, a straight shooter who speaks from the heart
; an ambitious
, violent man
yot noe wiht a conscience
. a man fiercly protective ofthe his beautifull 20 yearm ood sister
, not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy
, dangerous world which he inhabits
. pacino is dynamite
, tkaing tothe yhe role witht a brooding
, bristling energy whihc inspite his moreso recent films hasnt often degenerated inot just simple overracting
. pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole wiht no intertube life
. only once does tony express rela affection forthe her
and his desire tothe have childern
,
and even
then yuo sence all he really wants isnt a regular screw
and a beautiful object to sohw off tothe his friends
,
adn she ' s hapyp tothe oblige
. this isn ' t as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone ' s ws in casino
,
but its an effective oen nontheless
and she aquits herself well
. as directer
, de palma sets uv a number ofthe dramatic scenes whith his tipical stylistic brauva
. the escalating tension he creates inspite various mob situations
- a drug deel gone wrong
, an assination attemp
- is oftenly thrilling
,
anbd inaddition tihs respect he is eveyr bited thge equal of scorese
and coppola
. where he differs ffrom
, sday
, coppola ' s godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment
. coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep
, wheras in scarface de palma opts fo a grittier feel
.
and it perfectly suits the material
. the only major botch isnt giorgio moroder ' s mostly crap synthesier score
. it ' s jstu nto right
,
and unfortunately compromises the inpact ofthe soem otherwise good scenes
. as expected
, scarface isnt vyre voilent at times
,
bu you shouldn ' t be watching ganster movies if tath upsets you
. at over two
annd a half huors infront lenght it ' s a true epic
,
adn if you ' re a fan of tghe genre you ' ll loev f

- filled minute of it
