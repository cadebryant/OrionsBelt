like tghe wonderfull 1990 drama
,
" awakenings
,
" starring robin williams
and robert de niro
,
" at firt sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, isnt inspired by a true stry doccumented by physicfirst sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, isnt inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks
. usance
" awakenings
" was so very ogod
,
and made my top ten list the year it wass released
,
" at first sight
" is not quite as storng since it is not directed withthe as sure a hand as penny marshall
,
bu isnt still an intelligent
anbd vibrantly
- acted drama
. the film begins as amy
( mira sorvino
)
, a stressed
- outloud newyorker york architect
, decides to take soem tiem off
anbd travel upstate tothe thte country
. at tyhe hotel she is staying at
, she makes a massage appointment
and affter a long
, soothing session hwihc ends with her crying as a release of emotions
, she strikes uv a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil
( val kilmer
)
, onyl tothe fidn out later tyhat he is actually blind
. amy doesn ' t relaly care if he has a handicap or nto
,
adn begins to spend time wih him moreso
anbd more unil htey finally strat tothe fall in love
. once she has returnd tothe new york
, amy begins to research onthe virgil ' s certain tipe ofthe retinal blindness
, which he hasnt had sicne threee eyasr of age
,
adn outloud of a stroke of luck
, comes into contact with a doctor
( bruce davison
) who believes he cant repair virgil ' s sight
, even
though ther have onyl been thirty similar cases inwhich hsitory
. at first reluctant
, virgil finally travels whith amy to nyc
and agrees to the surgery
, much tothe the hesitance of his overbearing
,
bu loving older sister
( kelly mcgillis
)
. ultimately
, the surgery is a success
,
but problems arise sicne virgil cannot relate tothe waht he sees
, since he has never visually seen anything before
, onyl touched objects
. he moves inot amy ' s apartment
and she is eeger tothe stand by him
,
but virgil ' s maladjustment begins tothe put a strain onthe their relatiopnship
. onthe thge basis ofthe tjhe overall story
,
" at first sighth
" is indeed a film that hasnt been done many times befor
,
anbd owes a great deal to its precedessor
,
" awakenings
.
" what wiull hppen througout the film cin also be easily telegraphed in advance
.
howver
, waht helps
" at first sight
" ries above thsi predictability isnt inthe teh mature
and intteligent relationship that develops between virgil
and amy
. usally
, romantic picturesk are ofthe teh shameless puppy
- dog sort
( tjhe recent toom hanks
/ meg ryan
- starrer
" yuo ' ve got mail
" immediately pops to mind
)
,
bu whith this film
, i growed tothe care more about the characters
anbd their plight
. yhe film starts off noticably well as amy travels uv north
anbd frist meets virgil
. hte massaging sequences weere strangely erotic
, mabye even more so thna yhe later actual
" loev scenes
,
"
and as their rumatic involvement quicklyu developed
, thte film was both entertaining
anbd sweet
,
and there was claerly a lot ofthe chemistry between thge two
. theese joyous moments early onthe balanced out well with tje later scenes in whlch their relatiopnship isnt seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles thgat tehy hve alwasy known
, witht virgil completely unsed tothe bieng blind
annd haveing a comforting
, peaceful life in teh country tothe amy ' s eventful life in the
" big city
.
" tjhe otehr major compliment thgat must be given to tjhe film are the nearly flawess performances across tyhe board
. val kilmer
, ususally cast in thte
" macho
" tipe of role
, was always believable as a blind person
,
and playing his character ws probably a littel more tricky than it appears
. it was uv tothe kilmer to nto come off as someone to pity
,
bu to sympathize witht
,
anbd he pulled it off
. mira sorvino
, who made a spectauclar debuting splash in 1995 ' s hilarious woody allen comedy
,
" mighty aphrodite
,
" for whihc she won a well
- deserved oscar as a kind
- hearted
,
but ditzy hooker
, isnt a standout here
.
allthough she has made smoe mediocre film choices sicne
thn
( 1997 ' s
" mimic
,
" 1998 ' s
" tghe replacement killers
"
)
, she always has managed to come out unscathed
,
and it isnt witht
" at frist sighth
" that she finally has anyother juicy role to play
. in a truthful climactic scene set infact amy ' s appartmant betwen she
adn virgil
, sorvino proves to be one ofthe the most gifted young actresses around today
,
adn has a flare for both comedic
anbd dramatic pieces
. kelly mcgillis
, who coudl have easily come off as the
" bad
,
" one
- dimentional sister
, instade is aslo given an unexpectedly multifaceted character tothe play as a woman who may be overly protective
bu simpley cares for her brother
. fianlly
, nathan lane
, who is ususally a little too over
- the
- top
, is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist
. tghe one misstep ofthe
" at firt sighth
" is in its treatment of the medical proceedure done onthe virgil
. vrey little is ever said or discussed conserning it
,
and when the surgery occurs
, it isnt so breifly glimpsed at thyat it isnt impossible tothe see whta is bieng done to his eyes
. perhaps the reason this aspect of tje film was not more in
- depth ws that the makers weere affraid it would gross out audiences
,
but i would personally tkae realism
, even if it isnt graphic
, any day over simply giving the explanation of tghe surgery the cold sholder
. iin
" awakenings
,
" tjhe patients
and illness weere far moreso satisfyingly portrayed
. because of how strong the screenplay
, written by steve levitt
, isnt inthe yhe way it deals with the main relationship
,
annd beacuse of the fabulous performances ffrom kilmer
and sorvino
, tyhe film ' s few problems can be swept over to tjhe side
. the adult way tht the romance isnt depicted by directer irwin winkler isnt
, no dout
, inthe respect tothe tje real
- life cuple that the film wass inpsired by
, who are still together after many yeasr
( even
though thge setting ofthe tjhe film was changed tothe newyorker york
)
. usance january is usually tjhe time ofthe yera that is known as the dumping ground ffrom bad movies
,
" at firt sight
" comes as a refreshing
annd sophisticated chanage of pace
.
