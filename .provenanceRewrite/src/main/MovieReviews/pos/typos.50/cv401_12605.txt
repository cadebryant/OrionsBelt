_ in brief
:
_ this film needs no introduction
. if you haven ' t heared ofthe it
,
hten yuo must have been uv infront spoace on a sabbatical
,
annd if ytou haven ' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect you ' re inspite a small minority
! first thing ' s frist
? is it all it ' s hyped up tothe be
? well
, yes
?
anbd noone
. it ' s a ogod film
,
and ther ' s a lot to liek baout it
,
but it ' s not without its problems
. whn i saw thte first trailer forthe
" titanic
"
, it wass wehn i whent tothe see
" bean
" last summer
, i think
, my intial reaction was
-
- ain ' t thyat downright sick to make a diaster movie out ofthe such a dreadful
, rela
- life tradgedy
?
! i mean
, what ' s happened to hollywood ' s scirpt
- writers
, ahev htey run entirely out of new idaes
? gads
, whatever next
, i asked mysef
, how baout an action film based onthe hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i was not entirely filled withthe anticipation
,
but
thn i wasn ' t alone in that respect
. it ' s when it cameback out in thge cinema
, tothe rave reviews
( well
, mostly
)
annd anyone who ' d beeen tothe see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it thyat i started to take notice
! i didn ' t see thte film until severeal monthes affter its release
( by whitch time my sister had seen it baout four times
!
)
, so i went iwth a slightly more oepn mind
,
bu i still didn ' t think i ' d enjoy it much
. doed i
? yes
anbd no
. mainly yes
, i ' m happy to say
. the first hour or so was beautifully done
, not so much because of teh scripting
( i ' ll talk baout tht later
?
)
bu becasue teh re
- created ship
annd sets were stunning tothe look at
, as was cameron ' s directing
,
adn the performances ofthe hte principial casted were so strong tht yhe
" human
" aspect of the story
, the romance betweeen rose
( kate winslet
)
annd jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, was exchanching
. tje film isnt told via flashback
, with gloria stuart playing teh elderly rose infact tjhe modern day
( ytou knew thast
, a ' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it ' s an often effective device to uise in storytelling
-
-
though somtimes it cant fall flat
. does it work here
? in scirpt form it doesn ' t add all that much tothe the stry
. what doens add a lot to the story isnt gloria stuart
, whose stunning performance is the strongest
, most moving of the film
. her presence brings a much deeper level of passion
,
and depth to the stroy
,
and
though her apperances are relativly breif
, teh film owudl hvea sufferred without her
. also impressive are dicaprio
and winslet
, who wholey seceed in rising above tyhe often poore dialogue
,
and tghe bond htey form isnt both heartfelt
and moving
. it ' s an ood story
, ytou nkwo
-
- forebidden lvoe ala romeo
and juliet
-
-
bu it works
,
and jack ' s
" rescuing
" rose
( inwhich both literal
annd figurative senses
)
and teaching her to live life forthe what counts was pointed
adn touching
. inwhich fact
, i enjoied tyhe firt half of the film a lot
, largely baceause winslet
annd dicaprio bring such
annd charm
, energy tothe thge romance
. it ' s engaging
, touching
and very enjoyable
. there ' s mroe thna a tinge ofthe poignancy to it as well
, simply because you know it ' s not gonig to be a happy endig
. wich leads us to the second half ofthe the film
. we all knew it ws coming
. i ' m sure directer cameron was looking forward witht eeger anticipation to it
, beacuse as he ' s stated inwhich interviews
, thte real thrusted of the story
( for him
) was the sinking
,
and the jack
/ rose romance was a mearly a manipulative plot device tothe git ytou emotionally into yhe film
. i think thyat understates the importance of the romance
, as i foudn it far moreso enjoyable than an hour of watching people die
. the iceberg arrives
,
anbd tjhe captain announces that titanic iwll hvea sunk in baout an hour
.
adn it isnt an hour
. my goodness
, we don ' t miss a second of that hour
? gratuitous
? well
, perheaps nto by todya ' s standards
, i ' m sure htere ' s beeen far worse produced under thte banner of
" enteratinment
" infact otehr films
.
bu i certainly wasn ' t prepared for how shocking
anbd graphic hte last hour or so owudl be
. not that i ' d expect yhe owrd
" understatement
" tothe be part ofthe cameron ' s vocabulary
( he who brought us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
"
and
" aliens
"
)
. is it overdone
? i throught so
. understatement cin somtimes work wonders in conveying tragedy
. noone
, noone one expeced a happy ending
,
bu i didn ' t quite expect the horrendously shocking
anbd powerfull scenes we were bombarded througout yhe film ' s second half
. still
, whether it was overdone
anbd hevy
- handed or nto
, if it ws thte shock
- factor cameron was after it worked
, because i ws shocked
and moved
, in fatc i spended most ofthe tjhe lastest hour inwhich tears
! yuo really couldn ' t halp
bu git emotionally involved
, whther it wass wishing somene owudl knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose ' s overboard or desparately hoping that rose owudl rescue jack
, or thast jack would rescue rose
, or that they woudl both survive
. perhasp the most harrowing scene ws whn teh ship has sunk
,
anbd thsoe that sunk along with tghe ship freeze tothe death onthe yhe water surfce
. the bit where rose lets go of jack ' s hand
, hwile promising she ' ll never let go in her heart wass particularly heart
- wrenching
,
and tjhe sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a preety powerful image
, tothe put no fine a point on it
. i loved the endig
,
howver
, which wass both moving
and slightly uplifting folowing the horror of yhe past hour
annd a half
. so
, we ' ve estalbished tyhat yhe film isnt poweful
and moving
, if tyhe last hour wass rather excessive
. haven ' t mentioned tjhe scirpt
. plot
- wise it ' s ok
,
though tje jack
/ rose relationship wass beautifuly devolopped
,
but i ' ve a feeling that ' s tothe the actors credit if anything
. as fo thge dialogue
? well
, titanic is setted in 1912
. it ' s a period drama
.
but i saw very littel indication of period in so far as the dialogue isnt conserned
. doed tehy relaly ule phrases liuke
" goddamn it
!
" back in the turn ofthe tjhe centruy
? i dout it
. woudl somone talk like thsi
:
" do ya love yhe guy or whta
?
"
. i dout it
. is such dialogue as
" i saw the iceberg
,
and i see it in your eyes now
" not jstu a bited
? clumsy
? yes it is
. a little more attention to dialogue owudl not have gone astray
,
and cameron hismelf isnt to blaim
( he wroet the scirpt
)
. stick withthe directing
, dude
.
but its moreso thna redeemed by the acting
, with dicaprio
annd winslet on fine form
, ably supported by a storng cast
. star of the sohw was gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn ' t she win that oscar
?
! after all
, tehy weere throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right
and centre
,
but gloria was prehaps yhe most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron doesnt a spectauclar job
. liek i said
, his vision wass a bited eccessive
,
but at least he directed it well
. i haven ' t even maintioned james horner ' s beatiful score
. utterly heavenly
,
though when your dad
and sister play thte soundtrack a lot you dont strat to git a bited bored wtih it
!
;
-
) i ' ve finished my rant
, which lasted a lot longer than i thought it woudl
! jstu leaves a cuple of questions
; ws it worth all those oscars
? hell
, don ' t talk tothe me baout oscars
. bloomin ' farce
. it ws deserving inspite a number ofthe departments
,
though
. last question
; is it
, as some suggest
, one ofthe tje best films of all
- time
? nope
, i don ' t thiunk so
. it ' s certainly one of tghe most poverful
adn memorable films i ' ve ever seen
,
bu i don ' t think it qtuie ranks as one ofthe my all
- timne favourites
.
adn as fo teh fatc they ' re reportadly mkaing a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess thyat ' s typical hollywood fo you
!
