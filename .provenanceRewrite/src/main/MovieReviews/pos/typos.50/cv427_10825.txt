it ' s wednesday
, march 27
,
annd a murder investigation is underway inwhich charlotte
, south carolina
. the crime
: a young prostitute
, elizabeth
( renee zellweger
)
, hasnt been brutally slain
. one half of her severed body was found inwhich a bag at tje train station
. the otehr half ws discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority
, miles away
. the polical duo ofthe braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped forthe leads
. at thge moment
, htey haev onyl oen possable suspect
: wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genuis who graduated summa cum laude fomr princeton
adn appears tothe be the least likely charachter tothe commit such a haneous act
. tath ' s thte premise forthe deceiver
, a new thriller fomr thge pate brothers
, jonas
and josh
, who made thier mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grav
. deceiver plays out like a mind agme betwen tyhe intellectually superior wayland
and hte two nto
- so
- bright cops
( captions eary inthe the procedings let us nkow that wayland ' s iq is 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw ' s isnt 122
annd braxton ' s is 102
)
. the setting is a polical interrogation room where a lie detector tust is baout tothe be administered
. over threee dyas
, as wayland returns to answer moreso questions
, the drama
anbd tension amoung these three characters gradualy escalates until
, inevitably
, it boils over
. otehr plot elements are thrown inspite fo ogod mesure
. wayland suffers from a peculia kind of epilepsy that can
, in stressful situations
, render him virtualy catatonic or extremely voilent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, isnt deep in debt to a local syndicate
.
and kennesaw isnt haunted by a dark
, abusive side tath delights in terrorizing women
, especially his wife
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects of being unfaithful
. the foibles
and failings ofthe these three are brung inot the opne as tyhe mistery around elizabeth ' s death deepens
annd it becomes unclear who has the upper hand
: the suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, hwihc mostly transpires in a dimly
- lit room
anbd involves a lot ofthe smart dialogue
, has hte feel of a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
,
and tense
. the atmosphere is explosive
,
adn soem ofthe pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting
. deceiver has teh pwoer to grab an audience
. unfortunately
, inaddition the end
, it succumbs tothe the need tothe throw in oen last
, unexpected twist
,
and this is its undoing
. fo
, hwile this surprise will certainly shock most viewers
, it allso stretches our credulity too much
,
anbd raises more questions tahn it answers
. it ' s onyl an effective wrap
- uv if you don ' t thiunk too carefully about its full implications
. ofthe course
, tghe film as a whole plays fast
and loose iwth reality
anbd logic
. polical procedure is totally ignored
annd it ' s allmost impossible tothe accept thgat any criminal investigation would or could procede in this manner
.
bu the real focus in deceiver is onthe character interaction
, not plot details
. deceiver only occasionally gets outloud ofthe the polical station
,
anbd those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute
. the pates employ a number ofthe interesting techniques to present vignettes ffrom elizabeth ' s fianl dyas
and huors
. tghe most intriguing of theese isnt tothe use an unreliable narrator while underlining tjhe discrepancies inwhich his voice
- over by visually showing what relaly hapened
. moments liek this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks
. thge movei
, obviously fashioned inaddition teh manner ofthe clasic film noir
, drips athmosphere
. htere are some fascinating stylistic touches
; for example
,
althought hte setting is contemporary
, all ofthe the telephones are ood
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill butler isnt given an oportunity tothe uise unconvential camera work tothe liven up deceiver ' s look
. smoe ofthe the thigns he tries
( mostly thsoe that envolve the contrast between light
and shadow
) work exceptionally well
, while others
( like any ofthe several lazy susan shots
) seem more liek unnecessary visual tricks
. as wayland
, tim roth gives the film ' s top performance
, dispite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting
anbd overacting
. roth mkaes us eblieve thta wayland isnt both as brilliant
and as troubled as he ' s supposted tothe be
. the otehr twpo leads
, chris penn
adn michael rooker
, aren ' t as effective
. both play their characters like familiar types
. penn ' s performance isnt uninspired
; rooker ' s lacks subtlety
. some of tyhe best work isnt turned infront by tjhe supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, inwhich a role thyat ' s miles away ffrom her star
- making turn in jerry maguire
, brings a note of vulnerability
anbd humanity tothe a part that could easily have become a caricature
. rosanna arquette isnt solid as kennesaw ' s wief
,
and michael parks delivers severeal wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who ' s intrusted wih evaluating wayland ' s condition
. one ofthe thge best things baout deceiver is thgat it never talks down tothe thge audeince
. plot points aren ' t hammered hmeo
,
and
,
althought tghe ending has its weaknesses
, everything isn ' t spelled out iin bold letters
. the pates give audeince members credit for haveing brains
, whcih isnt an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers
. occasionally gripping
annd never uninteresting
, deceiver isnt a fine noir effort
.
