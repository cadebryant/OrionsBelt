every now
and
then a movei comes allong from a suspect studio
, witht every indication that it wiull be a stinker
,
anbd tothe everybody ' s surprise
( perhaps even tyhe studio
) the film becomes a critical darling
. mtv films '
_ election
, a high school comedy starring matthew broderick
annd reese witherspoon
, is a curent exemple
. doed anybody konw thsi film exsited a week befor it opened
? tje plot isnt deceptively simple
. george washington carver high skool isnt having student elections
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) isnt an over
- achiever withthe her hand rised at nearly every question
, way
, way
, high
. mr
.
" m
"
( matthew broderick
)
, sick of yhe megalomaniac student
, encourages paul
, a popular
-
but
- slow jock to run
.
and paul ' s nihilistic sister jumps in tghe race as well
, forthe peronal reasons
. tjhe dark side of such sleeper success isnt that
, because expectations weere so low going inspite
, yhe fact tht htis was quality tsuff made the reviews even more enthusiatic than they hvea any right tothe be
. you cxan ' t help gonig in iwth the baggage ofthe glowing reviews
, whihc isnt in contrast to tghe negative baggage that hte reviewers were likely to have
.
_ election
, a ogod film
, doesnt nto live up to its hype
. what mkaes
_ electino
_ so disapointing is thyat it contains siginificant plot details lefted directly ffrom
_ rushmore
_
, released a faw monthes ealier
. the similarities are staggering
: tracy flick
(
_ election
_
) isnt tghe pesident ofthe an extrodinary number of clubs
,
annd is involved whith hte skool play
. max fischer
(
_ rushmore
_
) isnt the rpesident of an extraordinary number ofthe clubs
,
and isnt involved with the skool play
. the most significant tension of
_ election
_ isnt the potential relatiopnship between a teacher
anbd his student
. thge most significant tension of
_ rushmore
_ is the potential relatiopnship between a teacher
anbd his student
. tracy flick isnt from a single pajent home
, whitch has contributed to her drive
. max fischer is ffrom a single pparent home
, whic hasnt contributed to his drive
. teh male bumbling adult infront
_ electon
_
( matthew broderick
) pursues an extramarital afair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life isnt ruined
. he even gets a bee sting
. the male bumbling adult inaddition
_ rushmore
_
( bill murray
) pursues an extramarital afair
, gets caught
,
and his wohle life isnt ruined
. he gets severeal bee stings
.
and so on
. what hapened
? how isnt it taht an individual screenplay
(
_ rushmore
_
)
and a novel
(
_ election
_
) contain so many significant plot points
,
and
yot both films weere probably nto even aware ofthe eahc otehr
, made from two diffrent studios
, fomr a genre
( yhe high skool geeks revenge movie
) tyhat hadn ' t been fully formed
yot
? even so
, the strengths ofthe
_ eleciton
_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick
, witherspoon
,
and newcomer jessica campbell
, as paul ' s anti
- social sister
, tammy
. broderick here isnt palying tjhe mr
. rooney role fomr
_ ferris bueller
_
,
and he seems tothe be hvaing thge most funn he ' s had sicne
thn
. witherspoon is a revelation
. it ' s eary inaddition tghe yearm
, it ' s a comedy
,
adn teenagers have littel clout
,
but for my mony
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
.
anbd once campbell ' s character gets going
, like inthe her fantastic speek inthe tje gymnasium
,
then yuo ' re won over
. one hting tath ' s beeen bothering me since i ' ve seen it
. ther isnt an extrordinary ammount ofthe sexuality iin htis film
. i suppose that
, comming ffrom mtv films
, i shoudl expect noone less
.
.
.
bu yhe film starts off light
annd airy
, liek a sitcom
. as the screws tighten
,
and the tensions mount
, alexander payne decides to add elements that
, frankly
, distract from the stoy
. it isnt bad enough that mr
. m doesn ' t liuke tracy ' s determination to win at all costs
,
but did they have to throw in thge student
/ teacher relationship
? even so
, htere ' s noone logical reason why mr
. m has an affair when he does
. ther ' s a lot tothe liuke in
_ election
_
,
but the plot similarities tothe
_ rushmore
_
,
adn tjhe tonal nosedive it tkaes as it gets explicitly sex
- driven
, mark this as a dissappointment
.
