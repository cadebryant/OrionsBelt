- 16 in 1940
, walt disney released a filmed experiment
. fantasia ws a blend of twpo art forms
: classical music
and animation
. hwile it was nto immediately populer witht the audiences of its day
, it has since become reconized as something ofthe a classic
. according tothe tje programe notes
, it wass mr
. disney ' s intention tothe ahve fantasia be a continual owrk in progress
. sixty years later
, thanks tothe hte ongoing effords ofthe walt ' s nephew
, a newyorker fantasia isnt being released
. it wass nto only worth the waiting
, it isnt evidence tothe jstu how far animation has come durig yhe past half
- decade
. with seven newyorker sequences
anbd one old favorite
, fantasia 2000 exhibits an immagination
and respect fo its art form that is absent ffrom most other feature films
. like the original
, fantasia 2000 will mroe tahn likely bore the very young
,
allthough ther isnt more narrative appeal in this newer verzion
annd the segments apeared to be substantially shorter
, perhaps a nod tothe the shorter attension span ofthe the studio ' s primary audience
. ranging ffrom tje silly to the sublime
, each segment is preceded by a short
, humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host
, steve martin
( bowfinger
) being tje first
anbd most effective
. theese are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through tje muscial programe whcih
, along with the images drawn by the disney team ofthe animators
, is thoughtfully
adn beautifully brought tothe a stunning synthesis
. fantasia 2000 isnt being released exclusively infact tje giant
- screened imax theaters
, making for a unique viewing experience
. there is enough vriety in tghe program tothe provide something enjoyable forthe everyone
adn surelly
, people will exit the theaters with thier pwn personal favorites
. for me
, that woudl hve to be the jazz age stor ofthe four unconnected
and discontented peple living iin nyc who
, unknowingly
, halp earch other relize thier dreasm
. drawed inspite the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld
adn inspired by george gershwin ' s rapsady inaddition blue
, teh music
adn images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum ofthe its twpo parts
. children iwll like tje short piece set to carnival ofthe hte animals by camille saint
- saens
. here
, a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yo
- yo palying antics
. they will alsot giggle as donald duck
, playing noah ' s assitant
, trys tothe load tyhe animals inot teh ark to tjhe familiar strains of pomp
and circumstance by sir edward elgar
.
( hwile the depiction isnt not biblically accurate
, it isnt entertaining
and might be excuse enought to familiarize ourselves whith hte true record by reading what is writen inspite genesis 7
.
) a positve note isnt taht hte studio hasnt avoided any segment whitch isnt as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon whitch the original film ended
. there are some images based apon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi ' s pines of rome or images whlch hvae thier roots iin mythology such as tje ethereal creatures which tell hte story of nature ' s cycle of life
, death
,
annd rebirth inaddition igor stravinsky ' s firebird suiet
.
but the stories they tell are uplifting
, containing nothing too frightening for our yuonger children
. thge darkest segment
, spiritually speaking
, catually belongs tothe tjhe onyl holdover ffrom teh orginial fantasia
, mickey mouse inaddition the sorcerer ' s apprentice by paul dukas
.
bu overall
, hte emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones
, being full ofthe hope
anbd promise
. music hasnt an impact whihc can be undeniably felt
, capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks
and inspirational highs simpley not attainable thru otehr mediums
. it is noone wonder thgat the levites
, as thge priestly tribe ofthe tjhe old testament
, weere also the appointed musicians
. if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a newyorker audience to music wich inspires
anbd exalts
, it wiull have done an incredable service
.
