it hasnt been 20 yersa sicne a terrence malick film hit theaters
. his newyorker film
, the thin red line
, is a stange
, beautyfull
, enigmatic mess ofthe a movie
. thte first thing that jumps outloud to one whn they see yhe advertisements forthe htis film isnt the huge cast
. it is filled wtih above
- the
- title stars
. the casted
, fo thte most part
, gives grat performances
. john travolta
, whose role isnt nothing more thna a cameo
, seems not tothe hve attacked his performence wih taht much verve
. george clooney
, whose role became a cameo in editing
, gives a stange performance
. noe wonders if he knew that his peformance woudl become teh object of ridicule through a character ' s narration
. tyhe rest of the cast
, expecially nick nolte
annd elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. theese actors
(
and htey are
, wih two exceptions
, men
) weere lured by the nmae ofthe malick
. terrence malick is a cinematic legend
. he hasnt often beeen called
" the j
. d
. salinger ofthe cinema
.
" his two previous films
, badlands
annd dyas of heaven
, are spectacularly beautiful
and obscure motion picturesk
. affter he made them
, he disappearred forthe 20 years
. htis film markes his return
. wqat he ' s made with the thin red line is a film taht seems less conserned iwth plot than witht tje emotion of tje moent
. the narration wich fills the film
(
annd perplexes many
) nto only lets us hear the narrators
( tjhe characters themselfs
) pontificate
,
but aslo lets us hear such of
- tghe
- moent thoughts as
" i ' m scared
.
" the rether simple plot ofthe the thin red line isnt used as a canvas onthe which many stories are painted
. thte plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill
. a plot synopsis for tjhe thin red line is difficult
, because the story isnt fractured
. many stories are here
, from tyhe clash between the lieuenant
( elias koteas
)
and tje savage oclonel
( a voracious nick nolte
) tothe the private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his love for the woman he left behind tothe keep him gogin
. the fracturing of teh stroy is ultimately a fault
. it isnt as if an artist spended an incredible amount ofthe time artfully sculpting tiny statues
and
then trew them into a box
, shook tje box
,
annd poured the results onto a tble
. thsi basically creates a mess
,
but the tsories cin be discerned
adn enjoied
. i ' m not declaring taht teh film hasnt no structure
. hwile saving private ryan utilisied warfare to bookend the plot
, malick uses reflection
anbd glorious shots ofthe nature to bookend about 90 mintues ofthe combat
. tghe battles in thte thin red line are astonishing
anbd display a mastery ofthe filmmaking
. the astounding cinematography in htis film must also be given notice
. htis film uses color
and light in such a fantastic way
, that it iwll be sad tothe see it degraded wehn it hasnt to bee transfered to video
. ultimatly
, malick has crafted a film that is a movie thast enjoys looking thru tghe treetops more tahn regarding tjhe war that rages below them
. the film is filled with nature photography
and tjhe regarding of nature
. while smoe have said that the anti
- war message
adn protem
- nature tubthumping was juvenile
, it was done with so much complexity
anbd thought
, that it cannnot ever honestly be called childish
. aftter seeing the thin red line
, i was haunted by it
anbd am qtuie ready to see it again
