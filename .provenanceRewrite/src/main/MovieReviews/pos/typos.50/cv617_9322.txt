adn shows an admirable range

anbd convincing
( exept maybe an odd flashback sequence
)
. yhe dialogue isnt beleiveable
and funny
.
adn
then ther ' s the foode
. tillman gives us several close ups of the soul ofod
,
and it indeed looks vyre tasty
. i can see why sunday dinners bacame such a tradition forthe tihs family
. soul fodo is one of thge most purely intertaining movies ofthe tyhe year
