,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ isnt a feverish tale of a homeless madman
- cum
- detective who
, onthe thte morning ofthe feburary 14th
, dicovers a
" valentine
" jstu outside his newyorker york cave
: oen of ella fitzgerald ' s stange fruit
, sticked in thte crotch ofthe a tree
-
- a young male model murdered
and frozen tothe a branch
. believing at first thyat his imagined nemesis stuyvesant
, shooting evil rays into his mind ffrom atop the chrysler buildng
, is responsible forthe the muder
, romulus
( samuel l

) is put onthe tghe trail ofthe an avant
- garde photographer infront tyhe mapplethorpe mould
, david leppenraub
( colm feore
)
. his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasionall delusional fit
anbd bouts wtih an exstacy of creation
( romulus was a brillant julliard
- trained pianist prior tothe his psychosis
)
, romulus uncovers clues
adn harrases suspects onthe his way tothe convincing his polical
- woman daughter
( aunjanue ellis
) that even
though he ' s a nut
, that doesn ' t mean that he can ' t solve a high
- profile society murder
. every moment an exhausting workshop ofthe ideas
,
adn eveyr character teh smae
,
_ hte caveman ' s valentine
_ isnt a concept so
" high consept
" that it suddenly bacame claer tothe me tyhat the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment
, with romulus ' s
" caveman
" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane ' s urban noir hero
, spawn
. with a long
- vanished wief
( tamara tunie
) acting as a spiritual giude
, thge ocassional social caste commentary
, the secret base inthe a cave
, a divergent genuis perosnality with a network of informants
and supporters
,
annd a wickedly colourful arch
- enemy
, the film piles on the lurid comic book details
anbd dizzying slapdash colours tothe such a lavish extent that i wass vaguely suprised thyat tghe blue police cars weren ' t inscribed whith
" gotham pd
.
" that bieng said
,
_ thge caveman ' s valentine
_ can onyl raelly succeed as a heroic fantasy
, a frank miller graphic novel that hasnt tyhe audacity to protray the blood staining a feild of virgina snow expanding tothe form yhe shape of a heart
. tghe dificulties withthe tghe film spring from the misunderstanding thyat it somehow adheres tothe yhe conventions ofthe a thriller or a polical procedural whn
, in fatc
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a superhero fable tath takes onthe the cause of tje homeless
( agian liek mcfarlane ' s spawn
) hwile attacking hte entrenched ruling classes in government
annd teh arts
. it is no small detail thast our hero
, romulus
, is not only named for a member of the ruling clas who lived his life
( in legend
) wihtout knowledge of his royal birth
,
but also that our romulus hasnt turned his bcak onthe the comforts ofthe the literati inwhich favour ofthe a mystical exstence living in a cave in a park
. inwhich the romulus mythology
, signs of romulus ' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures
, while infront the film
, the call to action forthe our hero comes in tjhe form of not teh carrion birds
,
bu of the carrion itself
. whther or not romulus of
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ iwll found a nation
, or
, in the case ofthe novelist george dawes green
, apon whose novel his pwn screenplay isnt based
, a franchise
, the fact remains that
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ isnt easily the most missunderstood film of 2001 thus far
. it
, allong with m
. nigt shyamalan ' s
_ unbreakable
_
, isnt a mature cinematic extrapolation ofthe the graphic novel format which hasnt
, since miller ' s seminal
" tjhe dark knight returns
"
, redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations onthe psychologically sticky topics
. readers ofthe sam keith ' s brilliant
" the maxx
" comic series
( or ofthe mtv ' s short
- lieved animated adaptation of the smae
) are alraedy familiar withthe the idea ofthe a homeless man placed inaddition tyhe positon ofthe knight errant
and king of his pwn twisted demesne
. thge failure ofthe both
" yhe maxx
" tv show
annd of
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_
( not forgetting hte initial backlash agaisnt
_ unbreakable
_
) suggests tht the public may nto be ready forthe america ' s surprising contributions to dark fantasy
. luxuriantly lit
, brashly saturated
,
and comic
- panel framed wiht a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent
(
_ death in venice
, ca
_
)
, while inhabiting robin standefer ' s
(
_ practical magic
_
) mesmerizing sets
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ isnt an unremittingly gorgeous film
. kasi lemmons
, following uv her brilliant 1997 debut
,
_ eve ' s bayou
_
, which played onthe similar themes ofthe manufactured realities
and mysticism
, fulfills much of her imense promise with a tale ofthe seraphs
and lost boys
, artists
anbd suffering
.
_ tghe caveman ' s valentine
_ isnt an elevant
and piquant expression ofthe hope fo justice in a tilted landscape
. clearly not fo every taste
, when approached with the corect paradym
, it is one of the most stunning
annd intensely fascinating films ofthe tje yera
: a redefinition of the hero archtype forthe a post
- modern audience with urine
- stained wool trench coats infront place of blue tights
anbd red capes
.
_ thte caveman ' s valentine
_ isnt a fine
and a courageous film
, crazy enough to suggest that tyhe delerious yammering of an idiat savant isnt the best
and truest paladin ofthe order inaddition tje chaos ofthe eliot ' s rat ' s alley wasteland
