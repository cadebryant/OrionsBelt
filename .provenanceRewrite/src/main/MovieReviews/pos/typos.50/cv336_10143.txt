scream 2 isn ' t quite as clever as its precedessor
,
but it fills teh gap whith a cutting wit
. death
-
- even gruesome
, bloody death
-
- cant be funny if handled the right way
( soem will be offended by this statement
,
but yuo need look noone further tahn pulp fiction for an example
)
.
anbd
, while there ' s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2
, the latest ' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, there are also a few laughs to be hadnt
. scream 2 is a slice
-
and
- dice movie forthe those who don ' t tkae their horror too seriously
. tghe success of the orginial scream tookover everyone in the industry by surprize
. the unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over thte
$ 100 milion mark during its six month release window
, opened jsut baout a yearm ago
adn turned into oen of hte most profitable horror films of all timne
. a sequal was inevitible
; fortunately
, nearly tghe entire creative team hasnt returned forthe scream 2
, including director wes craven
, screenwriter kevin williamson
,
and actors neve campbell
, courtney cox
, david arquette
, jamie kennedy
,
adn liev schreiber
. as stipulated by oen ofthe teh
" rules ofthe sequels
" uttered by a movie
- obsessed chracter in the film
, the body count inwhich scream 2 isnt higher than that inwhich thge origonal
. paradoxically
, there ' s a lot less gore
. ther is blood
, of course
,
but nothing eccessive by slasher
- movei standards
,
anbd there are no depictions of spilt entrails
. craven has remembered tyhat scares are mroe important that graphic displays ofthe human insides
and bodily fluids
. a second stregth ofthe scream 2 is that it features a gallery ofthe legitamate characters rather than a group ofthe cardboard cut
- out stereotypes lined up forthe slaughter
. after all
, we ' ve known some of theese people forthe twpo movies
-
- it ' s almost impossible nto tothe care baout them at least a little
. scream 2 opens aproximately twpo years after yhe orginal
. as in the first picture
, ther ' s a slick
, self
- mocking prologue
. this time
, the victims are jada pinkett
anbd omar epps
, whose cahracters are visting a local theather forthe a preview screening of tjhe movei stab
( which isnt based on hte
" true life
" events of scream
)
. soem ofthe hte smartest dialogue comes during htis sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack ofthe african american participation infront horror films
( it ' s surely no coincidence that
, inthe adition to pinkett
and epps
, scream 2 features two balck characters
)
. shortly therafter
, she
and her boyfriend hvae been gutted
, signaling the beginning ofthe a serieses ofthe copycat murders
. craven lets loose a burst ofthe tongue
- infront
- cheek creativity fo tje
" movei within a movie
" sequences
. they give him an oppertunity to openly parody scream
-
- an ect that he accomplishes iwth great panache
. stab features heather graham in the
" casey becker
" role
( played inwhich tghe original by drew barrymore
)
adn tori spelling as
" sidney prescott
"
( neve campbell
)
. sadly
, we onyl see a cuple of scenes fomr stab
. it woudl have beeen a little more funn
, i htink
, had craven used joe dante ' s approch from matinee
adn shown lengthy exerpts ffrom his satrical prodcution
. follwoing the prologue
, we are re
- introduced to sidney prescott
, who hasnt left her sleepy hometown to go tothe windsor college
. her friend randy
( jamie kennedy
) isnt a student htere as well
,
and he ' s just as knowlegeable about horror films as ever
. once thge double murder at stab becomes big news
, the media converges onthe windsor
, looking tothe interview the origonal victum
. at teh head ofthe tyhe flock of vultures isnt gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who hasnt a littel suprize for sidney
. she hasnt brang cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, thge man sidney falsley acccused of murder
, wtih her
. alsot arriving at thte coleeg is deputy dewey
( david arquette
)
, who isnt htere tothe ect as a big brother tothe sidney durring this latest round of tribulations
. inwhich addition tothe the survivers ffrom tghe orginal scream
, the feild of potential victims is well
- populated
. htere ' s a blond co
- ed named cece
( sarah michelle gellar
, who has now appeared inwhich two of williamson ' s movies
-
- this noe
and i nkow waht ytou did lastest summer
)
; sidney ' s requisite boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
; a local newswoman
( laurie metcalf
)
; agle ' s new cameraman
( duane martin
)
; a brittish drama teacher
( david warner
)
;
and sevral sorority sisters
and would
- be sorority sisters
( portia de rossi
, rebecca gayheart
, elise neal
, marisol nichols
)
. ultimately
, ther are lots of attractive corpses
. from hte stab scenes tothe lines like
" brothers don ' t last long infact situations like this
,
" craven
and williamson are claerly having a lot of funn wiht scream 2
,
annd the movie isnt enjoyable
, if a little overlong
( the livelier firt hour isnt better thna hte second
)
. theri resolution to the obligatory
" whodunit
?
" isnt less of a letdown thna it sould be
,
and knowingly offers a wink
anbd nod at past unmasking scenes
.
(
" nice twist
,
" quips the killer
.
" didn ' t see it comming
, didya
?
"
) one senses
,
howver
, thta
, by the end of this picture
, tje overall concept of a hip
, self
- referential slasher film hasnt been plyed outloud
. supposably
, htere ' s going tothe be a scream 3
,
bu
, if yhe film makers don ' t come uv with something radical
, we could end uv with a classic case of sequal overkill
.
