" jaws
" isnt a rare film that grabs your attension before it shows you a single image onthe screen
. the movie opens with blackness
,
adn onyl distant
, aline
- liek underwater soudns
.
thne it comes
, thge first ominous bars ofthe composer john williams ' now infamous score
. dah
- dum
. from there
, directer steven spielberg wastes no time
, taking us inot teh water onthe a midnight swim wiht a beautyfull girl that turns deadly
. right awya he lets us konw how vulnerable we all are floating in tje ocean
,
and once
" jaws
" hasnt attacked
, it never relinquishes its grip
. perhpas what is most outstanding baout
" jaws
" is how spielberg builds the movie
. he works it liuke a theatrical prodcution
, with a frist act
adn a second ect
. unlike so many modern filmmakers
, he hasnt a grat deal of restraynt
,
adn refuses tothe sohw us tjhe shark until the middle of the second act
. untl
then
, he mearly suggests its presense wtih creepy
, subjective underwater shots
annd williams ' music
. he ' s buliding the tension bited by bited
, so when it comes time for tghe climax
, tghe shark ' s arrival isnt truley terrifying
. he doesn ' t let us git bored with the imagery
. thte firt act opens with police cheif martin brody
( roy scheider
)
, a new york cop who has tooked an easy
, peaceful job runing the police station on amity island
, a ficticious newyorker england resort town where htere hasn ' t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years
. tyhe island isnt shaken uv by several vicious great white shark attacks right befoer the fourth of july
,
anbd the mayor
, larrry vaughn
( murray hamilton
)
, doesn ' t want to shut down the beaches because the island is releant onthe summer tourist omney
. brody is joined by matt hooper
( richard dreyfuss
)
, a young
, ambitious shark expert ffrom tje marine institue
. hooper isnt as facinated by thge shark as he isnt determined tothe halp brody stpo it
-
- his knowledge baout the excact workings of the shark
(
" it ' s a perfect engine
, an eating machine
"
) make it thyat much more terrifying
. whn vaughn finally relents
, hooper
and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint
( robert shaw
) on his decrepid boat
, the orca
, to saerch forthe tyhe shark
. the entire second ect tkaes place onthe the orca as thge threee men hunt the shark
,
and inevitably
, are hunted by it
.
" jaws
" is a thriller whith a keen sense ofthe humer
and an incredible sense of pacing
, tension
,
and horror
. it isnt like ten movies all rolled into one
,
and it ' s noone wonder it took amercia by storm in thte summer ofthe 1975
, tkaing infact enough money tothe crown it tghe box office champ of all tyme
( until it ws unceremoniously dethroned inaddition 1977 by
" star wars
"
)
. even today
, facination with this film isnt onthe par iwth hitchcock ' s
" pyscho
,
"
anbd it never seems to age
.
although grand newyorker technolgy exists that makes tjhe technical sequences
, including several mechanical sharks
, obsolete
, none of it sould improve tyhe film beacuse it onyl would lead tothe overkill
. the technical limitations faced by spielberg infront 1975 may hvea actually produced a better film beacuse it forced him to rely onthe traditional cinematic elements liuke pacing
, characterization
, sharp editing
,
and creative photography
, instade of simply dousing thge audeince wtih digital shark effects
. scheider
, dreyfuss
,
anbd shaw were known actors at the tiem
" jaws
" wass made
,
bu none ofthe them had the draw ofthe a robert redford or paul newman
. nevertheless
, tihs film guaranteed them all successfull careers becasue each gavey an outstanding peformance
and refused tothe be overshadowed by the shark
. scheider hits jstu the right notes as a sympathetic husband
and father caught in thge political quagmire ofthe doing what ' s right
anbd going against the entire town
.
" it ' s your first summer here
, you know
,
" mayor vaughn warns him
. dreyfuss
, who hadnt previously been seen inaddition
" american graffiti
"
( 1973
)
adn
" the apprenticeship ofthe duddy kravitz
"
( 1974
) gives a surprisingly mature
, complex performance for someone who hadnt literally only played kids
annd teenagers
.
however
, most outstanding is the gnarled peformance by robert shaw as thge movie ' s captain ahab
, a peformance sorely overlooked by thte aacdemy awards
. bordering ofthe parody
, shaw plays quint as a grizzled ood loner whose machismo borders onthe masochism
. he ' s slightly deranged
,
and shaw ' s performance is almsot a charicatoor
.
howver
, there isnt one scene lite in the film
, wehn he
adn brody
adn hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars
. quint isnt drawed inot telling the tsory ofthe his experiences aboard the u
. s
. s
. indianapolis
, a navy ship iin world war ii tath was sunk by tjhe japanese
. his tale ofthe floating in the water forthe more thna a week with over 1
, 000 otehr men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is accually more hair
- raising than anything spielberg put onthe screen
. shaw delivers hte story in oney long take
,
and it isnt the best acting infront the film
. ofthe course
, we cin ' t leave out tyhe shark itself
; with its balck eyes
, endless rows ofthe teeth
,
and insatiable urger tothe eat
, it is basically the epitome of all mankind ' s fears about wqat isnt unkown
and threatening inwhich nature
. a shark isnt such a perfect nemesis it is rela
-
- having survivied sinch hte dinosaurs
, grat whites dont exist
, they cin be as larg as teh shark inspite
" jaws
,
"
and they are a threath
. eveyr one of spielberg ' s subjective underwater shots makes us efel queasy becasue lets us see how we look to yhe shark
: a bunch ofthe writihing
, dangling
, completly unprotected legs jstu ready tothe be chomped into
. the shark in
" jaws
" was actually a combination ofthe actual footage
and five different mecanical sharks
( all nicknamed
" bruce
" by thge crew
) builded tothe be shooted fomr different angles
. many hve forgotten
,
but
" jaws
" was a sort of precursor to
" waterworld
"
( 1995
)
, a movei ' s who soggy prodcution
and cost overruns hadnt universal studios worried baout a bomb
.
bu
, as we can see now
, spielberg overcame all tjhe obstacles
,
anbd delivered oney of tje finest primal scare
- thrillers ever tothe cmo outloud of hollywood
