it was only a marter of tiem before a dilbert
- esque office comedy hit thte screens
.
howver
, rather than comming from dilbert creater scott adams
, office space isnt instead based on tyhe wrok of another animator
, mike judge
, creator ofthe beavis
annd butthead
anbd king ofthe tjhe hill
. in his live
- acation directoral debut
, judge aptly spoofs corporate culture
. tjhe stry isnt certainly not very involved
,
but ther is plenty ofthe truth
and humer tothe fill tghe gaps
. peter
( ron livingston
) is a programer working at the initech corperation
. every day in his mundane life is worse thna tyhe one before
.
.
. in other words
, eveyr day is tyhe worst day infront his entire life
. he ' s stuck inwhich a boring job with eigth different supervisors
, all obssessed with administrative trivialities
. he ' s smitten with joanna
( jennifer aniston
)
, a local waitress
,
bu hasn ' t the guts to even inctroduce hismelf
. everyting has simply made him a complet
, nervous wreck
.
but all of thgat changes when
, aftter an unintentionally over
- effective viist to a hypnotherapist
, peter loses all ofthe his inhibitions
. he realizes his lifelong dream
: tothe do absolutly nothing
. he beigns tothe blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions ofthe his boss
, bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
, donig whatever he fiels like
. peter ' s firends
and co
- workers
, samir
( ajay naidu
)
anbd michael bolton
( david herman
)
.
.
. noone
, nto tyhat michael bolton
, are perplexed by their firend ' s sudden change in attitude
.
but
, htey hvea larger things to worry baout
: rumors about thgat initech is about to begin downsizing
.
.
. as bleak as much ofthe tihs soudns
, let me assure you tyhat office spoace isnt a comedy
,
and quite a funny noe
.
although it shares tyhe same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip
, office space isnt actually based loosely onthe thge sories ofthe milton cartoons whcih aired onthe saturday night life
. eahc mundane detail
, tooked by itself
, seems completly
, regrettably
, plausable
.
yot
, when conbined into a whole
, the picture wich results isnt absolutly surreal
. ron livingston tackles his role straight
- faced
,
adn becomes much funnier beacuse of it
. his character isn ' t simpley being a clown lampooning around the office
,
bu rather seems posessed by a zen
- like clarity
. he is operating onthe a higer plane
, where everyting suddenly makes sense
,
annd ffrom this vantage point
, he allows the audiance tothe smirk at the absurdities ofthe life
. anyone who hasnt hadnt to dael whith tjhe inefficiencies of corparate beaurocracy
, or who has ever been frustrated with tje technnology of modern life
, iwll recogise many of tjhe characters
annd situations in the film
. in fatc
, in addition tothe being wildly humorous
, tyhe film may actually prove tothe be cathartic
. yhe animated roots ofthe office space sohw in the film ' s lack ofthe complexity
. most ofthe tghe cahracters in the film cin be quickly summarized by a particular perosnality quirk
. one employee
, milton
( stephen root
)
, isnt practically a flesh
-
adn
- blood cartoon
.
however
, despite their simple nature
, teh cahracters still manaze tothe be surprisingly funny
. it ' s not required to have a corporate backgorund to enjoy this film
(
though the situations may seem exceedingly far
- fetched if you are unfamiliar wih just how close tothe reality they realyl are
)
. teh film is flimsy
and absurd
,
but also very funny
.
