. review
: noe memorable aspect ofthe disney ' s
" aladdin
" was that it finally gave robin williams a charater
-
- tyhe genie
-
- tothe best tkae advantage of his comic talents
.
" shrek
" does the same for eddie murphy
; ironicly
,
though
, murphy ' s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass
. all tyhe smae
,
" shrek
" doesnt represent murphy ' s best comic outing in yeasr
,
annd as donkey he steals all the best lines
. for instance
, affter getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature
, donkey soars inot tghe air
adn scoffs
,
" nowe i ' m a flying tlaking donkey
!
"
and despite its many contributors
, yhe scirpt forthe
" shrek
" is full of such comic gems
. myers isnt delightful in more ofthe a straight man role
,
and lithgow allso gets soem great moments
( watch fo a hilarious repartee witht the gingerbread man
)
.
" shrek
" takes gerat pleasure inwhich lampooning fairy tales
and nursery rhymes ofthe all sorts
,
and reserves a faw delightful knocks at disney in the bargain
. things do go somewhat astray durring the film ' s middle segment
, wich consentrates too much on tjhe main characters at teh expense of some ofthe the terrific fairy tale satire whihc is the movie ' s greatest strength
.
bu even
thn
, noe cxan allways sit back
annd enjoy the beautiful computer animation
, whose remarkable use here represents
yet another dazzling leap forward fo the tecnology
.
