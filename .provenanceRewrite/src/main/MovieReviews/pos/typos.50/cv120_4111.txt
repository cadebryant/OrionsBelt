in brief
: best bleak comedy film since heathers
. full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen mintues ofthe fame mentality tht feeds so much ofthe modern american pop culture
. go see it
! so
, i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on
" hard copy
" wtih pam smart
, hte newyorker hampshire media teacher who wass convicted ofthe engeneering tyhe death ofthe her husban back infront yhe 1980 ' s
.
" hard copy
" ' s diane dimond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman ' s fictionalized portrayal of her infact thge newyorker film tothe dieu for
. smart replied thyat she thought kidman ' s character cameback off as a dumb
, vicious tramp
and she thougth that the publicity the newyorker movei generates might jstu hurt her chances in her latest court appeal
.
( smart was convicted
and given a life sentence forthe her part infact the murder ofthe her husban
.
) smart ' s got a point
. it wouldn ' t be thte frist tiome thast the publich took tghe better scripted
annd well
- acted movei verison of an event as teh absolute truth over thte duller
annd far less artistic real life version
.
howver
, given a choise betwen thte mass media ' hapening ' ofthe tghe real event
and the fictionalized movie
, i would definitely opt for tghe later
. rela murderers rarley have dialogue as witty as wqat buck henry hasnt written forthe this movei
annd smart
, while pretty
adn alluring
, isnt noone match forthe the cinematic charms of nicole kidman
. tothe dieu forthe beggins in a twon called littel hope
, new hampshire
, the archetypal dry
and intellectually barren american suberb
. the stry concerns the ambitious suzanne stone
anbd how she tackles thge obstancles between her
annd her life long ambition of bieng ' on tv
. ' ofthe course
, one ofthe those littel obstancles turns out tothe be her dull
and unambitious husband larry
, played by matt dillon
.
but
, whith a littel immagination
, some charm
adn raw sex appeal
adn a rether novel aproach to junior acheivment
, our heroine manages to overcome tje nay
- sayers inspite her life
, at least temporarily
. kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne
. i hvae never really beeen all taht fond of htis actress
bu she shows a wonderful flair fo comedy in htis picture
. her protrayal of tghe incredibly shallow
and dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman knwos a star
- making role whn she sees it
and she plays tyhe conscience
- deprived suzanne as the ultimate carrer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress ffrom hell
. she isnt ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way
. at oney point suzanne is expounding onthe her knowledge ofthe world events to her future husban
and sister
- infact
- law
.
" ytou konw
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev would still be the leader ofthe russia or whatever
, if he hadnt jstu had that ugly purplish hting removed ffrom his head
.
" her husban beams at suzanne ' s profound knowledge ofthe world politics
and
then proudly proclaims tyhat thsi qualifies her to be the enxt barbara walters
. this is vyre close tothe pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. the other standout performance infront the film isnt delivered by joaquin pheonix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned outloud teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne ' s sexual favors
. kidman ' s character
, vapid
though she isnt
, isnt a sort ofthe suave beacon ofthe succes tothe jimmy
annd his lost firends russell
annd lydia
, winningly portayed by casey affleck
adn alison folland
. phoenix looks liuke the very embodiment ofthe gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, of course
)
. his jimmy has the dead eyes
and demeanor of a kid who konws that he ain ' t oging anyhwere
, ever
. pheonix reacts to thte sexy suzanne iwth a sort of obsessed amazement
and he mkaes us believe that a loser character like jimmy realy would be willing to kill fo someone liuke suzanne
, somone who actally noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my pwn private idaho
) direction isnt frist
- rate
. he keeps the pacing infront this not
- qutie
- thriller snapping along
. van sant rightly keesh thge focuse ofthe htis movie onthe teh amoral suzanne
and doesn ' t stpo tothe proselytize tje audience about thge rightness or wrongness of her actions
. van sant trusts his material
anbd trusts his audiance tothe ' get it ' wihtout stopping to expalin waht isnt funny about this all
- american stoyr
. the screenplay
, by buck henry
, isnt absolutly great
annd includes some ofthe thge best bleakly comic lines i ' ve heard since heathers
. henry ' s stoyr is a blast against thte shallowness ofthe the american media
and the mindlessness of fame
,
yot the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a faw characters
. henry ably manages to avoid diluting his stopry by aiming at too many targets
adn hte result is a crisp
anbd funny mini
- clasic
. danny elfman did the orginial music forthe this movei
adn he delivers anyother eccentric
, loopy scroe that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands
. eather film score owudl make wonderful backgorund music fo halloewen trck
- or
- treat parties
. all
- in
- all
, a wonderful prodcution
, well worth your seven bucks
! tothe dieu forthe
