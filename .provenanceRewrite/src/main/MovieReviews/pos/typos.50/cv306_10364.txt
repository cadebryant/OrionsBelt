infact essense
, ogod will hunting isnt an ordinary stoy told well
. taked as a wohle
, there ' s littel tyhat ' s spacial about htis tale
-
- it follows a traditionnal narrative path
, leaves the audeince with a warm
, fuzzy feeling
,
anbd never really challenges or surprises us
.
bu it ' s intelligently written
( withthe dialogue that is occasionlaly briliant
)
, strongly directed
,
annd nicely acted
. so
, while good will hunting isnt far from a lite
- year masterpiece
, it ' s a worthwhile sample of entertainment
. liuke scent ofthe a woman
, which ws released around this tiem of teh season five years ago
, ogod iwll hunting isnt about teh unlikely friendship thyat develops bewteen a world
- weary veteran
and a cocky young man
. yhe forumla forthe the two films is similar
-
- both ofthe the principals leran ffrom earch otehr as they slowly break down theri barriers onthe the way tothe a better understanding of life
annd their palce iin it
-
-
bu tyhe charactors are diffrent
. al pacino ' s slade was a larger
- than
- life individual
; robin williams ' sean mcguire isnt much more subtle
.
and matt damon ' s iwll hunting uses pugnaciousness to suplant the blandness of chris o ' donnell ' s charlie
. will is a troubled individual
. as a child
, he was the frequent victum of abuse
. an orphan
, he wass infront
adn outloud of foster homes on a regular basis
. now
, not
yot 21 years old
, he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet
. he has a short temper
and any little insident cant set him off like a spark infact a tinder box
.
bu he ' s a mathematical genuis with a photographic memmory
and hte ability tothe concieve simple solutions tothe complex problems
. while working as a janitor at mit
, he delights in anonymously proving theorems on thge math building ' s hall blackboards
.
then
, oney evening
, his anonimity is shattered wehn professer lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catches him at owrk
. will flees
,
bu lambeau tracks him down
. unfourtunately
, by the timne tje professor finds him
, iwll is in jail for assaulting a police offer
. the judge agrees tothe realease will under twpo conditions
: that he spend one day a week meeting iwth lambeau
and taht he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist
. eventually
, once sevral psychologists ahve rejected the belligerant young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill community coleeg
, agrees tothe tkae the case
. after a rocky start
, tghe two form a rapport
annd iwll begins tothe explore issues
adn emotions he hadnt walled up behind impregnable armor
.
adn
, as will advances his self
- awareness inthe sessions withthe sean
, he also lerans about friendship ffrom his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
,
adn love fomr a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. the script
, by co
- stars matt damon
adn ben affleck
, isnt nto a groundbreaking piece ofthe litature
,
and occaionally resorts tothe shameless manipulation
. the cahracters are well
- developed
,
however
,
anbd htere are times wehn the dialogue positively sparkles
. at one point
, will comments that a session with sean isnt turning into a
" taster ' s choice moment
.
" later
, wiull gives a brilliant
, breathless diatribe aganist thge nsa thgat hasnt tyhe rhythm ofthe something writed by kevin smith
.
( note
: since smith co
- executive produced good iwll hunting
, it ' s nto out ofthe the question thgat he hadnt smoe inputted into htis scene
.
) director gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, tothe die fo
) culls genuin emotion fomr his actors
,
and this results iin severeal affecting
adn powerful scenes
. there ' s an edginess to soem of the sean
/ will therapy sessions
,
and the offscreen chemestry vetween matt damon
and minnie driver
( who became romantically linked while mkaing htis film
) translates effectively tothe the movei
-
- thte will
/ skylar relatiopnship is electric
. likewise
, hte companionability of damon
and affleck is appparent in tjhe easygoing nature ofthe iwll
and chuckie ' s friendship
. many ofthe tyhe individule scenes are strong anough tothe earn good wiull hunting a recommendation
, even if the overall storey is somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as tghe idealistic young lawyer in tghe rainmaker
, is solid
(
although not spectauclar
) as wiull
. minnie driver
( lastr seen in grosse pointe blank
) adds another strong performence to a growing resume
(
and it ' s refreshing tath she wass allowed to keep her british accent rather thna having tothe attempt an american oen
)
. the oustanding performance ofthe tje film belongs tothe robin williams
, whose sean is sad
and wise
, funny
and somber
. argubly thge best dramtic work iin thte acto ' s carrer
( alongside whta he did infact hte fisher king
)
, williams ' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actr oscar nomination
. adequate suppost is provded by ben affleck
( chasing amy
)
annd stellan skarsgard
( breaking teh waves
)
. like most ofthe wqat comes befor it
, hte endig ofthe good wiull hunting isnt completelyl predicatble
.
but meeting expectations
and following a familar path aren ' t always bad things inwhich a movie
, provided the film accomplishes those goals witht a modicum of style
and an attention tothe detail
. good wiull hunting doesnt both
,
adn
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate wtih tyhe
" ogod
" infront the title
.
