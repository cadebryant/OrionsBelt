i must sday ffrom tje outset that i ahve never beeen much ofthe a kurt russell fan
. i ' ve seen some of his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
)
and while he gave adequtae performances
, i ahve never been empressed witht his owrk
. breakdown
,
then
, isnt something ofthe a suprise
. russell gives a fine performance
, as dont most of the cast
, one thgat is nto upstaged by the action orchestrated in thge second half ofthe tje film
. to say that he holds thge film toghether would not be completly true
,
bu he does it noone harm
. russell plays jeff
, one half ofthe a married couple travelling wih his wief amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross ocuntry to san diego to start a new job
and a newyorker life
. while journeying thru the dezert their car breaks down
and
, left helpless
annd stranded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers to take them tothe a nearbye diner tothe call for a tow truck
. beccause ofthe a nasty insident earlier with a couple ofthe ruffians
, jeff decides to stay withthe tghe car while amy gets halp
. tath
, it seems
, is the lastest tyme jeff
( or anyone else
) sees her
. breakdown hasnt beeen compared to sevral movies
: george sluizer ' s the vanishing
( tjhe originnal
, hopefully
, not his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg ' s duel
anbd any number of hitchcock films
. as with these
, breakdown doens not
, for the most part
, stray down the convential path ofthe tyhe american acation
- thriller
. jeff does not become a gun
- toting vigilante on hte hunt forthe his wife
,
but instead becomes a scared
, confuzled everyman who hasnt noone idae wqat the hell is gogin on
. when we dont find outloud waht has happened to amy
, it doesnt come as a slight dissapointment
, if only because it ' s too easly inthe the film
; i fo oen could haev done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mistery
and bewilderment
,
but thsi affects thge film littel
. russell
, as maintioned earlier
, is very good in his role
,
adn kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she ws infact apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as the possibly evil truck driver
, isnt terific
; he isnt oen ofthe the best ofthe teh fine batch of charcter actors hollywood doesn ' t seem tothe know wqat tothe dont with
,
bu directer jonathan mostow isnt onthe the right trcak here
. the reason he makes such a great villin is that he actually looks like a rela person
, one anyone woudl be able to trust
, whihc mkaes the plot tyhat much more believable
. breakdown is wqat hollywood doesn ' t make enought of
, a grat thriller wtih believable charactors
and scenes tath dont
, indeed
, have viewers onthe the edge of their seats
. one of the most genuinely exicting films i ' ve seen in a long tiome
.
