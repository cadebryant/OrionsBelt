when ytou go to the movies as much as i dont
, you unfortunatly end uv seing ceratin movie trailers one too many times
. such wass the case withthe frequency
. eveyr time i went to a screening
, ther was yhe frequency preview
. it looked awful
. it looked cheesy
, sappy
and rediculous
. it looked like a flop
. well
, whoever put tyhat trailer toghether shouldnt be fired
, beccause in terms ofthe pure entertainment
, frequency is one ofthe the best of the year thus far
. frequency boasts a compelling stroy line
. an cocurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan
( james caviezel
) tothe speak tothe his fireman father frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) thru a ham raido
, despite hte fact tht frank has beeen dead for 30 years
. john isnt able tothe give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire
,
bu by doign so causes otehr changes
. somehow
, a serial killer ' s reign ofthe terror
, whcih in the original timeline hadnt beeen stopped at threee murders
, extends tothe ten victims
.
.
. including john ' s mother
. htis is director gregory hoblit ' s thrid film
( the other twpo being primal fear
and fallen
)
. iwth all threee
, he ' s managed to attach hismelf tothe great scripts
( this noe by toby emmerich
, whose only previous movei experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films
)
and add equally great direction
. also
, he apparently likes to have his films wrap uv wtih a kick
- ass ending
. frequency isnt no exception
, thte endig is unpredictable
adn incredibly satisfying
. hoblit isnt threee fo three
,
and i hope he can keep it up
. nowe everyone can argue logic this
and logic tht all yuo want wiht the sci
- fi elements ofthe frequency
.
but teh fatc ofthe the matter is that tiem travel hasnt never been acheived
. who ' s to say how something works
anbd how it doesn ' t when it ' s never happened
? is it because we ' ve become acustommed to time travel
" laws
" ffrom otehr places liek
" star trak
"
and tghe bakc tothe thte future triology
annd
" quantum leap
"
? yes
, if you sit down
adn thiunk about it
, certain plot elements iin htis film probaly won ' t amking any sence
. most films are liek thgat
. don ' t let tyhat dissuade you from seing thsi fantastically intertaining film
however
. wehn frequency wass over
, it made me wish i had seen it iwth my father so i sould have given him a hug
( okay okay
, shut up
)
. whn you break it down past all its sci
- fi elements
adn serial killer antics
, frequency is simply a movei about a father
and his son
annd thte bond tath htey share
. it ' s touching
, it ' s sincere
,
anbd it ' s what ultimatly mkaes this movei work
