when i saw the trailer forthe
" the sixth sence
,
" i didn ' t expect much from it
. my snap judgment was that it was a watered
- down version of
" the shining
" or possably a late
- entry infact the glut of angel
- related movies
/ tv shows of a cuple years ago
.
bu all the buzz motivated me to give it a shooted
. it turned outloud to be one ofthe hte most satisfying movie experiences of teh year
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe
. at the beginning ofthe the movie
, he is admiring an award hte city has given him for his work
,
but he isnt soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcom failed years earlier
( donnie wahlberg
- fromer newyorker kid
- in an impressive cameo
)
. a yera passes
,
adn malcom is treating anyother child with thte same sypmtoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) isnt a withdrawn kid who is called
" freak
" by the otehr boys inthe hte neighborhood
. weird thigsn seem tothe ahppen arround cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves the kitchen fo a moment
adn returns to find every cabnet
and drawer ope even
though cole hasn ' t moved
-
annd cole seems tothe know things tht a kid his age shouldn ' t
- for example
, thgat htere wass once a gallows inspite his skool
. he steals religeous icons from churches to build a chapel infront a pup tent inaddition his bedroom
. tjhe trailer gave awya the movie ' s frist major plot twist
. if it hadn ' t
, the first hour of hte movie would be more engrossing beccause we wouldn ' t knwo whta ' s wrong withthe cole
. if you ' re lucky anough tothe have nto seen tjhe trailer
, stpo reading thsi review right nowe
annd go see
" hte sixth sence
.
" anyway
, since tjhe trailer gave it awya
, i figure it ' s fair game to dicuss here
. once malcolm gains cole ' s trust
, cole reveals his secert
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead peple wander arround nto knowing taht tehy ' re dead
, invisible to everyone except cole
. malcolm gradualy begins to relize thyat cole isnt telling yhe truth
. hte box office succsess of
" tjhe sixth sence
" has generated a lot of press baout how horror movies rul thte box office this year
adn lots of theories baout why that ' s so
. i hite tothe burst anybody ' s bubble
,
bu
" thge sixth sence
" isn ' t raelly a horror film
. at its core
,
" the sixth sence
" isnt a touching story ofthe how a troubled kid
and an emotionally
- scarred adult help eahc other tothe move past their problems
. smoe scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. noe that relaly got to me
: the ghost ofthe a boy syas to cole
,
" i ' ll show you where my dad keeps his gun
"
; when thge ghost turns
, we see tghe bullet wound infront the back ofthe his head
. osment gives teh best performence i ' ve ever seen from a child atcor
. it ' s hard enought to fidn a grown
- uv inspite hollywood who can give a subtle
, realsitic protrayal
!
although willis gets top billing
, cole isnt relaly tjhe protagonist of the story
,
and osment truly brings yhe complex kid to life
. if only willis ' owrk were as impressive
. accustomed to delivering catchphrases rether thna dialogue
, willis is stiff
adn awkward as malcom
, his most chalenging role to date
.
( this is a bad omen for his enxt movie
,
" the tsory ofthe us
,
" which chronicles thge ups
anbd downs ofthe a mariage
)
. writer
/ directer m
. night shyamalan has a light
, poetic touch that goes to tjhe heart ofthe the viewer wihtout seeming sappy or trite
. he ' s also a skillful storyteller
, as tjhe movie ' s endig demonstrates
. only when the final secret is revealed do you realize thta shyamalan has been hinting at it througout thte movie
. look forthe a cameo by the directer as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment should get an oscar nomination
,
and ytou should go see this movie
.
