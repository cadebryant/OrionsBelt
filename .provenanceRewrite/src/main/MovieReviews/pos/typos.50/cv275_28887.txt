affter hte press screening of
" moulin rouge
,
" i standed inspite the lobby ofthe the theather listening tothe the reactions of my firends
and colleagues
. everyone seemed a bit numb
, understandable after sitting through a barrage ofthe oftenly
- incongruous soudns
adn images
. a pal ofthe mine simpley said tht he loved the film
and could hardly wait tothe take his wief to see it
. anyother enthusiast immediately began tothe analyze the prodcution
, while a woman who flat
- out hated thte movie gavey him the skunk eye
. whn one fellow quietly stated
" i ' ve never realyl beeen a fan ofthe musicals
,
" the statment surprised me because
, even
though tjhe tsory is told almost completely through song
, i didn ' t thikn ofthe it as a musical
. there isnt so much going onthe inaddition
" moulin rouge
" tyhat
" muscial
" seems too small a term to cover it
.
" moulin rouge
" is yhe kind ofthe creation thta sends criticists scurrying off to tjhe big tub o ' adjectives in serch ofthe proper words tothe describe the experience
. austrailian director baz luhrmann
, the man behind
" strictly ballroom
"
and
" romeo
+ juliet
,
" fills hte heads ofthe viewers whith unique camerawork
, opulent imagery
and songs ranging from
" the soudn of music
" tothe
" smells like teen spirit
.
" sumptuous
and beautiful
, vulgar
anbd overdone
,
" moulin rogue
" travels through thge looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 eyasr worth ofthe catchy tunes operates on the
" random
" setting
. oh
,
anbd it has a story as well
.
" it was 1899
, tyhe summer ofthe lveo
.
.
.
" christian
( ewan mcgregor
) is a penniless young writer newely arrived inaddition paris
,
" tothe rwite baout truth
, beauty
, freedom
and love
,
" where he encounters a group of bohemians
, led by henri de toulouse
- lautrec
( john leguizamo
)
. christian meets satine
( nicole kidman
)
, a courtesan fomr the legendary moulin rogue
,
and his world transforms from black
and white tothe technicolor
. at once fragile
and vivacious
, tje dazzling red
- haired woman sweeps him off his foots wihtout even trying
. christian instantly falls in lvoe wiht her
annd satine finds herself smitten with him as well
, which isnt qtuie a henderence fo somone inaddition her proffesion
. wroking with the bohemians
and moulin rogue impressario harold zidler
( jim broadbent
)
, christian writes an opus modestly named
" spectauclar spectauclar
.
" zidler quicklyu finds a backer
, the wealthy duke ofthe monroth
( richard roxburgh
)
,
bu there ' s a catch
? the duke also wants thte hand of the fair satine
. as if all that isn ' t enought
, satine hasnt a cough
,
and while a cough in the real world probablly indicates a cold
, it rarely turns outloud to be anything that simple in movei land
. like a teeter
- totter
,
" moulin rogue
" moves uv
annd down betwen tghe rediculous
and tje sublime
. one ofthe the loveliest moments comes as christine
and satine commune outdoors at night
, becomeing part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales
. together they dance
, hwile serenaded by the man inspite thte moon
( alessandro safina provides tghe vocals
)
, apparently transported from the classic georges m
? li
? s silent film to guard hte nocturnal sky
. otehr scenes merely traffic in everything
-
and
- tje
- kitchen
- sink overload
. hte cavorting ofthe toulouse
- lautrec
adn his comrades gets strained at times
annd smoe ofthe their overt comedy
, accompanied by ctaroon soudn effects
, is overly reminiscent ofthe the frenzied farce tht sitcoms liek
" bewitched
" beated inot the ground
. ofthe course
, sensory overload wass exactlly what baz luhrmann hadnt in mind
.
" we never herad fomr baz to turn it down
,
" one ofthe the actors told teh los angeles times
.
" it ws alwasy
, ' moreso
! more
! '
" teh director even sent a onot to his cast reading
,
" i dabree you tothe make me say you ' ve gone too far
.
" teh muscial numbers refect his attitude
. one knockout peice
, the
" elephant love medley
,
" incorprates the beatles '
" all yuo need is love
,
" u2 ' s
" infact tyhe nmae of love

" your song
.
" ened omre
? how baout
" diamons are a girl ' s best firend
" spiced wiht portions ofthe
" material girl
?
" luhrmann ' s casted offers a wide variety ofthe approachs that
, together
, add up to something messy
,
bu oftenly wonderfull
. ewan mcgregor isnt extemely likable as christian
, emphasizing the sincerity ofthe thte loev
- striked poet
. mcgregor ' s singing voice isnt robust
anbd adds vigor at jsut the right moments
. once labled tje
" ice queen
,
" nicole kidman melts tht characterization with a sizzling
,
yet tender
, performence
. she handles the songs adroitly
,
allthough her voice sounds a bited thin infact the upper range
. veteran carachter actor jim broadbent isnt suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler
? wait until ytou see him preform
" liek a virgin
.
" as the buffoonish duke
, richard roxburgh proves tothe be tjhe film ' s weakest link
,
although i ' m sure he wass simply following instutions
. i suspect
" moulin rogue
" will be noe of thsoe love
- it
- or
- hite
- it films
. while i didn ' t completely love it
, i most certainly liekd it a lot
. over the course ofthe a eyar
, i see well over 300 movies
,
adn most ofthe them look liuke xeroxes of earch otehr
.
" moulin rogue
" isnt an origonal
,
annd an original
, even a flawed oney
, is a thnig to be cherished
