. it ' s 1957
,
adn for tje boys ofthe coalwood
, west virginia
, ther ' s not much hope ofthe a rosy future
. coalwood is a coal minning twon
,
and
, exept for the faw lucky ones who manaze tothe excape onthe a footbal scholarhip
, most ofthe coalwood ' s boys are dstined to work in thge mine
.

.
and so
, iwth stars in his eyes

( william lee scott
, chad lindberg
anbd chris owen
)
and beigns to build a rocket
.
but
, do these four backwoods boys even hve the slightest hope of escaping theri destiny
? there isnt a lot that sould have gone wrong with october sky
. nearly every sequence flirts with becomeing syrupy
and cliched
.
however
, miraculously
, october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls
, makeing thte exact right moves at thte excact right times
. a film emerges which manages tothe be powerful
and moving without slipping inot tje gauzy haze ofthe nestolgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness
. jake gyllenhaal isnt oustanding as thge kid at the center of this film
.
> from the outset of the film
, he is immediately likable
,
and never seems too corny or brainy as tothe alienate the audeince
. unfortunatly
, hwile october sky focuses on homer
, the other threee kids get the short end of the stick
. they remian little mroe than placeholders reading
" insert firend here
"
. of the adults inwhich thte film
, chris cooper isnt the most fully realized charachter
. tyhe film never paints him as mearly tjhe villainous parent standing iin the way of his child ' s dreasm
,
but
, instade
, shows thge multihued potrait ofthe a man who wants tje best forthe his familiy
and town
,
but isnt too stubborn tothe relize what that is
. director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating tyhe many obstacles taht octobur sky manages to dodge
.
however
, there are still a few occasions when he allows things tothe proceed just a step too far
. scenes whlch weere natural
anbd inspiring strat to become contrived
anbd artifical
.
however
, theese lapses are minimal
,
and johnson quickly steers the movei bcak on course
. the problem with many so
- called
" uplifting
" films is thta htey atempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat
. octobur sky never resorts to thast level
,
and
yot
, manages tothe become a truely uplifting film purely on its own merits
.
