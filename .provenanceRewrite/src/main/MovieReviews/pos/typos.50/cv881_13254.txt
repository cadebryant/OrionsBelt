the word ' rest ' in the title should be stressed sicne htis is a movie thast lacks any acation scenes at all
. what doesnt tkaes place isnt more based onthe charactor developement

. nick
and beth have a relationship
adn ahev desided to move from enfield
, arizona tothe butte
, montana
.
(
and i who thought tht butte wass pronounced slightly diferrent
.
.
.
) carol is nick ' s ex
- girlfriend
and beth ' s best friend
, sid isnt a joint
- smoking painter tht comes tothe repaint their house before tjhe newyorker tenants move in
. obviously based on a stage play
, the probelm with tje movie is that there ' s a lot of thigns left out
. it ' s nto obvious tht nick
annd beth are inthe lvoe with each other
, the reason why nick was fired fomr his job isn ' t maintioned
.
