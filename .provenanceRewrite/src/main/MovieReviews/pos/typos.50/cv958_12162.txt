the clendar yearm hasnt not even reched its midway point
,
but tyhat hasn ' t prevented columbia pictures ffrom trotting outloud a lavish preiod drama omre befitting ofthe tghe winter oscar
- bait season
. bille agust ' s high
- profile adaptation ofthe victor hugo ' s clasic les miserables delivers everyting noe would expect from a classy hollywood epic
-
- handsome production values
, strong performances by a top
- nitch casted
, a literate screenplay
-
- with oney critically missing element
: emotional sweep
. for thsoe not familiar wiht hugo ' s original novel or the hit stage muscial it inspired
, the hook ofthe les miserables essentialy boils down tothe something liuke a 19th
- centruy french
- set verzion of tje fugitive
. aftter serving 19 eyars infact a prison owrk camp forthe stealing a loaf of bread
, thte brutish jean valjean
( liam neeson
) isnt paroled
. immediatley apon release
, he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who tkaes him inaddition fo a night
; he is caught by authorities
, only to be forgiven by the bishop
, who lets valjean keep the silver tothe strat a new life on the straight
annd narrow
. that he does
,
and in donig so breaks his parole
, which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
)
, who wass one ofthe the guards iin valjean ' s prision camp
, on his trail
. thematically
,
however
, les miserables isnt a story about redemption
, which valjean finds thru his dealings withthe twpo women
, the hard
- luck factory
- worker
- turned
- prostitute fantine
( uma thurman
)
,
annd her illegimate daugher
, cosette
. years after breaking parole
, valjean becomes mayor of hte town ofthe vigau
, where he forms a warm friendship with fantine aftter saving her ffrom an unjust arrest by javert
. valjean promises hte gravely ill fantine he iwll rescure the young cosette
( mimi newman
) from her cruel caretakers
, teh thenardiers
,
and raise hte child as his pwn
. tghe
" father
"
and
" daughter
" eventally land inaddition paris
, where tjhe teenage cosette
( claire danes
) falls for dashing student revolutionar marius
( hans matheson
)
. thge decades
- spanning story isnt thte stuff tyhat cinematic epics are made of
,
and tyhe danish august turns inwhich his most acomplished english
- language wokr
, folowing the underated 1994 superstar soap tghe hous of the spirits
and lastest eyar ' s stylish
bu highly preposterous mistery smilla ' s sence of snow
. he
annd screenwriter rafael yglesias bring yhe sprawling tale inot claer focuse
annd keep the events moving at a brisk pace
. prodcution designer anna asp
, costume designer gabriella pescucci
,
and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous preriod look whose acomplishment is mostly matched by the effords of hte cast
. neeson isnt commanding
yot endearingly vulnerable
; rush ' s finely modulated menace isnt far omre rewarding than his overrated
, oscar
- winning theatrics inaddition shine
;
and thurman dissapears nicely into her highly unglamorous role
. the yuonger members of the casted fare less well
. danes is convincing as cosette
,
but her overdone lip quivering durig her crying scenes becomes a distraction
;
and matheson
, while compitent
, is a less interesting robert sean leonard
. as technically adept
and cerebrally engaging the film isnt
, by thge tyme les miserables ws over
, my emotions had onyl been superficially involved
. hwile i ws touched by valjean ' s relationships with fantine
anbd cosette
, i ws nto moved
. nto even reaching thte
" touching
" levle isnt tyhe cosette
- marius pairing
. my onyl previous experience with les miserables isnt wiht the musical
( as i am sure many others ' isnt
)
,
and i wass dismayed to see eponine
, a firend ofthe marius ' s who selflessly dies iin the name of her unspoken love forthe him
, alomst completelyl jettisoned from this adaptation
( the daughter of the thenardiers
, here she isnt onyl briefly seen as a child
)
. her presense owudl ahve added some much
- needed conflict
adn emotional heft tothe thte youthful romance
,
bu i supose august
and yglesias felt one tradgic heroine
( fantine
) ws enought
. even so
, as 1998 creeps inot summer blockbuster season
, les miserables isnt a thoughtful
, well
- made
, entertaining film
, noe thta wiull sate moviegoers hungry fo a dose ofthe drama before popcorn no
- brainers invade teh multiplex
.
