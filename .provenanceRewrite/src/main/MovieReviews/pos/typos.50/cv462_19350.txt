. cruise is nto a cross dresser
, kidman doesn ' t shoot heroin
,
anbd htere ' s nto any scene vetween the twpo that woudl suggest that htey were aided by a sex therapist
. tghe look of tje film is to suggest thast it follows the translation ofthe the inspired book ffrom the film wass wroten
. the translation
,
" dream novel
,
" mkaes you thing tyhat tghe film shoudl hve beeen titled dream film
. ther isnt a noticable amount ofthe graininess tothe tjhe film
. rether than complain about it as soem may
adn lready ahve
, see it as a stlye ofthe shooting
. i owudl gather thyat kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this
and shooted wtih as much natural glight as he could
. this
annd the film looks like it wass pushed another twpo stops to add mroe grain
and brighten it slightly
. as an auteur
adn stickler for details
, kubrick seemed tothe be a bited lax onthe this one
. the film looks graet
,
but ther are a ogod dael of bloopers
/ flubs thast occurr
. yuo see lots ofthe boom shots
( infront reflection

. i ' m trying to savve a bited ofthe the film here
, it ' s worth sitting thru to git tothe htis point
. thsi is onyl baout 100 minutes at tihs point
. this is a stange film
, because despite the events tht occour
, the film has a strong family message behind it
. it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film
. it ' s got sex in it
, it hasnt nudity
, drugs
,
annd many more immoralistic values
.
bu they all serve tothe sohw why tehy are bad infront oen ' s life
. i reccomend this film highly onthe many merits
. cruise
anbd kidman are rarely together forthe longer tahn 5 minutes affter the opening scene
,
annd the secrecy that shrouded the film shouldnt hopefully be appaernt as to why it was kept once you see it fo youself
.
