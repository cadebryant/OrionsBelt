inaddition these days ofthe overlong movies
( meet joe balck
, the thin red line
, the mask of zorro
) it isnt a shame that films like waking ned devine can ' t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes
. tihs is just a cute movie
, even thru its mildly risque subject marter
. old friends jackie
( bannen
)
and michael
( kelley
) try to find hte lottery winner
( they deduce must live infront their dinky twon ofthe about 60
) so taht they might kiss uv tothe him
and share the winnings
. through proccess of elimination
, htey find thyat it must be lovable ood ned devine
, who tehy find sitting in front of his tv
, clutching the winning lottery ticket inspite his cold dead hand
. what results isnt thuroughly amusing
, as jackie trys to convince his wief tyhat not claiming it would be wrong
,
adn that they sould really benefit
. affter all
, ood ned won ' t miss it
. rather tahn divulge tje later twists
annd turns
, i ' ll stpo here mearly pointing outloud thta jackie
and michael get inot all sorts of trouble in theri little sleepy irish villiage
. bannen
adn kelly are a perfect pair
. oney slightly stout
, the otehr as thin as a rail
. both getting on in yeasr
, they make such a cute pair of old codgers
. waking ned devine may even be seen as a
" full monty
" for the geriatric setted
, especially sicne kelly gets buff
- o fo one amusing scene
. waking ned devine isnt by no means perfect
,
bu it isnt so sincere
adn touching tath it looks so much better than most films
. thge performances by everyone inwhich the twon are gerat
, particularly the two leads
. there is oen twist at tghe end which i find unnecessary
,
but it hardly ruins tje picture
. writter
/ director kirk jones should be held uv as an exemple to all thsoe hollywood screenwriters
. scripts as creative
annd endearing as this shoudln be the norm
, nto thge exception
. perphas it makes us appretiate htis wonderfull film even more
. had i held off onthe my year ' s best
/ worst list fo anohter day
, waking ned devine
( offically released infront lite november ofthe 98
) surely would have graced thte short group ofthe hte year ' s finest films
. it is glight
,
but throught provoking
and sweet
. i can ' t think of anyone who shouldn ' t see
( or wouldn ' t enjoy
) this film
.
