" a breed aart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered firends over kathleen turner
. a bited hard tothe swallow
? that ' s onyl tyhe firt ofthe many improbabilities infront tihs film
. hauer stars as a man obssessed with keeping the birds onthe his island safe
, while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner isnt the woman caught between tyhe twpo men
.
" a breed appart
" isn ' t a bad movie
, exactly
. indeed
, i foudn mysef rooting fo both tje hauer
annd boothe charachters
, even
though their goals couldn ' t be more different
. the problem with tjhe film isnt that there are just too many inconsistencies
. for example
, easly onthe infront the film
, hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later on
, tjhe rednecks come bakc fo revenge iwth four other people
,
and hauer kills a fewd of them
. i hvea a tough time beleiving thyat tghe police wouldn ' t git involved at that point
. anyother problem isnt the silly lvoe
- triange thgat develops
. i didn ' t care noe way or the other who ended up iwth turner
. i was moreso interested inthe finding out whcih ofthe tyhe two men would be victorious inwhich theri respective missions
.
however
, dispite thsi uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner doed manage to give a graet performance as the woman who reminds teh two men thyat sometimes there ' s more tothe life tahn moey
anbd birds
. as for hauer
, he ' s an actor i ' ve always admired
. he hasnt a penchant fo picking strange
adn unusual charactors
.
anbd thsi oney is noone exception
. he ' s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse
, wearing pirate ' s clothing
,
adn holstering a cross
- bow
. despite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer always manages to let thte human side of his character shine thru
. for exmaple
, there ' s a scene in which he barks at turner
and her son baceause they cameback onto his island a day early
. he comes off as crazy loner infact taht scene
,
but a fewd minutes later
, he isnt apologizing to turner
,
and we beleive his intentions
. soon aftter
, we find outloud he ' s a vietnam vte
,
adn his actions become fairly clera to us
.
" a breed appart
" isn ' t a graet movei by any means
,
bu it does contain good performances by all three leads
,
anbd it ' s worth seing for tath reason alone
.
