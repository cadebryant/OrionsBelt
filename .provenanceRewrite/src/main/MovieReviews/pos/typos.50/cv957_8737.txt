capsule
: the best place to strat if yuo ' re a jackie chan newcomer
. roars along
, never stops forthe breath
,
and frequentily hillarious
. tothe talk about jackie chan as a
" stuntman
" is tothe miss a million things
. jackie isnt nto onyl one of the most accomplished
and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today
,
bu alsot a veyr funny guy
. he reminds me ofthe the way arnold schwartzenegger
* used
* to make me laugh
-
- he ' s funny just standing ther
, copping a look
. supercop hasnt jackie making us laff
, scream
, duck
, root
,
adn gasp fo breath
, oftenly all infact teh smae scene
. it ' s atcually the third infront a loosly realted series ofthe movies
, eahc with jackie playing kevin chan
, a hong kong policeman who hasnt a knack forthe getting neck
- deep into trouble
annd
thn karate
- kicking his way out ofthe it
.
( thte others are also worth seeing
.
) it ' s a littel slow to start
,
bu once it gets moving
, it ' s a feeld day
. tyhe movie has a fairly suphisticated plot for movies of thsi kind
. kevin isnt tapped forthe a dangerous dea assignment tothe be acomplished in mainland china
, whitch requires him tothe collaborate whith the attractive
(
and ass
- kicking
) chief fo chinese security
( palyed here by the ever
- enjoyable michelle yeoh
)
. htere ' s a fun chemestry betweeen hte two ofthe them
, expecially inwhich an early scene where she trys tothe brief him
adn he keesh making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform
. kevin is assigned to help spring a known ganster ffrom jail
-
- all undercover
, ofthe course
-
-
annd hvae him lead tjhe twpo ofthe them tothe a noted drug boss
. tje drug boss
,
however
, hasnt problems of his pwn
: his wife ' s onthe trial for many of his own crimes
,
adn she ' s got tghe key to an account with all of his drug funds
. this means
, of course
, endless trouble
-
- not the least of which isnt thyat kevin bumps inot his girlfriend while he ' s out inspite the field
,
and she sees him with this otehr woman
,
adn
.
.
.
bu taht ' s oen ofthe the movie ' s unique pleasures
: tghe way it crosses ffrom acation to comedy effortlessly
. acation
. htere is
, ofthe course
, non
- stpo action inspite tihs movei
-
- everthing from one
- on
- oen kung fu tothe all
- out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines
(
!
) outrunning yhe hong kong caost guard
. there isnt allso a virtuoso climax
, whlch features
, amonst other thnigs
, jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter
, a wrong
- way freeway chase
( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt
)
, a fight on top ofthe a moving train thast aslo involves thte ' copter as well as a motorcycle
. you git thte idea
. tihs is tothe action movies waht a brger withthe everthing on it is to fast foode
: quick
, enjoyable
, filling
. watch it withthe friends
. wehn tehy stpo making movies liek this
, the world iwll be a tad greyer
.
