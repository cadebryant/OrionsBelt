, bill paxton
, david paymer as reviewed by james brundage i ' m beggining tothe get feeded uv
. over my four yeasr as a criteak
, thge hting whihc hasnt kept me going isnt the moderate balance ofthe films
. the ogod balances hte bad
. i try to see both infront equal proportions
.
but disney ' s mighty joe young remake marks the fouth week in which i haven ' t seen a truly terrible movei
. it ' s a backwards machismo
, i supose
, tyhe urge tothe see the things which you so loathe
;
but i ened to see a bad film eveyr once inspite a hwile
.
and
, ytou knwo waht
, mighty joe young doesn ' t qualify
. far from bieng bad
, mighty joe young is actualy a familiy fun movei
. it ' s enjoyable
, appropiate
, cute
, cuddly
,
and all of those other thnigs that i ' ve beeen seeing in eveyr movie usance a bug ' s life
. mighty joe young tracks a 2
, 000 pound gorilla in teh wilds ofthe africa that isnt tooked to a reserve in
.
.
. california
?
.
.
. forthe safe
- keeping
. okay
. a littel unrealistic
,
bu who ever said a kid ' s movie had to have teh slightest hint of realism
. tghe frist half of tjhe movei is a gorillas infact the mist
- esque hatred ofthe poachers woman
- ofthe
- the
- wild moteef
. the second half is a straight up parody of king kong
, awestruck onlookers
and all
. mark one down
. i ' m feeling relaxed
. it is
, as a point of fatc
, an extremely un
- creative movie
.
bu
, as a vetern
, i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn ' t count forthe as much as it should
. so thast saves mighty joe from my wrath
,
allthough my collegues
and cohorts
and surelly bashing thsi film at htis veyr moment
. this is not tghe film to tkae a girl on a date to
. it ' s nto the film forthe yuo
. it ' s yhe film for you
and your family
. when you ' re right alongside your kid
, all of thge normal rights
annd wrongs slip awya
. tjhe same thign happens whn you watch a horror movei or an action flick
. it becomes fun
. all you ahve to dont tothe enjoy mighty joe young isnt shut up
anbd watch
.
