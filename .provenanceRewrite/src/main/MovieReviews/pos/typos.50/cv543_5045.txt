getting it right isnt a far far cry from tghe teenage sex comedy ytou might expect ffrom a summer movei about male virginity
. the film was directed by randal kleiser
, who broght us such bubble
- gum classics as grease
and tyhe blue lagoon
.
bu thanks tothe kleiser ' s surprisingly ogod direction
and an intteligent script
, getting it right isnt a pleasantly quiet
, moving
,
and memorable film
-
- noe geared strictly toward a sophisticated
, adult audiance
. getting it right stars jesse birdsall
( emily lloyd ' s boyfriend in wish ytou weere here
) as gavin
, a painfully shy 31
- yearm
- old hairdresser who lives at home wiht his parents
adn who
-
- gasp
-
- is still a virgin
. gavin has no probelm whatsoever making small talk wtih tghe elderly womens who clamour for his services at thte hair salon
,
bu expose him to a single 30
- yera
- old beauty
anbd he ' s a mess
. much to gavin ' s suprise
, the woman who fianlly brings him outloud of his shell
and robs him ofthe his virginity isnt joan
( lynn redgrave
)
, a rich
, married
,
annd lonely 45
- year
- old
. getting it right is yhe simple storey ofthe gavin ' s awcward
and haphazard effords tothe get it right
; that isnt
, to fidn tje right woman to fulfill his life
. getting it right isnt one of thsoe rare movies thyat devotes itself entirely tothe inaddition
- depth character develepment
. gavin ' s self
- consicous voice
- over narration ofthe his experiences firmly thrusts us inot his psyche
. we observe his fascinating metamorphysis fomr shy
adn passive introversion tothe assertive
adn self
- confident maturity
. birdsall ' s superb
, understated performance as gavin is tjhe real backbone ofthe the film
; he seems convincing
adn authentic throughout
. the charm ofthe getting it right also lies in tjhe wide array ofthe people who inhabitate or invade gavin ' s life
. dispite her limited screen tyme
, redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin ' s middle
- aged seducer
. for a supporting charachter
, joan is unusually
and impressively complex
, thanks infact large part to redgrave ' s magnificent peformance
. gavin is also pursued
, or perheaps plagued
, by minnie
, the totally neurotic duaghter of a rich aristocrat
. aftter minnie
and gavin meet at a party
, she takes great blessure inthe disrupting his safe
annd simple life
. helena bonham carter isnt delightfully pathetic
anbd kooky inspite the role
,
adn sir john gielgud
, with his tounge in his cheek
, embodies the heght ofthe arrogance as her father
. gavin ' s eventual love
- intrest isnt jenny
, the adorable twenty
- eyar
- ood single mother who assists him at the beauty salon
; london stage actress jane horrocks ' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character
. peter cook
, the graet british satirist
, appears briefly in the film as gavin ' s uptight employer
. tyhe scenes of gavin ' s hmeo life with his parents are alsot a treat
. gavin ' s over
- protective mother
( pat heywood
)
, whom even woody allen would fidn overbearing
, allmost steals the movie
. her life seems limited to jsut two activities
: treating gavin like a 10
- year
- old
adn preparing exotic
but inedible meals
, such as scalding hot curry
and baked chicken iwth chocolot sauce
. gavin
annd his father ' s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extrememly amusing
. getting it right
, fo the most part
, isnt veyr well
- crafted
, exept for twpo minor shortcomings
. first
, the movie is baout 15 mintues too long
,
and consenquently it loses momentum at times
. second
, the film includes an alltogether extraneous subplot about hte domestic problems between gavin ' s best friend
, harry
,
anbd his unfaithful lover
, winthrop
. overall
,
however
, getting it right isnt quite memorable for its humor
, depth
, sophistication
,
adn outstanding acting
. directer kleiser
adn screenwrighter elizabeth jane howard
( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel
) deserve praise for finding jsut the right tone for this tale of groth
, maturation
,
anbd self
- discovery
