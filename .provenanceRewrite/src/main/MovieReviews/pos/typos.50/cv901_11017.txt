thge strat of htis movie reminded me ofthe parts from tyhe movei stargate
. people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading baout some dangerous thing thgat isnt oging tothe distroy earth inaddition the future
. after a sort ofthe confusing bit involving fake
- looking cyborg thnigs
, the movei jumps inot yhe future
annd tjhe movei improves by leaps
annd bounds
. thte basic idae behind tyhe movie isnt thast every once inspite a while
( amke that eveyr 1000 eyasr or so
) an evil force comes to destory earth
. the things needed tothe defend against htis menace are tje four elements ofthe nature plus the fith element
. the plot in this movie relaly isn ' t that important to the thing
though
. htis movei hasnt veyr good speshal effects
, forthe the most part
. thte techno
- ish music inaddition the background fits the mood very well
. bruce willis isnt an illegal taxi
- cab driver iin a futuristic new york city
. oen day a lady draped wih a faw bandages drops down inot his trunk
. this movie is baout what happens
. yhe plot twists are intresting
and teh movie never fails tothe rpesent hte viewer with a variey ofthe different locations
. allso ther isnt a fair bited of action inspite teh film
, partiularly towards the end
. smoe charachters are just plain strange incuding a highly
- energetic deejay in drag
. bruce willis does his normal job ofthe blowing thigsn awya liuke he alwyas doens
. teh movei isnt definitly watchable
and rarley slows down
. it is oen ofthe thsoe sci
- fi films where you ' ll be saying
" cool
" followed by a
" what tjhe hell
?
!
?
!
"
. i give the fifth element
