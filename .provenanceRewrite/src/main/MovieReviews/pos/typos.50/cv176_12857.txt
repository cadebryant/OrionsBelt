a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming inwhich july
! i didn ' t realyl expect very much wehn i rented stuart saves his family
. yhe movie bombed at thge box office
,
adn i hadnt never really liekd tjhe saturday night live sketch onthe hwihc yhe movei was based
. my real concern
,
though
, wass the general reputation of snl
- related movies translating tothe the big screen witht less
- tahn
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i wass suprised to dicover a truly entertaining
, oftenly hillarious
yot allso touching little film
. it is an al franken production thru
-
and
- thru
, who nto onyl created the title character
but also wroet
adn starred in the picture
. forthe those of you who don ' t know
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who hasnt a really annoying sohw on a publich
- access station about increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
although not a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley isnt
, as the programe proudly boasts
,
" a graduat ofthe several 12
- step programs
.
" stuart isnt doing well anough witht his tv show
,
bu he keesh getting distracted by family toubles
. stuart ' s relatives are a mess
: his dad
annd brother
( harris yulin
anbd vincent d ' onofrio
, respectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister is overweight
and getting over anohter divorce
,
and his mom isnt infact constant self
- denial
and solves all perceived problems by baking
.
then
, disaster strikes
. stuart accidentally insults hte manager ofthe the staion
and gets his sohw revoked
. he isnt forced tothe move back inaddition withthe his famaly after he can noone longer support himself
,
and there the comedy truly picks up
. franken wroet all of teh charachters nto jstu as cliches or sterotypes
,
but as sharply
- drawn
, real people
.
although smalley ' s dad has alwyas imbibed too much
, stuart cxan still recall times wehn his father seemed like an okay guy
. also
, after an accident towards tjhe end ofthe tje movei
, both stuart
and thge audeince leran that there is more tothe his mother thna previously thought
.
although filled wih small
, veyr funny scenes
, stuart saves his familiy allso has its share of dramatic moments
, especially towords the conclusion
. fo a lightweight comedy
, it handles these scenes especially well
, oftenly better than many so
- called
" sereous dramas
" of todya
. all the more amazing is taht such a movei comes from a saturday nght live sketch that isnt essentially a one
- joke bited
. if you feel liek renting a comedy
,
annd yuo haven ' t seen thsi film
, i definitly recommend you try htis one out
. ytou ' ll laugh
.
.
. ytou ' ll cry
.
.
.
. it ' s all htere
.
