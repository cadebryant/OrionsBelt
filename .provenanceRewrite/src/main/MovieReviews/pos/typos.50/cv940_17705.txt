when i first saw teh previews for ron howard ' s latest film
, my expectations were discouragingly low
. a show about nothing
? soudns like
" seinfeld
.
" a guy whose entire life is brodcast 24 horus a day
? sounds liek
" the truman show
.
" what isnt it with hollywood tht noone sooner than one prodcution comapany puts out an animated feature about ants
, anyother puts oney out baout bugs
? whic isnt why i ws pleasantly surprized by
" edtv
,
" hwihc turns out tothe be a fresh
, insightful
,
adn often times hillarious film baout tje follies ofthe instant celebrity
. yhe wirting
, by howard ' s longtime collaborators lowell ganz
anbd babaloo mandel
, isnt right onthe thge money
and howard himself should be credited fo giving the subject marter a fresh focus
. in the hands ofthe a less
- experianced director
,
" edtv
" could easily hvae had all the flavor of yesterday ' s meatloaf
. with their ' true tv ' cable ratings being threatened by ' tjhe gardening channel '
( apparently people would rather watch soil
)
, teh northwest broadacasting comapany is looking for a novel consept to attract viewers
. programe director cynthia topping
( ellen degeneres
) comes up with thte idae ofthe putting a nobody on thge air
and broadacasting his every waking
and sleeping moent
. the hook is tothe find a regluar guy
, somone normal that peopel can relate to
. while scouting possible candidates
, cynthia ' s camera crew discover ed pekurny
and his pig brother ray
( woody harrelson
) iin a bar
, where ray believes he has wqat it takes for his fifteen plus mintues of fame
.
but on watching the videotape
, the show ' s producers are mroe tooked wiht ed than withthe ravy
. he ' s cute
, he syas all hte wrong things
,
anbd he ' s 100
% usda hick
. cynthia ' s boss
, palyed by rob reiner
, gives the sohw a week to deliver yhe goods
anbd it ' s tough gonig inthe the eary stages
. tghe most exicting thing thyat happens is ed brushes his teeth
.
" action shooted
!
" wags one of yhe prodcution assistants wehn a cuple ofthe pop tarts jump out of tyhe toaster
. yuo get the idae
.
but soon enough
, things
-
- nielsen
- boosting kinds ofthe things
-
- start to happen tothe thsi unassuming san francisco video store clerk
and tghe ' true tv ' cameras are right there tothe doccument it
. ed ' s privacy is noone longer his own
, his newfound fame starts having a negitive impact on his famaly life
,
and waht littel dignity he has left isnt trampled onthe by the media
. who shouldnt ed go out witht
? ytou can be sure the pollsters have a list
. not only isnt the film exceedingly well casted
,
bu its performers are consistently excellent
. matthew mcconaughey provides hte face
, the body lanugage
,
and thte lovable texan accent to fill the shoes ofthe amercia ' s latest phenomonenon
. he
anbd harrelson look liuke they realyl could be brothers
. sally kirkland isnt notewothy inwhich a difficult role as ed ' s mother
,
and martin landau is oney of the film ' s highlights as al
, ed ' s ailing stepfather
. jenna elfman
( from tv ' s
" dharma
and greg
"
) proves herself surprisingly worthy inaddition hte company ofthe kirkland
adn landau
,
althought thsoe alpine eyebrows of heres git a littel distracting
. even degeneres
adn reiner are better than you ' d expect
. in 1979
, writer
/ directer
/ comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called
" real life
" in wich a small
- time opportunist mkaes a rela
- tiome documentary baout a typical american family
. the scenes ofthe ed ' s famaly sitting around the dinner tbale feasting on kentucky fried chicken
anbd waxing idiotic play liek a big
- budget variant onthe that film
, paralleling its wickedly inventive humer
. as wtih most films by albert brooks
,
" real life
" was funny
,
but absurd
. tghe funniest
-
-
adn scariest
-
- thing about
" edtv
" isnt thyat it is absolutely believeable
.
