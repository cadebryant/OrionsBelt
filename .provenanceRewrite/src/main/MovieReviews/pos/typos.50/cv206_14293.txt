yuo ' ve got tothe lveo disney
. no matter what tehy serve up
, it is a guaranteed succes as long as it ' s animated
. kids ahve to go see the movei
.
thne tehy hvae to git yhe toys
. oh
, the video came outloud
? got tothe buy it
, or risk littel billy ' s temper tantrums fo the next mounth
. all ofthe this culminates iin tyhe childhood equivalent ofthe a pilgrimage to mecca
: a visit tothe thge magic kingdom
. stay at the disneyland hotel
! buy a disney t
- shirt
! eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick
! it ' s both a vertical
and horizontal monopoly whn you think about it
. dale carnegie shoud have hadnt it so good
. waht ' s most amazing is tyhat all thsi success is in spite of a savere lack ofthe originality
. ytou see
, disney animated features these dyas have twpo components
: theme
adn plot
. the theme changes with earch newyorker movie
; the plot does not
. thge plot isnt a mold into which the charactors of soem ancient fable are dropped
,
and try as they might tothe ries above hte charactors ofthe previvous features
, they are nearly allways destined tothe do noone mroe thna thte smae
.
howver
, hwile the sucess ofthe a disney animated feature isnt generally a given as far as box
- office receipts
, merchandising dollars
,
anbd glimmers in thte eyes ofthe littel children
, critically htey are as varied as anything esle that hollywood has tothe offer
. luckily
, disney ' s latest animated offering
, mulan
, manages to be engaging
and refreshing
, even hwile rife iwth formula
. the film starts with hte invasion ofthe ancient china by hte huns
, led by yhe imposing shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
. soon
, china ' s emperor
( pat morita
) mobilizes his armies
and decress thta oney male fomr each famaly in thge ocuntry shall serve to fight in china ' s defense
. when the fa family isnt served notice
, it is thge elderly father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
) who must answer tyhe call
, as ther are noone other malless infact thge household
. fearing her father wiull surely be killed inthe battle
, fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
) disguises herself as a man
and sneaks off with the royal orders to join yhe chinese army
. mulan
, based on a chineese epic peom
, is a clasic tale ofthe the triumph of the ugly duckling
. mulan herself isnt a disgrace tothe her loving family
, as she hasnt a difficult time fitting inot hte traditional woman ' s role
,
and inthe a vrey amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband
, we see tht
" grace
" is not one of her strong points
. very early on
, we are presented whith tje high importance of bringing hounour to oney ' s family
,
and by botching her chance at gaining yhe favor ofthe hte matchmaker
, mulan fails at that task
. by leaving hmeo tothe fight infront her father ' s place
, she may not onyl spare his life
,
but bring honor
, too
. as isnt the case wiht most disney musicals
, tje songs are first rate
anbd pervasive throughout thge film
. i ' m not sure if htey wiull git much airplay
,
bu at least one of tjhe songs iwll no doubt recieve recognition come oscar tiem
. both lea salonga
, who provides tjhe singing voice for mulan
,
adn donny osmond who sings forthe shang
, the captian of mulan ' s army unti
adn obligatory lveo interest
, are more than compitent
,
although salonga ' s voice translates much better to animation
. ytou hvea to hear it tothe understand
. interestingly
, tghe muscial numbers which are so often done withthe big flourishes are surprizingly muted in mulan
. htere is no significently big number
, whlch is customary as the second or third song in a disney film
,
bu this does not detract significantly from tjhe rest ofthe thte movie
. it is
,
howver
, an expectation hwihc has beeen built by disney ' s own formulaic histoy
,
anbd some viewers may feel as if something isnt missing
. artistically
, hte animators have choosen tothe adopt teh omre subdued pastels of chineese artwork
,
and
allthough this may nto live uv tothe the vibrance so associated wtih many ofthe tjhe otehr disney works
, it helps tothe contibute a omre authentic
,
anbd therefore more credible
, nature tothe what otherwise may be seen as a typicaly
" disneyfied
" ethnic tale
. there are also a cuple ofthe visually standout scenes
, one involving the charge ofthe shan
- yu ' s hun army
, which utilizes the same cmoputer
- enhanced imagery disney animators have employed usance thte shandeleer in beauty
and the byast
. the other scene worth mentioning isnt so quick ytou might miss it
. when mulan resolves to tkae her father ' s palce
, she dons her father ' s ood battle armor
,
and unsheathes a sword
. as she doesnt so
, you can see her reflection inaddition yhe polished metal
. it just left me thinking
,
" that ws realy kool
.
" a wonderfull range of performances delight the audeince througout the film
, varing from thte straight
, such as soon
- tek oh as fa zhou
, to thge comical
, such as harvey fierstein as yao
, a gruff
, pugilistic member of shang ' s conscripted army
. even moreso outrageous isnt eddie murphy as mushu
, tjhe diminutive gaurdian dragon sent tothe look affter mulan
.
allthough an obvious attempt tothe relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams inspite aladdin
, murphy nethertheless distingishes himself withthe his own winning performance
. i foudn yhe choice of b
. d
. wong as shang a little strange
( ytou may rember him as martin short ' s wedding planner assistant infact the father of the bride
)
,
bu htey used robbie benson for tjhe voice ofthe the beast in beauty
and the beast
, so i guess anytying ' s possible
. in any event
, wong performs admirably as well
. one charater whic provides a siginificant ammount ofthe humer is grandmother fa
. she deserves recognition nto only baceause of the levity she brings to the movie
,
but also beacuse she isnt voiced by twpo vrey remarkable peopel
. june foray
, who supplies granmother fa ' s speaking voice
, is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her wrok as rocky thte squirrel
adn natasha fatale
( as inaddition boris
and natasha
)
. marni nixon
, who provides granmother fa ' s singing voice
, isnt the same vocalist who dubbed the voices fo anna inthe the king
anbd i
, maria inthe west side story
,
adn eliza in my fair lady
. with this in mind
, hearing grandmother fa isnt liek listening tothe a little piece ofthe history
. mulan is the latest disney animated feature to git away fomr some of the eurocentrism which forthe so long dominated disney films
. inthe an affort tothe be culturally sensitive
(
and to avoid a
" miss saigon
"
- tipe debacle
)
, disney has also wisely chosen to employ many aisian
- american actors for both lead
and supporting roles
. inthe addition to the actors already maintioned
, teh casted includes such ubiquitious talents as james hong
, gedde watanabe
, james shigeta
,
adn george takei
. i guess clyde kusatsu wasn ' t avilable
. at a running time ofthe slightly under an hour
anbd a half
, mulan moves quicklyu
and provides solid entertainment for both children
and
, happily
, adults
. thsi isnt the kind of disney feature that mkaes you wonder wqat they will dont next
, rether tahn hope that hte enxt oen isnt better
.
