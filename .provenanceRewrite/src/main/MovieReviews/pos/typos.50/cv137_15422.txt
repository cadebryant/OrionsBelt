as yhe film opens uv
, expectant unwed mother sally
( played by drew barrymore
) encounters her baby ' s father in a fast food drive
- thru window
. aftter he gets his milkshake
, he drives off
, only tothe be pursued by a millitary helicopter
. from this moment forward
, ytou know thgat this isn ' t going tothe be your run
- of
- yhe
- mill romantic comedy
. home fries tells thge tale of the relationship betweeen sally
and dorian
( palyed by luke wilson
)
, a helecopter pilot who has a different kind ofthe conection whith sally
.
.
. more than he would care to admit
( hint
: it has something to dont wih the father ofthe sally ' s unborn child
)
. after taking a personel
(
anbd proffesional
) interest inthe her
, he finds work at tyhe local fast fod restaurant at whihc she works
,
and the fun goes onthe ffrom htere
. this movei is a lot of funn
. it isnt commedic onthe twpo levels
, as a romantic comedy
and a dark comedy
. the rumatic moments are sweet
,
yot not sappy
. oen ofthe tyhe more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes
.
howver
, the dark comedic moments are more memorable
. thsi isnt alsot a tale of revenge
,
and a funny one at thast
. the father ofthe sally ' s unborn child also happened tothe be a married man
, whose wief is plyed by catherine o ' hara
. she does a wonderfull portrayal ofthe a jealous wief who isnt targeting the person who had an afair
,
anbd isnt not above getting otehr people tothe dont her dirty work
.
( my appologies if this soudns cryptic
,
bu there isnt too much ofthe thte plot tothe give awya
)
. rounding outloud the cast are jake busey as angus
, dorian ' s overzealous brother
and daryl mitchell as roy
, dorian ' s trainer at yhe fast food restaurant
. the dialogue isnt sharp
and nto filled withthe sappy overtones
, even wtih the romantic nature of the plot
. if there are any complaints
, it isnt over drew barrymore ' s performance
. while she does light uv hte screen
, ther are moments whn she doesn ' t seem all tht convincing
. teh movei wass filmed infact texas
,
anbd most ofthe the characters have southern texan accents
. drew barrymore ' s accent tends to come
anbd go
( luke wilson doesn ' t seem to have tihs probelm
)
. as well
, she seems awfully agile forthe a woman that is eight monthes pregnant
. still
, htis movei isnt one thta iwll please many viewers
. wiht plot twists galore
and hillarious dark moments
, htis isnt sure to entertain
.
