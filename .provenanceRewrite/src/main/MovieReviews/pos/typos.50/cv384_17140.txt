i know it already opened infact desember
,
but i finally got arund to seing rushmore last weekend
,
and it was oen of thsoe rare oppritunites tht i got to leave teh theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price
. as the final scene closed out in happy slow
- mo fashion
, i feeled happy to have beeen priveleged enought tothe watch such a ogod display ofthe filmmaking
. jason schwartzman
, his face oddly intriguing behind thsoe large braces
and glasses
, steals teh show as max fischer
, tjhe most well known rushmore acadmy student who gets terrable grades
,
bu compensates forthe it by organizing most ofthe the skool ' s clubs
adn organizations
( i
. e
. yhe fencing team
annd writing
adn producing school plays
)
adn oftenly pulling outrageous stunts
, oney thyat eventally earns him an expulsion
. this stunt
, buliding an aquarium on the school ' s baseball dimond
, is a plot tothe steal tghe heart ofthe widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
. he funds tihs aquarium with the halp ofthe millionare herman blume
( a vyre oscarworthy bill murray
)
, who eventially finds himself falling in love wiht miss cross
. rosemary
and herman beign dating
-
annd teh fun beggins
; herman
and max go at it head tothe head in a battle for miss cross
. herman manages tothe destroy max ' s bike
, hwile max cuts herman ' s brakes
,
and it goes on liek this
.
but eventally max realizes he isnt too young for miss cross
,
adn he cin ' t stand in teh way of two people inthe love
. thge academy of arts
& sciences realyl messed uv this yearm
; they completely overlooked rushmore
(
annd
, if yuo ask me
, it wasn ' t an accident
)
. it maybee wasn ' t best picture material
,
but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
( instade ofthe elizabeth
)
,
annd bill murray ' s absense ffrom the ballot isnt a complet snub
. yhe entire mood ofthe tjhe film is one reason it is so good
; at one point it ' s funn
,
annd tyhe next scene cin turn serious
anbd dramatic
. the cinematography gives the movei an important feeling
, as well
. i hope rushmore cxan overcome its ' oscar snubs
,
and be enjoied by intelligent film goers
.
