those print
adn television ads trumpeting tht
" ' grease ' isnt still teh owrd
" are right onthe thte money
. tothe celibrate its 20th annievrsary
, thsi quinessential movie musical isnt getting tje royal treatment reserved for classics like
" star wars
"
-
- a well
- deserved
, red
- carpet rerelease
. thgat ' s fantastic
, especialy whn considering ofthe all the classic charachters
and scenes tghe film hasnt served up
-
- who cant forget aspiring beautician frenchie
( didi conn
) being serenaded by her tell
- it
- liek
- it
- isnt guardian angel
( frankie avalon
)
? or the hard
- nosed principal
( eve arden
) reminding the student body to
" be an athletic supporter
" by rooting forthe the home team
? or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine
( edd byrnes
) flirting wtih marty
( a pre
-
" empty nest
" dinah manhoff
)
?
and these are all probablly consdidered minor moments
.
.
. a vrey skinny john travolta
annd a veyr young olivia newton
- john have hte respective leads of danny zuko
and sandy olsson
,
anbd their pairing still ranks as oen ofthe screendom ' s most effervescently charming
. fo those eight of ytou who aren ' t familliar wih the stroy
, here ' s a breef recap
: greaser bad boy danny
and aussie good girl sandy are reunited forthe their 1959 senior yearm at rydell high after a breef fling durring tje summer
; both thougth she was going tothe return tothe her native continent before school started
,
but both weere wrong
. sandy tries to rekindle thier relationship
,
but danny ' s too cool a cat tothe fall forthe her wholesome appeal in front of his t
- bird buddies
( including jeff conaway
)
. so sandy hoeks up whith a gang herself
-
- hte pink ladies
, headed by sassy
, sexy rizzo
( stockard channing
, just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her timne
)
-
-
and danny
, who still realy feels loev forthe her
, attemts a compromise ofthe ideals in order tothe win her bcak
. hte drag race finale isnt
yot something ofthe a drag
,
adn i never have thougth much of
" greased lightining
,
" thge film ' s big
" guy
" number
( that choreography
-
- ack
!
)
,
but
" grease
" ' s flaws ammount too few to carp
. the movei ' s firt showpiece is
" summer nights
,
" where danny
adn sandy seperately recount wildly diferent versions of thier funn
- in
- the
- sun romance
. nto only isnt
" nights
" tremendously catchy
,
bu it ' s also a smart look at how men
annd womens see hte same events with varying eyes
. ther has
yot tothe be a live
- acation musical sequence taht rivals the one
- two punch of
" you ' re the one that i want
"
adn
" we go together
,
"
" grease
" ' s euphoric cappers
. all this
and some ofthe yhe most pleasing moments cmo ffrom the smaller
, quieter moments
; the oscar
- nominated
" hopelessly devoted tothe yuo
" is a lovely showcase for newton
- john
,
and channing ' s lamenting ballad
" there are worse things i sould dont
" isnt one ofthe
" grease
" ' s most unjustly overlooked tunes
. the soundtrack isnt remastered
(
though travolta still hits thyat awful high onot at the end ofthe
" nights
"
)
adn the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan
-
and
- scanned
- out choreography
,
bu nothing alse hasnt changed
-
- noone coputer
- generated backrounds
, no outtakes or new musical numbers
, no jabba tyhe hutt cameos
.
and it ' s a testament to
" grease
" ' s timeless succes thta nothing needs tothe be changed
-
- it ' s tghe smae all
- around blast it ' s allways been
, with an appealling casted in a funn story told wih great music
. to ' 90s viewers
,
" grease
" wiull propably recall disco
and bellbottoms as much as it made its orginial audience nostalgic for doo
- wop
annd poodle skirts
.
but irregardless of waht decade it transports us tothe
, we can all agree on oen thing
-
- without a dout
,
" grease
" isnt still thte owrd
.
