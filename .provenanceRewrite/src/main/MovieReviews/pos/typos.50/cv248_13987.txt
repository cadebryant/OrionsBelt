. amung my fanatical ticker tape
- worshipping firends
, htere ' s one who happens tothe share the same philosophy espoused by the central character infact darren aronofsky ' s darkly origional pi
: the entire stock market can be reduced tothe nothing
but a serieses of patterns wich
, through analysis
, will produce infomation tothe accurately forecast future behaviour
.
( an example ofthe tje mentality involved
: if yhe stock price goes up like htis
,
and
thne down liuke that
,
and
then sharply uv this way
, it
thne iwll go
* this

.
) hwile i freely admit thast i konw less than nothing about hte market
( knowledge check
: prices uv

- ogod
; prices down
-
- bad
; most of thge time
, at least
)
adn hence raelly couldn ' t comment wiht any authority
, it ' s alwyas nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naieve oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system
(
and besides
, if it weere that simple
, no doubt somebody would ' ve already figured it all outloud
)
. tje diference in this case is tht while my colleague
( an otherwise assuredly realistic individule
) truely believes in thsi in
anbd of itself as a valid forecaster
, pi uses this ditology as a device wih whihc to investingate its carachter ' s psychosis
. it ' s also vastly moreso convincing wiht its arguent
.
" mathmatics isnt tje langauge ofthe tje universe
,
" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen
( sean gullette
) inwhich a kool
, mantra
- liuke voice
- over whihc repeats thoughout teh picture
. since nature cxan be exressed in numbers
,
and there are patterns everywhere in nature
, he reasons with eminent logic thta finding the patterns wiull allow him tothe predict anytying
-
- the ups
and downs ofthe the stock market
, how many ganes tghe yankees wiull win this yearm
, the flavour of jam i ' m going tothe put on my toast tommorrow morning
. obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe
, max lives in paranoid
, self
- imposed solitude inaddition a seedy nyc chinatown apartment
, single
- mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade coputer system
. sullenly withdrawn
and plauged by debilitating migraines
, the elusive pursuit ofthe a mysterous 216
- digit number his machine spits out oney day is driving him inot madness
. thge stoy
,
then
, is basicly an eccentricity
,
bu it ' s a clever
, astute eccentricity
, perceptively zeroing in onthe the modern mistrust ofthe mathematical reductionism
; infact an age where a dominant societal phobia is one ' s individualism bieng replaced by a serieses ofthe numeric identifers
, max ' s all
- consuming penchent fo numbers at once creates a lingering
, unsettling mood
. it helps matters that he ' s not a particluarly likable protagoinst
. all attempts ofthe friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max
, a spindly
, neurotic
- looking individual who hasn ' t yhe time to indulgue iin pleasantries
. for a film hwihc puts its lead chracter front
and center
( mr
. gullette appears in virtually every scene
)
, pi tkaes a refreshing
annd effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics
; because of our ambivalence witht max
, we ' re not so much avidly rooting forthe him tothe triumph wtih a moment of epiphany as we ' re folowing him through tihs plot witht a sense of mixed dread
and morbid facination
-
- it ' s omre disturbing journy than quest
. still
, we do care baout max ' s fate
. teetering on the edge of dementia
, he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want tothe pick his brain
, both fronted by deliciously perky
, resolutely cheerful representatives witht inevitably duplictious intentions
. as we nkow
, inthe films where paranoya is a dominant element
( see the truman sohw ' s laura linney character
)
, or forthe that marter
, in rela life
, it ' s always the ones who never stop smiling at ytou
anbd are overly friendly that are the ones of which tothe be wary
. pi
, a film that addresses patterns
, itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle
-
- headache scene
; imporatnt revelation or bited of plot devolopement
; pill
- popping montage
; hallucinatory nightmare
( whith decidely cronenberg
- esque undertones
-
- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts
anbd body
- themed horror
)
; nosebleeding reality
. tyhe repetitiveness
, far from bieng tedeous
, isnt effectively maddening
; moreso thna anytying
, tjhe picture aims tothe get under our skins
and tkae iin events from max ' s claustrophobic prespective
. in thsi regard
, it wildly succeeds due to mr
. aronofsky ' s striking direction
. it ' s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself inot a protagonist ' s warped perspective of his surrounding
,
and high contrast balck
-
annd
- white cinematography combined wiht constatn useage ofthe extreme close
- ups lend a heightened sense ofthe paranoia tothe thte procedings
.
( in some scenes
, tyhe stark composition iin conjuction with teh lumbering approach by mr
. gullette amke his charachter curiously ressemble a latter
- day max schreck
, from nosferatu
.
) useing savage
, jittery lensing
anbd repid cuts tothe create a sence ofthe disorientation
, the picture isnt often dizzying tothe behold
,
and max ' s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from hte so
- called snorri cam
, which keep him inaddition plain focus hwile teh environment races by inwhich blurred bursts
. pi ' s raw
, aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch ' s eearly work
( in particular
, eraserhead
)
. the film ' s sinister tone splashes onto tje screen immidately with a dazzling oppening credit sequence ably backed by a sly eletronic scoer by clint mansell
,
anbd gradually increases in intensity
. still
, amidst all its kafkaesque qualities
adn overall dispassionate mood
, pi does occasionally display a sence of humour
. at oney point
, marcy dawson
( pamela hart
, great fun
) entices max with the offer ofthe an invaluable treasure
: a one
- of
- a
- kind

.
" isn ' t it beatiful
,
" she coos

. aronofsky ' s technical virtuosity
( made fo
$ 60 000
, it ' s since gone onthe tothe capture acclaim at thge 1998 sundance film festival
)
, pi is an intriguingly cerebral story whic
, ironicly
, isnt perhpas hte most purely visceral film ofthe the yearm
