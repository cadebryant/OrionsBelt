deepo rising is noe ofthe
" those
" movies
. tyhe kind of movei which serves noone purpose exept tothe entertain us
. it does not ask us to think baout important questions liuke life on otehr planets or tje possiblilty thast htere isnt no god
.
.
. scre that
, it says boldly
, let ' s see soem coputer generated monsters rip inot
, decapitate
anbd generaly cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of littel known actors
. heh
! them wacky monsters
, gotta love ' em
. of course
, since we can rent baout a thousand b movies wiht tje same kind of stroy
, hollywood must give that little extra
" oumph
" tothe get people in theaters
. thta is where deep rising fails
, which isnt a ogod thnig
. confused
? let me explain
: dispite all them flashy effects
and big explosions
, deepo rising is still
, at heart
, a good ' ol b movie
. luckly
, it ' s a vyre good b movie
. hte worst cliches inwhich movei hitory are a b movei ' s bread
and buter
. therfore
, things thast would destroy a sereous movie actually help us have a ogod tyme hwile watching a movei of lower calibre
. of course we knwo ther ' s a big slimy creature behind that doorjam
, tht oen person wiull wander off to be picked off by said monster
and we always nkow which persons or person iwll mkea it outloud alive
. we just don ' t knwo wehn or how horrible it iwll be
. i went to see deep rising with my expections low
adn my tolerence for bad dialogue high
. imagin my suprise when i dicover thast deep rising is atually
, well
, pretty darn funny at times
. a funny b movie
? well
, thyat ' s new
. these ficks are not supposed to make us laff
.
( except fo a few unintended laughs once a while
.
)
and befor you know it
, treat williams
, wes studi
anbd famke jansen apearing on tje big screen
. hey
! i know them guys
(
and gal
) fomr a couple of otehr movies
. cool
. familliar faces
. so far so ogod
. our man treat is the hero
, he ' ll live
. wes is a staple ofthe b movies
, he is thte token victim
. we know he ' ll buy yhe farm
bu he will take a few creeps with him onthe tghe way out
. famke is the babe
, ' nuff said
. there is also a guy with glasses
( the guy with glasses alwyas dies
) a balck person
( b movie buffs konw that the black guy allways dies
, never fails
)
annd a very funny
, nerdy guy
.
( ah
! comic releaf
. how can we possably explain having to kill him
.
.
. let him live
.
) after tghe first fifteen minutes i feeled right at hmeo
. i nkow who tothe root fo
and who i need tothe boo too
and a gum tothe chew
.
( please kill me
.
) suffice it to sday thast fo tghe enxt hour
anbd a half i jumped outloud ofthe my seat a fewd times
, whent
" ewwww
" about a dozen times
and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions
and firepower our hreoes weere packing
. i ' m a man
, we nottice theese thigsn
. all in all
, i ' d recommend deep rising if you are looking for a ogod timne
adn care to leave your brain at the doorjam
.
.
.
bu bring your sence ofthe humor
anbd excitment in with yuo
. the acting is decent
, the effects top rate
. how to best discribe it
? put together the jet ski scene from hard rain
, tjhe bug attacks fomr starship troopers
, a couple ofthe james bond liuke stunts
and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth
annd freddy where you keep screaming
" don ' t go htere
, he ' s behind yuo
"
anbd yuo end uv wiht deepo rising
. forthe creepy crawly goodness
, tight t
- shirts
, major firepower
and yhe ened tothe go to the bathroom every fifteen mintues from seing all taht water
.
