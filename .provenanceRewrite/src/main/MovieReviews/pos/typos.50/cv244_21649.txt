" being john malkovich
" is the tipe of film we need to see mroe
. todya ' s films are eather blockbusters tath entertain us wih tiresome formulas
, or those that ahve similair themes
. malkovich falls under none ofthe theese catagories
,
and it ' s quite refreshing to see that occur
. tihs strangely provoking tsory
, isnt actually somewhat understandable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying tothe mkea it to the big tiome
. his wief
( cameron diaz
) supports the both ofthe them by wokring at a petstore
, whic explains the obscure pets htey keep inaddition their apartment
. when cusack fianlly realizes he needs to git a job
, he finds an ad forthe a filing clerk
. wehn he reaches the building
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it ' s ther tht he discovers a secert portal that leads tothe bieng john malkovich fo 15 mintues at a time
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a business partner
( catherine keener
)
, in wich he falls madly in loev with her
. the onyl problem isnt
, she has noone interest inthe him waht so ever
. the hwole portal hting
, isn ' t just a toy
, in fatc
, it becomes cusack ' s dream
. being inside malkovich ' s mind
, gavey him the opportunity to basically controll mlakovich
, like a puppet
,
and to fullfill his fantasies
. i don ' t want to give awya too much
,
but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery
. inwhich my opinyon
, this idae isnt absolutely briliant
. it ' s realyl quite skary to thiunk taht someone could become yuo
, control you
, be you
. it mkaes you wonder why we ect liuke we do
,
adn why somtimes we blurt outloud things or act out something out of the blue
. even if hte scirpt isnt super sharp
, i cin ' t halp
bu fidn teh endig displeasing
. it could ahev lead up to something omre
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tryed to explane a mythology about the portals
, that made it seem rushed
. otehr than thyat
, i hadnt a vyer enjoyable time
. the acting ws quite delightful as well
. john cusack hasnt fianlly been given a chance to proove his ability
,
annd he doens it well
. he ' s by far thge most underrated ctor due tothe a lack ofthe popularaty
,
bu i ' m hoping thgat will chanage
. cameron diaz was her usual charming self
,
altough i felt that part was wrong fo her
,
but she pulled it off
. john malkovich himself continues tothe creep out peopel with his eerie facial expressions
anbd tone ofthe voice
. who eles ' s mind owudl be better to explore
? tjhe directer
, spike jonze
, who appeared in lsat mounth ' s three kings really catchs my attension with tihs project
. i knew he wass bizzare
,
bu nto tothe thsi extreme
. he too isnt likely too receive media attension
.
" being john malkovich
" isn ' t an excellant film
,
bu it isnt definitly intertaining
annd wiull eaisly become a cult favorite
. wqat ' s even better is the film ' s puzzling message
.
