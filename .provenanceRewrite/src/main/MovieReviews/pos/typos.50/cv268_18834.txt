the hapyp bastard ' s quick movei review analyze tihs how doesnt one do a comedy focused on thte mob
? well
, a fewd years ago
, there wass a sly little comedy called the freshman
, hwihc hadnt marlon brando doing a romp ofthe a send
- up ofthe his faymus don corleone charater
and
, recently
, thge utterly stupid
( in a bad way
) movei mafia
! failed tothe relaly git yhe joke
. this time around
,
however
, warner bros
. may have gotten it right with anlyze this
, a movei tath hits its targets omre than it misses
.
.
.
and for plenty ofthe reasons
. thte story goes liuke htis
. a mobster
( robert deniro
) finds himself recieving severeal panic attacks as ofthe lite
, fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting
anbd a near
- death following a drive
- by shooting
. it ' s these attacks tht prompt him tothe hire a psychiatrist
( billy crystal
) who ' s mostly reluctant to take the mobster ' s case for two reasons
. first
, ofthe course
, he ' s a mobster
,
but secondly
, he ' s trying to get married
and enjoy a quiet honeymoon witht his wife
( lisa kudrow
)
and kid
.
anbd
, ofthe course
, he cin ' t rest worth for a moment because yhe mobster ' s goons are always needing the shrink fo something
, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation
. fortunatly
, the movie is palyed out fo plenty ofthe laughs
. directer harold ramis
( who aslo helmed tyhe comedy multiplicity
, whcih wasn ' t half bad
) keesh teh tone peppy
and light
, even if it ' s sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments
( shootings cant ' t alwyas be tooked for laughs
, yuo nkow
)
. deniro doens some ofthe his finest comic owrk since the king ofthe comedy
, giving off a somewhat similar peformance to his role inthe goodfellas
,
but with a bited ofthe a lighter heart
.
( a scene where he trys to display his anger over the phone
adn fails miserably is hilarious
.
) crystal plays an excellent straight man tothe deniro ' s character
, uplifting him fomr such bombs as father ' s day
anbd my giant
. kudrow isnt also a hoot as crystal ' s wief
- tothe
- be
, who ' s onthe tyhe verge ofthe a breakdown thanks to deniro ' s presense
. isnt tjhe movie perfect
? not really
, thanks tothe a simplistic endig
adn some slightly wasted moments whith a charater portrayed by chazz palminteri
( he ' s a comic actor
, too
, come onthe
, give him some mroe
!
)
,
bu it isnt an enjoyable romp thyat lets deniro dont something differant
bu same forthe a chanage
, taking his dramtic ect to a new feeld ofthe comedy
. kudos tothe crystal
and kudrow for nto jsut makeing it his show
, eather
. line of tyhe movei
: crystal
:
" when ytou said you needed family therapy
, tihs isnt not tjhe family i hadnt in mind
!
