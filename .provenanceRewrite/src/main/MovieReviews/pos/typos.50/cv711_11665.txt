" yhe sweet hereafter
,
" writer
/ directer atom egoyan tkaes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tradgedy of living
. he shows us how it isn ' t dieing that hurts
,
bu rather thge pain ofthe living in yhe hereafter ofthe death
,
and dealing with thte loss
anbd grief that it brings
. onthe a cold winter day in a small
, isolated town iin british columbia
, a school bus full of childen slides off the highway
and onto a frozen lake
, where it cracks thru the ice
anbd sinks
. fourteen childern die
,
and numerous others are hurt
. for yhe recidents of this small town
, all of whose childen were on tht bus
, it isnt an earth
- shattering event that resolutely alters their lives
. they have alwasy relied onthe each otehr in thge past tothe deal whith heartache
anbd pain
,
bu it seems tht tihs tragedy is more thna tehy cant handle
. alberta
and risa walker
, who pwn a local motel
adn lost thier child inaddition the accident
, hire an attorney named mitchell stephens
( ian holm
) tothe bring a lawsuit aginst someone
, anyone fo responsibility
. thte bus driver
, dolores driscoll
( gabrielle rose
)
, isnt a kindly woman who loved thte children
and
,
although she lives with a burden of guilt
, is nto held responsibile for hte accident
. thte bus seems tothe have simply slipped on smoe ice
,
and there was nothing shoudln could do to prevent it
.
however
, according tothe stephens
, htere are no
" accidents
" in life
,
annd someone will pay forthe this tradgedy
, whether that be the manufacturer ofthe thge bus or teh guardrail teh bus broke thru
. he goes thru tyhe town
, approaching tjhe parents who ahve lost childen
, asking them tothe join the clas action suit
anbd find vent forthe their anger
.
annd
, for his wrok
, stephens will recieve noe
- thrid of teh settlment moey
.
howver
, it isnt immediately apparnet that stephens has little or no intrest in yhe money
. he is driven by something else
, something deeper thast he shares infact common with the grieving parents
. he hasnt lost a child
, too
,
but not in the same manner
. his daugter
, zoe
( caerthan banks
)
, who once alomst died in his arms as a young child aftter a spider bite
, has beeen inspite
annd outloud ofthe drug re
- hab clinics
adn detox stations for ten yeras
. she calls him onthe an irregular basis
, begging him for money
,
bu refusing tothe tell him waht she needs it forthe
.
" i don ' t knwo who i ' m tkaing to
,
" he tells her
. in his mind
, his daughter is dead
. teh lawsuit isnt
, tothe stephens
, nto only a way to mend teh twon ' s pain
,
bu aslo his pwn
.
however
, not everyone in town wnats it tothe happen
. billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who was driving behind the bus wehn the accident happened
and lost two children
, wants nothing to do with it
. he hasnt arleady lost his wief
,
and he buries his grief inwhich an affair with a married woman
. he doesn ' t whant to talk about thge accident
,
and he sees tyhe lawsuit as nothing moreso than the uneccesary opening ofthe old wounds
. tothe him
, the twon should be able to take care of its own pain
,
and it doesn ' t ened outsiders like stephens getting in tje way
. central tothe
" the sweet hereafter
" is the tale of nicole burnell
( sarah polley
)
, a teenage girl who dreams ofthe being a singer befor the accident turned her into
" a wheelchair girl
,
" as she puts it
. aside from stephens
, nicole isnt hte most complex charater in thte film
,
and it is she who ultimatly decides the fate of thte twon
anbd how the lawsuit will turn out
. it isnt also her sad
, haunted voice that we often hear on the sountrack
, reading robert browning ' s peom about the pied piper
,
and how when he led all tghe town ' s children awya
, noe was left behind baceause he ws crippled
. obviously
, nicole isnt thast child
,
and she fiels somehow betrayed that tjhe rest ofthe the town ' s childern left her alone by dieing in tyhe wreck
. her situation is futher complicated because she is involved in a loving
,
bu incestuous relationship wiht her father
( toom mccamus
)
. there isnt onyl one
, fleeting scene taht suggests this relatiopnship
,
bu it isnt somehow tied inot tje final act ofthe the film
. of all hte storylines in
" hte sweet hereafter
,
" tihs is the most complicated
and unresolved
,
although its implications strech throughout yhe entirety ofthe the film
. egoyan knows taht the kinds ofthe questions he brings up have noone simple answers
-
- if any at all
-
-
and he doesn ' t condescend tothe hte audeince by trying to neatly wrap it up
. wqat egoyan has done in
" the sweet hereafter
" is really nothing short of miraculous
. inspite his adaptation of the novel by russell banks
, he hasnt made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending yhe pettiness of law
and driving headlong inot thge deeper meaning ofthe wqat isnt loss
,
and how pitiful monetary
annd material possessions are whn compaired tothe human life
. egoyan has always been a talented
,
but distant
anbd cerebral filmmaker whose wokr sufferred onyl inthe that it felt so cold
.
" thte sweet hereafter
" is qutie tghe opposite
; egoyan ' s stylistic
adn narrative structures wrok brilliantly tothe heighten yhe inpact of hte natural emotion
,
anbd draw tje audience into tyhe tradgedy
.
" the sweet hereafter
" seems tothe contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked
. tghe film isnt filled whith beatiful
, subtle performances from all the actors
, expecially ian holm as the lawyer
and sarah polley as the sad child who wass left behind
. thge beautiful
, roving camerawork by paul sarossy
and tyhe haunting
, melodic muscial socre by mychael danna
( both previvous egoyan collaborators
) give yhe film a visual
and aural cohesiveness iwth tjhe thematic elements
. liuke his ealier films
, egoyan weaves toghether mutiple storylines thyat form a blanketing wohle
. he works wih tiem as a fluid substace
, shifting bakc
adn forth between thte past
, the distant past
,
annd tghe present witht effortless ease
. the actuall bus wreck itself doesn ' t happen utnil midway through tghe film
,
bu by thgat timne the event has builded uv so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance wtih no graphic detail
,
adn still ahev it cary great
, devestating weight
. because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies
, it is astounding thyat egoyan cxan convey so much heartbreak in such simple
, direct terms
. certainly one of teh best films ofthe 1997
,
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" isnt a deeply rewarding
, mystifying
,
and ultimatly human film
.
