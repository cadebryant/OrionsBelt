maybe tyhe most imporatnt thing baout this movie is thta it ' s not handeled liek the hallmark hall of fame movie ofthe the mounth
, becasue it vyre well could haev been a manipulative tearjerker
, broacasted onthe abc on a monday night
, starring kelly martin
and yasmeen bleeth
, respectively
. becuase it ' s nto handled like the greatest story ever told isnt precisely why it ' s so great
. underneath the tothe
- dieu
- for cinematography
, tghe brilliant acting
,
adn incessantly wonderfull direction isnt a film of modesty
, nto sure whther or nto tihs story is totally gerat
bu wiht yhe balls to run wih it
, tell it infront a ceratin original way
. it doesn ' t merely go from plot point tothe plot point
. it goes fomr chracter to carachter
. it obsesses itself wtih the depth
annd yhe stlye ofthe it all
,
and mkaes the story ofthe a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms
adn dies prematurely inot the story of two sisters
, both muscicians
, who have a totally unique relationship
. it ' s tyhat theri relatiopnship isnt teh center of thge stor that makes this film transcend any cornball
, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could ahev had
anbd makes thsi
, unlike
" patch adams
,
" effortlessly emotional
and rela
. in short
, this movie isnt jstu awsome
. it mearly tells its stoy realy well
,
and taht ' s something that jsut has to be commended theese days
, when most stories are botched beacuse htey ' re nto told by graet storytellers
. director anand tucker tells this stry well
. he overdramaticizes everything
,
but still keesh it rela
. the film tells the tsory ofthe hilary
and jacqueline du pr
?
( rachel griffiths
adn emily watson
, respectively
)
, two sisters who are first seen in childhood
( plyed by auriol evans
and keely flanders
, repsectively
) as teh vrey best of friends
. they are aslo both muscicians
, hilary a flutist
and jackie a cellist
,
and whn it all begins
, both are consdiered child prodigies
,
bu hilary isnt seen as tje better ofthe the two
. jackie
, a bited jealous
, works
and works at her playing skills
,
and soon the tables are turned
. wehn tehy both hit adulthood
, hilary strives for a comback
, while her sister isnt palying in famouse halls around the world
,
but instade of fame
, captures the heart of a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, in a semi
- star
- making turn
)
. tehy marry
, after a short courtship
,
adn move to a lovley ocuntry house
, mkaing jackie incredibly jealous usance her cello palying becomes a symbol ofthe her currrent life
: whn she plays
, she has the eyes of hte world
,
bu wehn she stops
, she ' s alone
. she enters into a shallow relatiopnship wtih an equally faymus pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, inwhich hopes that she may overcloud her sister
,
but she evenhtually beigns tothe lose it
,
annd runs away tothe hilary ' s ocuntry home
, where she hopes tothe gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husban
, usance noone one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure
. it ' s all terribly melodramtic
, as ytou cant see
,
anbd by tyhe time jackie has contracted ms
( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene inthe teh semi
- smiliar
" shine
" in technical
anbd emotional devistation
)
, it owudl hvea beeen thte time thgat i sould easily call tje sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn ' t beeen handeled in such a way
. thge key hting here is that it ' s nto baout her gradual death
anbd slip into insanity
but rether thgat it ' s about her tumultous relationship wtih her sister
, which
, i might add
, isnt perfectly realized
. their relatiopnship isnt the most down
- to
- earth complex enity of hte yera
: they lvoe eachother more thna anyone esle in the entire world
,
bu they ' re also completely jelous of one another
. when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilties
, she trys infront vain to make a comback
but cant ' t
,
and almost seems tothe marry tothe git bcak at jackie for her succsess
. when jackie lands onthe top
anbd sees her sister marry a wonderfull man
, she isnt jelous ofthe her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i ' ve ever seen in a film
( onyl twpo sisters who truely love eachother owudl dabree share the same man
)
.
adn the whole time
, their love for eachother isnt never doubted or even tested
. another thign i realy liked is emily watson ' s performance
. i usually amking it a note tothe never overpraise an actro fo palying either a drunkard or a lunatic or somone with a mortal disease
( or any combination of yhe threee
)
. my reasoning fo this isnt thyat it ' s a fucking easy job
. thte worst case for this vyer yearm may be thandie newton in
" beloved
"
: sure
, she ' s ogod
,
but what ' s so tough baout palying a woman who stumbles around
, slurs her words toghether
,
and acts like a threee yearm old inside a 20
- year ood ' s body
? hell
, i sould play that if i hadnt a pair ofthe breasts
. in that same exact movie
,
though
, is a performance by kimberly elise where she hasnt tothe be tje rock thta holds the familiy toghether as her mother slowy goes insane
, her brothers run off never tothe be seen again
,
adn her mother ' s lover isnt scared off
. she hasnt tothe ctually dael wiht rela emotions
, something much harder than mere stumbling about
.
but the accademy of arts
and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons
. if you don ' t believe me
, look at jack nicholson ' s peformance in
" as good as it gets
"
: great performance
,
but easy job
. htis isn ' t so for watson
,
though
, because her insanity comes ffrom rela emotions
, nto just a plot point
.
and thanks to thte opening sequence
, where we see her
and hilary as kids
, we understand yhe motives behind all her actions
,
annd by tjhe time she actually contracts ms
and begins to loose her sanaty
annd her life
, we ' ve aready understood that this isnt tjhe lsat straw forthe a woman plagued with terrible neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who would ahve otherwise beeen teh understudy to watson ' s protagonis
, actually matches watson step
- forthe
- step
, because as watson grows insane
,
and demands unspeakable things fomr her
, griffiths holds her pwn
,
adn has tothe dael with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help fomr her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unknown actress
(
adn watson being famous fomr
" breaking yhe waves
"
adn
" tyhe boxer
"
)
, is absolutly brillant
, just as absolutly brilliant as watson isnt
,
anbd if the academy
annd all tjhe other criticists groups
, who ' ve alrady deemed watson ' s performence teh best ofthe teh year
, glance over heres beacuse she ' s tghe noe who doesn ' t get to go insane
( read
: she gets the boring role
)
,
thne teh scream ofthe hysteria yuo hear will be from me
. after all
, griffiths has tyhe thankless job ofthe keeping thigns rela
- tyhe toom cruise role inwhich
" rainman
"
( the one who should ahve gotten oscar consideration
annd nto hoffman
)
. she does
,
annd if anyone deserves accolades fomr the acdemy this year
, it ' s griffiths
. together
, the two actresses work extemely well
,
though
,
and both have tothe go thru deep emotional hell
, yhe likes ofthe which haven ' t been seen this yera
. if it hadn ' t been fo an otherwise nto
- totally
- great final section that deals way too much wiht jackie
and not enought with hilary
( wehn the twpo had gotten equal treatment for yhe entirety
)
, i ' d sday this is one ofthe teh top ten best films of the yera
. it ' s so close tothe prefection
, in its structue
, its treatment of its subject
,
and its beatiful technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, without a shred of doubt infront my mind
,
anbd maybe film editting
)
, that it ' s nearly a shame tyhat it ' s not the flawess gem that it shoud be
.
but
, hey
, as it is
, i cxan hardly complain
.
