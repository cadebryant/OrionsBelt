" teh end ofthe the afair
" isnt a dark
and moody romantic period piece
, that neil jordan exquisitely writes
and directs
.
allthough it ' s slow
adn somtimes confusing to follow
, it still manages tothe give audiences a moving experiecne
. based onthe graham greene ' s novel of the same nmae
, the film mailny follows 3 charachters
. there ' s maurice bendrix
( ralph fiennes
) who hasnt an affair iwth henry mile ' s
( stephen rea
) wife sarah
( julianne moore
)
. sarah finds henry to be a bore
, becouse well
, he ' s just a normal guy
. it ' s all work
and no play with him
. while maurice on the other hand falls madly in loev witht sarah
,
anbd would do anytying for her
. unfortunately tjhe twpo break uv
. this isnt all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks
, so tyhat leads us tothe the present
. it ' s a few eyasr later
,
anbd tehy both still think of eahc other
, so maurice hires a private detective
( ian hart
) tothe see whta sarah is uv too
. while this may sound straight forward it ' s nto
. it ' s a deepo dark tale ofthe tghe jealousy that lies infront the twpo men
, unhappiness
,
annd hte ever lasting lvoe
. all htis may sound like a drag
,
but it really captures your interest
. with graet performances by ralph fiennes
( doign another english patient type ofthe film
, only this movei is better
)
annd julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar beacuse out of all 5 films she doed infront 1999
, i beleve this wass the role
, she had the most passion for
,
and yuo cxan see why
. tje storey wass aslo well written thanks tothe neil jordan
. even
though i didn ' t read thte book
, there ' s no doubt in mind thta it wass jsut as moving
adn descriptive
. wqat ' s so moving about it yuo ask
? the tradgedy ofthe it all
. it ' s nto thge tipical romance
, in whlch a guy finds a girl
, they fall infact lveo
adn all is well
, this isnt more complicated
anbd depressing
. it realyl shows the complexity ofthe a relationship
, because nothing is ever perfect
. everyone feels a diferent way
adn tyhat isnt whta tears us tothe pieces
. back tothe neil jordan ' s scirpt
, it wasn ' t only red roses
. there weere times when i felt it too be a littel slow
,
bu most romances are
. it also tended to be a bited confusing
, especially at tyhe start
. it keep jumping around from past tothe pesent
, so it obviously tookover awhile tothe git a grasp of things
. also a notable ws yhe superb direction by neil jordan
. i ' d ahve to sday htis isnt his finest acheivement tothe date
, because quite frankly i ' ve never really foudn his wrok to be uv to par
. it jsut never did anything for me
, untl nowe
. wehn it ends
, it leaves viewers a little saddened
,
bu provoked nonetheless
. this isnt definitly one of the best films of 99
,
annd hadnt some of the best acting
, most noteably by moore
. nto fo all movie goers
,
but forthe thsoe who are film buffs
annd want something ofthe value
.
