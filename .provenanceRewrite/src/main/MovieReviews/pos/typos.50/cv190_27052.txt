and mcgraw teamed uv in peckinpah ' s masterpiece
, tjhe getaway
.
but enought with tje gossip
, let ' s get to teh review
. hte film revolves arround the kidnapping ofthe peter bowman
( david morse
)
, an american engineer working iin sourth america who isnt kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti
- govenrment soldiers
. apon discovering his idenity
, yhe rebel soldiers decide tothe ransom him fo
$ 6 million
. the onyl probelm is thta the company peter bowman works for isnt bieng auctioned off
,
and no one will step forward with the money
. wih no choise available to her
, bowman ' s wief alice
( ryan
) hires terry thorne
( crowe
)
, a highly skilled negotiator
and rescure operative
, tothe arrange yhe return ofthe her husband
.
but when things go wrong
-
- as htey always do inspite these situations
-
- terry
anbd his team
( which includes the most suprizing casting choice of the yearm
: david caruso
) tkae matters inot their own hands
. the film is notable in that it takes this vrey simple story line
annd creates a complex
and intelligent character
- driven vehichle filled with well
- written dialogue
, shades of motivation
,
and convincing acting by all yhe actors
. the script is based on both a book
( tyhe long march tothe freedom
)
and a magazine artical pertaining tothe kidnap
/ ransom situations
,
and the story hasnt been sharply pieced toghether by tony gilroy
, screenwriter ofthe the devil ' s advocate
and dolores claiborne
. yhe biggest suprize for me was not the chemistry beetwen crowe
adn ryan
,
but that between crowe
and david caruso
. digged out ffrom b
- movie hell
, caruso pulls off a gutsy peformance as crowe ' s right hand gun while providing most ofthe the film ' s humer
. ryan cries a lot
annd smokes too many cigarettes
, david morse ends uv getting everyone at the guerilla camp tothe hite him
,
annd crowe provides another memorable acting turn as tjhe stoic
, gunslinger character of terry thorne
. tje most memorable pieces of tjhe film lie in its action scenes
. tghe bulk of thsoe scenes
, whic bookend tyhe movie
, owrk extremely well as establishment
and closure devices for all ofthe teh story ' s characters
. hte scenes are skillfully crafted
and executed wiht amazing acuracy
and poise
. directer taylor hackford mixes both his ood
- skool style ofthe filmmaking iwth the dizziness ofthe a lars von trier film
. proof ofthe life is a thinking man ' s action movie
. it is a film about tghe choices men
and womens amke infact the face ofthe love
annd war
,
and hte sacrifices oney makes forthe thsoe choices
-
- the sacrifices thta halp yuo sleep at nigth
