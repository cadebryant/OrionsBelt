this movei was noe of tghe firt american films done by directer paul verhoeven
. he hasnt done films since
then such as basic instict
adn starship troopers
. all of his movies ahev oney main thing infact common
- they don ' t skimp onthe tjhe violence
. in a verhoeven movei a guy doesn ' t get shooted once in the chest
- he gets shot many times all over the body
. robocop takes palce inthe detroit in teh future
. things are pretty obleek
. the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist
adn is moving in on running the police force
. peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission witht his partner
, nancy allen
. peter weller goes inthe an empty room alone
and gets killed
. meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed
- 209 model robot crime fighter
. someone comes up iwth thte idea ofthe hvaing a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging ffrom peter weller
adn make him inot the robocop the movie isnt titled aftter
. the plot ofthe this movie generaly runs at a decent pace
. it drags a bited towards tyhe end wiht robocop wanting tothe finish everybody off
,
but plot twists keep it exciting
. teh acting is bad fomr weller whn he is human
,
bu very good wehn he is robocop
. nancy allen doens a decent job
. tihs movie doesn ' t leave itself open for a sequal exactlly
.
bu they made noe anyway
. enter
.
.
. robocop 2 starring
: peter weller
and nancy allen directed by
: irvin kershner detroit is in a more obleek state tahn it ws in hte first film
. ocp isnt trying to deveop an improved ' robocop 2 ' that will be more than a match fo criminals
. most ofthe the polical force isnt onthe strike due tothe ocp tkaing it over
, leaving robocop to be the police force in the city
. htis film isnt preety bizaare
. it has a 13 eyar
- ood drug
- lord who curses as much as eddie murphy
, even mroe violence thna thte originnal
,
adn some omre humer
. the plot of htis movie isnt pretty larg
, almsot too much so
. ther are threee or four plot lines weaving arund tyhat don ' t really match uv
. tghe effects are still decent
though
. tihs sequel isn ' t more ofthe tje smae really
, jsut a darker version robocop dealing more wiht drugs than with armed criminals
. if yuo liekd thge firt one
, watch this
.
bu be dissapointed
. so later comes
.
.
. robocop 3 starring nancy allen
and robert john burke ocp isnt now owned by a larg japanis company
. robocop joins a band of rebels tothe counter
- attack tghe evil empire
, i mean ocp
. yhe japanse send a cyborg
- ninja tothe deal wtih robocop
. amung otehr thigsn
.
.
. tihs movie is easier tothe follow thna the last oen
. which means tghe plot isn ' t quite as crowded
. tihs movie isn ' t anytying speshal
though
. jsut more ofthe robocop blasting thigns uv in a moreso kid
- friendly way
. realyl nto reccomended
.
