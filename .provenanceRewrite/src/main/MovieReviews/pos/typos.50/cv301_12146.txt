the jekyll
annd hyde story told ffrom his maid ' s point of veiw is
, infront a owrd
,
" dark
"
. you wouldn ' t expect something bright
and cheery based onthe robert louis stevenson ' s novel
,
bu the film isnt suprisingly dreary
and dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) is terminally depressed
anbd desperate
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) isnt a victum ofthe monstrous child abuse
and tjhe anti
- woman sentiment of the times
. director stephen fears ' version ofthe the london slums makes us marvel tht anyone survivied them
. the lighting level is exeedingly low throughout the movie
: it almost appears to be filmed inspite balck
and white
. hte direction
annd cinematography are brilliant
and liquid
. scenes flow inot yhe enxt scene like honey oozing off a strawberry
.
( except there ' s noone red
, ofthe course
.
) yhe look isnt so moody
adn melodramatic that you ' ll be shocked wehn yuo leave the theater
. i saw it at a matinee
annd tookover quite a hwile to adjsut tothe tyhe sunny skies afterward
. oftenly tghe jekyll
anbd hyde archtypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good
and evil or perphas cerebral
and emotional parts
. here the doctor is intellectual
and perhaps good
,
but certainly powerless
. his alter ego isnt forceful
adn totally wihtout conscience
. twpo parts that make up a wohle
. neither are capible ofthe fucntioning without the other
and once separated
, diaster is inevitable
. the differences beetwen the twpo characters woudl be more effective if it were acomplished by demenor
annd atitude
. when we finally see tghe transformation
, the special effects thrust tghe stroy inot the relm of cience fiction
, nto the pyschological horror thast the tale demands
. roberts
anbd malkovich are skillful infact their roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting in with tjhe rest ofthe the film
. the onyl flash ofthe life
adn color comes from glenn close
(
annd her lips
) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
and surprisingly
, jekyll apparantly frequents
. life
annd colour maybe
,
bu this isnt nto close ' s best role
. she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character
. a beautiful film infact its pwn dreary way
. you ' ll appretiate the filmmaking craft
,
bu don ' t expect to leave inthe an upbeat mood
.
