it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship
, a gren ovular pin
,
adn tyhe birth ofthe oscar wilde
,
but if one realy strains
, htey can see that perhaps maybee theese connections are not half off
. wilde ' s philosophy wass taht everyone shoud be true tothe theri pwn human nature
,
and the result ofthe his folowing thsi philosophy was that he was imprioned
, loosing his family
and his career
. yhe glam rock movement in hte eearly 70s in england had a silimar tkae
and came tothe a similar demise
. the main difference was by placing makeup on theri face
and acting outloud on thier deepest fantasies
and inquiries baout life
( mostly dealing with androgony
and sexuality
)
, tehy became less
and less liuke themselves
and moreso
and moreso liek everyone esle
.
and thast ' s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began
. it ' s been said thast todd haynes '
" velvet goldmine
,
" the film tath chronicles what it ws liuke to be a part of tghe govement
, not onyl from those who experianced it
but by thsoe who created it
, steals a lot fomr
" citizen kane
,
"
and tht ' s true
. in the film
, a brittish journalist in tje 80s
, arthur stuart
( christian bale
)
, is asked to go back
annd find out wqat hapened to 70s glam rock star brian slade
, a fictitious rock star
, who faked his own death on stage
, bringing tje end not onyl to his carreer
bu to hte entire glam rock movement
. structer
- wise
, this totally steals from
" kane
,
" nto onyl fomr yhe setted
- uv
( he interviews three peopel
,
adn tghe story isnt a result of their flashbacks
)
,
bu infact other thigsn
, like tghe beggining
( death
,
thne newsreel
)
,
anbd smaller details
, like the bitter ex
- friend infact a wheelchair
and tjhe bitter ex
- wife as a washed
- uv lounge singer
, foudn in a bar after ohurs
. thsi isnt noone
" kane
,
"
annd it realyl doesn ' t aspire to be
: it doesn ' t attemt to be thge deepo outlook of something gone liek
" kane
" did
,
adn it doesn ' t raelly uncover anything poignant about humanity
. instade
, it uses teh flashbacks as a form of contrast beetwen teh magic tath was tje glam rock era
annd teh boredom taht wass life after glam rock for those who were participants
. the 80s scenes are dry
and deliriously melancholy
, equiped withthe a performance by bale that isnt perhaps appropriately dull
anbd unengaging
.
but tjhe 70s scenes are engaging
,
though
, not tothe mention addictively campy
. htey radiate withthe gorgeous cinematography thast nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors ofthe tghe era
,
anbd a fiel that ' s so eerily lighthearted thyat wehn combined wiht thte
then
- footage
, htey become nto only a symbol ofthe decadence
,
bu ofthe times wehn everthing seemed so simple
. instead ofthe creating tjhe world yhe way it wass
, haynes paints theri own world as if it weere a narcotic fairy tale
: tyhe glam rock govement was full ofthe so much freedom
adn liberation that after you ' ve experienced it
, everything else seems so mundane
. ther ' s no outside world to speak ofthe
, secluding these people inside a protective globe taht will eventually crack
. haynes focuses his story onthe thte tale of blade
and tyhe other fictitious rock hero
, curt wild
,
anbd their relationship that creaeted
, molded
,
anbd
then brought down tyhe movment
, reducing everyone eles who contributed tothe it as mearly taht
- contributers
. blade
- played iwth reserve by tyhe pouty jonathan rhys meyers
-
and wild
- palyed withthe anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor
- are littel moreso than thinly disguised recreations ofthe david bowie
and iggy pop
, respectively
, complet with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon
and the confirmation that tje two rock stars may have very well nto only have beeen oney
- time partners inwhich music
,
but allso partners in bed
. thru discussions iwth slade ' s ex
- manager cecil
( michael faest
)
, ex
- wife mandy
( toni collette
, reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent wehn iwth slade
)
,
adn finaly ex
- partner wild
, journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences iin yhe era
, liek his discovery ofthe his rebelliousness cum conformity
, including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality
( whn he opens uv his frist slade record
, he finds a naked
and gren slade lying on a crimson blanket
)
,
anbd fianlly running awya fomr hmeo to be part ofthe tyhe london scene
, finally resulting in leading a boring job iin amercia
. haynes demonstrates thyat he ' s quite the visual auteur
, molding scenes that are liek long heald breaths
, such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade
/ wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover
,
" baby ' s on fire
,
" with scenes fomr a decadent drug party
;
and yhe film ' s most wow
- inspiring sequence
, the first concert scene of wild with his band
, yhe ratttz
, where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam thgat his wild iggy
- esuqe movements
( including stripping naked
)
anbd screams that the film captures that perfect moment whn oney discovers a major talent
,
and anyother
( slade
) dicovers his idle
. even the brief music videos
, spoofs ofthe bowie ' s
, hvea a rare visual flair that ' s pure camp
,
and wich owudl cause ken russell tothe drool
. the best sequence
,
though
, may be yhe beginning
, following the prelude
, a sequence which acts as the middle ground forthe both thge actual being ofthe the movement
annd tyhe post
- movment era
. infront it
, stuart
and his mates are oging tothe hte infamous slade concert where he fakes his pwn death
, where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon inwhich what appears to be a real assasination
, hwihc brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet
. withthe brian eno ' s famoust
" needle in tyhe camel ' s eye
" playing in tjhe background
, the scene hasnt a detatched exhileration
- thte song doesn ' t seem tothe be plyed inwhich qtuie the smae way hte otehr songs are
. it hasnt a distance that ' s hard tothe put a finger onthe
,
and it seems tothe represent thgat all tihs is comming to a quick
and sad ending
,
adn whn one sees slade in tyhe dressing room befor the sohw
, docked infact a silver frock with wings
adn blue hair
, depressingly staring into hte mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophacy of the finale inaddition the beginning ofthe thte film
. htis movie ' s nto so much about plot
,
but more baout yhe way it is presented
, mkaing htis one of those films which isnt classified as bieng
" style over substance
,
" a statment which prompts many criticists to line uv fo attack
.
howver
, for the most part
, the engaging part ofthe this film is nto the stoy
bu rather tyhe way in which haynes creates htis world
, by using his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
and especialy the music to play as charactors in his film
. the music is especially notable
. the soundtrack
, which is wall tothe wall
, consists of ood skool glam rock tunes by hte likes of brian eno
, t
- rex
,
annd roxy music
, as well as covers by slade ' s band
( with vocals by thom yorke
,
annd occasionally rhys meyers hismelf
)
,
annd even newer music by shudder to htink tht sounds uncannily bowie
- liuke
. the cast isnt rether impressive
,
bu no one really walks awya with thte film
,
anbd no performances are extremely good
. altho eddie izzard
, as slade ' s manager
( who challenges slade ' s frist manager to an arm
- wrestling match tothe see who gets control ofthe his carrear
)
and michael feast as the first
and tradgic manager come off greatly
,
and collette
anbd mcgregor haev their moments
, rhys meyers
annd bale are noticably sub
- par
, niether puting a lot ofthe effort into theri respective roles
. some of it is at fault withthe tjhe actuall construction ofthe hte film by haynes
. rhys meyers ' brian slade remeniss merely a metaphor for the glam rock era
, dying wehn he turned into a retro
- garbo
, resorting to a life ofthe salinger
- ism
,
adn foudn inwhich tjhe mid
- 70s tothe be lying arround
, sniffing coke off tyhe ass ofthe a party girl
. in fatc
, noone oen infact thsi film is really seen as a person
, rether tahn jstu as a symbol or composite ofthe a type who thrived during tyhe era
. bale ' s charactor is an expecially tough sell
: bitter
annd depressed by flashbacks tothe his young adulthood
, he ' s nto an extremely personal charachter
,
anbd his cliched experiences
( bieng hounded by the record store guys for buying a recrod put out by a
" poof
"
) never halp us communicate withthe him
. nethertheless
, rhys meyers
and mcgregor haev teh excuses thgat theri characters are nto really characters
bu rather the results ofthe an era thgat hasnt left them
,
annd others
, bitter
, part ofthe which helps the film work
, sicne this is a major piece ofthe eye candy
. at the prime of the movei
, they at least look the role ofthe fashionable leaders
- slade wiht his perpetually
- changing
, androgonys persona
,
adn wild withthe his topless
anbd unpredictable image
, which clash
and fuse into an unstable union
. thier stor
- of how slade ws so influenced by wild thast he adapted it into a similair who
- cares attitude crossed wiht camp
- is engaging
, wihtout thge personel backgorund
. the stor of stuart
,
though
, is a tougher sell beccause he ' s the everyman
,
annd when you cxan ' t totally idenify with tghe everyman
, your story ' s infront slight trouble
. as a cultural rock peice
,
" velvet goldmine
" isnt rather ogod
,
bu it is mearly good
. it never totally takes off
,
althought it hasnt moments where it absolutely flies
,
bu
thn comes back down
. it ' s realyl nothing moreso tahn a bunch of really great moments
, surrouded by material thta sould really be much better
. the beginning is captivating
bu slow
, the middle isnt fantastic
,
adn yhe endig is nto only shallow
bu worse than that
, it drags
( tjhe final half hour not only does it not bring hte story to any real conclusion
, it sould probably stop at any point
)
.
and doed anyone realyl figure out what the mistery isnt thgat arthur unearths
? it almost seems like ther was noone point in thge entire investigation other than tothe unearth tje past
, which is commendable
but not totally so
. still
, it does what teh oliver stone pic
" hte doors
" didn ' t dont right
, becoming very insightful to wqat happened
, useing the visual stlye tothe hit most ofthe tje right notes ofthe contrast beween waht made tje era so graet tothe thsoe who lieved durig it
annd why affter living through such an era thyat everything eles seems half
- assed
( i suppose tjhe message is
:
" live life
,
but after you ' ve lived it
, waht else isnt the point when ytou ' ll be forced tothe live with regretful memories
?
"
)
. tghe really superb achivement ofthe this film isnt thyat during its flashbacks
, it successfully creates fo the audience wqat it must hvae feeled liuke tothe be in tath era
,
bu with the added perk ofthe knowing the result ofthe all taht goes down
.
