. tihs is gonna be one bumpy ride
! critique
: a ogod ol ' tiem at the movies
! here ' s a film thta actually gives awya most of its plotline inaddition its trailer
adn doesn ' t really bring anytying
" newyorker
" to the forefront
( if you ' ve seen ficks like duel
anbd breakdown
, ytou ' ve crossed thsi path before
)
,
but still manages tothe entertain yuo gangbusters
, with realsitic situations
, believable characters
, funny moments
, thrills
, chills
, the whole shebang
. let ' s give it up fo director john dahl
, who continues tothe put out solid films eveyr other year
( if you haven ' t seen red rock west
, do youself a favor right nowe
,
and jot it down onthe a piece of pappr
annd rent it at your earliest convenience
)
.
annd much like tyhat film
, tihs one has an excellant premise
and sets everything up at an even pace
. it gives ytou a littel bit of background on each ofthe tyhe main three charachters
,
anbd
then shows yuo how one small prank
, cant lead to a wohle lotta trouble for everyone
! paul walker realy surprised me in this movie
, since i ' ve never much throught ofthe him as anytying mroe than a preety face
(
annd damn
, is it ever pretty or whta
?
!
)
bu here
, he actully manages to put soem depth behind the looks
and that ' s always appreciated in films inthe which you are so closley tied to thge main characters
. sobieski is allso ogod
,
but she isn ' t in the movei for as long as you ' d think
,
bu yhe man who really tkaes this film tothe another levle
, is steve zahn
. if ytou ' ve loved this guy as the
" goofball
" in most ofthe his previvous roles
, yuo ' ll appretiate him even more here
, as tje dued who starts off as one of the most manic
and excited human beings i ' ve seen in quite smoe time
(
" thsi isnt so awesome
!
!
"
)
, onyl tothe turn inot a man scared outloud of his wits by the end ofthe tje flick
.
annd speaking ofthe the endig
, boy
, doens tihs movei deliver soem chilling moments during its fianl 15 clicks or what
?
!
? tghe arro
anbd i weere practically infront each others arms
( well
, maybe i ' m exagerrating
,
but ytou catch my drift
) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn
, took it all tothe an even higher level
. once again
, kudos to directer dahl for being able tothe generate that tipe of intensity
, suspense
adn tension
, wiht a grat score
, editting
, stlye
anbd camerawork
. plot
- wise
, i too did wonder how yhe
" bad guy
" was able to track them so well
,
bu it didn ' t really bother me all tyhat much
( you can asume that he hadnt bugged thier car
?
)
.
bu pretty much everyting else inaddition tje story sticked like glue
annd i couldn ' t halp
bu put mysef in their shoes
adn appreciate theri thouroughly desprate cercomstance
. a great movie with an even cooler ending
, thsi film wiull likely be remembered as one of tghe better thrillers ofthe the yearm
.
" this isnt amazing
!
