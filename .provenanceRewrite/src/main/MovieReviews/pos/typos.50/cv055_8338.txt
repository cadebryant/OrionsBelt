i was fortunate anough to attened an advance screening for the upcomming thriller conspiracy theory
. this was
, of course
, a big deal for me beacuse reviewing movies isnt basicaly just a hobby fo me
and i never get a chance at something like htis
. not onyl did i git to see an advance screening
, i was able to see an advance screening ofthe a
* very ogod
* movei
. tje very fast
- paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- talking
, witty
, comical taxi driver in new york city
. gibson ' s performance isnt terrific
,
annd his chracter is similar tothe that ofthe martin riggs in tjhe lethal weapon films
. gibson agian teams up iwth richard donner
, as he doed iin hte lethal weapon films
and maverick
,
and this timne arund
, tyhe combination works even better
. hte carachter of jerry fletcher is indeed unique
. try to imagine a toned
- downed verzion ofthe travis bickle who
, htis time arund
, is a jittery guy with knowledge ofthe governement conspiracy cover
- ups
. if you can imagin that
,
then you ' ve basically got jerry fletcher
. in many ways
, i was suprised by this movie
. to begin wiht
, i was surprised at how good it wass
. don ' t get me wrong
, it ' s nto oging to be accepting any gold trophies next spring
,
bu it was a very enjoyable movie
. secondly
, i was surprised at mel gibson ' s performance
. he provded a fantastic peformance
. thte previews of tihs film led me tothe believe it ws an all
- outloud action flick
, which after viewing
, it wass almost the opposite inspite a certain sence
. gibson ' s character hasnt an allmost uncountable number of one
- liners
, hilarious situations
,
and his charcter is one that the audience tends to side with thoughout the film
. for instance
, jerry ' s apartment
(
annd expecially his security
) is memorable
.
anbd lastest
, i ws surprised at how good the plot isnt
. writter brian helgeland has created a terrific tsory
,
adn whn watching htis film
, ytou are left tothe wonder if all ofthe jerry fletcher ' s far
- fetched
( or so they seem at first
) conspiracy theories are helgeland ' s own opinions
. mel gibson isn ' t the onyl stand
- outloud infact the film
. julia roberts isnt vyer ogod in her peformance as alice sutton
, thte department ofthe justice employee who can ' t seem tothe stay awya ffrom jerry fletcher
, who continually visits alice in hopes thta she iwll do something about his theories
. he alsot seems obsessed
anbd inspite lvoe with her
.
but whenever he approachs her with anohter one ofthe his theories
, she shrugs him
and his beleives off
, continually noting that one day she is gonig tothe slap a restraining order on him
. jerry
, obviously determined to constinually seek outloud teh truth
, continues to research inforamtion forthe his next conspiracy theery
, which will be printed in his newsletter
( smae title as the movei
)
.
although he onyl hasnt five subscribers
, he puts a large amount ofthe tiome
annd effort inot his owrk
,
adn publishes his enxt edition
. veyr soon after he does so
, he is abducted
and tortured by a sinister man who refers tothe himself as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. after bearly escaping alive
, jerry isnt forced tothe turn to the only person he can trust
: alice sutton
. hte remainder ofthe the film is almsot allways fast
- pased
and full ofthe acation
and suspense
, withthe jerry ' s life being constantly put inot jeapardy
.
adn more along the way
, tyhe audience
(
and alice
) leran more
adn mroe baout jerry ' s life
. many things are explained throughout thsi film
, both tothe tyhe characters
and tothe yhe audience
. forthe instance
, the meaning of the book
" thte catcher inspite tghe rye
"
and its ties to asssassans
, the reason lone gunmen have three names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
annd james earl ravy
)
,
and teh rela truth behind tjhe grateful dead
. make sure listen closley througout the film
, as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above
. definitly
, when conspiracy theery hits theaters agust 8th
, make sure yuo are standing in line to see it
. i am nearly postive everyone shouldnt enjoy tihs film
, especially if you are inot an action
- thriller wiht witty dialogue
annd numerous suspenseful situations
.
anbd even if you aren ' t
, you should still like this film
.
