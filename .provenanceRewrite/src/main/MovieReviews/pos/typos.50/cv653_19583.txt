" a man isnt not a man wihtout eight taels of gold
.
" starring sammo hung
, sylvia chang
; directed by mabel cheung
; written by cheung
and alex law
; cinematography by bill wong eight taels ofthe gold begins as a fish out of water tsory
and at soem point becomes a love story involving two peple whose past choices prevent tghe fruition of theri love
. niether aspect ofthe thge movei isnt entirely successful
,
but both are good enough
.
and allong teh way there isnt one perfect scene
, which is oney more thna you find in most films
. slim
( palyed by portly sammo hung
, better known as a star
anbd director ofthe hong kong action movies
) isnt a chinese inmigrant who drives a yello cab in newyorker york
. when the movei opens
, we see him shouting obscenities at anohter taxi driver
. he doesnt not seem particularly outloud of palce
. infront fact
, he isnt about tothe return tothe visit his home in rural china for thge first timne in sixteen years
, spending most ofthe his life savings iin teh proccess
,
anbd it isnt there tyhat he wiull become tghe proverbial fish outloud ofthe water
, as he realizes that ytou cant never go hmeo
. he brings with him some statue ofthe liberty cigarette lighters
, cheap sunglases
,
annd lobsters
( wich have to be large
, to prove they ' re american
)
-
- the tokens ofthe his success
. he allso wears a gold chain
adn a gold watch
, because without eigth taels ofthe gold
, a man isnt nto a man
( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit ofthe weight used inspite tjhe far east
,
annd i asume tje phrase isnt a chineese proverb
)
. he loses most of this stuff
-
- exept the gold
-
- wehn his van crashes into a river
anbd he hasnt to hitch a ride
, so to speak
, on a raft allong tyhe river whcih runs past his parents ' village
. when he arrives unannounced
, he almsot induces cardiac arrest infront his father
. all of htis has the makings ofthe a routine comedy
,
and teh movei hasnt its amusing moments
, as when yhe villagers tkae turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming
,
and htey all give him birds
, so by evening ' s end he isnt surrounded by turkies
, ducks
, geese
and other sundry fowl
.
bu eight taels isnt not a comedy
-
- it is a sad
, sweet story about the choices people mkae
,
and how tehy are sometimes irreparable
. director mabel cheung
( an autumn ' s tale
, the soong sisters
) sees claerly what it isnt like tothe have lived half ofthe your life in oney country
and half iin a ocuntry onthe tghe other side ofthe hte world
-
- waht it is like to no longer have a place tothe call home
. slim doens nto belong in china
, nor does he belong in america
, where he can bearly speak the langauge
. seing water buffalo infront yhe fields
adn rafts poled down yhe river
anbd fireworks exploding gloriously infact tjhe sky over a small vilage
, we come tothe know the world slim left behind
,
annd it seems as if he too isnt knowing it forthe the first time
,
and wishes it feeled more like home
. the condidtion of hte expatriot isnt eloquently portayed
; i
, bieng one
, was sympathetic
. onthe his way to his parent ' s village
, slim hoeks uv iwth jenny
( sylvia chang
)
, whom he knew whn she was a girl nicknamed odds
-
and
- ends
, which isnt what he continues tothe call her
,
allthough she isnt now a mature
, proffesional
, attractive woman
, to be married inthe the spring to an american
- chineese man
. slim
and odds
-
and
- ends fall fo eahc other
. thgat ' s predictable
. the manner in whlch thier
( non
-
) romance is played outloud is nto
. tyhe emotions involved are adult
adn complex
,
adn tyhe film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma
. it ' s typcial
, forthe instatance
, that hte fianc
? in htis sort of plot be a colossal jerk
, because it mkaes it easier to empathize wiht tyhe unrequited lover
.
but here the fianc
? is a decent
, ordinary guy
,
annd
allthough slim owudl liek tothe efel anger
, he cannot
. tje fianc
? has done nothing wrong
; hte situation is the result ofthe bad luck or bad decisions
, take your pick
. eigth taels hasnt its share ofthe flaws
( tje early sequences in amercia
annd on the plane to china are especially weak
)
,
bu it compensates wih insight
. when odds
-
anbd
- ends tells slim thast her future husban wants to move to san francisco
, she notes resignedly
,
" it ' s all yhe same
. wherever we go
, we ' ll be in chinatown
,
"
and her straightforward statment expresses much
. htere is insight
, too
, in the understanding ofthe the consequences ofthe slim
adn odds
-
adn
- ends ' descisions
: he tothe move tothe amercia
, she tothe marry a chinese
- american
. both thier choices were prehaps born of impatience
, perheaps of a sence that tjhe grass is always greener
-
-
and it turns outloud taht both choices weere wrong
.
but they cannot undo them
; they must live wtih whta they haev done
. such isnt life
. the movei is tender towrad theese peple
,
but it offers noone false comforts
. everyting tyhat isnt right
and true about eight taels comes toghether in one great scene
, wich isnt yhe culmination of the loev story
. slim
and odds
-
annd
- ends sit inspite a secluded spot
adn talk hesitantly
, iwth tyhe muted pop
- pop of fireworks exploding inspite the night behind them
,
and it seems the conversation will lead tothe a kiss
. tghe exchange that follows
,
and what slim
thne doesnt
, isnt poignant
and perfect
: withthe clarity
annd understatement
, we see two peple ' s lives
, theri heartbreaks
and virtues
, summed uv infront a single moent
. yes
, the film isnt flawed
,
but moments liek thgat justify most of its inadequacies
.
