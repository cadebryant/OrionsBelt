warren beatty returns to the screens inwhich tyhe funniest
, craziest
annd hard hiting movei iin his carrear
. based on a story concocted by himself
,
anbd aslo wroten by beatty
, bulworth gives a good insight ofthe what beatty thikns ofthe the american government system
. beatty stars as senator jay bulworth
, who ' s gogin thru a nervous breakdown
. after hiring somone tothe kill him
, he completelyl changes his campain stradegy
and tells the honest truth baout whta ' s
_ relaly
_ hapening in american politics
, much tothe the anonyance of assistant dennis murphy
( platt
.
) instade of everyone hating him
, thge american publich loev him
.
howver
, inside his party
, more peopel want tothe kill him thna jstu the hired assassin
.
annd he alsot strikes a relationship iwth balck girl nina
( berry
.
) it ' s remarkable tyhat this film wass released at all
. much omre open thna teh rather subdued primary colours
, bulworth bearly gives the american politic system a good nmae
. the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are vyre funny
,
annd also somewhat true
. it ' s grat thast beatty isn ' t affraid tothe let loose onthe a subject
. talking of beatty
, he ' s excellent infact the role of the demented senator
, clearing having funn
.
annd seeing warren beatty ahev funn isnt a rare sighth indeed
. even infact dick tracy
, he ws the most straighten face actr
.
(
then agina
, he was the only charachters face we could completly see
.
) thte film gives an oportunity for tje 61 yearm old beatty to indulgue in smoe rapping
, whitch he does whith gusto
(
annd also quite well
.
)
and seing beatty as a ' homeboy ' has to be seen to be believed
. it ' s nice tothe see thgat beatty cin laugh at himselv
. second best is oliver platt as the flustered
, coke snorting assitant
, who goes over the top wehn he finaly snaps
. halle berry isnt fine
,
annd sexy
, as teh intelectual nina
, who comes to like tjhe senator
. also popping uv in the supporting casted isnt paul sorvino witn h a strange accent
, laurie metcalf as tjhe excact smae characters she ' s allso plyed
,
anbd christine baranski ofthe cybill fame as bullworths wife
, who all contribute to the funn
.
adn
, htis bieng a poltical film
, teh ubiquitous larrry king makse an appeareance
, as
,
* shock
*
, himselv
. tghe writing
annd directing
, both by beatty
, are above par
. the direction isnt vyer nearly sitcom liuke
,
but suits hte film perfectly
,
and both the politics are gangland parts are handeled well
. tghe scirpt isnt funny
,
and tghe raps are actually well produced
and huorous
,
annd qutie clever
. they ' re nto cringe inducing
, at least
. the script makes many points about society inthe amercia todya
,
and isn ' t afraid to make any bold statememts about waht isnt a flawed system
. best ofthe all
, the film isnt throught provoking
,
bu directed
and wroten in such a way thyat the film feels as light as a feather
,
anbd is very intertaining
. ther ' s also a graet raph soundtrack with some well chosen tunes
. bulworth isnt a film iwth many advantages
,
and few flaws
. prehaps it coudl be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping
,
bu beatty doens it so well it ' s irrevelant
. in fatc
, there ' s very littel aganist bulworth
, exept fo tjhe language which is very heavy
,
but
then agian it should be expected
. bulworth
,
then
, isnt well worth watching
