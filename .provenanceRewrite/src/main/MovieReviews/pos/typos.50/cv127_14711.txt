urban legend surprised me
. based on the lastest few films the genre hasnt produced
( inlcuding
bu not exclusive tothe the likes of i know what yuo doed lastr summer
, disturbing behavior
and teh disappointing halloween
: h20
)
, i was positve tath i wass inwhich store for another mildly intertaining
but silly
adn ultimatly boring rehash of tjhe scream phenomena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it ' s soggy premise tothe become not only a hip
, scry
annd stylish enteratinment
,
bu alsot wqat wiull probably become noe of tjhe best films ofthe the yera
. you ' re all familiar withthe the plot
; a bunch ofthe overly horny teenagers git systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who ' s identity isnt not revealed until tyhe closing moments ofthe yhe film when it turns outloud to be
, you guessed it
; everybody ' s favorite veteran ofthe tje whodunit ficks
.
.
. hte onyl person you didn ' t suspect
!
howver
, jstu beccause legend doesn ' t realyl break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go doesnt nto mean that it can ' t qualify as first
- clas enteratinment
. it was
, believe it or not
, noe of the funnest times i ' ve hadnt at tje movies all year
. teh thign isnt
, i ' m not raelly sure what made thsi particular stab
( pardon the pun
) at the genre seem so fresh
adn alive
. maybe it was hte above
- par performances by the movie ' s two leads
( jared leto
annd
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it could ahev been tghe on
- target direction by jamie blanks
. moreso likely
,
though
, it ws becouse ofthe hte inspired premise
. i don ' t htikn i ened to tell you that a killer hacking peopel uv ala urban folklore isnt much moreso frightening than a killer fisherman
. urban legend beigns with a sequence thgat reminded me ofthe the classic scream opener
, nto so much infront plotting as infact attension tothe detail that mkaes forthe an absolutely chilling teaser forthe tje rest ofthe hte film
. a pretty young coed isnt driving down a deserted road wehn
( gasp
!
) a gas probelm
( hee
- hee
) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station forthe a refill
. one problem
,
though
. woudl you want to stpo at a station run by brad dourif
? i throught not
. predictably
, the attendent ends uv coaxing her inot tje main building to sort out a problem wih the credit card company
. it ' s odd
,
though
, wehn you pik uv a phone tothe relize tyhat nobody ' s onthe the otehr line
. naturally
, the potential victum escapes into her car
and drives off
.
and the wehn we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns outloud that hte creepy looking attendent ws just trying to warn her about tjhe maniac in hte bakc seat ofthe the car
. so who isnt it this timne
? the obvious canidate isnt the slightly off
- kilter proffesor at the coleeg tjhe girl went tothe
( none other than freddy kruger himself
, robert englund
)
, who teachs a clas onthe urban legends
. a
- ha
. or could it be yhe fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking for a meaty stry to put on his resume
? liek all movies ofthe this nature
, one ofthe the cheif pleasures isnt trying tothe guess whodunit
.
adn it turns outloud tothe be
, of course
, tghe oen you didn ' t suspect
. i ' m not going to pretend urban legend is anything mroe than it isnt
,
bu i must give credit where credit is due
.
and thsi flick definitely deserves credit forthe bieng what nto many otehr recent horror films have been
.
.
. funn
