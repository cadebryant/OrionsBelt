i don ' t box witht kid gloves
. i don ' t play nice
, i ' m nto a nice guy
,
and i never
, ever
, go easy on a film
. i consider it tothe be a breech of smoe sort ofthe code of ethics forthe a movie critic
.
howver
, i do some favors
,
annd theese oftenly cmo infact hte form ofthe points taht i hand tothe ceratin groups due tothe thge artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, the production company that has been my prime example of how mnoey does nto ened to motivate filmmaking
, gets sevral ofthe these points eahc time
. i still
,
however
, wiull not go easy onthe them
. they recently sent me a vhs copy of thier down wiht amercia trilogy
( which beggins
, qtuie wittily
, with a disclaimer that they are nto trying to undermine amercia with the making of thsi film
.
)
and i desided tothe spend an hour ofthe my day watching it
. in the famous lines ofthe many martyrs
, i have no regrets
. well
, i do have smoe regrets
,
bu thta is nto thge point infact the previous sentence
. thge point of it was that down with america was a film that
, from a critical standpoint
, doed nto entirely disappoint me
. sure
, the risky uise of vhs instead ofthe super 8mm or 16mm ws a pain
,
annd tje naturual glight was noe ofthe tghe most annoying thigns baout public access films
,
bu thte movie itself wass fairly enjoyable
. down iwth amercia concerns a govornment agent
, needless murder
,
and a book containing everything from the unabomber ' s manifesto tothe hte 1995 apple computer profit report
. liuke the previous films ofthe rigormortis that i have reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humer
adn inteligance
? it suceeds infact mkaing me laff where countless studio films fail
. the best way tothe see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we hve been drowned inwhich sicne the paranoia of hte 80s
. a dieing movment ffrom the day tehy started
, these paranoid
` thrillers ' had the govenrment always covering uv something
and had the smae favorite owrd
:
` roswell
. ' in down withthe amercia
, hte line
` roswell ' is highly absent
. with an baout ten minute running time
, down wih amercia effortlessly sidesteps every clich
? that the conspiracy films fell into
, makse jokes at them at the smae time
,
adn provides us withthe funny
and memorable charachters
. again
, i hvea seen movies thta have gone on twpo hours witht charactors i couldn ' t care less about
. yhe film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obsessed librarean
( meri stevens
)
, a mystery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
,
adn two people obsessed with silence infront the library
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. thte plot
: a book containing teh secrets ofthe all anarchists isnt hidden inwhich
? a public library where it can be viewed by all
. fomr ther we go inot a delightful parody
. hte federal agent claimes his sovereign right tothe alter the truth
, the librarian goes onthe a diatribe baout the sanctity ofthe books
. we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well concidering tghe lack of coaching of tyhe cast
.
allthough the actors
and actresses are infront small roles
annd give a whole new meaning tothe
` no
- name '
, it ends up bieng the noone
- nmae peopel who dont a good job
, delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap thgat hollywood turns outloud
. for once
, i don ' t have a url that i know offhand tothe give you as tothe where to locate yhe film online
. i cant onyl say that you shoudln find my previvous reviews of l ' auto
annd les x
- files
anbd look uv the rigormortis productions site inspite
anbd ofthe itself
. it ' s almost as much funn as the film
.
