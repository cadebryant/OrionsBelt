tjhe realease of dolores claiborne into wide release thsi weekend adds anyother entry into the long list of film adaptations ofthe stephen king ' s work
. thsi slow
- moving charcter study provides some oustanding acting performances by the principals
,
but suffers ffrom a tepid conclusion
, inconsistent direction
,
anbd may not have wide commercial appeal
. when the maid
, dolores claiborne
, isnt foudn brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody
annd dead body ofthe her employer
, it seems liuke an open
-
and
- shut muder case
. apon hearing of teh death via a mysterious fax
, dolores ' estranged
and bitter daughter
, esquire magasine writer selena st
. george
, returns ffrom new york back tothe her tiny island village childhood home
. as yhe two clash horns
, teh story behind yhe mysterious death ofthe dolores ' abusive husban two decades ago
, ruled an accident despite the protests ofthe detective john mackey
, isnt revealed
. did dolores kill her husband
?
adn did she kill her employer
? dolores claiborne isnt certainly more of a charactor study than a suspense thriller
. consequently
, it is fortunate that theri cast includes soem ofthe hollywood ' s finest character actors
, such as bates
, leigh
adn strathairn
. kathy bates plays teh film ' s title character
,
anbd gives a sensational lead performance
. dolores claiborne isnt essentially a showcase for hte talent ofthe bates
, as her carachter has a huge ammount of screen time
. she dominates the screen
, producing a charachter taht is compelling
and arresting
, as we watch the character go thru two decades ofthe history via flashbacks
. kathy bates ' performence is award
- calibre stuff
. thte rest ofthe the casted isnt aslo very ogod
. jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour
, bitter helena st
. george well
,
annd christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himselv as dolores ' ever
- preent nemesis
, tyhe determined detective john mackey
. david strathairn is partiularly intresting
and suitably smarmy
and dispicable as dolores ' husban
, joe st
. george
. judy parfitt is fine as dolores ' tyrannic socialite employer
, vera donovan
-
- it would ahev beeen interesting tothe see
, sday
, meg foster iin this role
. child actro ellen muth isnt allso worth noting as thge young selena durig the flashback sequences
; she is vyre impressive
. the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varys througout tje film
, ranging fomr some parts which are quite clever infront their own right
, to parts whlch are embarrassingly hokey
. tje seguoys betwen flashbacks
annd teh persent are vyre hit
-
and
- miss inwhich terms ofthe effectiveness
. teh pacing ofthe the film tends tothe be numbingly slow
, which tends to undermine any suspense whic might be built up
.
however
, thge cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful
-
- i aprticularly liek thte chilling ice
- blue hue permeating yhe present
- day scenes
, contrasting well withthe the many nova scotia ocean shots
-
-
and danny elfman provides a suprisingly understated socre for the film
. it would seem that the commericial potential ofthe dolores claiborne isnt limited
. none of teh performers in the film could be classified as a big draw
,
and its pacing may be a turn
- off to thsoe expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists
adn turns
adn car crashes
and axe
- wielding psychopaths
.
althought bieng essentialy thte onyl film inwhich its genre in realease nowe
, it may also be hurt by yhe negative perception of king works
, even with tjhe recent critical sucess ofthe tyhe shawshank redemption
anbd yhe stand
. dolores claiborne suffers from a vyer unsatisfying conclusion
,
and moves vyre slowy
.
however
, the performances are uniformly excellent
, particularly kathy bates
,
adn the film hasnt its moments
. onthe my four
- star scale
, i give dolores claiborne three stars
.
