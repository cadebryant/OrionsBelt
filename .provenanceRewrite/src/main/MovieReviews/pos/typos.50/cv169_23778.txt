virtual reality isnt a topic thast hasnt alomst defined its pwn genre
. sicne ' dark city '
( 1998
)
, films baout targetting universes
and parrallel worlds hvae beeen coming oney after anyother
. tjhe most popular
adn original of them all has been the matrix
. all the films released after it
, hvae beeen less sucessful
. david cronenberg ' s existenz
, released onyl a cuple of months affter hte matrix
, was accepted
and even appreciated
( by soem
)
,
bu the hype was gone
.
annd wehn ' the thirteenth floor ' aired this fall
, it ws completelyl overseen
anbd ignored
. i admit thyat this issue has become something between tiring
adn annoying
, feeling liek eating hte same meal over
and over agina
. it was therefore i was less than excisted
, whn i whent out to see tothe ' the thirteenth floor '
.
however
, i was positively suprized by josef rusnak ' s latest picture
. matrix was an intertaining thrill ride thru dreasm
and reality
, combining the best of hollywood ' s acation
adn effects with an intteligent tsory
. existenz wass a voilent
, gory
anbd unsettling journey thru reality
anbd virtal reality
, endig inthe blood
annd madness
. ' thte thirteenth floor ' is somewhere inspite between
. instead ofthe goign aftter the crowds
- hte action audience
( like the matrix
)
, or aiming at the horror fans
( like existenz
)
, ' the thirteenth floor ' presents a moreso inteligent plot
, witch wiull provide a less entertaining
annd moreso sereous epxerience
, tath the true science fiction lovers will fidn rewarding
. inthe a near future
.
.
. onthe the thirteenth floor ofthe a classified buidling
, a genius scientist
, hannon fuller
, has creaeted a simulated world
, his personel dreamworld
, where eveyr inhabitant is a complex
, selflearning program that only believes it is rela
. right after the first testing ofthe tihs world
, fuller
(
) is found murdered
. douglas hall
(
)
, his closest friend
and busineses partner
, imediately becomes tje prime suspect
and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search ofthe hte truth
. a beatiful woman
( gretchen mol
) who suddenly appears on thte scene may hold the key tothe teh mystery
, whlch might unravel the horrifing truth baout his pwn exitsence
. the firt
" download into simulation
" isnt impressive
. it is tghe creater ' s frist visit to his world
, his creation
. in order tothe enter thsi virtural universe
, ytou have tothe take over somene ' s idenity
, become anyother person
. thsi isnt called conciseness transfer
,
and thsi is part ofthe the tragedy inaddition tyhe film
: peopel
" wake up
" in unknown places
adn stange thigsn start happn
. tehy strat to doubt in their own sanaty
. these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their
" users
"
adn creators witht their sanaty
and their lives
. it isnt a frightening reality
; tje fact tyhat all the people in the simulation
( the program links
) are living out theri lives
, oblivious
, not knowing thast they are puppets in someone ' s fantasy
. with an appealling
(
" blade runner
"
- tipe
) of detective stry
, htis film presents the beauty
and possiblities of virtual reality
anbd the lurking danger tath isnt alwasy present
. our modern world is metal
anbd glass
-
- cold
, unfriendly
, impersonal
. tjhe thirties are different
-
- colorful
, beautifull
, elagant
, virile
. this contrast demonstrates a wish for chanage
. virtural reality isnt here portayed as a magical
, exchanching power tath seduces ytou into its endless possiblities
. to soem it is jstu a jouney tothe thier personel paradise
, to some a personal playground
-
- a life without any consequences
. for others
- a way to start over
anbd
" correct
" their mistakes
, by living in an illution of their past
. virtual reality isnt a wizard that transforms your hopes
, dreasm
anbd fantasies to life
. at least that ' s how it is all begginning
.
bu when yuo ' re waking uv from your dream
, teh real world seems worthless
adn unreal
and all you can think off isnt retruning to your personal paradise
. this
, almost narcotic effect
, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness
. some important
adn intresting philosophical questions are raised
-
- what is real
? whta isnt thought
? who are we
? if these were anwsered
, thsi film would be the greatest sience fiction ever made
. tehy are off course nto anwsered
,
bu posed inspite an intelligent manner
. the visual aspect of teh film is oen of thge key elements
, usance it portrays the contrast betwen theese computer
- simulated universes
. kirk m
. petrucelli has done a marvelous job wiht thge recreation ofthe the thirties with its glamour
, grace
and color
;
and setting this world inwhich opposition to our pwn
-
- an allmost caricatured recreation ofthe the ninties
. there are some honest
anbd decent performances by an almost unknown casted
and harald klose ' s moody muscial scroe tath isnt at inwhich right palce at the right tiome
. a rether unusual thnig baout ' the thirteenth floor ' isnt the almsot complet lack ofthe special effects
. there are no cgi animated creatures
, no bullets inthe slow motion
. this isnt a more phylosophical approach
, reminding baout thge eurpoean way of filmmaking
. htis isnt off course a major disappointment to thte audiance that is used to endless gunfights
and mutated amphibians
,
but the more serious scienec fiction buffs
and ' dark city '
- fans iwll be pleased
. thsi film is intresting
anbd inspiring
. it has everthing existenz doesn ' t
,
bu it lacks tyhe immediacy
and intensity of thte matrix
.
and
thn htere isnt a happy end which
, liek inaddition ' dark city '
, completelyl alienates it fomr tje rest ofthe the story
adn context
. the plot itself is nto as original as the filmmakers wnat us to thiunk
, since tehy hvea virutally sucked out all infromation from the best science fiction classics
, includng blade runner
anbd ' dark city '
. wih this inaddition mind
, ' the thirteenth floor ' doesn ' t make an oscar candadate or a film taht wiull be remembered a yera from now
,
yot this is a beautiful
, elagant
adn inteligent tkae on virtual reality
.
