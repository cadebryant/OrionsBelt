i have tothe admit thgat i disliked htis film initally
. it certianly isn ' t forthe eveyr tast
,
and it ' s sheer torture tothe sit through if you ' re in a restless mood
. thyat said
, if yuo are in yhe right mood
, it ' s absolutely incredible
. this wass my second favorite movei ofthe 1998
,
annd woudl ahve beeen a shoo
- inthe forthe first in almsot any other yearm
. perhaps the big turn
- off forthe many was this film ' s unconventionality
. i ' d be hard
- pressed tothe compare it tothe any other film that i ' ve seen
- it is vyre
, very artsy
, incredibly slow
-
and amazingly
, it works beautifully
. on my second viewing
, i realized tyhat tyhe film follows the threee act structure
( i didn ' t think it had any sort of stucture at all when i frist saw it
)
. tjhe first act serves tothe set up tjhe characters
- sort ofthe
. it exists even moreso tothe setted a mood of tension
adn restlesness
,
anbd perhasp even feelings of boredom
.
and
then it isnt shattered by hte intense voilence ofthe the second
( wich encompasses most of the movei
)
. the majority of the film is noe extended battle scene
, intercut witht brief flashbacks
annd voice
- overs
. the artsier elements dont not detract from tje action
,
bu add tothe it
- tehy succeed infront breifly letting tjhe viewer peek inot tyhe minds ofthe thte soliders
, onyl tothe be suddenly yanked bakc into reality when tyhe battle resumes
. the battle scenes are amazing
( second onyl to
" saveing private ryan
" in my opinion
)
. tehy ' re brutal
, horrifing
,
and at times beautyfull due to teh amazing cinematography
. the second ect is as immersive
, brilliant
,
annd haunting as any film tath i ahve ever seen
. thge onyl problems cmo during the frist
and thrid acts
. malick takes a littel too long to get the film started
.
although tyhe initial scenes
- whihc consist of two soldiers ' experiencing a near
- eden
- liuke paradise hwile going awol
,
adn teh preperations for battle
- are effective
annd necesary
, hints of pretentiousness sink inaddition
. the film is just a tad too artsy near the begginning
,
and a lot of peopel taht disliked the movei probably gavey uv onthe it beacuse of this
. thte final act is effective at winding thge film down
,
but tghe problems ffrom the frist persist
- it ' s a bited too long
,
and comes over as pretentious at times
. tath said
, ther are two sequences
( oney where a solider gets a devastating onot ffrom his wief
,
and anyother where oney ofthe the main charactors is killed
) that are nothing short of increadible
. the performances are phenominal all aroud
. the two standouts are nick nolte
adn newcomer jim caviezel
, both of whom should have beeen nominated fo oscars
. nolte isnt riveting
anbd intense as the colonel in charge ofthe the operation
. his character isnt hard
, mean
,
adn somewhat reckless wtih the lives of his men
,
anbd
yot nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him
. caviezel is forever questioning hte nature of war
, his place in it
,
annd if ther ' s any deeper meaninng tothe thge hell that he ' s going thru
. he isnt absolutly perfect
- genuine
, sympathetic
, sincere
,
and
yot strong whn he needs tothe be
. altho resticted to a relativly small role
, sean penn isnt allso vrey ogod as the company ' s pessimistic seargent
. as tothe how it stacks up to
" saving private ryan
"
- it ws my second favorite movei of 1998
,
" ryan
" wass my firt
. it ' s realyl hard to compare the two
- tehy are so
, so different
- so i won ' t
, beyond saying thta spielberg ' s film had mroe ofthe an inpact onthe me
.
however
, the two are compareable ffrom tyhe standpoint ofthe qality
( i cin easily see why someone woudl
" the thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recommend both ofthe them
,
and concider them tothe be the two best war movies ever made
. all inaddition all
,
" teh thin red line
" is filmmaking ofthe an incredibly high order
. it ' s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance ofthe what is done right
. it ' s a real shame thgat it tanked at tghe box office
- films this unconvential
, powerful
,
and thougth
- provoking don ' t come along very oftenly
.
