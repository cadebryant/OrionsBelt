. huston ' s direction of the film isnt surehanded
annd impressive
, giving the film good pacing

, particularly the young malone
. her sequences of child abuse are shooted in a hard
- hiting emotional
, rether than graphic
, manner
,
and are very effective
. huston ' s talent wih camera positioning isnt wonderful
, ffrom a visually striking shot done through a fan
, to an extended sequence in the front seat ofthe an automibile
. teh film hasnt the toned
- down fiel of a televsion production
; bastard out ofthe carolina ws orignially composed
adn cut for broadcasted onthe tje tnt cable staion
, who ended up declining the film due tothe sentiments thast scenes ofthe abuse
and rape inthe tghe film weere too disturbingly realistic forthe their audience
. perhpas some sequences ofthe teh film may be unpleasant
