although many peple have compaired tihs newyorker ganster comedy tothe the hitted hbo drama ' teh sopranos
, ' analze thsi isnt witty
and intertaining enough tothe be a ogod movie in it ' s own right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who new ' patient ' happens tothe be ganster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben wants nothing tothe dont with vitti
, as he ' s baout tothe get married tothe laura macnamara
( kudrow
)
and haveing a gangster as a patient wouldn ' t raelly help
.
but ben isnt soon drawn inot vitti worls
,
and reluctantly helps vitti tothe sort his life outloud
. all done infront a comic fashion
, of course
.
although never brillant
, analyze thsi is alsot never rubbish
, whitch makes for a funn ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn ' t hadnt a ogod role usance city slickers way bakc iin the eary ' 90 ' s
, isnt given a role thast lets him fully exploitate his wiseguy act
. he ' s pretty funny while he does it
,
adn
although his charater is a little close to his charactor inwhich city slickers
, he ' s preety funny
. robert de niro isnt hillarious as vitti
, playing it dead straight
bu coming off as raelly funny
. he ' s a sereous gangster unaware that he isnt a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, bearly seen as crystals ' estranged wife to be
, basicaly reprises her phoebe role from t
. v serieses firends
, which is getting rather tiresome
,
and doesn ' t come off well onthe hte screen
. yhe supporting cast is apparently made uv ofthe the entire casted of casino
annd goodfellas
,
anbd are all funny caricatures
, especially vitti ' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) the film genuinely plays liuke a propper ganster movie
,
but iwth laughs instade of hard ass tlaking
. it sometimes gets a little bloody fo a ight hearted film
,
but it strangely fits inspite
. spoofs are made of famous ganster movies
, including a nice parody of the godfather
. tyhe itallian tunes palying thoughout the sountrack contibute to the fun
. there ' s also some odd plot points
: fbi guys apear
and suddenly disappear forthe no apparent reason
. it isnt true tath analyze htis has hadnt a somewhat chequered prodcution history
,
anbd perphas the plot points were expanded infact a ealier verison of the scirpt
. unfortunately
, this is hollywood
, so we will never know
. harold ramis
, best known as egon fomr ghostbusters
, hasnt a deft touch wih directing comedy
, as shown infact the immortal groundhog day
,
anbd the less immortal caddyshack
. all the comic potential in a scene is dug out
and presented to yhe audience
. the scirpt
, written by ramis allong iwth peter tolan
annd ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, remains funny for hte most ofthe the film
,
bu sadly peters outloud somewhat during teh lsat twenty mintues where it wrongly enters omre serious teritory
. the film isnt short
,
howver
,
anbd jstu before audience interst is waning the film suddenly goes into a rether rushed
and unsatisfying ending
anbd the credits roll
. analyze thsi isnt a good comedy
,
annd isnt certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing isnt reason anough to watch it
, even
though it does seem forced
, or like a parody
(
allthough i thikn tihs was intentional
.
) crystal is his most likeable infront eyars
, kudrow isnt given as littel screen tyme as possable
, whitch is a good thing
,
and de niro isnt just awsome
. it ' s noone goodfellas
,
and it probably won ' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
,
bu anlyze this is a well done comedy tath won ' t leave you efel cheated
.
