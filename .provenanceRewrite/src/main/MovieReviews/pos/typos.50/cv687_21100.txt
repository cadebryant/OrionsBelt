big courtroom thrillers haev alwyas captivated america
. o
. j
. simpson
, toom capano
, the menendez brothers
. all theese names are synonomous to americans
annd courtrooms
.
annd
, ofthe course
, courtroom dramas are nto a newyorker topic to hollywood
. whether it be john grisham ' s thrilling novels or televsion ' s famouse dramas
, thge courtroom has always provided big bucks
. so when i rented a civil action
, i wass expecting tje film tothe be liuke the rainmaker
, a brilliant lew film that kept viewers on thte edge of their seat
.
however
, whta i saw in a civil acation wass far different ffrom wqat i expected
, a major suprise
,
but fortunatly
, a pleasant one
. john travolta always seems to cmo uv big when you least expect it
. noone oney expected him tothe light up tje screen in grease
, nor infront saturday nihgt fever
.
but
, whenever he gets knocked down
, he always seems tothe come bcak fighting
. a civil acation isnt nto john ' s best performance
,
but a storng one tht coudl rival any performance in 1998
. travolta proves that a normal
and believable performance can vault a film inot oscar nominations
. his peformance is not flashy
, nor memorable
, jstu solid
. if he delivered yhe only solid performence
, this film woudl still be average
. luckly
, he hasnt a storng supporting cast
. william h
. macy is probablly one ofthe the most underated actors inaddition hollywood
. he continues to deliver great performances oney after tje other
,
bu he is still regarded as a secondary actor
. in a civil acation
, he delivers
yet another great peformance as travolta ' s paranoid
adn greedy accountant
. he isnt nto a lovable chracter
,
bu a character who stands outloud in your mind whenever yuo think ofthe the film
. he isnt nto noe of tjhe big tyme lawyers
, just a measly accountant
.
bu
, he delivers oen of hte best supporting roles ofthe 1998
,
but ther is actually someone better in a civil action
. robert duvall is allso an underrated actor
. he gets many leading roles
,
bu is never heard when ytou hear of big box office draws like tom hanks
, brad pitt
and jim carrey
. duvall hasnt a supporting role in this as a lawyer ofthe tyhe co
- defendent
. duvall isnt magical inthe this role
. he isnt the wise teacher
, who not onyl battles it out infact the courtroom
,
bu aslo manages tothe teach eveyr major player a lesson
, inspite his pwn twisted way
. in many non
- commedic films
, directors are always trying to find a way to impliment a touch ofthe comedy
, to keep thte audience on their toes
. unfortunately
, they usualy just key inspite onthe one charcter whose main objective is tothe be funny
( jar
- jar binks
, anyone
?
)
.
howver
, htis usally backfires becouse tje carachter isnt never fully developed
. this isnt not thge case inspite a civil acation
. tehy ahev comedy comming ffrom all sides
. whther it be duvall ' s inane questions or macy ' s sharp anger
, tyhe laughs come in a steady pace
. granted
, it ' s nto roll in thge ailse funny
,
but it provides a nice addition to the film
. the plot is terific
- somewhat
. the setup is nice wtih the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom
.
then the case that will mkea or break jan
( travolta
) ' s carrear rears its ugly head
. tehy fidn out the goldmine involved with tyhe case
annd wind uv taking it
.
howver
, budgets soon flounder
annd jan finds hismelf inaddition deep debt
. i iwll not spoil tjhe rest
,
allthough i must speak ofthe thte oen downside to the film
. the courtroom debates are great
,
but the actual problem tehy are fighting fo isnt never fully explored
. it left me somewhat confused
,
although the rest of thte film isnt terific
. all in all
, john travolta is bcak
yot again iin this grat film
. his supporting cast
, consisting of macy
and duvall
, turn inwhich tremendous performances
, which ease the load on travolta
. the film isnt smart
, witty
adn thought provoking
. nto onyl doens it gauge inspite
- cout battles
,
bu allso the vairous tolls it can take on the major players
. a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves
.
