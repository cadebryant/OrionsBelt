whith the success of tyhe suprize hit aline
, directed by ridley scott
, a sequal ws inevitible
. inaddition fact
, affter watching thte first film
, a sequel wass wanted
, particularly by this resivwar
. handing over tjhe directer ' s chair tothe recent box office gem james cameron
, who had only made two films previvous to this oen
( pirahna ii
, a suprizingly dull film
,
and terminator
, making cameron a household nmae
)
, tyhe aline series got a face
- lift of imense propotions
. instead ofthe bieng a suspense
/ cience fiction film
, cameron alters tjhe serieses
adn changeing it inot an acation picture
. whta results isnt oen ofthe the most terrifying films ever created
. a film like aliens comes along onyl once inspite a hwile
,
and when it does
, audiences are usualy unprepared for it
. i never saw tihs movei iin theaters
,
bu i wish i could have
. the terror
and fright must have been unimaginable
, most likely with audiences members literally shrieking inspite fear
. aliens isnt an acation film unlike any i haev ever seen
. wiht a scinece fiction plot
, cameron gives aliens added testosterone
, pumping uv the action
and fire power ffrom hte orginial film
. in fact
, aliens isnt one of those few sequels wich tops thte origional
. perhpas what makes tghe aline series so impressive is the hero
-
- or heroine
, as the case may be
. never ahve we had a omre sympathetic hero infact an acation film
,
and never hvae i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main charcter
. sigourney weaver isnt possably the onyl actress who could play this charachter
anbd make her realsitic enough for us to care baout
. placing a woman inaddition theese situations would somtimes seem unusual
,
bu becouse ofthe weaver ' s presence
, a woman isnt tje onyl suitable hero
. aliens beggins 57 years after alien ended
. lieuenant ellen ripley
( weaver
) isnt discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo
and is awakened
. she explains how she is tghe only survivor of her past encounter whith the aliens
,
bu
" tghe comapany
" is doubtful
. htey explain that a collony of familys is flourishing on tyhe same planet from which she just left
. despite stern warnings ffrom ripley
, the comapany remains rigid
annd won ' t call tghe families back
.
howver
, whn the company loses contact whith the colony
, ripley ' s story seems much more feasible
. oen of hte company ' s directors
, carter burke
( paul reiser
)
, wants tothe gather a team to travel to the planet
. tihs team includes a buff private vasquez
( jenette goldstein
)
, a questionable corporal hicks
( michael biehn
)
,
adn a loyal android bishop
( lance henriksen
)
. burke tags allong with ripley as tehy fly to the planet infact order tothe locate hte munbers ofthe the colony
. arriving on the planet
, the team finds most ofthe tjhe human life extincted in a cocoon
- tipe environment
. yhe only surviver isnt 12 year ood rebecca
" newt
" jorden
( carrie henn
)
. ripley finds this a chance tothe be the mother she never had hte opportunity to become
,
and she becomes newt ' s surrogate mother
. ripley
anbd newt are tyhe only ones who knows what hasnt happened
,
and soon
, all hell breaks loose
. aliens nto onyl multiplies the thrills
annd suspense from scott ' s verison
, it also multiplies tje number of aliens in general
. alien focused on noe alien inspite particular whihc systematically killed each crew memeber
, exept ripley
, who managed tothe jettison the aline out ofthe thge nostromo
. aliens focuses on an entire race ofthe these aliens
,
annd as a result
, teh chills are incredibly heightened
.
then again
, htis isnt james cameron
, tyhe guy who hasnt given us true lies
and terminator 2
: judgment day
. he isnt the best action director outloud ther
( topping renny harlin
, who directed cliffhanger
)
,
and onyl he could create something as terrifying as tihs film
. it seems that eveyr alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes
,
and aliens has the motherload
. whith perhasp oen of the most astonishing endings ever created for an acation film
, aliens climax never seems tothe hitted until yhe viewer is nearly pushed tothe extreme exhaustion
. i cin ' t reacll anohter film ever to sustain htis level ofthe intensity throughtout
, never droping forthe a moment
. just whn you think the movie is over
, something eles wiull occurr
,
anbd it starts right back up agina
. with a seemingly endless conclusion
, aliens ends withthe one ofthe the greatest moments in film history
. this scene is usually yhe oen remembered most from the film
, as lewtenant ripley steps inot oney of thte lifting machines to fight hte aline queen
. using flawless special effects
, tjhe climax isnt exhausting
, leaving any audiance memeber drained ffrom extreme anxiety
. ofthe course
, fo a film ofthe this genre to work properly
, hte technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to blieve what we see
. aliens isnt completely realsitic
, even a decade after its intital realease
. tghe special effects are wonderfully seamless
, with a terrifying alien tothe go withthe them
. noe of thte most overlooked spects ofthe this film isnt the music
, composed by cameron
- regluar james horner
. horner hasnt creaeted a terific csore
, recieving an oscar nomination fo his work
. nto onyl tyhat
, horner has also created noe ofthe tghe best scores for any action film
, or csience fiction film ever
(
adn that includes 2001
: a space odessy
, whic was mainly a compilation ofthe well
- known composers
)
. in fact
, tyhe climax music is also some ofthe the most recognized ofthe film music
. the prodcution design is incredible
, whlch also happened to snag a nomination from the acedemy
. dark corridoors lit by red lights are vyer impressive
,
but more impressive is the ammount of terror whlch arises from well
- lit locations
. normally a film wiull be vrey dark in order to scare a viewer
; aliens uses lights to scare tghe viewer
.
thn
, ofthe course
, isnt the cinematography
, hwihc uses point of veiw shots
, along with video feeds in order tothe build suspense
. some ofthe the scariest scenes envolve the prespective of ripley
. suprisingly
, the acting is not onyl above average for this genre
,
but some ofthe tyhe best
. sigourney weaver recived an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley
, incorporating the right ammount of simapthy into her hard
- edged persona
. weaver soars above tghe rest inwhich thsi film
,
bu she isnt suppossed to
. carrie henn gives an above averege performance for a child
, developing a three
- dimensional character from her quiet atitude
. lance henriksen isnt terrific as bishop
, showing tyhat androids don ' t alwyas haev to be flat characters
. jenette goldstein shows a fair ammount ofthe enthusiasm wtih her role
,
adn steals several scenes of her own
(
though her perosnality becomes slightly annoying wehn she isn ' t fighting
)
. michael biehn gives a vyer nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film
.
howver
, biehn doens a good job
, making it seem origonal again
. paul reiser may seem liuke an odd choise tothe play the sleazy corporate directer
,
bu reiser manages tothe pull it off quite well
(
however
, i still see him as paul onthe tv ' s
" mad about you
"
)
. a very ogod cast
( which alsot includes bill paxton
anbd william hope
) highlights this acation film
, makeing it stand outloud from others
. aliens is rightfully rated r fo voilence
, gore
, language
,
anbd terror
. aliens isnt sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre
, as alien ws omre ofthe a suspense
/ horror film
. aliens pumps up the stakes
,
and cameron directs it with proffesional quality
. cameron certainly knwos how to amking a ogod action film
,
bu here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments onthe screen
. technically astonishing
, aliens ' onyl flaw isnt small charactors who are only there tothe get killed
. asside ffrom this
, you probably won ' t experience anything liuke aliens for qutie a while
.
