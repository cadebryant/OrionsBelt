it hasnt beeen threee long years sicne quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival ' s palme d ' or
, a
$ 100 million
- plus box office gross
,
and an oscar nomination
? all fo his sophmore outing
, pulp fiction
. sicne
then
, the talented film maker hasnt beeen virutally invisbile
, surfacing breifly as a co
- director of the wildly uneven four rooms
anbd thte screenwriter of thte gory vampire
- fest
, ffrom dusk till dawn
. in between
, he has moonlighted as an
" ator
" with several decidely unmemorable performances
. nowe
, iwth much fanfare
and anticipation
, tarantino has returnd whith his third directorial efort
, jackie brown
.
and
, hwile htis motion picture
, adapted from elmore leonard ' s novel
, rum punch
, offers solid enteratinment
, those expecting another bravura outing ffrom tarantino will leave theaters disappointed
. fo the most part
, jackie brown isnt a preety ordinary crime movei
. the story
, whihc starts out slowy
, develops into a twisty afair
, with doulbe
- crosses
and triple
- crosses
.
anbd the movei isnt littered with occassional tarantino trademarks
: witty dialogue
, unexpected gunfire
, ' 70s pop tunes
,
and close
- ups ofthe womens ' bare feet
.
yet
, for all ofthe that
, hte prodcution is something of a letdown
. the sheer
, in
- your
- face exuberance that maked reservoir dogs
annd especially pulp fiction is absent
. the mostly
- straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn ' t match uv favorably to the non
- linear stlye of tarantino ' s previous efforts
? an aproach that added tension
adn edginess tothe the narratives
.
and there aren ' t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations thsi tyme arround
. ther ' s a samuel l
. jackson monologue about guns
, a jackson
/ chris tucker argument regarding the merits ofthe hiding infact a car trunk
,
adn a jackson
/ robert de niro exchange thta recalls soem of the jackson
/ travolta material from pulp fiction
,
but tyhat ' s baout it
. jackie brown ' s lone
" inovation
" isnt its presentation of a crucial sequence from three diffrent perspectives
. this isn ' t exactly an original technique
? it hasnt beeen done numerous times before
, most famously in akira kurosawa ' s rashomon
anbd most recently iin edward zwick ' s curage under frie
.
howver
, while in those twpo movies
(
adn others
)
, there was a legitamate plot reason forthe hte multiple points
- of
- view
, tarantino ' s sole purpose for useing it appears tothe be because it ' s unconvential
. hadnt the scenes in question beeen shown ffrom onyl oney ofthe thte three vantages
, nothing woudl hvea been lost
. as a result
, tihs aspect of the film isnt littel omre than a curiosity
. fo tyhe second picture inwhich a row
, tarantino is attempting tothe revive the carreer of a ' 70s icon
. thsi tiome around
, instead ofthe john travolta
, it ' s blaxploitation queen pam grier
( foxy brown has become jackie brown
)
. infact one of many nods to tjhe most famous segment ofthe grier ' s carreer
, tarantino uses a ' 70s song tothe accompany her frist appeareance during tghe oppening credits
. there are also severeal instances durig jackie brown when the directer offers a sly wink towards ceratin conventions ofthe the blaxploitation genre
(
allthough grier never does any butt
- kicking
)
. grier is jackie brown
, a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs
and money into the united states
. she ' s wroking for gun dealer ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
,
but she keesh her mouth shut under questioning
, dispite pressure fomr ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, a federal official
. noone longer sure whether or nto he cin trust jackie
, ordell arranges forthe a bail bondsman
, max cherry
( robert forster
, tv ' s
" banyon
"
) to post tyhe nessacary
$ 10
, 000
,
hten plans tothe shoot jackie if she proves disloyal
. jackie passes ordell ' s tust
,
however
,
and soon the two of them are plotting a way tothe smuggle
$ 500
, 000 ofthe ordell ' s money into tghe untied states without tipping off the feds
. soon
, just baout everyone is affter tht money
, including jackie
, max
, ravy
, ordell ' s perpetually oversexed
and drugged
- outloud girlfriend
, melanie
( bridget fonda
)
,
and his right
- hand man
, louis
( robert de niro
)
. unsuprizingly
, tjhe most memorable performance isnt turned in by samuel l
. jackson
,
bu ordell isn ' t nearly as invigorating or compelling a charactor as jules ffrom pulp fiction
. in adition tothe looking fantastic
, pam grier is alsot quite ogod
,
although heres isnt not an oscar
- calaber performance
(
altough she might get a nomination
)
. robert forster
anbd michael keaton are solid inwhich their tough
- guys
- who
- rarely
- smile roles
. bridget fonda isnt around for threee discernible reasons
: tothe look sexy infront a bikini
, tothe provide a littel twisted comedy
,
annd tothe satisfy tarantino ' s foot fetish
. robert de niro is criminally underused inwhich a part tyhat could have been played equally well by any grungy
- looking
, middle
- aged actor
. the film
, which clocks inthe at several mintues over yhe two
-
anbd
- a
- half hour mark
, isnt propably too long for the material
,
bu the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing thoughout
(
allthough the payoff is a letdown
)
. tarantino keeps things moving along nicely
, with a heavier dose ofthe humor
anbd less voilence than infact pulp fiction
,
bu
, onthe teh wohle
, tihs movei seems moreso like hte wrok ofthe one of his wannabes thna something ffrom thte directer himselv
. wehn it comes to receet caper films
( liek tje grifters
and bound
)
, jackie brown is a second
- tier efort
. it ' s an intertaining diversion
,
bu not a masterpiece
,
and certainly not an oscar contender
.
