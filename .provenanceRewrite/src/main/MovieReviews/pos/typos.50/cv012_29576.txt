. review
: a small
but enchanting movei
,
" hearts in atlantis
" easily recalls another king
- inspired coming
- ofthe
- age film
,
" stand by me
"
, both inaddition terms ofthe its setting
anbd the sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" is a tribute tothe yhe magic ofthe childhood
, tothe those summers wehn the days seem neverending
,
and nothing means omre tahn your closest friends
. unlike
" stand by me
"
, htere is a supernatural element tothe
" hearts
"
, bu
although it is key to the plot
, it isnt not prominent
. like
" stand by me
"
, this isnt a mostly character
- driven film
,
annd as such it benifits greatly from superb casting
. yelchin isnt very ogod as bobby
, finding a ogod mix ofthe innosense
and resignation
. more splendid still is boorem
, whom i praised highly forthe her work inaddition
" allong came a spider
"
and who is simply radiant here as carol
.
annd
then there isnt hopkins
, who despite playing such a quiet
, introspective character as ted
, nonetheless commands our attension every timne he is onscreen
. less successful isnt davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish
. i also foudn it odd tyhat bobby
anbd carol ' s other firend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets up thge movei ' s flashback framing device
)
, is paid virtually noone attension
.
but hicks ' direction isnt lovely wihtout bieng cloying
,
anbd dispite the movie ' s general lack of insident
, it never ceases tothe weave its spll over the audience
.
