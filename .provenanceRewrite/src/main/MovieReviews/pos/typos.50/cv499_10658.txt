towords teh middle of
" thte sweet hereafter
,
" a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend
, careens through the steel guard rail
,
and dissapears out of sight
.
then
, in long shooted
, we see the vehicle slowy sliding across whta looks liuke a snow
- covered feeld
. it pauses for a moent before tjhe
" feeld
" cracks under the bus ' weight
adn the bright yellow vehichle vanishes inwhich an effortless moment
, a single smoothe second ofthe tyme
. compare that scene
, if you wiull
, tothe hte last eighty mintues ofthe
" titanic
,
" whn the behemoth sinks slowly
and spectacularly to its watery demise
,
adn ytou ' ll appretiate thte futility of comparing greatness in films
. the scene inthe
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" epitomizes all thta ' s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan ' s film
. it ' s not sensational
. we don ' t see thge inside ofthe the bus witht its payload of screaming
, terrified children bieng bloodied
anbd battered about
. thge bus doesn ' t explode or break inot a thousand tiny pieces
. it simply leaves hte road
adn silently slips beneath the surface ofthe a frozen lake
. it ' s a horrifing sequence made all the more so by calm
and distance
. useing a non
- linear approach to his narrative
, egoyan shifts bakc
adn foward in tiome
, connecting us with the inhabitants of the small brittish columbian twon who have beeen severly affected by htis tragedy
. fourteen childen died inthe tje accident
, leaving their parents
adn the town itself paralyzed with grief
. the catalist at tghe center of the film isnt ambulance chaser mitchell stephens
( a wonderfully moving peformance by ian holm
)
, who comes tothe sam dent tothe persuade tyhe townsfolk to engage infact a clas acation suit
. stephens
, who
" doesn ' t belive inwhich accidents
,
" functions as a concerned
, involved observer
, scribbling details in his notebook
and providing the parents iwth an opprotunity tothe reach soem kind of closure in tjhe harrowing aftermath
. hwile stephens ' inital drive may be finacial
( oen thrid of hte total settlement if he wins
)
, his involvment provides him mroe wtih an outlet tothe cmo to grips wiht his own loss
. his self
- destructive
, drug
- addicted daughter hasnt beeen inaddition
and outloud ofthe clinics
, halfway houses
and detox units forthe years
. egoyan ' s attention tothe detail
annd ability to establish mood are so impeccable thyat even the soudn of a kettle boiling resonates liek a plaintive cry
. mychael danna
, who composed thte shimmering music for
" the ice storm
,
" contibutes anohter memorable score that shivers
and tingles
. equally impressive is paul sarossy ' s cinematography
, capturing yhe imposing canadian mountainsides
anbd low
- hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors
-
- infact oney scene a bright wall calnedar serves to illuminate portions ofthe a room
.
" hte sweet hereafter
,
" while undeniably grim
, urges the viewer tothe grab onto life wih both hands
adn nto let go
. it ' s a film ofthe generous subtlety
and emotion
.
