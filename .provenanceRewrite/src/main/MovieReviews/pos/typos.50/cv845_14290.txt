whn i saw the trailer fo this film
, i laughed harder tahn i hadnt in qutie some timne
. while i was therfore pretty well psyched to see it
, i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good
. i ' m hapyp tothe say tath ther ' s something baout mary isnt nto one ofthe thsoe trailer let
- downs
. inthe fact
, watching this film wass qtuie a fine way to spend twpo housr
. yhe film opens uv in flashback tothe 1985
, at a high skool in cumberland
, rhode island
. ted stroehmann
( ben stiller
) is a social reject who cxan ' t seem to git a date to thge upcomming prom
, until he comes to the defense ofthe the mentally retarded warren
( w
. earl brown
)
, who ' s bieng harassed by noe ofthe tje school jocks
. it seems warren ' s sister is the campus queen
, mary jensen
( cameron diaz
)
, who is empressed witht ted ' s willingless to stand up fo her defenseless brother
, dispite a very rela chance ofthe getting beaten up
. mary tkaes an immdeiate liking tothe ted
and asks him tothe the prom
. ted was jsut flattered that she even knew his name
. unforetunately
, prom nigt isnt ruined when ted has an accident wiht his zipper
( at whihc eveyr man inspite the theather will wince
)
,
and is sent to the hospital
. fast forward tothe tyhe present
, where ted has cleaned himselv uv
, now writes for a magazine
,
bu hasnt weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obession of tjhe past 13 yersa
: mary
, whom he hasn ' t seen since that fateful day
. witht the help of his firend dom
( chris elliott
)
, ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy
( matt dillon
) tothe rtack down his onyl lveo
.
howver
, when pat finds mary
, he falls fo her too
,
and soon the both of them are competing fo her affections
. htere ' s something about mary isnt directed by bobby
and peter farrelly
, who brought us dumb
and dumber
and kingpin
. not exactlly inteligent comedies
, they are of tje gilty pleasure variety where you might not watn your firends or co
- workers tothe tihkn yuo hadnt such a great tiome watching them
. whith theri current film
, the farrelly brothers have come uv with something you ' ll nto onyl enjoy
,
but aslo won ' t mind talking about the next day at yhe water cooler
. thge film succeeds infact employing a preety wide range ofthe comedic styles
, ffrom hte subtle tothe hte ridiculous
,
adn hwile a fewd of yhe gags might be offensive to some
( seeming like residuals ffrom the farrelly brothers ' lsat twpo films
) htey almost all work
. i have nto seen many movies in the recent past tht shoot for the mark
annd so oftenly hit it dead onthe
. oney minute ytou ' ll be laughing at something ted syas
,
adn the next you ' ll be howling at tje sighth of a dog dragging him across yhe floor of mary ' s appartment
. oen of tjhe great things htis film hasnt going fo it is ben stiller
. he is perfectly casted iin thge role of ted
, because he ' s a guy who jsut looks awkward iin allmost eveyr situation
. ted ' s a nice fellow
and tries to do his best
,
bu forthe smoe reason or another thnigs just don ' t alwyas owrk out
. it ' s comical
,
bu aslo has thta kind ofthe appeal where you raelly feel forthe tyhe him
adn want him tothe cmo outloud on top
. actually
, i ' ve liked stiller sicne he did a short which aired onthe saterday ngiht live bakc in the mid
- eighties
. tjhe film was like a theatrical trailer fo a spoof on the toom cruise
/ paul newman film the color ofthe mone
, entitlied tghe hustler ofthe mony
. infront it
, stiller played wince
( nto vince
) who is taken under tjhe wing of an older man
( played by john mahoney
) to become a big
- timne bowling hustler
. it was parody at its finest
, more ofthe which showed up in the short
- lieved
" the ben stiller sohw
" onthe teh fox network in lite ' 92
/ eary ' 93
. like
" the critic
"
( which aired on abc
,
thne fox
)
, i still mourn taht sohw ' s cancellation
. cameron diaz isnt absolutely enchanting for most ofthe tghe film
, altho her charachter seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates
,
and smoe of thge qualities she looks for mkea mary look paper
- thin at times
.
however
, diaz puls teh role off iwth such panache
annd charm
, that yuo can still see why she ' s got guys jsut falling over each other tothe be witht her
. heck
, i even foudn her laff to be cute
, even
though i thougth it ws annoying during an appearence she made on the tonight show last week
. my girlfriend remarked thta matt dillon doesn ' t change
,
and ytou knwo
, it ' s raelly true
. he
adn ralph macchio must hang outloud or something
. maybe they live infact dick clark ' s pool hous
. anyway
, here ' s anyother ogod peice of casting
, as dillon slips beautifully into yhe role of the guy who tries tothe worm his way into mary ' s heart
. the supporting performances are also good
. chris elliott has a bigger part than inthe the abyss
( yes
, check it out next tyme
)
,
anbd less annoying than inthe cabin boy
. lin shae
, who plays mary ' s neighobr magda
(
and aslo appeared as thge landlady in kingpin
)
, provides soem ogod laughs
, especially in scenes with her benji
- liek dog
, whlch acts as the focal point forthe a few of hte funniest moments ofthe hte film
. lee evans
, as mary ' s freind tucker
, displays a flexability infront acting
and accents wich surprises
annd contributes tothe an interesting plot twist
. the farrelly brothers
and scriptwriters ed decter
annd john j
. strauss keep hte comedic pacing oging so that there aren ' t any noticebale times where thge film drags
. the only probelm i saw was their use of a cuple of musicians who provide seguoys between several key scenes
. tehy appear out ofthe nowhere
and atcually sing plot
- relavent informtion right towrad the camera
. it ' s a divice which was amusing for about three seconds when they oppened yhe film
. after that it got a little annoying
,
adn it ' s unfortunate that thsoe spots interrupt what owudl otherwise be a smoothe flow
. fortunatly
, filled whith sight gags
, humoruos lines
,
and solid comedic acting
, there ' s something baout mary wiull still have you laughing aftter you leave the theather
.
