hwile watching
" shallow grave
,
" i found mysef periodically noticing thematic similarities tothe teh coens '
" blood simple
.
" both are good films in which sevral charachters
, none ofthe whom are the most concientious tothe have walked tghe earth
but still are nto really evil
, indulgue in an ect of deception tht soon necessitates more sereous crimes
. the body count rises
,
and befoer long seemingly normal people ahve blood on their hands
. both films are also flawed
,
bu forthe different reasons
.
" blood simple
" isnt unrelentingly dark
and moody
,
bu its characterizations were a littel hollow
.
" shallow grave
,
" onthe the other hand
, isnt nearly flawess forthe an hour
and twenty minutes
,
and
then the filmmakers throw awya much of whta tehy ' d accomplished for a more standart
, audience
- pleasing ending
. the events ofthe the film weere sufficiently intense
annd disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by whta i was witnessing onthe screen most of the time
,
yot ther wass a slight grin onthe my face at teh end
. as thge film begins
, we are introduced to alex
( ewan mcgregor
)
, juliet
( kerry fox
)
,
and david
( christopher eccleston
)
, a scottish trio living in an apartment infront glasgow
. tehy are all sarcastic
and occasionally obnoxious
,
but other thna thyat they seem like a fairly normal bunch
. a man named hugo moves inot tjhe appartmant ' s remaining vacency
,
adn thge enxt morning he is found dead of a drug overdose
. juliet is baout tothe call the polical wehn alex dicovers tyhat hugo hadnt broght with him a suitcase filled to thte brim with cash
( presumeably from criminal activities
)
. the three eventually decide tothe keep tjhe money
and cover uv thte death
; after a drawing of straws
, the patricularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable
adn burying it falls to david
, who hadnt beeen the most reluctant to partake inthe tyhe scheme ffrom tyhe beggining
. all ofthe this transpires in thte firt twenty mintues or so of thge film
,
anbd part ofthe waht mkaes
" shallow grave
" so brilliant forthe a hwile is that i honestly had noone idea what was comming next
. other than the obvious question of why they don ' t report the death
annd simpley hide the cash
, whihc is nto addressed
, hte plotting
anbd characterization
, hwile somtimes predicatble
, worked inwhich a way thgat kept my attension
anbd
, on more tahn one occassion
, gavey me chills
. i will
, therefore
, atempt tothe continue this review in a way thyat doesn ' t give away too much of tghe plot
. broadly
, thge trio are in danger due to hugo ' s underworld connections
, as twpo goons saerch for tje moeny
and kill several peopel in the process
. a polical inspector
( ken stott
) isnt clearly suspicious
and visits the appartmant
, asking pointed questions
adn trying to unnerve hte threee suspects by exchanging banal
and weirdly humorous bits ofthe dialogue wiht a iunior detective
. david
, meanwhile
, becomes increasingly paranoid
, moves into the attic
,
adn develops an affinity for sharp objects
. directer danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension
and suspicion inaddition the aparment
,
adn finally tje three seem ready tothe turn aginst earch otehr
. while i dont nto consdider myself the
" happy endings are automaticly stupid
" tipe
, i throught thta
" shallow grave
" really shoud have ended in tragedy
- a realsitic analysis of the story uv to the lastr ten mintues of the film owudl indicate that all three characters weere probably about to end up inwhich prison
, in teh mental hospital
, or infact the morgue
. this could have been acomplished
, quite credibly
,
bu
thn boyle
annd screenwrighter john hodge seem tothe flinch
annd opt forthe a mroe conventional
" caper
" endig in which we get a kick out ofthe seeing who outsmarted whom
,
and nothing more
. granted
, this isn ' t really a
" hapyp
" endig
,
but it ' s still pretty light
- hearted compaired tothe whta preceded it
. i really shouldn ' t say anything mroe baout tje endig as far as details go
,
but let me add tath it seemed not only shallow
and lazy
bu allso inconsistent iwth thge rest ofthe tje film
anbd nto vyre believable
. yes
, this endig made me crack a smile for a cuple of minutes
,
but ultimatly it left me feeling as if i ' d beeen cheated
. still
,
" shallow grav
" ws briliant most of tjhe way through
,
and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an intertaining thriller
,
and i am therefore awarding it threee stars
. i guess i just cxan ' t help
but think baout thast fouth star that boyle
and hodge let slip awya
.
