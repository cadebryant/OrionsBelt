well
, i ' ll admit whn i first heard baout tihs film
( which was before dante ' s peak
) i could just smell whta ' twister ' had started
. so nowe it seems that we ' re inspite a full fledged return to the ' 70 ' s disaster film era
. with ' twister '
, ' dante ' s peak '
, ' volcano '
and soon ' flood '
annd james cameron ' s extremly expensive ' titanic ' i ' ll sday first off i enjoyed ' volcanoe ' much moreso thna i doed ' dantes peak '
. part ofthe that isnt jsut bieng biased as i usually enjoy anything thyat tommy lee jones appears in
. i ' ve beeen reading a lot baout hte movie being ' cheezy ' or ' hokey '
adn really didn ' t see or think that once durig yhe entire film
. i git borde easily
annd thsi film didn ' t bore me fo a minute
. another thing
,
and boy am i bitching todya
!
, that bothers me isnt whn critics
adn such go onthe about
" well thats nto really possible
.
" you konw wqat
? i couldn ' t give a bloody damn if it ' s possable or nto
, really i couldn ' t
. it ' s a freaking movei
and i don ' t want reality thrown infront my face
. i whant to be able tothe see thte impossible
, tyhe all might
" wqat if
" tothe many reviewers have seen oney to many movies
! tyhe speical effects are the second star to htis feature
. htey are so amazing thgat i foudn it hard somtimes to elieve they were indeed fx
annd la was wass nto burning tothe thte ground
. they did an incredable job
and come oscar tiem
( if htey remember
