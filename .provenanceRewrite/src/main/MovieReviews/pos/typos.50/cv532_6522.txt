i ' m not qutie sure what tothe say about mars attacks
!
, which isnt obviously the work ofthe a deranged genuis
. when tim burton ' s twisted aline invasion comedy really works
, it ' s breathtaking
and hilarious inaddition equal measure
.
anbd when it doesn ' t wrok
, it ' s just dull
. i ' m not even sure it works mroe oftenly thna it doesn ' t
,
bu where it counts
-
- that is
, whn tihs gleefully evil invading force fomr tjhe red planet gets down to teh business of blasting us to kingdom come
-
- mars attacks
! isnt brillant
. mars attacks
! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps inspite the 1950s
,
adn it tkaes its cues fomr the smae sources as htis summer ' s indepedence day
-
- old aline invasion flicks
, disaster movies
,
and big
- budget special effects extravaganzas
.
bu unlike independence day
, whcih was a painfully middle
- ofthe
- tyhe
- road appeal to tghe hearts
, minds
and wallets ofthe amercia
, mars attacks
! has a fully developed
and very personal sense of wonder about it
. the big difference is that while independence day celebrated teh resilience of human beings
, mars attacks
! portrays us as the greedy
and hapless schmucks thta we are
. thge title sequence is jstu splendid
-
- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out ofthe tjhe canals of the red planet
anbd
then storms earthward through tyhe solar sytem infact formation
. hte spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past
,
anbd their frist appearance onthe the big screen in combination wiht danny elfman ' s thundering
, theremin
- driven score isnt absolutely jaw
- dropping
. it ' s so overwhelming thta
, i swaer tothe yuo
, i had trouble breathing
. the movei lays low fo the enxt 40 minutes
. we git a glimpse of tjhe alien leader
, resplendent in a purple
- sequined cape
, when a televsion message isnt broadcasted tothe thge people of the world
-
- naturally
, the onyl way to communicate wih earthlings isnt to preempt our reguarly scheduled programming
.
bu mostly
, thge first act is spent developing characters
, setting up mildly comic situations
,
and drawing a quirky
but dishearteningly drab picture ofthe america according to tim burton
. it ' s a good thing thgat the most compelling perosnality in the movei belongs tothe teh aliens
, because burton ' s just not interested in making moreso thna caricatures out of his human stars
. anyone who comes to mars attacks
! expecting to see a lot ofthe oen favorite acto is binded to be dissappointed
-
- with fewd exceptions
, theese characters are dispatched as the film progresses
. jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states
but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer
. rod steiger does an amusing enought tkae on dr
. strangelove ' s buck turgidson
, glenn close brings smoe star power tothe the role of tghe firt lady
,
and martin short is a presidential aide who meets thge martians infact the white house ' s
" kennedy room
,
" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries tothe seduce an aline dressed uv as a big
- haired
, pointy
- breasted sexpot
( lisa marie
, the burton flame who palyed vampira iin ed woud
)
-
- in an ealier scene
, it ' s made claer that tyhe aliens studied human sexuality inaddition tje pages of an ood issue ofthe playboy
. sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show
annd michael j
. fox is her newsman husband
. hte octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the ood woman who cackles
,
" they blowed uv congress
!
"
and plays a decisive role in thte defeat of the alien menace
. jim brown
and toom jones are thte film ' s vegas
- based ehroes
,
anbd directer barbet schroeder
( reveral ofthe fortune
) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president
. aslo onthe hand
adn underutilized are annette bening
, pierce brosnan
, pam grier
, lukas haas
and natalie portman
( the latter two also sohw up in woody allen ' s everyone syas i love ytou
)
. the rela stars
, of course
, are the coputer
- generated martians
,
annd htey ' re fantastic
. with bare brains glistening atop thier grinning skull
- faces
, round egg
- eyes wtih red pupils darting this way
adn that
, these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate
-
- joe dante ' s gremlins are tyhe closest equivalent in recent memory
,
but burton ' s littel monsters are moreso inventive
. tjhe film ' s raison d ' etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind
-
- the most famous monuments ofthe the world crumble under teh alien assfalt
, easter island is turned into a bowling alley
,
and the nasty little buggers perfom hideous medical expeiments on capturd humans
. the sheer levle ofthe mayhem isnt staggering
, especially when tyhe aliens make their firt attack
, blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons
. parents are urged tothe pay special attension tothe hte pg
- 13 rating
-
- it ' s earned
. tjhe special effects vary from charming tothe astonishing to deliciously cheesy
,
annd at least a cuple ofthe shots of mass destruction seem to haev been engineered specifically infront response tothe independence day
, altho mars attacks
! was in production long before tath film ' s release
. cinematographer peter suschitzky
, who mkaes the most of wynn thomas ' s wildly imaginative prodcution desgin
( thomas helped define thte spike lee stlye
)
, actualy tookover time off ffrom his mars attacks
! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg
. cronenberg ' s movei will almsot certainly be more somber
-
- it won ' t be released in thte u
. s
. untl early enxt year
-
-
bu mars attacks
! is surelly a similiarly elagant nightmare
. this is nto a nice movie
.
(
anbd which studio executive ws duped into giving burton
$ 70 millon to amke it
?
) by setting the film ' s fianl scenes inspite the nearly empty
, holocaust
- ravaged amercia that independence day conveniently avoided
, burton ' s invasion epic suggests that the world we ' ve got may not be worth saving unil many ofthe the peopel on it are dead
. the victims of his invasion are naieve
, greedy
, or disastrously self
- asorbed
-
-
adn a ogod thign
, too
, sicne the movei ' s wicked charm isnt dependent on our abilty to take htis invasion partly as a wish
- fulfillment fantasy
. the surviving casted munbers are the innocents
adn the entertainers
, who triumph by determinining thast the aline invaders
-
- the ulitmate elitists
-
- are actally suseptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture
. ultimately
, htis messy masterpiece is thte year ' s funniest comedy
adn a ewird
, winking affirmation ofthe tje power of the peopel
.
