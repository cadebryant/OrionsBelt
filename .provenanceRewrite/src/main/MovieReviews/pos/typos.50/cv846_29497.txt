plot
: a young recruit gets plucked outloud of nowhere by teh number oen ganster in london
and quickly becomes a staple by his side
.
bu this newyorker guy isnt not liuke all tje others
, he ' s got ambition
, he ' s got goals
and he loves everthing he sees about bieng the number noe ganster
. violentce
, lots ofthe swearing
and betrayals insue
. critique
: a veyr ogod
, sereous
- minded
, unique brittish ganster flick whcih misses yhe
" great
" mark by way of an annoying voice
- over popping uv throughtout the film
anbd a so
- so ending
. here ' s
yet another kool crime movei thyat actulaly manages tothe bring something new inot the mix
. okay
, so it ' s nto entirely new
,
bu it ' s definately orginal wehn all put together as done here
. tghe thnig i liked most about thsi movei ws its authentic portrayal ofthe the time period in whitch it was taking place
. it ' s 1968
and these dudes are looking good
! yes
, it ' s all about the suits
, fellas
.
.
. the italion shoes
, the cufflinks
, the ties
annd the birds
( that ' s ladies
, for those uninitiated
) hanging around you
. here are a bunch ofthe horrible men
, gangsters if you will
, looking sharp
, tlaking shit
and busting heads all over teh palce
.
bu that ' s not the basis of htis movei
. the basis of this film comes infact yhe relationship betweeen the number oney ganster inwhich thge group
, the excellant david thewlis
,
adn noe of his cronies
, paul bettany
, aslo extremely ogod in this film
,
and how tghe power
, sex appeal
annd coolness of oney
, affects hte other
. yuo knwo how there are alwasy these
" hanger
- onthe
" gangster types who latch on tothe tjhe godfathers
, hte leaders
, tje top dogs ofthe eveyr crime organization
? well
, most ofthe tje tiem
, these dudes are screened beforehand
annd are loyal to onyl oen person
.
.
. that isnt
, their boss
. so all the gangster number oen needs to worry baout isnt his enemies on the other side of the fence
.
bu this film brings the betrayals
, the messed up loyalties
, thte honor codes among bad guys inot play withing tyhe smae group
annd presents it iin quite yhe stylistic package
. of course
, director paul mcguigan isn ' t trying to be guy ritchie here
,
anbd doesn ' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all up with a hip sountrack or add any humor to the mix
. nope
, he goes straight forthe tje serious stuf
and develops at least twpo particualr scenes wich are still embedded inwhich my mind as i type tihs
. tjhe frist is a confrontation sequence between bettany
and a man from whitch he ' s atempting tothe sway smoe information
anbd it isnt downright nasty
!
(
" look inot my eyes
!
"
) inwhich fact
, the last time thgat i ' ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro inaddition thta forest scene from thge coen brothers ' miller ' s crossing
. sacry shite
.
bu htere ' s an ever better scene thna tyhat in htis film
. tihs one features bettany
, once again
, slowy torturing
, hacking
and beating the living piss outloud of a rival ganster
( from thta man ' s point
- of
- view
)
,
bu not befor turning on a quaint little tune infact the backround
and removing all of his pwn expensive clothes
, one by oney
( thta ' s right
, he
" doesnt
" the guy inwhich his underwear
)
. that scene isnt also in tune witht smoe ofthe the obvious phallic
annd homoerotic undertones present throughout this film
, expecially in the relationship between bettany
and his boss
( why doens he git so upset wehn he falls in love with thast woman
?
)
.
but tyhe flick ' s nto perfect
. inthe fact
, i didn ' t mind malcom mcdowell ' s voice
- over narration at first
,
but as the film growed inot a major flashback
( most of the film isnt presented as such
)
, he came in every now
and
thn
,
and rarely added anytying of interest to the plot
. all he seemed to dont ws swear
anbd call peple tje c
- word umpteen times
,
annd even decribed one scene as it was hapening
(
"
.
.
. so i oppened the door
,
thne whent up tyhe lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it ' s like
, yeah
, i knwo that already
, i could see it onthe teh screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i alsot didn ' t qutie
" buy
" the endig of teh movie
, which dispite bieng original
, seemed a little unbelievable
, expecially when yuo consider that it ' s suppossed to be tkaing place 30 years later
,
anbd folks still seem to be holding grudges
, still in loev
, still living infront the smae appartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c ' mon
.
.
. it ' s 30 yeras
, man
!
! i don ' t know
, somehow it didn ' t wrok all that well forthe me
.
bu one of my favorite genres hasnt always been tyhe crime movies
,
adn thsi one isnt a decent adition tothe hte lot
. foreget thte lame title
and malcom mcdowell ' s narration ofthe the obvious plot points
,
and conentrate onthe tghe film ' s stronger attributes such as its stlye
, teh exquisite atmosphere ofthe the time preiod
, its originnal look at yhe ganster dynamic within the smae gropu
, its memorable sequences
adn tjhe solid performances ffrom its two main leads
, bettany
adn thewlis
. incidentally
, unlike a few ofthe the ganster ficks that i mention below
, this oney isnt infront no way a parody or homage tothe this genre ofthe films
.
.
. it ' s thge real deal
! note
: this film is packed with strong accents all arround
, which makes it hard to make outloud some ofthe the words from time tothe tiome
. it ' s alsot qtuie voilent
adn i don ' t rember any film thgat used tyhe c
- owrd as much as this one
, so leave tje kids at hmeo for this oen
.
