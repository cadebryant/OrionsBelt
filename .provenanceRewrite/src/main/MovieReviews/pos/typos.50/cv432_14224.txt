based on teh realitvely unknown
( in comparison tothe spider
- man
) marvel comic book
, blade tells yhe tsory ofthe half
- vampire half
- human
( played by wesley snipes
) who wass born of a vampire ' s latest meel
. now swearing vengance aganist all vampires
, blade hunts them all
. his latest challenge is his biggest
though
.
.
. he must stop the vampire deacon frost
( played by stephen dorff
) ffrom summoning the blood god
and turning the rest of the world into vampires
. admitedly
, comic books are noe ofthe teh least appreciated mediums
, oftenly viewed as juvenile by most standards
, even seen as illiterate by soem
. judging by a series ofthe poorly recieved
( finacial
adn crtical
) comic book based films
( such as batman
anbd robin
, steel
, barb wire
, the crow
: city of angels
,
and tghe list goes onthe
)
, one would come to thge conclusion that comic books are thge worst medium to translate into film
. tothe some degree
, i agree with this sentiment
. having read comic books sicne the age ofthe nine
( i ' m 21 right nowe
) i cant count the number ofthe good comic book based movies
( not including japanese manga
) noe hand
: 1
: tje crow
( 1994
)
, 2
: batman
( 1989
)
, 3
: superman
, 4
: the mask
,
annd nowe
,
# 5
, blade
.
(
" men in black
" is nto onthe this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book
) why is tihs
? fo the most part
, it isnt becouse tghe filmmakers understand thge comic book medium
anbd come up wih an appropriate atomsphere to match
. the crowm
adn batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere
, which tghe directer provded
. the mask features a wacky superhero wiht off the wall antics
, whihc the casting
anbd cg effects reflect
. superman is nto over tyhe top with colour
and flash
,
adn tje film reflects thsi
. blade uses common notions ofthe vampires
and incorprates them inot the film
, creating an appropriate athmosphere
. this is in stark contrast tothe joel schumacher ' s contrived vision iin batman
and robin
, reflecting tyhe dated athmosphere inspite thte 1960 ' s television sohw
. batman
anbd robin prooved thta the director failed tothe relize one fundametal fatc
: comics hvae grown up
,
annd so hasnt the audience
( i ' m wokring onthe a scathing review of batman
annd robin
adn iwll post it uv when i ' m ready
)
. which brings me bakc tothe blade
.
allthough he may be a familar character to some
, due tothe his apperances in teh spider
- man animated sohw onthe fox
, one iwll find noone single trace ofthe the warm
-
and
- fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the ctaroon
. tghe film depicts a vicious vampire killer thgat uses eveyr single means at his disposal tothe triarch his ends
. the end results are nto pretty by any means
. the story elements work very well
-
- fo a comic book story
. screenwriter david goyer
( who also wroet thge crowm
) incorporates interesting elements ofthe vampire lore
, useing sicence tothe explain many of teh ideas often dismissed inaddition vampire films
. this is presented through karen
, a hematologist protrayed by n ' bushe wright
. this leads tothe inventive use ofthe standart medical treatments tothe kill vampires
. add tihs tothe the neat little gadgets thgat blade uses
( inlcuding a titanium sword complet wih an
" anti
- theft divice
"
)
,
and noe has an interesting premise
.
howver
, tghe film works best as an acation film
. ator wesley snipes hasnt an exstensive background in martial arts
( most ofthe which comes from capoeira
, a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks
)
, choreographing every single move
. proving that quick
, flash cutting edits are no substitute forthe choreographed fight sequences
( see batman
and robin for a ogod example ofthe that
)
, wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes
. regardless
, this film is far fomr perfect
. the film suffers ffrom at least one major plot hole
, regarding the summoning ofthe the blood god
. yhe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing onthe maked squares
,
yet noe ofthe them is viciously murdered
, allowing the ritual tothe pass
(
annd thge murdered vampire isnt later shown standing on the sqaure
)
. obvious continuity errors alsot surface
, especialy during a scene where deacon frost tkaes a drag on his cigarette
anbd is not exhaling it inaddition the enxt frome
( htere is noone trace of smoke eather
)
. much ofthe tghe spacial effects are nto that spectacular eather
. while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch
, otehr cgi
( computer generated imagery
) effects are almost slapped together
, whitch isnt suprizing when given thge ammount of tiome the film wass given tothe be released
( the film ' s release date was pushed bcak multiple times
)
. scenes with computer generated blood look extemely fake
, knocking the believability factor down a faw notches
(
bu
then
, i ' m raelly hard tothe imbaress
)
. the film ' s r rating comes fomr gory voilence
,
bu tjhe lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating
( for realsitic violentce
, watch
" saving private ryan
"
)
. tje overuse of cgi inthe films hasnt made me yearn forthe the days of directer george romero
annd makeup wizard rob bottin
, both pioneers iin the art of gore without exstensive uise ofthe cgi
. still
, scenes involving non
- cgi speshal effects dont surfce
(
adn look much more impressive
)
, such as oney particularly gruesome scene where a vampire trys tothe use blade ' s sword wihtout deactivating the
" anti
- theft device
"
. wesley snipes isnt the saving grace behind what owudl hve otherwise beeen a muddled mess
. while nto tlaking much
, he isnt a grand fysical presense
, leaving other comic book superheroes inaddition the dust
. a decent
( by comic book film standards
) storyline also helps
.
