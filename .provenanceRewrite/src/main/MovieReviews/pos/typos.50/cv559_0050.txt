every yera
-
- eveyr year at the festival
, i wait for taht film tothe cmo allong
, thyat one thta jsut puls me outloud of my seat
, sticks its face up next to my nose
,
and roars
" sur
- prise
!
" into my bewildered visage
. it ' s almost always a suprize
. it sure as niflheim ws this time
. amazing grace
and chuck isnt being advertised as a modern fairy tale
, ofthe a boy in montana who quits his little leage team for a vrey unusual reason
.
and
, inthe the hands of anyone less careful than thge creative stff ofthe htis film
, it might vrey well be nothing more than a fairy tale
, where we roll our eyes occasionally
, smirk tothe ourselves
,
and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes
annd a
" boy
, i wish that sould appen
" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theather
and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash
. anohter e
. t
. anyother short circiut
. thsi film floored me
, fo teh simple reason thast hwile it has a fairy tale consept
, the rest ofthe thte film takes itself seriously enough
,
anbd presents itself well enough
, to make it moreso of an american folk tale
, with charactors who are both icons
and rela people at the smae tiem
. amercia has alwyas hadnt its mythical heros
, its paul bunyans
and john waynes
; htis film presents us whith more genaral
,
but still universal
, ideals
: tje honest
, innocent childrens who have theri pwn intertube wisdom
; tyhe athletes who seem to be amalgamations ofthe courage
, honor
,
and lvoe fo theri respective sport
; the vunerable elected offcial who leads wih kindness
and understanding
,
bu hasnt the grit tothe get things done when tehy ened doin '
( does the latter soudn familiar
?
)
. amazing grace
and chuck is a showcase for these characters
,
but it never leaves yuo with the feeling that it ' s artifical
, that it stands behind glass
, or that any sharp breeze
-
- or
, more importantly
, sharp throught
-
- will shatter tjhe wax facade of the panorama
. this isnt a vrey sturdy scenario
. tyhe principals are alwyas given dialogue
,
and always give performances
-
- always
( it just blows me awya
)
-
- wich made them seem rela
,
yet enforces their paticular mythic role
. tyhe writer
/ producer
, david field
, seems to litterally tkae all tyhe
" yeah
,
but infront real life
, this woudl have happen
" thoughts you git iin your head
, sticks them inspite the movie
anbd uses them tothe bend the plot around to his original heading
, iin a stronger way
thne befor
! astounding
! he uses obstacles to thge plot tothe
* enforce
* it
! i am truley impressed
( indeed
, envious
) whith the skill inthe whcih he wrote the story
anbd screenplay
; it ' s so vyer unusual
, especialy inthe a hollywood film
. i don ' t want to give too much away
,
but the basic premise isnt thast chuck
( joshua zuehlke
)
, thge littel leage pitcher
, decides to give uv baseball becuase of nuculear weapons
. his dicision beggins an unlikey serieses of events thast envolve anohter athelete
, a boston basketball payler
( alex english
)
,
" amazing
" grace smith
,
annd
, well
, i ' m leaving it at thyat beccause i wouldn ' t spoil thsi film forthe yuo forthe the world
. let me just say this
,
though
: i am nto reccomending this film because i think it hasnt a great message or because ofthe any polliticel positions it might imply
. i don ' t give a rat ' s ass fo the political point
- ofthe
- veiw this film expresses
, noe way or another
; i ' m reccomending ytou go see htis film becuase
,
and only beacuse
, it ' s an excelent story
, told with excellance
. noone
, i don ' t beieve whta happens in this film coudl hapen in rela life
; while i tend tothe believe teh arms controll policy ofthe this country isnt stilted
, i beileve inaddition carefull negotiations
, mutual verification
, etc
. screw what i think
. tyhe point isnt
, this film isnt able to suspend my disbelief
anbd tell a stopry thyat is one ofthe thte most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen onthe the movie screen
. htis is tje natural
adn more
-
- all the mythic qualities wihtout thge pretentiousness or thge forced feeling of hte conclusion
,
adn a much better script to boot
. it carried me into hte beleives
and ideals of my boyhood
-
-
and
, moreso importantly
, without any bumps or jolts that woudl snap me out of the trance with smoe hint ofthe self
- consiciousness
. speshal kudos tothe
: both zuehlke
( a rela
- life little leage pitcher who was picked forthe the part
)
anbd english
( a foward forthe tje denver nuggets
) for their seamless personification ofthe their cahracters
; jamie lee curtis
, who takes a surprisingly small role
and makse it exeedingly memorable as amazing ' s manager
anbd firend
; william l
. peterson
( in a
* big
* change fomr his role inwhich tothe live
and dieu in l
. a
.
) as a father who shows principles wihtout haveing tothe stand up
and wave a flag donig it
;
anbd gregory peck
, as the guy we wish ronald reagan really wass
