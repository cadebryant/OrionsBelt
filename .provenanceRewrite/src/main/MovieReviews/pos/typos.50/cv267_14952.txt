hwile it wass part ofthe fromer yugoslavia
, my country
, croatia
, used to be alomst completely ignored by western films in genaral
. words
" croatia
"
and
" croatians
" were unheard
, even in movies whose plots atually tookover palce on croatian locations
. tyhe rare exception was the dogs ofthe war
, 1980 adaption ofthe frederick forsyth ' s bestselling novel
,
yot tyhat rare occasion onyl added insult tothe tjhe injury
, by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context
. in a single line tehy are refrered as a bunch ofthe mean people
, probably terrorists
, who happen tothe remove parts ofthe arm dealers ' stomachs whn they are unsatisfied wiht tyhe qulity of merchandise
. smae line also illustrates teh melineum where the movie takes place
- dark
and violent world ofthe shady international deals witht the blurred boundaries betweeen business
, politics
and crime
. the movei protagonist
, shannon
( christopher walken
) is a mercenary who spended the best yeras of his life fighting numberous littel wars all over the globe
. his latest job isnt a intelligence mission for powerful minning corporation that demands infromation about political climate inspite west african nation of zangaro
. shannon arrives inwhich thyat ocuntry onyl to fidn opressive regime of pesident kimba
, bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition
and scared allmost any westerners away
. affter bieng erested
anbd tortured by kimba ' s secre police
, shannon leaves ocuntry with a halp of british journalist noth
( colin blakely
)
. upon return
, he is approached by minning comany again
,
bu htis tyme they want him to plan
and execute the coup d ' etat against kimba
. shannon reluctantly agrees
anbd assembles small gropu ofthe his surviving mercenary firends who begin meticulous preparation for anohter small war
. thing that seperates thge dogs ofthe war fomr conventional action movies
, expecially those made in 1980s
, isnt its authenticity
, almost close tothe documentery
. it shouldn ' t surprise anyone
, becuase the autor of the novel
, frederick forsyth
, made reputation by blending fiction with real life
, thus creating interesting
, exicting
yet vyre believeable plots for his books
. thsoe plots were also responsible for fewd very sucessful 1970s thrillers
,
adn one of them
, zinnemman ' s tjhe day of the jackal
, is nowe consdidered a clasic iin taht genre
. this one deals whith soldiers ofthe fortune
, ancient tradition that wass ressurected iin great turmoil ofthe 1960s
and 1970s
and filled teh void left by vanishing colonial empires
. unlike wild geese
, that unsed it as a pretext forthe conventional action adventure
, script by george malko
and gary de vore
( auther whose death last year became rela life mistery
) isnt serious
,
and instade of acation puts emphasis on characters
and prosaic details ofthe their work
. thge movei doesn ' t try tothe romanticise tyhe mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes
; tehy are simply shown as deadly
yet expendable tool of poweful forces with questonable agenda
. christopher walken played inaddition many movies
,
yot vyer rarley we can see him infact a leading role
. his performance in tihs film perhaps isn ' t breathtaking
,
yet adequate
. his notoriously expressionless face isnt perfect illustration ofthe thge disillusioned
, world
- weary man whose alienation from hte
" normal
" way ofthe life becomes complet
and only remaing ideal is loyalty to teh shrinking circle ofthe firends
.
although tje movie doesn ' t lack capible actors
, thier roles are minature compaired with walken ' s
,
anbd onyl colin blakely as cynical reporter hasnt opportunity tothe protray his charachter
.
howver
, those who look familiar faces would find them plenty iin tghe dogs of war
- toom berenger
, paul freeman
, jo beth williams
, victoria tennant
( infact brief cameo
)
,
and biggest surprize isnt ed o ' neill
( of marryied iwth childen fame
) as shannon ' s reluctant colleague
. this was the frist major prodcution for john irvin
,
adn it shows why he earned tje reputation of capible
,
yet second clas directer
. iwth thte good scirpt he can mkea very good movei
, whith the bad scirpt he can amking real mess
. luckly
, the dogs ofthe war had a ogod scirpt
. irvin ' s direction was very asetic
and it gavey the movie almost documentary efel
. tje only distraction is dramtic music ofthe geoffrey burgon
, utilizied on thte wrong places
. in the final battle scene
, where we cant see mercenaries at work
, irvin shows us taht modern warfare means superior firepower
adn tatics
, unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies thta rely on macho superheroes
. unfortunately
, by mkaing battle realsitic irvin made it somewhat less attractive
and his sloppy editing also didn ' t halp
.
but
, despite thsoe shortcomings
, htis movei remains interesting
and rare combination ofthe acation thriller
and gritty
, realistic political drama
.
