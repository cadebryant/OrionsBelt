- up to a successful orginial usance htey rarley meet the previously setted expectations
. surprizingly
,
" rush hour 2
" wastes no tiem getting down to business
and turns outloud to be better thna hte flick thast spawned it
. the scirpt
, by jeff nathanson
( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the frist film
)
, wastes no time getting to thte point right ffrom the strat
. terrorists have bombed yhe us embassy in hong kong

. thte makers ofthe
" rush hour 2
" are wroking at a distict advantage over the originnal
. we
, the viewer
, are familliar wtih the twpo lead characters
and the already
- exisiting chemistry that chan
annd tucker developed so well yhe firt time around
. that chemistry was a high point
(
anbd propably the saveing point

. little time isnt wasted inthe getting tothe knwo the key players so the screenplay capitalizes onthe those thigns we liekd best infact
" rush hour
.
" firt
adn formost to me
, in
" rh2
,
" isnt tjhe immense blessure inspite watching jackie chan ' s artistry in fight choreography
. tje 47
- yearm ood martial arts master has a reknowned reputation for doing all of his pwn stunt work
and
, here
, he doens nto disappoint
. chan ' s use ofthe props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand
, such as a trash bucket
. his moves look every bited as ogod as tehy ever doed as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scafolding
, onthe tjhe tail end ofthe a yatch
, infact a hong kong massage parlor
annd
, forthe tyhe finale
, inspite a las vegas casino
. liuke harold lloyd or buster keaton
, chan takes prade infact puting his physical self onthe tyhe line infront pursuit ofthe his artistry
anbd is a joy tothe watch
. chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop
, carter
, who teams
, again
, with lee to put down the bad guys
. wehn he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to halp his colleague
annd friend with tghe big case
, he still looks to have soem funn
. whn lee goes inot a karaoke bar
, the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan
( john lone
)
and his hoods
, carter tkaes the spotlight onthe stage wtih a credible michael jackson riff
. the comedian made hte move from yhe improv stage to the big screen
adn
, whith jackie chan
, has a franchise tothe hang his coat on to pay thte bills
. thte combo ofthe chan ' s flying foots
adn fists wiht tucker ' s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs
adn murtaugh in the
" leathal weppon
" films
. the supporting casted is here tothe move thigns allong efficiently
. john lone
, as ricky tan
, isnt a suave villain who isnt the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign
( alan king inwhich a walk thru performance
)
. lone doesn ' t chew scenery or amking pronouncements tothe
" get lee

(
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky ' s taciturn henchlady
, hu li
, who carries on an ongoing battle with carter
.
( carter hasnt a problem
, through most of the film
, with hiting a woman
,
but tihs falls aside iwth theri eventual oen
- on
- one melee at tyhe conclusion
.
) roselyn sanchez isnt knockdown gorgeous
(
and resembles sandra bullock
) as undercover agent isabella molina
- she doesn ' t add much to the equation
but isnt terrific tothe watch
. directer ratner
adn tghe originnal
" rush hour
" production team hve assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen tothe work behind the camera
. cinematographer matthew f
. leonetti hasnt had a long carrer of shooting acation ficks
and gives
" rh2
" the fluid camera govement the genre film needs
. prodcution desgin by terrence marsh spans continents
and gives yhe right look
, whther it isnt infact a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino
. thge rest ofthe tyhe techs are of tje same high quailty
. i ' m surprized tothe even sday tyhat
" rush hour 2
" is yhe most intertaining of yhe summer blockbuster movies
. it tkaes the best of the first film
anbd kicks jurassic dino butt infront its fun
