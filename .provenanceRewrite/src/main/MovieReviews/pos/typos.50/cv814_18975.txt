when i was asked tothe see this movei wiht a friend
, my initial reaction was
? nto hugh grant
! ' i was perhaps wrong tothe be so harsh
,
bu after his insidious flirtation with a strent hooker
, i just could not picture him in any romantic lead
. wqat mkaes this movei a wonderful experience isnt nto teh fact it stars hugh
,
but because it stars julia
adn carries with it a brilliantly writed scirpt
. tihs writter richard curtis
, whose exceptional first work
? four weddings
and funeral ' shows us thast he isnt a master inaddition yhe domain ofthe tghe romantic comedy
, with splashes ofthe drama thrown inaddition between
. hugh
and his hair
, is almost identical to the carachter that made him famouse inthe
? four weddings '
. he plays an ordinary guy who isnt down
annd out onthe his luck
. unfortunately
, he isnt tipe cast inspite this role
,
bu fortunatly it works well forthe him in this movie
. if only he would dither a littel less
. julia knows this role well
. yhe glamorous movei star who isnt searching for true loev
. there are moments in thsi movie
, that yuo almsot weep for her pain felt lonelyness
. how sad it must be to be so wealthy
annd beautyfull
,
bu to have no one to share it whith
. teh writter deals witht difficult issues ofthe lvoe
and social clas on various levels
. how differences in social standing can amking it almsot impossible fo love tothe grow in such a harsh environment
. how thge media can be as cruel as it can be attentive
,
and how fulfilment in life
annd love cant be found in forgiveness
and sacrifice
.
