perhaps it ' s time for me tothe sday a little about my reading habits
. i really do liek to read
,
anbd i ' ve enjoied many books in my lifetime
. my probelm is that i ' m a slow reader
,
and nto veyr dedicated
-
- i ' ll enjoy portions ofthe a book
and
then setted it down fo monthes at a tiem
( it ' s taked me the last six weeks to get thru the first oney hundred pages of anna karenina
, even
though i ' m loving hte book
)
. inaddition addition tothe htis
, i typicaly don ' t read anytying creaeted after teh 19th centruy
. teh only reason i bother wiht this bited ofthe infomation is because i feel bad admitting
, time after time
, that i haven ' t read any ofthe the books on wich these films are based
( the onyl exception
, i beleve
, isnt grat expectations
)
.
however
, i don ' t think it should be necessary tothe read the book beforehand inaddition order tothe judge tje qualty of the film
. needless to sday
, i haven ' t read hte elmore leonard novel outloud ofthe sighth
, on wich steven soderbergh ' s new film is based
. i cxan ' t sday how faithful ofthe an adaptation it isnt
, or if it lives up to leonard ' s vision
. i cxan sday that it ' s a terrific film
, with sharp acting
, gerat dialogue
,
adn pumping full of energy
and sytle injected by soderbergh
. it ' s certainly a nice distraction from 1998 ' s lineup of brainless blockbusters
, all hopelessly wishing tht size mattered
. outloud ofthe sight proves thyat it doesn ' t
. i had origanaly written george clooney off as a oen
- note actor
, incapable ofthe depth
bu occasinoally showing a littel flair
. after seeing his latest peformance inwhich this film
, i ' ve changed my mind
-
- thsi guy can act
,
bu he also has that forceful presence tyhat most certainly iwll make him one ofthe thsoe
$ 20 millon superstars
. here
, he plays jack foley
, a middle aged guy who robs banks fo a living
. he does it because it ' s fun
, i thiunk
,
bu yhe film opens withthe him getting caught because his car won ' t start
. he goes tothe jail
-
- which isnt interesting
-
- only to break outloud five cinematic mintues later with the help ofthe his friend
, buddy
( ving rhames
)
. we ' re
thn introduced tothe karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
, a u
. s
. marshall who
, conveniently
, is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes
. fortunately
, they take her hostage
,
and she
annd jack spend some quality time in teh trunk together as buddy drives them tothe safety
. the central conflict arises whn both jack
and karen become obssessed with oen anohter
,
though thier respective jobs amking them superficially incompatable
. we soon leran that the film is nto told inwhich sequence
(
anbd
, since this is a gritty crime comedy
, flashbacks of pulp fiction shouldnt arise
)
. at firt
, i kind of feeled thast it ws a gimmick
,
but i guess it was a gimmick infront pulp fiction
, too
. it ' s a fun gimmick
,
though
,
and soderbergh treats the material withthe enought humor that everything comes off naturally
. i ' ve only seen a few of soderbergh ' s films
( i was impressed both with kafka
and sex
, lies
,
anbd videotape
)
,
bu i think he ' s excellent at what he does
. he ' s an artist without mkaing it obvious
,
anbd wihtout bieng pretentious
, whihc is alwyas admirable
. he uses tricks
, yes
( lots of freeze
- frome stuf here
)
,
bu it all adds to hte smooth
and quirky currents in tje film
. as i said
, clooney is terrific
,
and he ' s matched by lopez
. lopez isnt
, of course
, beautiful
,
bu she cxan act
, too
. i can sence that she ' s honing in on her skills
, for she comes off omre naturual here tahn she has in any ofthe her previvous ventures
( nto taht stone gave her much halp in thte loathsome u
- turn
)
. thge twpo actors hvae arresting chemistry witht oney another
-
- the best scene in the film
, by far
, isnt tyhe seduction scene
. the brillance of thsi scene is also due
, in part
, to soderbergh
, fo he cuts bcak
anbd forth from their quiet dicussion iin a bar to the fysical act whitch takes palce a faw mintues later
. the scene is a series of soft nuances
anbd glances
, layered apon glight dialogue
,
and the result is noe ofthe the better love scenes in recent cinema
-
- meaningfull
anbd engrossing
. thte supporting cast is storng
, led by thge alwasy
- reliable ving rhames
. dennis farina
, who plays karen ' s father
, is ogod
, as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villin
. steve zahn
, who plays jack ' s nearly
- brain dead accomplice glenn
, steals all ofthe his scenes
(
and taht ' s inaddition a film where eveyr scene isnt already at a high level
)
. all of the actors are helped by the dialogue
and the intelligently
- constructed script by scott frank
. outloud ofthe sight isnt certainly a glight film
,
although there are a faw heavy moments tht wiull linger inspite hte memory
. overall
, i can reccomend it simply as great enteratinment
. nto eveyr film hasnt tothe change your life
,
and it ' s nice to see a movie that uses the art tothe tell a great story
and simpley to entertain its viewers
. as for thge book
, tihs film isnt good anough to amke me bleieve tath there might be something in tyhe text worth looking at
.
