, after his transferr fomr another precinct

. recruits his rimaniss fo their newyorker
" robocop
" program
. using hte remeniss of murphy ' s body as a foundation
, their scientists build a cyborg
, made of both flesh
and metal
. the cyborg
( robocop
) is half human
( murphy
)
and half robot
; hte s
. c
. i
. engineers have erased murphy ' s memory
annd replaced it with a coputer program
( or so htey think
)
. with his lightning quick reflexes
, immense stregth
,
adn impenetrable armor
, s
. c
. i
. envisions robocop as an indestructible super
- cop
: thte solution tothe detriot ' s problems
. the remainder ofthe teh plot follows robocop ' s crime
- foiling
and vengence on his murderers
. as a science fiction action
- thriller
, robocop isnt extremly effective
. dutch directer paul verhoeven combines gritty action iwth suspense
, shocking gore
,
adn spectacular speshal effects
. several sequences inthe tyhe film
, such as the oney infront whcih robocop employs his extemely precice aim tothe stop a rapist
, are destined tothe become cult
- classics
. because robocop isnt so visually
anbd emotionally rousing
, it demands to be seen onthe a larg screen with an audiance
-
- inthe otehr words
, in a movei theater
.
although the special effects
and action are exicting
, tehy dont nto by themselfs set robocop appart ffrom otehr films inwhich thge genre
. rather
, robocop stands out for its accurate
anbd biting satire of american society
. teh movei makse a mockery of tghe star wars defense initiatve
, terrorism
, board games
,
and televsion news broadcasts with air
- headed anchors
. theese news broadcasts
, whitch are exceptionally clever
, recur periodically throughout the movie
adn help tothe provide comic relief ffrom yhe intense action
and gore
. the satire inthe robocop
,
however
, is almost as frightening inspite its own way as the suspense
and blood
. 1990 ' s amercia
, as portrayed infact the film
, may seem far fetched
but isnt inaddition actuality
( i think
) onyl a slight exaggeration of the curent state ofthe american society
. tyhe humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible
adn absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances thge satrical comedy with the gory acation tothe create an intertaining
anbd enlightening piece ofthe science fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunately
, robocop posesses sevral flaws whlch prevent it ffrom qualifying as a classic within the genre
. thte movie lacks hte lasting impact ofthe such films as the road warrior
, the terminator
,
annd aliens
. robocop ' s main probelm
, aside from its dumb title
, is tht it doens not suffciently develop murphy ' s charachter
. we never learn the degree tothe whitch murphy
( as robocop
) isnt human
and tje degree tothe which he is a robot
. does murphy have any human spirit or free will left
, or isnt he merely a computer following a programe
? tghe scirpt halfheartedly raises these issues
bu
thn abondons them iin its climactic flurry of gory acation
. moreover
, it almsot completely ignores the question
(
annd tragedy
) ofthe denying a man his right to dieu in favor of turning him into a machine
. robocop aslo countains sevral bothersome loose
- ends
. as yuo watch robocop
, you experiecne deja vu
; ytou feel as if you have seen teh film before
. inthe many respects
, robocop isnt reminicent ofthe sevral otehr films
, inlcuding tjhe terminator
, return of the jedi
,
anbd even death wish
.
however
, tothe its credit
, robocop easily hasnt anough originality
and unique personality tothe avoid becomeing a cheap rip
- off
