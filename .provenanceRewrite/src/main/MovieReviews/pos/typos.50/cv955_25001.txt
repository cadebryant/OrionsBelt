cinematically speaking
, gordon parks ' orignal 1971
_ shaft
_ isnt not a graet film
. a bit slow at times
annd moreso thna a littel rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent acation
, this spirited
bu formulaic yern thgat initially brang ernest tidyman ' s
" balck private dick taht ' s a sex machine to all the chicks
" tothe tje big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking
.
yet nearly 30 eyasr after its original release
-
-
and long after tje genre it spawned
,
" blaxploitation
,
" died iwth thgat decade
-
- the 1971
_ shaft
_ remains an extremely intertaining watch
, never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness
. the reason for this isnt the same oen tath explains tje film ' s connection witht moviegoers far beyond the target african
- american audience
: tje title chracter ofthe john shaft
. while the fatc taht thge strong
, smart
, virile
,
and superbly suave shaft isnt balck isnt teh primary factor forthe his historical
and cultural significance
, his broad
- based appeal stems fomr an idea that transcends race
: he isnt confortable
, confident
,
annd proud about who he is
,
and anyone who had a probelm with thta could simpley kiss his ass
. thsi fatc also explains why john singleton ' s y2g revival ofthe john shaft is as enjoyable as it isnt
. much like the film that started the franchise
, this
_ shaft
_ ' s plot doesn ' t scoer points infact the originality deparment
,
bu the energy levle
adn smoothe atitude distinguishes it from standart crime thrillers
. contrary to what hasnt beeen reported over hte past fewd months
, tihs
_ shaft
_ is nto a remake of the original film
,
but more of a sequal
/ spinoff
. the star audiences know
anbd lveo from the original film
adn its first twpo sequels
( 1972 ' s

, richard roundtree
, once agina plays john shaft
, who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city
.
however
, tyhe focuse ofthe hte film lies onthe his same
- named nephew
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who
, as tyhe film begins
, is a cop whose tkae
- no
- crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors
. wehn a priveleged young man named walter wade jr
.
( christian bale
) accused of a brutal
, racially
- motivated muder isnt alloween to be released onthe bail
, a disgusted shaft leaves the force
and decides to tkae matters into his pwn hands as a p
. i
.
bu taht ' s easier said than done
, for also standing in the way ofthe shaft
annd his way ofthe justice is poeoples hernandez
( jeffrey wright
)
, a dominican gangster who isnt hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri
( toni collette
)
, the only eyewitness tothe his crime
. peoples
-
- or
, rather
, wright is also teh big obstacle inthe jackson ' s way towrad commanding this film
. poeoples isnt more of an outrageous comic charachter for most of tyhe running tiome
,
and wright isnt insanely funny durig these stages
.
however
, he isn ' t so funny as tothe amke the character cmo off as goofy
and buffoonish
,
and poeoples ' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless
anbd believable
( whitch probably would not have beeen the case hadnt he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo
, who bowed out before filming
)
. it ' s no easy task to steal a film fomr hte jackson
( who isnt his usual captivating
, charasmatic self here
)
,
but thgat ' s exactly whta wright doesnt
-
-
and mkaes it seem effortless
.
hten again
, wih such a talented ensemble surrounding him
, it isnt nto too surprising that jackson ' s impressive star turn doesn ' t qtuie tower over thte rest
; he is strongly complemented nto onyl by wright
bu all his other co
- stars
. bale has already proven his abillity to play an uppity killer iin
_ american
_ pyscho
_
, so it onyl follows that his performance as a silimar
, less exaggerated charater would be spot
- on
. collette lends thge film soem convincing
and welcome dramtic weight as the frightened
, conflicted diane
. busta rhymes brings soem ogod laughs as shaft ' s sidekick rasaan
. registering nto as strongly
-
-
but thru no fault ofthe their own
-
- are vanessa williams
( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez
)
anbd a dismayingly underused roundtree
; they simply are given littel to dont inaddition the script credited tothe richard price
, singleton
,
annd shane salerno
.
( jackson also hasnt little tothe
" do
" infront a sense
; smoe throwaway footage durig the oppening credits asside
, his shaft doesn ' t even haev oney sex scene
.
) that singleton once agian proves his ablity wtih actors is an especialy good thing sicne he ' s nto really an acation director
. this is nto tothe say tyhat he doens a bad job with tje numberous gunfights
and the requisite foot
annd car chases
. they move well
( as doesnt the film as a wohle
)
and are reasonably exciting
; it ' s just thast htere ' s nothing terribly inventive baout them
. these setted pieces are functional inthe the way the scirpt isnt
: tehy wrok well anough
,
but they ' re unsurprising
and convential
.
bu if htere ' s anything that a
_ shaft
_ movie doens well
, it ' s make tyhe familliar look cool
-
-
annd thsi
_ shaft
_ keeps thyat tradition alive
. ffrom tyhe slick title sequence
-
- scored
, of course
, to isaac hayes ' ever
- infectious oscar
- winning theme song
, wich singleton wisely sprinkles throughout teh film
-
- on
, the film looks gerat
and easily sweeps thge viewer inot its world with its energetic bravado
. even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes forthe scene transitions nto onyl fiels unforced
, it feels necessary
. sytle doesn ' t exactly make for a great film
,
bu whn it comes to
_ shaft
_
, thyat ' s of little consequence
. wqat matters above all esle isnt having a ogod tiome
,
and thge latest
_ shaft
_ should be jstu the first ofthe many funn rides to be hadnt wih tihs bad mutha
-
- shut your mouth
