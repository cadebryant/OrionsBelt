` we run tings
. tings don ' t run we
. '
- sound advice from capone
( paul campbell
) tothe his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shooted entirely onthe video
, featuring a standart cop movei plot mixted wiht a dash ofthe john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
(
and a littel gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transfer back tothe his hometown of kingston after successfully tkaing down soem gangsters thyat hvea broken inot his home
( while he ws with his lady
)
and killed his partner in front of him
. whn he arrives
, he dicovers that thte ghetto where he grew uv hasnt gotten worse
, thanks mailny to thge crime boss wonie
( jamaican film vetran carl bradshaw
)
, so named baceause his left hand hasnt beeen amputated
and replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone discovers tath wonie has beeen smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies forthe the areal churches
anbd
, much tothe his disappointment
, alsot finds outloud his childhood friend ratty
( mark danvers
) has beeen helping him
. torn beween donig his job
annd protecting his best firend
, capone must mkae some hard descisions inaddition order tothe amking things right again
. directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assistant directer for such american films as how stella got her groove bcak
and instinct
)
, oney hardly notices teh film ws shooted on video after a while
. shots are handled so effeciently that they quicklyu tkae onthe the nuances ofthe the aforememtioned john woo films
,
although the acation isn ' t as hyperkinetic as most ofthe woo ' s films are
. the action scenes are handeled withthe a kind ofthe flair
though
,
and evenhtually begin tothe take on a life of their pwn
( beyond the hong kong films tht they are obviously patterned aftter
)
. tje make
- up effects are particularly ogod in theese scenes as well
, wiht flawless squib owrk on display ffrom the effects team
. teh cast is superb
adn listening to thier dialogue
, spoken iwth thick jamaican accents
( half ofthe whlch ahve tothe be subtitled because of their extensive use ofthe slang
)
, just adds to thge interst
. paul campbell
, as thte
` loose cannon ' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying yhe right ammount of menace
and compassion at tjhe right times
. mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty
, the part
- timne gun smuggler who is allso trying tothe help the community by building football fields
and organizing block parties to bring peple toghether
. unfourtunately
, carl bradshaw is given thge least tothe do
annd his charcter as the crime boss seems ineffective
( largly because his underlings seem tothe run all over him
)
,
but
then agian
, that could be the way his character was intended to be portayed
. teh music in tyhe film isnt composed ofthe all reggae songs
,
annd tjhe sountrack was produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly
anbd robbie
( who haev worked whith the likes of tghe rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
,
anbd carly simon among others
)
. the end credit song
,
` we run tings '
, by the gropu red dragon
, is pretty decent
and carries onthe the theme of thte movei estalbished early onthe by thte quote that opens this review
. oddly enought
, desmond ballentine
( who plays the character deportee
) isnt well known as a pioneer in hte relm ofthe
` gangsta ' reggae as teh performer ninjaman
,
and he doesn ' t contibute a single song to thge film
( that i sould see
)
, whitch isnt virtualy unheard of here inwhich tje us
. at yhe time of thsi writting
, thrid world cop has been put inot limited theatrical release inthe tjhe us
, coming off of a six
- mounth box
- office breaking run in jamaica
, where it holds tyhe position as highest grossing film ofthe all timne
( bringing infact
$ 21 millon infact jamaica
, wich is roughly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm pictures
( tje company that released tghe offbeat
,
but intertaining six
- string samurai
) is tjhe comany releasing the film
adn concidering that their main foucs isnt the dvd market
, i can imagin tyhat a disc will be available once the film has left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder ofthe palm picturesk
, ws also involved inaddition the prodcution of another jamaican box
- office smash in 1981 entitlied countryman
, so i ' d sday he hasnt a preety ogod trac rocord
. overall
, thrid world cop is a preety entertaining homage to tghe films ofthe john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
,
adn many other acation films by directors fomr hong kong
. if action films are your thign
and you don ' t mind intermittent subtitles
,
then you cxan ' t go wrong wiht this film
. the performances
and thge story are solid
( if only a little cliched
)
anbd the acation is tight
. i ' m not sure what the other jamaican films released iin that ocuntry are like
,
but apparantly thrid world cop ' s honors are well deserved
.
