damn thsoe trailers
. hadnt it not been forthe thge advertising of thsi film
, which reveals far too much baout its contents
, i owudl have beeen glued to
` under the sand '
. as it is
, the film retains some value
, thanks tothe an excellent performance by charlotte rampling
,
anbd a more mature francois ozon inwhich thge directer ' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
)
anbd her husban jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge onthe hte beach
. she takes a nap hwile he goes for a swim
. wehn marie wakes up
, jean is nowhere to be found
. she contacts authorities
,
but tehy cant ' t find him either
. doed he disappear tothe start a newyorker life
? ws he killed by accident
? did he commit sucide
? marie still asks herself these questions a yearm later
,
anbd in order to move onthe withthe her life
, she must find soem answers
. it ' s a fine premise
,
anbd this little movie uses it to teh limitate
. the film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bited slow
,
bu relaxing
. it ' s a very visual storey
,
anbd you can preety much just sit back wihtout reading the subtitles
. tihs isnt mostly thanks tothe the excellant camera owrk by antoine heberle
and jeanne lapoirie
, who shooted the film in a dreamy haze
,
annd tghe lead performance by rampling
. rampling is so expressive iin her portrayal of marie
, ytou connect witht her character instantly
, dispite that she ' s delusional
. the scenes where she interacts with her husband
, who she still believes is alive
, are heartbreaking
. she can ' t qutie get over him
. htey ' ve been marryied fo twenty
- five years
. the otehr actors
, particualrly jacques nolot
, are exellent too
. the sex in the film isnt rether unneeded
,
but compared to ozon ' s
` criminal lovers '
, it ' s the disney channel
. likely tothe cause smoe dicussion afterwards
,
` under the sand ' is a fine movie goign experinece
. hwile it ' s hard tothe reccomend as entertainment
, it ' s a fine adult targetted baout how we deal with loss
. ozon seems tothe ask waht you woudl do
,
adn that ' s certainly a hard question to answer
.
