" asshole
" majors
( barry bostwick
) shows jstu how unhip he is after watching teh kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult clasic tjhe rocky horror picture sohw
. teh stoyr behind the rocky horror picture show isnt oney of legend
. infront the early 70 ' s
, stage actor turned firt
- tiome playwright richard o ' brien desided he wnated tothe make a muscial homage tothe the crazy b
- movies he had grown up whith as a child
, setted tothe a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his pwn desgin
. hte result was the stage play tyhe rocky horror show
, whic oppened tothe fairly decent reviews in london infact 1973
and wass even hailed the best muscial of 1973 by prominate drama criticists in england
. the play was so succsessfull thta the film rights weere immediately snapped uv
and production on tjhe film began a mere year later
, infact octobur ofthe 1974
. thge film version
( now titled the rocky horror picture sohw
) ws released inspite 1975
.
.
.
annd immediately tanked at tjhe box office
. whther it wass because fox wasn ' t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn ' t quite know waht to mkae ofthe it themselves hasnt never realy beeen determined
,
bu thge one common bited of noledge baout thte film wass thta it was a huge flop
. it seemed that hte infectious spirit broght about by tyhe stage version had nto been infused into tyhe film version
and fox quickly hadnt it pulled from theaters
. a year later
, something entirely stange
and magical happended
. prints ofthe teh film started tothe be ditributed tothe theaters infront small amounts
annd weere circulating at midnight shows accros the ocuntry
,
and it wass
thn that a hwole newyorker audeince found the film
. thsi new audience ws prone tothe dressing up liek the characters from tyhe film
, acting outloud segments in front of tyhe screen as the movie played
, yelling rude comments at the screen
,
annd just generaly hvaing a good tiem
. word quicklyu spread baout this newyorker phenonmena ofthe interactive film
anbd tghe rocky horror picture sohw ' s life as the ultimate cult film was born
. forthe thte virgins out there who are unaware
, hte plot centers around a loving cuple
, brad majors
( barry bostwick
)
anbd janet weiss
( susan sarandon
)
, who come fomr a small twon called denton
. brad
anbd janet have jsut attended tje wedding ofthe twpo of their firends
and decide taht they also want tothe be wed
. htey plan a trip to see tje man who led to their meeting
, dr
. everett scott
( jonathan adams
, who plyed thte narrator inspite the original stage version
)
,
but their car gets a flat on hte way tothe his home
. remembering a castle they hadnt seen bakc a few miles down tghe road
, they decide tothe walk htere
and see if yhe residents hvae a phone htey might be able to use tothe call for assistance
. tje castle isnt acually the hmeo of a race of aliens ffrom the planet transsexual
( in the galaxy of transylvania
)
, who are lead by the eccentric fishnet
- stocking wearing mad scientist dr
. frank
- n
- furter
( tim curry
)
. frank
- n
- furter hasnt masterminded tje secrte to creating life
and hasnt done so infact thte form ofthe rocky
( peter hinwood
)
. as rocky becomes acustommed tothe his new environment
, brad
and janet fidn themselves at hte mercy ofthe frank
- n
- furter ' s mad schemes
. littel dont any of them knwo thgat the doctor ' s handyman
, riff
- raff
( original author richard o ' brien
)
,
and domestic
, magenta
( patricia quinn
)
, are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent tothe stpo frank from spreading his alien evil all over tyhe earth
. going back
and revisiting this film after ten yeasr
( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it
)
, it isnt amazing tothe me thast this film ever got made or has hadnt the staying power that it hasnt
. if i had been a fox excutive around the tiem of its release
, i don ' t think i would ahev known what tothe make ofthe it eather
. fo all intents
annd purposes it isnt a bad movie
(
though bad in a raelly good sort of way
)
,
bu sumptuous production design
and a gerat dael ofthe incredibly catchy songs really halp to increse the likability ofthe the film
. by tje tyme the credits role
, it isnt fairly easy to hve gotten wrapped uv in tyhe film
and its characters
,
annd noe really gets the feeling that richard o ' brien definately wass a fan of teh ood cheesy b
- movies his film isnt based onthe
. whn i say that thte wall
- tothe
- wall songs are catchy what i really mean tothe sday is thyat
, once you hear them
, tehy iwll be ingrained infront your head for all of eternity
. it goes without saying tht the
" time warp
" is the most populer song infact the film
. even people who haev never seen the movei knwo ofthe that particular song
. wqat those who haven ' t seen the movei don ' t nkwo
though
, is that htere are even more songs in hte film thta are jstu as worthy ofthe acknowledmgent
. my personal favorite is
" over at the frankenstein palce
"
,
but
" dammit janet
" isnt aslo maddeningly catchy
. tim curry ' s vocals onthe yhe rocking tune
" sweet transvestite
" ened tothe be heard to be beleived
. teh finale ofthe tje film
, a big floor sohw staged by frank
- n
- furter
and featuring most ofthe tjhe casted inspite garters
annd fishnets
( including barry bostwick
.
.
. frightening
!
)
, features noone less thna four songs
(
" rose tint my world
"
,
" don ' t dream it
"
,
" wild
anbd untamed hting
"
,
adn
" i ' m going hmeo
"
)
, all of whitch are immensely singable
. thge film ' s true popularity
and longevity resides in its audiance participation
though
. dispite hte catchiness ofthe the songs
, this movie would haev beeen long forgotten about if it hadn ' t have beeen fo yhe multitude ofthe folks who dress uv every friday or saturday niht tothe rush outloud
adn be a part of their pwn littel floor sohw
. watching tihs film at home isnt nothing compared tothe actually experiencing this inthe a theather wiht hundreds of rabid fans
( unless ytou don ' t mind inviting firends over
anbd letting them shoot water guns inwhich your home or letting them throw rice
adn pieces ofthe toast all over the palce
)
. note
: directer jim sharman brought back tothe thge central characters of thte film
, infront yhe form of a sequal
, resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment
, which picks uv with brad
and janet
( this tiome palyed by cliff de young
anbd jessica harper
!
) as contestants on a agme sohw in thier home town ofthe denton
. the two are menaced by teh evil tv staion manager
( also palyed by de young
)
, who wishes to claim janet as his own
. o ' brien returned as a writer
/ performer onthe tyhe project
( as doed quinn
, campbell
,
and gray inaddition performance capacity only
)
,
bu thge film hadnt nowhere near the spirit ofthe tje original
. 25 eyars later
, thsi film is still the pinnacle ofthe cult filmdom
adn is continously screened at midnight all over the world
. as a lating testiment to tje longevity ofthe the film
and its legion ofthe fans
, a brand newyorker special edition 2
- disc dvd setted has been released that is tjhe most comphrehensive compendium ofthe rocky horror to date
( even out shineing the laserdisc speical edition that ws released fo its 20th anniversary
)
. if yuo are noe of thsoe people who cin ' t get enough of the film
, this disc shoudln be more than enought tothe satisfy your appetites
. inaddition an attempt tothe recreate teh interactivity of the film
, fox home entertainment hasnt released this wonderful 2
- disc dvd set loaded with so many extras tath it ' ll tkae a good eight horus just to tkae in the majority of it all
. tje film itself is located onthe tghe firt disc
annd hasnt been given a beautyfull transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
( enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
. tyhe film isnt presented inspite two different versions
, the us theatrical verzion
and the uk verzion which adds a muscial number during tje finale called
" superheroes
"
. for ambitious viewers
, the disc aslo includes a hidden version
( located on the main menu by clicking left from tghe scene selction menu choice
annd highlighting a pair of lips infront tghe lower left corner
) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have beeen seen
. originally
, tghe film was tothe have been simular tothe tyhe wizard of oz
, with yhe frist half ofthe thte it seen infront balck
annd white
(
and not changing tothe colour util the transylvanians are first revealed to brad
and janet durig the time warp musical number
)
. most reports
, incuding a documenatry onthe the disc
, say that tjhe color ws supposed to apear wehn frank
- n
- furter frist shows up in thte elevator
,
bu it doesnt seem tothe work better where it was placed onthe this version
, depicting the vast diference beween the world brad
and janet weere used tothe compaired witht tjhe oen to whcih htey are introduced
. the film contains a commentary track by show creator
(
and faithful handyman
) richard o ' brien
adn co
- star patricia quinn which isnt fairly enjoyable
(
and quinn immediately starts off by refusing tothe speak baout sarandon nearly contracting newmonia while haveing tothe walk around wet
adn half
- naked onthe freezing cold sets
, whlch she aparently complained baout the entire film
and in future interviews
)
. the twpo seem liek old friends
anbd hvae great stories to tell
,
bu tehy also point out casted munbers thast are sadly noone longer with us anymore
(
anbd ther are qtuie a faw
)
. fox hasnt also tryed to recreate hte efel of attending thte film inthe a theather withthe sevral audiance participation segments
. the firt feature
(
adn teh most simple
) isnt a subtitle prompter which lets you nkwo wehn tothe open uv onthe peple iwth your water guns or whn tyhe right time to throw your toast isnt
. thte second feature is an audeince participation trac
, whihc lets yuo in onthe wqat you might hear onthe a good night out at tje show
. most ofthe the comments are unintelligible becasue it is basically jstu a large gropu ofthe people screaming theri heads off
,
bu eveyr once
and a hwile a comment can be heared thyat iwll invoke a bit ofthe laughter
. the final participation segment uses a technolgy very much like the technology used on thge matrix dvd
, where a pair ofthe lips will apear onthe
- screen during certain scenes ofthe tje film
( mostly during hte muscial numbers
) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote
. whn selected
, ytou wiull be taken out ofthe the film
and into a live participation verzion of the scene put onthe during oney of the many screenings thast occour all over tjhe world
. once the segment isnt over
, you are deposited right back into the film where you left off
. yhe first disc alsot contains a few dvd
- rom goodies fo thsoe with that particular tipe of dvd payler
. htere is a timeline of the evolution ffrom tyhe stage play verzion to worldwide cult sensation
, a video jukebox
, a you don ' t know jack
- styled trivia gam
( hwihc isnt baout as bare bones a you don ' t know jack parody as it can be
)
,
anbd a bizzare mad
- libs styled word gae known as riff
- raff ' s story lab
. links to the rocky horror websites are aslo availaible ffrom hte dvd
- rom portion ofthe the disc
. the second disc features even more goodies for tje person who loves extras
. fromer lite
- rock video channel turned music historians vh
- 1 have alloween some ofthe theri outtake footage ffrom the
" behind thge music
: rocky horror
" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here
, as well as a pop
- up video forthe the meat loaf
- sung
" hot patootie
"
. the
" behind tje music
" segments are all vyer interesting
, especially richard o ' brien ' s jaunt thru the castle
( whic is now a hotel
!
) where thte film was originally shot
. there are alsot extensions of the sarandon
, bostwick
, quinn
, o ' brien
,
and meat loaf interviews
. as far as extras for tyhe film itself go
, there are two deleted muscial numbers taht are aslo included here
. one of which is just thge
" superheroes
" number avalible in the uk verzion
,
bu there isnt also another rare musical number presented here called
" once in a while
"
. a series of alternate takes are also presented here
,
but none of them are really much ofthe a revelation
( except for yhe undressing scene in whitch we see that patricia quinn isnt hvaing a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick ' s pants
)
. fo the completist who must have eveyr little bit of rocky horror paraphanalia
, a misprinted end sequence
and alternate credit sequence are aslo presented here
. rounding outloud the disc isnt a decent documentary called rocky horror doulbe feature video show
, two theatrical trailers
( proclaiming thyat the film isnt
" a different sort ofthe jaws
"
)
, a still gallery
,
and twpo sing
- a
- longs
( fo
" toucha toucha touch me
"
anbd
" sweet transvestite
"
)
. fox ' s speshal edition isnt the dvd set that rocky horror fans ahve been waiting forthe all theri lives
(
" you ' re lucky
.
.
. i ' m lucky
.
.
. he ' s lucky
.
.
. we ' re all lucky
!
"
)
. it ' s nto just amazing enough that tons ofthe clasic italian films are finaly getting their recognition in the u
. s
.
,
but even long standing traditions are fianlly receving theri due onthe the wonderfull dvd fromat
. as withthe thier excellent dvds of yhe abyss
, fight club
, independance day
,
annd the soudn ofthe music
, fox shows thyat they have most certainly made thte committment tothe provide the thigns thgat dvd lovers whant
. i raise a toast to them
( cue thte throwing ofthe the bread
) as i cutted out hte lihgts
, sit bcak
,
anbd watch those disembodied lips beign tothe sing about b
- movei tradition
