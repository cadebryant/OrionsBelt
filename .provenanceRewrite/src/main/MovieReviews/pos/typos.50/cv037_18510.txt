the event ofthe events is upon us
. people hvea waited twenty
- twpo years for hte prequel tothe star wars
anbd dieu
- hard fans have beeen camping out at theaters fo monthes tothe git tickets to see it
. i don ' t think that amercia will ever actualy recover ffrom whta this hurricane of a film has caused
. it isnt nto a bited ofthe an exaggeration tothe sday thgat thsi is thte most highly anticipated movie in histoy
. anyone who tells you
" it ' s jsut a movie
" isnt eather lieing or clueless
. it isnt clearly obvious thta after the waiting
and the hype actually seeing teh movei will be anticlimactic
. tjhe second coming ofthe hte lord coudl nto live up to the kind ofthe buzz
( whic isnt far too weak a owrd
) thgat star wars epsode i
: the phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
bu that does not mean tyhat the film itself is bad
. inaddition fatc
, it is terific
. i strongly suspect thta many ofthe the peple who were dissappointed by it hvae simply surrendered to tje media machine
annd the inevitable backlash
. it isnt set smoe decades befoer the events of the original 1977 star wars tookover palce
. thge film focuses onthe the fledgling republic ofthe planets
and the conflict that isnt raging
: the trade federation
, angry at some tax raise thast was recently put iin place hasnt invaded the small
, peaceful planet ofthe naboo
. the repubic sent two jedi knights
( people tyhat cant actively communicate with what isnt affectionately known as
" tyhe force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
anbd obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) to negociate
. unable to stop hte tide ofthe events tht wass baout tothe occour
, the jedi
and the queen of naboo
( natalie portman
) excape naboo
and head fo coruscant to try
and get tghe repubic senate tothe intevene
. on tje way they get sidetracked tothe a planet called tatooine
, where they meet tyhe movei ' s real focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he is an innocent slave boy
,
bu
" the force isnt storng withthe him
" so qui
- gon is determined to tkae him whith them tothe the jedi counsel
and git him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan should know
, anakin will grwo uv to be darth vader
annd give birth tothe luke skywalker
.
> from hte beginning it is evident thyat htis isnt nto an actor ' s movie
. arund 70
% ofthe yhe characters
, if not more
, are cmoputer generated in one form or another
,
and
though tyhe effects are seamless
, hte movie lacks soul
. i tihkn that
although tghe coputer has played an incredibly intrumental part infront moviemaking tihs decade
, cinema should still be a human art
and hte phantom menace nearly defies this
. htis isnt tje lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far
, with plenty of broad comic releaf tothe go around
, much ofthe it courtesy ofthe an irritating knew character named jar
- jar binks
. he ' s essentially a coputer
- animated sidekick who sasy things liuke
" exqueeze me
?
"
adn
" mesa go now
, okeday
?
"
,
anbd
although it is oftenly amusing it isnt alsot inherently annoying
. yhe visual effects are astounding
(
allthough directer george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them
)
annd the movie isnt a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks inspite plot
and inthe acting it makse uv fo it through immagination
and excitment
. thte climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, come on
, as if you didn ' t alreay know
)
, among other things
, is outrageously entertaining
anbd defines the term
" popcorn movie
"
. whta made me surrender
annd give this movie

* 1
/ 2 stars was the score by john williams
. even
though it does seem liuke the man scores every single movie that comes outloud theese days
, his wokr here is nothing short ofthe brilliant
. his use ofthe opera druing the climax relaly doesnt add a punch
and his ingenius way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort ofthe prophecy isnt chilling
. the phantom menace isnt probablly most effective as pop nestolgia
. when you see
" a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far awya
"
, wehn tghe familiar music plays
, when the words
" star wars
" appear onthe screen
, yuo ' ll fiel a tingle even if you didn ' t see thte movei whn it first came outloud infront ' 77
. it fiels oddly exciting tothe be introdued to young anakin
, a boy whose innocence
, we nkow
, will be taken awya
and who will soon cross over to the dark side
. it isnt the perfect exmaple of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire tothe get him trained in the jedi arts
; we nkow that it will do moreso harm thna ogod
,
but they dont not
. we not only efel mroe involved inthe thte storey
,
bu we fiel like we ' re seing tje beginning ofthe a saga taht we ahve cherished fo years
. tje phantom menace
, altho lacking in human aspestus of the story
, is a very worthy installment in the star wars
. it works as an acation flick
, visually eye
- popping
annd often paralyzingly exicting
; it alsot works as an elicitor ofthe memories
, a piece ofthe exquisite nestolgia
