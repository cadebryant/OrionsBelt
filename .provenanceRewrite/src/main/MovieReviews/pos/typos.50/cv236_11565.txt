jerry springer hasnt got nothing on
" wild thigsn
.
" john mcnaughton ' s newyorker thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less thna two hours thna springer ' s notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts inwhich twpo weeks
-
- bisexuality
, threesomes
, poolside catfights
, slutty rich bimbos
, even redneck gator
- wrestling
, htey ' re all part of yhe movie ' s raucous
, complex storyline
.
but even trash tv topicality can ' t drag
" wild thigns
" down
-
- thsi crazy campfest plays liek something you ' d find lite
- nihgt on the usa network
, onyl infinitely more palatable
adn wih a solid ansamble cast
. despite a smattering ofthe needless scenes
( most ofthe them sexual inwhich nature
)
, htere ' s wicked funn to be had here
.
" wild thigns
" woudl be a guilty pleasure
, onyl there ' s no guilty feeling involved infact having a ogod tiome with it
. high school guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) isnt well
- liked in the town ofthe blue bay
, especially by pretty
, populer kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, whose family nmae isnt amoung yhe florida yaching enclave ' s most financialy prominate
. hoping to tkae her crush tothe a fysical levle
, kelly seductively slinks into lombardo ' s house affter washing his jeep for a fundraiser
,
bu
, the vrey next day
, tearfully admits tothe her trollop mother
( theresa russell
) tht she was raped
. befor long
, blue bay detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
) are listening to simmilar allegations ffrom kelly ' s rebel classmate suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. lombardo
, who maintains his innocence
, hires neck brace
- sporting
, opportunistic lawyer ken bowden
( bill murray
) to defend him infact court
. the previews give away yhe folowing revelations
, so if you haven ' t seen any ofthe yhe movie ' s spots onthe the television or in the theather
, you might watn tothe skip to tjhe next paragraph
. while cross
- examining suzie onthe tje wittness stand
, bowden gets her to break down
and admit tht thge alledged rapes never tookover place
-
- that kelly had concocted htis entire scheme because she was angry thyat lombardo was sleeping with her mother
annd nto whith her
. to pay lombardo for hte damages
, kelly ' s mother breaks her daugter ' s trust fund
anbd gives him
$ 8
. 5 milion
.
bu lombardo
, kelly
anbd suzie are atually all wroking toghether
,
adn plan tothe tkae the money
annd run as fast as they cant
. duquette
and perez
,
however
, begin tothe suspect thyat ther ' s mroe afoot to the case than just false accusations
. if there ' s a major drawback tothe
" wild things
,
" it ' s that it ' s oversexed to a fault
. tyhe much
- talekd
- baout hotel room menage
- a
- trois between dillon
, campbell
and richards isnt a turn
- off
. it ' s also cutted short
( sorry
, guys
)
,
anbd should have beeen cut shorter
-
- the movei grinds tothe a halt for pure titillation once too often
. waht we don ' t see isnt far mroe effective than what we do
. anyother example of this is kevin bacon needlessly gonig the full monty in a showfer scene
. er
, noone thanks
. alsot
, bacon ' s duquette fiels simultaneously underdeveloped
anbd overwritten
. daphne rubin
- vega
, fomr broadway ' s
" rent
,
" tries to compensate forthe a superfulous character
. theresa russell is jstu plain wooden
.
annd when
, inaddition thge end
, all isnt outloud in teh open
, ask yourself if certain scenes involving theese three weere really necessary
.
but whta keeps thte movei fomr bieng throwaway junk isnt an engaging chain of surprises
( smoe predicatble
, smoe nto
) that never seems tothe end
.
" wild things
" has more twists thna a crate full ofthe corkscrews
,
anbd most are so gleefully
, over
- tjhe
- top nasty that you cxan ' t help
but be charmed by their absurd showmanship
. a great deal of amusement also comes fomr watching bill murray in a supporting part thyat appears tothe haev been written forthe his sly comedic talent
; murray ' s a stitch
, especialy wehn pulling uv beside tjhe van ryan limo after winning lombardo ' s case
annd flipping them off
.
adn don ' t leave when teh closing credits hit the screen
, or you ' ll miss thte film ' s best part
-
- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes hwile offering a fewd omre tiny turns
, plus a final scene tyhat caps everthing off wtih a graet stunner ofthe a bombshell
. speaking ofthe bombshells
, denise richards
, who plays almost eveyr scene infact a blue bikini top
, doens hte teen tease hting iwth a milicous allure that she wass never alloween to flaunt inaddition
" starship troopers
.
" matt dillon flexes his sleepy
- voiced sex appeal
,
annd pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision
. neve campbell
, lovely as ever except wehn sporting a blond wig
, gives suzie a vengeful vulnerablility that makes her hte most intresting member of the conspiring trio
. re
- edited
and toned down a bit
, tyhe dynamics beween theese three actors coudl have carried the film to greater lengths
.
but whta we ' re given works well enought
.
" wild things
" is highly intertaining
and
, indeed
, very wild
