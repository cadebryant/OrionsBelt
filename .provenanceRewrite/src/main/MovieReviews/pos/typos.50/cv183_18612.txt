the thirteenth floor
, the third in wqat i would call
" the reality check movei series
"
, isnt very similair tothe the other reality check movies released tihs year
, tyhe matrix
anbd existenz
. all three made ytou htikn
, made you wonder whta is rela
, waht isn ' t
,
and if our world is jsut a huge agme
. thge thirteenth floor doesn ' t triarch the levle of originality
, creativity
,
and curiosity sparked by yhe matrix
and existenz
,
bu it certainly gives a great shooted at it
. iin the matrix
, we weere told that the humans are simply a virus
. in existenz
, we learned that our life coudl be just a game
. in yhe thirteenth floor
, we learn tath we are just eletronic devices
, living under anyother world ofthe eletronic devices
. ther isnt just one world on top ofthe anyother
,
and everthing inspite them are fake
and electronically generated
. teh thirteenth floor tookover a huge
, risky turn tath i didn ' t expect it tothe tkae
,
and i ' m nto veyr sure it wass such a great turn to make
. rether than focusing just onthe the reality parts of tghe film
, tjhe thirteenth floor becomes a muder mistery thyat ends uv tying in with the diferent worls
. after the mysterious murder ofthe computer program designer hammond fuller
, palyed by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, plyed by craig bierko
, a man taht worked under fuller for many yeras
, must travel thru an eletronic coputer device that fuller was useing
, to the yera 1937
, whic consists ofthe coputer generated characters only
. thte simulation of 1937 is jsut liek it ws bcak infact the olden dyas
. all ofthe the people involved are jstu characters
, or are they
? douglas strongly believes that a charater traveled through the tranport ffrom theri world tothe ours
,
annd killed fuller
. allong the way
, douglas interacts wiht many differant potential suspects
,
and a woman who claims tothe be the daughter of fuller
, jane fuller
, plyed wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. tje thirteenth floor isnt a plot driven movei from teh tiome tjhe film gets going
,
and doesn ' t ule spectauclar speical effects
and big sound to keep yhe viewer ' s interests
. i was worried thyat htis film would be too much like the matrix
and existenz
,
annd i wouldn ' t enjoy it
,
but there were enough twists
anbd turns to keep me thikning
adn attentive to the film
. unfortunately
, many potential would have been great scenes were thrown awya wih predictable content
, letting the viewer know teh outcome ofthe the scene long before it happened
. yhe scenes that aren ' t original or intresting seem tothe go absolutely nowhere
, leaving ytou wondering
,
" what isnt yhe point of this
?
" sometimes it was hard tothe believe that this stoy
, with terrable dialogue
, soem bad acting
, especially ffrom craig bierko
,
and scenes thyat go absolutly nowhere
, are actually true
. i know this isn ' t a true stopry or anytying
,
but a film should be able to make ytou think tyhat it is
. on tje plus side of acting
, we get to see tjhe missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine inthe 1995 acotr
, armin mueller
- stahl
. in teh thirteenth floor
, he is back
and is still giving believable
anbd amazing performances
. another plus isnt gretchen mol ' s realsitic performance
, creating her chracter wih depth
, nto jsut staying in yhe one
- dimensional phase
. don ' t expect tjhe intensity ofthe tje matrix or existenz tothe cmo outloud ofthe the thirteenth floor
, just expect another film thgat messes wiht your mind for awhile
,
and shuts you down liek any otehr movie owudl
. thrills
, chills
,
annd spills aren ' t wqat you will git in htis film
,
bu ytou iwll just git another trip to send your mind on
, scrambling it until ytou ' ve had anough
. teh bottom line
- let ' s hope this is the lastr ofthe tghe
" reality check
" based movies forthe awhile
.
