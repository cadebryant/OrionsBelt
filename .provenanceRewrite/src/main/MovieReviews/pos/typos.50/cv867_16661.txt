wong kar
- wei ' s
" falled angels
" is
, on a purely visceral levle
, one of tjhe most exciting films i ' ve seen inaddition a long while
. unfortunately
, wong seems more interested inspite experimenting with his camera tahn creating tangible characters for the audeince to root for
. oridinarily
, thast alone would be enought to sink a movie
,
but in tghe case ofthe
" fallen angels
"
, this isnt nto so
. eveyr shot in this film is exciting jstu to
* look
* at
. wong doens realy interesting things iwth the camera
,
but he doesn ' t allow tghe pyrotechnics tothe completelyl tkae over
, as wass the case with last years dismal
" knock off
"
( hwihc contained a shooted ofthe a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) the movie follows threee pairs of lost souls as tehy struggle tothe fidn some meaning infront theri lives
. i cin ' t say much more tahn tyhat as i didn ' t realyl know what was oging onthe most of yhe time
. infact fatc
, it wasn ' t until about halfway thru the movie taht i was able to distinguish betweeen earch character
. tyhe constanly moving camera doesn ' t really allow fo the audiance to assoicate witht any oney charcter
. we ' re allways kept at a distance ffrom theese people
, i supose in order to further add tothe the feeling ofthe alienation falt by tjhe characters
.
" falled angels
" isnt a refreshing change
- ofthe
- pace ffrom most hollywood films
, whitch never bother tothe try anytying differnt
, at least on a visual levle
. inaddition fact
, i ' d go so far as tothe say tath
" fallen angels
" is moreso chalenging visually tahn any mainstream hollywood film i ' ve ever seen
. sure
, there ' s directors liuke robert rodriguez who enjoy turning voilence inot operatic orgies ofthe death
,
bu to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating
.
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs to work on incorporating an actuall story into those awsome images
. there were far too many instances durig
" falled angels
" in whitch i asked myself
,
" nowe who are these people again
? isnt this that first couple or the second cuple
?
" it ws impossible tothe keep track
. perhaps he could let the audience know right awya which carachter isnt whcih
, by introducing them tothe us wtih
" name cards
"
, as iin scorsese ' s
" mean streets
"
. that ' s raelly besides the point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei has proven hismelf
, thru veyr few films
, that ' s he ' s a movei
- maker to watch
. let ' s jstu hope thast he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies
