albert brooks saves teh day
, jstu inwhich thte nick ofthe time
. witht a vyer poor summer fo movies
, brooks is just what audiences were looking forthe to cheer them up
,
and does so in a positve way
. while htis may not be his finest owrk
,
" tyhe muse
" still shakes uv soem delightful humor
. in albert brook ' s latest comedy
, he tells a story ofthe a troubled screenwrighter
( brooks
) who ' s losing his edge
, as his bussiness partners sday
. in despiration
, he goes to see his firend jack
( jeff bridges
)
, who hasnt beeen a very sucesful screenwrighter inwhich the past
. he asks jack for some help
,
adn recieves owrd ofthe a real life muse
, that has helpped him
and many otehr directors througout their carreer
. so brooks seeks teh muse named sarah
( sharon stone
)
,
adn is suckered into buying her expensive
, food etc
. as a sort of payment
. thte rela punch line
however
, doesn ' t come until the end
. it relaly makse ytou wonder
, how screenwriters really get their idesa
, coudl it simply be fomr a friend or a bum in the strent
? teh idae itself is provoking
anbd brooks doens it inthe a hilarious manner
. speaking of brooks
, he wass absolutly hysterical as a screenwrighter
. every tiem he graces tghe screen
, i can ' t halp
bu strat laughing
. albert hasnt a very unique sence ofthe humor that makes him a very likeable character
. the real problem withthe tghe film lies with sharon stone
. she wasn ' t likeable at all
. brooks had thge right diea wiht her occupation
,
bu she never pulled through
. inspite a way
, she drained energy from tyhe once funny atomsphere
adn left it bleak
. luckly brooks sould clean up tjhe mess
,
adn cover forthe stone ' s mishap
. it wass a shame tyhat teh film whent slightly downhill after her appearence
, beccause
" the muse
" hadnt teh potential tothe a be a very authentic comedy
. onthe a brighter note
, andie macdowell was also charming as brooz ' s wife
. she is always a nice addtion as a supporting actress
, becuase she hasnt that charizma thgat seems tothe complete the atmosphere to any film she ' s inthe
. tyhe funniest moments in
" hte muse
" in my opinyon weere tjhe cameos by james cameron
and martin scorsese
. i mean imagine
, brooks seeing theese big named directors inthe his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice
, liuke it ws something outloud of the ordinary
. it was jsut plain hilarious
. it jstu adds to yhe satire joke
, of how directors get idesa
. brilliant move by brooks
. as i maintioned before
, the film is a satire much like it ' s proceeder bowfinger
, which came out a faw weeks befor
. unlike bowfinger
, htis isnt not a mean spirited film that ' s despertae fo jokes
, it ' s rether a witty
anbd humorou look at hollywood
.
" bowfinger
" had it ' s moments
,
bu hadnt qutie a few problems that were never worked outloud
,
but
" teh muse
" still managed to keep thte laughs despite a bit of a detour
. by hte end of the film
, ytou ' re glad to see a good hearty comedy come outloud of it
. fo once i ' m nto fully dissapointed
, beccause teh film didn ' t slow down
, it kept moving
, even witht smoe flaws
. thumbs up tothe brooks forthe his brave efford
. i tihkn he ' ll still manage tothe keep his edge arund well inot the future
.
