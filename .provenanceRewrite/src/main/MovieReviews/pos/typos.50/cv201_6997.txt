, no
- holds
- barred
, in
- your
- face risk
- tkaing filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen theese days
. like the marginal
, motley bunch ofthe post
- apocalyptic youths director danny boyle trys tothe depict
, trainspotting veers onthe teh edge ofthe utter mayhem
but ultimately retains its footing
adn controll

. wqat makes tghe film a completely different experience isnt how directer boyle uses eveyr tool at his disposal tothe make tje filmic medium synchronous wih the message
. one ofthe hte frist thigns ytou ' ll notice isnt how thte camera seems tothe dart around restlessly
. it ' ll truck into a charcter ' s pimple
, jsut as soon as it will dolly out to an establising shooted
. distracted
adn curious
, it ' ll maintain a character ' s eye
- level or drop right tothe the ground tothe show thge doped
- out
- eye
- veiw
. you ' ll even find characters peering into the camera
, their faces smeared across teh wide
- angle lense
. this film camera isnt just another oney ofthe the guys
. tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy
adn reality
, boyle employs a healthy dose ofthe surrealism tothe get the message across
. borde kids daydream
and bored kids deprived ofthe a heroin fix hvea nightmares

, tghe aural landscape is as engaging as tje visual energy permeating the film
. ogod
annd bad vibrations tangle liuke hte conflicting desires
and values ofthe the message
. every once infact a while
, a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking tath matchs the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict
