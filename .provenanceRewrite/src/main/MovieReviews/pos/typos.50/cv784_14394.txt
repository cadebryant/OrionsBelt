it ' s noone secret in tjhe motion picture industry that the relationship between a scirpt
annd teh actors involved oftenly makes or breaks a movie at thge box office
. a poorly
- written scirpt cant be bested by a superb acting corps
,
adn a well
- written piece cxan be mangled by a gropu ofthe amateurs
. inthe directing his latest acation
- comedy
, directer brett ratner
( mnoey talks
) takes a relatively medioker peice ofthe standup comedy
and turns it into a funny as all get
- outloud buddy cop movei
. in addition
, rush hour serves as a firt
- clas exemple of directing a movei wiht conservitive attitude
- a feature tht is sure to draw inwhich crowds ofthe all types
. the two lead names share equal screen time here
, mostly because htey spend it toghether
. jackie chan
, in his first completly american production
, makse an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts
. the otehr martial arts flick fomr a faw weeks ago
, knock off
, stands no chance agaisnt tyhe content of htis noe
. chan manages to amke eveyr fight scene exude grace
and poise
,
and there ' s noone dout that a large percentage ofthe video sales for htis movie will come ffrom viewers who couldn ' t believe theri eyes thte first tiome
. chris tucker
, onthe the oposite side
, relates a hillarious commedic approach whihc smoothes out tghe rough edges to chan ' s performance
. he works perfectly withthe the script
,
and it ' s quite likely he leant scribe jim kouf a hand with soem of his lines
. almost esential tothe thge acation genre
, yhe plot isnt nonexistent
. we ' re quickly intrduced tothe detective james carter
( tucker
) isnt a maverick officer fo the lapd
. cut foward tothe anohter scene where the daughter
( julia hsu
) of thge american chineese consul
( tzi ma
) isnt kidnapped by a gang of swarthy charactors
. thge fbi isnt quick to tyhe rescure
,
bu tyhe consul insists tyhat one of his men
, detective inspector lee
( chan
)
, be brought onthe the case tothe help
. teh fbi resists
,
but
thn requests that lapd send a man over tothe babysit the chineese detective
. it ' s here that carter
adn lee hook up
,
anbd thge twpo unwittingly solve the case while tghe fbi rushes in tothe back them uv
. rattner doesnt a fine job ofthe gonig the extra mile to get his movei tothe move a step up
,
but it doesn ' t quite reach tyhe top tier ofthe action
- comedies like lastr eyar ' s grosse pointe blank
. there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks alomst exculsivly tothe
,
anbd if nto fo thte commedic interactions between tucker
adn chan
, this might be a major drawback
. also
, soem supporting characters are almost entirely allong forthe the ride
,
and others are ther simpley tothe look menacing
.
however
, none gives a standoffish performance
anbd they mostly mesh inot thge background
. almsot every memeber of tjhe cast displays some reservation at noe point or anyother
- whther it ' s tucker ' s toned
- down routine or chan ' s tight rein on his action sequences
-
anbd tyhat contibutes greatly tothe this being a watchable movie forthe all types
. a recommendable visi to the theater
, indeed
.
