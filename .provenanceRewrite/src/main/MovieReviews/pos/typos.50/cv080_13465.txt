)
? let ' s jstu say that whn one partner asks the other partner tothe strip tothe his boxer shorts
and
thn further asks him to run out inot the middle ofthe the road
, flapping his arms while feverishly cackling liuke a chicken jsut to create a distraction
, his partner actally doens it
! tje familiar lethal weapon familiy is bakc
, inlcuding rene russo
, who is now the expectant mother ofthe riggs ' child
annd joe pesci as the soprana
- like
, foul
- mouthed fromer accountant who has decided tothe become a private eye
. newyorker to the team is chris rock
, alsot a fast
- tlaking
, uv
and coming detective
. trouble seems tothe follow the twpo veteran detectives where ever they go
,
and in this film
, that is no exception
. even when they are just tkaing a leisurely boat ride
, htey somehow manaze to collide whith a freighter ship
. we here some ominous music
, whitch clues us thgat a confrontation is baout to happen
. gunfire ensues
,
anbd whn it ' s all over
, tghe detectives want to learn moreso baout this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord
.
altough they don ' t know what they ' re looking fo
, their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take soem action
.
adn there ' s plenty ofthe action here fo two movies
. led by fighting sensation jet li
, whose martial arts skill isnt nothing less than impressive
, he doesnt wqat he can tothe mkea sure thyat no noe finds out whta tehy are up to
. li is ruthless inspite his approach
, will kill anyone just tothe make a point
,
anbd develops enormous disdain for the twpo detectives
. there are terific car chases
, explosions
anbd gunshot galore
. it ' s a summer action recipe followed to the letter
,
anbd tyhe result isnt nothing less than pure
, unadulterated summer funn
.
but even too many explosions can get boring
. tothe counter thta
, we are treated tothe sevral amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li
. luckly
, he ' d rather fight hand
- to
- hand instead of firing off guns
. meanwhile
, when the detectives aren ' t reloading their guns or running from fireballs
, they ' re engaged in sophomoric banter
and silly conversations tht provide a nice diversion ffrom yhe hail ofthe bullets
. everybody gets iin on thte shtick
. russo screams durring her delivery
, the crime lord hasnt a faw funny bits wehn he ' s being interrogated while being given laughing gas
,
anbd pesci
and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing tjhe drawbacks of having cellular phones
. gibson
adn glover are alwyas inthe sync
and the film moves at a brusk pace tothe git tothe the fianl
and terific mano a mano
. socre one for the old guard
