okay
, let me frist say
, this is a beavis
anbd butthead movei
. if ytou dont nto liuke beavis
and butthead
, dont not go tothe see tihs movei
!
!
!
!
!
howver
, if you dont liek them
, i recommened you git outloud right nowe
adn go see it
. tje movei starts off wtih tje boys wondering whta happened to their tv
. htey notice tath it has beeen stolen
annd they vow tothe find it
. this wind thier way through amercia searching fo dallas
( she is a woman
)
. tehy look for her beacuse as they are searching fo thge tv
, they find a drunk who whants them
" to dont
" his wief
. well
, of course they think he whants them tothe score wiht her wehn actually he wants them to kill her
.
and thte funn starts theri
. tihs movie isnt a mix of funny gags that anly beavis
annd butthead coudl pul off
. it is qality entertainment thgat only fan ofthe beavis
anbd butthead would enjoy
. i enjoied htis movei alot because mike judge knew how tothe keep pace
. even when tehy were crawling through tje dezert
and i thought tghe movei started to lag
, he manages to keep the laughs comming
. if you expecting changes ffrom the show keep looking
. thte smae charachter
, the same voices
, tje same everyting from thge show
and tath ' s what makse it ogod
. yuo might think with a movie fomr a tv show
, ytou can change a fewd thigns
. often times this spells diaster for films becuase the film makers veer away from waht made the show popular in teh first palce
