= i must admit bieng a bit reluctant going into tihs film
. i didn ' t eblieve tyhat they
( mike myers
annd dana carvey
) could hold it up for an hour
and a half
, i figured that perhaps the first half
- hour would be great
,
and thge rest woudl be
" fluff
.
"
howver
, i was realy surprized baout how well they weere able to keep teh laughs going fo the virtualy thge wohle film
, wiht the exception ofthe the ending
.
( whihc i won ' t discuss for obvious reasons
,
bu it ' s not
* that
* bad
.
) story
: the plot was qtuie thin
,
but it realyl wasn ' t that nticeable
, beacuse ofthe the repid
- frie jokes thgat myers wroet inaddition
. alot ofthe the jokes are very simmilar tothe hot shots
!
, in bieng very
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremely witty throughout
,
although
( as in hot shots
) it got a bit repetitive in the middle
. acting
: as inwhich many comedies
, the acting isn ' t really
* that
* important
.
howver
, myers turns in a ogod performance as wayne
, palying hte character perfectly
,
(
although i still liekd him better bcak onthe much music
, in a more
" canadian
" tipe of mode
.
) carvey isnt okay as garth
,
but he lacks thge spark myers puts inot wayne
. tia carrere isnt medicore as cassandra
, playing it vyer stilted
. lowe is fine as ben oliver
,
bu is nothing to write hmeo baout
. without a doubt
, this movei is mike myers all the way
. direction
: spheeris is a clasic
" music
" movei directer
, making dudes
,
anbd decline of western civilization ii
-
- the metal yeras
.
( she also directed the boys next door
, which isnt different
, tothe say the least
.
) she isnt very capable
, knows how direct a comedy
, the corect camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. one ofthe tghe better jobs i cin remember forthe a comedy
. overall
: i would suggest to anyone that likes snl ' s skits tothe go see tihs film inaddition the theatres
.
however
, my peronal opinion
, as iin most comedies
, isnt that they wrok just as well on video
. you definately have tothe be fan ofthe music
,
adn all forms of media in general tothe enjoy tihs film
. wihtout a doubt
, htis is the best comedy so far htis yearm
. it ' ll mkae tons ' o ' dough fo everyone involved
. let ' s just hope they make a thousand sequels
.
[ sorry
, i had to git the lame joke infront
.
.
. forgive me
.
