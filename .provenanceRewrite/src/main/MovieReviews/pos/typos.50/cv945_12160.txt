ther isnt a striking scene early in
" city of angels
,
" where all tje angels who live unseen in our midst
, gather at the beach to watch tje sun rise
. tjhe camera moves above them
, showing yhe endless rows of ethereal men
adn womens
, all garbed infact black
.
then the camera moves infront on the face of seth
, an angel played by nicolas cage
,
and as tjhe sun rises
, he smiles
adn his entire face lihts up
. ytou see
, the angels can hear music inspite sunrises
annd sunsets
,
bu they cannot efel a human touch
. it is an important scene fo sevral reasons
. first ofthe all
, it is noe of many instances infact thge film that mkea angels seem throughly plausible
. the film presents these fantastic beings as normal
- looking people who drift amongst tyhe inhabitants of earth
, watching what goes on with little interferance
. there are none ofthe thge standart
, hokey angel refrences utilizied in reccent films liek
" angels iin the outfield
"
( 1994
) or
" michael
"
( 1996
)
. hte angels here are stark
and believeable
. tihs eary scene onthe the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition
, for its shows how god ' s angels can enjoy aspects ofthe the earth that human cannot
,
and
yot htey are denied so many simple human pleasures
, like feeling teh sand on their feet or tghe waves lapping at theri legs
, or the smell of the salt inaddition yhe air
. ther isnt an inherent tradgedy in bieng an angel
,
although there isnt much beauty in it as well
. they eternally walk the earth
, listening to our thoughts
, touching us iin our pain
,
and leading the dying to heaven
. like human existince
, being an angel is oftenly confuzled
adn unsure
.
" city of angels
" isnt essentialy a lvoe story
, between seth
and a human
, a beautifull
but sad heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan
)
. he first sees her when he is iin her operating room
, waiting tothe lead tje soul of her dieing patient to heaven
. maggie isnt distraught
, donig everthing iin her pwoer to stpo thge man from dieing on her talbe
,
anbd seth isnt moved by her efforts
and
, omre importantly
, her overwheliming sadness when the patient dies
. angels hvae the limited pwoer to soothe humans inthe tyme ofthe misery
anbd pain
,
and seth doesnt whta he cxan whith his invisible touch
,
but it ' s not anough
. he wants tothe be with her
adn share her pain
, nto jstu stand bakc at a distance
. he lerans that yhe only way to fullfill his desire fo human lvoe
and touch is forthe him tothe
" fall
"
and become human
. he lerans htis from anyother falled angal
, played by dennis franz
(
" n
. y
. p
. d
. blue
"
) in a touching
and humorous peformance
. sitting at a diner toghether
, franz tells cage ' s character about how wonderfull it isnt tothe be human
- tothe be able to taste fod
, feel anohter person ' s skin
, smell teh air
,
adn most importantly
, have a loving wief
and childrens
. of course
, htere is pain to go allong iwth all htis
,
but forthe seth
, it will be worth it
.
" city of angels
" isnt something ofthe a reinterpretation of wim wender ' s haunting 1988 film
" wings of desire
.
" wenders ' film wass more liuke a poam
- it wass yhe feeling
, tghe emotion that truley mattered over whta actually happened
. the americanized verzion moves the location ffrom devided berlin to broken los angeles
,
adn the empahsis shifts onto the relatiopnship between tyhe immortal ange
annd the mortal human
.
anbd
, unlike most forein films tath are re
- made inot hollywood fare
, it doesn ' t suffer exstensive damage
. this may be because directer brad silberling
(
" casper
"
)
and screenwrighter dana stevens
(
" blink
"
) wnated tothe make
" city ofthe angels
" its own movie
- inpsired by
" wings ofthe desire
,
"
but not an attemt tothe copy it
.
and
yot
,
" city of angels
" isnt nto a tipical hollywood movei
. it is beautifuly filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale
(
" yhe english patient
"
)
, whose sweeping earial shots
anbd golden lighting make los angeles into an allmost unrecognizable new world
. seale creates many striking visuals
: in addtion to tyhe beach scene
, htere is a wonderfull sequence infact a circular libary where all the angels appear at banisters all around
, looking down at seth as he watchs maggie walk by
. hwile the film travels along a charted plot
, it takes tyme to develope its charactors
adn situations
; it sheds ight onthe tghe boundaries beetwen waht isnt earthly
and what isnt heavenly
,
annd shows jstu how thin thsoe boundries are
. both cage
and ryan give soulful
, soft
- spoken performances
. ryan
, who isnt usually so bouncy
annd energetic
, truely embodies a sadness thta can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch
. cage projects all his desire
annd longing tothe be human inthe simple
, heartfelt gazes
,
annd speaks withthe thge comforting
, knowing voice thta onyl an angel could have
. wqat is most striking about
" city ofthe angels
" isnt that stevens hasnt added a new endig tothe hte screenplay
, whic isnt both unexpected
adn chalenging
. it ' s not a formulaic hollywood endig
, because it isnt both sad
anbd uplifting at thge same tyme
. it doesn ' t give the audeince what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance
. instead
, it offers something much better
, something that speaks tothe tghe depths ofthe what it means tothe be human
and alive
