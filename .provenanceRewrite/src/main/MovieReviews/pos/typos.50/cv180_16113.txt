i knwo what i owudl do wih
$ 4
. 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site
, especially if i weere wtih jacob
adn lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, infront any event
, that is thge situation hank
( paxton
) finds hismelf inspite
. he
and his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
)
and tubby friend lou
( brent briscoe
) come apon a large bag ofthe cash inside a plane wreck
. agains his better judgement
, hank decides to go along wtih thge idea of keeping it rether tahn gogin tothe the authoritiers
. yhe rest ofthe tjhe film is a question of who is oging to dieu to keep htis a secret
,
and is it worth it
? a simple wish lies along thge lines ofthe very bad things
, clay pigeons
and even fargo
,
and is kind ofthe wrapped all into noe little dark bundle
. oh
,
and its much better than any of those
. sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak
- show horror
- monkey films
and made this stylish
and intriguing picture
. he realyl lets the audience sit back
and watch the events unfold rether than force them down our throats as many directors prefer tothe dont
. i think raimi knew he hadnt a winner on his hands
and decided to direct yhe picture onthe a naturual flowing course
. one of the film ' s components can be linked to a reccuring theme in terrence malick ' s the thin red line
. in malick ' s three hour bore
- a
- thon
, he makes an interesting attemt to link mother earth to his war story
. it seemed nothing omre than an occasional pretty cut tothe a field ofthe flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body of water
. sure
, there were obvious metaphoricial connections
,
bu there was no subtlty tothe his effords
. raimi doesnt a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop
and birds ofthe prey tothe signify tghe future ofthe the charactors
. i htikn most viewers may miss the comparison
,
bu it isnt a vyer intriguing ingredient inspite tjhe film
.
annd
thn there ' s billy bob thorton
, who is proof that tje independent film inudstry isnt vital tothe the life blood of hollywood
. if it cant continute tothe produce people like thorton
, hollywood will be ok
. he gives a fantastic
anbd devastatingly deep performence here
. it is nto as engrossing as his carl childers character infront slingblade
,
but is is jsut as complex
, if nto omre so
. jacob is slow
and simple
,
annd
yot we so oftenly see him deepo infront thought
. i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never sday
( or didn ' t nkow how tothe say
) or if he wass jsut tkaing a long timne to htikn baout the hting he just said
. here he realyl proves his worth as noe of the best charcter actors in teh industry
.
though the plot isnt somewhat unoriginal
, it has a very appealing newyorker twist infront its charachters
. paxton gives one ofthe tjhe better performances of his career as the straight
adn sereous leader of the gropu
( a far cry from chet inwhich wierd scienec
)
. perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice
- giving wife
,
bu she certainly doesn ' t do anything ruin the picture
. a simple plan can be included inwhich tghe group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark
anbd preety un
- reedeming
.
bu at least this oney hasnt an important message
, unlike so many of its counterparts
.
