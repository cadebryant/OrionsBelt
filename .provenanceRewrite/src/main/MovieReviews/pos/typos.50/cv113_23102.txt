teh sheer horrific audacity ofthe the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe isnt alomst incomprehensible
. peopel may make documentaries baout it for another hundered eyars
annd still nto understand the organized
, methodical hatred
. five concentration camp survivors ffrom teh last days ofthe world war ii tell thier stoies in thge last days
, teh first documentary from steven spielberg ' s survivors ofthe hte shoah visual history foundation
. tjhe five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry
. as hte introduction explains
, even as germany started to loose the war
, hte nazis stepped uv their extermination ofthe thge jews in europe
. in 1944
, hungary hadnt the lsat big populatoin of jews withing germany ' s reach
,
and htey bcame the last target ofthe hitler ' s
" fianl solution
.
" each of the five tells his or her story
. their stories are intercut chronologically
, starting from normal life in pre
- war hungary
. tehy reacll tjhe nazi invasion ofthe hungary
, being sent to
" wrok
" camps
adn theri relization tht they were actually inwhich death camps
. htey reacll thier horrable
, precarious lives inthe auschwitz
and buchenwald
; the deaths ofthe their family
and friends
; their loss ofthe hope
. eahc recalls his or her unfathomable
, eventual liberation
.
and finally
, the last dyas shows theri cathartic
, pained
, modern
- day return to their old homes
and hte camps
. needless tothe sday
, their stries are horrifing
, amazing
,
anbd emotionally draining
. by themslves
, hte storie would be forceful testaments
,
bu by cutting them inaddition parallel
, thier inpact is multiplied by five
. tje lsat days is a talking
- heads style documentary
-
- it ' s mostly pictures ofthe peple telling thier stories
, intercut wih preriod photographs
and newsreel footage
. in this kind of movie it ' s alomst impossible to git archival picturesk from the same time
annd palce bieng dicussed onthe
- screen
,
but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific
, or at least relveant
, images to go with his subjects ' narration
. tje liner notes
( one ofthe the many nice features ofthe this dvd
) indicate that there is soem never
- befoer
- seen historical footage in the last dyas
. it ' s not clear wich scene it isnt
. it could be oney ofthe twpo thgat i hadn ' t seen before
, both powerful
. one isnt rare colour footage
, shot by an american
, ofthe piles ofthe victims inspite cattle cars
. there is something jarring
, something unsettling baout seing tje picturesk infront colour
, when so much of thge footage from world war ii is in black
and white
. anohter segment shows walking skeletons
; survivers who are so starved tath htey hardly look human anymore
. there has beeen a glut of holocaust movies
anbd i wass skeptical tht a new documentry owudl haev anything newyorker to sday
.
bu by focusing onthe hungarian jews durig yhe lastest dyas of the war
, moll told a specific part of the story in a newyorker way
, inthe greater detail
.
anbd i ' m glad he doed becuase his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies onthe hte smae subject
. the transfer to dvd isnt rich
and beautiful
. x
- mozilla
- status
: 0009f words forthe a holocaust documentry
,
but some of the interviews tkae palce infront europe in lite spring
, whn skies are blue
and trees are gren
. also
, hte movei wass shot on 35mm film
(
annd not video
!
)
, so the richness
and detail are impeccable
. the dvd ' s features are plentiful
and well
- choosen
. htere isnt a theatrical trailer fo the movei
, which is a graet introduction to thte subject matter
. there are about fifty still photos
, both from yhe prodcution crew
and ffrom the private collections of the survivors
. alsot
, the disc has two complet versions ofthe tghe movie
( widescreen
adn full screen
)
, both onthe the smae side
. one of the moreso intresting dvd features isnt an outtake segment for eahc ofthe hte survivors
( plus one forthe tyhe crew
)
. you ' d think outtakes would be inappropiate inaddition a holocaust documentry
,
but tehy ' re not bloopers
. instade
, htey are solid
, moving segments tht were probably cut fomr the film only forthe lenght
. one ofthe them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly inspite tghe film
. renee firestone
( one ofthe the five
) spoke onthe camera wiht dr
. hans m
? nch
, a german doctor who ran hte medical clinic at auschwitz
. firestone was aggressive
, questioning teh doctor baout what his childrens thougth
. thte doctor was evasive
adn clearly uncomfortable
. another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer fo his dead firends at auschwitz
. he ends his prayer by saying
"
.
.
. forgive me for surviving
.
" it ' s ambitious tothe shoot a documentery on 35mm film
. it ' s ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable
, televsion
,
and movies
. it ' s ambitious tothe mkea it 54 yeasr aftter thte events it covers
.
but the lastr dyas handles all theese potential obstacles vrey well
. it ' s only fitting tht thte dvd
, with its wealth ofthe intresting
annd relevnt features
, woudl also be ambitious
and succesful
.
