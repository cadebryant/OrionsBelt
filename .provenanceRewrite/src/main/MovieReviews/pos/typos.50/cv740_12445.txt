a cuple of monthes ago
, when i frist downloaded tjhe face
/ off trailer ffrom the net
, my inital reaction wass a fourteen carrot gold ' yawn '
. followed swiftly by a press ofthe my computers delete key
, not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes ofthe prescious spoace onthe thsi piss
- poore trailer
.
hten i started reading the firt wave ofthe reviews from thge u
. s
.
.
.
.
. unique
.
.
. excelent
.
.
.
. must
- see
. well
, i throught still skeptical
, i supose i might as well go see it when it gets here
. ' here '
, ofthe course
, ws still threee monthes away
. i ' ll admit
, wehn i trotted off to see this film
, tyhe only john woo movei i had seen befoer wass hte fairly enjoyable
bu highly forgetable broken arrow
. i ' d heard good things about his previvous wrok with movies like hard boiled
,
but his films were definately nto on my must
- see list
. that
, let me tell you
, hasnt changed completely
. i knew tihs fact only five mintues into yhe film
, after the brilliantly shot
and acted oppening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet
. the acting thoughout the film isnt staggeringly good for an action flick
. seriously
. i ' ve never been a big john travolta fan
,
but he
, liek cage
, perfectly suited his role in teh movie
.
.
.
.
. sorry
, amke thyat ' roles ' in the movie
. even travolta ' s great performence
,
howver
, paled infront comparsion to cage ' s charachter portrayals
. my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out inspite compardre dietrich hassler ' s hideout
. half drugged outloud ofthe his mind
, he sist ther reclining bcak in a chair talking about his son ' s death fomr castor ' s prespective
-
" doesn ' t it just break your heart
.
" he mutters coldly
. now don ' t go thinking from tje previvous comments about briliant acting that thsi is a drama focused movei
- it ' s nto
. that ' s what realyl makse htis movei unique
. it ' s an action movei wtih brilliantly portrayed characters
.
.
.
.
. not a common mix at all
. suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie
though
.
.
.
.
. that ' s tghe onyl way to overlook hte fatc that travolta
annd cage frie arround 5671 rounds at eahc otehr
.
.
.
.
anbd never hit
. several acation scenes are jstu so well choreographed thta they jstu make wish tyhat you sould press ' rewind '
anbd watch it over agian
. thge part where archer
annd troy hve a stand off onthe eather side of a double
- sided mirror is just plain brilliant
. whilst cage ' s
and travolta ' s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies
, the lesser characters are just as intriguing
. joan allen
, who usually sticks to the straight drama movies
, plays her part perfectly as archer ' s long sufferring wief
. i liuke the fatc that her character didn ' t end uv toting a gun at the end ofthe the movei
.
.
. it owudl have wrecked her potrayal
. gina gershon was surprising tothe sday teh least as castor troy ' s mistreated girlfriend
.
.
.
.
. make that
* oen ofthe
* castor troy ' s mistreated girlfriends
. otehr movies owudl have used her chracter as jstu window dressing
.
.
. a sex object
,
bu instead her character is very storng
and indeepndent
. dominique swain
, who plays archer ' s daughter
, also doens a nice job
,
though her charater isnt not as explored as much as allen ' s or gershon ' s
. faults
? well
.
.
. there weere some i ahve tothe say
. first
, the movei ' s endig
, whilst being very good overall
, ws a bited too drawn out for it ' s pwn good
. after the two combatants begin duelling again affter the fianl boat kresh ytou can ' t help
but tihkn
-
" geez
, are yuo guys nuculear powered or whta
?
"
. ther were certian bits that weren ' t handled propperly
, like where archer appears safe
adn sound onthe solid ground aftter jumping off the converted oel platform
/ prision
- mroe explination here would have beeen nice
. overall
, tihs movie ws nto perfect
.
but i thougth it wass about as close as an acation movie has ever cameback tothe perfect
. many critics hvae claimed that this movie will chanage the way action movies are made
.
.
.
.
. i certainly hope so
.
