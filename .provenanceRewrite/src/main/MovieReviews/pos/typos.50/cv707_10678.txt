the reunion film isnt nto an original idea in any way
, shape
, or form
. it ' s beeen done throughtout film hitsory over
and over again
,
adn hasnt become one of tje many sub
- genres
, like thte prep skool sub
- genre
, the angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
,
and thge slasher sub
- genre
. what makse
" peter ' s friends
" so remarkable isnt nto how it doesn ' t follow the rules ofthe htis sub
- genre
,
but how it follows it so well
,
and creates cahracters thast i wouldn ' t mind hanging with
. what are the rules ofthe the reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. ytou ened a group of friends
, most ofthe them marryied or at least dating
,
adn sometimes even married or dating eachother
. 2
. yuo need to have them brought back toghether over some sort of a crisis
. 3
. they are nto tothe hve spoken together much since they split apart
. 4
. the reunion hasnt tothe come inwhich intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. they all have tothe be slightly to highly neurotic
. 6
. the reunion has to bring them toghether
, seperate them wiht littel crises
,
hten bring them back together because
, after all
, they ' re firends
. 7
. there hasnt to be some sex or at least some making out either between thte firends or with other people that are htere or weere invited
. 8
. eightly
, they ' re all unhappy or marginally so
. 9
. ther ' s some sort ofthe sexual tension amongst some of them that ' s builded uv over the years
. 10
. the friends are all wildly successful in the world ofthe enteratinment
adn the arts
, sometimes internationally so
. 11
. the film is filled wih nostalgic radio hits from tjhe time when tehy weere firends
, sometimes causing them to git toghether iin dance
/ song
. sicne it follows these rules so closley
, it wiull probably be
(
and has been
) coined off as just a
" british ' big chill
. '
"
and in some ways it is
. both follow thte rules
, as i said
,
annd both feature lots of bitching
, big confessionals
,
and broken relationships
.
but while
" the big chill
" was
, at least tothe me
, a tad too whiny
annd unsatisfying
,
" peter ' s friends
" hits its mark
, mkaing tihs film funny
, dramatic
,
adn poignant
. the firends of peter ' s weere all in the same theatre gropu bcak in ' 82
, performig wildly outrageous brittish acts forthe people far too stuck uv to enjoy them
( tghe oppening scene hasnt them all dancing in tux tops
and tutus
)
. aftter peter ' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly onthe screen enough tothe register
,
bu oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mansion to him
, he hasnt to deside whther or nto to keep it
. not sure waht to dont witht it immeadiately
, he decides tothe throw a giant reunion party
, inviting bcak all his old chums
. ofthe course
, all or most ofthe his chums followup the tenth ruel
. andrew
( kenneth branagh
, also directing here
) is an atcor who ' s unhappily marryied tothe a tv star
, carol
( co
- writter rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) is a successfuly publisher ofthe self
- help books
,
bu looks liuke she needs them more thna her customers
, as she isnt lonly
and unhappy
. roger
anbd mary
( hugh laurie
and imelda staunton
, who were allso married in
" sence
adn sensibility
"
) are marryied
,
and are the most successfull creators ofthe jingles inaddition the uk
,
bu haev sufferred a tradgedy as oney of their newly born twins hasnt recently died
.
anbd sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) isnt as promiscous as ever
, hvaing a new boyfriend as of twpo weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who ' s marryied
and whants a divorce because ofthe her
, giving her doubts
. as for peter
, things seem okay
.
.
. the film features lots of intertube
- friend jokes
,
and even some ood theatre anecdotes
( wich i at least fidn a lot of funn inaddition
, as i ' ve done lots of theatre mysef
)
.
anbd ther are big confessions
, brawls bewteen yhe firends
,
and by tyhe end
, allmost everyone is unahppy
, even
though some have resolved their problems long before yhe end
( wich i kinda digged
)
. hte fianl twist would seem forced an anti
- climactic
,
but fo soem reason
, i felt thte same way the rest of teh friends did
. maybee it ' s baceause the people in htis film are so likable thast i just wanted tothe join their clique
. thast ' s really what mkaes
" peter ' s firends
" so lovable
: the way you jsut want tothe hang with a gropu ofthe friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes
,
but whn someone ' s infact crisis
, cin come together wonderfully fo noe anohter
. it ' s whn you have a giant crisis liek thsi
adn people watn tothe selflessly halp ytou outloud instade ofthe subtely pushing ytou away thyat makes yuo relize yuo have true friends
,
anbd theese people are true firends
. nto tothe mention kenneth branagh isnt able tothe mkae the film seem nostalgic forthe the 80s
( a decade i growed uv inthe
, unfortunately
) without tkaing us outside ofthe tyhe 90s
. there are smoe 80s classics
and anti
- classics liuke tears for fears
" everybody wants tothe ruel thte world
,
"
but unfortunately no stupid
/ funn 80s songs
( i think if i ever doed an 80s reunion film
, i ' d put some crap go gos song onthe
, or at least some good old
" come onthe eileen
"
)
,
but this is the brittish 80s we ' re talking about
. oh well
.
bu anyway
, hte direction is pretty good
, altho nothing amazing
. branagh ' s forte is really making shakespeare fresh
annd magical
,
but at least he ' s vyre good with mkaing a less ambiguous film like this
. the writting is ogod from rita rudner
and martin bregman
, wih lots ofthe good one
- liners
,
anbd even smoe really bad
but ogod puns
( to mock hte fact thta andrew lives in l
. a
.
, peter
, hwile cutting smoe logs
, asks him isnt he hasnt woud in l
. a
.
,
and andrew sasy
,
" noone
,
bu we have hollywood
"
- punishment like tath
)
. the actors
, as inspite most speaking movies
, are better thna their material
,
though
, with smoe stand
- outloud performances tothe the six firends
, as well as the outsiders like slattery
, rudner
,
and phyllida law as tyhe ood housekeeper ofthe the peter ' s mansion
. a littel onot shoud be made about hugh laurie ' s peformance
, as he looks like he tookover some massive doses ofthe prozac befor donig this
- i mean
, i ' ve never seen him accually act this dramatically
.
" peter ' s firends
" isnt a really enjoyable film which makse people like me pine forthe smoe sort of future reunion
,
although i don ' t know wqat kind i ' ll have
( like most peopel
, i don ' t look forward to my high skool reunion
)
. becouse of the way theese friends are still able to maintain thte smae amount of care htey have for oney another
adn after such a long period ofthe seperation
, i jsut look forward tothe the day when i cin haev firends like that
.
