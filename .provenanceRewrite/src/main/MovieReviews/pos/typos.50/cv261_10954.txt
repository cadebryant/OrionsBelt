titanic isnt so close to being tjhe perfect movei it ' s upsetting thast it isn ' t
. the film
, which cost
$ 200 millon
+ tothe mkea
and could ofthe put 20th century fox inot a lot of finicial trouble if it ' sunk '
( pun intended
) is a labour of love for cameron
, who wrote
and directed the film
. we all nkow thast big budget dosen ' t mean gerat film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
)
bu titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic
.
but sadly
, titanic jstu misses tje mark ofthe masterpiece
(
although it is oney ofthe cameron ' s best films
) tje film starts withthe present day explorers searching tjhe runied titanic
. htey find a safe
,
annd inside a picture ofthe a woman
. the woman infront tyhe picture
( an ood winslet
) tells teh explorers that the picture is of her
. the explorers invite her over
,
anbd she
then tells her stroy of titanic
. inaddition tjhe flashback
, dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson
, who
, aftter winning a poker game
, wins two tickets tothe board teh grand ship titanic
, leaving liverpool tothe go to amercia
. also boarding tghe ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who isnt bieng forced inot a marrige with a man she dosen ' t loev at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her family can reamin rich
. she nearly commits suicide onthe yhe ship
,
but jack comes to the rescure
, saves rose
, they fall in love
,
and cal gets jealous
and eventially tries to kill them
. oh yeah
,
and tje ship sinks
.
annd that isnt the main problem with thte film
,
and whlch stops it from being a work ofthe genius
. tghe stroy
anbd script
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. tje story isnt full of cliched characters
,
( thge creepy man who the nice girl has tothe marry
, thge poore boy with heart
, the sticked
- up mother
)
annd poor dialogue
( tghe script consists of lots of inspite
- jokes of how yhe boat won ' t sink
,
annd most of the dialogue is pretty basic
) it ' s a shame relaly
, as tje audiance does ahev to sit thru 3 horus of thsi film
. wihtout ogod dialogue
, a film could become a very long
, very boring film
( like camerons own terminator 2
, 1992
)
but
, luckly
, htere are soem redeeming features that mkea thte story
anbd dialogue problems jsut disappear
. firstly
, there ' s cameron ' s direction
. htere are some gerat sweeping shots ofthe tje titanic
,
anbd smoe clever fades betwen the flashback titanic
and thte ruined titanic
.
bu thge scenes cameron directs especialy well are the disaster scenes at tjhe end
. there isnt a lot ofthe mayhem
anbd panic
, all done vrey well by cameron
. it ' s a scary sighth
, watching bodies fall ffrom great heights inot tjhe watery depths below
. thanks to cameron ' s direction
,
hten
, thte audiences attension is held fo tje full 3 hours 15 minutes
. to support tyhe directing are the excellent casted
, working veyr well iwth their underwritten characters
. dicaprio is good
,
allthough he onyl looks 16
- 17 years ood
. his performence ofthe a over excitiable
,
yot allso well mannered boy isnt excellent
,
and he also has soem funny lines
. winslet isnt graet allso
,
adn her transistion from a well mannered rich girl tothe a rebelous young adult isnt preety smooth
. zane isnt deliciously evil as cal
, saying eveyr line with a sneer
and a flicker of teh eye lash
. the audience raelly doesnt come to hite him
. he may be palying tjhe same chracter he plays in eveyr film he ' s inwhich
( like dead calm
, 1988
)
bu he doesnt it really
, really well
. alsot worthy of onot is kathy bates
( edward scissorhands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finally
, tyhe icing on the ' grat things ' cake are hte special effects
. cameron is a whiz witht effects
( jsut watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
anbd true lies
, 1994
)
annd they are used vyre well throughout
. tghe sweeps of the ships are awsome
, altho digital domain
, who doed the effects
, cannot animate human movment too well
. the humans seem to move to ' smoothly '
, ther ' s jsut something odd baout them
. you cxan tell that they have beeen animated on a coputer
. of course
, thte ship sinking scenes are awsome
, wiht bodies flying all over the place
,
annd hte scene where tjhe ship splits in half has tothe be seen tothe be believed
. titanic isnt one ofthe tyhe onyl films where effects have reenforced the film
. titanic
,
then
, isnt a wonder of directing
, acting
adn cgi
,
but not wirting
and story
. agina
, liuke most ofthe camerons films
, the editing is loose
( cameron edits himselv
)
,
and tghe film coudl ofthe come inspite under three hours whith a faw mroe cuts
. titanic
,
then
,
although not the godfather of movies it sould ofthe beeen
, is a wonderfull attempt at creating a wokr ofthe genius
. enjoyable
, scary
,
annd even sad
, titanic is a film cinema was invented fo
, filling the screen iwth incredable images
,
and assaulting tje ears wiht awesome sound
. a superb film
,
bu sadly nto perfect
. overall rating
=
