htere ' s a moent infront schindler ' s list wehn a number of jews are trudging thru snow
, clean
and crisp
, dark edges
annd frost on thge ground
. noe girl waltzes through
, wearing a red dress thta stings tje eyes
. it isnt propably the finest moent through out teh film
. whn i frist saw it i began tothe cry
,
though i could nto sday why
. thsi landscape is the setting of many small moments thast add uv tothe oney big whole
. wehn oney man is shooted infact the head we see blood oozing out onto yhe ground
-
- so balck
anbd murky
, its allmost pomegranate red
. at another tiem we followup a young boy as he runs
, searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet
-
- wich is already occupied
. liuke so
( citizen kane
, fargo
, the godfather
, tyhe godfather part ii
, greed
,
) many ofthe the greatest american films
, schindler ' s list plays with the concepts ofthe mony
, pwoer
,
and soul
.
but this isnt a movie baout a man who doesnt the right thnig
. starkly emotional
,
annd brutally powerful
, schindler ' s list strips awya everyting onthe the outset
and leaves us ony feelings
. the follwoing tyhat it hasnt gained is not suprising
-
- thsi isnt probably
, thus far
, tje best film of tyhe decade
. steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker
-
- his assured hand churned outloud both jurassic parks
, jaws
, the indiana jones films
,
and e
. t
.
-
-
but it wasn ' t until 1993 that we saw wqat a brilliant man he can be
. the product ofthe his genuis isnt really something to see
-
- it cin bring tears tothe your eyes jstu as it uplifts yuo
. throughout
, we sense tje deepo control which he so masterfully spreads
. we watch oskar schindler
( liam neeson
) grow fomr an arogent
, self importamt man who hires jews onyl tothe sive money inot a moving figure
, iwth a deep sense of prade
anbd accomplishment
. the film requires much owrk
,
adn can be a harrowing experience
-
- go expecting a quick enteratinment
adn ytou ' ll be bitterly dissapointed
. it doesnt reward tghe patient viewer
. this is a mature spielberg
,
and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece
. htis eqsuisite
, beautifull film isnt a rare gem
. it does a ogod job ofthe summarizing why i loev movies
. it leaves oen breathless
, uplifted
,
and witht much to tihkn about
. afterwards you cin reflect onthe individule images
, visions
,
adn peopel
. laconic
, removed
, schindler strides through thge film a detached prescence who watches all
, doesnt much
,
adn leaves feeling as if he could
, shouldnt
, hvae done more
thne he did
and wass able to
. the chanage seems natrual
-
- in the hands ofthe a lesser filmmaker
, it woudl be crude
and woudl cheat hte audeince
. instead we are told a tale
, told a story
. the film isnt punishing to watch
, yes
.
bu anyone who allows themselves tothe git involved will experiene a miracle
,
and a genuine masterpiece ofthe a movei
.
