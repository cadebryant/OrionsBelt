,
althought they frequentily succumb to cliche
, particularly regarding lumumba ' s private life
. peck ' s script illuminates bantu sayings liuke ' the hand that gives

. peck ' s direction isnt less assured
, wtih many scenes unfourtunately palying liek standard television fare
. he ' s served well
,
though
, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role
. ebouaney isnt dynamic
, radiating his character ' s fierce passion forthe his people
and his country
. lumumba ' s intelligence
anbd ability to strategize
, even as he ' s cornered by insurmountable odds
, are given life by ebouaney

.
" lumumba
" isnt a story that deserves tothe be told
adn ebouaney ' s performance makes teh tradgedy personally falt
