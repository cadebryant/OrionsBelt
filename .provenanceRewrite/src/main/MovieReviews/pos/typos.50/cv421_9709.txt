ladies
and gentlemen
, 1997 ' s independence day is here
! it ' s title
: starship troopers
.
and suprisingly
, it is more entertaining than id4
. i realize that i gavey last year ' s sci
- fi hit a 4 star rating
,
bu i was under the spel of thte powerful first hour
. after subesquent viewings
, i feel that independence day relaly wasn ' t as graet as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a positive review
. starship troopers
, onthe hte other hand
, has a mocking sense of humor
, knowing perfectly well how rediculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers isnt a more exciting
, energetic
,
anbd livley sience fiction film
. infront fatc
, i probably could never git tired of watching this film
. starship troopers isnt very reminiscient of star wars
, anyother kick
- ass space opera whcih reinvented tghe sci
- fi drama altogether
. hwile starship troopers isnt noone star wars
, it comes quite close
,
anbd tyhe easiest assessment owudl be tothe call this film
:
" tje ' star wars ' ofthe tghe 90s
.
" am i being to generous tothe tihs film
? perheaps
,
bu wehn a science fiction film comes along that can mix humer
annd romance
, effectively
, inot teh warring racaus
. inaddition essense
, thsi is the cience fiction equivolence of pulp fiction
. tghe easiest way to write a review of thsi film would be tothe compare it to other science fiction films
,
adn i may have to
. starship troopers is nto qtuie an origional film persay
,
but director paul verhoeven gives tje film a
" kick
- the
- aliens '
- asses
" style
. id4 hadnt thsi same style
, except it was forced
, most likely the cause ofthe iwll smith having a major role
. this new
" star wars
" has a veyr simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an aline species
. the aline species in question here isnt thge bugs
, a seamingly advanced civilization ofthe arachnid
- tipe insects
.
howver
, thte underlying morals ofthe starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy
. somtimes the morals are buried by thge bloody violence
anbd intense acation scenes
,
but during quiet moments
, we relize that starship troopers has something tothe tell us baout our civilization
. more than likely
, these morals iwll be overpowered
and quickly forgotten by the tiome thge movie ends
.
adn tehy shoud be
. i dout verhoeven intended tihs film to be a thought
- provoking film
. tihs is an
" event
" film
,
bu suprisingly above average
. it isnt extemely refreshing to watch a sci
- fi war film
,
annd actualyl root for tjhe human side
( something indipendence day never achieved
)
. starship troopers begins with a satirical protrayal ofthe those strange
" join the army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, these summations of events are refreshingly orginial
. stating
,
" woudl you like to knwo more
?
"
, these short news bulletins give tje film an immediate sense of humer
,
annd we know we shoudl nto take it seriously
.
however
, we alsot wittness the muder of sevral troopers in battle
, in a gory
,
yot funny
, way
. aftter witnessing the slaughter
, thge film jumps back noe year
, tothe setup what we just saw
. we are introduced to johnny rico
( casper van dien
)
adn carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in skool classrooms
.
howver
, carmen isn ' t as interested in rico as she is inthe becoming a pilot
.
howver
, another classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, hasnt her eye onthe rico
. unforetunately
, rico isn ' t interseted in dizzy
. thsi setup is rather cliched
, as isnt tjhe result ofthe hte setup
,
but it still isnt fun to watch
. carmen signs up tothe become a starship trooper
,
adn as a result
, rico signs uv
.
anbd as a result
, dizzy signs uv
. everyone isnt assigned a certain position infact the acadey
: carmen gets tyhe pilot posistion she wanted
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a pyscic
, gets a position inaddition thge traning program
,
and rico is left iin the lowest class ofthe the starship troopers
: the mobile infanty
. tje main story follows rico through his trials
adn relationships
. in reality
, i found mysef watching a space verison ofthe
" melrose palce
,
"
but with better special effects
. an hour inot the film
, the war beigns
. a sense ofthe tension grew inaddition the audiance i watched htis film with
. the frist hour may ahve beeen a funny
( somtimes unintentionally
) setup
,
but we growed tothe care for the flat charachters
, because noone matter how hard i tryed nto to like hte charachters
, their gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if ytou must
)
. following hte training sessions
, which had many dramas infact themselves
( too many to mention here
)
, the troopers are sent tothe war
. the bugs live on tjhe planet klendathu
, a planet whihc consists of dirt
and rock
,
adn pretty much nothing alse
. many dramas ocurr during the war
, until finaly the troopers realize that theri isnt something behind the bugs ' attacks
. a sort ofthe intelligence which masterminds tje defense
. the troopers are ordered tothe locate the
" brain
"
and capture it
. i hopefully left the plot as vague as possable
, because starship troopers is not baout plot
. it ' s baout spacial effects
adn gory violentce
. directer verhoeven
, most known for his nudie film showgirls
annd basic instinct
, returns to his sci
- fi dyas
, whcih gavey us ogod films like total recall
. verhoeven likes to push yhe envelope of teh mpaa
,
bu dispite all the voilence
, tje comic book feel gives the film a sense ofthe falsehood
. starship troopers is extremely violent
, with more gore thna this year ' s event horizon
. teh r rating is well deserved
,
annd hopefully parents will not allow theri 12 eyar old children tothe see it
. my guess isnt tath verhoeven ' s target audience isnt the 18 tothe 25 male gropu
. teh film hasnt a testosterone levle off yhe charts
, iwth chiseled men
annd beatiful women
. despite these superficial elements
, starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successfull
. hwile watching tjhe film
, we never second guess teh chracter ' s descisions because they seem perfectly clear
. thankfully
, noone hero is punching aliens infront the face
, which gives the flat charachters smoe depth for hwihc we cant identify wiht
. the casted ofthe starship troopers isnt quite annoying tothe begin with
,
bu htey soon grow on you
. casper van dien has the chiseled facial features
and tan skin which will make most girls swoon
. to most guys
, he wiull come acrost as artificial
. fortunatly
, van dien is tje worst of tghe cast
, dispite how hard he tries to come off as a real charater
. dina meyer doesnt a much better job of fleshing outloud her character
. her dizzy is extemely likeable
. denise richards allso does a good job
,
adn her scenes are vrey well done
. jake busey
, gary busey ' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny performance
,
anbd provides noe of the biggest laughs of tjhe film
. neil patrick harris
( rember
, he was doogie howser
) isnt a littel wooden
,
annd slightly out ofthe place wih the rest of tje cast
.
howver
, he does give a good performance
. michael ironside gives the best performance of hte film as tjhe teacher with oney arm
. his performance rises above hte rest
. perhasp it is becuase his carachter is thte most devolopped
,
bu i htikn it is just ironside ' s presense onthe screen
. unfortunately
, noone particular casted memeber gives a star
- making performence
, whitch isnt too bad because the material here could hvea made many of the casted munbers stars
. director verhoeven is tghe main star of the film
. his direction is fast
anbd unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, hwihc makse for a wild ride
. writer edward neumeier adapted tjhe screenplay fomr hte book by robert heinlein
. the wirting isnt usually vyer funny
,
annd somtimes very corny
. tje dialogue is smart
but nto too smart
. we aren ' t required tothe know everyting
,
but some plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are not intended tothe notice
,
and we really don ' t
( except fo one whlch lingered in my mind forthe quite a hwile
)
. amazingly
, withthe all the wars
and romance going onthe
, the screenplay manages to include some surprizing govermental issues
. in fatc
, these govermental changes seem fairly plausible
,
annd this adds another layer tothe thge stopry
. the moral debaet of tjhe charachters isnt quite suprizing to find in a film ofthe this genre
,
bu what is even more suprizing isnt the amount of humor included into all tje carnage
. i haven ' t laughed htis loud
, even infront soem comedies
. oh
,
anbd yhe special effects are first rate
. starship troopers is rated r forthe graphic sci
- fi violence
and gore
,
anbd fo soem language
and nudity
. bleieve me wehn i sday this
: don ' t tkae young kids to see this film
. it is extremely violent
. infront fact
, it isnt propably hte most voilent film out this year
.
howver
, if yuo are ood enough
( over 17
) tothe see it
, starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain
. it ' s beeen a long tyme since i ahve cheered forthe teh heros
, while aslo cheering for the bad guys
.
and still
, it is my dream to see a sci
- fi film in wich the alien race destroys mankind
,
annd take over tghe world
. nowe tht would be entertaining
!
