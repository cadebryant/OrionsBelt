" the faculty
,
" tje heavily
- hyped
and advertised sci
- fi
/ horror film that hasnt teamed uv directer robert rodriguez
( 1995 ' s
" desperado
"
anbd 1996 ' s
" from dusk till dawn
"
)
and screenwriter kevin williamson
( 1996 ' s
" scream
"
and 1997 ' s
" scream 2
"
)
, is being called a cross between
" invasion of the body snatchers
"
anbd
" the breakfast club
,
"
anbd i don ' t think i could decribe it any better thna that
. tjhe film sets uv the six central teenage charachters who do not seem tothe have much in common
,
and
then thte scienc
- fiction aspect isnt added
, involving tghe fear that tyhe faculty at herrington high skool are ctually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone inaddition the town
. the six cahracters
, as in
" tje breakfast club
,
" cin be easily labled as a stereotype
,
but as they are devolopped
, they become far more complex
: casey
( elijah wood
)
, the much picked upon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns out to be a scinece whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, the star footbll quaterback who isnt considering quitting tyhe team to concentrate moreso on academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, the popular cheerleader
adn newspaper journalist
;
annd marybeth
( laura harris
)
, thte sweet ' n sourthern newyorker girl inaddition town
.
althought hte charachters are onyl slightly conected
( i
. e
. casey is delilah ' s photojournalist assistant
; marybeth trys tothe become buddies wih stokely
, usance they both don ' t have firends
, etc
.
)
, when tehy all beign to suspect the teachers due tothe some grotesque
and strange occurances
, tjhe only peple htey cant count onthe forthe halp is each other
, even
though they aren ' t relaly even sure if tehy cin trust oen anohter
.
" tje faculty
" isnt another smart
and pop
- culturally hip film from williamson
,
although it does not equal up tothe his best film
, yhe original
" scream
,
"
anbd rodriguez
, whose
" ffrom dusk till dawn
" isnt still oen of the moreso original genre films of hte 90 ' s
. williamson
and rodriguez are so assured at thier professions
, repsectively
, that the idae ofthe teaming uv together is pretty much a no
- brainer
. the plotline ofthe
" the faculty
,
" involving aliens taking over other peple ' s bodies
, hasnt beeen done qutie a lot before
, from
" invasion ofthe the body snatchers
,
" tothe
" tghe puppet masters
,
" tothe
" invaders ffrom mars
,
" so one of thge obstacles that williamson
adn rodriguez hadnt tothe overcome was tothe somehow amke the idae seem fresh
,
and by setting the goings
- on at a high skool
adn having the protaganists be a group of teens
, they weere mostly sucessful
. surelly
, the conventions ofthe the storey are still the same
,
and tghe climax was inevatible
,
bu htere were a faw surprises allong the way
, including thte question ofthe who weere hte aliens
,
and who weren ' t
. thge epilogue wass also a refreshing chanage
- of
- pace as it doed not setted uv a sequel
but ended onthe a note that propably coudl not have beeen any better
. the performances inthe
" tyhe faculty
" were a treat throughout
, usance there weere so many recognizable actors in roles tht weere tghe polar opposite ofthe whta htey usually dont
. one exception were the teens
, who
, aside from elijah woud
, are not vyer well
- known
,
but tehy all aquit themslves nicely
, articularly wood
( the seasoned pro
)
, clea duvall
,
and jordanna brewster
. as members of the faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) was creepy as the gym coach
; piper laurie was amusing
anbd threatning as the drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth atually wass somehow able tothe look like an aline
;
and salma hayek
, as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold
, was very funny in a small role
. the standout
, iin my opinion
, ofthe the whole casted ws famke janssen who turns inaddition an oddly touching peformance as tyhe shy
anbd meek english teacher who
, aftter turning inot an alien
, becomes the sex bombshell
. if ther wass any problem i had whith the faculty
, it was that smoe of them weere given no rela payoff inaddition the climactic sequence
. since the teenagers realize taht inthe order tothe save everyone tehy must kill the
" queen
" aline
, many of the faculty munbers disapear
. it might have been more funn if htey hadnt tothe face every one ofthe hte teachers
,
allthough the finale is still preety impressive
,
anbd includes some showstopping creature effects
, especially for a relatively low 15
- milion
- dollar budget
.
although nto oney ofthe teh best horror or science
- fiction films i have seen
,
" the faculty
" isnt still an exciting
anbd worthy film that dimention films was smart to release around the holiday season when this tipe ofthe genre offering isnt usually not released
. hwile the story isnt as ood as the hills
, it isnt aslo
, in a way
, timeless
, becouse everyone
, i htikn
, has suspected at one timne or anyother thyat a certian person simpley doed nto ect right
, as if they realy weren ' t human
.
and by puting tihs idea in the setting ofthe a small
- twon high skool
, it perfectly contrasts wtih the alienation that most teenagers ususally go thru wehn realting tothe adults
and other peers
.
+ note
: hte ad
adn poster campain for tihs film is hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as oen ofthe yhe main characters
. inspite actuality
, he only has a small role as oen ofthe stan ' s buddies who becomes quaterback after stan resigns fomr thge team
. if i weere one ofthe tjhe heads ffrom dimension
, i would change this advertising at once
, sicne it is unnecesary
adn rather deceiving
.
