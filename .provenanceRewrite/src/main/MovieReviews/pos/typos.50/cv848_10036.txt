clint eastwood
, inspite his ripe old age
, is cashing one talent infront for anohter
. midnight in thge gardai of good
and evil isnt an eastwood
- directed film clint isn ' t even in
,
annd it ' s damn good
. adapted from a best
- selling john berendt novel based on true events
, this movei is setted iin the bazare georgia twon of savannah
, where peple walk invisible dogs
and attatch horseflies to theri head
.
and that ' s just thge mayor
. as director
and producer
, eastwood contibutes a self
- indulgent
but very competent 150 mintues
, neatly balancing drama
, suspense
and humor
. like all great movies
, midnight inaddition tghe gardai has a lot of funny moments that spring from tyhe characters themselves
,
and not from some contrived
, juvenile intrusion
. tjhe acting
, from big
- time stars john cusack
annd kevin spacey
, is as good as yuo ' d expect
,
but it ' s yhe supporting stable tht gives tjhe movei its offbeat charm
. cusack plays a free
- lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story fo twon
& country magazine about one ofthe eccentric millioniare spacey ' s parties
. lots ofthe food
, beverages
and gunplay
. yes
, an employee ofthe spacey ' s hasnt a huge argument inaddition front of cusack
adn later turns uv dead
. it seems liek a simple matter of self
- defense
-
- thge guy threatend spacey
, shooted at him
, missed
,
thn spacey took him out
-
-
but bieng a movei
, there ' s much more to it tahn thyat
,
and cusack decides tothe stay inspite twon
and rwite a book baout the murder
, a book which wiull eventually become a movei he iwll star in
. the weird circle ofthe enteratinment
. htis is where the stable of supporting characters comes in
. htere ' s the requisite sexy woman
( alison
" nepotist ' s daugter
" eastwood
)
, tyhe stange piano player
, the voodoo woman
and thte transvestite
. miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his
/ her pwn
, as the stealer ofthe eveyr scene she appears inspite
-
- waht would this movei be without the castilian scene
and her testimony
? chablis
, palying herself
, is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul
,
but never seems exploited as tjhe movei ' s comic relief or outloud ofthe palce inaddition a basicaly sereous movie
. ther are allso a fair share ofthe courtroom scenes
, wich these days almsot never seem welcome in a movie
,
but even here clint manages tothe keep the movei fascinating
. certainly the characterizations ofthe the judge
adn spacey ' s lawyer both halp immensely
, as does hvaing hte fly
- guy as the jurny ' s foreman
. it ' s here we realize thte case boils down tothe an indictement of spacey ' s homosexuality
. yes
, spacey had a sexual relationship with yhe dead man
-
- before he shot him
, of course
. midnight inaddition the gardai of good
adn evil isn ' t a clasic
,
but it isnt noe of the better celebrity
- directed
, true
- story best
- seller adaptations outloud there
. likewise
, noone oen fomr this movei iwll be getting any oscar nominations
,
but the performances are all graet
. in fact
, i ' d allmost reccomend thgat tyhe accadamy add a best supporting transvestite categroy
. serving amercia fo mroe than 1
/ 25th of a century
