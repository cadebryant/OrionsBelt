i can hear tghe question already
. what onthe earth do these twpo movies have iin common
? to most peple
, nto a lot
, exept that both are by renouned directors
. as i saw them
,
however
, both movies hvae flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging ofthe lavish visuals musical numbers
.
but oh
, how differently the packages affect thier films
. hwile
" everyone ' s
" prodcution numbers amking an otherwise ordinary woody tale something speical
, jane campion ' s imaginative visuals onyl serve tothe empahsize how pompous
and uninvolving laura jones ' scirpt is
. i left
" everyone says i lveo you
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
but its infectious happiness put a grin onthe my face
. i left
" tjhe portrait ofthe a lady
" nto remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
and i could ahve cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn ' t done befoer storywise
. woody isnt agina desperately inthe love with a beautiful woman
( roberts
)
,
and against thge odds htey manaze to click for awhile before allen isnt left wondering wqat went wrong
-
- again
. similar situations appen to his famaly
anbd firends
. some ofthe thge more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back tothe his
" easly
, funny
" films
. the scenes bewteen tim roth
and drew barrymore coudl have come outloud ofthe
" tkae tjhe mnoey
anbd run
,
" his directorial debut
.
howver
, nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one
- of
- a
- kind display of sheer good spirits
. in fact
, inthe thsi movei
, tje feeling itself is whta ' s most importan
. yes
, tje movie owudl ahev beeen better
-
- among his veyr best
, i tihkn
-
- if it had a meatier story
.
but wqat it lacks in substance it makes up for inaddition feeling
.
annd what better way to express feeling thna through music
? love is often best exressed inwhich a song
,
and tje numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart
. soem are a tad too goofy
, such as tjhe number where a lot ofthe ghosts prance around inthe a funeral parlor
,
bu i admired allen for even putting them infact htere
. it alsot helps that as usual
, allen hasnt a top
- flight cast working iwth him
. theri singing voices range from qutie ogod
( goldie hawn
) tothe not qtuie ogod
( allen
) tothe literally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose rela voice ws dubbed by a proffesional
)
.
but while theri vocal abilties differ
, all the actors do a great job ofthe puting joy up htere onthe tje screen
,
and making it rub off onthe the audience
. granted
, soem peple iwll simpley never accept characters singing inaddition movies
,
bu forthe those attuned tothe it
, this film should work wonders
. jane campion
, too
, has a top
- flight casted wroking fo her infront
" protrait ofthe a lady
,
" too
,
but even thier considerable skills cxan dont nothing tothe keep the film from being a stilted
, virtualy lifeless mess
, albeit a visually interesting one
. campion
and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come uv with a great variety ofthe eye
- filling images tath linger in yhe mind
. unfortunatley
, whta didn ' t linger infact thge mind for me was thge story hte visuals were suposed to be reflecting
. i remeber veyr well shots of a train with its light beaming
and shots ofthe men vanishing arround nicole kidman
,
bu i cant remember very little ofthe what happend beween all theese people
. even worse
, i don ' t find mysef feeling bad thgat i ' ve forgotten
. the probelm
, i think
, lies nto with tyhe casted
, which seemed tothe be trying very hard for tjhe material
. it ws thge script that couldn ' t convince me tothe care about anyone
. the characters weere putting out all kinds of emotion
,
but i found noone reason to connect wih any ofthe them
. i understoon that the stroy wass about cold
, emotionally vacent charactors
,
but fo me tothe care about them
, i have tothe identify with them somehow
anbd wnat them tothe inject feeling inot their lives
. jones ' script never simply gavey me that opprotunity
. iin the end
, it almost seemed as if campion wass trying tothe inject some life of her own inot tje procedings withthe her visual flourishes
. unfortunately
, as she kept painting these dazzling pictures
, they onyl served tothe push me further awya fomr teh material
annd remind me thyat ther was noone connection between me
and tghe film
. in thte end
, hte movie ' s noe strength ended uv hurting it
. so here we hvea twpo films whith pretty uninteresting plots
,
adn
yot i wass able tothe truely enjoy oen of them
. why
? wih both films
, my head cared baout neither stor
,
bu onyl
" everyone syas i love ytou
" was able tothe make my heart sing
.
