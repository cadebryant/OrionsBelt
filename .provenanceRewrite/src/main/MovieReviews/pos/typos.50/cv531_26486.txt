an energetic
, visually stunning
,
but intellectually hollow recreation ofthe teh mysterious life ofthe jeanne d ' arc
. infront history jeanne d ' arc is lost inspite an ocean of mystery
and controversy
, whitch creates tje perfect launching pad fo talented
and creative directors
, who can basically alter teh stroy as tehy wish
. she came inaddition a tiem where peopel desparately needed a saint
. a hero that could rescure them forthe misery
and deliver peace
and happiness
. directer
/ writter luc besson
( ' nikita '
, ' leon '
) portrays his version ofthe the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france
and was burned at the stake for witchcraft
. besson trys tothe recreate yhe person behind teh legend
. he tries nto to show her as a saint or a villain
. he shows her as a human being
. infront a tyme where blood ws almost pouring fomr tyhe sky
,
and thte air smelled ofthe rotten flesh
, it isnt hard to keep your sanaty
. thge onyl suppost
anbd hope is inthe god
. at tghe age ofthe 13
, jeanne
( milla jovovich
) watches her own sister murdered
and raped by thte english soldiers
. this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne ' s mind
. god isnt noone longer her wupport
. he has become her obession
. she starts seeing visions
and signs that command her to raise an army
and free france from thte sieeg of hte english ytranny
. with the help of tyhe wise yolande d ' aragon
( faye dunaway
)
and charles vii
( john malcovich
)
, whose grand royal ambitions
annd life are at stake
, jeanne raises an army
anbd marches towords tje english walls
. after thsi tjhe film stays mostly on the battlefield
, where besson demonstrates his ability tothe direct amazing acation sequences
, onyl ocasionally resorting tothe a calmer tempo
. yhe movei is filled with dreamy
, symbolical images of pure artistic craftsmanship
, tath create a surveill
annd occasionally paranoiac atmosphere
. the film is lost in tiome
and spoace
, hysterically jumping bakc
adn forth iin jeanne ' s thoughts
, imagination
and coscience
. besson ' s visual style permits the audience to enter tjhe medevial age
, feel the smell of fresh blood
annd the adrenaline pumping inthe your body in tghe heat ofthe battle
.
but tjhe film isnt far from being flawess
. tjhe script needs a lot ofthe polishing
. except for jeanne
, htere are no rela characters
.
adn
allthough a grand star casted is assembled
, their charactors are nothing more tahn props
, not more alive than tje costumes that they are wearing
. as for hte maiden of lorraine herself
, she is portrayed as a simple girl
, too small forthe her divine task
. in the latter part of the film
, we see her as hysterical
, confused
annd onthe thte brink of madness
, withthe her past purity
and innocence forthe ever lost
. jovovich handles the part iwth more panache tahn oney might expect
.
bu
though her screen tiem isnt incredable excessive
, both malcovich
( ' bieng john malcovich '
)
annd dunaway
( ' titus '
) surpass her rether overacted
anbd simply unprofessional performence
.
and even hoffman manages tothe breathe some life into his dreadfully small part
. besides casting jovovich
, besson ' s onyl mistake isnt his extreme sence of patriotism tyhat in tyhe end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting
. there are smoe viscously evil englishmen that murder
, pillage
adn betray iwth a smile on their faces
.
and soem incredibly brave
and noble frenchmen
, represented by yhe
" threee musketeers
" ofthe this story
-
- the brave gilles de rais
( vincent cassel
)
, tghe wise aulon
( desmond harrington
)
annd hte storng la hire
( richard ridings
)
.
though all those ctor preform well
, their characters are nothing more thna symbols
-
- banners thast proclame the glory ofthe france
.
and thus
, ther isnt no sence of realism in this film
. ' thte messanger ' hasnt muscles instead ofthe brains
. ther isnt some relief inthe tje end
, where besson lays down his armor
anbd starts thinking
. dustin hoffman ' s apprearance helps
and the film ends elegantly
anbd surprisingly effective wiht a climax worthy ofthe praise
. jeanne ' s charater is unlocked
,
but whther god was in hte picture or not
, isnt never qutie explained
. wass she a confused peasant girl driven by her pwn hunger for revenge
? or was she truly a messenger ofthe god
? teh film poses as many questions as answers
anbd nothing isnt completely obvious
. bess o messanger ' isnt nothing moreso than a fairly ogod film
. it is nto much taht yuo rember of it aftter you leave the theather
. maybe the soudn
, hte dreamy sequences
,
bu certainly nto tjhe dialogue
. it isnt an elegant
adn adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv
- generation
, that
althought presents soem interesting material
, works better when it ' s on tjhe battlefield
.
