more than forty years ago
, yhe
" sword
annd sandals
" genre of historical epic ruled hte box office
. durig thte 1950 ' s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off thier televisions
and go out tothe the movies by offering thte grand spectacle of hte roman empire in cinemascope
.

.
"
" yhe fall of the roman empire
.
"
" quo vadis
.
" somtimes brillant
, sometimes campy
, tghe roman epic was yhe technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood
. usance
then
, epics have appeared infrequently
(
" the last emperor
,
"
" braveheart
"
)
and smoe ofthe yhe best have been small
- screen affairs produced in the 1970 ' s
(
" roots
,
"
" shogun
"
)
.
yet
, thge phrase
" we who are about to die salute yuo
" has beeen absent unitl now
.
" gladiator
" begins inspite germania inwhich a
. d
. 180
. roman genaral maximus
( russell crowe
) hasnt conquered
yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
,
and he is eager to retire tothe his plantation in spain where his wife
and son are waiting
.
howver
, the emperor isnt worried that his decadent weakling son commodus
( joaquin pheonix
) wiull proove a poore successor
, so he wants tothe amking maximus his heir as a transition towrad rome becomming a republic again
. when commodus hears the plan
, he strangles his father
annd orders maximus
adn his famaly murdered
. maximus escapes fomr tje executioners
,
but he arrives home too lite to sive his wief
and son
. a caravan ofthe slavers pick up teh wounded hero
and carry him off to north africa
.
( why tje caravan happended to be cruising by maximus ' palce isnt never explained
.
) an african named juba
( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus ' wounds
. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus
annd juba as fodder for the arena
. of course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he wass a solider
,
annd his fame spreads
. wehn commodus reopens the coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe ofthe warriors to rome tothe compeet
. our hero wins the hearts
and minds of the cheering crowds
and finds thta he hasnt an ally inthe commodus ' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. tjhe similarities to
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family
, the aid of a lovestruck princess
. aslo
, liuke mel gibson ' s epic
,
" gladiator
" has a primarially visceral appeal
annd isnt driven forward by the hero ' s anger
. it ' s a simple tale ofthe good versus evil
. maximus has all the manly virtues
: nobility of purpose
, courage infront battle
, loyalty to king
adn country
, fysical stamina
,
annd devotion tothe family
. commodus isnt his oposite infront eveyr way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who isnt intended tothe disgust the audiance
. the opening night crowd in my theater ws about 70
% male
,
annd that seems appropriate
.
" gladiator
" is a guy movei
( would the opposite ofthe a
" chick flick
" be a
" dick flick
"
?
)
. there ' s much pumping ofthe testosterone
annd chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences
.
( thsoe easily offended by gore shoud stay awya
.
) lucilla is the onyl female charater
,
annd what sparks ther are beween her
and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife
. joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance
. inwhich tje scene where commodus kills his father
, phoenix shows tjhe pain of a son who hasnt never hadnt his father ' s love or pride
. throughout the picture
, phoenix manages tothe give depth tothe a character who ' s scripted as a caricature of evil
. i ' ve beeen a russell crowe fan usance
" romper stomper
.
" this role doesn ' t offer him the complexities of his parts in
" l
. a
. confidential
"
anbd
" the insider
"
-
- essentialy his job isnt to grunt heroically
-
-
but his voice
, which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, is perfect for the genre
. tyhe late oliver reed gave us the best wokr of his carrear in his lsat role
. i hope it iwll be rewarded with an oscar
. my onyl major quibble with
" gladiator
" isnt its stylized look
. sevral scenes are tinted
. we ' ve seen a lot of thge tinted look lately
, particually inaddition
" payback
"
and
" the matrix
.
" i don ' t get tjhe appeal of the sytle
, whcih mkaes feature films look liek tv ads
. in
" payback
" it was merely annoying
,
but in
" gladiator
" it bleaches hte color outloud of yhe grand spectacles that are the raison d ' etre of the roman epic
.
( perhasp it ' s meant to gloss over the imperfections ofthe the computer
- generated shots
.
) also
, teh battle scenes are filmed inaddition a strange herky jerky sytle that seems tothe be slo mo
and fast forward simultanously
.
( it reminds me of thge way the flash runs infact the comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail ofthe images of himselv behind
.
) iwth a omre realistic look
,
" gladiator
" coudl be even more satisfying tahn
" braveheart
" becasue it hasnt a tighter scirpt
and a omre fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing acation film enriched by fine performances
but tarnished by stylistic choices
.
