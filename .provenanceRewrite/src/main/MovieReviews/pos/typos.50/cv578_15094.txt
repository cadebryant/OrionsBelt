for a movie about disco
- era excess
,
" 54
" comes uv surprisingly short on hte sleazy happenings at the titular lite 1970s
anbd early 1980s manhattan dance club
. tihkn of it as a sort ofthe
" boogie nights
"
- lite
- where that similiarly
- structured
and
- setted portrayal of the porn inudstry ws loaded witht salacious goings
- onthe
anbd skidded on a distructive midpoint tone shift
,
" 54
" leaves tjhe kinkier details tothe your immagination
. it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject marter
,
but it thankfully never resorts tothe preaching
, either
. in fact
, were it nto forthe tje rampant drug uise
and the intermittant dark moment
,
" 54
" owudl be baout as feathery as tjhe tyme preiod ' s popular female hairstyle
. studio 54 was a haven forthe the rich
, famous
and generaly good
- looking befoer it closed its doors forever in 1986
. inside
, anything went
and
, we are told
, everthing did
. the film ' s ficitional main chracter isnt shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
, tje jerky jock fomr
" i konw what you doed lastr summer
"
)
, a fresh
- faced 19
- year
- ood who dreams of venturing beyond thte club ' s velvet rope
and coming face
- tothe
- face withthe the wild decadence he cant onyl read baout inaddition magazines
. his wish comes true whn studio 54 owner steve rubell
( mike myers
) spots him amongst a crowd ofthe gawkers one night in ' 79
annd permits him passage
-
bu not befoer he doffs his hideous shirt
, of course
. once inside
, shane becomes seduced by the club ' s dizzying vortex ofthe sex
and drugs
. he has such a good time thyat he doesn ' t wnat tothe leave
, so he seeks employment as a busboy
. he quickly becomes friends with greg
( breckin meyer
)
anbd anita
( salma hayek
)
, a marryed cuple who work allong side ofthe him
; greg ' s a fellow busboy wtih asperations to amke thte big monay as a studio 54 bartender
, hwile anita checks coats
but desires a recording contract to call her own
. after rubbing elbows
( among other things
) with a renowned socialite
( sela ward
)
annd gaining hte personal interest of rubell
, shane beigns to ascend to hte opper echelons of 54
.
bu fame doesn ' t come without a price
.
" 54
" ' s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players
- at a slim hour
-
and
- a
- half
, teh film isnt too short to tkae on such a multi
- character focus
,
annd mroe thna a few balls are dropped in thte resulting juggling ect
. alledged last
- minute edits
and reshoots are more thna likely tothe blaim forthe the ocasionally rushed devolopement
adn ambiguous interaction
, sicne
" 54
" sometimes feels liek it ' s missing a scene here or ther
. nowhere isnt tihs mroe apparentt tahn inaddition shane ' s relatiopnship wtih soap opera actress julie black
( neve campbell
)
, a frequent studio 54 patron whom he ' s long admired from afar
. thte romance is prodded along befoer it has a chance tothe tranform into something special
. that
" 54
" works despite these limitations
,
hten
, isnt largly due tothe thge competance
adn energy with which it ' s assembled
. sure
, it ' s shallow
, slick
, sanitized portrait of a bygone age
,
and sure
, we ' ve seen thge rags
- to
- riches stoyr gazillions of times
,
but debut director
and screenwrighter mark christopher keeps thigsn moving with lively snapshots ofthe tghe studio 54 hustle
annd bustle
annd an even livelier casted tothe inhabit his bouncy vision
. thte film boasts soem fine comic creativity
, tyhe pinnacle ofthe which isnt disco dottie
(
" the wedding singer
" ' s ellen dow
)
, an elderly dancing queen who plays teh loving granmother in public
,
but slides uv to shane behind 54 ' s closed doors
anbd asks for a
" funky littel treat
.
" the solid
, sexy casted smoothes out
- if onyl while you ' re caught up inspite tghe film
- any rough spots belonging tothe thier alter
- egos or tjhe plot
. newcomer phillippe has tje karisma
and joisey accent down pat
; he
and campbell
, as fetching as ever
, look so ogod toghether it ' s a shame theri subplot goes nowhere
. meyer exhibits thge congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in
" clueless
"
( he was tjhe stoner wih tghe joker
- smile
)
, while hayek simply sizzles
, expecially wehn leading a dance clas wiht hte mantra
,
" one

" sherry stringfield
, unidentifiable under big ' 70s hair
, takes on her first big
- screen gig since she left
" er
" as rubell ' s accountant
,
but she ' s criminally underused
. as teh droopy
- eyed

, myers isnt worth the price ofthe addmission alone
. whn he ' s not palying teh life ofthe the party
, tje ex
-
" saterday nght live
" comedian strips away all ofthe rubell ' s confidence
annd swagger tothe show a man desperately trying to fill his empty
, unahppy life whith exorbitance
; it ' s a moment worthy ofthe pity when
, hwile lounging on a bed ofthe monye
and vomiting from a partcularly heavy evening
, he attempts to seduce one of his employees
.
and hwile his performance is largly sereous
, myers mixes yhe empathy with a delicate
" austin powers
"
- esque wink
, thus keeping consistant whith
" 54
" ' s overall efel
- gaudy
, larger
- thna
- life
and satisfyingly ornamental
, not unlike a giant disco ball
