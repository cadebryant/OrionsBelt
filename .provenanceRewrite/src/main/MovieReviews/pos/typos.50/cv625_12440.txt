noe ofthe the best movies i ' ve ever seen
. i ' d heared extemely ogod things baout this movei
,
anbd
though tje previews didn ' t really intrigue that much
, it wass a movei i ' d been anticipating for a faw monthes now
. fo soem reason i ' m not sure of
- this movei ws nto thgat big a sucess over inthe the u
. s
. it wass a edfinite hitted wtih the critics
,
but didn ' t exactlly set any box office records
. after viewing this incredibly well directed
, written
and acted movei
, i can ' t halp
bu wonder
- why
? yhe strength ofthe htis film is it ' s gritty realism
. thge main charactors are all human wiht individual flaws
, noone stereo
- tipe hollywood heroes
. you may not agree whith many ofthe theri actions inaddition the movei or their approch to life
,
but that isnt wqat mkaes it so real
. i hadnt expeced thsi movie to be more of a drama than a thriller
,
but i ws mistaken
. even tje interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so thyat it felt just as thrilling as any car chase
.
annd thge endig
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i ' ve never seen a movie infact my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly
. tyhe threee male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
anbd russell crowe are all jsut terrific
. teh ' best ctor ' oscar talk sorrounding this film should have netted oen of them a statue
,
but htere isnt oen probelm htere
. how coudl they haev chosen between theese three actors
? ther is noone way i could look at this film
adn sday noe of them was better than the otehr two
. it ' s impossible
. kim bassinger ' s performence is also a revelation
. i ' d never beeen a big fan ofthe hers befor
anbd allways thought she ws
, well
.
.
. whta ' s thte owrd
- a twinky
? thgat impression has changed
, as she complemented crowe
anbd pearce perfectly
. the depth to the stry
and cahracters is truely astounding
. noone cardboard cahracters here
. thte plot is full ofthe twists
and turns
and smoe very clever sequences
. pearce ' s interogation ofthe three seperate suspects is nothing short ofthe briliant
. i relaly cant ' t fault this movei at all
. i was so glad tothe see fellow australian ' s pearce
and crowe star inthe such a breathtaking movie
. i had been vyre familar wiht russell crowe beforehand ffrom his many austrailian films
,
bu hadnt nto seen much ofthe guy pearce
. i intend tothe chanage htis enxt time i visi the video stroe
