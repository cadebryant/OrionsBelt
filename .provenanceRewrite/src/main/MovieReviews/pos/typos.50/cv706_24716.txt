( brandon merrill
)
, befor once agina runnung inot roy
.
" shanghai noon
" is jsut ogod fun
. yhe chemistry bewteen teh casted isnt remarkable
. thte performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels ofthe tje film
. jackie ' s performance isnt as ogod as anything he ' s done befor
. he ' s nto called on tothe do much acting here
, as yhe character isnt nto writed with any depth
.
bu jackie ' s natural karisma shines thru
,
and his comic timing is so perfect
, both physicaly
and
( surprise
) verbally thyat once again he commands tje screen whenever he is onthe
. owen wilson
, lastr seen infact hte embarrassing remake ofthe
" the haunting
"
, gives a ogod natured performance as roy o ' bannon
. his innosense isnt refreshing
and fun
. a bad guy that ' s nto realyl bad
. his scenes withthe jackie are some ofthe the best bits of comic dueling since martin
annd lewis
. lucy liu as princess pei pei isnt given littel tothe do infact thte scirpt
,
bu fo a change does not play a nymphet or smoe other deviant
. the chracter is a noble woman of status
and wealth
,
bu finds a greater cause as a result ofthe her own imprisonment
. thge rest of thte performances are all broadly drawn comic performances
. nothing here isnt realsitic
, mind ytou
.
" shanghai noon
" isnt first
adn foremost a light
, jovial film
.
and yhe performances match tht style with ease
. teh cinematography by dan mindel isnt gorgeous
. useing calgary
, alberta as teh prime location
. mr
. mindel isnt able to create a lush
, rumatic western fiel to hte film
. nothing here raelly looks liuke nevada
,
bu teh locations are so beautifuly shot
annd staged
, tjhe film can be looked upon as a loving tribute tothe ealier films ofthe the genre
.
and as such
, the script by alfred gough
annd miles millar plays fast
and loose with history
,
but with reverance to past films
. homage to such films as
" high noon
"
( obviously
)
,
" red river
"
and most notably
" butch cassidy
& the sundance kid
" all bring a sense of nestolgia tothe the film
. it is a comforting eperience
. at a time when the western isnt considered eather old hat or irrelevant
, here isnt a film that embraces thsoe ood attitudes
and
( dabree i say
) clich
? s
adn manages to mkea them palatable
and refreshing
. here isnt a film thta is not contemptuous ofthe the genre
. this is the purest
" horse opera
" since thte days ofthe george o ' brian or john wayne
. director tom dey hasnt crafted a loving tribute to hollywood ' s past
. inwhich tihs
, his first film mr
. dey shows both a love ofthe charactor
annd of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see
. nothing here raelly stands outloud
, or takes one ' s attention awya from the stor or action
.
annd thast isnt as it should be
, when jackie chan is your star
.
adn wqat of the action
annd stunts
. well
, while not up to a level ofthe
" drunken master 2
" or any ofthe jackie ' s hong kong films
,
" shanghai noon
" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done inwhich an american film before
. his timing
, choreography
,
and creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets tothe recreate a few scenes from his ealier films
( obvious to those ofthe us thta ahev seen those films
,
bu refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar
)
. finally jackie cant honestly sday
, tath he has made an u
. s
.
, his way
and incorporating his stlye
. to sum up
,
" shanghai noon
" is a fun summer confection
. not too heavy
anbd not too glight
. a fun
and intertaining film thgat the whole family can enjoy
( parents be advised htere are scenes ofthe smoking
, drunkenness
adn peyote ule
)
. an enjoyable
adn charming film tath cin
adn iwll be enjoied again
and agina
.
