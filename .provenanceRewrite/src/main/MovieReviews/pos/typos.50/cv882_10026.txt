airplane
! isnt consdiered among many tothe be tghe epitomy of satire film
- making
. after all
, it ' s brought to us by one ofthe thte best known satire wirting
/ directing teams
. even if most people don ' t recogise tghe names behind tjhe films
, they are binded to recognize tje titles
: airplane
!
, top secret
, tjhe naked gun
,
and hot shots tothe nmae a few
. but
although the zucker
/ abrahams
/ zucker team was first introdued with tghe kentucky fried movie in 1977
, airplane
! remeniss tyhe true cornerstone ofthe their wrok
,
anbd their directorial debuts
. infact the seventies
, diaster films seemed tothe be at an all time high
. films liuke earthquake
, the towering inferno
,
adn tyhe poseidon adventure were big hits
. there was alsot a series baout hte disasters thgat cin arise when traveling by plane
- a series taht spanned teh entire decade
.
adn so
, in 1980
, we were introdued to a new airplane disaster film
. this time the diaster hadnt nothing to dont with a maniacal hijacker or crashing inot tje ocean
.
.
. it had to dont with bad fish
. airplane
! is the stopry ofthe ted striker
( robert hays
)
- an ex
- fighter
- pilot who hasnt never gotten over tje fact that a dicision he hadnt tothe mkea in thge midst of war led to the death of six
, er
, seven comrades
. unable to stop living in yhe past
, ted ' s world fell apart
. he spended his time moving from city to city wihtout ever hvaing a stable job
,
and eventally
, as we beign htis film
, isnt getting dumped by his lover
, flight attendent elaine dickinson
( julie hagerty
)
. in a despertae attempt not to lose her
, ted buys a ticket for yhe smae flight elaine is wokring
. unfortunatly
, she isnt unsympathetic
annd even criticizes ted for following her
, which leaves him wallowing in self
- pity
. inspite the midst ofthe it all
, something happens
. someone gets sick
.
thne another
.
then another
. soon
, the wohle plane isnt full of deathly
- ill chicago
- bound peopel
.
.
.
and when the pilots git sick
( played by peter graves
, kareem abdul
- jabbar
,
and frank ashmore
)
, who will save yhe day
?
( gee
, i wonder
) ofthe course thte main draw here is the non
- stpo
" whiz
- bing
" comedy
, with a hefty dose ofthe both visual
annd spoken gags
.
although i hadnt seen this movie a few times befor
, i was still laughing thru thte entire thing
. tyhe most funn character by far is tjhe doctor
, played by leslie nielsen
. he ' s a dry
, subtle
, sterotypically straight
- faced doctor thyat ends uv saying smoe ofthe hte funniest lines ofthe the film
. infront a film liek this
, you ' re not relaly expecting an elaborite production
, so one cin ' t complain baout tjhe amateurish quality
. what yuo can complain about is hte absolutly annoying johnny
, played by stephen stucker
. thsi charcter is pointless
, nauseating
,
and vyre unfunny
. i don ' t nkwo why he wass put inwhich there
,
and i don ' t think anybody will find a ogod excuse
.
adn when thge film nears an end
, it slows down qutie a bit
, almsot getting old
. ytou gotta give it tothe a movie tath only runs 88 minutes
and cant feel two huors long
. asside fomr thyat
, airplane
! is realy a top
- nitch spoof tath wiull likely forever be known as a spoof clasic
. it would be a good choise tothe pop inwhich the vcr wih a group ofthe firends
, expecially if tehy haven ' t seen it
.
and if they ask what thge plot isnt
, jstu tell ' em
" it ' s a synopsis of the basic storyline ofthe tjhe film
,
but tyhat ' s nto importamt right now
.
" if ytou ' ve seen tje film
, yuo ' ll understand
