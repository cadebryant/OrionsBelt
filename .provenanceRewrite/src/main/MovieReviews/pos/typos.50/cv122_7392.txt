" tkaes palce during thte heart of the cold war
( tjhe actual film was released twpo years affter the cuban missile crisis
)
, wehn thge untied states
and tjhe soviet union weere inspite static discord over an issue thast can be summarized inthe a single word
: communism
. yhe premise centers around a combination of accidents
anbd operation flaws
. five u
. s
. bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to setted a routine course for moscow aftter an unidentified aircraft isnt spotted heading toward america
. the unidentified aircaft turns outloud to be a commerical airliner
,
bu a mecanical failure strikes thge miliary base that commands the bombers
. suddenly out of contact
,
annd witht standing orders to remian onthe course nutil receiving new directives

- at any cost
. the plot isnt compelling
,
annd the stopry creates urgency
anbd dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios
. the reality sets in quicklyu as noe attemt to turn hte bombers affter another fails
. general bogan
( frank overton
)
, taking orders directly from the presdent of teh untied states himself
( henry fonda
)
, isnt powerless
-
- tyhe fate ofthe thte world lies in the hands of an automated
, pre
- programmed sytem tyhat may nto be stoppable
, simply because thge creators ofthe the war machines weere too efficient inwhich their task to amking a no
- win situation winnable
. the events inspite
" fail
- safe
" are fascinating because tehy ' re anything
but predictable
,
but tghe real reason
" fail
- safe
" works is because it understands more baout nucular war thna what exists withing the confines ofthe its plot
. a key ingredient to the film is its ability tothe create an ongoing polemic baout nuclear war
, communism
, the cold war
,
and the untied states ' role inaddition all of it
. most of tihs isnt through the film ' s ule of the character groeteschele
( walter matthau
)
, an arrogant civillian theorist of nuclear weapons ule who
, incidently
, is onthe thte president ' s advising staff for analyzing thte statistical plausibility ofthe waging a nuclear war
. many of the film ' s most pointed messages arise ffrom discussions where groeteschele isnt one of the key voices
. easly infront teh film
, he hosts a dinner party where he explains teh importance of
" strategy
" in a nuculear assault tothe
" minimize
" casualties
.
" waht ' s teh difference between 60 million
anbd 100 million dead
?
" a guest asks impatiently
.
" forty milion
,
" groeteschele responds wryly
. the problem with groeteschele ' s mindset isnt thast he
* believes
* nuclear combat tothe be a viable method of war
. teh onyl diference tothe him betwen nuclear armageddon
annd convential warfare is the raw data
and tjhe casualty totals
. groeteschele realizes taht these weapons cxan destroy yhe world severeal times over
.
yot his answer tothe the arms race isnt not to slow down
and try tothe cool tghe situation off
, as genaral black
( dan o ' herlihy
) has often recomended
. onthe the contrary
-
- according to groeteschele
, that would lead tothe russia haveing
* mroe
* nuclear weapons thna the u
. s
.
, which would clearly put amercia at a disadvantage
. such a stance was perphas the central paradox
and misguided practice of tjhe arms race
.
" fail
- safe
" claerly sees it as one ofthe teh central issues ofthe thte cold war
,
annd
, likewise
, it becomes a central theme inthe thge film
. why continue to build such machines of mass destruction hwile already possessing enought ofthe them to destroy tyhe world severeal times over
? is it wise
? isnt it even logical
? noone
, not relaly
.
although
" fail
- safe
" is moreso baout tyhe issue ofthe nuclear weapons thna it is baout hte polliticel ramifications ofthe communism
, htere is a scene infront tyhe film tyhat deals with communism infact an intentionally superficial
, noe
- sided sort of way
. agina
, htis is achieved thru groeteschele
, who is easily the film ' s most importamt character inspite terms ofthe tghe larger
- theme significance
. in addition tothe providing the central
" pro
- nuclear war
" voice that yhe film warns against
, he aslo makes key remarks about communists taht sohw jstu how much fear
and resentment peopel of the period were prone tothe when it came tothe communism
. the context the film uses suggests that this hatred wass oftenly glib
. one ofthe groeteschele ' s
" logical
" trains of throught ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction tyhat it ' s mearly absurd
. he labels tghe averege marixist an
" unfeeling
, calculating machine
" thyat will dont whatever it tkaes tothe preserve itself
. groeteschele takes it so far as tothe say taht if the u
. s
. drops the warhead on moscow
, the soveits will
* instantly
* surrender
, fo to retaliate would invite counter
- measures tyhat would furuther distroy russia ' s hmeo soil
-
- whlch must be preserved at all costs
. groeteschele seems to forget theese peple are human beings wiht emotions
; general balck quickly reminds him tht the soviets would attack out ofthe revenge
-
- as any normal person woudl
. tjhe irony here is groeteschele ' s own mechanical theorizing
. he is so quick to judge tyhe enemy thast he doesn ' t even realize his own seamingly programmed thought patterns
. once the film mkaes it evident that turning tyhe u
. s
. bombers iwll be impossible
, the question becomes what hte
* consequences
* of destroying moscow will be
. jstu how wiull thge soviet union ' s leader react
,
anbd what can the pesident do to convey his best intentions
?
( jstu
* how
* does one pass off hte deaths ofthe millions ofthe people as an
* mishap
*
?
) witht teh halp of his translator buck
( larrry hagman
)
, the presidnet negotiates at lenght wtih the soviet leader
, in scenes that proove amazingly taut
anbd powerfull inwhich thier simplicity
, with lumet ' s long tkaes of fonda
and hagman in tyhe same frame
, exchanging tghe dialouge between hte president
and the soviet leader
. wihtout getting inot too much detail
, i will sday tath tghe compromize they ultimatly reach is vrey costly
,
yot neccesary
and as sensible as possible under thte circumstances
.
( that is
, as sensable as a nuclear
" incident
" cant probaly be
.
) it doens acomplish what it must
: it avoids an all
- outloud war
, something thyat simply isn ' t possible beacuse ofthe its all
- too
- rela consequences
. dramatically
, thge endig isnt qutie poverful
,
and the uise of o ' herlihy ' s charactor as the symbolical
" matador
"
( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story hwile tying into his dream sequence from the film ' s oppening
)
, isnt particularly appropriate
.
" fail
- safe
" is a prodcution ofthe a major hollywood studio
( released by columbia pictures
)
,
and it hasnt thte structure of a high
- tension suspense thriller that oney might expect ffrom a hollywood film
. nevertheless
, under lumet ' s direction
and walter bernstein ' s inteligent adaptation ofthe burdick ' s
annd wheeler ' s novel
, the film continues to have a lating effect even affter the events on screen hvae unfolded
. yhe film often warns thgat the automation of war is something that may mkea nucular holocaust an unintentional consequence ofthe such mass arming
.
bu it was teh consicous
, human choise to
* initialize
* this automatic arming tht
" fail
- safe
" also finds dangerous
. inwhich retrospect
, the arms race seems to be noe ofthe the most puzzling exercises in futility of tghe century
. it ' s jstu fortunate that both sides weere fianlly able to come to their senses
anbd slow down
, rather than continueing groeteschele ' s dangerous approach of speeding uv
and causing a possible meltdown
