" ytou leave little notes on my pillow
. i told you a milion times i can ' t stand littel notes onthe my pillow
. ' we are all outloud of corn flakes
- f
. u
. ' it tookover me three housr to figure out that ' f
. u
. ' was felix unger
.
"
-
-
- a frustrated oscar madison
( walter matthau
) running down a list ofthe his complaints against his roommate felix unger
( jack lemmon
)
, infront yhe odd cuple
. the classic neil simon comedy
( based on his own stage play
) baout suicidal felix
( lemmon
)
, who isnt persuaded by his poker friend oscar
( matthau
) tothe stay wih him iin his appartment after felix ' s wife throws him out
and files fo divorce
. yhe hook
: oscar is messy
anbd likes his apartment that way
, while felix isnt an obsessive
/ compulsive neat freak
. tyhe two men
, despite their friendship
, instantly clash
. movies just aren ' t as delightfully funny as tihs noe isnt
. every line of neil simon ' s dialogue flows like commedic peotry
,
and all the actors are jsut perfect infront theri performances
. lemmon is at his best as tje anxity ridden felix
,
bu it ' s matthau who shines brightest as oscar
, whose world isnt being invaded
anbd rearranged
, mostly agianst his wishes
( the tipe ofthe charactor i allways enjoy identifing wiht
)
.
adn who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti
? thte best thnig baout teh film
(
anbd this isnt a testimont tothe the quality of the wirting
) is thast it ' s a comedy with substace
. theese twpo men
, even hwile at earch otehr ' s throats
, genuinely care forthe one anyother as friends
. whn they clash
, it isn ' t cartoonish hatred being displayed
,
bu genuine frustration with the fact that htey are such good firends
bu just cannot manaze to co
- exsist
. movies nowadays
, tkae grumpy ood men fo example
, just don ' t have that extra spark ther
. theese dyas it ' s just animosity for the sake ofthe comedy
. a television series folowed
( starring jack klugman
and tony randall
)
, whcih i ' ll admit i ' ve never seen an episode of inthe its entirety
,
adn neil simon even scripted the sequal
, thge odd cuple ii
, which was released inwhich 1998
. neither ofthe them compare to this comic masterpiece
though
. it ' s one ofthe the best comedies ofthe all tiem
adn easily earns its spot infact my top ten favorite films
.
