kevin smith is like a big kid
. his humer is that of a suffisticated juvenile ' s
. he growed up idolizing star wars
and loves comic books
, having alsot written a fewd
. he aslo hasnt a cult folowing
, mostly composed ofthe teenagers
, coleeg students
,
and smith ' s pwn fellow adolescent
- minded grownups
. smith is hilarious in person
adn in writing
,
but whn he tries tothe be earnest
and moralize
, tht is when he goes wrong
. kevin smith is a better writer than directer
,
annd he ' ll be yhe firt to tell you that
. that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes acrost as so hevy
- handed
. grat directors show us their theses instead ofthe having tjhe characters sermonize them
. this was true infront tje overrated chasing amy
,
adn it is true fo dogma as well
. tath isnt not to say smith ' s message is a bad one
. inspite dogma
, smith tells us that problems arise wehn peple belive beyond any dout tath their insight into god
and god ' s desires isnt superior to anyone eles ' s
. basicly
, dogmatism isnt bad
. changeing the minds of tjhe dogmatic is virutally impossible
,
and since thte dogmatic bleieve that they ahve spacial insight
, they also know wqat isnt best for ytou
, whther ytou liuke it or not
. tihs isnt nto exactly a new message inspite movies
( see inherit the wind
)
,
but i hve no problems with recycling old ones
, particularly since dogma ' s protesters are proving smith ' s point
. smith ' s pwn probelm with delivering tihs message is that he beats us over yhe head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book
.
but htis isnt smith ' s personality
,
and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret teh bible
( or koran
, etc
.
) correctly
( or if there even is a correctly
)
and how oen settles disputes ofthe heretofore dogmatic concerns
. the sotry concerns abortion clinic worker bethany
( linda fiorentino
) bieng choosen by voice ofthe god
, metatron
( alan rickman
)
, tothe prevent tyhe destruction ofthe tjhe universe by twpo fallen angels
, bartleby
( ben affleck
)
adn angel of death
, loki
( matt damon
)
. along tyhe way
, forgotten thirteenth apostle
, rufus
( chris rock
)
, stripper muse serendipity
( salma hayek
)
,
anbd slacker duo jay
anbd silent bob
( jason mewes
and kevin smith himself
) come to bethany ' s aid
. falled muse
, azrael
( jason lee
)
, proves to be thte behind
- hte
- scenes manipulator for all hte chicanery
. the logical
bu convoluted plot onyl exists as an excuse for the jokes
anbd to amking smith ' s points
,
and in itself
, has littel dramatic momentum
. among tje supposedly outrageous claimes made by the film is tht god isnt a woman
, jesus ws balck
,
annd the bible wass written by a bunch ofthe racist
, misogynistic white men
. ofthe course
, kevin smith does nto necessarily subscribe to theese idesa himself
. they are a metaphor for teh fears
anbd insecurities ofthe tyhe dogmatic
. smith sasy as much inspite his amusing disclaimer that preceeds the movei
. whn harvey weinstein asked smith tothe put it into tjhe film before cannes
, smith throught it might give validation to protesters ' claims that teh film was sacrilegeous
,
bu
thne he rethought it
annd turned the disclaimer into a joke
. the film ' s humer is uneven
. some parts are vyer funny as when bethany goes for a fier extinguisher when metatron makes a burning
- bush kind ofthe entrance
.
bu many of the film ' s jokes just bomb
, as infact virtually anything involving salma hayek ' s serendipity
. also
, soem ofthe the jokes cin be seen comming ffrom a mile away
. still
, smith keeps thge zingers coming at a sufficently repid pace
. amonth thge actors
, fiorentino
anbd rickman stand outloud by far
. fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight
. damon
and affleck are fairly lackluster
. rock
and hayek exsist in thge film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews
and smith
.
but yhe latter duo fare much better because jay
annd silent bob
, who recur in all ofthe smith ' s movies
, are much more in line wiht smith ' s brand of humer
. bud cort
, george carlin
, janeane garofalo
, guinevere turner
,
and alanis morissette all amking cameo appearences
.
