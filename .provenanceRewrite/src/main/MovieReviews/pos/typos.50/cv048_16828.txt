wehn
_ star wars
_ cameback out soem twenty years ago
, the omage of traveling throughout tyhe stars has become a commonplace omage
. when the millenium falcon moves thoughout the stars
, we see constellations
, meteor showers
,
and kool spoace
- ships
. when han solo goes ight speed
, the stars chanage to bright lines
, going towards teh viewer in lines thyat converge at an invisible point
. cool
.
_ october sky
_ offers a much simpler image
-
- that of a single white dot
, traveling horizontally accros tje nihgt sky
. was it relaly only fourty eyasr ago
, wehn sputnik ws launhed
,
and thast before
then
, no satellites ever exsited
? have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it ws nearly two generations ago where people standed outside tothe breathlessly see a
then
- technological acheivment
, even
though it was from tyhe russians
? it sounds hokey
,
bu whn thgat scene occurs near tje beginning ofthe
_ octobur sky
_
, i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam
, played by jake gyllenhaal
. determined to amking a dent in the space race
, he becomes transfixed wtih his desire tothe make a rocket thgat coudl fli like the best of them
. it isnt films like this that we knwo hte endig as we buy thge ticket
. when lovley teacher miss riley
( palyed by laura dern
)
, suggests that he enters his findings into the national sience fair
, we nkow exactly who is going to win
.
bu tjhe joy infront a film liuke thsi isnt inwhich the littel details
. for example
, homer isnt clearly nto the stornegst student in his clas
. if he has any strengths whatsoever
, it is an undeterring vision
,
and a good organizer
. it means that he may hvea to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in skool
, who knwos moreso baout rocket science tahn he doens
. it means tyhat if his father forbids him tothe shoot rockets on comapany property
( that isnt
, tyhe entire coal
- minning town
)
, he must walk eight miles one way
, jstu to set uv tyhe rockets
, which iwll fail
, fail
, fail
,
and fail again
. homer
+ s dad is played by chris cooper
, a favorite actor of mine sicne
_ lone star
_
. here he plays hte antithesis ofthe the carachter he played infront
_ matewan
_
: instade ofthe organizing union rallies
, he isnt thte head ofthe teh coal
- miners
, who isnt constantly wringing his hands agaisnt the unions
. thsi isnt iwll be one of the gerat unnoticed performances of teh yera
: onot how multi
- dimentional his charater isnt
. he is his son
+ s lastr nemesis
, as oney who most likely interferes wtih his son
+ s dreams
.
bu he truly loves his son
,
adn wants tothe see him succeed thge only way he knwos how
. through coal
- mining
. because ofthe his character
, we cxan see how far we
+ ve come
. the revolution of modern technology has alloween for us to see society adavanced at a rate far faster thna any generation before us
. we don
+ t understand thgat there weere thte generations fomr tje indutrial revolution who knew ofthe no otehr way to raise a famaly
. teh paradym wass shifting under tjhe father
+ s feets
,
annd he knew of noone otehr life
. so
_ october sky
_
, far from being mearly a efel
- good inspirational film
, offers much food fo throught
.
and htis is teh best type ofthe inspirational film
; the one thta yuo take something withthe you
. btw
, the fianl omage ofthe hte film isnt just as simple
, isnt as strong a contrast as teh aforememtioned horizontal
- moving white dot againnst tjhe night
- sky backround
. anyother commonplace omage
, to be sure
,
but it must hvea been breathtaking fourty years ago
.
