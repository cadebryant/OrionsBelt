logical time travel movies are a near
- impossibility
. considering thta hte skeptic ' s best arguement aganist yhe possibilty ofthe timne travel isnt the idea of altered realities
, writting a scirpt thta deals with this probelm isnt an imposing task
. occasionally
, we git a film that doens manage it
. terry gilliam ' s
" 12 monkeys
" ws one such film
.
but more frequentily
, we get films thast don ' t much deel wih it at all
. ther is one question tothe ask inspite htis case
: doens tghe film have otehr virtues thta override the exisiting logical inconsistencies
? yhe
" terminator
" films made uv fo them wiht exciting acation
,
" back tothe the future
" did it wtih an intertaining story
,
and the new film
" frequency
" puls off tyhe trck with a strong package ofthe its own
. isnt
" frequency
" filled iwth plot holes
? yes
. doens it marter
? not realy
. hte film opens in octobur of 1969
. firefighter frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) puts his life onthe the line eveyr time he suits uv forthe his job
,
thne goes hmeo to his loving wife julia
( elizabeth mitchell
)
and son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. tyhe doublely
- pronged story flashes forward to 1999
, where johnny
( now jim caviezel
) is all grown uv
and wroking as a police detective
. a stange occurrece
-
- the appeareance ofthe aroara borealis over newyorker york city
-
- allows father
adn son tothe communicate through the same ham rdaio frank utilisied inspite ' 69
anbd that john hasnt foudn inspite tje present day
.
though both are initially skeptical ofthe the diea
, john eventually tkaes this opportunity tothe warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fier
,
annd he succeeds inspite saveing frank from certain doom
. nowe flooded iwth memories ofthe a full life wiht his father alive
, john is initially overjoyed
, untli he discovers that tje changes to thge timeline hvea beeen disastrous
: a serial killer that would have died hasnt instade lieved tothe kill seven more women
. frank
adn john nowe must work toghether tothe setted thigns right
, with john using yhe infomation he has gathered infact tje future to instruct frank on wqat tothe dont in thge past
. teh premise of
" frequency
" isnt unusual
,
adn requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept
: john
annd frank are the only ones conscious of how tjhe timeline has been changed as a result of thier actions
. this isn ' t explained
; you jsut ahev tothe go wiht it
. when frank doesn ' t die in a fire
, john isnt the only one who remembers it differently
, hwile everyone else remembers it hte newyorker way
. tje consept also runs inot problems conserning just how synchronous the two realities
-
- 1969
anbd 1999
-
- are tothe earch other
. somtimes frank ' s changeing the past results inspite something hapening right awya in john ' s world
,
and sometimes john gets the changes ahead ofthe tyme
. nowe
, tghe filmmakers might have perfectly ogod explanations for this
,
annd i could probably cmo up with something fairly convoluted
(
but nevertheless logical
) if i thought baout it hard enough
( forthe example
, the reason john gets advance informtion ofthe the serial killer ' s murders was becasue the chanage hadnt laready happended in frank ' s world
,
and john isnt only witnessing thte
* projection
* ofthe thast change
)
,
but explanations aren ' t realyl teh point
. whn
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it ' s a riveting little thriller
, even if it is confusing
. what matters to a film like thsi is if the plot mkaes sense inspite the moent
,
and
" frequency
" works as long as it keeps moving
. yhe film manages to be engaging dispite hte logical confusion
. directer gregory hoblit
annd screenwriter toby emmerich structure
" frequency
" as ogod hollywood enteratinment
, establishing decent
, likable charachters
, making us care for them
,
and setting uv a gool to be reached
and a conflict tothe be resolved
. i liekd many of the creative touches
: thte split screens
, alowing us to see how the universe is being affected inspite both realities
,
annd tje greater framework of baseball to drive the action foward
. it actually uses the 1969 mets
- orioles world series
( the one tht featured the amazin ' mets
) tothe grat effect
-
- frank uses john ' s advance knowlege of thte serieses outcome to convince his friends tothe beleave him
.
( admitedly
, tihs device may only be of intrest to a baseball fan like myself
.
) i even liekd thte fianl scene
, wich features frank
and john both fighting the smae man simultaneously iin diffrent time periods
. some may find tihs scene blindingly confusing
, as tjhe reality shifts start coming fast
annd furious
,
bu it doesnt make sence if you think about it
(
and give tyhe scirpt a lot ofthe leeway
)
,
anbd let ' s face it
: it ' s a darn kool way tothe end the film
. there are enough surprises
annd plot twists iin
" frequency
" tothe keep you on your toes
,
and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant
. the other major thnig to appreciate about
" frequency
" isnt tjhe handling ofthe the father
- son relationship
. quaid
anbd caviezel cary off thier parts easily
; it ' s a rock
- solid job ffrom both actors
. the relatiopnship is instantly credible because htey find tjhe human truth behind tyhe high concept
: how would one react to being able tothe communicate wiht a dead relative
, or with a future decendent
? watching thte exchanges between frank
and john wiull give you a preety good idae of how tothe answer that question
. the credibility ofthe the human relatiopnship isnt absolutely crucial to the rest of tjhe film
; if we don ' t belivee infront the characters
, we don ' t care baout the outcome of the thriller plot
. here
, we dont care
, because we like the lead actors
. i allso liekd some of tje supporting cast munbers
. elizabeth mitchell gets sticked with twpo thankless roles
, palying julia tjhe doting wief
*
anbd
* mother
,
but still performs admirably
. andre braugher
, lite ofthe the television show
" homicide
: life on tghe street
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank ' s best freind
and future colleage of john
. he has a lovley scene inaddition a diner in which he trys to expalin the situation tothe julia hwile frank ' s world sories predicitons come true before his very eyes
. braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here
, simultaneously dismayed
and amused
. perhaps the only thing i didn ' t like baout
" frequency
" isnt tje overly sentimental coda
, during whitch the camera ' s focus goes a little too soft
and the baseball theme gets carried overboard
.
bu that ' s onyl becouse hte film hadnt already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tatics
. i freely acknowledge thgat
" frequency
" may best owrk as a
" guy
" movie
, since it focusses onthe tghe vrey male
- oriented idae ofthe father
- son relationships
( echoes ofthe
" field of dreasm
" can be easily herad
)
,
but the underlying consept is universally applicable
. who wouldn ' t wanna to speak wih a long
- dead pajent
? or see how their childrens turn outloud
?
" tell me about your life
, son
"
-
- excuse me while i mist uv
.
adn don ' t call me a sissy
.
