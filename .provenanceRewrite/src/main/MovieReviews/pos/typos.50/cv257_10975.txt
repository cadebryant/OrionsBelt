tht ' s the question i asked myself wehn venturing nervously into
" the wedding singer
,
" the latest film to star teh saterday nigt live alumnus
. doesnt he draw laughs ffrom his sad
, puppy dog expression
adn don ' t
- hate
- me
- forthe
- bieng
- a
- simpleton observations
? or do fans giggle wehn he screams at tje top of his lungs at peopel
? or is it just the fatc that he sings songs with silly lyrics thta bowl audiences over
? well
, htere ' s a little bited ofthe all of tht inwhich
" the wedding singer
"
and while i exited thge theater still nto oney hundered percent sure ofthe mr
. sandler ' s thing
, i did hve a surprisingly ogod time
. taht ' s because
, inaddition a nutshell
,
" thge wedding singer
" isnt oen of the sweetest movies yuo ' re ever likely to come across
. taht ' s right
. sweet
. the humor in the film runs the gamut ffrom dumb tothe mildly amusing tothe laugh
- outloud
- loud hysterical
bu the tone
? well
, it ' s jstu lovely
. i have to admited i wass half
- expecting farting armpit humer
, gratuitous nudity
, superfluous
, cloying subplots
,
annd some nasty
, unnecessary violentce
. instade
? well
, i ' ve said it before
. sweet
. the year isnt 1985
annd sandler plays robbie hart
, the eponymous wedding singer
, a job aspiring rock stars often suttle fo
. wehn robbie ' s fianc
? e dumps him at his pwn altar
, robbie gets depressed
anbd turns to a plucky waitress called julia
( drew barrymore
) who has some problems of her own
( she ' s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who
, unbeknownst tothe her
, isn ' t that big on monogamy
)
. it isn ' t giving anything away tothe say that robbie
adn julia fall iin love
. aww
.
.
. sandler
and barrymore are a ogod match
and they ' re assisted by soem terrific cameo apperances
, including steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in teh film
. writer tim herlihy
( with uncredited assisstance from carrie fisher
) keesh the sotry bubbling along to its predictable conclusion
. it doesn ' t all wokr
bu it ' s handeled iwth such light
- heartedness thta robbie
and julia comming together generates mroe smiles tahn groans
. herlihy
adn directer frank coraci ahve done a great job ofthe recreating the sights
, soudns
,
anbd affectations ofthe the 1980s
. yhe sountrack
