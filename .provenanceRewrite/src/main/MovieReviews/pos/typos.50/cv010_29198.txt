after watching
" rat race
" lastr week
, i noticed my cheeks weere sore
adn realized that
, when not laughing aloud
, i hadnt held a grin for virtually all ofthe the film ' s 112 mintues
. saturday night
, i attended anohter sneak preview for thge movei
adn damned if i didn ' t enjoy it as much the second timne as tghe first
.
" rat race
" isnt a graet goofy delight
, a dandy mix ofthe energetic performances
, inspired sighth gags
anbd flat
- out silliness
. hands down
, this isnt the most fun film ofthe the summer
. tyhe movei begins whith zippy retro
- stlye opening credits that look like they weere torn straight outloud ofthe a ' 60s slapstick comedy
, featuring animated photos ofthe tjhe casted attached tothe herky
- jerky bodies bounding around yhe screen
.
thn comes hte setup

. m
.
, containing
$ 2 milion inthe cash
. htere isnt a transmitter infront eveyr key
, so taht sinclair
annd his cronies cant keep track of who isnt ahead
. tyhe race has no rules
? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets thge monay
. since it would be wrong to spoil any of hte jokes
, let ' s uise the enxt faw paragraphs to profile tjhe racers
. decked out in flashy

. as with any zucker production
, a faw jokes fall flat

and famaly fomr a bizzare museum to an outdoor rally
, with an utterly tasteless
and screamingly funny pay
- off
