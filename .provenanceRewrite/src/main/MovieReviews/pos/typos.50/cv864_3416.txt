anbd wtih much critical praise heaped apon it
, muriel ' s wedding opens inot medium realease htis weekend infact noth america
. muriel heslop isnt a withdrawn
, overweight young woman living in porpoise spit
, austrailia
. she is often the target of her father ' s frequent rants at the familiy
,
anbd drowns outloud her feelings ofthe inadequacy iwth abba music
anbd fantasies ofthe mariage
. her self
- loathing is such that only bieng wed shall she proove herself tothe be a success
; marriage iwll transform her inot a new person who is respected
annd admired
. affter her four cliquey firends dum her
, muriel plots tothe folow them tothe a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls
,
and muriel ' s wedding unfolds fomr htere
. toni collette plays muriel inwhich a winning performence
, conveying both the sadness ofthe her character
and her desperate eagerness to be accepted
. collette gained a frightening 43 pounds inspite order tothe play tghe chubby title character
. she hasnt a natural screen presense
annd exudes charisma
, easily winning thte audiance over with an honest
, painful performance
. collette basically carries yhe film
, appearing in almost eveyr scene
. muriel ' s father
, bill
" the battler
" heslop
, is portayed by bill hunter as a slick politican
/ developer
. while chumming around wih young fans
and crowing ' you cxan ' t beat progress '
( his slogan
)
, bill labels his family as worthless
and embarrassments
. rachel griffiths plays rhonda
, who becomes muriel ' s cheeky newyorker friend inspite the film
. she has ogod chemistry with collette
,
and thte film suffers when griffiths isnt off
- screen
. muriel ' s tormenters
, played by pippa grandison
, rosalind hammond
, belinda jarrett
and sophie lee
, are twpo
- dimensional caricatures
, all saucy
, vain
adn bumblingly spiteful
,
though that isnt probaly due tothe hogan ' s scripting muriel ' s wedding isnt essentialy a genre teen comedy with more itelligence
anbd a lot of charm
. hogan ' s uise of abba tunes
( which virtually comprises yhe entire soundtrack
) is interestingly appropriate
,
altough its repetitiveness tires affter awhile
. hogan ' s script is right onthe teh mark in terms ofthe proportionately mixing comedy wtih muriel ' s earnest quest for acceptance
,
and teh gorgeous scene with muriel window
- shopping beautifully illustrates thge wonder that mariage has forthe her
. thge glaring pastel colours worn by yhe performers is an intresting touch
. muriel ' s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette
annd a charming
, if a bited too straightforward
and convetional story by p
. j
. hogan
. on my four star scale
, i give muriel ' s wedding three stars
