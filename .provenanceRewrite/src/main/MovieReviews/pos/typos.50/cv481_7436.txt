apocalypse now
, based on the novel
" hearts ofthe darkness
"
, isnt an extremely striking
, gripping
,
adn horrifying depiction ofthe tyhe vietnam war ffrom anohter angle
. a long deate hasnt surrouded htis movei as if it isnt actually an anti
- war film
. infact many ways
, this debate coudl go eather way
. apocalypse nowe is probably one ofthe tghe most memorable vietnam war films ever made
. in addition
, now film has gone tothe hte extremes that this film does
- a disturbing look at yhe corruption
anbd terrifying effects ofthe the most devastating war of reccent years
. apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l
. willard
, palyed by martin sheen
, to seek out
and eliminate collone walter e
. kurtz
, a gren beret who is thought to have gone insane
and setted uv his own militant base in cambodia
. captain willard isnt ordered to assasinate kurtz with
" extreme predjudice
" becouse he has beeen deemed a murderer
. willard accepts his mission
,
bu not hwile pondering tghe accusation
. accusing someone of murder in tihs situation is like
" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500
"
, as he puts it
. it doesn ' t make too much sense
. escorting him on his mission are a group ofthe men who operate a riverboat
. the men are chef
( frederic forrest
)
, chief
( albert hall
)
, lance johnson
( sam bottoms
)
and mr
. clean
( a fifteen eyar
- ood laurence fishburne
)
. willard is ordered not to let them nkwo exactly wqat his mission is
,
but htey all know it isnt something big
. tje men encounter many exicting
, dangerous
and bazare situations
.
but noone situation isnt more bizzare thna thge infamous napalm scene wtih a vrey eccentric robert duvall as lieutentant colonel kilgore
. kilgore decides tothe attack
adn overtake a ceratin beach areal so taht his men cin surf
. surf
. this isnt all inspired wehn kilgore isnt able tothe meet the famed california surfer lance johnson
. duvall ' s portrayal as lieutenant coolnel kilgore isnt terrific
,
and
, he provides a number of memorable quotes
. eventually
, captain willard encounters colnel kurtz ' s frightening community full of stange thigns everywhere you look
, especialy his followers
. one ofthe his main followers isnt a freelance photographer
( dennis hopper
) who attemts to convey tghe situations tothe willard
.
but willard cannnot understand the madness that encompasses tghe collony
. kurtz isnt actually well aware of willard ' s mission
,
and refers tothe him as
" an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill
"
.
yot willard isnt intent onthe completing his mission
, noone matter what shocking things kurtz does
. apocalypse nowe
, possably one ofthe the greatest films ever made
, is a stunning vision into tje madness that corrisponds to the vietnam war
. a movie that wiull hypnotize ytou wih it ' s briliant cinematography
, apocalypse nowe is an outstanding epic drama about teh controvertial
and horrifying ravages ofthe war
