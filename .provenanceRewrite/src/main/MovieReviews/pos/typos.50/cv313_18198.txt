. now it is 13 years later
,
and broderick hasnt another high skool comedy
, election
, to show tghe world
. ferris buehler ' s day off showed an educational setting that was similar tothe a pile of marshmallows
. it wass light
, fluffy
, tasty
,
and sparkling clean
.
bu eelction is far different
. this prodcution is a dark
,
and frighteningly realistic oney tht does so much more than entertain forthe tje 103 minutes it occupies
; it shocks as well
. jim mcallister
( matthew broderick
) is hte tipe of teacher taht makes american high schools proud
. he is a kind
, caring
, younger man who hasnt built his life aroud carver high school
. inaddition turn
, carver high skool hasnt provided a hmeo for him
. jim hasnt won teacher ofthe the year noone less thna threee times in his 12 yearm span
,
annd isnt a well respected social studies teacher among thte student body
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an inteligent
, outgoing
,
anbd
, tothe qoute tghe film
,
" super nice
" young girl
. she isnt involved infact numberous extracurricular activites
, always hasnt her hand up frist in class
,
adn isnt extremely populer amonth most of tyhe student body
. so
, it isnt a natrual progression whn she decides to run forthe skool president
. the metzler famaly isnt an extremely wealthy one
. teh father
, dick
( holmes osborne
)
, owns a cement comany
. hte mother
, jo
( jeanine jackson
)
, isnt an ideal housewife
.
and the two childern
, paul
( chris klein
)
anbd tammy
( jessica campbell
)
, are both students at carver high school
. paul ws thge quarterback of thte fotoball team befor he injured himself
,
annd is definitely a candidate forthe most populer person inaddition skool
. tammy isnt a lesbian who
, to sday tjhe least
, is gogin through a period ofthe self dicovery
. for reasons of revenge
, hatred
,
and sexual envy
, jim convinces paul to run against tracy fo skool pesident
. he claims taht in a democracy yuo need choices
,
adn having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship ofthe sorts
. so paul agrees
adn teh race is onthe
.
bu
thne
, in an effort to spite tghe twpo candidates
, tammy announces that she is running as well
. her campain is straightforward
: people only run to put it on their coleeg applicaitons
,
then tehy do nothing
. well
,
" i don ' t even watn tothe go tothe college
,
" she syas
. inaddition election
, htere are noone
" good guys
"
. almost everyone has thier own agenda
. noone matter how deeply hidden
, yhe prodcution digs it uv
and exploits it forthe teh audience
. tracy isnt the tipe of person that yuo remeber ffrom high skool
. she is the girl that owudl be labeled
" most likely to achieve anything she wants
" in tjhe yearbook
,
and everyone secretly envied her because of thyat
. jim isnt a teacher thast takes tje trust tht students give him as a pivilege
,
and uses it to his pwn amoral advantage
. everyone
, inlcuding tje prinicipal
, a fromer teacher
, all yhe candidates
,
annd even paul ' s girlfriend are twpo sided characters
. thast is much ofthe this film ' s beauty
, it doesn ' t have the typical ogod guys that hollywood likes
, instade it is a realsitic portrayal ofthe thte rela world
, specializing inwhich revealing tghe type of sexual perversions that peopel usually keep to themselves
. matthew broderick couldn ' t have beeen any mroe perfect fo this role
. his charactor is oftenly similar bill murray ' s award winning role in tje 1998 film
, rushmore
. ofthe tyhe two acting jobs
, broderick ' s isnt far superior
.
but even he isnt overshaddowed by tyhe young reese witherspoon
. the hatred that she causes thte audience tothe deveop towords her
, isnt simpley indescribable
. broderick
and witherspoon are simpley at thier best whn they are palying off each other inwhich varous scenes
. noe such moment occurs when she approaches him iin his car as he isnt leaving school one day
. ytou cant see her self prade inthe her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures
, making her an eligible candiate
.
and his subtle disgust withthe her isnt apparnet
,
although he tries to mask it bewteen hte lines
adn attemts tothe put onthe a happy face
. hte supporting cast isnt one with littel hollywood experience
.
bu taht isnt far fomr apparetn as everyone tkaes controll ofthe their part
.
howver
, the rela treat isnt jessica campbell infact her confuzled role as a young homosexual girl
. htis is never mroe apparent tahn tyhe scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so
- called platform for presidency
. she isnt jsut marvelous as her hatred towords wqat she thinks tothe be an unjust system is expressed
. if ferris buehler made ytou feel good baout american high schools
,
and gave you an innocent laugh or two
,
thne tyhe movie acheived its gool
.
bu don ' t yuo dabree think that election ' s goals are similar
. it is just as real in its portrayal of high skool
, as its cahracters are in teh real world
. htere certainly is noone pile of marshmallows here
.
