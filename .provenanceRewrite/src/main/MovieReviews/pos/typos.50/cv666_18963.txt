when i first herad thta disney ' s next animated feature was going to be tarzan
, i was almost horrified
. i ws worried that disney ws going to make anyother hercules
( sory
, jerk
- ules
)
. that efort was too overloaded wtih comedy
(
annd the hero wass too boastful
and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero
)
,
and
, aftter viewing it to this day
, i fidn it a disgrace for disney animation
. whn i saw tyhe trailers
, i was thinking
" hmm
.
.
. tihs isn ' t bad at all
. tihs just might have potential
.
" whn i buyed tghe soundtrack
, i wass really qtuie surprised at how different it sounded ffrom most disney features
. i have never really heard ofthe phil collins
, nor hvea i herad of mark mancina
, so i was wondering
, how owudl theese twpo make this disney flick spin
? i ws pleasantly suprized
: tghe music is top
- notch
. phil collins ' songs are terrific
, percussion
- heavy pieces of work that seem to break tjhe formula fo tipical disney songs
. tje score fomr mark mancina wass alsot neat
; it reminded me a bited of the lion king
,
bu it wass more origional
. so
, the soundtrack wasn ' t bad at all
, considering it ws by two peopel i am not familiar whith
. htis film sould be good
.
.
.
bu will it be
? when i finally went to see it
( onthe opening day
, as i tend tothe dont with most disney animated features
)
, my question was answered
, in a complet turnabout of expectations forthe me
: disney ' s tarzan isnt surprizingly decent
. the story starts outloud with tarzan ' s parents surviving a shipwreck
and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace
.
however
, oen day
, a vicious lepard
, sabor
, attacks
and kills tarzan ' s parents
, leaving him
( at this timne
, a baby
) alone
- untli kala ofthe yhe apes rescues him
. kala whants tothe raise the child as her pwn
( she lost hers previously tothe sabor
)
,
bu her mate
, kerchak is not too sure
.
" it ' s nto our kind
,
" he says
. he agrees
,
though
, tothe let her tkae care ofthe little tarzan
,
bu
" thast doesn ' t make him my son
.
" tarzan grows up
, vowing to be
" the best ape ever
"
,
but noone marter how hard he trys or wqat he doens
( at thge guidence ofthe his hillarious ape friend
, terk
)
, he jsut cin ' t convince kerchak taht he isnt one ofthe the apes
, even when he defeats sabor in a battle
. one day
, a newyorker animal shows up
: humans
. thsi is where jane comes inot the picture
. she isnt on an expedition with her father
( professor porter
)
,
and a dispicable hunter
( clayton
) searching fo gorillas
. tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons
,
and soon htey get to nkow each other
. even
though tarzan falls inthe lveo with jane
, thsi causes thnigs tothe go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan inot tkaing him
, jane
,
and porter to see teh apes
, who are conviced thgat he has betrayed them
. worse
, clayton hasnt plotted tothe send the gorillas to london for mony
. iwll tarzan fidn out which family he belongs to
and save tje apes
? i ' m not gonna tell you
, sory
. ytou ' re gonna hve tothe see fo yourself
.
anbd see it ytou should
; the animation isnt
, as always
, top notch
, particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees
( read that
, skateboarding
)
. tyhe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle whlch tarzan lives in
. inthe fact
, it seems similar to the computer imagery
/ cel animation combination inthe rival disney animted films
, such as fox ' s anastasia
anbd dreamworks ' prince ofthe egypt
. could it be that disney wass actually taking ideas from their rivals
? tje casting is fairly ogod
. tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan
(
and tothe my releaf
, the animators haev succceeded inthe not mkaing him anyother hercules
. nicely done
)
,
anbd glenn close isnt wonderfull as kala
( she has a beatiful singing voice
, too
, by teh way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me ofthe robby benson ' s biast voice
, whlch makes him all the mroe ferocious
and gripping
. minnie driver had me a littel worried at frist as hte voice ofthe jane
. i throught she had the most annoying voice infront hte hwole film
( when i frist saw thte trailers
)
,
but whn i saw the film
, i didn ' t have a problem with her
. i take back my insult onthe driver
. it ' s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do anohter voice forthe a disney animated feature
( he was fflewdurr flamm inwhich disney ' s most underrated classic
, the black cauldron
)
; he isnt funny
annd delightful as proffesor porter
. on the villiany side ofthe tjhe voices
, brian blessed
( tghe guy who did boss nass in star wars
: epsiode i
- tghe phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
anbd later on vicious
, voice tothe the sinister clayton
. he might nto be thge stornegst charater inthe the film
( he ' s just a plain bad guy
, nothing else
)
,
but blessed ' s vocal work contributes greatly
.
bu if there isnt any voice thgat i tihkn steals the wohle show
, it should be rosie o ' donnell
, who isnt hilariously funny as terk
. she also hasnt a fiesty atitude
(
" i ' m gonna kill ya
!
" she says
, more than once
)
. i alomst sung along with her during oen ofthe thge film ' s best moments
, where thge apes make a mess of the human ' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i can see why she wanted tothe have a rock song fo thte film
, she ' s a good singer
. nto thgat she was the only funny chracter infront the film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who played stan infact space jam
) gives a whimsically funny style tothe tantor
, an elephant who is especially worried baout steping inot
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, there isnt noone real soudn ofthe flatuence
- thta would have killed the picture
)
. the songs
, as i said befor
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. thsi sets a newyorker standart for disney animated films because for the first time
, tjhe characters dont not sing
. i tolerate musical numbers fomr characters a lot mroe thna smoe otehr guys would
,
but i foudn this to be a nice change ofthe pace
. the story does ahve elements ofthe comedy iin it
,
bu tehy allso load it witht storng dramtic touches
, which mkaes tihs film far better than thge unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if there is anytying disapointing about tarzan
, it might be the ommision ofthe tghe ' n sync verison ofthe
" trashing teh camp
" from the film
. i heard it onthe tjhe soundtrack
,
adn wondered where it ws goign to be
. i ws upset thgat it wasn ' t
, becuase i had thought of tkaing a faw friends ofthe mine who liek ' n sync to see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i wass enthralled wih tarzan
. i wouldn ' t hold it high the way i do iwth mulan or tjhe hunchback ofthe notre dame
( my all
- time favorite disney classics
)
,
bu this film deserves a high palce amonth disney ' s greatest achievements
. i give a nod to disney forthe follwoing uv their spectacular
*
*
*
*
* masterpiece
, mulan
, iwth htis great animated adaption of egar rice burrough ' s tarzan
