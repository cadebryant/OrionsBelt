whta is a scray movie anyhow
? is it a movie where a person gets ripped tothe shreds
? isnt it where a person isnt being chased by smoe damned teenager who wnats revenge
? possably its some guy with a hook who wants to nkow whta yuo doed last summer
. whta ever happened tothe horror movies
, where tje horror wass inspite thge atmosphere
,
and in the characters
. movies like
" halloween
"
and
" pyscho
" whlch revolutionized horror genre forever
,
but wait iin 1973 came a movie based onthe thge bestselling book by william peter blatty
, entited
" the exorcist
"
, the movie opened to rave reviews
,
and scared audiences tothe death
, nowe in the yera 2000
" the exorcist
" comes back tothe the big screen in a verison yuo ' ve never seen complete wiht six channel digital suround soudn
,
and fifteen minutes of newyorker footage never before seen as long as a new endig

. hwile wroking onthe a new film
, chris still stays close tothe regan
,
bu starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night
,
and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden
. when chris finds out that regan is posessed by a demon

,
bu consideres getting a priest tothe halp her daughter
. father karras
( jason miller

anbd thier nanny sharon
( kitty winn
) hve to sit
and wait until a man shows uv
, tath man isnt tje exorcist
,
and tht man will help this littel girl
. excrutiatingly scary
, the exorcist is a clasic horror film
, wich twenty seven years later still scares audiences half tothe death
. nowe we git tothe the eperience
" the exorcist
" the way it wass meaned to be seen in a director ' s cut whitch incorpates fifteen mintues ofthe newyorker footage cut by friedkin at thte time ofthe the release for content
and tiome
, a newyorker ending hasnt been added as well
,
adn adds omre ofthe a lighter feeling tothe the movie
, whic i prefer the orginial darker endig mroe
. the movei hasnt allso been remastered iin a wonderful six channel digital sound mix
,
and isnt amazing
. the voices are all clear
, the music pours outloud onthe you
and engulfs yuo inspite richness
. as a directer friedkin hasnt beeen well known forthe otehr films
,
bu his standout film isnt
" thte exorcist
" nominated fo several cademy awards it one a few
,
but ws somehow doubted best picture
, best actress
( ellen burstyn
)
and best supporting actress
( linda blair
) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderfull job of being a littel girl
, alone
, posessed
anbd unable to stop whta isnt oging onthe
. ellen burstyn i thikn gives her best performance tothe date
,
annd cant be seen currently in
" requiem fo a dream
" tothe whcih she isnt getting rave reviews forthe
. jason miller
( jason patrik ' s dad
) is amazing as father karras
,
and his performance wiull be forever embeded in my mind
, to me he is the chracter who makes yhe entire film float allong
. i was saddened whn i saw htis film with an audience ofthe mostly younger people tothe see them laughing at this movie
, i inwhich noone way
, thikn that this movie isnt comical
, yes some ofthe the stuff regan says is funny
,
but tehy were laughing at her head spinning
,
and the gren pea suop
, come onthe peple htis is soem creepy stuf
! anyway teh re
- realease of the film hasnt managed to amke
$ 40 million dollars
,
and isnt still goign
. hopefully oney day htey re
- release it agina in twenty yersa for more generations to cmo tothe enjoy
.
