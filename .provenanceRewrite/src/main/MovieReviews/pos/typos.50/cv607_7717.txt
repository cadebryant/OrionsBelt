- tipe people are alwasy shaking our heads
and telling everyone that movies aren ' t thrill rides
,
bu i thikn that
" bakc to the future ii
" is oen ofthe tje fewd exceptions
. if the original film had hte spirit of yhe 1950s
,
then this hasnt the spirit ofthe tghe 80s
: full of fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; speshal effects
; some detective wokr
;
anbd ofthe course the vision ofthe the high
- tech future
. hte film picks uv exactlly where tyhe firt film left off
, witht doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
,
and jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 years inot the future
, because something bad isnt gogin to happen tothe marty
adn jennifer ' s kids
. doc tells marty he must take his son ' s palce at an incident thyat will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. syas yes tothe griff
( wilson
- in noe ofthe four different roles
)
. whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn ' t joking
, especialy when it comes tothe the movies
. essentially the smae chase scene taht marty endured in tjhe 50s takes place again infront tjhe yearm 2015
,
but it ' s nto as authentically exciting this timne because it isnt so obviously a parody ofthe itself
. at teh end ofthe tghe situation marty hasnt changed the course ofthe hitsory for thte better
,
and it seems liuke everything ' s copasetic right
? wrong
. sicne whn dont thnigs go according tothe plan inthe tyhe
" bcak tothe hte future
" movies
? there are so many minor conflicts
and details thast effect thte plot
and the direction of tghe story i won ' t even bother to list them all
. basically we get to see marty as an old man
, his house
, his family
, etc
. we allso go back tothe an alternate 1985
,
and
thne back again tothe 1955
, with everything happening so fast thte film never stops tothe catch a breath
. tjhe films ' best aspect isnt the fact tyhat it actualy goes back to the frist movie
adn shows a lot ofthe yhe acation that occured from anyother agnle
. it ' s difficult tothe convey the sense of wild
adn zany funn wihtout describing every littel detail
. the onyl thing sacrificed in tihs film isnt the suspense
. instead of a grand finale
, we git lots of little vitories
. by teh end everthing is bakc tothe normal
,
bu something happens thta leads to
yot anyother sequal
,
but it doesn ' t seem gratuitous
.
" back to the future part ii
" isnt a realyl gerat adventure movei
. it certainly hasnt omre originality thna other films
but it lacks a certain charm thgat ws dominate throughout its precedessor
.
