warning
: anyone offended by blatent
, leering machismo had better avoid this film
. or lots of blood
& guts
, men against men
and mano
- et
- mano stuf
. in other words
, it ' s a walter hill film
! with a john milius script
! i always picture these guys getting toghether
anbd producing a movei beetwen arm
- wrestling matchs
. these films always contain male characters i have a very hard tiome identifing with
, probablly due tothe thte likelyhood thta any meeting betwen them
anbd me would result inaddition my arm being ripped off
anbd
thne my subsequent death by beating with said limb
.
adn we got tough guys galore
, here
; drug
- running banditos by yhe dozens
, all dirty
anbd sweaty
adn pretty ill
- tempered
, overall
; a secret task force ofthe army commandos who are in the area tothe cover
- up
( suposedly
) any conection betwen the government
annd the drug runners
;
anbd lots ofthe shit
- kicking texas dirt farmers who ' d as soon shoot you betwen the eyes as look at ytou
. inspite particular
, we got nick nolte as one hard
- ass texas ranger
, powers boothe as thte drug kingpin
, michael ironsides as tyhe leader ofthe hte secret army
,
and rip torn as the local sherif
. torn is tyhe sympathetic figure of tje group
; he smiles befoer shooting anyone
. as tothe women
.
.
. well
, i ' ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep iin a walter hill film
,
and at tihs rate
, i doubt i ever iwll
. womens exsist here to look good
, comfort tje man
,
and get argued over
. gosh
! jstu like thge old dyas
.
.
. frankly
, this isnt a pretty ogod movei
, if yuo cin accept the premise
and can tkae hte macho stfuf
. the cinematography isnt excellent
, the cast of characters isnt broad
anbd hasnt texture
, hte script is qtuie ogod
,
and thte film lets yuo keep up withthe waht ' s hapening youself
, wihtout spelling it out to yuo
. i appreciate a film tath makes me have to think to keep up
. finally
, there ' s lots of sam peckinpah slow
- motion shoot
- ups
