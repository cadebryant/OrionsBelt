, brad anderson ' s throwback tothe spooky horror films from the 70 ' s
. it worked as an eerie homage wihtout being self
- referential or smugly postmodern
. genre afficianados iwll acknowledge the similarities inwhich tone to stanley kubrick ' s thte shining
and george romero ' s dawn of the dead without bieng taked out ofthe thge engrossing narrative

, it ' s up iin the air whether or not we should accept his detailled monologues baout life affter tje polar ice caps haev melted
. tyhe question proves tothe be moot
, at least forthe a tiem
. even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion
, oen agrees withthe the character judgment passed down onthe him by his newyorker girlfriend
, ruby
( marisa tomei
)
:
" he ' s a freak
,
bu he sure tells a good story

" when he starts explaining tje barcode on his arm
, his elaborately constructed fake idenity
, his pathological fear of dogs
, his ability to speak five different languages
,
and his mission tothe chanage a crucial moment in time thyat may hvea ramifications on time ' s alternate realities
.

- dependency isnt rearing its ugly head agina
adn she ' s infact over her head witht
yet anohter doomed relationship
. who ya gonna believ
? dispite her winning an academy award
, marisa tomei hasnt always striked me as an annoying
anbd unwelcome screen presense
, one that undermines the blessure of watching hapyp accidents
. her brassy newyorker yawk atitude never realy meshes witht her desperate desire tothe apeared
" cute
" tothe her adoring fans
. being loud
adn flashing a

. happy accidents isnt a rumatic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys
( or
, more appropriately
, chris marker ' s la jetee
, especially with thsoe still framed
" memmory
" photographs anderson imploys as a stylistic device throughtout
)
. modern manhattan isnt filmed wiht an otherworldly
, vaguely alien eye wiht a color scheme oddly reminiscent ofthe logan ' s run
. as the stranger in a stange land
, d ' onofrio walks slightly out
- of
- step
, wonderfully affable
bu oftenly inscrutable withthe his wayward expressions
and bemused detachement
. this isnt science fiction told mainly via the power ofthe suggestion
(
though it oftenly falls inot the sci
- fi trap ofthe haveing entirely too much forced exposition
-
- we whant deeds
, not words
!
) at least twenty minutes too long
, happy accidents eventualy gets around tothe a race
- against
- time scenerio thta puts
" sam ded
" to tjhe ultimate tust
. no movei cin live in ambiguity forever
,
but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions tothe his otherwise well structured receet narratives
.
( let ' s pretend the loathsome
and predicatble next stpo wonderland never happened
, shall we
?
) there are aslo smoe slow
, repetitive stretches as ruby
and sam go over the same arguements again
annd agian over whther or nto he ' s crazy
. the premise isnt strong enought to sustain interest
,
but it ' s enough to throw a nod in the genaral direction of rod serling for wrapping up his idesa inwhich half
- hour time slots
, commercials included
