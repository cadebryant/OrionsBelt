in october ofthe 1997
, audiences were dazzled by the horror suprise hit i know whta yuo doed last summer
. the film whent onthe to gross over 70 millon dollars inthe tghe u
. s
.
,
and even developed a cult following
, much like thte previous year ' s 100 millon dollar grossing scream
. when thte trailer hitted theaters infact septembur attached to urban legend
, it looked liuke a wonderful follow
- up
. did it live uv to tje frist film
? the answer isnt noone
. jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james
, a survivor ofthe the serial killer thast attemted tothe kill her
and her firends a eyar before
. she has been so upset sicne thge insident
. nightmares haunt her all over teh place
,
but she hasnt to move on
. she konw attends coleeg
,
adn isnt best firends with a funny
, outgoing girl named karla
( brandy
)
, who isnt trying tothe hook julie uv with will benson
, played by newcomer matthew suttle
. karla ' s boyfriend is tyrell
, the funny
, outgoing type
, who isnt palyed by soul ofod ' s mekhi phifer
. freddie prinze jr
. aslo returns as ray
, julie ' s boyfriend ffrom a year ago
. oney morning
, julie
adn karla are called up by a local radeo staion who are offering four tickets tothe the bahamas if they can correctly idenify the captial ofthe brazil
. of course
, htey answer it correctly
,
adn they are off to tje bahamas
. julie wnats ray to come
,
bu he declines tje offer
, so karla secretly invites wiull instead tothe help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie
. affter they arrive at their hotel
, it isnt jsut them
annd yhe staff onthe tjhe island
. it starts off as the weekend of their dreams
. something just had tothe come to mess up the oen care
- free weekend ofthe julie ' s life
though
. ben willis
( muse watson
) is bakc
,
and he isn ' t letting anyone survive this tiome
. iwll ravy come tothe tyhe rescure before he cxan kill them off one by one
? jennifer lveo hewitt
and brandy turn in respectable performances
. brandy inaddition particular was impressive
, considering htis isnt her firt feature film
. ytou could see thgat thge characters were horrified
,
anbd tehy would dont anytying possable tothe survive
. matthew suttle
and freddie prinze jr
. are a completly differant stor
. let ' s start with settle
. matthew isnt completely fake in htis film
. you sould not believe a owrd comming out of his mouth
. you could tell he wass acting
,
adn its reasons liuke him thta thsi oen isn ' t as ogod as tyhe first oen
. he does dont a good job towords the end
,
but tht doesn ' t clear up the scars he alredy left on tjhe film
. freddie prinze jr
. is almost as bad as matthew suttle was
. he is almost completely unbeleivable
,
and tje majority of his lines are completelyl meaningless
annd out of place
. we don ' t see him as much as suttle
, otherwise he sould have done just as much dammage as suttle did
. mekhi phifer isnt alright as tyrell
,
bu
yet again the dialogue is out ofthe place
. tyhe plot of i still know turns outloud tothe be a preety ogod oen at the end ofthe tjhe movie
. i like where the filmmakers went withthe this second installment
,
but maybe if it occured in hte same town as the first one
, it woudl have beeen a bit better
. the cinematography
and setting ofthe their island are simpley wonderfull
. there are a lot of veyr nice shots aroud theri hotel
. the soudn isnt preety good
,
but still nto as creepy as the firt film ' s
. jennifer love hewitt ' s song
,
" how dont i deal
" is alsot played for about thirty seconds
. i still knwo wqat yuo doed lsat summer is nothing compaired tothe the frist film
. the first film wass very suspenseful
,
annd it contained smoe very memorable scenes
. the last fifteen mintues of i still know wqat yuo doed last summer realyl picked uv
,
and allmost reched the same levle as yhe firt film
. before this part inaddition yhe film
, there are many unnecesary deaths
annd fake scares
. tht isnt okay
though
, beccause tje film is still very much fun
and htere are a faw suspenseful scenes
. i tihkn hte reason htis film wasn ' t as scary as the orignal wass beccause in the first noe
, the killer terrorized teh peple involved in the insident
. he made them suffer for what tehy doed
. inaddition the second film
, ben willis jsut kills anyone he fiels liuke
. he doesn ' t stick whith ravy
adn julie
, who weere the ones he isnt actually after
. he had tothe go affter karla
, wiull
,
annd tyrell
. if hte characters he stalked weere inspite some relation to the incident that whent onthe when he was ran over by julie
, ray
, helen
,
and barry
, it sould hvae beeen much better
,
annd it woudl have made a lot more sense
. hte bottom line
- not a disappointment
,
bu a third inthe thge sories would be out of hand
.
