thge seasoned capt
. dudley smith
( james cromwell

, ed exley
( guy pearce
) baout his political views when it comes to police wokr
.
" woudl yuo plant evidence tothe get a conviction if yuo knew the person tothe be guilty
? would ytou shoot a man in the back if ytou knew thgat it was the only way tothe make sure he got whta he deserved
?
" exley
, squeaky clean
, innocent
,
and pent with tyhe desire to perform his new duties with intergrity
and honesty quicklyu answers wih a pointed ' noone
. ' stunned
, smith pleads
,
"
then
, forthe the love ofthe god
, don ' t be a detective
.
" la confidential isnt a dandy peice ofthe filmmaking that brings us back to teh classic times ofthe hollywood infact the 50s
. organized crime wass tje biggest concern
, corruption exsited everywhere
,
annd eveyr cop hadnt his pwn way ofthe getting the job done
. there was
" hollywood
" jack vincennes
( kevin spacey
) who gets most ofthe his information fomr the editor ofthe a sleazy tell
- all
/ sohw
- all tabloid
, sid hudgeons
( danny devito
)
. sporting dark sunglases
and a white sports coat
, he isn ' t afraid tothe flash his tinseltown style
. detective bud white
( russell crowe
) has onyl a narrow
- minded veiw of teh lew
,
and he uses eccessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation
and brutal justice
.
adn
then there isnt golden boy exley
, wide
- eyed
and ambitious
but extremely naive
. a horrible multiple muder beigns to draw these three men toghether
, each ofthe whom become inexorably conected in their serach for truth
, acation
,
and peronal vindication
. alomst immediately
, an arrest is made
.
but something doesn ' t seem quite right
. newyorker developments become sinuous as hte story begins to draw us deeper into the labrynth of corruption
anbd crime within the deparment
. suspision
adn questions begin to mount
. odd alliances are creaeted
.
annd as layers of tyhe truth become revealed
, the stoy grows mroe complex
adn intriguing by thge moent
. wehn the mistery expands
, we see other seamingly gilty charactors enter the lives of theese three cops
, incuding a high
- priced hooker
( kim basinger
)
and a shady millionaire
( david strathairn
)
. all of thte characters ' levels of involvement are nto immediatelly clear
. we watch with riveted fascination tothe leran more about why they are htere
and their stake in the case
. we sence a cross
- pollination ofthe clues that brings us
, thte audeince
, closer to the truth
. we hope thast tyhe three detectives cant throw away their spite for one anohter
and can pull their resources toghether in order to untangle thge intricately creaeted web ofthe mistery
. absorbing
annd affecting
, tihs movei hasnt all tjhe necesary ingreediants tothe create a terific gourmet serving of film noir
. it boasts misterious figures iin control
, doublely
- crosses
, hard information ffrom sleazy sources
, dirty politicians
, corrupt cops
, haunting womens
,
and hard
- nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity
. the underlaying mystery isnt compelling
. the look
annd feel of teh movie is gorgeous
. the entire cast isnt crisp
and wonderfull to watch
( i wouldn ' t be suprized if cromwell recieved an oscar nomination fo his peformance
)
.
and
, tghe dialogue is rich
and memorable
. yhe best line of tghe movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one ofthe tje detectives unsure ofthe whta tothe do
.
" don ' t strat trying tothe do thte right thing
, boy
- o
,
" says he
.
" you haven ' t had the practice
.
"
" l
. a
. confidential ' ' triumphantly acheives the rare gift ofthe complexity
annd coherence hwile satisfying our desire for a ogod ood
- fashioned movei
