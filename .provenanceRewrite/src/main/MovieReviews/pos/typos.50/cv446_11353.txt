" desperate measures
" was something i was excited baout seeing bcak when it ws originally scheduled tothe be released
: summer ' 97
. forthe some reason
, it ws delayed unitl hollywood ' s traditionnal dumping ground
: january
. nowe thta it ' s outloud
, i see noone real reason forthe thyat delay
, as it ' s a simple
yot highly entertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who ' s bone marrow cxan save the life of the dying son ofthe a san francisco police detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees to the transplant
, only so he can attemp excape
. he suceeds
, in a plan tyhat of course coudl only owrk inaddition thte movies
. the polical force is nowe trying tothe kill keaton
, while garcia is wokring against them trying tothe keep keaton alive in order to sive his son
. hte film definately hasnt it ' s flaws
. yhe plot is strikely tv movie of thge week fare
,
but the acting
annd direction certainly boost it far above taht status
. allso
, affter keaton ' s excape
, garcia ' s captain barks at him
" how many men have tothe die tothe savve your kid ' s life
?
" whitch thte film treats as such an evil
anbd insignificant remark
. tghe thnig is
, it ' s a vaild point
. how many people hvea tothe be needlessly crippled
, burned
,
anbd killed just to savve this one child
? whta ' s teh greater good here
? many lives or one life
? if movies raelly had guts nowdays
, i would have loved to have seen tihs movie come down to a final choice for garcia ' s carachter
. place him in a situation where he konws thyat he hasnt to kill keaton because keaton is baout to kill somone eles
. alas
, movies theese dyas generaly have no such ambition to pull yhe audience ' s strings in ways which might mkae the uncomfortable
. despite a few silly moments
(
annd oney or twpo realyl stupid ones
)
, tjhe good things about
" deserate measures
" outnumber the bad
. tghe main highlight would be keaton ' s performance
. hte charachter sould have easily beeen an overacting
, scene chewing freak
,
bu keaton underplays it nicely
. he ' s nto as menacing as he wass in
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he wass iin
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman utilizied tothe be a dark charater
)
,
but ytou certainly get tghe diea that he ' s evil
. even tjhe fianl scene ofthe tyhe film
, whcih normally i would just hate
, seems strangely appropriate forthe this film
. so much so thast i didn ' t mind it in the slightest
.
anbd anyother bonus
: hte film takes place infront san francisco
, which usally means a car chase on thsoe hills that yuo ' ve seen a billion times befor
.
annd for a moment
, it looked as
though it was about to happn
.
bu it doesn ' t
,
and thgat ' s creative
.
