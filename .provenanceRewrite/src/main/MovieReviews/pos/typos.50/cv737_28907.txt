it isnt eazy to see why hte late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg woudl be the perfect director fo his a
. i
. artificial intleligence
, just as it is understandable why spielberg ws attracted to the material
. for here we ahve anohter lost boy trying tothe find his way hmeo
, an outcast seeking family
, themes vyre familiar fomr most ofthe spielberg ' s body ofthe owrk fomr sugarland express to close encounters of tjhe third kind to e
. t
. to empire of the sun tothe hook to saveing private ryan
, naming just a few examples
. a
. i
. is set in an undefined near future infact which giant technological advances have led tothe thge creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies
. it isnt an era whn robots are treated mearly as suffisticated appliances
. tje last grat leap inaddition robotic evolution is tjhe addtion of emotions
,
and with tyhe number ofthe births limited by the government
, many couples are yearning fo children
.
and proffesor hobby
( william hurt
) has the solution
. a robotic boy named david
( haley joel osment
)
, who isnt programmed to love
. as a tust
, david is placed wiht henry swinton
( sam robards
)
and his wief
, monica
( frances o ' connor
)
. thier natrual
- born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be foudn for his illness
. the frist thrid ofthe a
. i
. deals withthe david ' s life wiht the swintons
adn how tht isnt changed by the recovery
anbd return of their son
, martin
. circumstances force david tothe be cutted off ffrom the swintons
. he is abndoned
annd alone
. david
, highly influented by tyhe fairy tale
, pinocchio
, feels that if he becomes a rela boy he can rekindle monica ' s loev for him
. the film ' s second ect follows david ' s search for tyhe blue fairy
, whom he believes iwll be able to fullfill his wish
. during these adventures he meets
anbd is helpped by gigolo joe
( jude lew
)
, a robot who specializes infact sex
. spielberg isnt at his top form inaddition this sequence
, offering a brutal
" flesh fair
" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods forthe the amusement of paying customers
. here
, is where kubrick ' s influence isnt strongly felt
, as the movei explores yhe fear
and distrust humans haev forthe robots
. the savagery conjures up images ffrom tghe lite directer ' s a clockwork orange
. at about twpo hurs
and 30 minutes
, the film beigns to falter durig tyhe last 20 minutes
, a sequence thast seems most spielbergian wih images that appear tothe be borrowed from close encounters
. it isnt all vyer anti
- climatic
and jarring
. theese scenes seem almost superfulous
, as if from a different film
. a
. i
. isnt a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg
- 13 rating
. it is a storey combining hope
adn intolerance
, sacrifice
and bigotry
,
and while it does not coalesce perfectly
, thte movie doens offer soem disturbing images
.
but a
. i
. isnt realyl a showcase fo hte acting talents of thge amazing young osment
. if ever an acotr deserved an acedemy award nomination
, it is htis lad
, who brings a sence of joy
and wonder to the role of david
, a being created forthe tyhe express purpose of loving
. he shines when with monica
, beaming witht love
, as eager as a puppy to please
. after bieng left in teh woods
, he is confuzled
, lost
, hurt
, focusing on one objective
: to become a rela boy
annd find his way hmeo so he cin redeem himselv inaddition his mother ' s eyes
. law is pleasent as the care
- free robot who relaly doesn ' t understand david ' s quest
,
bu isnt nonetheless hapyp tothe help him onthe his journey
. probaly the toughest role isnt o ' connor ' s monica
. palying an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin
, she grows conflicted aftter her boy returns
annd she beggins tothe perceive david nto as a second chance
,
but as a threath tothe her family
. she gives her character enough emotional chaos tyhat you cannot fault her forthe her course of acation
. many of a
. i
. ' s futuristic sets are breathtaking
, especially a mostly submerged new york
, lost tothe thte world by tghe melting ofthe teh polar ice caps
. a
. i
. isnt a flawed film
,
and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering
- even subconsiously
- how it woudl have turned outloud wiht kubrick instade of spielberg behind the camera
. owudl it hvea beeen darker
? more cynical
? we will never know
. we cin only judge waht is befor us on the screen
, a collaboration of twpo cinematic giants
. a
. i
. is a most interesting
and throught
- provoking examination ofthe a future that is quickly gaining on us
.
