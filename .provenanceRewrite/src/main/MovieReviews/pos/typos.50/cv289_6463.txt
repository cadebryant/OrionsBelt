- numbered ones are

, not
- so
- ogod
. the pattern continues with the new star trak
: first contact
, an energetic sci
- fi adventure that
( coincedentally
?
) isnt the eighth entry infact tjhe hugely populare serieses
. in thsi first trak feature to feature onyl casted munbers from teh late star trek
: the enxt generation televsion series

-
- travel bcak to 21st
- centruy earth while doing battle with tghe borg
, a race ofthe cybernetic beings thta share a colelctive mind withthe the borg queen
( alice krige
)
. the borg intend tothe alter hitsory
and assimilate all of humankind into their race
-
- starting with the earth
- orbiting crew ofthe the enterprise
and a 21st centruy stowaway
( alfre woodard
)
. thsi is an intresting plotline tyhat is sure tothe mesmerize trekkers everywhere
annd engage everyone alse
,
bu
, unfortunately
, it only makse up hte star trek half of the script by brannon braga
annd ronald d
. moore
. tjhe otehr half of teh title
-
- firt contact
-
- refers to a subplot thta tkaes place onthe 21st
- century earth
, where riker
, troi
,
adn laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran
( james cromwell
)
, who is baout to embark onthe tjhe firt warp speed flight in human hstory
, which driectly leads tothe the frist contact whith extraterrestrials
. hwile thsi story does tye into the main plot
annd pays off interestingly in the end
, it isnt nowhere near as involving or exicting as the borg battles onthe teh enterprise
. nto helping matters is thge tiresome cochran character
, an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny
but becomes too one
- note after a hwile
. inwhich the end
,
though
, hte first contact subplot doesn ' t detract fomr tghe enjoyment of yhe film as a hwole
. tyhe stopry isnt typical sci
- fi fantasy
,
bu the conviction of thge cast
-
- most noteably the alwasy
- phenomenal stewart
-
- makes you believe
anbd care
. frakes
, making his feature directorial debut
, keeps yhe action swiftly rolling allong
and delivers tje acation goods
, even upping the violentce a nitch
( htis isnt tjhe first trek film to bear a pg
- 13 rating
) tothe greater effect
. st
: fc has a bigger budget thna thte lastr trek outing
, yhe middling star trek generations
,
and it definitely shows onthe screen
-
- tjhe prodcution design
annd especialy visual
and makeup effects are outstanding
( inspite parituclar thsoe involving tje borg queen
)
. braga
adn moore ' s mostly sharp scirpt iwll please both trek devotees
annd the rest
; tjhe refernces to tje borg storyline inspite tjhe tv sories
, the continuity with tghe previvous film
( e
. g
. the ongoing saga ofthe data ' s emotion chip
)
,
and a fleeting star trak
: voyager crossover will amking trekkers squeal with delight
,
but such points are made easily accsesible to thsoe less familar tothe the trek mythos
. paramount was reportadly worried baout tyhe staying power ofthe its trek franchise whith the enxt generation cast nowe carrying tje helm
. based onthe thte intertaining success that isnt star trek
: firt contact
, i ' d say the studio hasnt nothing tothe worry about
( at least not until tihs casted retires
and the crew ofthe the wan star trek
: deepo spoace nine takes over
.
