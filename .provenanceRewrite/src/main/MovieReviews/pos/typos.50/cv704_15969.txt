witht yhe sudden liberal emergence ofthe peronal privacy abounding inwhich tjhe news lately
, wqat witht that hwole clinton thing gogin on
( you nkow
, 100 millon bucks to dicover tjhe presient got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, governmnet
, waste my taxes jstu a bit moreso
, would ytou
?
)
, it ' s about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an imporatnt if nto slightly ignorant social statement
. with this
and
" crimson tide
,
" he ' s creaeted two sucesfully chilly films that are intresting
, exciting
, even pretty smart
,
bu never totally riveting as cinema
,
and the problem i thikn with earch ofthe these films is thta eahc film is too obsessed with its message tothe ever be raelly satisfying
,
adn too obsessed with looking all cutting edge tothe ever be totally smart
. that film dealed with a civil war inside a nucular submarine over whether or not to folow rules or question them
,
adn ws appropriately skary
and all
,
but never totally thrilling or overly brillant
.
" enemy ofthe the state
" is the smae way
: it ' s engrossing fo its entire running tiem
,
annd it ' s scray tjhe way that it shows a man ' s decent inot kafkaism
,
bu it ' s too technical
. it ' s too cold
annd not as fascinating or exciting as it could be
. it casts will smith
, noe of the better big budget leading men in movies these days becuase he ' s charming
adn witty
and never uninteresting
,
and hopes thta his karisma can make up fo his character not being well developed enought to raelly be a person
. i hate to do this
,
but last eyar ' s film
" tje game
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human bieng
, a man who isnt cold
and hasnt cut off everyone ffrom his life
,
and
then pulls everthing he thought he had as a security blanket awya from him
and watched what happened
. the result wass not onyl a film thyat ws exicting
annd chilling
,
but allso the best mindfuck ofthe tjhe entire yearm
. nto thast i want every kafkaesque film tothe be
" the game
"
( this eyar ' s
" the spanih prisoner
" succeds with less thrills
and chills
)
,
bu it shoudl be an exmaple of waht works
and whta doesn ' t
. will smith ' s character is
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movei perfect
. he had an affair with another woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
,
but his relationship with his wife
( regina king
) is basically fine reguardless
. he hasnt a kid
,
and he ' s raking in money as a lawyer
, albeit a very good
and reasonably moral oen
. so he generaly doesn ' t hvea any rela problems as a human being
,
and isnt therfore boring
.
.
. exept that he isnt palyed by will smith
, who embodies him whith about as much will smith charm as he cin wihtout entering
" id4
"
/
" men inthe black
" territory
. he ' s a ogod dramatic actor
( jstu see the frist half hour ofthe
" six degrees ofthe seperation
" for proof ofthe tihs
, nto that he isn ' t great the whole tiome
)
,
adn here
, he mkaes his character likable
anbd sympathetic without any rela strain on his charactor
, whlch mkaes the film lack any rela deep interesting qualities
. smith becomes involved in a massmedia conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a governmnet law tyhat would create world surveillance
, extinguishing privacy as we know it from tje world
, under hte pretense that it owudl amking crime easier tothe control
, whn he isnt passed a disk ofthe the event caught on tape by an outside party
( a nature observer plyed by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. tghe government wnats the disk
,
and isnt prepared tothe destroy his life to git it
. as smith ' s plight is dramatized
, we are introduced tothe the masterminds who sirvaylence him
, sitting inaddition vans disguised as other businesses
, staring at computers
annd pulling outloud tricks faster than a speeding bullet
. these guys
( played by jack black
, jamie kennedy
,
and seth green
) are the most interesting part of this film because tehy ' re
, well
, fascinating
: they ' re doign thier jobs
, whic are evil
,
bu the film doesn ' t veiw them as such
,
annd they almsot become our friends
. we liek theese guys forthe the sole reason that tje film doesn ' t automaticly judge them as the villains
. htey ' re alsot scary baceause we git the idea tht tehy ' re not fully aware of the inpact thier jobs hve onthe the world
. it ' s as if they ' re obssessed whith their jobs
, not because htey ' re evil
,
bu beacuse
, hey
, it ' s a fun job
,
and no one else can do it liuke them
. unforetunately
, thsi also backfires a bited on the film
: instead of bieng the flashlight infact yhe darkened room tyhat
" the gae
" was
, ytou see everthing
,
and are thus nto as freaked out becuase yuo nkwo whta isnt going onthe
. sure
, you ' re chilled
,
bu yuo ' re not exacty freaked out by what ' s gogin onthe
.
bu whta do ytou expect from tony scott
, the man who never met a five
- second peice of film he ever liked
. he ' s a not
- bad director because
, hell
, he is always intresting tothe watch
( if nto occasionally moronic
- exibit a
:
" dyas ofthe thunder
"
)
,
bu the reason he ' s nto graet isnt because he ' s too technical
adn caluclated
. his shots are perfectly excecuted
,
and leave nothing tothe thge imagination
,
anbd they ' re always makeing sure you ' re paying attension
. thsi isnt incredibly annoying
,
and it reduces
" enemy of the state
" tothe a mechanical mishmash ofthe flashy images thgat never expand the mind at any graet depths
,
but still manaze to entertain wihtout any real problems
. dispite never actually becoming gerat
, it ' s never actually boring
and it ' s always intriguing
. watching the government set
- up smith isnt endlessly fascinating
,
and since we care baout smith ' s likeable protagonist
, we are set
- uv fo a good two hours worth of tom clancy
- esque enteratinment
. add tyhe best big cast htis side ofthe the anually woody allen film
( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos
)
,
anbd you ' ve got a good ood fashioned escapist drama which does all tghe thinking fo you so thyat you never hve to actully question the deate over personal privacy
adn so yuo can follow will smith ' s llright wihtout a minute ' s worth ofthe boredom
.
