.
but believe me
, this isn ' t your regluar sourth park tv sohw
,
and should nto be seen by anyone under 14 or omre
. this film contains extreme profanity
( over 130
" f

and a collection ofthe others
)
.
bu beyond bieng bad inwhich a tasteless tipe way
, sourth park
: bigger
, longer
