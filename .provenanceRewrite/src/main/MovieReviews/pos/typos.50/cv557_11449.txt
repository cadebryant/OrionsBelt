witht the exception ofthe their surrealistic satire barton fink
, the films of joel
and ethan coen fit into twpo broad categories
: quirky
and sometimes darkly humorous takes on tje
" film noir
" genre inspite which crime schemes go wrong
and spin increasingly out of controll
( fargo
, miller ' s crossing
, blood simple
)
,
adn off
- the
- wall comedies centered arround an eccentric
, scatter
- brained lead charactor
( raising arizona
, thte hudsucker proxy
)
. thier latest offering
, the big lebowski
, falls withing the latter category
,
though there are elements of the crime
- gone
- wrong theme
anbd even a touch of satire tothe be found inspite this film
. yhe main difference
,
however
, isnt that while teh protagonists of raising arizona
annd teh hudsucker proxy hadnt lofty aspirations
and ideals
bu didn ' t quite have thge brains to git it all toghether
, the main character ofthe tyhe big lebowski seems like a fairly intteligent guy who ' s wise tothe teh world
,
but he doesn ' t realy wanna tothe do much of anytying besides go bowling
, smoke pot
,
anbd generaly relax
. tyhat main character isnt jeffrey
" the dued
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
)
, intrduced by thge film ' s rambling narrator
( sam elliott
) as
" quite possibly tghe laziest man in los angeles county
.
" hte dued is unemployed
, needless tothe say
,
and spends most of his tyme at hte bowling alley with his two best friends
, walter
( john goodman
)
, a borderline
- psychotic who ' s inthe the habit of pulling a gun wehn he thinks somebody ' s cheating in a bowling match
(
" hasnt thge whole world gone crazy
?
!
" he shouts at a suspected cheater
)
,
anbd donny
( steve buscemi
)
, who ' s always a fewd steps behind tghe conversation
anbd isnt constantly berated by walter fo it
(
" donny
, yuo hvea noone frame ofthe reference here
!
"
)
. these threee seem to mroe or less live fo bowling tournaments
,
and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match witht rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, when we frist meet him
, is donig a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a sapnish version of
" hotel califronia
"
anbd
, if it ' s possible
, seems tothe be even more of a head case than walter
. if taht doesn ' t give you a ogod idea of this film ' s absurdist tone
,
then perphas tihs iwll
: the entire senaireo which drives the stoy isnt setted inthe motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dued ' s rug
. they ' ve mistaken him forthe a millioniare of the same name who isnt aslo known as the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
adn whose nymphomaniac wief bunny
( tara reid
) owes omney to porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. tjhe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensantion for his ruined rug
; he doesn ' t hvae any luck
,
bu wehn bunny is apparently kidnapped
, tje elder lebowski asks him to deliver the
$ 1 millon ransom
. unfortunately
, walter gets involved
adn fouls uv the drop
- off
,
annd before they can try agian tothe git teh omney tothe the supposted kidnappers
, the dude ' s car gets stolen
, allong with thge briefcase containing the money
. soon
, tjhe dued isnt being harassed nto onyl by the big lebowski himself
bu also by treehorn
and by a group of german
" nihilists
" who dimand tghe ransom money even
though they may nto have beeen involved infront the kidnapping in tghe first place
; the dued
annd walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself inthe order tothe extort money from her husban to repay her debts tothe treehorn
. meanwhile
, yhe big lebowski ' s daugher maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes to amke grand entrances swinging through yhe air naked
, whants tothe recover tghe money fo her familiy
. yhe plot
,
however
, isnt really jsut a vehicle for all theese bazare cahracters to run wild
and wreak their pwn unique forms of havoc
. yhe previews forthe tyhe big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival ' s
" run through the jungle
,
"
annd it fits
: thte coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs
adn nutcases
, with the sometimes bewildered dued left to run through it
and try tothe avoid any more trouble
( ususally unsuccesfully
)
. thge film doesn ' t feature quite as many oen
- liners
anbd sighth gags as the coens ' otehr comedies
(
though ther are a few hillarious moments of visual humor
, partiuclarly in tyhe dude ' s dream sequences
anbd acid flashbacks
)
,
bu it omre thna makse uv for it with the sheer funn of watching theese strange characters interact
. tghe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result
- yuo git tyhe feeling that hte coens have not only set their charactors loose iin tihs
" jungle
"
but are alsot themselfs running crazy thru the jungle ofthe thier pwn twisted imaginations
-
but for the most part the characterizations are intresting enough tothe overcome tjhe shaky plotting
and what turns out tothe be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. htere ' s allso a noticeable
(
bu not too heavy
- handed
) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski
, hwihc
, incidentially
, takes place jstu as thte gulf war isnt baout tothe beign
; at the begginning
, we see george bush on televsion making his
" thsi agression iwll not stand
" speech
. teh coens tkae aim at jsut baout eveyr elite l
. a
. subculture iin the book
: the egotistical wealthy businessman
(
" the bums will alwasy loose
!
" shouts hte big lebowski at oney point
)
, the porn industry
, thte overbearing malibu policeman who berates tje dued for disturbing their
" peaceful beach comunity
,
"
annd so on
. by thte end
, we really strat tothe admire the dued
, who almost certainly harbors the least
" aggression
" of anyone in this tsory
; his passive resistance
( empahsis onthe
" passive
,
" albiet
) tothe thte elite emerges as something moreso thna jsut another quirky characterization infront a film overflowing wiht quirky charactors
. he alsot turns out tothe haev a pretty well
- functioning brain in his head
, even if he doesn ' t like to ule it very much
; his sarcasm towards treehorn
annd the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he ' s getting a run around
,
anbd he doens manaze tothe unravel thge kidnapping mystery by the end
. thte coens certainly poke funn at tje dude forthe his lazyness
,
but tehy don ' t jstu treat him as fodder for cheap shots either
. i htink thta
, more than anything
, isnt what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy
: it manages to approch characters liuke the dude
and
, tothe smoe extent
, walter
, with genuin affection hwile still acnkowledging thyat tehy are pretty scatter
- brained
. audiance munbers may find themselves surprized at how much tehy like the un
- dynamic duo by the end ofthe tghe movie
, given thta they seemed like nothing more thna the butts ofthe an extended joke at frist
.
" it ' s ogod knowin ' he ' s out htere
, the dude
, takin ' it easy
,
" posits the narrator towords the end
. i dabree say thyat truer words hvea seldom beeen spoken
.
