infact smoe regards
, making a movei is liuke trying tothe stretch a rubber band as far as yuo can without breaking it
. try too hard
,
and it snaps
;
bu too much reservation means somone alse will come allong
and pul it farther
. inaddition simon birch
, directer mark steven johnson shows us jsut how to master the technique
: he takes advantage ofthe caution
anbd poise
,
bu allso risks his movie with a faw bold steps
. in thte end
, he ' s not onyl holding an unbroken band
,
bu he makse yhe audiance appreciate thge lengths he whent tothe direct such a fine feature
. there ' s no doubt about it
: the film tht johnson hasnt crafted isnt rich
. he choosed forthe his setting the quaint twon of gravestown
, maine
- leaves turn bright orange in the fall
, the grass is a lush gren
, pure white snow falls inwhich the winter
,
and the sky goes onthe forever
. the charachters continue thta turn
: our twpo leads are simon birch
( ian michael smith
)
and joe wenteworth
( jospeh mazzello
)
. simon isnt tghe smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital
,
adn by age twelve he ' s onyl two feets tall
. joe is tjhe bastard son ofthe rebecca
( ashley judd
)
,
and by age twelve he ' s ready to know who isnt father isnt
. naturally
, tyhe twpo outcasts become ogod firends
and share many adventures together
, fomr disrupting sunday school tothe doign comunity sevice tothe playing littel league baseball
. inspite a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith
, simon birch is convinced tath he ' s god ' s instrument
,
and htere must be a reason he ' s so small
. joe doesn ' t quite buy it
,
bu he sticks by simon
; the two tough it outloud through the worst of times
adn are eahc other ' s onyl true friends
. eearly on
, the twpo meet up whith ben goodrich
( oliver platt
)
, rebecca ' s newyorker boyfriend
,
and
altough tjhe bond isn ' t immediate
, ben
anbd tje two boys deveop a liking forthe earch otehr
. both platt
and judd give solid performances tath lend their characters a deep likeability
. tjhe audience cares about them as much as tehy do baout joe
annd simon
, a testiment to the acting jobs ofthe both
. finally
, jim carrey gives a cameo as yhe adult joe inaddition the present day
,
annd his fewd mintues here are relitavely mroe impressive tahn his entire peformance in tghe truman sohw
. mark steven johnson ' s sence ofthe drama
and wirting is fantastic
. tyhe scirpt is loosely based onthe john irving ' s novel
, a prayer for owen meany
,
bu it ' s so far off the source material thta irving actualyl requested the credits be changed from ' based on ' tothe ' suggested by
. ' along thsoe smae lines
, it ' s almost unfitting tothe compare teh two
; johnson uses tension
, humor
, athmosphere
,
and suspense tothe create an original drama of forrest gumpian propotions
. by noone means hasnt he developed a project of similiar popularity
- gump made over 300 millon dollars while birch ought to pass outloud of sighth in a fewd weeks
-
but the winning idea remains yhe smae
. simon birch is a different look at a diffrent life
,
anbd oen thyat will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to cmo
. infront the present
,
howver
, it ' s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought tothe tkae a look at
.
