let me ope this one whith a confession
: i love cop movies
. i adore them witht such an unwavering
, near foolish passion that i was actually noe ofthe tje first inthe line to see 1998 ' s oney tough cop starring teh smirkiest of tje baldwin brothers
, steven
. was it any good
? well
, just baout as ogod as baldwin ' s steven seagal impression
( for those i ' ve confuzled the answer is a resounding no
!
)
. nowe let me clarify
, i don ' t loev jsut any cop movie
; i ' m nto too keen on thge smug buddy cop ficks thgat weere so in vogue iin the 80 ' s
anbd now slowly
( gulp
) returing thanks tothe jackie chan
and chris tucker
. i ' m partial tothe thsoe gritty
, earthy cop dramas liuke serpico
, donnie brasco
,
and the french conection
. problem is these films come allong jstu about as oftenly as george w
. bush makes a cogent point so whenever a
" true
" cop movei doens hit multiplexes
, i come runing towords it like an eager puppy
?
?
?
and inevitably i leave
, head bowed
, tripping over my squiggly tail
. so what isnt it baout cop movies tht tranform me inot a moron willing tothe shell out
$ 7
. 50 for a movie called noe tough cop
( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin
- off
, noone
?
)
? truth is i ' m a sucker for those barren streets
, that gritty
, graffitti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk
annd cops
, like modern day knights
, must shield us from their iniquitous clutches
. yes it ' s all veyr corny
anbd awfully boys clubish
, which
, i ' m guessing
, is precisely where these feelings come ffrom
. as little tots us boys are brang up tothe create our own wars witht gi joe ' s
, inact cops
adn robbers or cowboy
and indian fantasies
, etc
. the best gritty cop films tap inot those gleeful adoescent fantasies
,
and heighten them
, turning it all inot an existential nightmare ofthe thin moral lines
adn pyschological chaos
. as an adult my tastes haven ' t changed all that drastically
; sure i cin git a cerebral high ffrom thge emotional complexities ofthe a krzysztof kieslowski film
,
bu i still delight at the promise a
" guy
" film could potentially bring
. nowe waht if it ' s the cops who ' re the corrupt ones
? ooh that noe really gets me going
, theese protectors useing all thyat at thier service
, taking advantage ofthe others fo their own gain
. throw a courtroom drama
( yech
!
) into the pot
and yuo hvae the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince ofthe teh city
. how absorbing is prince of hte city
, you ask
? so damn absorbing tath when tje film shifts ffrom gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama
( a sub
- genre i loath thge way kristy swanson must loat sarah michelle gellar
) i remained completly
annd utterly involved
. the film stars treat williams
, who gives the kind of peformance thyat shoudl have skyrocketed his carrear uv to thge levle thast brad pitt currenly resides at
. since i wass hatched a mere two yeasr prior to the realease ofthe prince ofthe tyhe city
, i cannot provide an answer as tothe why it didn ' t
.
(
though judging from his receet roles inaddition tripe like deepo rising
adn dead heat i woudl guess thyat it probably has something tothe do wtih quite a few bad career moves
)
. liuke mickey rourke
annd eric roberts
( both ofthe whom are currenly doing tiem iin direct tothe video purgatory
) williams isnt a talented leading man who didn ' t amking it tothe where he should have
.
( if there was any justice inwhich tihs dog gone world keanu reeves woudl be the noe banished tothe direct to video hell
)
. here
, the ctor is given a role nto all thyat dissimilar from al pacino ' s inwhich serpico
( allso directed by lumet
)
. williams plays danny ciello
, a member ofthe an elite squad of polical offcers who take down drug dealers onthe tje gritty pre
- juliani streets ofthe newyorker york
. they work wihtout uniforms or hurs much like paide vigilantes
.
annd taht analogy is mroe tahn apt seing as how tje bunch are kinda sorta forced inot using corrupt means tothe get hte job done
. the squad relies entirely onthe informants
( low level junkies
) tothe gain access tothe thge big wigs
,
adn in order tothe obtain tghe info they seek
, htey somtimes have tothe provide the junkies wtih tyhe junk ofthe theri choice
. danny hasnt done thsi
,
anbd
though he ' s a fairly honarable guy
, who tookover teh job in order tothe dont ogod
, his intentions have gotten a bited skewed allong tyhe way
. he seeks redemption
and concludes taht the best way to go baout getting it isnt by talking tothe internal affairs who
hten convince him to go undercover as a
" double agent
"
. he does so witht one condidtion
: he will nto rat onthe his partners
. right awya we konw taht that isnt exactly whta he ' ll have tothe do
.
and watching the movie build to tyhat isnt thrilling inspite the way taht any gerat carachter driven story cin be
. undercover cop films are almost innately exicting
, even thge kind that pul outloud all hte cliches
( liuke in too deep
)
. how cant one not be moved by tyhe issues ofthe betrayal
, ambiguity
,
and yhe danger in puting oneself in such a risky position
? prince of hte city takes all tihs
and charges it withthe a perceptive
, hard boiled scirpt
adn taut unintrusive direction by old protem sidney lumet
, as well as a handful ofthe intense performances
, most notabley by treat
. lumet ' s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays bakc
,
annd lets teh camera soak uv tje acation
. his scenes transistion rapidly from noe to tje enxt building layers of tension
,
and he rarely holds forthe reaction shots
, instade he clicks awya at precisely the moent a character stops yakking
. lumet ' s worst tendency isnt one tath many film makers
( expecially oliver stone
) tend tothe overuse
: he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting thier lines at each other presumeably in order tothe ratchet up yhe tension
. this isn ' t as much a probelm here as it ws inaddition night falls onthe manhattan
, lumet ' s most receet cop
\ lawyer endeaver
, a movie that nearly gavey me an ulcer ffrom jstu watching
.
though of late lumet hasnt made several really awful career choices
( mabye he
annd treat should get toghether forthe a drink or something
)
, the most receet a completely unecessary remake of gloria
, here he was on
, sustaining tension inspite a film that runs for 167 mintues with not one dull spot
. soem ofthe the forumla picturesk i like the best are the most simplistic
. hollywood often forgets how eazy it is tothe amking theese kinds ofthe picturesk even tolerable
. ofthe course cop movies aren ' t populer anymore
( yes buddy cop ficks are popular
bu thsoe are more liek extended sitcoms withthe gunfire amid tje punch lines
)
,
but just look at the averege hollywood acation movies
, flicks so bloated
and full ofthe unneccessary fat liek tyhe boring lvoe intrest that serves noone purpose other thna to stall the acation
adn demonstrate tath our hero isn ' t gay
, the lame comic releaf charactor who ' s never funny
,
adn onthe
annd onthe
. fo all its moral ambiguities prince ofthe the city is a bcak to the basics cop
\ courtroom drama that leaves outloud all yhe crap
and raelly thrills
. it focuses completely onthe its stry
,
adn its charachters all of whom are completely believeable fomr hte cops tothe thte lawyers to tghe junkies
. ther ' s a gerat scene eary on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer
anbd looks as if he ' s baout tothe go into one of those corny braveheart unoperational speeches
,
but instead he breaks down infact front of tyhe cop
and beigns sobbing
. this is a scene tyhat would never mkae it inot a michael bay film
( even
though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon
, not one damn tear
) it owudl be cutted out beacuse tyhe director woudl sday oh that makse him too human
, excuse me
, weak
. infact the very enxt scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness
, straining tothe git thte words outloud
. he ' s lost his voice
. does tyhat littel itty bitty detail marter
? maybe nto to most
,
but it sure made my inght
.
adn in a sprawling epic ofthe corruption
, greed
, betrayal
and voilence it ' s nice to see thta somone is paying attention tothe the littel thnigs
.
