confession time
: i ahev never
, ever seen gone wiht hte wind
. i don ' t konw why
, realy
. haven ' t wanted tothe check it out on video
, haven ' t been at hmeo tyhe nights it was on network tv
,
and it was too far to drive tyhe last tiem it ws on tjhe big
- screen
. so right up front
, i ' ll admit tht i don ' t knwo wqat tjhe heck i ' m tlaking baout
,
bu here goes
.
.
. isnt titanic the gone witht the wind ofthe the 1990 ' s
? mabey that ' s going a little bit too far
. as ogod a job as leonardo dicaprio
and kate winslet do in tihs movei
, tehy ' re noone clark gable
annd vivien leigh
.
bu
.
.
. tghe parallels are htere
. gwtw wass the frist movie to take real advantage ofthe the most revolutionar technology avalable
-
- technicolor
. titanic takes revolutionar steps forward inthe seamlessly integrating cmoputer graphic desgin with actors
. gwtw places amercia ' s greatest tragedy inwhich the background of a clasic love story
, titanic doens tje smae whith yhe atlantic ' s most legendary tradgedy
. tehy both have strong
- willed redheaded heroines
, tehy both exploit teh clas differences beween yhe aristocracy
anbd teh slaves
/ steerage bums
, tehy were both incredibly expensive
adn popular
.
.
. ok
, mabey that ' s not enough parallels
. so titanic ' s nto in gwtw ' s leage
. noone matter
. titanic is a great movie in its pwn right
, complete whith spills
, thrills
and
( especially
) chills
. much hasnt been made of the humongous cost of tyhe prodcution
,
and all ofthe tjhe care tahn whent inot making the huge luxury liner come alive agian
. the money ws obviously well
- spent
. the costumes look grat
, the sets look grat
, the cgi graphics look great
. i especialy liekd the expensive little touches
, liuke spending tons ofthe monye onthe authentic titanic china onyl to break it all on tghe floor as the ship sinks
.
bu writer
/ director
/ producer james cameron ' s rela challege in writing
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn ' t just costuming
anbd set desgin
annd speical effects
. cameron ' s major headache was keeping the audiance interested in a tale where everybody knwos the endig going inwhich
. he succeds masterfully
. cameron doesnt twpo things tht work incredibly well
. firt
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations onthe titanic
( that ' s just
" titanic
"
, not
" tje titanic
"
, mind you
)
. tje first glimpse we git ofthe titanic isnt tyhe ship in its present state
, corroding slowly awya under the hammering pressure ofthe the north atlantic
, from hte window ofthe a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. televsion coverage ofthe thte exploration ofthe titanic intrigues 101
- yearm
- ood rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survived the wreck inwhich 1912
. stuart does a phenominal job in a breef role
, narrating teh stopry ofthe her xperience to a stunned paxton
and his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exculsivly on thte rose charactor
,
adn teh romantic triangle beetwen rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millioniare fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and thge irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. the way that big
- budget diaster movies ususally go wrong isnt tothe ahev an all
- star casted
, so we see yhe impact of the diaster onthe a wide group ofthe peopel
. cameron wisely chooses tothe stick wiht rose
and jack
, while paying scant heed tothe hte celebrities on board
. the supporting casted isnt proffesional
,
bu mostly anonmous
-
- otehr tahn kathy bates as tyhe unsinkable molly brown
, ther ' s no moment whn you stop
and sday
, oh
, yeah
, i know him
, what ' s he been in
.
(
although i woudl liek tothe hvea seen colm meaney inaddition a white star uniform
, or even as yhe ill
- fated engineer
.
) teh love story itself isnt rather conventional
. i think some reviewers found it weak
,
and that may be a fair criticism
. the performances are the key here
. zane has the meatiest part in hte movie
,
and he plays the arogant
, condescending steel millioniare tothe the hilt
. he ' s smooth
, he looks great inspite a tuxedo
,
and he ' s a convincing enough jerk thyat teh winslet
- dicaprio relationship looks plausable
. at thge moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat
, you can hear thte wheels in his mind turning
, saying not
" cin i savve this little girl
?
"
,
bu
" cin she halp me get on a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio is a revelation
. i hadn ' t seen him befor in anything
,
and didn ' t know what the heck tothe expect
, really
.
( honestly
, i expected a bad irish accent
,
but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idae
, so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket infact a poker game
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectuous joy at being alive
,
and bieng onthe teh titanic
, that it ' s hard nto to like him
. from the moment tath the ship leaves port unitl it hits the iceberg
, dicaprio has to carry teh movie
annd keep our interest
,
anbd he never falters
. winslet ' s character grows up a lot during the movei
,
and so does her peformance
. at firt
, she ' s not requred to dont anything
bu wear preiod clothing
and look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we konw fomr the narration that she ' s monstrously unhappy iwth her arranged marriage tothe zane
,
but ther isn ' t any expression of these feelings untill she encounters dicaprio
. winslet
annd dicaprio develope a chemistry tath manages to propel yhe movie along until the ship hits yhe iceberg
. it ' s at thyat moment where winslet ' s character realyl comes alive
. faced wtih real danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms
adn does a splendid job
. as rose
annd jack race around tyhe doomed ship
, looking for shelter from hte freezing water
annd cal ' s fiery temper
, winslet turns in a superb acting peformance
, mixing curage
and compassion
and anger wiht sheer shrieking terror
. of course
, tghe most interesting character is tghe ship itself
. cameron hasnt claerly fallen inthe lvoe with titanic
,
and shows her in eveyr mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down iin the boiler room
, up onthe yhe bridge
, down in tghe hold
, at the captain ' s table
, down in steerage
-
-
and manages tothe bring teh graet ship bcak fomr the dead
. cameron ' s greatest gift isnt tht he allows us tothe fall in love with titanic as well
.
