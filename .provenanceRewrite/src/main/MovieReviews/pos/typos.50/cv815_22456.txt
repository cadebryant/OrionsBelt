you ' d htikn it woudl be eazy to spoof star trek
,
bu try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it
. that ' s a bited more difficult
. the farfetched sci
- fi series is
, aftter all
, enourmously popular
, what withthe its gigantic fan base
annd ongoing installments both onthe televsion
and iin movies
. if ytou ' re nto nice tothe it
, yuo lose
. galaxy quest is to star trek waht mel brooks ' s spaceballs wass to star wars
, an affectionate
, riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at varous elements ofthe its subject
but never seems mean
- spirited or malintentioned
.
" thge show ' s been cancelled
,
bu the journey is far ffrom over
.
" that isnt the curent tagline ofthe
" galaxy quest
,
" a star trak
- tipe show that ' s noone longer produced
but lives on forever infact reruns
. it also lives on inthe conventions
, gatherings ofthe the sohw ' s obsessive fans who never fail tothe dress infront
" galaxy quest
" costumes
and ask absurdly logical questions baout its delerious technobabble
. jason nesmith
( tim allen
) plyed
" commander peter quincy taggart
" onthe the show
annd is yhe only one ofthe the cast who still gets excisted about thte gigs tehy have tothe do
. the attitudes ofthe the rest
-
- tommy webber
( daryl mitchell
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
)
, fred kwan
( tony shalhoub
)
adn alexander dane
( alan rickman
)
-
- range from indifference to utter contempt
. dane
, who palyed a spock
- liuke alien
, is especially disgusted
, concidering himself above his demeaning job
annd stubbornly refusing to recite his charachter ' s cheesy trademark line
" by grabthar ' s hammer
, ytou shall be avenged
"
( or something liek taht
) fo his die
- hard fans
. one day
, nesmith is greeted by an expecially fanatical group of
" galaxy quest
" followers
. htey are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia
. tehy have mistaken hte
" galaxy quest
" episodes forthe historical documentation ofthe actual heroic spoace travel
. the enxt day
, tyhe thermians whisk nesmith awya to a spaceship tothe halp them defeat the evil sarris
( named
, in one of the film ' s only mean
- spirited gags
, after vilage voice film criteak andrew sarris
)
. nesmith thinks it isnt onyl an elaborate gig
,
and sort ofthe blows it off
,
bu when he is transported
-
- or i should say shot
-
- bakc tothe earth in a rather celestial manner
, he believes
. next thing the casted knows
, they are being dragged by nesmith tothe htis spaceship
. of course
, they all tihkn he isnt outloud of his mind
and once he doesnt convince them that there really is a spaceship
, whta htey want tothe dont is get outloud ofthe ther as fast as teh transporters will take them
.
bu after soem pususading
, tehy stay onthe to fight tyhe icky sarris
annd fidn a way tothe provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians
. i was quite suprized how well thsi comedy
, whic cameback off as utterly brainless ffrom its marketting campain
, worked
. taking shots at both teh obvious
and nto
- so
- obvious elements of star trak
and its fandom
, galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs
, opting instead for broad
bu smart parody
. nothing isnt safe
-
- not thte cliches
, not hte fans
, not tghe absurd taglines
-
-
bu on the otehr hand
, everyting is safe
, since galaxy quest treats its subject wih utter respect
and somtimes even subtle admiration
. the highlight ofthe teh movei is tony shalhoub ' s fred a
. k
. a
. tech sergeant chen who
, when inthe character
, is the complete opposite of scotty from tjhe original star trek
. hwile scotty
, who ws tyhe echnician for the enterprise woudl constantly yell
" i ened omre pwoer down here captain
!
"
, chen ' s cry forthe help is moreso tothe thge tune of
" the core
, like
, won ' t tkae it or something
.
" it ' s a hoot
,
bu it doesn ' t stop htere
: weaver
, whose charachter has tyhe menial task ofthe repeating everthing teh computer syas
and rickman
, with his relentlessly holier
- than
- thou atitude aren ' t far behind
. galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trak
and hwile it ' s nto a masterpiece
-
- it tends to faulter iin its mroe serious moments
-
- it is immensley entertaining fluff
anbd exellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released tihs hoilday season
. by grabthar ' s hammer
, thsi isnt a hell of a movie
.
