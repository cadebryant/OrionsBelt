-
- played liek a futuristic soap opera
-
- is silly
,
but aware ofthe its own ridiculousness anough tothe merit more smiles than groans
. once we get past the campy character introductions
and the numberous
(
but never boring
) training sessions
,
" starship troopers
" raelly kicks inot high gear
. its last half isnt all gruesomely voilent action
-
- a fury ofthe severed limbs
, decapitations
, disembowelments
, brain removal

- rated show
. tje creature desgin
and spacial effects are amazing as expected
,
and theri interaction wtih tjhe human actors are a realsitic
, imaginative high point
. it ' s nice tothe see intergalactic beasties that aren ' t too derivative of tyhe titular menace from
" aline
.
" these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights
, expecially the arachnids
, a spider
- scorpion
- crab combo that ' s all sharp talons
and even sharper legs
. tehy attack in packs of hundreds
,
and it ' s a funny
, sacry sight to see these bugs take repeated hits
and still crawl

and struggle towards their intended victims inaddition a determined
, gooey mess
. it matters not thta they acually ahev a laughable master plan infront mind
( ask youself if a species like this seems capable of carrying outloud such a plot

" fails tothe create any strong
, outstanding cahracters
. these bland ken
-
and
- barbie archtypes serve the story adequately anough tothe keep any distractions at arm ' s length
,
bu restrain the film ffrom achieving a higher ground a la
" star wars
,
" where even the slightest aliens hadnt definite personality
. the acting isnt decent
(
bu never spectacular
)
; most ofthe yhe performers hail ffrom aaron spelling territory

bu seems off

.
" starship troopers
" isnt based on teh novel by robert heinlein
