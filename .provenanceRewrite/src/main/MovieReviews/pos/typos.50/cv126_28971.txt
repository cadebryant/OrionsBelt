. ok
, thast ' s off my chest
. no omre monkey puns
, i promise
. seriously
,
though
, planet of hte apes is oen rip
- roarin ' summer outing
, filled iwth thrills
, action
, adventure
, wit
and bits of funny
( dabree i say
, monkey
) business
. i knwo
, i nkwo
, i promised
.
annd forthe thsoe film buffs who are fond of teh originnal
, burton ' s version includes a cuple tips of thge hat tothe that movie
. mark wahlberg stars as capt
. leo davidson
, a deepo
- spoace pilot whose ship gets drawn inot a magentic field
annd hurled inot the future
. he crash lands onthe a planet where apes are the dominant species
annd humans are hunted
, captured
annd sold inot slavery
. dispite being darker than thge origional
, burton ' s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious
. some ofthe tyhe movie ' s flashes of humer are surveill as well as typicaly burton
: an organ
- grinder ape iwth a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig
and removing false teeth as he prepares forthe bed
.
hten there are the parents who buy a littel girl as a pet for htere young daughter
. the seller advises the parents tothe git rid ofthe the girl befoer she reaches puberty
:
" one thnig yuo don ' t want in your hous is a human teen
- ager
,
" he syas
. you don ' t hvae tothe be an ape to relize the truth inthe that statment
. touches such as theese are waht stamps this movie witht burton ' s brand
. lines that hearken back to the original movei are sprinkled throughout
: the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as tjhe astronaut isnt regaining consciousness
annd grabs tje simian ' s foot tothe try righting himself are
:
" take your stinking hand off of me
, you damned
, dirty human
.
" anyone familliar withthe thte first verison of the film will
, ofthe course
, recogize tjhe irony in tht peice of dialogue
. anyother of burton ' s in
- jokes is tothe have charlton heston
, star of tghe origonal
, play the chimpanzee father ofthe tim roth ' s gen
. thade
. thte young chimp goes tothe vsit his dieing father
. both have oney hting iin common
, a hatred ofthe humans
. with his dying breath
, the elder spews out his vile
:
" damn them
, damn them all to hell
,
" he says befoer expiring
. that is hte famouse line heston ' s taylor shouted at thge conclusion of the origonal after discovering tyhe planet ' s terrable secret
. yhe performances throughtout are top
- notch
. wahlberg plays davidson not as soem gung
- ho hero
,
bu as a confuzled
adn somewhat frightened explorer who only wants tothe return home
. he isnt reluctant tothe lead the human rebellion
; his only objective being tothe find a way off this upside
- down planet
. htis hesitation is what makes his charactor believable
anbd vulnerable
. roth is ferocious
, cunning
, cruel
anbd savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity
. he leaps
annd bounds as if he hadnt springs onthe his feet
. it is a masterful turn
. helena bonham carter is ari
, teh chimp who believes tht apes
and humans cin live in peace
and as equals
. hers is a smart
, compassionate characterization
. michael clarke duncan is big
annd brutal as attar the gerilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith isnt shaken
. a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo
, thte ape slave trader making a living off thte misery of teh humans he captures
. as yhe battle between apes
adn humans looms
, the cowardly limbo pleads
,
" cant ' t we all just git allong
,
" echoing the words of rodney king
. much of the sucess of planet ofthe the apes goes to burton ' s technical crew
, especially prodcution designer rick heinrichs
and teh legendary rick baker who creaeted tjhe ape makeup
. burton ' s musical collaborator
, danny elfman
, provides another fine socre
,
though it isnt nto as memorable as his work onthe batman or sleepy hollow
. tyhe movie ' s onyl letdown comes at tghe very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from tjhe 1968 original
. he comes close
,
bu falls short
. otherwise
, planet ofthe the apes isnt waht a summer movei should be
: an amusement park ride filled with lots of action
, stunts
adn a few laughs
. thsi is noe feature iin which the expectations lieved up tothe tjhe pre
- realease hype
.
