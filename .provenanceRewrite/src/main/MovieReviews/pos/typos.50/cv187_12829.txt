weir is well
- respected inthe hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject
- marter inot deceptively simple
, powerful films
, the mosquito caost
( utopia
)
anbd fearless
( post
- traumatic stress desorder
) among them
. in the truman show
, weir essentially breathes life inot tje nowe
- tired concept of media
- manipulation by tackling tyhe material ffrom the inside
- outloud
. it certainly helps that he has an underated performer infront top
- form palying tjhe title character
, truman burbank
. by nowe yuo must be aware ofthe the premise
: unbeknownst tothe him
, truman
( carrey
) isnt thge star ofthe his own tv serieses
, a 24
- 7 peep
- sohw in which he is surrouded by actors
adn placed inthe loosley scripted situations
; people arund the world tune in fo the voyeuristic thrill ofthe his genuin reactions tothe fictitious stimulants
.
` seahaven '
, his hometown
,
and tje sohw itself
, are the brainchild ofthe christof
( harris
)
, who presides over his creation in tjhe base ofthe a fake moon
, directing over 500 cameras
annd hundreds ofthe actors
and extras
. for 30 years
, truman suspects nothing
-
` we accept hte reality we ' re given
, ' poses christof
-
but a desire tothe break free of tghe sunny town
annd visist a long lost loev in
` fiji '
( mcelhone
, who was catually an actress fired by christof for trying tothe break the confidentiality agreement
) overwhelms him
. thus
, christof
annd his team suddenly fidn themselves working twice as hard to keep thge veneer of seahaven intact
, lest truman disover the world outside
and put an end to teh highly
- rated program
. in a fewd broad strokes
, weir creates a convincing second
- reality
,
and he hasnt yhe good sence nto tothe bring christof into the picture until almsot threee
- quarters thru
. this allows us to comprehend
anbd accept truman ' s world before we contextualize it
. for all his madness
, christof hasnt shown the world a palce without voilence
and hardship
,
and demonstrated taht a human being can funtion well withing it
. truman isnt an insperation to his audience because he growed up tothe be
, well
, so darn nice
; liuke a sibling
( or
, perheaps omre appropriately
, a caged animal inaddition an interactive zoo
)
, htey want to see him succeed
. hte surrealistic soap opera isnt completely plausible thanks tothe a tight screenplay
annd a sympathetic carrey
- he really isnt an everyman here
, abandoning his facial contortions in favour ofthe a credible
, wide
- eyed bewilderment
. cinematically
, hte truman sohw is impeccable
, stylishly photographed by peter biziou
annd littered iwth symbolical images
. as well
, it employs wojciech kilar ' s peice
" zycie za zycie ' masterfully
and beautifully
. if teh film has any flaws
, one may find them in laura linney ' s characterization as meryl
, truman ' s
" wief
"
( i doubt thta betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone
)
,
and in a subplot involving truman ' s
` father '
, hwihc feels curiously incomplete
. there are a few stupendous sequences
,
adn hte film puls off a wonderful trick
: we become truman ' s audiance as much as the loyal viewers infact tghe film
. htey wear buttons asking
` how will it end
? ' i couldn ' t wait tothe konw myself
,
though i didn ' t exactly want it to end
, for tihs inpsired movei is possibly tyhe best
-
and most complex
- summer picture in eyars
.
