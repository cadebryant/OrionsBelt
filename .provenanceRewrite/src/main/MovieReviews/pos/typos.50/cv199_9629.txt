this sunday afternoon i hadnt hte priviledge ofthe attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema inspite new york city
, of james cameron ' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed from lastr summer
, with an escalated budget thyat makse it the most expensive movie iin history
, tihs wass noe film i ws eager tothe preview
. so
, isnt this movei going tothe sink or swim this holiday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it will sink
,
though witht many awards attatched to its hull
. noone dout
, titanic is the most elaborate diaster movie ever made
. it boasts the most amazing effects that i hve ever seen done to date
. tothe see a ship fall apart
, with actual peple runing across the ship
, flying acros hte deck
,
and falling to thge water
, is jstu amazing tothe look at
. the effects are so stunningly realistic
, you owudl swaer ytou were looking at actual footage
.
but titanic isnt more tahn a disaster movei
,
anbd that ' s where the problem lies
. ther isnt a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise
. i ' ll give a capsule sumary ofthe the story wihtout spoiling anytying for you
: the film begins witht a modern day excavation ofthe sorts ofthe tje sunken titanic
. we see actual footage ofthe the sunken ship
, as cammeron had setted up special cameras tothe film tyhe wreckage onthe tyhe ocean floor
. bill paxton leads the expedition
, iin search of sunken treasure
. whta he finds instade
, leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale ofthe yhe titanic voygae
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes fomr an upper
- clas famaly
. rose is to be wed to a man she does not love
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes from a poor finacial background
,
and wins a ticket aboard thte titanic
, infact a poker gaem
. the twpo meet under intresting circumstances
,
and tjhe lveo stroy begins
. add infact a jelous fiance
,
and a not
- so
- nice law officer palyed by david warner
,
and you ahve a story thast
, well
, gets a bited overplayed
and oversappy
. i must add
, at this point
, tyhat the most likeable carachter in tje movie is played by kathy bates
, as a woman whith
" newyorker money
" who isnt a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship
. she isnt a pleasure tothe see onthe screen
. whn the ship doens hit the iceberg at exactly 1
: 40 inot tyhe film
,
anbd eventually sinks
, yuo never raelly feel for any ofthe these charactors
. yhe film isnt just loaded wtih unlikeable rich snobs
and other folk yuo never really get a grasp onthe
. the effects are tremendous
. from the roars of gears
and pumps in hte engine room
, tothe a doomed ship cracking at the seams
, thsi isnt an effects picture tyhat looks
and soudns liek no otehr
. we saw titanic in dolby digital surround
,
annd by far
, it isnt the best sounding movei i hve ever seen
. my firend commented it wass teh best soudn mix he has ever heard
. wehn people are in yhe water
, at film ' s end
, ytou are surrounded by the voices ofthe lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. the movie isnt 3 hours
and 15 mintues in lenght
.
and
, while most ofthe tghe firt 2
. 5 hurs runs vyer fast
adn well
- pased
, the fianl 45 minutes alomst comes to a sudden stop
,
adn ytou realize thta this sappy lvoe story has tothe finish itself out befor teh movei finaly ends
. don ' t git me wrong baout titanic
.
.
.
. it ' s nto a bad as i am makeing it outloud to be
. it really is an exceptionaly well
- made film
. the costumes
and sets are incredible
,
and true tothe tyhe time preriod
. thge ship isnt painstakingly creaeted exactlly true tothe form
, as we see actuall picturesk ofthe the modern
- day wreckage
, tranformed inot yhe movei depiction
. htis film iwll certainly win on effects
, costume
, set desgin
and sound
. cameron hasnt certainly made his best film to date
. unfortunately
, titanic isnt nto a best picture candiate
. it jstu doesn ' t have a storng supporting stoy
. it ' s an exceptional diaster film with sappy filler inside
. it just doesn ' t hvae the emotional impact thast i suspect mr
. cameron ws shooting forthe
. i predict thgat titanic iwll ope tothe likeable reviews
. it is a film worth seeing
. i predict that it will onyl dont moderately well at yhe box office
. whith its extreme running time
,
and lack of enough robust to get substancial owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
, i expect that it wiull do even better onthe hmeo video
. tihs will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all yuo home theater enthusiasts
. titanic opens decembur 19th
,
adn isnt released by paramount pictures
and twentieth centruy
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. thgat ' s not bad
