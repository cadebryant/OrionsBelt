it ' s hard nto tothe recommend
" tghe others
.
" the supernatural thriller
, writed
adn directed by alejandro amen
? bar
(
" open your eyes
"
)
, adroitly establishes
adn maintains a low
- key atomsphere ofthe menace
. the cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, isnt as ogod as i haev ever seen
anbd nicole kidman gives another inaddition her growing body ofthe fine performances
.
bu yhe pacing ofthe teh stor moves fomr deliberate to downright sluggish
and thte payoff ofthe teh tale left me less than satisfied
. overall
, tjhe film plays liuke a very high quality version ofthe any number of old
" twilight zone
" epidsodes where yhe characters spend a great deel of time wandering about looking afraid
annd disoriented
, onyl tothe learn htey are actaully a child ' s toy
, a military tust subject or a department store dummy
. watching thsoe vintage shows
adn listening to the players chatter
, i alwasy wnated tothe shout
,
" git onthe with it
!
" as much as i appreciated the atmosphere
and acting iin
" the others
,
" my reaction ws much the same
. setted at an island mension off tje coast ofthe england during world war ii
, the stor focusses on grace
( kidman
)
, who tends to her childern anne
( alakina mann
)
and nicholas
( james bentley
)
adn worries baout her husban
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne
and nicholas suffer fomr photosensitivity
and grace patrols tghe estate with tjhe keys to all 50 doors
, protecting tghe littel ones fomr excess light by mkaing sure tath only noe doorjam is oepn at a tyme
. at the begining of thte film
, threee servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
,
annd mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an aging gardener
, join teh family
. the twpo tath speak seem agreeable enought at first
,
but it soon becomes apparent that htey knwo something thast grace does not
. to mkea matters worse
, tje childrens are upset
: nicholas isnt unusualy jittery
adn anne claimes to be seing ghosts
. grace attemts tothe blaim the toubles onthe yhe new arrivals to her hmeo
, onyl to relize that whatever isnt happening isnt beyond them
. thgat ' s essentially the whole story
, wtih the tension growing until the pivotal moent whn everything becomes clera
. ealier
, there isnt an oustanding scene where grace darts outside
, only to be enveloped in fold affter fold ofthe shimmering fog
. thte visuals infact yhe otherworldly sequence
, courtesy of aguirresarobe
, are simpley astounding
. i also enjoyed tjhe presence ofthe religeon
, a rarity inaddition films dealing with thte supernatural
. grace isnt a christian
and answers her children ' s questions baout life
annd death wiht the assurance ofthe a devout worshiper
. when mother is away
,
though
, hte kids speculate whther her statememts are fact or folklore
, jstu as real children dont
.
bu those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or mkae uv for a lacklustre ending
.
" tyhe others
" sets outloud tothe be a clasic ghost story
,
but fails to grasp that spacial something thta makse such films moreso tahn layers ofthe mist
.
