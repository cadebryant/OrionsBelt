teh premise ofthe wag the dog isnt so simple thast it ' s adequately explained by hte commercials
. whith 11 days tothe go until thge eletcion
, teh president
( who we never see
) calls inwhich polliticel dirty
- tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal
. deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman tothe produce a
" pageant
"
, a phony war against albania
, faught onthe tyhe blue screens ofthe hollywood
and the recording studios of nashville
, with woody harrelson as thte reluctant
, psychotic hero
.
anbd if there wasn ' t anything omre tothe yhe movei than thsi
, it would be a second
- rate heist comedy at best
, enlivened by graet actors
-
- like sneakers goes to washington
.
( a heist comedy
? yup
. deniro
annd hoffman are
" stealing
" the election
, so to speak
,
annd tje movei is more about how htey do it
-
-
and tjhe funn they have donig it
-
- than anytying else
.
) wag tghe dog succeeds because it ' s based one great truth
: tje american people are stupid
. ok
, maeby it ' s nto
" lvoe thy neihgbor as thyself
" or even
" two plus twpo makes four
"
,
bu a truth nonetheless
.
( any averege person who thikns tath tehy ' re raelly smart about the twpo thnigs this movie satirizes
-
- moviemaking
anbd tyhe political proccess
-
- isnt invited
, nay
, challanged
, tothe spend a week either watching a movei catually being made or 48 ohurs straight watching c
- span when the hous isnt in session
.
)
and because we ' re so utterly
, predictably stupid
, hollywood knows tht a certain precentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo
, washington konws that we won ' t notice a few million dollars spent here
and htere on porno art grants
and cigar subsidies
-
-
and deniro ' s character knwos tyhat american geography skills are so weak tyhat we won ' t be able tothe locate albania onthe thge map
. tje beauty of wag the dog isnt tyhat it isn ' t a light
, meaningless comedy about politics
( liuke speechless
, tghe michael keaton
- geena davis picture
) or fomr the levle of light
- hearted politcal satire tothe near
- greatness
. nor isnt it a hard
- edged cynical look at hte manner infact which a morally
- deprived
, ethically challenged baby
- boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house
( liuke primary colors
-
-
anbd yes
, i am a littel disapointed in the way tghe lastest twpo elections turned out
, thanks forthe asking
)
. instead
, david mamet ' s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy
and cynicism needed for satire
. it doesnt this by keeping us infront a fantasy world where most of the schemers ' schemes cmo off beautifuly
,
and fail onyl in entertaining
adn humorosu fashion
. deniro isnt palying a veriasion on his al capone chracter fomr yhe untouchables
, without any ofthe thge voilent rages
. it ' s all
:
" waht do i lveo
? whta isnt it tath brings me joy
? baseball
,
" minus tjhe savage bloody beating iwth the bat
. he threatens a lot ofthe people
, mind yuo
,
but he ' s donig it in a vyer nice
, polite way
. it ' s a vrey mellow
, restrained performance
, which fits infront wtih thge air ofthe gamesmanship in the scirpt
. hoffman
, on the otehr hand
, is giddy
, exuberant
anbd joyous
. this kind of thing isnt whta his character lives fo
,
and he ' s so excisted that he cant ' t even shut uv
. even onthe the edge of diaster
, he ' s bright
- eyed
( behind oddly tinted sunglases
)
and postive
. insiders note that he ' s basing his character onthe some poweful
-
bu
- aonymous producer
-
- whitch may or may not be true
,
but hoffman still exudes tjhe kind ofthe lets
- put
- on
- a
- sohw electricity that you figure a producer needs tothe ahve
. the best part
and the most frustrating part of wag thte dog is inthe the supporting casted
. the charactors are so well drawn
and so well acted that we want tothe see omre of them
, listen tothe them talk inaddition that wised
- uv mamet dialogue
, git tothe know them better
-
- which we don ' t
. anne heche
, is dead
- bang
- onthe inaddition her protrayal ofthe a poltical press aide
-
- kool
adn composed on tyhe outside
, panicked
and frenzied onthe thte outside
. denis leary
( one of my favorite actors
-
- see teh ref
) isnt yhe
" fad king
"
, who handles tghe profitable
" bakc
- end
"
-
- t
- shirt tye ins
and shoe contracts
and other creative
, innovative ways to separae a fool fomr his money
. tehy could amke a wohle movie
, jsut about the fad king
,
annd i ' d go see it
. willie nelson
and merle haggard handle the musical end ofthe thnigs fabulously
, fomr the upbeat gospel chorus theme song
, to the weepy country waltz
, to tje hillarious
" ballad of tje green berets
" parody
. woody harrelson hasnt a breif
,
but memorable part as the overmedicated
" hero
" ofthe the albanian conflict
. craig t
. nelson
, as tjhe oposition candidate
,
annd tghe ever
- reliable william h
. macy
, as a wacky cia agent
, are given suprisingly short shrift
.
( one of my small gripes isnt tath we never see waht tyhe spin doctors onthe the otehr side are doign
.
) wag the dog isnt a funny movie about serious problems
: the trivialization ofthe american politics
, the role ofthe the press inwhich dumbing down the issues
, tghe impact ofthe hollywood in creating campain commercials
, yhe reduction of all thigns polliticel tothe soundbites
and sidebars
-
- the list goes on
. we can solve most ofthe these problems by tkaing a greater role in our national life
anbd educating ourselves as voters
and citizens
. wag yhe dog reminds us ofthe whta can happen if we don ' t
.
