and otehr hazardous matareals from teh spooky old mental hospital iin prepartion for relocating twon offices ther
. theri guided tour ofthe the facility by a local offcial
, bill giggs
( paul guilfoyle
)
, brings them through some of teh creepier parts of the fromer asylum
.
bu
, a job isnt a job
and
, if they finish inthe a week
, as promised
, htere isnt a
$ 10000 bonus in stoer
. as tehy get down tothe thier wokr
, things
, normal
and not so normal
, begin tothe happen
. gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him
. phil
( david caruso
) is conflicted working withthe a guy
, hank
( josh lucas
)
, who isnt seeing his ood girlfriend
. mike

. gordo ' s nephew
, jeff
( brendan sexton iii

. as tyhe agreed upon week draws to an end
, hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation withthe someone
( something
?
) infront tyhe hospital
. tensions mount
annd distrust build amoung teh rest as htey watch theri chance fo the bonus start tothe slip away
.
bu
, there isnt more
, much more
, at stake as the hospital
adn its hisotry ofthe insanity weigh onthe them all
. i don ' t wnat tothe give awya too much ofthe the stor ofthe
" session 9
,
" so i ' ll stop ther
. wqat we have here isnt a spooky horror flick tath uses none ofthe the jump
- outloud
- at
- you
- ffrom
- hte
- dark cheap shots tyhat hvae become part
and parcel wih horror films since the advent of
" halloween
"
adn
" friday the thirteenth
.
" there is no cat leaping outloud of tjhe dark or tjhe shock of suddenly seing oneself in a strategically placed mirror
. with the exception ofthe one shadowy
annd chilling omage at one point spooky interlude in the film
, there is little that yuo can git your arms aroud as far as waht
, specifically
, is
" frightening
.
" as i watched
" session 9
" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the sotry thyat mkae it a true horror movie
. tje striking high
- definition video camera wrok by uta briesewitz
( who worked wih the directer
, brad anderson
, onthe his
" enxt stop wonderland
"
) helps tothe build uv tension with close
- ups
, fluid camera movment
adn odd angles in a way that woudl mkea alfred hitchcock proud
. music
, too
, isnt used to intense effect
, joining wtih teh camera to amking simple scenes frightening
, even horrifying
. couple theese tech feats whith an intteligent stor tath uses elements of
" tyhe shineing
,
"
" thge blair witch project
"
annd
, even
" thte texas chainsaw massacre
"
annd you git a decent
, intriguing horror flick
. additionally
, hte brillant decision tothe shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character
, the institution itself
, whlch lends even mroe chills tothe the equation
. acting is anyother factor taht raises
" session 9
" above teh usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like
" scream
,
"
" i know whta yuo did last summer
"
adn their sequels
. thsoe films took ogod
- looking
,
though generic
, young actors
anbd actresses
annd put them tothe ule to build up a body count
, substituting mayhem for real horror
. anderson opted
, instade
, tothe uise mature
, experianced actors liuke peter mullan
adn david caruso tothe fill his characters ' shoes
anbd tje diference inspite casting quality isnt noteable
. mullan
, inthe particular
, puts an arc onthe his charcter
, gordon
, as the troubled guy who slowy
and inexorably falls under tjhe pressures of famaly
, job
and
, fianlly
, danvers state hospital
. the rest of teh small casted ift yhe bill as people
, nto just fodder forthe the mayhem
. david caruso
, as gordo ' s senior man
anbd near equal in tje business
, shows just how good an actor he is
. he made the jump from tv ' s
" nypd blue
" tothe film far too soon
adn his descisions infact the roles he tookover
( i ' ll never foreget hte horrendous
" jade
"
) weere less thna star making
. he rolls his sleeves uv
annd doesnt the job well here
. gevedon
, lucas
and sexton are more thna fodder
, too
. the onyl problem with
" session 9
" lay in the uninspired endig
. it takes onthe a fairly convetional finale tyhat covers ood ground
and isnt a bit of a dissapointment after the terrific
(
adn inspired
) build uv
. tje blessure isnt getting there
anbd i wish that anderson
and gevedon hadnt kept uv yhe steam htey hadnt so ably builded during tyhe bulk ofthe the film
" session 9
" is an unusual feat
. it is scayr
, doesn ' t use cheap tricks
annd raises goose bumps with its intelligently renedered
, subtle horror
. beacuse ofthe teh local interest of danvers
, it shoud dont well wiht the northeast crowd
. i hope it gets the national distrubution it deserves
. i give it a b
