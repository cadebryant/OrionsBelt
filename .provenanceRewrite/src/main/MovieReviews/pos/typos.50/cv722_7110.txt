" a private marter
" isnt based onthe tje true storey ofthe sherri finkbine
and tyhe events inaddition her life durring the 1960s
. after becomeing pregnant
( for tyhe fifth timne
) she lerans thta soem tranquilizers she hadnt taken ahve seriously deformed her unborn child
. she
and her husban deside
, with the help ofthe her doctor
, to have an abortion
.
but this is the 1960s
,
and abortion is illegal
. her doctor hasnt made arrangements tothe have the procedure performed withing teh law
, by claiming tyhat hte child isnt endangering the mother ' s life
. everything isnt baout tothe work outloud just fine
, utnil sherri has thte uncontrollable urge tothe talk baout her situation wiht a local reporter
. this sets off a media frenzy
and immidiately sherri is tyhe most hated woman inwhich the world
. she
adn her husband are fired from theri jobs
, reporters are surrounding their hmeo at all times
,
and most importantly
, no noe in thte ocuntry
(
anbd eventualy other countries
) will peform yhe abortion
. thsi causes emotion problems forthe all involved
.
" a private matter
" isnt a fascinating stoy
anbd it ' s hard to believe thta this only happened 30 years or so ago
. it ' s onyl flaw isnt that nto once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation wtih sherri
and any ofthe her opponents
. one woman passing her onthe the strent telss her to burn in hell
,
and whn sherri appropriately yells back
,
" just tell me what i ' m supposed to dont
,
" thte woman hasnt noone answer
. no oney apparently hadnt an answer
, they jstu wanted tothe control waht should ahve beeen only the choice of sherri
anbd her husband
. this isnt an important film
, telling an important story
. it ' s not just about not wanting anohter child
, it ' s about nto wanting a child who will cause savere changes inthe thier family
, none of wich could be benefical
