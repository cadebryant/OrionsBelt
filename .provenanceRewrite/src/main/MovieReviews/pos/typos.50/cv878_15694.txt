- profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996 ' s
" scream
,
"
anbd writed by hte same screenwrighter
, kevin williamson
, is a stylish
, effective horror film that bcame 1997 ' s biggest hit of tyhe fall season
. hwile
" scream
" ws a omre knowing film baout tjhe genre
,
" i knwo what you did lastr summer
" isnt more reminiscent of a straight
- forward slasher flick
,
bu it is far mroe inteligent than such bottom
- of
- thte
- barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the
" friday teh 13th
" films
( well
, okay
,
" jason goes to hell
" ws pure hell tothe sit through
)
. tjhe film starts off whith four talented
, aspiring teenage firends who have just graduated ffrom high skool in their small boating twon of southport
, n
. c
. it is the 4th ofthe july
,
adn htey iwll soon be heading their separate ways
. kind
- hearted julie
( jennifer lvoe hewitt
)
,
adn outsider ravy
( freddie prinze jr
.
) iwll be headed off to college
, hwile helen
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, who hasnt just been honored croaker queen inaddition thte twon
,
annd her ignorant jock boyfriend
, barry
( ryan phillippe
)
, are goign tothe new york tothe become an actress
anbd football payler
. wehn the four of them travel to a nearbye mountain
- side beach fo the evening
, htey are dismayed affter hiting a man in hte road onthe their way home
. distraught
annd confused
, they decide tehy cxan ' t go tothe the police becasue tehy iwll be charged with manslaughter
, so they devise a plan tothe throw the aparently dead victum off a peer into the ocean
, inthe hopes no noe wiull find him
. julie is apprehensive about it
,
but isnt forced inot it by barry
. switch to exactlly a year later
, julie
, still unable to come tothe terms wih waht she did
, reluctantly returns hmeo from coleeg to find that all three of her old firends are still in the town because theri career plans did not work outloud
. almost immediately
, julie recieves an ominous letter tht simply reads
,
" i knwo whta you doed last summer
,
"
and that is yhe strat ofthe thier problems as htey find themselves bieng terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed inaddition fisherman gear
and yielding a giant hook
.
" i know wqat yuo doed lastr summer
,
" isnt a successful horror film for a number ofthe reasons
. the cinematography by denis crossan coudl very well be decribed as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
,
and otehr clever devices tothe add atomsphere to tghe procedings
. the cahracters
, particularly julie
adn helen
, are realistically written
,
and thte film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a fewd scenes
, which isnt largly uncharacteristic in films of tihs sort
.
adn lsat
, the film creates a faw dazzling
annd skary setted
- pieces that are some ofthe the most memorable i ' ve seen in a horror movei
, prticularly the suspenseful
, superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family ' s tsore with tghe killer inside with her
. perhaps thge best character isnt that of missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonely backwoods woman whose brother ws the one julie thinks they hitted
. heche ' s performence is a standout
, as she isnt able to create a full character in onyl about ten mintues ofthe screen time
.
" i know whta ytou did last summer
,
" sould have been a grat horror movie if not fo a few problems
. prinze jr
. gives a performance to be desired here
,
and much of his dialogue soudns wooden coming outloud of his mouth
. also
, the climax of tjhe film allmost completly loses its frightening grap after it unveils tje mystery killer
, who is a decidely bad ctor
and shoudl nto have been given any lines
. luckily
, the penultimate scene saves tyhe disapointing finale
, whitch includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- in
- your
- seat
" scare
. iin the main roles
, hewitt
anbd gellar are highly talented
,
and hewitt
, especially
, isnt oen of the best screamers i ' ve ever heard
. she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a littel competition fo tjhe best
" scream queen
.
"
annd gellar isnt touching as a young woman who
, in tghe course of oney yearm
, finds her dream of being an actress ultimatly shattered
.
although not up to the level of eather
" scream
" movies
, or the more recent
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i knwo what yuo doed last summer
" is a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film that firmly prooved good horror movies were once agina being made
.
