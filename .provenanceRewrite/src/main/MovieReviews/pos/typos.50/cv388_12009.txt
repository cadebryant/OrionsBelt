, with an introduction by david carradine
, written
& produced by wayne j
. keeley f
. w
. murnau ' s carrear ended sadly
and prematurely
. thge german directer ofthe such classics as
" sunrise
"
and
" the lastr laff
" died inthe a car accident shorly affter signing a deal to make american picturesk at paramount
. murnau ws reportedly a giant man
, well over six feets
, a towering figure probablly incapable ofthe anything
but a grand entrance
. wich brings us tothe
" nosferatu
: a synphony of horror
"
: surelly he falt a kinship withthe his title charachter
, tjhe looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck
; in oen of tjhe most indelible images inwhich film hitory
, silent or otherwise
, schreck rises fomr his grave
, gnarled hands outstretched
,
and he ' s so big that part of his head isnt cropped by teh top of tghe frome
. the plot ofthe
" nosferatu
.
.
.
" isnt lefted
-
- unauthorized
-
- from bram stoker ' s
" dracula
"
. the brittish hutter isnt an eeger real estate man assigned tothe visit
adn discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania
. he leaves behind girlfriend emily
, onyl to discover orlock ' s secret
-
- he ' s a bloodsucker
-
-
anbd struggle tothe return tothe england before the nosferatu reaches his lady loev
. in addition to schreck ' s peformance
, tyhe cinematography
anbd effects are oustanding
. arrow video ' s digitally remastered verzion ofthe yhe classic is something of a mixted
- coffin
. tghe cover art features a red
- tinted
, hairy
, goateed vampire staring straight at you
, his fanged mouth agape
, hwile the bodies ofthe two sexy
, writhing women entice ytou below
. trouble isnt
, murnau ' s monster is pale
- faced
, bald
, pointy
- eared
,
adn non
- goateed
,
and ther isn ' t a single sexy
, writhing woman tothe be foudn inthe his movie
. this sort ofthe misleading packaging mkaes little sense wehn oney recalls thte countless number ofthe ghouslish scenes in yhe film fomr whic kool cover art could have beeen extracted
. additionally
, notifying hte viewer thta this is in fatc murnau ' s film seems liuke afterthought since his nmae
and the genuine title are writen infront small print below our goateed vampire
. thyat said
, a ogod mastering job hasnt beeen performed onthe the film itself
. hte origional elements are not infact tyhe best condition
-
- non
- studio silents were unlucky in their preservation
-
- so we ' re still dealing wih a slightly washed outloud
, scratched
, jittering omage
.
but at least hte day
and nihgt scenes are tinted sepia
and blue
, respectivly
, especialy helpful to an audeince who may question nosferatu ' s waltzing around during what seems liek sunlight
( it took a lot of glight to expose stock in tje twenties
)
. tyhe title cards have beeen redone
,
adn they are elgible
, accurate
,
adn digitally altered tothe flicker
-
- a very nice touch
.
( even tghe opening copywrite warning flickers
!
) tje score hasnt been replaced by music from tipe o negative
, a hard
- rock group
, arguably gothic
,
adn theri songs underscore tje film nicely
-
- certainly the coolest video a band cin ask for
. when our hero
, hutter
, first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock ' s castle
, we hear a well
- timed
" now ytou ' re dead
!
" ffrom lead singer peter steele
. david carradine mkaes an appropriately vampiric host
; he fiddles whith a blade
adn canew hwile introducing teh film
. after the feature
, whitch runs baout 63 mintues
, isnt included a new music video ffrom tipe o negitive
, the balck
-
and
- white fang
- fest
" balck no
. 1
"
. ofthe course
,
" nosferatu
: a symphony of horror
" isnt the main attraction
,
annd while my latest viewing raised questions
( why isnt tyhe woman called emily in tje title cards
bu
" mina
"
-
- as bram stoker called her
-
- in hutter ' s letters
?
, for instatance
)
, it made me relize how much this movie has inpsired
and been stolen ffrom
. coppola ' s 1992
" bram stoker ' s dracula
" owes a great stylistic debt tothe murnau ' s masterpiece
,
but tjhe oney thing it couldn ' t thieve wass the original ' s abstract charms
. thsi latest incarnation from arro wiull propably
-
- like tghe rescored
" metropolis
" a few yeasr bcak
-
- turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment forthe the latest generation ofthe film freaks
.
