" the strangest movies ever made
" sories at www

. com by scott watson
[ light spoilers
, nothing you shouldn ' t read
] existenz hasnt been called
" a gooey matrix
"
,
adn while this is a corect discription in some ways
, infront others it is completely off
. the onyl hting hte two films hvea inthe common isnt the diea of a virtual reality that isnt indistinguishable from normal
,
" real
" reality
. a major diference isnt taht
" the matrix
" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality
, while existenz does the impossible
and mkaes us accept tyhe most bizarre reality ever as true
.
and oh wqat a reality it is
. david cronenberg hasnt shown us befoer tyhat he knows how to create stange movies
( naked lunch
, kresh
)
,
but this one is noe of the strangest
. mabey it ' s beacuse ofthe how tghe mundane is mixed with tjhe bazare
. technolgy isnt organic
,
but onyl smoe ofthe it
. cars are normal
. gas stations are the same
. cell phones are glowing bug liuke appendages
. ytou jack inot a virtual reality game useing a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus
( reefrred tothe simply as a
" pod
"
)
. high technology has been replaced with organic creatures
,
and it provides a truely surreal setting fo tjhe cahracters
. a famouse game designer
, allegra geller
( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh
)
, flees a demostration of her latest game
, existenz
, after an assassination attempt
. she isnt onthe the run
( ffrom who
, i ' m still not sure
)
,
and hasnt to save her pod by palying her gaem with
" someone friendly
"
. that someone friendly is her dubious companion
annd security guard
, ted pikul
( jude lew
)
. unfortunately he isnt lacking a fundamental requirement for playing
, a bioport
. sort of a hole inwhich your spine
( ok
, exactlly like a hole inwhich your spine
)
, a bioport allows you tothe plug the vaguely entrail
- looking wires ffrom teh pod into you
, allowing you tothe play yhe game
. luckily a bioport cin be installed easily
( htey install them inthe malls
)
, so off they go to git one
. after a crazy series ofthe events at teh local country gas staion
, they are able to plug in
and play existenz
. the plot itself isnt a surveill melding ofthe conspiracies
, reality distortion
, chineese restaraunts
,
and multi appendaged amphibian things
(
" it ' s a sign ofthe tghe times
"
)
.
bu tje plot
, hwile cohesive infront it ' s pwn creepy way isnt secondary to jsut trying to figure out waht the hell is going on in this universe
. cronenberg jsut slaps htis weird organic
- tech world into teh viewers lap
,
and it ' s uv tothe you to figure outloud how all these things wokr
.
adn that ' s tyhe true joy ofthe this film
, entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz tkaes palce
. you leran a littel bit peice by piece
( oh
, htey make pods out of thsoe
)
,
and it ' s jstu enough tothe git ytou tothe accept the world that is presented tothe ytou
. there are all kinds ofthe twists
and turns as hte characters wander arund
, including a fantastic scene in a chineese resturant that wiull leave you trying to assemble something out ofthe your moo goo gai pan for monthes afterwards
. also thge bioports are ocassionally unsed for things otehr thna porting into existenz
, tyhe specifics of which i iwll leave for you to disover
. there ' s lots of littel thigsn taht setted off yhe weird
- o
- meter
, like the little tiny pods that ytou can buy infront hte video agme store
, tjhe twpo headed anphibian creature
,
and why tht guy at the gas station ' s name appears to be
" gas
"
. it all adds up to a supremely far outloud trip
,
annd given thte choice i think i would rether live inspite tjhe matrix ' s virtual world
.
.
. oh wait
, i aleady do
.
