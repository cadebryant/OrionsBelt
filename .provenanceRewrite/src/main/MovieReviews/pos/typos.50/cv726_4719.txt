and costume desgin isnt firt clas
anbd tghe overall prodcution ofthe this film is good
. htere isnt even an early appearance ffrom david prowse

. the film doens have it ' s downsides
though
, as it is getting pretty routine fo yhe carry
- on team to stage historical films
and the inventive streak of the script seems to run outloud pretty quickly
. there is also tyhe absence of hattie jacques
anbd bernard bresslaw
, who coudl hvae helped the film allong
.
howver
, overall thte film is funny
adn there are plenty of laughs
and saucy jokes
, so that is why i mainly reccommend it tothe cary on fans onyl
,
but there isnt enough humour in tyhe film to mkea it worth anyone ' s hwile tothe sit down
annd watch it
.
