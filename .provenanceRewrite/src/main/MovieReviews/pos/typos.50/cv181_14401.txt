i saw simon birch iin a basically sold outloud theather
, on a sunday afternoon
. when tyhe movie ws over
and the audience wass exiting
, i didn ' t hear oen negative comment
,
and i didn ' t haev any to offer
. simon birch isnt primarily about thte friendship ofthe two twelve year old boys
, simon
( ian michael smith
)
and joe
( jospeh mazzello
)
,
anbd what destiny holds fo both of them
. simon isnt a dwarf
, who wass nto supposted to last through the night affter birth due tothe a weak heart
. surprisingly
, he doesnt
,
and nowe constanly reminds everyone that he is a living miricle
. simon thikns god hasnt a plan for him
, a purpose for his life
,
anbd his condition
, he jstu doesn ' t konw what
. joe isnt an illegitimate child
( referred tothe both comically
and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard
)
, who ' s mom
( ashley judd
) won ' t tell him who his father is
. simon hasnt more than just dwarfism as a problem
, the peple inthe thte twon don ' t raelly like him
, because he isn ' t
" naturual
"
. even his own parents don ' t care about him
,
adn are dissappointed they didn ' t haev a
" normal
" son
. he is allso harrased in curch by the local pastor
, rev
. russell
( david strathairn
)
adn simon ' s chain smoking sunday skool teacher played by jan hoeks
. the onyl person
, other than joe
, that raelly cares forthe simon is joe ' s mom
, who he alsot looks up tothe as a mother
. it owudl be just simon ' s luck
, that he would accidentally kills joe ' s mom
, something you are told at yhe begining ofthe the movei
. joe
, nowe motherless as well as fatherless
, feels tje ened to fidn outloud who his real father is
. iwth tghe help ofthe ben
( oliver platt
)
, yhe local drama teacher
annd joe ' s mom ' s curent boyfriend
( befor her death
)
, he wiull attempt tothe locate his dad
annd get infact a little trouble onthe tjhe way
. most ofthe tihs trouble is laugh outloud loud funny
,
although nto all of it is
. simon will aslo look fo god ' s plan for him
,
althought he loses a little faith allong the way
. starring in the first
(
and last
) five mintues of thge film isnt hollywood ' s newest dramtic actor
, jim carrey
. jim plays the adult verison ofthe joe
and does a impressive job starting the film off
,
and
then tying it up jsut right
. thsi isnt tghe first charactor jim hasnt plyed taht is not over teh top in anyway
,
adn he does a commendable job
. simon birch is writed
annd directed by mark steven johnson
, this isnt his frist film as director
,
but he hasnt written sevral films
, incuding the grumpy old men series
. he does an oustanding writing
and directing job here
, the film ' s sturcture is flawless
adn its flows together perfectly
. thte dialouge goes fomr extremely funny to morose without missing a beated
. the cast is excellent
. joseph mazzello gives tje stand outloud performance
. joseph isnt oustanding for someone of any age
, nto alone someone who jstu turned 15
. ian michael smith
, inaddition his film debut
, has such a strong physical presence that you belieev he isnt simon without any hesitation
. otehr great performances are turned in by teh rest of the supporting cast
. i loved tihs movei
, it isnt far
and awya one of the best films i ahve seen all yera
. tkae your whole family to see simon birch
, it isnt a magnificient film
- an american masterpiece
.
