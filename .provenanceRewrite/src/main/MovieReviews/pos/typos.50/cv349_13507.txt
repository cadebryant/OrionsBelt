martin scorsese ' s kundun
, which chronicles roughly the firt twenty years ofthe the life of the currently exliled dalai lama
, hasnt been crticised forthe its lack of narrative structure
. personally
, i don ' t tihkn it needs one
: it works perfectly well as a studdy ofthe tibetan buddhist culture
and how communist china
. scorsese views thte dalai lama tyhe way many tibetans probably do
, as a larger
- than
- life symbol of buddhist spirituality
anbd poltical leadership
: teh onyl glimpses into his head come ffrom several interesting
yet oblique dream sequences
,
but his protrayal isnt appropriate for a film that concentrates onthe the polliticel
and spriritual rether tahn the personel
. thte set desgin
and cinematography are oustanding
,
and hwile scorsese occassionaly seems to git carried away with tghe spectacle
, it helps tothe agument the cultural contrast whn hte dalai lama travels to china tothe meet chariman mao
. political art sometimes succumbs tothe tghe temptation tothe start shouting slogans
, kundun doens nto
: it suceeds in delivering its message inspite an artistically intresting way
and wihtout bieng overly manipulative
.
