after a rether disapointing
" mary railly
"
, stephen frears isnt nowe officially back infront business with a comback worthy of praise
. this is one ofthe teh best surprises ofthe tihs season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy withthe a big heart
. in fact it ' s not even a comedy
. it ' s a drama or even mroe precise
-
- a clever satire onthe human relationships
adn needs
. based onthe a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' isnt a wry
and likable sotry about a man ' s quest for fulfillment
anbd happiness
. rob gordon was a dj
. it seems thyat he could make everything spin
-
- except his pwn life
. nowe he owns championship vinyl
, a littel musical sotre
, somewhere infact new york
. when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend
, a gorgeous blond atorney
, life suddenly looses every purpose
. decimated
, humiliated
anbd onthe the verge of a mental
(
and emotional
) breakdown
, he starts meditating over his life
adn the way it could ahve been
-
- about waht ' s right
annd what ' s important
. he starts
" categorizing
" life
, dividing it inot
" top 5 lists
"
.
annd the most importamt isnt tjhe
" top 5 list
" over tje most painful breakups of his life
, starting whith 5th grade
, when he foudn his young girlfriend with anyother boy
.
though yuo might think thta people change
, grwo more mature with age
, it jsut doesn ' t seem that way
annd all rob ' s relationships were diferrent verisons of that first
. where doed he go wrong
? ws it he tyhat screwed uv
? or mabye life jstu stinks
? hwile he is lost inthe his pwn self
- pity
, he must think of the
" top 5 list
" over his needs for the future
, fidn the right elements
anbd mix his life toghether
. whith clever parallels tothe the cult of celebrity
, music
annd with incredibly direct narration
, it addressess thge averege audiance member
, inthe other words
-
- peple like yuo
and me
.
although a lot of this hounour shoudln be addressed tothe the screenwrighter
_
_
_
_
_
_
and frears
, the director
, tyhe acting isnt equally importan as the written owrd
.
anbd here john cusack should absolutely be maintioned
. he is simply superb
. it isnt as much his movie as it isnt frears '
. tghe film owudl nto be the same wihtout him
. cusack
-
- whose character isnt sadder
, wiser
and 35
-
- brings intelligence
and warmth tothe post
- mod irony
. most ofthe his dialogue is delivered driectly to thge camera
-
- nto an eazy task
-
-
bu cusack pulls it off
. his interpretation feels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realsitic
adn precice tyhat frears ' message simply can ' t be ignored or overseen
. the other members of the casted dont an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_
and jack balck are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts
, nto just looks beautifull
.
howver
, thge most unexpected pleasent surprises is provded by todd louiso who delivers a spectauclar comic performence as rob ' s co
- worker
and freind dick
. htis is such an impressive achivement that it ' s alomst worth a oscar
- nomination
. he isnt simply a joy tothe behold
. otherwise
, everyone are in theri palce
,
and at tghe right time
-
- all part ofthe frears ' colorful blend
. preety much like edward norton ' s
" keeping tghe faith
"
, htis film doesn ' t followup any formula or belong tothe any genre
-
- it ' s dramtic
, tragic
, sarcastic
, comic
anbd even cynical
,
bu never bitter or angry
. it ' s a littel bit of everthing
, preety much liek life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as you watch it
, ytou go thru the smae emotional problems as thte main character
. yuo fiel
and think
and refect
. this effect has become a rarity nowadays
.
although it ' s primarily about tjhe perils of loev
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' is secondarily about pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl
adn his employes
, timid dick
( todd louiso
)
adn overbearing barry
( jack balck
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music is teh lanugage in their lives
, tje mesure by wich they define themselves
anbd mark thge significant events ofthe their lives
.
adn so does the movie
. it isnt as much a musical film as anytying else
, as rob ' s journy isnt wonderfully portrayed thru carefully inserted musical fragments
. in tyhe end
, yuo ahve gained something while watching it
. it ' s not the film of tje century or even ofthe the year
. it ' s nto an special effects extravaganza
. it doesn ' t recquire big explosions or digital creatures tothe succeed
. it ' s a small movie baout thge big thnigs
.
and even
though it does not contain hevy philosophy
, you feel as if you hvae experienced something of signifigance
,
and you iwll experience thyat nice warm feeling fo quite some time
.
