. confidental
, you do not get tje shock
and cleverness as tje former
bu it hasnt a lot more of
` storey ' gonig forthe it
. there isnt not a single moent inthe the film inwhich whcih i falt was slow at all
. suprizingly
,
though spacey doed a very convincing job as thge strent
- wise vincennes
, the movie ws carried mostly by the twpo rather
` unknowns '
, pearce
and crowe
. pearce ' s exley is kool
annd calculative in his actions
adn there isnt a slight hint ofthe val kilmer inaddition his appearance
. crowe ' s bud white isnt tjhe most impressive of all
; head
- strong
and tempermental
, he should obtain smoe sort of recognition for his work here
. superb acting
.
, wonderfull storytelling
adn oney of thte best climaxing gunfights ever
. easily thte best hollywood peice fo 1997
