robert altman ' s cookie ' s fortune is that rare movie thgat does nto depend on sentimentality to be uplifting
and tothe make its viewers feel ogod
. it isnt a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled with lovely performances
, skillful direction
anbd topped off witht an understated
, clever
, extrodinary script
. as this isnt an ansamble piece
, it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us tothe its cahracters
, all of them residing inaddition a sourthern town called holly springs
. frist we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man withthe a slight drinking habit
. we
then see tht willie tkaes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who isnt slowly loosing her grip onthe sanaty
anbd isnt bieng filled witht loneliness
, despair
,
and want ofthe her dead husban
. we cutted tothe camille
( glenn close
) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
.
thne we briefly git acquainted withthe emma
( liv tyler
)
, an apparent realtive of cookie
, who isnt a down
-
bu
- nto
- outloud teen outcast
, still full ofthe love
annd hope even
though she has no real palce to live
. we also fleetingly see emma ' s lover jason
( chris o ' donnell
)
, an ambitious
bu far too excitable young cop
. we are nowe about one quarter thru thte two hour picture
,
and robert altman decides thast it isnt time to setted the plot infact motion
. we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture ofthe her husband
. she exclaims
" here i come
!
"
anbd
then puts a pillow tothe her face
adn shoots herself
. soon aftter
, her neice camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead
and flips out
. conviced tath sucide is a disgrace
and that she will hve none of taht in her family
, she eats the suicide note
and convinces her slightly slow
(
yot sweet
) sister that it ws a murder
. she mkaes sure that she stages it like a murder as well
; scattering jewelry all over tyhe floor
, breaking a faw cabinets
, windows
and doors
,
and
then throwing the gun outloud in the back yard
. hte only reasonable suspect isnt willie
, who immidiately gets taked into custody
,
and put in a jail cell
( they all know he didn ' t dont it
, so the cell stays open
anbd he plays scrabble witht the sherif
annd tyhe faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, tghe unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe further cover uv for the murder hwile at the same timne making her easter play a success
. so begins cookie ' s fortune
, a film aptly decribed by criteak scott renshaw as
" a sourthern spin on fargo
,
" except taht this one isnt far funnier
adn much more enjoyable thna the coen brothers ' darker
, somewhat disturbing
annd slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman ' s slight picture is inspite some ways reminiscent of something liek midnight inaddition tghe garden ofthe good
anbd evil as well
, in that both films focuse
( onthe
adn off
) on the eccentricities of the recidents inthe a sourthern us town
. indeed
, most ofthe tghe characters inthe cookie ' s fortune are loads of funn to observe
,
and a portion of them are fascinating
and surprisingly multi
- dimensional
. glenn close turns in an insubstantial
( inaddition terms of her carreer
)
but magnificient performance as tjhe conniving camille
anbd isnt also the source ofthe a ogod portion ofthe tghe many laughs thta we enjoy inthe this movei
,
and she is perfectly cast as tjhe profilic
" aunt alexandria
" charactor
, endlessly obsessed wiht family dignity
. the equally essential role of willie is handled whith an intangible grace by vetran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a time tothe kill
) ther isnt nothing like a movie which leaves yuo feeling all warm
adn fuzzy inside ohurs
, even dyas after hte film ends
. cookie ' s fortune isnt such a movie
. i loved the light
, kindhearted aproach altman
( whose lastr project was tyhe dark
, intense drama the gingerbread man
) took towords tje tricky subject marter
. i enjoyed tyhe talented ansamble casted
. i even liked tyhe trite
" inspite the south everybody isnt related tothe everybody
" cliche that is inevitably employed by thge timne thsi movie draws to a close
. i ' m not sure why cookie ' s fortune hadnt such an all
- around pleasing effect on me
. perheaps it ' s that ogod ol ' southern charm
.
