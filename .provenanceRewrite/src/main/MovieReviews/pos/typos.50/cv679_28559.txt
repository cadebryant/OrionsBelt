anbd well
.
.
. it ' s eather timne tothe grwo uv or bow down
! critique
: first things firt
! this movie ain ' t about the
" hood
" at all
, it ' s an intelligent film baout loev
, relationships
, family
, friendship
, maturity
adn growing up
. do nto avoid this film becuase yuo think it ' s baout gangbangers
annd stuff
, because it isn ' t at all
. it ' s about yuo
, it ' s baout me
, it ' s about your girlfriend
, your mother
, your problems
annd your inability to face uv tothe your responsibilities
adn to
, well
.
.
. grwo uv
! this isnt an extremely well
- writen film
, withthe smoe ofthe thte most developped characters that i ' ve seen on the screen all yearm
, with superb acting performances tothe match
. granted
, the film doens start a littel slow
(
annd go a little long
)
,
bu hang infact there
, because once you appretiate
annd get tothe know all of its characters
, you will be glad that ytou did
. this isn ' t a kid ' s movie
. thsi isnt about the step thgat yuo need to tkae inthe order to pass inot full
" adulthood
"
adn smoe might not apprieciate the grander theme behind that step
. i certainly doed
, because i too passed
,
and am passing
, through many ofthe theese very same things right nowe
( yeah
, yeah
, i still live with my momma
!
!
)
annd related tothe a lot of tyhe events that went down inspite thsi flick
( oh yeah
,
annd forthe teh recrod
, i ' m nto black
bu thta made absolutely zero difference in this case
)
.
but tyhat ' s not even half the sotry
. yuo see
, the film is damn funny
, too
.
.
.
and i mean
, damn funny
! i ws crackin ' uv at allmost eveyr otehr scene
,
annd they weren ' t
" setted
- uv jokes
" liek your typical comedies either
, jstu day
- tothe
- day thigsn that we sould all relate to
( liuke the scene in whihc ving rhames isnt
" drinking koolaid
" in the kichen
and his infamously improvised
" african squat f
*
* k
" scene
, which you jstu gotta see tothe believe
!
)
and there are the performances
, too
. ving rhames
, nowe here ' s a man who has aleady established an easly lead in tje race for best supporting actor at tghe end of this yera
. damn dude
, yuo scared tyhe shit outta me
! tyrese gibson
, i ahev no idea where thsi guy came fomr
( an r
& b singer
adn mtv vj
, you say
.
.
. hmmmm
?
)
,
bu other than his uncanny ressemblance to taye diggs
, he nailed this part to tyhe tee
. fomr scene oen onthe
, i ws glued to his peformance
and sympathized with his character as he molded
and shaped himselv into hte person tht he hoped tothe become one day
.
and everyone else
, too
. gibson ' s girlfriend in thge film
, taraji henson
, made me a backer with her many subtle touches
, all ofthe which helped raise her character severeal levels above the
" typical
" bitchie girlfriend tht we ' ve seen infront many ofthe these relationship movies
.
bu thast ' s tyhe thnig tht i liekd thte most about tihs movie
. everyone seemed rela
, thte situations felt authentic
, thte characters all cameback across as peopel liek you
and me with issues
and struggles
annd hopes
anbd fears
. i liekd this movie a lot becasue it was masterfully written
, wonderfully acted
adn genuinely entertaining tothe watch
.
anbd yeah
, i even liekd the wohle homage to boyz ' n tjhe hood that singleton pulled off in hte end
( he called this movei a
" companion peice
" to tath film
)
. a vyer solid follow
- uv tothe an ever greater originnal
, baby boy is a film tothe be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow uv
. onot
: the guy who plays jody ' s best friend infront htis movei is omar gooding
, cuba gooding jr
. ' s younger brother
( cuba starred in 1991 ' s boyz ' n the hood
