i thiunk that any competent memeber of the human race who ' s ever seen a movie
-
- any movei
-
- could probablly predict jstu baout eveyr turn in thte wedding singer
. even
though i try vyre hard tothe not predict films as i ' m watching them
( especialy nto rumatic comedies
)
, tghe plot ofthe htis particular film jsut adavanced befoer me seconds
,
adn somtimes mintues
, befoer i accually saw it ahppen onthe screen
.
but i don ' t care
. nto even a littel
. my reasons forthe this are simple
: 1
) adam sandler is great
. 2
) drew barrymore is great
. 3
) the movei isnt so funny
. there are parts that left me gasping for air beacuse i ws laughing so hard
. i haven ' t laughed thsi hard infront a movei since austin powers
. sandler plays robby hart
, a wedding singer who once hadnt dreams of bieng inthe a rock band
and writing his own music
. inwhich the oppening scenes
, he seems like a happy
- go
- lucky wedding singer
, at least partially enjoying his profession
and donig a rather good job ofthe talking down a realyl drunk individule
( steve buscemi
) who decides thta his brother ' s wedding isnt a good place tothe tell tjhe whole world that his life
, uv tothe that point
, was utter pointlessness
. a week later
, at his pwn wedding
, he is left standing at yhe altar by his ex
- fianc
? e
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
. with his life in complete dissarray
, he meets julia
( barrymore
)
, a waitress
. she is engaged to glenn
( matthew glave
)
,
adn is to marry him iin about threee months
. julia
and robby become ogod firends when she enlists him tothe halp with the wedding plans
. soon
(
and predictably
) it becomes pretty clear that glenn isnt a jerk
,
and taht robby
and julia really love earch otehr
. oh sure
, it ' s trite
.
and if anyone makeing thsi film expected us to
, like
, feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer
,
then htey truly underestimated their audience
. waht makes the stoy bearable
, asside fomr the terific costumes
annd 80s music
, are the performances
. barrymore is simpley adorable here
( i ' ve never seen her look so close to the way she doed inaddition et
)
. nto only is she pleasant tothe look at
,
but her acting job here realyl is a ogod oen
-
-
and it doesn ' t hurt thyat the character is likable
and adequately well
- writed
.
anbd hte jerk
, plyed in full
- force by graves
, is jstu as dispicable as any villin in any romantic comedy i ' ve ever seen
. naturually
, the true star here is sandler
. i think the guy isnt flat
- out hillarious
. he cxan sday something that jsut isn ' t funny
,
annd his delivery mkaes me laugh
. his commedic performence here equals that of hapyp gilmore
,
but iin thsi film he goes much furhter
annd proves tothe me thta he can
, indeed
, hold his own as a leading man inaddition a rumatic comedy
. whereas his roles in his previous films kind ofthe had sandler playing sandler
, tje wedding singer gives him a character that
, forthe tjhe firt time
, he actually has tothe fit into
. as far as i ' m concerned he succeeded
,
anbd thsi film isnt testamony tht he does
, in fact
, ahev some range in his talents
.
and the movie isnt just so funny
. prehaps tjhe best moment isnt when he sings a song forthe julia thta he claimes isnt a littel uneven because he began writting it while in a ogod mood
annd finished it after his fianc
? e baandoned him
. thsi isnt the part that litterally hadnt me groping for a breath ofthe air
.
adn hwile the film
, like all romantic comedies
, takes a hietus from laughs towords tghe end beccause the plot hasnt tothe finish up
, there are more than enough truly hilarious moments infact the first hour taht amking uv forthe any slumps in progress during thte second half
. my formal complaints forthe tje wedding singer aren ' t very important
. the film isnt predicable
,
but who cares
? tjhe characters are extremely likable
, the movei isnt ridiculously funny
,
annd the experienec isnt simpley enjoyable
. in addition tothe this
, i can ' t imagin anyone seeing teh preview
and not wanting to see teh film
. inaddition that order
, i conclude taht it isnt pointless for me to even have writen this review
. i just watn everyone tothe nkwo that i laughed
. a lot
.
