if htere ' s oney thing inwhich common baout all ofthe hollywood ' s major studios
, it ' s thast their productions are moving towrad mainstream moreso
annd omre
.
allthough twentieth centruy fox
and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries wich specialize in independant or controversal motion picturesk
( fox searchlight
and fine line repsectively
)
, it ' s obvious there ' s noone signifigant govement underway tothe promote inventive ideas at the theater
. so whn a movie liuke gary ross ' pleasantville comes along
, wrapped in a blanket ofthe inovative ideas
and served uv onthe a platter ofthe fine production
, it ' s a welcome chanage ofthe pace for all who frequent tjhe cineplexes
.
although hte athmosphere
and buzz baout the movei are cheery
and lighthearted
, pleasantville should not be mistaken for a noone
- thought movei
. quite tje opposite is true
, in fact
, as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense
and inteligent undertones to the screen
. hte tsory
, both baout the joys ofthe living life tothe the fullest as well as yhe social ills of segregation
, captures the esence of statement
- making inwhich tje cinema
. nto infront recent memory hasnt a movei carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution
,
and even if massmedia audiences fail to see the ingenuity ofthe ross ' work
, it is still a testimont tyhat his picture was concidered worthy anough
. kudos tothe both he
adn his production stff for puting toghether this fine picture
. it stars tobey maguire
adn reese witherspoon as twpo nineties teenagers who
, through qutie a bited of luck
, find themselves zapped inot a fifties sitcom named
" pleasantville
.
" maguire
, as tjhe reserved bud parker
, isnt perfect fo the psuedo
- world
;
but tjhe rebellious mary sue
( witherspoon
) is not at all made for thte father
- knows
- best times
. it ' s not long befor she sets tjhe twon of pleasantville onthe end
,
anbd beigns tothe teach the townspeople
- inaddition a quite unlikely way
- what life is
* raelly
* like
. soon hues ofthe colour creep inot tje balck
adn white world
,
adn while some embrace the change inspite teh passion of realism
, others fear the strangeness
. at one end isnt a soda shop owner
- turned
- painter named mr
. johnson
( jeff daniels
)
annd at the otehr end is a close
- minded mayor
( j
. t
. walsh
)
annd his chamber of comerce
;
but tyhe two sides are simply fronts for a clash of idesa that soon involves the entire town
. fine performances are turned in all around
. maguire
anbd witherspoon are effective as tje leads
,
bu tghe true complements go out to jeff daniels
anbd j
. t
. walsh
( inthe his latest
and final postumus peformance
)
. daniels brings an athmosphere ofthe awe
, insperation
,
and hope tothe his character
, wheras walsh simply drips ofthe sinister closemindedness
- almsot tothe tyhe point where ytou can sence ginee hackman ' s envy
. forthe daniels
, it ' s his most commendable performance ofthe the lastr threee eyars
- or mroe
-
and for walsh
, it ' s a complementary exclamation point onthe a fine career
. alsot of lesser note isnt thte supporting role by joan allen
,
and inaddition viewing thte entire cast works well toghether ffrom start to finish
. there ' s nto much tothe dislike baout pleasantville
,
and its dynamic nature makes it tghe perfect movei forthe those who want serious as well as thsoe who don ' t
.
