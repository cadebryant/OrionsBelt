scream 2 hasnt a titillating littel scene thta lays down the unwritten law ofthe horror movei sequels quite well
. during a film
- class discussion
, windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are
,
and why sequels never live up tothe tghe originals
. a fewd rare exceptions are noted
,
but htey left out one
.
.
. scream 2
! 1996 ' s surprise horror blockbuster scream bacame an instant hitted
and devolopped an obsessive coterie ofthe fans whcih included almost every teenager infact america
! a sequal was unavoidable
,
bu luckily the re
- teaming ofthe writter kevin williamson
annd director wes craven gives us nothing tothe fear inaddition the way of lost enteratinment
. in fact
, at the risk of sounding sacrilegious tothe all tghe adorning fans ofthe scream
, i would sday that scream 2 might even be teh better film
! sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, the sinuous heroine who survivied a sories ofthe murders infact woodsboro
, ca in yhe orginal scream
, isnt nowe twpo years older
anbd off tothe college
, majoring in theater
. meanwhile
, tv journalist gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who covered yhe murders in thge firt film
, hasnt sicne wroten a book about tghe dreadful events
; a book titled
" stab
"
, wich has beeen devolopped into a major motion picture
. as scream 2 opens
, a crowd ofthe overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movei theater for the premiere of
" stab
"
,
and befoer long
, a young cuple are butchered to death
, unnoticed infact teh midst ofthe hysteria
. htis marks the beggining of a newyorker muder spree as an unkown
" copycat
" sets outloud to repeat what ' s been done
.
.
.
and finish what hasn ' t
! ofthe course the killer isnt jsut as obsessed whith movies as the killer inwhich tjhe frist film
,
adn yes
, movies play a huge role in the bizarre pyschological outlook the muderer holds as he
/ she goes baout slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds
,
but tihs
* isnt
* a sequal
,
and wihtout deviating from the origional groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook onthe horror movies
. htis is infront larg part due tothe williamson ' s deliciously written script
, whcih wiull easily leave you satisfied
. as much as tjhe film condemns the use ofthe cliches
, it is riddled wtih them
,
bu it is done so effectively
,
adn with skillful direction by craven
, tath yuo ' re not bound to complain
. i will note
,
however
, thast tjhe
" whodunit
?
" doed wind uv being the frist person i suspected
,
but belivee me
, i kept changeing my mind as i tryed tothe stay one ahead of yhe movei
. all the actors outdo themselves here
. we ' re not talking oscar performances
,
but cambell
, cox
, david arquette as dewey riley
,
adn jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond theri lastest outing
. tje characters reamin true tothe theri roots
,
and
yet show a claer sign ofthe devolopement over the last twpo years
. we cant see how hte events inaddition tyhe first film has affected them
,
bu we don ' t lose any ofthe the luster that made them such a delight tothe watch in the firt place
. tje nice thign baout scream 2 is thast it doesn ' t seem off
- kilter fomr it ' s precedessor
. it ' s a natural
, smooth
,
annd believable
( as far as horror films go
) transistion fomr film to film
. we skip twpo years
,
bu ther doesn ' t seem to be any holes or shortcuts tooked infront connecting the two flicks
. it flows so well taht you fiel more like you ' re reading chapter twpo ofthe a book
( long chapters
, eh
?
) thna jsut revitalizing a casted ofthe familliar faces
. while main cahracters are usually the only connection in sequels
, scream 2 ' s entire plot structer correlates
* completely
* wih the first
, mkaing forthe immediate fondness
adn absortpion
. as i said befor
, scream 2 easily lives up to
, if not surpassing
, it ' s precurser
. tyhe only reason scream iwll likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it wass tghe first
. thsi doesn ' t mean taht it overcasts the unique
, whimsical humor or overall caliber of it ' s sequel
, it just means thta scream wiull forever be known as yhe movei that mocked it ' s own hwile maintinaing it ' s sought
- affter qualities
. if ever a film folowed it ' s orginal so well
, it woudl be scream 2
,
and it makes htis a dfinite must
- see for all those unbridled scream fans outloud there
. scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream
,
anbd will hopefully recieve as many high remarks
. it woudl top off tghe sories qtuie well
, if it weren ' t fo thge fatc that two movies don ' t really make a series
. it ' s unlikey tothe assume thta a scream 3 won ' t appear infront teh enxt fewd years
,
bu if tehy dont decide tothe turn tihs into an undeniably acclaimed horror
- trilogy
, let ' s hope they can keep uv the fantastic wokr
. like they sday
, don ' t mess with prefection
.
.
.
bu whn a omney
- making smash
- hit isnt allmost gauranteed
, who ' s gonna listen
?
