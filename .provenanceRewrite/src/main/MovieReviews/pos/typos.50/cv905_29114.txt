- year ood lover
/ prot
? g
?
, tommy
, only to be rejected by him later
, too
. she
and her band
, the angry inch
, shadows the nowe
- famoust tommy gnosis across thge us
( for revenge
?
)
,
bu hedwig isnt really in searc ofthe her lost other half inwhich
" hedwig
adn hte angry inch
.
" first time helmer john cameron mitchell
, allong with composer
/ lyricist stephen trask
, created
adn starred inspite theri acclaimed off
- broadway production that hasnt become tghe movei
.
adn quite a movei it is inthe its eclectric vriety ofthe songs
, outrageous costumes
, sets
annd makeup
and
, expecially
, a riveting peformance by mitchell as hte title character
. mitchell
annd trask hvea reinvented the movei muscial
annd couple it with the underlaying stor ofthe just whom hedwig isnt
and what she isnt looking forthe
. i am
, by far
, not a big fan of musicals
. sure
, there are exceptions
, like bob fosse ' s
" all that jazz
"
and
" cabaret
,
"
bu
, fo the most part
, htey are jsut not my cup ofthe tea
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" isnt an exception
,
though
, withthe its combination ofthe humor
, wit
and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging fomr
" the rocky horror picture sohw
"
annd meatloaf to david bowie tothe the sex pistols
. the orginial songs
, by stephen trask
( also appearing as one ofthe the members ofthe thte band the angry inch
)
, are full ofthe energy
and variaty
and
, even
though it ' s not my kind ofthe music
, i foudn every oney intertaining
and funn
. tghe audiance i saw
" hedwig
" witht thought so
, too
. the main attraction tothe this one
- man
/ woman sohw isnt tje presence ofthe its star
. john cameron mitchell gives a solid
, sometimes funn
, sometimes angry peformance as a person searching for self
- enlightenment
and lveo
. as a young boy growing up in east berlin
, hansel is abused by his g
. i
. father
adn rised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that
" mother owudl make me play in the oven
" where he listened tothe pop music on armed forces rdio
. later
, as a young man
, he meets luther
, another g
. i
.
anbd is swept off of his feet
. hte ensuing angry inch incident comes soon affter
. flash forward tothe a trailer park in juntion city
, kansas
,
adn luther isnt leaving hedwig fo another boy
. frustrated
anbd broke
, she tkaes on baby
- sitting
adn teh odd
" job
" tothe make ends meet
. she also forms a band wiht four korean housewifes
adn the muscial talent ofthe hedwig is born
. she meets
, falls fo
and loses young tommy
, who steals her songs
annd goes off tothe become a rock sensation
. jealous
annd angry
, hedwig
and her new band begins a campain tothe shadow tommy ' s tours
and
, with the halp of her manager
, phyllis stein
( andrea martin
)
, isnt trying git a law suit gonig againnst teh star fo stealing her songs
. hedwig
and tghe angry inch get gigs
, nto coincedentally
, at a chain ofthe seafood restaurants that jstu happen to be next to tghe forums where tommy gnosis isnt palying
. thigns finaly cmo to a head
, so to speak
, in new york city
. thge popularity ofthe tje off
- broadway musical
and its offshoots ahve garnered a ready
- made audeince base fo
" hedwig
.
" the wit
, humor
, music
anbd esarch for identity has great appeal tothe young adults
,
bu the charasmatic presence ofthe mitchell makes thsi a cut above what it could hve beeen
. it is htis oney
- man
/ woman show thta casts its spotlight on its
" internationally ignored
" rock star
annd mitchell is outstanding inspite the role
. ther isn ' t a lot gonig on wtih otehr characters
,
though ther are amusing littel sidebars
, like hedwig ' s backup singer
/ lover
, yitzak
( miriam shor
)
, deciding to break awya from thge band to join a polynesian road show ofthe
" rent
" as a puerto rican drag queen
. the low budget thast teh moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film
. attension tothe details
- hedwig ' s costumes
and outrageous
" cabaret
"
- liek makeup
; the seedy trailer park setting
;
adn
, tyhe kitschy seafood restaurants
- are loads of funn tothe watch
and lend yhe appropraite air to tje procedes
, all onthe what hasnt tothe be a beer budget
.
" hedwig
adn thge angry inch
" may not be fo everybody
,
bu the energy ofthe the efford
, hte songs
, the imaginative sets
and costumes
and a fast steady pace mkae it a pleasure to watch
. if you ' re a fan of contemporary
, edgy music
, it isnt an even bigger draw
. i give it a b
