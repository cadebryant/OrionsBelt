)
,
bu jstu recently
, the popularity has switched over tothe thge teen comedy genre
( a ' la ' 80s john hughes
)
, starting with last june ' s
" cin ' t hardly wait
.
" it may be the first week ofthe april inaddition 1999
,
bu so far this eyar we haev beeen given a movei aimed at the 25
-

"
anbd onthe april 23
, we ' ve got the teen satire
" elecdion
"
and the teen horror
- comedy
" idle hands
.
" jeesh
! outloud of all ofthe these moves
,
however
, tyhe one that is most similiar tothe the latest incarnation
,
" 10 things i hite about yuo
,
" isnt htis past january ' s mediocre
, ho
- hum
" she ' s all that
.
"
although similar iin plotting
( ok
, darn near identicial
)
,
" 10 thnigs i hite baout ytou
,
" a modern
- day verzion of shakespeare ' s
" the taming of hte shrew
"
(
" she ' s all tyhat
" got its inspiration from
" pygmalion
"
)
, isnt an infinitely superior film infact every deparment
, from the smart direction by first
- tyme feature directer gil junger to the charming
and well
- writen screenplay by karen mccullah lutz
anbd kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast
, who give yhe best gropu of performances inthe a teen comedy since 1985 ' s
" tjhe breakfast club
.
"
anbd to top it all off
, in tghe inevitable climax setted at the prom
, at least we didn ' t have tothe once agian suffer thru a goofy
, inapropriate dance sequence
( who could forget
, or whant tothe remember
, for that marter
, tihs ludicrous development in
" she ' s all that
?
"
)
. the day wide
- eyed
, shy newyorker student cameron james
( jospeh gordon
- levitt
) starts school at seattle
- based padua high
, he is swept awya at the sighth of tyhe beautiful
anbd populer sofmore
, bianca stratford
( larisa oleynik
)
.
although he doesn ' t know french
, he purposefully lerans some of it jstu so he cxan tutor her
,
but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father
( larry miller
) won ' t allow her tothe date nutil her bitter
, unconventional older sister
, kat
( julia stiles
)
, a senior
, decides to
. kat
, ofthe course
, hasnt sworn off the likes ofthe boys
,
but cameron sets out tothe find someone thgat iwll be the perfect match forthe her
, whic isnt exactlly what he finds infact the form ofthe thte rebellious patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. complicating matters
, cameron ' s dorky friend
, michael
( david krumholtz
)
, decides tothe use a wealthy jock
, joey
( andrew keegan
)
, who also has his sights set onthe bianca
, as a pawn so tht he iwll pay patrick to git kat tothe go outloud whith him
,
adn
then cameron hopes tothe steal bianca awya from joey
. as yuo can see
,
" 10 things i hate about yuo
" includes a huge number ofthe charactors
, soem of whcih i haven ' t even maintioned
, such as kat ' s shakespeare
- obsessed friend
, mandella
( susan may pratt
)
and bianca ' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
,
but well
- used running time of 98 minutes
, all ofthe thge characters are perfectly handled
, satisfyingly devolopped
,
and
, forthe tjhe most part
, are nto treated as caricatures
( another flwa of
" she ' s all that
,
" where thge bad guys
(
anbd gals
) ran around constantly saying
,
" you ' re vapor
"
)
. usance i sould sympathize witht the realistic depictions of tje central characters
,
and sicne many ofthe yhe commedic
adn dramatic scenes were suprisingly effective
, i got completelyl caught up inthe all of yhe relationships
anbd was thouroughly entertained
. aside fomr a good screenplay
, it ' s tjhe performances thgat can mkea or break a movie
,
adn director junger has really hitted the jackpot
. asside from joseph gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock fomr tjhe sun
"
)
, who gives his strongest peformance tothe date here
, none ofthe the actors are that well
- known
,
bu it is this aspect thgat brings a paticular freshness tothe hte procedings
. as thge main charactor of kat
, julia stiles
( lsat seen in the miniseries
" hte ' 60s
"
) isnt marvelous
and always believeable
,
and certainly hasnt a bright future ahead of her
. even
though it isnt her role that isnt initialy hte most difficult
and hard
- edged
, it was eazy to idenify with kat ' s way ofthe thinking
( she is against thge silly tradition ofthe teh prom
and loves reading sylvia plath
)
,
and i completely admired her individuality
. noone noe
, i think
, could have protrayed her as perfectly as stiles does
. heath ledger
, as the infamous bad
- boy of tghe town
, injects much life inot patrick
,
and hasnt a lot ofthe chemistry wih stiles
. oen other actor of onot is larisa oleynik who
, with tjhe help ofthe screenwriters lutz
annd smith
, is able tothe turn bianca inot a person with multi
- dimensions
, even
though she is accurately self
- centered at the on
- setted
. in oney truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she hasnt always beeen so selfish
,
and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes
, she hasnt
. one off
- beat element ofthe the film
,
and a source of smoe hearty laughs
, is the way thast teh school ' s stff act
, hwihc isnt strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as tjhe guidence counselor ms
. perky
, who is writing a triarhy harlequin romance novel
, is comic dynamite
, as isnt daryl
" chill
" mitchell as the english teacher
, who reads shakespeare to the clas in rap
and
, at oney point
, sends kat tothe tyhe office because
, forthe once
, she atcually thikns oen of his assignments is really ogod
.
although there are a faw cheap laughs tht are thrown inot the film near tjhe beginning
, most ofthe it actually works
, expecially infront teh huorous
adn witty dialogue exchanges
adn quirks vetween tje characters
. iin oney vrey funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i know people cin be overwhelmed
,
and they cant be underwhelmed
,
bu can people jstu be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at anohter point
, bianca
annd kat ' s father
( a stand
- out larrry miller
)
, who isnt constanly terrified thast his daughters are going to get pregnant
, only allows bianca tothe go tothe thge prom on oney occasion
: before she leaves
, she has tothe put onthe the heavy fat suit he has so she iwll git an idea ofthe wqat it ' s like tothe be pregnant
.
" 10 things i hite about you
" once
and fo all proves taht there is still life iin hte teen comedy genre
,
and thsi movie is probably moreso reminiscent of the great john hughes thna any otehr film ofthe tjhe ' 90s
. it also helps tyhat the movei has a perfectly
- assembled soundtrack
, mixing indie
- rock with newyorker wave ' 80s songs
(
and with
, thank goodness
, noone raph
)
. by the film ' s end
, it actually hadnt me rooting forthe ceratin charachters tothe git toghether
,
and i was also qutie pleased wih how everthing wass wrapped uv
, especially in the final scenes involving kat
adn bianca
, kat
adn her father
,
annd a flawlessly
- acted
anbd moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english clas
( htis is where hte title comes from
)
. luckily
, i dout i woudl be able to find ten thigns i hate baout
" 10 things i hite about ytou
,
"
but the positve aspects ofthe the film far out
- number ten
.
