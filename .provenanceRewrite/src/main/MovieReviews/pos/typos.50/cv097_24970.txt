, it ' s a high art
. we ' ll dont just baout anytying to put off a task
. whn the deadline for this column nears
, it ' s the onyl time during thge week dishes git washed
annd yhe bed made
and laundry done
and plants watered
and
.
.
. eventally
, hopefully
, sometimes
, there ' s a breakthrough
adn we actualyl get down to work
. amazingly it ' s almost alwyas easier than we dreaded
anbd affter finishing
, tath sence ofthe oppressive apprehension melts away
.
and
then
, thte next time
, we dont it all agian
. english proffesor grady tripp
( michael douglas
) isnt a master
. seven yeasr ago
, his first book wass a hitted
. he ' s beeen wokring on his second
-
- a short 200
- page peice
-
- sicne
thne
. fearful thgat he cin ' t live up tothe thte firt
, he can ' t bring himself to finish it
. no writer ' s block
, he ' s nearing 3
, 000 pages withthe no end in sight
. nowe he ' s having a particularly difficult day
. the coleeg ' s annual writers confrence isnt bringing inthe acomplished novelists reminding tripp thgat other peopel are finishing
_ thier
_ books
. during thte first day
, his wief hasnt left him
, his marryied girlfriend informs him she ' s pregnant
adn his agent isnt in town wiht a six
- foot transvestite inwhich tow
. by thte evening
, our beseiged writer is driving
though hte snow
- covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him
, a stolen jacket tath marilyn monroe weared onthe her wedding day in teh bakc seat
anbd a murdered blind dog stuffed iin the trunk
. tihs coudl be a pivotal point iin his mid
- life crisis
.
adn
thne there ' s the enxt morning
. ther ' s a lot to like baout tihs movei
. there are no huge explosions
, shattering glass or cmoputer
- generated dinosaurs to distract from thge very rela human issues
. grady isnt caught up in the curse ofthe people who accomplish graet things early in their career
. in the world of
" waht hvae you done forthe me lately
?
"
, he knwos his second book hasnt to be better than his frist
. instade of finding out
, he drifts
, comfortable infront the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood
. he doesn ' t have much of a life
and niether does his star pupil james leer
( tobey maguire
)
. james may be sucidial
and psychotic
. certainly everything taht comes outloud ofthe his mouth isnt a lie
. he makes up a past ofthe working clash anguish becuase tyhe truth ofthe wealth
and comfort jstu isn ' t interesting enough
. as tyhe weekend progresses
, htey are both forced to fully engage life
. that ' s hte question htey must face
: comfort or rela experiences
? the film tkaes some intresting chances
. non
- traditional relationships are presented as marter
- of
- fact
. extra
- marital
, gay
, interracial
, proffesor
- student
: here they aren ' t judged
, mearly choices
. the actors are all frist
- rate
. douglas triumphs
, playing againnst type as he spends most of his timne disheveled
, unshaven
adn cladded in a pink womens ' s hous robe
. maguire ' s disengaged alienation works perfectly here
. robert downey jr
. as grady ' s agent livens up his scenes
. director curtis hanson
(
" l
. a
. confidential
"
) makse a faw missteps
. hte women are underused
. frances mcdormand does a ogod job ofthe her limited role of sara
, grady ' s married lover
but we never understand much of who she isnt
. teh chemestry between hte two of them isnt non
- existant which makes some ofthe the endig unconvincing
. katie holmes isnt a student wih a major crush on the profesor
,
bu her chracter goes nowhere
. we never even see grady ' s exiting wief
. htis is veyr much a guy ' s film
. the varied relationships bewteen the men are much more convincing tahn any ofthe thge others
. grady ' s alternating mentoring
annd rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film
, nto him
and sara
. as hte boomers age
, expect to see more mid
- life crisis films tothe catch the attention ofthe that demographic
. eventually it ' ll propably become cliche
,
but right nowe we ' ve got a winner
. i ' ll finish this in a second
. right nowe i have tothe grab some paint
. i noticed smoe trim infront yhe otehr room tyhat needs a littel touch
