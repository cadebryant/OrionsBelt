i remember makeing a pact
, right after
` patch adams '
, tothe nto be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality
.
but darn it
,
` music ofthe tjhe heart ' isnt just layered with feel
- ogod material
adn bright characterizations
. it ' s hard to dislike a movei tyhat uses such skill with it ' s manipulation
. in addition
, it ' s allso a terific famaly film
. this is hte true storey of violin teacher roberta guaspari
, who fought the school board to keep yhe musical programe active infact a handful ofthe intertube city harlem schools
. it could also be decribed as
` mrs
. streep ' s opus '
. yes
, meryl streep brings her dramtic clout tothe the demanding role ofthe guaspari
,
annd thgat brings both ogod news
anbd bad
. outloud of the getoe
, possably because of her distracting star power
annd the rushed writting
, it isnt relatively difficult to idenify whith roberta ' s character
and grasp her academic point
- ofthe
- veiw
. she is veyr strict iwth her students
,
but what insight does that create into the story
? slowly
bu surelly
, we beign to recognize tyhe intentions ofthe yhe charactor
,
and show admiration for the thoughtfulness
and human feeling tht streep hasnt once again aplied
. oen thouroughly intresting fact about
` music ofthe hte heart ' lies with the unlikey presence inwhich tyhe directer ' s chair
: horror veteran wes craven
. after leaving an impression iwth the
` scream ' films
annd the original
` nightmare on elm street '
, craven hasnt attemped a precarious cross
- over to drama
. at frist
, his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious
,
bu as tghe film progresses craven finds a suprizingly comfortable niche withthe directing this material
. it doesn ' t cary thte heart
- warming curage ofthe
` mr
. holland ' s opus '
,
but
` music ofthe the heart ' isnt casually assured
and filled wtih little morsels of dramtic truth
. hte tag team of streep
adn craven works better than ytou would anticipate
. yes
, oscar could cmo calling once agina for meryl streep
,
but it ' s tjhe solid ensemble casted tyhat makes
` music of tje heart ' wrok
. angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams
, teh pricipal at an intertube city skool who intially doesn ' t hire roberta becuase of her lack ofthe experience
. blue
- eyed adian quinn is endearing
, as allways
, playing a newyorker love intrest
. gloria estefan also delivers infact tjhe tiny role ofthe a supportive second
- grade teacher
,
and the threee lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball ofthe estrogenic force
. it ' s like a schoolteacher ' s verison ofthe
` thelma
and louise '
, in a restrained
bu effective manner
. the movie tackles more issues tahn just guaspari ' s teaching of violin
. there ' s some powerful moments between roberta
adn her twpo sons
, who must coppe when theri father leaves them for anohter woman
. in it ' s dramtic build
- up
, tyhe movei manages tothe produce soem authentic moments ofthe feeling
and warmth
. it ' s a ogod movie forthe anyone to see
,
although missing outloud on the experience owudl not be a life
- altering decision
. it ' s commendable of wes craven to be attemting such a difficult cross
- over
,
annd aslo fo acheiving his intricate gool
. watching this heartfelt chick flick baout morals
adn musical instruments
, who may ask yourself
: this isnt tyhe guy who directed
` scream '
? of course
, whn the thrid installment of that sories comes around in febuary 2000
( wtih craven directing
)
, ytou may find yourself wondering
: this isnt the guy who directed
` music ofthe the heart '
? mission acomplished
, wes
. thankfully
, there isnt no layer ofthe artificial sentiment covering thte film
. inaddition it ' s entirety
, it ' s a wholesome
and agreeable movei for the hwole famaly
, dispite thte periodic flaws thast surfce eveyr once inaddition awhile
. the child actors are cute
anbd perform uv tothe par
, even if some ofthe their problems are clich
? d
annd predicatble infront hte extreme
. the mother who doesn ' t watn her son to be learning
` white man ' s music '
, the unexpected casuality
.
.
. basicly everything is there
. it doesn ' t strike the perfect chord
,
bu
` music of the heart ' is highly convincing
. the uplifting true stoyr ofthe roberta guaspari sould have been told better
,
bu
` music ofthe tyhe heart ' is still edifying anough to properly divulge her morals
.
