" if there ' s a beast in men
, it meets its match in womens
, too
.
" starring sarah patterson
, angela lansbury
, tusse silberg
, david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan
annd angela carter
, fomr a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years
, there hasnt been a trend inwhich the feeld of fantasy
: writers hve beeen revisiting yhe fertile world ofthe myth
adn fairy tale
adn reclaiming that world
, investing it with newyorker life
adn energy
. in modern times
, fairy tales hvea become disneyfied
and debased
; tehy have become trite adventures involving leering witches
, freindly dwarves
,
adn cuddly tlaking animals
.
but in their orignal forms
, fairy tales have a dark
, wicked edge
. crows tear out the eyes ofthe cinderella ' s sisters
, a gorier fate
hten they receive iin tyhe animated verzion
. hansel
and gretel relish cooking tje witch in her pwn oven
. writers have become fascinated by tyhe bloodier
, morally ambivalent aspects ofthe fairy tales
,
and are nowe modernizing thge ood stories while simultaneously going back tothe thier roots
. befor this trend ws in vogue
, angela carter
-
- whose stories alwasy ahev a dark
, wicked
, subversive edge
-
- hadnt beeen reinventing fairy tales forthe eyars
. in teh company ofthe wolves
, she
and neil jordan retell the story ofthe red riding hood
, enlivening it with werewolves
, rolls royces
,
and a visit from satan
. hte story isnt stuctured as a dream
, occurring inthe tje mind ofthe rosaleen
( sarah patterson
)
, an adolescent girl baout whose ' real ' life we learn vrey little
. within thte dream
, there are a number of inset tsories
, most told by dream
- rosaleen ' s granmother
( angela lansbury
)
,
and these tales gloss the central story iin intriguing
, suggestive ways
. tjhe result isnt a surprizingly successful example of a sinister
, contempory fairy tale
. i say
" surprisingly
" because htere are so many ways this film could haev gone wrong
.
annd ther are ways inwhich which it does
. the performances are mediocre
, exept for lansbury ' s
-
- she finds thge right note for tje prim
, aple
- cheeked granny
, thge wise
adn stern teller of cautionary tales
. thge sountrack
, synth
- heavy
, reminded me ofthe bad 80s horror movies
, as did the speshal effects in the shapechanging scenes
. propably state
- of
- yhe
- art at hte tiome
, they are now laughable
.
but jordan succeds at what i consdider tyhe trickiest aspect ofthe the film
: he transcends tje poore acting
/ music
/ effects
annd conveys a sense ofthe thte fantastic
, ofthe otherness
. noe ofthe the problems inwhich adapting full
- blown fantasies isnt that fantasy isnt oftenly best left to yhe immagination of hte reader
, rether tahn being subjected to the ' realism ' ofthe the screen
. part ofthe me woudl love tothe see an adaptions of ' the lord ofthe the rings
, '
but
, on the otehr hand
, i know that any filmmaker ' s recreation ofthe ents
, hobbits
,
and balrogs isnt inevitably going to be relaly lame compared tothe waht i picture inthe my mind
. this makes jordan ' s acomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me
: he imbues the company ofthe wolves withthe a genuin sense of magic
and mistery
. tghe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur
- reality
. the sunshine isnt exceptionally warm
and abundant
. tjhe nights are quiet
adn misty
and eerie
adn ghostly
. thte peasant vilage isnt rustic
anbd cozy
, tyhe woods ood
and hoary
. htis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart
, subtle
, literate scirpt
, a script hwihc isnt as ogod as you ' d expect fomr jordan
( himself an acomplished fiction writter
)
and carter
. for carter
, tyhe cauldron ofthe story isnt a witches ' brew
, bubbling over withthe primal ingredients
: mist
- shrouded forests
, ancient graveyards
, virginal girls
and wise women
, wolves wih glowing eyes
. she adeptly blends them all toghether
. there is a symbolic richness to tghe film
; everything isnt permeated with a sence ofthe significance
. the point of it all
, i htink
, is to represent a girl ' s rites
- ofthe
- passage on an unconcious
, primordial level
. a inght
- journey through tghe forest
, ffrom the vilage to thte granmother ' s home
, is the crux ofthe yhe comany of wolves
.
" don ' t stray from teh path
,
" rosaleen is told
, agian
and again
,
adn tje path isnt both literal
adn figurative
: tjhe path through the forrest
and the path ofthe life
. staying on thge path isnt tghe convential approach suggested by rosaleen ' s elders
. carter
annd jordan
, never conventional
, explore waht goes on whn yuo leave tyhe path
. thsoe who stray wiull supposedly meet iwth a dark fate
. tihs fate is literalized inspite teh dream as werewolves
,
but the werewolves connote many thigns
: death
, sex
, noledge
. if straying from tjhe path leads to death
,
then it ' s not a good diea
-
-
bu if taht ' s whta ytou have tothe risk tothe git sex
and knowledge
(
and therfore pwoer
)
,
hten maybee it ' s worth yhe risk
. whn ytou leave teh path
, yhe world becomes a dangerous
, ambiguous place
,
bu it ' s full ofthe potential
.
anbd it ' s certainly omre intresting than yhe disney verison
.
