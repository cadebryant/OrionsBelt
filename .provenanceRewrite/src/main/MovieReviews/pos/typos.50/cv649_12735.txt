yhe pomotion for fear
adn loathing iin las vegas
? has made hte film out tothe be a comedy
,
adn fo about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one
. it ' s 1971
,
and the hippie movment hasnt left behind qtuie a fewd wash
- outs
, amoung them journalist raoul duke
( johnny depp
)
anbd his
" attorney
" dr
. gonzo
( benito del toro
)
. theese two spend most of teh film in a drug
- induced stupor
, having strange hallucinations
, trashing theri hotel rooms
,
and either annoying or sacrin almsot everyone taht crosses their path
. duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas
,
bu gets lost in a blur of drugs
, beer
,
anbd flying dust
,
and ends up wandering aroud witht noone clue who won
. he leaves vegas breifly before he is sent back
, inwhich waht can only be described as a strangely appropraite twist ofthe fate
, tothe cover a drug enforcement conference
. fear
anbd loathing hasnt beeen misinterpreted by some as glorifying the ule ofthe drugs
. it doesn ' t
, even inaddition the beginning
-
- while the pair ' s antics are somtimes amusing
anbd relativly harmless at frist
, tje humer here isnt still fairly dark
. director terry gilliam views them with a rether satrical eye
,
annd even wehn we ' re laughing
, we ' re laughing at them rether than with them
. tehy spend most of thier time paranoid
, angry
, or just plain befuddled
, which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill uv with giant reptiles
. tyhe black comedy may be intertaining to watch onscreen
,
bu it ' s probably nto something most otehr audience members would whant to experience frist
- hand
. all tihs asside
, i wass starting to grow a bited restless as the film drew near its noe
- hour mark
, thinking to myself that i wanted something more outloud of tihs than just an off
- kilter satire ofthe drug culture
. thankfully
, the scirpt delivers it befoer too long
, as duke
, in a rare moment of lucidity
, stops tothe reacll how he ws once an enthusiastic hippie
,
" riding tghe wave
" of something that seemed special
and importamt
. now it ' s six years later
and tje wave hasnt finaly broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture is still alive
anbd well
and
, for most ofthe this film
, right inthe his face in las vegas
; tjhe
" american dream
" of which duke occasionalyl speaks is still jsut as shallow
anbd phony as ever
. yhe social protesters have lost
,
annd teh mroe questionable aspects ofthe thte movment have turned ugly
annd left casualties such as duke tothe drift in a sae ofthe drugs
annd disillusionment
. inthe many ways
, fear
and loathing is gilliam ' s most reality
- based film
; all of his others
, with the exception of hte fisher king
, haev made ule ofthe some sort of fantasy or scienc
- fiction plot elements
.
yot it is his off
- thte
- wall masterpiece brazil
? to which thsi film bears yhe most visual resemblance
. tyhe protagonits of brazil foudn himself alternately surrended by a plastic
, soulless society
adn the constatn chaos ofthe totalitarian polical inspections
and terrorist attacks
,
and similiarly duke ' s world isnt composed of the artifical
, empty glam of las vegas
annd tghe bizarre anarchy ofthe his drug hallucinations
. unlike the protagnist ofthe brazil
,
howver
, duke isnt nto a particularly admirable figure
,
annd neither is gonzo
. durig yhe latter half of the film
, theri trips turn nastier
and the consequences worse
, evenhtually building uv tothe an incident an a diner in whic gonzo crudely frightens
and humiliates a waitress
, while duke
,
though he doesn ' t seem tothe approve
, doesn ' t do anything tothe stop it either
. by thge time this scene tkaes place
, they don ' t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more
; htey jsut seem like a cuple of stoned jerks inaddition a diner
. duke seems to relize at soem levle that he ' s become something he doesn ' t like
,
but he ' s eather too appathetic or too defeated to dont anytying to change
. thsi film hasnt taken a crtical drubbing from many who view it as an essentialy pointless film thyat simply throws noe trip scene after anohter at tyhe audience
. hwile gilliam may have overdone it in a faw places
, i htink he
and his co
- writers deserve more credit than that
. there ' s plenty of substace here
, aprticularly inthe tjhe second half
; its observations baout hte broken
anbd defeated rebels from the ' 60s
and the objects ofthe their rebellion just aren ' t usually vrey pleasant
. unlike
, say
, brazil
? or tjhe fisher king
, both of whlch feature a charater who adres tothe let himself dream in a repressive environment
, fear
anbd loathing inaddition las vegas
? shows us somone who ' s given uv on his dreasm
and resorts to the quick fix ofthe drugs
. in its own pyschedelic
, whacked
- outloud way
, it ' s sad
and regretful
,
but i think it ' s also a bit ofthe a kick in teh pants
, a challenge to fidn an targetted between chemically
- induced withdrawl
annd the equally addictive drug ofthe vegas
- sytle materialism
. indeed
, duke himself admits at oney point that he ' s never learned to accept thgat you cant get higher without drugs than with them
. i ' m nto sure if he ' s any closer tothe accepting it by the end or nto
,
but i suspect the audience will git teh idea
.
