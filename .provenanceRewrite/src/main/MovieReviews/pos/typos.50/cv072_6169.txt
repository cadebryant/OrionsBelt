tghe long kiss goodnight
( r
) meryl streep tried it
and failed
. even pamela anderson lee made an attempt
but fell flat onthe her well
- bared assets
.
however
, geena davis coudl very well become thge first bankable american female acation star with teh long kiss goodnight
, a preposterous
bu incredibly funn acation thriller directed by her husban
, renny harlin
. davis plays samantha caine
, a mousy suburban skool teacher
and mother whose memories only go bcak eight yeras
. with thge help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, she slowly remembers
-
-
and reclaims
-
- her past as charly baltimore
, tough
- as
- nails cia operative
. needless to say
, with teh reappearance ofthe samantha
/ charly comes yhe apearance ofthe an assortment ofthe noone
- goodniks out tothe erase mroe than her memory
. shane black netted a kool
$ 4 mil forthe his scirpt
; i ' m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag
,
bu forthe what it ' s worth
, it delivers the goods
. like black ' s previvous work
, such as lethal weppon
anbd the lastest boy scout
, thge scirpt juggles soem impressive action scenes wiht funny
, quirky dialogue
. thte humor especialy works well inaddition thsi case
, for the story is so preposterous thta tghe laughs halp tothe keep things from tkaing things too seriously
.
bu ther ' s no ragument taht tyhe more unbeleivable sequences are original
adn entertaining as hell
: who cant resist tje sight of davis tossing her daugher fomr a hole inspite her house into tje nearbye treehouse or chasing affter a car
.
.
. hwile ice skating
? jackson
annd davis make a good team
. jackson isnt funny as ever as ever
; inthe fact
, his spirited line deliveries
, expecially whn he first appears
, are omre thna reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction
. as ogod as he isnt
, thge oney who shouldnt benefit the most fomr this project is davis
, who shows much promise as an acation heroine
. what mkaes her so effective
adn why she shoudln succeed where streep
annd lee failed is that she doesn ' t take herself too seriously
. she is obviously in on teh joke
, slyly taking jabs at herself
and at teh situation
. this is not tothe say that she doesn ' t ened work
-
- somtimes she lays on tje
" toughness
" a bited too thick
and comes off too much as a charicatoor
.
bu shoud teh public embrace the film
and
, inspite turn
, tje notion of a kick
- ass female
, davis could have found her speshal niche
. it seems as if davis
and harlin ' s firt collaberation
, the middling pirate epic cutthroat island
, wass just a dress rehearsal
( albeit a very costly oen
) fo long kiss
, iin whihc the wief
- husban team hit theri acation stride
. anyone simpley looking for a funn
, escapist enteratinment taht requires little
- tothe
- noone thingking will find thsi film tothe be a more
- than
- welcome kiss
.
