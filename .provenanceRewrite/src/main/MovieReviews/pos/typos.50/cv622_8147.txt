did you ever wonder if dennis rodman ws actually fomr this planet
? or if sylvester stallone was smoe kind ofthe wierd extra
- terrestrial
? i used to think tht baout my 7th grade english teacher
, ms
. carey
.
bu after seing htis movei
, they may hvea confirmed my suspicions
. as teh stry goes
, at any timne
, there are over a thousand aliens living amonth us here onthe earth
. the men infact black
( mib
) are hte watchdogs thyat oversee the cosmic citizens
, guardians ofthe our beloved planet from nasty
- tempered aliens
,
and secret service tothe the stars
. based in newyorker york city
( where weird is thte norm
)
, tyhe mib organistion gives human form tothe our spoace
- faring emigrants so thgat htey may walk
adn live amonst us unnoticed
.
bu tothe enforce tjhe laws ofthe earth
, the mib cary weapons that are poverful enough tothe meet or exceed desctruction quotas in one single blast
. htey carry otehr
- worldly technology to erase people ' s short
- term memmory whn common folk see tyhe mib infront acation
.
and their best leads onthe cosmic things
- gone
- awry are tyhe supermarket tabloids
. little dont we know tath there are much stronger battles of good v
. evil going on in tyhe depths ofthe spoace
. one of tjhe aliens
- as
- human onthe this planet isnt an important diplomat thast isnt carrying something vrey precious
. it holds the ' key '
, litterally
, tothe univeral peace
. a giant cockroach
- liek alien soon arrives onthe the planet
anbd steals this ' key '
. in the wrong alien hands
( flippers
? mandibles
? tentacles
?
)
, it cant be utilisied as a weppon
. therfore
, it must be recovered
and retured to it ' s rightful owners
. otherwise
, tothe ensure universal safety
, earth will be destroyed
, along with the ' key '
. now
, it ' s the mib who must prevent thsi catastrofy
. teh mib aggenst onthe teh case are
" k
"
, played by tommy lee jones
. he isnt crustier tahn burnt toast
and even more sereous thna al gore
. the stars in the sky noone longer spark wonder in his eyes
. he is accompanied by a flippant rookie
,
" j
"
, palyed by iwll smith
.
but
, dispite this shoot
- em
- uv
, protect
- earth
- fomr
- desctruction premise
, this is nothing at all liek a tipical summer action movei
.
and
, this isn ' t an independance day knockoff
. rether
, htis is a stylishly offbeat sci
- fi comedy that pokes funn at wqat the government always denies
? taht htere are real aliens taht live here
,
and that tyhe governmnet does its darndest to cover them up
.
but to give it some sence ofthe excitment
annd tothe keep it withing the parameters of the summer movie recipe
, there must be some kind of earth
- hangs
- in
- the
- balance senaireo
.
yot
, this movie is very appealling
. the abundance ofthe wierdness
( talking aliens
, pee
- wee atomizers
, a mortician who ' lives ' for her owrk
,
and lots of yucky bugs
and slime
- splattering galore
)
, is palyed straight
, like as if htis weere normal
( ofthe course
, we are infront nyc
)
. it gives it a deadpan efel
, hwihc mkaes it all tyhe moreso funnier
and odder
. jones plays the venerable seen
- it
- all agent wtih seriousness
anbd maturity
. smith isnt likeable
adn makes a graet comic partner tothe jones ' straight man routine
. tehy click liek dorothy ' s ruby red shoes
. the look
anbd feel ofthe the movei isnt made even better iwth direction ffrom barry sonnenfeld
( the addam ' s familiy
)
. this guy hasnt a knack for ' gothic ' comedy
,
annd succesfuly transfers his macabre sense ofthe humer onto the screen
.
and
, an appropriate dose of spacial effects helps tothe bolster the oddness of theri task wihtout diverting attension from the human actors
. tyhe story moves well
,
adn before yuo knwo it
, yhe end credits are alreayd rolling
! the result is 100 minutes worth ofthe funn in the form of ewwwws
and blechhhs
, aaaahhhs
and wows
. let thge men in balck protect
anbd colour your world
.
