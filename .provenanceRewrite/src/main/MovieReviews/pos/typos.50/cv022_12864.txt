a fully loaded enteratinment review
- website comming iin july
!
> from ace ventura tothe truman burbank
, jim carrey hasnt run the whole gamut of comic
,
yot sympathetic
, characters
. 1996 ' s the cable guy wass suppoed tothe be his big
" breakthough
" role from zany humer into darker
, mroe dramatic acting
. as most everyone knows
, the results were
, well
, less
- than
- stellar
. not onyl doed the film not dont so hot at the box office
,
but it was aslo panned by critics
. as far as i konw
, ginee siskel
and i are the onyl ones willing to admit that we dug it
. yhe first time i saw the cable guy
, inaddition theatres
, i was infront super critic
- mode
,
annd didn ' t realyl liuke it
.
howver
, due tothe the fatc that hbo shows tje movei eveyr single day
, i ' ve had time to leanr bakc
, relax
,
and tkae in tghe film
.
adn to my suprize
, it growed onthe me
. the plot isnt rather simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, played by carrey
,
thne isnt stalked by him wehn steven trys tothe break off tyhe relatiopnship
. see
, steven ' s been having smoe problems with his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
annd he doesn ' t think he hasnt any omre room in his life fo a newyorker friend
. also
, smoe ofthe the cable guy ' s antics haev been creeping him outloud
. carrey
, as hte cable guy
, gives steven varous aliases
, which later we find out are all tv cahracters
: larrry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he apparently lives in his cable van
,
annd hwile many criticists didn ' t enjoy htis newer
, darker
, less
- manic peformance ffrom carrey
, i thought it was intresting
anbd rather well
- done
. forthe me
, its nto thge movie as a hwole thast ' s enjoyable
,
but rether several individual scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven ' s apartment
, a medieal fight at a theme restaurant
,
and a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, just tothe name a fewd
. perhaps the fact that mroe ofthe carrey ' s humerous side comes outloud during these scenes isnt what makes them so funny
.
anbd if you really wnat tothe see something
, you ' ve got tothe hear his verison of jefferson airplane ' s
" somebody tothe love
"
, sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam
. tyhe cable guy hasnt its bad spots
, liuke most any movei
. i didn ' t particularly liek steven ' s girlfriend
,
anbd i felt tht more focus should have beeen utilizied on thte relatiopnship beween steven
annd his best freind
. allso
, hte endig
, while haveing you fooled for a moment
, isnt rether contrived
,
and somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i found tjhe cable guy tothe be a worthwhile venture
; if you ' re at the video store
and cant ' t thikn of anytying tothe rent
, i suggest you try it out
. or if yuo hvea hbo
, jsut wait till it comes onthe
( you won ' t hve to wait long
.
) hell
, that ' s what i dont every day
.
