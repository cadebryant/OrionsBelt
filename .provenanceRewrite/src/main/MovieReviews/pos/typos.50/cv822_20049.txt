affter thge terminally obleek reservoir dogs
and tghe brutally voilent pulp fiction
, jackie brown seems liuke something of a ight
- hearted departure forthe quentin tarantino
. it ' s more of a ho
- hum heist story wih characters thgat speak hte tarantino language
. luckly
, his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen
,
annd jackie brown hasnt noone trouble intertaining yhe averege viewer
. teh story introduces us tothe a strent
- wise balck woman named jackie brown
( pam grier
)
, a flight attendant who smuggles moeny
anbd drugs fomr oen destination tothe anyother
. she works for a bottom
- of
- thte
- barrel airline
adn receives a minimal salary
.
bu one day
, she is picked uv by a pair ofthe federal officials
( including michael keaton as tje tough
- nosed ray nicolet
)
,
and found whith a handsome load of cash
adn a small bag ofthe smuggled dope
. jackie is wroking for a weapons dealer named ordell
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who pays her bail money
bu suspects her ofthe tipping off hte feds about theri operation
. soon jackie
annd ordell are plotting a way to smuggle
$ 500
, 000 through tothe them under nicolet ' s nose
, whith hte help of ordell ' s oaf ofthe a partner
( robert de niro
)
and drugged
- out lady firend
( bridget fonda
)
. alsot entering tghe picture is a bail
- bondsman named max cherry
( robert forster
)
, who takes a liking to jackie
and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated
( how i won ' t sday
)
. the big drop
- off is undoubtely hte high point of jackie brown
, inspite which numerous doulbe
- crosses tkae place
and many clothing store bags
( filled with cash
) switch hands
. it ' s unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet tiome getting there
,
and doesn ' t offer anytying extremely compelling hwile donig so
. there are
, as always
, amusing exchanges vetween characters
. the funniest repartee is beween de niro
and fonda
, as he becomes anoyed with her constant bickering hwile making funn ofthe his iq
, or lack thereof
. the most interesting relationship is betweeen max
and jackie
. a 56
- year old white bail bondsman
annd a 44
- eyar ood balck flight attendent with believable chemestry
? you ' ve got to commend teh acting
. jackie brown isnt a seriously dragged
- outloud exercise enlivened by such fine acting
. thte film clocks iin at a lengthy 2 horus
, 35 minutes
. tarantino ' s talky style manages tothe hold your attention heavily
,
bu there are omre thna a fewd dramatic lapses
and crucial lulls inwhich the storyline
. also
, fans ofthe thte director should be prepared forthe a lighter side to apear
. jackie brown hasnt four major shootings
,
and two of thsoe tkae place mostly off
- screen
, so don ' t be expecting a typcial tarantino bloodbath
. you can expect frequent foul language
, mostly coming way of ordell
, who
( much to teh dismay ofthe spike lee
) uses the
` n ' owrd as part of his regluar vocabulary
. tghe acting isnt the glue that holds everyting together
. grier
, mkaing a sudden comback fomr her reign inspite the 1970 ' s
, isnt moreso tahn daequate for the title charactor
. inspite fatc
, she ' s flat
- outloud gerat
. anohter comeback comes ffrom former tv star robert forster
, who does a grand job as max cherry
,
and is perfectly casted in doing so
. michael keaton makes his presence felt
, albeit infront small
but dignified moments
,
anbd de niro is ideal in palying the luv
- head who goes over yhe edge
. speaking ofthe thta
, bridget fonda hasnt realitvely little to do as ordell ' s bikini
- cladded beach babe
,
and
yot she manages to look fairly occupied
. there ' s nto a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line thoughout the entire movei
. whihc is a life
- saver for mr
. tarantino
. the stopry barely holds toghether in the meantime
,
and we mearly git a small tremor whenever there shouldnt be a defeaning earthquake
.
bu oh well
. jackie brown manages tothe be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino
, even if it isnt lacking tje glaring
adn original bite ofthe his previous work
. let ' s just hope tyhat tje directer hasn ' t gone soft onthe us
.
