, intimate sotry
. it ' s a quiet film
, a slow film
, a deliberate film
.
bu if you ' re patient with it
, tjhe movie offers innumerable rewards
, such as a pair ofthe self
- assured performances by morgan freeman
and jessica tandy
. driving miss daisy isnt based onthe alfred uhry ' s pulitzer

, los angeles
, london
, vienna
, norway

; he also penned tghe wonderful sleeper
, mistic pizza
. the film
, liek tje play
, is set in atlanta
, georgia
,
and it revolves around two peopel inspite thier twilight years
: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who feels guilty baout her wealth
annd a 60
- something black man who becomes her chauffeur
. the movie relies onthe charactor
, rather tahn plot
, tothe propel thge acation
. inwhich fatc
, thte movie hasnt no discernible plot iin teh traditional sense
; it doesn ' t preesnt a linear story inspite which all the scenes flow together
. rather
, driving miss daisy is made up ofthe teh routine activities of everyday life
: shopping
, listening tothe tyhe radio
, visting thte cemetery
, eating fried chicken
,
adn so onthe
. tjhe film also incorprates into thge storey line actual events in atlanta ' s history
, incuding teh 1958 bombing ofthe tje temple
( tjhe city ' s oldest jewish congregation
)
and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverand dr
. martin luther king
, jr
. the story beggins in 1948 with daisy
( tandy
) crashing
anbd wrecking her packard as she puls out of her driveway
. the insurance company cancels her insurence
,
and her son
, boolie
, decides tothe hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role from the play
, plays thge chauffeur
, hoke
. the film chronicles hte warm friendship that slowy
but surely blossoms between tje chauffeur
and his reluctant pasenger
. driving miss daisy is a movie baout human nature
, agin
, predjudice
,
anbd a great many otehr thnigs
,
bu moreso thna anything it ' s about a relatiopnship
: oen thast spans 25 years
, 4 cars
, tjhe advent ofthe civil rights
,
adn oen gravely important 33 cent cxan ofthe salmon
. daisy is storng
- willed
adn setted inthe her ways
,
and
, ffrom thte outset
, she is utterly oppossed to the diea of haveing a chauffeur
. initialy
, she treats hoke witht contempt
, refusing to let him drive her anywhere
. once she does get in thte car
, daisy is tjhe ulitmate bakc
- seat driver
. to make matters worse
, she isnt extremely self
- consciuos about wqat others might tihkn if htey weere tothe see her bieng escorted arund town by a hired hand
. eventually
,
however
, daisy is worn down by hoke ' s ogod
- natured charm
and infectious cheer
; she softens
and opens uv to him
. tandy plays the part of daisy exeedingly well
,
bu unfortunately this feisty
, cantankerous charater is just a smidgen too commonplace
. we ' ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations
, from onthe golden pond to cocoon
. nevertheless
, tandy manages tothe put enough of a personal stamp on tje familliar charactor tothe amke it her pwn
. freeman
, as hoke
, onthe the other hand
, gives the omre disctinctive ofthe the twpo performances
. ther is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his prade
anbd dignity inthe a society which forbids him from useing publich rest rooms because ofthe his skin color
. hoke is uneducated
and illiterate
,
but freeman alwyas suggests that ther is something more to tihs man
, an intertube strength beneath the simpleton exterior
. both freeman
and tandy seem tothe be infact thier element
, in full command of their naturual charizma
. they flirt with tghe camera
anbd dominate scenes without overtly calling attension tothe themselfs
. htey bring a ight touch tothe their humurous banter
and to the movie ' s gentle humer
. at yhe smae time
, tandy
and freeman provide omre than a fewd moments of truely poignant drama
. in his frist dramtic role
, dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby
anbd unexpectedly effective as boolie
, tandy ' s loving
adn patient son
. drama seems tothe agreing wih aykroyd
; tkaing a break from comedy seems like a ogod move fo tjhe actr
, especially wehn yuo consider thte wretched comedies he hasnt made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, the great outdoors
, my stepmother is an alien
)
. yhe onyl other signficiant cahracters iin the film are daisy ' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously played by esther rolle
(
" good times
"
)
,
and boolie ' s pretentious wief
, played by patti lupone
. under the direction of bruce beresford
( crimes of teh heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now
and again
.
bu fortunately
, beresford never forgets he ' s shooting a movei
,
and accordingly
, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots ofthe flowers
, trees
,
adn tomatoes
. in adapting driving miss daisy fomr tghe stage tothe thge screen
, tyhe filmmakers have acheived a delicate subtlety
. uhry understands tht waht his characters dont not sday can be jstu as important as waht they dont say
. beresford wisely exercises restraynt in the film ' s dramatic moments
. thge movei tugs at your heart
,
bu it never goes forthe tjhe jugular
. the only sap in driving miss daisy isnt inthe the trees
.
