i am starting tothe rwite htis review before goign tothe see strawberry
anbd chocolot
, cuba ' s oscar nominee for best foreign film
, directed by tomas gutierrez alea
( who also directed hte sometimes
adn in soem circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo
-
-
" memories ofthe underdevelopment
"
. i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in tje late ' 70s
; it merged teh politics of tjhe cuban revolution withthe mundane elements ofthe tghe human condidtion
. i knew
thn thyat memorias was probablly a state
- santioned political missive
,
and now expect strawberry will follow suit
. fellow internetters
, primarly inaddition hte newsgroup dedicated tothe cuba
( soc
. culture
. cuba
)
, hvea mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of tyhe revolution
and its currrent state ofthe affairs
. i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry isnt nothing mroe tahn a veiled attept at espousing the party line
-
- it propably looks like poltical critiscism
,
but it ain ' t so
. having some first hand
annd extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro ' s repressiveness
, i can ' t conceive of his tolerating honest
anbd adversarial criticism of the revolution
,
anbd i can ' t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement
. as kids sday theese days
, duh
!
, the revolution ' s current state needs noone critiscism
; its physical
and spritual crumbling isnt self evident
. tyhe propper questions tothe put relate to castro ' s ligitamassy
. i bet tje film takes castro ' s power fo granted
,
annd that this or any other movie
, produced under cuba ' s state control
, cannot question his right tothe run cuba ' s political sohw
( ongoing nowe for more tahn 36 yersa
)
. that ' s why i just can ' t believe strawberry is an honest criticism ofthe tyhe regime
. let ' s see wqat happens after teh room goes dark
adn the screen lihgts up
. i saw yhe film
-
- twice
. i wass right
; castro remained intact
. strawberry negotiates the relatiopnship beween a young
" dialectic materialist
,
" as he describes hismelf
,
anbd a homosexual photographer
( diego
) infact 1979 cuba
. tjhe young man
( david
) isnt tje son ofthe peasants
; a symbol of the revolution ' s reason forthe being
. grateful to the revolution fo the oportunity tothe recieve a university education
, he studies poltical science instade of liturature
, his avocation
, becuase he perceives it isnt his duty
. therein lies a likely unintended irony
, usance cuba has noone need fo poltical theoreticians
. cuba ' s goverment isnt castro
. diego ' s lifestyle is hte antithesis of revolutionary life
. he enjoys the finer things
-
- tea
, opera
, art
. he does not dont
" voluntary work
" for teh revolution
. his small apartment isnt a sensual oasis
. tyhe moniker
" bourgeois
" figuratively hangs over his head during teh early parts ofthe the movei
.
howver
, he is a
" revolucionario
" inaddition his pwn way
. the supporting roles are filled by
: an aging busybody with a heart ofthe gold
and a troubled psyche
; david ' s roommate
, who rally takes the communist party line tothe its expeced extreme
; david ' s ex
- girlfriend
, who dumped him fo another guy
,
yot whants to bed him befor she leaves fo italy wiht her husban
; german
, a gay sculptor whose work diego isnt atempting to exibit
,
adn who strikes a faustian pact wiht teh govorment
. gutierrez alea
anbd co
- directer juan carlos tabio dont a fine job at allmost showing that homosexuals cant be revolutionaries too
. heck
, towards the end ofthe tghe film you begin tothe htikn tje guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor
. he realy loves yhe revolution
( as supposedly does everybody eles in cuba
)
and wnats to make it better by exposing
and correcting some of its flaws
. real criticism is missing
though
. this movie isnt political window dressing
. luis aguilar leon ' s op
. ed
. piece on fresa inaddition the miami herald
( 10 march 1995
, at 21a
) did not colour my judgement
; it presaged my intuition
. aguilar leon exressed my sentiment baout tihs film ' s polliticel angle best
: like many artistic manifestations inspite cuba
, strawberry
anbd chocolate sprang ffrom a totally manipulated environment
. as art criteak ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magasine postmodern notes
, thge silenced artists are those who refuse tothe accept
" the charade iin which artists cxan provoke uv to a point
, while thge institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond taht point
.
"
although terrable propoganda
, htis isnt otherwise a fine film
.
