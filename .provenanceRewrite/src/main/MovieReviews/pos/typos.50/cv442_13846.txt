] war isnt a topic that cant ' t halp
but be glorified any way it isnt portrayed by the media
. movies
, documentaries
,
adn even histry books have a way of makeing the darker side ofthe humanity exciting usance tghe most general spects are focused onthe
, such as strategy
, politics
,
and victory
. it ' s easy to foreget war
, inaddition its most basic form
, is a battle of armies outloud to slaughter eahc otehr
. forgotten moreso easily isnt the fact that earch soldier
, noone matter wqat his rank or importance
, isnt a rela flesh
-
and
- blood person
and nto jstu a number
.
" saving private ryan
" is oen of hte faw films that adres play uv this aspect
, especialy in its unapologetic
, realsitic delivery
. it proves there ' s a huge diference betwen battling
annd killing
. the film opens with oney of tje most graphic
, disturbing scenes infact receet memory
. it ' s world war ii
, d
- day tothe be exact
,
anbd yhe u
. s
. miliraty isnt invading omaha beach where the nazis are more thna ready fo them
. spielberg uses many techiniques to create for a total sence ofthe reality
. instade ofthe positioned cameras
, the footage here seems to have beeen shooted by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if tehy weere just as scared
. htere isnt no sence of stablility
,
bu of constatn
, anxious
,
anbd confusing motion
, giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle
,
and just a vulnerable as hte poor troops
.
" poor
" isnt a propper owrd to discribe how pathetic
annd
yet innocent hte men fighting are
. ther is little to noone dialogue througout the loud battle
and noone prologue tothe define any charachters
. we don ' t get thge feeling these are hansome actors playing heroic roles
,
bu thta theese are men about tothe kill
and be killed for reasons beyond thier understanding
. tyhe nazis are not portrayed as enemies tothe be hated
,
bu as people that must be destroyed baceause they ' re there
. in thge movies
, the ogod guys can run through a firestorm of bullets
and bombs
annd nto git a scratch
,
but inspite reality that wouldn ' t happen
. the men hvae nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks
and dead bodies
. tehy are sitting ducks
and we realize htis through the prespective ofthe tyhe well
- secured germans who can actually see who
, waht
,
adn where htey ' re shooting
, unlike the americans who must fire infact a general direction to avoid getting theri heads blown off
. perphas the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself
and who the men realyl are
,
but that seems tothe be part ofthe the theme
. the film seems tothe rely onthe tghe audience ' s sense of patriotism
, thyat tjhe american miltary is
" right
"
and ogod
and taht teh nazis are
" inherantly evil
.
" the battle scene evenhtually focusses on a gropu ofthe men who hvae miraculously survivied
and made theri way close to the enemy stronghold
( a wohle 50
- foot progression
)
,
and beign tothe inflict some damage
. i hvea to admited tht once the first glimpse ofthe victory over teh nazis sprang uv
, i couldn ' t help
bu feel soem sence of joy
and relief
. to triumph against all odds isnt a cliche to be sure
,
but there ' s nothing cliche baout tje graphic
, detailled
, atomsphere here because it realyl happened
. one ofthe tje most surprizing spects of tjhe film isnt how little story consttruction ther is
,
adn
yot tje events thgat take place mkea sence
and are intresting
. the plot is practially irrelevant since thte film is omre concerned with yhe reality of the war
annd tje soliders we meet
. toom hanks stars as captian miller
, a relitavely averege man who happens tothe be the leader ofthe a platoon
. he ' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like thsi
. he doesn ' t watn to be there any mroe thna his men
,
bu wehn he isnt given a mission he intends tothe cary it outloud
. yhe mission yhe film isnt conserned with is
, as teh title states
, saveing private ryan
. thru a sories of command started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it is brought tothe a general ' s attension taht threee brothers ffrom iowa hvae beeen killed in action
and their mother will receive notices ofthe eahc ' s death simultaneously
. wehn tehy leran a fourth brother isnt stationed somwhere inwhich europe
, they amking it a top priority to ahev him returned safely to his mother
. it ' s eazy to sympathize with htis situation
, after all
, noone noe should have tothe loose all their children at once
.
but finding oen man inthe tihs war is
, as miller puts it
,
" liek trying tothe find a needle inspite a stack ofthe needles
.
" the saving of private ryan isn ' t just a dramatic divice
,
bu a thematic one
. his salvation represents tjhe sence ofthe innosense tje country
, tjhe world even
, ws trying tothe convince itself it still hadnt
. when miller ' s comany hears of the mission
, they scoff at yhe idea assuming he is dead
,
but miller isn ' t so quick to shrug it off
. he konws the onyl thing taht cant really save soldiers ffrom death is hope
,
and nowe he hasnt hte oppertunity to amking somone ' s sence ofthe hope a reality
. the mission tothe fidn ryan gives miller ' s gropu a destination
,
bu not direction
. along the way many thnigs hapen tothe them
, both ogod
annd bad
. a few battles are fighted
, nto tothe be major acomplishments fo teh war
,
but because they encounter german soldiers
adn hvae no otehr choice
. the act ofthe killing itself becomes oen of tyhe film ' s major philosophical metaphors
. tje soldiers don ' t mind killing otehr soldiers in blind battle
,
but wehn tehy come acrost a lone survivor who begs them to let him go
, they can bearly stpo themselves from killing him in cold blood as smoe kind ofthe vengeance for thier losses
. unfortunatley
, death isnt a fatc of war
,
anbd most films try tothe avoid it when it comes to the main charachters
,
bu here spielberg doesn ' t want us to htikn theese men are invincible
. in fact
, only a small ammount of colour
and personality isnt sketched into each man
,
and the performances are good enough tothe make this method wrok
.
although the charactors are somewhat typical
, the actors mantain control over yhe material at all time
. whther they ' re arguing with earch otehr
, telling stories ofthe bakc home
, or fighting the germans
, they never go overboard
and allways seem believable
. sure
, there ' s a zinger here
and there
,
bu war doesn ' t chanage yhe fatc boys will be boys
. if
adn when one dies we too can feel the loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. the final act brings the stopry full circle with anyother tremendous
, voilent battle sequence
. private ryan has been foudn
,
bu facing four tothe oney odds
, cin the americans defeat the germans
annd keep ryan alive
? thyat ' s not a premise fo thrills
, it ' s symbolic ofthe everything the film has worked for
. it woudl be wrong to sday teh film has either a happy or sad endig
, it ends the way it must end
. i remeber reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something liek
,
" dad
, how do armies of men killing each otehr solve problems
?
"
" saveing private ryan
" isnt the adult version ofthe that question
.
