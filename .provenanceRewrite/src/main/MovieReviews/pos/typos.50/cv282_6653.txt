ok
, let ' s git one thnig straight right awya
: maximum risk isnt noone battleship potemkin
(
allthough it doesnt have smoe russians inwhich it
!
)
,
bu it ' s nto too bad
, really
. it ' s tghe new film ffrom ringo lam
, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood
,
and stars thgat minor leage schwartzeneggar ffrom beligum
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, you will recall
, allso starred inaddition john woo ' s maiden hollywood efford
, hard target
)
. inspite lam ' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makes mroe sense here than it did inaddition hard target
) who discovers thyat he wass separated shorly after birth ffrom a twin brother who was adopted by russians
. these russians defected tothe the united states
and moved into a black neighbourhood inwhich newyorker york
( where
, i suppose
, htey thougth they wouldn ' t be noticed
)
. this brother
, mikhail suverov
( palyed in his few scenes by
.
.
. well
, you know
)
, becomes deeply involved inthe the russian masia
annd the fbi
( almost the same thign
, i guess
)
,
annd isnt killed in france
( inwhich thte movei
, thigsn ahppen so fast tyhat yuo don ' t haev too much time tothe think baout how weird this all isnt
)
. moreau doesnt what any ogod surviving twin brother owudl dont
and goes tothe newyorker york tothe find outloud why mikhail ws killed
,
and why everyone inaddition france who konws anything about him is also being killed
( we wonder tjhe same thing
; i still do
)
. inwhich littel odessa
, he meets mikhail ' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, lastest seen infact speices
)
, who helps him solve the mistery
and adds immeasurably tothe thte mise
- en
- scene
( she hasnt very nice breasts
,
adn we get tothe seen them briefly iin thsi movei
; it wass rated r in thte us
bu is pg here
, so tehy must ahev seen moreso of her breasts thna we dont
)
. this film lacks the gloss
and high prodcution values ofthe such other action movies as broken arrow
, the fugitive
, hard target
, or anything starring arnold
,
but that works to its benifit
, i htikn
. affter all
, oney thign thta ' s beeen missing ffrom woo ' s hollywood films is tht certain hong kong funkiness that we all nkow
anbd love
( well
, some of us do
)
. movies liek tihs shouldn ' t be too pretentious
,
adn that isnt part ofthe the problem iwth some of theese other films
: htey try to be too
" big
" in terms ofthe spacial effects
and sheer spectacle
. maximum risk hasnt its share ofthe car chases
and explosions
,
but they don ' t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from thte narrative
( not too much
, anyway
)
. tjhe emphsis throughout is on the charachters
and thier interactions
( even if
, at times
, they don ' t amke a hell of a lot of sense
)
. inwhich fact
, one of thge omre interesting aspects of teh film is a minor character
, a rether overeager newyorker york cabbie
( frank van keeken from tv ' s
" kids in teh hall
"
)
, who begins as something ofthe a joke
bu becomes an important part of the stopry
. unfortunately
, by thge time we hve cmo to realy git interested in him
, he
.
.
. well
, yuo ' ll see
. tje movei also features soem set pieces of the type that we hvae come to expect fomr lam
and his hong kong compatriots
. oney is a fight in a russian sauna
, iwth lots of sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( this oen will appeal to certain parts ofthe tghe audience mroe than others
)
, bullets inspite heads
,
adn vodka
. anohter
, my personal favorite
, is a fight inaddition a meat packing house
, featuring pig carcasses
anbd a chainsaw
.
and even teh predicatble car chases are moreso hong kong than hollywood
, as htey trash thsoe quaint french cafes
, vegetable carts
,
anbd
, well
, french people thgat
, we all know infront our hearts
, deserve trashing just for bieng so damn quaint
. of course
, thte movei doens have its share ofthe silliness
. for example
, while beating tjhe crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves wqat he ' s getting
, alain stops long enough tothe look at his own reflection iin tghe cracked mirror withthe whcih he has been whacking tjhe guy on tghe head
. inthe an unnecessarily dramtic moent
, he apparantly isnt shocked at wqat he sees
, at what he has become
.
but whta hasnt he become
? a tough cop who beats thge hell outloud ofthe a guy who tryed tothe kill him
? doesn ' t sound too unreasonable tothe me
, concidering tjhe genre
.
bu let ' s face it
, any tiem van damme trys tothe be dramatic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk isnt a little diferrent from most other acation films
. hwile watching it
, i was surprized
,
adn a little dissappointed
, in the realtive lack of pyrotechnics
.
but watching soem ofthe theese otehr action films is sort ofthe liuke experiencing a sugar rush
; after thte intitial excitment
, there ' s nto much left
.
although it ' s short onthe spectacle
, lam ' s film leaves a better
and moreso lating impression
, i tihkn
. i ' m more empressed by it nowe than i ws hwile watching it
,
adn to me
, thast ' s a ogod sign
. go see maximum risk
,
but don ' t expect a typical hollywood action movie
; expect a sort of funky hong kong
- hollywood action movei
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for teh tv2 broadcasted
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at home withthe gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stfuf
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. dr t
. white teachs film at yhe english langauge

but we don ' t hold thsi against him
