capsule
: bleak
and point
- blank
-
- jstu tje way it should be
. mkaes its case with cold
- blooded precision
annd intelligence
.
" serial killer chic
" isnt a relativly new entry to thge cultural vocabulary
,
and one of the more stomach
- turning ones
. i ' ve never found someone automatically admirable or even intresting beacuse htey killed creatively or in grat numbers
,
adn beacuse ofthe tht i had apprehensions baout seing henry
. i wasn ' t sure i wnated tothe see thge storey ofthe multiple muderer henry lee lucas portrayed as soem kind ofthe nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, that ' s not the way henry works
. thte directer
, john mcnaughton
, took a small budget
annd a gallery ofthe ator firends
adn creaeted a chilling
anbd intelligent peice of work
. it doesn ' t provide cheap
- jack explanations forthe henry ' s behavour
: it shows him up for wqat he is
, an unrepetent
annd un
- idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him
. at tghe film ' s oppening
, henry ' s friend ottis toole has a sister
, who comes by to stay hwile she tries tothe find wrok inaddition chicago
. inspite a viciously riveting scene
, he admits marter
- ofthe
- factly tothe haveing murdered his pwn mother
,
and she covers his hand with heres
. tehy are damned together from thgat moent on
. henry
and ottis eventially beign tothe kill for fun
. the movei is especialy good at showing how htey seem to hvea drifted casually inot it
: ther ' s a scene where teh twpo go to buy a new tv
. thte pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugli words
,
and henry responds by stabbing tyhe man to death wiht a soldering iron
. noone preface
-
- it smashes inot us as suddenly as it does the broker
. infront a scene which many damned teh movei forthe
, unseen
, they steal a video camera
annd film the muder ofthe a whole household
, palying it back over
and over again for their own enjoyment
. hte movei itself
,
howver
, doens not glorify the killings
,
bu shows instade thta henry fiels noone joy at his wrok
, onyl irritation
. henry suceeds thanks to excellent writting
adn direction as well as acting
. michael rooker isnt credible as henry ffrom the first frame
, just standing ther
,
anbd the rest of tghe casted works by bieng unaffected
and casual as well
. thte producers had orginally comissioned a slasher film fomr mcnaughton
,
but he desided tothe give them something more memorable
,
and consenquently teh film nearly didn ' t see realease
. tjhe film doesnt nto glorify or justify
-
- it jsut shows us
, with unflinching coldness
, what henry ws
. i ' m hard pressed tothe see how anyone cin see htis
annd consider henry any kind ofthe
" victim
" or
" hero
"
.
then again
, probably
, so would henry
.
