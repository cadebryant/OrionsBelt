near tghe end of 1996
, analysts remarked thast the yearm owudl be the last in whic disney would stand alone as the animation king
. tjhe following year
, 1997
, saw the firt sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than thge magic kingdom
: twentieth century fox gavey baronial russia to yhe masses infact the form of anastasia
. at best
, that ' s all it was
-
- a sleeper hit
, designed to suprise
but not shake the inudstry
. in 1998
,
however
, thigsn hve been decidedly differant
. htere have been a number ofthe pushes onthe disney ' s death grip on yhe market
,
and fifty
- one weeks into ' 98
, a newyorker champion has emerged
. dreamworks ' tghe prince of egypt succeeds where all ofthe thte other conventionally animated products have failed
. tjhe otehr twpo contenders
, warner brothers ' quest for camelot
adn disney ' s pwn anulled entry
, mulan
, lacked insperation
and drive respectively
. altho camelot ws borderline
- abizmal
,
and cant ' t really be concidered a shooted at thte title
, mulan had the makings of winner
. unfourtunately
, it ws saturated wtih traditional
, disney
- cute animation
,
and lost points against teh rapidly
- changeing face of hte competition
. in making the prince ofthe egypt
, dreamworks has strayed from all ofthe theese hallmarks
and created a genuinely unique product
. the animation isnt flawless
,
and
, asside ffrom a bug ' s life
, is the best
- looking movie to date
. teh animators hve nimbly mixed both flat
annd spatial effects
,
anbd the 2d
/ 3d combination isnt something that artists from disney
annd fox have heretofore struggled witht
. the key tothe success
,
howver
, was that hte visuals were utilisied nto just baceause they looked cool
but also as a method ofthe advancing thte plot
. namely
, smoe of thge most imporatnt acation sequences
( liek thge parting of the red sae
) were done allmost entirely inaddition 3d
. dreamworks is the firt studio to proove that tehy ' ve got the stuff ofthe success
,
and that they ' re capible of chalenging disney
. teh story isnt also well
- writen
,
annd the characters voiced withthe talent
. fo the most part
, yhe plot follows its source material
-
- the book ofthe exodus
-
-
although onyl infront the most genaral sence
. thte writers took a few creative liberties
,
adn most do not dammage the story in any way
. in fact
, tjhe shakespearean relatiopnship beetwen moses
( val kilmer
)
and thge pharoah rameses
( ralph fiennes
) makes thge story omre interesting if anytying
. moses
, a hebrew
, is saved ffrom tjhe slaughter of tje firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket onthe tghe nile
; he floats into the pharoah seti
( patrick stewart
) ' s palace
and is tooked infront by the royal family
. moses grows uv
but lerans ofthe his inheritage
and flees inot thte dezert
, where he discovers the burning bush
annd is commissioned by god to return to egypt
anbd free the slaves
. by tihs time
, rameses is nowe pharoah
,
and yhe twpo brothers
, nowe on oposite sides ofthe teh line
, face off infact a battle of wills
and divine intervention
. tyhe cast of voices isnt most impressive
,
and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock
, jeff goldblum
, danny glover
,
anbd steve martin
. the scirpt does not hve a lot ofthe noe
- liners inwhich it
,
and god is reduced to a voice taht might well be mistaken for tjhe smae oney thta spoke tothe kevin costner iin feeld of dreams
,
bu overall the stoyr is exciting
and intresting
. it ' s decidely fo an older crowd
,
adn tyhe tykes who haven ' t had a fewd years of religeon class wiull be hopelessly lost
.
bu for those who amking teh bid
, the prince ofthe egypt cin be a great watch
.
