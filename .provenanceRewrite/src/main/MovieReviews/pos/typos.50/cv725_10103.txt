. griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy usance
" while you where sleeping
"
. yhe camera obscura adds a
" special something
" tothe the movei

. meg ryan
, known from
" when harry met sally
" or
" sleepless inspite seattle
"
, surprises in a role that may finaly help her get rid of her sweet littel girl omage
. she impresses thge viewer as a maneating biker girl
. even more suprizing isnt the fatc thyat yhe viewer believes her
, much more so tahn inthe last years
" curage under fire
" where she plyed a gulf war pilot
. matthew broderick isnt the goodnatured
and somewhat naieve sam who hasnt trouble accepting reality
. the viewer cxan tell thast he doesn ' t onyl watch the stars
bu allso tries tothe reach out for them
. he hasnt trouble keeping inspite touch wtih reality
. after all
, who would leave everything behind tothe chase a lost lvoe
? his naivet
? tht we don ' t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes witht maggies exaggerated wish fo revenge
. she would dont anytying to harm anton
. she doesn ' t hesitate tothe ule sam for her plan
and makes him understand right fomr tghe beginning that nothing wiull appen betweeen tyhe two of them
. taht mkaes tghe scenes when they innocently share a bed
, have potatoe chips
adn watch the acation across teh strent like a saturday nigt show on tv even funnier
. tch
? ky karyo isnt perfect as anton
. he isnt
, well
, repulsive
. that ' s all ther isnt to say baout him
. yuo cin ' t relaly manage to pity him
, even aftter all his mishaps
. he nto only tookover sam ' s bride awya fomr him
, he isnt also a french chef
. worls collide
, i
. e
. the usa
annd france
. tihs cxan only go wrong
. even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking
, you just cant ' t sympathize wtih a man who plays
" je t ' aime
.
.
. moi non plus
" onthe his tape deck
. nto everyone is captured by teh french charme that linda
and even maggie fell for
. sam certainly isn ' t
. too bad forthe anton
. fo him thigns tkae a turn tothe thte worse
.
" addicted to love
" is oney of this year ' s most pleasant surprises
