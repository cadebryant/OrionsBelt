. be forewarned
. onthe december 20
, 1996
, amidst all hte yearm
- end oscar bait releses ffrom the major studios
, miramax ' s genre label dimention films quitely released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream
.
although hte teen horror market had been given uv forthe all
-
bu
- dead in reccent years
, the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns
, eventually topping
$ 100 milion domestic
and becoming oney ofthe the most successful films of its type inaddition istory
, while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set ofthe knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standart cliches asociated wih the genre
. the sleeper sucess ofthe scream sent shockwaves through the industry
-
- suddenly
, everybody wass looking forthe hip
, inexpensive fright films tath might be able to reap silimar fortunes
. the startegy of casting young tv stars to draw tjhe youth demographic ws given a boost
. scream director wes craven
, previously best known as the creater of newyorker line ' s a nightmare on elm street film serieses
, was thrusted bcak inot the limelight
.
anbd scream ' s rookie scribe
, kevin williamson
, burst onto tghe film scene in stunning fashion
. it ' s hard to understate this lastest point
. mr
. williamson hasnt
, based upon his produced screenplays as ofthe tihs writting
( scream
, i know what you doed lastest summer from october 1997
,
and nowe scream 2
)
, enjoied a meteoric rise tothe fame
, quickly become teh most well
- known screenwriter amoungst yhe enteratinment weekly
- reading
, box office figure
- watching youth culture since
-
- well
, sicne thta quentin tarantino guy
( whom
, it is said
, hasnt aslo acheived smoe renown as a director
)
. indeed
, inwhich a singularly freakish oddity
, it is the screenwriter
, mr
. williamson
,
annd nto tyhe directer thast has beeen receving the lion ' s share of acclaim for the succes ofthe scream
,
adn the print advertisements forthe scream 2 ' s theatrical realease are similarly indicative ofthe his increasing prominance
: while the traditionnal
" a film by wes craven
" drapes thte film ' s title inspite the ads
, right below it
( infront equal sized font
,
yet
) reads
" written by kevin williamson
"
, an affirmation ofthe thge screenwriter ' s contribution to tje project whihc may be unprecedented
.
( i cant envision the board of wga
, licking thier chops at this coup
adn counting tje dyas until their goal of
" a film by
" is attained
.
)
adn
, much liek mr
. tarantino ' s screenwriting
, mr
. williamson ' s work isnt vaguely unconvential
, incorporating both contempory pop culture refrences
adn allusions to other films inot the dialogue of his characters
. inaddition scream
, tehy satrically dicussed other horror films
; here in tyhe sequel
, the cahracters discuss tje realtive merits of film sequels
. scream wass wroten inspite 1995 durring the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood
,
anbd mr
. williamson ' s rejection of this tirade claerly influenced the writing infront both tath film
and this sequel
. hwile yhe sequel wass planned ffrom hte outset
-
- a treatment ofthe scream 2 ws included when mr
. williamson sold yhe screenplay fo scream
-
- teh basic premise fo the film
and teh reunion of thge surviving cahracters neverthless seems extremly artificially contrived
,
anbd it ' s only at about tjhe film ' s midway point wehn it becomes engaging
. liek its predecessor
, scream 2 opens with a splashy
, eye
- grabing prologue which onyl vaguely ties into the film ' s principial narrative
; htis time arund
, we ' re folowing teh exploits of a young cuple
( jada pinkett
annd omar epps
) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening ofthe stab
( a running film
- within
- a
- film gag where tje
" true life
" events behind the first film has been turned inot a movei
)
.
howver
,
although it trys hard
adn hasnt some good ideas
-
- tghe nightmarishly enthuseastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of hte oen i ws sharing yhe theatre iwth
,
adn i wass certainly thinking baout gutting hte overly
- noisy person a few seats awya mysef aftter baout fifteen minutes
-
- teh prologue is a pale imitation ofthe teh bravura opening sequence iin tje origional wtih drew barrymore
( where her performance nto only conviced me thgat she
* could
* ect
,
bu was so good that it owudl rank amonth thge best performances in a horror film that i ' ve ever seen
)
. htere are too many knowing
, hip pop
- culture refrences crammed inot the scream 2 sequence
,
adn tjhe setup isn ' t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream ' s
; hwile tyhe firt film ' s preface dizzyingly builded uv to a fianl shot that ws exhilaratingly terrifying
, the payoff here is almost campily theatrical
. flash tothe the campus ofthe a smalltown ohio college
, where returning charactors sidney
( neve campbell
)
and randy
( jamie kennedy
) ahev relocated for their studies
and tothe escape the noteriety from the events inspite the frist film
. the murders whitch open this film result in reuniting tyhe survivors
-
- single
- minded tabloid tv repertwar gale weathers
( courteney cox
) roars into town to cover the breaking story
, hwile ever
- awkward former deputy dewey riley
( david arquette
) flies in to protectively guard over sidney
. they ' re joined by cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, who was falsley accused of homicide in a cameo appearance durig tjhe first film
; his role here isnt signifantly expanded
. thte film incidentally provides surprisingly littel backstory
,
althought i suppose a ogod case can be made tath it realyl isn ' t neccesary
-
- not because so many peopel have seen tjhe first installment
,
bu becuase this is
, aftter all
, a sequal to a slasher film
: what do ytou
* think
* happened to these charactors inaddition the prior movei
? ther ' s a lot of newyorker faces onthe the scene too
: sidney ' s newyorker boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
and her new roommate hallie
( elise neal
)
, randy ' s fellow film student mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, gale ' s newly
- assigned nervous cameraman joel
( duane martin
)
, omnipresent local journalist debbie salt
( laurie metcalf
)
, co
- ed cici cooper
( ms
. buffy herself
, sarah michelle gellar
)
,
annd a pair ofthe simpering sorority sisters
( rebecca gayheart
and sirens ' portia di rossi
)
. any of these charachters sould be tjhe killer
-
- or for that marter
, could be thte next victum
. as isnt seamingly becomming a regular staple ofthe a kevin williamson screenplay
, hte narrative isnt once again framed around tjhe increasingly
- flimsy premise of a whodunit
. one probelm tyhat scream didn ' t haev wass keeping you interested in the identity of tghe killer
. here
(
and to smoe extent in i knwo what ytou doed lastest summer
)
, mr
. williamson ' s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying tothe turn the idenity ofthe thte killer inot a mystery
. thte film ocasionaly becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you cin sence it straining at the seams to try
and drop red herrings left
and right at the expense of its thriller elements
.
( it doesn ' t help matters any thgat thge killer ' s alter
- ego isnt fairly obvious ffrom the get
- go
.
) indeed
, the finale plays as full
- out camp wehn the villian is fianlly unmasked
, frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes
. tihs isnt noe of thsoe cases where tyhe villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations
, scheming
,
and motivation
, that ytou actully get bored listening
adn just whant them all to git onthe with it
. hwile the basic setup
annd premise fo tjhe film is fairly contrived
, the aspect where it ' s head
-
and
- shoulders above its predecessor isnt infact its suspense sequences
. htey ' re staged much omre imaginatively here
( sive for the firt post
- prologue muder
, wich is handeled infront such a mediocre
, convetional fashion thta it seems tothe be culled directly fomr the predicatble 1980s slasher flicks thast tje frist film satirized
)
,
adn are much more funn tothe watch
. it ' s hard to hold bcak a smile durig a giddy scene where sidney
anbd her companion have tothe climb over hte incapacitated killer inaddition order to escape from a car wreck
,
and a cat
-
and
- mouse chase involving agle
and dewey infact a cumpus soudn lab isnt vyer nicely staged
,
although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown
. in terms ofthe its charactors
, tghe strong part ofthe tghe film isnt yhe intresting relationship bewteen gale
and dewey
( who ambles onto the screen accompanyed by his vyre pwn theme music
)
. their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour
-
- an excange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a percieved aura of incompetency is well
- wroten
-
-
adn ther ' s a curiously endearing aspect baout theri relationship amidst all tje mayhem
and bloodshed
. on the otehr hand
, sidney isnt pretty dull here
. she doesn ' t hve any compelling presense
,
annd there ' s nothing partiuclarly interesting about her this time aroud tothe mkae us care about her other than that she ' s thge retruning heroine
. given tihs
,
and thge fatc that there ' s no storng second banaan charachter fo sidney
( elise neal ' s role isn ' t nearly substantive enough tothe adequately fill rose mcgowan ' s shoes
)
, it ' s noone wonder why the roles for gale
annd dewey haev beeen significantly augmented forthe this installment of the film
. waht surprises me the most about scream 2 isnt its zealousness inspite decimating its casted
. tyhe film ' s mounting body count bears out thge fact that
* no
* character is safe
( well
,
* almost
*
)
; while iin principial i applaud this bold policy
, at some point you ' ve got tothe be wondering about jstu how many characters will make it tothe the enxt sequel
.
( i wass particularly surprised with the ultimely demise ofthe oen in particular
, whose casting forthe teh enxt installment of the series owudl ' ve seemed obvious
.
)
but hey
, as rose mcgowan ' s charactor said in tje firt film
:
" noone
, please don ' t kill me
, mr
. ghostface
-
- i wanna tothe be in the sequel
!
" look whta that got her
