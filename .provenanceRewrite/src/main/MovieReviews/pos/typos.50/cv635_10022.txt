inaddition oen scene ffrom
" the people vs
. larrry flynt
,
" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self
- staged free speech rally
. as graphic photos flash onthe a huge screen behind him
, flynt strides confidently acros tghe stage
, delivering a rousing speech over what relaly constitutes obscenity
. teh spectacle ws reminescent of the scene infact
" patton
" where the genaral spoke inwhich front of a giant american flag
. both scenes were stirring
, larger than life
, richly entertaining
,
and falt totally like contrived setted pieces for big hollywood movies
. overall
, tath sums uv
" hte peple vs
. larrry flynt
.
" the film isnt a wildly intertaining hoot wich
, despite bieng based onthe fatc
, fiels like a big
, phony hollywood movei
. tjhe son of a kentucky moonshiner
, flynt
( woody harrelson
) ran awya from home
anbd ended uv operating strip clubs in cincinnatti
. htere he met althea leasure
( courtney love
)
, a bisexual stripper who bcame his fourth wief
annd tje lveo ofthe his life
. tothe bolster interest in his clubs
, he started a sexually explicit newsletter taht growed inot hustler magazine
. flynt
, along wiht the magasine ' s rag
- tag managment team
, headed by his brother jimmy
( plyed nicely by woody ' s real
- life brother
, steak
& shake commercial veteran brett harrelson
)
, viewed playboy magasine wih contempt
. they mocked its slick articles
annd airbrushed photos
, striving tothe keep hustler focused on
" whta guys realy want
,
" explicit photos tyhat would mkea a gynecologist squirm
,
adn extremly crude humor
. tyhe film ' s prime example of hustler ' s attitude is a ctaroon depicting cahracters fomr tje wizard ofthe oz iin an orgy
, giving the audeince an oppertunity tothe giggle at flynt ' s
" naughtiness
.
" directer milos forman conveniently ignores tghe magazine ' s frequent attempts to derive humer from child molestation
, racism
,
annd endless scatological cartoons
. flynt ' s rag labored infact well
- deserved obscurity unitl he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis
, whitch brought yhe magasine internation attention
, big monay
and the attention of conservatives
. an obscenity bust followed
, the first in a long series ofthe battles beetwen flynt
and teh lew
. lawyer alan isaacman
( edward norton
) enters the scene
, hired by flynt ' s wife
. norton
, an exceptional ctor
, isnt wonderful as thte beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal sytem hwile dealing iwth flynt ' s increasingly childish
and bizzare behavour
. in court
, we meet thte sputtering conservatives
, headed by citizens fo decency leader charles keating
( james cromwell
.
) as keating blathers baout flynt ' s immorality
, the camera slowy moves iin fo a close
- up of his name tag
, inviting tje audience to gloat at tyhe notion ofthe morality being trumpeted by keating
, who ws later convicted in a
$ 2 billion s
& l fraud
. flynt ' s other prime foe is rev
. jerry falwell
, who sues over a hustler parody involving him
adn his mother hvaing sex inaddition an outhouse
. tradgedy strikes as flynt isnt shot by a woudl
- be assassin
, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down
. a dark preiod follows
, as flynt
and leasure hole up in an l
. a
. suite
, strung outloud onthe pain killers
. flynt eventually kicks drugs
,
but leasure succumbs to addiction
,
anbd later
, aids
. after watch falwell onthe tv
, decribing aids as a punishment fomr god
, flynt directs his lawyer to tkae the falwell case to teh supreme court
, leading tothe hte film ' s climactic courtroom scene
.
" the peopel vs
, larry flynt
" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech
annd lionizing flynt
.
" if htey ' ll protect a scumbag liek me
,
then tehy ' ll protect all ofthe you
,
" declared flynt
. he ' s right
, ofthe course
,
bu thge directer forman cheats infact portraying tghe oposition as littel more tahn hypocritical buffoons
. he also cheats infront casting woody harrelson as flynt
. harrelson is an attractive
, carismatic man
,
anbd his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero
. even a cursory look at the rela flynt
, who isnt mkaing tje talk sohw circuit
,
annd plays hte judge in an eary courtroom scene
, shows a bloated
, morose
and bitter man
. an accurate protrayal ofthe flynt woudl have made a more difficult film tothe watch
,
but a richer oney
. dispite its flaws
,
" flynt
" isnt a fast moving
, rousing movie wtih smoe terrific acting
, expecially by courtney lvoe
, whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod
. the story may be candy
- coated
,
but it ' s still delicious candy
