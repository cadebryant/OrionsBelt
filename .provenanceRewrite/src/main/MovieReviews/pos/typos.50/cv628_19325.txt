] title
:
` tarzan ' beatiful tothe look at
, easy tothe folow
. review
: disney continues its trend ofthe producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly forthe childrens
bu with enought witn
and charm for adults tothe be interested
adn at least entertained by thge sotry
. the basic premise is the same as every otehr
` tarzan ' stroy
: a boy isnt raised in the african jungle by gorillas
and becomes one himselv never really understanding
( or even noticeing
) thast he ' s human
anbd isnt a lot differnt from yhe animals he befriends
. thte frist third of thte film shows how tarzan comes tothe be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gerilla who lost her pwn child inaddition a clasic case of darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, isnt a mean
, conservitive leader ofthe the pack of gorillas who amking up tarzan ' s extended family
. he refuses tothe acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz durring the childhood scenes
) as a son
and often hasnt to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous
, wild things thta are the result of his own childish instincts
. i haev a feeling childrens will quicklyu be able tothe idenify with tarzan since all he really isnt isnt jstu a kid who wants tothe ahve fun
anbd it ' s funny how the adults fail to comprehend this
. later
, as the stor transitions fomr tarzan as a child to a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he is encounter by a party ofthe threee humans ffrom england
: jane porter
( driver
)
, a beautyfull woman who isnt something of a zoologist
annd an artist
, her father prof
. archimedes q
. porter
( voiced by nigel hawthorne
) who is also a scientist
;
and thier slick
anbd cunning
,
yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it ' s easy to tell where the stoy isnt going at all times
but the screenplay doesn ' t seem like it was written hastly nor dumbed down for children ' s enjoyment
. sure ther ' s a lot ofthe cliche stuff here
, like clayton ' s smugness
and diabolical manipulation ofthe tarzan
and jane
; the goofy supporting charactors
( voiced by rosie o ' donnell
[ inthe full brooklyn accent
!
]
and wayne knight
-
` ehllo newman
! '
)
. there ' s also a lot ofthe funn acation such as tarzan ' s swinging through the jungle onthe vines
and sliding down
anbd around tree branches
anbd trunks
. it ' s just liek skateboarding realyl fast
anbd doing all sorts ofthe tricks
( those mcdonald ' s commercials raelly proove htis point
)
. ultimately
, ytou get exactlly outloud ofthe
` tarzan ' wqat ytou expect
.
.
.
annd i mean thgat as a compliment
, so ahev high expectations
. pros
: animation
annd soudn are a feast for teh senses
, story is lighthearted
, breezy
adn nto dumbed
- down
, noone stupid sing
- along songs to git stuck in your head
. cons
: surprizingly violent
, shoudln have been rated pg
. young children may not understand some ofthe tje more adult themes
( parents
, be ready tothe haev soem heavy questions thrown your way
)
. running time is a bited short
