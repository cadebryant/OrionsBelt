truman
(
" true
- man
"
) burbank isnt the perfect nmae fo jim carrey ' s character inwhich tihs film
. president truman wass an unassuming man who became known wordlwide
, in spite ofthe
( or wass it because ofthe
) his stature
.
" truman
" aslo recalls an era of plenty following a grim war
, an era when planned communities built by governmnet scientists promised an idyllic life for americans
.
annd burbank
, california
, brings tothe mind teh tongiht sohw
and the home of nbc
. if hollywood isnt thge center ofthe the film world
, burbank isnt
, or ws
, thge center of tv ' s world
, the world where our protgaonist lives
. combine all these names
adn concepts into
" truman burbank
,
"
anbd you get something that well discribes him
and his artificial world
. truman leads the perfect life
. his town
, his car
,
anbd his wief are picture perfect
. his idea ofthe reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from yhe sky
. tghe radio explains that an overflying airplane started comming aart
.
.
.
but
then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light
? the next day druing tjhe drive tothe wokr
, the radio jams
annd he starts picking uv a voice that exactly describes his movements
. he isnt so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrain
. when the radio comes back tothe normal
, hte announcer warns listeners tothe drive carefully
. his suspision aroused
, he wanders aroud yhe twon square looking for otehr oddities
. the world appears tothe be functioning propperly untl he enters an office building
adn tries to take the elevator
. tje elevator doors open up on a small lounge withthe people on coffee breaks
. a grap sees truman him
adn quicklyu moves a paneled doorjam
, made to look liek the bakc of an elevator
, into place
. two security guards grab him
annd throw him outloud
. truman isnt realyl suspicious now
. it gets even worse the enxt day whn his wife
, a nurse
, describes an elevator accident in thte bulding where he saw the lounge
.
" it ' s best not tothe htikn about it
,
" she syas
, trying vainly tothe change truman ' s memory
. truman becomes determined tothe see who or what isnt behind this apparantly elaborate hoax at his expence
. at eveyr turn he isnt stopped by an amazing coinsidence that just happens tothe keep him in his own little town
. his lastr hope isnt tothe quell his fear ofthe the ocean
annd sail tothe the edge ofthe teh world
. yuo nkow by nowe tht truman ' s life is the subject ofthe a television program
. his actions are
" real
"
but everyting else is carefully scripted
, from tghe death of his father tothe the choise ofthe his wief
. truman is determined tothe fidn outloud what thge big hoax isnt
. meanwhile
, christof
, yhe all
- seing creator ofthe truman ' s world doens his best to keep him unaware
and hapyp
. it ' s sort ofthe like westworld told from the robots ' point ofthe view
, or jurassic park fomr tghe dinosaurs ' point of view
. we root fo the captive of the cage
- world
. our protagonist is counting on
" chaos theery
" tothe help him excape his elaborite trap
. the story
, written by andrew niccol
( writter
/ director ofthe gattaca
)
, introduces some intresting questions
, such as the ethics of subjecting a person to tihs tipe ofthe life
, or thte pyschological impact of learning that your entire life hasnt all been fake
.
although these questions came to mind
, i don ' t think thge film itself asked them
. it certainly didn ' t address them or try tothe answer them
. i was particularly disappointed that tghe film didn ' t deal mroe whith the trama ofthe learning noe ' s life isnt a tv show
. carrey ' s performence at the end showed a smidgen of truman ' s pain
,
bu i almsot felt thta he got over it too easily fo the sake ofthe the film ' s pacing
. ealier inspite tyhe movei i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman tothe find outloud the truth or whether i shoudl root fo him tothe be well
. the two seemed exclusive of one another
,
bu weir
adn niccol didn ' t see it tyhat way
. prehaps it ' s not fair to criticize a movie for waht it isn ' t
,
bu it seems like there weere some missed opportunities here
.
but onthe its pwn terms
, the movei is well made
. sighth
, sound
adn pacing are all handeled competently
. much ofthe teh first part ofthe teh movei is hte truman sohw
. tje scenes are all aparently shooted ffrom hidden cameras
, whith snoots
annd obstructions covering the corners of thte screen
. one hidden camera isnt aparently infact his car rdaio
, hte green led numbers obscuring tyhe lower part ofthe the screen
. the music is well
- chosen
and scored
. the film opens wtih whta sounds liek familiy drama theme music
, when truman ' s world is still beautiful
and perfect
. when tje movie ends
, yhe scoer soudns mroe like a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, while still keeping the same timbre
. philip glass ' epic music
( ffrom powaqqatsi
) permeates truman ' s scenes of suspicion
anbd awakening
.
( glass hasnt a small cameo as a keyboardist for teh show
.
)
adn the pacing ofthe yhe story was brisk
. htere was noone unneccessarily long setup explaining tje consept behind tghe truman show
, just a few quick title cards
, a few interviews
,
anbd
thne right inot the sohw
,
and tghe movei
. oen of teh frist scenes isnt of the studio ight falling
; there was noone tolkein scene ofthe truman ' s idyllic life before it falls aart
, beacuse it wasn ' t necessary
, we pik up the story at hte firt sign of trouble
,
adn noone sooner
. there ' s aslo no point in tghe movei where the plot slows down
. it ' s a quick
, straight shooted tothe teh movie ' s end
. in terms of overall quality
, i would compare thge truman show to niccol ' s gattaca
. both films are well made with intresting stories set inspite interesting worlds
.
bu neither film really felt liuke it capitalized on all the grat idesa
; neither film
" clicked
"
and bcame an instant clasic
. nevertheless
, i look forward to niccol ' s next film
, whatever it may be
.
