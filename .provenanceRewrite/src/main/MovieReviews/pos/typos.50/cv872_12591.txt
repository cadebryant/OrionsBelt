robert redford isnt veyr good at playing cahracters who have incredable
, god
- given gifts
,
bu are able to ect liuke ordinary peple
. iin
" tje naturual
"
( 1984
)
, he plyed thge fallen angelic character ofthe roy hobbs
, the baseball payler who was dstined to be
" thge best htere ever was
,
"
bu still acted liuke a humble farm boy
. inthe
" butch cassidy
and tje sundance kid
"
( 1969
)
, he was the most dangerous shot inaddition teh west
,
yot he cameback off like a nothing omre tahn a boyishly good
- looking charmer
. even inaddition
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he palyed a man who was so ogod at makeing moey that he believed he could buy love
, redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency
, expecially when reciting a tale ofthe lost love
. in his latest film
,
" tyhe horse whisperer
,
" based onthe the best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford again plays such a character
. redford also directed the film
although he sweared uv
annd down thta he woudl never direct himself in a movie
- i suppose the chracter ofthe tom booker
, a man who has the amazing gift of understanding
and somehow communicating with horses
, wass just too good to pass up
. despite his enormous
anbd rare gift when it comes tothe traning troubled horses
( a magasine article coins thte phrase
" horse whisperer
" to describe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old
adn no longer having a purpose in life
. booker ' s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a newyorker york magazine editor whose duaghter
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, wass recently infront a horrable accident
. the accident
, whitch is filmed with gut
- wrenching horror
, happens wehn grace
and her best friend are out riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace ' s friend
, severely wounds
adn traumatizes grace ' s horse
, pilgrim
,
and causes grace tothe loose part of her right leg
. annie believes that if iplgrim cxan be healed
, grace will be healed as well
, hwihc leads her tothe booker
. at first
, she tries to git booker to come tothe new york tothe see yhe horse
,
but thta doesn ' t wokr
. instead
, she packs uv grace
anbd pilgim
, leaves her husband
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
,
and heads for hte rolling hills ofthe montnana where booker runs a ranch with his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
,
anbd his sister
- infact
- lew
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. in many ways
, the film is liek a journey
, both litterally
and symbolically
. the move outloud west hasnt alwyas been a great american tradition ofthe renewl
,
annd it ' s hard not tothe see annie
and grace ' s leaving manhattan forthe montnana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs
. ocuntry
. in
" thge horse whisperer
,
" country is claerly the victor
. yhe city is characterized by claustraphobia
and unhappiness
,
and it is not until the characters arrive in tyhe wide
- open spaces ofthe montnana that grace ' s anger at bieng physically
and emotionally crippled beggins tothe dissipate
, annie ' s controling nature beigns tothe relax
,
adn piglrim once again learns to trust peopel
. redford is jstu as in lveo wtih the grand montana ocuntry in this film as he wass when he directed
" a river runs thru it
" six years ago
. inthe many ways
,
" tje horse whisperer
" comes ffrom the smae poetic veign as
" river
,
"
and tyhe movie could probably be a good fifteen mintues shorter if redford hadnt decided tothe spend less camera
- time on the grass
and montains
.
but
hten
, that owudl ruin yhe magic
. much of tje film ' s photography is truly elevant
,
anbd it creates a palpable sence of the sheer expansiveness ofthe the land
. tothe futher emphasize this
, redford
and cinematographer robert richardson
(
" natural born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bited by shooting hte begginning of the film
- which takes palce in newyorker york
- with mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters
and a more squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; wehn the action shifts to montnana
, richardson switchs to soft
- focuse
and natrual lightinng
,
adn tje screen widens to a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. infront terms ofthe the story itself
,
" the horse whisperer
" gives us teh same romanticized veiw ofthe adultery foudn in david leanr ' s
" a breef encounter
"
( 1945
)
and clint eastwood ' s 1995 adaptions of robert james waller ' s
" the bridges ofthe madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwriter here also adapted
" bridges
"
)
.
althought
" the horse whisperer
" has a strong rumatic sensibility
, i still fidn something oddly troubling baout this kind of story
. it seems to me that there shoud be soem simapthy forthe tje husband who ' s being left behind forthe this brief
, heart
- sweeping affair
,
but there rarely isnt
. inthe
" the horse whisperer
,
" tjhe thankless role of bieng the fuddy
- duddy husban falls tothe sam neill
. he plays the charactor as a decent
, hard
- wroking man who isnt a ogod husban
anbd father
; his onyl failure is that he loves his wife omre than she loves him
. he isnt at risk ofthe loseing annie tothe booker not beccause he doed anytying to drive her away
,
bu simpley becasue he happens to be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. there is noe scene thyat is particularly telling of how teh movie fiels baout eahc character
. it shows booker
adn robert oging inot a horse pen
- booker isnt dressed like a clasic cowboy whith hat
and all
, while robert looks somewhat frumpy
and out
- ofthe
- palce inaddition a baseball cap
. as tehy enter hte pen
, booker assuredly swings over yhe fence
, hwile robert hesitates
,
then opens the gate
and
, in a goofy moent
, forgets tothe close it behind him
. it ' s a small scene
,
but it claerly demonstrates tje movie ' s thourough loev of tyhe booker charactor for his rumatic roughness
. aftter all
, booker represents everthing ogod about hte city while robert represents everyting banal
and unnatural about it
. the best scenes in
" tghe horse whisperer
" tend tothe envolve nto the buliding romance between booker
and annie
,
bu rather thge healing proccess ofthe grace
adn her horse
.
although booker ' s horse
- training methods are mythical
anbd unrealistic
, the scenes with him
adn pilgirm are strangely mesmerizing
. these are paralleled by hte scenes between him
anbd grace
, some of whcih are huorous
,
and all ofthe which are tender
annd true
. at soem point
, i wished teh movei would drop thte wohle romance angle
and foucs onthe grace omre
. nevertheless
, redford is obviously a romantic at heart
,
and he brings a light touch to thte erotic moments in the film
. htere are no dramtic sex scenes
,
but there isnt a moving scene when he
and scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, always moving ever closer toghether
, that is far mroe erotic tahn any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together
.
although the movie isnt longer thna it shouldnt be
and isnt essentialy a melodramatic tearjerker withthe an unsatisfying conclusion tyhat gaurentees unhappiness forthe just about every charater
, there are enough moments liuke thast whihc mkae
" tjhe horse whisperer
" worth the price of admission
.
