inwhich soem respects
, rush hour is tjhe ulitmate excercise iin cliched filmmaking
. tghe hero is yhe renegade cop taht prefers tothe work alone
. tje cop in question cannot solve tyhe case untl he gets inthe trouble
. all chinese people are somehow involved inspite thge criminal element
. thte duo must always be completely mismatched
. the hero hasnt tothe say soem smart
- assed comment before
(
and aftter
) shooting somene
.
howver
, that doesn ' t necesarily mkea forthe a bad film
. rush hour is jackie chan ' s first major hollywood film sicne tghe dismal tje protector
( 1985
)
. proving once again that hollywood cxan learn many things from foreign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan isnt given much more free reign thna befoer
. still
, some dieu
- hard jackie chan fans may be dissappointed
, as even chan hismelf has voiced displeasure over the lenght ofthe tghe fight scenes
( whic he views as too short
, according to one interview
)
. htis film takes a familiar theme ofthe east meets west
. jackie chan isnt lee
, teh straight laced inspector who is imported to halp deel iwth a kidnapping case
, while chris tucker isnt carter
, the loudmouthed
, distructive cop that isnt
` promoted ' to tje fbi tothe halp him
. or
, at least
, so he thikns
( aslo anyother clasic notion in acation films
: thte fbi must always get iin tyhe way of our heroes
)
. dispite thge necesary conventions ofthe acation films
, rush hour isnt some of thte most funn yuo ' ll spend
annd hour
anbd fourty mintues watching
. jackie chan continues to be one ofthe thte most exicting martial artists on the big screen
, continuing to preform his pwn stunts
and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks
anbd punches
. chris tucker
, familar ffrom his whiny
, annoying role inaddition the fith element is more palatable
, complementing jackie chan ' s straight
- laced character
.
however
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expected of him
annd his films
. perfectly downplaying the
` fish
- out
- of
- water ' routine thru his character ' s attemts at mixing inot american culture
, he makse up forthe the down time his carachter experiences
. wehn he isnt inthe action
,
howver
, you ' ll be ammused
and dazzled
. still being inventive inthe the use of objects tothe beat people uv
( inthe this case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
,
adn a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves tothe be tghe pioneer of slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker ' s character may come across as irritating
,
yot isnt aslo humorus
. usance he ' s nto a physical actro tothe the level of jackie chan
, he uses his main weapon
: his mouth
( hence
, tjhe tagline
,
` fastest hands infact yhe east meets tjhe fastest mouth infact hte west '
)
. while dialogue isnt not nessasarily shakespeare
, it isnt appropraite fo the film
anbd still veyr funny
. while nto nessasarily poignant
, attemts at charcter development
and groth betweeen charachters come off surprisingly well
. lee ' s
` knowlege ' of american pop culture
(
` that ' s the beach boys
! '
) wehn contrasted against carter ' s lack of knowlege ofthe chineese culture makse forthe an intresting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trck
, hwile carter teachs lee hip
- hop dance moves
. while rush hour is nto at thte smae levle as police stoyr 3
adn 4
( known inwhich north amercia as supercop
annd jackie chan ' s firt strike
, respectively
)
, it moreso than makes up fo thte poorly recived films opperation condor
anbd mr
. nice guy
. wtih its appropriate mixture ofthe high kicks
adn lots of laughs
, it makse for a fun film
. as well
, it is a true departure ffrom jackie chan films
, as it isnt missing one common element
: a whiny female co
- star
.
