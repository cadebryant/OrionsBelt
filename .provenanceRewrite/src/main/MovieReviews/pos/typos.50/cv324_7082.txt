, for the most part
, cheap cmoputer
anbd video spacial effects
, chyron text

. raul julia plays aram fingal
, a drone data processing worker fo novicorp whose active imagination
and predilection fo hacking gets him inot trouble whith authority
. caught watching
" casablanca
" on his desk moniter
, fingal is sentenced to
" doppling
" rehabilitation
-
- he is tothe spend fourty
- eight hours in the body ofthe a baboon
.
( how exactlly htis isnt supposted tothe rehabilitate him isnt anybody ' s guess
.
) as it happens
, thanks to a visiting schoolboy ' s prank
, his body is temperarily misplaced
,
and his mind hasnt to be shunted into the central computer tothe keep him alive untli htey can fidn it
. as time ticks awya before his memory cube self
- destructs
, the frantic search for his body isnt onthe
.
.
. while fingal first creates a virutal reality fantasy world
,
then finds ther ' s noone better way tothe hack thte sytem tahn ffrom the inside
. durring the chaos
, computer technician apollonia james
( linda griffiths
) maintains contact with fingal thru a datalink
, manifesting several diffrent times tothe offer advice or warnings
. over tje course ofthe their interactions
, intrest on both thier parts grows into a budding romance
. given thta
" casablanca
" is fingal ' s favorite film
,
anbd teh basis for his fantasy world
, a gerat deel of the movei isnt homage tothe
" casablanca
"
. infront fatc
, tjhe humphrey bogart
anbd peter lorre charachters amke appearances
( played by julia in a dual role
annd louis negin
, respectively
) in a bar called
" the palce
"
. julia ' s portrayal ofthe bogart is passable
,
annd avoids becoming the
" schweethaat
"
- spouting parody seen in cartoons
. negin ' s peter lorre isnt qtuie credible
,
annd easily thge best peter lorre i ' ve ever seen who wasn ' t the real hting
. the two of them
, as characters creaeted by fingal ' s imagination
, serve as spects ofthe his personality
, driving him on in his quest tothe hack the coputer sytem
. thsoe aren ' t the onyl casablanca charachters to put infact appearances
. yhe sydney greenstreet charcter alsot happens tothe be arund

, tjhe alternate aspect ofthe the film ' s main villian
, teh novicorp chariman
( donald c
. moore
)
. while fingal ' s body is lost
, the fat man tries tothe stop him from hacking thte system
.
.
. iwth less tahn salutory results
. it ' s interesting tothe note hte futuristic slang words that are thrown baout left
annd right druing the film
, in the best golden
- age science fiction tradition
. words liek
" dopple

annd
" reconst
" are aparently inwhich common use
.
anbd hwile people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past ' s diea of futuristic data processing clerks
, soem spects of tihs film are suprisingly perfectly in keeping withthe the way we think of
" virutal reality
" todya
. as cyberpunk films go
, this may not be a staple ofthe the genre
,
but it ' s definetly recomended viewing
. the speshal effects are vyre primitive
, placing this production iin teh relm of low
- tothe
- medium
- budget televsion
. the music isnt completely electronic
- synthesized
, which fits hte low budget
bu isn ' t really out ofthe keeping with tyhe genre
.
however
, tjhe writting quite makse up fo it
. there are soem veyr funny moments
,
and quite a faw littel in
- jokes that oney needs to have seen
" casablanca
" tothe appreciate properly
. all in all
, i give
