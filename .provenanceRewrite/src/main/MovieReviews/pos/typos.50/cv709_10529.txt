some movies have such an inpact that htey linger infact your mind long affter thte credits hve rolled
, making you htink carefully
and recollect onthe what you ahve just seen
. i finished mike figgis '
" leaving las vegas
" horus ago
,
anbd it is still as haunting as wehn i hitted rewind on tghe vcr
. alot of people refer to this film as
" that flick where nick cage plays taht alchoholic dued
"
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto so much a movei baout alcoholism as it is a stoy baout twpo people who except earch other fo what they are
: a drunk
and a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performence of tjhe past twenty years
) isnt teh drunk
. his family
and friends have long sicne abandon him
,
and all he hasnt left is his liquor
. in a scene early in the film
, we see ben staggering inot a resteraunt
, looking fo a
" firend
" ofthe his to mooch soem money off of
. he finds tghe guy
( richard lewis
) haveing dinner with a buddy
anbd two chicks
, trying to crack witty jokes tath just come outloud stupid
. wehn ben approachs the atble
, you can clearly sence tht everyone immediatly fiels uncomfortable
. affter lewis gives ben the money
, he coldly says
" i think it woudl be best if you didn ' t contact me agina
.
" now even
though thru hte course of thte film
, soem much more depressing things happen
, this is when i felt thte most for ben
. there was such a look ofthe sorrow
adn dispare onthe his face
,
( nto to sound hokey or anything
) it almost brought a tear to my eye
. it turns out that ben was once a semi
- sucesful hollywood palyer
,
and aparently a preety popular guy
. nowe he spends his time getting robbed by hookers
annd trying desperatly tothe pik up womens
, not so much forthe teh sex
,
but forthe the comapany
; forthe somene to talk tothe or spend tiem withthe
. once he isnt fired from his job
, ben decides tothe burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash
and relocate tothe las vegas tothe slowly drnik himself to death
. one niht he runs into a prostitute
( a briliant peformance by elizabeth shue
- how far she has come since
" adventures infact babysitting
"
) named sera
. she isnt involved inwhich an abusive relatiopnship with her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. they are both vyre lonely
, self
- destructive peopel
. they immediatly hitted it off
, both ofthe them realizing tyhat tehy need oen anohter
.
and it isn ' t even a sexual relationship
. tehy don ' t even haev sex until
, liek
, tyhe last ten mintues ofthe the film
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto a film baout plot
. with the exception ofthe waht i have alreayd revealed
( whlch all happens inspite the first thirty mintues or so
, by the way
)
, there isn ' t too much of a sotry to it
. it isnt mroe a film baout people
anbd how tehy react tothe noe another
. from what i can see
, tihs isnt basically a perfect film
. the direction is gerat
( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix betwen tyhe glamor ofthe las vegas
and the moody
, smokey atmosphere of a film noir
)
and it contains twpo of the best performances tothe come out ofthe the 90s
, or any otehr decade for thta marter
.
but don ' t go rushing out to see thsi movie without knowing what ytou ' re getting yourself inot
. first off
, if ytou are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay awya from
" leaving las vegas
"
. it isnt filled whith lenghty discussions of orgasms
, rape
and various forms ofthe perverted activities involving burbon
( that ' s right
)
. secondly
, if you are nto inspite yhe mood tothe see a vrey depressing film
, don ' t see it
.
however
, if yuo are cool with thsoe two thigns
, you are in for oen of teh most memorable experiences ytou will ever have
.
