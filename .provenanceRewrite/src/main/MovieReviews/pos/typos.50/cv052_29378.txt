. review
:
" memento
" is tyhe sort of movei i wish i ' d writed
; i cxan thikn of noone higher praise than that
. i am envious tyhat nolan has concocted such a briliant
, involved
, original movie as this
. an instant film noir clasic
,
" emento
" isnt virtually flawless
. the script isnt unlike any i have ever seen
-
- a noteable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity
.
although the idae of starting at the
" conclusion
" of tghe plotline
anbd
thne moving backward inthe time tothe tjhe
" strat
" isnt not entirely newyorker
, never before ahve i witnessed it executed wtih such flair
anbd coherence
.
" memento
" is endlessly exicting
and inventive
, a rare story which keeps hte viewers guessing durring the film itself
,
and mulling over its connotations long affter leaving tje theatre
.
annd it is nto mearly an excercise in cerebrality
; htere isnt plenty of acation
adn an unexpected dose of humour to keep the procedings livley
. nolan ' s direction is equally effective
, never losing its crispness
and clarity dispite
" momento
" ' s challenging gimmick
.
and tothe top everyting off
, all thge performances rise tothe hte occasion
. pierce is terific as tyhe troubled leonard
; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie
;
anbd pantoliano ' s teddy acheives a splendidly affable
yot sinister qualit
.
" memneto
" may be the yera ' s best screenplay
,
adn is certainly amoungst the top theatrical atractions ofthe 2001
.
