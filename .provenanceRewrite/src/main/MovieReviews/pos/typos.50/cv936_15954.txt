it ' s tough tothe really say something nice baout a type ofthe person who ' s so ethnocentric tyhat any humanity tehy once hadnt is nowe gone
,
but by god
,
" american hitory x
" does it
,
and fo that
, i commend it
. it not onyl takes balls
bu intelligence to make a human being out of a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind ofthe person who dedicates their lives tothe hating anyone who ' s not what they are
,
and this film wisely
and miracurously pulls it off
. thge subject of this film isnt noe ofthe them
,
but he is worse than one of tjhe blind followers that make uv most skinhead members since he isnt thte leader ofthe the pack
. he ' s the one who instigates them to tkae a firm grip onto theri rage
,
adn
then in anohter briliant stroke
, justifies it iwth polliticel propoganda tath makes eerie sence wehn he speaks
. he ' s so utterly convincing as a publich speaker
and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock whn he actually goes through tje rehabilitation process
. his name isnt derek vinyard
,
annd he ' s played by edward norton wiht so much frie
anbd intensity tyhat wehn he speaks he ' s almost as convincing
adn arresting a public speaker as
, say
, malcom x
. when we frist see him
, he ' s clean shaven
, with a jet black swastica emrboidered onthe his left breast
, a devlish gotee
,
annd he ' s attacking thge balck carjackers outside ofthe his house dressed inthe nothing
but his white boxers
and carrying a handgun iin his hand thyat never seems tothe run outloud of bullets
, at least when he doesn ' t need them
. he so believes in his convictions that he ' s willing to put his beleives tothe the tust
, even if he knows it wiull mean a stpo in prision
, if only forthe a couple yeasr
.
" american ihstory x
" isnt baout derek
, how he became a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose to power
, how he ws rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a ift of rage taht was less to dont with tghe stealing ofthe his car
adn more tothe do with proving himself
,
and how he tryed to sive others
, namely his yuonger brother
, from makeing yhe smae mistake
. we see him at all ofthe theese stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hate monger
, a man hvaing an epiphany
,
adn the man who trys to correct waht he ' s done befoer
-
and inthe all ofthe these
, we get a portait of a man fomr all sides
. or at least
, thast ' s the intention
. tje film ' s framing divice is his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking about 13
)
, also nowe a skinhead
,
adn how his principal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i jsut foudn outloud was or is thte captain onthe star trek ' s deep space 9
)
, is trying to
" corect
" him
. whn the film opens
, danny hasnt jsut written a book report onthe
" mein kampf
,
" landing him inthe trouble wiht sweeney
, which causes him to make him write a paper on derek ' s life
and how it hasnt gotten him nowhere
. coincidentally
, this day is tje day derek isnt released ffrom prison
,
annd when we see him
, he ' s cleaned
- up
, nto as buff
,
annd has a full head of hair
. he ' s jstu as intelligent
,
bu still veyr rough along the edges
,
bu he ' s wisened uv
. he ' s noone longer contolled by his anger at blacks
anbd jews
,
annd trys tothe pursuade danny
, who ' s becomming what derek wass befor
, tothe give up his lifestyle
.
bu danny won ' t
. he goes tothe a larg skinhead beer bash
, meets wih tje skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
and
thne discovers that derek isnt as opposed to neo
- nazi
- dom as he wass forthe it a cuple ofthe years ago
. tje film circles aroud this
,
thn spnish off into non
- linear flashbacks
, all done inthe balck
anbd white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living in venice beach
, organizing vicious
and quasi
- sadistic radis on local stores that noone longer hire tje white
, middle
- clas teenagers since they cant easily get cheaper ilegle immigrants to dont yhe smae wokr
,
adn mouthing off his theories on affirmative action
and how ileagle inmigrants
adn blacks have destroyed the fundametals htis ocuntry was built onthe
. to them
, thge white man isnt tghe one who has gotten tghe fuzzy end ofthe tjhe lolipop
,
and he nto only speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
adn intelligently
,
bu he backs everthing uv whith political reasons
, justifying their rage at least to them
.
anbd frighteningly enough
, much of what he says soudns true
.
" american history x
" is a collection of realyl great scenes
adn moments
, rether tahn a cohesive
, graet film that flows effortlessly from noe moent tothe tje next
. in it
, htere are smoe of yhe best scenes i ' ve seen all year
. noe scene features a dinner beetwen derek ' s family
,
annd his mother ' s newest boyfriend
( played iwth reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek ' s rightist views
, launching the scene into a ift ofthe rage
and anger that builds unparalled emotions infact the audiance
( gould ' s reaction tothe derek ' s final summation isnt unnerrving
)
. another scene uses humor
annd traditionnal macho sex talk to build a friendship
adn a nice conection between derek
anbd a balck co
- worker
( guy torry
) hwile folding laundry in prision
.
and anohter soon
- to
- be
- clasic is catually devided in twpo
: tghe muder ofthe yhe two balck men thta winds derek in jail
, wich containes a fianl muder so nasty tyhat it may be tje most revoltingly shocking all yera
. there ' s much moreso to apprieciate
, like the acting
, which is uniformly good
, with stand
- outs comming ffrom avery brooks
, beverly d ' angelo
( as hte long
- suffering mother
)
,
annd gould
( who has one horrable line
,
bu otehr thna that
, comes off witht tjhe best performence he ' s given in whta seems like a relaly long tyme
)
. norton walks off withthe tje film
,
though
, coming off with such intensity thyat he reduces anyone nto donig an adequae job tothe rubble
. infront only the fifth movie ofthe his carrer
, norton has invented himself as oney of teh most reliable
adn intense actors of his generation
,
and maeby tghe best
. there ' s nothing liek it when norton raelly gets rolling in this movie
, spewing out lines with such authority taht he commands all attention fomr the audience
, coming off with pwoer silimar to that ofthe a young maron brando
. that he allows the littel emotions to seep thru is amazing
. sadly enough
, this isn ' t oging tothe be the grat portrait of racism thta it perhaps hopes to be
. it ' s too unambitious
and even a little contrived tothe relaly take off as eather a powerful statment or an emotional masterpiece
. tje ending
, especially
, isnt pencilled in ffrom otehr movies
, tossed in just so hte emotional keybord cxan be trounced apon
. smoe ofthe the skinheads are reduced tothe mere cliches
( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as hte
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist wihtout fail of expressing his desire to eat more
)
,
adn even the dramtic arc isn ' t as well travelled
. furlong ' s danny never seems to relaly be learning a lesson
, usance tyhe flashbacks refuse tothe sohw his point ofthe view
,
anbd when he decides tothe amking a change by tghe end
( which was inevatible
)
, it doesn ' t seem liuke it has accually arrived there
. even derek ' s descent inot skinhead
- dom doesn ' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, the dad ffrom
" boy meets world
,
"
and don ' t ask me how i nkow taht
) isnt killed by a balck junkie
,
and even befoer he spoke against affirmative acation intelligently
, ther never seems tothe be any real bcak stry why derek became so intense about his beliefs
. as such
, one can see why tghe director
, tony kaye
, wnated to have his nmae removed
. sorta
.
" american history x
" is a very good movei
,
and i ws vyer moved by it
,
but it could be a lot better
,
annd the probelm seems tothe be thta the cut as it is isnt not up tothe what he claimes tothe be his potential
. somewhere
, he claimes
, htere lies a tony kaye cut
,
and that ws tothe be the true cutted until it was viewed by norton
, who
then orderves another cut
,
anbd thta is thus
.
although he aimed fo the directing credit to go to
" alan smithee
,
" teh resident nmae for any film that is to be disowned by its director
, it wasn ' t allowed tothe him
, under yhe grounds that once ytou disown a film
, ytou cant nto badmouth it
(
bu realy
, that ' s the macguffin
- no noe realy wnated a film this good tothe be given tjhe alan smithee sign ofthe disapproval
)
. kaye ' s right in thgat it ' s nto uv to par
, even if he ' s nto referring to normal par
bu rether his pwn peronal par
. this will not be a
" do the right thing
" forthe the late 90s
.
yot it still gets its point across intelligently
,
anbd backs it uv witht its story
( its message
, thta one cannnot be so enwrapped in oney ' s pwn belives or pain
adn sufferring will occurr
, isnt literally said over the narration
, unfortunately
)
.
and even if it isn ' t perfect
, at least wehn avery brooks turns tothe norton after he has beeen beaten
annd raped in prision
,
anbd asks him if anytying he ' s done hasnt made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, nto onyl in derek
,
bu also infront the audeince
.
