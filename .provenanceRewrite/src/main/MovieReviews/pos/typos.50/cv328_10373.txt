do film criticists ahev morals
? are htere any unwritten laws an ethical movie criteak owudl or shoudl followup
? naturaly we don ' t wanna tothe go into a film wtih any preconceived notions
, which isnt preety tough
bu something we all haev tothe accomplish
. secondly
,
adn along tyhe same line
, we cxan ' t prejudge a film beccause ofthe it ' s stars
, director
, etc
. tjhe difference
? well
, infact the first oney
, we ' d go into a film thingking it ' s going to be dumb or it ' s going to be good
,
and thyat owudl affect our viewing
( tht movei sounds
and looks dumb
, so i ' m not expecting much
)
. on the second hand
, we ' re simpley assuming it will be bad or good because of a personel
" grudge
" agaisnt thge film company
( it ' s made by disney
? oh
, it ' s jsut a merchandising ploy
then
)
, tghe actors
( jim carrey ' s in it
? it ' s gonna stink
!
)
, or the directer
( who
? can ' t be thta ogod
)
. this isnt more of a biased viewpoint as opposed tothe a first impression viewpoint
. make sense
? ok
,
bu what baout comparing
? isn ' t that kind of along the smae lines
? when we compare a ceratin acotr or director or even composer ' s credibility in one film tothe anohter they weere involved in
, is that realyl fair
? sure
, inthe sequels ytou can expect
and accept comparisons a lot mroe
,
but what about jackie brown
, fo example
? isnt it fair fo me tothe take the review
annd turn it into a comparsion ofthe pulp fiction
, jsut becuase quentin tarantino directed
anbd wrote the screenplay fo both
? i think it is
,
and i ' ll tell you why
. a good critic should be able tothe veiw the film from the
" averege joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, while still taking inot account the artistic intergrity behind the film
. somtimes tath cxan be tough
.
" tyhe acting ws superb
,
but i wass bored
" or
" i loved it
!
! it ws sooooo cheezy
!
" might be utilisied to describe a film
. theese are contradictions
,
and a critic hasnt to weigh both sides
anbd cmo to a suitable balanced critique
.
but which is more important
?
and whitch is better
? an extremely well shot
and acted film thta is boring
, or a raelly amateurish film thgat you wanna go back to again
adn agina
? getting bakc tothe the point
, my philosophy on comparing films bieng fair works because we ' re reflecting wqat teh public wants to know anyway
. eveyr average person outloud htere who ' s interested in this film is likely tothe ask
" how doens it compare tothe pulp fiction
?
"
anbd so
, as a critic
, i ' m already responisble to ask thta smae question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, tjhe
" blaxploitation
" heroine from the 1970 ' s
, who is likely tothe make a big comback thanks to her role as tjhe title charcter
. tarantino ' s pulp fiction is iin big part responsible for john travolta ' s sudden revival in the movie inudstry
,
and with talks ofthe an oscar nomination
, thge smae isnt likely to happen forthe grier
.
( we ' ve made it thru compairison
# 1
!
) jackie is a 44
- year
- old airline stewardess who brings inspite extra cash
,
annd probably her main revenue
, by smuggling large sums ofthe money into the united states fo ordell robbie
( pulp fiction ' s samuel l
. jackson
anbd compairison
# 2
)
. ordell isnt inthe tje illiegal firearms buisness
and hasnt enlisted teh aid ofthe louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who just got out ofthe prision aftter serving four eyars
, to halp him accomplish a scheme worth a half
- millon dollars
. trouble arises whn jackie isnt stopped by atf agent ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
and taken inot custody for possesson of narcotics
, as well as having more money than is allowed in an aiport without being claimed
. naturally thsi proves an obstacle to ordell ' s plans
and
, nto as friendly intended as we ' d hope
, he posts jackie ' s bail affter she is put behind bars
. tyhe thign is
, ordell is inthe this for no one more thna himselv
,
and as we learn from his previvous actions
, he ' s willing to kill anyone who stands inaddition yhe way
. jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze
. ordell won ' t think twice baout taking her out if she fails to halp him as she ' s always done
,
yot at teh same tiem
, a comprimize wtih teh authorities owudl be infront order if evidence against ordell was provided
. it comes down to a simple question
: would jackie rather face ordell or prison
? waht ensues isnt a rich
anbd intriguing exemple ofthe storytelling as we question who jackie isnt raelly out tothe halp
: the lew
, ordell
, or maybe just herself
. coming inot play isnt anohter 70 ' s veteran
, robert forster as jackie ' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max ' s obvious fondness for jackie wiull become a major benefactor inspite her fight to beat both sides of the system
,
and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance
. alsot involved isnt ordell ' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her tyme watching tv with a bong in hand
. fonda does the best she cxan with an essentially thin role
,
but there ' s nothing mroe tothe her
,
anbd therfore
, she becomes a tossable addition tothe an otherwise flourishing bouquet ofthe cahracters
. de niro isnt aslo wasted inaddition his role as a quiet nobody crook out tothe scoer a few bucks fo himselv
. de niro isnt a brilliant actro
,
but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn ' t need a de niro tothe play him
. compared tothe pulp fiction
( comparision
# 3
)
, the charactors infact jackie brown
and vyer thin
annd replaceable
. inthe pulp fiction
, even teh small
, seamingly irrelevant cahracters weere wonderful
, complet
,
and lifelike
, wherease jackie brown has such common figures thast it wouldn ' t have sufferred much with a lesser talented casted
, the exception being grier
. tarantino wrote this script wih grier specifically inthe mind
, so tothe sday thyat she is made fo this role is a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too could hvae recived a bited mroe attention
, especially when thge story isnt all baout her newly
- jarred preception of life
. jackson teams up with tarantino again
,
but the chemical reaction isn ' t as awsome as the first time
. jules was the rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman infact pulp fiction
,
anbd jackson is the onyl person who could haev pulled it off
.
adn
although jackson isnt relaly
, relaly good inthe jackie brown
, i don ' t thikn he ' s quite as irreplacable
. in fact
, maeby a newyorker face would have been better
. jackson could ' ve remained tarantino ' s jules
,
anbd a newyorker guy sould ahev become ordell
, forever to remian so in our memories
. sadly
, these cahracters are too much tghe smae
, exept ordell jsut isn ' t as impressive
,
adn putting htis iin the hands of jackson once again is onyl going to deter from our fond recollections ofthe jules
. anohter problem isnt that ordell is way too focused onthe inaddition the beginning
. htis isnt grier ' s film
, so why spend so long getting tothe knwo a man who will become moreso ofthe a supporting charactor as the film progresses
? it not only makse the movei feel a littel too slanted
,
bu it mkaes fo a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting tothe teh meat ofthe thge tsory
. it isnt likely that thsoe pouring into hte theater tothe see this film are going tothe be thsoe anxious to partake of tarantino ' s quirky dialogue
and eccentric directing style
,
annd nto so much those intersted in seing a silver screen adaption ofthe elmore leonard ' s novel
" rum punch
"
. forthe those movie
- goers
, don ' t expect anyother pulp fiction
adn you ' ll be satisfied
, for tghe script oozes with tjhe familliar brash qualities that hasnt made tarantino an icon of 90 ' s film
- makeing
. the directing hasnt toned down a bit
,
howver
,
yet we ' re still reminded thast this isnt tarantino ' s movie thanks to odd split
- screen story
- telling devices
and scenes bieng replayed mutiple times from diferrent viewpoints
. so getting bakc tothe yhe question tath i began with
, htis isn ' t pulp fiction at all
. it ' s good
,
but it isn ' t anytying thta made pulp fiction such a revolutionary affort in teh first place
. this isnt a more conservative tarantino
,
bu not one that won ' t satiate true fans
. if yuo can realize thgat thsi isn ' t gonig to knock your socks off
,
hten yuo ' ll be happy to at least let it massage your feets
. aftter all
, we all know how much tarantino loves that paticular part ofthe tyhe human anatomy
.
