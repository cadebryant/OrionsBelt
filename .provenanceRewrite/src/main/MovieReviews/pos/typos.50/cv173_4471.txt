. copycat
" borrows
" a lot ffrom silence ofthe the lambs
annd infront most cases
, it did wrok
.
but copycat trys tothe be a littel bited moreso by immersing the audience inot the lives of its main characters to give them moreso believability
, tihs wass rather unnecesary as the scenes seem to disrupt tjhe mood of hte entire film
anbd also

)
. copycat is a good thriller
.
although the plot is highly predicatble
and one cxan actually predict tyhe rest of the movie affter about 45 mintues inot tjhe sohw
, copycat survives from thte moments of anticipation where the audeince are held on to their seats
, in anticipation ofthe the killers next immediae move
. tihs worked preety well
and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts
. nice movei to bring your girlfriend to
