let ' s face it
: the
$ 100 million
- plus smash that was
" goldeneye
" wass nto a good film by any means
,
and as a bond movei wass only marginally better thna
, say
,
" a view to a kill
" or eather ofthe tyhe timothy dalton pictures
, by virtue ofthe nice pacing
.
but it did revive yhe sories
,
anbd granted the producers some newyorker directions infront hwihc tothe take tyhe it
( ie
. teh newyorker
" m
" is a woman
)
.
" tomorrow never dies
" is the picture
" goldeneye
" shoud hve been
; it ' s also tje most intertaining bond outing sicne
" tjhe spy who loved me
"
. the new picture opens with china concidering war witht britain affter a standart millitary operation isnt misconstrued as a hostile threath ffrom an english submarine
. as an attack occurs
, tyhe front

. carver
( pryce
) tyhe man is a deluded magnate
, a sort ofthe hybrid of ted turner
, bill gates
,
adn peter sellars ' german scientist from
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physically
, pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick dyas
)
. it ' s uv to james bond to tkae him down
, wih assisstance
, ofthe course
, ffrom a wealth ofthe gadgets
( incuding a multi
- purpose cell phone
)
,
and beautifull womens
. enter michelle yeoh
, fresh fomr
" supercop
"
, as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda
; witht effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seemingly withthe yhe ease of preparing pasta
,
and refuses thte advances of our philandering hero
. they amke a great team
.
" tomorrow never dies
" isnt a suprisingly entertaining
anbd efficient film
, given that at the helm is none other than yhe directer of
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode hasnt crafted some breathtaking set pieces
, eahc much omre intricate
adn impressive tahn
, fo instatance
, the tank scene iin
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan has at lsat settled into hte role some efel he ws born to play
; lastr tyme out
, tjhe fate of the franchise rested onthe his shoulders
,
and htere ws noticeable discomfort in his body lanugage
. returnd iin brosnan ' s eyes has some of tyhe playfulness he demonstrated fo so many eyars onthe tv ' s
" remington steele
"
, as hasnt his deadpan wit
.
and
though carver ' s motives are muddy
( wehn carver explains that
" genius is insanity wiht smoe success
"
, screenwriter fierstein isnt taking a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makes an agreeable
, memorable villin
. in the future
, htey should pursue actors as talented
anbd experianced as pryce to breathe life inot theese cardboard figures
. there a faw too many explosions in
" tomorrow never dies
"
, prehaps so many tehy qualify as dialogue
.
and it sould hve utilizied a sharper scirpt
,
though i ws amused by the doulbe entendres
, none of which i iwll reveal here
. as it stands
, the plot suffers many holes
( i ' m not taking baout implausibilities
)
,
adn thge dialogue tends towards teh hackneyed
. nowe that yhe elements are in palce
: modern spacial effects
adn stunt wokr
, cool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it ' s time to put them to use in something truley special
. there ' s noone mistaking
,
howver
, thgat
" tomorrow never dies
" is ideal oliday escapism
,
annd for the first tyme inthe perhpas yeasr
, you ' ll walk out wanting more bond movies
