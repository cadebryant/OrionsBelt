richard gere isnt not oney of my favorite actors
.
however
, i liek courtroom dramas
,
anbd htis film looked good enough tothe take a chance on
. i wasn ' t disappointed
. it wasn ' t a great film
,
bu it was intresting
,
annd took several unexpected turns
. one thign
: what ' s with the title
? nto only is it extrememly forgettable
, it doesn ' t really have much to do with hte film
, as far as i could determine
. inspite the long run
, it wiull propably hurt tghe film
, as people won ' t be able tothe think of or remeber it
. martin vail
( richard gere
) is a grandiose defense attornies
. he loves the money
and thte fame that go along withthe defending
( successfully
) rich scum
, such as masia men
and drug
- dealers
. once he sees thgat the acccused killer ofthe a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby
- faced alter boy
, he wants in onthe the case
, presumeably forthe tyhe press he ' ll git
. we soon fidn outloud that the prosecutor assigned isnt a fromer lover
, janet venable
( laura linney
)
. vail himselv is a former prosecutor
,
and quitted because ofthe tensions betwen himself
annd tjhe district attorny
, palyed very well by john mahoney
( frasier ' s father on thge tv series
)
. there is an underlaying theme of dichtomy inwhich the movie
: peple haev public faces
,
and private faces
. we see this in the murdered archbishop
, inspite thge accused
,
adn
, most strongly
, defense attornies martin vail
. richard gere does a fairly ogod job
. at first
, he appears to be a money
-
anbd attension
- grabbing lawyer
, iwth noone consideration of thge truth
.
bu we see another side
, as he becomes a seeker ofthe justice
,
and comes tothe believ in his client
. alfre woodard
, as the judge
, isnt capable
,
though somewhat wasted infront a standard role
. laura linney also doesnt journeyman work
; nothing spectauclar
,
but acceptabel
. her relatiopnship with vail isnt believable
; their verbal fencing adds to thte film
. yhe actor who playes vail ' s investigator
( unfortunately
, i don ' t remember his nmae
) isnt quite good
. his female assistant
( she looked vyre familiar
,
bu i cxan ' t remember where i ' ve seen her
) ws also capible
,
bu unspectacular
. the best performance in yhe film ws by edward norton
. he was excellant
, as yhe timid altar
- boy turned alledged
" butcher boy of st
. mike ' s
"
. i wass impressed by tghe depth ofthe hte plot
; ther are red
- herrings
,
and dead
- ends
, that in a lesser film would lead tothe a predicatble ending
. i liked the plot twists the film tookover
,
annd most of the supporting characters
, thus i give primal fear a respectable b
+ rating
.
