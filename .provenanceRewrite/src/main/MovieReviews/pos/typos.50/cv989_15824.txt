lisa cholodenko ' s
" high art
,
" is an intelligent
, quiet drama
. its stornegst quality
, aside from yhe top
- nitch central performances
, isnt the perceptive way inwhich whitch the film
, also writen by cholodenko
, observes its charactors
. they are all flawed people
, some omre troubled thna others
,
bu htey are not judged
. judging tghe characters in thsi picture would be a creative misstep onthe the filmmakers ' parts
, because no one
, no marter how bad off tehy are
, deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in smoe serious problems tyhat htey cannnot break free ofthe

.
" she very much enjoys where her career isnt headed
,
but is often nto taked very seriously by her managers
, who are always giving her petty jobs to dont
, when she konws she sould be doing moreso important thigsn
. one nihgt
, while taking a bath
, syd notices a leak comming from the appartmant above heres
, so when she goes uv htere to inform them of it
, she meets lucy beliner

, worn
- out

, who lives with her drug
- addicted german girlfriend
, greta
( patricia clarkson

, a pathetic former actress who is usualy so outloud
- ofthe
- it that she oftenly is inwhich
and out of conciousness
. syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy
,
adn dicovers that she utilizied tothe be an acclaimed photographer ten years befoer
. lucy claims she doesn ' t want to get back into the proffesion
,
but syd manages tothe convince the
" frome
" editors to do a peice on her work
. all the hwile
, syd beigns to grwo deepo feelings for lucy
, even
though she hasnt never previously beeen attracted to a woman
,
annd lucy starts a battle wtih her personal demons
.
" high art
,
" is such an effective motion picture becuase it is never suger
- coated or idealized
,
but instade an honest
anbd convincing potrait of a handfull ofthe unhappy people whose lives are goign nowhere
, hwile syd ' s luck begins tothe rise
. the film in no way isnt about lesbianism
,
bu baout love
, hwihc was a refreshing change ofthe pace from the usual stereotypical portraits ofthe homosexuality
. as lucy
and syd grow closer
adn closer together
, we really dont beleive thyat htey are falling inwhich love wiht earch otehr
, even if the relationship might be doomed
. with this picture
, ally sheedy ' s star has risen once agina
, thanks tothe her touching
, nearly flawess portrtayal ofthe lucy
, a woman who
, in tje course of a decade
, hasnt found her life consumed almsot entirely by drugs
, which has taken awya her once
- blossoming career
. her characted raelly isnt tragic
,
and one particular scene involving lucy
and her mother
, inwhich whitch lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem
,
and her mother matter
- ofthe
- factly responds by saying she cin ' t halp her
, isnt heartbreaking
.
althought not autobiographical
, sheedy hasnt hadnt drug problems infact her past
,
and i suspect she brang tyhat noledge ofthe allready bieng in lucy ' s footsteps to her role
. also very ogod isnt radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred infront the slight 1997 austrailian comedy
,
" loev
and otehr catastrophes
,
" wh caught me by suprize withthe her peformance
. easily bieng able to pass as christina ricci ' s older sister
, mitchell obtains thge same natrual charizma that hasnt made ricci so populer recently
. as accurate as almost every detail isnt infront
,
" high art
,
" i wish hte relatiopnship hadnt been more tightly written involving syd
and james
, who
, palyed by gabriel mann
, isnt left with a throwaway role
. by the timne he finds out about syd
anbd lucy
, he dissapears fomr hte film
,
and i wish there hadnt beeen anohter scene where they confronted earch other
. htis isnt a veyr minor fault
,
howver
, inaddition a film thta is full of riches
. altho many ofthe the charactors are stuck in a hopeless pit ofthe dispair
, syd
and lucy are intelligent peple who recogize thier problems
. tghe character of dominique
( anh duong
)
, teh
" frame
" editor who decides tothe give syd a chance wih her ideas
, wass alsot writed tothe be far more mature thna expeced
.
and tyhe one sex scene inwhich the film wass beautifully
and originally done
. forthe once
, it doed nto invlove steaminess
, or violent sexual activity
, or gratuitous nudity
,
but focused on the actual charactors
, who lvoe each other
,
anbd their insecurities involved in mkaing the decision to actually hvae sex
