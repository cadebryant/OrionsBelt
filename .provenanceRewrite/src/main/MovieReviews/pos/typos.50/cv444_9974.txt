a lot ofthe times a threee
- star film iwll be my favorite
. htey ' re usually tje kind ofthe movie i cin watch most often too
. they ' re usally not too deepo
, alowing for semi
- brainless relaxation
,
adn at the smae time
, nto too dumb
. men inaddition balck isnt a four
- star threee
- star film
.
( hope you could followup that one
) men iin black doesn ' t wait tothe get tothe the fun
. jstu mintues inot hte film we are introduced to agent kay
( tommy lee jones
)
, introduced tothe an aline
,
annd intrduced to the the awsome memmory
- diminishing tool that all mib agents use
. aftter all
, you cin ' t have aline witnesses running aroud with tyhat kind of noledge can yuo
? men inaddition balck isnt
, ofthe course
, teh organiztion whcih
" moniters all extra
- terrestrial activity on earth
"
. nypd officer james edwards
( iwll smith
)
, is onthe a routine foot chase whn suddenly teh no
- ogod punk he ' s chasing starts leaping up buildings
annd blinking omre tahn oney pair of eyes
. the aline delivers the simple message thta thge world isnt going to end
,
adn wih tyhat
, dives off of a roof
. naturaly nobody believes his stoyr
.
.
. nobody tht is
, except for yhe top secrt organiztion thta not even the government is aware of
. edwards
then meets agent kay
, the man who never seems to crack a smile
,
and is introduced to the mib
. edwards winds up joining the team
and is stripped of anytying thast can point bakc tothe him
( birth certificate
, drivers ilcense
,
anbd even the literal removal of his fingerprints
)
. james edwards no longer exists
. meet agent jay
. agent kay takes teh rookie jay under his wing as tehy go baout
" regular
" duties
. evenhtually a far moreso treacherous event comes into play
. a
" bug
" has landed on earth
annd isnt going tothe wipe outloud mankind if these twpo don ' t
( or cant ' t
) stop it
. tjhe plot isn ' t exactly clear
,
bu we nkow it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble bieng saught affter on earth
,
adn that isnt crucial that tyhe mib fidn it before the
" bug
" does
. barry sonnenfeld
, who also doed the addams family films
, directs htis nicely
. it ' s funn
, it ' s funny
, it ' s acation
- packed
. a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned outloud tothe be
. htis is one ofthe thsoe movies that is jsut
" funn
"
and cin ' t really be summed uv any nicer or clearer
. wiull smith
adn tommy lee jones both dont grat jobs
and both are a blast tothe watch
. definitely oen of the best films of hte tyhe summer of ' 97
, men iin balck comes highly recommeded ffrom me
!
