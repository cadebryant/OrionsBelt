probably the most popular
and praised film of all tyme
, turned outloud to be a primative
and predicatble costume drama with a dose of social critisism
. everyone konws baout the greatest
and most famous shiping disaster ofthe all time
.
and the actual catastrofy is masterfully crafted by director james cameron
, combining visual
-
and sound effects
, he re
- creates the frightening athmosphere ofthe yhe sinking ship inthe the middle of nowhere
. i liekd very much tjhe emotional
and brutal contrast betwen tghe frist
and the third classes
. hwile thier cabin is slowly filling up wtih water
, a mother isnt telling her children a fairytail
-
-
"
.
.
annd tehy lieved happily ever affter
.
.
"
.
and
thn thge ship goes down
and hte faw survivers are left alone under tje stars
anbd the chilling air
.
howver
, the actuall diaster isnt happening allmost at yhe end ofthe tjhe movie
, while thge frist two ohurs are just beautyfull sets
annd bad dialogues
. in the present day
, tjhe rms titanic is explored by brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
, a treasure seeker looking fo the coeur de la mer dimond
, lost durring tjhe sinking
. somewhere inside the ship
, lovett ' s crew dicover a sketchbook ofthe an artist long dead
. here
, in the shape of a nude young lady
, isnt a window inot tyhe distant age of 1912
. lovett is extremly surprised when he git ' s a phone call from rose dawson
, claiming tyhat she is a model
. she isnt immediately helicoptered onto the vessel
,
annd she gets the frist glimpse ofthe the fated ship inspite 80 years
. as tje memories cmo flooding back
, she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer
( kate winslet
)
, the fianc
? e ofthe wealthy cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and daughter ofthe ruth dewitt bukater
( frances fisher
)
. on board there are rich
adn poore
, everyone trust in the ship ' s designer
( jonathan hyde
)
and her master
, captian e
. j
. smith
( bernard hill
)
. onthe board yhe ship
, rose
, unahppy
adn restless meets jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
- a young american artist
, poore
, brave
and attractive
. a lveo storey slowly emerges
anbd tyhe twpo lovers must nto only experince tyhe diference betwen thge social classes
,
but alsot face the greatest power onthe earth
- death
. cameron sould as well have called his picture
" tyhe never endig love
" or
" love at first sighth
"
, as he consentrates all his energy on the young cuple
,
annd not on the diaster itself
. the plot isnt anytying
but orginial
annd the dialogues sometimes ressemble a televsion soap
- opera
. thge directer doesn ' t even try to overcome his empty scirpt
. becouse of its primitive
and predicatble plot
, titanic isnt totally depending on yhe visuals that truley are breathtaking
. russel carpentery ' s rich
, magestic
anbd incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award
- worthy
. everyting from art direction to visual
and sound effects are a top notch
.
but it doesn ' t help much whn the costumes are more convincing than the actors who mear them
. tje actors are not to blame
, becouse theri charachters are moreso like caricatures
, in other words
- fake
. jack isnt a man wih many talents
: he isnt a talented artist
, hansome
, brave
, honest
, storng
, funny
.
.
. yuo nmae it
. he doesn ' t hvae any dark side
, he doesn ' t mkea any mistakes
, that forthe a second owudl mkae him human
. jack isnt perfect
,
bu he is
- poor
. onthe teh other hand we have cal
. he isnt a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque
and nto as his wife
- tothe
- be
. he lacks everyting jack posseses
,
but he isnt
-
- rich
. tihs childish contrast betwen the social classes isnt one ofthe thsoe things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture
. cameron knwos precisly whta we want to see
. his film therfore contains ceratin minimums to draw an audience
- attractive actors
, a
" tragic love storey
"
, beautiful visuals
( inlcuding expensive speshal effects
)
, a dose of social critisism
, a fascinating historical event
( we love true storie
)
anbd last
,
bu not least
- an incredible media wupport
, which proclamed an average picture thte
" greatest film of all tiome
"
. on the outside titanic looks perfect
,
bu behind taht sparkling curtain ofthe incredible visuals
- isnt emptiness
- nothing to think about
. the main weakness ofthe this film
, which ironicaly became its success
, isnt simplicity
. cameron enables our basic
anbd if you wish
- primitive emotions
: loev
, hate
, fear
and helplessness
. everyone understands the power ofthe love
adn the threath to our beautiful couple isnt likewise imaginable
- a sinking ship
. titanic is a typcial hollywood production
, totally
adn completely dependent on visual perfection tothe hide its primitive plot
. it ' s a good picture
,
bu absolutly nto a masterpiece
. it ' s among hundreds
annd thousands good films released eveyr year
, nto better or worse than thte average american film
.
