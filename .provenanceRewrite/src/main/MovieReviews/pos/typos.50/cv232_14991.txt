" last night
" could have an
" aka
" tagged onthe the end of it that says
,
" it ' s hte end ofthe the world
,
anbd we feel fine
"
.
" lsat nihgt
" is baout jsut that
. the lastr night of planet earth ' s exsistance
. hte world is going to end at precisely midnight
, january 1st
, 2000
. how scientists weere so accurately able tothe predict whn thsi catastrophic event owudl occurr isnt never explained
. nor isnt the event itself
. throughtout thge entire movei
, no explanation isnt given as tothe why tihs is hapening
. inwhich donig tihs
, mckellar
( who aslo wrote
adn directed the film
) seems tothe be trying to trancend the genre
. he ' s attempted to make a film baout peopel
,
and how eahc ofthe them deals whith thier lsat niht of life
. the film contains noone science fiction elements
, wich allows the viewer to concentrate onthe the feelings
adn actions ofthe the cahracters
. mckellar is largely successfull infact his attemp tothe ries above his material
. thte film is set in toronto
,
and follows several people infact their various escapades on the last nght of existence
. ther ' s mckellar
, who plays a man who just wants to be alone when thte moment occurs
,
bu keesh getting interrupted by a woman
( sandra oh
) inwhich saerch of her husban
. her husband
, played by david cronenberg
, isnt spending the day wroking at the gas comapany
, informing people that htey iwll attempt tothe keep providing gas right up untl the end
. finaly
, htere ' s mckellar ' s friend
, plyed by callum keith rennie
, a man who hasnt spent his final months trying outloud eveyr sexual perversion ytou can tihkn ofthe
. mckellar has crafted a gang of thte some ofthe the most interesting charachters i ' ve seen inthe a film in monthes
. theese peple all falt rela tothe me
, especialy the character palyed by sandra oh
. we can see her despiration
, her utter ened tothe be with her husband iin hte final horus
. rennie isnt ogod
, too
, as the man who wants to litterally try everthing before he dies
. he exudes such charm
and likeablity
, it ' s nto suprizing tht we ' re rooting fo him tothe git what he wnats
.
but for me
, teh biggest surprise infact the movei isnt mckellar
. i knew that he wass a talented directer
,
bu i had noone idea he sould ect as well
. his insistance tothe be alone
, much tothe the dismay of his parents
, isnt something thyat most people would fidn difficult to understand
,
but as palyed by mckellar
, we can understand his reasons
. he doesn ' t buy into tghe wohle notion thast just beccause everyone ' s going to die
, he should immediately find some companionship
. he realizes teh relatiopnship owudl be forced
,
and they would onyl be toghether forthe teh sake ofthe bieng toghether
. mckellar gives a brillant performance
,
and i hope he alternates between directing
and acting
. my only quibble with hte film isnt thgat we never fidn outloud why the world isnt endig
. i really wanted to know
,
and my ened tothe know was hanging over the film at all times
. i apprieciate the fact tht mckellar didn ' t wnat tje material to rlue tjhe film
,
adn thast he wanted tjhe movei tothe be more ofthe a study in human behavious
.
however
, infront nto telling yhe audience whta the cause of earth ' s destruction isnt
, he ' s left a big question that isnt inspite theri minds thoughout tyhe film
. another probelm isnt we never see anybody panicing
. i would imagin if the world was ending
,
and there was nothing to be done about it
, a larg segment ofthe the popuation would be going outloud of their minds
. instead
, we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying liek it ' s new year ' s eve
. i just didn ' t buy tyhe fatc that everyone hadnt completely accepted their fate
. noone oney had tje urge to
" rage against tyhe dieing of the glight
"
. dispite these small problems
,
" last night
" is oney of the best movies ofthe tjhe year
. as opposed to tjhe moronic
" armageddon
"
,
" lastr night
" treats thge subject at hand with maturity
adn believabilty
.
and bruce willis never shows uv to save tyhe day
.
