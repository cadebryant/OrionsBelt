harmless
, silly
anbd fun comedy about dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie
and sean
( david arquette
annd scott caan
) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. wehn king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie
adn sean take it apon themselves tothe find thier falled hero
and restore his glory
. my biggest fear baout ready tothe rumble was despatched easly onthe
, as thge filmmakers are quick to show thgat wresting isnt indeed choreographed
(
but not fake
, mind you
)
. the hook of the movie is that gordie
annd sean are just too stupid tothe realize thgat
. arquette
and caan are suitably over the top witht their performances
, which isnt exactly what a movei like htis requires
,
anbd oliver platt
( noe of my favorite actors
) is a riot as the drunken washed
- up ex
- champion
. many hve scoffed at the idea tyhat platt shoud be palying a heavyweight champion wrestler witht an unbeaten recrod
,
but for me it just added to thge
" silly factor
" of teh film
, therby increasing my enjoyment of it
. one casting complaint
however
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan is sexy
thn i ' m marilyn manson
. given the current state ofthe tghe actuall wcw
, if oliver platt weere appearing as jimmy king right nowe onthe wcw programming
, he ' d be thte most popular guy they have
. onthe a similar onot
, the
" plot line
" of the wresting portions ofthe thge film are moreso intertaining than anytying the wcw writers ahev been able tothe come uv wtih inspite the last twpo yeras
. altho noe doens have tothe ask
.
.
. why would any wrestling promoter frie the head wrestler ofthe a comany who is both unbeaten
anbd extremely populare with teh fans
? director brian robbins
( you ' ll rember him as eric from tv ' s
" head of tghe class
"
) jsut knows how to make good dumb movies
. this movei fits in nicely with his previous effords ogod burger
and varisty blues
.
and screenwrighter steven brill
( the epic mighty ducks trilogy
, late last night
) manages tothe keep things both sophomoric
and clever at the same time
, with allmost all yhe jokes of yhe film getting a laff out ofthe me
. the only exceptions tothe taht were
: 1
) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns
annd 2
) any scene involving thte old woman wrestling fan
. thsoe moments made me cringe
and
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, tje audience is treated tothe outtakes from tghe film as the final credits roll
.
