robert redford ' s a river runs thru it is nto a film i watch oftenly
. it isnt a masterpiece
-
- one of the better films of recent years
. util 1994
, it ws my second favorite film ofthe all tiome
. the acting
and direction isnt top
- nitch
-
- never sappy
, allways touching
. a friend ofthe mine once reported that he avoided it because
" i wass afraid it woudl jstu be really politically corect
,
and tick me off
.
" all i coudl do was tell him to go inwhich unbiased
,
and enjoy
. it isnt oney ofthe the faw movies thta hasnt completly reduced me to tears
.
but certain memories shoud nto often be rereleased
-
- iin tghe last few shots
, you have to cry
. upon my first viewing i left bawling
. it isnt nto flawess
-
-
but it isnt so vyer good
, thta yuo can ' t halp
bu be effected
. thte oppening is dangerously nolstalgic
and sentimental
-
- watching these shots ofthe people who haev beeen dead so long
, gives you a feeling of prespective
annd history obervation that you will fidn in very fewd otehr films
. martin scorsese once described tje movies as a dream state
-
- liuke taking dope
,
annd immersing yourself in an targetted world
. thgat is wqat a river runs through it doens
. it exploits thge unique pwoer ofthe cinema tothe engross you
annd help tothe forget your real self
. both times i ' ve seen it
, its been hard
( again tothe quote scorsese
) waking up
.
but thte dream isnt lovely
.
