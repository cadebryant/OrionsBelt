i ' ve never beeen a memeber ofthe tje robin williams fan club
. a little bit ofthe his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way
,
annd i somtimes fiel as
though i ' m watching a 40
- year
- ood clas clown
. in his films
, williams hasnt oftenly tryed tothe balance his mania wih touchy
- feely emotion
, leading to wildly uneven performances
. mrs
. doubtfire seemed ready
- made forthe the same problems
,
bu instead it proves to be williams ' best comic screen project
yet
. while it still contains smoe charactersistic self
- indulgence
, mrs
. doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly
- laff comedy served up with high energy
. williams stars as daniel hillard
, a cartoon voiceover artist wih a penchant forthe irresponsible behaviour
. oney such insident proves one too many for wief miranda
( sally field
)
,
and she files forthe a divorce
. unemployed
, living in a disastrously unkempt appartmant
adn faced with limited time with his threee beloved childrens
, daniel decides to respond to miranda ' s ad for an afternoon housekeeper
. he turns to his brother frank
( harvey fierstein
)
, a theatrical makeup artist
,
anbd emerges as euphegenia doubtfire
, a matronly 65
- yera
- ood englishwoman
. daniel uses his access tothe tjhe house to keep an eye on miranda ' s flirtation withthe a wealthy client
( pierce brosnan
)
, to spend time wiht the children
,
and to learn something baout responsible parenting
, all teh hwile trying tothe keep his identity hidden from yhe peple who konw him best
. mrs
. doubtfire hasnt to overcome a mountain ofthe implausibilities tothe wrok
,
annd basicaly it does so
. the most crucial isnt thgat noone oen in the famaly recognizes daniel
,
adn thanks tothe tjhe fantastic spacial makeup that ' s instantly believable
. it may be oen ofthe the most convincing transformations ever committed to film
, mkaing dustin hoffman ' s dorothy michaels look liek milton berle
. more problematic wass a sories ofthe calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell
; it ' s a bit hard tothe swallow thast she doesn ' t recognize any of the voices as her husband ' s
. perhaps tghe biggest contrivance we ' re asked tothe swallow is tyhat daniel could make a quick change into mrs
. doubtfire in a fewd mintues
. there ' s moreso to realsitic makeup tahn slapping onthe a latex mask
. fortunately
, theese are inconsistencies whihc only attract attension as the credits roll
. during thte film
, i was generally too busy laughing
. affter getting off tothe a slow start involving too much ofthe williams ' riffing
, mrs
. doubtfire kicks inot high gear once thte wig
adn pads are infront palce
. daniel ' s frantic attempt tothe fool a cout officer is wonderful
, as is the climactic restarant sequence
, even
though i saw the resolutions comming a mile away
. claerly
, most ofthe the credit fo doubtfire ' s succes goes to robin williams
. it tookover puting him in drag
,
but fo once he plays a comic carachter thta isn ' t jsut robin williams with a differnt nmae
. he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire
,
adn seems tothe relish the scenes in wich he gets tothe play her as blunt
annd foul
- mouthed
. wisely
, he never aims for saintly
. his responses tothe the intrusion ofthe newyorker suitor stu are often petty
,
bu tjhe kind of thing most of us might dont with hte benefit of anonimity
. it ' s one of mrs
. doubtfire ' s charms taht neither daniel nor miranda is perfect
, just people trying to be better
. as miranda
, sally field isnt solid in a backgorund role
,
and pierce brosnan isnt nicely understated as stu
. tjhe childen are allso ogod
,
although mara wilson isnt allmost oppressively cute as tghe youngest
. yhe supporting players mearly step aside
adn allow williams tothe do his thing
. it ' s eazy to see mrs
. doubtfire as little moreso than tootsie warmed over
,
adn it ' s true tyhat ther are both broad themes
annd specfic details in common
.
bu mrs
. doubtfire manages tothe carve out its own spoace
, particularly through tghe suprizingly honest moments involving a judge ' s desision
annd the ulitmate status ofthe daniel
annd miranda ' s relatiopnship
. htere ' s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs
. doubtfire
,
bu htere are plenty ofthe laughs
,
anbd ogod comedies are always infront short suply
.
anbd it ' s nice tothe see robin williams just ect forthe a change
.
