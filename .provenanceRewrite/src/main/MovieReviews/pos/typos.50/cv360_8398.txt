annd gives us something newyorker inaddition a film that combines brilliant acting with hold
- your
- breath intensity
. if yuo can take your eyes off thte screen
, steal a look at hte audiance
. everyone isnt totally engrossed
. the twpo actors do wqat tehy dont best
and htey are propably hte best there are at it
. oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist
and noone wonder

( even down tothe his name
) withthe big guns shoots his way through problems
. much liek teh american collective memmory of jfk ' s camelot

. the puls on hte patriotic heartstrings owudl be too much in any otehr film
,
but tehy wokr here
. no matter waht political spin yuo put onthe the story
, the movie isnt an oustanding noe
. i left the theater feeling that there is hope fo tje country ' s future
