natrual born killers isnt really a vrey simple stor that
, in essence
, has already been told in bonnie
& clyde with smoe major variations inspite empahsis
, mood
and degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" in one case bank robbers
and killers
adn iin the other massmedia murderers
. both relate tyhe story of a cuple liberated by lveo
.
but where bonnie
& clyde ws partial
and subtle
, naturual born killers is total
adn blatant
. where bonnie
& clyde ws social
, natural born killers is psychological
. what bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, naturual born killers confronts
annd explores
. waht bonnie
and clyde stole
, mickey
annd mallory kill
. tothe examin naturual born killers as nothing omre than a pyschological odessy of realization
anbd exposure ofthe thte frauds surrounding them
, exressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues tghe mysterious power this film wields
. for the most part
, when mickey
adn mallory kill
, they kill all taht frustrates them unnecesarily
, they kill waht isnt trying to kill them
, they kill what dissembles
and cowers ffrom life
, tehy kill wqat needs tothe be killed
. this mythos is at least as old as teh hindu trinity
. brahma created
. vishnu preserved
.
anbd siva destroyed
,
bu he destroyed what needed tothe be destroyed tothe mkae way for tghe usefull creations of brahma
. the following may be painfully mundane
bu metaphorically so accurate
, i ' m forced to say it fo clarity ' s sake
: a plumber must remove the old lead
anbd coppr pipes
, tath isnt
, destroy the ood plumbing sytem in order tothe replace it iwth the newyorker one made of plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie
and clyde
, mickey
adn mallory
,
adn siva are all productive destroyers
. i think you sould sday wihtout much of a challenge taht religion is responsible forthe moreso killing
anbd death
, presently
adn historically
, than any otehr phenonmena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. you sould reverse subject
anbd predicate inwhich earch instatance
and still not be challanged
. religon is an orgy ofthe killing
. the insitution ofthe hte state only misses firt palce forthe technical reasons like it hasn ' t beeen a major player forthe as long or tje twpo are frequently indistinguishable
.
" thte state is the divine idae apon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaninng it isnt absolute
, all
- poweful
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallible
, authoritarian
and patriarchal jsut liek jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, what does all thsi have tothe do withthe natural born killers
? let me first say tyhat religions of tihs nature
, in teh ideal
, take the place ofthe sex
. consider the cathlic chuch
, which in its hey
- dey
, took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever
. god tkaes hte palce ofthe sex as manifested in all thsoe vows of celibacy taked by the pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. htey forego tyhe oen
, inaddition order tothe come closer tothe the other
. during the middle ages
, wehn this doctrine was unmitigated
annd unchallenged
, tje most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms ofthe scope
anbd magnitude rose to pwoer
.
( parenthetically
, witness plato as well
. in the repubic
, he attempted to launch tje firt systematic absolutist regime
. nto coincidentally he was something ofthe a mistic himselv
, regularly assailing the passions
.
) catholocism
, as policy
, attacks the passions as evil
. it sees intercourse onyl as a means tothe perpetuate the species not as a way tothe pleasure
. masterbation is consdiered a sin wiht yhe sacrament of penance necessary fo absolution
. tihs is religeon
, this is authoritarianism in its essence
. as further evidence
, tghe nazis hadnt the smae attitudes as the curch on theese matters
. our culture
, most of the cultures ofthe the world hve beeen steeped in thsi tradition for thousands of eyasr
. we cant ' t halp
bu addopt
, even internalize soem of theese same authoritarian attitudes
, leading to a distructive splitted between tje biological
and social self
. mickey
annd mallory knox internalized them
, too
,
thn through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked iin each one ofthe them by the presense ofthe the otehr
, discovered them
,
and began expurgating them ffrom themselfs
and from teh world inaddition the proces unifying themselves
. it isnt a straightforward liberation through sex
. as soem good patriarch once observed
,
" you can mantain controll as long as everyone keesh their clothes on
.
" m
& m hadnt a vision ofthe what yhe world would be like wihtout contradictions
. they saw wqat civilization
and culture
anbd everyday life woudl be liek under such condidtions
.
" thte moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers
,
" as mickey says
. as a the most consistent
anbd impassioned criteak of western culture there isnt nietzsche applying his typical stridency to yhe marter
: let us look earch otehr in the face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we konw well enought how remote our place is
.
" neither by land nor by water will ytou fidn tjhe road tothe the hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, iin his day
, knew that much baout us
. beyond the noth
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we hve discovered taht happiness
; we know the way
; we got our knowlege ofthe it ffrom thousands of years infront hte labyrinth
. who else has found it
?
-
- yhe man ofthe todya
?
-
-
" i don ' t know either the way outloud or tje way in
; i am whatever doesn ' t nkwo either hte way out or hte way iin
"
-
- so sighs the man ofthe today
.
.
.
. this isnt the sort ofthe modernity that made us ill
-
- we sickened in lazy peace
, cowardly comprimize
, thge wohle virtuous dirtiness of teh modern yea
and nay
. tihs tolerance
and largeur ofthe the heart thta
" forgives
" everthing because it
" understands
" everything is a sirocco to us
. rather live amid the ice thna amung modern virtues
and other such sourth
- winds
! as far as i cin tell
, thsi is wqat the movie has to say
. its alledged critique ofthe tje media is onyl secondry
, tertiary
, quaternary
, subsidiary forthe sure
. for example wayne gayle ' s frist report ends with some gen x dued saying
,
" if i weere a mass murderer i ' d be mickey
annd mallory
,
" inthe his most exellent bill
anbd ted voice
. onthe oney level yuo cd amking teh humdrum observation that beccause hte media had glamorized these twpo psychopaths thyat tjhe uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confuzled tje marter
and tookover them forthe heroes
. it seems mroe likely tath he made an independent judgement at a subconchus level recognizing whta m
& m were uv tothe
and confessing that if he had thte balls to be so honest with hismelf he ' d be jstu like them
, killing
and destroying waht deserves it
. let me exemplify waht i ' ve been saying by analyzing a scene fomr hte film
, namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendent
, kills him
,
adn
thne castigates him for giving her
" the worst fuckin ' head i ' ve ever had inthe my life
!
!
!
" now
, i never claimed tyhat mickey
adn mallory had a perfect relationship
, becasue demonstrably they didn ' t
,
and tihs scene
and the ones leading uv tothe it sohw us thsi
. sometimes tehy are hte source ofthe each others frustrations
,
but unwilling to kill each otehr
, usance they love eahc other so much
adn are responsible fo earch others liberation
, they must kill in palce ofthe their lever
. it ' s noone secret that in this scene mallory fantasized thast her victum wass mickey
. as the attendant approached he tookover onthe mickey ' s character in tghe eyes ofthe mallory
. she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in tje hotel room
annd wass haveing secret fantasies baout her while making love tothe mallory
. apon dicovery
, mallory views thsi as a betrayal
, judges him
,
adn commutes his sentence onthe somone else
. the sytle ofthe the movie is a whole ' nother matter tath i won ' t git into vyer deeply
but surely it isnt parshally responsible fo its power
. let me just sday that its editting has the oposite effect of a western with shots tht linger forever onthe a salon entrance or the liuke suggesting the expansiveness
, barreness
and boredom ofthe the frontier lifestyle
. hte repid succession ofthe all those 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images ffrom various perspectives wiht a soundtrack somtimes iin sync
and somtimes outloud of sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. alsot
, jungian archetypes abound
. theese cant ' t help
but trigger deepo psychological responses we cin barely understand expecially when they flash across thge screen for bearly a few frames
. some ofthe yhe best scenes
anbd lines that cmo to mind
.
( quotes are paraphrased only
)
: mickey tothe mallory
:
" one ofthe these days i ' m gonna be cummin ' fo you
,
" infact prision
, while mallory jacks mickey off
. semen is a symbol for great potential
anbd things tothe cmo
. at the tiem they haven ' t
yet had sex nor have they killed anyone
yot
. tjhe twpo ofthe course go hand in hand
. for an even more explicit semen scene see silence ofthe tjhe lambs
. mickey during his marraige tothe mallory
:
" as creator ofthe my universe
, i pronounce us man
and wief
.
" the way woody delivers tihs line is truly haunting
,
but telling
, too
. it reveals m
& m are well onthe thier way tothe expunging all theri distructive tendancies
adn replacing them with postive ones
. this is waht mickey means by
" creater ofthe my universe
,
" he is giving himself or creating forthe himselv heathy attitudes
. it is not necesarily a schizophrenic retreat inot solipsism as it frist appears
. scagnetti ' s first meeting wih mallory isnt thru her pubic hair he plucks from tyhe gas staion attendant ' s mouth
. the indian sage releasing mallory ' s father
, who was reincarnated as a snake
:
" old man
, go be a snake
,
" affter telling his
" snake story
" thta ends with
" bitch
, you knew i was a snake
.
" after mickey shoots this sege tothe death during a bewildering nightmare
, mallory says
,
" yuo killed life
!
!
!
" tihs is anohter telling quote because it implies htey didn ' t see themselves as killers of life
.
thne what weere they killing uv tothe that timne
? in smoe case just thsoe zombies faking theri way through life
, hte living dead
, as it were
. in other cases
, all tghe anti
- life forces
, the cops
and thier parents
. yhe butterfly jsut befor thge movei shifts into tjhe prison
. it of course symbolizes rebirth
. dr
. emil reingold
, as portrayed by steven wright
, passing judgement onthe m
& m
:
" mickey
and mallory know the diference between right
and wrong
, they just don ' t give a damn
.
" this is reminicent of nietzsche ' s whole philisophy
,
and maybee a direct reference to his beyond good
adn evil
. mickey
:
" the rabit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers
.
" mickey
( agian in his interview
)
:
" me
and you
, we are nto tjhe smae species
.
" notice when tyhe escape is inaddition progress we git smoe role reversals inthe terms of leadership
and control
. mickey the prisoner becomes teh leader ofthe his little gang
. teh wardens become prisoners
adn thte civilians liek wayne gayle
anbd his producer follow thge leader
, noone marter who it is
. mickey
: how ya feelin '
? wayne
: fucking grat
! mickey
: yuo got teh feelin '
? wayne
: i ' m alive
. i ' m alive for the frist fuckin ' timne
! wqat an incredible transformaton this is
. he got the feeling
and he couldn ' t contain himselv
. whta a feeling
. thast feeling ofthe mataphysical freedom that yuo cxan create your pwn universe
. mickey whn almost caught in a dead end
,
" think
, think
, thikn
, thikn
.
" go figure it out
. dwight
( tommy lee jones
) inspite general
, because he may be tjhe sickest fuck in the wohle film
. his whole attitude cxan be summed up with
,
" destory them
!
