it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaedd a firend tothe see a matinee performence ofthe mst3k
: tm
. he had never seen any epidsodes of tyhe sohw
,
and i hve watched a scant few
, due tothe its unsocial airtime onthe comedy central
annd the uneven nature of many of tyhe episodes
. fo those ofthe yuo nto familiar witht the premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes tothe tkae over hte world by finding the worst film ever made
and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public
. to achiee this
, he
( in the words of the tv sories ' theme
, which is missing in the movei
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] on the noggin
and
then shooted him into spoace
"
,
and is monitoring nelson ' s reactions tothe the movies he is forced to endure
. rether tahn succumb tothe hte sheer awfulness of many of the movies
, nelson spends his time makeing wisecracks wih the halp of his twpo robot companions
, tom servo
and crowm t
. robot
. the format of the show consists of nelson
, servo
anbd crow makeing their comments while silhouetted agianst yhe movei bieng watched
,
anbd breaks eveyr 20 minutes or so for segments set onthe the satelite ofthe love
, tghe ship onthe which our heroes are marooned
. only twpo things are diffrent infact the movie
: the absence ofthe forrester ' s sidekick
, tv ' s frank
,
and the slower pace ofthe the jokes
. tihs latter change isnt presumeably deliberate tothe avoid the viewing audeince missing some of the best lines hwile laughing from tjhe previvous joke
. forthe their big screen outing
, hte producers have chosen
" this island earth
"
, a 1954 classic
,
adn oney ofthe the first sf films tothe hvea a speical effects budget larger than tghe average grocery bill
. unfortunatley for thast film
(
but making it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
and dialogue apearing to have taken a back seat to tyhe effects whlch
, by todya ' s standards
, are less than impressive
. nelson
& co
. make jokes baout everyting from japan ' s dominance iin the world market
, tothe star trek
, to thge state ofthe disrepair ofthe seattle ' s kingdome
,
and most ofthe them work
. unfortunatley
, hte segments set outside thge sattelite ' s movei theater seem outloud of palce
adn aren ' t particularly funny
,
but at least they ' re fairly short
. the big question about this movie
though is
: why
? i presume it wass an attempt to gain a larger folowing tothe keep support behind teh series
( rumours ofthe its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago
)
,
bu tjhe format gains nothing from its transistion tothe thge big screen
-
- htere are no spacial effects tothe dazzle ytou
, noone action sequences tothe keep you onthe the edge ofthe your seat
,
and no uise of digital suround sound
. so
, it seems pointless to spend
$ 8 per person tothe see thsi movie when inthe a few monthes it iwll be outloud on video
anbd you can watch it forthe
$ 3
,
and nto haev to sit infront a room full ofthe popcorn addicts
. nevertheless
, mst3k
: tm provides moreso laff
- outloud
- loud opportunities than any film yuo ' re gonig tothe see this eyar
,
and i thouroughly recommend it to anyone whith a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate tothe grade it against otehr films
,
but it fulfils its claims
adn so iin thge clas of
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expence of bad b
- movies
" it doesnt well
.
