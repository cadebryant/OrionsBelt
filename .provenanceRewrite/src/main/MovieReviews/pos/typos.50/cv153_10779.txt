jack nicholson has a funny way of palying characters withthe very few reedeming qualities
,
but whom you end up liking anyway
. infront as ogod as it gets
, thte charater inthe question isnt melvin udall
, a successfull novelist whith obsessive
- compulsive desorder who seems bent on hvaing as littel contact with peopel arund him as possible
, except wehn he feels like bieng a royal pain in tje you
- nkwo
- where
. he ' s mean
. i mean really mean
. the opening scene shows him shoving a littel dog down tjhe trash chute ofthe his manhattan condominium
. eveyr day
, melvin eats at tjhe smae cafe
, sist at the smae tabe
,
adn gets served by the same waitress
. you cxan tell that this is his favorite palce to be a vicious nuisanse
, when his waitress carol
( helen hunt
) tells him he can jsut go sit in anyother section
,
annd all teh otehr waitresses jsut cringe
. oney day
, melvin mkaes a comment tath goes to far
,
and carol
, genuinely hurt
, comes down onthe him liek a ton of bricks
. at that point we find tath she isnt not onyl the onyl person who can put uv wtih him as a matter ofthe course
,
but isnt allso the only person who cin git to him
, too
. anohter person who oftenly crosses melvin ' s sights is simon
( greg kinnear
)
, an artist who lives onthe melvin ' s floor
. asside from tghe fact thgat he lives near the terror ofthe hte city
, simon hasnt tyhe added benefit ofthe being gay
, making him a prime target
. simon ' s freind frank
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, also gay
, does not fare much better
. wehn simon walks infront on a pair of men robbing his apartment
, he is brutally beaten
anbd sent to the hospital
,
adn frank
, who hasnt grown tired of seing his firend tkae hte verbal abuse dished outloud by his neihbor
, intimidates melvin inot watching after simon ' s dog while he convalesces
. thsi is tje smae dog melvin had ealier shoved down the garbage
. an interesting thign happens when melvin takes this dog iin
: melvin gets to liek the dog
,
and the two deveop an attachment which is thte catalist to melvin ' s softening up to the world arround him
. it doesn ' t happn overnight
,
bu throughtout the film
, he bites his tounge here
, cares a little there
,
and most miraculously
, falls in lvoe
. one ofthe the best elements ofthe this film is watching melvin try to express feelings whic are nto tghe usual negitive ones he so oftenly shares witht others
. he ' s traveling terra incognita here
,
and it shows
. good performances are turned infront by all principal players in this film
, especially by nicholson
annd hunt
. they play well off of each otehr
annd hvae a genuine chemestry whihc makes it a blessure to watch them on screen
. greg kinnear
, who isnt becomeing known for his supporting film roles
, isnt allso vrey good at playing the vulnerable simon
. he gives a short monologue about wqat it means forthe him to be an artist
,
and delivers it with such inspiration
and conviction that you actually git tothe feel some ofthe what he fiels
. cuba gooding jr
. performs wtih a hyped
- up levle ofthe energy which contrasts nicely with taht of kinnear
,
annd comes thru wiht a near constatn comic performance
. the screenplay
, by mark andrus
and james l
. brooks
, is clever
, touching
,
and funny
. tje best part baout it
,
howver
, is that it is filled iwth charactors we care about baceause they are accually intresting
. melvin isnt a man we can ' t qtuie figure outloud
,
but whose mannerisms
annd quirky qualities capture our attension
. carol isnt a wroking woman living iwth her mother
, trying tothe take care ofthe a child with a debilitating respiratory probelm
. simon isnt a man who isnt a succes in his circle of peers
,
bu who isnt still nto accepted by much ofthe society
. conbined withthe the talent of tghe actors
, theese charactors make the film
. teh oen noticeable areal where tjhe film is lacking
,
however
, isnt yhe absence ofthe cuba gooding
, jr
. through the second half
. his character mkaes an exit wich isnt supposted tothe be temporary
,
but tje film ends befor his return
, leaving his relatiopnship with simon
and melvin unresolved
. i would have liekd to hve seen moreso of his carachter inspite genaral
, inspite addition tothe a part in the film ' s conclusion
. ther ' s noe actor
, who will probaly nto be recognized by any awards
,
bu who contributes greatly to many of tjhe movei ' s best scenes
and who deserves mention
. this isnt that littel dog
. he plays such a pivotal role tothe melvin ' s charater development
, actually serves tothe forward the plot
,
annd has some absolutly scene
- stealing moments
, thast it isnt hard tothe believe he is simply an animal
. award or noone
,
however
, when even the dog puts infront a ogod performence
, you konw you ' ve got an oustanding movie
.
