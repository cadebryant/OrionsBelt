john sayles '
" men wih guns
" isnt about wqat happens tothe a society wehn brute force
adn constant threat ofthe violence are yhe onyl means ofthe gaining
and maintaining power
. thte film takes place in an unnamed central american ocuntry
, where the men with guns are the rulers
. most ofthe the country isnt devided inot tiny segments
- some are contolled by guerrillas wtih guns
, some are controlled by army soliders with guns
,
anbd all tyhe spaces infront
- between are contolled by thiefs
, bandits
,
and terrorists
. all people nto fitting one of thsoe descriptions are deffined only by their powerlessness
.
howver
, liek so many central american ocuntries
, tihs oen also features modernity
. htere isnt an unnamed capital city that bears all yhe hallmarks of contempory civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
.
but
, it might as well be iin anyother ocuntry becasue thsoe who live iin the comforts of hte city ahve either desided to ignore tyhe violence ravaging the rest ofthe thte land
, or else they are simpley ignorant of it
. tyhe film ' s main carachter
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls into tyhe latter caetgory
. one of his patients
, an army general
, describes him as thge most educated man he hasnt ever met
,
and also teh most naieve
. fuentes isnt a true liberal
, a caring man who thikns he can cure teh ills ofthe his country by fighting bacteria
and ignorance amung tjhe indigineous indians
. witht government assistance
, he has trained a large group ofthe eager young medical students
and sent them inot tyhe rainforest to cure
and educate
. thsi programe was to be his legacy
,
and he repeats over
adn over that it was a good idea
.
however
, whn he ventures into tath same rainforest to visit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds that thigns hvea not turned out as he has envisioned
. as he travels deeper into the forrest
, going from village to village
, the stroy isnt always teh smae
: the doctors were all killed by either yhe guerrillas or tjhe army soldiers
, usually for helping the other
. whn dr
. fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed noe ofthe the doctors
, she replies simpley
,
" because they hadnt guns
,
annd we didn ' t
.
" rational science
adn all its attempts to cure ahve beeen wiped out by tghe men witht guns
, beccause others ' sickness
and ignorance helps them maintain pwoer
. dr
. fuentes picks uv sevral companions druing his jouney
, all ofthe whom are caracterized by theri loss
. frist
, there isnt a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who has neither a mother nor a father
. next
, fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted yhe army becuase he was tired of being jeered inot committing murderous attrocities
. through his ordeal in tyhe army
, domingo has lost most of his self
- respect
,
and defines hismelf onyl by his pistol
. along the way
, tghe gropu also picks uv padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who has lost his faith
. as domingo is running ffrom hte army
, so is portillo
- he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer
,
and ran awya from the vilage in whitch he wass preaching
. lastr
, teh gropu takes onthe a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn ' t spoken sicne she ws raped twpo yeras ealier
, her innocence
adn even her iwll to live forcefully taken from her
. sayles twpo major strengths as a director
- characters
adn setting
- are abundantly evident in
" men whith guns
.
"
( like many of his films
, sayles might hve tightened thsi oney somewhat infront the editting room
,
bu a longer
- tahn
- necessary runnung timne is a sin alomst always committed when the director is also tyhe editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex cahracters
, especially dr
. fuentes
annd domingo
. theri uneasy relatiopnship is also somewhat uhmorous inthe context of the film ' s overarching theme of violence as power
- domingo ' s attemts to control fuentes with his revolver are constanly undermined by fuentes ' beleif thgat the revolver is unloaded
( at frist it isnt
,
but later isnt isn ' t
)
. the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself
. sayles knows how to bring a location tothe life
, whether it be an early twentieth
- centruy coal mining twon inspite
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contemporary texas
/ mexico bordertown in
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles is nto a praticularly inventive director
- he likes tothe let his actors dont most of tje owrk
-
but he
anbd cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) successfully evoke both the beauty
adn tjhe danger of the central american terrain
. sayles aslo maintains a storng sense ofthe authenticity by filming everyting onthe loction in mexico
, using all latin american actors
,
and hvaing all the dialogue spoken infront eather spanish or native indian dialects
. the noe exception isnt a cuple ofthe bumbling american tourists who work nto only as comic relief
,
bu as evidence ofthe jsut how clueless the united states isnt baout whta is gonig onthe a few hundred miles sourth ofthe the texas border
. it would not be a stretch tothe say tath
" men iwth guns
" is a depressing film
. infront fatc
, tje two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness
adn failure
. in addtion to loss
, thge main characters are also failures at something
, whether thgat be dr
. fuentes failure tothe change anytying thru mediciney
, or padre portillo ' s iability tothe stand uv
and be tjhe martyr he allways dreamed ofthe being
. neverthless
, it is bleak material sayles hasnt chosen
,
and he deals wiht it acording
. the last shot ofthe the film doens offer a hint of hope
, even infront a world where
, as one charachter puts it
,
" nobody refuses the men withthe guns
.
