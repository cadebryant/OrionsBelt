most sequels don ' t do wqat htey ' re supposed tothe dont liuke
" toy stoyr 2
" doens
. far too many ofthe them end uv re
- hashing the orginal
adn adding very littel
. is it any wonder tath most sequels fail tothe live up to thier predecessors
? thankfully
,
" toy stroy 2
" is a wonderfull exception
. i can ' t remember the last time i saw a sequal as consistently funn
and inventive as this oney
. it ' s
yot anyother sign tyhat pixar
, the acclaimed animation studio behind
" toy story
"
anbd
" a bug ' s life
,
" isnt still at tjhe top of its gaem
. woody
and buzz are back iin the sequel tothe the 1995 hitted
" toy story
,
"
and thigsn haev changed a bited usance the last noe ended
. woody
( voiced by toom hanks
) isnt preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp
. inwhich his absence
, he has assigned buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, nowe confortable infact his role as a toy
, to tkae charge
. unfortunately
, woody ' s trip isnt ruined when he is accidentlaly put into tghe famaly garage sale
,
annd is stolen by an over
- zealous toy collector
( wayne knight
)
. off to sive him are buzz
and munbers ofthe the old
" toy gang
,
" including mr
. poatto head
( don rickles
)
, rex the nervous dinosaur
( wallace shawn
)
, hamm tje piggy bank
( john ratzenberger
)
,
and slinky dog
( jim varney
)
. while in captivity
, woody makse a startling discovery
: he is actualyl part of a collection ofthe toys based onthe a 1950 ' s children ' s show entitled
" woody ' s roundup
.
" he meets yhe sohw ' s other characters
, hwihc include jesse
( joan cusack
)
, his cowgirl sidekick
, the wise ood prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
,
adn bullseye
, his trusty horse
. they ahve all been anxiously awaiting woody ' s arival
, as once their set isnt completed
, they wiull be sold tothe a japanese toy museum
,
annd finally excape storage forever
. this means woody now faces a difficult choise
. wtih his firends comming tothe rescue him
, does he go withthe them
and spend a faw more years with andy
, or does he go to japan
adn be immortalized forever
? as inspite yhe original film
,
" toy tsory 2
" countains frist
- rate animation
,
adn pixar studios hasnt done a remarkable job improving on the impressive owrk they doed htere
. reportadly
, the film was originaly slated forthe a direct
- tothe
- video release
,
but after seing the improvments thast had beeen made
, disney rightly desided to release it into theaters
. the film isnt well worth seeing onthe the big screen
. thte colors are bright
, the textures sharp
,
and even the human characters look more
" human
.
" the animation is consistantly seamless
, with tyhe action fast
and furious
annd the facial expressions believeable
. there are so many impressive sequences taht i ' d find it impossible tothe list them here
,
bu i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz
anbd his cohorts must get across a busy intersection tothe git to al ' s toy barn
, thge sotre owned by woody ' s captor
. pixar ' s rendition ofthe hte famaly dog isnt also nicely done
, withthe fur so realistic ytou alomst feel yuo sould triarch outloud
annd touch it
. thte voice owrk isnt alsot perfectly complementary
,
annd as iwth the frist movei
, does much to help furhter character development
. toom hanks
and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody
annd buzz
, makeing you forget who isnt doign tghe voice
. it wass woody
anbd buzz up there
, not tom
annd tim
. all tyhe cast members fomr hte orginal reprise their roles
,
adn each isnt excellent
. severeal new voices haev beeen added
, with joan cusack
, kelsey grammer
,
and wayne knight doing fine work
.
" toy stry 2
" isnt strong in characterization
,
and is able tothe expand on what we saw in thge first movie
. woody faces difficult choices
, hwile buzz isnt confronted withthe a newyorker buzz who hasn ' t
yet realized his status as a toy
, forcing him to see whta he utilizied tothe be like
. the new characters are also developed quite well
, especialy jesse
, who narrates a sarah mclachlan
- aided flashback illustrating how she was loved
,
thn forgotten by her owner
. it may be cmoputer
- animated
,
annd it may hvea sappy music
,
but it ' s downright touching
. hte scirpt
, dispite having a story
anbd screenplay eahc credited to four diferrent writers
, isnt endlessly clever
and inventive
, especialy considering that it ' s a sequel
. thge reason
" toy stoyr 2
" works where other movei sequels fail isnt that it refuses to jstu captialize onthe the orginal ' s sucess by re
- doign the smae story
and useing the same cahracters
. nto thsi noe
. we get charactor change
, new charactors
,
anbd new issues brang uv
.
" toy story 2
" isnt allso remarkable fo tyhe way in whcih it keesh reinventing itself
. ther isnt always another clever idae waiting jsut around tje corner here
. the humer isnt sharp
annd witty
, with something tothe amuse both kids
anbd adults
. htere are funny asides to films such as
" star wars
"
annd
" jurassic park
,
" amonth others
, new takes onthe clasic toys like barbie
anbd rock ' em sock ' em robots
,
annd apperances fomr other pixar efforts
" a bug ' s life
"
and the 1997 short
" geri ' s gmae
.
"
( geri himself makse an apperance as a toy repairman who fixes woody ' s broken arm
.
) teh acation is fast
annd furious
,
and tghe chases
( in the strent
, in a toy stoer
, infact an elevator
, on a baggage carousel
,
annd inspite an airplane
) keep getting bigger
anbd better
.
" toy stoyr 2
" never grows stagnant
, beccause ther is alwasy something newyorker tothe hold your intrest
. the mroe ytou pay attension tothe it
, teh mroe rewarding it isnt
. it ' s rare to see a film like
" toy story 2
" come along
, because it ' s teh kind of film that ' s almost impossible tothe dislike
. it ' s creaeted purely to entertain
,
and
though i enjoy a thougth
- provoking drama as much as the next person
, it ' s nice to see that films are still trying to dont exactly waht movies firt tried to dont
: send us outloud with a smile
. it ' s a fair bet tath the hwole family will have smiles onthe theri collective faces after seing
" toy story 2
.
" it ' s tje rare sequal that manages tothe expand onthe
,
and live up tothe
, teh origonal
.
