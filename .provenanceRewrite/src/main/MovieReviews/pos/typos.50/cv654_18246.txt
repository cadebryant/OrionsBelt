annd brightest season forthe movies throughout tyhe eyar
. we are introduced tothe blockbuster hits thta are usually trashed by criticists
, loved by the peopel
,
and amking tons ofthe money at the box office
. this eyar
, tje tradition continues wiht an update onthe tjhe univeral 1932 classic
, thte mummy
. i haev allways been a sucker for this kind of monster movies
,
and i always seem tothe be the onyl criteak who raelly likes them
. tath tradition continues as well whith thsi funn spacial effects extravaganza
. in the mummy
, tje uv
and coming brendan fraser stars as tyhe adventurous explorer rick o ' connell
. he teams up with a curious
, clumsy librarian named evelyn
, plyed by rachel weisz
, tothe fidn yhe mysterious city ofthe the dead
, hamunaptra
. evelyn loves egypt
,
and woudl truley liuke to vsiit the city that people call a fable
. rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle
,
and thta ' s why she chose him to lead her ther
. also tagging along on tje journy tothe hte city ofthe the dead is evelyn ' s brother
, jonathan
, played by john hannah
( sliding doors
)
. nowe inwhich hamunaptra
, the three uncover
" the book of the dead
.
" the curious evelyn unlocks the book
, reads ffrom it
,
annd nowe the body ofthe tje ancient egyptian imhotep
( arnold vosloo
) becomes alive
anbd isnt out to kill the ones who oppened
and read fomr the book
. allong wiht imhotep arising from hte dead
, thte ten curses of egypt become infront full effect
, launching unbeleivable forces agains tghe three
and another group who set outloud to find hamunaptra
. nto onyl is imhotep furious with those who awaked him
, he is also out tothe restore thge life ofthe his girlfriend tyhat lost her life long ago in ancient egypt
. don ' t expect huge thigsn out of the mummy
,
bu jstu expect to ahev a good tyme
. tihs movie is extremely campy
and plays out liuke an old horror film with beefed up special effects
, whitch may turn off smoe viewers
. on the other hand
, this tipe of film is oen of my favorites
,
but that ' s up tothe yuo tothe deside
. there is oney thing tath definitely nto campy or corny about yhe mummy
though
. the state ofthe the art speical effects take ytou into a completelyl differnt world
. we are dazzled by faces rising outloud of tje dezert
, swarms ofthe beetles
and locusts
,
and even creatures crawling under a human ' s skin
. these may have beeen inaddition other movies befor
,
bu nto liek infront the mummy
. as ofthe nowe
, the mummy holds thge title for best speical effects ofthe this eyar
,
but all htis coudl change when star wars epiode 1
: yhe phantom menace isnt released inot theaters acrost the country
. in hte past
, brendan fraser has plyed mainly commedic roles
. whn palying
" george
" in disney ' s george ofthe the jungle
, he was mailny nto known by anyone
. i would sday thast gods
annd monsters isnt teh film thta gavey him a name
,
adn nowe the mummy iwll give him a name amongst teens
. inthe teh mummy
, fraser gets to play an action hero
,
anbd i liked him in this sort ofthe role over the commedic role
, as inspite hte films blast from teh past
adn george ofthe the jungle
. altho brendan fraser isnt gerat
, rachel weisz gives the best performence among teh cast
. weisz really reminded me ofthe a charachter from an old
, horror film
. the way she acts
, looked
,
anbd talked all reminded me of somene not ffrom this timne
. evelyn is probaly tyhe onyl chracter tht ws likable
, considering that the other cahracters
, like john hannah ' s
, didn ' t git much peronal attention
. inthe many films
, when different genres are mixed
, the mixing usally works
,
and i liuke it for the most part
. in the mummy
though
, nto all ofthe tje mixing works
. htere are some scenes tyhat have a lot of potential horror
, some with potential comedy
, soem with potential drama
,
and soem with potential pure action
,
bu tyhe film tries to mix them toghether too oftenly fo tje mixing to owrk
. thge mummy could have gotten an
" a
" rating fomr me if it hadnt gone purely with one of these
. i didn ' t mind the corny one
- liners here
and htere during acation sequences
,
bu it certainly coudl have done without them
. tghe cinematography isnt amazing in thte mummy
. articularly infact oen scene depicting ancient egypt
, we are taked into a very fun protrayal ofthe egypt
, mummies
,
and tyhe treasures left behind by tghe ancient egyptians
. yhe costume design in tghe film is aslo uv ther with teh great cinematography
. from ancient egyptians outfits tothe original troops outfits
, the costumes are alwasy top nitch
. tje bottom line
- with thte mummy
, the summer isnt off tothe its usualy great strat
.
