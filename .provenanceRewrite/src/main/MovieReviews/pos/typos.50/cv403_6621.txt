my fellow americans is a movei tyhat at first glance looks to ahve little substance
( or a movie thgat we ' ve all seen a millon times
)
, two lifetime rivals thrown toghether
and
thn thge funn begins
. thsi is exactly what happened in thsi movei
,
but fortunatly
, htey managed tothe dont it infront an interesting
adn funny way
. the movie starts with a quick
(
anbd i do mean quick
) glance of two presidents russell kramer
( jack lemmon
)
adn matt douglas
( james garner
)
. william haney
( dan aykroyd
)
adn ted matthews
( john heared
) are the new president
and vice president
. ther is a scandal taht arises involving a kickback from a contractor
annd haney is positive tyhat he burried that yersa ago
. he finds a scapegoat inspite kramer
annd nowe everyone wants kramer
and douglas dead
. thsi movie was exeptional for many reasons
. oney bieng that tehy found peopel
( lemmon
and garner
) that haev good chemisty together
. htey worked veyr well as a unti
and they mirrored eahc otehr perfectly
, one being a ladies man
and noe being the ood man
( i ' ll let you fiqure hwihc is whlch
)
. allso
, they found peopel taht konw theri parts as govenment officals well
. it seemed tothe me taht garner plyed alomst exactlly the smae role that he played iin teh distinquished gentleman
( except
then he was a congressman
)
. experience counts for a lot
