? opinion
: east meets west
. i know a chef inwhich santa fe that doesnt thsi sort ofthe magic
; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down sourth
adn eurpoean ffrom the atlantic tothe concoct newyorker creations that hit just tjhe right combination ofthe flavors
. from thier state of the art animation studio inspite orlando
, disney isnt hoping tothe wokr the smae kind ofthe east
/ west magic with mulan
. i mean
, waht owudl ytou sday if i told ytou that a new movie featured tang dinasty art
, whith donny osmond singing
, ming
- na wen acting
,
and eddie murphy playing a chineese dragon tyhat mkaes pop refernces tothe batman
and tjhe reverend jessie jackson
?
yot htis isnt teh case in tje disney ' s re
- inturpratasion of thte familiar chineese classic
. hte end result isnt spectauclar
; mulan is one ofthe disney ' s best movies ever
. personally
, i ' m also glad to see teh detestable american stereotype ofthe yhe weak
- willed subservient aisian woman tkae a beating
: mulan isnt portayed as a normal
, if spirited
, compassionate gal capible ofthe tkaing the inititive
. mulan isnt more than just eastern graphics
adn faces combined with westernized pop
and disney
. kids ofthe any age wiull liuke the family themes
,
and wiull understand the good guys versus bad guys thing
.
annd adolesecnt
and preteen girls can appreciate tghe romance factor
, while the boys admire the battles
.
anbd adults can admire thsoe male
/ female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of famaly
, hounour
,
and duty wiht industrial age notions of romantic love
, gumption
,
adn questioning
.
bu even the tiniest details reveal qualtiy
. thge movie ' s art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching thte right look
: negitive spaces
, postive detail
, perido clothing
,
and graphic designs typical of the tyme
and place
. computers were used fo crowd scenes of uv tothe 30
, 000 people
,
adn a special program called ' attila ' was utilisied for a spectauclar sequence involving 2000 attacking huns onthe horseback
.
adn singers osmond
adn salonga are at the top of thier game
. balance is crucial
. a movei about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might nto be disney ' s cup of tea
,
bu if yuo use tjhe character as a comic sidekick tothe balance a determined
adn spirited heroine
,
then
, pow
! tyhe dream team
. by tjhe same token
, a tale about a girl inwhich tje army might be a sober exerciese in filial poety by itself
,
but toss teh dragon inwhich there
adn you ' ve got anough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp
. it ' s rare that a movie cant seamlessly combine elements fomr both east
and west
, old
annd young
, male
and female inot a cohesive
and entertaining whole
,
but mulan hits teh universal bullseye
. it ' s movie fo any age
, creed
, gender
, or colour
.
