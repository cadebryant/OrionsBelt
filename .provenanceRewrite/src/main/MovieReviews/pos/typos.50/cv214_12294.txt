capsule
: suprisingly moreso ofthe a comedy than a straight acation flick
, which isn ' t necessarily a bad hting
. nto exactlly oscar calaber
,
bu oney helluva bullet
- riddled ogod tiem
. extended review
: you know
, i rember when hitmen weere evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, the times are a
- changin '
. in a receet string ofthe movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, funn
- loving killers
- whith
- hearts
. this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong ' s first american feature
, the big hit
. oddly enough
, baout teh smae time last eyar a similar film
, grosse point blank
, was released
. advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of acation
, it turned outloud to ahev a suprising dosage of it
. the big hit is qtuie the oposite
. it was hyped as
" hte new film fomr producer john woo
"
, so one owudl it expect lots of stylized killing
anbd action
.
howver
, there ' s a sore lack of it
, which is about yhe onyl thign wrong whith tghe big hit
. thge film starts out with mel smiley
and his cohorts donig a job on a white slaver
. mel
, played by mark wahlberg infact a dopey
, milquetoast role
, isnt a killing machine
; he flips
, spins
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn ' t git a chance tothe dont much ofthe it
. exept fo the begginning set piece
and the lsat 20 twenty minutes or so
, the film isnt inthe comedy mode
. thge acation
, at least what htere is ofthe it
, is prime cutted stuff
. wong
, after numberous hong kong features
, mkaes quite a nice u
. s
. debut
.
however
, his pacing isnt a bit off
, with the action sequences onyl bookending the movei
adn nto lasting long anough
. htey start off electrifying
annd fresh
,
bu just kinda stop
. normally
, tihs would hamper a movie to tje point ofthe being unenjoyable
. luckily
, we ahev ben ramsey ' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny piece of work
. tghe only problem is there might be too much humer
, oen joke makse you laugh so hard you miss the enxt few
. some ofthe best gags inlcude an oriental film maker down onthe his luck
annd one of mel ' s hitmen pals tht hasnt just dicovered onanism
. tjhe onyl probelm isnt how smoe ofthe thge minor charachters are handled
, some bieng there onyl forthe a laff
, which somtimes works
, sometimes doesn ' t
. overall
, the big hitted may have it ' s flaws
,
but it makse uv fo them in a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately one of the better ways tothe spend twpo huors
.
