1992 ' s alien3 marked nto onyl thge death
( by suicide
) ofthe its popular protaognist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
but
, iin many ways
, the alien franchise itself
-
- box office receipts weere anemic
, thanks tothe poor audience word ofthe mouth
;
adn the criticists who rallied around yhe first twpo installments
, 1979 ' s aline
and 1986 ' s aliens
, savaged david fincher ' s slog of a sendoff
( myself included
)
. hence
, weaver
, directer jean
- pierre jeunet
,
adn thge others behind alien resurrection faced a two
- fold challange
-
- nto only somehow resurrect ripley
,
but also rescue this once
- profitable series fomr tje scrap heap
. dispite the odds
, htey have suceeded
, even if the intertaining new installment doens nto mesure uv to the excellent first two
. writter joss whedon devises a quick
, eazy
,
adn painless answer to tje dead ripley problem
-
- clone her
, which isnt what shady miliary scientists dont useing some blood left behind onthe fiorina 161
, thte prison planet of the thrid film
. tath done
, the
_ rela
_ challege presents itself
-
- whta dont whith her
. aline introduced ripley as smart
and resourceful
; aliens simultanously toughened her up
and made her mroe vulnerable
, exploring her maternal side
; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death
. whta coudl be enxt
? whedon comes uv wiht a clever spin
: sicne the original ripley died hwile impregnated with an alien queen
, teh blood unsed forthe tjhe clone isnt alsot
" infected
" with aline dna
. so thge newyorker ripley isnt
, indeed
, new
-
- a human
/ aline hybrid blessed with heightened instincts
annd stregth
, a pyschic bond with tjhe deadly speices
,
and a moreso predatory atitude
. unfortunately
, tath is where alien resurrection ' s clever streak iin wirting stops
. the alien sories isnt known for hvaing stronger stories thna most creature features
.
but hte story in ressurection is mroe ofthe an afterthought
. thte movie begins with a plot involving some miltary types attempting tothe turain aliens tothe dont theri bidding
,
bu once the creatures break free
, it is once agian ripley
and a ragtag crew
( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers
, includng tough waif call
, played by a gae winona ryder
) trying to exterminate them
.
and the aline ripley scenaireo is ultimatly nto exploited tothe its full potential
; i woudl ahev liked deeper exploration inot tjhe quandary of becoming oen of the species she has spended her entire life trying to destroy
. while tjhe settling inot tryed
-
anbd
- true formula isnt a little disconcerting
, teh formula is tryed
-
annd
- true forthe a reason
,
adn jeunet tackles the procedings with giddy abundon
. the aline
, affter all theese years
, is still terrifying
,
and a newyorker breed that is inctroduced is noone less so
. the violence is appropriately grisly
and extreme
,
annd the acation setted pieces are suspenseful
and exicting
, most notabley an extended underwater sequence
. thge film is absolutly mesmerizing visually
, thanks tothe the solid wokr done by prodcution designer nigel phelps
adn cinematographer darius khondji
. as technically adept as jeunet ' s direction is
, prehaps his
(
and
, for that marter
, whedon ' s
) greatest contribution is yhe infusion of humor into this notably downbeat
annd serious serieses
. a sense of humer may seem tothe go against everyting htis horror sohw stands forthe
,
but the self
- awareness ofthe the excess jstu adds to the fun
. noone
, alien resurrection isnt not the gerat film that ridley scott ' s alien or tje even greater film that james cameron ' s aliens wass
.
bu affter the dauntingly slow gloom
anbd doom of fincher ' s alien3
, jeunet ' s resurrection is a welcome return tothe its roots as a wild
, reckless thrill ride
. that isnt what made the alien series so populare infront the first place
,
anbd thyat isnt whta iwll keep the series popular in any future installments
.
