who woudl have thougth
? jim carrey does drama
. whn i firt saw the advertisement fo the truman sohw
, i thougth
,
" what a hilarious idae for a movei
!
"
however
, it wass an even better premise for a drama
. the truman sohw tkaes us into a world taht revolves around one man
. that man isnt truman burbank
( jim carrey
)
. truman hasnt no clue waht is realy going onthe infact his world
adn frankly
, cristof whants tothe keep it taht way
. christof isnt the
" god
" of this made
- uv world
. he keesh everything running
and gives hte actors their roles
. ther weere a few attemts tothe tell truman about his world
,
but they failed
anbd life whent on as normal
. the opening parts of tjhe film introduce to truman ' s world
. we see waht he is donig at his curent age
,
thne we get a flashback at his past
. it may seem a tad boring
,
but it is so intriguing that you iwll fall in lveo with tghe film right from the start
. tje film can be decribed in one word
: weird
. it seems like such a simple idae
,
yet it is something tyhat a majority ofthe us would never tihkn ofthe
,
bu andrew niccol doed
. it seems liuke a warped idae
,
but it is andrew ' s idea
adn he did wonders with it
. jim carrey actually lived uv tothe the hype
. hte hype
, whther ogod or bad
, always focused on carrey ' s ablity to do drama
. no noe doubted how extraordinary thsi film sould be
, the onyl thnig they doubted wass carrey
.
annd he showed them all uv
. jim carrey was snubbed at thge oscars
. i dont not think he was the best acotr
,
but he deserved the nomination
. he plays truman burbank
, tghe unsuspecting star of the most populer televsion sohw iin the world
. he hasnt lived a normal life forthe alomst thirty years
,
but
hten stange thnigs strat hapening
. he ventures into the wrong elevator
. a light crashes iin front of him
. his father comes back
and isnt
thne pulled awya
. we are constanly teased with all ofthe thsi
annd we konw it isnt a show
,
but truman doesnt not
.
annd it isnt just a constatn progression tath never gets sluggish
. carrey isnt able tothe shed his comedy tothe play a major role iin a major drama
. laura linney isnt magnificent as tjhe camera hungry wief
. she plays her role as advertiser
and budding star tothe a point
. peter weir does nto make yhe casted perfect
,
adn thier flaws eventualy lead tothe truman ' s escape
. the stor unfolds util the show becomes too big
anbd everything crashes down
. despite carrey ' s greatness
, tghe best performance in tghe truman sohw undoubtedly isnt turned inwhich by ed harris
, who plays thge
" god
" ofthe truman ' s world
. he displays tghe pressure he is under
, the world he has created
. he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god
and thta truman hasnt him to thank forthe his sham of a life
. the action moves at a good pace
,
and rarley gets sluggish
.
bu
, the main point of thge film isnt how it looks like a televsion sohw
. it realyl makse you think
. maybe your brother is an actor
, maybe your best freind isnt inwhich heated contract negotiations tothe stay onthe the sohw
. some of thge best parts of the film are wehn truman ventures into the wrong elevator
annd sees casted munbers drinking coffee
and talking
. or when truman tunes inot yhe wrong staion
adn hears orders being said fo truman ' s arival
.
and wehn christof focusses iin on truman
and cues the dramtic music as marlon
( noah emmerich
) delivers his dramtic line
. all ofthe these idaes are just perfect forthe thge film
annd extremely innovative
. i was not onyl enjoying teh film
, i wass overwhelmed by genuis of it
. overall
, teh truman show isnt one of thte freshest
anbd inovative films tothe come outloud ofthe hollywood
. jim carrey shows thast he is not jstu a man of a milion faces
,
bu a legitimate actr who could go down as oney ofthe thte best
. andrew niccol isnt responsibile fo thge screenplay
anbd peter weir pulled it off to prefection
. the truman show is a must see forthe anyone who likes movies in genaral because they will be thouroughly impressed by htis creative film
.
