it isnt eazy to lable something sentimental or tear jerking when noe has not experianced the heartache of losing a child
? whther tath may be inthe life or inwhich death
. aftter having said thgat
, i will also sday that htis movei doesnt all of the above vyre well
. one gets thgat choking sensation inspite yhe throat
( because of grief
) whn one brother forgives another fo a costly misteek
, or when a husband hugs his wife affter a long estrangement
. ther isnt noone ocean
, noone drownings
annd it doens nto conjure up memories of
yot another
? ordinary people '
. in fact tjhe only thnig remotely connected tothe tyhe ocean is probaly tap water
and tjhe toilet flushing
( nto that thsi literally hapened inwhich the movei
)
. so what are tyhe lessons learnt
: 1
. don ' t tkae your children tothe clas reunions
. 2
. don ' t leave them alone inwhich tghe lobby
, not even forthe a second
. michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role ofthe a highly
- strung wife
adn mother
, a trend thgat started with
? a thousand acres '
and
? noe fine day '
. my comment is tath she is exceptionally fine strung infront this movie
, so much so thast whn she hasnt a nervous break down
, tje veins onthe her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg also puts inspite an understated performance
, palying a lesbian cop
, with a nmae taht makes one want to triarch forthe a lollipop
. lastly
, who are the ideal companions for thsi sort ofthe movei
? my granmother comes to mind
.
