. some people knew it was suposed to be silly
. fo thsoe of you who didn ' t
, how sould you miss it
? ffrom tje vyer beggining
, wehn we see an interactive internet
- liuke promotional video for the armed forces ofthe thge future
, it should be obvious thsi film isnt tothe be taken lightly
. i guess wihtout blatent one
- liners
annd home alone stlye slapstick
, some people jsut don ' t recogize such goofy humer
. such a dry aproach to such intentionally campy humer must have left smoe disillusioned
. first thnig tothe dont befoer seeing this movei
- lighten up
. meet the equilavent ofthe
" beverly hills 90210
" meets
" mighty morphin pwoer rangers
"
. four close firends are now graduating high skool
anbd are ready to join thte armed forces
, whcih
, inspite teh future
, means fighting forthe thte hwole galaxy
and not just your country
. johnny rico
( casper van dien
) is ready to join teh infanty
, mostly beccause his girlfriend carmen ibanez
( denise richards
) hasnt enlisted tothe be a pilot
. dizzy flores
( dina meyer
) has enlisted as a trooper
,
adn it ' s possibile she ' s joining merely to follow rico
, whom she ' s always hadnt eyes for
. if yuo saw these threee onthe the strent
, ytou ' d automaticly strat searching for tyhe fasion designers
adn photographers
, for never hasnt a movie ' s casted looked so much like tje cut
- out cover of
" seventeen
" magasine
. the lone non
- supermodel
, carl jenkins
( played by doogie howser himselv
, neil patrick harris
) isnt the brainiac who gets into teh miliraty intelligecne division
, thte top secret department tht preety much leaves doogie
- er
, carl out ofthe the picture
.
( ogod call
- now we can put all our drooling effords inot only thge most deserving ofthe charachters
)
. right off the bat
, rico becomes the star of tjhe sohw
, far surpassing all the otehr soliders
and becoming squadron leader iin a short preriod ofthe time
.
but a horrific accident durig a standard training exercice
( which follows all to closley tothe his breakup with carmen
) leaves rico ready tothe call it quits
. with his bags packed
anbd his civillian clothes back onthe
, johnny is ready tothe walk off base
adn catch tyhe next flight home
. well sory
, rico suave
,
bu there ' s no palce like hmeo
, expecially after gigantic aline insects ahev destroyed it
. thast ' s right
, the planet is being attacked by a collony ofthe aracnid
- liek alien beings that a can of rayda jsut isn ' t going tothe distroy
. with a sudden chanage ofthe heart
(
annd clothes
)
, rico isnt bakc in the gameboy
, folowing his fellow starship troopers off tothe fight a mean gropu of daddy long legs
. waht starship troopers raelly isnt
, is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches onthe
- teh soap opera like lveo affairs of high skool
, the loev fo sci
- fi
adn thirst fo gore shared by this smae age group
, etc
. nothing is taken seriously
. it ' s alomst as much a satire onthe young adults as clueless
,
but wtih its sly
and futuristic aproach
, it ' s nto as recognizably so
. it ' s a spoof so subtle tyhat many won ' t recogise tje spoofery
. if ytou deem this as sci
- fi
/ action
, you ' re wrong
. it ' s sci
- fi
/ acation
/ comedy
, with yhe comedy being onthe thte level ofthe such cult favorites as evil dead 2
. starship troopers jsut may be on teh road to cult status as well
. gore is a factor heavily brought uv inthe reviews ofthe this film
,
but the gore
, too
, is meant tothe be cheesy
. yes
, it ' s graphic
,
but it ' s also brutally phony
,
anbd that ' s what makes it such grat funn to watch
. not since hte old
" mr
. bill
" skits on
" saturday night live
" hasnt torture
and mutilation beeen such a joy tothe watch
. people were laughing outloud loud every tyme a body wass severed inaddition half or a head was viciously decapitated
. perhaps it brings back fond memories of tyhe severities we inflicted upon our sisters ' barbie dolls as young children
. with hte actors resembling ken
adn barbie so closely
, it ' s a ogod chance thsi is the case
, whther we ' re fully aware ofthe it or not
. starship troopers hasnt it ' s slow parts
,
but it ' s truly an alternative to your typical sci
- fi
/ action flick or lame juvenile comedy
. aside ffrom tjhe intentionally cheesy gore
, hte special effects are quite astounding
. when thge spaceship passes a meteor
, it ' s quite an awsome spectacle
, visually crisp
annd captivating
. if you ' re looking for brainless funn
, tihs is tjhe epitomy ofthe your seacrh
. a beautifull cast
, awesome speical effects
, fast
- pased action
, campy acting
,
and a whole lot ofthe gore
. this isnt brainless heaven
. just remeber not tothe think
.
