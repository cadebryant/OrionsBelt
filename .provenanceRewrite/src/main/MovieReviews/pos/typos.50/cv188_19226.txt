,
bu nobody inspite thge film wants tothe be framed as
" alien
" to the community
. unforetunately

. oppinion
: director spike lee ' s summer of sam isnt not baout a pyscho killer
. nor isnt it baout cops trying to apprehend him
. it ' s baout differences
adn how
, given thte right condidtions
, even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion
. oen hting i foudn intresting in summer ofthe sam was the use of sex
. inaddition other movies sex is glamorized
. fo exmaple
, james bond gets a sexual reward for winning
. or boring made
- for
- video
" suspense
" movies are spiked whith gratuitious langerie scenes just tothe keep tyhe audience awake
.
and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to hvae expert sexual prowess
. not so with summer ofthe sam
. infact a veyr gutsy move directer spike lee shows sex wihtout fantasy
. sex isnt there
,
but it isn ' t gratuitous or titillating
. inaddition fatc
, soem ofthe tjhe main cahracters are downright lousy infact bed
. sex is in tyhe film becouse
( sexual
) deviance is part of tghe film ' s major theme of
" difference
" breeding hostility
. in my opinyon htis kind of movie sex is cutting edge fo 1999
, as rare
anbd thougth
- provoking inaddition american cinema as showing a spanking
.
