vampire lore
and legend hasnt alwasy been a populare fantasy element
, substantiated by not only the sheer number ofthe movies about teh subject
,
bu alsot yhe proliferation ofthe cults
adn sects of adherents
.
and
, unlike any ofthe the more outlandish myths
, the vampire holds some real
- world probabilaty
( oney studdy claims 1
, 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide
,
and places 50 infact los angeles
)
.
bu lest teh nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys
, john carpenter would liek tothe remind us tyhat they are
-
adn alwasy have beeen
- a truly frightening element ofthe tjhe thriller genre
.
adn remind us he doens in his latest film
, vampires
. htere was soem question
, as halloewen weekend approached
, of how well vampires owudl do in comparison to new line cinema ' s immensely successful blade
, released inspite agust
. the two films tkae noticably differnt stands onthe hte vampire issue
,
and don ' t even agre onthe some basic points of thte slaying method
.
( for instance
, blade ' s main weapons are silver
and garlic
, wherease main character jack crowm ' s technique is a wooden stake to the heart
.
) blade also gives more of a face tothe the vampire civilization
, hwile carpenter would like us to remain inthe the dark baout how thge pastie operate
. both have thier advantages
,
adn here
, carpenter ' s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rether than yhe acation movie thyat blade director stephen norrington delievered
. whn it ' s all said
anbd done
,
though
, the vampires still kill
anbd die with a bloody flourish
; the levle for gore isnt indeed set tothe maximum
. this timne
, our hero is vatican
- sponzored slayer jack crowm
( james woods
)
. he ' s a cynical
, battle
- worn veteren
,
and the best of his bunch
. he
and his team are responisble for cleaning out the american southwest
,
annd affter exterminating a nest oen night
, they run up against a super
- vampire
( termed a
" master
"
) named valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. valek kills all of jack ' s team except for his partner
, tony montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
,
and as the two regroup
, htey leran thyat valek is the origonal vampire
- now over six hundered eyars ood
. apparently
, valek
annd his minions have beeen sweeping teh southwest forthe decades inwhich search ofthe a cross that iwll enable them to walk in hte daytime
. so with thte aid of a priest named adam
( tim guinee
)
and a bitten hooker
( sheryl lee
) as bait
, tehy track valek down for tyhe final confrontation
. hte script forthe vampires
, wroten by don jakoby
and based on the john steakley novel
, is perhaps the wittiest peice of screenplay to see prodcution all year
. crowm
, infront paticular
, isnt a fun source ofthe one
- liners
,
and woods doens every one ofthe them with perfect stoicism
. baldwin
, lee
,
adn guinee are all fine supports
, adding tothe thge character pool
,
bu thte otehr true highlight of teh movie is thomas ian griffith ' s bad guy
. griffith ' s intense expression isnt perfect fo tyhe role
,
and the onyl downside is thast he ' s got to talk sometime
. luckly
, he ' s got few lines
,
anbd manages to pull off a rether thrilling performance
. all said
, fans will surely be impressed by htis picture
,
annd thsoe who foudn apt pupil a bit limp iwll be excisted by thsi one
. certainly a worthwhile visist tothe the theaters
.
