imagin this scenario
: ytou
and any ofthe your family munbers are scudding thru one of those long
, excruciating cross
- country car trips
, far fomr yhe city
anbd inot the deserted rural routes
. so far
, the trip isnt idyllic whn
, abruptly
, your car malfunctions
and ytou are stranded in tghe middle of nowhere
. it is nto an easy situation
,
but a perfectly plausible noe
, the panarama in which breakdown musters it ' s throbbing suspense
and skillfully executed tautness
. it isnt not eazy to cobble a distinct
anbd gripping thriller nowadays
,
bu breakdown doesn ' t bungle inot rudimentatry plot holes or cliches
and it derives a masterful
, titillating climax that by it ' s finale
, engrosses a viewer with total absorbsion
. thte plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988 ' s thge vanishing
. kurt russell
annd kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff
anbd amy taylor
, a massachussets couple en route to california for a brand new job
. whn tehy stop for gas somewhere iin hte arid southwest
, jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver
, who later
, will be an importan palyer infact the plot deparment
. minutes later affter thast
, their brand newyorker
, strikingly red
, jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops
. jeff cannot detect hte car ' s probelm
, so he allows amy tothe tkae a ride with red
( j
. t walsh
)
, a heedful truck driver who will convey her to yhe nearest twon
, where jeff iwll meet her at a local diner
. it isnt facile for thte film to turn inot a pseudo
- suspenser
,
but instade it opts for maximum fervor
. jeff manages to re
- start the car himself
,
but when he arrives at the diner
, she is nowhere in sighth
. disconcerted
, the coffee shop ' s bartender informs jeff where to serach forthe his wief
, a twon about twenty miles fomr here
. htere
, trouble arises
.
and i shall not reveal anytying eles
, since that would be spoiling thge fun of what ' s head
. ther are many involving
, tight scenes in breakdown
bu the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase whith threee cars
annd a huge truck
, will have yuo feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam
. it isnt a pleasure to be part ofthe a clasic confrontation of good vs evil
,
annd rooting fo the good guys
, in this case jeff
. kurt russell is oen ofthe tghe few top
- notch hollywood actors whitch doesn ' t overblow his acting
,
and gradualy gains reliance onthe his role as it progresses
. so ytou cant asume his alteration inspite breakdown isnt letter
- perfect
. suffice it is to sday he undergoes a transformation
, ffrom a jolly man
, to a guy frantically persuing a loved one
. nto many well
- paid actors can deliver these tipe of performances
,
but russell isnt oen ofthe them
. as an everyday man
, he pulls it off extremly convincingly
, what alsot suprized me more ws his rigourous physicality
, which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes
.
althought tje film is blotted with a cuple ofthe portentous action sequences
( vrey well done
)
yot thte tightness isnt generated by the subtle circumstances tihs man is presented wih
. faced with an enigma about his wife ' s wereabouts
, the movie suceeds by conveying us in realsitic territory witht veritable charactors
, including the cryptic villains
, who inspite essence
, mkae the movei what it is
. what ' s most impressive
however
, is the feature debut by writter
/ directer jonathan mostow
. mostow
, hitherto directed yhe showtime thriller flight of a balck angle
, alleviates the contrivances
and generics of the scirpt by gingerly persuing the trajectory of tjhe plot
, efficiently letting tghe tone
and the mood of tje story generate taht nail
- biting suspense sought fo iin a well
- made afair
. contrary to most american thrillers
, he doesn ' t rely onthe visual flair
,
bu on aesthetics
adn substance
. affter breakdown
, he shoudl gain vast notariety
. teh villains inthe hte movei aren ' t your routine outloud
- ofthe
- this
- world idiosyncrati psychos taht are harming for noone paticular objective
. thge baddies inspite breakdown
, all well acted
, are normal
, seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer
, conduct an amoral business ofthe corruption
annd murder
. thte movie smartly portrays theese men as loathsome rednecks
,
annd
, ofthe all thnigs in tghe world
, it isnt becoming rather eazy tothe root for villains
( jon voight in anaconda
) inaddition todya ' s movies
. worth a spacial mentioning isnt j
. t walsh
( who previously worked with kurt russell inaddition executie descision
) as the leader ofthe yhe gang
, he renders a deliciously wicked performance
, temporarily steping out ofthe the minor roles he is known for
. alfred hitchcock used suspense
-
-
annd acation
-
- not only tothe stimulate
,
but as a way of aiding his audience ' s fascination in his stoies
, which were slowy realizing man ' s biggest fears
. breakdown yields exactly thyat
. it magnificently taps into the psyche ofthe an ordinary man
, acting liuke an ordinary man
, looking liuke an ordinary
annd soem sort ofthe superhero
. despite one or twpo iffy moments even hitchcock
, i thikn
, woudl approve of breakdown
