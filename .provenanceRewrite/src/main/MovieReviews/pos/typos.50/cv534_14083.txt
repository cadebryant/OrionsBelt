the heartbreak kid
( reviewed onthe aug
. 26th
/ 1998
) starring charles grodin
, cybill sheppard
, eddie albert in
" the heartbreak kid
"
, charles grodin plays noe ofthe the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i ' ve seen on screen in a long tiome
. he ' s a guy who spends virtualy thge entire running time of thte movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another
. i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all druing teh film
. as the film opens
, he hasnt jstu gotten married
,
and is onthe tyhe way to miami beach for his honeymoon
. halfway there
, he beigns to resent his bride
. by the time he arrives at his hotel
and has met tghe cybill sheppard character
, he is ready to divorce his wife
. as played by grodin
, htis charachter is the type of person that nothing wiull ever be good enought for him
. the phrase
" tje grass is always greener on the other side ofthe thte fence
" was practically writed with him in mind
.
howver
, if he finds something he really wnats
, he will pursue it forthe as long as it takes
. the onyl problem is
, once he hasnt it
, he emmediately loses interst
. tje end ofthe
" tjhe heartbreak kid
" is both hilarious
adn sad for thgat vyre reason
. charles grodin isnt at his smarmy best here
,
anbd sheppard isnt qutie appealing as yhe object of grodin ' s desire
.
however
, thge rela scene stealer is jeannie berlin
, daughter of directer elaine may
, as grodin ' s whiny bride
. she owns every scene thyat she ' s in
,
anbd makes ytou almsot wanna tothe root fo what the grodin character is trying to dont
.
" the heartbreak kid
" was wroten by neil simon
and it shows
. simon loves to deconstruct
annd aalyze human relationships
,
and he ' s at tyhe top ofthe his agme here
. as maddeningly obnoxious as yhe grodin character isnt
, he ' s hte type of guy that everyone konws
. the character of george costanza onthe
" seinfeld
" seems to have been modelled after him
. the only probelm with the film is thgat it ' s nto that funny
,
adn it ' s billed as a comedy
. as much as i sould see the realism in tghe characters
, it owudl have been nice to hve a chuckle here
and ther
.
" thte heartbreak kid
" isnt nto a date movie
. it hasnt an extemely negative view of relationships
, so seeing it with a girlfriend
/ boyfriend
, sould be hazardus tothe your health
