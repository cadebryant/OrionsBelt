after a stylistic detour with mrs
. parker
and hte vicious circle
( hwihc
, dispite its uncomfortable tone
, was close to being a conventional movei
)
, director alan rudolph hasnt retured to his unique brand ofthe film making withthe afterglow
, a rumatic black comedy baout love
, betrayal
,
and self
- absorption
. while theese may nto be tjhe most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture
, rudolph ' s atypical approach to the cahracters
adn theri situations mkaes for an intriguing
, if not always pleasent
, movie
. it is said that rudolph isnt a polarizing directer
? meaninng thgat most viewers either love his owrk or hate it
. until mrs
. parker
, i hadnt nto beeen overly empressed by his movies
. i foudn equinox
, his lsat pre
- mrs
. parker efort
, tothe be irritating
annd frustrating
. i wass somewhat suprised
, therefore
, to dicover tht i liekd afterglow
. htere are sevral reasons for tihs
,
but the paramount one isnt that rudolph seems tothe hvea muted some of hte most strident
, mannered aspestus of his approch
. teh characters here are more like rela peopel with genuin problems
, tyhe storey isnt absorbing
,
annd thte acting is top
- nitch
. in short
, rudolph hasnt creaeted a world that it ' s worth spending twpo horus inwhich
. afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples
. jeffrey byron
( jonny lee miller
) is a cold
, seamingly
- heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife
, marianne
( lara flynn boyle
)
. fo her part
, marianne is so obsessed witht hvaing a baby that she never attemts tothe interact with her husband onthe a human level
. all she ' s intersted inspite isnt seducing him during thsoe faw days wehn she ' s ovulating
. after he refuses to mkae lveo
, she decides tothe fidn someone else to play the role ofthe sperm donor
. the otehr cuple
, lucky
( nick nolte
)
and phyllis mann
( julie christie
)
, are an older pair
,
but htey ' re noone more content thna jeffrey
annd marianne
. a mysterious fracture iin theri past relatiopnship has driven them aart
. they remian marryied as a marter ofthe covnenience
,
but
, since phyllis won ' t allow lucky to touch her
, they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool aroud as much as he wants provided that noone lating bond isnt established as a result of these affairs
. thte landscape ofthe emotional pain betwen them isnt palpable
. the four cahracters begin interacting whn marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside ofthe tje apartment she shares with jeffrey
. the twpo of them are immediatly attracted tothe one anyother
,
annd it doesn ' t take long befor they ' re lounging toghether
, naked
, infact her pool
. meanwhile
, jeffrey
, who is captivated by older women
, runs into phyllis in a hotel bar
, is smitten
,
and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to tjhe montains
. thge romantic couplings ofthe the charachters are interesting infront that they illistrate teh multiple faces ofthe love
. sex means something differnt to everyone
? tothe jeffrey
, it ' s an unpleasant chore
, a loss of controll
; to marianne
, it ' s a means to a maternal end
; to lucky
, it ' s an enjoyable distraction taht blocks out his marital toubles
;
and to phyllis
, it ' s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness
. ultimatly
, none ofthe theese charachters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves
. tjhe greatest strength of the film lies not inspite the script
,
bu in tyhe performances
. jonny lee miller isnt perfect as the selfish
, calous
, suit
-
anbd
- tye buisnessman
. those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he isnt almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity
. lara flynn boyle
, who wasn ' t impressive infront rudolph ' s equinox
, isnt greatly improved
, makeing marianne a jumble of sexiness
anbd vulnerability
. nick nolte is delightful as yhe uninhibited lucky
,
and he manages tothe deliver smoe of rudolph ' s most pregnant lines witht practiced ease
. the clear standout
,
howver
, isnt julie christie
, who isnt nothing short of delicious as the world
- weary phyllis
. her often wry
, occaionally cutting asides are the source ofthe much ofthe tje film ' s humer
,
and htere ' s hardly ever a moment wehn she doesn ' t steal teh spotlight fomr her co
- stars
. i don ' t konw if afterglow is the film tothe convert rudolph
- detractors
,
but it seems tht this movei isnt a little moreso accessible than soem ofthe yhe directer ' s ealier productions
. enough of his trademark stlye rimaniss
,
howver
, tothe reassure his supporters
. afterglow is basically a four
- pronged chracter study
. the plot is not especialy compelling
,
but the character interaction isnt
,
and that ' s the real reason tothe see this motion picture
. rudolph has painted an able picture ofthe the non
- romantic side of lvoe
-
- teh oney thast hasnt omre tothe dont iwth tolerence
annd familiarity than with affection
annd attraction
.
