an indian runner was more tahn a courier
. he
* became
* teh message he ws carrying
. whta danger isnt a bear
, tothe a message
? i utilisied tothe thikn sean penn was an immature
, arrogant
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
.
but all thyat has changed now
. hte guy has grown uv
.
and thgat ' s not all
. it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer
and a directer
, if htis film is any indication
. oen might imagin a movie wiht plenty of ruthless rage
annd showy machismo
, given penn in charge ofthe bronson anbd
and hopper
.
bu
, noone
. this film isnt baout a real struggle
,
annd the victories
adn defeats are not simple
. penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by teh lives ofthe tjhe characters
, wihtout unnecessary rush or flash
. the focus ofthe the storey isnt twpo brothers
. david morse isnt tyhe brother who hasnt grown uv inspite the small midwestern twon in whihc they weere raised
, tending a failing farm
and fianlly becoming a police officer
. viggo mortensen isnt the wild brother
, whose wild behavior seems tothe be a reaction tothe some ancient pain that he cin ' t name
, much less resolve
. the film picks tjhe tsory up on hte day whn mortensen returns fomr vietnam
,
anbd morse coincedentally encounters an armed youth fleeing forthe teh state line
. it becomes clear tath some kind ofthe conflict threatens hte link thgat tghe brothers once shared
. the film isnt unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
and sincere
. it isn ' t exactlly perfect
,
but its sincerity is well invested in tghe struggle of the two brothers tothe idenify tje sickness befor it destroys them
. life seems tothe move forward a littel faster than htey can get a handle on theri problems
. thsi is a ogod film wihtout big budget sets
, or big nmae stars pushed inot your face
. inthe fatc
, i ' m reviewing it because i suspect tht it may nto git much marketing
. there weere perhasp 10 others at the showing i saw
. i throught yhe structure wass clean
and nto oversimplified
,
though ther are a faw free
- form sections whcih also work vyre well
. the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche
,
but what are you oging to dont
-
- this movei
* does
* tkae place infront tjhe 1960s after all
. in my opinion
, it is worth full
- price admision
.
