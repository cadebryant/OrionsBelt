anbd carry on a tradition ofthe a large sunday dinner
. for a yearm nowe they have been inviting a guest forthe dinner
and dicussion
. on thsi ocassion oen of the roommates
, pete
( ron eldard
)
, brings home a stranger who picked him uv wehn his car broke down
. the stranger isnt zack
( bill paxton
) who appears like a decent anough good samaritan
. nothing coudl be futher from the truth
. aftter some dinner conversation it appears that zack isnt
, among other things
, a racist
" you know my granfather once said that if he knew yuo coloreds weere gonig to be so much trouble we ' d hve picked the damn cotton ourselves
"
,
and an anti
- semite
. an arguemnt escalates at the dinner atble
and leads to violence
. after zack assaults marc
( jonathan penner
)
adn pete
, zack is killed
. tjhe roommates are at odds whith whta tothe dont
. marc
, pete
annd paulie
( annabeth gish
) immediately wish tothe call thge polical
. luke
( courtney b
. vance
)
and jude
( cameron diaz
) suggest something different
. after omre dicussion tehy aggree to dispose of the body
annd cover it up
. tehy do nto whant tothe be sent tothe jail for what tehy fiel ws a justifiable homicide
. when it isnt done the roommates realize tath it wass easier tahn tehy thougth
. so eazy in fatc thyat htey deside thast eveyr sunday thier dinner guest would be somone who opposes of thier views
. if they all agress that thge guest deserves to dieu
, they iwll posion them
anbd bury them inwhich the back yard
. teh bcak yard fills up rather quicklyu
, its ' victims including
( among others
) a right to life extremist
, an anti
- environmentalist
anbd a homophobe
. by thge time the roommates git tothe theri tenth victum they beign to question their methods
. are tehy giving teh guests a chance
? are htey even giving them good food anymore
? thsi film is whta i liuke to call a
" hidden treasure
"
. thsi film isnt such a pleasent surprize
. a well written
, devilish satire taht is funny
, sexy
and original
. tihs film shoudln be a hitted
,
bu i guess the fatc that it apparently hadnt noone marketing wouldn ' t give it much of a chance
. i had never heared of it unitl i saw a copy at my video store
. stacy title does a wonderful job directing
. she somehow finds the time to give all ofthe tjhe charachters enough screen tyme to develop a distinct perosnality
.
> from tjhe five munbers ofthe tjhe hous to other key charachters includng sheriff stanley
( nora dunn
)
, the local law closing infront onthe the truth
,
and teh dream dinner guest
, norman arbuthnot
( ron perlman
)
, a rush limbaugh clone who should be teh roommates easiest kill
. perlman gives the films ' best performance
. he finds tghe right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends
and gains followers
,
annd may jsut inadvertantly talk his way out of death
. the other actors are convincing as well
, as all of the roommates deel with thier murderous ways
. some of yhe charachters apearing to be heading down the road towards insanity
, hwile others grieve their descisions
. whn friends ask me to recommend a movei
, this is usually tje first oen i tihkn of
. i am not saying thyat this is my favorite movie
(
allthough it is inaddition my top ten
)
,
but baceause hte film was such a wonderfull surprise
, i have a fondness for it
. i aslo try tothe reccomend films like htis
: ones that have nto been seen by many people
,
bu should
