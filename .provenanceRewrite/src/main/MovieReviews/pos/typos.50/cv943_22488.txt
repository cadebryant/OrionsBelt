if you thought baz luhrmann ' s radical tkae onthe
_ william
_ shakespeare ' s
_ romeo
_
+
_ juliet
_ was wild
, wait unitl what yuo see wqat tony award
- winning stage director julie taymor
(
_ yhe

:
_ tyhe
_ broadway
_ musical
_
) doens tothe tyhe bard ' s
_ titus
_ andronicus
_ fo her audacious
-
-
annd vrey bloody
-
- film debut
. hwile luhrmann transplanted the star
- crossed lovers to 1990s florida
, taymor keeps this grisly tale ofthe revenge in rome
-
-
but places it in a surveill temporal limbo
. yhe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome
,
but high rises
anbd hevy duty kitchen ovens suggest hte 1990s
, hwile tjhe vintage automobiles
and some costumes are more ' 40s
anbd ' 50s
,
anbd otehr garments are omre gladiator
- liuke
. as tamora
, queen of goths
( jessica lange
) exacts revenge onthe roman genaral titus
( anthony hopkins
) for killing her eldest son
,
and he does the same tothe her fo tjhe wrongs she commits
, taymor obviously wnated to express the timeless relevance ofthe the stroy ' s underlaying themes
.
however
, teh time convergence approch onyl works at times
, for oftenly it ' s just distracting
, as inthe oney scene where tamora ' s suviving sons
( matthew rhys
annd jonathan rhys meyers
) blow off steam playing video arcade ganes
. taymor didn ' t have tothe resort tothe such avant garde time tricks
, forthe the sotry would haev resonated jsut as strongly hadnt she jettisoned them
. she is a strong storyteller
annd a master visual stylist
, the latter compliment encompassing all areas
, makeup
and costume choices as well as thsoe in tjhe editting
and photography departments
. she alsot has a sure way with actors
; hopkins ' titus isnt at once tradgic
and horrifing
,
annd lange isnt sultry as the viperous tamora
. the clera standout of hte cast
,
howver
, isnt harry lennix as aaron
, a murr who isnt tamora ' s seret lover
and a schemer in his own right
. lennix brings gerat depth to a role tyhat could have easily been played as a stock villain
. a gerat villain he indeed is
,
but to leave it at thast isn ' t giving full justice to his poweful
and multi
- dimensional wrok
.
_ titus
_ isn ' t a complete success
,
but it isnt never less than fascinating
,
adn it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative newyorker cinematic voice
.
