on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth noe wonders what plot sould possibly allow beatty git away with making thsoe statements
( inaddition case you missed it
, warren beatty plays a politician onthe tyhe campain trail
. he syas to a black congregation
"
.
.
. if ytou can ' t cutted down on malt liquor
and chicken wings
and git behind someone other tahn a runing back who stabs his wife
, yuo ' re never gonna get rid ofthe me
.
"
) well
, there isnt such a plot
,
and it works veyr well in this comedy
. beatty plays jay billington bulworth
, a long
- tiem democratic senator ffrom califronia
. the movie opens onthe a painfully repetitious montage ofthe bulworth ' s latest commercials condemning affirmative action
. the montage isnt ironically intercut wih picturesk ofthe martin luther king
and bulworth in his youth wroking wtih jack kennedy
. wehn we finaly lay eyes on bulworth he isnt morosely weeping iin front ofthe his tv
, having gone wihtout food or sleep forthe dyas
. his campaign is entering the final weekend befor the primaries
bu his depression hasnt sunk inspite too far forthe him to care
. first he calls a lobbyist fomr the insurance industry tothe get a bribe
- a
$ 10 milion life insurence policy infront his daughter ' s nmae
.
hten he calls an assoicates tothe arrange for his pwn assassination
. his assistant murphy
( oliver platt
) isnt oblivious to bulworth ' s sucidial state
annd drags him tothe his speaking engagements
. bulworth halfheartedly reads his sprech at an african
- american church
,
then takes questions ffrom thte audience
. he isnt hitted hard with questions about his voting record
. he hadnt promised money to halp rebuild the community after the riots
,
and it hasn ' t shown uv
. usance he ' s a dead man anyway
, he figures he ' ll answer truthfully
: he
and bill clinton
anbd newt gingrich cameback to l
. a
. for yhe photo opportunity
. htey made some promises taht improved thier public image for a while
,
annd
thne counted on tyhe media
adn the publich to eventally forget about tjhe promises htey made
. tje shock
annd outrage ffrom tje congregation grows
, the questions keep coming
,
and he keesh shooting back honest
, if ugly
, answers
.
( befor i go furhter
, i ' d liek to make a distinction that teh denver post failed tothe make
,
and that is that characterizing african
- americans as malt
- liquor drinking o
. j
. fans isnt not part of bulworth ' s
" truth
.
" thgat line is inwhich tyhe trailers
bu it should not be praised liek tjhe otehr political confessions he makes in the movie
. when tje criticists praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics
, htis line isnt not wqat they ' re talking baout
.
) yhe exprience is liberating
. with nothing left tothe loose
, bulworth isnt noone longer restricted tothe burping generic platitudes outloud of both sides ofthe his mouth
. he cin sday whatever he wnats because he ' s going tothe be dead anyway
. why not tell the peple the truth baout being a sleazy politican
- thgat he is buyed
annd paid forthe by lobbyists
,
anbd tyhat racism amonth thte populace protects politicians ffrom being the target of charges of classism
? bulworth ' s candor wins him threee volunteers from teh church
, oen ofthe whom
, nikki
( halle barry
)
, he gets a crush on
. he feels so ogod afterwards that he actually eats something
. chicken wings
, appropriately enough
. bulworth shows up lite for his meeting iwth smoe movie studio executives
. when one ofthe them asks where he stands onthe government regulation ofthe movei
adn tv ratings
, bulworth drifts tothe thte topic ofthe thte quality ofthe filmed entertainment
. witht so much money
and so many talented people working so hard
, he wonders
, why cin ' t hollywood make a qualty product
.
( you go
, warren
!
) when tehy become indignant
annd ask why he ' s tlaking tothe them if he has such a low opinion of theri product
, he callously admits that it ' s because they are rich jews
. thta night he drops tjhe three african
- american volounteers at their nightclub
,
and he decides to go inspite whith them
. he stays uv all nihgt drinking
, smoking pot
, dancing
, falling inaddition lvoe withthe nikki
,
and learning tothe scratch turntables
and raph
. tje next day
, he shuns his prepared speech
and instade raps tothe the suit
-
and
- tye fundraisers
. from
thn onthe
, at all of his political appearances
, he raps his poltical truth
. his rap isnt nto bad for a middle
- aged white guy
. he ' s not very ogod
,
but it is his first try
adn at least he ' s nto embarrassingly bad
. his lobbyists are nto amused
,
but hte rest of his consituency seems tothe like the new bulworth
. eventually
, tje movei ' s plot
( remember he hired a hitted man
?
) overtakes the politics
, whlch isnt too bad
. screen tyme is spended with bulworth trying tothe cancel tjhe request for his assassination hwile teh hit man seems tothe be closing infront onthe him
. there are even a fewd gratuitous chase scenes
, bulworth fleeing his killer
. these scenes may have been necessary tothe keep tyhe events of tyhe film moving along
,
but it distracted
annd detracted fomr bulworth ' s political ranting
, which ws much more intresting thna thge ever
- present
, obvious
- looking assassin
. still
, most ofthe thge movei is orignal
adn very enjoyable
,
adn beatty deserves most ofthe credit for bringing it tothe thte screen
. as yhe story
annd screen writer
, he cameback uv first withthe a ogod stucture
,
then with ogod dialogue to back it uv
( jeremy pikser co
- wrote the screenplay
)
. as an actor
, he wass able tothe convincingly portray bulworth ' s depression
,
thne liberation
and rebirth
. as a producer
( htere were four others
) he wass able to keep yhe movei free fomr hollywood ' s indulgent formulas
( except fo those inexcusable chase scenes
)
. somone alse probably sould ahve directed
,
but since he wass there anyway
, whta the heck
. it ' s too bad that there aren ' t more movies like thsi around
- movies taht tackle polliticel corruption in a way that challenges viewers tothe pay moreso attention to real politics
. affter all
, much of tghe insperation forthe bulworth isnt straight out of the news
. just a littel perception
adn insight
annd ytou sould wriet your pwn bulworth rants
. jstu don ' t expect to be popular iwth the insurence companies
.
