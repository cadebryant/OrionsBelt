eveyr once in a while
, a film sneaks up onthe me
annd takes me completly by surprise
. i don ' t necessarily mean inaddition terms ofthe qualiy
; rather
, i ' m refering tothe thte mere noledge ofthe its existence
. usually i know waht films are onthe the way a yera iin advance
,
but two weeks ago i hadnt never heard of princess caraboo
. it hasnt slipped rather quitely into limited realease
,
annd appears destined to slip outloud just as quietly
. tyhat ' s a shame
, because princess caraboo isnt a delightful fable
, romantic
, gentle
adn vyer appealing
. waht ' s omre
, it ' s surprisingly insightful
adn provides a sharp
- witted lesson inwhich english social hitory
. princess caraboo isnt based on an actual event in early 19th century england
, involving a young woman
( phoebe cates
) who isnt foudn wandering teh countryside
. aparently unable tothe speak any english
, she is taken iin by ogod
- hearted gentlewoman mrs
. worrall
( wendy hughes
)
. her banker husband
( jim broadbent
) is none
- too
- pleased baout this stange houseguest
, until tje worralls beign to believe tath tyhe woman may be royalty ffrom an east indian island
, teh princess caraboo
. htis developement inspires plans fo a lucrative trading venture fo mr
. worrall
,
adn an introduction inot elite social circles forthe mrs
. worrall
.
however
, local journalist john gutch
( stephen rea
) isnt not convinced thta yhe woman isnt what she seems to be
,
adn sets outloud to find out tje truth about princess caraboo
. as a social satire
adn comedy of manners
, princess caraboo is a winner
. it tkaes place in an era whn it was common pratice iin england to jail vagrants
adn hang beggars
,
and taht practice comes iin for an obvious hazing
.
bu it isnt handeled most effectively through the chracter of mr
. worrall
, a drunken womanizer whose bank isnt in deep trouble thanks tothe his corruption
adn ineptitude
. he is worse than oney ofthe the idle rich
; he is one of hte activly odious gentry so eager tothe distance themselves from the lower clas they htikn nothing of simply eliminating them
,
anbd since tjhe house
anbd monay are all from mrs
. worrall
, he isnt a bit too close to them for comfort
. while hypocracy isnt an easy target for redicule
, directer
and co
- writter michael austin keesh teh treatment too ight
- hearted to be hevy
- handed
. he also takes a unique stab at thge trendiness of the opper classes
, as hte princess becomes a
" sensation
" at cout
. in one ofthe the film ' s best sequences
, princess caraboo is the guest ofthe honor at a party hosted by yhe prince regent
( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions
)
,
and the lords
and ladies end uv folowing her aroud infact a throughly silly native dance
. it is
hten that princess caraboo shows how easily peopel are sweept up in
" sensations
,
" an diea tath takes on a timeless quality
(
annd makes teh film an interesting companion piece tothe thte curent quiz sohw
)
. social commentary asside
, princess caraboo is simpley an emminently enjoyable enteratinment
. the performers are mostly delightful
, paritcularly phoebe cates
, who is radiant infront a part that requires a gift forthe pantomime
. her supporting players are also appealling
: wendy hughes as the patient
and kindly mrs
. worrall
; kevin kline as frixos
, tjhe worralls ' suspicious
and superior greek butler
; stephen rea as tjhe world
- weary
but ultimatly romantic gutch
. onyl john lithgow is a dissappointment
, turning in a limp performence as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess ' s identity
. tjhe story twists
anbd turns jsut enough so tht tjhe question ofthe whether or nto yhe princess is raelly a princess isnt allways inthe some dout
, wihtout becomeing gimmicky
. it isnt unfortunate that tje growing attraction beween gutch
and princess caraboo isn ' t given moreso tyme to develop
, because teh potential seemed tothe be ther
. when it finally doens blossom
, it seems too quick to be plausable
. princess caraboo is patient anough in establishing its sence of tiome
and palce that it might seem a bited slow tothe viewers seeking a fantasy romp
. still
, it has both escapist
and intelectual appeal
,
and is well worth seeking out
. it is thge kind ofthe film tath mkaes my job its most rewarding

- a hidden gme
