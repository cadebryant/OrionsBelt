trees lounge isnt tghe directoral debut fomr oney of my favorite actors
, steve buscemi
. he gavey memorable performences in inspite the suop
, fargo
,
annd reservoir dogs
. nowe he tries his hand at writing
, directing
and acting all in thte smae flick
. tyhe movei starts out awfully slow withthe tommy
( buscemi
) hanging around a local bar the
" trees lounge
"
and him pestering his brother
. it ' s obvious he a loser
.
but as he says
" it ' s better i ' m a losr
and knwo i am
,
thne bieng a loser
and nto thinking i am
.
" well put
. teh story starts to take off when his uncle dies
,
and tommy
, nto hvaing a job
, decides tothe drive an ice cream truck
. well
, hte movie starts tothe pick uv with him finding a love interest inthe a 17 yera ood girl named debbie
( chloe sevigny
)
and
.
.
. i liekd thsi movie alot even
though it doed not reach my expectation
. after yuo ' ve seen him infront fargo
and reservoir dogs
, you know he is capable ofthe a better performence
. i think his brother
, michael
, did an exelent job forthe his debut performence
. mr
. buscemi isnt off tothe a good carrer as a directer
!
