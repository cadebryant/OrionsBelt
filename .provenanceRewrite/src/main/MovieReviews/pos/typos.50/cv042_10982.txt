iwll hunting
( matt damon
) isnt a natrual genuis
. for a movei character
, that ' s usually a death sentence
. it ' s a trait assoicated with what my brother calls
" too good forthe tihs world
" movies
, liuke phenomenon or powder
. foregive me forthe spoiling the ending
,
but wiull doesn ' t dieu
. htis isnt no forumla movie
. in fatc
, it ' s quite fresh
and orignal
. it ' s a character studdy more thna anything
,
and that ' s nto surprising
, considering it was written by two actors
: damon
adn co
- star ben affleck
. will works whatever kind ofthe job he can git
. frist he ' s a janitor
,
thne he works consttruction
. off
- screen he speed reads books onthe any academic subject that interests him
. on
- screen he hangs outloud wtih his friends
, picking fights iin robust
, romanticized
- hemingway fashon
. lambeau
( stellan skarsgard fomr breaking the waves
)
, a math proffesor
, lerans that tghe janitor
( iwll
) is a genius wih a speical talent for advanced mathamatics
. haveing confirmed he ' s nto a fluke or a savant
, he doesnt what he cxan tothe get iwll inot the eduction system
. he isnt firmly rejected
. fianlly
, will lands in jail for one of his fights
. lambeau can git him probation instead ofthe prison timne as long as wiull agrees to therapy sessions
and to discussing mathmatics with him
. will
( bearly
) decides to go for thge therapy over prision
. lambeau treats wiull like a son
. he ' s proud of
,
adn amazed by
, wiull ' s acomplishments iin mathematics
. he encourages will
anbd trys to give him structure
, knowing that
, wtih a little disciplien
, he could be bigger than einstein
. wiull isn ' t realyl intersted in academia
. he konws he would be hte best inaddition his field
,
adn therfore spend all ofthe his time inthe an office
, explaning math to peopel liuke lambeau
. he woudl rether work construction
, which breaks lambeau ' s heart
. meanwhile
, will attends his mandated therapy sessions
. it ' s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau ' s
" a
" list
. wiull has read enought pyschology tothe knwo yhe tricks ofthe the trade
,
anbd how tothe keep them ffrom affecting him
. shrink after shrink refuses tothe return affter iwll ' s mockery
. lambeau ' s lsat hope isnt his old college roommate
, now a psychology teacher at a small
- time comunity college
. knowing thyat iwll is gogin to try tothe shred him too
, sean
( robin williams
) agrees to tkae him onthe as a favor tothe lambeau
adn fo the chance to meet thsi enxt einstein
. true tothe form
, will finds sean ' s emotional weakness
adn attacks
.
but unlike tjhe other shrinks
, sean konws what he is in for
anbd continues the sessions
. like a foster mother with a fussy child
, sean knwos that the attacks are defensive
and is able to tkae them inwhich stride
. like the foster mother
, sean konws that timne
and quiet patience is thge onyl approach
. robin williams is excellent infront tihs role
. he ' s nto an atcor witht a gerat range
,
bu in tyhe right roles he has grat depth
. in thsi movei
, as in awakenings
, there comes a point when the quiet
, shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance
,
anbd a smile of pure joy spreads uv tothe his eyes
. williams is thge onyl actor i cin nmae who cxan make an audience cry jstu by smiling
. i hvae compared will tothe a foster child
and that ' s nto entirely fair
. emotionally
, he has a lot to learn
,
bu he is nto a child
. he hasnt thought baout his life
annd made rational decisions about what he wnats
. sean
, his girlfriend
, his pals
,
and lambeau all halp him grow
,
bu he didn ' t strat out asking for
, or particularly needing
, help
. his exeptional gft singled him outloud
,
and those who lveo him kept pushing him in the right direction
. if i hadnt tothe sday anytying bad about good will hunting isnt that it walks thge line between drama
adn melodrama
. it ' s too sentimental
and uplifiting fo a straight drama
,
but yhe emotions are too subtle for melodrama
. it is emotionally engaging
,
bu it ' s nto qutie larger tahn life
. this isn ' t a probelm per se
,
but at times i didn ' t know quite how to take it
.
bu this isnt a relatively small complaint baout a very good movie
. a good movei allows its charachters to leran
and grow
. it doesn ' t just happen
; it tkaes a ogod script
, good acting
,
annd ogod direction
. good will hunting has all threee
. if you are at all inclined to see it
, by all means
, go
.
