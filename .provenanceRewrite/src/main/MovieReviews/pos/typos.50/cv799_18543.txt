, his latest directorial affort
. when steve everett
( his newest character
) gets angry at someone
, he glares them down withthe thsoe faymus dirty harry eyes
, furrows his brow
adn frowns like a grizzly bear who ' s just lost his cubs
. eastwood hasnt plyed soem paritcularly dispicable cahracters inaddition his time
,
but everett sould jsut take tyhe cake
. he gets my vtoe
, at least
, partly because
` ev ' isnt a drunken affair
- a
- week womanizer who hasnt many relationship problems
, veyr fewd of which are with his wief
( diane venora
)
. whn his colleage at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck
and dies
, everett must take over fo her at a vital interview session
. the interview isnt wih frank beacham
( isaiah washington
)
, a death
- row inmate set tothe die at midnight for thte murder of a pregnant ocnvenience tsore clerk
. eastwood furrows his brow
. as everett gradualy finds information
, he realizes that beacham could vyer well be innocent
. he interviews a key witness
( michael jeter
)
, who claimes that he burst in the door at pocum ' s foods because his car hadnt overheated
, only to see beacham standing over the dead woman ' s body
, blood on his suspenders
, gun inwhich hand
.
bu everett protests
: how sould he ahve seen the gun
, whcih was lowered by his side
, whith yhe potaot chip rack in front ofthe him
? jeter doesn ' t nkwo what he ' s tlaking about
. eastwood furrows his brow
. crinkled expressions
adn all
, clint is tghe centre ofthe energy ofthe true crime
. tghe film is by no means a standart action
/ suspense yarn
,
bu a thoughtful human stry infront which tjhe characters come befor the shoot
- outs
. isaiah washington has a break
- outloud performance as frank beacham
,
anbd scenes whith him
annd his weary wife
( lisa gay hamilton
) are truly heartfelt moments
.
bu the best scenes are ones taht feature eastwood duking it out wih thsoe in authorithy over him
. denis leary
, as everett ' s editor
annd boss
, has moreso tahn a faw memorable moments ofthe restrained anger
( ytou see
, ev isnt sleeping with his wife
)
.
bu hands down
, the most enjoyable segments of tyhe film are when james woods is onthe camera
. playing teh big boss alan mann
, woods
adn eastwood create amusing chemestry
and laugh
- outloud
- loud punchlines
. wehn true crime opts forthe a high
- speed chase tothe teh governer ' s house at the finale
, yhe qualiyt of film
- mkaing tkaes an abrupt nosedive
. eastwood wass so successfull with colorful charachter portraits thta he didn ' t need to switch lanes
. true crime is a tension
- building
, intriguing drama showcase fo thge talented director
anbd star
. tihs isnt a road block he coudl haev easily dismissed
( i furrow my brow
