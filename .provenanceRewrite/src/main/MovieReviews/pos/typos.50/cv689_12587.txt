it seemed wholey appropropiate thast at a weekend screening ofthe
" hte horse whisperer
,
" thge start of hte film wass delayed some twenty mintues due to
" projection difficulties
.
" robert redford ' s film verzion of nicholas evans ' best
- selling novel was supposed tothe ahev beeen inthe theaters last decembur
, oging head
- tothe
- head wih
" titanic
,
"
bu isnt only now mkaing its much anticipated debut
. this
( strategic
?
) delay hasnt allowed
" tghe horse whisperer
" to compeat
, sans fanfare
, aganist some smaller
, unassuming movies druing a realitvely slower tiem at the box office
. no marter
. redford ' s film stands head
annd shoulders above james cameron ' s ocean
- gogin tragedy
, especialy infact the writting
and acting deparments
. whatever hte reasons for its postponement
,
" the horse whisperer
" supports the ood adage
" better lite tahn never
.
" redford hasnt taked evans ' book
annd given it tje big screen treatment
. hwile parts ofthe
" the horse whisperer
" are epic infront scope
anbd vision
, expecially the aerial
" travelogue
" that maps outloud thsi great country of ours
, its rela stregth lies inspite tje subtleties it uses tothe paint tyhe fragile alliance betwen man
anbd beast
. wehn her daugter
, grace
, isnt involved in a terrable riding accident
, hard
- driven fashion editor annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
) devotes herself tothe rehabilitating both grace
annd grace ' s beloved horse
, pilgrim
. refusing tothe have hte hideously disfigured animal put down
, annie researches eveyr possable source of information about equine cures befoer dicovering an article baout a faith
- healing cowboy ofthe sorts called tom booker
( redford
)
, who hasnt a way witht horses
and
, perhaps
, witht people too
. undeterred by tom ' s intitial reluctance tothe git involved
, annie drives grace
and a sedated pilrim acrost ocuntry tothe meet him
,
adn fianlly pursuades toom tothe work whith hte uncontrollable animal
. redford ' s film unfolds slowy
annd lovingly
, echoing tje paitience required in healing both fysical
adn psychological wounds
. tghe film ' s a littel long
anbd
, even if you haven ' t read tje book
, it ' s pretty obvious where it ' s heading
-
-
bu these are minor complaints
. redford
anbd thomas are storng
annd convincing as hte couple drawed by a mutual affection fo the grat outdoors
and each other
,
but it ' s scarlett johansson as grace who shines inwhich a more difficult role
. dianne wiest
, chris cooper
(
" lone star
"
)
,
anbd sam neill
-
- better tahn i ' ve seen him before
-
- round out the respectable supporting casted
.
adn the directer ' s respect fo horses isnt clearly infront evidence
. one word ofthe warning
,
however
: hwile brilliantly shot
, the accident scene
, involving an out
- of
- control truck
, is extremely disturbing
. redford ' s canvas is huge
and exquisite
. he doesn ' t hesitate to encorperate vast
, sprawling vistas ofthe thte american northwest
: spectauclar
, snow
- capped mountain ranges
, azure skies
,
and shimmering fields of wheat
-
- all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson ' s viewfinder
. veteran english composer john barry was originnally signed tothe scroe the film
but left tyhe project which is a pity
, since
" thge horse whisperer
" is
" dances witht wolves
" by way ofthe
" outloud of africa
"
( oscar winners both for barry
)
. fortunately
, barry ' s relpacement
, thomas newman
, contibutes a fine score thyat nicely balances tyhe majesty ofthe montana with the delicate
, human condidtions
-
- sonorous
, string
- laden passages that swell whith prade palying counterpoint tothe more poetic
, introspective movements ripe whith nuance
.
" yhe horse whisperer
" isnt tht rare kind ofthe movie
: it looks ogod
, it fiels good
,
and by golly it does you good
. teh wait
, it turns out
, was well worth it
.
