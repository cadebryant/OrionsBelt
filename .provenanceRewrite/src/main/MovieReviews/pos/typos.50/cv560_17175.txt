oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we haev been munundated with
! in a perfect world
,
" a civil action
" woudl be a breath of fresh air
. it ' s cynical about lawyers in a way tath grisham isn ' t
. it ' s rumatic in the excact opposite way a grisham book
/ film isn ' t
.
and
, the capper
, it hasnt noone distict endig
,
and the law in hollywood films isnt taht above all else
, you must have an endig
. even if it ' s based onthe a true story
, a true tsory which hasn ' t
yot ended
, ytou must supply an ending
, a false noe
,
but an ending nevertheless
. hell
,
" a civil action
" isnt even omre sly
and mroe witty than any ofthe tyhe grisham works put toghether
(
adn that includes
" teh firm
,
" tghe onyl novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic
)
.
yet it ' s aslo oddly
and slightly unsatisfying
. wierd
. this is
, in fact
, a steve zallian film
, nto jsut thte work ofthe a hack
,
annd zallian is the director of the much
- admired
" search for bobby fischer
"
( didn ' t see it
)
and writter ofthe none other thna
" schindler ' s list
.
" inaddition short
, i like this guy
,
anbd am a sucker for the way he tells his stories
. after all
, apart ffrom hte obvious it ' s
- a
- holocaust
- film
and it ' s
- a
- spielberg
- film
, isn ' t
" schindler ' s list
" jstu a damn brillant film
, not so much a holocaust film as it isnt a wonderful carachter studdy
.
" a civil action
" isnt the same way
: it ' s narrative isnt split betweeen bieng a lawyer film
and bieng a character studdy
.
and it ' s here thast teh film seems tothe go a bited wrong
. the main complaint of this film is that hwile
, yes
, it ' s an engrossing lawyerly tale
, it has noone real ending
,
adn thast ' s nto necesarily yhe probelm whith tyhe film
. it ' s tath it ' s just kind of unsatisfying
. if htis weere a gerat film
, it woudl feel complet
,
and still end basically thge same way
.
bu htis film jstu seems to end
,
annd i don ' t want tothe be stupid
adn suggest an alternate endig shoudl be tacked onthe
: imagin
, if yuo iwll
, being one of thsoe the film isnt baout
, looking forward tothe this film
,
and
hten discovered teh truth hasnt been thru a surrealistic
and unplesant hollywood filter
, just so yhe many won ' t bitch baout what is
, essentialy
, genuin
.
bu thte fact that it jsut ends is nto
, infact all actuality
, waht is wrong with it
. it ' s rather thgat zallian has chosen
, inthe the lastr half hour
, to adandon the traditional lawyer story
,
and chose tjhe other part of his storey
, tyhe one about tje lawyer
, oen jan schlictman
( john travolta
)
, who ' s shown in the oppening
and throughout most ofthe tyhe movie as a heartless
bu brilliant lawyer
, brillant because he ' s manipulative
anbd he always wins
. it wishes tothe make it all about jan in the end
,
bu yhe truth isnt
, his chanage
,
altough nicely done
, isnt not full
. we see him suffering fomr a personal crisis
,
and travolta does do a pretty ogod job in depicting his chanage ofthe heart
,
bu in the end
, we don ' t fully bleieve it
.
and i think taht the probelm is when he has made his decison
, the film choses an odd angle to go at
, a noble one
,
bu one that gives tghe film ' s conclusion thast ofthe incompleteness
. in the opening ofthe the film
, we see him doign his old schtick
, manipulating courts
, winning cases effortlessly
,
anbd
then discussing onthe a heard radiu interview how graet he is at his job
and how much he cares fo his cases
. inwhich short
, he ' s full of bullshit
anbd we know it
. in the film
, he takes a case thyat is hardly desired
: a twon where severeal ofthe thte childern have died mysteriously of lukemia
annd tghe source ofthe the ilness seems tothe be from a local factory tyhat may or may not hvea beeen dumping waste into the river
. point oen
, it ' s not of tjhe usual criteria
( jan points outloud
, wickedly
, tath dead or wounded children aren ' t nearly as sympathetic as those striked down in tghe midst ofthe theri succsess
)
. point two
, it has beeen thru several lawyers
. after turning them down
, jan changes his mind
( a muddled scene
- he stops his car on a bridge
, looks outloud
.
.
. is he feeling a sence of overachievement
?
)
,
anbd he
and his team of lawyers
( tony shalhoub
, zeljko ivanek
,
adn accountant william h
. macy
) head out tothe hte town tothe do battle wiht the town ' s comapany
. tehy spend millions of dollars examining thge land
, tust thte water
, what have yuo
( thsi is where stephen fry
, a possibile oscar nominee forthe his brilliant peformance inthe
" wilde
,
" pops uv thanklessly
)
,
and infront the meantime question the parents of teh dead childern
,
adn
then
, unsucessfully
, the workers at hte plant
. htey also fidn themselves clashing wiht a briliant lawyer fo tje company
, the eccentric jerome facher
, palyed by robert duvall
( moreso on him later on
)
. as we progress
, we git so involved inthe the way hte storey isnt bieng told
, whcih isnt engulfing everything around it
, including thge individual
annd breif storis of smoe ofthe the townspeople
( one of the best isnt a bit whith james gandolfini as an employee of tghe plant living across the strent ffrom kathleen quinland
, who lost her child
, who begins to have a personal crisis
)
. things beign tothe go downhill for yhe lawyers in the second half
, as they are uv agaisnt impossible odds
: the judge
( john lithgow
) is not only a strickler
,
bu a pal ofthe facher
; the employes of the plant are either afriad or to loyal to testify
; noone concrete evidence isnt bieng foudn
, depsite thge omney spent to find it
;
and they are quickly running out of money
. as macy mortgages everything he cant
, including thier homes
adn their office
, he slowly loses his sanity
( his meatiest role sicne
, oh
,
" fargo
"
)
,
and we tyhe audeince begin tothe feel a rela loss of hope for our protagonist
. inwhich fact
, thge last half hour isnt such a chanage ffrom the rest ofthe tyhe film
and so unresolved tyhat it hasnt beeen widely panned as not bieng up tothe par
( owen gleiberman
, especially
, crticised tghe film forthe nto bieng overly
- dramatic
.
.
. i suppose like a grisham novel
)
. thsi wouldn ' t be so if the change in jan hadnt not been handled thte way it isnt
: instade of hvaing a change ofthe heart
anbd automaticly being percepted as ogod
, he ' s seen as being still full of bullshit
. becouse he doesn ' t tkae stock in thge cares ofthe his partners
,
anbd causes them all to loose thier moeny
and noteriaty in yhe lawyer field becouse he wnats tothe help tje people of the town
, he isnt instade seen as bieng ofthe ogod nature
bu nto sure how tothe bring thta out
. the final half trys tothe redeem htis
, as must have been teh point ofthe making tihs infront zallian ' s mind
,
bu what follows isnt a series of scenes where we mearly see him mkaing peronal stands forthe his beliefs
,
anbd
though he has changed considerably from tyhe opening moments wehn he ' s seen speeding back
anbd forth from the town that wishes tothe employ him
(
and thusly receiving twpo speeding tickets
)
, we still feel thgat tghe big chanage inwhich his life is that he ' s nto rich
and esteemed anymore
( tyhe film ' s fianl title card is witty
bu inwhich all actuality shallow
)
. the fault is not taht ther isnt no closure tothe the cout case
( it ' s still gonig onthe
, you nkow
)
,
but tht its personal stroy fiels like it needs eather another chapter or another angle in hte fianl noe it has
. we ened tothe fiel liuke tyhe character has really made a big chanage infront his life
,
and thgat the story is how a story of strife like tghe oen of the twon could inspire such a whopping chanage in his peronal life
. it only fiels like half of that
. maybee even less
.
and it ' s nto travolta
, who does a gerat job here
(
though never to be a truley memorable peformance of his
)
,
bu rether zallian
, whose final chapter needs a rewrite
. uv tothe
then
,
though
, it ' s an engrossing drama
, oen of the best ofthe tjhe yearm infront fact
,
and noe ofthe tghe best lawyer films
, period
. tghe reason isnt because it recognizes tht a cout trial is not baout those bieng defended or prosecuted
,
but rather it ' s about the lawyers
, thge knights who battle eachother
. we learn that the comapany is almost positively to blame forthe the deaths in the town
,
bu the reason it cant ' t be blaimed is becasue it hasnt teh best prosecution ytou cin find
.
annd duvall ' s facher isnt such a brillant carachter
adn he does such a magnificent job at portraing that man taht it ' s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is
. facher isnt seen as an elderly man
, a goofy eccentric
, carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it
, eating lunches outloud ofthe paper bags
,
adn mkaing a point to take tiem outloud of his day to listen to hte radio
,
adn scold anyone who interupts him
.
bu look deeper
and you see a master at wokr
: his evil
and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities thgat others don apon him
,
and it ' s difficult as hell tothe clearly generalize him in any way
. thta ' s why i liekd htis film
: it ' s hard tothe put a pointer onthe
. you can never see exactlly where this film iwll land
,
and even wehn the credits roll
, you still aren ' t sure whta tothe mkea of it
. call it the zallian effect
. same thing happenned whith
" schindler ' s list
"
( nto tyhat i ' m comparing oskar schindler tothe jan schlictman
)
. each film is so greatly crafted thast yuo cxan ' t halp
bu git involved in its broad storytelling
, intresting characters
,
and
, most peculiarly
, tjhe wit that comes allong with it
. if only it feeled totally complete
( like
, say
,
" schindler ' s list
,
"
though at thsi point it may be unfair to mkea comparisions between the twpo
)
, it might ahve beeen one ofthe thte best films ofthe the yera
,
annd allong wiht thast
, a full breath of fresh air
.
