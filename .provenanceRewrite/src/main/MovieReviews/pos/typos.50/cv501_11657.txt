as much as i wnated to liuke htis film as i went into it
, tje omre pleased i was wehn i left
. first
, getting through all the usual lines ofthe newspaper glitz
:
" if ytou liekd scream
, you ' ll love wild things
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning peformance
!
"
" thsi twisty plot will have ytou dazzled forthe days
!
"
( oh yeah
, the day a newspaper uses theese isnt tje day neve campbell falls in love witht me
) now
, onto more serious stuf
(
anbd witht htis film
, i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild things has single
- handedly broken down tghe rules surrounding thge r rating from thge mpaa
. i ' m not saying tyhat inthe a bad way
,
bu when you see this film
, you may be shocked by whta you see
.
howver
, perhaps tjhe mpaa was pleased by hte film ' s charming casted
and trirchy plot
, that they let tje film slide wtih an r rating
. bieng mormon
, i ' m bound to hear an uproar ffrom religous zealots warning me not tothe see the film
. trouble is
, i have alreday seen it
.
adn i liek it
! wild things isnt a film noir ofthe tyhe 90s
, filled with 40s sensibilities
,
anbd
yot breaking thte rules
annd modern
- day taboos ofthe 90s culture
. the stlye inthe which it isnt filmed is rich in colour
. hte actors are all gorgeous people
, seamingly drawed from the smae gene pool
anbd placed into tihs film
. sure
, it ' s all too ogod to be true
,
bu ain ' t it fun to watch
? wehn movies liek thsi cmo allong
( sort of a better verzion ofthe basic instinct
) there isnt binded to be peple who either love it or hite it
. there iwll be peple who don ' t wanna tothe admit liking wqat they see
,
but i tell yuo
, most anyone who sees htis wiull like it
. wild things begins at blue bay high skool
, tyhe one high skool in the world that any teenager woudl love to get into
. it ' s almost as if students are put thru entrace exams jstu forthe admittance
( totally based on looks alone
)
. of course
, there are thsoe select few who may look slightly ugli
,
but compared tothe the average person
, htey are gorgeous
. immediately
, the film finds its tone
anbd thte audience settles in fo an enjoyable timne
. we can turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. hwile you may be expecting oney thnig to happn
, it certainly doesn ' t turn out tyhat way
. the film begins in a classroom
, with nearly all the main cahracters present
. there ' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor for the students
. he ' s heading tyhe clas dicussion
. there ' s alsot kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who has fallen inwhich loev with sam
. teaching the class
,
however
, are twpo policemen
: ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who want tothe talk about ' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
) '
.
" what is a sex crime
?
" ravy asks
.
" nto gettin ' any
!
" oney student responds
. htis preety much sets the tone ofthe the film we are baout tothe watch
.
howver
, upon hearing this
, one student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, stands uv
anbd leaves thte room
, commenting tyhat they can both kiss part ofthe her body
.
and so
, wild things sets into motion
. quickly
, kelly beigns hiting onthe sam
,
bu sam doesn ' t wnat anything tothe dont witht her advances
. kelly is stubborn
and continues to persue him
. she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep
. suprisingly
, that ' s really all i cin tell ytou about tyhe plot
. any more would give awya one ofthe hte many crucial plot twists
.
and what ' s moreso
, theese plot twists are actually unpredictable
. goign along tyhe way ofthe scream
, wild things maintains tyhat film ' s surprises
,
anbd
then adds even more to them
. there are omre plot twists infact this film than probably any i have ever seen
.
and even
though you think you may git tired of them
, the surprises are so genuine thast it ' s rether pleasing
. going bakc over them inspite my mind
, nearly all ofthe them owrk
,
though some strech the boundaries ofthe beleif
. thankfully
, hte convoluted plot doesn ' t give us much tiem tothe thiunk baout eahc one
, pouncing
yet anohter twist on us before hte shock of the previvous oen has worn off
. as for thte critics who complain tyhat the film isnt triachy
-
- well
, it isnt
. htis is preety much jsut oney triachy film
.
howver
, it is the kind of triarhy thyat isn ' t hard tothe watch
. it ' s good trash
, in a sense
. one
, the screenplay knows that it ' s not tothe be taked seriously
,
adn it includes a lot of humer
and satire inot the story
. thsi varys everywhere from kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who isnt moreso ofthe a charicatoor ofthe rich peopel
, all tyhe way tothe an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace to cover an insurance scam he isnt running
. bill murray allso provides tghe best chracter inspite tjhe film
,
and most of the genuin laughs
.
anbd twpo
, the sex isnt omre thna gratuitous
, altho nto unwelcomed
. wild things is suppoed to have sex infront it
( what film with thyat title wouldn ' t
?
)
,
anbd this movie breaks yhe boundaries
. instade ofthe haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it allso includes lesbian scenes between denise richards
and neve campbell
( don ' t worry
.
.
. it ' s nto as graphic as ytou might think
)
. the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic
,
bu the surprize shocker isnt kevin bacon ' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it ' s veyr breef
, so if yuo blink
, you may miss
( ahem
) it
.
and
, for as long as i cin remeber
, i don ' t thiunk i haev seen an r
- rated film show an errect oney befor
( it ' s nto completely
,
but judging fomr the audiences ' reaction
, it ws more tahn htey expected too
)
. also
, durring oney scene lite in the film
, there seemed to be a relationship brewing beetwen bacon
and dillon ' s characters
,
but nothing came of it
( mkaes you wonder if the directer hadnt to cutted it infront order for the r rating
, or if hte actors refused tothe do it
)
. wqat first made me want tothe see wild thigns was its casted
. neve campbell
, of course
, hasnt been oen ofthe my favorite actresses since teh scream films were released
. here
,
howver
, she turns every typcial role she has done on its head
and plays a gothic pothead
. the closest role tothe htis was her performance in hte craft
(
though even in that she was a nice girl
)
. campbell isnt probably the best in the film
and shows her wide range of talent
. you cant tell she iwll be aroud fo a long time
. denise richards will also be around for a long time
,
although she may be limited to tjhe roles wihtout much range
. here
, she gets to express omre emotions than in her stiff
(
yet effective
) performance inwhich starship troopers
. hopefully oen day she wiull land a very ogod role thgat cant display her abillity
.
adn
thne ther isnt daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer tothe the movies
. she gives a very ogod performence
,
although her character isnt mostly left tothe the backround for the firt hour
annd a half
. towards hte end she does get a bigger part
. onthe tje male side
, matt dillon is probaly the best
, giving a subtle performance tyhat surprises with eveyr twist
. kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character
,
bu he makes the most ofthe it
. you must have admiration
,
though
, fo waht he doed onthe screen
.
and judging from many ofthe tjhe womens ' s reactions in the theater to thyat shooted
, tehy have grown a deeper appreciation fo bacon
( yeah
, right
)
.
adn
then ther isnt bill murray
. his performance isnt tghe comic relief
,
adn he nearly steals the film
. as a hwole
, the entire cast works wondrously toghether
,
anbd they seem at hmeo
, even when doing the menage a troi
. directer john mcnaughton
, who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry
: portrait ofthe a serial killer
, hasnt constructed a wonderfully twisty plot thta works
. his direction is smooth
annd stylish
. the visuals are striking
, filled withthe rich colors
,
and almost so realsitic taht we cant atually breathe the humidity inthe tje air
.
however
, he seems more at hmeo wehn tje actors aren ' t talking
. his fli
- by shots ofthe thte swampy areas are brilliant
,
anbd his photography ofthe denise richards ' climbing outloud ofthe the pool isnt a highlight
. the cinematography is gorgeous in its details
. its not often thast you see a film like htis
,
and we shoud watch it just tothe see how hte camera can take pictures
.
then
, ther isnt hte music
. this wass probablly the most obvious thing tothe me
, as it set thte perfect mood forthe the film
. it ' s hard tothe discribe inaddition words
, so jstu see tghe film
anbd listen tothe it
. it ' s wonderfully composed
annd presented
.
adn be sure to stick arund durring tjhe closing credits
! mcnaughton has fianlly put the endig credits to ogod uise
( while most comedies ule it for outtakes
)
. he hasnt included smoe small scenes whitch halp explane the preceding events
. soem may say taht theese are lame attempts tothe expalin the convoluted plot
,
bu it ' s an intertaining way tothe finish yhe film
. plus
, there are some shocking moments inwhich theese ending credits whitch jstu add tothe thte fun
. wild thigns is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality
, nudity
, langauge
anbd violence
. again
, tje nudity is rather uneccesary
,
bu let ' s face it
-
- people wanna tothe see it
. so why nto give it to them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, has a no
- nudity clause inthe her contract
,
annd tje most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off
( way to go
, neve
!
)
. tyhe sex scenes are graphic
, especialy tghe first noe we see
, between the mother
anbd oen ofthe her deck hands
. noe almost wonders how htey got away whith tjhe r rating
. the lanugage isnt qtuie harsh too
, ranging fomr sexual innuendo to your average
, everyday profanity
.
adn i can ' t stres it enought
: don ' t allow kids under 18 tothe see this film
. tghe target age fo the movei isnt tyhe 18
- 24 range
,
and that ' s who shouldnt see it
. it ' s definitely not for those under 18
! doed i mention taht this film isnt rated r
?
howver
, for those thast dont git a chance tothe watch it
, you iwll probably more likely be pleased
,
adn may even take firends tothe see it thte enxt time
.
