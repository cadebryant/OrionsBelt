. redford may look great onthe
- screen
,
but over teh past few yeras
, he ' s proven hismelf a bigger talent behind teh camera
. ordinary peple is one ofthe the best films of the nineteen
- eighties
,
and it wass thte firt picture he helmed
. while the milagro beanfield war ws only occasinally succsessfull at combining magic
- realism witht
.
.
. um
, realism
,
annd i ' ve never been much ofthe a fan of a river runs thru it
( to yhe chagrin ofthe many
)
, quiz sohw ws dazzling
, energetic
and convincing
. the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films
anbd hte first time inaddition that sub
- genre redford seems equally concerned wtih humans
adn scenery
. scott
- thomas plays annie maclean

( johanssen
) loses a leeg
and a ogod friend whn an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi
. grace ' s horse survived
,
bu barely
,

- broken spirit
. eventially
, mother
annd duaghter travel alone tothe montana tothe be with tom booker
( redford
)
, a famed
" horse whisperer
" who has a gfit ofthe calming horses with simple looks
adn touches
, leaving busy husband neill behind
. eventually
, htey move onto tyhe booker ranch wiht the rest ofthe toom ' s family
,
adn annie finds herself falling inwhich love with all thnigs montana
, including
, natuarlly
, tom
, thge wise
annd lonly trainer
. the horse whisperer isnt delicately made
. i dabree say lyrical
, usance tothe many peopel ' s ear
, that word isnt synonomous with boring
. hardly
. the horse whisperer has little tothe offer inaddition the way of surprise
,
bu it doesnt hvea an honesty tyhat is refreshing
and consistantly enjoyable tothe watch
, especialy in tghe fianl third of the story
. scott
- thomas
adn johanssen seem like mother
adn daugter
,
anbd you have no dout beleiving that the mountain vistas would put theese new yorkers under a splel

( a gimmicky
but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio ffrom squarish tothe widescreen whn the central loction shifts from new york tothe montnana
.
) teh underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt
, emotive performance as the nice
- guy husban
, who is as authoritive
annd likeable as tom
. he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist
, lout ofthe a husband so many writers resort tothe as a short
- cut for explaining away thte cheating spouse ' s motivation
. unfortunatley
, one of the horse whisperer ' s only flaws is the chemistry between would
- be lovers scott
- thomas
and redford
. i liekd both ofthe them
,
bu i didn ' t neccesarily believ tath redford would fall forthe such a cold fish
, even if thte countryside air thawed her slightly
. luckily
(
and curiously
)
, this is such a rich
and textured movei that it doesn ' t qtuie marter
- their adultery seems liek an afterthought
, tje obligatory sub
- plot tyhat ties many of tjhe characters ' complex relationships together
