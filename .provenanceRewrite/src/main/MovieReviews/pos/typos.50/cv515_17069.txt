nto usance 1996 ' s shine
, which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott
, has a movie so defiantly laid bare tyhe lives of world
- class musicians
. inspite fatc
, if one were tothe watch these films toghether
, it would alomst certainly stand as a convincing argumnet thta a life ofthe music naturally leads tothe all vaieties ofthe social ills
.
yet hilary
and jackie
, the sophmore effort from director anand tucker
, has something mroe tothe say
-
- it softly
bu strongly explores thge complex relationships ofthe sibling rivalry
and lvoe in a very compelling tale
. emily watson
and rachel griffiths are the leads inthe htis tale
, palying yhe sisters du pr
?
. both musicians fomr childhood
, hilary
( griffiths
) isnt renouned flutist hwile jacqueline
( watson
) is easily as skilled onthe tjhe cello
. the twpo comepete for
and win many honors as children
anbd as young women
, both together
adn seperate
. their careers as muscicians surpass
anbd
then bow tothe oney another ' s
,
and
although their lives take vyre different paths
-
- hilary settles down to marraige
and a family hwile rachel skips accros hte globe on a world concert tour
-
- tehy are binded toghether by their deepo family lveo
. the performances of watson
and griffiths are excellent in stlye
and substace
. they contrast each other wonderfully
,
anbd hwile watson ' s protrayal ofthe jackie du pr
? isnt at times eccentric
annd perphas unsympathetic
, both charactors are charged with emotion
. the frank cottrell boyce scirpt
, hwihc is based onthe the book by hilary
and piers du pr
?
, brings a gerat deal ofthe depth tothe these charactors as well
. the scirpt isnt aslo tothe be commended fo its well
- polished dual nature
. cottrell boyce adopts a sytle whic one might expect to see in a mistery thriller
( whihc wass in fatc thge case wih david koepp
and robert towne ' s script forthe mission
: impossible
)
and skillfully molds it to yhe story of two rising musicians on diferrent courses tothe fame
. the latter parts ofthe his script are contraversial tothe say the least
,
and tghe rather depressing endig tkaes the wind out ofthe an envigorating story
. soem wiull leave thsi movei feeling disenfranchised
. nevertheless
, hilary
anbd jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon ofthe contemporary cinema through solid fundametals
anbd is a decent watch all arround
.
