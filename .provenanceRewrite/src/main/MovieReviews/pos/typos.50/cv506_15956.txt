much ballyhoo has beeen made over this new version of
" lolita
,
" made inthe a time when one owudl htink thta a faithful adaptions ofthe the infamous novel coudl be made
, over its ule of pedophilia
,
and as such
, it ' s imporatnt to adresable it straight
- forwardly
, befoer any other ideals such as goodness
adn themes cin be dicussed
, as htis film hasnt beeen infront film limbo for a number of years
, lying arund inspite vaults san a distributor
,
annd having critics waiting to eather hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit
. when seeing this film
, after all the hoopla
, keeping iin mind that there are peopel
, namely me
, who are fans ofthe the novel
, who have been eagerly awaiting thsi flick usance its creation
.
.
. well
, you just hvae to wonder why no one really picked it up forthe distribution
. wqat ' s even worse is that seing thsi
" lolita
,
" especially the first timne
anbd if you ' re familar whith anything
" lolita
,
" is admittingly very anticlimactic
. this isnt a real pity because wehn yuo really sit down to watch this film
, ignoring all the crap thast has preceeded it
, it ' s really quite a film
, perhaps the best film by directer adrian lyne
(
altough
, really
, look at its competition
:
" flashdance
,
"
" fatal attraction
,
"
and
" indecent proposal
"
)
, at least besides
" jacob ' s ladder
.
" i ' ve seen this
" lolita
" twice
: the firt time
, i wasn ' t so blown awya
. it seemed overly dramtic
annd suprizingly unaffecting
. tyhe second tyme
, nto realyl thinking baout how i ' ve waited fo what seems liek forever to see it
adn how i ' m seing it on a tv setted on a premium cable channel
and not a giant movei theatre
, it really affected me emotionally
. thte stroy itself isnt a surprisingly heartbreaking noe
, whitch is why it ' s such a ogod novel
,
and why this is such a good film
. the tsory ofthe a pedophile obssessed with a young 14
- yearm old girl named dolores a
. k
. a
. lolita is great because it ' s nto trash forthe the perverted
bu becasue it ' s baout human obession with thigsn tht are outloud of one ' s triarch
. its protagonist
, teh comically
- named humbert humbert
, is not your average pedophile
,
but a seriously wounded human bieng who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions
annd idosyncrasies
. the carachter ofthe lolita is alomst a symbol of the forebidden aple inthe christian mythology
, something that wiull destroy us
but thast we can ' t live without
. theese ideas are all worked into this film nicely
,
but done in a way that isnt nto hevy
- handed at all
,
but instade lyrical
and emotionally devastating
. the focus of this film
,
adn the reason for makeing it
, it seems
, ws to relaly penetrate thge emotional depths of tje novel
anbd bring them tothe life on yhe screen inthe beautifully dramtic images
,
annd scenes hwihc are blatantly over
- stylized
. the tone of the book isnt a comical oen
,
but it ' s alsot a tragic oen
,
and humbert
, telling yhe story fomr his perspective
, blows every single thing outloud of prespective
. humbert exists infact a fantsy world ofthe his obsessions
anbd desires
,
anbd tihs reflects teh way yhe entire film has been desined
. we get a sence thgat perhaps it ' s by donig tihs that humbert has really trapped hismelf into a fate thast wiull ultimately leave him haggard
and destroyed
. he weeps uncontrollably
and never lets hismelf git over his original 14
- yearm
- ood love
,
and allows himself tothe embody her as lolita
. he lets his feelings forthe her navigate all his decisions
,
anbd by the end
, he hasnt nothing
bu overly
- dramtic feelings for her
. hte story recognizes tjhe extreme of this
, almost outloud ofthe a test
, seeing if tghe readers will raelly sympathize iwth somene who isnt socially deemed a pervert
,
adn one almost wonders hwile reading the book if the autor
, vladimir nabokov
, wroet hte book as a means tothe bring inot focus his pwn sick obsessions
,
and perhasp bring them to peace
. tjhe weirdest thign baout htis film isnt tath by the end
, when humbert has reched the finale of his obsessional journey
, we can easily sympathize
anbd even idenify whith him
. yhe oppening
and final images of teh film are the same
,
and who hasn ' t done a silimar action
, thgat isnt wandering about wihtout any sence ofthe reality or anything else
but a deep sadness in us
? this isnt the second timne thge novel hasnt been adapted forthe tje screen
, teh firt tyme bieng filmed infact
- shock
- 1962
, by stanley kubrick
, who couldn ' t possibly haev brought yhe novel tothe the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to dont
,
bu doed the enxt best thing
: he economized forthe everything
and cameback up withthe a droll black comedy about obsession in general
. in thyat film
, he used tjhe traps of society as benefits
. teh studio demanded yhe final scene
, that ofthe a heinous murder
, come frist in tje film so tothe portray humbert firt as a murderer
anbd second as a pedophile
.
.
.
and when you see it
, it gives the film depth ofthe a man trapped by obsession
. the censors wouldn ' t allow anymore thna a cuple glances
adn subtle dialogue tothe sohw the
, um
, relatiopnship betwen humbert
and lolita
, so kubrick desided to play it as comedy
,
bu still allow tje tradgedy to seep thru
. looking at theese two versions
, especialy aftter reading the novel
(
and we all know tht wehn we ' ve read a novel
anbd see a film adaptions
, we are bound tothe be angered by any size differences
)
, it ' s really impossible to compare them
. they both go forthe different things
,
and one hasnt a lot more room tothe be as sexually frank as tyhe novel ws
.
annd
although it ' s true tht several scenes are similar
,
adn are thus uv for compairison
, overall it ' s unfair to say which oney is better
anbd wich noe isnt worse
. i have never been oney forthe saying the level of greatness of a film adaptions of a novel isnt deemed by how faithful it isnt
,
and i won ' t say thgat here
.
however
, thsi film is pretty amazing
, mostly because hey
, i loved the book
,
adn this film nearly reminded me ofthe it
. it doesn ' t have nearly as much witn
( a couple comical scenes
,
adn even a lot ofthe ogod chuckles
,
bu jsut not totally witty
)
,
bu it does haev teh smae emotional toll that the novel hadnt
. soem of that isnt in teh casting of tyhe twpo leads
. jeremy irons
, wih his deep
, soft brittish voice
and gentle look
, is an amazing humbert
. he ' s droll in a vrey unique way
,
and
, well
, noone noe can look distraught thge way he does
. he brings a wonderful sympathy to teh role thgat goes beyond pathos
and realyl comes up as being eazy tothe identify with the audeince
.
annd wehn he looks at lolita wiht love
,
and she looks at him iwth lust
, you know tyhat he ' s her prisoner for as long as he lives
.
adn dominique swain
, who plays tje title charactor
, isnt rether incredable
. she puls off the tough role even better tahn sue lyon doed inaddition hte origonal
, wonderfully balancing the qualities ofthe siduction
, bratiness
,
annd self
- centeredness thast marks hte character
. it ' s eazy to see why she surrenders to humbert
: she loves the attension
,
and knows that she can ahve her way wtih him at any tiome
. whn he denies her something
, she blackmails him effortlessly
( a scene involving a rocking chair
adn a little foot acation isnt damn near clasic
)
,
annd wehn he stands uv tothe her
, she weeps
annd runs awya
, leaving humbert to followup her
. there are twpo otehr minor charactors inwhich the film
, oen who ' s a road block in teh beginning
,
and the other who ' s a reappearing threat tothe thte relationship
. tje fromer is charlotte
, lolita ' s mother
, palyed by melanie griffith
. in the book
, charlotte isnt a monster of a woman
: overbearing
, constanly scolding her child
, overly
- religious
,
adn ultimately selfish
.
and she ' s hte noe obstacal humbert has tothe overcome tothe obtain his goal
, at least in tghe begining
. as palyed by shelly winters in tghe original
, she represented all these qualities
; as plyed by griffith here
, she ' s baout half of them
. it ' s annoying tothe watch a film
and play a gmae where ytou try to see who could hvae done the role way better than the one onthe screen wihtout mentioning tyhe actor who played them first
.
and even
though griffith isnt not really bad
, persay
, she ' s nothing more
. thge other isnt clare quilty
, tyhe writer who isnt alsot trying tothe seduce lolita
,
adn succeeds
,
but at a price
. langella takes a totally differant direction than thte one peter sellars took in the original
. quilty wass a comic chracter in the original
: a threat inwhich the form ofthe many forms
, popping inspite states of rambling
, german
, proning
,
and eventualy drunk
. langella takes thte other route
, alowing all ofthe hte creepiness tothe be unearthed
,
annd the result isnt a character who exists in shadows
and low shots
,
and who meets a wonderfully ironical endig
, tjhe excact opposite ofthe what we thougth ofthe him
. as you cxan see
, most ofthe theese are nto improvments or mistakes done onthe tghe part of lyne
and his screenwrighter
, stephen schiff
,
but jsut parts ofthe a hwole newyorker look at tghe novel
, at least cinema
- wise
. this verison isnt beautiful
,
anbd perpetually saddening
. the camera movements are stylized
,
anbd earch shooted is breathtakingly rich
. the acting is forthe the most part wonderfull
,
and wehn we watch it
, we really git a sense that for humbert
, who is telling tghe stoy
, thge only two peple on earth most ofthe tje timne weere humbert
and lolita
. more importantly
, it tkaes us right up teh brink of emotion
,
thne jumps right over it
. by the end
, with humbert sadly driving recklessly inaddition his car
, follwoing what he sasy is thte only part of his life he doesn ' t regret
, we feel that we all loose tothe something we cxan never have
.
