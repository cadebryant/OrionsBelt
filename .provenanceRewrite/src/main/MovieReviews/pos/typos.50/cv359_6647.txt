- year relationship six monthes ago tothe move from n
. y
. to l
. a
.
anbd he ' s still nto over her
. as a result
, his jokes fall flat when he tries tothe imbaress
,
and he ' s a comedian
. well
, an unemployed comedian
, oney ofthe hollywood ' s little fish
,
and it has gotten so bad he ' s asked for an application at starbuck ' s
. catually
, the starbuck ' s thing gets even worse
.

howver
, plyed endearingly by jon favreau
. swingers revolves aroud mike ' s half
- hearted
annd ackward effords to git back inspite the social swing ofthe things
. to thsi end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething acto firends
, such as trent
( vince vaughn with tghe film ' s most animated performance
)
, who has the gift of gab bordering on hte disturbing side of motivational speaking
, gun
- toting sue
( patrick van horn
)
,
adn rob
( ron livingston
)
, who once plyed hamlet
but now longs tothe work as goofy in disneyland
,
bu doesn ' t succeed baceause ofthe his lack of
" theme park xperience
.
" together tehy talk about womens
- how to make eye contact
, whitch involves avoiding it
,
and wehn tothe call so as never tothe apear despreate
, twpo dyas being
" industry standard
.
" affter tlaking the talk
, they walk hte walk
, strutting like the cool swingers they aspire to be
, alwyas tothe laughable effect
. to git mike out of his funk
, his firends persistently convince him tothe get outside
, whther it be tothe a quickie night trip tothe a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party wiht the beautiful peple or a 50s swing lounge
. everywhere htey encourage mike tothe look forthe a replacement
" honey
"
and
then keep vigil over his progress
, or lack ofthe it
. like dotty duting parents
, mike never leaves thier comapany wihtout being the recipient of their confidence cheerleading
(
" you ' re omney
, mike
,
and tyhe honeys konw it
.
"
) or equiped wih theri eccentric dating philosphies
, such as an analogy of flirting with the bear
adn thge bunny
. whith tyhe unwavering wupport ofthe firends like theese
, maybe mike ' s not doing too badly affter all
. favreau allso doubled as the film ' s screenwriter
,
and he proves he hasnt teh gift for creating engaging charactors
and witty banter that goes beyond todya ' s bon mot
. there isnt a reassuring honesty tothe teh friendships
, even when it hits its low points
annd thge friends commiserate
. whn mike gets tghe gumption tothe look fo love
, you will join his cheerleading section as well
. swingers isnt ight
, unassuming fare
, sweet candy yuo wiull want to bust your gut with
- laughing
