most movies seem to realease a thrid movei just so it can be called a triology
. rocky iii seems to kind of fit infront thgat category
,
bu manages to be slightly unique
. tjhe rocky forumla of
" rocky loses fight
/ rocky trains
/ rocky wins fight
" is carried out tothe tje letter
. alsot hte ' tradition ' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well
. this movie begins with a series ofthe clips showing how famoust rocky
( sylvester stallone
) hasnt become
.
.
. even showing a brief appearance onthe sesame street
!
!
hten it moves onthe with rocky being inthe a fixed fight wiht thunderlips
( hulk hogan
)
. a misterious bad
- ass known as clubber lang
( mr
. t
) trash
- talks tothe rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing
and that he
" pities the fool
" forthe not coming outloud
adn fighting him outright
. rocky ' s trainer
( burgess meredith
) tells rocky not to fight
,
bu the italion itallion doesn ' t listen
. naturually
, he gets his ass kicked
. somwhere allong yhe line aftter htis several thigsn hppen
. rocky ' s longtime trainer dies
, causing rocky to train whith his former oponent apollo creed
. rocky ' s wief complains tothe her husban that he shoudl fight
. the final fight ensues beween clubber
and rocky
. guess who wins
? thte winner ' s nmae rhymes wih ' smocky '
. tyhe movie is entertaning mainly because ofthe clubber lang ' s over tyhe top performence
. the dramtic aspect hasnt beeen toned down considerably since rocky ii
and now acation seems to be yhe storng point ofthe teh film
. which isnt ogod if you like fighting scenes
. tjhe lsat match is quite decent actualy
. if you liekd tyhe previvous films
, rent this one
. it ' s well worth seeing if you are a fan ofthe the serieses
.
but if ytou can ' t stand rocky shouting
" adrianne
!
!
!
" one more time
, see something else
