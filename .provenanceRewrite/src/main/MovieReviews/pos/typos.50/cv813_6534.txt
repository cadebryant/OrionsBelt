. tihs isnt director tim burton ' s finest film to date
. many will compare thsi tale of martians who invade earth to independendet day
,
bu even
though the stroies are similiar
, htey really are twpo distinctly different films
.
however as a whole
, mars attacks isnt much omre entertaining tahn id4
,
anbd i loved id4
. you realy hve tothe be in the right frome of mind tothe enjoy this film
. it isnt completely wacked
- out
and unlike anything you ' ve ever seen
. once tje silly tone of tjhe film isnt set
, it ' s easy tothe just sit back
and throw logic outloud thge window because logic
and comedy just don ' t mix
. tjhe plot is simple
: martians invade tje earth
.
bu it ' s different tahn any otehr invasion film
. usually it ' s the evil aliens versus thte heroic humans
. thsi timne
howver
, it ' s teh goofy aliens versus thte equally goofy humans
. teh martians
, who are all cmoputer generated
, are jsut baout the funniest things i ' ve seen in a long timne
. htey look funny
, tehy move funny
,
and their
" laguage
" is hilarious
.
and baout hte spacial effects
. the effects in mars attacks
! are just baout the most flawess ones i ' ve seen tothe date
. thte cmoputer animation ofthe the martians conbined with the goofy personalities htey are given mkaes them seem 100
% rela
. there are jsut a couple ofthe scenes that don ' t work
, mailny those involving sarah jessica parker
and pierce brosnan on board an aline ship
. allso
, glenn close overacts tremendously infront her
( thankfully
) vyre limited screen tiome
, so much so thta i catually applauded silently wehn her charcter meets her demise
.
bu htere are many big laughs in tghe film
, as i said
, if you are infact tghe right mood
. sould it have beeen funnier
? certainly
. was it funny anough
? yes
. wass i entertained
? absolutely
. onthe a personal note
, i ' d liek to thank whomever cast rod steiger
( my favorite actor
) in the film as war
- crazy general decker
. finally
, aftter many vrey small parts infront direct tothe video garbage
and minor tv roles
, steiger is bakc on thge big screen in a rela movie that many people wiull see
. while he ' s nto given tghe type ofthe role that you can give a rela
" performance
" in
, he does yhe job well
and hasnt some good lines ofthe dialogue
. the preview audeince i saw the film wtih raelly seemed to enjoy him
