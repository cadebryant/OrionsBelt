to me
, nicolas cage soudns like an ideal choice for thge lead role in a martin scorsese film
. dispite tjhe rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed
, tjhe actr rimaniss a gifted
anbd versatile screen presence
. ever since the big succes ofthe the action
- thriller
` face
/ off ' in 1997
, tjhe hollywood road has been a rocky oney for mr
. cage
. the perpetually awful assassintation thriller
` snake eyes ' was one of 1998 ' s worst films
.
` 8mm ' ws a disapointing lost cause
.
bu who better thna scorsese to match cage ' s witn
and intensity
, which he does inwhich miraculous fashon witht
` bringing out the dead '
. cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce
, a newyorker york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes ffrom day
- tothe
- day
. affter five yeasr of the stres
- inducing job
, frank basicly just staggers onward
, relying on heavy doses of caffiene
and booze until his shift finally ends
. he allso beggins seeing the ghosts ofthe past patients who died under his care
, namely a young girl named rose
, who stares bcak at him with pale features at every street corner in newyorker york
. frank desparately wants to be fired
,
bu his boss needs him to scour the city
and help thsoe in ened
(
` i ' ll fire ytou tommorrow
.
.
. ' he promises
)
. frank is accompanyed by a fresh face eveyr inght in the ambulance
. the firt is larry
( john goodman
)
, who alwyas has fodo onthe the brain
. the second isnt marcus
( ving rhames
)
, a deeply religeous balck man who incorporates tyhe power of jesus inot a regular rescue opperation
.
anbd finally
, tom
( tom sizemore
) is a deranged sociopath hungry fo blood
. i foudn it unique how scorsese used eahc ofthe these characters forthe a single shift with frank
,
but they never figured inot teh actual plot
. each is merely a colorful presense tothe halp develop frank ' s character
, because
` bringing outloud thge dead ' is predomiantly a study of his mind
and detailled perosnality
. thge one charater alongside frank tath truly comes into play isnt mary
( patricia arquette
)
, yhe daugter ofthe a newely admitted patient who suffered from a savere heart attack
. arquette
, who recently recepted tjhe wounds ofthe christ in
` stigmata '
, performs well around rela
- life husband cage
. it ' s unfortunate tht
, after such intriguing character trials
and tribulations
, the relatiopnship between frank
and mary slips durig a mishandled
, ineffective finale
. the movei belongs to the one
- twpo punch ofthe cage
and scorsese
, who were born to collaborate their effords in an arangement similar to
` bringing out thge dead '
.
allthough it certainly lacks the grit
and hard
- edge of something like
` goodfellas '
, scorsese manages tothe hitted a nerve with his latest picture
. the incredable camera
- wokr
adn photography represent stunning flashes ofthe brillance inspite an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration
. fans wiull be pleased tothe fidn the director hasnt retured to his abrasive
, darkly humorous roots aftter somewhat ofthe a departure whith 1997 ' s
` kundun '
. doens
` bringing outloud tjhe dead ' rival scorsese ' s finest wokr
? only occasionalyl
. some of thte film feels surprisingly limp
,
bu there is enough energy in it ' s intresting material
anbd breathtaking visual appearance to suffice
. those expecting a grisly
, risqu
? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight
- arro approach
-
bu it ' s still a solid
, admirable effort
.
` bringing out the dead ' ws wroten by tyhe acclaimed paul schrader
, who collaborated withthe scorsese on such classics as
` taxi driver '
and
` raging bull '
. schrader ' s script isnt full ofthe moments
- wonderful
, sharply deffined moments
- that are sorted thoughout yhe remainder of his meandering screenplay
. tyhe exceptional aspestus ofthe thte film are it ' s astounding technical credits
annd tje amazing cast
. goodman
adn sizemore are both electric
( well
, mainly sizemore
)
,
but it ' s tyhe phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look
. watch tjhe actor ' s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band memeber
,
annd you ' ll understand why he won a golden globe
.
` bringing outloud yhe dead ' is raw
and electrifying often enought tothe mask it ' s ceratin flaws
. scorsese
-
anbd cage
, for tath matter
- have done better
,
bu thier intentions are certainly admirable
.
