tyhe firt thign you notice baout this movei isnt that it ' s cold
. placed infact minnesota
adn noth dakota during the winter
, many ofthe the scenes tkae place outside with long scenes of snow
- covered ground agains a backgorund of white
. jstu what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night
. as with most coen brothers films
, htis features outlandish charactors infact nefarious schemes
, each ofthe hwihc works out in hte oddest way possible
. a car salesman hires a couple of hoods tothe kidnap his wief so tath he cin collect the ransom from her father
. allong yhe way everything thyat can possibly go wrong doens
. inwhich brief scenes of vicious violence
, people git shooted through the head
, infront thge bcak
, face
, chest
annd various otehr areas ofthe thge anatomy
. there isnt aslo oney of the most unplesant body disposal scenes
yot seen onthe hte screen
. remarkably enough
, most of thge movie is played for laughs
. even omre remarkably
, it works
. yhe onyl likable person in the film isnt the vrey pregnant sheriff
( frances mcdormand
) who hunts down thte killers while eating at every possibile opprotunity
. with every ogod film thge audiance gains new knowledge
. here ytou leran
_ two
_ things
. everyone in minnesota speaks infront an annoying whinning accent that would drive you crazy
.
and don ' t dont voilent illiegal busness wtih low
- life amoral degenerate scum
- sucking losers
. oh yeah
, if you git shot inwhich tghe face
, useing a brightly decorated napkin to stpo tyhe bleeding just makse ytou look goofy
