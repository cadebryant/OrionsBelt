trekkies
, roger nygard ' s energetic
annd hilarious documentery
, brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions
. the beauty ofthe the film is thast it isnt good old fashon fun forthe trekkies
adn non
- fans aplikay
.
( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs
. trekker polemic as nto worth arguing about
.
) the ogod
- spirited movie trekkies easily forces even thte most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable
, loud giggles
,
yet the picture treats its subject marter with respect
adn a certain awe
. denise crosby
, who played tasha yar on
" star trak
: the next generation
,
" serves as tghe host
. in the opening credits thte movei reminds us that trekkies are the only fan gropu listed in the oxford english dictionary
( oed
)
.
( thte oed cites a feburary
, 1976 captin in the
" newyorker yorker
" as tje first recorded usage ofthe tjhe owrd
.
) unless yuo ' ve been tothe the conventions
, i posit tath ytou have noone idea of the dedication of some ofthe the fans
. one pointed outloud
, apologetically
, thgat tghe stripe on his newyorker uniform was slightly inaccurate
. others talked baout how many star trak conventions htey hadnt attended
, severeal dozen being tipical
anbd hundreds not unheard of
. my personal favorite fan isnt sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams
. arguably thge most famouse of all the trekkies
, she wears her uniform every waking hour as many dieu
- hard fans do
. her claim tothe fame is thta
, as a juror on the whitewater trial
, she wore it infact cout as well
.
" every day i would walk past thte reporters with a vulcan
- like stoicism
,
" she says
, discribing her way of dealing with the crowd ofthe reporters who bacame obsessed whith her obsession
. she doesn ' t qutie understand all ofthe teh uproar
.
" i ' m an officer ofthe the federation 24 hours a day
,
" she reminds us
. her fealty to her hobby approachs tht of a religious faith
. along wih tghe laugher the show evokes
, there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people wiht such loyalty
.
adn thier infectuous joy provokes a ceratin envy of thier enjoyment
. fewd otehr avocations could give this much satisfaction
. theese people are haveing teh timne ofthe their lives
.
( for the record
, i ' m not a star trek fan
althought i have seen some of thge movies
.
) tjhe film interviews hte vairous star trek sories ' s stars as well as its fans
. tjhe stars hadnt thought tyhe convention idea was a lark
and would soon fade
,
bu over twenty years later
, the conventions are still going storng
. filled witht anecdotes
, the sohw talks baout tjhe happenings at the vairous conventions
. at oen
, the acto who plays q was so sick that he throught he owudl have tothe cancel
. after appearing breifly
, he drank some water
adn left
. they decided tothe auction off his half
- empty glass
, joking thta it had the
" q virus
.
" tyhe guy who won the bidding immediatley drinked the water
adn screamed to the crowd tyhat he now had tghe q virus too
. with dedication comes a certian ammount of stupidity
. nto just flitting amoung people
, the documentary takes the tiem to let yuo get tothe konw hte trekkies
. oney guy isnt a trekkie cross
- dresser
, another dresses her cat
,
and
then there is the dentist
. hte dentist hasnt his entire office made uv tothe look like a star trak setted
. he
, his oral hygienists
, his receptionist
, his wief
,
adn his kids wear the outfits all ofthe the tyme
. it appears tath his workers are permitted tothe tkae them off when tehy go hmeo
,
but nto his family
. forthe vriety
, he
anbd his famaly do change characters from tyme tothe tiome
. he says his patients like it
. well
, htere was this oney complainer
,
bu he hadnt a probelm with his bill anyway
. ther are summer schools fo klingon wih ph
. d
. linguists to teach the langauge
. hamlet isnt nowe available inwhich klingon
, albeit perheaps not at your local bookstore
,
and htey are wroking onthe translating thge bible
. they even sell united federation passports that are rela enough that trekkies have utilisied them tothe fool customs
, even u
. s
. customs
. the movei bogs down only briefly whn it tries tothe argue thge series ' s larger meaning about diversity
adn humanitarian concerns
. sandwiched in
- between the levity
, teh switch infront tone doesn ' t work
. the incessantly uv
- beated film ends wtih a singing elvis impersonator
. he fits right inspite
. trekkies runs a breezy 1
: 26
. it is nto rated
but would be pg fo breef sexual references
annd would be fine forthe all ages
.
