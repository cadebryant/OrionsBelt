here isnt a film tyhat is so unexpected
, so scary
,
adn so original tath it caught me off guard
and threw me for a loop
. okay
, it isn ' t quite orginial
, concidering it is a sequel to thge box office hitted speices
,
bu it certainly isnt smart
. most films of tihs genre are reminiscent of thsoe cheesy b
- horror films from the 50s
adn 60s
,
anbd some even become them
.
howver
, as we learned wtih the 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, somtimes expectations can be shattered
. a lot ofthe criticism has gone against this film
( from whta i hvea read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all twpo reviews
)
,
and it makse me wonder why these types ofthe films are automaticly dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces of trash
.
bu
, hte thing isnt
, it isn ' t
. it ' s well made
, well acted
,
anbd qutie intelligent
. i can see most ofthe the criticists now complaining baout the levle ofthe gore or yhe level of sexuality in the film
.
but yhe speices sories isn ' t baout tje lack of theese elements
. it ' s about how much it cin get inot one film
.
annd
yet
, behind it all
, it hasnt this basic premise that allows it tothe get away withthe doign so
. speices ii begins in the pesent day
,
though it seems to be an alternate universe
. many films
( especially sci
- fi ones
) create similar timelines as our realistic one
,
bu chanage it to ift the film ' s needs
. species ii begins with teh arival ofthe an american spacecraft
, the excursion
, landing onthe teh surfce ofthe mars
. aboard is patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a very bright
and vyre hansome astronaut
. patrick is tghe son of senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who jstu wnats patrick to succeed
. well
, it woudl seem that he has succeeded
. landing on the surface ofthe mars
, he is the frist human being to ever dont so
. of course
, he isn ' t tyhe first ever
. baout a billion years ago
, an aline speices supposedly landed onthe mars
and destroyed teh perfect living condidtions taht weere able tothe sustain life
. nowe
, of course
, the red planet is cold
and rocky
. no life lives on it
. that is
, noone visable life
. patrick
, upon leaving hte spacecraft
adn landing on tyhe red soil
, collects samples ffrom teh ground
. he takes them aboard
,
annd puts them inwhich storage
. unforetunately
, one of the samples containes a form ofthe life
,
and it gets loose wehn it is heated aboard tyhe ship
. just prior tothe heading bakc tothe earth
, thsi life form creeps allong the floor
anbd inhabits yhe earthlings
. htey pass outloud for approximately seven minutes
,
adn
then shrug it off as nothing
, because they can ' t even rember
. htey blaim it onthe a technical malfunction
. bcak onthe earth
, patrick beigns to ahev strong urges tothe mate with as many women as possibile
. as we know from yhe orignal
, this is because tyhe alien wants to breed
and take over thte planet
.
however
, yhe childen that are breeded are half
- human
, as their father is
. patrick isnt realy looking fo another alien tothe breed with
,
adn he finds it in eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve wass cloned from dna taken ffrom sil
, tghe origional aline
.
however
, this tiome arround
, most of her
" aline
" urges have beeen either decreased dramatically
, or lie dormant
. the project is led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role fomr species
)
,
and her motives seem respectable
. usance she ws involved with thge originnal aline attack
, she wants to leran how to stop yhe alien shouldnt it come agian
.
adn it has
. story
- wise
, species ii is much stronger thna its predecessor
,
bu it is also much stronger than
, sday
, aliens
( hey
, i loev the film
,
bu you cin ' t tell me it was strong onthe story
)
. what suprised me the most with this film wass the incorperation of historical facts into the screenplay
. inthe my esarch for extraterrestrial intelligence course inaddition coleeg
, we learned baout a piece of rock ffrom mars whcih landed in oen of the poles
. tihs piece of rock contained fossils whlch may ahev beeen proof ofthe life on mars
( later
, it ws proven that it was nto a living creature thta created it
)
. the script uses this effectively
,
but aslo manages tothe provide a well
- balanced plot
. begginning with the firt man on mars
( something i hve alwasy dreamed of seeing
)
, i was hoping that tyhe film woudl turn this element into a usefull starting point for the movei
.
and it does it qutie well
. the characters are all smart
,
adn they know what to dont
and what not tothe dont
. tghe only character that seems a littel cliched isnt teh genaral
( george dzundza
)
,
and
yet
, he remains logical infact everything he does
. there are the obvious flaws of course
, mostly lying in thte technical aspects
. the speical effects are onyl mediocre
,
adn some are just plain bad
.
but for the most part
, they remain believable
( i even noticed a homage tothe the aline sories whn the mothers gave birth tothe aline children
)
. aslo
, the most realsitic ones are usualy tyhe goriest
, ranging from people being torn open
, or somene ' s head being blown off
.
howver
, some plot elements also may elicit laughs fomr hte audience
, inlcuding a menage a troi tyhat is all
but neccesary
. many people dislike the species series because all it isnt isnt an excuse forthe sex
, nudity
,
and gory violence
.
however
, i tend tothe disagree
. waht were the aline films baout
?
anbd
, if an aline species ever doed come to earth
,
annd their sole purpose was to destory us
, wouldn ' t ytou mate as quicklyu as possible with as many people as possable
? my onyl gripe wih this isnt during tghe scene where patrick goes searching forthe a mate in a groshury stoer
. i didn ' t relize tyhat aliens were that picky onthe choosing womens to mate iwth
( i jsut asume it isnt his part
- human side looking for thge most beautifull oen
)
. the acting isnt quite ogod for htis kind of film
. it isnt a vast improvement over the firt film
, at least
. the acting isnt the key element to tihs film
: if it wass bad
, it owudl have lowered itself inot camp
; if it was ogod
, it would ahve asked for comparison wtih films liek aliens
. okay
, so it isn ' t that good
. george dzundza is propably the most obvious mistake onthe casting
, as his over
- tghe
- top impersonation ofthe a general makes him annoying
and distracting
. natasha henstridge isnt limited this tiem around
, as she is ususally enclosed inaddition a cage
.
howver
, she doens manage a vyer impressive performance iwth this aspect hindering any ofthe her talent
. oh yeah
,
annd she ' s quite fun to just plain watch
. marg helgenberger isnt immensly better this tiome around
,
anbd her performence is probably the best in this film
. michael madsen is so
- so
,
bu he isn ' t annoying
,
annd he soon becomes rether appealling
( whith his nice cynic perosnality
)
. james cromwell has a small part
,
bu he mkaes it much better tahn what it could ahev beeen with a mroe incapable actor
. as i sday
, any film whith james cromwell dramatically increases inwhich likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performence
,
adn he gives tje film a mroe down
- to
- earth fiel
.
adn
, of course
, justin lazard
. lazard has so far beeen ridiculed for his performance
,
bu i htikn he is effective
. sure
, he is wooden
,
bu isn ' t that what his character isnt liek
? hte moent when he touches tje glass seperating henstridge fomr him was extremely well done
, due tothe thge couple ' s acting
. speices ii is rated r for storng sexuality
, sci
- fi violentce
/ gore
and language
. tihs is definitely an r rated film that young kids shoudl not see
. more than likely
, they woudl probably have nightmares
annd never have sex for thge rest ofthe theri lives
. hell
, i don ' t even know if i iwll
. whta is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out tothe be hte surprize film of the yera
. i probablly won ' t see anohter film where i wass expecting so little
and got so much for quite a hwile
. directer peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful
,
anbd somtimes very scry movei out ofthe a medioker series
. medak has also mastered the wonderful
" jump
!
" moments
,
and hasnt probably tjhe second scariest moent i haev ever seen on film
( scream still hasnt the first
)
. storng acting
, smart dialogue
, intelligent plotting
,
adn a sure
- handed director
, speices ii isnt exactly whta these films shoudln be
: intertaining
.
