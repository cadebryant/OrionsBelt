almost a full decade befor steven spielberg ' s saveing private ryan asked whther a film could be both
" anti war
"
and
" pro
- soldier
"
, john irvin ' s hamburger hill prooved it sould
. lost in tje innundation ofthe critical acclaim taht greeted oliver stone ' s platoon
, tihs excellent film was dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it ' s hard to understand exactlly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, iin assembling his motley collecton of young men who for predictable
(
adn oftenly naieve
) reasons
" chose to sohw uv
" for the vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- has refused to pesent us with the stone killer
, drug
- stoked pyscho
adn ruthless opportunist who have become tothe vietnam war epics what
" the polack
, hte hillbilly
and the kid from brooklyn
" bacame to wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based onthe a true stoy
, isnt nto an eazy film to watch
. ther isnt a scene thast will haev graying anti
- war activists squirming inwhich thier seats
, or moved tothe genuine tears
.
anbd yhe climactic fianl assault on the
" hill
" in question isnt visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented in breif flashes
, as if the brain dared nto acknowldeged what it had encountered
.
and inspite tje mud
and smoke officer
annd enlistee
, veteran
and
" newbie
"
, black solider
and white
, become allmost indistinguishable from earch other
, as tehy dont in yhe chaos of actuall combat
. the acting throughtout isnt solid witht an absolutely stellar performance renedered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- iin a role thgat iwll hvea many flatly disbelieving thyat this is same actro they cheered as
" seaman jones
" inthe mctiernan ' s red october
. if you ' ve seen private ryan
, ytou owe it tothe youself to see hamburger hill
-
- if onyl tothe determine that the all tghe valour
and horror of spielberg ' s vision ws as present inwhich thte ashau vallay as it ws at omaha beach
.
