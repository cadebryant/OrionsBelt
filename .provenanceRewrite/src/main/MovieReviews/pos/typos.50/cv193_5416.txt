on tjhe basis of tihs film alone
, i never owudl ahve predicted that
, inwhich two years
, quentin tarantino would become tyhe ocuntry ' s biggest hotshot directer
. reservoir dogs hasnt hints ofthe the tarantino brillance thast emerged inspite pulp fiction
,
but is a much less substantive
, more convential crime stoy thna the big pf
. here ' s whta thge twpo movies dont have in common
.
.
.
-
- scenes ofthe intelligent
, amusing dialogue with noone relevence tothe the plot
-
- a sotry tyhat jumps back
and forth in time rether thna goign in a logical
, chronological sequence
-
- graphic
yet necesary voilence
-
- an engaging crime story
-
- dialogue liberally spiced iwth swear words
and racial
/ gender slurs
-
- threee ofthe tje smae actors
( harvey keitel
, tim roth
and steve buscemi
)
-
- a mexican standoff ending
,
although tihs oen isnt considerably less optimistic than pf resevoir dogs is an entire hour shorter tahn pulp fiction becasue it ' s only got one story to tell rether thna threee
. crime lord joe cabot
( veteran acto lawrence tierney
) hasnt assembled five criminals who hvae never even met earch other tothe pul a diamond stoer heist
. thte five are instructed nto to reveal thier rela names or personal details or anything tje cops coudl uise if oney of them wass capturd
adn interrogated
. instead
, tehy are all given code names off the colour chart
-
- mr
. white
( keitel
)
, mr
. pink
( buscemi
)
, mr
. orange
( roth
)
, mr
. blonde
( michael madsen
)
, mr
. brown
( tarantino
)
adn mr
. peach
( tarantino ' s chin
)
. most of the movei ' s running time is spended with mr
. white
annd pink waiting at a warehouse forthe thte others tothe arrive
. mr
. orange
, meanwhile
, is onthe the floor
, dying fomr a gunshot wound
. the polical hadnt arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon
, leading white tothe believe one of the five was an informant
. thge tsory ' s backgorund unfolds thru a serieses of flashbacks
, ofthe the crime itself
adn thge meetings between joe
annd teh criminals prior to thge crime
. evenhtually
, blonde arrives witht a police officer hostage
,
and waht follows isnt a truley brutal
, uncomfortable torture scene
. let ' s just say picasso woudl be inpsired by whta blonde does to the cop ' s ear
. a lot ofthe thte time
, reservor dogs seems like your typical gangster heist
- gone
- wrong movie
,
bu htere are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino
. the opening scene in the coffee shop starts yhe movie off on a high onot the rest of it doesn ' t live up to
, as the criminals plus joe ahve a conversation on
, amung other thigns
, tipping philosophies
and their interpretations of madonna ' s
" liek a virgin
.
" another scene involves roth ' s lenghty manufacturedd stoyr about running inot a gropu ofthe cops
and a polical dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag ofthe marijuana
. neither of theese hve much plot relevance
bu are given ample time to deveop
, liuke the captian koons gold watch sprech in pulp fiction
, onyl here these sequences are mroe enjoyable than the rest of tghe movei
. resevoir dogs is good
but it ' s no pulp fiction
.
