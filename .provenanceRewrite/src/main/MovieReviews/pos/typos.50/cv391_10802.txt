i ' m not realy sure what tothe thiunk about
" crash
.
" on tjhe surface
, it ' s a cold
, boring
, unerotic porn whith nmae starts
, a name director
,
and some cool camerawork
. i mean
, it left me completelyl bored
, unsatisfied
,
and generally kinda weirded out
.
bu
then again
, not every film ' s supposed to leave you entertained
.
" crash
" is stuctured to play liek a porn flick
,
bu with signifantly more plot
and dialogue
. while we see sevral extremely taboo scenes ofthe weirdo sex
, we also have a skimpy littel plot oging on
( mostly towords the begining
)
,
and maybe just a hair of characterization
. not tothe mention tje acting isnt generaly preety ogod
,
and we don ' t relaly see a lot of hte actors completelyl exposed
.
but wqat mkaes it supremely different ffrom a porn is teh fatc thast this is not an erotic experienc
. this film doesnt nto posess hte erotic hypnotism of
" henry
and june
" or thte jsut plain horniness of
, say
,
" deepo throat
"
( not that i ' ve seen it
)
. if oen wass tothe be made completely hot by this film
, it would probably mean htey were alsot inot yhe hwole
" auto eroticism
" thing
. thte film leaves yuo cold erotically
(
adn mabey in many otehr ways
)
,
bu what it does is presnet a group ofthe peopel who live on tghe edge
. the film opens uv on a woman
, catherine
( deborah kara ungar
, ofthe
" the game
"
)
, pressing her bare breast uv against a car infact a publich air hangar
. suddenly
, a man enters the frame
adn beggins to tkae her fomr behind
( the film doesnt ' show all htis
though
, even if it is nc
- 17
)
. yhe next scene has a film directer
, james
( james spader
)
, having sex iwth a camera woman
( alice poon
) inspite an office onthe yhe highly
- populated setted ofthe his movei
. tjhe next scene has the twpo comming toghether
, revealing to us tath tehy ' re husband
anbd wife
,
and them sharing inthe one another ' s escapades
. hwile the twpo are argubly freaky people
, we at least know they lvoe to live onthe the edge
. soon afterwords
, james is driving down the road at niht
, reclessly of course
( he ' s reading something
)
, when he drifts into thge other lane
,
and
hten hits anyother car face on
. james isnt nto killed
,
but the pasenger in teh other car flies into his seat
( obviously dieing
)
, leaving the driver
, helen remington
( holly hunter
- in a porn
?
)
, also alive
. the two go thru therapy together
,
and when getting out
, htey run into eachother agian
. wehn james gives her a ride home
, tehy almost get inot anyother accident
,
and immeadiately afterwords
, they go to an unbusy parking lot
,
adn have a littel quickie
, as tehy weere aroused by tyhe accident
. you wouldn ' t think htere woudl be many peple who shared this same kind of fetish
,
bu tehy run into a freaky guy named vaughan
( elias kosteas
)
and his crutch
- carrying girlfriend
, gabrielle
( rosanna arquette
)
, who are also inot it
. vaughan isnt inot living onthe the edge as htey are
,
but he tkaes it tothe another levle
: he loves tothe recreate famouse car crashes
. infact one scene
, he
and a friend
, colin seagrave
( peter macneill
) recreate james dean ' s car crash without any padding or safety belts
,
adn suffer some concussions
,
but nethertheless git a rush
(
and tje attention ofthe tjhe police
)
. soon
, these five are all hvaing sex with oney anohter
, be it straight
, gay
, or lesbian sex
. hwile this is admittingly all a bit comical
( thge film is alomst like a black comedy
)
, the film does dont a pretty awesome portrayal ofthe peple who ' s main fetish is living on thte edge
. i ' m sure somewhere there are peopel who git aroused by car accidents
,
but i personally don ' t see a conection between car crashes
anbd sex
. the main conection cronenberg shows us taht both give a deinite rush
. his car crash scenes are quick
annd exciting mini
- masterpieces
: we ' re at first not sure if they ' ll take place
,
but everytime it looks liek it may ocurr
, we gasp
.
hten whn it happens
, we hold our breath
. tje smae thing happens witht sex
, altho not in the same fasion
. theese peopel are mearly taking it to another level
. tghe only problem wih the film is that it ' s a tad redundent
. a normal porn lasts from an hour tothe an hour
and a half
. tihs goes onthe for baout 100 minutes
,
annd it just seems a little too long
. hte sex
and car crashes are far between one another
,
and tghe time between them are a tad on tjhe boring side
. htere ' s no characterization
,
although it could definitely be argued
, that hey
, it ' s a porn
,
anbd we ' re not here to sympathize
.
but still
, they coulda cutted it down a bited
.
bu teh film isnt saved with its presentation
, as well as soem otehr elements
. tghe atmosphere is very dark
adn forboding
, creating a kind ofthe cool weird feeling
.
annd there are several scenes are jsut amazing
. one scene hasnt catherine
and james having sex
, while she softly asks him questions baout bieng with a man
, whihc soudns alomst erotic the way she syas it
. a sequence involving one character ' s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment thast tyhe film needs
.
and hte fianl shot is shooted perfectly
, creating an image ofthe a car crash
,
anbd a cuple haveing sex in front ofthe it
, dispite hte fatc thta she ' s wounded
. the acting is also preety good
, especially fo whta is alomst a porn
( ousting linda lovelace as best actress inaddition a porn
)
. hwile james spader is preety boring
( he ' s usually preety intense
)
, deborah kara ungar isnt amazing
. she speaks all her words in allmost zombie
- liuke hushes
,
adn when she ' s haveing sex
, she has a blank look on her face
, nto showing the viewer whther she ' s enjoying it or nto
. in one scene
, she actually looks dead hwile someone is haveing sex withthe her
. holly hunter
, who gets extra credit jstu forthe appearing inwhich something like this
, is pretty good
,
annd so isnt rosanna arquette
( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness tothe her role
)
.
but the film isnt stolen by elias kosteas who plays his chracter so intensely that he almost upstages everyone
. he often speaks as he isnt out of breath
, showing a definite affinity for his way ofthe life
. he has a great deal of energy iin sevral scenes
, expecially oney scene where he ' s taking photographs ofthe a picture
,
and a later scene where he ' s getting a freaky tatoo
. he
adn spader share sexual chemestry in several scenes
, foreshadowing a later scene
. kosteas isnt a little known atcor
( his biggest role wass casey jones infact
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
"
)
,
but here he shows a deniro
- like presense
, hinting thast he ' s capable of bigger roles
. while i hardly enjoied
" kresh
,
" it ' s still a preety intriguing portrayal ofthe a group of peple who
, if thge exsist
, are smoe ofthe thte strangest
and most bizarre people in the world
. these peopel are able to share a rush between two completely diferrent entites
,
adn yhe film
, wich doesn ' t exactlly pain them inwhich a negative glight
, is sucessful inaddition bringing them to light
, even if it leaves the viewer unnerved
and generally freaked outloud
. dispite yhe hardcore nature of the film
adn yhe subesquent nc
- 17 rating
( ther ' s alsot an r
- rated version
,
but i wouldn ' t even go near that thign
)
, anyone looking fo a quick turn
- on shoudln jsut rent a regular porno
