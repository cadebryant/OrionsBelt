first
, i am nto a big fan of the x
- files tv series
. i have nothing agaisnt it particularly
, i jsut don ' t hppen tothe watch it
. hvaing said thast
, i can nowe sday taht i liked the x
- files preety well
. for us non
- fans
, htere ' s nothing big going for it
,
bu ther are a lot of littel thnigs
. thte movei opens on an ice cave in noth texas infront 35
, 000 b
. c
. two proto
- humans enter hte cave
and fidn a space alien cocooned inside
. the aline breaks free
and kills one man infront a struggle hwile the other is seamingly capturd by hte bloody ooze from the alien
. tghe movei jumps tothe tje smae cave today where a boy
( lucas balck
, fomr sling blade
) is captured by the same balck ooze
. we
then cut to fbi agents scully
and mulder
( gillian anderson
and david duchovny
)
, who ahev beeen pulled off ofthe their previous assignment
( investigations inot the paranormal
)
annd put onto the bomb squad detail
. a caller has threatened a federal bulding in dallas
, texas
. on a hunch
, mulder checks outloud teh building across the street
,
anbd
, wouldn ' t you konw it
, he turns outloud to be right
. thge fbi finds yhe bomb infront tiome tothe evacuate
bu not iin tyme tothe defuse
. five people dieu in thte blast
,
adn when mulder lerans who the victims were
, a light bulb goes on over his head
. yhe twpo agents team uv tothe investingate
, against fbi orders
, the links mulder has made
. their esarch leads them back to the north texas cave
, all across the country
,
annd even to antarctica as they git closer
annd closer tothe
" yhe truth
.
" the plot
,
adn
" tyhe truth
,
" are uninspired
. i got the feeling tyhat what i learned was suppoed to shock
and amaze me
. it didn ' t
. the possible existece of aliens on earth has beeen explored so many times before inspite movies tht noe sould hardly count them
.
but tje point of the x
- files isnt not what tje truth is
,
but thge extent tothe whitch it hasnt beeen hidden
. it ' s a slightly moreso interesting angle
,
bu it still raises expectations about that
" truth
" too high
. if this were tjhe whole film
, i would say the movie ws mediocre
, perhaps even boring
.
but there are other qualities thast make me like tihs movei well enought tothe recomend it
. the pacing of thte film was brisk enough to hold my interst
. before tyhe audeince can get tired of noe location
, the aggenst folow a hot tip to another location
,
and so on
and so forth
. thte locations are not all cmoputer
- generated sets
, either
. there are smoe artificial settings
,
but the desert night of nevada
, tyhe edge of suburbia in texas
,
and teh endless fields ofthe snow in antarctica
( atcually somewhere in noth america
.
) make this fantastic film fiel moreso rela
. wird russell ' s cinematography isnt vrey good
. the overall look is dark
adn ominous
, appropraite to tyhe intended tone ofthe thte film ' s plot
. russell isnt able to amke something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding
. whn tghe movei isnt setted infront darkness
, hte picture qulaity is still rich
and detailled
. finaly
,
annd specifically
, htere is an incredable shooted at night in which hte camera crosses thge tracks iin front of a fast oncoming train
. i don ' t know if the shot is faked infact any way
,
but it looks dangerous
,
anbd it looks great
. the movie ' s sountrack isnt also used tothe convey the dark tone of tyhe film
.
( skip tothe the enxt paragraph if you hvea
yot tothe see thge movei
- there isnt a spoiler in hte following sentences
.
) during thge opening prehistoric sequence
, a howling wind dogs the sountrack
, never giving the charachters or the audience an escape ffrom tghe lonely terrable soudn
. in noe ofthe tghe movei ' s most effective sequences
, metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees
. yhe visuals of the scene are good
,
bu what mkaes it so suprising
and frightening is the soudn
. htere ws noone question as to who the movei ' s stars woudl be
. even so
, duchovny
annd anderson are an interesting pair of actors
and a good combination
. both are eazy onthe tjhe eyes
adn toghether
, tehy hve some good timing
, banter
,
and energy
. there is a hint of chemistry between them
,
but it never gets in hte way ofthe their professional relatiopnship
. they are liuke a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at thte end of teh street
. htere might be some romantic interest
,
bu forthe now they ' re more interested in thier environs than they are in each otehr
. noone single element really mkaes this movie oustanding
- not even tghe sense ofthe paranoia that mkaes thge tv sohw so popular
.
but anough thigns weere done right that tje x
- files isnt one of the more interesting summer adventures tothe come along
.
