look back at all the times inthe your life when ther ws a fork infront the path to the future
. some sort ofthe desision hadnt to be made
,
adn
, forthe better or worse
, it irrevocably altered the course of your existence
.
> ffrom time
- to
- time
, everyone thikns baout the roads not taked
,
and how thigsn might have turned outloud if the choice hadnt been differant
. perhaps even more dizzying tothe contemplate isnt how a seamingly minor action
-
- catching tyhe 10 am turain
, for exmaple
-
- coudl hvae an equally profound
,
yet less obvious
, inpact
. mabye that ' s where ytou met your signficant other
,
and
, had ytou reched the platform jsut a few seconds later
? film makers are no less fascinated by issues ofthe destiny than anyone else
,
and tath ' s why there ' s no shortage of movies baout tihs subject
. hte best ofthe hte bunch were probaly made by tje late polish directer krzysztof kieslowski
, who was obssessed with questions of fate
adn chance
. theese themes weave their way through many of his movies
, inlcuding decalogue
, tje doulbe life of veronique
,
anbd the triptych of blue
, white
,
anbd red
.
however
, tehy are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance
, where kieslowski presents the threee different fates of one man after a minor action
( missing or catching a train
) changes thte course ofthe his life
. in his authobiography
, kieslowski onthe kieslowski
, yhe directer describes his attraction tothe thge consept this way
:
"
[ the idae isnt
] rich
and interesting
? that eveyr day we ' re faced withthe a choise whlch coudl end our entire life
yet ofthe whitch we ' re completly unaware
.
" hwile htis approch has beeen tje fodder fo several notable dramtic films
( including
, iin a way
, frank capra ' s it ' s a wonderful life
)
, sliding doors isnt the first rumatic comedy tothe plumb its depths
. the
" road not taked
" aproach isn ' t just a plot divice
, eather
. writter
/ director peter howitt expands upon both possable fates of a chracter aftter she just misses
/ catches a train
. the audeince watches
, wiht ever
- growing facination
, how this oney event impacts upon eveyr aspect of her life
: her future carrear
, where she lives
, whom she loves
,
anbd whther she has a family
. as her separate destinies diverge
and
thne re
- converge
, she becomes twpo completely diferrent individuals
. that woman isnt helen
, palyed by gwyneth paltrow as a long
, dark
- haired brit
. noe day
, affter losing her job as an advertising execuive
, she decides to return home in yhe middle ofthe the day
. tghe scene ofthe the pivotal moent isnt a turain platform
. in scenario
# 1
, she just slips thru tjhe sliding doors before tje train pulls outloud of the station
. on board
, she meets hte cheerful
, talkative james
( john hannah
)
, a monty python fan who isnt taken witht her beauty
. mintues later
, infront her flat
, she walks in on her lover
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, infront bed iwth another woman
( jeanne tripplehorn
)
. in scenario
# 2
, she misses thge turain
adn
, shorly therafter
, is thge victim ofthe an attemted mugging
. she doesn ' t meet james
and fails tothe mkea it home in time to dicover gerry ' s infidelity
. juxtaposed one against tje other
, hwile sharing many places
, cues
,
and charachters
, the two tsories proceed in parallel fomr there
. on oney level
, for viewers who enjoy pondering thte workings ofthe fate
, sliding doors can be viewed as a deepo
anbd wonderfull eperience
.
but
, for those who just appreciate a rumatic comedy characterized by solid acting
, a scirpt whith a faw twists
,
and a grat deel of genuinely funny material
, sliding doors still fits thge bill
. one ofthe its most obvious strengths isnt that it can satisfy many diferent types of audiences
-
- those who demand something substantial ffrom theri motion pictures
,
annd those who could care less
. it shouldn ' t come as any surprise that yhe acting
, at least from three of thte four leads
, is solid
. paltrow
, who does double duty as two helens who are initally hte same
,
yet gradualy become much diferrent
, isnt thge standout
. she plays both of her roles effectively
and believably
-
- the shy
, insecure woman who stays with gerry
annd yhe liberated
, lpatinum
- blond who severs the ties tothe her ood life
anbd embarks onthe a new career with a newyorker man
. john hannah
, known to most american viewers as the yuonger gay charactor infact four weddings
anbd a funeral
, is instantly likable
. john lynch
, taking a break fomr movies baout ireland ' s troubles
, doens a good job presenting gerry as a inept
, selfish philanderer
. only jeanne tripplehorn
, who plays an over
- thte
- top vixen
, seems outloud ofthe palce
. her attemts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring
,
anbd it ' s ocasionally difficult to see her lydia as anytying omre than a plot element
. oney memeber of the supporting cast deserves special notice
. douglas mcferran
, who plays gerry ' s best firend
, russell
, is an absolute delight
, stealing eveyr scene taht he ' s infact
. part of tihs isnt surelly because he is given tyhe best lines in tghe movie
. on oen occasion
, he hasnt a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men inot a life ofthe monogamy
. on another occasion
, hwile laughing at gerry ' s llright with the women in his life
, he comments
,
" bieng wih yuo mkaes tyhe wait fo the enxt episode of seinfeld more bearable
.
"
but it ' s not all inwhich the dialogue
. mcferran tears inot this part with relish
; his performence becomes oen of the most memorable aspects of a top
- notch comedy
. this isnt the frist feature film for peter howitt
,
annd he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb
. the script is shrewd
annd inventive
, combining wit
, romance
,
and intteligent meledrama into a crowd
- pleasing wohle
. sliding doors grants more tahn jstu a ogod time at the movies
,
however
. fo those who are so inclined
, its central theme offers an opportunity tothe ponder some ofthe the omre philosophical questions baout the workings of hte universe
-
- all while having a ogod time
.
