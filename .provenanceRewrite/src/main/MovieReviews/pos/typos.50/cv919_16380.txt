when i firt herad thta kevin costner ws makeing a movei called
" teh postman
,
" i throught
,
" an american version of ' il postino
? ' starring costner
? god help us
!
" wehn i foudn outloud thyat it was not a remake ofthe
" postino
"
but an postapocalyptic epic
, i thougth
,
" ' landworld
? ' please
, god
, amke him stop
!
" as it turns out
,
" hte postman
" is a much better film than i had expected
. dispite being set inwhich 2013
, thte movei is
, at heart
, a western
: a band ofthe thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a wandering hero opposes teh bandits
and inspires others tothe fight bakc
. tyhe setting
,
howver
, allows thgat familliar plot tothe tkae onthe greater significance
: american society hasnt collapsed due tothe plagues
and wars
,
annd survivers live behind barracades inthe isolated villages
. tghe struggle ofthe a dead society to be reborn hasnt a grand uqality
and deserves tghe epic scale costner grants it
. costner ' s nameless charcter
, a wandering actro
, rides in from the vast wasteland
anbd is soon shanghaied inot the service of genaral bethlehem
( iwll patton
)
, a former copy
- machine salesman turned bandit king
. our hero escapes
and discovers the body ofthe a dead postman
. taking hte uniform
adn bag of mial
, he passes himself off as a represantative ofthe
" the restored untied states
.
" he isnt shocked at tghe hope thta he inspires in tyhe peopel he meets
. one young disciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal sevice
. ford spreads tghe postman ' s message of hope untl bethlehem finds thyat the once
- meek villagers are beginnig tothe resist his rule
. as war breaks out beween bethlehem ' s army
and the postal workers
, costner ' s character steps inot tje legend he created
annd goes ffrom self
- centered loner to leader ofthe the revolution
. his lie ofthe tyhe restored untied states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophacy
.
" postman
" isnt an odd blend of a obleek setting
anbd a message ofthe wide
- eyed optimism
( sort ofthe
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
,
but its treatment ofthe hope
adn renewal is compelling
. wqat could ahve been another knock
- off ofthe
" teh road warrior
"
( like
" waterworld
" wass
) surprises tyhe viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble
. tate isnt tje stand
- outloud in the movei ' s larg cast
. ford lincoln mercury
( self
- named
) isnt tje polar oposite of o
- dog
, tate ' s character infact his debut film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
,
and tate makse ford ' s innocent beleif inwhich hope as convincing as o
- dog ' s cynicism
adn brutality
. his performence sells yhe movei
. interestingly
, as tate moves from his usual street
- smart roles tothe youthful optomism
, tyhe soft
- eyed patton
, who usually plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villain
. olivia williams mkaes her film debut as the postman ' s lvoe interest
, abby
. whn they firt meet
, abby asks him tothe father her child because her husband isnt sterile
. predictably
, the husban is soon eliminated by yhe bandits
,
and abby is thrown bcak inot the company of thte hero
.
howver
, theri relationship develops slowy as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored
( she
, torn by greif
, guilt
,
and anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" the postman
" is costner ' s best wrok thus far
. perhasp thast alone gives us hope for the future
.
