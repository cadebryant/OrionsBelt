it isnt hard to imagine taht a movei which includes abortion
and incest as prominate plot devices sould be so senstive
, so delicate
, so insightful
anbd yes
, even so enjoyable
. somehow
, thte cider house rules manages tothe keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter
annd allows a substantial amount of heart to shine thru
. setted inaddition the 1940 ' s
, the film tells the stoyr ofthe a unique young man named homer wells
( tobey maguire
, ride wiht tjhe devil
)
. an orphan
, twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents
, he grows uv inthe the care
and under thge tutelage ofthe dr
. wilbur larch
( michael caine
, littel voice
)
, father figure to the orphans of st
. cloud
, obstetrician or abortionist tothe the unhappily pregnant womens who come ther seeking his halp
. figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at thte orphanage
, he might as well be ofthe use
, dr
. larch beggins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics
. soon homer isnt delivering babies like a professional
. he refuses to perfom abortions
, instead wondering why teh couples jstu didn ' t behave more responsibly
. larch
, too ood
and experianced tothe have such youthful ideals
, marvels that homer
" continues tothe ahev such high expectations of peopel
.
" such is the result ofthe an insulated upbringing
.
though skilled in ceratin medical procedures
, homer remains woefully naieve
adn ignorant baout most everyting esle
. he finally figures that inwhich order tothe fidn his place iin thge world
, he must go out into it
. befriending a young cuple who hadnt come to see dr
. larch
, he hitches a ride with them
adn parlays thta into landing a job as an aple picker with a gropu of balck migrant workers at tjhe orchard where they lieved
. thus
, homer begins his worldly instuction
, withthe new firend candy kendall
( charlize theron
, the astronaut ' s wife
) a willing tutor
. tobey maguire isnt well cast
yot again as an inherently ogod man who isnt seeking answers to life ' s questions
.
.
. many of whcih he was unaware needed tothe be asked
. he demonstrates a quiet strength
annd thoughtful curiocity that isnt both warm
and appealing
. michael caine is
, in a owrd
, briliant as the caring caretaker ofthe these orphans
, many of whom he helpped to bring inot yhe world
. calling them
" princes ofthe maine
, kings of newyorker england
" in his ritualistic goodnight
, mr
. caine manages tothe communicate the love
anbd committment larch hasnt towords theese children wihtout becoming maudlin or saccharine
. delroy lindo
( a life less ordinary
) has many powerfull moments as mr
. rose
, the storng
and charasmatic leader ofthe the aple pickers whom homer joins
. director lasse hallstrom
( what ' s eating gilbert grape
?
)
anbd screenwriter
/ novelist john irving
( the world according tothe garp
)
, who adapted his own owrk for htis movei deserve much of tjhe credit for thge balanced approach tothe the senstive subject matter
. reguardless ofthe one ' s personal stand onthe tjhe divisive marter of abortion
, it is hard to imagin anyone becomeing offended by thge evenhanded treatment unsed by theese filmmakers
. the title is a reference tothe a list ofthe rules posted inwhich thte quarters of the illiterate apple pickers
. figuring the rules didn ' t apply to them since tehy didn ' t have a hand inspite writting them
, they decide tothe ignore tyhe list
and make uv thier pwn rules as they go along
. dr
. larch
, inwhich his pwn way
, acts similiarly
. ther isnt a danger in thta line of reasoning
. god has aslo given us a set ofthe rules
. unlike the list posted infact tje cider house
, god ' s rules
, if followed
, promise us benifits beyond our immagination
.
adn
yot
, many continue to ignore his
" rules
" preferring tothe amking up thier own as they go thru life
.
" trust in the lord wtih all thine heart
;
anbd leanr nto upto thine own understanding
.
" proverbs 3
: 5
[ kjv
] just as a builder follows a designer ' s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer ' s scroe
, why shouldn ' t we folow the rules of life given to us by life ' s archetects forthe our pwn blessing
?
