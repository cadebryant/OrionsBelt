.
.
. critique
: htere ' s a palce inspite our world forthe
" stupid comedies
"
. films whihc don ' t pretend to tkae themselves seriously
, are based on idiotic premises
and filled whith dumb jokes
. there ' s also a time for them
and many would argue that thsi difficult period of our history
, might be an ideal cercomstance during which tothe
" relax
" by watching something so completely frivolous
. well
, if you ' re in the mood fo soem seriously mindless entertainment
, ben stiller
adn his casted of many have assembled one of the mroe original dumb comedies in some time
. of course
, comedies as such are ususally vyer subjective
and i could see how some will see thsi film simply as stupid
annd unfunny
, hwile others will grant them the
" stupid
"
,
bu consider it funny instade
. i personally enjoyed it for the most part
, cracked up loudly during a cuple of specific sequences
adn loved thge derek zoolander character
adn tyhe unrestrained whipping they released apon hte fashion industry
. snap
! it was also nice tothe see several real
- life models wiht small roles in tghe movei
, not tkaing themselfs too seriously
.
annd if yuo ' re thte type of person who likes celebrity cameos inaddition films
, well
, don ' t look any furhter beccause dozens ofthe famous faces show uv here including vince vaughn
, billy zane
, winona ryder
, christian slater
, david duchovny
, natalie portman
and many
, many others
. i especially liked andy dick ' s complet make
- over as the masseuse
. hi
- larious
!
bu witht all films of tihs type
, ther is binded to be some stuff that simply doesn ' t owrk
. a few particulars hwihc didn ' t strike my fancy included the bulimia
anbd
" orgy
" sequence with christine taylor
, teh break
- dance fighting
,
adn i also never get why tehy uise real countries inspite plots like this
( why not jstu
" mkea uv
" a country
, instade of zeroing inspite onthe a ceratin peple
?
)
. i also coudl hvae done withthe less ofthe the taylor character iin general
, usance she wasn ' t all tht interesting
adn seemed to slow thigns down every now
anbd
then
( moreso zoolander
, dued
!
)
.
but thsoe few missteps weere nothing compaired to some ofthe the more memorable scenes which definitly doed work for me
! i alomst pissed mysef druing thte
" gas staion
" disaster
, absolutely adored the
" walk
- off
" contest
( iwth david bowie as the judge
, noone less
)
anbd appreciated many ofthe zoolander ' s moronic one
- liners
(
" i ws a merman
.
.
. a merman
!
!
"
)
.
and i dabree you tothe get his
" monkey
" photo shoot outloud ofthe your head affter seing this movei
(
" you ' re a monkey
, derek
.
.
. a monkey
!
"
) i alsot really liked thte soundtrack
and tyhe pace ofthe the film
, both ofthe wich zipped
and zagged
,
and estalbished a nice ryhthm tothe it all
. again
, it ' s to note that this movei isnt dumb
adn not forthe everyone
,
bu my guess is that if you laughed at yhe trailer
, ytou will likely enjoy many of yhe quips inspite teh actual picture as well
. if you thougth teh trailer ws dumb
, skip htis dodo bird
adn go rent austin powers again or something
, a film fomr which there isnt an obvious influence here
. blue steel
, baby
.
.
