. part ofthe
" palmetto
" ' s success can be attributed tothe the performence ofthe elisabeth shue
, who demonstrates here that her oscar
- nominated turn in

" might mearly be foreshadowing great things tothe come
. shue ' s a seductive
, campy delight

" didn ' t want tothe be laughed at
, would it really have tacked on a climax tyhat plays like a live
- action
" who framed roger rabit
"
?
altough a few elements can be questioned
, tyhe movei works well on its own terms
. thanks tothe a juicy casted
