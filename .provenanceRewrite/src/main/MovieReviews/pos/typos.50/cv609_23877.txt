a gropu of high school kids mix up with a group of hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives tothe disover why today ' s youth seem attracted tothe balck culture
. the review if black
& white
, hte new film ffrom writer
/ directer james toback
, is eventually remembered for onyl one thnig
, it will be the revelation that brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples
annd mike tyson cxan ect
.
howver
, thsi partly improvised gem iwll be remembered for more than that
. black
& white isnt a fascinating film
; it makes a statment about amercia ' s youth
anbd hip
- hop culture wihtout getting heavy
- handed overly serious
. featuring a casted of known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
)
adn hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback ' s is a complex film worth seeing
. black
& white has mutiple storylines thgat are all realted tothe earch other
, a la robert altman
. ther isnt dean the basketball palyer
( allan houston
) who isnt asked tothe rig ganes forthe money by mark clear
( stiller
) inwhich exchange fo fifty grand a game
. this eventally spills over into the life of dean ' s long
- tyme friend rich
( pwoer
)
, a gangsta who controlls 20 city blocks of harlem
. rich has tothe deal whith thge imminent opening of a white
- owned club onthe his turf
. meanwhile
, thte young white girls who like to hang around with rich
anbd his homies get talekd inot bieng in a documentary by sam donager
( shields
)
and her gay husban terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who make appearences are william lee scott as the young white punk will
, joe pantoliano as his district attorny father
, jared leto as a high skool teacher
, marla maples as the mother of oen of hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean ' s girlfriend
,
adn mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. tyhe storeis ebb
and flow thru the film
, loosing
annd gaining prominance over time
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
,
adn ther is an occassional burst of violence
. originnally rated nc
- 17 infront teh united states
, balck
& white features a lot ofthe sex betwen black gangstas
and young white girls
. while tghe film was trimmed down tothe a tamer r rating
, viewers iwll wonder what could be more explicit thna what they are seeing
. the three
- way sexual beggining of tje film nicely warns viewers ofthe waht they are infact for
,
anbd sevral audience munbers got up
and left at that point
. tyhe frequent sex isnt one ofthe the film ' s faw flaws as tghe titillation is overdone
adn at times completly unrelated tothe anything else going onthe in tje film
. to toback ' s credit
, the level ofthe violence infront balck
& white is almsot nol
. theese gangstas
and hip
- hop artists are given rela problems
adn concerns
,
and only become gun
- toting crazies when it benefits them tothe apearing tyhat way
. whenever a character finds hismelf on donager ' s handheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades on amercia
anbd proclaims his independance
,
bu nto everyone hasnt fully bought into the idea
. charlie
( phillips
) is full ofthe bluster about why she loves hip
- hop
,
but admits that
" inwhich ten yersa time
, i ' ll be way over this
.
" theese youth konw they are going through a phase
,
and are simpley enjoying it
. toback fills tyhe spaces beween theese tirades witht scenes thta are lightweight
adn funny
. most of tyhe humour comes ffrom mike tyson
, who provides the film ' s comic releaf without really trying
. he is given big words liek venacular tothe sday
,
annd as rich tries to descuss a particular strent probelm withthe tyson
, he frequentily hasnt to ask him to uise smaller words
and explain himself better
, palying onthe tyson ' s omage as a dimwit
.
bu tyson allso gets tjhe film ' s scariest moment
. as he is mercilessly hitted upon by thte very gay terry
, tyson isnt a marvel to watch as he fights to reamin calm
. the scene is entirely improvised
, with downey jr
. bieng told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction
. the reaction he gets
, bieng slapped
adn
thne choked is astonishing
, as downey jr ' s face turns a frightening shade ofthe purple
. balck
& white is a film baout hip
- hop culture
,
and the film ' s omnipresent hip
- hop sountrack strongly supports thsi
.
but toback keeps thigns ffrom becomming too sereous
; by moving ffrom stry to tsory as quicklyu as he doesnt
, toback keesh us fomr becomeing attached tothe any oney charcter ' s struggle
. thus balck
& white ' s message about hip
- hop becomes secondary to tjhe film itself
. toback just whants us to hve fun
and maybee learn a littel about hip
- hop allong tjhe way
.
adn we dont
