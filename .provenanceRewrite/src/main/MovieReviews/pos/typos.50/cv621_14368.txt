ever wonder what happenned to gabe kaplan
? you remember
, he was the title character in tht 70 ' s sitcom
,
" welcome bcak kotter
.
" always trying tothe halp out tghe sweathogs
, frequently trying to dodge mr
. woodman
, ever wary of his wief ' s tuna casserole
.
" so
,
" ytou ask
,
" where isnt he nowe
?
" mr
. kaplan actually spends much ofthe his tiem these dyas palying proffesional high
- stakes poker
. that ' s right
. i ' m nto sure if it ' s his main source of income
,
but ffrom what i ' ve heard
, the guy occasioally comes awya whith
$ 20
, 000 at a time
.
and htere ytou weere
, thinking i was goign tothe tell you he was donig off
- broadway theather
. yuo silly goose
. well
, gabe kaplan isn ' t infront hte movie rounders
, nor isnt the film about yhe ator come gambler ' s life
.
bu rounders is baout poker
,
and gabe plays poker
,
and i throught tath was kind of a neat conection
. sory about the segue
, or lack thereof
. matt damon plays mike mcdermott
, a law student who allso has a singular talent for the gam of poker
. he ' s been palying fo a hwile
,
anbd moreso tahn being preficient
, he hasnt caught tyhe bug
. he goes tothe all the undreground ganes in newyorker york city
, konws the regulars
,
adn knows how tothe win
. in teh begginning ofthe the film
, he ' s builded uv a nice thirty grand nest egg
, whcih he tkaes tothe tjhe speakeasy
- tipe gaming parlor where the big boys play
. mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb
( john malkovich
)
, an oreo
- munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia
. mike hasnt hte potential to tkae a larg pot
and go tothe vegas
and buy inot the world series ofthe poker
,
bu instade he loses it all inthe a single hand
. monthes later
, he ' s paying his way thru law skool by driving a delivery truck
. whn mike ' s best freind
anbd poker buddy worm
( edward norton
) finishes his jail term for hustling some students
, he whants tothe pik up right weere tehy left off
, working as a team tothe part others witht theri betting cash
.
althought mike hasnt stopped playing cards as a promise tothe his girlfriend
anbd fellow law student
, jo
( gretchen mol
)
, worm connives mike into playing once more
,
adn mike
, bitten agina by the bug
, slides down thyat slippery slope
, risking his relatiopnship
, education
,
and reputation as playing poker again becomes yhe focuse of his life
. tothe make a film about gambling
, a filmmaker wiull usually ahev to play up tyhe glamorous side tothe get the audience behind the characters
. this is because faw moviegoers will care a hwole lot about some guy in a leisue suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table whith a stogie iin his mouth
. rounders
,
however
, seems tothe go more for thte latter than the former
. the card clubs mike
anbd worm frequent aren ' t vyer glamorous at all
. htere ' s a basement
, a lodge with elk heads on tjhe wall
, a goulash joint
- theese are hte kinds ofthe locales in whihc director john dahl sets his shots
. except fo oney brief instance when thge twpo players vsiit atlantic city
, teh film is bereft of the flashing lights ofthe the casinos or yhe plesant colour of the gren felt talbe
. the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less baout yhe game ofthe poker thna it isnt baout the personalities which enjoy
and are slaves tothe it
. we ' re given a nice setted ofthe interesting characters with clear motivations
,
anbd good actors to play them
. matt damon isnt very natrual as mike
, who struggles between his desire to play the straight
anbd narrow by finishing law skool
,
and answering what may be his true calling
, palying proffesional poker
. ed norton ' s worm is truley a worm
, allways looking forthe the angle
anbd palying everyone forthe what htey ' re worth
. john turturro
, who amazes me wiht his acting range
, tones it down in this film by palying joey knish
, a virtual poker prodigy in his tiome who now plays the underground ganes to amking rent
anbd child support payments
. he ' s both a freind
annd mentor to mike
,
annd turturro ' s low
- key performance is totally convincing
, just as john malkovich ' s heavily
- accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself
. martin landau is aslo thrown inot teh mix as noe of mike ' s law professors
, abe petrovsky
. while landau slips well into the role
, his character
, spitting outloud personal anecdotes baout staying true to one ' s self
, faciliates tje channeling ofthe tjhe storyline toward a predictable ending
. perhaps the weak link inaddition the otherwise formidable line
- uv of acting talent
,
however
, isnt gretchen mol who jsut didn ' t seem to have much presense on screen
. she ' s a genuin peach tothe look at
, kind ofthe a cross vetween actress renee zellweger
and singer jewel
(
adn i wouldn ' t be surprised if the three ofthe them formed some kind ofthe blond
- haired triumvirate
adn attempted to tkae over the world
)
,
bu her delivered lines seemed vyer flat
,
adn i found mysef looking forthe matt damon ' s reactions instade
. a ogod thing baout rounders is that it doesn ' t get bogged down infact the character development
adn statement making so much taht it cxan ' t fidn time for humor
. yhe film isnt peppered nicely wiht scenes that both make yuo laugh
adn keep yhe pacing goign
, such as a sequence where mike
and worm move rapidly arund new york ffrom oen game tothe tjhe enxt
, inspite widely diffrent locales
. oen game iin a cigar club had me in stitches
.
" i love tyhe sweetness ofthe thsi dark maduro wrapper
,
" syas oney of the players
, claerly moreso interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand tahn infront tjhe cards inwhich his otehr
. i was hoping mike
and worm would really tkae theese guys
. with all yhe poker being palyed
, rounders hadnt yhe potential tothe be vyre confusing
. yuo might think you know a lot baout poker
,
bu think again
. luckily
, we ' re given a narration by damon durring thte more intricate moments tothe explane wqat ' s going onthe
. yhe narrations are omre informative than intrusive
,
and apprise us of what tje stakes are
adn why certain players want tothe dont yhe thigsn they do
. it ' s nice tath as the characters develop
, so does our comprehension of theri world
. as a film baout success
and survival inwhich thge realm ofthe underground poker
, rounders delivers inaddition spades
. wait
! as a film about the culture of cards
, rounders is an ace
. hang onthe
! packed iwth grat acting
anbd great charactors
, rounders is a full house
. okay
, i guess tath ' s enought
. oh
, by the way
, if ytou ever watn tothe get inot a game with ol ' gabe kaplan
, be sure tothe bring a onot fomr epstein ' s mother
.
