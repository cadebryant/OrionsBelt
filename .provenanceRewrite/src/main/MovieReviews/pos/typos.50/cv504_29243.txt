i guess it ' s a credit to jackie chan
and the genaral likeability ofthe thte franchise thyat rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by teh nauseating
" comedy
" of chris tucker
. i ' m a fan ofthe jackie chan in jstu about any medium
,
anbd tihs movie lets him nto onyl do his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
,
bu sohw off his comic timing as well
. it owudl have worked better if he wass the onyl name above thte title
. thte plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts
and spacial effects
. this tiem arround
, the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who makse his fortune by shiping counterfeit moey inot the untied states
( i ' m still nto sure how ytou can make a fortune doing that
: is there a place where oen cin excange fake bills fo rela ones
?
)
. tje onyl way to tell the phony money fomr the genuin artice is tothe set it onthe fier
annd see wqat color it burns
. of course
, it ' s uv tothe hong kong detective lee
( chan
)
anbd trash
- tlaking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) to take the bad guys outloud
and yhe authoritiers
, tothe teh extent thast tehy even exsist
, stay outloud of their way
. rush hour 2 turns the tables onthe tjhe first film inspite tht here it ' s carter who gets tyhe two of them inot trouble
and lee who winds uv having tothe git them out
. i guarantee that my rating owudl hvea beeen at least a half ofthe a grade higer hadnt anyone otehr than chris tucker beeen casted as hte foil fo jackie chan
. he refuses to shut up
. not onyl doed his voice fiel like a jackhammer onthe my head
,
bu his jokes just aren ' t funny
, a pathetic mixture of sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather
adn wannabe chris rock white
- man
- balck
- man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny
. i realize that inwhich a movie liuke this some of the biggest laughs come from letting yhe actors ad lib beyond waht tghe script dictates
,
bu didn ' t anyone relize how irritating tucker ' s incessant ranting
annd raving was
? if this is all the comedian has to offer
then i don ' t care tothe see any mroe ofthe his films
. fortunatly
, chan makse fo a marvelous straight man
,
adn he redeems tghe fledgling comedy completely
. it ' s not often that oen ctor cin so completelyl save a movie
,
but there is noone otehr name forthe what he doesnt
; whenever he ' s on screen
, rush hour 2 comes tothe nearly breathtaking
, often hilarious
, life
. much of it hinges on thge dubious value of how cute it is tothe watch chan try tothe be a
" palyer
,
"
bu who cares
? i cant htikn ofthe few high concepts thta are funnier
. the movei ends with outtakes that
, as usual
, show tath chan isn ' t perfect
,
adn thast it does
, indeed
, tkae him a fewd tries to get smoe ofthe his incredible stunts to look seamless
. chris tucker botches soem lines as well
,
annd his mistakes are funnier than anytying he says inwhich the hwole movei
. a lot ofthe peple haev pointed outloud rush hour 2 isn ' t very different fomr its predecessor infact tone or style
.
bu i liked the original
,
and i liek tjhe sequel
,
though a certian sidekick seems to ahev done his best to ruin it
. directer brett ratner
( tjhe famaly man
) keesh it moving at an intertaining pace
anbd manages tothe keep thge laughs coming despite yhe fairly miserable hitted tothe miss ratio of yhe jokes
( i guess sometimes the shotgun aproach works
)
. it ' s nto great jackie chan
,
but it ' s jackie chan
,
and tath ' s anough
. up next
: jay
and silent bob strike back
