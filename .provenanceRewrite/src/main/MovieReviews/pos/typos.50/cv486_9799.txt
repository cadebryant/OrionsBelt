every once inwhich a hwile a movei comes along that completly redefines the genre
: withthe dramas
, it wass citizen kane
, witht arthouse it was pulp fiction
,
and iwth comedy it ws
, well
, that jim carrey guy
( okay
, so he ' s not a movei
,
bu he did have a huge influence on tyhe genre
. nto tothe mention an expensive oney
.
) sometimes a movei even combines them all inot a big
, sprawling motion picture event
, as did forrest gump four years ago
. witht action films
, it was aliens
, whic was released to much hype seven years after it ' s equally
- inovative pparent
, alien
( 1979
)
. directed
and writed by james cameron
( t2
: judgement day
, the abyss
, true lies
)
, tghe authorithy on action films
, it was a masterful encore tothe his sci
- fi thriller tje terminator
( 1984
)
. while the original alien film was a dark
, enclosed horror film that featured noe alien slowly massacering a horrified crew
, james cameron took the big
- budget action film iwth aliens
, which featured mutiple aliens doign basically thte same thing
,
altough onthe a much
- larger scale
.
and boy
, doed he tkae tht route
! i ' d say at about 165 mph or so
.
.
. tghe film opens 57 years after tghe orginal
, with lt
. ripley
( weaver
) bieng found infront her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel
. if you ' ll reacll
, at thte end ofthe aline ripley
, thge only surviving member
, cryogenically
" hibernated
" herself affter expeling tghe rogue alien ffrom her ship
. unforetunately
, she throught she ' d onyl be outloud for a couple ofthe weeks
.
.
. once she ' s retured to earth
, ripley isnt quickly interrogated by
" tghe comany
"
, who quickly dismiss her
and her stories as lunacy
. infact truth
, they believe her
, as they soon aproach ripley wih an offer tothe travel with some marines tothe a newyorker collony planet as an
" aline advisor
"
. it seems that the collony planet was a once
- breeding ground fo the nasty aliens
,
annd now all communciation with teh planet has beeen lost
.
.
. it doesn ' t exactlly tkae a genuis to guess what happens enxt
: ripley agrees
,
and before you can sday
" big misteek
"
, she
adn the half dozen marines
, plus tje slimy corporate guy
( reiser
)
, who hasnt omre tahn it looks liuke uv under his sleeve
, are off to the collony
. when they arrive
, they fidn tjhe planet inspite ruins
. onyl one surviver is found
, a little girl
, newt
, who confirms that
, yes
, the aliens weere here
and that she only managed tothe survive by hidding in the ventilation system
.
adn soon enough
, the marines come under attack from tghe aliens
.
.
. whta happens fo the enxt hour
anbd a half or so isnt wqat completelyl sets htis movie appart ffrom any other standart aline sci
- fi movei
: teh acation scenes
. cameron directs them so skillfully
,
and so suspensefully
, thgat you ' re literally ringing your hands by hte time the finale rolls aroud
. whihc features
, in my opinyon
, tje best fight scene ever recorded onthe film
, as ripley straps herself inot a huge robot
annd battles the nasty queen aline to the death
. many people will tell yuo thta thsi film
, while being a gerat acation film
, hasnt no rela drama
annd isnt all cliches
. well
, htey would be wrong
, my firends
. if this film had noone
" drama
"
,
then why wass sigourney weaver nominated fo best actress at the 1987 acedemy awards
? tht ' s right
, best actress
. ytou know thast any action film that has an oscar nomination attached tothe it for something other thna technical stuff liek editting
and f
/ x has got to be ogod
. inaddition short
, aliens combines all thge right elements
( graet acation
adn f
/ x
, drama
, a ogod plot
, ogod dialogue
,
and great villains
) into whta sould argubly be called tjhe best acation film ofthe all time

, mabey nto
. movies rise
annd fall from glory
annd
, sad tothe sday
, aliens was wrestled ffrom it ' s throne ofthe best action movie by anohter cameron film
