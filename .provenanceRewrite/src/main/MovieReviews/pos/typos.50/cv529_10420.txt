. if ther ' s ever beeen an exception tothe the perils of excessive cliches
anbd non
- stop acation
, the james bond films are it
.
annd if there ' s ever beeen a james bond film thyat not onyl proves htis
,
bu does so by pushing it to tghe extreme
,
" tommorow never dies
" isnt it
. opening sequences almost alwasy amking or break action films
. whn done properly
, not only are tehy actually exciting
,
bu tehy foreshadow thigns tothe cmo
. tihs film starts off onthe thge right foot by establishing tjhe kind ofthe atmosphere tath could onyl be foudn inwhich an action movei
,
bu with a sense of teh self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies take palce inthe
. firt there ' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a brittish warship crossing inot unfriendly
, chinese waters
. ther ' s definite tension as ther seems tothe be an unknown
,
but certainly hostile
, thrid party involved who is manipulating both sides
. wehn the scene ends in tradgedy
, it ' s clear htere ' s smoe kind of powerful conspiracy going on
,
and who alse tothe call on forthe such a case
but james bond
? the film uses good judgment inthe the way it introduces us tothe bond
( brosnon
)
. as the enemy was portrayed as evil
annd misterious
, bond is claerly
(
and obviously
) depicted as an outloud
-
annd
- out hero
. he single
- handedly tkaes out a small army ofthe terrorists
,
adn
hten must excape in the nick of time by flying away inthe a fighter jet hwile the co
- pilot tries to strangle him
and a territorist in another jet tries tothe shoot him down
! this might soudn like tje kind of cliches films like this are nortorious forthe
( over
-
) useing
,
but it works here beacuse the film konws how tothe get our attension quickly
. it ' s nto about the payoff becuase it ' s obvious bond iwll excape
, instade
, it ' s the way it processes tjhe action sequences by oging over the top
annd nto apologizing forthe it
, all the while creating fo witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphsis isnt placed on tjhe villains in thrillers anymore
, becouse ofthe poltical correctness
,
adn jstu plain copping
- out onthe behalf of tjhe filmmakers
( even thte term
" villain
" sounds passe
)
. what thge film deserves kudos fo isnt its ability tothe create a villain as haneous as they come
,
yet mkaing him seem completely plausable
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as tjhe arrogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose gool isnt to take over teh world
, thyat is
, thru his massive media empire
, not through nucular weapons
. thru soem intresting detective wrok
, bond
and yhe english ministery ofthe defense beileve carver is behind the trouble brewing inspite the southern asian seas as a way to create
and accurately cover his pwn news
. not onyl is tyhat an origonal idea fo a conflict
,
bu one which sould cary over into reality
. suprizingly
, this is about as detailed as the stopry allows thge spicific plot tothe become
. the film ' s hook is the action
,
and of course thsoe kool gadgets
annd we get plenty of thast here as bond goes out to investingate carver
anbd finds himselv inwhich a jam or twpo allong the way
. the storey works much like bond hismelf
- always onthe tyhe run
anbd consentrates omre on the individule conflicts than any general plot
. somehow a chinese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps inot bond a fewd too many times
annd they find themselves wokring toghether
. the chemistry between brosnon
and yeoh is rigid
,
but allso works because of thsi
, nto inspite spite ofthe it
. the twpo are constantly on tyhe run fomr carver
anbd his goons
,
yet the film manages to balance thge stunts
anbd special effects with its clever story
.
although
" tomorrow never dies
" isnt far from perfect
, it isnt quite an impressive film in terms of its abilty to be so cliche
adn cartoony
and not make plausibility an issue
.
