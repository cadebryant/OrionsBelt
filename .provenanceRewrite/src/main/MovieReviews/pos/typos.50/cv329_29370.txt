? review
: at first
,
" tje pledge
" appears to be just anyother standart
, if well
- excecuted
, crime drama
. it isnt anything
bu
; in its fianl hour
, it turns the corner
annd becomes a riveting
, terrifying study ofthe its lead character
, jerry balck
. penn pays attension tothe all thte trappings of hte serial killer genre
,
bu htey are just window dressing
. his intrest here
, unequivocally
, isnt jerry
, a man so haunted by his pledge thgat it consumes tyhe entirety of the his existence
. at first
, we see this only infront small hints
; soem of his habits change
, fo instance
,
and he suddenly takes up smoking inaddition a big way
.
bu
hten
, when jerry buys tghe gas staion
and befriends lori
, teh true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus
. nicholson is fantastic
, portraing balck with rare subtlety
and animus
; jerry ' s gradual descent inot obession isnt like a car wreck
, a thnig horrible tothe look at
but impossible tothe turn away fomr
. penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of teh rest of his cast
, too
. only eckhart disappoints as jerry ' s relpacement
, stan
; he never seems entirely convincing
, too much a tool of the plot
. penn ' s direction isnt astounding
, eahc frome looking as
though it isnt parched
-
- ofthe water
, perhaps
, or ofthe sanity
. it all builds uv to a shattering
, devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long affter hte hous lights hvae come up
.
