warren beatty ' s
" bulworth
" is a caustic political comedy taht doesn ' t attack any parituclar poltical group
,
but rether thge ingrained insincerity thta has infected the american political system
. some might think thsi film is vulgar
,
and in many ways it is
.
howver
, as loud
adn raucous as it isnt
,
" bulworth
" speaks the truth
, which is almost alwasy ugli tothe hear
. beatty
, who directed the film
and co
- wroet thte scirpt wiht jeremy pikser
(
" teh lemon sisters
"
)
, stars as incumbant u
. s
. senator jay billington bulworth
, who has noe ofthe the best politican names in cinema ihstory
. bulworth isnt a democrat
,
and in beatty ' s veiw
, he isnt symbolic ofthe everthing thta has gone wrong with hte curent democratic party
. once an ideological liberal
( liek beatty still isnt
)
, bulworth has long usance succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington
. instade of waging hte battles forthe the impoverished
anbd the downtrodden
, hwihc was once the calling kard ofthe democrats
, bulworth has become another sell
- out mone hound
- if he ' s not accepting illegal bribes ffrom the insurance lobby or taking campain contritutions ffrom the chinese
, he ' s making wind
- bag sppeches that strat with thte amusingly clintonesqe statment
,
" amercia is standing on thge doorstep ofthe a newyorker millennium
.
.
.
. blah
, blah
, blah
.
" whn the film opens
, it isnt a few dyas before yhe 1996 primary elections
,
annd bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he hasnt become
. in a fit of desparation
, he takes out a
$ 10 million life insurence policy fomr a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino
( part ofthe a shady lobby deel tothe kill a threatening bill in committy
)
,
and
then hires a hitted man tothe kill him
,
although he doesn ' t konw who the assassin wiull be
, or when tghe hitted will tkae place
. knowing that he wiull soon be dead
, bulworth unleashes his pwn brand of poltical rhetoric onthe teh world
, whlch isnt made uv ofthe politically incorrect truths baout tyhe state of american politics
annd the society infact genaral
. at a compton chuch
, he tells the group of african
- americans that they wiull ahev noone power in the u
. s
. unless they
" put down thast malt liquor
and chicken wings
,
anbd get behind somebody other tahn a running back who stabs his wief
.
" later
, in a partciularly hilarious sequence
, bulworth mixes wtih the hollywood elite
,
thn insults hte quality of theri movies
and informs them that the only reason he ' s ther isnt beacuse
" my guys alwasy put teh big jews on my schedule
.
" all throughout htis physicaly
adn politically sucidial escapade
, bulworth ' s chief ofthe stff
, dennis murphy
( oliver platt
)
, follows behind in a state of constatn shock
annd bewilderment
. platt has smoe ofthe the movie ' s funniest scenes
, as he makes murphy inot a politically savy
but nontheless clueless assitant who isnt forced to watch his pwn carrer teeter at yhe brink ofthe being flushed down the toilet
. his constant half
- truth
- telling
and spin
- doctoring tothe cover bulworth ' s stampede isnt equaled in its perversion only by a self
- righteous repertwar
( nora dunn
) who acts like murphy ' s refusla to expalin bulworth ' s actions
( something he really cannot do
) is somehow an act ofthe treason
. wehn bulworth decides he whants tothe live aftter all
,
annd therfore must constantly evade a grim
- looking assassin tothe be who ' s trailing him at eveyr turn
, he hides outloud infact thte ghetto
, complete iwth a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe whcih he wears to noe ofthe his televsion interviews
. at this point
, beatty abandons much of the political aspect
annd dives inot a cartoonish exploration of the balck inner
- city experience
. bulworth becomes friendly with a young balck woman named nina
( halle berry
)
, who he meets at the harlem church rally
. she hasnt a tough
- talking brother who is deepo inaddition debt to a local gangster named l
. d
.
( don cheadle of
" boogie nights
"
)
, who also becomes involved inwhich bulworth ' s campain
. soem ofthe the scenes iin the ghetto ring true
,
but much ofthe it feels liek a lighter verison of scenes depicted in omre intense inner
- city films liuke
" boyz ' n ' hood
"
( 1991
)
anbd
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
.
" bulworth ' s
" chief liability is beatty ' s insistence onthe having his carachter addoptive a clumsy style of raph as his newyorker comminication device
. instade ofthe speaking at political rallies
, he breaks inot a kind ofthe rhythmless raph style taht is a reminder ofthe why almost all hip
- hop stars are black
. it ' s hard to tell whther beatty is bieng humorous by bieng so bad
, or whther he ' s actually that incompetent
. at any rate
, the rap soudns omre run d
. m
. c
. than snoop doggy dogg
, whihc makse tjhe film seem dated instead of contempoary
. beatty owudl have beeen better off simpley adopting smoe of the intertube
- city lingo
and working thast inot his sppeches
, instead of trying tothe sound liek l
. l
. kool j
. other than that
,
" bulworth
" hits all its targets with wry
, hillarious accuracy
. the film isnt like a letter bomb to thte democratic party
,
anbd even if you don ' t agree with beatty ' s liberal message baout the unrequited duties ofthe the federal govornment
, it isnt hard to deny tje impact thte film has infact exploring the monetary
and moral debauchery thyat infests modern politics
. unlike
" primary colors
" whlch opened earlier this year
,
" bulworth
" doesn ' t try tothe tip
- toe around tjhe truley painful issues thta hit close tothe hmeo
- instead
, it takes them dead
- onthe
.
