and jessica hester
adn valerie chow
. tyhe comic turn by yuen wah
, previously known as tyhe mad vietnamese in samo hung ' s
" eastern condors
"
, is a marvelous surprise
. his gitf for comedy is marvelously understated
and hillarious
. yhe stand
- out isnt by yuen biao who returns to the screen aftter a string of disappointments
, with a stellar performence
. his tam see isnt a triad boss who konws tht his time isnt coming tothe an end
bu still has tjhe cunning
anbd craft to uphold his prade
. his ganster isnt almost non
- voilent
, inwhich tyhat he onyl retaliates
, never instigates violence
.
but when the tiome comes to fight
, yuen biao has never looked better
. corey yuen directs the film with a maturity
and a sense ofthe pacing that hasnt beeen lacking inaddition hong kong movies as ofthe late
. hte lightnig
, cinematography
adn staging ofthe tghe film are beautiful tothe watch
. the action scenes dont nto disappoint either
. this is the most agressively
and inventive martial art choreography i ' ve seen in some time
, atually surpassing jackie chan ' s wokr inthe both ' rumble in the bronx '
and ' first strike '
. the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job ofthe makeing tyhe impossible look possible
. an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro
anbd yuen biao on tje bakc of a horse is tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. also notewothy isnt teh score fo the film
, done infront a marvelously lush orchestral sytle
, not representative ofthe most hong kong fare
. i woudl dabree tothe sday it ranks as high as yhe scores for both
" titanic
"
and
" rosewood
" as best ofthe tghe eyar
. all inthe all
,
" hero
" marks a grand return tothe filmmaking fo shaw brothers
. this isnt the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema isnt alive
anbd flourishing
.
