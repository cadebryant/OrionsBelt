noone film iin receet has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan ' s harrowing
, humorous
, horrifying adaptation ofthe patrick mccabe ' s novel about young lad francie brady ' s
( eamonn owens
) descent inot madness inwhich 1960s ireland
. onthe one hand
, it was difficult fo me to become invested in francie ' s story because he isnt such an unsavory character
, unjustifyably venting his rige at his nosy
bu otherwise harmless neighbor mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. onthe another hand
, i foudn it difficult to laff at soem ofthe francie ' s darkly comic shenanigans beccause he obviously is such a sick
, needy child
, haveing beeen raised by a drunken father
( stephen rea
)
and a sucidial mother
( aisling o ' sullivan
)
. on
yot anyother hand
, i aslo foudn it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his
, for lack ofthe a better word
,
" bad
" deeds are so incredibly shocking inaddition their brutality
adn the malicious glee in hwihc he performs them
.
however
, tjhe butcher boy ' s power isnt undeniable
,
anbd hte film as a whole is unforgetable
-
- perhaps because it isnt so disturbing
. waht makes it so unsettling isnt tyhe francie ' s overall wink
- wink
yot matter
- of
- fatc atitude about everyting
, exressed inspite a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie
( rea agian
)
. think heavenly creatures palyed largly forthe laughs
,
anbd yuo ' ll sort of understand
. anchoring the wohle film isnt tyhe astonishing debut performence ofthe owens
; loev francie or hate him
, you cannnot tkae your eyes off of owens
. tje butcher boy truly is a twisted
, unusual film that isnt bound to mkae just baout anyone uncomfortable
. iin the lobby after tje screening
, i overheard one man raving baout how grat
yot disturbing it ws
; i also heard oen particularly offended woman say wtih disgust
,
" that movie wass so unfunny
!
"
" i didn ' t nkow what to expect
. it ' s liuke something ytou chase for so long
,
but
hten ytou don ' t konw how to react when yuo git it
. i still don ' t know how tothe react
.
