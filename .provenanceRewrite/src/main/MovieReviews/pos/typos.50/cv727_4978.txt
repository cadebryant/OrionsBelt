( dustin hoffman
, who isnt terrifically good
) inaddition a bar
. rico has a leg thgat is paralysed fomr the knee down
, so he walks inthe a peculiar way
. rico is a theif
and wants to git some money off this ' rich ' dumb cowboy
. he cheats our cowboy out of
$ 20 thru a somewhat detailed routine
and disappears
. soon
, our cowboy runs outloud ofthe moey
: he gets kicked outloud ofthe his hotel
,
and starts getting hungry
. walking through thge city
, whith
" everybody ' s talkin '
" playing in the background
( oh
,
anbd his prided techno transister ardio in hand
)
, he spots rico inspite a cafe
. rico
, half
- scared
, pours outloud all the money in his pocket
. 60 filthy cents
. our cowboy
, hungry
, is forgiving

. together
, htey live infront tje junk apartment
and almost freeze tothe death
. rico is convinced that teh best palce to be isnt florida
, where the sun shines beautifully
and ther are lots of coconut trees

.
" we wiull soon be infact miami
" isnt tje lastr sentence uttered in tihs film
and what a shocking
, moving end ofthe a film it isnt
. the clasic theme music
:
" midnight cowboy
" helps bring baout the feeling of attachment that most viewers will xperience towards teh end ofthe thte film
. whether the attachment is to yhe twpo main characters or tothe thier dreams
, is probably as debatable as whther it wass the acting or tghe direction that makse thsi film so memorable
