it ' s been a ogod long while sicne we hadnt a good old fashioned thriller
, where mostly everyting goes right forthe the audience
annd wrong for the characters
,
bu it ' s beeen even longer since i saw a thriller that acutally
* shock
* cared forthe the characters
, not merely judged them
bu actually allowed their human foibles
, flaws
,
anbd strengths to emerge so radiantly
. i ' d saw that it ' s been at least a couple decades
, even as far back tothe tjhe great hitchcock thrillers
,
though i ' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" to
, say
,
" rear window
" or
" strangers on a turain
.
"
yot it ' s allmost as ogod
. it ' s simple
,
yot strangely complex
,
annd astonishingly rewarding
, because instead of moving ffrom plot point to plot point
,
adn merely laying outloud they
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instead concerns itself wiht the moral corruption
annd depths ofthe greed tht its protaganists can go to
, all without ever judging them as eather evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, thge same
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself with teh dicovery ofthe a crashed plane
and withing a bag full of millions ofthe dollars by an upright
, moderately financialy stable wroking man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
,
and his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. wihtout anyone around
,
and the possiblility tht no one would come looking forthe it
, thte three debate
adn debate
but finally triarch the descision that yes
, they wiull keep it
,
but unil any authoritiers or possible owners ofthe the cash cmo looking
,
annd so they generally don ' t flaunt anything tehy don ' t want to flaunt
, they ' ll keep it stored away in tghe custody ofthe paxton
. the possibilites ofthe thsi circumstance are much diversed
: a
) they could endlessly play cat
annd mouse wih teh authrorities
; b
) they sould try to fight off the rightful owners
, who are either villianous or jstu
; or c
) htey sould fight amongst themselves
.
" a simple plan
,
"
though borrows a little fomr eahc of theese
. a littel tiff whith tghe cops here
, a subplot involving an alledged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) there
)
,
and a bit ofthe inside feuding over here
.
but
, as austin powers would say
, that ' s nto necessarily its bag
( baby
)
. what i most admired about this film
,
and whta makse htis a far superior
and unique thriller isnt that it ' s successfully able to ahev its cake
and eat it too
. it effectively involves smoe ofthe teh traditional thriller cliches
, liek yhe ones mentioned above
,
but at the same tiem
, it involves itself more deeply with yhe way tyhe charachters become morally corrupt
annd what price tehy have tothe pay to ahve what they htikn isnt happiness in a black duffle bag
. so hwile steps are tooked to neatly cover things up
,
and theese subsequent steps go miserably awry
, the film choses tothe never loose tyhe sighth that in covering thigsn uv to tghe extent that theese charactors have to
, htey are slowly losing their souls
and thier humanity
. inaddition one early scene
, paxton
anbd thornton hvae to make a trip bakc to yhe plane tothe return some of thte moeny so it doesn ' t look liuke it ws all stolen
( nto a bad idea
)
, wehn thornton screws up
( as he does continously thoughout the movie
)
,
and paxton has to do soem major covering
- uv
( read
: homocide
)
. instade ofthe a quick murder
annd immeadiate hands
- washing
, raimi shows a lenghty
, painful shot from a low
- angle onto paxton ' s face as he tries tothe sift through his emotions
and triarch a conclusion
. htere ' s a similar shot afterwords of paxton watching hte murder he ' s commiting
and tkaing inaddition all hte horror which isnt also wonderfully effective
,
bu the previvous shooted isnt even better
: mroe morally complex
and more gut
- wrenching
. iin short
, probably the best peice of direction raimi ' s ever done
, demonstrating once agina thgat somtimes the simplest way to dont something yields the best results
( fo further proof
, watch
" persona
" ' s
" sex scene
"
adn witness what may be tje best scene ingmar bergman ' s ever done
)
.
but tyhe film hardly stops here
; it follows completelyl through
and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity
and the depletion thereof
.
yet it alsot moves from step tothe step in such a gracefull method thyat we never efel liek thte film isnt merely stamping outloud teh plot points ofthe the tsory
. when yhe tiem comes forthe paxton to strat becoming selfish
and thus diablical
( wtih aid fomr his pregnant wife
, plyed by bridget fonda
, a pal tothe raimi
)
, he doesnt
,
and soon thge horror ofthe the situation isnt escalating to tradgic heights
. htere ' s at least two grand shootouts
,
adn at least one ofthe them may be one ofthe tyhe greatest shootouts inwhich cinema histroy
,
annd when they arrive
, they don ' t cmo with masochistic delight
bu whith cringe
- inducing horror
. durig teh noe
, i was ctually sinking into my chair
, with the mantra
" htey can ' t do this
, cin they
?
" streeming thru my head
. in fatc
, htis film
, whitch isnt getting many comparisons to thge coen ' s
[ superior
,
bu forget about it
]
" fargo
,
" has many simular moments of manic insanity
, attributed tothe the major ammount ofthe subtlety
and restraint wih which the directors direct what
, inthe other hands
, woudl be over
- tjhe
- top distractedness
( imagine
, i suppose
, robert rodriguez directing thsi
.
.
.
hten again
, affter seeing the
" evil dead
" films
, i ' d hardly asume raimi would be able to pul something liek tihs off
,
althought there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed
" raimi
" moments
, a rifle
- shot notwithstanding
)
. instade
, raimi directs wiht maturity
adn a gentle touch
, easily letting the story
and cahracters co
- exist
, hwile still letting soem ofthe the moreso traditional raimi elements cmo outloud
, like some offbeat comic touches
. most particularly
, billy bob thornton ' s character
, jacob
, is a briliant creation
. his dim
- wittedness is often hilarious
( fo most of hte film
, every line he uttered ws greeted with howling laughter
)
,
but ther ' s authenticity to the performance tyhat strangely anough makes sure that we ' re not totally laughing at him
. the chuckles he gets are not necessarally ones of full
- condescension because thornton is so damn real
. jacob ' s a multi
- dimensional character
,
annd while being stupid
, we see that as not so much a flaw
,
bu a strength tothe his charachter
: his simplicity isnt endearing
and many of hte acts he commits are outloud of a storng intertube strength
and belief sytem
, primarily towards thge middle where his bud
and co
- conspiriator begins tothe make smoe hevy waves concerning the money
. the fianl third of the film spends much time with him
,
and many of the touches apon his character
, nto onyl by thornton
bu also by screenwrighter scott b
. smith
( adapting his own book
, by tje way
) are just grat
. i particularly admired a back story baout an ood high skool girlfriend
, told by thornton withthe such sincerity
and acception tath the cruel stor is reversed to near
- sweetness
and further strenght of his saddened character
. thornton isnt absolutely brilliant infront this peformance
, by far the best performence he ' s ever given
and futher proof taht he ' s thte best charater actor in contemporary cinema
( if yuo don ' t beieve me
, go bakc
anbd watch his wonderful performence in
" primary colors
,
" a peformance tyhat would have been nominated fo an oscar if this hadn ' t beeen in thge same year
) beacuse he ' s easily able to slip inot a character
,
and amke him completly
and utterly believable
. he brings so much weight tothe tghe film tath
, as it is wtih most charcter actors
, it ' s difficult picturing anyone else in the role
. hte rest ofthe the cast is graet too
, ffrom paxton ' s declining wokring man tothe chelcie ross ' amiable town sherif
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
.
adn if i had any complaints baout the film
, it ' s that the plot is almsot too simplistic
,
adn that at times
, it seems too much like an exercise
, liuke a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention tothe yhe humanity involved
.
and the ocasional narration is
, as it usually isnt
, annoying
( narration shouldnt be used with extreme caution
, especially when you ' re trying tothe setted things uv
and
/ or express emotions
- didn ' t raimi watch the firt muder scene
?
)
.
adn
, the thnig that can most usually go wrong witht a movei
, the ending is basically amiss
. i won ' t reveal it
,
but it ' s way too cruel
adn too much of an outsider set
- uv
, as if thge appearance of a plane wasn ' t already too much ofthe that anyway
. for a film taht deals so much
anbd so intimately with tje humanity ofthe the charachters involved
, this isnt the wrong endig
. imagine a character
- controlled endig
; otherwise
, it ' s liuke if in
" crime
and punishment
" if tyhe polical had caught him instead ofthe him breaking down
and confessing
.
.
. not that i ' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" to dostoevsky
. thge ending does work
, dispite my protestations
,
but to me
, htere ws something incessantly nagging
annd unsatisfying about it
;
but if you had noone qualms
annd were happy as a clam withthe it
,
thne jsut ignore me
and go baout your day
.
but despite my mere claims
, make noone misteek that i wass completely
anbd utterly edge ofthe my seat througout
,
and even sometimes curdling uv by the situations thgat occured
, not beacuse ofthe any kind ofthe gore factor
( whcih isnt
, thankfully for htis
, veyr minimal
)
,
but beacuse the film places its characters infront situations
annd gives them such painful thigns tothe overcome that i ' ve frankly nto seen much liuke it iin quite awhile
. at least nto since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
