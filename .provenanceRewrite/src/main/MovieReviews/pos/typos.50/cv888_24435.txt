imagin htis
. yuo ' re given a sword
annd a sheild
and vyre basic
, minimal training
. a man ytou don ' t know tells you that tihs iwll be the last day that ytou will live
. ytou are thrown inot an arena whith thousands ofthe spectators wanting to see yuo die
. ytou frantically moniter severeal closed doors which
, in seconds
, will realease vicious enemies prepared to destory ytou
. you watch as the innocent friends ytou made in yhe last few dyas are murdered iin cold blood
. if yuo are lucky enought to survive htis chaos thrown at you
, you knwo ytou ' re going tothe have to dont it all over again tomorrow
. eventally nkow matter how storng or skilled you are
, ytou ' re going tothe die
. htis is the life ofthe a gladiator
. ytou ' ll never hve to be a gladiator
annd after seing ridley scott ' s powerful gladiator
, you ' ll be thankful for thast
. wtih his new film
, scott has returnd cinema to yhe fascinating age of the ancient roman empire
.
and liek those preceeding it
, spartacus
and ben hur
, gladiator has nearly everyting going for it
- a storng lead actor
, a wonderful supporting casted
, eye
- catching special effects
,
anbd a great scirpt
. since tyhe two aforementioned films came outloud before the prime target viewers ofthe gladiator
( teenagers to thirty
- yera
- ood males
) were around
, a wohle newyorker genre may jsut be reborn
anbd revisited
.
> from a weak beggining
, thte film starts off extremely gloomy
and inauspicious
. rome ' s best genaral maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who hasnt helpped yhe empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted
, isnt currently
( in tjhe yearm 180 a
. d
. taht isnt
) waging a war against germania
. scott shoots the gory battle inaddition an ackward style
, similar tothe tht of saving private ryan
but much less effective
. it ' s blurry
, in slow motion
,
annd tyhe sound isnt muted
. as soon as this artistic method began
, it was hard to tell waht was wqat
adn who ws who
. it ' s a ogod thing scott stops tihs affter hte frist twenty mintues or alse gladiator woudl hvea been torture tothe watch
. instead
, the genaral swears he iwll get outloud after this battle
. he wants to go bakc tothe his family
anbd his crops
, he wants a quiet life
.
but
, unexpectedly
, he gets anything
bu that
. tghe dieing emperor ofthe rome
, marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
, decides to haev maximus appointed new emperor ofthe rome once he dies
. he asks maximus tothe restore tyhe republic by giving more power tothe the senators
. all ofthe this does not go well for aurelius ' son
, commodus
( joaquin pheonix
) who was expecting his father tothe nmae him teh new emperor
. jelous
adn upset
, commodus kills his own father
, names hismelf emperor
, kills maximus ' wief
annd son
,
annd attemts to kill maximus
.
bu maximus is able to escape his pwn death
anbd vows tothe kill commodus
and fulfill marcus aurelius ' wishes
. now a slave
, hte only way he cxan win his pwn freedom
and complet his goal isnt to become a winning gladiator
, who eventually are released for their succsess
. a stroy ofthe betrayal
and promises
, gladiator is more than jsut a mindless action flick
. ytou acutally care about yhe charachters
, somtimes even the evil villain commodus
, who is jsut a young man as determined to mkea rome one way as maximus isnt determined tothe mkea it the other way
. phoenix plays his charater brilliantly
. think of commodus as thte percy wetmore
( ofthe pant
- wetter the green mile
) of the roman empire
- a whiny
, sleazy
,
" respect
- me
- because
- my
- father
- ws
- a
- good
- man
" brat who hates wehn he ' s nto the center ofthe attention
. eveyr scene we see commodus
, he ' s either crying or he looks liuke he hasnt jsut been crying
. pheonix hasnt definetly matured as an atcor since to dieu fo
,
annd gladiator shows he ' s moreso thna jstu river ' s littel brother
. crowe is aslo excelent as the film ' s grisly
- faced hero
. maximus isnt noe of hte few charactors in recent cinema who actulaly hasnt emotions
. this guy actually acts liuke a anyone in his situation would act
, he ' s noone invincible superhero who onyl blurts out one
- liners
, he
( believ it or nto
) acts like a human being
! the rest of the casted
, including richard harris
, djimon hounsou
, walter hill
, derek jacobi
,
adn connie nielsen are also first rate
. ridley scott
, using outstanding speical effects
, hasnt brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum
, the loudness of thge roman mob
,
annd thge city of rome in general
. tyhe visuals are breathtaking
adn voluminous
, liuke a cleopatra of tje yearm 2000
. tje costuming is allso wonderfull from the detailled shields
and armor to yhe exquisite dress of the opper
- class politicans
. gladiator is anohter movei ytou ahve tothe see on the big screen tothe git the most out of tghe experience
. allong wiht u
- 571
, acation fans should have plenty tothe see in theaters this week
adn shoudln expect much more excitement tothe come this summer ofthe 2000
