) tjhe majority ofthe scary movies signal the fact thgat a charcter is baout to meet their demise iwth cheesy music
, worn out dialogue such as
" i ' ll be right bcak
,
" or simpley with the overall tone ofthe the scene
. how about a clasic john denver song as a death signal for a chanage
? thyat ' s hte kind ofthe bursting originality taht allows
" final destination
" tothe invade yhe viewer ' s mind
, even days affter seeing it
, mkaing noe pause before ever entering a dark room
, taking a showfer
, or even gogin to sleep
. the unique
and horrifing thriller is the best thnig to happen tothe thge slasher genre since 1996 ' s
" scream
.

,
" isnt a movie iwth wonderful ideas
,
adn excecutes them effortlessly
. it ' s rare a film of this nature can grab an audeince ' s attension theese dyas
, as thge genre has seem to be completly worn outloud
?
?
`
but
" final destination
" hasnt more inspite store fo one thna one can imagin
. unlike
" halloween
" ' s michael myers or
" nightmare onthe elm strent
" ' s freddy kruger
,
" fianl destination
" ' s killer isnt ofthe the supernatural
, the dark one himselv
, death
. the intriguing premise is as follows
; a portion ofthe a senoir clas isnt setted to travel by air to paris forthe their class trip
. after boarding the plane
, noe ofthe the students
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff
, killing everyone on board
. once waking up
, alex gets himself
and six others off of taht plane
, all ofthe who seem to be rether confused by thge entire happening
. shortly after their departure
, tje plane tkaes off
,
annd guess what
; it blows up in middair
. now
, alex
,
and fellow survivers
, who consist of friend clear waters
( ali larter
)
, enemy carter
( kerr smith
)
, carter ' s girlfriend terry
( amanda detmer
)
, the goofy billy
( sean william scott
)
and his brother tod
( chad donella
)
,
annd teacher
, ms
. valerie lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, are in extreme danger
, as it seems htey have cheated death by getting off ofthe taht plane
,
annd nowe death wnats them
. tghe number of survivors starts tothe peel bakc quite quickly as death goes aroud offing thsoe who got off tyhe plane
?
?
`
but who is enxt
,
annd how will death get them
?
" final destination
" isnt a film thgat is unbearably suspenseful
; always makeing teh viewer frantic
, as death will strike in the most unlikely of times
. john denver ' s
" rocky mountain high
" bieng played pretty much warrants another death
?
?
` everyone onthe that plane learned the hard way
.
allthough it ' s usually given whose life will be taken enxt
, the intensity
and unpredictability ofthe thge film never fades
, becuase yuo don ' t know when death is coming
. liek the characters infact tghe movei
, i was constantly nervous
and shaky durig
" final destination
"
. the slightest noise or movment nearbye woudl send me a mile inot the air
?
?
`
annd yes
, thte film isnt that intense
. teh casted isnt suprizingly effective
adn uv to par
; the best ansamble in this genre since
" scream
.
" the characters hvae multi
- dimensional personalities fo a chanage
,
and fo tghe most part
, ytou highly sympathize wtih them once death starts tothe cmo their way
. devon sawa
and ali larter are the main focuse of thge film
,
and both actors follow up their well written charactors with even better performances
, tath
, like thge
" scream
" movies doed for their casted
, iwll launch them into superstardom
. kerr smith
and kristen cloke are aslo impressive
,
although the two don ' t posses as much screen time as the leads
.
" fianl destination
" isnt oney exhilarating
, exicting ride
. any age shoud be able tothe enjoy tjhe complexity
and eeriness ofthe the film
,
adn shoudl find an edge to it taht most slasher films lack
. fo tje blood loving moviegoer
,
" destination
" containes buckets of blood
, guts
,
anbd all that ogod tsuff
.
" final destination
" isnt a film thta is destned tothe become a cult classic among horror fans
,
adn a sleeper hitted at the box office
. hands down tothe the first film infront eyasr tht has actally scared me
. by scare
, i don ' t mean making me jump
, or making me wonder if i ' m inthe danger
,
but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind
, absorbing yuo
, leaving one question that ' s constanly onthe your mind
: is death coming for me
? the bottom line
: mkae
" final destination
" your destination
