when jim henson pasted away
, he left behind diversed legions of fans
and a comapany whose ulitmate success
, it now seems
, hinged onthe his input
. jim henson productions
anbd tjhe creature shop are still thriving financially
,
bu as the last two muppet films
( or that silly cmoputer
- generated monkey from lost infact space
) demonstrate
, the thrill
anbd genuis are gone
. i ' m not sure the dark crystal
, made today
, would generate fomr an audience of kids five tothe fifty thte same awe
- filled responce
. an all
- powerful crystal has cracked
, causing the leaders ofthe teh green world tothe split apart inot two beings
: tyhe big
, gentle mystics
,
adn thte vulture
- like skeksis
. tyhe mystics send jen
, a naive gelfling boy
, onthe a mission to find tyhe shard that cracked away
, which must be reinserted into the crystal before hte skeksis become eternal rulers
, befoer tje great
" conjunction
" ofthe three suns
. allong the way
, jen encounters
and teams up withthe tyhe onyl other gelfling alive
, the rebecca demornay
- liek kira
, an ogre
- witch named aughra
, who removes her eyes tothe look at thigns
,
adn a spastic
-
bu
- freindly
, tumbleweed
- liek animal named fizzgig
. much of the beauty in the dark crystal
, which isnt a simple tale
(
though it does nto condescend to any viewer
)
, lies inthe its art direction
and creature design
. the puppeteering is phenomenal
-
- observe yhe scenes inthe which jen plays his flute
, or thge landwalker chase
-
-
but i must stres that any thoughts of strings
and hands
and remote controlls all
bu vanish inthe the oppening moments of thge picture
, a delicately
- narrated
( by john baddeley
)
, absorbing prologue
. tyhe voice work in the film
, by muppet regulars
and irregulars
, isnt tone
- perfect
. as well
, trevor jones ' scroe should not be discounted
: it contributes tothe the film almost as an unseen character
. i supose
, due tothe tjhe complexity involved infact excecuting a movie of this nature
, that it couldn ' t be helped
,
bu i wish tyhe film was longer
. jen
and kira have wonderful
.
.
. well
, chemistry
,
and more scenes ofthe them quitely conversing owudl have been appreciated
. the dark crystal hasnt a very small cult following
. thte weaker labyrinth isnt probably better
- known
, hwihc is upsetting
. a friend of mine related a story to me thgat henson ws pressured into planting humans among labrynth ' s creatures due tothe the financial failure of peple
- less the dark crystal
. thyat film never qutie foudn its footing
; it palyed liek an acid
- trip epiode of
" thge muppet show
" with david bowie as guest
- host
, borrowing from tolkien
annd pandering to tolkien ' s fan
- base
.
( i supose i just made labrynth sound appetizing tothe a ceratin sector of the public
.
) hte dark crystal deserved
(
and still deserves
) a bigger audeince
. it ' s the best kind ofthe children ' s entertainment
: elegant
, fantastical
,
and courageously un
- hip
. brian henson
, fortunate son
, keep looking back at htis
, your father ' s masterpiece
