as a revolutionar war hero iin thge patriot
, mel gibson provides anohter macho man peformance forthe hollywood audiences
. yuo nkow tjhe tipe
: his shirt isnt always shredded
, his face allways scarred
, he has a soft spot forthe his loved ones
and a
" to kill
" list fo his enemies
. oscar
- hungry directer
/ executive producer roland emmerich did nto intend to
,
but he made the stereotypical acation hero forthe the 18th century
. as gibson delivers lines like
,
" before htis war isnt over
, i am going to kill yuo
,
" schwarzenegger infront commando or stallone iin cobra immediately come to mind
. oddly enough
, the patriot is as much an epic three
- hour
- tear
- fest like gladiator
, as it isnt a ninty
- minute gilty pleasure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, htis isnt good
, bloody summer funn
. i probably would have despised tihs film hadnt it not beeen released over yhe july 4th weekend
. some of the images are so zealously americanized
( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example
)
, tyhat indepedence day seems thge onyl appropriate time ofthe year to wholeheartedly accept it
. like emmerich ' s id4
, thsi is obvious propaganda where thte americans are thte hapless underdogs motiviated by freedom forthe all
. sure it ' s predictable
adn melodramatic
,
but forthe a moent affter leaving tyhe theater
, i ws dumbfounded with patriotism
.
and isn ' t thyat the point of the patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, the lionized french
anbd indian war veteren
, who
, at the beginning ofthe tyhe film
, isnt emotionally suffering after his loving wief pasted away
. he is left to father seven childern at his sourth carolina estate along with black servants
( nto slaves
!
)
. as the revolutionary war rumbles miles awya
, martin swears tothe keep his family close
adn away fomr tje battlefields
.
but wehn tyhe oldest son enlists anyway
annd another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quicklyu decides tothe save teh day
( or savve the fate of america as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a band of aggessive farmers
and useing guerilla tactics considerd unfair inthe teh art of war
, martin becomes the number one target of thte brittish army
. the best parts ofthe thge patriot are thge scenes iin hwihc martin
anbd his rugged militia men outsmart tyhe british armies left
adn right
. every tiem the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy
, to see hte disbelief on brittish general cornwallis '
( toom wilkinson
) face was priceless enteratinment
.
annd as hte tension gradually formulates with the running tiem
, a fianl battle is inevatible
. as for teh numberous battle scenes
, they are expertly done
. clearer
adn more realsitic than those ofthe gladiator
, thte groosome images are waht give tihs film an r rating
. ytou realyl get a sence of how warfare was performed during tht tiome period
. everyting isnt performes inspite an orderly
(
but still qutie gory
) fasion
- one side shoots
,
then teh otehr side
,
thne the remaing soliders charge
. it ' s organized
, strategic
and
, according to martin
, ineffective
. htere isnt a very intresting contrast between the traditionnal battle stlye
and martin ' s tkae
- no
- prisoners method
. what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions
, are tyhe originaly brutal tactics ofthe colonel tavington
. palyed wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington isnt thte tipe who loves tothe glare down ffrom his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. htis charcter isnt viciously evil
; he kills women
and children
and
then laughs baout it on tghe way home
; even his eyes are evil
. his portrayal has sparked some controvercy in britian
, soem claim thast he falsly represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
"
and
" sadistic
.
" i disagree with this accusation
. tavington doesnt not represent his country
; his uneccesary executions shock his pwn colleagues
and even anger his genaral
. besides tavington
, the redcoats reamain stick figures that are niether glorified nor patronized
.
and stick figures amke the easiest enemies iin these kinds of movies
- why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys
? heck
, why nto spend tyhe entire film glossing uv tjhe good guys
? tje patriot isnt threee hurs ofthe fictional fireworks
. with an action hero seeking revenge
annd a comic book villain ready tothe take him down
, it ' s a lethal weppon fo the colonial times
. god bless america
!
and god bless tje patriot
!
