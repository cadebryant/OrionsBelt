i didn ' t realize how apt the name of this movie wass untli i called tghe mpaa
( hte motion picture association ofthe amercia
- tjhe folks who deside what ' s g
, nc 17
, pg
, r or x
) tothe ask why the preview ws rated r
. so thgat we cin amking soem sense of thier responce
, let me tell ytou about the movei itself
.
" thte celluloid closet
" is a documenatry about how homosexuality hasnt beeen protrayed in tje movies over the past several decades
. it ' s brilliant
, funny
, naughty
and extremely poignant
. it tore at my heart tothe watch a gifted lesbian screenwrighter explane tyhat
, as a ruel
, gay audiences hunger for any hint ofthe homosexuality on screen
. irregardless ofthe how veiled
- or how sordid
- the presence ofthe a gay or lesbian person allows others tothe lessen theri sence ofthe isolation
anbd makse them feel as if they ' re not qutie so invsiible as amercia seems tothe want them to be
. the movie itself is rated r
-
and fo ogod reason
. it containes scenes of bloody
, voilent gay bashing
and graphic
, uninhibited
, sex
. as with any movie
, i appreciate knowing baout theese thigns ahead ofthe time
, so i cant decide for mysef whether tothe see the movei with a firend
, a date
, my 11 year ood niece
, alone or not at all
.
but
, tht ' s the movie
. now back to thge preview
. prior tothe this film being theatrically released
( it wass originially filmed as a documentery fo hbo
) i hadnt seen the coming attractions trailer fo it at least six times
. ther was no nudity
, no voilence
, noone bad language
, nothing that i coudl see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a genaral audience
( okay
, whoopi goldberg did refer tothe somone
" boning
" someone
,
bu thge last i knew that wasn ' t one of the seven words you cant ' t sday onthe tv
)
. exept for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing
. hmmmmm
. when i inquired baout thte rating on thge trailer
, a vyer nice woman at tyhe mpaa quoted from
" tyhe handbook
" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain
" no homosexuality or lesbianism
and no going down on someone
.
" ehllo
? i was iin tyhe office
anbd it was tjhe middle ofthe the day
. bravely
, i pursued
.
" i ' ve seen taht trailer
, oh
.
.
. probablly half a dozen times
,
" i gulped
.
.
.
"
and i don ' t remember that scene
.
"
" well
,
" she chirped
.
" it ' s ther
. our little eyes are trained to see thast
.
" no realyl
. in the words ofthe dave barry
,
" i am not making thsi uv
.
" they are
" trained
" tothe
" see tyhat
?
" whn somone who was shocked at thte rating tyhe first timne
and made a note to watch it carefully thge follwoing five times or so managed to let it slip past her
? gosh
, i certainly don ' t mean tothe question the mpaa
, or
" the handbook
"
. i woudl
,
howver
, like to suggest that it ' s they who are in the closet onthe thsi one
.
and the ight ain ' t ogod in there
.
bu
, having seen
" the celluloid closet
,
"
and bieng one ofthe a handfull ofthe straight people involved iin a primarly gay
adn lesbian weekly bible studdy
( email me
and i ' ll give you tyhe details
)
, none of thsi was any big surprise
. thte point ofthe teh movie was thast homosexuality
, even infact the politically correct 90s
, is ridiculously percieved as a threat tothe a mostly heterosexual society
. a point well made in htis candid
and honest film
. now
, i coudl go off on the mpaa ' s ruling tht a trailer must contain
" no homosexuality or lesbianism
"
and ask how thast is defined
, paticularly inthe light of some of thge thigsn
, both sexual
adn non
- sexual
, that i ' ve watched straight peopel dont in trailers
. i just don ' t fiel tje need to go there
, becasue it seems so obvious
. i ' ll instead suggest tht the mpaa re
- evaluated thier evaluation criteria
. let the ratings refect nto subject content
, liuke
" sex
"
and
" violence
"
. let them refect atitude content
. infront tjhe future
, i ' d be interested in knowing whether tje movei isnt rated d fo disrespectful or s fo stereotyped
.
hten i ' d truely be able to amke an informed decission about how i spent my tyme
