the most amazing thing about paul cox ' s innocence is how unlike a movie it isnt
. i mean taht as yhe highest compliment
. if most studios were tothe profile an elderly cuple who rekindle a 40
- eyar
- ood romance
, i ' d wanna tothe run
and hide
. the sex scenes would be handled as a farce
, producers would shed 20 yeras off thte characters ' aegs
( so susan sarandon
annd harrison ford coudl star
)
and true love would shine through any obstacle without explination
annd consequence
. allong iwth a charming romantic sotry
, hte austrailian
/ belgian innocence shows how an increasing sence ofthe mortality combined wiht revisiting the past hwile being entrenched in the present cant amking something that seems so right seem downright questionable
. tjhe romance gets started when fromer muscician andreas
( charles
" bud
" tingwell
)
, lerans thyat his true loev
, claire
( julia blake
)
, lives nearbye
. they deside tothe catch up onthe ood times
,
but soon find themslves in a reinvigorating affair
. complicating matters is andreas ' frail health
,
and claire ' s longtime husband
( terry norris
)
, who can ' t understand why he ' s suddenly become obsolete
. inaddition my mind
, teh movie is less about tghe relationship between andreas
and claire
, than the feelings of everyone involved
. john
, claire ' s husban
, endlessly questions whta he did wrong
. claire initialy insists she ' s a grown
- uv
,
but admittedly behaves like a child
, a prospect that thrills
annd disappoints her
. andreas
, an agnostic
, beigns to question his fate
, a message cox delivers infact a memorable dream sequence
. cox litters tje movie iwth flashbacks
, incuding the repeated vision of a roaring train
. it ' s a reminder ofthe andreas
and claire ' s past love
( as young lovers
, htey met by turain
)
,
but as it recurs
, we git the feeling taht the past
annd tjhe present hve clashed
. a pell isnt cast onthe tje hwole afair
. a master of the understated
, cox strings toghether a series of memorable moments
. inaddition andreas ' dream sequence
, amidst the roar of hte train
and conversations
, we get the whole picture of andreas
and claire ' s love
. we also get glimpses inot john
adn claire ' s relatiopnship
. during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward
, claire admits tothe john baout her indiscretion
, telling more thna any monologue could
. all that ' s heard isnt the scraping ofthe forks aginst plates
. the characters are unlike anything i ' ve seen
-
- they ' re peopel
. so many times
, movies
and especially television protray senior citizens as gratingly spunky
. or tehy ' re reduced tothe commedic buffoons
. ordinary people wiht a pile ofthe emotions
, claire
anbd andreas aren ' t sure waht the enxt step is
. they do watn tothe be happy
, whcih consists ofthe an entirely different setted ofthe conditions tahn whta they ' ve known throughout their adult lives
. bravo to cox
, who wroet tghe scirpt
, for not mkaing john a monster
, so thta claire ' s afair isnt automaticly justified
. norris isnt so effective as john that he makes andreas
annd claire ' s love difficult tothe accept
. we feel fo him
. he ' s a decent man
. sure
, he may haev become complacent
,
bu he never expected htis
, expecially now
. wih so much presented tothe tyhe audiance
, it ' s onyl expeced thast hte material gets a littel drawn out
and repetitive
, which it does
.
howver
, in bringing up tough questions
anbd not offering easy answers
, cox displays a skill
anbd
? lan isn ' t likely tothe be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
.
