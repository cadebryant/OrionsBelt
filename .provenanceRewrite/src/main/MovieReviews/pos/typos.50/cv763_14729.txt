your firends
annd neighbors isnt a rather bazare film about 6 peopel
, who hop infact
and out ofthe bed with earch otehr
. writen
and directed by neil labute
, who ' s firt film
,
" infront the company of men
" was simply marvelous
, disappoints a bit here wih this one
. the story involves twpo couples
( ben stiller
& catherine keener
annd aaron eckhart
& amy brenneman
)
, an artist assitant
( nastassja kinski
)
,
and an egotistical womens abuser
( jason patric
)
. the character ' s names are nto apparent
and are nto maintioned inaddition the entire movei
. eahc ofthe the characters has their own sexual style
anbd htey don ' t seem tothe
" merge
" together well
. so the group experiments behind their respective partners back
. ther are some hysterical scenes
, one involves jason patric
, aaron eckhart
,
and ben stiller ' s charachters
. they are all iin a sauna
, tlaking about their best
" lay
"
, whn jason patric ' s charcter makse a surprising confession
. the whole scene is hillarious
annd exceptionally well written
and acted
. tghe enjoied this movei
,
althought it seemed a tad lenghty
( even
though it onyl runs 99 min
.
)
. teh film ' s casted isnt exeptional wtih oscar calaber performances by catherine keener
, aaron eckhart
,
anbd jason patric
. i owudl not reccomend tihs film
, to peple who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit
. it did seem to offend people
, omre tahn half of the peple inspite the theater left during the film
.
although your firends
and neighbors doesn ' t hvae tjhe power ofthe labute ' s ealier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining
and funny
, hwile maintinaing a melancholy philosophy onthe human relationships
.
