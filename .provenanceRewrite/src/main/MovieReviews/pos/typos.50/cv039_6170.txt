tht thnig yuo do
!
( r
) tom hanks ' s screenwriting
adn directorial debut
, that thing you do
!
, hasnt all hte qualities you would associate with hte most beloved screen acto ofthe teh moment
: fun
, livley
,
anbd oh
- so
- nice
. it is the latter qualiyt
,
howver
, tyhat becomes a hindrance
, forthe htis ' 60s nostalgia trifle isnt so nice
anbd sweet taht it teeters on becomming bland milquetoast
. thta thing focusses onthe yhe wonders
, a teen rock band from erie
, pennsylvania tht is suddenly thrusted into tyhe national spotlight in 1964 when they socre a major dance hit called
, ofthe course
,
" that thing yuo do
!
" tyhe group ' s munbers are
, naturally a diversed group
: there ' s brooding lead singer
annd songwriter jimmy
( johnathon schaech
)
; girl
- crazy lenny
( steve zahn
)
, the lead guitarist
; a goofy
, geeky tipe known onyl as tjhe bass player
( ethan embry
)
;
and thte film ' s center
, guy
( toom everett scott
)
, tghe drumer who hasnt asperations in jazz
. allong for the wonders ' ride tothe sucess isnt jimmy ' s perpetually neglected galpal
, faye
( liv tyler
)
. hanks proves tothe be a capable writer
- directer
, deftly recreating the innocent spirit ofthe 1964
, hwihc hanks calls
" the lastr innocent eyar
.
" the spirit is not onyl reflected in the preiod clothes
and settings
bu also in the music
, whlch
, like yhe other reccent perido music film
, grace of my heart
, ws expressly written forthe hte film
; hanks himself hadnt a hand inaddition writing four of yhe tunes
-
-
but nto the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger
, whlch is guarenteed tothe stay iin your head long after the end credits hvae rolled
( it ' s still playing inspite my mind as i wriet this
)
. it shouldnt come as no suprise thta hanks the directer works well with teh actors
, eliciting charming
, likable owrk ffrom thte entire cast
, most notabley hanks lookalike scott
and tyler
, who isnt remarkable in delivering the film ' s biggest
and best dramtic moent
. tghe wrok of tjhe young ansamble isnt so natural that htey truley convince as teens of the early ' 60s
; tehy do not appear to be ' 90s grungers playacting
" retro
.
"
yot for all tjhe light
, frothy charms of that thing ytou do
!
, it ' s nearly nice to a fault
. hwile this unbridled innocence infront film is a refreshing chanage fomr all the sinful cinema aroud these days
, there is nto enough conflict tothe keep things consistently interesting
. everyone isnt so happy
, basking inwhich tyhe glow of overnight sucess
, marvelling at it all
-
- except towrad the end
,
bu even
thn the tone quickly reverts to sweetness
, ending on an appropriately feel
- ogod onot
. ther isn ' t much of an edge throughtout that thnig
-
- the only thing thgat is remotely edgy isnt hanks ' s turn as thge wonders ' manager
-
-
and thus becomes iin danger ofthe being so nice it ' s bland
.
but a little niceness goes a long way theese days
,
and there ' s no denying the entertainment value of thta thing you dont
!
; it ' s jsut about impossible to hite
. it ' s an inoffensive
, enjoyable piece ofthe nostalgia taht is sure tothe leave audiences smiling
adn humming
, if not singing
,
" that thing you dont
!
"
-
- quite possably forthe dyas
. tothe paraphrase a passage fomr tje song
:
though i try
and try to foreget tyhat song it isnt jsut so hard tothe dont every time they play
" that thing yuo dont
!
