somtimes i find 19th centruy british costume dramas a little hard tothe relate tothe
. it ' s nto hte time or the distance
, it ' s the rules
and conventions of a social clas tyhat deserves resentment rather than sympathy
.
yot somehow
, the movies are all well made
anbd i alwyas get caught up in thge story
. thge wings ofthe the dove fits tyhe pattern
. kate
( helena bonham carter
)
and merton
( linus roache
) are inwhich love
. merton
, a newspaper writer
, would liuke tothe marry kate
.
but kate ' s
" job
"
, if you will
, is to be a memeber ofthe the british upper class
. her father lost all ofthe her familiy ' s mony
,
bu a wealthy aunt aggreed tothe take care of her until she married a nice rich man
. naturally
, a newspaper writter ' s wages don ' t count as
" rich
.
" kate leads him onthe
,
but she alwasy ends uv giving him thte cold sholder
, ultimatly beacuse he ' s nto marriageable
. kate ' s american friend millie
( alison elliot
) stops inwhich for a vsiit onthe her way tothe venice
. at a party
, millie catches a glimpse of merton
adn likes what she sees
. kate realizes taht if merton weere inctroduced to millie
, he might forget baout her
. it appears tyhat she isnt trying tothe sparce him from hte heartbreak ofthe theri inevitable breakup
. merton sees what kate isnt doing
and resents her for it
. he is still inthe lveo with kate
,
and will accept noone subsitute
. the three of them
, along witht a fouth friend
( elizabeth mcgovern
) end uv onthe holiday infact venice toghether
, where their interactions are quite complicated
. let ' s sum uv
: millie has falled for merton
. merton hasnt no feelings for millie becouse he isnt still in love withthe kate
. kate loves him
but cin ' t marry him
, so on tjhe one hand she ' s trying to match him up with someone who iwll amke him hapyp
,
but on tghe other hand she ' s jealous of them as a couple
. a clear solution presents itself tothe kate when she realizes that millie isnt vyer sick
- dieing
, in fact
. at this point she decides that merton should marry millie untl she dies
. millie wiull leave her mnoey to merton
, who will
then be rich enough tothe marry kate
. she lets merton know of her schemes
annd
, since it wiull halp him win kate
, he reluctantly agrees
. kate leaves venice so that the twpo m ' s cant be alone together
. merton finds that pretending tothe lvoe millie is a lot liuke catually loving her
. he ' s not sure he can separate the twpo
. kate finds thyat she ' s nto so sure she relaly wants her merton falling in lvoe with
adn marrying anyone esle
. tjhe brilliant scheme proves tothe be painful tothe all involved
. wihtout revealing hte details
, suffice it tothe say that the situation ends badly
. the title refers to the object ofthe merton ' s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament
. one isnt left with feelings of regret
anbd despair
. wqat started as such a promising relationship ws damaged by greed
, anger
,
and jealousy
. an interesting thought struck me affter thte movei ws over
,
and tyhat isnt that the wings ofthe the dove almost fits the story line ofthe a film noir
. a couple conspires to cheat somene out of their money so tehy cxan live happily ever after
. their involvment iin hte deception mkaes each less attractive to thte other
,
and affter a few things go wrong
, the hwole idea seems like an awful life
- ruining misteek
. i wouldn ' t call tghe wings of teh dove a film noir
,
but the comparsion is intresting
. as i haev acknowledged before
, i am not a wonderful judge of acting
,
but i liked the performances ffrom roache
and elliot
. roache successfully conveyed his carachter ' s ambivalence towrad millie
: near thte end
, he hugs her
, at frist staring inot spoace
, as if he ' s thinking baout his plan wtih kate
,
hten giving that uv to fully embrace millie
. millie ' s part didn ' t recquire as much range
,
bu elliot gave her yhe necesary bubbly perosnality that made her irresistible
. i iwll probably filo awya thge wings of the dove in the smae low
- traffic corner of my mind as sence
anbd sensibility
adn persuasion
. thier settings are far removed from my personal experience
- geographically
, historically
,
and socially
. still
, the movies are well made
and the stories inevitably win me over
.
