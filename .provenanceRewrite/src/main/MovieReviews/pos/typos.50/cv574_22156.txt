" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is somtimes like lsat years hitted
" htere ' s something baout mary
" that isnt offensive
bu very funny
. the screenplay by harris goldberg
adn rob schneider himselv isnt a smart
, clever
adn witty screenplay tath seems tothe have been writed whith care tothe mkea is so hilariously funny
. yhe characters in the film are all ctually likable especially
" jabba lady
" with her big body
bu soft heart
. there are actually times infact tje movei where i fell out ofthe my chair laughing so hard thast my stomach wass killing me
. even
though i thought
" toy stopry 2
"
and
" bieng john malkovich
" were the funniest ofthe the yera
" deuce bigalow
" follows right behind them
. the directing by mike mitchell isnt fantastic
adn shows he tookover time on thge film
. rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performence
and wehn his romance develops with oney of his customers kate
( arija bareikis
) it is a sweet romance that we get involved inaddition
and catually like bieng involved iin it
.
" deuce bigalow
" isnt a ogod
- natured film worth all tjhe merit it can get
. its not a classic or a masterpiece
, it ' s jsut a comedy that we don ' t feel bad about watching
. sure it may come off as offensive
anbd may come off as dumb somtimes
,
but you cannnot deny thyat it isn ' t funny
.
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is noone disappointment
. its a fast paced
, intertaining sweet
and hillarious comedy thta may be destind to become a cult clasic
. fans of schneider will not be disapointed
anbd fans ofthe crude
bu nice comedies will not eather
. forthe soem reason thge film garnered an r rating
but with no
" f words
" or extensive uise of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why tghe film was r
. a mild r tothe put it tothe the least
,
bu even if your under 17 or above at least 13 thsi film isnt good anough forthe yuo to see
. don ' t try to be oney of those people who amking so much of a film thgat tehy dont nto liek it
, jstu sit bakc
, laugh
and enjoy thge movie
