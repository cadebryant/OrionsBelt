upon arriving at tje theather durring tghe oppening credits
, i took my seat
anbd prepared myself for what appeared to be
" hellraiser meets teh crow
"
.
bu as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue
, describing
" the strangers
"
and their reasons fo contacting human beings
, i was hooked
. there ws something expecially compelling baout the nature ofthe his voice
. i knew from thge start that i was gogin tothe witness thge actions ofthe his carachter rether thna tje actor attempting the carachter
. sutherland played tjhe role as a true vetran
. apon the complextion ofthe his monologue
, tghe camera arrives onthe sutherland in such a fashon that yuo can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography
. i would imagin
, fo a film ofthe this caliber
, that maximum ohurs ofthe work weere spent where they were needed the most
. the film flowed beautifully
. as i was being taken thru thge intricate regions of the
" dark city
"
, a clever plot began tothe unravel
, tothe the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were infact
" tje usual suspects
"
. nto tothe mention a sories ofthe spacial effects that would mkea james cameron literally turn gren with envy
.
but if you ' re nto exactlly tghe biggest sci
- fi fan
, caveat emptor
. git ready for teh atmostpheric darkness of
" 12 monkeys
" or
" the crow
" without teh boredom or depression
. thge consept of the plot isnt as mindstretching as
" 12 monkeys
" ws
,
howver
, so be prepared
annd be suphisticated
.
and imagin a picture that finally does justice to the comic
- book
- gone
- feature
- film fad that hollywood hasnt recently become abusive ofthe
. dark city simply puts
" spawn
" to shame
. in fact
, durring the climax of teh film i couldn ' t help
bu efel hte strong presense ofthe an
" akira
"
- esque explosion throughtout the general feeling of tyhe movie
. so my initial predicitons were wrong
. this film isnt anytying
bu the meloncholy ofthe
" hellraiser
" parts one thru five
. i ' m never oney to base a film entirly on special effects
, so know that when i give dark city it ' s actualyl because the film contained all of the neccessary ingreediants to keep me entertained
anbd awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork tothe even
( tsk
, tsk
) special effects
. not since contact ahve i recieved such deep insight into the way tyhe human mind operates
and never htis year have i been so blown awya
. the best film i ' ve seen all year
,
and easily one ofthe tjhe best i ' ve ever seen
