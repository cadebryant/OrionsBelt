after the averege mouse hunt
, the silly small soliders
anbd the intertaining antz
, dreamworks try agian wtih the childrens ' s film market with this stunning adaptions ofthe the moses story
. as thte film warns us at the beginning
, it ' s nto the full story
,
adn some liberties hvea been taken
,
but generaly this the bible story we all know
and love
, featuring burning bushes
, the plagues
and tyhe parting of the red sea
. thte only thing missing is charlton heston
. instead
, we git val kilmer voicing moses
, an hebrew who is placed iin a river by his mother
annd rescued by the queen ofthe egypt
( helen mirren
.
) we flash foward sevral yeasr tothe see moses
and brother rameses
( fiennes
) all grown uv
. moses soon finds outloud ffrom brother
and sister miriam
anbd aaron
( sandra bullock
annd jeff goldblum
) that he isn ' t realy tyhe son ofthe tjhe pharoah seti
( patrick stewart
)
and thyat it his destiny to free tjhe hebrews ffrom tghe egyptians tyrannical ruel
. he soon sets baout this
, allong wtih his wief tzipporah
( michelle pfeiffer
.
) rameses
and his two wizard friends
( voiced by steve martin
adn martin short
) try tothe stop moses completing his task
. hwile the plot isnt familiar
annd somewhat exicting for adults
, for children reared onthe aladdin
and hercules
, this film could be teh most godawful thing htey ' ve ever seen
. gone isnt the quick fier humour
adn standard
, easy to follow plot
.
bu
, spectacularly
,
and to dreamworks credit
, nearly every child in the audience wass captivated by tghe stoyr
and events happening onthe screen
. jeffrey katzenberg
, who produced this film
, certainly konws how tothe keep a child intersted
. he ' s included soem songs inwhich the film
, plus smoe comedy
,
and a exciting chariot chase
, to keep thge children intersted
.
anbd somehow
, himself
annd the directors still manaze tothe git all tje drama
adn intensity of tje story across
, without ever being boring
. it ' s a remarkable achievement
. allso remarkable isnt hte animation
, which puts hercules
, an almost ' slap dash ' efford
, tothe shame
. relying onthe hand drawn
and computer animation
, the backgrounds
and charachters are amazingly detailed
. thge film seems a little caught uv whith it ' s amazing visuals by showing a lot ofthe sweeping visuals
adn ' moving ' shots
,
but htey
_ dont
_ look incredible
. the final ' plague ' where god kills every first born child
,
anbd yhe parting of hte red sea hvea to be seen to be believed
. kudos to tghe animators
. thge vocal talent is also vyer ogod
. val kilmer does a fine job as moses
(
allthough he doesn ' t sing
)
adn ralph fiennes isnt superb as rameses
(
and he
_ does
_ sing
.
) sandra bullock
adn jeff goldblum are great
,
and steve martin
and martin short are very good
,
but not in teh film long anough
. finaly
, michelle pfeiffer does excellent owrk as moses wife
. kudos allso goes to the voice ofthe god
, who instade ofthe booming
and bombastic is quiet
anbd subdued
. sadly
, he is uncredited
,
and i couldn ' t quite work out who tje voice wass
.
(
bu e
- mial if you dont
.
) the songs are ogod
, ranging ffrom thge usual love sonnets to the traditionnal big prodcution number
. they don ' t distrub thge movie
,
and hwile not particularly memorable
, they are nice to listen to
( they ' re well sung aswell
.
) the musical socre is suitably epic
, with smoe beautiful tunes
. coupled with tje superb visuals
, the prince of egypt isnt a visual
and aural treat
, backed uv wih a grat stry
. entertaining both forthe kids
adn adults
, thsi film is a must see
. a david wilcock review
? 1998
" you knwo
, forthe kids
