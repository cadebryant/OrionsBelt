. a life less ordinary is sure tothe bring about mixted feelings
. definitly a generation
- x aimed movie
, a life less ordinary has everthing from claymation tothe profane angels to a karaoke
- based muscial dream sequence
. wiew
! anyone iin thier 30 ' s or above isnt probably nto going to grasp waht cin be enjoied baout htis film
. it ' s somewhat silly
, it ' s somewhat outrageous
,
and it ' s definitely nto your tipical romance story
,
bu forthe the right audience
, it works
. a lot ofthe hype has beeen surrounding thsi film due tothe yhe fatc that it comes tothe us from the smae team that brought us trainspotting
. well sorry folks
,
but i haven ' t seen trainspotting so i can ' t really compare
. whether thgat works inspite tihs film ' s favor or nto is beyond me
.
bu i dont know thsi
: ewan mcgregor
, whom i hadnt never hadnt teh blessure of watching
, definitely charmed me
. he was grat
! cameron diaz ' s charcter ws uneven
adn a bited hard tothe grasp
. tghe audience may fidn it difficult to care about her
, thus discouraging tje hopes ofthe seeing her uite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked inot caring baout
and indentifying with him
. misguided
? you bet
. loveable
? you bet
. a life less ordinary was a delight
annd even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city
, utah
. tihs was just oney more thnig i didn ' t konw about thsi movie whn i sat down wtih a five doller order ofthe nachos
adn a three doller coke
. mabey nto knowing the premise behind thsi film made for a pleasant surprize
,
bu i htikn even if i had known
, i owudl have been jsut as hapyp
. a life less ordinary is quirky
, eccentric
,
adn downright charming
! nto for everyone
,
bu a definite change ofthe pace for your typical nihgt at tje movies
