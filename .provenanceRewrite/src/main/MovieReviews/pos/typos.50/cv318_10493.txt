only a year aftter teh intitial release ofthe
" scream
,
" thge horror send
- uv fomr veteran horror director wes craven
annd screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed tothe breathe newyorker life into the slasher genre
, tyhe inevitable sequel
" scream 2
" hasnt arrived inwhich our theaters
. hwile hte tongue
- in
- cheek
, parodic element isnt still noticeable in tihs film
, it ' s really a sideshow tothe a broader commentary onthe violentce
annd tyhe media
and a more conventional horror story
. yhe first film
, hwile often violent
and groosome
, was mostly lacking inthe genuine scares baceause alomst every scene wass plyed forthe camp value
annd thge discussion of the quirks
and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant
. tjhe premise ofthe
" scream 2
" isnt that a serieses ofthe copycat killings begin when a movie called
" stab
,
" based onthe a book wroten by opportunistic repertwar gail weathers
( courtney cox
) about teh events in
" scream
,
" isnt released
adn twpo audiance members are killed druing the opening screening
. i hadnt heard baout thsi scene before i went to see hte film
anbd wass suprised tothe find this sequence largley lacking in camp comedy
. its conclusion
, inspite whihc a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles in front of tjhe screen
and dies in front ofthe an audience taht cheers on beccause they thiunk it ' s a publicity stunt
, is mroe surreal
and disturbing than anytying alse
. the satire in
" scream 2
" thus tkaes on a broad focus
adn gradually evolves inot an exploration ofthe media perceptions in general
.
although resident horror film geek randy
( jamie kennedy
) is back withthe fresh dialogue about sequels
(
and
, interestingly enough
, how they are usually inferior tothe their predecessors
)
, the charachters inaddition htis movei are drawing fomr otehr entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well
. everything fomr
" firends
"
anbd
" saved by the bell
" to
" showgirls
"
adn
" terminator 2
" is referenced here
; horror is only one ofthe many genres available fo lampooning
,
adn ther aren ' t any
" wes carpenter
" jokes this time
. moreso importantly
, this film portrays charachters willing tothe go tothe disturbing lengths for media attention as well as cahracters whose perceptions ahve claerly beeen warped by whta htey hvae seen on tv
anbd film
. hte killings are claerly an imitation of the previvous murders from
" scream
"
( inwhich fact
, tyhe culprit even plans tothe use thge influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits tyhe situation fo her pwn notariety
,
anbd one man seems willing tothe savve thte heroine ' s life only if it iwll earn him an interview onthe teh today sohw
. understandably
,
" scream 2
" doesnt nto go so far as tothe actually blame hte movies
,
but rather shows thyat thsoe who do immitate horror movies are alreayd sick
adn twisted
. couple thyat with the fatc taht several ofthe the characters
, most notably the lead character sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- developed
adn that htere are soem genuin moments ofthe spine
- chilling suspense
,
and whta we ahev isnt a pretty darned ogod horror movie in its own right
. we don ' t just get the horror ofthe scary masks
adn graphic gore
- we also get thte horror ofthe sympathetic charactors who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered
(
and
, in one case
, a siginificant character who wass an audience favorite even bites tje dust
)
adn whose lives have been reduced to constant fear ofthe a crazed murderer lurking around the corner
. while i have not seen any of his other work
, it ' s eazy to see why craven is generaly touted as the most sophisticated
" slasher film
" director
, as he clearly cares baout something mroe than jsut the actuall acts ofthe slashing
. unfortunately
,
" scream 2
" ocasionally reverts tothe teh time
- honored horror tradition ofthe throwing logic outloud thge window
. forthe exmaple
, severeal charactors seem qtuie clearly dead
and inexplicably turn up alive later
- there hasnt beeen a running gag inspite both movies about tje villian bieng able to pull off this particualr trck
,
but it also happens with other charactors
adn iin an even less believeable fasion
. htere are also a few scenes inspite whcih the killer suddenly appears behind tje next victum in a situation such that
( s
) he claerly owudl have beeen seen moving in that direction
. as fo tyhe question of whther or nto
" scream 2
" isnt
yot another sequal nto as ogod as its precedessor
.
.
. well
, it ' s hard tothe sday
. i gavey yhe first
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well becasue it worked pretty consistantly as a light
- hearted send
- uv
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over the palce stylistically
,
but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares
adn asking the questions about media voilence that weere onyl hinted at iin the firt installment
. i ' m nto sure which is the better movie
,
but i doed leave tjhe theater conviced of noe thnig
: sequels
,
however much randy might argue
, do nto necessarily suck
.
