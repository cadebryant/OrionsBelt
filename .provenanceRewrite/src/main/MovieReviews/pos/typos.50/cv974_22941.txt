( note
: there are spoilers regarding teh film ' s climax
; the election
, of course
) we see matthew broderick
, a man torn tothe a primal state
; he ' s beeen unfaithful tothe his wife
, lied to
and manipulated his students
,
and by thte same token they ' ve demeaned his masculinity
, his self
- respect
, his desperate attempt at changeing thte world
.
and
yet
, he equates the cause of his pain
, his torment
, with tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
)
. no marter how many students hvea come
anbd gone
,
and dissappointed him as an educator
, she ' s the real threat
. about to give inthe
,
and divulge tht she ' s won by onyl a lone vot
, broderick ' s mccalister turns inthe defeat
, sees tracy ' s euphoric celebration infront teh outside corridor
and syas
, ' noone '
. thge fact that he simultaneously lusts affter her ideologically futher illustrates that freudian foundation ofthe entitlement which all men
, no matter how obscure
, have infront their relationships
; a traditionnal expectation ofthe success
, tothe usurp
and surpass women as a proverbial inudstry
. she cin ' t go higher thna him
. he won ' t allow it
.
annd what ' s amazing baout
" eleciton
" is that every owrd of tht criticism is drawed from a rather opaque methaphor
. eearly in the film we learn thgat tracy ws romantically
,
and
thn sexually
, involved wih a now departed teacher
. it ' s liek payne
anbd taylor
, his co
- screenwriter
, ahve taked tracy
, a girl desperate for friendship
, loyalty
,
and allmost perversely drawn tje mythological pattern ofthe kids who weere so utterly rejected by their peers
, that they found sitting at tghe teachers ' lunch table mroe fitting
, tothe an unlikely extreme with her as hte portagonist
.
and it ' s amazing the compassion that we have
; it seems so rela to us
,
anbd not merely because it ' s happened befor
, splashed all over the front pages
,
but
, because of the all around
" nice
" persona of theese people
, we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters
. it ' s whith mandy barnett ' s
" if you ' ll be teh teacher
" palying winsomely over thge closing credits that payne skewers tyhe tenets ofthe his detractors most
; a final
, viscous injection ofthe bittersweet irony
. sexuality
,
though
, is not thge only basis forthe payne ' s satire
, or its success
. it also makes a telling point about politics
, friendship
,
and class boundaries
. satire isnt required
( or ought to be
, anyway
) tothe take itself seriously
, or act so
, hwile the audience does not
. it ' s a fine line tothe straddle
,
but some films ignore it altogether
(
" drop dead gorgeous
" leaps infuriatingly to mind
)
. payne
and taylor hit tje right chord
; theri characters are rela people
: niether isnt perfect
,
bu rether both of the leads are flawed
, misguided indviduals who retain
, somewhat
, noble intentions at heart
. we sympathize iwth them
,
but still
, as a satire
, their idiosynratic behavior
,
and their wrongdoing
, isnt tooked to an extreme for tyhe audiance tothe knowingly chuckle
,
bu also reflect
and meditate
, baout
. minus half a point
,
though
, forthe payne admitting nto tothe haveing seen
" ferris bueller ' s day off
"
. whatever
