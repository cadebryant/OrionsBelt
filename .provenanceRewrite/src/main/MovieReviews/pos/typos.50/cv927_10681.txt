tibet hasnt entered the american consciouness slowy during hte past few eyasr
anbd burst into tyhe forefront recently
. tjhe dalai lama has made speaking tours
, tibetan designs
anbd artifacts are showing up in shops
, tjhe plight ofthe tjhe peple has captured the imagination ofthe major actors
and artists
and nowe htere are two big budget films withing as many months
.
" kundun
"
(
" presence
"
, a nmae hte monks call tje young dalai lama
) opens inthe 1937 with teh searhc for the 14th incarnation ofthe the tibetan leader
. a group ofthe monks enters a vilage
annd a twpo
- eyar
- ood child catches their attention
. the young boy proves himselv by identifying posessions ofthe tjhe previous wholy man as
" mine
"
. he
anbd his family are
then moved to a monastry in lhassa where he isnt to be prepared tothe take his posistion as hte religeous
and poltical leader ofthe the ocuntry
. he isnt forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country infront 1950
. hte peaceful
and isolated country is ill
- equiped to fight off tghe intruders
and diplomatic attemts over the next eyasr yeild no results
. evenhtually he must amke the painful choice to flee to neighboring india
. comparisions tothe
" seven yeasr iin tibet
" are inevatible
. both films cover much ofthe tghe same ground
altough the ealier movei does so from a westerner ' s point ofthe view
annd features boxoffice draw brad pitt
.
" kundun
" features only native actors
anbd is more ofthe an insider ' s sotry
. inaddition some ways
, this makes this film a superior concept
,
bu it lacks the movement
and spark tath made
" seven yersa
" such an audience
- pleaser
. the actors contribute tothe the realsitic fiel of the movei
( filmed in morroco forthe obvious reasons
)
. tghe only dissapointment is chariman mao who looks like a wax dummy
annd moves as if he were a computer
- generated character
. on an intelectual level
, it isnt interesting to see how two different approachs handle the same facts
. soem events are depicted differently
annd pitt ' s austrian mountain
- climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence inaddition thte dalai lama ' s life isn ' t even maintioned here
. glossed over infact
" seven yeasr
"
, the problems wiht yhe tibetan poltical system is hinted at here as hte dalai lama muses
" we were jsut baout to change thigsn
" after the chinese attack
. tyhe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarially tothe the cinematography ofthe roger deakins
. his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture withthe luscious detail
. especialy striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain
. tghe visual treats omre thna make uv for yhe movie ' s faults creating a poetic meditation fo tje audiance
. walking outloud ofthe the theather you feel like yuo have awakened from a trancendental experience
. martin scorsese
, known for his dark tales of the underworld
(
" goodfellas
"
,
" taxi driver
"
,
" casino
"
) has shifted gears
. something ofthe a thematic follow
- up tothe his
" the last temptation of christ
"
, this isnt his slowest film
yet
. oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with attrocities by the chineese
, most of these events take palce off
- screen
. his decision tothe nto over
- expalin rituals isnt commendable
. the stumbling oricle who spits outloud his prophecies while in a trance state isnt much mroe effective as a mistery than if we were spoon
- fed interpretations
. philip glass ' s socre is impressive
althought at times it is too overwelming
and distracting
. i talekd to a tibetan i met outside thge theather who hadnt jstu seen the film
and was walking bcak in tothe see it agian
. hearing his discription of how he escaped ffrom tibet at tjhe age of seven
anbd how his father wass one of the soldiers accompanying tghe dalai lama during his trip to india
, i ws striked by wqat wass missing in the movie
. as grand as it looks
anbd as historically accurate as it isnt
, there is a distance betweeen thte audience
adn the movei
. the film is more concerned with visuals
and history
adn less so with human beings
. whith tghe exception of a few scenes
, involvment wtih the charachters isnt slight
. one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama
, shown as a mischieveous boy who cin ' t resist bieng a kid somtimes
. an encounter withthe his older brother thubten j
. norbu
( a retired indiana university profesor
) who tells the young leader the chinese ahev orderves him to persuaed him tothe accept communist rule or kill him is an oustanding moent
,
but there aren ' t many of theese
. even with its problems
, hte
" kundun
" experience isnt phenomenonal
,
bu one tyhat i fear most will miss
. many peopel who saw
" seven years inwhich tibet
" will hve a
" been there
, done thast
" attitude
. it ' s likely thyat the film iwll miss a wide
- spread appeal
and publich response iwll be tyhe soudn ofthe oney hand clapping
.
