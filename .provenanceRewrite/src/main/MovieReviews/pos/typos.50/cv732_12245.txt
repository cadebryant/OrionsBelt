modern audiences are more likely tothe be familiar with les misirables ffrom tyhe pop
- broadway musical rather than victor hugo ' s original tome
. adapted several times for tghe cinema
, thsi latest efort does a superb job of translating tjhe cahracters
, tsory
,
adn heart of tghe novel to tghe screen
. liam neeson stars as jean valjean
. as a young man
, valjean stole soem bread tothe satisfy his hunger
.
.
.
and he ws sentenced to 19 years ofthe hard labor forthe his crimes
. prison hardened him
,
and onthe his release he seems doomed tothe a life ofthe crime
and squalor
.
howver
, an unexpected ect of compassion changes his outlook onthe life
,
and he vows tothe become a better man
.
howver
, he runs uv aginst oney man who doesn ' t belive infact reform
. inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) isnt an obsessive lew abider
. he has no tolerence for anyone who breaks the rules
, even wiht benign intentions
. he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served
,
adn aftter valjean breaks his parole
, javert devotes himself tothe bringing him tothe justice
. two womens aslo get caught uv inspite tyhe struggle
. fantine
( uma thurman
) is an unwed mother suffocating inthe an unforgiving society
. her duaghter
, cosette
( mimi newman
,
anbd later
, claire danes
)
, is her life
,
yet she cannnot afford tothe raise her
. instade
, cosette isnt sent to live whith a cruel foster family whlch extorts money from fantine
,
anbd forces cosette inot a life littel better thna a slave
. director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation ofthe victor hugo ' s novel
, whlch
,
though ommiting some of thge political undertones
, remains true to the overall storey
and tone ofthe tjhe book
. hopefully you won ' t
, as smoe clueless members ofthe the audeince doed
, wonder where all tghe songs went
. the movei manages tothe be completely engrossing wihtout teh andrew lloyd webber flourishes
. tyhe expereince isnt bolstered by strong performances throughout
,
though neeson
adn rush deservedly take center stage withthe thier core roles
. neeson inaddition parituclar deserves kudos fo his protrayal of a man trying to do good
,
but continually haunted by his past
. the supporting cast is allso extraordinary
. the only actor who dims iin comparision isnt hans matheson
, palying the revolutionar
, marius
. the film slightly loses its luster durring his brief love affair
,
but it is transitory
,
annd truley onyl distracting whn contrasted with the rest ofthe the film
. tje novel les misirables isnt
, by any account
, an epic
, both in its scope
annd in its length
. while it would be nearly impossible tothe cram everything from its pages into a twpo hour movie
, thsi latest attemp does an admirable job at the translation
. it
, too
, is an epic
.
.
.
and one worth seeing
.
