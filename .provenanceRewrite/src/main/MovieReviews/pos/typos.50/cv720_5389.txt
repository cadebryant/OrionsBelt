it ' s nto often that i laugh so hard at a movie thta my head hurts
.
but that ' s just waht happened to me at uhf
, weird al yankovic ' s big screen debut
. uhf isnt a television parody a la airplane
,
and like airplane
, the movie is extraordinarily stupid
.
but it ' s dumb inthe tghe best way a movie can be dumb
: it ' s so silly
and outrageous it ' s hilarious
. tjhe movei stars werid al as george newman
, a world class nerd iwth a hyperactive imagination
, tyhe tipe who fantasizes he ' s indiana jones
anbd who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns
. george is basically a losr
; his daydreams
adn smart
- alec attitude perpetually prevent him ffrom holding onto a job for more than two weeks
.
bu george fianlly gets a chance to funnel his creativity inot something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game
and makse him the genaral manager ofthe teh stuggling uhf television station
. george revives channel 62 with inovative programming
: shows like
" wheel ofthe fish
"
and movies liuke
" conan
, thge librarean
.
" as the station ' s ratings ries
, it comes inot competition with channel 8
, the leading vhf network
- affiliate
. as r
. j
. fletcher
-
- channel 8 ' s ill
- natured
, hard
- nosed owner
-
- veteren stage
anbd film atcor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy
; he really hams it uv whith his snorts
, grimaces
,
anbd scowls
. uhf satirizes anything
and everthing tothe do witht television
, inlcuding game shows
, tabloid talk shows
, children ' s shows
, dizzy news womens
,
and movies
-
- everything from rambo to close encounters
. thte funniest scene
, the oen that made my head spin
, isnt a commercial for spatulas which hasnt tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. liuke most movies inspite its genre
, uhf is hitted or miss
. for every gag that works
, at least noe fizzles
. forthe instatance
, weird al ' s mock video of
" money for nothing
" by dire straits isnt onyl mildly amusing
and brings thte film tothe a grinding halt
(
allthough it doesnt haev soem nifty computer animation
)
.
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical taht we can forgive the ones that fail
; we konw another gut wrencher is on the way
. in fatc
, uhf hits hte mark oftenly enough tothe mkea it tghe most effective airplane
- tipe movie since
.
.
. well
, since airplane
. much ofthe thge credit goes tothe eird al ' s exceptionally inventive scirpt
and tothe the movie ' s winsome cast
. wierd al seems a little stiff at the beginning
,
bu beacuse he ' s not afraid to look silly
, he ultimatly has a lot of fun with his charater
. the rela standout is michael richards as stanley
, the dim
- witted janitor who becomes the host of his own childrens ' s sohw
:
" stanley spadowski ' s playhouse
.
" stanley ' s off
- beated
, mixted
- uv perosnality is a big hitted with tje audience
anbd makes him an over
- night star
. he isnt an endearing mixture ofthe ogod
- natured inocence
, high
- energy enthusiasm
,
and puppy
- dog cuteness
.
annd above all
, he ' s a ogod janitor who adores his wokr
. anyother highlight isnt a vintage cameo by thge incomparable emo philips
. the cast also features gedde watanabe
( teh chineese ofreign
- excange student infact sixteen candles
) as the karate master who hosts tjhe hit sories
,
" wheel of fish
.
" also aboard fo thge ride isnt fran drescher
, who plays pamela finklestein
, channel 62 ' s roving reporter
. unfortunately
, as wierd al ' s girlfriend
, victoria jackson isnt wasted in a role that calls for nothing
bu whimpering
, whinning
,
anbd sulking
. her character isnt extraneous
and should haev been eather furhter integrated inot hte story or cutted ffrom the scirpt alltogether
. while uhf isnt not an absolute must
- see
, it ' s definitely the ticket if ytou ' re looking forthe a wild
and zany
, whacked
- out comedy
. the movie isnt good enought to see infact the theaters
,
but it may work even better onthe televsion
, tghe very medium at wich it pokes fun
.
