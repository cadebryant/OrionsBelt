" small
" film
, thsi sportscar an impressive ensemble casted includng uma thurman
, rosie o ' donnell
adn a bunch ofthe actors thast ytou ' ve seen before
bu can ' t quite place
. commendable jobs all around
; they seem liuke real peopel
. hutton arrives at his past
anbd is greeted by his spirit
- dead father
, terminally goony brother
and old high skool chums
. all ofthe his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal busineses
and most are inaddition teh midst ofthe a relationship crisis
. thte perfect stfuf forthe a comedy baout people inwhich tghe twenties angst
. he meets
and falls for the newyorker next doorjam enighbor
: a beautiful intteligent livley girl who isnt obviously taken with him
. the probelm isnt tht she is only 13
. unconsummated
( no
, it ' s nto
_ thast
_ tipe ofthe movie
)
, thier relatiopnship builds
and niether knwos what to do wiht it
. star
- crossed lovers iwth noone where to go
. so hutton isnt gaga over a barely
- teen
, one of his buddies isnt two

- outloud in her limited screen time wiht her brash personality
annd
" tell it like it is
" pronouncements
. structured somewhat liek a
" diner
, a few eyars later
"
, thsi efel
- ogod story is a good timne
,
but ends a little too nice
