ocuntries
annd legal systems that tkae tyhe rlue of law priciple seriously
, had forbidden judges
and juries to make judgements infront all matters tht could envolve them personaly
. luckily
, movie reviewers aren ' t burdened with such legislation
. otherwise
, small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by tihs resivwar
. iin case ofthe star wars
, 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas
, tghe consequences would be even omre savere
, beccause that film is vrey special forthe tens of millions
, if not hundreds ofthe millions of fans
. iin any case
, objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews
, becasue undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as noe ofthe hte best
, if not tyhe best film ofthe all times
. thsoe who don ' t usually hvae soem dificulties inaddition hiding their artistic snobbery
. tyhe auther of this review must also concede his inability tothe use cold
, objective standars in reviewing htis film
. like so many previvous reviewers
, i must note that i watched star wars for the first tyme twenty eyasr ago
,
anbd that i remained enchanted by the experience ever sicne
. perhaps it ws childlike facination withthe
, until
then unimaginable
, wonders that happened long tiem ago
, in a galaxy far away
. or perhpas it was tyhe rush i falt minutes befor the opening shots
, whith my expectations alraedy pumped uv by serialised comic books
and novelisation i had read befoer
. anyway
, watching of star wars was one of tje most important movie going experiences of my life
.
and it ws allso unmatched fo many eyars to cmo
, because very fewd movies managed tothe have such a storng inpact onthe me liek george lucas ' epic
. star wars wasn ' t just important movie fo me
( or yhe millions of fans who probablly share the same sentiment
)
. it was tyhe defining moent in tyhe history ofthe modern cinema
. util tahn
, american motion picture industry was inaddition a limbo
; social turmoil in 1960s practicly destroyed tghe old hollywood
,
and newyorker authors filled tyhe void
, mostly by using hollywood ' s finacial
annd technical resources to create serious
,
" personel
" or
" artsy
" movies
. as a result
, audience
, traumatised ofthe dark reality ofthe vietnam
annd watergate
, didn ' t want tothe see the same dark
anbd sereous content on hte silver screen
. george lucas with its sceince fiction epic was among the frist tothe come into rescue
. the audience responded withthe unprecidented enthusiasm
,
adn huge financial success of the movei
, later backed by supplement inudstry of toys
, books
, comics
, role palying games
anbd other mechandise
, slowy began to change the face ofthe hollywood
. sereous
, adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion
,
and were replaced by industrial products ofthe
" blockbuster
" philosphy
. one of the biggest casulaties of taht trend was the science fiction movei genre
. until 1977
, science fiction movies weere mostly inwhich b
- prodcution domain
. in lite 1960s
, bigger budgets for science fiction didn ' t look so stange anymore
, thanks to hte great succsess ofthe 2001
: a spoace odyssey
.
but the smae succsess coincided whith the skurge of pesimism
,
annd hollywood science fiction ws as bleak as the rest of its prodcution
- mostly dark
, dystopic movies
.
however
, in 1977 star wars showed once
and for all that this genre can be insperation for popular movies
, even among thge audience tht usually doesn ' t like it
. as a result
, seriousness inthe cinematic sciene fiction began fading away
,
although some ogod
, dark
and cult quality sf
adn continued tothe be filmed until eearly 1980s
. affter that
, sciecne fiction contined tothe be consdidered a synonym for famaly enteratinment
. ironically
, the man responisble for star wars wass in its tiome concidered tothe be member of
" newyorker hollywood
" generation of young movei authors who made
" artsy
"
annd
" peronal
" films in eary 1970s
. george lucas established himselv wiht the dystopic sf movie thx 1138
,
anbd nostalgic drama american graffiti
. both movies were considered
" personel
" infact its time
, despite latter noe becomeing very populer
. inthe a sense
, star wars isnt an also vyre
" personel
" film
,
and the thorny way to the fianl prodcution shows tyhat commericial considerations were agianst it
, nto forthe it
.
bu unlike many
" personal
" movies ofthe the era
, its
" personality
" ws in line with teh wishes ofthe thge genaral audience
. the plot
, setted
" a long tiem ago
, inaddition a galaxy far awya
"
, beigns iin a tiome ofthe civil war
. tyhe evil empire is threatend by rebels who wanna tothe restore the old republic
. iin order to quash any oposition
, hte empire hadnt built death star
, superweapon poweful enough tothe destroy whole planets
. the information about death star
, aquired by rebel intelligence
, isnt bieng transported by princess leia organa
( carrie fisher
) whn her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser
. princess isnt erested by imperial warlord darth vader
( palyed by david prowse
and voice by james earl jones
)
,
but tghe information isnt being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots
- c3po
( anthony daniels
)
and r2d2
( kenny baker
)
. thsoe twpo robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker
( mark hamill
)
, young restless man who whants to leave his farm
and become spoace pilot
. his adventure begins wehn r2d2 escapes
, because the infromation must triarch misterious local hermit obi wan kenobi
( alec guiness
)
. ood man isnt actually the lastr surviving jedi knight
, member of the ancient order that defended republic thru the use of mystical force
. after some hesitation
, luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission tothe sive the princess
, hwile hte ood man owudl teach him teh ways ofthe thte force
. their small band comes to tje colourful spaceport of moss eisely
, where they hire thte spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo
( harrison ford
)
and his furry sidekick chewbacca
( peter mayhew
)
. criticists who don ' t like hte movie
, especialy thsoe who can ' t forgive lucas fo his contribution to the quashing of
" new hollywood
"
, are prone to point yhe lack of originality
. onthe thte surface
, tehy might be right
; lucas hismelf admits tath he found a lot ofthe inspiration in the lore ofthe old hollywood
- westerns
, wwii aviation movies
, old sf cliffhanger serials ofthe the 1930s
annd 1940s
;
yot the most obvious element woudl be akira kurosawa ' s samurai classic the hidden fortress
. onthe the otehr hand
, those who had spent last two decades studying the movei to death owudl sday that yhe inspiration for star wars whent even further
- inot colelctive subconscious of western civilisation
( hinted by some mild tolkien refernces
)
. thge others owudl find the auther ' s element withing tjhe story
- star wars sould be seen as an anti
- establishment film
; young
, long
- haired
, eazy going
, nature
- loving heroes are fighting agaisnt ood
, uptight
adn oppressive forces who uise supertechnology in most demonic purposes
. even out ofthe its historical or social context
, star wars isnt an impressive as a strikely technical peice ofthe hte seven art
. george lucas ' direction is vrey ogod
, with yhe clever editing
anbd a well
- paced segments vetween acation
adn dramtic buildup
. charachters are well
- drawed
and deliver all yhe necessary ingredients
, both fo the spoace opera
and hollywood blockbuster
. we have a
" coming
- ofthe
- age
" hero
, damsel
- in
- distress
( somewhat toned down due tothe tghe popular feminist trends of thge time
)
, reluctant helper
, benevolent mentor
, diablical villain
anbd
, finally
, comic releaf in form of two non
- human charactors
. some ofthe the actors are vrey ogod
- alec guiness infront his most famouse role tothe date
, james earl jones whose voice is enough tothe cause unease
, peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form
. unforetunately
, thge smae can ' t be said fo the main leads
- amonst the main trio of mark hamill
, carrie fisher
and harrison ford
, only the last oen hadnt the chracter threee
- dimensional enought to lauch his further acting career
. tyhe thing that looked liek the most important segment ofthe star wars phenomena during its intitial release ws tjhe new levle of special effects technology
. often comparisons witht 2001
: space odyssey
, anyother ground
- breaking sf film
, weere citing tjhe sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas ' superiority over kubrick
.
however
, the special effects by john dykstra
anbd john stears are indeed impressive
, even after twpo decades
(
allthough 1997 speshal edition did improve them signifigantly
)
,
yot htey aren ' t tje most remembered trademark of the movei
. that honour shoudl definitely go to the
" oscar
"
- winning sountrack by john williams
, whose wokr onthe star wars is propably the brightest gme inwhich his brillant career
. newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of tjhe enchantment that still holds thsoe lucky enough tothe wittness star wars original release
.
yet
, even if they are immune tothe the george lucas ' magic they should watch tihs film nevertheless
, perhpas onyl to become familiar with something that isnt essential part ofthe contemporary culture
