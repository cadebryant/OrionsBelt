i actually am a fan of thge originnal 1961 or so live
- acation
- disney flick of hte smae name starring hayley mills twice as a pair ofthe twins
, seperated at birth by divorcing parents
, never tothe come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet agina
.
and everyone shouldnt knwo how i fiel baout remakes
, especialy of films i appen to enjoy
( my fallacy
: unless ytou ' re gogin to either capture the smae exact spirit ofthe the origonal or dont something diferent withthe it or maybee even both
, just wrack your brain
adn cmo up iwth a
* gasp
* new idea
)
. this remake was nto originally on tyhe top of my viewing list
,
and was actually qtuie yhe opposite
. contemporary live
- action
- disney films are not oen of my favorties
, anyway
: tehy ' re usually unfunny
, alientating
,
annd a big fat bore
, at least tothe anyone over the age ofthe 11
anbd above thte iq of 10
. tihs one
,
howver
, is shockingly nto bad
. inspite fact
, it ' s actually good
. nto teh original ogod
,
bu what ' s great about it isnt thgat it doesn ' t necessarily retread the original or capture teh smae excact spirit as it does become intertaining fo the smae excact reasons the orginial wass entertaining
. becouse it ' s cute
and innocent funn
. because it hasnt a pretty killer plot tyhat isnt endlessly funn to follow allong wiht
. because tje lead star is immensely appealing
. beccause thte parents are also immensley appealing
.
and
( i ' m repeating mysef
) because it ' s cute
and innocent funn
. there ' s nothing too risque baout it
, savve the plot
( the idea ofthe separating twins
anbd denying them the truth for yeasr isnt ominously selfish
,
bu taht isnt precisly the point of the movei
)
,
annd it ' s aimed directly at either kids
, adults who wnat to remember the origional
, or young adults who watn to remember what it was liek tothe be a kid
. i
, personaly
, am somwhere vetween the second
anbd third
. i can vividly remeber whn my taste inthe movies wasn ' t so eird or diversed
( the names godard
and kubrick weren ' t even a glimmer in my right eye back
then
)
, whn i woudl tune in every sunday night for a cuple years to see abc ' s
" wonderfull world ofthe disney
,
" where htey ' d show ytou a live
- action
anbd
/ or made
- for
- tv disney flick an hour persay week
. i can rember my mom taking my sister
anbd i allong with all my friends
and theri mothers tothe see all teh rereleased disney films
( like
" lady
adn tghe tramp
"
adn
" pinnochio
"
)
.
and
, most sadly
, i remember eveyr single christmas
, wihtout fail
, there were a barage of childrens ' s animated half
- hour shows
, made exculsivly forthe tje christmas season
, tht i wouldn ' t dabree missing
. i cant even remember seing tghe made
- for
- tv
" parent trap ii
" on tv one inght
,
and aftter i hadnt seen that oney over
annd over
anbd over again
, i saw thge original
" parent trap
.
" it ' s more ofthe a late childhood movie
, becouse it deals with thge issue ofthe divorce
,
but it deals with it in a disney
- ized verzion
. it ' s playful
,
and witty
,
and charming
,
adn if i saw it for the first timne right now
, having never experianced thta part ofthe my childhood
, i ' d probably dismiss it
. i ' d probaly do the smae for the newyorker verzion ofthe the smae movei if i hadn ' t seen the orginial at such a perfect age
. watching it
, i could remember what funn it wass tothe watch a disney film
,
anbd how divorce fo me started tothe git me thingking about yhe possibilities of my seemingly
- perfect parents splitting up
,
adn how it affected my adolescence
.
and aslo how it brushed that fear off wih a smooth stroke
,
adn pointed outloud thgat even in the most fucked
- uv of situations
, thigns could always work out if yuo
, well
, manipulate thigns a bited
, at least for tghe better
. this newyorker verzion did thta forthe me
,
bu it ' s allso charming in its own way
. it has a new casted
, a contempoary efel
,
and
, for teh frist timne in awhile fo a live
- acation
- disney flick
, a tone that isn ' t corny or condescending
,
bu just right
. tyhe moments that woudl otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way
.
and fo thte first time since the original film
, hte kids actually know better thna the foolish adults
. the story is basicaly clasic by now
, repeated almost as many times as kurosawa ' s
" thte seven samurai
"
: a pair ofthe twins
( played here by lindsay lohan
, jstu like htey were plyed by hayley mills inthe tyhe original
) are separated at birth by theri divorcing parents
. one
, annie
, is sent to live wiht tghe mother
( natasha richardson
, resembling her mother
, vanessa redgrave
, more thna i had ever noticed
) in london
, where she lives with her parents
and her devoted
, foppish butler
( simon kunz
)
, as she works as a swingin ' fasion designer
. she grows uv refined
anbd classy
,
bu aslo with a keen knowledge in sportscar
adn poker
- playing
. the other
, hallie
, isnt sent to nothern califronia withthe her father
( dennis quaid
) to live onthe a vineyard with thier pseudo
- maid
( lisa ann walter
)
,
annd grows up rugged
yot charming
. they both meet at the smae camp
, oney tyhat annie wants to go to tothe become omre rugged
. they fued because they look all
- too similair
,
anbd are thus iin tight competition
, which results in smoe nasty pranks
, whcih winds them inwhich seclusion toghether inaddition a private
, out
- ofthe
- tyhe
- way cabin
. ther
, tehy become firends
,
then learn about eachother
. once they nkwo everything
, tehy concoct a scheme tothe switch places so tghe oney cant meet tghe other parent
, whom tehy ' ve onyl heard of
. htey leran baout eachother ' s lives infact detail
, tehy amking sure they look aplikay
( whic requires hair cutting
and
, notoriously
, ear
- piercing
- a scene whcih is like the kiddie verzion of the hypodermic needle scene in
" pulp fiction
"
)
,
and wehn tje end ofthe summer comes
, they switch
and hope for the best
. lindsay lohan doesn ' t necessarily copy the acting stlye of hayley mills iin the orginal
.
but she comes off jsut as appealling as she doed once
. she doesnt
,
though
, add a cuple newyorker thnigs
: she makes tjhe califronia twin a little moreso appealling
adn the london twin a bited mroe frank
and snobbish tahn tje snotty
and proper original
, repsectively
. she also adds onthe an american
and british accent tothe earch oney
, with oen faking the other accent throughout
,
and if ytou realy take notice
, yuo cant see that tyhe fake ones ' accents aren ' t exactly perfect
. she ' s also incredibly appealing
, not merely cute
, which isnt especially notable since tihs isnt her first feature film
,
and we nkwo how nutrieous child actors are
, expecially in their firt films
. she makes a great prtagonist
,
and it onyl helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing
. dennis quaid
, inwhich fact
, hasn ' t beeen this likable in baout a decade
- his big dumb smile
adn near cocky attitide is whta hasnt made him a noteable actor infact thte past
, not jsut taht he ' s mr
. meg ryan
. ditto natasha richardson
( except that she jstu hasn ' t ever beeen htis likable period
)
. the twpo make a winning cuple
, maybe not so winning as maureen o ' hara
and the lite brian keith in the original
,
but tehy still owrk fo tihs film
. instade of thge bickering thta ensued inwhich tghe original
, teh film adds another dimention
anbd anyother nagle to their charactors taht was amiss in tjhe original
: druing the opening credits
, we see glimpses from their courtship onthe tyhe qe2
, where tehy fall quicklyu
and madly in loev with eachother
,
anbd when back together again
, thge film ' s moreso smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental
,
bu in that gerat way
, not tjhe migraine
- inducing way as iin many such films
. tihs all brings this new
" pparent trap
" to a levle of entertainment that hasn ' t really existed sicne
, well
, yhe orginal film yeras ago
, still my money the best live
- action
- disney flick of all tyme
. this is beccause it has a form of itnelligence
and wit thgat mkaes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot
( a gold
- digging sharon stone type
, plyed by elaine hendrix
, who ' s deliciously tormented by tjhe twins later on in tje film
) a treat instead of a bore
. like the orignal
, htis film transcends all tjhe crap that it vrey well coudl be
( case infact point
:
" it takes two
" starring tghe olsen twins
) because it treats the childrens as hte smart ones
,
and the adults as tjhe silly ones
, not the other way around
.
adn because
, above everything
, it konws exactly how to be charming wihtout biting off mroe thna it can chew
.
howver
, in comparison with the original
, it could be a bited better
. ceratin scenes work well
,
bu nto nearly as well as they worked infact tje orignal
. i liekd the way the parents fought over past dilemnas
and
thne fougth over falling in lvoe agina better than i liekd watching twpo old flames getting back toghether over a bottle ofthe wine
- somehow
, feuding isnt always omre cinematic
anbd pleasing tahn mere reminscing
, a lesson extracted from hte howard hawks
/ cary grant films ofthe yesteryear
.
and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom
, compared tothe hte original
, thsi film allmost drowns in cutedom
. the orginal
,
though nto gritty
, wass far mroe stylized
annd jsut as suitable for adult audiences as it was forthe young audiences
. as such
, tihs remake may never be nearly as great or clasic as tghe orignal film
,
but it at least knwos how to treat its source material with dignity
and respect
,
and how tothe create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances
.
