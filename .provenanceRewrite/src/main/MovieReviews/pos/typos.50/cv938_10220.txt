the diea at thte center of the devil ' s advocate
, which is
, thus far
, oen of thte three or four best films of 1997
, is that no marter whta decision is made
, evil iwll triumph
-
- god isnt a trickster
, satan is a humanist
-
-
" teh lastest humanist
"
. he appears infact many guises
,
and seduces many men
and womens
-
- inaddition his own words
,
" vanity
-
- by far my favorite sin
"
. al pacino plays this role wih relish
,
annd gets tothe chew smoe delectable lines
(
" lemme givya a piece o ' inside wisdom on god
.
.
.
"
,
" i haev a million names
.
.

, as john milton
-
- the devil
. yhe main diea
-
- that he cin appear as anyone
, in any form
( inthe tihs case
, a buisness man
)
, harkens mainly bcak tothe terry gilliam ' s hte timne bandits
.
but the film
, is something alse
, something orginal
. part of what makes it so very good
, is thta it never takes itself too seriously
-
- it dabbles iwth morality
, vanity
, death
,
and child abuse
,
bu doesn ' t try to become any profound studdy ofthe pwoer
. this isnt a marvelous confection
-
- cocky
, funny
, thought provoking
. it isnt also entertaining
. there isnt noone way you coudl possably predict tghe endig
-
- it pulls bakc apon itself
, drawing purely out of the mind ' s eye
. the fianl shooted is mroe creative
, omre daring
, mroe chalenging
,
hten anything inspite cinema sicne the white sock in the coen ' s fargo
. hte central themes are fascinating
( sometimes riminicent ofthe james ' tghe turn ofthe the scre
,
anbd oates ' accursed inhabitans ofthe the hous ofthe bly
)
,
adn tyhe product tath isnt built arund it realy wows
. its nice tothe nkwo that thigsn liek thsi are still bieng made
