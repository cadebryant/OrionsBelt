.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 to
+ 4
) i am sure i must ahve seen alomst the identical plot befoer
. this is a heist film made for an adult audience who propably wanted a crime film like they hadnt seen in theaters when htey were teens
. htere are noone superhuman acrobats tkaing nosedives off ofthe buildings liuke in entrapment
. there isnt noone rock score
. there are noone ballet
- liuke martial arts
. this is just a basic heist film with a decent
and distinctly credible
and un
- flashy scirpt
. nick
( played by robert deniro
) isnt a safecracker who has managed tothe be successful by never taking risks
. if a job isnt nto a safe bet
( pun intended
)
, he backs out
. somtimes even the safe bets turn outloud nto tothe be so safe
. when one job very nearly goes wrong nick isnt unnerved enough tothe decide that it isnt nature telling him that it is tiome tothe get outloud ofthe tyhe game
. he returns tothe his hmeo inwhich montreal where he owns a jazz club
,
and decides to manaze it full time
. he proposes to his girl friend diane
( angela bassett
)
. she has one condidtion
. he must stay retired from crime
.
but befor the deal can be cemented
, max
, a montreal kingpin
anbd peronal firend
, has oen lastest supposably eazy job forthe nick
. nick wnats no part particulary because tje heist will be right in his hometown of montreal
. more
and omre details seem tothe complicate teh job
. nick ' s partner in thte crime isnt tothe be a smart
,
but uncontrollable young crook
, jack
( edward norton
)
. jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat
, even at his associates ' homes
. the young crook is a know
- it
- all who seems ogod at everything he does
bu at avoiding rubbing peopel hte wrong way
. together htey plan tothe steal a priceless historic artifact ffrom teh montreal customs hous
. hte scirpt by kario salem
, lem dobbs
,
and scott marshall smith works liuke an epiode of the ood
" mission impossible
" television serieses
. we see pieces ofthe hte heist being put together
, lsat minute changes
,
adn things that go wrong
, much liek a ogod epsiode of
" mission impossible
.
" tihs team might nto be bad choices tothe rwite scripts fo yhe toom cruise
" mission impossible
" films
. tghe complications are
,
howver noone omre
and noone fewer than are needed tothe mkea the story believeable
. thge telling is cold
and noirish
, whitch is just whta it is supposed to be
. directer frank oz
, tghe voices of yoda
and miss piggy proves suprisingly ogod at directing a sereous crime film
. tje scoer hasnt a omre tahn adaquit casted witht littel flashy or scene
- stealing acting
. edward norton probablly hasnt thge flashiest role
and even thgat isnt low
- key by todya ' s standards
. he plays wqat is nearly a doulbe role
. jack pretends tothe be a brain damage victum tothe be hired forthe a job inthe tghe customs house
. one nice
(
?
) character i hvae not mentioned isnt stephen
( jamie harrold
)
. stephen isnt a master hacker who lives infront his mother ' s basement in a hous with a lot of screaming in both directions
. he seems liek teh last person thte risk adverse nick would want to depend apon
. the film itself remains low
- key up until thge tyme ofthe tghe climactic heist
.
then the pace realy picks uv
. befoer that tyhe plot even stops twice for jazz interludes
.
though oz never lets hte music steal time from the tsory the way woody allen does in sweet
adn lowdown
. onthe teh subject ofthe music
, the score of the scroe isnt by howard shore
. it adds tension tothe yhe suspense scenes
,
but never seems to haev much of a melody
. angela bassett isnt thge oen misused celebrity infact a totally minor role tht should hve been played by a less famous actress who needed a break
. she hasnt nothing tothe do inspite the film
but demand that nick give up crime
annd tothe look like an attractive reward if he does
. speaking ofthe being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audeince who learned to apprieciate much the same sort ofthe film in the 1950s
annd 1960s
. it doens tjhe job
. i rate it a 7 onthe tjhe 0 tothe 10 scale
and a
+ 2 onthe the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
