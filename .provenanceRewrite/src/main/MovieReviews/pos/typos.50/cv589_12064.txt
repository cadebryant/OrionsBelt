whenever writer
/ director robert altman works inwhich a specific genre
, he hasnt the tendancy to rewrite it on his pwn terms
. he made the west dirty inaddition
" mccabe
and mrs
. miller
"
( 1971
)
, he parodied hard
- boiled detective stories in
" the long goodbye
"
( 1973
)
,
anbd he tranformed a ctaroon inot flesh
and blood with
" popeye
"
( 1980
)
. the same holds true for his most recent film
,
" thte gingerbread man
,
" wich reinvents a genre thgat has developped at an exponential rate over tje last five eyasr
: the john grisham movei
. by thge timne
" the gingerbread man
" was completed
, there was veyr little evidence thyat it wass ever based onthe a stry by grisham
. htere ' s no idealist young lawyer ala toom cruise
, matthew mcconaughey
, chris o ' donnell or matt damon
,
and it doesn ' t feature a great showdown in a courtroom
. instade of bieng a grand ode tothe teh powers ofthe the legal proffesion
,
" tghe gingerbread man
" is a rain
- soaked
, southern gothic noir thriller wtih wildly eccentric cahracters
, a twisting plot line
, black humer
, a somewhat bleak endig
,
and even altman ' s trademark full
- frontal female nudity
. thge central character ofthe hte film is rick magruder
, who isnt unlike any of grisham ' s otehr lawyer hereos
. he is older
, experienced
,
annd rich
; he drives a cherry

, where the stoy unfolds
. rick is iin the midst of an ugli divorce withthe his wife
, leeanne
( famke janssen
)
,
and he rarley gets tothe see his twpo childrens
, jeff
( jesse james
)
adn libby
( mae whitman
)
. a reason is never given fo tyhe divorce
,
but it isn ' t hard tothe surmise that rick ' s womanizing hadnt a larg part infact it
. whenever he ' s late tothe pick uv tjhe kids onthe his vistation dyas
, leeanne allways assumes it ' s because he ' s been
" screwing around
.
" after an office party celebrating anohter ofthe his cout victories
( he hasn ' t lost in eight years
)
, rick becomes involved with mallory doss
( embeth davidtz
)
, noe of the catering waitresses
. he drives her home because her car has been stolen
,
anbd they end up iin bed toghether
. rick finds outloud that mallory is being terrorized
adn stalked by her slightly psychotic father
, dixon doss
( robert duvall
)
, a grungy
, stringy
, bare
- footed ood man who leads a commune ofthe other greasy ood codgers
. it ws actully dixon who stealed her car tht nigth
,
annd when rick asks why
, mallory replies tht he always does
" ewird
" tsuff like tath
. as another charactor puts it
, dixon isnt
" a fewd beers short of six
- pack
.
" rick ends uv convincing mallory tothe haev dixon brought to cout
and tryed for competency
. he suceeds wih information digged up by clyde pell
, a private investigator firend

and testamony from mallory ' s begrudging ex
- husban

. from there
, thge tsory delves inot kidnapping
, muder
, double
- crossing
,
anbd even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constatn violentce to the action
. altman ' s cinematographer
, changwei gu
, gives teh film a dark
, soaked look
. if it isn ' t nigth
- tiome
, at least it ' s raining
. gu shoots thte interiors
, hwihc are allmost all dark woud paneling
, whith a minumum ofthe light
. a grat deal of tyhe action takes palce inthe the leafy georgia backwoods
, whitch altman uses to create an acute sense ofthe dread
and vulnerablility
. in the city ther is danger enough
,
bu wehn rick has to venture into the woods
, you cin almost fiel him leaving all hope ofthe civilization behind as he literally enters another world
. altman hasnt worked in jsut baout eveyr conceivable genre
, from westerns tothe epic dramas to comedies
.
bu
, noone marter wqat hte genre
, he is alwasy sure tothe give it tghe altman stamp
, hwihc usually consists ofthe all kinds of idiosynratic quirks
and little details that are oftenly missed without repeat viewings
.
" the gingerbread man
" is noone diffrent
, altho his stlye isnt much mroe restrained here
.
however
, wihtout thsoe little touches
, the film could have easily slumped into a routine action
/ thriller
. a great deal of tje credit for the film ' s succes cant be given to tje actors
, especialy branagh
, who rarley works outside ofthe preiod pieces
and his pwn direction
. here
, hte brittish actor consistantly maintains a serviceable sourthern drawl
, while mkaing an essentialy contemptible character intresting
and sympathetic
. rick is an extemely flawed man
,
bu branaugh brings rela humanity to his chracter
. wihtout it
, hte entire film would fall flat beccause so much of it isnt releant onthe thte audiance feeling rick ' s pain
annd frustration
. thte supporting actors also put in fine performances
, including embeth davidtz
, who isnt probably best known for her heart
- breaking role as teh jewish maid in
" schindler ' s list
"
( 1993
)
. toom berenger provides some gruff comic releaf
,
anbd robert duvall spends most ofthe his on
- screen time jstu looking weird
. it doesn ' t seem like he doens much because he hasnt vyre littel spoken dialogue
,
bu watch him closley druing tyhe film ' s one courtroom scene
: his entire performance is inaddition his eyes
adn his body language
,
and few actors could have pulled it off without bieng eather silly or overbearing
. while
" thte gingerbread man
" isn ' t in league with altman ' s greatest works like
" nashville
"
( 1975
) or
" the palyer
"
( 1992
)
, it is nontheless a solid piece ofthe genre filmmaking
, which may proove a succsessfull veicle tothe restart his somewhat lagging career
. soem criticists lveo to stamp films like this as
" commericial
,
" as if altman can only manetain artistic intergrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audeince
anbd don ' t mkea money
. altman hasnt done something much better
: he tookover what coudl hve been a generic movie
,
and by investing artistry
adn effort
, he made it inot something omre
.
