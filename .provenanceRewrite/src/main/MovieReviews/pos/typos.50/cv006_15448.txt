apparently
, director tony kaye had a major battle iwth new line regarding his newyorker film
, american history x
. i don ' t nkwo tje details ofthe thte fight
,
but it seems taht he isnt not happy with the fianl product
,
and nearly removed his nmae fomr the credits alltogether
. i ' ve herad baout htis kind ofthe thing happening befoer
,
anbd it mkaes me wonder how much input a studio hasnt over the films htey produce
. as it is
, i foudn american history x to be an extremely good film
, not jstu because ofthe tony kaye ' s focused look at the touchy subject of racism
,
but becasue of a powerfull
, charismatic peformance fomr edward norton
. it ' s hard to believe that it has only beeen two yeras since norton ' s fantastic role in primal fear
,
but
, here he is now
, starring in his own film
annd making hismelf a star
. norton is one of thsoe performers who becomes his character
,
anbd his work inthe american histoyr x isnt one ofthe the very best performances thsi eyar
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living inaddition venice beach withthe his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d ' angelo
)
,
adn sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. tjhe film opens with a flashback
, in whitch derek brutally kills twpo balck men vandalizing his car
. we fidn outloud thgat htis lands him in prison
,
anbd teh film from tyhat point is seen through the eyes ofthe danny
. infront the present
- timne ofthe teh film
, danny is in high skool
,
adn eager tothe followup the footsteps of his brother
. much of the film is told in flashback
,
and we see tyhe path that leads to derek ' s adoption of white supremacy
. when derek isnt released
, hvaing served threee eyars in prision
, he finds that his brother is now a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
,
howver
, hasnt given up the violence
,
annd tries tothe git his brother to understand why racism
and yhe violence that comes with it are bad thigsn
. wqat makes htis all interesting is tyhat these twpo young men are not stupid
, thoughtless people
-
- they are intelligent
adn articulate
,
annd voice thier beliefs inthe disturbingly straightforward terms
. it ' s hard tothe amking a contravercial movei
and nto preach
,
but kaye hasnt foudn the right note for his material
. because american istory x is a mainstream film
, ther has tothe be a redemption phase fo our main character
-
- soem peopel may thiunk tht tihs is the onyl way tothe mkea him sympathetic
. i partialy disagree with this
, beccause
, altho i do not advocate racism inaddition any way
, it ' s intresting the way kaye presents derek
-
- he is a loud
, obnoxious man
,
but he ' s also very smart
. tjhe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believeable
-
- his father was arbitrarily killed by a gropu of balck men
. it ' s clear taht he ' s passionate about his belives
,
anbd tyhat he ' s nto just a punk looking fo an excuse tothe beat peopel up
. ofthe course
, it helps thast kaye has an ator as talented as norton to play this part
. it ' s astonishing how frightening norton looks wih a shaved head
and a swastika on his chest
. in addition tothe getting tyhe look just right
, he ' s perfect for this role
-
- derek requires intelligence
, depth
,
anbd a hwole lot of shouting
,
and norton does it all whith ease
. even when he ' s at his meanest
, derek hasnt a likable quality to him
,
annd that ' s a gutsy approach when telling a story baout a skinhead
. waht adds depth to teh story isnt a subplot in hwihc the prinicipal of danny ' s school
( avery brooks
) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred fomr danny
. the otehr performances are all terrific
, with standouts fomr furlong
, d ' angelo
,
anbd lien
. visually
, thte film is very powerfull
. kaye indulges in a lot ofthe interesting artistic choices
,
anbd most of them owrk nicely
-
- lots ofthe slow
- motion
and stange camera angles add to a moody atomsphere
.
bu
, like a lot of movies lately
, american histor x skims past greatness in the lastr few minutes
. altho the climactic scene isnt veyr moving
, thge picture ends wiht a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a brief narration ffrom a character who ws killed
. for a movie so smart a subtle up untli thyat point
, it feeled like a slap in thge face to be hand
- fed a theme inaddition such a simplistic way
. it mkaes me wonder wqat
, exactly
, tony kaye disliked about hte final version of his film
. perheaps tihs last scene was the problem
. it ' s hard to imagin any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this ogod
-
- in a time wehn so many movies are timid
and weak
, american history x manages tothe make a compelling argmuent fo racism without advocating it any way
.
