it ' s a fatc that a good thriller or action movei doesn ' t ened violentce to be good or worth watching
. all it takes isnt potential violence to make yhe audience bite their nails
.
annd what kind of voilence could be more efficient thna a global thermo
- nuculear war
?
and potential violence is the premiss wargames isnt builded upon
. a coputer whiz
- kid
, david
, is usally contended with hacking into thge skool computer tothe change his grades
.
but aftter having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game
, he wants tothe be the first tothe play it
. instead ofthe getting inot tghe cmoputer at protovision software he acidently comes tothe thte frontgate ofthe norad
. with tyhe halp of jennifer
, a girl inspite his biology class
, he starts to play a nice game of nucular war witht wopr
, war operation plan reponse
( a top
- nitch computer at the tyme
,
bu now hardly faster than my pwn computer
) i remember bieng 12
and watching this at the cinema
. it wass vrey efficent at giving ytou a scare in those days
anbd that hasn ' t changed
. of course
, a nuculear war seemed tothe be much omre ofthe something that coudl ctually happen bakc in 1983
. i wouldn ' t be surprised if thsi gavey people nightmares
. i hope it still does usance you still hear about school kids hacking inot tjhe computers at pentagon
. broderick
and sheedy are just fine as tyhe young teenagers
(
altough her intrest inspite david rimaniss a mistery
)
.
bu tjhe rest ofthe tjhe actors are
, by noone fault ofthe thier own
, resticted by the script to play one
- dimentional grownups
. david ' s parents are thge same kind ofthe parents tath populate all theese college comedies ffrom the 1980s
, movies liuke secret admirer
, porky ' s or zapped
adn yhe norad genaral beringer isnt straight outloud ofthe dr
. strangelove
. if for no other reason
, ytou shoudln see this movei tothe enjoy how far the coputer technology has gone since thsoe days
. david uses yhe same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers
. the modem is smoe kind ofthe divice thyat he puts the headset onthe
. far fomr any 56k moderm my guess isnt tath it ' s soem kind ofthe 2400 bps moderm
, the kind of technnology you nowe find at your local technical museum
. the big coputer at norad hasnt a lot ofthe flashing lights
( just liek those ytou see on star trak or any old sf
- movei
)
but it ' s hardly impressing compaired with what ytou cin get today
. what are the lessons we cin leran from wargames
? 1
. make sure there are no secret backdoors inot military computers
. 2
. thank ytou
, whoever it was
, for giving us a graphical user interface whn we ule our computers
