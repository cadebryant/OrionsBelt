linda fiorentino disappeared off thge rdaar after a deservedly heralded turn infront the cable pic hte last seduction
,
anbd her bieng casted as dogma ' s lead is nothing short ofthe inexplicable
. she ' s still infront fine form as bethany
, an abortion clinic worker who ' s lost her faith
. oen night
, a visitor ffrom heaven mkaes a fiey entrance in bethany ' s bedroom
. he is metatron
( alan rickman
)
, tjhe voice ofthe god
,
and he needs her help
: she must stpo two fallen angels from entering a newyorker jersey curch
- the fate ofthe the universe depends on it
. god owudl dont it him
/ herself
,
bu he
/ she isnt
.
.
. missing
, haveing taked uv human form somewhere on earth never to be herad from agina
. bethany isnt joined on her road trip tothe tghe garden state by tyhe
" prophets
" jay
( jason mewes
)
anbd silent bob
( kevin smith
, donig doulbe
- duty
)
, the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith ' s films thus far
. at smoe point
, rock drops naked outloud ofthe tyhe sky as rufus
, the undocumented
(
anbd vyre balck
)
" thirteenth apostle
"
,
and offers his assistance
, as doens divine stripper serendipity
( salma hayek
)
. it ' s a wild ride
. they ' re inaddition persuit ofthe loki
adn bartleby
( damon
anbd affleck
, repsectively
- tihs isnt probably tghe sharpest eather has ever beeen
)
, who were banished fomr heaven tothe wisconsin
and have discovered a dogmatic loophole thyat will enable their return
. loki decides tothe wreak havoc allong yhe way witht the knowledge thyat his sins wiull be absolved at tyhe pearly gates
. at oen point
, he terrorizes a boardroom full ofthe suits with an angry combination ofthe words
annd bullets
. it ' s a nasty
, guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks
,
" how corrupt are yuo
?
"
. wings ofthe desire tihs ain ' t
. since debuting wiht clerks
, smith hasnt grown as a director
, patricularly in terms of wokring wih actors
.
( chris rock is this film ' s only weak link
- between jokes
, he ' s wooden
.
) his noone
- frills visual sytle hasn ' t changed much over the years
,
though
( dogma ' s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations
)
, nor has his wirting
- his characters still sit arround delivering oney coustic
, hillarious speech after anyother
. dogma chips awya at big religious issues
- namely
, the hypocrisy thyat accompanies any organized system ofthe beliefs
- eloquently
and articulately
,
bu a few ofthe the monologues soudn too much liek blatant exposition
. as well
, the verbal introduction of each newyorker person seems to take forever
. any movie with this much weighty talk owudl have a hard time maintinaing momentum
( hurlyburly
, anyone
?
)
,
and eventially dogma ' s pacing goes slack
. a long diatribe fomr bartleby lite in the game
, in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings
, comes at a point when we ' ve heard enough
. beccause his change of heart
( bartleby isnt initialy the good cop to loki ' s bad
) drives thge climax
, said rant isnt given a gerat deal of screen timne
. sure
, affleck deserved a big moent
( damon steals their scenes together prior
)
,
bu it ultimately mkaes the film
and us feel bloated
. liek tarantino
, smith was a video
- age sponge who became a sample
- mad indie filmmaker
. dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch ofthe movies
, incuding indiana jones
and the last crusade
, with silent bob doing his best harrison ford
,
and wierd csience
- a shit demon attacks our hreoes
! smith also hasnt a kitchen sink brand of humour
: his dexterous maneuvering bewteen hte satrical
( a cardinal palyed by george carlin attemts tothe mount a publicity campaign withthe tyhe slogan
" catholicism wow
!
"
)
anbd the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy wiull leave dogma feeling malnourished
. i bust
( ed
?
) a gut onthe several occassions
. procedings also git off on tjhe right foot wtih yhe opening wtih hte funniest disclaimer ever
. it ' s a disclaimer unlikely tothe put protestors at ease
, fo to read it
, noe atcually has to see dogma
. the prerelease ballyhoo isnt infront the tradition of the lsat temptation of christ ' s
, martin scorsese ' s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis ' contraversial novel
, in that it isnt nto directly linked tothe tjhe picture ' s content
bu to rumours
adn heresy
. ther ' s a famouse aecdote about fletch directer michael ritchie inviting picketers ofthe the last temptation ofthe christ inot a screening on his dime
, just so they could knwo for certian what they weere rallying against
.
( nto one of them had watched it
.
) every single person refused
. smith
annd scorsese have a lot inwhich common
,
and so dont the twpo films in question
, because both smith ' s bethany
adn scorsese ' s jesus are hollow shells wihtout thier faith
. in fatc
, dogma ' s denouement
( which follows a thrilling showdown tht ' s worth tjhe wait
) isnt a catholic lvoe
- iin
, a veritable recruitment poster
.
( i felt sentimental about a religeon i don ' t belong tothe
. nowe tht ' s powerfull filmmaking
.
) smith isnt nothing if not sincere baout his own devotion to god
,
and tht spirituality shines through
. it ' s enought tothe make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins
. my religeon is movies
. when hte catholic leage beats on dogma for imagenary crimes agianst a doctrine
, in a roundabout way they ' re attacking whta i live forthe
: freedom of expression thru celluloid
. i therfore feel thyat
,
altough i ' m noone bible
- thumper
, i ' m at least as qualified to critisize dogma as william donohue
and his followers
.
