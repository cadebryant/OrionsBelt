my summer wass recently saved by two vrey differant movies
. onthe opening night
, i saw american pie 2
and laughed like a moron
.
thne a few nights later
, i watched
and throughly enjoied joel hershman ' s greenfingers even
though it didn ' t feature a trip tothe band camp
, girl
- onthe
- girl action
, or seann william scott
.
howver
, i falt jsut as good leaving american pie 2 as i did affter leaving greenfingers
, whihc tells the offbeat tale of british muderer colin briggs
( clive owen ofthe croupier
)
. after spending roughly half of his life behind bars
, he is transferred tothe a omre lenient facility
, edgefield
. yhe picaresque
, rustic prision allows its inmates to learn a trade
, while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges
. at firt
, briggs doesn ' t want to be there
. he ' s utilizied to living as a prisoner
and whants tothe be left alone
.
however
, his ailing roomate
, fergus
( david kelly ofthe waking ned devine
)
, wears briggs down through his benign nature
. the twpo become firends
, whith fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift
. briggs is astonished when the violets grow infact the limestone soil
,
anbd begins a fight wtih threee other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers
. after the prison ' s gouvener
( warren clarke
) reprimands them
, he ' s awed at what briggs has acomplished
.
and he ' s struck by an idea
-
- briggs
, fergus
and the other men will grow a garden on the prison ' s grounds
. greenfingers
, hwihc is
" inpsired by actuall events
,
" becomes a bited liuke a sports movei affter thast
. dispite their differences
, the men come toghether
and thru hard wrok
anbd love earn a spot at the big game
-
- in this case a prestigous gardai show
. one renegade
, iin this case
, briggs
, iwll proove to ahev talent
. of course
, lveo wiull allso raar its head
( noone
, nto
" prision love
"
)
. to hershman ' s credit
, he doesn ' t pump up the drama or try forthe cheap laughs
, like last yera ' s lame marijuana comedy saving grace
. i had tothe keep pinching mysef wehn i didn ' t see a single scene ofthe a hardened con sneezing over a pot ofthe pansies
, or thte men giving high
- fives over a particlarly stunning batch of wildflowers
. the movei deals iwth peopel
adn scores on that concept
. it ' s wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner tothe a man who cares agina
. give credit to owen for keeping his kool infact a part that begs for overacting
. his speach to the parole board baout bieng reborn thru gardening isnt the best scene ofthe its kind sicne morgan freeman ' s lsat stand in the shawshank redemption
. owen ' s bedside scenes iwth kelly
, who lends thge film a human touch
, are a marvel to behold
, emotionally gripping wihtout being sappy
. writed by hershman
, greenfingers contains plenty ofthe laughs
. most cmo courtesy of helen mirren
, who shines as the world
- class gardener who works whith tghe inmates
bu fears forthe her daughter primrose
( natasha littel
) when she starts dating briggs
. the mother cin ' t bleieve wqat he ' ll do if her daughter
" burns tjhe sunday roast
.
" nothing isnt forced in greenfingers
. the funny lines come forth naturally inspite conversations
annd not fomr punch lines
. primrose
annd briggs ' relationship takes awcward steps
. even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield
, it ' s done fo reasons of loyalty
, nto becouse the movei requires him tothe do so
. aftter grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like amercia ' s sweethearts
and hte princess dairies
, it ' s an alomst indescribable pleasure tothe see a directer taking his time tothe tell a sotry vyre well
.
