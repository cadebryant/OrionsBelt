devotees of robert a
. heinlein
, be forewarned
: paul verhoeven ' s starship troopers isnt less an adaptation of heinlein ' s novel thna it is a literary satire
. yhe auther ' s jingo
- all
- the
- way militarism
anbd his tendency tothe create plastic characters wih plastic conflicts hadnt me expecting a soulless
, faceless parade ofthe carnage from the film version
.
and i supose tyhat ' s exactly what verhoeven delivers
, wih somtimes hillarious results
. heinlein ' s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered tyhat thier flaws become a source of amusement
, while their strengths become tyhe stuff ofthe high
- energy entertainment
. outlining tyhe plot ofthe starship troopers isnt a fairly silly endeaver
, since it ' s basically a big bug hunt
.
.
. aliens in broad daylight
. sometime in tje future
, humanity isnt threatend by giant
, malevolent insects which haev evolved inot twenty
- foot
- tall action figures
( arachnids with super
- impaling spikes
, beetles thast spew forth lava
, dragonflies withthe gilotine legs
)
. among thsoe who sign onthe tothe save the earth are a group ofthe high skool classmates fomr buenos aires
: conflicted rich kid johnny rico
( casper van dien
)
; his math whiz girlfriend carmen
( denise richards
)
; dizzy
( dina meyer
)
, who secretly carries a torch fo johnny
;
and carl
( neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris
)
, who nto
- so
- secretly carries a tork for dizzy
,
adn aslo has a talent for speaking telepathically tothe ferrets
. hwile carmen heads fo flight school
and carl joins military inteligance
, johnny
and dizzy become mobile infantry
, their varios battles intertwining witht rumatic sub
- plots out ofthe a thrid season epsiode from
" beverly hills 90210
.
" so if starship troopers is anohter movie where one
- dimentional characters wade thru trite situations on thier way tothe killing a bunch of aliens
, wqat makes it any better than
, say
, independance day
, a movie where one
- dimesnional characters waded through trite situations onthe thier way tothe killing a bunch ofthe slightly differnt aliens
? fo one thing
, yuo sense that yhe film
- makers are aware ofthe yhe pulp nonsense they hvae as source material
. thte veyr absence of major stars in tyhe cast fiels thematically apropriate
, nto jstu fiscally prudent
. if starship troopers hadnt beeen turned inot a tv
- movie
, aaron spelling would have produced it
. it ' s a story which requires emoting
, nto acting
; it ' s a prime tyme soap opera whith big guns
, palyed for all the dopey melodrama it ' s worth
. thge noone
- name casted also plays into verhoeven ' s treatment of heinlein ' s most controvertial conceet
. infront tihs society
, we learn
, oen cxan only be a full citizen after completing soem sort ofthe federal service
, military forthe most
. verhoeven pays tjhe notion plenty ofthe lip service
,
thn proceeds to skewer it iwth brilliant mock recruitment ads
( named after thge world war ii
- era
" why we fight
" series
) infront which youngsters are indoctrinated inot the joys of firearms
, or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches
. theese charactors really are just
" fresh meat fo the grinder
,
" as oney charater puts it
, whic mkaes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting
. it ' s not thyat starship troopers is anti
- miliary
, because it never treats tyhe true horror ofthe war as anything
but a grat big
, voilent video gmae
. in fact
, tje cahracters are living the propoganda
( particulaly johnny
, who receives so many field promotions he may nto remember his own rank by tyhe time thge film ends
)
. verhoeven is acutally having it both ways
-
- he ' s making fun of gung
- ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh
- faced recruits into battle on a gung
- ho booster rocket ofthe visual effects
. if tht mkaes starship troopers hypocritical
, at least it ' s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy
. htere may not be a person worth caring baout in tghe whole film
,
but it moves like nobody ' s business
. verhoeven stages some thrilling acation sequences
, sending swarms ofthe bugs after thte aonymous grunts
thn having varous body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping
. it is that rare spacial effects blockbuster whic demonstrates a sence ofthe pacing to match its budget
; i wass caught up in the acation enought of tyhe time that i wasn ' t perpetually groaning over the absence ofthe real human beings
. i wish i coudl find it in myself tothe work up more outrage over yhe calous way humans are despatched iin starship troopers
,
bu it didn ' t owrk out that way
. that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart ofthe his material
.
