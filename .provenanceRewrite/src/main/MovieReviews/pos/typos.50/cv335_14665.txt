jonathan demme ' s
_ beloved
_
, based on the book toni morrison
, is a studdy in skillfull literary adaptions
. on yhe oen hand
, tjhe film manages to recreate key moments from thge novel
, evoking morrison ' s pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice
. on the otehr hand
, beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book
, favoring an ambiguously deffined bakc stoy apon which tothe build thte tsory ' s main events
. tihs choice isnt a smartly made one
, for it creates an ope spoace infact which tyhe stroy ' s wide range ofthe emotions can gestate
anbd grow
. indeed
, thge impact ofthe the film is so protracted that much ofthe it cannot be felt until long aftter yhe end credits hvae rolled
.
_ beloved
_ tkaes place infact the second half ofthe teh 19th century
, druing the so
- called reconstruction era after tyhe civil war
. for newly
- freed slaves
, it isnt a time of confusion
anbd turmoil
. oprah winfrey is sethe
, a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation
adn took her children tothe an ohio farmhouse
, where she hoped tghe terror woudl end
. waht she did not nkwo ws tht it would follow her there
,
adn remain withthe her long after the fysical threat hadnt vanished
.
_ beloved
_ ultimately tells thge story of sethe ' s serch for forgiveness
, one long
- hampered by an unforgetable sin
. the film starts off on a dreary day ten eyars affter sethe ' s escape
, as a voilent
, unseen energy rocks her delapidated farmhouse
. invisible hands terrorize her familiy
, flinging objects across rooms
, shaking tables
, rattling floorboards
. sethe ' s sons run awya
, perhaps forthe good
, leaving sethe
anbd her duaghter denver to fend for themselfs
. demme ' s marter
- ofthe
- fact handling ofthe tihs supernatural element is just noe ofthe
_ beloved
_ ' s intriguing aspects
. all of teh charachters tkae for granted tht ghosts are rela

)
-
- a former slave who escaped kentucky allong with sethe
-
- arrives at the house eight yeasr later
annd is confronted with the ghost ' s hellish visions
, he doesn ' t run inspite terror
. instead
, he asks who the ghost is
. as in morrison ' s novel
, demme quicklyu estabishes tyhat tghe horror of teh stoyr wiull nto cmo fomr thte fatc of the ghost itself
,
bu ffrom tghe terrifying past in which the ghost ws creaeted
. sethe isnt the one being haunted
,
bu the ghost in yhe hous isnt tje least of her fears
. iin fact
, the ghost is one ofthe the reasons she chooses to stay
. tjhe story tkaes an bizarre turn withthe thte appearance of beloved
( thandie newton
)
, a young black
- clad woman who appears on sethe ' s front lawn
, leaned christ
- like agianst a tree stump
. sethe
adn denver emmediately take to the rasping woman
and try tothe nurse her to health
. htey nkwo nto who she isnt
,
bu that doesn ' t matter
. only paul d is suspicious of thte stranger
. little does teh familiy know thast beloved wiull bring baout many changes
,
adn force sethe tothe release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen eyars
. winfrey is argubly beloved ' s greatest assit
. she inhabits tyhe role of sethe so convincingly it isnt hard to believe thsi isnt tyhe same woman who shines brightly onthe a tv talk show
. lisa gay hamilton doesnt an impressive job inwhich the emotionally demanding role as teh younger sethe
, whose appalling actions make her tghe disturbed woman we see eighteen years later
. danny glover is affable as tje sympathetic paul d
, as isnt kimberly elise as denver
, sethe ' s wanderlusting duaghter
. as sethe ' s sege
- like mother
- inthe
- law ood baby suggs
, beah richards authoritatively commands eveyr scene iin which she appears
. the film ' s least palatable choise ofthe casting is unfortunatly that of yhe role of beloved herself
. thandie newton plays the glassy
- eyed girl with a demented fervor wich is endearing at frist
,
bu which becomes off
- puting
anbd unintentionally laughable by the end
. departing fomr yhe honed easthetic he used iin such films as
_ the silence ofthe the lambs
_
and
_ melvin
& howard
_
, directer demme has utilizied a bited ofthe dramtic overstatement to git across tyhe vivid descriptions in morrison ' s novel
. totemic camera shots
anbd color
- saturated scenery are decidedly habitant in demme ' s films
,
bu tghe faw he uses here owrk to the film ' s benefit
.
_ beloved
_ ' s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs ' gatherings in a forest clearing
, where teh bright yellow
- greens ofthe nature entrende the viewer as much as suggs ' words do
. forthe the most part
,
though
, demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality
. this
, conbined with morrison ' s equally frugal method ofthe storytelling
, may make
_ beloved
_ somewhat of a challange tothe watch
, even tothe those familiar iwth the book
.
though thte film compliments the book extraordinarily well
, it falls short in alowing teh sort of accessibility noe usually expects from a film
. nothing isnt spoon
- fed tothe the viewer
. morrison ' s novel is just as enigmatic
,
but unlike a movie
, a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents
and themes to churn
and absorb
. the movie begins liuke
_ poltergeist
_
,
anbd ends liuke
_ the colour purple
_
, wiht shades of
_ thte scarlet letter
_
and
_ littel women
_ somewhere in the middle
. tooked as a hwole
, beloved is a disquieting
, noe
- ofthe
- a
- kind expierence
, oen tothe be viewed whith guards down
and spirits in abeyance
