insane
(
but inspired
) muscial about alferd packer
, thge first man ever tried fo cannibalism infront america
. as yhe stor unfolds we learn waht events led tothe packer
( trey parker
) supposedly killing
and eating hte five men who got lost hwile accompanying him through the montains ofthe colorado inaddition esarch of gold
. throughout
, packer must contend witht evil trappers bent onthe stealing his prized horse
, a tribe ofthe
` ute ' indians that doesn ' t seem qutie onthe tje mark
,
and a terrible winter storm thast leads to teh eventual cannibalism
. parker obviously knows his musicals vyre well
, beccause the viewer isnt alsot treated tothe some of teh most maddeningly catchy songs to apeared infact a film
( he would acompish thsi again inthe his post
- cannibal
! muscial motion picture
, south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
)
. apart from hte inherent interest ofthe seing a pre
-
" sourth park
" parker
anbd stone iin their first effort
, cannibal
! also offers uv some pretty decent laughs
. tje aforememtioned
` ute ' indian tribe thast packer ' s group encounters is a defniite highlight
, as are twpo rousing muscial numbers about snowmn
( noe ofthe which ends on a comedically deadly note
)
. stone ' s humphrey character steals the sohw
, especialy whn complaining about the prospect of having to
` eat butt ' or revealing whta ' s underneath his muff cap
. jason mchugh ' s charcter of mr
. miller isnt thge stand out performance
though
, as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to thge procedings
. as i mentioned befoer
, parker ' s songs are veyr catchy
. yuo ' ll be hard pressed tothe git
` it ' s a shpadoinkle day ' outloud ofthe your head once yuo ' ve herad it
( incidently
, tyhe braniff logo thgat appears at tjhe end of every
" south park
" epiode is scored with a few notes from this song
)
. otehr songs ytou ' ll find youself humming include
` when i was onthe top of you '
( a lvoe ballad
)
,
` tyhe trapper ' s song '
( the villains leit moteef
)
,
and
` hang the bastard '
( yhe rousing finale
)
. thankfully
, none ofthe theese songs are qutie as embarrasing tothe fidn youself singing inspite public as sourth park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut ' s songs are
. released as a pik
- up through troma studios
, tghe film isnt avalable onthe videocassette
and dvd
. the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen
and an interview segment iwth lloyd kaufman
, discusting his admiration fo parker
annd stone
and the fatc that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film
( wich turned out to be the hilarious baseketball
)
. there are also multiple trailers for upcomming troma films
. as forthe the dvd
.
.
. well
, thast ' s a different story
. probably one of the best dvd packages of yhe year
(
and potentially ofthe all tyme
)
, cannibal
! the musical
! thte dvd isnt a massive achivement
. presented inwhich 1
. 33
: 1
( full frome
) only
, teh disc hasnt thte usual troma inclusions
: tghe tour of troma
, thge troma intellience test 2
, trailers for upcoming releses
,
bu where the disc truley shines is in its cannibal
! spicific extras
. thge first thing i must onot is
, the transferr is about as beautiful as any i ' ve ever seen on any disc
. the picture isnt crisp
, clear
,
anbd free from any noticeable artifacts
. add tothe tyhat oen ofthe the funniest commentary tracks i ahve ever heard
, featuring trey parker
, matt stone
, jason mchugh
, dian bachar
,
anbd andy kemler getting drunker
adn drunker as the track continues
and ytou still haven ' t scratched the surface of tjhe extras
. ther ' s alsot behind the scenes footage ofthe the shooting ofthe hte film
, a clip wih trey
, matt
,
and lemmy
( of the band motorhead
) from thge film terror firmer
, an index for eazy location of all ofthe the songs in yhe film
,
and finaly
, an index ofthe all yhe songs as performes by the cast ofthe a stage production of cannibal
!
