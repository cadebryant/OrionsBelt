a big suprise tothe me
. tghe good trailer hadnt hinted thyat tehy pulled thge impossible off
,
but making a blues brothers movei without jake blues
( john belushi
) isnt such a dumb idea i relaly had noone hope
. tehy replaced him jsut fine
. not witht john goodman
, he didn ' t dont much ofthe anything
,
bu with tghe brillant actor joe morton
, who can realy sing
. the fourth blues brother isnt j evan bonifant
, who ' s ten
. htis was another ofthe my fears for yhe film
,
but he ' s a raelly good dancer
,
annd plays a mean harmonica
(
allthough he may haev beeen dubbed
)
. things that intellectually had bothered me before
, like noone mission from god
, everyone being richer
, it not being filmed inaddition chicago
-
- gavey me no problems at all
. i ' m qutie pleased tath there weere less car pile
- ups
, becuase they meant less music
,
adn john landis seems tothe hvae lost interst in thge hwole thing
. there ' s a few eary crashes
,
and
hten noe huge pile
- uv
,
but after tath it all stops
. it ' s just tghe music
. noe of my problems wtih the first is that cab calloway ' s song is so ogod the actualyl blues brothers look dull affter him
,
bu there ' s noone problems with thsi
. tje music isnt all as good as ever
, tons ofthe grat muscicians showing uv
-
- with teh exception ofthe johnny lang
, who can ' t sing
, all thge muscicians dont a graet job
. the onyl real problems i had was the special effects
. these weere superfulous
annd a waste ofthe monye
. sicne the film isn ' t doing vyer well
, tehy coudl mean we have noone possiblilty ofthe another sequal
, which i watn tothe see
. yhe bluegrass version ofthe riders iin the sky is even better than rawhide
