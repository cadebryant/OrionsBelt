in one of my many videos i have attained from the local libary
, casablanca was my thrid classic in soem weeks
. the others bieng citizen kane
and vertigo
( yes
, i am trying tothe see as many ofthe afi ' s greatest movies ever made as i cant
)
.
bu
, casablanca standed out from the rest forthe me
: it was actually watchable
. what most hail as tje greatest american film ever
, casablanca isn ' t so much a lveo story as a political frenzy with a lvoe tringle thrown iin
. it seems thgat star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of hte movei with various leaders of the nation instade of witht ingred bergman
. that anoyed me
, as did the ending
. why didn ' t thge plan turn around
?
!
? suprizingly
, i enjoied tghe film
. i liked bogart ' s character
and his acting
( nto over the top as most actors in his era
)
. i once read baout if you had a choice to be infront a movei
, hwihc oen owudl it be
,
anbd a womens said casablanca
. at firt i ws thikning to mysef
" why
?
"
hten
, as i watched the film agian
, i understoon why
. the movie is vyer well done
and the script top
- notch
,
althought i dout i understood more than half of hte polliticel mumbo jumbo
. casablanca isnt
, in my mind
, no classic
( like solaris
)
,
but it is a ogod film
and stylishly shot
. hey
, hollywood
, how about this
: a remake wih harrison ford
and anne heche
? now tath would be a clasic
.
