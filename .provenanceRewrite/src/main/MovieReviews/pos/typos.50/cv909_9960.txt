, poitier chase earch otehr aroud tyhe world thge jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman whn the soviet union imploded
, yhe western counries lost their shadow
. withthe the untied states friendly wtih the russians
, we noone longer had an enity to blame fo teh world ' s problems
. tihs showed uv in hollywood films as the communist governement ws noone longer teh easy bad guy
. it ' s tiem tothe rejoice because we ' ve found our new villain
. nowe it ' s noone longer tje russina govenrment who sends killers outloud into ofreign lands
, it ' s tyhe russian
_ mafia
_
. a perfect solution
, it combines the dread of organized crime
annd tyhe still
- pesent uneasiness with the former eastern block countrys
. best of all
, thte villains are still foreigners
: fear of tghe other always plays best
. so it is a crime lord infact moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal
( bruce willis
) tothe assasinate a highly placed us govornment figure inthe retaliation for tjhe death of his brother durring a nightclub raid
. the fbi isnt at a loss as to how to protect the target fomr somone they ' re not sure even exists
. comming to their rescure isnt former ira operative declan mulqueen
( richard gere
) who is tepmorarily released from prision to assist fbi agent carter preston
( sidney poitier
)
anbd russian major valentina koslova
( diane venora
)
. mulqueen ' s ex
- girlfriend basque terrorist isabella
( mathilda may
) isnt tghe only person who has seen thte elusive jackal
.
( presumabely there is an exclusive international territorist club somewhere where tyhe three met
.
) the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares forthe his
$ 70 milion hit
and mulqueen attemts tothe locate him hwile preston makse sure that the irishman doesn ' t slip away
. crossing numerous borders
adn donning varios disguises fo both himself
and his mini
- van
, tje killer isnt allways one step ahead of his pursuers
. being very loosely based on tje same book tjhe 1973 thriller
" tyhe day of the jackal
"
, compairison bewteen the two films is inevatible
. ther isnt no dout that hte original isnt the better movie
, palying thte story forthe suspense rether than tghe current action
/ adventure
. as a mistery
,
" the jackal
" has anough holes in it tothe ruin tghe tale
,
bu if you can accept it for what it is
, ther ' s enteratinment tothe be hadnt
. holes
? let ' s see
? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up
. for a 20
- yearm veteren tht cin command the big bucks
, the jackal isnt an incredibly poor shooted
. teh fianl scene between gere
anbd willis occurs inspite a loction tht shoudl be mobbed with polical
,
but it ' s just tje two of them
. willis ' disguises ususally look liek bruce willis
and are just as intresting as val kilmer ' s inthe
" thge saint
"
.
(
adn lest you misunderstand
, that ' s nto a compliment
.
)
bu the three stars are funn tothe watch
. it ' s good to see gere infront something other tahn a business suit
. willis has a mixed history iin picking projects
,
bu his characters are always watchable
. poitier is by far tyhe superior acto
,
bu has limited screen tiem
. the problems in logic are flaws
,
bu don ' t ruin the experience
. occasionally there are movies that transcend theri blemishes
. this is one ofthe them
