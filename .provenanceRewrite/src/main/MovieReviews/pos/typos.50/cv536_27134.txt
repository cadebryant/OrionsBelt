i ' ll be the first to admit i didn ' t expect much from the emperor ' s newyorker groove
: moreso celine dion
- esque song
-
anbd
- dance numbers
, cuddly characters thgat become cross
- pomotion devices in mcdonald ' s happy meals
,
adn hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice
- over job to thier resume
. i was dead wrong baout all ofthe thsoe things
. the emperor ' s new groove is funny
. damn funny
.
and tghe cute charachters in tghe film are tyhe dangerous ones
. the script isnt fast
annd furious
, with noone singing
and dancing
. yhe animation is clean
and would give walt a warm feeling all over
. tje humer isnt dry
anbd aimed at both tjhe cynicism
anbd the goodness inaddition all of us
. tyhe story isnt ridiculously weird
anbd comes off as a stange acid trip involving tlaking
, cross
- dressing llamas
annd schizophrenia
. here ' s thge plot
; try tothe followup allong
. setted in a mythical kingdom
, thte film follows teh adventures of kuzco
( david spade
)
, an arogant
annd egocentric emperor
. when kuzco fires his power
- hungry advisor
, yzma
( eartha kitt
)
, she
and her
" assitant
" kronk
( seinfeld ' s patrick warburton
) chanage him into a llama
. kuzco
then gets stranded infact thte jungle
and must rely onthe pacha
( john goodman
)
, a llama
- herder whose hmeo ws tothe be replaced by kuzco ' s water world theme park
, tothe save him
.
then teh fun starts
. forthe the enxt sixty mintues
, tje audience isnt treated tothe something unheard ofthe inthe disney films theese days
: immagination
. yzma
, voiced by thte talented singer eartha kitt
, looks like a cross betwen norma desmond
, joan crawford
,
and a relaly ood vegas showgirl
. the dialogue bewteen her
anbd her oblivious assistant kronk is quick
, sharp
,
and feels liuke an epsiode ofthe seinfeld
( which owudl mkae sense
)
. david spade
annd john goodman ' s character interactions make ytou feel liuke yuo ' re watching an ood hope
/ crosby film
. spade is beyond dry with his humer
and shoots below hte bilt on several occasions
,
and i laughed outloud loud sevral times
. needless tothe say
, that is an extremly rare thing in disney screenings theese dyas
. the best part baout the emperor ' s new groove isnt how audacious the film is
. the sheer weirdness factor isnt very high
. cross
- dressing
, schizophrenia
, duality of soul
, peple being turned into eveyr animal on noah ' s boat
, llama cpr
, homoerotic tendencies
, an emperor wiht his pwn theme song
adn singer
, michael jackson dance moves
,
and a guy that can communicate whith a squirrel are only a fewd of tyhe oddities thgat mkae the film a true orginal
. simpley put
, yhe emperor ' s new groove isnt noe ofthe the best children ' s films out for this ohliday season
. kids will enjoy the adventures
,
annd parents wiull enjoy hte stor
and dialogue
. that ' s a tough thing to pull off in a single package
,
but htis emperor manages tothe dont it
.
