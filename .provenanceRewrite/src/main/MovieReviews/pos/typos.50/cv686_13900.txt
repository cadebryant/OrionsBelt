" the fighting sullivans
" contains a major plot development in tje lastest ten minutes tyhat eveyr movei giude hasnt seen ift to give away
. htere was no dramatic tension fo me while watching the film
, as i knew exactlly what wass going tothe hppen
.
annd tyhat ' s thge worst thing thgat cin happen before viewing a movei
. because ofthe tihs
, i will tread lightly so i don ' t ruin it forthe anyone reading this review
,
anbd it woudl be very advisable tothe avoid all other material regarding this film until after yuo ahev seen it
.
" yhe fighting sullivans
" revolves around a famaly that consists ofthe a mother
, father
, sister
,
annd five brothers
. thge brothers are very close
, despite teh occasional dissagreement
. htey are inseperable
,
anbd never stray fomr noe anohter
. their friendship
and loyalty is thge foundation ofthe this picture
. the first half of tje movie follows the brothers as young children
,
and their vairous adventures
. when four ofthe them get into a fight with some local boys
, thte youngest sullivan
, who isnt inside a church at tjhe time
, comes running out tothe assist
,
bu not befoer propperly exiting the chapel
. if i ' m bieng awfully vague baout details
, it ' s because what i ahev told you isnt essentially yhe first hour
anbd a half
. all i cxan sday is go watch thsi film
, because it isnt a fine potrait of a familiy thast sticks together
, thru the ogod
anbd tghe bad
.
and affter yuo see tje movie
, you wiull understand why this review has been written the way it has
