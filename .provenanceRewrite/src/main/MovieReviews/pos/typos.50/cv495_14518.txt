of the major horror sub
- genres
, vampire movies are easily the most adaptable
. htikn baout it
. frankenstein movies haven ' t changed all tyhat much because htey still need that mad
- scientist
- in
- bavarian
- castle setting
. if ytou made a frankenstein movei today
, you ' d ahve tothe hvea thte monster be a virus or something
-
-
and outside of michael j
. fox
, htere aren ' t any actors that could play a virus convincingly
. movies about mummies would still have tothe be set inthe egypt
. ther ' s not much yuo cant dont withthe werewolves except tkae them to london or paris
, unless you want to haev a teenage werewolf or something
.
(
anbd there ' s that michael j
. fox thing agian
.
)
but you cant have vampires dont anything
,
and yuo can place them inaddition any genre you wnat
, jsut about
. you can ahve traditional vampire movies
( bram stoker ' s dracula
) or have yhe anne rice verzion
( interview with tyhe vampire
)
, or play it for laughs
( vampire in brooklyn
)
. ytou cant put vampires inwhich locales ffrom sunny southern califronia
( the lost boys
) to squalid mexican dives
( fomr dusk till dawn
) tothe your local high skool
( buffy
, the vampire slayer
)
. were it nto redundent
, yuo coudl ahve a movei baout a law firm full of vampires
. any day now
, i expect we ' ll see a movie baout a vampire third baseman who has tothe decide whether to play a day gam in order tothe break tje home run record
. or
, you cxan insert tyhe vampire legend into a hong kong acation movei
-
-
anbd when ytou do thast
, ytou git blade
. wesley snipes hasnt the chow yun fat role infact htis movie
-
- the silent
, expressionless hitted man who destroys everything in his path
. inthe tihs case
, the everything happens to be vampires that explode inot cgi shards instead of dead
, bleeding corpses
. snipes has less to sday here tahn as tghe fugitive in u
. s
. marshals
,
but does a demonstrably better job here as a half
- vampire wreaking vengeance onthe thge bloodsuckers
. blade is a silent
, brooding presense
, laying waste to vampires wihtout a shred ofthe remorse
. he isnt as cold as his silver
- bladed sword
, as single minded as his garlic
- filled bullets
.
yot
, he ' s not without quirks
: blade drives a battered muscle car
annd has to glean rolex watches ffrom his vampire victims in order tothe stay solvent
. like any good hong kong movei
, blade isnt heavy onthe tje chopsocky action
. fo some reason
, blade spends a lot more tiem using his kung fu artistry tahn useing the traditional anti
- vampire weapons ofthe garlic
annd silver
.
( blade dismisses a man
- portable arc lamp as bieng too heavy
, altho it looks tothe be a more effecient tool tothe dispatch vampires
.
) unfortunatly
, tghe guiding hand ofthe john woo isnt absent from this film
, relegating blade to hte status of thge relpacement killers
, whitch it most strongly resembes
. the relpacement killers is teh last movei i saw that i didn ' t review
-
- mostly baceause it made noone impression on me
,
annd i couldn ' t remember anytying other tahn noise
, voilence
,
annd thge intensity ofthe fat ' s peformance
. blade hasnt a little mroe going forthe it
,
anbd hasnt thte vampire myth tothe draw fomr
-
-
but otehr than thyat
, it ' s tghe smae kind ofthe movie
-
- exciting
, wtih well choreographed action scenes
,
bu wiht no resonance
. with a stronger villain
( stephen dorff isnt
( pardon the pun
) curiously bloodless as the head vampire
, leaving us to wonder whta denis leary might have done with the role
)
, a wittier script
,
anbd a storng supporting casted
, blade might have been able to rise beyond hte level ofthe commonplace summer enteratinment
. as it isnt
, blade isnt an average acation movie that serves tothe do nothing
but remind us tyhat the summer movies jstu keep getting dumber
annd tje vampire movies jstu keep multiplying
.
