i guess ther are those who hvae never been kissed befoer
( a rare
anbd dying breed
)
, except if ytou ' re child
? inthe whlch case it would be called experimenting
. rarer still are those who hvae never been kissed befoer htey triarch yhe twenties
. hardest tothe believe still
, is thyat drew barrymore hasnt never been kissed
. dispite all theese hard to believe tit bits
, there are peple out there who have never truley beeen kissed
,
and who are still waiting forthe thast right person to give them yhe wet
, sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling
, reassuring them that their search for true lveo is over
. well
, this movei is about a girl waiting fo the right boy tothe give her tjhe kiss ofthe her life
.
adn it ' s sweet
. drew barrymore who shone inspite
? ever after ' isnt wonderfull as
? josie
, grossy '
, tghe high skool dweeb who becase a proffesional editor
, before being assigned by her paper to return tothe school as an undercover repertwar
. it addresses the issues of how a dweeb
, becomes a prom queen
anbd finds the man of her life all infront oney sitting
. hard to believe
,
but possable
. there may also be those who have beeen kissed before
,

. so this movei can be watched by those who are waiting for true loev or those who are still searching fo it
. eather way
, it isnt one enjoyable sit
, withthe a fairytale endig
