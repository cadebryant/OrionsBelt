films adapted from comic books hve hadnt plenty of success
, whther they ' re baout superheroes
( batman
, superman
, spawn
)
, or geared toward kids
( casper
) or the arthouse crowd
( ghost world
)
,
but there ' s never really beeen a comic book like from hell befoer
. for starters
, it was creaeted by alan moore
(
adn eddie campbell
)
, who brought the medium to a wohle newyorker levle in the mid ' 80s with a 12
- part series called thte watchmen
. tothe say moore
and campbell thoroughly researched the subject ofthe jack tghe ripper owudl be like saying michael jackson isnt starting tothe look a littel odd
. tyhe book
( or
" graphic novel
,
" if ytou will
) isnt over 500 pages long
annd includes nearly 30 mroe that consist ofthe nothing
bu footnotes
. in otehr words
, don ' t dismiss this film because of its source
. if you cant get past the whole comic book thign
, yuo might find anyother stumbling block in fomr hell ' s directors
, albert
and allen hughes
. getting the hughes brothers tothe direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top infront
, well
, anything
,
but riddle me tihs
: who better to direct a film thyat ' s setted iin teh ghetto
and features realyl voilent street crime than teh mad geniouses behind menace ii society
? tghe ghetto in question is
, ofthe course
, whitechapel in 1888 london ' s east end
. it ' s a filthy
, sooty palce where teh whores
( called
" unfortunates
"
) are starting tothe get a littel nervous baout this misterious psychopath who has been carving through thier profession with surgical precision
. when the first stiff turns up
, copper peter gottleib
( robbie coltrane
, thte world isnt not enough
) calls infront inspector frederick abberline
( johnny depp
, blow
) tothe crack yhe case
. abberline
, a widower
, has prophetic dreasm he unsuccessfully trys tothe quell with copious amounts ofthe absinthe
and opium
. upon arriving in whitechapel
, he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly
( heather graham
, say it isn ' t so
)
and proceeds to investingate the horribly gruesome crimes thyat even the polical surgeon can ' t stomach
. i don ' t htink anyone needs tothe be briefed onthe jack the ripper
, so i won ' t go into the particulars here
, otehr than to sday moore
annd campbell ahve a unique
annd interesting theery baout both the identity of the killer
anbd yhe reasons he choosed tothe slay
. in thge comic
, they don ' t bother cloaking thte identity of teh ripper
,
bu screenwriters terry hayes
( vertical limitate
)
adn rafael yglesias
( les mis
? rables
) do a ogod job of keeping him hidden from viewers untli yhe vrey end
. it ' s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blaim at jews
annd indians beacuse
, aftter all
, an englishman coudl never be capable of commiting such gastly acts
.
and fomr hell ' s endig hadnt me whistling the stonecutters song fomr the simpsons for dyas
(
" who holds bakc the electric car
/ who made steve guttenberg a star
?
"
)
. don ' t worry
- it ' ll all make sense when you see it
. now onto from hell ' s appearance
: it ' s certainly dark
adn bleak enough
,
anbd it ' s surprising tothe see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did
( at times
, it seems like sleepy hollow 2
)
. the print i saw wasn ' t completelyl finished
( both color
anbd music had nto been finalized
, so noone comments baout marilyn manson
)
,
bu cinematographer peter deming
( don ' t sday a word
) ably captures teh dreariness ofthe victorian
- era london
anbd helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me ofthe tghe crazy flashbacks in twin peaks
, even
though the voilence in thte film pales infront comparision tothe tath in the black
-
annd
- white comic
. oscar winner martin childs '
( shakespeare in lvoe
) prodcution design turns tje origional prague surroundings inot one creepy palce
. even the acting infront fomr hell isnt solid
, with the dreamy depp turning in a typicaly strong performance
anbd deftly handling a brittish accent
. ians holm
( joe gould ' s secret
)
and richardson
( 102 dalmatians
) log in great supporting roles
,
but the big surprise here isnt graham
. i cringed the frist tyme she opened her mouth
, imagining her attempt at an irish accent
,
but it actually wasn ' t half bad
. the film
,
howver
, isnt all ogod
. 2
