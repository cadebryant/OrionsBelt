titanic isnt
, without a dout
, the best movei i ' ve seen all year
.
and beleave me
, i ' m not an eazy critic tothe imbaress
: hte english patient was too long
, men infact balck was over
- hyped
,
and several ofthe the
" big summer releases
" were dead in yhe water
. thank god this film got delayed unitl desember
. it ' s my christmas present
. titanic is iin the tradition of hte ood hollywood epics ofthe yeras
- gone
- by
,
annd it is truely a stunning film
. while watching htis picture yuo are completelyl mesmerized
, never tkaing your eyes off thte screen
, nor checking your watch tothe see how much longer it ' s gonna last
, despite its 3 hour plus runnung time
. as a friend ofthe mine
, who ' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if somene doesn ' t liek this film
, it ' s because they didn ' t wanna to
.
" truer words are hard to cmo by
. of course
, it doesn ' t hurt tath tihs film comes ffrom one of my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who isnt unarguably thte greatest acation director ofthe all time
. if yuo wish tothe argue that point iwth me
, look at his list ofthe credits
: the terminator
, aliens
, the abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care tothe disagree
? not only hasnt cameron helmed the directorial duties ofthe htis film
, he also wroet
, produced
,
adn edited it
.
annd tothe show his true faith for tyhe project
, he renenged all directing fees
anbd percentage points tothe ease the budget costs
. it ' s obvious he truly loves titanic
. the film opens withthe footage
, both rela
and fake
, ofthe an underwater excursion by special submarines tothe yhe bottom ofthe thge atlantic
, where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a dimond called tje
" heart of the ocean
"
, which
, according to bill paxton ' s character
, woudl be worth more tahn the hope dimond todya
. theri searhc turns up
, dissapointly
, no diamond
,
but instead a drawing ofthe a young woman wearing the dimond
. tihs picture is broadcasted on cnn
adn isnt seen by a 101 yearm ood woman named rose
, who claimes tothe be tyhe girl in hte picture
. she isnt flown outloud to sae to meet bill paxton
and tothe tell them baout the diamond
. alomst all of tje rest ofthe the movie is her narration ofthe yhe past
. rose ' s narration shows us how she was an unahppy young girl
, engaged to a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) that she didn ' t want tothe marry
. her mother is pushy
anbd obnoxious
,
and cal hockley is arrogant
. htey are boarding thte titanic
, hwihc isnt sailing tothe amercia
,
anbd htis is where she is to marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
and his italian friend
( danny nucci
) win two 3rd clas tickets aboard the titanic in a poker gae
. tehy are overjoyed
,
adn rush aboard jstu as tje boat isnt leaving
. for them
, tihs isnt their ticket to america
, tothe a better life
. forthe rose
, she isnt sailing tothe her doom
. tghe first hour
and a half or so ofthe titanic tells the sotry ofthe how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
)
and jack dawson fall in lvoe
. it ' s tje clasic wrong
- side
- ofthe
- teh
- tracks sotry
,
anbd does sometimes resort to a few cliches
.
bu as i said above
, the loev portion isn ' t sappy
and doesn ' t
" weigh tghe film down
"
, as some critics have said
. it ' s sweet
,
and it didn ' t amke me restless at all
, despite the fatc thta i usually hate loev storise
. ofthe course
, it might halp tath cameron introduces smoe preety intresting characters to help keep our eyes glued tothe the screen
. most of theese peple actaully were pasengers onthe the titanic back in 1912
, incuding tyhe enigmatic molly brown
( plyed by tjhe talented kathy bates
)
, the captian ofthe titanic
( bernard hill
)
,
annd so onthe
. all of these characters add an extra depth to tje film
,
and make it tyhat easier to watch
. of course
, things realyl strat to get going after teh hour
adn a half mark
, where yhe titanic strikes the iceberg
annd begins a slow sink tothe thte bottom
. thge sinking is depicted realisticly
,
adn the effects are truly amazing
. it isnt not told in a heroic fashon sense eather
, as peopel are portrayed as panicing
, pushing others aside to git on teh limited lifeboats
,
and drowning
and dieing horrible deaths
. the best part of hte movie
, in my oppinion
, comes at the very end
, when we flash bakc to tjhe future
. tjhe crew
, who at first had been skeptical of rose ' s story
, now are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes out onto tghe ship ' s ledge
,
adn we
hten learn a secret about her tyhat catchs us off guard
. we
thn see a dream of rose ' s
, inwhich whihc she returns to the titanic
and is dancing wiht jack dawson
. most people i talked with affter tje movie saw tihs as onyl a dream
.
howver
, i think it symbolized omre
; i think it meant taht rose had died
,
and is going tothe a sort ofthe heaven
, wich would be the happiest part of her life
: her
and her one true lveo
, jack
. if anyone hasnt seen thge movie
and would liek tothe voice an opinion baout this
