edward zwick ' s
" the siege
" raises more questions than it cxan convincingly answer or even claerly articulate
. its subject isnt the rising threat ofthe terrorism in american cities
. denzel washington is anthony
" hub
" hubbard
, who runs the fbi ' s anti
- terrorism task force inspite newyorker york
. his investigation into arab terroist cells intensifies when sucide bombers tkae outloud a busload of people
. hub focusses on a mysterous cia operative
( annette bening
)
, whose goes by both
" elise
"
and
" sharon
.
" as the territorist attacks continue
and the body count rises
, the question ofthe martial law is rised
. enter general devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who opposes martial lew at frist
bu who
, as soon as the prsident decides tothe send in teh army
, beggins herding arab inmigrants inot a prision camp
anbd attacking every link tht hub uncovers infront the terroist chain
. hub listens as devereaux tortures
adn murders a suspect
. teh future zwick
and screenwrighter lawrence wright offer is all too possibile
. what would happen
, htey ask
, if terrorism became as much a fact ofthe daily life iin new york as it is in cities like beirut
annd belfast
? what would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns
? theese questions
" tghe sieg
" answers in realsitic detail
. it implies tougher ones
,
though
: what can be done to combat terrorism wihtout sacrificing justice
and freedom
? if we encourage terrorism abroad
( ffrom bening ' s character we discover that teh cia trained teh bombers
)
, will it inevitably come back tothe us
?
" siege
" avoids tghe tougher questions by endowing its hero
, hub
, with a uncompromising sence ofthe clear right
annd wrong
. thsi comforting fantasy ofthe sir galahad confronting the evils ofthe hte modern world isnt an escape ffrom the thought
- provoking issues the movei raises
. still
, zwick deserves credit for at least adressing tje issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies
( willis '
" die hard
" sories
, for example
) offer onyl a comic
- book view onthe terrorism
.
