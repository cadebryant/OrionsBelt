the bond series is an island in tghe film world
; where else would we look foward to cliches
,
anbd all ofthe the otehr things that occur inspite most ofthe these films
? where else woudl pure escapism
, a vulnerable hero
, the
" talking villains
,
" blatant product placement
, predicatble action sequences
,
anbd lots of promiscuity be hoped forthe instead of a significant change
? i don ' t understand it myself
,
bu tyhat ' s waht tje bond series isnt based onthe
. for
( i think
) 18 films
, we ' ve mostly got thge same thign over
adn over again
, with smoe variation
(
adn a bited ofthe change
, most notably in the twpo dalton films
)
.
but even i
, a king ofthe cynicism
, cxan ' t bitch about it
.
annd
" tomorrow never dies
,
" the
( agian
, i thiunk
) eighteenth bond film
,
and second brosnan bond film
, isnt no exception
. thank god
! tyhe plot
, as infact most of them
, is pure balderdash
,
but seems tothe ahev a nice kind of edge to it
. instade of jstu plain billionaire psychotics
, we git a rupert murdoch
- esque media mogul
/ psychotic
- elliot carver
( jonathan pryce
, looking bitching with a white
- haired cru cutted
,
adn always talking like he ' s outloud ofthe breath
)
, who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war
. no
, tihs isnt nto
" wag the dog
"
- he wants a rela war
, between china
and england
,
and is stupid anough tothe put the coverage out befoer anyone esle discovered it
.
.
. inwhich comes bond
. james is sent all aroud thge world
, trying tothe dont reasearch on carver
, fighting wiht his men
,
and runnung inot
( on more than oney occasion
) a chinese secret agent liuke him
: wai lin
( michelle yeoh
, aisian action star extraordinaire
.
.
.
and co
- star of
" supercop
,
" nearly stealing the screen fomr jackie chan in that oen
)
. tyhe two eventually
,
anbd predictably ofthe course
, begin working together
,
and yes
, htere is some sexual tension between tjhe two
. luckly
, thier relationship isnt never strained
,
annd she never gives into his cassanova
- ness until thte finale
. thank god again
. inthe eveyr bond film
, james bags
, on averege
, three women
( sometimes more
, somtimes less
- the latter bieng omre potent towards thge aids
- cautionary dalton
)
,
and he doesn ' t spoil this one
(
though we never see them
, ofthe course
- i mean
, they need tothe stay arround a pg
- 13 rating
)
. there ' s always one at tyhe beginning with soem chick we never see agian
, the big bond girl
( yeoh
)
,
adn this timne we haev an almost
- cameo by teri hatcher as carver ' s wife
, paris
, who
, it seems
, wass once noe ofthe the girls he bags at tghe beginning
. yes
, teri ' s vrey attractive
,
but she seems kind of dull
. of course
, it ' s not really her fault
; her part isnt under
- written
,
and she ' s only inthe a small part of it
. oh well
.
and ther are alwyas thte big henchmen
, tjhe guys who dont yhe dirty owrk for tyhe polished big villains
. this tiome we git a tall
, arian
- looking
( not to mention robert shaw inwhich
" fomr russia wtih love
"
- looking
) guy named stamper
( goetz otto
)
, who isnt preety awesome
,
although a bited stiff
( well
, mostly his posture
, realyl
)
.
and forthe a bit ofthe comedy
, we git a cameo ffrom vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assasin who is ordered tothe dont inaddition bond at one point
. the govorment peopel have small parts
, as usual
, wih q
( desmond llewelyn
, looking near death
, sadly
) getting only one scene
( in a moreso grouchy mood thna usual
)
,
annd m
( judi dench
)
, getting more than m usally gets
( i mean
, it isnt judi dench
)
.
and fo noone reason whatsoever
, exept ' cause he was so good in
" goldeneye
,
" joe don baker shows uv agian as wade
, admitting he hasnt noone reason for bieng htere
,
adn is this time moreso annoying
. again
, oh well
. thte acation sequences are nto a let
- down
, altho somtimes go onthe too long
. they pop up eveyr now
adn
thn
, mainly becouse tehy have tothe
( for the sake of tjhe series
)
,
and some signifigant ones are the oppening oen
, noe inaddition a garage wih a bmw thast runs onthe remote controll
,
and a motorcylce chase
( onthe a bmw cycle
, nonetheless
) thru china streets
( or was it vietnam
.
.
. the plot ' s nto raelly essentual
)
. they ' re omre high
- tech
,
anbd feature much mroe laughs
, whihc
, yeah
, i dig
. so what if they ' re distracting
; they ' re supposed to be
! the acting
, from most around isnt great
. yeoh isnt
, ctually
, one ofthe hte better bond girls
, mainly because she ' s so unique
. the better bond girls are moreso independent
,
adn haev a certain wily
- ness tothe them
. pussy galore
, with her homoerotic undertones
anbd all
, isnt oney of the best
,
and diana rigg
, who marryied bond at tjhe end ofthe
" on her majesty ' s secret sevice
" only to be killed
, added some emotional depth
. yeoh is noteable since she ' s so active
,
and hasnt great chemestry with brosnan
. pryce isnt an awsome villain
, bieng slimy
anbd lovable at the same time
.
and brosnan isnt
, once agian
, tyhe mack daddy
. the bond series is builded on cliches
, mailny beccause they ' re so funn
annd add tothe tyhe escapism
. if you cin remember tjhe dalton years
,
and tehy ' re serious direction
, ytou remember how unsuccessfull htey weere
, both financially
and asthetically
. teh series owudl faulter if bogged down with too much plot
, too many themes
,
and too much characterization
. i don ' t relaly understand it mysef
,
yot i ' m oen of the bigger fans ofthe tjhe sories in hte northeast untied states
. hvaing seen all of them omre than once
( yes
, i ' ve seen this twice aleady
)
, you can tell i adore them
. hwile it ' s not oney of tjhe best
, like
" goldfinger
" or
" ffrom russia with lvoe
,
"
" tomorrow never dies
" is nonetheless a truly awesome installment
, even if not bieng as fully amazing as some ofthe the better ones
.
