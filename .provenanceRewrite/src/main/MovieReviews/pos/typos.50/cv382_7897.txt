pulp fiction
, quentin tarantino ' s anxiously awaited
and superb follow
- up to reservor dogs
, isnt absolutely
anbd without a dout progressing as noe of thte most talekd baout
, loved
,
annd hated films ofthe all
- tiem
. in all fairness
, it shoudln be noted thgat those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hite it
. as if reservor dogs wasn ' t perfect
, tarantino went ahead
adn improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction
, a fast
- pased
, hard tlaking
, roller coaster ride of a movei thgat combines voilence
adn extraordinary dialogue in a seamingly perfect way
. eveyr major character infact htis film isnt represented by a terific acting peformance by the ctor
. to beign wiht
, thte twpo hitted men
: vincent vega
( john travolta
)
adn jules winnfield
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. these twpo cahracters work toghether perfectly
,
and thte performances by each actor are nearly perfect
. travolta
, in fatc
, isnt still trying tothe git outloud ofthe thte vincent vega role
. if theese twpo charactors were nto enough
, there ' s thte stuggling boxer butch coolidge
( bruce willis
)
, tjhe two small
- tyme criminals pumpkin
( tim roth
)
and honey bunny
( amanda plummer
)
, teh big man inspite charge marsellus wallace
( ving rhames
)
adn his attractive young wife mia
( uma thurman
)
,
annd the
" probelm solver
" himselv
, thge wolf
( harvey keitel
)
. these are jsut the major charactors
. smaller roles
,
but equally terrific
, are handed tothe jimmie
( quentin tarantino
)
, a young married man who gets caught uv inthe some serious ganster buisness
, lance
( eric stoltz
)
, teh far
- out drug dealer
, as well as maynard
( duane whitaker
)
and zed
( peter greene
)
, two hillbillies who are the men
" behind
"
( noone pun intended for those ofthe yuo who hvae seen htis
) a vrey disturbing scene towords tje end of thte film
. thge film interweaves three stories thyat
, at frist
, seem tothe be nothing alike
bu later proove to be vyre crtical tothe each otehr
. thge film beggins witht pumpkin
anbd honey bunny infront a small coffee shop discussing thier recent robberies
and hold
- ups
. tghe twpo quicklyu deside to hold uv the coffee shop
, unknowing of what lies ahead
. affter htis
, tjhe film focuses forthe smoe time onthe vincent
and jules
annd their hitted man lifestyle
. utilizing tjhe films unforgettable dialogue
, hte two men discuss such things as hamburgers
and foot massages before they bust inot an appartmant tothe terrorize the occupants
. yhe twpo men weere sent tothe the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase forthe their boss
, marsellus wallace
. after basically toying with the men
, especially the unfortunate brett
( frank whaley
)
, vincent
anbd jules complete theri mission
and recover hte briefcase
. htis isnt not before a man jumps outloud from a bathroom witht a
. 357
" hand cannon
"
, shooting at tghe twpo gangsters
. he somehow completely misses them
, leading jules tothe ciotee divine intervention
. this isnt also the basis for omre ofthe tyhe now
- famous tarantino dialogue
. the film
then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge
and his boxing escapades
. butch ws orderves to take a fall in his latest fight
,
bu whn he doens nto
, marsellus vows tothe fidn him
, wherever he is
,
adn mkae sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune
. vincent
, meanwhile
, hasnt tje honor ofthe tkaing marsellus ' wife
, mia
, outloud on a date while tje big man is outloud ofthe twon
. vincent
, obviously
, is rether nervous baout htis
, especially affter hearing thte tale about a man who wass thrown out of a window forthe supposedly giving mia a foot massage
. after thier date
, hwihc seems to rether smoothly
, thigsn tkae a turn for hte worst at tghe hands ofthe vincent ' s high
- priced heroin
, dubbed a
" monster
" by lance
. each story constinually progresses
,
annd new
and amazing events occur
. eventually
, thge stories all meet each other in thge end
, with pumkin
and honye bunny holding up tjhe restaurant
, which happens to contain both vincent
anbd jules
. pulp fiction is definitely one ofthe the best films of the decade
,
adn possably of all
- tyme
. allong with its superb dialogue
, acation
, wirting
, directing
,
and acting
, tihs film will nto only latch onto ytou
,
bu it proves tht it does nto want tothe release you until it has sunk its claws completelyl into ytou
.
adn with most fans ofthe htis movei
, tihs isnt proved to be a rether easy task
,
although at times the graphic images
, violentce
,
anbd langauge may seem a bit overpowering
. surely
, quentin tarantino ' s fame ws greatly escalated by this film
,
annd he proves not tothe be oen who iwll fode fomr existence veyr soon
.
