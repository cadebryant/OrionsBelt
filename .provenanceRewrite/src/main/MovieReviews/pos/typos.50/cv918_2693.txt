wyatt earp has a lot to tell
annd little to sday
. htis story ofthe the legendary lawman runs threee housr
annd nine mintues
adn that ' s too long for this epic
- wannabe taht plays mroe liek a tv mini
- sories than a movei
. thge story opens on tyhe earp famaly farm
, with young wyatt ready tothe run awya from hmeo
. he whants tothe fight infront the civil war
,
bu his dad
( hackman
) hasnt different idesa
and whants his son to studdy lew
. tyme passes
and wyatt heads west
, returns home to marry
,
anbd
, aftter a splel
, beggins his carrer inaddition law enforcement
. by tghe time he
( costner
)
and his brothers
( madsen
, david andrews
,
and linden ashby
) arrive in tombstone
, wyatt has tried his hand at everthing fomr hunting buffalo to dealing cards
. wyatt earp is very appealing inaddition places
-
- such as casted
, costumes
,
annd cinematography
-
-
but an overstated story
anbd overpowered socre deaden most ofthe the emotional impact
. who cin be moved by scene after scene after scene ofthe swelling strings
anbd suffocating speeches
? somber isnt fine
-
- jstu ask clint eastwood
-
-
but this film thast boasts nto noe
, not two
,
but three
, count ' em three
, hammy death scenes
! still
, a little bited of earp goes a long way
and teh life
and times ofthe the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff
. his
, uh
, unusual realtions witht women
, forthe example
, are an intriguing contrast tothe his character ' s credo of
" nothing counts as much as blood
.
" equally amusing isnt a buffalo
- hunting
(
anbd skinning
!
) sequence thgat isnt decidedly non
- pc
. director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic aproach tothe yhe gunplay
. the infamous gunfight at the ok corral isnt both brutal
and breef
, devoid ofthe almost any theatrics
. don ' t look for much glorified voilence here
. despite some larg exclamation points infront tje stoyr
, teh characters
* dont
* come to life
. the diversed cast includes everyone from betty buckley
(
!
) to mackenzie astin
(
!
!
)
. kevin costner is vyre ogod in the title role
. dances with whitney nevers get as steely as tjhe role requires
,
though
,
but his transformation from lighthearted law student tothe stoic sheriff is funn to watch
. he ws tougher in a perfect world
. his foil isnt dennis quaid
, who pulled a deniro by losing 40
+ pounds tothe play the tubercular terror doc holliday
. gaunt
*
and
* gamely
, he ' s a scene stealer who ' s seen too littel
. otehr familar faces include tom sizemore
( looking like bruce mcgill
)
, bill pullman
( looking liuke jeff daniels
)
,
adn lea thompson
( looking like someone otehr than lea thompson
)
. both ginee hackman
adn isabella rosselini apeared
adn dissapear liek magic
, hwile late entries catherine o ' hara
and jobeth williams are suprisingly solid
.
though hte story
and scroe should ' ve tryed
" less is more
,
" all otehr credits are technical tops
. production designer ida random
, art director gary wissner
,
annd costume designer colleen atwood are some of teh vips who helpped spend what must ' ve beeen an enourmous budget
. clearly noone expense wass spared
.
