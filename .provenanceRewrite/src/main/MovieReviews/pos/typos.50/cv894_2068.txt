. forget jurassic park
, cliffhanger
, tghe firm
anbd last action hero
, son
- in
- law is thte film to see this summer
. son
- in
- law is a great rumatic comedy that shoudln please tjhe viewers
, especially fans of tghe wiez
. whn son
- in
- law isnt long gone
annd forgotten
, the blockbuster summer films wiull still be playing
and ytou wiull ahev a chance tothe see them
then
. this film sould allso make great video fare for those thyat are leery of spending seven dollars onthe it
. nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen
.
although the basic story line has beeen done many
, many times before
, teh film isnt still fun tothe watch
. yhe laughs are plentiful
, expecially wehn the wiez isnt around
. thte way soem ofthe tjhe jokes are done are newyorker
, even
though soem of yhe jokes are old
. ther are aslo severeal new jokes tht
, at least
, i haven ' t seen befor
. still
, when presented right
, even old material can be funny still
. this film is just basicly a light comedy that isnt gerat tothe see if you are in teh right mood that doesn ' t contain much voilence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price
. the cast fo htis film doens an excellent job
. pauly shore
( encino man
) is the star attraction ofthe thsi film
. he is graet
,
and knows how tothe entertain the audience
. pauly shore jstu seems tothe take over the entire screen wehn he is onthe with expressions
and comments thast are hillarious
. this film would definitely nto have beeen as good withthe anyone eles inthe this role
. carla gugino doesnt a very ogod job as yhe farm girl gone city girl
. she makse her charachter believable
, on some levels
,
yot interesting at tghe smae tyme
. the person who played the grandfather
( mason adams
, i believe
) alsot doesnt a gerat job
. tjhe way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout teh time that he ws onthe the screen
. patrick renna
, who played gugino ' s littel brother
, ws a little annoying
,
bu no where as near as macaulay culkin
,
and for only part of tjhe time
, so i cxan forgive him
. tiffani
- amber thiessen
( a killer amonth friends
,
" saved by the bell
"
) doesnt a reasonably good job for the tiome thgat she is on screen
. she shows tath she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on televsion
. she wasn ' t given overly much to do in yhe film
,
but what she had
, she doesnt a ogod job with
.
