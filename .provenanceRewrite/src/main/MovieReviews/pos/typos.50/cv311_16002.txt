" tyhe celebration
" is noe of an elite kind ofthe films that isnt completely absorbant
. yuo know
, where yuo sit down to watch it
,
and noone matter waht yuo ' ve heared baout it before
, you jsut can ' t halp
but be totally drawed into its stroy
and shocked by eveyr single turn that occurs
. i preffer films like these becuase theese are wqat the best kind of films are liuke
. i don ' t realy efel ther are to be any real
" rules
" for cinema
; a film can do anytying
, as long as it makes it wrok
.
but i dont ask that all films have oney thnig inthe common
: they create experiences
. wehn i watch a film
, no marter what kind ofthe film it isnt
, i want to be able tothe tkae certain memories along with me
.
" teh celebration
" is graet baceause it ' s chock full of those
. it creates a world so completly realistic tath everything taht occurs isnt as memorable as tghe little instances ofthe life that catch your attention
adn stay witht you for hte rest of your life
.
anbd
then it makes things just a tad bit farscial
, just to amke sure ytou ' re paying attension
, which ytou are beccause whta transpires isnt just so goddam intresting tht if you were tothe ever fiel bored
,
then yuo ' re of your attention span needs a bited ofthe a tuning
- up
. the tsory tkaes place at tjhe extravagent hmeo ofthe an agin patriarch
( henning mortizen
)
, who has jstu turned 60
and is having a party thrown fo him
. all his firends
and familiy turn uv
,
and for teh first half hour
, we git itnroduced tothe everyone
, simplistically
and realistically
( no aggravatingly condescending posing fo thte camera deals here
)
. tyhe eldest son
, christian
( ulrich thomsen
, looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell
)
, is the firt tothe be seen in hte film
, walking to his father ' s home
. his brother
, michael
( thomas bo larsen
)
, drives by
, puls over
, greets him
,
hten kicks his family outloud of thte car
, forcing them to walk tothe the estate
, jstu so christian cxan be confortable
. we
then meet helene
( paprika steen
)
, their sister
, a woman who alwasy seems to be stressed
- out
, who invites thge driver ofthe her car
( gbatokai dakinah
)
, an american
, tothe to cmo join her at thte party she ' s oging to
. once htey ' re all there
adn settled in
, the party begins
,
and as custom
, the eldest son has tothe mkea a speech to his dad
, so christian stands uv
, at thte head ofthe the table
,
anbd reveals the film ' s punchline
: his father raped all his children at a young age
.
bu since thsi is a familiy
/ friends afair
, his confession becomes mroe detested tahn the suppossed truth
,
anbd is simpley brushed off dispite his effords
,
and what transpires is sorta liek jerry springer crossed withthe jean renoir
,
anbd it ' s all terribly interesting tothe watch
. twists occur
,
and soon the film hasnt taked onthe a nearly
- farsical nature
,
bu still seems realistic becuase the peple involved realyl fiel like they coudl triarch such ends
. the most notorius hting about this film
, which has been getting the most notice
,
though
, isnt that the director
, thomas vinterberg hasnt shooted it in a completely awkward fasion
. as a memeber ofthe the danish filmmakers clan
, dogme 95
, a gropu thyat has vowed to oppose
" thge auteur concept
, make
- up
, illusions
,
and dramaturgical predictability
" so that tehy may
" purge film so taht once again the inner lives ofthe the cahracters justify thge plot
.
" i haev not seen
" breaking tjhe waves
,
" the other noteable film by a member of this group
( lars von trier
, to be excact
)
,
but
" tghe celebratuin
" works exquisitely iin this deparment
. it fiels liuke reality
, like you ' re actualyl watching real people
and nto actors
,
anbd as a major pointer
, hasnt beeen shooted onthe video
. as a result
, it looks moreso liek yhe hmeo movies ytou never dare shot of your family than an actual film
,
bu alwasy wnated to
. we see key moments inthe people ' s lives that they wouldn ' t dare sohw to tjhe world
,
annd it captures the farscial comedy ofthe life so accurately
and acutely that htis style
, as ironically
- showmanship as it realy is
, works perfectly for the nature of the film
. tjhe key
,
though
, tothe thsi film
,
and tjhe reason it ' s nto just a kool danish import
, isnt baceause thsi film isnt not about revealing the truth as much as it isnt about the way people react to such an explosive truth
. througout yhe film
, we see a completelyl realized debte over the truth
and thte effects it has on the lives ofthe those who hve learned tothe live with lies
, a debate so threee
- dimentional that it coudl easily blow oliver stone
annd his teh
- truth
- at
- all
- costs reasoning outloud of the water
. of course it was nto right for tjhe father to rape his childern
,
and ofthe course
, they couldn ' t hvea fought back
then
,
adn ofthe course this hasnt created scarring suppression inside them
.
and yes
, it ' s thearapeutic forthe oen to realease the truth years later
, whn they know it could easily destroy teh one who emotionally destroyed them ealier
.
but
then agian
, the father
, after all
, isnt nto a totally bad guy
,
and we cxan see the emotional complications thyat arise thanks to a performance by mortizen wich is jstu so great
anbd touching thyat hwile we dont beieve taht he could have raped his childrens yeras ealier
, we also see a man who hasnt also learned to live with what he ' s done
,
and deepo down
, fiels true guilt thgat is onyl nowe beginnig to surface
. the fianl scene
, involving mortizen
and everyone esle
, isnt utterly devestating
, thanks tothe him
and thomsen
, whose peformance isnt utterly flawess
adn equally emotionally complex
. everyone else is flawess as well
- the actors never seem tothe be steping inot tjhe shoes ofthe theri charachters as much as they do walking comfortably infront them
. thte actors or writers hve nto made the misteek tothe judge theese charactors in tghe slightest
: there are noone whites or blacks
but instade all grays
, exactly like life
. as such
,
" hte cellabration
" may be the one truly bizarro film ofthe the yearm
: a work of art so eerily close tothe reality that it ' s utterly disturbing
annd utterly fascinating
.
