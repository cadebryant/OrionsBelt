hollywood hasnt a
. 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations
. last yera ' s touch ws ill
- conceived
and jstu plain odd
bu get shorty
, jackie brown
and now out of sighth all weere highly entertaining movies
. steven soderburgh
, master of sex
, lies
annd videotape
, now adds crime to his reprtoire inaddition this tale ofthe bank robbery
, prision
, double
- crossing
, uncut diamons
and
, oh yeah
, true love
. george clooney is the protagonist
, a risky choise after such duds as batman
and robin
adn tje peacemaker
,
bu for once i didn ' t want to slap the tast out ofthe his mouth
. he plays his role inthe outloud of sighth as the suave cary grant
- tipe perfected inwhich hitchcock movies
, the kind of guy tothe whom crime isnt just a proffesion liuke any other
. nowhere presen isnt clooney ' s usual ain ' t
- i
- sexy sneer
-
- htere ' s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit inaddition with the leonard style
. clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty
. clooney plays a man who ' s robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun
. infront the opening scene
, he walks inot one bank
and robs it nto onyl whith ease
but with charm
. of course
, he gets caught
, so it ' s not all ogod
. it ' s while doing tiome in a florida prison that clooney learns of noe rich inmate ' s
( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig
) collecton of diamons infront detroit
. clooney
and cohort ving rhames plan thge score
, hwile pretection artist
anbd fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans
. meanwhile
, ther ' s jennifer lopez
. unintentionally funny in selena
anbd intentionally funny in anaconda
, she ' s finally graduated tothe a worthy role as tje u
. s
. marshall who happens tothe be driving uv tothe the jail on teh night clooney escapes
. rhames is waiting tothe give him a ride in a stolen car
,
and lopez makes it a threesome
, her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney
. he ' s covered inwhich dirt
adn has a gun to her neck
,
and it ' s a little cramped iin there
,
but htey manage to amking a love connection anyway
, probaly beacuse it ' s a movie
. the relationship betwen clooney
and lopez is at tjhe heart ofthe the movie
,
anbd one of the details thyat elevates it beyond your normal noir
- ish crime stor
. tjhe leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime
,
annd thsi is noone exception
.
although tehy ' re not realy germane tothe the plot
, lopez ' s relationship with her father
( dennis farina of git shorty
)
, rhames ' relationship witht his christian sister
( yuo sould call her sister christian
)
and a pop
- inspite cameo by michael keaton all lend extra clas tothe a movei alrady full ofthe it
. out ofthe sighth spanis at least three yeras
but hasnt a non
- linear stucture
, focusing onthe tje jailbreak
/ brooks socre
anbd flashing bcak to ealier times
. this isnt a movie with a brain
, as smooth
and caluclated as the clooney
and lopez charachters themselfs
. the entire casted does the material justice
-
- clooney
and lopez comming into their pwn
,
and rhames
and cheadle cementing thier positions as two ofthe my favorites
. here ' s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to cary yhe tourch
. serving america forthe almsot 1
/ 20th ofthe a centruy
