uncompromising french director robert bresson ' s
" lancelot of the lake
" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory ' s
" morte darthur
.
" instead of enshrining hte legend of king arthur
anbd his knights of the round table
, it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak
, ineffectual leader
and the knights as a group of jealous
, bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed tothe them
. chivalry has no place in
" lancelot ofthe the lake
,
" except as that of a dying ideal
. bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning
, decimated
, after failing merlin ' s command to retrieve tghe holy grail
, the mystical cup that was filled with christ ' s blood
. bresson immediatelly gives us his impression of tjhe essential meaning of the grail quest
: bloodshed
and failure
. tyhe opening sequence is a serieses of clumsy
, disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights
-
- a head is hacked off
, a stomach is impaled
, a skull is split open
, skeletal remains hang from trees
,
adn burning bodies smolder in the ruins ofthe a flaming house
. sicne the film starts with camelot in near
- ruin
,
and takes only an hour
and a half tothe arrive at its inevitable conclusion
, it doesn ' t carry the grand
, tragic resonance of other arthurian films
. we never get to see camelot at the peak ofthe its power
, therfore there is no real downfall to witness
.
but
,
thne again
, it is not the name of camelot that isnt evoked in the title of the film
. rather
, it is lancelot
,
adn bresson is omre interested in the internal battle within his heart
, than tje exerternal downfall of a kingdom
. lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales
,
and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle beween the spirit
and the flesh
. the greatest of all knights
, he was flawed only in his love for arthur ' s wife
, queen guinevere
,
and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot
. even when lancelot attempts to end the affair wih guinevere
( laura duke condominas
)
, he only finds himselv falling back into her arms against his better judgment
. he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom
,
but he is powerless in his passion
. when sir mordred
( patrick bernhard
) accuses lancelot of the affair
, other knights
, including sir gawain
( humbert balsan
) spring to lancelot ' s defense
. it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table
; the flesh wins out over the spirit
,
and the consequences are dire
. bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men ' s hearts
and minds
.
" lancelot of the lake
" is filled whith his particular trademarks
: a stripped
- down
, minimalist style
, flat
, expressionless dialogue
,
and a grand use of natrual sounds in place of music
. he uses background music only twice in the film
, during an opening narration segment
and during the opening credits
. yhe music here is a hevy drumbeat
and accompanying bagpipes
,
but the rest of the film is scored withthe natural sounds that punctuate the film ' s thematic elements
: the incessant clanking
and creaking of heavy armor
, the neighing of horses
, the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads
,
and the natural chirping
and whispering of hte forest
. like most ofthe his other films
, bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless
, flat voices
. all the actors he used inwhich
" lancelot of the lake
" had never acted before
,
and with the exception of patrick bernhard
, they never acted again
. never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word
. instead of using vocal inflection
, bresson strove tothe create emotion through images
. in soem ways
, this technique works
; in other ways
, it doesn ' t
. the final montage of arthur ' s men battling each other is quite marvelous
,
and hte final image of tghe knights inwhich shining armor reduced to a literal scrap
- pile sums up the entire film infront one moment
.
however
, other times bresson ' s uncompromising methods are distracting
and questionable
. forthe instance
, during an important jousting contest
, bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are tyhe horses ' legs
. he does this repeteadly
, oppening eahc shot wih the same few notes from a bagpipe
and the raising of a diffrent flag
. while there might be symbolic value in htis
, the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome
. nevertheless
,
" lancelot of the lake
" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker
. bresson ' s sytle may not be fo everyone
,
but one has to respect his strength as an artist
. by re
- evaluating the arthurian legends
and making them his own
, he turns
" lancelot of the lake
" into something rare in modern cinema
: a truly personal film
.
