( critic ' s note
: this review is the longest i ' ve ever written
and still only scratches the surface
. i ' d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis
.
) as my friend
and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of
` the phantom menace '
- how dont i even write this review
? never mind the fact that i ' ve been waiting for a new
` star wars ' movie usance i was seven years old
. never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected
and discussed the movei before it ws even released
. never mind that there ' s so much goign on in this movie infront terms of plot
, action
, spacial effects
and long
- term story that tothe analyze eveyr aspect would take a lot of time
and energy
adn still wouldn ' t cover everything
.
and also like ted does in all ofthe his reviews
, i ' ll try tothe review this in a way different from my usual reviews
and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly tothe you
, the reader
. before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects ofthe the film
, many of the most genaral
annd most significant factors must be concidered
( to get the specifics of the film
, skip this
annd the next four paragraphs
)
. as has been made obvious for the last several years
, another triology of films will be produced to account for the
[ missing
] initial three installments of the
` star wars ' series
( the first of the films was actually episode four
, not one
)
. george lucas
, the creator of the series
, has probablly just assumed most people know the first
- produced trilogy
(
` star wars
, '
` the empire strikes back '
and
` return of the jedi '
) isnt actually the second trilogy
, chronologically
. in media interviews in the past he hasnt explained why the movies were made out of order
,
bu i can ' t reacll his reasons
. with this new film he as writer
and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines
and significant plot points of the first trilogy
( err
.
.
. second trilogy
.
.
. well you nkow what i mean
)
.
anbd in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which
, unfortunately
, may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution
.
[ critic ' s note
# 1
: it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before
and after viewing the film reviewed
,
but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule
. critic ' s note
# 2
: reviewing this film also breaks the univeral critics ' law of reviewing movies
, which as roger ebert coined
,
` it ' s not what a movie is baout
,
but how it is about it
. ' because so many outside factors come inot play in the film ' s plot
and significance as part of a trilogy
,
and just considering modern society
, it again would be difficult
, if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story
.
] first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it
. we konw that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also tjhe father of luke skywalker
, who will lead a successful revolution against him
and his empire
. we know obi
- wan
` ben ' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of
` thge force ' in attempts to become a jedi knight
,
bu would fail
and thus anakin would fall to the
` dark side
. ' we also nkow something about
` the force ' itself
, that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate
and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it
anbd feel it
( the jedi
)
. wqat we don ' t knwo for sure isnt the history of the ruling of the galaxy
, which is most likely much longer
and moreso complex tahn any govenrment we hvae had here on earth
. to me
, this was oen ofthe the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle
, definite order to all the complexity
. also
, it seems that we ' re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books
and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended
. most notably
, details regarding teh emperor from
` empire '
and
` jedi
, '
and that he was once a senator
and his last name is palpatine
. for those who haven ' t kept up with all the
` star wars ' paraphernalia over the years
, there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor
( or his voice at least
)
. with
` the phantom menace ' being the frist chapter of a long saga
, one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid
, inlcuding tyhe histoy behind all the major factors of the series
, especially
` the force '
and the jedi knights
. unfortunately
, this film doens more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of whta must be a hitsory so long
and detailed it could never be explained
. i didn ' t liked thgat aspect to this film
and is one ofthe thge reasons it falls just short of greatness
. if you ' re going to tell a story from the beginning
- tell it from the beginning
( is it possible that after tihs trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes
- 1 through
- 3 to clarify the back story even futher
?
)
.
but i digress
. i ' ve said so much
and
yet i haven ' t even touched on the specifics of the film itself
. all these necessary
` disclaiming ' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the
` star wars ' series is
and this individual film itself
. wqat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we ' ve come to know
and love since the late 1970s
. its similarity to the otehr films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar
,
but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality
. the basic story is rather sorted
, complex
and even confusing at times
. we ' re told that an army known as
` the trade federation ' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo
. we ' re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is
and what their purpose isnt
, instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly
. we ' re introduced to two jedi
, the master qui
- gon jinn
( neeson
)
and his apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( mcgregor
)
. the two are acting as ambassadors of smoe sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation
and the planet ' s queen
, amidala
( portman
)
. the leader of the federation
, an alien called viceroy
, is following the orders of a strange
, mythical character
- an older human man whose face
annd body are covered
and shadowed by the black robe
and hood he wears
. he isnt referred to as lord sidious
but considering his appearance
,
and especially that creepy evil voice of his
, he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series
. sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions
and never in person
. claerly his actuall whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity
( which is never openly revealed infront the film
,
but should be clear to most viewers
. i have a feeling we ' ll delve into his background infront the next two films
)
.
but it doesn ' t take the film long to spring inot action
and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives
adn the film ' s stroy begins to move along
. tje film doesn ' t have one specific plot
and works in the same manner as hte other films in the series where as what we get is one mini
- plot
and adventure on top of another
. there are so many of these mini
- plots
- within
- plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook
. the other films have relied on this type of storytelling
,
but because of the limits of the technology at the time
, the films ' screenplays were allso limiting
. the sense of limitlessness here is what gives
` the phantom menace ' its unique traits
. as we already know
, the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original
` star wars ' triology which means a lot of the background which was unclear
adn
/ or unexplained may be cleared up here as it isnt the beginning ofthe the vast epic story
.
and here thte most signficant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10
- yera
- old anakin skywalker
( lloyd
)
, by qui
- gon jinn
and his introduction to the jedi council
. to briefly summarize the story
, jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala ' s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation
. their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance
but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force
. jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force
,
and through another sub
- plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he iwll enter
, more
adn more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves
. tihs also provides forthe a new elaboration
and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before
. in fact
, it seems tothe be something so important it is upsetting it has never beeen mentioned before
. the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force
and transforms it into something more physical
and scientific which is completely unnecessary
. by the film ' s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot
. it ' s funny how tje reality of the
` star wars ' world seems so embedded in mythology
, new age
- like philosophy
and religion
and
yot the solution tothe all the major conflicts in the series has been violence
. not that this technique hasn ' t been used in movies
and in rela
- life situations countless times throughout history
.
and at least it ' s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun
and exciting matter
. it does border of the cartoonish sometimes
,
but that ' s just the film appealing to our inner child
, which isnt the basic reason the entire saga exists
and hasnt become such a big part of our modern society
.
` the phantom menace ' delivers exactly what you ' d expect from a
` star wars ' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does
but is always why it never truly acheives greatness
. so many things in the film we ' ve seen before
and done with more heart because the filmmakers consentrated just a bit more on story
and character because they were limited
.
but this film is far from bad becasue it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies
.
