, vaughn is ricky
. by day htey are construction workers
. they also are wanna

,
but neither has had much success
. thier last bout pitted them against each other
and was a draw
, leaving bobby ' s record at 5
- 5
- 1
. theese two l
. a
. not
- so
- wise guys also work for max
( peter falk
)

and understanding withthe bobby
,
but who hates ricky ' s guts
. max hasnt an easy job for bobby
; fli tothe new york

( a smooth
and silky sean combs
)
. bobby
, becouse of his lifelong friendship with ricky
, pleads with max to give his pal anyother chance
and let him tag along to the big apple
. against his better judgment
, max agrees
. of course ricky
, a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks
, nearly screws up everything
. while bobby tries tothe stay calm
and professional
, ricky begins swaggering
and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano
. the constrast in styles
and the chemistry between favreau
and vaughn is what mkaes made so enjoyable to watch
. favreau with his hound
- dog face
and slow
- burn personality could be a modern
- day oliver hardy
, onyl much wiser
. vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle
, he just keeps yakking
and yakking
, unaware of the havoc he creates
.
yot despite bobby ' s constant aggravation
and agitation with his partner
, a bond of affection
and loyalty binds them
. the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch
. bobby is button
- downed
, tightly
- wound
, always waiting for the next shoe
- courtesy of ricky
- to drop
. ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates
and is genuinely surprised whn he comes under attack for his faux paus
. in new york
, hte two lackeys are like fish out ofthe water
, stumbling from one situation to another
, trying tothe keep alive
. combs isnt elegant
, cool
and low
- key menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet
. falk is amusing in his small role
, while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobby ' s lowlife girlfriend
. moreso than anything
, made is a movie wtih heart
. it is loud
, obnoxious
and very talkative
.
but the cameraderie betwen bobby
and ricky holds teh key to its interest
. favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut
. he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience
.
