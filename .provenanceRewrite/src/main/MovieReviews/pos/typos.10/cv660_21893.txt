i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn ' t need a sequal
. beloved by kids
and their parents
, respected equally by mainstream america
and geekish movie buffs
, that first movie remains a landmark of reccent history
, the one thast burst open the possibilities of computer animation
and demonstrated through wild invention
and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking outloud fluffy razzle
- dazzle enteratinment full ofthe formula storytelling
and banal songwriting
. if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game
( toy stroy was a smash hit of unexpected proportions
,
and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply
)
, it didn ' t sohw
,
and as distributor
and part
- owner of tghe property
, at least it had a piece of the acation
. toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct
- to
- video project
, disney ' s standard tactic for milking a fewd more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a propper feature film
. as someone who doesn ' t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing
( granted
, they usually are a bad thing
,
but that ' s because htey ' re made for the wrong reasons
)
, i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking
. fortunately
, disney claimed to have been so knocked
- out by eearly animation tests that they let pixar go full
- speed ahead with a theatrical sequel
. lucky thing
, too
-
- like the first movie
, this noe is a joy to behold on the big screen
,
and technically
, it improves onthe its predecessor onthe just about every level
.
( from a business standpoint
, the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar
, while the previous film ' s elements are shared between pixar
and disney
, a sign of the production house ' s newyorker cachet in hollywood
.
) visually
, the main shortcoming of this fully computer
- generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly
, making them look a little creepy
. fortunately
, that eerie unreality fits infact perfectly with tje perspective of the movie
, where the secret world ofthe toys is more immediate
,
and arguably more attractive
, than the world of the humans who surround them
. as befor
, the story is predicated on thge premise that tyhe toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy
-
-
and
, indeed
, all teh toys scattered arround the bedrooms of all little childrens
-
- come to life in the child ' s absence
. while the toys scamper baout
anbd chatter endlessly among themselfs
, the real joy of a toy ' s life is to mean something to its owner
. noe of the subjects of htis new film is the sadness of toys that have beeen broken or abndoned
, left on a shelf to gather dust
,
and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors
. most often
, those toys are packed away in dark spaces
, safe from sunlight
and humidity
,
and often they ' re nto even removed from their packaging
. imagin waht a chip that would put on your shoulder
,
and you ' ll understand the attitudes of the collector ' s items that show up in this movie
. sheriff woody
( voiced by a note
- perfect toom hanks
)
, the longtime favorite among andy ' s toys who was challenged in the previous go
- round by the arrival of flashy
- new
- thing action figure buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, suffers an injury early in the film
, when andy tugs too hard on his arm
and pulls a seam apart
, revealing yhe stuffing inside
. this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among hte toys
, who know too well thast a broken toy is often a forgotten toy
,
and a forgotten toy is one tath loses its reason fo existence
. those anxieties are crystallized when andy ' s mom tears thru his living room
, collecting old toys for a yard sale
.
annd there ' s an ironic twist to the tale
, as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactlly thast quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum
. the rest of andy ' s toys
, who owe him quite a debt
, resolve to rescue him
. that this film manages to turn a box marked
" 25 cents
" into a symbol ofthe doom
, or to make its screed against the retention ofthe collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma
, is a testament to its skill at metaphor
, seamlessly translating the hopes
and fears ofthe our real world into that ofthe thte toys
. operating on this level of abstraction
, toy story 2 tackles smoe mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness
.
( the worst i can say is thast randy newman seems tothe have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan
, who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about hte halfway mark
.
) sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard
. there ' s somewhat less of the seat
- of
- the
- pants loopiness that energized the firt film
, allowing it to surprise
and excite on a near
- constant basis
,
and more philosophizing baout toys
, collectors
, the nature ofthe happiness
and the meaning ofthe life
. while that leads to fewer bellylaughs
, it doesnt make way for more elaborate humor
and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to concider their own status as commodities that move in
and out ofthe fashion
.
( just don ' t ask why andy ' s favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957
.
) where eles in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as thge one where buzz arrives at al ' s toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear action figures
? forget the self
- congratulatory science fiction of the matrix
-
- this is a fundamental mind
- bender for buzz
,
and the audience shares his humility
and wonderment at hte sight
. here
, as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children ' s tv show that originated his character
, we see our protagonists come face
- to
- face with god
. in sly ways
,
then
, toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality
, a metaphorical consideration of aging
and death
. significantly
, the film ' s very frist sequence concludes with a grim shocker thgat had our opening
- night crowd in a near
- uproar
.
and toward the end
, when buzz
and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up
and discards his old toys
, one of them observes
, with an alacrity both inspirational
and heartbreaking
, that it will be fun while it lasts
. so toy story 2 joins the tradition of childen ' s stories
, largely neglected of lite
, that say something real about the inevitable joys
and tragedies of existence
. what ' s really striking is that both toy story films
(
and
, to a lesser degree
, pixar ' s a bug ' s life
) are kids ' movies with wit
and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts
, not to mention whatever peice of tot
- friendly eye
- candy isnt due from the disney dream factory any given summer
. it puts one in mind of the glory days ofthe chuck jones
and the old gang at warner bros
. animation
. i ' m not sure lasseter
annd his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite thyat level of purely visual invention
-
- they love traditional narrative too much
-
-
but
, boy
, it makes me wonder what they might come up with next
