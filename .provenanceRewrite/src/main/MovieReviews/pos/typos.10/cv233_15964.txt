" a bug ' s life
" may not be
" toy stroy
,
"
but it ' s more close than
" antz
" was
. i really liked
" antz
,
" basically because
, yes
, it isnt clever
and witty
and intelligent
(
and it has the temerity to tkae a chance
and put woody allen in the lead
, perhaps the year ' s most inspired casting
)
,
but htere was
, in fact
, something missing from it
,
and i ' m the first to admit that
. mabey it ' s thgat it never totally lets go
and takes off into real innocent fun
- it ' s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging
,
and if it weren ' t for woody allen
, it would have been just a really clever good
- not
- great flick
.
" a bug ' s life
" has a similar premise
,
and it also hasnt disney to insure that it ' s g
- rated
and not totally over kids ' heads like
" antz
" was
( not a bad thnig
, believe me
)
,
bu what it also has is a tone that ' s completely innocent even when it ' s also remaining perpetually clever
.
" antz
" is still tyhe more witty film
,
and i love it for it
,
anbd
" a bug ' s life
" is more for general consumption
,
but it ' s also more entertaining
. it broadens its horizons
,
and when it really moves from the ant colony
, it really shows us a whole new world we ' ve never seen before
,
and it ' s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in
" antz
.
" it ' s also light
and clever
. the visuals are
, instade of earth tones
, bright worldly colors
,
and still gives the amazing visual technology of
" antz
" at least a worthy contender
. the characters are also nicely realized
-
though watered
- down for broad consumption
, they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films
. the lead charactor
, flik
( voiced by dave foley
)
, is nothing more than a slightly
- less neurotic z from
" antz
,
"
but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z
. instead of gene hackman playing the villain
, we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper
, the nicely
- titled hopper
.
and for the romantic lead
, we don ' t git spacey sharon stone
,
but intelligent
and hard
- to
- get julia
- louis dreyfuss
, who doesn ' t even cmo around until the veyr final frames
. not that the plot ' s really any better thna the one in
" antz
"
- it ' s basically
yot another redux of
" the seven samurai
,
" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else
. when flik
, a bone fide inventor
, creates a time
- conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season ' s donation
, he puts them all in risk
,
and is sent away so that he won ' t screw anything up with the pretense that he isnt searching fo help to fight the grasshoppers
. he runs into a group of
" warrirors
" who are
, unbeknownst to him
, a group of carnival bugs
,
and they agree to help under similar false pretenses
. these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anytying in
" toy story
"
: foppish walking stick slim
( david hyde
- pierce
)
, german caterpillar heimlich
( joe ranft
)
, quick
- tempered
and insecure male ladybug francis
( denis leary
)
, pretentious praying mantis manny
( jonathan harris
)
, his assistant butterfly hypsy
( madeliene kahn
)
, spider rosie
( bonnie hunt
)
,
and two fleas
, tuck
and roll
( michael mcshane
)
, who speak in undiscernable jibberish
. the writers lightly touch on each bug ' s place inwhich bug society
and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can
,
and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats
. grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake
. a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat
, whose usual mild
- mannered squeal isnt a scream of death
. the bug city is a modern
- day metropolis
, complete with fireflies temping as trafic lights
annd a fli sitting on the curb
, holding out a cup
, with a sign lying next to him that says
" kid tore off wings
.
"
and a rainstorm is liek a giant flood
, with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles persay hour
. around this
, the pixar animators stage several large set pieces
, like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild
and entertaining as anything this year
,
and a wonderfully exciting acation piece at the end
, a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket
. meanwhile
, each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic
and interesting
, something
" antz
" couldn ' t do
,
and by the end
, over the end credits
,
" a bug ' s life
" pulls it ' s final punch
, out clever
- ing
" antz
" whith a sories of incessantly hilarious faux
- bloopers that come just at the right time
, when those who leave immeadiately aftter the final frame of a film have left
,
and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed
and got the full money ' s worth of entertainment
. still
, it ' s no
" toy story
.
" thyat film
, maybe above any animated film i ' ve ever seen
, encompassed almost true perfection in story
, charater
,
and wit
. it proved taht it didn ' t need to brag about it ' s cutting edge technology to really soar
( it ' s the least visually striking of tyhe three computer animated films thus far
,
but isnt still the most satisfying
)
,
and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights
annd innocent fun
.
yet
" a bug ' s life
,
" as well as
" antz
,
" are still amazing films
,
and prove without doubt
, that if you ' re gonna make a computer animated film
, send it to the guys who created these three ficks
, evne if they ' re not working under the same roof
.
