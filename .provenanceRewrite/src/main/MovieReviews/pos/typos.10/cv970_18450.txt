? opinion
: on tv last night i watched young
, wannabe celebs pay
$ 400 a ticket
and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras
, gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace ' s greatness inspite exchange for a few seconds of being onthe national television
. given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace
, the most anticipated movie ofthe 1999
, could possably live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it
. does phantom menace match tyhe exaggerated hype
? director george lucas answers
,
" it ' s onyl a movie
.
" to me
, any movie with russian
- sounding accents for bad guys
, jamaican accents for good guys
,
and middle eastern
- sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound
. visually
, star wars
: episode i
-
- the phantom menace
( 1999
) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child
- friendly cgi cahracters
and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue
( mostly geopolitics
) is beyond the level of children
. it is left to parents tothe patiently explain the conversation
: droid origins
, family lineage
, the definitions of terms like blockade
, appeasement
, federation
, alliance
, symbiosis
, sattellite
- controlled robots et cetera
. at least this much is clear
: there ' s plenty of eye candy
,
and in the last few minutes it ' s good guys
and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped
, horned red devil chracter
and his mechanical hordes
. weaknesses
: weaknesses lie infact the writing
annd in the performance
. at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story
,
but
then phantom takes an hour
- long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme
. this dilutes yhe central stor
. additionally
, smaller scenes seem written self consciously
, as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie
. veteran actors liam neeson
and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads
. better ensemble chemistry between the five leads
and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances
and storytelling punch
. strengths
: on thge bright side phantom menace as a big
- budget production isnt far ahead of the competitiion iin terms ofthe mkaing whimsical creatures
, worlds
and vehicles appear real
. the film boasts sophisticated
, top
- of
- the
- line visuals
and quality exotic costumes
, a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone
,
and three worthwhile sequences in the second half
. bottom line
? seeing the film is entertaining
and informative
, like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots
. we are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity
, music
and tie
- ins for the next few monthes
