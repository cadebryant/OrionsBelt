hedwig
( john cameron mitchell
) was born a boy named hansel in east berlin
. as a teen seeking his
" other half
,
" he reluctantly agrees to a sex chanage operation in order to marry american g
. i
. luther
( maurice dean wint
)
. the operation
, performed by a hack surgeon
, is botched
,
and the
" angry inch
" is all that ' s left
. now a
" she
"
, hedwig comes to america
, is abandoned by luther
, forms a rock band
adn falls for her 17
- year old lover
/ prot
? g
?
, tommy
, only to be rejected by him later
, too
. she
and her band
, the angry inch
, shadows the now
- famous tommy gnosis across the us
( for revenge
?
)
,
but hedwig is raelly in search of her lost other half in
" hedwig
and the angry inch
.
" first time helmer john cameron mitchell
, along with composer
/ lyricist stephen trask
, created
and starred in their acclaimed off
- broadway production that has become the movie
.
and quite a movie it is in its eclectric variety of songs
, outrageous costumes
, sets
and makeup
and
, especially
, a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character
. mitchell
and trask haev reinvented the movie musical
and couple it withthe the underlaying stoyr ofthe just whom hedwig is
and what she is looking for
. i am
, by far
, not a big fan of musicals
. sure
, there are exceptions
, like bob fosse ' s
" all that jazz
"
and
" cabaret
,
"
but
, for the most part
, they are just not my cup of tea
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" is an exception
,
though
, with its combination of humor
, wit
and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from
" the rocky horror picture show
"
and meatloaf tothe david bowie to the sex pistols
. the original songs
, by stephen trask
( also appearing as one of the members of tje band yhe angry inch
)
, are full of energy
and variety
and
, even
though it ' s not my kind of music
, i found every one entertaining
and fun
. the audience i saw
" hedwig
" with thought so
, too
. the main attraction to this one
- man
/ woman show is the presence of its star
. john cameron mitchell gives a solid
, sometimes fun
, sometimes angry peformance as a person searching for self
- enlightenment
and love
. as a young boy growing up in east berlin
, hansel is abused by his g
. i
. father
and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that
" mother would make me play in the oven
" where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio
. later
, as a young man
, he meets luther
, another g
. i
.
and is sweeped off of his fezent
. the ensuing angry inch insident comes soon aftter
. flash forward to a trailer park in junction city
, kansas
,
anbd luther is leaving hedwig for another boy
. frustrated
and broke
, she takes on baby
- sitting
and the odd
" job
" to make ends meet
. she also forms a band wih four korean housewives
and the musical talent of hedwig is born
. she meets
, falls for
and loses young tommy
, who steals her songs
and goes off to become a rock sensation
. jealous
and angry
, hedwig
and her newyorker band begins a campaign to shadow tommy ' s tours
and
, with the help of her manager
, phyllis stein
( andrea martin
)
, is trying get a law suit going againnst the star for stealing her songs
. hedwig
and the angry inch get gigs
, not coincidentally
, at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing
. things finally come to a head
, so tothe speak
, in new york city
. the popularity of the off
- broadway musical
and its offshoots have garnered a ready
- made audience base for
" hedwig
.
" the witn
, humor
, music
and search for identity has great appeal to young adults
,
but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cutted above what it could have been
. it is this oen
- man
/ woman show that casts its spotlight on its
" internationally ignored
" rock star
and mitchell is outstanding in the role
. there isn ' t a lot going on with other characters
,
though there are amusing little sidebars
, like hedwig ' s backup singer
/ lover
, yitzak
( miriam shor
)
, deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of
" rent
" as a puerto rican drag queen
. the low budget taht the moviemakers have forthe the prodcution belies the quality of tje film
. attention to details
- hedwig ' s costumes
and outrageous
" cabaret
"
- like makeup
; the seedy trailer park setting
;
and
, the kitschy seafood restaurants
- are loads of fun to watch
and lend the appropriate air to the procedes
, all on what has to be a beer budget
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" may not be for everybody
,
but tyhe energy ofthe the effort
, the songs
, the imaginative sets
and costumes
and a fast steady pace amking it a pleasure tothe watch
. if yuo ' re a fan of contemporary
, edgy music
, it is an even bigger draw
. i give it a b
