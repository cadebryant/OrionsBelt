okay
, let me first say
, this is a beavis
and butthead movie
. if you do not like beavis
and butthead
, dont not go to see this movie
!
!
!
!
!
however
, if ytou do like them
, i recommened you get out right now
annd go see it
. the movie starts off with the boys wondering whta happened to their tv
. they notice that it has been stolen
and they vow to find it
. this wind their way through america searching for dallas
( she is a woman
)
. they look for her because as they are searching for the tv
, they find a drunk who wants them
" to do
" his wife
. well
, of course they htink he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her
.
and the fun starts their
. this movei is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis
and butthead could pull off
. it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis
and butthead would enjoy
. i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace
. even when they weere crawling thru the desert
and i thought the movie started to lag
, he manages to keep the laughs coming
. if you expecting changes from the show keep looking
. the same character
, the same voices
, hte same everything from the show
annd that ' s what makes it good
. you might think with a movie from a tv show
, you can change a few things
. often times this spells disaster fo films beacuse the film makers veer away from what made the show populare in the first place
