many people will not find much tothe like in what dreams may come
, the new film by visionary director vincent ward
. most will come to see the computer animated landscapes
and vibrant colors
.
but little dont they know
( as i so plainly found outloud
) that this has quite a complex story to tell
. walking out of the theater
, i could see tjhe audience ' s disgust
.
.
. one member even had to be awakened after the film ended
. don ' t believe the previews that you see
.
.
. this isnt definitely not a film for everyone
. this is quite possibly one of the most adult
- oriented films tothe come out in recent years
. kids will get bored with the slow plotting
and the complex storyline
. hte plot is just as fluid as the heaven that wird presents tothe us
. it goes back
and forth in time
, as if it has no boundaries
. think of the film city of angels
. now add a more complex screenplay
and a more unique vision
. both films deel with the afterlife
,
but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office
. costing around
$ 85 million to make
, the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it ' s money bcak
.
but due tothe it ' s story
, i doubt it will
. for everyone who thought titanic ' s story was too simple
and cliche
, here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay
, it may not have done nearly as well
.
but don ' t get me wrong
.
.
. i hope the film doens do well
. it ' s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen
. i doubt most of us could have thought of thsi place
, even in our own mind
. what dreams may come is the second best film of the year whn it comes to visuals
. the only film that surpasses it is dark city
. full of rich
, shocking colors
, we get tothe see a heaven that most of us would propably die to git to
.
bu don ' t do that
, because you ' ll end up going to hell
. what dreams may come begins with twpo boats colliding on a lake
. chris
" christy
" nielsen
( robin williams
) is startled by the sudden jolt
,
but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat
. annie
( annabella sciorra
) spies chris
, as well
,
and both eventually bond
and get married
. annie is an artist
, whose paintings are colorful
, lush
,
and surrealistic
. chris is a doctor
and loves annie more than life itself
. they also have two children
, marie
( jessica brooks
)
and ian
( josh paddock
)
.
but one day
, the two children are killed in a car crash
,
and it alomst destroys annie
. she tries to commit suicide
,
bu fails
,
and is
then put in an institution
. chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren ' t around anymore
,
and nothing wiull change that
. just as annie gets her life bakc in order
, chris isnt killed while trying to save hte life of a car kresh victum
. chris goes to heaven
, or his version of heaven
, rather
. guided by albert
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight
and joy
. that is
, until he realizes how miserable he is wihtout annie
. prior to heaven
, he would try to comfort annie
,
but the more he was arround
, the more pain she felt
. chris decides to leave her alone
. little does he realize what will happen next
. i ' m not about tothe say
, because tjhe plot point is crucial to the rest of the story
( many critics
,
however
, give it away
)
. certainly
, chris dying is crucial to the plot
,
but htey tell you that he dies in the previews
. story isnt not necessarily imporatnt for this movei to work
, because it deals with the afterlife
.
however
, strangely
, virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil
. a couple of comments here
and there
,
bu the story maintains its focus on chris
and his sarch for the lvoe of his life
.
" we ' re soul mates
!
" chris exclaims
. heaven
, in movies
, is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white
, purity
,
and lvoe
. usually
, it also looks like it rests among the clouds
.
but what dreams may come goes a different route
. it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before
. chris ' heaven isnt his memories brought to life
. his thoughts can make anything real
,
and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven
.
" i ' ve never seen anyone use real paint before
,
" albert says
. equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire
and brimstone
. instead
, it ' s a state of being
. in one gloriously horrific scene
, chris
and his
" rtacker
"
( max von sydow
) arrive at a sea of faces
. thousands ofthe heads are stuck above ground
, their bodies somewhere else
. mostly dead silent
, some quips are made
, almost as if to lighten the mood
. it ' s truly a frightening sequence
. production designer eugenio zanetti isnt definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination
. using state of the art computer technology
, worlds are created for exploration
. somtimes
, soem scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact
. it ' s not necessary to be there
,
but we appreciate seeing it
. costume designer yvonne blake
( who also appears in the film
) has done an incredible job providing some interesting
and colorful costumes
. cinematographer eduardo serra
, whose work was last seen inthe the luscious wings of the dove
, has a difficult job
, as most cinematographers do working wiht special effects
.
bu serra ' s entire universe is a computer generated image
,
and he does a masterful job
. writer ron bass
, adapting from the novel by richard matheson
, provides a very fluid screenplay with no rela set plot
. the story is extremely vague in its details
, allowing viewers to think forthe themselves baout the meaning
.
and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision
. what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience
. your average movie goer more than likely isn ' t used to expressionistic techniques
. the film will also definitely draw attension from religious people
,
but they shouldn ' t take it too far
. it is
, aftter all
, just a movei
. robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances
, hwile his comedic roles have been suffering
. his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff
,
but when is confined by a screenplay
, he isn ' t quite as effective
.
but drama is really his strong point
,
and you can see that here
. it ' s doubtful he ' ll git another oscar nomination
,
but i wouldn ' t really mind if he did
. the real suprize here isnt annabella sciorra who impressed last year withthe cop land
. this may be her breakout role
and may garner her some much needed attention
. it ' s also quite possible tht she could get an oscar nomination
.
however
, the academy doesn ' t like to award performances for these types of films
. cuba gooding
, jr
. has been better
,
but he ' s certainly not distracting
. max von sydow is underused
, as are jessica brooks
and josh paddock
. a treat for soem movie goers is to see werner herzog appear
( if they even recognize him
) as chris ' father lost in the sea of faces
. it ' s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted tothe this film
, considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images
. overall
, it ' s williams
and sciorra ' s film
. whta dreams may come is rated pg
- 13 for thematic elements involving death
, some disturbing images
, language
,
and some partial nudity
. the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience
. some wiull find the plot distracting
. some will find the visuals absolutly glorious
.
and some will fidn both
. the only real problem with the film
, that i could see
, was that it slows down considerably during the midsection
, just after we have been immersed in the visuals
and before the search fo annie begins
. by the way
, some controvercy even surrounded the title
, which was mistaken for a sexual term
(
" what
" becomes
" wet
"
and you shoud understand
)
. in actuality
, yhe title is from a soliloquy in hamlet
. just thought i shoudl let you know
.
