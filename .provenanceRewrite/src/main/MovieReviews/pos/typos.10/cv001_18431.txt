every now
and
then a movei comes along fomr a suspect studio
, with every indication that it will be a stinker
,
and to everybody ' s surprise
( perhaps even the studio
) the film becomes a critical darling
. mtv films '
_ election
, a high school comedy starring matthew broderick
and reese witherspoon
, is a current example
. did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened
? the plot is deceptively simple
. george washington carver high school is having student elections
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an over
- achiever with her hand raised at nearly eveyr question
, way
, way
, high
. mr
.
" m
"
( matthew broderick
)
, sick ofthe the megalomaniac student
, encourages paul
, a popular
-
but
- slow jock to run
.
and paul ' s nihilistic sister jumps iin the race as well
, for personal reasons
. the dark side of such sleeper success is that
, because expectations were so low going in
, the fact that thsi was quality stuff made teh reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be
. you can ' t help oging in with tjhe baggage of glowing reviews
, which is in contrast to the negitive baggage that the reviewers were likely to have
.
_ election
, a good film
, does not live up to its hype
. what makes
_ election
_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted direcly from
_ rushmore
_
, released a few months earlier
. the similarities are staggering
: tracy flick
(
_ election
_
) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs
,
and is involved with thge school play
. max fischer
(

. the most significant tension of
_ election
_ is tjhe potential relationship between a teacher
and his student

. tracy flick is from a single parent home

( bill murray
) pursues an extramarital affair

.
and so on
. whta happened
? how is it thast an individual screenplay
(
_ rushmore
_
)
and a novel
(
_ election
_
) contain so many signficant plot points
,
annd
yet both films were probably not even aware of each other
, made from two different studios
, from a genre
( the high school geeks revenge movie
) that hadn ' t beeen fully formed
yet
? even so
, teh strengths of
_ election
_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick
, witherspoon
,
and newcomer jessica campbell
, as paul ' s anti
- social sister
, tammy
. broderick here is playing the mr
. rooney role from
_ ferris bueller
_
,
and he seems to be hvaing the most fun he ' s had since
then
. witherspoon is a revelation
. it ' s early in the year
, it ' s a comedy
,
and teenagers have littel clout
,
but for my money
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
.
and once campbell ' s character gets going
, like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium
,
then you ' re won over
. one thing that ' s been bothering me since i ' ve seen it
. there is an extrordinary amount of sexuality in tihs film
. i suppose that
, coming from mtv films
, i should expect noone less
.
.
.
but the film starts off light
and airy
, like a sitcom
. as the screws tighten
,
and the tensions mount
, alexander payne decides to add elements that
, frankly
, distract ffrom the sotry
. it is bad enought that mr
. m doesn ' t like tracy ' s determination to win at all costs
,
but did they hvea tothe throw inaddition thte student
/ teacher relatiopnship
? even so
, there ' s noone logical reason why mr
. m has an affair wehn he does
. there ' s a lot to like inaddition
_ election
_
,
but the plot similarities to
_ rushmore
_
,
and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex
- driven
, mark this as a disappointment
.
