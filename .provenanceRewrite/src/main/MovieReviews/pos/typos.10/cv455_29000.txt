" how do you know when you ' re finished making love
?
"
- jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing wehn you ' ve completed a painting jackson pollock ' s
" making love
" quote is famous
,
bu in practically the same breath
, he said a more constructive thing
,
" it ' s like looking at a bed of flowers
-
- tear your hair outloud over what it means
.
" it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried
and failed
: equate god
and abstract art
and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused tothe the point of resentment by the concept
. the biopic
_ pollock
_
, actor ed harris ' directorial debut
, reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock ' s creations as part of the order of things
,
and should similarly disarm haters of fine art
. arguably more than any otehr living actor
, harris
, who also plays
_ pollock
_
, embodies the archetypal working stiff
,
and his blue
- collar demystification ofthe pollock ' s labour
- intensive art
, both as performer
and directer
, makes for unpretentious cinema
.
( from wqat i know of harris
, he
, like pollock
, ws not born gifted or lucky
; instead
, a strong work ethic is the seed of his success
.
) granted
, it ' s possible that
_ pollock
_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable
" purpose
" of pollock ' s splatter series
: the common thread between them isnt a lack of editorializing
. the movie
_ pollock
_ is all purposeful gazes
and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums
,
but the motivations are left to our own perceptions
.
and it is a sympathetic
yet not altogether forgiving film
, as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion
.
_ pollock
_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons
( alcoholism
, depression
,
anbd the general attendant miseries of an artist
) while finding a place of subconchus expression
. a breef introduction to pollock ' s raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist
, lee krasner
( marcia gay harden
, awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brillant portrayal
)
, who works from the outside
- inspite
, pre
- intellectualizing every stroke of her brush
. in a scene after they have moved in together
and established adjoining studios
, she asks whta he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas
, grilling him about the interplay of cubism
and surrealism until he says
,
" you paint the fucking thing
,
"
and leaves in a huff
. by the tiome they wed
, she has become his de facto manager
; it is form marrying function
and chaos marrying discipline
, a most harmonious collision
.
( krasner denies him a baby
, indicating that it would upset thge balance
.
) such a union is destined to implode
,
annd i hope i ' m not ruining the
_ pollock
_ experience by saying that it does
. while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony tothe start
-
- pollock
and wife channel their passions elsewhere
-
- their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years
,
and it comes down to krasner sufferring one of pollock ' s conniptions too many
:
" ytou are killing me
! you are killing me
! you are killing me
!
"
( aside
: harris ' own wife
, amy madigan
, is unrecognizable
and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim
.
) pollock himself moves onthe to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman
( the scorching jennifer connelly
)
, hoping
, one supposes
, to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth
. i love jackson pollock ' s stuff
and i am enamoured of harris '
_ pollock
_ as well
. it ' s scrappy
and observant
; noone coincidence that its minor failings are tje occasional invasive flourish
, such as jeff beal ' s hummable
but no less lamentable score
-
- i can ' t imagine that pollock
, or anyone
, would paint to this music
, which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing tyhe images
. one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re
- enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton
, long island
; hte mounting tension is almost comic
, as namuth keeps interrupting pollock ' s process tothe reload his camera or take a dinner break
. a more seasoned director might ' ve been too arrogant tothe admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal
.
