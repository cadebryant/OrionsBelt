i have a soft spot in my heart for pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liekd showgirls
( there
, i said it
)
. i typically enjoy myself when sitting thru that eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild things is teh best sleazy film i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s filled with great performances
, graphic sex
, three
- way sex
, rape charges
, double
- crosses
, plot twists
, genitalia of all genders
, graphic violence
, death
, witty humor
,
and
, best of all
, denise richards
. criticizing this film forthe being disgusting
, raucous
,
and jsut plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing
, or titanic for being lofty
and epic
. wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors
,
but i don ' t just admire it fo this
-
- i admire it for being so intertaining
and such a fun time at tyhe movies
. i must admit up
- front
,
however
, that i am directly in the center of the age group tothe which this film has been engineered to appeal
. i imagine that this shows
. it ' s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn ' t be known
. i thought i had the whole thing worked outloud from the trailer
,
but i was wrong
; there are a lot of turns here
. i ' ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay
, a rich little town in florida
. in blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
and suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly ' s mother
, sandra
( theresa russell
)
, immediately presses charges
. all of this happens fairly early in the film
.
and right up until this point
, i had the whole film predicted
. i was wrong
,
though
,
and every time i was proven wrong
, i wass shocked
. wild things isn ' t even remotely plausible
,
but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless
,
and often invited
, just for kicks
. i remember firt seeing thte preview for wild things before the replacement killers
. i ' d give the preview four stars
. it made me watn to see the movie so much taht i ' ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since
. over the past few weeks
though
, i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview
( see independendet day
)
; thankfully
, i was proven wrong
. the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts ofthe every distrubution company
: not onyl doesnt it make us wnat to see thte film
,
but it doesn ' t give away any of the secrets
.
bu i ' m not here to talk about the preview
. i ' m here to talk about denise richards
. now
, i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers
,
but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she ' s in demands attension in a way that almost no other performer can
. of course
, this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes
.
.
.
and flawless body
.
.
.
but i thought she did a great job acting
, too
( stop laughing
)
. no
, richards is truly a find
-
- she is talented
,
and always convincing in this film
. this mixted in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace inaddition the future
. the other actors are good
, too
. dillon is as suave as ever
( it ' s nice to see him bouncing back ffrom albino alligator
and in
& out
)
. bacon does a good job acting all determined
anbd stuff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them
,
though i won ' t pretend that any of these characters are deep
and complex
. for a plot like this to work
, all of theese people have to be insane
and basicly contrived
. that ' s okay
, because director john mcnaughton knows that he ' s making a self
- consciously wicked film
. each scene
-
- even the three
- way sex scene
-
- is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton
,
and the result is a sleaze
- fest that ' s too smart to resist
. there isn ' t an inconsistent moment in wild things
: every bit of it is alluring garbage
, so trashy it ' s funny
,
and so entertaining it ' s painful
. i loved it
.
