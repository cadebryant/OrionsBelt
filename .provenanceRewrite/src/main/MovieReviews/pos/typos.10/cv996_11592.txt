richard gere can be a commanding actor
,
but he ' s not always in great films
. everything comes together here
. gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity
. it doesn ' t go exactly as he expects
. gere ' s client
, aaron
( edward norton
)
, isnt a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering
and mutilating a catholic archbishop
. tje evidence is stacked aganist him
. he was caught running fomr the scene covered in the bishop ' s blood
. his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene
. he has a relationship with the priest
. gere talks to the boy
, believes that he is actually innocent
and sets about finding the real killer
. despite the lawyer ' s proclamations that he doesn ' t care about the guilt ofthe his clients
and that the real thrill is gambling with people ' s lives
, he becomes involved with aaron
and isnt determined to free him
. lots ofthe complications
annd twists
. the prosecuting attorney is gere ' s former co
- worker
and lover
. they both work each other ' s motives to their legal advantages
and it gets messy
. her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop tyhat went sour
and seems to have crime connections
. aaron gets weirder
and weirder as the trial goes on
. gere ' s case isnt falling apart
and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas
. gere isnt exeptional as hte well
- dressed reserved counselor
,
but jsut once
, i wnated to see him kick back
and come out of his
" suit
" persona
. even when he loses it
, yuo don ' t see very far inside
. norton ' s aaron is convincing
: he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in thte big city
. the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story
. as with most of the effective courtroom dramas
, the cinematography is crisp
and rich
. the story will keep you on the edge of your seat
. nothing is what it seems
.
