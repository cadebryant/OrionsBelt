. review
: one memorable aspect ofthe disney ' s
" aladdin
" wass that it finally gave robin williams a character
-
- the genie
-
- to best take advantage of his comic talents
.
" shrek
" does the same for eddie murphy
; ironically
,
though
, murphy ' s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass
. all tjhe same
,
" shrek
" does represent murphy ' s best comic outing infront years
,
and as donkey he steals all the best lines
. for instance
, after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature
, donkey soars into tjhe air
and scoffs
,
" now i ' m a flying talking donkey
!
"
and despite its many contributors
, the script fo
" shrek
" is full of such comic gems
. myers is delightful in more of a straight man role
,
and lithgow alsot gets some great moments
( watch for a hillarious repartee with the gingerbread man
)
.
" shrek
" tkaes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales
and nursery rhymes of all sorts
,
and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain
. things do go somewhat astray during the film ' s middle segment
, which concentrates too much on thte main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which isnt the movie ' s greatest strength
.
but even
then
, one can always sit bcak
and enjoy the beautiful computer animation
, whose remarkable use here represents
yet anyother dazzling leap forward for thge technology
.
