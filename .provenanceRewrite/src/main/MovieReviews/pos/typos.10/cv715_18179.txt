bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review
: i must admit
, no doubt ' s single
" new
" is quite catchy
. it was bouncy
and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon
, the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back
. the result
? a movie that ' s just as good as that song
, really
. it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend
. first we hear about a grocery bagger
( sara polley
) who runs into a monetary situation problem
and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave
( with bad results
, as a drug dealer feels he ' s been swindled by her
)
;
hten comes tje story ofthe an english groshury store worker
( same store
) who heads to vegas for the weekend with firends
, where sex
, gunplay
,
and stolen car trouble come into play
;
then we see the story of two gay movie actors
( played by scott wolf
and jay mohr
) who deal with a cop ' s strange insurance presentation
and hitting a girl
( sara
) with their car
;
and
, finally
, we come to another grocery worker
( katie holmes
) who has a stange fascination wiht said drug dealer
( the one mentioned earlier
)
. really
, it ' s all confusing to keep track of iin review format
, your best bet is to just
, well
, go
. the movie features some very good acting from all angles
,
and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product
. the dialogue is pretty snappy
and the resolution is pretty well realized
, not going for thge sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending
. think of it as a
, well
, ending
. the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie
, as it ' s never really confusing
and tells different sides of the story
, like sliding doors kinda did
.
however
, it ' s better suited for tghe younger generation who want a little spice in their ficks
, which sliding doors kinda isn ' t
.
