shakespeare
. you hardly understood it in high school
. why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn ' t count on it
? if this is your attitude
,
then i ' ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh ' s hamlet is probably not for ytou
,
and you might as well stop reading right now
. if
,
however
, ytou are a lover of the bard
, or at the very least are open
- minded about a challenging script
, read onthe
, for there is something rotten in tje state of denmark
. namely
, the king has died
,
and his widow the queen hasnt wed the king ' s brother
, claudius
,
but prince hamlet suspects foul play
. his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears
and relates teh story of his murder at his own brother ' s hands
. hamlet
, enlisting the help ofthe his friend horatio
, conspires to capture tje conscience of the new king to expose his treachery
.
.
.
.
and the game is afoot
.
.
.
. the first things you notice about this production are the sets
and costumes
. with exerternal scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england
( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers
)
, tyhe grandiose quality of the setting isnt immediately estalbished
. interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate
and flamboyant rooms
and chambers
. the hamlet castle ' s grand throne room isnt an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings
, mirror
- panal doors
,
and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second
- story loft
. costuming isnt equally grand
, drawing upon both history
and imagination
.
. not quite the denmark of the 1600 ' s
, the characters ' attire is something of a cross between that era
and turn of the centruy russia
, vyre effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel
. it isnt not surprising that tim harvey
and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction
and best costume design oscars
, respectively
. in addition to directing
, kenneth branagh also plays the title character
. as the revenge
- driven royal heir
, branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs
and lows
. from the anticipation of seeing his father ' s ghost
, to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester
, to his eventual wrath
, branagh delivers in spades
. every scene truly revolves around hamlet
, as much a tribute to branagh ' s acting
and directing as to shakespeare ' s manuscript
. hamlet seems to be a who ' s who of shakespearean
- trained actors
, so watching them perform hte craft for which htey have much love is a delight in itself
. julie christie
, as hamlet ' s mother gertrude
,
and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly
, as do many of the supporting players
. kate winslet as hamlet ' s lover ophelia
, does an outstanding job demonstrating the character ' s plummet to the depths ofthe dispair
and madness
. richard briers as ophelia ' s father
, polonius
,
and michael moloney as her brother
, laertes
, are equally convincing
. nicholas farrell as hamlet ' s trusted friend horatio
,
and timothy spall
and reece dinsdale as the two
- timing rosencrantz
and guildenstern round out the excellent core casted
. hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to tsuff as many well known actors as possible
. in some cases
, this made for interesting scenes
. billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick
, whom hamlet knew quite well
. crystal proves himself able to deliver tghe lines with both the timing of a classic ctor
and the verbal countenance of a comedian
,
and the result is a very funny scene
.
however
, charleton heston
, whom many might think would butcher shakespeare
, is the biggest surprise ofthe all
. as thge player king
, the leader of a troupe of traveling actors
, he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam
and hecuba
. part ofthe his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story
( with sir john gielgud
and judi dench
)
,
but this is most unfortunate
, for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time
. his off
- camera speaking
, while gripping
, sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well
- voiced acto
. i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out
,
annd let the venerable actor have tghe attention
. unfortunately
, there were smoe casting choices which led to poor distractions
. jack lemmon
, an excellent actor
, just can ' t do shakespeare
. as marcellus
, the guard who sees the elder hamlet ' s ghost
, lemmon sadly underperforms
and is shown up left
and right by those around him
. gerard depardieu
, another talented actor
, is wasted when given little more than tghe utterances of
" yes
, my lord
"
and
" no
, my lord
" in the role of reynaldo
. richard attenborough has a
( literally
) walk
- on role
, showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador
. i think he had two lines
.
then there isnt rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway
. when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year
, two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he ws
. if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome
, well i guess comic actor marty feldman ws some kind ofthe sex symbol to ytou
. hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery
and revenge in wich triumph
and defeat become one
. branagh attempts to help us out with some of teh intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback
- type images
. this only works about half the time
,
and i wonder if it would haev been just as well to do without them
. you don ' t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare
,
but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully
and repeatedly
. the alternate method of comprehension is thast with which most of us are familiar
, the high school english course
. in it
, you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with tjhe plot points
and nuances essential to understanding a play writed in hte rigmarole known as the king ' s english
. or i suppose you could just read teh cliff notes
.
