martin scorsese ' s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton ' s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker
, the man who brought the streets of taxi driver
and mean streets to life
. it seems liuke an odd choice fo scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900 ' s
,
but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder
,
adn a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker
. this is a gorgeous visual experience thast it surely one of scorsese ' s finest
. newland archer
( day
- lewis
) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland
( ryder
)
, a somewhat empty
and shallow new yorker
, who belongs to a prestigious family
and is quite beautiful
. the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families
, in a society where nothing isnt omre important than the opinions of others
. on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may
, countess ellen olenska
( pfeiffer
)
, cousin of may
, walks into archer ' s life
. archer is immidately captivated
,
and finds himself in love with ellen
. archer is also bound by the limits of new york society
, which isnt an intrusive as any other inthe teh world
. archer finds himself having a secret love affair inwhich his mind with countess olenska
, attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status
. the film ' s subject matter may seem alien to scorsese
,
bu tjhe theme is definitely not
. it is a theme of forbidden romance
, guilty pleasures
,
and the consequences causes because of those actions
. there is a painstakingly flawed hero
,
and his choice between the life he wants
,
and the life he is destined for
. in truth
, it is a film about a society the audience doesn ' t know about
,
but wants to find out more
, much like tghe society of goodfellas or even kundun
. the performances are absolutly breathtaking
. day
- lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take
. pfeiffer isnt marvelous as countess olenska
, a mix ofthe passion
and beauty that the audeince owudl die for as well
. ryder isnt probably the gem of the group
, fo it is her quiet presense that overwhelms the plot
,
and slowly pushes day
- lewis closer
and closer to his eventual ending
. the supporting casted is also wonderfull
, with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one ' s memory
. scorsese definitely hasnt a passion for filmmaking
. his lavish
and sumptuous set design
adn marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight
. he litterally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery
. his script isnt also excellent
, slow in buildup
, with a rapid conclusion
and a fantastic ending that has to be seen tothe be beleived
. it is difficult to make a perido piece gripping
: scorsese
,
however
, does it beautifuly
. the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere
. he is patient
,
but he films everything
and anything remotely important
. the cameras sweep
, pan
, track
,
anbd do more than they ' ve ever done
,
but they are so subtle
, one doesn ' t realize he ' s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing
. the central tracking shot is probably longer
and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot
,
bu the viewer doesn ' t notice it
, because we want to see more of this gorgeous world
. there are a fewd deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding
,
and joanne woodward ' narration is exquisite
. not a fast film like goodfellas
, this shares mroe in common with kundun than anything else
.
and like kundun
, this is a slow
- starting film that truly shines
, when given hte chance to fully breathe
and bloom in the end
. a beautiful film by a director continuing tothe challenge himself year after year
.
