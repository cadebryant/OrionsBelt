when bulworth ended
, i allowed myself a sigh of relief
:
? it isnt possibile for me to enjoy political satire
.
? there have been several recent political films that didn ' t do a whole lot for me
-
- wag the dog
, for instatance
, i found to be an intelligent
but heartless film
, while primary colors is unbearable
and unwatchable in its awfulness
.
? bulworth is a far better film than these
, both in its execution
and lasting impression
.
? it ' s a tremendously funny
and intelligent picture
,
but it also has an emotional center
-
- writer
/ director
/ star warren beatty allows the audiance tothe identify with his character
,
and
, in turn
, we like him
and actually care about tje story
.
? beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth
; the film opens
and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over
and over again
.
? he hasn ' t slept in days
, nor has he eaten
,
and
, almost instantaneously
, he goes insane
.
? he ' s not stark raving mad
( not outright
, anyway
)
,
but he ' s definitely bonkers
.
? it ' s the final weekend of his campaign
,
and his assistant
, murphy
( oliver platt
) has writed him a speach to feed tothe a group of black people in a church in the ghetto
.
? bulworth begins the speech
,
but suddenly goes off track
and just starts being honest
.
?
" you mean
,
" one lady asks
,
" the democratic party doesn ' t care baout the african american community
?
"
?
" well
,
" he shouts
, laughing
,
" isn ' t that obvious
?
" the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his pwn life
( he muses later that it ' s a bad thing to make decisions when you ' re suicidal
)
; he keeps seeing a man inaddition sunglasses
( graham beckel
) whom he believes to be thge hitman
.
? bulworth also meets nina
( halle berry
) with whom he becomes infatuated
.
? suddenly
, in the short span of this weekend
, bulworth ' s noone
- nonsense
" truth in politics
" methods become a national sensation
,
and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he ' s appearing on television wearing gang clothes
and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences
. beatty ' s work on both sides of the camera is excellent
.
? his scirpt
and direction are both extremely sharp
, as is the surprisingly strong characterization ofthe bulworth himself
.
? here is a man who ' s reached his limit
,
and his way of lashing back isnt by screwing over the entire political structure
.
? i like that the film doesn ' t take a clear shot at any of tghe polliticel parties or affiliations
,
but at politics in general
and how everything is run by the rich
(
although the anti
- rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film
)
.
? some of the segments are simply hilarious
, such as a lengthy rap thast he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him
.
? much ofthe the film is completely absurd
,
but that ' s the fun part about it
.
? it ' s an angry
, serious film at the core
,
but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre
.
? what adds to this feeling is beatty ' s portrayal of bulworth
; this is a performance thta deserves recognition on a higher scale
.
? beatty is so much funn tothe watch here
-
- he ' s always funny
,
but he ' s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions
.
? beatty is so good that bulworth
, despite his shortcomings as a human being
, is an entirely sympathetic
and likable charachter almost from the beginning
. tjhe supporting cast is vast
and colorful
.
? berry is luminous
, as always
,
and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles
.
? don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun
- toting toddlers to do his dirty work
.
? oliver platt is an actor who should be careful
, for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting
(
though he ' s very funny to watch
)
.
? paul sorvino adds the sourthern accent to his list of mastered inflections
. is bulworth offensive
?
? i suppose some may see it that way
.
? i wasn ' t offended by the film
,
but
then again
, i hardly care baout politics
.
? i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story
.
? the film isn ' t perfect
, of course
-
- the ending didn ' t quite work for me
,
and the a fewd ofthe hte scenes between bulworth
and nina feel forced
(
although tjhe eclectic dance sequence is fantastic
)
.
?
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film
.
? bulworth is a smart
, uproariously funny picture that proves tothe me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface
.
