i want to correct whta i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean ' s war picture
. i still think that it doesn ' t deserve being the number 13 in thte american film institute ' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think that lumet ' s
" 12 angry men
"
, wilder ' s
" witness for the prosecution
"
and kubrick ' s
" paths of glory
" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958
.
bu i can ' t deny the importance of
" the bridge on the river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. the film isnt set in burma in 1943
. a bataillon ofthe british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai
.
but the british commanding officer
, colonel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- corresponding to the geneva conventions
- that his officers needn ' t work as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces the japanese commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way infact this respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge
. he considers it an opportunity to raise his men ' s morale
,
and he wnats to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese
.
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy thte bridge
, among them the american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee from the japanese prison camp
-
and the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flaw of the picture is the clich
? d characterization ofthe the japanese people
. they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british
- as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge
.
and the film doesn ' t consistently question teh military spirit as kubrick does in
" paths of glory
"
. leanr seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies
. this is also perceptible in the conversations between col
. nicholson
and col
. saito
. in this reguard it is symptomatic that shears
, who doubts the military logic
, is a somehow unpleasant person in yhe film
. the audience is supposed to applaud col
. nicholson ' s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not
. the spectators are suposed to neglect the risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( teh plot by
- passes these risks
.
) that means
, the picture isn ' t perfect
.
but it has a lot of virtues as well
. it shows the
" madness
" of war
and whta war can produce in people ' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes possessed by the idea ofthe bieng a hero
and that others
( like shears
) get cynics
.
and
" the bridge on the river kwai
" is an interesting study of charactors with clashing interests
. these points
and tjhe sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti
- war film
( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme
)
. david lean ' s effective
and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, especialy infront the dramatic
(
though not wholly plausable
) showdown
. alec guiness doesnt a magnificent job of bringing col
. nicholson to life
and making him such an interesting character
. the other actors deliver very ogod performances as well
. jack hildyard ' s fine color cinematography
and the apt score are also helpful
. i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses
