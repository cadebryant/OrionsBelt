a movie that ' s been as highly built up as the truman show
, with reviews boasting
,
" the film of the decade
!
"
annd
" a breakthrough
!
" can only be leading up to letdown
. that ' s no dout
-
- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makse you think you ' re going in for the ride of your life
, that you ' ll end up changed on the other side
,
and you come out of the theater going
,
" eh
.
.
.
* that ' s
* what all tje fuss was about
?
" so
, naturally
, the truman show was building up to what was goign to be a dissapointment
.
and i convinced myself
, as i nestled into my uncomfortable movei theater chair
, actualyl to try not to enjoy it
. let me tell yuo
, that is an impossibilty
. the truman show is truly
" the film of the decade
"
and
" a breakthrough
"
and more
.
and you will come out changed on the other side
. such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime
, where you find yourself feeling everything that the character isnt feeling
,
adn this
, friends
, is it
. jim carrey shows that he doesn ' t need to talk out of his butt to entertain us
; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood ' s leading men
. the film has a difficult premise to tackle
, trying to set us up thirty years into the
" truman show ' s
" run
,
but tackle it it does
,
and perfectly
. with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show
, you git the sense that you are viewing a
* rela
* prime
- time hit
.
and tyhe way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in teh
" real
" truman show isnt clever
and well
- done
. people
, rejoice
! thsi is the firt oscar
- worthy film of not only this year
,
but of the last five years
. not since
" schindler ' s list
" has a movie captured human spirit
and true despair so well
. this isnt a classic in the making
,
and
( to borrow a line from esquire ' s review
) it stars jim carrey
. nothing in his career to date
and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able tothe top his role as truman burbank
; mark my word
. for
, as i said
, this is the movei ofthe a liftime
and the role is of the same calibre
. forget special
- effect ladden summer fodder
. drop your romantic comedies in the trash
. toss your thrillers
and teen flicks on the pile
. you need nothing more than
" the truman show
" to carry you through the summer
, or for that matter
, the year
. oh
!
adn in case i don ' t see ytou
, good afternoon
, good evening
,
and goodnight
.
