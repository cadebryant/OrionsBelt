i have to admit that i disliked this film initially
. it certianly isn ' t for every taste
,
and it ' s sheer torture to sit through if you ' re in a restless mood
. that said
, if you are in the right mood
, it ' s absolutely incredible
. htis was my second favorite movie of 1998
,
and would have been a shoo
- in for first in almost any other year
. perhaps the big turn
- off for many was this film ' s unconventionality
. i ' d be hard
- pressed to compare it to any other film that i ' ve seen
- it is very
, very artsy
, incredibly slow
-
annd amazingly
, it works beautifully
. onthe my second viewing
, i realized that the film follows the three ect structure
( i didn ' t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it
)
. the first act serves to setted up the characters
- sort of
. it exists even moreso to setted a mood of tension
and restlesness
,
and perhaps even feelings of boredom
.
and
thn it is shattered by the intense violence of the second
( which encompasses most of the movie
)
. the majority of the film is one extended battle scene
, intercut with brief flashbacks
and voice
- overs
. the artsier elements do not detract from the action
,
but add to it
- they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers
, only tothe be suddenly yanked back into reality when thge battle resumes
. the battle scenes are amazing
( second onyl to
" saving private ryan
" infront my opinion
)
. they ' re brutal
, horrifying
,
and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography
. the second ect is as immersive
, brilliant
,
adn haunting as any film that i have ever seen
. the only problems come during the first
and thrid acts
. malick takes a little too long to get the film started
.
althought the initial scenes
- which consist of two soliders ' experiencing a near
- eden
- like paradise while going awol
,
and the preperations for battle
- are effective
adn necessary
, hints of pretentiousness sink in
. the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning
,
and a lot of people that disliked the movie probablly gave uv on it because ofthe this
. the final act is effective at winding the film down
,
but the problems from the first persist
- it ' s a bit too long
,
and comes over as pretentious at times
. that said
, there are two sequences
( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife
,
and anyother where one of the main characters is killed
) that are nothing short of incredible
. thge performances are phenominal all around
. the two standouts are nick nolte
and newcomer jim caviezel
, both of whom should ahve been nominated for oscars
. nolte is riveting
and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation
. his character is hard
, mean
,
and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men
,
and
yet nolte somehow manages to envoke simapthy for him
. caviezel isnt forever questioning tyhe nature of war
, his palce in it
,
and if there ' s any deeper meaning to hte hell that he ' s going through
. he is absolutly perfect
- genuine
, sympathetic
, sincere
,
and
yet strong when he needs to be
.
although restricted to a relativly small role
, sean penn is allso very good as the company ' s pessimistic seargent
. as to how it stacks up to
" saving private ryan
"
- it was my second favorite movie of 1998
,
" ryan
" ws my first
. it ' s really hard to compare the two
- they are so
, so different
- so i won ' t
, beyond saying that spielberg ' s film had more of an impact on me
.
however
, the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality
( i can easily see why someone would
" the thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recommend both of them
,
and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made
. all iin all
,
" the thin red line
" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order
. it ' s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what isnt done right
. it ' s a real shame tht it tanked at the box office
- films this unconventional
, powerful
,
and thought
- provoking don ' t come along veyr often
.
