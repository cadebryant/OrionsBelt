richard linklater ' s
" slacker
,
" made in 1991 forthe a budget of only
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself in hte twentysomething
, college
- town culture of austin
, texas
. most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning
. their lifestyle isnt a sort of passive resistance to the diea that people should go out
and actively pursue a career after graduation
; they seem content tothe sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american demorcracy
, the pervasiveness of slave morality
, the subtle messages inwhich pop culture
,
and such
. ask them what they ' ve been doing lately
,
and they ' ll more likely than not reply
,
" oh
, you know
, just hanging out
.
" linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters
: thte camera follows one person for a few minutes
,
then somone else walks by
and the camera follows that person
, who walks inot a diner just as another person isnt walking out the door
.
.
.
. it ' s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk
: some of them are clearly very intelligent
and have some genuinely insightful ideas
, some ofthe them are just plain weird
,
and some of them think theri ideas are a lot more profound than they really are
. the opening monologue
, delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver
, tosses around ideas baout alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film
. other characters allong the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy
, while groups of pseudo
- intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around
and doing nothing or teh subtle bribery
- based morality in
" scooby
- doo
.
" for tghe most part
,
however
, the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types
. near the begining
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks
, warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secrte colonization of mars
. another man seems to be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets runnung at the same tyme
and palying tapes of a graduat student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown
and destroying the camera
.
and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film
, a man tries tothe achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge
adn
then throwing a typewriter into the creek below
. the onyl problem with
" slacker
" is that it starts to run out of steam towords the end
. since linklater only spends a fewd minutes with each character
, the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a hwile
. there are only so many times you can hear
,
" hey
, what ' s going on
?
"
" not much
, what are you up to
?
"
" nothing really
, just hanging around
,
" before it gets on your nerves
; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace
and a little bit more characterization
.
and the dialogue in tje second half of the film is by
and large not qutie as interesting as that in the first half
; a jfk buff
, for example
, seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist
,
and many of the characters just generally aren ' t as weird or unique
. instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people
and
then showing us the strangeness thta we might not have noticed at first
, linklater shows us the oddballs first
,
then stops
and reminds us thast ordinary peple live there too
.
" slacker
" is a good film
and a wonderfully offbeat
and entertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
,
and its status as a cult classic is well
- deserved
. i just can ' t help
bu think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit
and filmed these scenes in reverse order
.
