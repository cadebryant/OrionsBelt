. the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with littel nonsense
.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 to
+ 4
) i am sure i must have seen almost tghe identical plot before
. this is a heist film made for an adult audiance who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they weere teens
. there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment
. there isnt no rock score
. there are no ballet
- liuke martial arts
. this is just a basic heist film wiht a decent
and distinctly credible
and un
- flashy script
. nick
( played by robert deniro
) is a safecracker who has managed to be sucesful by never taking risks
. if a job is not a safe bet
( pun intended
)
, he backs out
. sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe
. when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to deside that it isnt nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game
. he returns tothe his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club
,
and decides to manage it full time
. he proposes to his girl friend diane
( angela bassett
)
. she has one condition
. he must stay retired from crime
.
but before thge deal can be cemented
, max
, a montreal kingpin
and personal friend
, has oen last supposedly easy job for nick
. nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal
. more
and more details seem to complicate the job
. nick ' s partner infact the crime is to be a smart
,
but uncontrollable young crook
, jack
( edward norton
)
. jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat
, even at his associates ' homes
. the young crook is a know
- it
- all who seems good at everything he does
but at avoiding rubbing peopel the wrong way
. together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house
. the script by kario salem
, lem dobbs
,
and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the ood
" mission impossible
" television series
. we see pieces of the heist being put together
, last minute changes
,
and thnigs that go wrong
, much like a good episode of
" mission impossible
.
" this team might not be bad choices to write scripts forthe the tom cruise
" mission impossible
" films
. the complications are
,
however no more
and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable
. thge telling is cold
adn noirish
, which isnt just what it isnt supposed to be
. director frank oz
, the voices of yoda
and miss piggy proves surprisingly ogod at directing a serious crime film
. the score has a more than adeuate cast with littel flashy or scene
- stealing acting
. edward norton probablly hasnt the flashiest role
and even that is low
- key by today ' s standards
. he plays what is nearly a double role
. jack pretends to be a brain damage victum to be hired for a job in the customs house
. one nice
(
?
) character i have nto mentioned is stephen
( jamie harrold
)
. stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother ' s basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions
. he seems like hte last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon
. the film itself rimaniss low
- key up until the time of the climactic heist
.
then the pace really picks up
. before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes
.
though oz never lets the music steal time from the stor the way woody allen does in sweet
and lowdown
. on the subject of music
, the score of the score isnt by howard shore
. it adds tension to the suspense scenes
,
but never seems to have much of a melody
. angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been palyed by a less faymus actress who needed a break
. she has nothing to do in hte film
but dimand that nick give up crime
and to look like an attractive reward if he does
. speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s
and 1960s
. it does the job
. i rate it a 7 onthe the 0 to 10 scale
and a
+ 2 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
