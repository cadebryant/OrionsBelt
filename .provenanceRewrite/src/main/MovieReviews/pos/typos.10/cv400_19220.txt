the happy bastard ' s 30
- second review
: american py the summer of raunch continues to spreaded into theatres with this latest yuk fest
, filled with sick jokes
and teen dialogue aplenty
. if you go expecting dawson ' s creek
, you ' re in for a problem
. if your expectations are lower
(
and better
, i might add
)
, you will enjoy the hell out of american pie
. the movie casts several unknowns
, with the only real recognizable one being sctv ' s pwn eugene levy as a happy
- go
- lucky dad
. the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one gool before the school year gets out
- get laid
. that ' s pretty much it
. throughout the movie
, little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout
, including a memorable scene involving an apple pie
( i won ' t give it away
,
but yuo probably nkwo what it is
)
and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry
. of course
, the movie has soem slightly sentimental bits
,
but they don ' t drag the movie ' s humor content down that bad
. most of the actors get their job done
,
but it ' s levy who ' s a hoot
, a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the halp of some curious
" visual aids
"
. i couldn ' t stpo laughing during this movie
,
and if you can stand all the raunch
and the sex references
,
then american pie is for ytou
. if you ' re one ofthe those
" conservative
" types
, well
, i ' ll bet you ' re having fun at home while this
, south park
,
and austin powers ii plays in theatres
, now aren ' t ytou
