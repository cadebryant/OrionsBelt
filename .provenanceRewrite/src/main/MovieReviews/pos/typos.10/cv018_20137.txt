having nto seen
,
" who framed roger rabbit
" in over 10 years
,
and not remembering much besides that i liked it
then
, i decided to rent it recently
. watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it isnt
. asside from the fact tath it ' s a milestone in animation in movies
( it ' s the first film to combine real actors
and cartoon characters
, have them interact
,
anbd make it convincingly rela
)
and a great entertainment it ' s also quite an effective comedy
/ mistery
. while tjhe plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original
, especially baby herman
,
and watching them together is a lot of fun
. the story begins in hollywood in 1947
. cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes
adn having trouble keeping his mind on work
, so hard
- boiled private detective eddie valient
( bob hoskins
) is called in by studio head r
. k
. maroon
( alan tilvern
) to try to help get roger ' s mind bakc on work
. maroon thinks that roger ' s wife
, jessica ' s
, possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction
and tells eddie to get some photos ofthe her in the ect befoer it costs him any more money in reshoots
. valiant takes some photos ofthe jessica playing
,
` patty cake ' with marvin acme
( stubby kaye
)
, the owner of toontown
( where all of the ctaroon characters live
)
and takes them to maroon
. upon seeing them
, roger is emotionally destroyed
and soon after acme is found dead
and roger rabbit is the prime suspect
. the rest of the movie follows valiant
and roger as they run around town
(
and eventually toontown
) trying to clear roger ' s good name
. along the way they meet judge doom
( christopher lloyd
) a judge

anbd creation of the cartoon characters
( williams
and his teams went through the film frame by frame
anbd hand drew the cartoon charactors in
)
. director robert zemekis must be given an equal ammount of praise for overseeing the entire production
, which included hundreds of animators
. also bob hoskins ' performance should be credited
. he
, in addition to thge rest of the human cast
, finds the right onot to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co
