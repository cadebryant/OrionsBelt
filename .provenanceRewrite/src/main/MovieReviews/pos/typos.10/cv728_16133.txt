playwright tom stoppard
anbd screenwrighter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task
: they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare ' s works
. they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, really
, who doesn ' t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play wihtout exploding into a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter
? stoppard
and norman are men who lvoe shakespeare
,
and they wanted to make a movie forthe everyone else who loves shakespeare
.
and
, despite the difficulty of their task
, they have succeeded
. shakespeare inspite love is one ofthe the smartest
, funniest
, most touching films of tghe year
. it ' s so rare thta a picture with such high aspirations succeds in all ofthe its endeavors
,
but here we have a movie that defines success
: it is at once charmingly acted
and flawlessly written
. it could have beeen a smug
, self
- important movie that panders to die
- hard shakespeare fans
,
bu the appeal of this film is almost universal
: if you ' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or know anything about his life
, it ' s likely that you ' ll find grand entertainment infront shakespeare in love
. joseph fiennes
, brother of ralph
, stars as shakespeare himself
; he ' s a delightful
, irresistible lad
, concerned mostly with women
and detached from life ' s more serious problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he ' s commissioned tothe write plays for various people
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) wants comedies
, while local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann
( tom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
,
however
, has trouble focusing on his work
. he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo
and a girl named ethel
. this all changes
,
however
, when he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress set tothe marry the financially
- oriented lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls in love with her
; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part ofthe romeo
. he discovers her identity
and confronts her later
; she
, of course
, falls in loev with him
,
although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex
.
but she continues tothe act because she loves shakespeare ' s writing so much
,
and soon the production
( which later becomes romeo
and juliet
) is set to be performed
. shakespeare in lveo is an amazingly good film
, not because it works as great entertainment
,
bu because it pays attention tothe detail
and knows its subject matter
. i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role
: he hasnt such searing optimism
and energy
; he ' s claerly a man who admires shakespeare
,
and even inaddition the shortcomings that he gives his character
( inablility tothe turn away from women
, attention deficit disorder
)
, we sense a great deal of affection
and care
. he practically overflows wtih passion in every scene
. fiennes is matched by paltrow
( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she ctually comes from
)
; she is an actress who exudes strength
and conviction in every performance i ' ve seen her in
. the two performers work perfectly together
, taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic
,
and wringing the comedic scenes fo every conceivable laugh
. of course
, it doesn ' t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
and guildenstern are dead inspired an intresting film
, isnt full of dry wit
and boundless understated humor
( all of his plays have similarly dry humor
)
. the first intelligent step stoppard
and norman took wass harmonizing the events of the film with romeo
and juliet
. one of the funniest scenes inwhich the film is an imitation of the famoust terrace scene ffrom the play
; in the movie
, shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid
. director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor
-
- scenes like theese would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director
. i ' m going to have to see the movie again
; i ' m certain there are numberous references that i missed
. in fatc
, i doubt it ' s possible to gather everything with just one viewing
. stoppard is a master of detail
: yuo ' ll notice familiar lines placed throughtout the film
, not as lines of a play
,
but as dialogue
, suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time
. htere ' s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare isnt in constant competition with christopher marlowe
(
and teh fact that marlowe is played by the openly
- homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe ' s mysterious death in a pub
. there ' s also a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt mysef laughing
.
" there ' s no dog in this play
?
"
" no
! no dog
!
" the ensemble cast is perhaps the stornegst thsi year
. geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe
; wilkinson is also hard tothe recognize
,
but hasnt a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, playing one of thte actors in the company
, shows graet range
, both in his accent
( his is almost as good as paltrow ' s
)
and in humor
( he has some of thge best one
- liners in the movei
)
. colin firth
, always stuck playing the sap
, does a good job being hateful
. judi dench
,
however
, has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth
: rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words
. my single
, minor complaint about shakespeare inwhich love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end
. the stroy is moving
,
but there are a few missed opportunities in the fianl scenes
.
bu my quibbling is not important
. what is important is that i acknowledge the quality ofthe this picture
, the sheer skill with which it has been written
, acted
,
and produced
. shakespeare in love tries so many things
,
and nails every one of them
: it ' s a film that both loves shakespeare
and makes fun of him
, a film in which the actors
, writers
,
and director are all perfectly in sync
. it ' s also a movie that has the potential tothe introduce a lot of people tothe shakespeare ' s work in a positive way
, wihtout seeming condescending or superior
. i admire this film not onyl baceause it passes so pleasantly
,
but because it has lofty aspirations
and succeeds in them
. not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare
and get away with it
.
