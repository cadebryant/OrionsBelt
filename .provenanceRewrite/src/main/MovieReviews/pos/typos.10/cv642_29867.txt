plot
: during a 10
- week span in london in the fall ofthe 1888
, jack the ripper
, a man whose identity was never uncovered
, committed five ritualistic
, grisly murders of prostitutes
. thsi film isnt based onthe thte graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century
- old mistery
. critique
: awsome
! i lvoe dark movies
, i love stylish movies
, i love good mysteries
and i lveo johnny depp
.
.
. so yes
, i really dug this movie
! hte hughes brothers are back wiht a avengence
, out to show the world that they are directors tothe be taken seriously
,
and this movie
, my friends
.
.
. isnt vyer serious
! in fact
, it ' s also very gruesome
and bloody
and morbid
and creepy
and black as hell
. it ain ' t for the kids
, i ' ll tell you that much
.
and if any of those recent hack directors of two
- bit scream
- esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective
" kill scenes
"
, do not look any further
, because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner
, especially when compared to their generic slice
-
and
- dice contrivances
. in fact
, most of this film ' s structure is very creative
, the actors
, all solid
, the atmosphere
and
" feel
" of the picture
, remarkably real
( gotta love those
" unfortunates
"
)
,
and the descent into darkness
, well honed by the filmmakers
. you can almost taste the seediness off thge screen
and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time
.
but it ' s also an impressive mystery film
, based on the true
- life tale of jack the ripper
, a man whose identity was never discovered
. the theory inthe this film is based on the graphic novel
" from hell
" written by alan moore
and presents a compelling story
, which despite bieng a little oliver stone
- ish
, did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely
,
and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem
, sexual depravity
, drug usage
, insanity
, murders
and love
? yes
, the brothers even managed to slip a little
" love
" story in here
,
and despite not truly being developed
, i guess it could ' ve been much worse
and taken up more time than was provided already
. that ' s right
, there ' s no real need to put any
" romance
" in a film about a mass muderer
!
but that aside
, you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp
, who once agian possesses the strength in character
and flawless acting abilities
, to center this movei all the way through
. sure
, he ' s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow
,
but he does it so well
and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one
. i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film
( i wass sure that her presence would ruin this movie
,
but she was fine
)
and how little the dreams
/ fantasies of depp ' s character had to do with the film ' s development
( from what i had seen in the trailer
, i thought the filmmakers were gogin to make this thge crux of the story
,
bu thankfully
, it wasn ' t
)
. on the downside
, the film doesn ' t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well
and lacks character devolopment
.
but
then again
, a story about thge most mysterious serial killer of all
- time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement
. i mean
, the less i knew baout each person
, the mroe suspicious i became of each one ' s motives
, reasons
, etc
.
.
. in fact
, i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer inthe the end
,
and that was infact part
, due tothe the distance to which i ' d beeen held from the film ' s characters
.
.
. or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention
? perhaps
. overall
, this is an extremely creepy production
, with glorious cinematography
( reminiscent of coppola ' s dracula
and burton ' s sleepy hollow
)
, a grim score
and solid acting
.
bu it ' s not for everyone
. some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars ofthe theese tragic events
,
annd even
though the murders aren ' t shown as graphically as you might think
, there ' s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors
.
bu i for oney love movies that blend their ecclectic visual style with an interesting mystery
and palpable
, gothic atmosphere
,
and thsi flick is just thyat
and plenty more
!
and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper ' s haunting capetown silhouette
and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon
.
