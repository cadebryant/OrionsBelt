" doogie howser
" star neil patrick harris as mind
- reading military intelligence is only one of tyhe guilty pleasures of
" starship troopers
,
" a hugely entertaining
, mega
- budgeted sci
- fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven
, who ' s making quite a recovery from his 1995 g
- string epic
" showgirls
.
" sure
,
" starship troopers
" qualifies as cinematic junk food
,
but that ' s forgivable wehn the junk food is tihs tasty
. everyone needs a high
- calorie change
- of
- pace from fall ' s onslaught ofthe costume dramas
and other assorted oscar bait
,
and
" troopers
" doesnt the job admirably despite its flaws
. for its first hour
,
" starship troopers
" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid ofthe
" saved by the bell

" in the distant years ahead
, high school grad johnny rico
( casper van dien
) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen
( denise richards
)
; he gets accepted into the mobile infanty
but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot
, so the couple is broken up
.
but there ' s temptation awaiting both of them
-
- johnny ' s is in the form of an old friend
( dina meyer
) also in the infantry
and still harboring a secret crush
, while carmen attracts tyhe eye of her flirtatious instructor
( patrick muldoon
)
. personal rivalry
and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes
, wehn an impending alien menace beigns making good on its threatening presence
annd obliterates part of south america
, killing johnny ' s parents
and destroying his home
. our weakening
, lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry
,
and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens ' home planet
, where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good
.
but the enemy is far smarter
, more diablical
anbd numberous than the good guys give them credit for
,
and after an initial walloping
, they must re
- examine their strategy
. the exposition
-
- played like a futuristic soap opera
-
- is silly
,
but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans
. once we get past the campy character introductions
and thte numberous
(
but never boring
) training sessions
,
" starship troopers
" really kicks into high gear
. its last half is all gruesomely violent action
-
- a fury of severed limbs
, decapitations
, disembowelments
, brain removal
, explosions
and other jolt
- inducers that are really gogin to please the 13
-
and 14
- year
- old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into htis deservedly r
- rated show
. the creature design
annd special effects are amazing as expected
,
and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic
, imaginative high point
. it ' s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren ' t too derivative ofthe the titular menace from
" alien
.
" these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights
, especially the arachnids
, a spider
- scorpion
- crab combo that ' s all sharp talons
and even sharper legs
. they attack in packs of hundreds
,
and it ' s a funny
, scarry sight to see these bugs take repeated hits
adn still crawl
, jerk
annd struggle towards their intended victims in a determined
, gooey mess
. it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind
( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable ofthe carrying out such a plot
)
; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous
, bloody
adn immensely satisfying
. the occasional dramatic moments
-
- noe cast member ' s death
, the final resolution to johnny ' s lvoe triangle
-
- are botched
, a testament to how
" starship troopers
" fails to create any strong
, outstanding characters
. these bland ken
-
and
- barbie archtypes serve the story adequately enough tothe keep any distractions at arm ' s length
,
but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la
" star wars
,
" where even the slightest aliens had definiet personality
. the acting is decent
(
but never spectacular
)
; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory
-
- smallish roles on
" beverly hills 90210
"
and
/ or
" melrose place
"
-
-
and it occasionally shows
. van dien
, for example
, is limited
but perfectly likeable
. in smaller parts are the afore
- mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny ' s best friend
and jake busey
( gary ' s son
) as johnny ' s sidekick
; the latter excels at playing creeps
( see
" the frighteners
" or
" contact
"
)
but seems off
- kilter as a second banana
.
" starship troopers
" is based on tjhe novel by robert heinlein
, a sci
- fi writer who hasn ' t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994 ' s howler
" the puppet masters
.
"
but the overall familiarity to the
" alien
" trilogy
-
-
and the promise of great gobs of gore
-
- could act as a crowd
- drawer
. its pwn possible influence
,
however
, might well work against it when the franchise continuation
" alien
: resurrection
" opens in a few weeks
. we will nkwo
then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall
.
