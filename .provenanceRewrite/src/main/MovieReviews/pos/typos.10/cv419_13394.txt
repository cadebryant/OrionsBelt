the rich man ' s wife is noe of those movies like final anaylsis or body double
, where the stoy
and characters are so one
- dimensional
and contrived that you know you shouldn ' t be enjoying yourself
.
but somehow
, the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it
and get into the swing of things
. not that it ' s bad
, it ' s just that it ' s beeen done before
;
and better
, in my opinion
. i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre
,
but it ' s probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now
; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet
, striving helplessly tothe get out
,
and instead of just flushing him
, you end up kind ofthe rooting for the little guy
? that ' s basically how i felt about this movie
. i mean
, it ' s not very good
,
but it ' s not completelyl bad either
. the wife of the title is josie potenza
( played nicely by halle berry
)
. she is marryied to tony
( christopher mcdonald
.
.
. you know
, the guy who looks like joe piscapo
)
, a relaly stressed
- out businessman who drinks way to much
and doesn ' t give josie the attention she deserves
(
* cough
, cough
*
)
. thus
, she is driven into the arms of another man
, jake golden
( clive owen
)
. near the beginning of tyhe film
, josie decides to try
adn work things out with tony by dumping jake
and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods
. once there
,
however
, tony has to leave almost immediately due to busineses details
( i ' m still not quite sure what line of work he ' s in
)
. making the best of her situation
, josie stays ther
and begins makeing the rounds at the local bars
. one night
, she meets a stranger named cole
( peter greene
, finally getting a meaty role
)
. they ahve dinner together
,
and eventually
, both josie
and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal
. after learning that she is not happily married
, cole offers to
" take care
" of the problem
. managing to escape from thge psychotic maniac
, josie returns home
and starts a reconciliation with her estranged
and very wealthy husband
.
bu
then one night
, cole shows up
.
.
.
and here is where the fun begins
. from this point on
, it ' s going to be a no
- holds
- barred cliche
- fest
, ripping off every movie from strangers onthe a turain to the usual suspects
. this is why most criticists panned this movie when it first came outloud
.
and for the most part
, they ' re right
; the rich man ' s wife has nary one original bone in it ' s body
.
but who cares
? if you ' re looking for good ol ' dumb suspense movei
, you cxan ' t do much better than this
.
and if you suspense buffs aren ' t aready sold
, it has a killer of an ending too
.
