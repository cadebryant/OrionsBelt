anbd lawrence konner starring charlize theron
, bill paxton
, david paymer as reviewed by james brundage i ' m beginning to get fed up
. over my four years as a critic
, the thing which hasnt kept me going isnt the moderate balance of films
. the ogod balances the bad
. i try to see both in equal proportions
.
bu disney ' s mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven ' t seen a truley terrible movie
. it ' s a backwards machismo
, i suppose
, the urge to see the things which you so loathe
;
but i ened to see a bad film every once in a while
.
and
, you know what
, mighty joe young doesn ' t qualify
. far from being bad
, mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie
. it ' s enjoyable
, appropriate
, cute
, cuddly
,
and all of those other things that i ' ve been seeing in every movie since a bug ' s life
. mighty joe young tracks a 2
, 000 pound gorilla infact hte wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in
.
.
. california
?
.
.
. for safe
- keeping
. okay
. a little unrealistic
,
but who ever said a kid ' s movie had to have the slightest hint of realism
. tje frist half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist
- esque hatred of poachers woman
- of
- the
- wild motif
. the second half is a straight up parody ofthe king kong
, awestruck onlookers
and all
. mark one down
. i ' m feeling relaxed
. it is
, as a point of fatc
, an extremely un
- creative movie
.
but
, as a vetern
, i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn ' t count for as much as it should
. so that saves mighty joe from my wrath
,
although my colleagues
and cohorts
and surely bashing this film at this very moment
. this is not the film to take a girl on a date to
. it ' s not the film for you
. it ' s the film for you
and your family
. when you ' re right alongside your kid
, all of the normal rights
and wrongs slip away
. teh same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick
. it becomes fun
. all yuo have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up
and watch
.
