this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960 ' s under the same appellation
. mind you
, most people
( including yours truly
) who will see this movie will not ahev seen any episodes from the original series
. the movei is really a stand alone in that regard
. the family robinson
.
.
. lost infront space
. plot
: set in the yera 2058
, the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space inaddition search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs inwhich order to survive its future
. a colonization process
, if yuo will
. htey are joined by able pilot west
( leblanc
)
,
and evil uninvited stowaway
( oldman
)
, who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip
. eventually
, their trek goes awry
,
adn all are
" lost in space
"
.
" how do get back to earth
?
" is the question that infests the rest of this sci
- fi epic
. critique
: this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element
( 6
. 5
/ 10
) from the summer of 1997
. it ' s a film with a lot of flash
,
but very little actual substance
. admittedly
, there isn ' t an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film
,
bu thsi film does run a little too long
,
and did lose me in regards to its complex time
- travel
/ multi
- dimensional story line
. having said that
, the special effects in this movie weere amazing
,
and the overall look
and feel were also way above average
. you really felt like you were inthe the future
,
and riding through space with these poor souls
. unfortunately for this chosen family
, their 10
- year old son is hte smartest one in the group
,
and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family
( ever heard thyat one before
? yawn
!
)
. the acting is ok
,
and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend ' s matt leblanc who shows us all that he ' s definitely more thna just a preety face
. on the down side
, teh family riff
- raff that cuts through most of tyhe picture is lame
and time
- consuming
( even
though we gotta give them credit for
" trying
" to develop characters in a sci
- fi pic
)
, the story line is hard to folow
, the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he ' s
" evil
"
,
anbd the movei goes on for about 20 minutes too long
. onthe the slick side
, many of the special effects are really cool
( the sequence in which yhe family is
" paralyzed
" during tjhe hyper
- drive is awesome
,
and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool
)
, the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming
,
adn the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling
( i iwll also admit that
" somehow
" they got me to semi
- tear up near the conclusion of this picture
.
.
.
. very odd
.
.
.
.
.
)
. overall
, if you ' re a big sci
- fi fan
, check this movie out for the special effects
and challenging narrative
,
and if you ' re not
, i would still suggest seeing this movie
,
but
then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts
. little known facts
: this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic
( 7
/ 10
) out of the top spot at the box
- office after 15 straight weeks at number one
. garry oldman is british
,
and was once married to uma thurman for about six months
. mimi rogers was tom cruise ' s first wife
