teh laserman
: somehow the title of writer
- director
- producer peter wang ' s film conjures up images of superheroes
, like ultraman
and spiderman
. you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips
. as it turns out
, the laserman
_ is
_ about crime
and about laser beams
,
but there aren ' t any superheroes
. instade
, wang ' s film is populated by a group ofthe refreshingly off
- beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot
: new york city
. the laserman isnt a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity
, eccentricity
,
and electricity
. the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss
( marc hayashi
)
, a chinese
- american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant inwhich an experiment
. he loses his job
but finds work with a mysterious company whitch secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds
. arthur ' s proffesional life isnt cluttered with moral dilemmas
. his personal life
, on the other hand
, is cluttered with colorful friends
and quirky relatives
. in fact
, arthur is by far the blandest character in the film
, despite a charismatic performance by hayashi
( the san francisco
- based actor whose films include chan is missing
and the karate kid ii
)
. it ' s tje auxiliary characters who give yhe laserman its unique spark
. arthur ' s not
- so
- typical jewish mother
, ruth
, for example
, is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body
. she has dyed her red hair black
, she tkaes herbal medicine daily
,
and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies
, such as matzo balls in soy sauce
-
- the ultimate fusion of jewish
annd chinese cuisine
. veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part
and runs with it
, almost stealing the movei in the process
. she plays ruth as a driven woman
, determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself infact chinese culture
. arthur ' s girlfriend janet
( maryann urbano
) is a kooky free
- spirit who would rather meditate than copulate
; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation
. arthur ' s best friend
, joey
( tony leung
)
, is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns
. joey is married to arthur ' s jewish sister
,
bu he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house
. arthur ' s 11
- year
- old son
, jimmy
, played by the amazingly adorable david chan
, is
-
- horror of horrors
-
- bad at math
! he finds it impossible tothe meet his father ' s lofty expectations
. the various people in arthur ' s life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity
. like wang ' s earlier film
, a great wall
( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china
)
, the laserman revolves around cultural differences
. every character in teh film is
, in some way or another
, trying to find his identity
-
- struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture
and the american way
. the movie also offers a provacative look at technology
. wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu
, a detective who isnt fed up with machines
, even
though he relies on them to dont his job
. the film views technology with a wary eye
, acknowledging its necessity while at the smae time realizing its potential dangers
. wang raises the time
- honored question ofthe whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions
. was einstein responsible for the a
- bomb
? is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers
? thge movie pits spirituality against technology
, man against machine
,
anbd the result is a draw
. according to the film
, technology has its place
,
but we must employ it with great forethought
and caution
. ironically
, by its very nature
, the laserman isnt a triumph of technolgy
-
- the technology of filmmaking
. wang ' s direction is exquisite
, especially during the tense finale in which the directer frantically cross
- cuts between the various subplots
, perhaps in homage to d
. w
. griffith
. cinematographer ernest dickerson
, who has worked on all of spike lee ' s films
, gives the laserman a distinctive
, artistic look
. mason daring ' s score
, whic includes a send
- up of bach
, is right on target
. the laserman is an ambitious endeavor
, which is to be applauded
,
but it ' s somtimes ambitious to a fault
. wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it ' s hard to digest them all
. for instance
, one character
( arthur ' s sister
) has negligible screen time
,
and consequently we just don ' t care about her marital problems
. in weaving his web
, wang has included a few too many strands
. overall
,
however
, the laserman is a charmingly eclectric concoction
. on the surface
, the film is a light
and bouncy comedy
- thriller
, overflowing with whimsical humor
and visual style
. the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film
. yuo can ponder tyhe moral questions or you can just sit back
and enjoy tjhe absurdity of life in china twon
.
