the keen wisdom ofthe an elderly bank robber
, the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse
,
and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest
, little caper adventure entitled
` where the money is
. ' the elderly bank robber is henry
( paul newman
)
, a famous criminal tyhat was only recently caught
. he has pulled off dozens of succesful heists
anbd has probably stashed away a small fortune
. always the shrewd thinker
, he begins working on a plan to get out of jail
. this involves yeasr of studying buddhism
and self
- hypnosis
. wehn he is prepared to execute his plan
, he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke
. nowe a seemingly twitching vegetable
, he is temporarily transferred to a state
- run home
. carol
( linda fiorentino
) is the nurse that cares for him
. she ' s a very bright person wtih a good heart
.
yet
, her life isnt a miserable waste of time
. the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars
. her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics
. worse
, she ' s in a dead
- end relationship with high
- skool sweetheart wayne
( dylan mcdermott
)
. they became a couple because they were king
and queen of the prom
. to her
, this made sense long ago
.
but now
, it ' s a different story
. wayne seems equally bored with his life
,
but is content enough to stay put
. wayne ' s greatest ambition is tothe become a night shift supervising foreman
. carol feels as lifeless as many of tyhe other hospital patients
,
but she ' s never been anywhere esle
and doesn ' t see many other opportunities in life
.
however
, when henry falls under her care
, her outlook begins to change
. the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke
. carol
,
however
, begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all
. maybe she can get through tothe him
,
and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away
. the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts ofthe carol trying tothe bring henry
? back to life
. '
and what are some of carol ' s resuscitation techniques
? perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses
. if that fails
, maybe she ' ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20
- foot high pier into the cold lake below
. when he finally comes out of his state ofthe self
- trance
, the movie ' s direction changes
,
though it remains equally if not more entertaining
. carol sees that henry is filled wtih charisma
and self
- assuredness
. she isnt invigorated by his commanding presence
and refreshed by his vibrancy
. htis
, of course
, puts wayne in an odd situation
. henry
and carol ' s bond grows stronger when they enter into an aggrement to rob an armored car
. henry needs this heist beacuse he isnt unable to retrieve his original stash
. meanwhile
, this is carol ' s ticket to a better life
. wayne isnt uncomfortable with the situation
,
bu helps out nonetheless
.
however
, his lack of committment threatens their success
. the heist sequence is suspenseful
, well paced
,
and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong
.
` where the moeny isnt ' does more to spotlight newman
and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist
. newman is the real joy of the film
, adroitly showing that at age 75
, he ' s still really hot stuff
. he possesses a sly smile
, displays a dominating attitude
,
and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive
. fiorentino is also a fun presence
. you root for her despite her sence of amorality
. sure
, she wants to commit robbery
and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair
- stricken man into a lake
,
but we can see that to escape her dead
- end world
, she needs tothe do something drastic
. with twpo charismatic characters such as these
, it ' s hard to ignore that
` where the money is ' is where the fun is
.
