it ' s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who ' s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone
,
but by god
,
" american history x
" does it
,
and for that
, i commend it
. it not onyl takes balls
but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind of person who dedicates theri lives to hating anyone who ' s not what they are
,
and this film wisely
and miracurously puls it off
. the subject of this film is one of them
,
but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of thge pack
. he ' s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage
,
and
then in another brilliant stroke
, justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks
. he ' s so utterly convincing as a publich speaker
and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process
. his name is derek vinyard
,
and he ' s played by edward norton with so much fire
and intensity tyhat when he speaks he ' s almost as convincing
and arresting a public speaker as
, say
, malcom x
. whn we firt see him
, he ' s clean shaven
, with a jet black swastica emrboidered onthe his left breast
, a devlish goatee
,
and he ' s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing
but his white boxers
annd carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets
, at least when he doesn ' t need them
. he so believes in his convictions that he ' s willing to put his beliefs to the test
, even if he knows it will mean a stop infact prision
, if only for a couple years
.
" american history x
" is about derek
, how he became a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose to power
, how he was rehabilitated in prison aftter murdering two black men in a fit ofthe rage that was less to dont with the stealing of his car
and more to do with proving himself
,
annd how he tried tothe save others
, namely his younger brother
, fomr making tjhe same mistake
. we see him at all of these stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hite monger
, a man having an epiphany
,
and the man who tries tothe correct what he ' s done before
-
and in all of theese
, we get a portrait of a man from all sides
. or at least
, that ' s the intention
. the film ' s framing device is his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking about 13
)
, aslo now a skinhead
,
and how his principal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i jsut found out was or is teh captain on star trek ' s deepo space 9
)
, is trying to
" correct
" him
. wehn the film opens
, danny has just written a book report on
" mein kampf
,
" landing him in trouble with sweeney
, which causes him to make him write a paper onthe derek ' s life
and how it has gotten him nowhere
. coincidentally
, this day is the day derek is released from prison
,
and when we see him
, he ' s cleaned
- up
, not as buff
,
anbd has a full head of hair
. he ' s jstu as intelligent
,
but still very rough along the edges
,
bu he ' s wisened up
. he ' s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks
and jews
,
and tries to persuade danny
, who ' s becoming what derek wass before
, to give up his lifestyle
.
but danny won ' t
. he goes to a large skinhead beer bash
, meets with the skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
and
then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo
- nazi
- dom as he was forthe it a couple of years ago
. the film circles around this
,
then spnish off into non
- linear flashbacks
, all done in black
and white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living in venice beach
, organizing vicious
adn quasi
- sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white
, middle
- class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper ilegle immigrants to do the smae work
,
and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action
and how illegal immigrants
and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on
. tothe them
, the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end ofthe the lolipop
,
and he not only speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
and intelligently
,
but he backs everything up with political reasons
, justifying their rage at least tothe them
.
and frighteningly enough
, much of what he says sounds true
.
" american history x
" is a collection of really great scenes
and moments
, rather than a cohesive
, great film that flows effortlessly from one moent to the next
. infront it
, there are some of the best scenes i ' ve seen all year
. one scene features a dinner betwen derek ' s family
,
and his mother ' s newest boyfriend
( played with reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek ' s rightist views
, launching the scene into a fit of rage
and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience
( gould ' s reaction to derek ' s final summation is unnerrving
)
. another scene uses humor
and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship
and a nice connection between derek
and a black co
- worker
( guy torry
) while folding laundry in prison
.
and another soon
- to
- be
- classic isnt actually divided in two
: the murder ofthe teh twpo balck men that winds derek in jail
, which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year
. htere ' s much more to appreciate
, like the acting
, whic isnt uniformly good
, with stand
- outs comming from avery brooks
, beverly d ' angelo
( as the long
- suffering mother
)
,
anbd gould
( who has one horrible line
,
but other than that
, comes off with the best peformance he ' s given in what seems like a really long time
)
. norton walks off with the film
,
though
, coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone nto doing an adequate job to rubble
. in only the fith movie of his career
, norton has invented himself as oen ofthe the most reliable
and intense actors of his generation
,
and maybe the best
. there ' s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie
, spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention fomr the audience
, coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando
. that he allows the little emotions tothe seep through is amazing
. sadly enough
, this isn ' t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be
. it ' s too unambitious
and even a little contrived to really take off as either a poweful statement or an emotional masterpiece
. the ending
, especialy
, is pencilled inwhich from other movies
, tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon
. some of the skinheads are reduced tothe mere cliches
( kevin smith regluar ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more
)
,
and even the dramatic arc isn ' t as well travelled
. furlong ' s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson
, since the flashbacks refuse tothe sohw his point of view
,
and when he decides to make a change by the end
( which was inevitable
)
, it doesn ' t seem like it has actually arrived there
. even derek ' s descent into skinhead
- dom doesn ' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, thge dad from
" boy meets world
,
"
and don ' t ask me how i know that
) is killed by a black junkie
,
annd even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently
, ther never seems to be any rela back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs
. as such
, one cin see why the director
, tony kaye
, wanted tothe have his name removed
. sorta
.
" american history x
" is a very good movie
,
adn i was very moved by it
,
but it could be a lot better
,
and the probelm seems to be that thge cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential
. somewhere
, he claims
, there lies a tony kaye cut
,
and that was to be the true cutted until it was viewed by norton
, who
then ordered another cut
,
and that is thus
.
although he aimed for the directing credit to go to
" alan smithee
,
" thge resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director
, it wasn ' t allowed to him
, under the grounds that once you disown a film
, you can nto badmouth it
(
but really
, that ' s the macguffin
- no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disaproval
)
. kaye ' s right in that it ' s not up to par
, even if he ' s not referring to normal par
but rather his own personal par
. htis will not be a
" do the right thing
" for the late 90s
.
yet it still gets its point across intelligently
,
and backs it up with its story
( its message
, that one cannot be so enwrapped in one ' s pwn beliefs or pain
and sufferring will occur
, is literally said over the narration
, unfortunately
)
.
and even if it isn ' t perfect
, at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten
and raped inspite prison
,
and asks him if anything he ' s done hasnt made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, not only in derek
,
but also in hte audience
.
