most sequels don ' t do what tehy ' re supposed to do like
" toy story 2
" does
. far too many of them end up re
- hashing the original
and adding very little
. is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors
? thankfully
,
" toy story 2
" isnt a wonderful exception
. i cant ' t remeber the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun
and inventive as this one
. it ' s
yet another sign that pixar
, the acclaimed animation studio behind
" toy story
"
adn
" a bug ' s life
,
" is still at the top ofthe its game
. woody
and buzz are bcak inaddition the sequel tothe the 1995 hitted
" toy story
,
"
and things have changed a bited since the lastr oen ended
. woody
( voiced by tom hanks
) is preparing tothe leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp
. in his absence
, he has assigned buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, now comfortable in his role as a toy
, to take charge
. unfortunately
, woody ' s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the famaly garage sale
,
and isnt stolen by an over
- zealous toy collector
( wayne knight
)
. off to save him are buzz
and members of tyhe old
" toy gang
,
" including mr
. potato head
( don rickles
)
, rex the nervous dinosaur
( wallace shawn
)
, hamm the piggy bank
( john ratzenberger
)
,
and slinky dog
( jim varney
)
. while inthe captivity
, woody makes a startling discovery
: he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950 ' s children ' s show entitled
" woody ' s roundup
.
" he meets the show ' s otehr characters
, which include jesse
( joan cusack
)
, his cowgirl sidekick
, the wise old prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
,
and bullseye
, his trusty horse
. they have all been anxiously awaiting woody ' s arrival
, as once their set is completed
, they will be sold to a japanese toy museum
,
and finally excape storage forever
. this means woody now faces a difficult choice
. wiht his friends coming to rescue him
, does he go with them
and spend a few more years with andy
, or does he go to japan
and be immortalized forever
? as in the original film
,
" toy story 2
" containes firt
- rate animation
,
and pixar studios hasnt done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there
. reportedly
, the film was originally slated for a direct
- to
- video release
,
bu after seeing the improvements that had been made
, disney rightly decided to release it into theaters
. the film is well worth seeing on the big screen
. the colors are bright
, the textures sharp
,
and even the human characters look more
" human
.
" the animation is consistently seamless
, with the action fast
and furious
and the facial expressions believable
. there are so many impressive sequences that i ' d find it impossible to list them here
,
but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz
and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al ' s toy barn
, the tsore owned by woody ' s captor
. pixar ' s rendition of the family dog isnt also nicely done
, with fur so realistic you almost fiel you sould reach out
annd touch it
. thte voice work is also perfectly complementary
,
adn as with the first movie
, does much to help further chracter development
. tom hanks
and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody
and buzz
, making you forget who is doing the voice
. it was woody
and buzz up there
, not tom
and tim
. all the cast members from the original reprise thier roles
,
and each is exellent
. several new voices have beeen added
, with joan cusack
, kelsey grammer
,
and wayne knight doing fine work
.
" toy story 2
" is strong in characterization
,
and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie
. woody faces difficult choices
, while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn ' t
yet realized his status as a toy
, forcing him to see what he used to be like
. the new cahracters are also developed quite well
, especially jesse
, who narrates a sarah mclachlan
- aided flashback illustrating how she was loved
,
thne forgotten by her owner
. it may be computer
- animated
,
and it may hvea sappy music
,
but it ' s downright touching
. the script
, despite having a story
and screenplay each credited to four differnt writers
, is endlessly clever
and inventive
, especially concidering that it ' s a sequel
. the reason
" toy story 2
" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original ' s success by re
- doing the same story
and using the same characters
. not this one
. we get character change
, new cahracters
,
and new issues brought up
.
" toy story 2
" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself
. there is always another clever idea waiting jstu around tyhe corner here
. the humor is sharp
and witty
, with something to amuse both kids
and adults
. there are funny asides to films such as
" star wars
"
and
" jurassic park
,
" among others
, new tkaes on clasic toys like barbie
adn rock ' em sock ' em robots
,
and appearances from other pixar efforts
" a bug ' s life
"
adn tghe 1997 short
" geri ' s gameboy
.
"
( geri himself mkaes an appearence as a toy repairman who fixes woody ' s broken arm
.
) the action is fast
and furious
,
and teh chases
( inthe the street
, in a toy store
, in an elevator
, on a baggage carousel
,
anbd in an airplane
) keep getting bigger
and better
.
" toy story 2
" never grows stagnant
, because there isnt always something new to hold your interest
. the more you pay attention to it
, the more rewarding it is
. it ' s rare to see a film like
" toy story 2
" come along
, because it ' s hte kind of film tht ' s almost impossible to dislike
. it ' s created purely to entertain
,
and
though i enjoy a thought
- provoking drama as much as the enxt person
, it ' s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do
: send us out with a smile
. it ' s a fair bet that tghe whole familiy iwll have smiles on their collective faces after seing
" toy story 2
.
" it ' s the rare sequal that manages to expand on
,
and live up to
, the original
.
