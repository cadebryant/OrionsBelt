john sayles '
" men with guns
" is about what happens tothe a society when brute force
and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining
and maintaining power
. the film takes place in an unnamed central american country
, where the men with guns are the rulers
. most of the country is divided into tiny segments
- some are controlled by guerrillas with guns
, some are controlled by army soldiers with guns
,
and all the spaces in
- between are contolled by theives
, bandits
,
and terrorists
. all people not fitting one of those descriptions are deffined only by their powerlessness
.
however
, like so many central american countries
, this one also features modernity
. there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
.
but
, it might as well be in anohter country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided tothe ignore the violentce ravaging the rest ofthe the land
, or else they are simply ignorant of it
. the film ' s main character
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls inot the latter category
. one of his patients
, an army general
, descriibes him as the most educated man he has ever met
,
and also the most naive
. fuentes is a true liberal
, a caring man who thikns he can cure tyhe ills of his country by fighting bacteria
and igorance among the indigenous indians
. with government assistance
, he has trained a large group of eager young medical students
and sent them into the rainforest to cure
and educate
. this program was to be his legacy
,
and he repeats over
and over that it was a good idea
.
however
, when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned
. as he travels deeper into the forest
, going from village to village
, the story is always the same
: the doctors weere all killed by either thge guerrillas or the army soldiers
, usually for helping the other
. whn dr
. fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors
, she replies simply
,
" because they had guns
,
and we didn ' t
.
" rational science
and all its attemts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns
, becasue others ' sickness
and ignorance helps them maintain power
. dr
. fuentes picks up several companions during his journey
, all ofthe whom are characterized by their loss
. first
, there is a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who has neither a mother nor a father
. next
, fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities
. through his ordeal in the army
, domingo has lost most of his self
- respect
,
and defines himself only by his pistol
. along thge way
, the group also picks up padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who has lost his faith
. as domingo is running from the army
, so is portillo
- he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer
,
and ran away from the village in which he was preaching
. last
, the group takes on a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn ' t spoken since she was raped two years ealier
, her innocence
and even her wiull to live forcefully taken from her
. sayles two major strengths as a director
- characters
and setting
- are abundantly evident in
" men iwth guns
.
"
( like many of his films
, sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room
,
but a longer
- than
- necessary running time isnt a sin almost always committed wehn the director is also the editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex charachters
, especially dr
. fuentes
and domingo
. their uneasy relatiopnship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film ' s overarching theme of violence as power
- domingo ' s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes ' belief that the revolver is unloaded
( at first it is
,
bu later is isn ' t
)
. the setting is also as thick iwth detail as the rainforest itself
. sayles knows how to bring a location to life
, whether it be an early twentieth
- century coal mining town in
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contemporary texas
/ mexico bordertown inspite
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles is not a particularly inventive director
- he likes to let his actors dont most of the owrk
-
but he
and cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) successfully evoke both the beauty
and the danger of the central american terrain
. sayles also maintains a strong sense ofthe authenticity by filming everything on loction in mexico
, using all latin american actors
,
and having all tyhe dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects
. the one exception isnt a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief
,
bu as evidence of jsut how clueless thte united states is baout what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border
. it would not be a stretch to say that
" men whith guns
" is a depressing film
. in fact
, the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness
and failure
. in addition to loss
, the main characters are also failures at something
, whether that be dr
. fuentes failure to change anything through medicine
, or padre portillo ' s inability to stand up
and be tyhe martyr he always dreamed of being
. nevertheless
, it is bleak material sayles has choosen
,
and he deals with it accordingly
. the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope
, even in a world where
, as one character puts it
,
" nobody refuses thge men with guns
.
