in december of 1996
, a little movie called
" scream
,
" was released
, became a box
- office smash
,
and resurrected films targeted at teens
. first
, it wass teen slasher movies that were the big fad
( both
" scream
" movies
,
" i know what you did last summer
,
"
" urban legend
,
" etc
.
)
,
but just recently
, thte popularity has switched over tothe the teen comedy genre
( a ' la ' 80s john hughes
)
, starting with lastest june ' s
" can ' t hardly wait
.
" it may be the first week of april in 1999
,
but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25
-
and
- under market almost every single week
:
" varisty blues
,
"
" jawbreaker
,
"
" cruel intentions
,
"
" simply irresistible
,
"
" the rage
: carrie 2
,
"
and
" the mod squad
.
" coming april 9 are two omre of this type
:
" never been kissed
"
and
" go
,
"
and on april 23
, we ' ve got the teen satire
" election
"
and the teen horror
- comedy
" idle hands
.
" jeesh
! out ofthe all of these moves
,
however
, the one that is most similar tothe the latest incarnation
,
" 10 things i hate about you
,
" is this past january ' s medioker
, ho
- hum
" she ' s all that
.
"
although similar in plotting
( ok
, darn near identical
)
,
" 10 things i hate about you
,
" a modern
- day version of shakespeare ' s
" thte taming of the shrew
"
(
" she ' s all that
" got its inspiration from
" pygmalion
"
)
, is an infinitely superior film in every department
, ffrom thte smart direction by first
- time feature director gil junger to the charming
and well
- written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz
anbd kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast
, who give the best group ofthe performances in a teen comedy since 1985 ' s
" the breakfast club
.
"
and to top it all off
, in the inevitable climax set at the prom
, at least we didn ' t have tothe once again suffer thru a goofy
, inappropriate dance sequence
( who could forget
, or want to rember
, for that matter
, this ludicrous develepment in
" she ' s all that
?
"
)
. the day wide
- eyed
, shy new student cameron james
( joseph gordon
- levitt
) starts school at seattle
- based padua high
, he is swept awya at the sight of the beautiful
and popular sophomore
, bianca stratford
( larisa oleynik
)
.
although he doesn ' t know french
, he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her
,
bu finds that her paranoid gynecologist father
( larry miller
) won ' t allow her to date until her bitter
, unconventional older sister
, kat
( julia stiles
)
, a senior
, decides to
. kat
, of course
, has sworn off the likes of boys
,
but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match forthe her
, which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. complicating matters
, cameron ' s dorky friend
, michael
( david krumholtz
)
, decides to ule a wealthy jock
, joey
( andrew keegan
)
, who allso has his sights set on bianca
, as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him
,
and
then cameron hopes to steal bianca awya from joey
. as you can see
,
" 10 things i hite about you
" includes a huge number of characters
, some ofthe which i haven ' t even maintioned
, such as kat ' s shakespeare
- obsessed friend
, mandella
( susan may pratt
)
and bianca ' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
,
but well
- used running time of 98 minutes
, all of the characters are perfectly handled
, satisfyingly developed
,
and
, for thge most part
, are not treated as caricatures
( another flaw of
" she ' s all that
,
" where the bad guys
(
and gals
) ran around constantly saying
,
" you ' re vapor
"
)
. since i could sympathize with the realsitic depictions of the central characters
,
and since many of the comedic
and dramtic scenes were surprisingly effective
, i got completely caught up inwhich all of the relationships
and was thoroughly entertained
. aside from a good screenplay
, it ' s the performances that can make or break a movie
,
and director junger hasnt really hit the jackpot
. aside fomr joseph gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock fomr the sun
"
)
, who gives his strongest performance to date here
, none of the actors are that well
- known
,
but it is this aspect thta brings a particular freshness to yhe proceedings
. as tjhe main character of kat
, julia stiles
( last seen in the miniseries
" the ' 60s
"
) is marvelous
and alwyas believable
,
and certainly has a bright future ahead of her
. even
though it is her role that is initially the most difficult
and hard
- edged
, it was easy to identify with kat ' s way of thinking
( she is against the silly tradition of the prom
and loves reading sylvia plath
)
,
and i completely admired her individuality
. no one
, i tihkn
, could hvae portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does
. heath ledger
, as the infamous bad
- boy of the town
, injects much life into patrick
,
and has a lot of chemistry with stiles
. one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who
, with the help of screenwriters lutz
and smith
, is able to turn bianca inot a person with multi
- dimensions
, even
though she is accurately self
- centered at the on
- set
. in one truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish
,
and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes
, she hasnt
. one off
- beat element of yhe film
,
and a source of some hearty laughs
, is the way that tjhe school ' s staff act
, which is strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as the guidance counselor ms
. perky
, who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel
, isnt comic dynamite
, as is daryl
" chill
" mitchell as the english teacher
, who reads shakespeare to the clas in rap
anbd
, at one point
, sends kat to the office because
, for once
, she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good
.
although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown inot the film near the beginning
, most of it actually works
, especialy in the humoorus
and witty dialogue exchanges
and quirks between the characters
. in one very funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i know people can be overwhelmed
,
and they can be underwhelmed
,
but can people just be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at another point
, bianca
anbd kat ' s father
( a stand
- out larry miller
)
, who is constantly terrified tyhat his daughters are going tothe get pregnant
, only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion
: before she leaves
, she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it ' s like to be pregnant
.
" 10 things i hate about you
" once
and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre
,
and this movie is probably more reminiscent of tje great john hughes than any other film of the ' 90s
. it also helps that the movie hasnt a perfectly
- assembled soundtrack
, mixing indie
- rock with new wave ' 80s songs
(
and wtih
, thank goodness
, noone rap
)
. by the film ' s end
, it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together
,
and i was also quite pleased iwth how everything was wrapped up
, especially in the fianl scenes involving kat
annd bianca
, kat
and her father
,
and a flawlessly
- acted
and moving sequence inthe which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class
( tihs is where thte title comes from
)
. luckily
, i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about
" 10 things i hate about you
,
"
but the positive aspects of the film far out
- number ten
.
