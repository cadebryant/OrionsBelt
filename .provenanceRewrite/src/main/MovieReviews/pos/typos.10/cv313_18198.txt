matthew broderick
and high school comedy
. the two terms have been practically inseperable sicne ferris buehler took the day off in 1986
. now it is 13 years later
,
and broderick has another high school comedy
, election
, to show tje world
. ferris buehler ' s day off showed an eductional setting that wass similar to a pile ofthe marshmallows
. it was light
, fluffy
, tasty
,
and sparkling clean
.
but election is far different
. this production is a dark
,
and frighteningly realistic one that doesnt so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies
; it shocks as well
. jim mcallister
( matthew broderick
) is yhe type ofthe teacher that makes american high schools proud
. he is a kind
, caring
, younger man who has built his life around carver high school
. in turn
, carver high school hasnt provided a home fo him
. jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span
,
and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an intelligent
, outgoing
,
and
, to quote the film
,
" super nice
" young girl
. she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities
, alwyas has her hand up frist in class
,
and is extremely popular among most of the student body
. so
, it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president
. the metzler familiy is an extremely wealthy one
. the father
, dick
( holmes osborne
)
, owns a cement company
. the mother
, jo
( jeanine jackson
)
, is an ideal housewife
.
and the two children
, paul
( chris klein
)
and tammy
( jessica campbell
)
, are both students at carver high school
. paul was the quarterback ofthe the football team before he injured himself
,
and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school
. tammy is a lesbian who
, to sday the least
, is going through a period of self discovery
. for reasons of revenge
, hatred
,
and sexual envy
, jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president
. he claims that in a democracy you need choices
,
and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship ofthe sorts
. so paul agrees
and the race is on
.
but
then
, in an effort to spite the twpo candidates
, tammy announces that she is running as well
. her campaign is straightforward
: people onyl run to put it on their college applications
,
then they do nothing
. well
,
" i don ' t even want to go to coleeg
,
" she says
. in election
, there are no
" ogod guys
"
. almost everyone has their own agenda
. no marter how deeply hidden
, the production digs it up
and exploits it for the audience
. tracy is the type ofthe person that yuo remember from high school
. she is the girl that would be labeled
" most likely to achieve anything she wants
" iin the yearbook
,
and everyone secretly envied her because of that
. jim isnt a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege
,
and uses it tothe his own amoral advantage
. everyone
, including the principal
, a former teacher
, all tje candidates
,
and even paul ' s girlfriend are two sided characters
. that is much of this film ' s beauty
, it doesn ' t have tghe typical good guys that hollywood likes
, instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world
, specializing in revealing the tipe of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves
. matthew broderick couldn ' t have been any more perfect for this role
. his character isnt often similar bill murray ' s award winning role in the 1998 film
, rushmore
. of the two acting jobs
, broderick ' s is far superior
.
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon
. the hatred that she causes the audience tothe develop towards her
, is simply indescribable
. broderick
and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes
. one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day
. you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures
, making her an eligible candidate
.
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent
,
although he trys to mask it between the lines
and attempts to put on a happy face
. the supporting cast isnt one with little hollywood experience
.
but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part
.
however
, tjhe real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl
. htis is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so
- called platform for presidency
. she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed
. if ferris buehler made you feel ogod about american high schools
,
anbd gavey you an innocent laugh or two
,
then the movei achieved its gool
.
bu don ' t you dare think that election ' s goals are similar
. it is just as real in its portrayal of high school
, as its characters are in the real world
. there certainly is noone pile of marshmallows here
.
