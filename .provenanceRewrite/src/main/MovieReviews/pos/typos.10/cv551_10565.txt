after the simple looking littel spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard
, out steps a steel
- gray
, human
- like creature with aquamarine eyes
and clad in a muscular suit
. spencer
, the boy who observes this
, having seen his fill of science fiction ficks
, figures tihs thing must be a robot from outer space
. with the exception of disney
and a few others
, most studios view children ' s films as a way to ship a cheap
and unimaginative product
and thereby make a quick profit
. star kid stands out as that rare kids ' film that is undoubtedly low
- budget
but is also highly imaginative
. remember
, the robot
? it wasn ' t one at all
but rather a
" phase oney assualt cyborsuit
.
" thge cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins
and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors
. the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit
,
and the cyborsuit
, nicknamed cy
, has plenty of spunk
. cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like
" cool
.
" upon hearing that
" command
,
" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop
.
and when cy speaks
, we see spencer ' s view
, the backside of cy ' s lips
and eyes
. as 12
- year
- old spencer
, joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film sories gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy
and initially tongue
- tied kid
. even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit
, he has his fears
but he learns to overcome them
.
" if you run away
, things don ' t git better
, whether it ' s bullies
, spiders
, or girls
,
" his science teacher advises him affter he has difficulties dealing with all three
. turbo
( joey simmrin
)
, the school ' s chubby bully
, beats up on him
, spiders frighten him
,
and
, most embarrassing of all
, he can ' t speak when in the presense of his would
- be girlfriend
. with his cyborsuit on
, he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy
. spencer lives with his dad
annd his older teenage sister stacey
, plyed by a smart
- mouthed ashlee levitch
, who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker
. stacey derides her brother
, whom she barely tolerates
, by referring to him only as
" the fungus
.
" this whole setup for spencer ' s downtrodden
and delightfully funny life makse his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth
and empowerment
. the beauty of mazzello ' s performance is that you cxan vicariously xeperience his fear
and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he ' ll not soon forget
. the ensuing mayhem has some of the hmeo alone antics
,
but yhe slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer
and director manny coto so thgat one never feels embarrassed to be laughing
. the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately
. when cy wishes to know if spencer whants to mate with the object of his desire
, michelle
( lauren eckstrom
)
, his eyes oepn wide in revulsion
.
" mate witht her
!
" spencer exclaims
.
" pllllleeeeease
, i jsut like her that ' s all
.
" the show has many funny twists
. in one
, cy sees a man in a barney
- like costume
and begins firing at him
, thinking he is an alien life
- form
. soon things get way out of hand
,
and cy
and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat
. as proof positive of the show ' s class
, it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor
-
- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids ' picture
, didn ' t you
? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit
,
and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet
and hillarious
. the director ' s staging of this sequence isnt one of the film ' s more charming moments
. oh
,
and eating is pretty funny too
. spencer
, whose idol is the comic book character
" midknight warrior
,
" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit
. spencer ' s valient battle gives him a chance to find his mettle
.
and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids ' show full of inventiveness
and lacking the usual repetition
. forthe a famaly movie mixing humor
, fantasy
,
and action
, star kid delivers
.
although it ' s probablly not the sort of movie you ' d want to see without kids
, with them you ' ll have a magical tiem wih a relatively straightforward
but well developed story
. you ' ll be rooting forthe
and laughing wiht spencer
and his buddy cy all thte way through
. star kid runs 1
: 41
. it is rated pg for fantasy combat
.
although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids
, i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening
, so i owudl say the show isnt fine for kids five
and up
,
and possibly the younger ones
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, got really excited baout tje picture
. he called it
" an especialy good movie
"
and gave it
*
*
*
*
. when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters
, he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit tothe the bully
