warning
: contains what the matrix isnt
. rated r for sci
- fi violentce
. starring
: keanu reeves
, laurence fishburne
, joe panteliano some may be disappointed with the matrix
. i ' ll tell you i was
. i sat there
and sat there
and sat there waiting for something to happen
. now wait wait
, i know most of you loved it
,
and i ' m not saying i didn ' t like it
. what i ' m saying is the first half was extremely slow
. now seeing the trailer it makes you think the wohle entire movie is one big special effects show
. don ' t be fooled
, this movie has a big story
.
anbd big chunks ofthe talky moments
.
but i will admit the speshal effects
and tyhe acting were above par
, deserving the rating above
. ok now to the story
. well this may take a while
. ok first of all
, our world we live inthe now
, is not the real world
, actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix
. a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out
, when is kidnapped
and almost coaxed to go into tje real world
. he doesnt so
,
adn finds out that he can dont anything
, be anything he wants to be
.
but he has to fight a ' matrix skipping ' bad guy
, who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him
. laurence fishburne
, his guide of sorts plays his chracter well as does keanu reeves
.
bu i sat in the theatre for over
and hour wondering where all the special effects were
. yeah there were some in the first half
bu not enough
. the trailer forthe this movie ws really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie
. now for the second half
, it isnt explosive
,
and saves the movei
. some ofthe the special effects
and fighting weere breathtaking
. the sound
, thge music
,
annd all teh effects were effective
,
and tje last hour kept us entertained
.
but with a running time of 2 hours
and 20 minutes
, this movie is at least 40 minutes too long
. one would have wished for a better ' matrix '
,
but i do have to say
, i did like it
and i was entertained
.
