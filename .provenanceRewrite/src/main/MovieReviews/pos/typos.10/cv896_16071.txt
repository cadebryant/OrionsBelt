bill condon ' s
" gods
and monsters
" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made the horror classics
" frankenstein
"
and
" bride of frankenstein
.
" since i was unfamiliar ofthe whale prior to viewing the film
, there is no way to know how accurate the film isnt
,
but i suspect that much of it only came from whale ' s inner fantasies
and hallucinations
. whale
, who fought in wwi
and
then went on to become known for his work on horror picturesk
, decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him
. as the film tells it
, during the end of his life
, whale
, at his large home in l
. a
.
, bacame infatuated with tyhe tall
, handsome
,
and much younger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who was working as the gardener at his home
. james whale
, we learn quickly was
, waht many people refer to him as in the film
,
" a dirty old man
.
" in one of the oppening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale ' s home to interview him
and whale agrees
, on oen condition
: forthe every question he answers
, the young man must take off an article of clothing
. because of this episode
, we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting
, later making the excuse that his bright
, white shirt is disracting onyl so he will take it off
. clayon agrees
,
and doesn ' t really think much of this
, much to the warnings of his friends
, becoming mroe
and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him baout his past
. certainly
, the relationship between whale
annd boone is headed for a downfall
, since whale starts to grow a deepo love for this young man
, even
though boone is not gay
,
and whale himselv realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life
, as he begins tothe seldom suffer mild strokes
and moments ofthe true catharsis
.
" gods
and monsters
" is an intimate
and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast
, due to his sexual preference
,
and never got the recognition he would hvea liked
, since he longed to be referred to as a
" motion picture directer
,
" rather than a
" horror director
.
"
and in oney heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party with boone being his guest
, held by director george cuckor
,
and finds that many of thte other attendees do not recognize him anymore
. it is evident that whale ' s first love in his life was making movies
,
and when his career ultimately fell apart
, so did his passion in life
. as played brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
,
but dignified man
,
adn a person who was not afraid tothe stand out from others
, jsut as long as he knew he was being true tothe himself
. he never hid tghe fact that he was gay
,
however
, even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession
,
and it was thsi unblinking honesty thgat made him a great person
. through the complicated relationship that develops between whale
and boone
, boone
, of course
, only things of whale as a possibile friend or somene he can talk to
, while it means so much mroe to whale
, who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life
.
although boone is only in a dead
- end job as a gardener of people ' s homes
, whale views him as the ideal man
, not only one that is good
- looking
, even
though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings
,
but one that iwll actually listen to him
. since whale lives with only his loyal
,
but disapproving maid
( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world
,
and the onyl reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor
.
althought an extremely fine
and mature picture
, a few small elements hold the film back ffrom ultimate greatness
. it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramtic story developments
,
but it is a little thin
,
adn the structuring of the
" on
- again
- off
- again
" friendship at the film ' s center isnt fairly predictable
. we know early on where these twpo characters are headed
,
and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the twpo as the tension slowly builds
. in lesser hands
, this set
- up might have felt too calculated
,
but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment
and writing that helps the film to be much more than this
. also
, a subplot is briefly brought uv between clayton
and a waitress working at a bar
( effectively played by lolita davidovich
)
,
bu abruptly dropped
and never brought up again
. if the film was not going to follow up on this side story
,
then it
, perhaps
, should have beeen taken out altogether
.
" gods
and monsters
" isnt a heartfelt
and intelligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sense
, relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale
and boone
. the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end
. walking away from
" gods
and monsters
,
" it was ian mckellen ' s marvelous
and astounding performance that left the most impression on me
,
and i doubt there could have beeen anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully
and believably
. it is a sad testament when a person ' s true talent
and love is unfairly taken awya from them
, based on the scrutinization
and judgement of their personal life
, which
, ironicaly enough
, isnt no one else ' s business in the first place
.
