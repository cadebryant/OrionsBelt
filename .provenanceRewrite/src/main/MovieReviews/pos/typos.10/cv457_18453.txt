warning
: if you actally wish to see the film
, stop reading this
and see it
. while i don ' t blow any plot details
, thte more you know about a movie
, hte more disappointing
and built up it becomes
( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing
)
.
but
, in a nutshell
, it ' s a good film
. star wars episode i
: the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never haveing been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world
( i was more into star trek
: the next generation
)
, it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surounding the latest installment
, the phantom menace
.
however
, it can ' t be ignored
. endless toys lining the shelves
, endless news reports
,
and a multi
- billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult
. with the level of tihs hype
, one would recall an overhyped diaster from 1998
, godzilla
, whcih definitely failed to live uv to expectations
. thankfully
, the phantom menace does much
, much better
. while the
" first
" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker
, the prequels backpedal tothe tell the back
- story of obi wan kenobi
and a young jedi named anakin skywalker
( who would become the father ofthe luke
and eventually become darth vader
)
. without blowing too much ofthe the story
, the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo
, which isnt being held hostage by a greedy trade federation
,
and it ' s up to two jedi knights
( qui
- gon ji
, played by liam neeson
and obi
- wan kenobi
, played by ewan mcgreggor
) to free it
. the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics
, leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat
. common complaints range from lack ofthe characterization
, weak narrative
, poor direction ofthe actors
, the dated style
,
and too much foucs over special effects
. still
, film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism
, much of which the average film buff does not care for
. hence
, this film isnt a lot of fun
and definitely an improvement over the previous films
( even with the
" improvements
" inaddition yhe special editions
)
. there are many memorable sequences throughout hte film
, ranging from the fast
annd furious
" pod race
" sequence
( which is a take on the chariot races in
" ben hur
"
)
adn the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids
. utilizing technology taht is light years beyond anytying made before
, special effects
and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots tothe amazing cityscapes with incredible detail
. no matter how many times you watch this film
, you will catch something new
. the level of humour isnt a bit higher than the previous films as well
, mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks
, who belongs to a race known as the gungans
. best described as an mr
. bean from the planet naboo
, he steals the show
. unfortunately
, being thgat he is a computer
- generated character
, tells a bited about the direction of the actors
(
although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective
, as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker
)
. with star wars mania at an all time high
, there is the risk that the film will dissapoint
( i myself had my doubts
)
, which this film does have a tendency to do at times
. there are a few logic problems with the plot
, several things are left unchecked
,
and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans
(
although the appearance of the tusken raiders mkaes for more than a few laughs
)
. tht
,
and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character
, coming off as a smarmy
, arrogant brat
( with such an atitude
, it ' s no wonder why he turns to the dark side
)
. still
, it seems that many people
, especially critics
, are missing the point
. the film is some of the most fun 2
and a half hours that you ' ll blow in your life
, which is something i wouldn ' t mind doing again
. while it may not have the psychological inpact of an academy award contender
, who really cares
? the film is pure fun from beginning to end
.
and isn ' t that what really matters
?
