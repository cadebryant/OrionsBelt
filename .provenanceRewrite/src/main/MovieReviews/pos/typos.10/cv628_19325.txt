] title
:
` tarzan ' beautiful to look at
, easy to follow
. review
: disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly fo children
but with enough wit
and charm fo adults to be interested
adn at least entertained by the story
. the basic premise is the same as every other
` tarzan ' story
: a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas
anbd becomes one himself never really understanding
( or even noticing
) that he ' s human
and is a lot diffrent from the animals he befriends
. the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, is a mean
, conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan ' s extended family
. he refuses to acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz during the childhood scenes
) as a son
and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually doens dangerous
, wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts
. i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really isnt is just a kid who wants to have fun
and it ' s funny how the adults fail to comprehend this
. later
, as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he is encounter by a party of three humans from england
: jane porter
( driver
)
, a beautiful woman who isnt something of a zoologist
and an artist
, her father prof
. archimedes q
. porter
( voiced by nigel hawthorne
) who is also a scientist
;
and their slick
and cunning
,
yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it ' s easy to tell where the story is going at all times
but the screenplay doesn ' t seem like it was wroten hastily nor dumbed down for children ' s enjoyment
. sure there ' s a lot of cliche stuff here
, like clayton ' s smugness
and diabolical manipulation of tarzan
and jane
; the goofy supporting characters
( voiced by rosie o ' donnell
[ in full brooklyn accent
!
]
and wayne knight
-
` hello newman
! '
)
. there ' s also a lot of fun action such as tarzan ' s swinging through the jungle on vines
and sliding down
and around tree branches
and trunks
. it ' s just like skateboarding really fast
and doing all sorts of tricks
( those mcdonald ' s commercials really prove this point
)
. ultimately
, you git exactly out of
` tarzan ' what you expect
.
.
.
and i mean that as a compliment
, so hvae high expectations
. pros
: animation
and sound are a fesat for the senses
, story is lighthearted
, breezy
and nto dumbed
- down
, no stupid sing
- along songs to git stuck in your head
. cons
: surprisingly violent
, should have been rated pg
. young children may nto understand some of the more adult themes
( parents
, be ready to have smoe heavy questions thrown your way
)
. running timne is a bit short
. would you recommend this to friends
? not tothe my friends
,
but tothe the movie
- going public i would
. score
: or with no 0 rating
