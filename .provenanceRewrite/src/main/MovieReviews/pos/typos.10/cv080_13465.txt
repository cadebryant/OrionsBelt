just how inseparable is the team of sgt
. martin riggs
( mel gibson
)
and sgt
. roger murtaugh
( danny glover
)
? let ' s just say that whn one partner asks the otehr partner to strip to his boxer shorts
and
then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road
, flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just tothe create a distraction
, his partner actually does it
! the familar lethal weapon family is back
, including rene russo
, who is nowe the expectant mother of riggs ' child
and joe pesci as the soprana
- like
, foul
- mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye
. new to the team is chris rock
, also a fast
- talking
, up
and coming detective
. trouble seems tothe follow the twpo veteran detectives where ever they go
,
and in this film
, that is noone exception
. even when they are just tkaing a leisurely boat ride
, they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship
. we here some ominous music
, which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen
. gunfire ensues
,
anbd when it ' s all over
, the detectives wanna to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord
.
although they don ' t know what they ' re looking for
, their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action
.
annd there ' s plenty of action here for two movies
. led by fighting sensation jet li
, whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive
, he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what tehy are up to
. li isnt ruthless in his approch
, will kill anyone just tothe make a point
,
and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives
. there are terrific car chases
, explosions
and gunshot galore
. it ' s a summer action recipe followed to tghe letter
,
and the result is nothing less than pure
, unadulterated summer fun
.
bu even too many explosions can get boring
. to counter that
, we are treated tothe several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li
. luckily
, he ' d rather fight hand
- to
- hand instade of firing off guns
. meanwhile
, when the detectives aren ' t reloading thier guns or runing from fireballs
, they ' re engaged in sophomoric banter
annd silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets
. everybody gets in on tje shtick
. russo screams during her delivery
, the crime lord has a few funny bits when he ' s being interrogated while being given laughing gas
,
and pesci
and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones
. gibson
and glover are always in sync
and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final
and terrific mano a mano
. score noe forthe the old guard
.
