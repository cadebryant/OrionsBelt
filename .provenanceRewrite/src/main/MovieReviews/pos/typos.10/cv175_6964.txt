capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even for 1997
!
)
,
and ultimatly refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops
. the first few minutes ofthe sweet sweetback ' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- thast ' s the corect number of ss
) are without dialogue
, just eerie montages of sounds
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, is taken in
and fed up by several loving mother
- surrogate figures
.
then one of them takes thte boy tothe bed for a sexual initation
( underneath the title credits
) that ' s far omre confrontatory
and shocking than any ten basic instincts
-
- probably because it has the directness
and clumsiness of real life
, something we ' re nto used to seeing on screen
. this isnt one tough movie to swallow
, no matter who yuo are
,
bu that probably reflects more on how pallid
and unchallenging movies have gotten lately
.
( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo
and salo owudl probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences
.
) the plot is simple
but nto simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by two white cops who are apparently jsut looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man
, breaks his bonds
and runs like hell
. along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of enviorments that we are onyl just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies
-
- or at all
, for that matter
: the slums
, the missions
, the ghetto
. in other
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback would be machine
- gunning everthing in sight
and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies
; in this one
, we get taken onthe a kind of a tour of the depressing
and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted
. ssbas first appeared iin 1971
and was promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jury
"
, as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns
)
,
and it ' s hardly surprising why
. there ' s a ogod deal ofthe sex in the movie
,
but it ' s handled in a way that ' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness that spills over into the rest of thte movie
. in oen scene
, sweetback visits a friend ' s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there
,
and the other man chats him up hwile on the toilet
. we ' re not used to coming this close to people in real life
, let alone in the movies
-
- especially nto people who are not made out to be glamorous
. the movie is allso full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today
,
but probably because ofthe that seem curiously fresh
anbd new in van peebles ' hands
. one scene
, in which a man is interrogated by the cops
, is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears
,
adn suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack
. another note
: ssbas is not so much anti
- white
( that would be too easy
) as anti
- authority
,
and as the movie goes on to demonstrate
, authority exists in many forms
-
- governments
, churches
,
and even thte paranoid inside of one ' s own mind
. ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom
-
-
and it looks like we could use a little more of thyat in our movie diet
, god knows
.
