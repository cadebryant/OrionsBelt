as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it
, the moreso pleased i was when i left
. first
, getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz
:
" if ytou liked scream
, you ' ll love wild things
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning performance
!
"
" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days
!
"
( oh yeah
, the day a newspaper uses theese is the day neve campbell falls in love with me
) now
, onto more serious stuff
(
and with this film
, i mean that infront nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild things has single
- handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa
. i ' m not saying that in a bad way
,
but when you see this film
, you may be shocked by what you see
.
however
, perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film ' s charming cast
and tricky plot
, that they let the film slide with an r rating
. being mormon
, i ' m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film
. trouble is
, i have already seen it
.
and i like it
! wild things is a film noir of the 90s
, filled with 40s sensibilities
,
and
yot breaking the rules
and modern
- day taboos of 90s culture
. the stlye inspite which it is filmed is rich in color
. the actors are all gorgeous people
, seemingly drawn from the same gene pool
and placed into this film
. sure
, it ' s all too good to be true
,
bu ain ' t it fun to watch
? when movies like this come along
( sort of a better version of basic instinct
) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it
. there will be people who don ' t wnat to admit liking what they see
,
bu i tell you
, most anyone who sees this will like it
. wild thnigs begins at blue bay high skool
, teh one high skool in the world that any teenager would love to get into
. it ' s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance
( totally based on looks alone
)
. of course
, there are those select few who may look slightly ugly
,
but compared tothe the averege person
, they are gorgeous
. immidately
, the film finds its tone
and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time
. we can turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. while you may be expecting one thign tothe happen
, it certainly doesn ' t turn out that way
. the film begins in a classroom
, with nearly all the main characters present
. there ' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor for the students
. he ' s heading the class discussion
. there ' s also kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who has fallen in loev with sam
. teaching the class
,
however
, are two policemen
: ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who want to talk about ' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
) '
.
" what is a sex crime
?
" ray asks
.
" not gettin ' any
!
" one student responds
. this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch
.
howver
, upon hearing this
, one student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, stands up
and leaves the room
, commenting thta they can both kiss part of her body
.
and so
, wild things sets into motion
. quicklyu
, kelly begins hiting on sam
,
but sam doesn ' t want anything to do with her advances
. kelly is stubborn
and continues to pursue him
. she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep
. surprisingly
, that ' s really all i can tell you about thge plot
. any more would give away one ofthe the many crucial plot twists
.
and what ' s more
, these plot twists are actually unpredictable
. going along the way of scream
, wild things maintains that film ' s surprises
,
and
then adds even moreso to them
. there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen
.
and even
though you think you may get tired of them
, the surprises are so genuine that it ' s rather pleasing
. going back over them in my mind
, nearly all of them work
,
though some stretch the boundaries of belief
. thankfully
, the convoluted plot doesn ' t give us much time to think about each one
, pouncing
yet anyother twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off
. as for the critics who complain that tghe film isnt trashy
-
- well
, it is
. this is pretty much just one trashy film
.
howver
, it is the kind of trashy that isn ' t hard to watch
. it ' s good trash
, in a sense
. one
, the screenplay knows that it ' s nto to be taken seriously
,
adn it includes a lot of humor
and satire into the story
. this varies everywhere fomr kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who is more of a charicatoor of rich people
, all the way to an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace to cover an insurance scam he is running
. bill murray also provides the best character in the film
,
and most of teh genuine laughs
.
and twpo
, the sex is more than gratuitous
,
although not unwelcomed
. wild things is supposed to have sex in it
( what film wtih that title wouldn ' t
?
)
,
and this movie breaks the boundries
. instead of haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it also includes lesbian scenes bewteen denise richards
annd neve campbell
( don ' t worry
.
.
. it ' s not as graphic as you might think
)
. the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic
,
but tje surprise shocker is kevin bacon ' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it ' s very brief
, so if you blink
, you may miss
( ahem
) it
.
adn
, for as long as i can remember
, i don ' t think i have seen an r
- rated film show an erect one before
( it ' s not completely
,
but judging from the audiences ' reaction
, it was omre than they expected too
)
. also
, during noe scene late in the film
, there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon
and dillon ' s characters
,
but nothing came of it
( makes you wonder if the director had to cutted it in order fo the r rating
, or if the actors refused to do it
)
. what first made me want to see wild things was its cast
. neve campbell
, of course
, has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released
. here
,
however
, she turns every typical role she has done on its head
and plays a gothic pothead
. the closest role to this was her performance in the craft
(
though even inthe thgat she was a nice girl
)
. campbell is probably the best in yhe film
and shows her wide range of talent
. you can tell she will be around for a long tyme
. denise richards will also be around fo a long time
,
although she may be limited to the roles without much range
. here
, she gets to express omre emotions than in her stiff
(
yet effective
) performance in starship troopers
. hopefully one day she will land a very good role tath can display her ability
.
and
then there is daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer to the movies
. she gives a very ogod performance
,
although her character isnt mostly left to the background forthe the firt hour
and a half
. towards the end she does get a bigger part
. on the male side
, matt dillon is probably the best
, giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist
. kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character
,
but he makes the most of it
. you must have admiration
,
though
, for what he did on screen
.
and judging ffrom many of the women ' s reactions in the theater to that shot
, they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon
( yeah
, right
)
.
and
then there is bill murray
. his performance is the comic relief
,
and he nearly steals the film
. as a whole
, the entire cast works wondrously toghether
,
and they seem at home
, even when doing thge menage a troi
. director john mcnaughton
, who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works
. his direction is smooth
and stylish
. the visuals are striking
, filled with rich colors
,
and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air
.
however
, he seems more at home when the actors aren ' t talking
. his fly
- by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant
,
and his photography of denise richards ' climbing outloud of the pool is a highlight
. the cinematography is gorgeous in its details
. its not often that you see a film like this
,
and we should watch it just to see how teh camera can take pictures
.
then
, there isnt the music
. this was probably tje most obvious thing to me
, as it set the perfect mood for the film
. it ' s hard to describe in words
, so just see the film
and listen to it
. it ' s wonderfully composed
and presented
.
and be sure to stick around during the closing credits
! mcnaughton has finally put thge ending credits to good use
( while most comedies use it for outtakes
)
. he has included some small scenes which help explain tghe preceeding events
. some may say that these are lame attempts to expalin the convoluted plot
,
but it ' s an entertaining way to finish the film
. plus
, there are smoe shocking moments in these ending credits whitch just add to the fun
. wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality
, nudity
, language
and violence
. again
, the nudity is rather unnecessary
,
but let ' s face it
-
- people want to see it
. so why not give it to them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, has a no
- nudity clause in her contract
,
and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off
( way to go
, neve
!
)
. the sex scenes are graphic
, expecially the first one we see
, between the mother
and one ofthe her deck hands
. one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating
. tjhe langauge is quite harsh too
, ranging from sexual innuendo to your average
, everyday profanity
.
and i can ' t stress it enough
: don ' t allow kids under 18 to see this film
. the target age for the movei is the 18
- 24 range
,
and that ' s who should see it
. it ' s definitely not for those under 18
! did i mention that this film is rated r
?
howver
, fo those that do get a chance to watch it
, you will probably more likely be pleased
,
and may even take friends to see it the next time
.
