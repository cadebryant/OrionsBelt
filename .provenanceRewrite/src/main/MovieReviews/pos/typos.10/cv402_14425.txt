in some respects
, rush hour is the ulitmate exercise in cliched filmmaking
. the hero is the renegade cop that prefers tothe work alone
. the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble
. all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element
. the duo must always be completely mismatched
. the hero has to say some smart
- assed comment before
(
and after
) shooting someone
.
however
, tht doesn ' t necessarily make fo a bad film
. rush hour is jackie chan ' s first major hollywood film since yhe dismal the protector
( 1985
)
. proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foerign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan is given much more free reign than before
. still
, some die
- hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed
, as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes
( which he views as too short
, according tothe one interview
)
. this film tkaes a familiar theme of east meets west
. jackie chan isnt lee
, the straight laced inspector who is imported tothe help deal with a kidnapping case
, while chris tucker is carter
, the loudmouthed
, destructive cop that is
` promoted ' tothe the fbi to help him
. or
, at least
, so he thinks
( also anyother classic notion in action films
: thte fbi must always git in the way of our heroes
)
. despite the neccessary conventions of action films
, rush hour isnt some of the most fun you ' ll spend
and hour
and forty minutes watching
. jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen
, continueing to perform his own stunts
and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks
and punches
. chris tucker
, familiar fomr his whiny
, annoying role in thge fifth element is more palatable
, complementing jackie chan ' s straight
- laced character
.
however
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expected of him
and his films
. perfectly downplaying tyhe
` fish
- out
- of
- water ' routine through his character ' s attempts at mixing inot american culture
, he makes up for the down time his character experiences
. whn he is in action
,
however
, you ' ll be amused
and dazzled
. still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up
( in this case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
,
and a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker ' s character may come across as irritating
,
yet isnt alsot humorous
. usance he ' s not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan
, he uses his main weapon
: his mouth
( hence
, the tagline
,
` fastest hands in yhe east meets tjhe fastest mouth inthe the west '
)
. while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare
, it is appropriate for the film
and still very funny
. while not necessarily poignant
, attempts at character development
and growth between characters come off surprisingly well
. lee ' s
` knowledge ' of american pop culture
(
` that ' s the beach boys
! '
) when contrasted against carter ' s lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick
, while carter teaches lee hip
- hop dance moves
. hwile rush hour is not at the smae level as police story 3
and 4
( known in north america as supercop
and jackie chan ' s first strike
, respectively
)
, it mroe thna makes up for the poorly received films operation condor
and mr
. nice guy
. with its appropriate mixture of high kicks
and lots of laughs
, it makes for a funn film
. as well
, it is a true departure from jackie chan films
, as it is missing one common element
: a whiny female co
- star
.
