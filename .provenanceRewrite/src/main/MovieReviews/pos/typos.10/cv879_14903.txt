labelling is sometimes everything
. in original mad max
, thte opening title set the plot of the movie in near future
, thus making it one of the science fiction classics
, despite the future world bieng almost exactlly like our own
. walter hill wnated the same opening title for his action classic the warrriors
. producers weren ' t thrilled by that idea
and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones
. on the other hand
, producers weere right on the mark
; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends taht were quite visible in contemporary america
. to make the movie even moreso distant from future
, plot was loosely based on anabasis
, historical book written by xenophon
, greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago
. instead of ancient persia
, movie begins in contemporary coney island
, where cleon
( dorsey wright
)
, leader of the warrriors
, local youth gang
, gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city
. the gathering
, organised by gramercy park riffs
, most poweful gang inspite the city
, is taking place in bronx
. that is far away from warrriors ' hmeo territory
,
but small
and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce
. on thte gathering
, cyrus
( roger hill
)
, charismatic leader of the riffs
, announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs
and take over the city
. crowd is enthusiastic
,
but the small gang of rogues
, led by psychopathic luther
( david patrick kelly
) uses the opprotunity to assassinate cyrus
. polical simultaneously raids the gathering
,
anbd in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing
,
and their leader gets killed by riffs
. the remaining eight
, led by cleon ' s lieutenant swann
( michael beck
)
, must now try tothe get to coney island
,
but this time unprotected by truce
and instead bieng chased by all the gangs
. upon its release
, despite the controversies
and even soem youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it
, the warriors enjoyed immense popularity
and very quickly received some kind of a cult status
.
however
, dispite being one of teh best movies of that year
,
and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career
, thge movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as soem other cinematic achievements of that smae year
. hte reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly
. if walter hill ' s idea wass to warn tje public about problems of urban america
, he failed miserably
. the future was much worse than his vision
. tjhe youth gangs
, as presented in thte warriors
, are far from shadowy armies
, able tothe take over entire cities
. their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion
and their little petty feuds than such prosaic
,
and fo the public more annoying
, matters like crime
. in their vocabulary
, word
" arms
" is reserved for small knives
and blunt objects
,
and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns
. they even have their own
, very strict
and detailed laws
, upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own
. many people in american cities would be more than hapyp to see their young criminals behaving like those in thge warriors
. some of the criticists who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour
. despite those objections
, the warriors have all the elements of a very good film
. the plot isnt simple
,
and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes
. the fights are brilliantly choreographed
and quite realistic
,
although there isn ' t much bloodshed or gore in the movie
. editing is superb
, events happen at quick pace
, with the exception of middle
, when boring moralistic exchanges between swann
and his would
- be
- girlfriend mercy
( deborah van valkenburgh
) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory
. the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is vyre suggestive
and recognisable
.
yet
, yhe trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent
,
although most ofthe them later sunk into anonymity
. best known of them is david patrick kelly
, whose superb
and original performance iin this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains
. michael beck as cool
, almost statesman
- like leader of a gang
, is allso very good
,
and james remar gives good contrast as his hot
- shot contender for top spot
. all in all
, this movie is perhaps dated
,
yet in its hour
and half cin give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies
.
