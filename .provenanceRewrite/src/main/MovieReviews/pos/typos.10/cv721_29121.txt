it ' s hard not to recommend
" the others
.
" the supernatural thriller
, written
and directed by alejandro amen
? bar
(
" open your eyes
"
)
, adroitly establishes
and maintains a low
- key atmosphere of menace
. the cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, is as ogod as i have ever seen
and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances
.
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish
adn the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied
. overall
, thte film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old
" twilight zone
" episodes where the characters spend a great dael of time wandering about looking afraid
and disoriented
, only to learn tehy are actually a child ' s toy
, a military test subject or a department store dummy
. watching those vintage shows
and listening to the players chatter
, i always wanted to shout
,
" git on with it
!
" as much as i appreciated the atmosphere
and acting in
" hte others
,
" my reaction was much tje same
. set at an island mension off the caost of england during world war ii
, the story focuses onthe grace
( kidman
)
, who tends to her children anne
( alakina mann
)
and nicholas
( james bentley
)
anbd worries baout her husban
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne
and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity
adn grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors
, protecting the little ones ffrom excess light by making sure thta only one door is open at a time
. at the beginning of the film
, three servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
,
and mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an aging gardener
, join the family
. the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first
,
but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not
. to mkae matters worse
, the children are upset
: nicholas isnt unusually jittery
and anne claims to be seeing ghosts
. grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her hmeo
, only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them
. that ' s essentially the whole story
, with the tension growing until the pivotal moment wehn everything becomes clear
. earlier
, there isnt an outstanding scene where grace darts outside
, only tothe be enveloped in fold affter fold of shimmering fog
. the visuals in the otherworldly sequence
, courtesy of aguirresarobe
, are simply astounding
. i also enjoyed the presence of religion
, a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural
. grace is a christian
and answers her children ' s questions about life
adn death with the assurance of a devout worshiper
. when mother is away
,
though
, the kids speculate whther her statements are fact or folklore
, just as real children do
.
but those nice touches fail to enliven a film tht is too slow or make up for a lackluster endig
.
" the others
" sets outloud to be a classic ghost story
,
but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist
.
