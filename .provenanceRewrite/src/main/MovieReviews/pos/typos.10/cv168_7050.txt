larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar
and the owner
/ publisher ofthe the multi
- million dollar hustler publications company
. the people vs
. larrry flynt is the story of larry flynt ' s fight for the freedom to circulate
and sell his pornographic magazine
, hustler
. based on a true story
, the film is almost a documentery in that it ' s a very vivid
and detailed look at larry flynt ' s life
. woody harrelson gives an excellent performance
. he conveys flynt ' s peculiarities
and his character with depth
and focus
. by the end of the film the audience ctually finds themselves
, somewhat grudgingly
, liking larry flynt
. this is some feat given flynt ' s apparent lack of any morals or ethics
and his extremely smutty
and childish behaviour inwhich court
.
however
, flynt has a number of things going fo him
, he ' s rich
, he ' s funny
,
and most importantly
, he says exactlly what he means
. larry flynt ' s wief
, althea leasure is played by courtney love
. larrry meets althea at one of his clubs
,
and they fall in love
( a vrey sexual
and ope lvoe
)
. both of them indulge in a world of too much sex
,
and eventually too much drugs
. flynt hadnt been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down
( which was especially upsetting for him
) by an assassin
. althea had joined him in taking the drugs
. following an operation flynt decides to stpo taking drugs
, althea does not have any such plans
, nor the determination to follow them
. as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail
and sick
. courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea ' s situation
, as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect
. it ' s extrememly sad to watch althea literally wither away
. edward norton plays flynt ' s lawyer
, alan isaacman
. again
, tihs is a solid performance
. the audiance finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt ' s courtroom antics
. flynt is not only childish in the courtroom
,
but downright rude to the judges
,
and lands himself in a lot of trouble
(
anbd even iin a mental institution
) beccause of it
. isaacman is very easy tothe like
,
and great at proving
( in qtuie clever ways
) his points to the court
. milos forman has done a great job inspite directing the people vs
. larry flynt
. it is not really an exciting or thrilling film
,
but instead a highly intresting portrayal of a true story
. due to larry ' s charactor it is also
, at times
, a very funny film
.
however
, it is much mroe than that
. it is about the fight for freedom ofthe speech
, anti
- censorship
,
and the right tothe be able choose for oneself what to see
and buy
. an excellent look at flynt
, his life
,
and his story
. keep a look out fo teh rela larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey
.
