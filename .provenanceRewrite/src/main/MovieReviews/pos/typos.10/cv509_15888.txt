as i write the review for the newyorker hanks
/ ryan romantic comedy you ' ve got mial
, i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer
and sending it a billion miles away on the internet
. i am also aware that i have just spent tjhe last 2 housr watching the world ' s biggest paid commercial for america online
.
and i wonder
: is that so bad
? well
, tyhe commericial part is
. as for the movie
, well
, as long as i can watch tom hanks
and meg ryan
, i tihkn i ' ll be okay
. to paraphrase james berardinelli
, whose reviews i admire very much
, toom hanks
and meg ryan can act
. they are both wonderful
,
but for all of hanks ' glorious owrk in serious films
, such as his magnificent peformance in saving private ryan
,
and his glorious triumph in philadelphia
, i like him best when he ' s suitably obnoxious
. tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy whn he ' s going to get hte girl
: the only question is how
? meg ryan
, america ' s high school sweetheart
, can act
. she ' s had a handfull of memorable performances
, including the grat scene in the diner in when harry met sally
( i must not mention what she does
, due to the
, well
, um
, you get the diea
,
and if you don ' t
, get the movie
-
- fantastic
)
.
but
, i like her best when she ' s
, well
, perky
. she is so adorably perky
/ cute that together with hanks
, they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime
. smoe people have them going back to raelly old classic romantic couples
,
but i don ' t really know
. all i know is that i jstu like them both
. they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that ' s really hard to resist
,
and i ' m not going to even try
. they ' re just really
, really cute
, sweet
,
and charming
. hanks
annd ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron
, who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle
. here
, tje setup is a little different
. kathleen kelly
( ryan
) owns a small children ' s bookstore which her mother founded 42 yeras ago
adn passed down to her
. she is successful
, beautiful
,
and dates a well
- known columnist with vyre radical idea
( kinnear
)
. she is also having an affair
, of sorts
. you see
, kathleen
, with the handle shopgirl
, is secretly emailing ny152
. they have a strictly un
- detailed relationship
: there are no specifics
,
and they have no idea who eahc otehr is
. ny152 happens to be joe fox
( hanks
)
, a multimillionaire bookseller who isnt hte heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega
- bookstores
, run by his father
( coleman
)
. fox books has decided to open a store on the west side
, right across from a little children ' s bookseller named
" shop around the corner
"
, run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly
. every morning
, these two email each other silly
,
and every day
, they fight
" to the death
!
!
"
. it ' s a charming premise
,
and one thyat works nicely
, balancing tyhe immense toubles kathleen is inspite with the romance she wants to have
. it also has thge great sense of being a classic romance
: htere is no
" let ' s have sex tonight
" mantra
, if you ' ll excuse my bluntness
. this is a solid romance built around tht vague concept of love
. hmm
. well
, the movie goes through twists
and turns
, having some sad moments
and happy ones
, until at one moment tom hanks
and meg ryan
" hook up
"
, to use modern terminology
,
and kiss their way into happiness
. you know it ' s gogin to happen
, the question is now
? thankfully
, ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
,
and a host of others
, including a great scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
and two sweet kids
. it ' s all cute
and wonderful
,
and for all of the idealism
, it makes me feel ogod
. hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside
and as warm on the inside as he always isnt
. he is
, i believe
, america ' s greatest actor
. does he show it here
? nah
.
but he ' s still tom hanks
,
and she ' s still meg ryan
. which is what this movie boils down to
. it ' s pure confection
. all the bits about the godfather
, the jokes
, the superb script
, it ' s all really sweet
. there are some immense flaws
, like pacing
. the lastest third of the movie really doesn ' t work as well as i would have liked
,
and for a rumatic comedy
, it ' s slow
. once hanks knows the secret
, it gets really slow
. i even looked at my watch a couple times
, to make sure ephron wass going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for
, so that i could get home at a reasonable hour
. the other problem is that this movie is shaping uv to be relaly dated
. e
- mail
? wehn my kids are my age
, i don ' t know what we ' ll be using
.
but hanks can do more with oen eyeroll than anybody
,
and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history
. they just work together
,
and it ' s nice to see
. it gives you
, well
, a smile
. teh script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious
,
and that always come at tghe exact right tiem to keep the audience awake
. i was arguing with my father onthe the drive back home on what the purpose of movies ws
. i ' ve always beleived that movies are very powerful
, very powerful indeed
. you see
, mankind has three abilities he needs to survive
: the ability tothe tihkn
, entertain
,
and procreate
. movies can definitely do the first two
,
and as for the third
, well
, i ' d rather not think about that
. i alwyas thought films that made you tihkn enlightened you
and made you see something fomr another viewpoint
,
and that films that entertained you were good
, becuase you forgot about your troubles
and thought about something nice for a night
.
and i was thinking about how increadible a year tom hanks has had
. hanks was the driving force behind one of the year ' s best films in saving private ryan
, which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world
. he ' s also half of the glue behind the year ' s best example of pure entertainment
. tom hanks
and meg ryan are magical
, as is this movie
. it ' s a sweet
, lovely affair whith a technology twist
. it may be a long commercial
,
but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face
.
