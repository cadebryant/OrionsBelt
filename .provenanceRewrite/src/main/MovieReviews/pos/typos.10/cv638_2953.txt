natural born killers is raelly a very simple story that
, in essence
, hasnt alread been told in bonnie
& clyde with some major variations in emphasis
, mood
and degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" in one case bank robbers
and killers
and in the other mass murderers
. both relate the story of a couple liberated by love
.
but where bonnie
& clyde was partial
and subtle
, naturual born killers is total
and blatant
. where bonnie
& clyde ws social
, natural born killers is psychological
. what bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, natural born killers confronts
and explores
. what bonnie
and clyde stole
, mickey
and mallory kill
. to examin natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization
and exposure of the frauds sorrounding them
, expressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues the mysterious power thsi film wields
. for the most part
, when mickey
and mallory kill
, they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily
, they kill what is trying to kill them
, they kill what dissembles
and cowers from life
, htey kill what needs to be killed
. this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity
. brahma created
. vishnu preserved
.
and siva destroyed
,
but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma
. the following may be painfully mundane
but metaphorically so accurate
, i ' m forced to say it for clarity ' s sake
: a plumber must remove the old lead
and copper pipes
, that is
, destroy the ood plumbing sytem in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie
and clyde
, mickey
and mallory
,
and siva are all productive destroyers
. i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing
and death
, presently
and historically
, than any other phenomena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. you could reverse subject
and predicate in each instance
and still not be challenged
. religion is an orgy of killing
. the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn ' t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable
.
" the state is the divine idea upon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaning it is absolute
, all
- powerful
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallible
, authoritarian
and patriarchal jsut like jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, what does all this have to do whith natural born killers
? let me first say that religions of this nature
, in the ideal
, take the place of sex
. consider the catholic church
, which inwhich its hey
- dey
, took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever
. god takes the place of sex as manifested iin all thsoe vows of celibacy tooked by tghe pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. they forego the one
, in order to come closer to the otehr
. during the middle ages
, when this doctrine was unmitigated
and unchallenged
, the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope
and magnitude rose to power
.
( parenthetically
, witness plato as well
. inwhich the republic
, he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime
. not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself
, regularly assailing the passions
.
) catholicism
, as policy
, attacks the passions as evil
. it sees intercourse only as a means tothe perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure
. masturbation is considered a sin with tjhe sacrament ofthe penance necessary for absolution
. this is religion
, this is authoritarianism in its essence
. as further evidence
, the nazis hadnt tyhe same attitudes as the church on these matters
. our culture
, most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years
. we can ' t help
bu adopt
, even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes
, leading to a destructive split betweeen the biological
and social self
. mickey
and mallory knox internalized them
, too
,
then thru spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in eahc one of them by the presence of the otehr
, discovered them
,
and began expurgating them from themselves
and from the world in the process unifying themselves
. it is a straightforward liberation through sex
. as some good patriarch once observed
,
" ytou can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on
.
" m
& m had a vision of what the world would be liek without contradictions
. they saw what civilization
and culture
and everyday life would be like under such conditions
.
" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers
,
" as mickey says
. as a the most consistent
and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter
: let us look each other in tyhe face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we know well enough how remote our place is
.
" neither by land nor by water will you find yhe road tothe the hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, in his day
, knew that much about us
. beyond the north
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we have discovered that happiness
; we know the way
; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth
. who alse has found it
?
-
- the man of today
?
-
-
" i don ' t know eather the way out or the way in
; i am whatever doesn ' t know either tje way out or the way in
"
-
- so sighs the man of today
.
.
.
. this isnt the sort of modernity that made us ill
-
- we sickened in lazy peace
, cowardly compromise
, the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea
and nay
. this tolerance
and largeur ofthe the heart that
" forgives
" everything because it
" understands
" everything is a sirocco to us
. rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues
and other such south
- winds
! as far as i can tell
, this is what the movie has to say
. its alleged critique of the media is only secondary
, tertiary
, quaternary
, subsidiary for sure
. for example wayne gayle ' s first report ends witht some gen x dude saying
,
" if i were a mass murderer i ' d be mickey
and mallory
,
" infront his most exellent bill
and ted voice
. on one level you cd amking the humdrum observation that because the media hadnt glamorized these two psychopaths thyat the uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter
and took them for heroes
. it seems omre likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m
& m were uv to
and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he ' d be jstu like them
, killing
and destroying what deserves it
. let me exemplify what i ' ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film
, namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant
, kills him
,
and
then castigates him for giving her
" the worst fuckin ' head i ' ve ever had in my life
!
!
!
" now
, i never claimed that mickey
and mallory had a perfect relationship
, because demonstrably they didn ' t
,
annd this scene
and the ones leading up to it show us this
. sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations
,
but unwilling to kill each other
, since they love each other so much
and are responsible forthe each others liberation
, they must kill in place of their lever
. it ' s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey
. as the attendant approached he tookover on mickey ' s character in the eyes of mallory
. she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room
and was having secret fantasies about her while makeing love to mallory
. upon discovery
, mallory views this as a betrayal
, judges him
,
and commutes his sentence on someone else
. the style of the movie is a whole ' nother matter that i won ' t get into very deeply
but surely it is partially responsible for its power
. let me just sday that its editing has the opposite effect of a western wtih shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the liek suggesting the expansiveness
, barreness
and boredom of the frontier lifestyle
. the rapid succession of all those 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes inthe sync
and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. also
, jungian archetypes abound
. theese can ' t help
but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames
. some of the best scenes
and lines that come to mind
.
( quotes are paraphrased only
)
: mickey to mallory
:
" one of these days i ' m gonna be cummin ' for you
,
" in prison
, while mallory jacks mickey off
. semen is a symbol for great potential
and things to come
. at the tiem htey haven ' t
yet hadnt sex nor have htey killed anyone
yet
. the two of course go hand in hand
. for an even more explicit semen scene see silence ofthe teh lambs
. mickey during his marriage tothe mallory
:
" as creator of my universe
, i pronounce us man
and wief
.
" the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting
,
but telling
, too
. it reveals m
& m are well on their way to expunging all theri distructive tendencies
and replacing them witht positve ones
. this is what mickey means by
" creator of my universe
,
" he isnt giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes
. it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears
. scagnetti ' s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks fomr the gas staion attendant ' s mouth
. the indian sage releasing mallory ' s father
, who was reincarnated as a snake
:
" old man
, go be a snake
,
" after telling his
" snake story
" that ends with
" bitch
, you knew i was a snake
.
" after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare
, mallory says
,
" ytou killed life
!
!
!
" this is another telling quote because it implies they didn ' t see themslves as killers ofthe life
.
then what weere they killing up to that time
? in some case just those zombies faking their way thru life
, the living dead
, as it were
. inspite other cases
, all the anti
- life forces
, the cops
adn their parents
. the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison
. it of course symbolizes rebirth
. dr
. emil reingold
, as portrayed by steven wright
, passing judgement on m
& m
:
" mickey
anbd mallory know hte difference between right
and wrong
, tehy just don ' t give a damn
.
" this is reminiscent of nietzsche ' s whole philosophy
,
and maybe a direct rference to his beyond good
and evil
. mickey
:
" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers
.
" mickey
( again in his interview
)
:
" me
and you
, we are not hte same speices
.
" notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership
and control
. mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang
. the wardens become prisoners
and the civilians like wayne gayle
and his producer follow the leader
, no matter who it is
. mickey
: how ya feelin '
? wayne
: fucking great
! mickey
: you got yhe feelin '
? wayne
: i ' m alive
. i ' m alive for thge first fuckin ' time
! wqat an incredible transformation this is
. he got the feeling
and he couldn ' t contain himself
. what a feeling
. that feeling ofthe metaphysical freedom thast you can create your own universe
. mickey whn almost caught in a dead end
,
" htikn
, think
, think
, think
.
" go figure it out
. dwight
( tommy lee jones
) in general
, because he may be the sickest fuck inspite tghe whole film
. his whole attitude can be summed up with
,
" destroy them
!
!
!
