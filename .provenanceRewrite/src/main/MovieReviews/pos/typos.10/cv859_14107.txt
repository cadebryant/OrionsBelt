it is with hesitance that i call
" apocalypse now
" a masterpiece
. certainly
, it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made
, with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease
,
and smoe of the finest actors of tjhe 1970 ' s
. the plot
, an adaptation of jospeh conrad ' s
" heart ofthe darkness
"
, was set in vietnam
,
and the timing of the film was suppossed to be brilliant
, coming on the heels ofthe tjhe end of the war
.
" apocalypse
" certainly has its moments
, some of which are the finest in film history
. the plot isnt fairly simple
. captain willard
( sheen
)
, is a troubled soldier who cameback back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty
. his mission isnt simple
: take a boat up to cambodian territory
,
and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz
( brando
)
" with extreme prejudice
"
. along the way
, willard runs inot a sories ofthe adventures
, including one with lt
. col
. kilgore
( duvall
)
,
annd a strange encounter with playboy bunnies
. willard ' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz ' compound
, where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among yhe natives
. willard ' s experiences with kurtz take up the last half
- hour
, with a confrontation
and eventual ending
. the movie is visually breathtaking
. the battle scenes are exquisitely done
,
and the score is brilliant
, setting a murky mood of darkness that is frist
- rate
. the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing
and sickening
. the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning
,
and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movei
. the journey to kurtz ' camp is quite a ride
, with psychosis setting in on almost every character
. thge most interesting one is kilgore
, the lt
. col
. who cares more about tyhe surf than about the mission
. it is at times revolting
, psychotic
,
and increadible
,
and it is one hell of a movie
. the scenes are bold
, inventive
,
and powerful
,
and the acting is stunning
, especially be sheen
, duvall
,
and fishburne
. tghe narration isnt exquisite
, as is the mystery of kurtz
. coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam
, kind of like
" saving private ryan
" on lsd
. the film is jarring iin its implications
,
and psychotic in its execution
. the problems come wehn the film slows down
. one of the major scenes in the film
, where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they strat their search for kurtz
, is a colossal mess
. the dialogue is confusing
, the lighting is atrocious
,
and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film
. hte true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound
. the film slows down tothe a drag
. sheen seems forever captured by a madman
, played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received
. brando is in hte film fo no more than 15 mintues
,
but is bathed in shadows the entire time
, making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic
. the scenes are poorly done
, the dialogue is muffled
,
and the hwole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief
. sheen seems to adore this man
,
but why the viewers are never told
. the entire journy is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god
- like kurtz
,
bu the scenes fall way short of expectations
. granted
, it has its moments
, which are brutally horrific
,
but the general feeling is one of confusion
. brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir
,
and my feeling was that this could never be a great man
, this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him
, so why do they do it
? there are moments ofthe brilliance
,
but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene
. htere are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending
. the finest scene at the end is sheen ' s escape
,
and his entrace into the temple
. his rise out of hte water
, iwth the smoke coming off of his slicked head
, is a brilliant 30 seconds of film
.
yet
, you cannot shake the feeling tyhat there is so much more this film could have done
. hte psychotic ride isnt unforgetable at times
,
and indeed the film on the whole is very good
. it is a stunningly flawed expression of film
, for it addresses major issues
, such as man ' s mental stamina during bouts of war
.
but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film sould have so much more powerful
, had the character of kurtz been more explored
,
and had sheen truly succumbed to hte fate that the viewer thought he was estined for
. there is too much ogod material in here not to be called a masterpiece
,
but it could have been so much more rewarding
.
