a big suprise to me
. tjhe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off
,
but making a blues brothers movei without jake blues
( john belushi
) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope
. they replaced him just fine
. not with john goodman
, he didn ' t dont much of anything
,
bu with the brilliant actor joe morton
, who can really sing
. the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant
, who ' s ten
. this wass another of my fears for the film
,
but he ' s a realy good dancer
,
and plays a mean harmonica
(
although he may have been dubbed
)
. things that intellectually had bothered me before
, like no mission from god
, everyone being richer
, it not being filmed in chicago
-
- gave me no problems at all
. i ' m quite pleased that there were less car pile
- ups
, because they meant less music
,
and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing
. there ' s a few early crashes
,
and
then one huge pile
- up
,
but after that it all stops
. it ' s just the music
. one of my problems with tyhe first isnt that cab calloway ' s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him
,
but there ' s no problems wih this
. the music is all as good as ever
, tons of great musicians showing up
-
- with the exception of johnny lang
, who can ' t sing
, all the musicians do a great job
. the only real problems i had was hte special effects
. these were superfluous
and a waste of money
. since the film isn ' t donig very well
, they could mean we have noone possibility of another sequal
, which i want to see
. the bluegrass version of riders infront the sky is even better than rawhide
.
