mary norton ' s children ' s book sories
, the borrowers
, has been made inot several below
- average television movies
. so
, i wasn ' t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big
- screen debut of the minute clan
.
but i was in for a shock
, the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs
and even some decent special effects
. the lender family is bieng thrown out ofthe their longtime home
. thier aunt
, who owned the property
, never left a wiull
. now
, an unscrupulous lawyer
, ocious potter
( john goodman
) plans tothe demolish the house
and replace it with an ultra
- modern housing development
.
bu the lenders are not alone in their house
. living under the floorboards isnt a family of borrowers
, 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human
" beans
" above
. the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders
, especially once they disover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders
. so it is uv to the clocks
( pod
( jim broadbent
)
and homily
( celia imrie
)
, along with their kids
, arrietty
( flora newbigin
)
and peagreen
( tom felton
)
) to recover the will
and savve the household
.
but when potter learns of the tiny people
, he enlists the skills ofthe exterminator jeff
( mark williams
) to kill off the clan
. there ' s plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers
, especially in the furnishings of the clock family house
, made out of lost board game parts
and credit cards
. the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story
. the various predicaments of the clock family are clever
and thrilling
. based on an original story
, the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all tghe potential
and unusual perils that could exist for a 4
- inch tall person
. as the villain
, john goodman ' s performance veers on tjhe edge of being over
- the
- top
.
but his peformance suits the role well
,
and he does very well in the film ' s many slapstick moments
. wih a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets
, bluescreen shots
and cgi
, the special effects in the borrowers are very well done
. there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work
,
bu none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspention of disbelief
. hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of bieng labeled a children
- only movie
, for it is surprisingly entertaining
and funn to watch
.
