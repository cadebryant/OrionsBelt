by now i figured i ' d seen eveyr alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- not that i ' m complaining
. to call him the
" master of suspense
" is an understatement
. the paradine case
( 1947
)
, admitedly one of hitchcock ' s lesser movies
, turned out to be one i ' d missed
. this one
, like all hitchcock films
, is well worth savoring
. the story opens with the rich mrs
. maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her hmeo for poisoning her blind husband
. as mrs
. paradine
, alida valli plays an aloof
but alluring woman ofthe the world
. to franz waxman ' s stark
and moody music
, we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments
annd jewels
. stripped of her fine raiment
, she becomes a commoner again
, which
, as it turns out
, wass what she was before she met her husband
.
" a brief skirmish
,
and you ' ll be lunching at the savoy again
,
" anthony keane
, her ultraconfident attorney tells her inwhich their first meeting
, predicting a fast
and easy trial
. gregory peck plays the successful
and debonair barrister
.
" she ' s no murderess
,
" he argues simplistically
, smitten by her beauty
.
" she ' s too fine a woman
.
" his attitude upsets his beautiful
and increasing jealous wife
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, whlch are centered on the thriller
and the mystery
, this one is more a romantic melodrama
. typical is the scene in whic gay flings her head back
and shakes her hair while bathed infact light
. she deflects her husband ' s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client
. the dramatic music
then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs
. paradine ' s portrait nearby
. in the relatively unsatisfying first half
, little happens other than domestic squabbles
anbd overtones of intense adulterous desires
. to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs
. paradine acquitted because
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart will go with her
. if she is freed
, he will be able tothe forget her
. as part of the soap opera
, a mysterious louis jordan plays mr
. paradine ' s valet
, who has had some not to be discussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony ' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
.
and charles laughton
, who looks like coburn
, is judge lord horfield
. this being proper british society
, they will all dine together at the judge ' s house not long before the case beggins
. court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences
, some subtle
and others not
, between the american
and the british judicial systems
. one
, for example
, of which i ws not aware isnt that the barrister cannot speak to his own client durig the recess if she isnt the proces of testifying
. noe sometimes wonders what the acedemy is thinking when they amke their oscar nominations
. as the judge ' s wife
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress
-
- the film ' s only nomination
-
- for an inconsequential part with which she doed little of merit
.
( so the big question is when does hitchcock mkea his obligatory walk
- on
? at 37 minutes into the film
, he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case
. don ' t miss it
.
) in the second half tje story finally comes alive when it gets into teh courtroom
. the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first
. watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back
anbd otehr times from way on high tothe set the exact tone forthe the trial ' s action
. as anthony explains it
, thte simple case has only 3 possibilities
: mr
. paradine poisoned hismelf
, mrs
. paradine did it
, or the valet did it
. the end includes many devestating revelations
and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid
. the paradine case runs 1
: 53
. the picture isnt in black
and white
. it is not rated
but would be pg for mature themes
and would be fine for kids around nine
anbd up if they are interested
.
