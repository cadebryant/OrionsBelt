, this looks like a mild
- mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight
. instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end
. the concept is deceptively pedestrian
. an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents
and encounters eccentric characters along the way
. yhe movie demonstrates just how far a good scirpt
and actors can take a mundane diea
. the son
and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman fomr the agency who located his parents
. following one dead end lead after another
, each funnier than the previous
, they eventually end up in new mexico withthe his real biological parents

. it ' s difficult to condense the mile
- a
- minute plot
. seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover fomr the last noe

, one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol
, tobacco
and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi
- sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion
.
and it ' s all done in a fairly clean
, almost
( well
, maybe not exactlly
) family fare manner
. a grand casted

, alda
, moore
, ben stiller
, patricia arquette
, tea leoni
, george segal
) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs
. drawing from a more hyper woody allen style
, the film succeeds beyond expectations
