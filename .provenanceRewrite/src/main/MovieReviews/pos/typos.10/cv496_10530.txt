when quentin tarantino made
" pulp fiction
"
, he wass not only making the greatest film of the 90s
; he was allso making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time
.
but before you send me hate
- mail for not giving that title to
" citizen kane
"
, hear me out
. much like
" citizen kane
"
,
" pulp fiction
" has changed movie making forever
.
but i thiunk the latter has had a tad more impact
.
" pulp fiction
" has actually ushered in a new era of film making
. it has altered the way films will be viewed
.
" fiction
" has spawned so many imitations
, i ' ve lost count
. sure
, some have been excellent
(
" bound
"
and
" the usual suspects
" spring immediately to mind
)
,
but any serious movie
- goer recognizes
" pulp fiction
" as the original neo
- noir of the 90s
. in this review
, i hope to change all the people ' s minds who have criticized it for it ' s excessive profanity
adn voilence
( which
, by tyhe way
, isn ' t really that graphic
)
. the most brilliant aspect of tarantino ' s masterpiece is the screenplay
. it is filled with so much classic dialogue
( the
" quarter pounder with cheese
" speech will go down in history
)
, it should be required reading for any film student
, if it isn ' t already
. the stor
( told in unorthodox non
- linear format
) centers arund three main epidsodes
, all of which eventually intertwine
. the first
, titled
" vincent vega
and marcellus wallace ' s wife
"
, deals with a very loaded john travolta
( i forgot tothe mention the cool heroin shoot
- up sequence
) taking mia wallace
( a star
- makeing performance by uma thurman
)
, his bosses wife
, out on a date tothe a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim ' s
. they talk for a while
( with the occasional
" uncomfortable silence
"
)
, mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror
. after giving marcellus ' new bride a foot massage
, he was thrown off a buiding
and into a greenhouse
, giving him a
" speech impediment
"
. they also partake in a cool dance contest
and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic
" you never can tell
"
. i won ' t reveal the rest of the story
,
but i ' ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night
, despite tyhe cool trophy they win
. the second story
( the least of the three
but still four stars
) stars bruce willis
( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the
" die hard
" flicks
) as boxer butch coolidge
. previously inwhich the film
( like i said
, it ' s told in non
- linear form
)
, he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall inthe a match
. as it turns out
, he not only doesn ' t take the fall
,
but he ends up actually killing his opponent
. he takes a cab to his half
- witted girlfriend ' s apartment
,
and to make a long story short
, ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch
, sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash
- back sequence
. on his way home
, he bumps inot
( literally
) marcellus
. the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers
, which results in the infamous
" gimp
" scene
, which is very reminicent of the
" squeal like a pig
!
" scene from
" deliverance
"
. the last
(
and best
, in my opinion
) of the episodes features john travolta
( again
)
and samuel l
. jackson
( in the best performance of any supporting ator ever
) as two slightly off
- kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car
. htey seek help with a friend of jackson ' s
( played by the q
- man himself
)
, desperately in need of a stress ball
. they end up calling a
" cleaner
" of sorts
, played by the god among men harvey keitel
, to help them out
. in the end
, the story brilliantly loops around itself
, ctually ending where it began
. if you haven ' t already seen the film
( or even if you have
, for that marter
)
, i suggest you invest your money infact a copy of the letterbox collectors edition
. it features two previously unreleased scenes
and the orginal film restored how it was originally meant to be seen
. earlier today
, i bought this version
and watched it a few hurs ago
. what thge pan
-
and
- scan did to this movie is inexcusable
. tht version cut out
, liuke
, half tje movie
. what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing
. for instance
, when travolta
and jackson are in the apartment near yhe end
, the widescreen verison allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses
. this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place
. just a theory
.
.
. one of the thigns that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot ofthe scenes from other movies
( i
. e
.
" pyscho
"
" kiss me deadly
"
,
" deliverance
"
, etc
.
)
.
bu why shouldn ' t he
? it ' s not like he out
- right
and blatantly stole
. give the guy a break
. in case you haven ' t already noticed
, i believe
" pulp fiction
" is a supremely excellent film
and one of the best of all timne
( up there with such greats as
" casablanca
"
and
" the godfather
"
)
. trust me
, ytou will not see a better film come out of the 90s
.
and besides
, it ' s one hell ofthe a ride
. note
: if anyone knows how i could get a
" bad motherfucker
" wallet
, please e
- mail me
. any help woudl be greatly appreciated
.
