the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate
. peopel are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about smoe dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future
. after a sort of confusing bit involving fake
- looking cyborg things
, the movie jumps into thge future
and the movie improves by leaps
adn bounds
. the basic diea behind the movie is that every once in a while
( make that every 1000 years or so
) an evil force comes to destroy earth
. the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element
. the plot in tihs movie really isn ' t that important to teh thing
though
. this movie has very good special effects
, for the most part
. the techno
- ish music in the backround fits tjhe mood very well
. bruce willis is an illegal taxi
- cab driver in a futuristic new york city
. one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk
. this movie is about what happens
. the plot twists are interesting
and the movei never fails to presen the viewer with a variety of different locations
. also there is a fair bit of action in the film
, particularly towards the end
. some characters are just plain strange including a highly
- energetic deejay in drag
. bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he alwyas doesnt
. the movie is definitely watchable
and rarely slows down
. it is one of those sci
- fi films where you ' ll be saying
" cool
" followed by a
" what the hell
?
!
?
!
"
. i give thte fifth element
