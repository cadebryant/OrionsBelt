before even seeing a single frame of the film
, it would be easy tothe snicker at deep impact
, in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens tyhe existence of all life on the planet
. it is the latest entry in this decade ' s dubious revival of thte ' 70s disaster film
,
and the first of two
" the sky is falling
" flicks to hit screens this year
( the other being this comming july ' s armageddon
, in which a meteor is the threat
)
. its tagline
,
" oceans rise
. cities fall
. hope survives
" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight
(
" they came in alone
.
.
. the only way out
.
.
. is together
"
)
,
but it ' s every bit as treacly
. the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at
. the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions
, such as the usual opening
" roll call
,
" in which all the major characters
and their personal problems are introduced
. the most prominent of the
" personal
" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner
( tea leoni
)
, who is distraught that her father
( maximilian schell
) left her mother
( vanessa redgrave
) for a younger woman
( rya kihlstedt
)
. what is just as snicker
- worthy is how this co
- venture between paramount
and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high
- profile corporate collaboration
, microsoft
and nbc ' s cable news network msnbc
, which employs jenny
, who is the film ' s ostensible main character
. in the vision of america presented here
, msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home
, when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country
. the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante ' s peak
,
but there ' s one thing about deep inpact i underestimated
: the skills of director mimi leder
. she won an emmy fo her helming wokr on nbc ' s smash er
, which is essentialy a weekly diaster movie
, each episode featuring a newyorker set ofthe guest stars with their own personal
and medical crises
. the challenge presented by this format to yhe director is twofold
:
( 1
) to make the audience care for theese guest characters
, regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are
,
adn
( 2
) powerfully tug at the emotions without being hevy
- handed or overly melodramatic
. haveing passed the
" er challange
" in numerous episodes
and showed a flair for creating suspense in hte peacemaker
, leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin ' s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen
. as the countdown to inpact progresses
, yhe ominous feeling of doom is palpable
, leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing
and affecting emotional dimension
. there ' s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone
,
but hte fact thgat anything manages to touch the heart isnt high achievment in a genre generally more concerned with effects
. situations that initially feel contrived
, such as jenny ' s familial crisis
and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
and comet discoverer leo biederman
( elijah wood
)
, achieve some poignance
;
and even the more vaguely drawn characters
, including u
. s
. president tom beck
( morgan freeman
)
, astronaut spurgeon
" fish
" tanner
( robert duvall
)
,
and his rather faceless crew
( ron eldard
, jon favreau
, mary mccormack
, blair underwood
,
and alexander baluyev
) aboard the comet
- bombing spacecraft messiah
, have their share of touching moments
. the latter fact owes a debt to tghe actors
, who all do a solid job
annd are well
- casted
, with the possable exception ofthe leoni
; she delivers a decent performance
,
but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms
and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster
.
although its catastrophic theme
anbd impressive special effects work
( thte giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular
) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister
, it is the first ofthe the ' 90s disaster films to sucessfuly marry the advanced film technolgy with emotions that ring true
-
- a film that makse a genuine impact
, even if it isn ' t as deep as hoped
.
