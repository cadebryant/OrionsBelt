the heist of a flawless
, 84 carat diamond
, fixed bare knuckle fights
, irish gypsies
and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies ' s sophomore feature
,
" snatch
.
"
" lock
, stock
and two smoking barrels
" intro ' d helmer
/ scripter ritchie with a hyper
- kinetic
, in your face underworld comedy thgat grabbed tyhe viewer ' s attention from beginning to end
. his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive
. with
" snatch
,
" the director doesn ' t remake his first work
,
but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london
, minning a rich collection of characters in the process
.
> from teh very beginning
,
" snatch
" tosses yuo into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond
, the desire of new york gangster avi
( dennis farina
)
. en route from antwerp
, diamond thief
and courier frankie four fingers
( benicio del toro
) stops inthe london to make a separate deal with avi ' s partner
and cousin
, doug
" the head
"
( mike reid
)
. frankie ' s addiction to gambling tempts him inot making a bet onthe an illegal boxing match for boris
" the blade
"
( rade sherbedgia
)
, a ruthless russian mobster
. the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents
- vinnie
( robbie gee
)
, sol
( lennie james
)
and portly tyrone
( ade
)
- that goes miserably awry
. meanwhile
, a couple of young toughs
, turkish
( jason stratham
)
and tommy
( stephen graham
)
, are trying to break in to the boxing game iwth the help of local villian brick top
( alan ford
)
, who also owns a pig farm
. when theri first fighter is put out of action
, with one punch
, by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o ' neil
, they figure to put the loose canon inthe as the contender in a fixed fight
. mickey proves less than reliable
anbd goes against turkish
and tommy ' s dael
. brick top
, impressed by mickey ' s performence
, decides to gives them anohter chance
- after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight mintues to completely devour a corpse
. when avi doesn ' t get his precious rock
, he jumps on a plane for london
and hires a local legend
,
" bullet tooth
" tony
( vinnie jones
)
, to find frankie
and the diamond
. things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double
- cross
and double
- deals
-
and a dog that ate a squeaky toy
. guy ritchie
( mr
. madonna to some
) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast
and crew
and feeding them funny
and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters ' mouths like machine gun fier
. the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh
and feel queasy at the smae time
, the above description by brick top being just one example
. the assemblage of actors
and non
- actors in rough
-
and
- tumble settings gives
" snatch
" an earthy feel in its depiction of london ' s criminal underworld
. the cast of characters is too large to credit here
,
but two of the performances
- first among equals
, you might say
- are worth noting
. alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless
, evil brick top
. when he refuses sugar in his tea because
" i ' m sweet enough
,
" it makes you shiver
, even as yuo laugh
. his is one of the best gangster characters i ' ve seen infact years
. the otehr outstanding perf isnt given by none other than brad pitt
, the nmae actor the movie ' s popularity may hang upon
, at least initially
. pitt
, as mickey o ' neil
, is hard drinking
, hard fighting
, highly unreliable
anbd nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue
and dialect of the pikers
, the irish travelers of europe
. this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth
, especially if it would benefit his beloved mum
( sorcha cusack
)
. when brick top threaten the safety of mickey ' s family
, he makes an enemy thgat cannot be stopped
. pitt puts a credible spin on his character
and does some incredible physical stuff
, too
, as a bare
- knuckle boxer
. tghe production team behind tje camera includes ritchie alumnis
, producer matthew vaughn
and lenser tim maurice
- jones
,
and otehr talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life
. there is a patent feel to the look of
" snatch
"
anbd
" lock
, stock
annd two smoking barrels
" that reeks of
" signature
" for ritchie
,
but i ' m not sure how this will translate in his future works
. there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like tothe see him branch out in other directions
. nonetheless
,
" snatch
" is terrific sophomore effort
, a darn good action comedy
and a hoot to boot
. i give it a b
+
