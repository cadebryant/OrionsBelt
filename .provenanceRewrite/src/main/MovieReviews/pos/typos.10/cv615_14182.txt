a miracle of filmmaking
,
" some like it hot
" is a brilliant film
,
and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags
and plot twists
. it is the pinnacle of writer
- director billy wilder ' s career
, a stunning feat considering thte vast catalogue of films he had helped make
. jerry
( lemmon
)
and joe
( curtis
) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig
, trying to earn enough money to feed themselves
. oney night
, as they ' re playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy
, the place is raided
. as it turns out
, the owner
, spats columbo
( george raft
) ws ratted out by toothpick charlie
( george e
. stone
)
. several weeks later
, on valentine ' s day
, jerry
and joe go to a garage tothe pick up a car
anbd end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage
. eager to escape
, the duo are forced tothe take a job in florida with all expenses paid
. the only catch
.
. its a girls band
. so josephine
( curtis
)
and daphne
( lemmon
)
, make their way onto the train
anbd go to florida
. onthe the way there
, htey meet sugar kane
( monroe
)
, a bombshell singer who is looking for lvoe
. jerry
and joe immediately fall for the singer
,
but there ' s two problems
: 1
) they ' re in drag
,
and 2
) millionaire osgood fielding
( joe e
. brown
) falls madly in love with daphne
. what follows in pure hysteria
, still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the
" italian opera lovers festival
"
. tony curtis is hysterical as joe
/ josephine
, especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar
. marilyn monroe
, in a wonderfully comic performence
, is sugar
, providing incredible timing
and sex appeal
, along with true sincerity
. thge scenes
,
however
, are all stolen by either brown or lemmon
. lemmon is hysterical as daphne
. cast as the less rational one
, lemmon ' s performance is ridiculously crazy
, it is disorder in the style all billy wilder ' s
. brown is particularly hilarious as osgood
, as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony
. he manages to use lemmon ' s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performence as a completely eccentric millionaire
. every set
- piece is flawless
, as wilder brilliantly changes settings constanly
,
and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture
. wilder ' s script isnt stunning
, as he carefully combines gangsters
, cross
- dressing
, romance
, sex
, music
, gender roles
,
anbd social taboos in a riotous blend of wit
and oddball craziness
. wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria
, so pich
- perfect that the audience isnt dying of laughter with the last comic piece
, the final line of this absolutely incredible film
. wilder ' s is dead wrong when he says nobody ' s perfect
: billy wilder is
, especially when he makes something this disastrously funny
. nobody ' s perfect
but billy wilder
.
