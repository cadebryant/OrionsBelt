i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of tghe x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required tothe fully enjoy this movie
. the producers are not stupid
, mkaing a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable
. ytou have to reach fo a larger audience
. therefore
, yhe movie is quite user
- friendly
.
altough
, non
- fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind thte looks many characters exchange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is goign onthe
. you wiull never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera
. inspite any case
, the answer is no
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing else is on
and i prefer milelnnium
.
however
, since the fox network as been so kind as to air sevral key episodes for several weeks before the movie ' s opening weekend i took tath opportunity to test the movei
. i taped all ofthe these episodes
and watched them only after seing the movie
, i am glad to report that i learned nothing new
. everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny
adn others
. i knwo i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point
but everybody should get the chance to experiece this movie
. warning
: major spoilers folow
! please do not read
, to fully enjoy this movie ytou must not be able nkow what is coming
, what exactly is over that hill
and what that weird
" hummm
" soudn is all about
. you have been warned
. the x
- files isnt wqat a summer should be
. exciting
, scary
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects do nto take over the movie
and are onyl there when it is really necessary
)
annd good performances
. this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalant of a wooden plank
. from start to finish
, this movie does not let go of you
. when i compare it with last summer ' s movies the best way to describe it would be
: take the excitement
anbd great score from face
/ off
anbd the deadly use of sound from event horizon
. this flick is scary
, not inwhich a b movie kind of way where you always know where
and when the critter will jump at our heroes
. in fact
, the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd
! the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid
. you know
, whn you are affraid to put you feet on the floor becouse the creature might be under the chair
, or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files is scary
.
adn guess what
? you never even have to see the monster
but your imagination works overtime
and it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster
. do not think that the x
- files is a monster movie
. in fact
, the creature is there for maybe three minutes total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder episode of tje series
. scully is at his side
, ofthe course
,
but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time
. she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped during the lastr half hour of the movie so she does not get tothe do much
. no
, this is mulder ' s time in the spotlight
. by now
, ytou have heard of the scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if you have nto
then i will not spoil it for you
, let ' s just say that due to recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about
? the dialogue in interesting
and the director is marvelous
. the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill
. the script is spotless
, every thing that happens happens for a purpose
. if you are confused by something
, do not worry because it will all become clear later on
but
,
and i cannot stress this enough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as important as the effects
. miss one vital piece of inforamtion
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you will go home
and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who need to go to the bathroom durring movies
.
.
. don ' t
! the person who watched tje movie with me hadnt to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. there is noone time to take a breather between scenes because
, again unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense
annd the action with useless subplots
, eveyr scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen only one movei who ranks higher on my list of movies i ' d recommend
and that is the truman show
but it only wins by a nose
.
but the truman sohw is not what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files is
. what omre dont you ask from a summer movie other than tjhe chance to be excited
? cool effects
? it ' s good some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the serieses iwll hate this movie while non
- fans will have a good timne
. it does not provide answers to the show ' s many questions
, thge status quo remains nearly the same
and
, no
, mulder
and scully do not get together
. rating
: four
and a half out of five stars for the best movie
yet this summer
, several jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw taht one coming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell did that come ffrom
"
and oney heck of an ending
. you may wonder where htis movie lost half a star
. well
, i swore never tothe give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck
, the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles
but
hten they jsut stop
. it ' s pretty obvious the film ' s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving fo a long time
,
bu in the end it looks liuke mulder just dropped from the sky
and started driving
.
