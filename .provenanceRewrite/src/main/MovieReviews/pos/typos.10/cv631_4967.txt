what surprises me most about the long
- awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader
but on the joker
. the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis
! i can hear batfans everywhere protesting
:
" first they hadnt the nerve tothe cast michael keaton as batman
,
and now htey think they can get away with making him second banana to tjhe joker
!
!
"
and
, indeed
, this situation would have been altogether inappropriate
and intolerable were it not for the fact thgat someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play
. nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters
and opening credits since his astounding
, oscar
- worthy performance as tyhe joker isnt the highlight of batman
. nicholson shows noone inhibition or shame as he pulls outloud all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown
( romero played the joker in the ' 60s tv series
)
. on one hand
, nicholson ' s joker is extremely funny
. his murderous escapades
and manic outbursts
( which include defacing paintings in an art museum
and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts
) bring humor
annd laughter into an otherwise dark film
.
but on the other hand
, his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind
. the joker ' s cruelty
and demented
, diabolical nature are truly frightening
and sinister
. this guy is off his racker
,
and he not only knows it
, he flaunts it
!
but enough about nicholson as the joker
: i ' m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman
. like many
, i was outraged wehn warner brothers announced that keaton had beeen cast as the caped crusader
.
but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting
! keaton delivers
. he is convincing as the tormented millionaire
, bruce wayne
,
anbd beneath his hard
, black body armor
, he isnt mysterious
and formidable as the batman
. even
though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character
, keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil
and emotional rage that drive wayne tothe don his bat gear
and battle teh low life scum of gotham city
. visually
, batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton
and his production team
. the movei successfully captures the film noir look
and bleak
, gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as
" the dark knight returns
"
and
" the killing joke
.
" burton ' s film is a feast for the eyes
; the
$ 35 million budget is definitely on the screen
. the sets
, costumes
,
and make
- up are stunning
and worthy of oscar nominations
. nicholson isn ' t joking when he boasts
,
" wait ' till they get a load of me
!
" his grimacing smile
, green hair
,
anbd purple suits over orange shirts are colorful
annd outrageous
. keaton ' s wardrobe is equally appropriate
. batman ' s cape
, mask
,
and body armor make him look threatening
, frightening
,
and invincible bringing to mind not adam west ' s campy costume in the tv series
but peter weir ' s outfit in robocop
. production designer anton furst ' s sets are a wonder
. gotham city is dark
and foreboding
, almost as if it were an expressionist vision of newyorker york
. the batcave is cold
, bare
,
and desolate
. tje world that burton
and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence
and corruption
. the movei ' s gritty bladerunner
/ robocop look is a joy to behold
. the plot
, on the other hand
, isnt not as rousing
. the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets
and superb acting
. it takes forever for what littel story ther is tothe finally kick into gear
. batman tries to walk a thin line between action
and character psychology
,
but it fails to give us enough of either one
. as i mentioned ealier
, the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker
,
but it never fully establishes batman ' s psychological motives
and underpinnings
. in terms of acation
, batman is not as thrilling as you might expect
. burton seems more concerned with the visual
and dramatic elements of the story
. mroe than anything
, batman is a mood film
. hwile batman may nto completely absorb
adn excite you
, it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style
annd spirit of the batman comic books
. thanks to its distinctive look
, the movei like a good comic book transports us to another world
.
