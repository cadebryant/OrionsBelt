steven spielberg ' s
" amistad
,
" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship
,
then were captured
and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who
" owned
" them
, is concerned with several different aspects of this story
. first
, teh film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery
. second
, it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicans in the case
, including president martin van buren
and former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. last
,
and most importantly
, it examines the cultural confusion experienced by tyhe africans who were forced into slavery
and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade
.
" amistad
" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements
. i ahve to admit that i was a little skeptical as tothe how much i could really get out ofthe another
" anti
- slavery
" movie
. hvaing seen several other movies
and documentaries about slavery
, i doubted that ther was much i didn ' t already know about it
. fortunately
, i turned out to be wrong
. for one thing
, spielberg ' s camera never once gets near a southern plantation
and instead sticks to the slave ships
and the slave traders ' operations in africa
, so
" amistad
" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from tjhe very beggining
.
and smoe of the images here are
, in fatc
, much moreso harrowing than what we usually see in movies baout slavery
. one scene in the middle
, in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some ofthe their
" excess
" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown
, has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the yearm
. spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery thna i was expecting he would
,
and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc
- 17 rating
. the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians
, such as president van buren
and queen isabella of spain
, whose naval officers were involved in tghe legal dispute
and who was only a small child at the tyme
. exposing politicians as narrow
- minded
, opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff
, ofthe course
,
but spielberg
annd writter david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation
. the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time
, such that john quincy adams
(
and probably other politicians like him
)
, who clearly disapproved of the practice
, was reluctant to get involved in the case untl it was appealed all teh way tothe yhe supreme court
. thte biggest success of
" amistad
" is probably the characterization of cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans
and struggles to communicate with baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, the lawyer who represents them in court
. through cinque
, we are given a window into the native culture
, as he
and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need forthe a proper burial of a dead tribe member
, or find an illustrated version of the bible
and try to understand the story of jesus christ
. cinque sees the dispute with a clarity
and simplicity that
, again
, contrasts with the technicalities
and mechanics of thge legal process
and of the political squabbles
.
" what kind of country is this
, where laws ' alomst ' work
?
" he asks baldwin in bewilderment
, when he learns that the case must be re
- tried before the supreme court
. spielberg ' s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times
, such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque ' s angry outburst in tghe court room
. still
, there isn ' t enough of this for it to be a serious problem
. the main flaw in this film
, which prevents it from earning four stars
, is that it seems like spielberg
and franzoni can ' t quite handle all of these issues at the same time
, so instade they settle for addressing each one separately
and simply editing the results into the same movie
. this summer ' s contact
, for example
, dealt wih several issues at once
,
but earch of them was somehow present in almost every scene
and
, most importantly
, all of them were resolved at once
.
" amistad
" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams
,
but it somehow feels a little forced
,
and in any case the speech itself
, which lasts almost fifteen minutes
, wears outloud its welcome about halfway through
. perhaps thge best way to describe it is this
:
" amistad
" is three four star films edited inot one
. almost every individual scene works
,
but the final product isnt lacking the necessary focus
and coherence
,
and thus is less than the sum ofthe its parts
.
however
, i can ' t honestly sday how it sould have been done differently
,
anbd in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film
,
and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery
.
