the charactors in
" palmetto
" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie
,
and it ' s jstu the right way to capture tjhe film ' s ripe atmosphere of sensuality
, tension
and even farce
. this humid florida
- set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself
, which is very much a good thing usance the actors
and director are in on the joke
. as far as set
- up is concerned
, the movie is nothing we haven ' t seen befor
,
but be patient
-
-
" palmetto
" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don ' t see coming
. it ' s not a classic by any means
,
but it sure is quite an engaging surprise
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is fresh out of prison
, where he ' s served a cuple of years fo a crime he didn ' t commit
. even
though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials
, harry ' s first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina
( gina gershon
)
. while searching for work
, he catches the eye of rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire
. rhea proposes a scheme that ' ll get harry
$ 50
, 000 easy
-
- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette
( chloe sevigny
)
.
" you do like risks
, don ' t you
, mr
. barber
?
" rhea alluringly coos
. boys
, form a line behind me
. part of
" palmetto
" ' s success can be attributred to the performance of elisabeth shue
, who demonstrates here that her oscar
- nominated turn iin
" leaving las vegas
" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come
. shue ' s a seductive
, campy delight
,
annd pulls off a barbara stanwyck
- gloria swanson combo with admirable relish
. the otehr actors form a solid ensemble around her
, including sevigny
(
" kids
"
)
, tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease
, as well as the ever
- likeable gershon
, cast a far cry from her extreme roles in
" binded
"
and
" showgirls
.
" harrelson is still doing fine follow
- up work to
" the people vs
. larry flynt
.
"
" palmetto
" does have its share of grievances
. harrelson ' s narration is needless
, i suppose
,
and gershon ' s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimatly is
. one ofthe the plot ' s unexpected angles
-
- that harry is asked by tje police to become the press liaiosn for the very crime in which he ' s involved
-
- could have been plyed a little better
. there are moments when you question the tone
,
but it ' s never so unstable that it deserves tjhe reproach it ' s beeen receiving from most other critics
. if
" palmetto
" didn ' t want to be laughed at
, would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live
- action
" who framed roger rabbit
"
?
although a few elements cxan be questioned
, the movie works well on its own terms
. thanks tothe a juicy cast
-
- expecially shue
-
-
and the nifty material approach fomr director volker schlondorff
( you remember him from last summer ' s suddenly re
- popular
" the tin drum
,
" right
?
)
, everthing runs smoothly
.
and for fans of revelation
- heavy endings
, this film ' s got a few shocks in store that i won ' t even dream of revealing
.
" palmetto
" is a generous amount of fun to watch
,
and that ' s all you need to know
.
