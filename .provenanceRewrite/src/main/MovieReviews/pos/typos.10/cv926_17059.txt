billy bob thornton
, who had a sudden rise to fame wtih 1996 ' s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor
and writer
, is becoming one of the most versatile
-
and most accomplished
- american actors around at the moment
. as jacob
, the simple
but at times very bright loser brother ofthe bill paxton ' s hank
, thornton gives a performence which should leave an indelible mark on all
bu the most hardened viewers
. three men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
and their friend lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble upon a plane wreck which
, upon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
anbd a bag full ofthe money
. jacob
and lou want to pocket the cash
. hank
, the smarter
-
and perhaps more naive
- of the three
, insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find
. eventually
, they agree tothe keep the cash safe until yhe plane is found
,
and
then split the money three ways
. things start going wrong
,
though
, with greed
and violence weaving their ways through their plan
. disaster is sure tothe strike
. director sam raimi
, of the evil dead
and darkman fame
, has made an excellent
and thought
- provoking film
, worls away from the comic horror films which made his name
. hwile there are a couple of moments which might remind oen of his earlier work
, raimi has made an intelligent
and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come
. scott b
. smith ' s screenplay
, based on his novel
( which i haven ' t read
) is a fine example of escalating tension
. while it does remind one of danny boyle ' s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour
, it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality
, or tghe lack thereof
, found in a film with this subject matter
. alar kivilo ' s cinematography reminds one of joel
and ethan coen ' s fargo
, with the obleek
, snowy landscape almost becoming another character
. danny elfman also does well with his moody
, finely
- written score
. if there ' s a flaw in the film
, it ' s that it goes on for just a little too long
. just when we thiunk thyat they are about to wrap things up
, raimi
and smith decide to let the film go on a little further
. while this isn ' t really a bad thing
, it did become a little frustrating at times
( this may have beeen due to the fact that i had consumed a larg sprite beforehand
)
. the performances are excellent
, with the usually annoying paxton in fine form
adn bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank ' s scheming wife
. this is an excellent showcase for thornton ' s fine skills as an actor
and a great change in direction for raimi
, who could vyer well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished directer of dramatic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, that this doesn ' t stop him from making another evil dead sequel
.
