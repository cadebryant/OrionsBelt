" through a spyglass
, i could see everything
.
" king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21
, 1793
,
bu instead of visualizing this act ofthe regicide
, legendary auteur eric rohmer ' s the lady
and yhe duke observes from afar
. consdider it a view to a kill made abstract
. a proper british
( yes
, british
) gentlewoman
, grace elliott
( lucy russell
)
,
and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at yhe glistening city of paris
, where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants
. the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope
( often muttering
,
" i don ' t know
,
"
) as the sound of cheering patriots
and revolutionaries echoes through the air
. what we don ' t see might not be able to hurt us
. just close your eyes
and think of england
. during times of revolution
, the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls
, discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until tjhe walls cave in on them
. adapted from elliott ' s memoirs
, journal of my life during tyhe french revolution
, rohmer ' s latest artistic tour
- de
- force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies
( tales of teh four seasons
, etc
.
)
, a period film set during the most violent changes in french history
. resisting the temptation for grand
- scale theatrics
, much of the lady
annd the duke is about quiet
, decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes
. grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist
: a headstrong
, snobbish blueblood
, one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along
. a foreigner who accepts the french king as her pwn
, grace ' s life seems defined by fancy attire
and lively political debate with her former lover
, the king ' s hot
- blooded cousin
, prince philipe
, duke of orleans
( jean
- claude dreyfus
)
. the times are changing
,
though
,
adn the gears inch ever closer toward violence
. during the september massacres of 1792
, she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke ' s sister
- in
- law on a stake
. rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil
, old fashioned
, almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob
. in doing so
, he achieves what braveheart
adn the patriot could not
: the face ofthe death
. when grace sees her friend ' s disembodied head on a pole
, rohmer ' s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman ' s reaction shooted
, laden with hot tears
. grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice
, sheltering him ffrom the mob
. through her relationship with the duke
, she seeks a passport for this one activist ' s escape
. grace doesn ' t even understand her own actions
(
and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger
)
. she endures persecution fomr robespierre
and his gang ofthe thuggish equalizers
, ceaseless police monitoring
, house searches
, even a brief imprisonment for harmless intenational correspondence
. maintaining her stiff upper lip
and pampered life
( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes
)
, she becomes a heroine through circumstance
. the events themselves are intrusions apon her person
, her home
,
and therefore her values
. aristocracy proves a glass house
, oen that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones
. the duke is called to vote on the king ' s punishment
,
and despite his hours of deliberation with friends
and advisors
, talk means nothing in the face of bloody action
( or futile inaction
)
. the episodic structure creates a wobbly
, jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution
, which serves as methaphor
but also disconnects potential audience indentification
. lazy viewers
(
and critics
) may also complain that knowledge of french history is recquired for enjoyment of the lady
anbd tjhe duke
. that ' s foolery
,
but brings up tje valid criticism that rohmer ' s characters occasionally become didactic
. rohmer ' s imperfect
but assured push toward the future remains staunch
and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while tkaing bold steps forward into an uncertain future
. what may arouse interest in tyhe lady
and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary
and historical passions is rohmer ' s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means ofthe exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanisim
. tghe actors were filmed against a bluescreen
,
then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris
. this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot
, a technicolor dream ofthe fanciful buildings
and wide
- open streets
. it looks as phony as titanic
,
but unlike james cameron ' s debacle
, the lady
anbd the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone
. why
? they aren ' t real
. the veyr foundation rohmer ' s characters stand upon is false
,
and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves
, in all their insubstantial glory
. screened at the 2001 new york film festival
( feature coming soon
)
