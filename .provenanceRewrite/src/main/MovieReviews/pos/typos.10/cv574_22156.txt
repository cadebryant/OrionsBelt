- stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is sometimes like lastr years hit
" there ' s something about mary
" that is offensive
but very funny
. the screenplay by harris goldberg
and rob schneider himself is a smart
, clever
and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to mkae isnt so hilariously funny
. the characters in the film are all actually likable especially
" jabba lady
" with her big body
but soft heart
. there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach wass killing me
. even
though i throught
" toy story 2
"
anbd
" being john malkovich
" were the funniest of the year
" deuce bigalow
" follows right behind them
. the directing by mike mitchell isnt fantastic
and shows he took time on the film
. rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance
and whn his romance develops with one of his customers kate
( arija bareikis
) it is a sweet romance thta we get involved in
and actually like being involved in it
.
" deuce bigalow
" is a good
- natured film worth all the merit it can get
. its not a classic or a masterpiece
, it ' s just a comedy that we don ' t feel bad about watching
. sure it may come off as offensive
and may come off as dumb sometimes
,
bu you cannot deny that it isn ' t funny
.
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is no disappointment
. its a fast paced
, intertaining sweet
and hilarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic
. fans of schneider will not be disappointed
and fans of crude
but nice comedies will not eather
. for some reason the film garnered an r rating
but with no
" f words
" or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r
. a mild r to put it to the least
,
but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see
. don ' t try to be one of thsoe people who make so much of a film that they do not like it
, just sit back
, laugh
and enjoy the movie
