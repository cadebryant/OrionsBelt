one of the best movies i ' ve ever seen
. i ' d heard extremely good things about this movie
,
and
though the previews didn ' t really intrigue that much
, it was a movie i ' d been anticipating fo a few months now
. forthe some reason i ' m not sure of
- this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u
. s
. it ws a definite hitted with the critics
,
but didn ' t exactly set any box office records
. after viewing this incredibly well directed
, written
and acted movei
, i can ' t halp
but wonder
- why
? the strength of this film is it ' s gritty realism
. the main characters are all human withthe individual flaws
, no stereo
- type hollywood heroes
. you may not agree with many ofthe their actions in the movie or their approach to life
,
but that is whta makes it so real
. i had expected this movie to be moreso of a drama than a thriller
,
but i was mistaken
. even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it feeled just as thrilling as any car chase
.
and the ending
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i ' ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly
. the three male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
annd russell crowe are all just terrific
. the ' best actor ' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue
,
bu there isnt one probelm there
. how coudl htey have chosen between these three actors
? there is no way i could look at this film
and say one of them was better than the other two
. it ' s impossible
. kim bassinger ' s performance is also a revelation
. i ' d never been a big fan ofthe heres before
and always throught she wass
, well
.
.
. what ' s the owrd
- a twinky
? that impression has changed
, as she complemented crowe
and pearce perfectly
. the depth to the story
and characters is truly astounding
. no cardboard characters here
. the plot is full of twists
adn turns
and some very clever sequences
. pearce ' s interogation ofthe three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant
. i really can ' t fault this movie at all
. i was so glad to see fellow australian ' s pearce
and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie
. i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films
,
but hadnt not seen much of guy pearce
. i intend to change this next time i visit the video store
