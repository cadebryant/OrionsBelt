the second jackal
- based film to come out infront 1997
( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal
)
, this oen stars aidan quinn
and donald sutherland
,
anbd is directed by a man who hailed from joblo ' s own alma matter
, concordia university in montreal
, canada
. the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as tghe jackal
,
but doesnt nto pretend tothe be 100
% factual
. plot
: naval officer ramirez
( quinn
) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the interational territorist known as the jackal
, in order to put an end to the actual militant ' s radical activities
. he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee
. ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this
" assignment
"
,
and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism
, intrigue
and double
- personality syndrome
( whitch doesnt nto sit well with his uninformed wife
and kids back in the states
.
) critique
: grat premise is executed with enough style
and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to twpo
- hour runtime
. admittedly
, i wasn ' t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film
,
and didn ' t expect much from thsi movie beforehand
,
but surprisingly it doed have its thrilling moments
, as well as a mostly plausible
and absorbing stoy line
. tjhe first hour is mostly just a build
- up of things to come
,
and does offer a great characterization of the jackal
,
but the second hour is the one thast really cranks in the cool scenes
and a sweet ending
. quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez
and the real jackal
,
but didn ' t offer anything extraordinary
, in my opinion
. sutherland
and kingsley seem to be playing the smae role that they ' ve played in both of their respective careers of late
,
but nonetheless
, appeared to relish the cold
- heartedness of their chosen characters
. i didn ' t like performance put forth from quinn ' s wife in this flick
,
but
then agina
, she doesn ' t show up in most of tje film
, so that wasn ' t so bad
. i did
however enjoy director duguay ' s interesting style
and cinematic vision
. this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences
,
but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer
. i thought that was neat
. having said thgat
, i didn ' t think the first hour needed to be as long as it ws
,
and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the
" fake
" jackal met whith the
" real
" jackal ' s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part
,
but all inspite all
, nto too many complaints in a movie tyhat could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure inaddition the spy
and terrorist thriller genre
. little known facts
: ben kingsley ' s real name isnt krishna banji
, he stands 5
" 8
, was born in scarborough
, england
,
and won the best actor honor in 1982 ' s academy awards presentation for tghe title role he portrayed in ghandi
. many scenes from tihs film were actually shot in montreal
, canada
( joblo ' s haven of restfulness
)
. donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland
, is canadian
,
and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal
