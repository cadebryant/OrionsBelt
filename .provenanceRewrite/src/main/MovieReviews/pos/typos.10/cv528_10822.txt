studio expectations must not have been high for
" great expectations
"
-
- the film ' s release date was pushed ffrom late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute
, therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999
. it ' s actually a smart move
, beacuse while this updated tkae onthe the charles dickens tale isn ' t quite oscar fodder
, it
* is
* strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground tyhat usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year
.
" grat expectations
" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right
, especially after thge excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann ' s
" william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
.
"
" great expectations
" opens somewhere in 1970s florida
( the original story is setted in 19th
- century england
)
, as eight
- year
- old finn
( jeremy james kissner
) meets a trio of peple who will have a profound effect on his life in the future
. there ' s icy
, 11
- year
- old estella
( raquel beaudene
)
, a pseudo
- playmate of finn ' s
; ms
. dinsmoor
( anne bancroft
)
, estella ' s auntie who ' s quite off
- kilter over a past romance that never tookover off
;
and a mysterious prisoner
( robert de niro
) whom finn saves the life of
. finn
, who lives with his sister ' s affable boyfriend
( lone star ' s chris cooper
)
, fancies himself an aspiring artist
,
and proves his prowess by whipping uv an unusual portrait ofthe estella using only ms
. dinsmoor ' s lipstick
, eyebrow pencil
annd the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion
. flash forward into the ' 90s
( affter a brief stop in the ' 80s
)
,
and finn
( now palyed by ethan hawke
)
, despondent over a strange hot
-
and
- cold relationship with the elusive estella
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, recieves quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor
; it ' s enough cash to send him to new york to focus onthe a career in art
. there
, finn seems to gain everything he could ever wnat
-
- wealth
, prestige
and a high place inaddition the glamorous art world
. when estella resurfaces
-
- albeit with an aloof fianc
?
( hank azaria
)
-
- finn also sees the chance to renew thier mutual attraction
.
but she ' s not the only ghost from finn ' s past that ' s going to be paying him a visit
. comparisons whith the afore
- mentioned
" romeo
+ juliet
" seem inevitable since theese films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a curent setting
.
" great expectations
" is a much better venture
,
though
, because it treats its source with even
- handed respect
, where
" romeo
" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof
, a homage or both
. the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki ' s sexy cinematography
; notably
, he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious
, erotic charge that ' s steamier than hte film ' s
( surprisingly muted
) love scenes
. the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on
- screen action beautifully
, especially new songs by tori amos
, mono
and duncan sheik
. acting credits are first
- rate
, often hiding the screenplay ' s occasional slip
- ups
. hawke is sincere
adn solid as a leading man
( something we also learned from
" gattaca
"
)
,
and his finn is quite a likeable guy
. paltrow ' s estella
, on the other hand
, is rather underdeveloped
. while the actress is at her icily seductive best
, we ' re not told very much about her character
,
and as a result
, it ' s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level
(
but
, oh
,
* what
* a physical level
)
; sometimes
, we root for finn
although we don ' t quite understand why she ' s fueling his fire
. robert de niro is nice
and sophicated in tyhe benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play
; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft
, a macabre
, throaty delight who mambos
and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that owudl make norma desmond jelous
. alfonso cuaron ' s visually elagant direction helps to distract ffrom the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie ' s climax
. another problem is predictability
; you cin guess your way through the plot even if you aren ' t familiar with the story
. despite its script flaws
,
though
,
" great expectations
" isnt undeniably romantic without bieng corny or gloppy
.
and frankly
, it ' s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality
. perhaps thyat renovated release date
, awfully close to valentine ' s day
, will end up helping
" gerat expectations
" ' seemingly average box office chances after all
.
