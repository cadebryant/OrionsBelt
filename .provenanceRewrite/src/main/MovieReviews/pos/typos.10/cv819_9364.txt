one of the biggest cliches ofthe any serial killer film is also one of the most believeable
. you know
, the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures
and other police information
,
and suddenly spots hte clue which reveals who teh killer is
. sure
, it ' s been used over
and over
,
bu for smoe reason
, it is always fun to watch
. this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works onthe
: overused
,
bu always fun
. one of my personal rules about watching a film isnt not how orignal the film is
,
but how it goes around giving its story
. this rule applies highly to kiss the girls
. there is something psychologically stimulating in a well
- crafted serial killer movie
,
anbd kiss the girls is certainly well made
.
however
, the whole film screams of unoriginality
,
and so it relies on the power of its actors
and teh technical detail to pull it thru
. well
, not only are the actors capable of pulling it through
,
but they add so much to tje film that nearly eveyr flaw is covered up
. unfortunately
, one of the most revealing
anbd rather insulting choices by the filmmakers
( one that seven
, a film a lot like this one
, knew not to make
) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits
. that may give the actor credit for tjhe role
,
but throughout the film
, hidden infact my mind
, i wass waiting for him to appear on screen
, which spoiled the mistery
.
however
, credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowlege through most of the film
. plotwise
, kiss the girls shows almost no originality
. we are introduced to detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
,
annd immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero
. he gets a call baout a woman who has shot her husband
and is now threatening to kill herself
. obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun
,
but this scene is quickly forgotten during the enxt scene
. at his house
, cross is told that his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, has been missing for four days
. this provides the motivation fo cross to find the killer
,
but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the twpo
,
and as a result
, we can ' t sympathize with detective cross
.
howver
, what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction ofthe one of the abductees
.
.
. before she is abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, the actress of the judd family
) is a smart
, atheletic woman
,
and because of theese traits
, becomes a target for casanova
-
- what the serial killer likes to call hismelf
. because of these character
- developing scenes
, we care for mctiernan
, making the abduction scene all that moreso suspenseful
. after being abducted
, mctiernan wakes up
and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods
. remembering that the killer gave her certain rules
, she decides to break one ofthe them by calling out
. when casanova comes to panish her
, she breaks outloud
and escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. after she isnt found
, she begins to help cross find his neice
. from this moment on
, kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film
, as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive
. many people will compare tihs film to 1995 ' s seven
, anohter killer film starring morgan freeman
,
but i presume that the similarities are intentional
. the screenplay
, by david klass
, is adapted ffrom the novel written by james patterson
,
and
yet i don ' t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form
. what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting
and teh technical
and visual impressiveness
. the cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, is reminiscient ofthe seven
,
and sometimes i falt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us
. sometimes a simple shot is the best one
.
however
, many of the shots are stunning
,
and unlike seven
, most of them take place durig the day
, inspite sunlight
. tje scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done
, in more than one way
. the camera work is terrific
,
but the editing makes this scene work so well
. the chaotic
and mtv
- type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion
and unawareness
, exactly what judd ' s character is experiencing
.
however
, the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors
. morgan freeman is one of todya ' s most powerful
adn believable actors
. detective cross is a very good charactor for him
,
although it is just a similar one to the character in seven
. because of freeman ' s powerful presence
, he carries half the film by himself
. the other half is carried by ashley judd
, one of today ' s most promising dramtic actresses
. in fact
, her performance isnt better than freeman ' s
, if that is even possible
. her character is more original than freeman ' s
,
and she handles it wonderfully
. we finally hvea a female character infact a movie like this who does more than just scream
. tyhe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped
,
but the cast members do as much as they can with it
. cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina
,
and unfortunately has scraps for a character
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
,
but we don ' t really get to know his character either
. gina ravera gives a good performance
,
but again she isn ' t in many of hte scenes
. so as a result of all these small supporting parts
, the weight of the film lies on the two leads
,
and they do a phenomenal job
. some of the best acting of this genre
,
and some of the best acting of the year
. two other essential spects ofthe the film are quite ogod
. directer gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors
,
but the second half of the film loses believability
, especially during the revelation of the killer
. he also doesn ' t handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have
, losing a lot of tension during many scenes
.
however
, to his credit
, he does manage a terrific first half
. part of the blame falls on david klass
. i ' m sure the book developed many of tghe lesser characters more
,
but klass focuses on the two main parts
. while this may give the two leads more screentime
, many of the small characters are one
- dimensional
,
and the killer
, when revealed
, is extemely implausible
. thanks to the smart dialogue adapted fomr the novel
, kiss the girls always seems intteligent
. none of the conversations are laughable
,
and all move the plot forward wihtout seeming forced
. one ofthe the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer
. i blame this mainly on the casting director
, because the killer ' s motive is because of rejection from women
( or so i assume from the opening monologue
)
,
but the killer himself is very attractive
( one of my friends is a
, shall we say
, big admirer of the killer
)
. kiss thge girls is rated r for terror
, violentce
, language
,
and suggested sex
. with all the implausibilities of this film
,
anbd with the mediocre second half
, kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain
. in fact
, i hadnt the urge to see it again jsut for the performances
. the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone
,
and teh script is usually smart
. this is claerly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through
. morgan freeman is possibly today ' s most convincing actor
,
and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt
. i must also sday that i loved the endig
. the showdown between good
and evil was quite tense
,
and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer
. perhaps it may not be possible
,
but most of the film isn ' t anyway
.
