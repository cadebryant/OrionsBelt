( dimension films
,
" scream 2
" ' s distributor
, has asked press to say extremely little
-
- if anything
-
- about the film ' s twisty plot
. tht ' s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here
,
but i will do my best to be vague
( now
, there ' s a first
)
.
)
" the firt one was
[ good
]
,
but all tjhe rest sucked
,
" said a cinematically
- savvy teen in last winter ' s wes craven thriller
" scream
,
" her statement referring to the films of the
" nightmare on elm street
" series
but realy putting down franchise overkill in general
. the comment certainly carries clout
: for every truly great sequel
, there appears to be a couple of duds
, making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely wiht fresh idaes
.
but like it or not
, along comes
" scream 2
.
"
and believe it or not
, it ' s a doozy
-
- a slick
, sinister
, madly subversive good time at the movies
, as intent on sending up hollywood ' s sequal syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions
.
" scream 2
" is definitely that rare movie thing
-
- a follow
- up that can stand along side its original withthe pride
. it ' s been two years since a pair ofthe overzealous horror movei fans clad in edvard munch
- esque get
- ups carved thier way through the young populace of woodsboro
, california
. those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives
. plucky heroine sidney prescott
( neve campbell
) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor coleeg
; her pop culture
- whiz pal randy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) has tagged along
. trash tabloid reporter gale weathers
( courteney cox
) hasnt written a best
- seller based on their ordeal
, the basis of which has been turned into a
( very bad
) movie called
" stab
.
"
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
, still suffering from wounds inflicted during
" scream
,
" has left his job as a police officer forthe a hwile
. life isnt tranquil
.
.
. at least for a while
. several sudden murders bring sidney
, randy
, gale
and dewey together again
,
but wiht suspicious eyes cast on each otehr
and most of those in their suroundings
-
- if these four people learned anything ffrom the past
, it ' s to trust no one
. thus
, the possible victim
/ potential killer list includes said quartet
, as well as
: derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
, sidney ' s new beau
; cici
( sara michelle gellar
)
, a chatty sorority gal
; joel
( duane martin
)
, gale ' s cameraman who ' s not too thrilled with her blood
- soaked past
; hallie
( elise neal
)
, sidney ' s sassy roommate
; debbie
( laurie metcalf
)
, a local reporter who gives gale smoe not
- too
- friendly competition
;
and mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, randy ' s good friend
and fellow film student
. cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother ' s murder in scream
, also shows uv on campus
-
-
but why
? like the first scream
, craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang
. this time
, it ' s an extended sequence that finds an african
- american cuple
( jada pinkett
and omar epps
) attending a sneak preview of
" stab
,
" making sly references about everything fomr sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non
- roles of blacks in slasher cinema
. before tragedy ensues at tje screening
, the movie
- within
- a
- movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments
, including a scene from
" stab
" which turns scream ' s now
- famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear
.
(
" b
-
-
-
-
, hang up the phone
and star
- 69 his a
-
-
!
" pinkett yells at the screen
.
) it ' s funny
, creepy sutff
( i don ' t think i ' ll ever feel safe in a movie theather agian
) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares
and spoofy laughs down the road
. another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone
- assault ofthe the killer on randy
, dewey
and gale infront broad daylight
; it builds comedically
and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made onthe these delicious characters
. there are other superb set pieces
,
but explaining them risks ruining their effect
. there are more players thsi time around as tothe provide both a higher number suspects
and a staggering body count
. it ' s something of a trade
- in
-
- the new characters are too large in number tothe be as fully
- developed as the original
" scream
" gang
,
but this movie packs inwhich knowing performances
( especially by kennedy
and cox
)
and moreso death fo your dollar
. it can be argued thast
, while the original might outclass it by a tad
, scream 2 is both scarier
and funnier
. it certainly doesn ' t skimp with shocks
-
- a major one being the killing of oen cast memeber very near
and dear to my heart
( i actually questioned craven
and williamson ' s judgement here
, considering how much this person has added tothe these films
)
. sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab
-
- the two scenes we ' re shown are dead
- on
-
-
but for film fans
, there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like
" the usual suspects
,
"
" aliens
"
and
" the empire strikes back
.
" still
,
" scream 2
" does so many things right
, it ' s petty to quibble
. its penchant for parody is irresistible
, discussions ofthe the merits of film sequels
and all
. the attractive
, solid cast is a definite bonus
.
and the denouement
( while not as shocking as
" scream
" ' s
) is priceless
; the film ' s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently reffered to in
" scream
" with one ofthe the best bad guy motives ever put on paper
. all this
and a
" scream 3
" isnt in the works
. knowing the sories ' tendancy for self
- reference
, perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice
. mentioning
" scream 2
" ' ll help them in their argument
.
