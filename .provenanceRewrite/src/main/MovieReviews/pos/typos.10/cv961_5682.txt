the latest epos from lars is a blast
,
although a rather moody one
. this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something
. the church
( calvinistic
) isnt so strict that the church bells has been removed fomr the clocktower
, they are considered being too unrestrained
. in these surroundings we find thge to
- be
- weds jan
and bess
, played by stellan skarsgaard
and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson
. jan is on leave from thge oilrig
and bess
.
. is just bess
, a bit naive
adn innocent
( in every aspect of the word
)
, at frist
. at the wedding party we are told an anecdote
, illustrating her infinite kindness
, she once lend a bike tothe an stranger
, her best friends bike
however
.
but bess is suffering inwhich this scary religious society
. we soon take part in a funeral where a man
, fallen off the orthodox path
, isnt laid to rest while doomed to hell
. women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up infront the church
. when the end ofthe the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend
, almost manic
, that her friends try to calm her down a bit
. the time has come when jan is to return to the rig
, bess is falling into the darkness of depression
, her yelling of grief
and sorrow are heard above the breaking of tyhe waves
. she can ' t stand the throught of life without her husband
. we witness her dialogues with god
( she speaks both parts
, paranoia
?
) convincing god to return jan from the oilrig
,
and her prayers are heard
. an accident on the rig bring him back
, paralysed from the neck
anbd down
. now he cant ' t satisfy her need for physical love
, he try to persuade her into finding a lover
, with thte ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him infact eveyr detail
. at first she resist
,
but her love for jan
and his assurance taht this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply
. imagine wqat this is doing to the poor girl
? the stry is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby
, accompanied by music fomr the era
; procol harum
, deep purple
, t
- rex
and others
. the use of hand
- held camera
and lack ofthe any make
- up make the characters solid
and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre
. tghe increadible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant
,
though a bit too gloomy for my taste
. i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue
( 37
. 2 le matin
)
and bitter moon
( lunes de fiel
)
. emily watson as bess
and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances
, tihs must be the reason for giving it the
" grand prix du jury
" in cannes this year
(
although we had hoped for the
" palme d ' or
"
)
. the screenplay is now available in print
, tghe transformaton being made in the period from ultimo may to july
, just in time for the danish premiere
.
