i have seen several
(
bu not that many
) woody allen movies
. i didn ' t particulary liuke radio days
, the purple rose of cairo
, play it again
, sam
. i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery
and everything
.
.
. sex
,
and i loved might aphrodite
.
however i found bullets over broadway tothe be a snoozing bore
.
and bullets got some very raving reviews
,
but i didn ' t think i ' d like
.
but i finally saw it
( doublely feature with ready to wear i think
)
anbd hated it
. since
.
.
. i loev you alsot seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn ' t sure if i ' d want to see
.
.
. thankfully i did
! people burst inot singing
and dancing
, something i hardly ever like
.
but this movie is so infectious
.
and funny
!
and entertaining
!
(
and unlike evita
, they only sing when they need to
.
) sure some of the actors may not be great singers
,
but they seems to be having a great time
,
and so does the audience
. that ' s all i have to say
. really
, if you think that is going to be a dull movie
, ytou ' re probably dead
.
and dead people should nto be forced into movie theatres
. is mark leeper dead
? he said that
" this is an almost ghastly misfire
"
. the movie isnt rated r
, for
* one
* use of the word motherf
