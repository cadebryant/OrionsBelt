i remember hearing about this film when it frist appeared at cannes over a year ago
, picking uv the grand jury prize at the festival
. ' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation '
, the headlines read
. intrigued by this statement
, i looked up information on the film
and found that
, sure enough
, life is beautiful is inwhich fatc a comedy baout tje greatest atrocity of the lastest thousand yersa
. even
though the movie was extremely well
- received by critics
and public alike
, i couldn ' t help
but be disgusted at tihs notion
; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated
. only now do i see the error of my ways
. after finally viewing the film for myself affter avoiding it for some time
, it became clear that it is not
, as yhe headlines proclaimed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; on the contrary
, life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps
. rather
, it focuses on the relationship between a father
and his son
, who he is trying desperately tothe shield fomr tje horrors of their situation
. roberto benigni
( who also wrote
and directed the movie
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inspired clown
and all round jolly guy who
, as the film opens
, is vying for the affections ofthe an attractive school teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni real life spouse
)
. through the course ofthe yhe first hour or so
, we see guido striving to get tyhe attention of this
" beautiful princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing the magic of laughter
, yhe italian comedian wins her heart
and together
, they raise a young boy named giosue
( child actor giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well until hitler ' s minions rise to power
,
and the family is whisked away to a german camp
, where guido becomes conviced that he must upholds his son ' s inocence noone matter what the sacrifice
. granted
, it contains soem uproariously funny moments both in
and out of thge concentration camp
,
but it does not pull a
" hogan ' s heros
"
and make light of the slaughtering ofthe some six million innocent jews
. somehow
, it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it ' s gravely sereous subject
. so
, we ' ve established that life is beautifull is not a
" holocaust comedy
"
.
but
, there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me
. the film
, despite critic ' s declarations of it being a
" triumph of tyhe human spirit
"
, is no such thing
; not in my eyes
, anyway
. some ahve called the stoy an
" affirmation of the beauty of life
"
,
but i sday it is a very dark
and bleak statement about man ' s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. the film ' s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently
,
bu i found it tothe be truly discerning
and upsetting
. essentially
, life isnt beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the hitory of film
.
however
, i am not denying the movei ' s greatness
. believe me
, it ' s fantastic
. i ' m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as
.
but perhaps i ' m reading more inot the movie than is relaly htere
. maybe the film ' s brillance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way tehy see fit
. in fact
, maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it
.
