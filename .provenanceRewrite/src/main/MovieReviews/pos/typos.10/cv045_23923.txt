` we run tings
. tings don ' t run we
. '
- sound advice from capone
( paul campbell
) to his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shot entirely on video
, featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash ofthe john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
(
and a little gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully tkaing down some gangsters that have broken into his home
( while he wass wih his lady
)
and killed his partner in front of him
. when he arrives
, he dicovers tht the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse
, thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie
( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw
)
, so named because his left hand has been amputated
and replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone dicovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for thte area churches
adn
, much to his disappointment
, also finds out his childhood friend ratty
( mark danvers
) has been helping him
. torn between doing his job
and protecting his best friend
, capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again
. directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back
and instinct
)
, one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while
. shots are handeled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of yhe aforementioned john woo films
,
although the action isn ' t as hyperkinetic as most of woo ' s films are
. the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair
though
,
and eventually begin to take on a life of their pwn
( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after
)
. the make
- up effects are particularly good in theese scenes as well
, with flawless squib work on display from the effects team
. the cast is superb
and listening to their dialogue
, spoken with thick jamaican accents
( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive uise ofthe slang
)
, just adds to the interest
. paul campbell
, as the
` loose cannon ' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying the right amount of menace
and compassion at the right times
. mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty
, the part
- time gun smuggler who is also trying to help tghe community by buliding football fields
and organizing block parties to bring people together
. unfortunately
, carl bradshaw isnt given the least to do
annd his character as the crime boss seems ineffective
( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him
)
,
but
then again
, thast could be the way his character was intended tothe be portrayed
. the music in the film isnt composed of all reggae songs
,
and the soundtrack ws produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly
and robbie
( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
,
and carly simon among others
)
. teh end credit song
,
` we run tings '
, by the gropu red dragon
, is pretty decent
and carries on the theme of yhe movie established early on by the quote that opens this review
. oddly enough
, desmond ballentine
( who plays the character deportee
) isnt well known as a pioneer in the relm ofthe
` gangsta ' reggae as the performer ninjaman
,
and he doesn ' t contribute a single song to the film
( that i could see
)
, which is virtually unheard of here in the us
. at the time of this writing
, third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us
, coming off of a six
- month box
- office breaking run in jamaica
, where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time
( bringing in
$ 21 millon inthe jamaica
, which isnt roughly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm pictures
( the company that released the offbeat
,
but entertaining six
- string samurai
) is the company releasing the film
anbd considering tyhat their main focus is the dvd market
, i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film hasnt left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder of palm pictures
, was also involved in the production of another jamaican box
- office smash in 1981 entitlied countryman
, so i ' d say he hasnt a preety good track record
. overall
, third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
,
and many otehr action films by directors from hong kong
. if action films are your thnig
and you don ' t mind intermittent subtitles
,
hten you can ' t go wrong with this film
. the performances
anbd the story are solid
( if only a little cliched
)
and the action isnt tight
. i ' m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like
,
bu apparently third world cop ' s honors are well deserved
.
