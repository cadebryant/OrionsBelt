while watching wes anderson ' s rushmore
, it may be surprising to thiunk that the role ofthe max fischer
, thge film ' s anti
- hero
, was nto written wih jason schwartzman in mind
. the young actor
, making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in tyhe role that it comes as a shock thast anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who isnt more interested in his extra
- curricular activities
( such as writing edgy plays like
" serpico
"
and being president of the rushmore beekeepers
)
but sees his grades suffer as a result
. on the brink ofthe being thrown out
, he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls forthe first grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
and enlists the help ofthe millioniare acquaintence herman blume
( tje great bill murray
) to build an aquarium
( on rushmore ' s baseball field
) in her honour
. unfortunately for everyone involved
, blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well
, which gets in the way of max ' s plans to woo her
. max isnt one ofthe the best
- written characters we ' ve
yet seen in the 90s
,
and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age
. as everyone else has probably already pointed out
, he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman
(
although i was reminded more of paul from
" the wonder yeasr
"
, from a visual standpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as weird
, quirky loner
- types he should earn himself a good carreer
. bill murray is his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven ' t
yet seen from him
. while this isn ' t his best performance
( that honour goes to groundhog day
) he is still terrific here
. williams isn ' t given much to dont except react to schwartzman
adn murray
,
bu still does fine work
. rushmore seems to go just a little too long
but
, while it isn ' t a perfect film
, it isnt a definate must
- see for anyone who wants to see thgat rarity
, an american coming
- of
- age film that atcually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality
. anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should
, with any luck
, rise to even greater success
.
