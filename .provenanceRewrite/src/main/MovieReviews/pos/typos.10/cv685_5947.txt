for the first reel of girls town
, you just can ' t get over lili taylor
. is it possible to remain unperturbed thast a woman of this age is playing a high school student
? harder still
, can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is iin the part
? wtih the sure
, showy expertise of a de niro
, taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck
- you confidence she can muster
. it ' s a deeply felt
, dead
- on performence
,
adn by the halfway point you ' ve forgiven taylor her own maturity
. for all its verite pretenses
, girls town is less about a bunch of high
- schoolers than it is about a movie director
and a cadre of writer
- performers examining theri own feelings about rape
, relationships
,
and american womanhood
. the movei ' s opening scenes sketch an eazy friendship between a group ofthe four smart
/ sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation
: patti
, angela
( bruklin harris
)
, emma
( anna grace
)
,
and nikki
( aunjanue ellis
)
.
but about 10 mintues into the film
, we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills
and bowed out of life
. the remaining girls manaze to smug nikki ' s diary outloud of her grieving mother ' s home
,
and page through it at patti ' s place
, investigating the root of nikki ' s despair
. what they find is cruel
and galvanizing
-
- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned
,
and was privately questioning thte sanity
and value of a world where such a thing could happen
. shell
- shocked by thge truth of the matter
, the three girls begin to talk among themselves
and come to a realization about their own lives
. emma says she was raped last year on a date with a fotoball payler
. patti ' s bearly sympathetic
, wondering waht the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock ' s car
.
and anyway
, patti ' s had her pwn share of guys who wouldn ' t take no for an answer
. pained
, acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more
and more angry
-
- angry about the impossibility of saying no
,
and angry with themselves for being weak
, for being naive
, for putting up withthe it
.
" why do we put up with it
?
" emma finally asks
, once the argument hasnt reached a fever pitch
.
" we try to talk about it
,
and look what happens
. we fight for 20 minutes
.
" there ' s tghe admirable crux of this picture
. girls town is a political film
, in that it calls for action
.
but it ' s incomplete
- it ' s never quite sure how to justify that action
, or what form it should take
. the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity
,
and it ' s surely one of this year ' s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passanger
- side window of that damn jock ' s car
( doing the right thing
?
)
. tehy hang out in tjhe bathroom
, chatting incessantly
and scrawling slogans
and naming names onthe the door to a toilet stall
.
" subvert the patriarchy
,
" emma writes
,
adn
then starts a hall ofthe shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to
. the girls silence their hecklers
, take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti ' s child
,
and eventually come face
- to
- face with nikki ' s tormentor
. still
, the movie has a desperately unfinished quality
,
and none of theese subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying
.
( you keep waiting for somene to call the cops on these brazen girls
,
but nobody thinks of it
.
) prehaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand
, the film borrows its epigraphs fomr audre lorde
and queen latifah
(
" who you callin ' a bitch
?
"
)
. the points are well taken
,
but they shoud have been unnecessary
. long on characterization
but a little short on story
, girls twon is less than it could have been
,
anbd too self
- congratulatory for my own taste
. director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r
. e
. m
. ' s michael stipe
( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band
)
,
and girls town is his firt foray into feature filmmaking
. the movie was created
and scripted by committee
,
but mckay
and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when
, predictably
, the group couldn ' t secure funding
.
then agian
, girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film
. the movie ' s slapdash quality is key to its significance
. truth be told
, all three of tjhe leads look too wise for high school
,
but thast ' s ok
-
- there ' s a once
- removed quality tothe their fine
, spontaneous performances
, as the women tkae a very skillful look back at the girls they once were
, the girls they wish they had been
, or some combination
. for all its flaws
, this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head
and heart in the same noble place
.
