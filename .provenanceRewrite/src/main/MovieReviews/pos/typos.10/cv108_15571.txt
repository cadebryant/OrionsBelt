it ' s rather stange too have two cmoputer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year
,
but that is what disney
and pixar animation
; s latest film represents
. hwile a bugs life isn ' t nearly as deepo as it ' s predecessor
, dreamwork ' s antz
, it is just as funny
. a bug ' s life centers
, appropriately
, around the life of an ant
, named flik
. flik
, cutely voiced by newsradio ' s david foley
, hates sticking too tradition
and attempts too find new ways ofthe harvesting food
and other task
. wehn one of his inventions causes the offering too be completly lost
, the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him outloud ofthe the way
. the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest fo them
. the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper
, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey
. when the offering is lost hopper is very upset
and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food
. when teh leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission
, they never dream he will be successful
, they just hope they can get him out ofthe the way so they can harvest the extra foo
. flik ' s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return
. instead flik accidentalyl hires circus performing bugs
, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors
. when he returns with the
` warriors '
, the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their hereos
. a bug ' s life has animation that is simpley stunning
. the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative
. together with the great voice acting
, this film is the perfect holiday family film
. its main weakness is that it couldn ' t beat antz to the theaters
, making it seem like stale material
.
