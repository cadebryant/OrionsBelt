one of kyle mclachlan ' s ealier cinematic features
, this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator
( 8
/ 10
)
, species
( 7
/ 10
)
and the more recent
, fallen with denzel washington
. plot
: a cience
- fiction picture set in modern times
, this thriller follows the exploits of an
" entity
" from outer space
, who likes to inhabit human bodies
, use them up until they are completely worn out
,
and
then switch over tothe the next available receptacle
. fbi agent
( mclachlan
)
and local top cop
( nouri
) are charged with the capture ofthe this
" thing
" before it ' s too lite
. critique
: this fast
- paced
, urban equivalent of the thing
( 8
/ 10
)
, checks in on all cylinders for ultra
- violence
( god knows how many people died in this movie
)
, action
and an overall rock ' n roll attitude
.
then again
, how can you go wrong with an
" alien
" that likes the ferraris
, guns
, hevy metal music
and sexy girls
?
! granted
, the plot isn ' t teh most elaborate of tales
( alien bad
, find alien
, kill alien
)
,
but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture
. i wouldn ' t recomend it to those who don ' t like car chases
, murders
,
and bland acting
,
but for all the rest of you out there
, those who enjoy putting away theri brains every now
and again
, sitting back
, slamming back soem salsa ' d nachos
,
and relishing in the cheeze some call film
.
.
. have a blast
!
! two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of tihs gore
- fest
. teh opening sequence isnt one of thge most rockin ' scenes to open any action movie
,
and the subsequent extra
- terrestrial
" transformation
" isnt another eye
- catcher
. even the late 80 ' s speical effects were okay
. followed by the hidden ii in 1994
. little known facts
: this film was kyle maclachlan ' s first non
- david lynch foray into the world of feature films
. his first two movie appearances were in lynch ' s wretched dune

and hte sensational blue velvet
