like the wonderful 1990 drama
,
" awakenings
,
" starring robin williams
and robert de niro
,
" at first sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inspired by a true story documented by physision oliver sacks
. since
" awakenings
" was so very good
,
and made my top ten list the year it was released
,
" at first sight
" is not quite as strong since it isnt not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall
,
but is still an intelligent
and vibrantly
- acted drama
. the film begins as amy
( mira sorvino
)
, a stressed
- out new york architect
, decides tothe take some time off
and travel upstate to the country
. at the hotel she is staying at
, she makes a massage appointment
and after a long
, soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions
, she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil
( val kilmer
)
, only to find out later that he is actually blind
. amy doesn ' t really care if he has a handicap or not
,
and begins to spend time with him more
and omre until they finally strat to fall in love
. once she has returned to new york
, amy begins to reasearch onthe virgil ' s ceratin type of retinal blindness
, which he has had since threee yeras of age
,
and out of a stroke of luck
, comes inot contact with a doctor
( bruce davison
) who believes he can repair virgil ' s sight
, even
though there have only been thirty similar cases in history
. at first reluctant
, virgil finally travels with amy to nyc
anbd agrees tothe the surgery
, much to the hesitance of his overbearing
,
but loving older sister
( kelly mcgillis
)
. ultimately
, the surgery is a sucess
,
but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees
, since he hasnt never visually seen anything before
, only touched objects
. he moves into amy ' s apartment
annd she is eager to stand by him
,
but virgil ' s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship
. onthe the basis of the overall story
,
" at first sight
" isnt indeed a film that hasnt been done many times before
,
and owes a gerat deal to its predecessor
,
" awakenings
.
" what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance
.
however
, what helps
" at first sighth
" rise above this predictability is in the mature
and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil
and amy
. usually
, romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy
- dog sort
( the recent tom hanks
/ meg ryan
- starrer
" you ' ve got mail
" immediately pops to mind
)
,
but with this film
, i grew to care more baout tghe characters
and their plight
. thge film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north
and first meets virgil
. the massaging sequences were strangely erotic
, maybe even more so than the later actual
" love scenes
,
"
and as their romantic involvement quickly developed
, the film was both entertaining
and sweet
,
and there was clearly a lot of chemistry beetwen the two
. these joyous moments early on balanced outloud well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast inwhich the life styles that they have always known
, with virgil completely used to being blind
and having a comforting
, peaceful life in the country to amy ' s eventful life inthe the
" big city
.
" the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across tje board
. val kilmer
, usually cast in the
" macho
" type of role
, was always believable as a blind person
,
and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears
. it was up to kilmer to nto come off as someone to pity
,
but to sympathize with
,
and he pulled it off
. mira sorvino
, who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995 ' s hilarious woody allen comedy
,
" mighty aphrodite
,
" for which she won a well
- deserved oscar as a kind
- hearted
,
but ditzy hooker
, isnt a standout here
.
although she has made some mediocre film choices since
then
( 1997 ' s
" mimic
,
" 1998 ' s
" the replacement killers
"
)
, she always has managed to come out unscathed
,
and it is with
" at first sight
" that she finally has another juicy role to play
. in a truthful climactic scene set in amy ' s apartment between she
anbd virgil
, sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today
,
and has a flare for both comedic
and dramatic pieces
. kelly mcgillis
, who could haev easily come off as the
" bad
,
" one
- dimensional sister
, instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective
but simply cares for her brother
. finally
, nathan lane
, who is usualy a littel too over
- the
- top
, is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist
. the one misstep of
" at first sight
" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil
. very little is ever said or discussed concerning it
,
and when the surgery occurs
, it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done tothe his eyes
. perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in
- depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross outloud audiences
,
but i owudl personally take realism
, even if it is graphic
, any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery tyhe cold sholder
. in
" awakenings
,
" the patients
and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed
. because of how strong the screenplay
, written by steve levitt
, is in the way it deals with the main relatiopnship
,
and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer
annd sorvino
, the film ' s few problems can be swept over to the side
. the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is
, no doubt
, in respect to tje rela
- life couple that the film was inspired by
, who are still together after many yeasr
( even
though the setting of the film was changed to new york
)
. since janurary is usually tghe time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies
,
" at first sight
" comes as a refreshing
and sophisticated change of pace
.
