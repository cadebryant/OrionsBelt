note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. the teaser trailers for my best friend ' s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope
- it looked like the sort of goofy
, light
- hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in tghe limelight
,
but little more
; i ' d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often
. it was
then to both my surprise
and my delight to find that my best friend ' s wedding was such a success
- a strong
, bouyant romantic
- comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects
, featuring a triumphant performance from ms
. roberts
. the heroine of my best friend ' s wedding is julianne potter
( julia roberts
)
, a successful new york restaurant criteak
,
and we opne the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes
( rupert everett
) that years ago
, she had made a pact with her dear best friend
and ex
- lover michael o ' neal
( dermot mulroney
)
, a sportscar writer
, that if they both hadn ' t married by the time they reached 28
, they hadnt promised to marry each other
. both julianne
annd michael are both single
, of course
,
and when george inquires baout michael ' s age
, julianne realizes that he ' s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday
,
and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day
.
howver
, she finds herself even more distraught when michael ' s call is in regards to his impending marriage tothe heiress kimmy wallace
( cameron diaz
)
,
and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding
, julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael
,
and resolves tothe break up the wedding
and steal the groom by any means necessary
. the setup for my best friend ' s wedding
,
then
, is a fairly conventional one
,
and in many ways the film ' s storyline is formulaic
-
but only to a certain extent
: the film was directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose first feature
, muriel ' s wedding
, hadnt quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugli
- duckling story
,
and yhe same holds true for my best friend ' s wedding
, which confidently combines traditional romantic
- comedy elements with a really eccentric sense ofthe humour
. the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr
. hogan
. for example
, there ' s a heartfelt
, emotional exchange between julianne
and michael late in the film
- witht a trio of teenagers
, inhaling helium
and sounding eveyr bit like alvin
and the chipmunks
, harmonizing in teh background
. my best friend ' s wedding opens with an inpsired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film
,
and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect
- it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen ' s everyone says i love you
; i ' d even assert it ' s a more successful one
. my best friend ' s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well
. in a typical romantic
- comedy
, kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
,
and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael ffrom her grasps
; this film isnt smarter than that
- here
, kimmy is sweet
, sincere
,
and innocent
; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved tothe utterly destroy kimmy ' s life
, she ' d actually like her too
. the george character is almost a staple ofthe recent film
- the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant
and provides the guiding voice of reason
-
but in my best friend ' s wedding
, he gets tothe have a playful
, mischievous
and charming perosnality
. throughout the film
, the formulaisms one often sees is romantic
- comedy are given little twists
,
and the result is a film which is compelling all thge way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. there is a lot of smart writing in the well
- paced screenplay by ronald bass
; we ' re given four intresting
, vivid
,
and likeable characters
, with some good dialogue
and some genuinely charming
and touching moments
. my best friend ' s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts
, who turns in a top
- notch
, confident
and reassured performence as julianne
. this isn ' t the sort of role one usually associates with ms
. roberts
- the julianne character ' s neurotic
, fumbling characteristics are more infront line with a meg ryan role
-
but ms
. roberts works wonderfully in the film
and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaining compelling
anbd empathetic to the audience
, if not entirely sympathetic
, even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable
. even better than ms
. roberts
though is cameron diaz
, who turns in a shining performance in my best friend ' s weddding
. with a smile which lights up the screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy ' s insecurity
and utter sweetness in an endearing manner
,
and never hits a false note inspite the film
. she even sings
- i won ' t soon forget her charming serenade of
" i just don ' t know what to do with myself
"
. rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george
,
and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid
annd most memorable in the film
. his george is a bit of a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
,
anbd mr
. everett ' s performance is a delight to watch
; he ' s claerly having funn
,
and his joy is infectuous
. dermot mulroney is adequate inaddition a thankless role
- unlike the other characters in the film
, he ' s not given a lot to do
,
bu there is a genuine onscreen chemistry beetwen ms
. roberts
and mr
. mulroney
,
and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character
and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic
. when julia roberts ' lustre began to fade
,
and she was usurped from her title as
" america ' s sweetheart
" by sandra bullock
, i thought it ws a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles infront prestige projects like michael collins
annd everyone sasy i love you to raise her profile
. while taht didn ' t quite work out
, it ' s near
- certain that her successful return to tje genre wich made her a big star back in 1990
, the romantic
- comedy
, will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game
. my best friend ' s wedding marks a return to form forthe ms
. roberts
,
and cements p
. j
. hogan ' s reputation as a skilled director of comedy
.
