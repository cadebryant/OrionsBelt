confession time
: i have never
, ever seen gone with the wind
. i don ' t know why
, really
. haven ' t wanted to check it out on video
, haven ' t been at home the nights it was on network tv
,
and it was too far to drive the last time it was on yhe big
- screen
. so right up front
, i ' ll admit that i don ' t know what the heck i ' m talking about
,
but here goes
.
.
. is titanic the gone with the wind ofthe the 1990 ' s
? maybe that ' s going a little bited too far
. as good a job as leonardo dicaprio
and kate winslet do in this movie
, they ' re noone clark gable
and vivien leigh
.
but
.
.
. the parallels are there
. gwtw was the first movei to take real advantage of teh most revolutionary technology available
-
- technicolor
. titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design iwth actors
. gwtw places america ' s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story
, titanic does the smae with thte atlantic ' s most legendary tragedy
. they both have strong
- willed redheaded heroines
, they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy
and teh slaves
/ steerage bums
, they were both incredibly expensive
and popular
.
.
. ok
, maybe that ' s not enough parallels
. so titanic ' s not in gwtw ' s league
. no marter
. titanic isnt a great movie in its own right
, complete with spills
, thrills
and
( especially
) chills
. much has been made of the humongous cost of the production
,
and all of the care than went into makeing the huge luxury liner come alive again
. the money was obviously well
- spent
. the costumes look great
, the sets look great
, the cgi graphics look great
. i especially liked the expensive little touches
, like spending tons of mony on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks
.
but writer
/ director
/ producer james cameron ' s real challenge in writting
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn ' t just costuming
and set design
annd special effects
. cameron ' s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending gogin in
. he succeeds masterfully
. cameron does twpo things that owrk incredibly well
. first
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations on titanic
( that ' s just
" titanic
"
, not
" the titanic
"
, mind you
)
. the first glimpse we get ofthe titanic is the ship in its present state
, corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic
, from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101
- year
- old rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survived the wreck in 1912
. stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role
, narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton
adn his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on hte rose character
,
and the romantic triangle between rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
)
annd the irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. the way that big
- budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all
- star cast
, so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people
. cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose
and jack
, while paying scant heed tothe the celebrities onthe board
. the supporting cast is professional
,
but mostly anonymous
-
- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown
, there ' s noone moment wehn you stop
and say
, oh
, yeah
, i know him
, what ' s he been in
.
(
allthough i would liuke tothe have seen colm meaney inaddition a white star uniform
, or even as yhe ill
- fated engineer
.
) the love stoyr itself isnt rather conventional
. i think some reviewers foudn it weak
,
and that may be a fair criticism
. the performances are the key here
. zane has the meatiest part in the movie
,
and he plays the arrogant
, condescending steel millionaire to tyhe hilt
. he ' s smooth
, he looks great in a tuxedo
,
and he ' s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet
- dicaprio relationship looks plausible
. at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat
, you can hear the wheels in his mind turning
, saying not
" can i save this little girl
?
"
,
but
" can she halp me get on a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio is a revelation
. i hadn ' t seen him before in anything
,
and didn ' t know what the heck to expect
, really
.
( honestly
, i expected a bad irish accent
,
but cameron evidently decided thast was a bad idea
, so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive
,
and being on the titanic
, that it ' s hard nto to like him
. fomr the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg
, dicaprio has to carry the movie
and keep our interest
,
and he never falters
. winslet ' s character grows up a lot during the movei
,
and so does her performance
. at first
, she ' s not required to do anything
but wear period clothing
annd look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we know from the narration that she ' s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane
,
but there isn ' t any expression of theese feelings until she encounters dicaprio
. winslet
and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movei along until the ship hits the iceberg
. it ' s at that moment where winslet ' s character really comes alive
. faced with real danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms
and does a splendid job
. as rose
and jack race arund the doomed ship
, looking for shelter from the freezing water
and cal ' s fiery temper
, winslet turns in a superb acting performence
, mixing courage
and compassion
and anger with sheer shrieking terror
. ofthe course
, the most interesting character is the ship itself
. cameron has clearly falled in love with titanic
,
and shows her in every mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down infront the boiler room
, up on tje bridge
, down in the hold
, at the captain ' s table
, down in steerage
-
-
and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead
. cameron ' s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well
.
