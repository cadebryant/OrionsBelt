usually when one is debating who the modern queen ofthe the romantic comedy is they will bring uv names like julia roberts or sandra bullock
. others will mention meg ryan
.
but for me
, it ' s not even close
. janeane garofalo is not only the queen ofthe thte romantic comedy
, she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now
.
and it ' s a good thing she ' s starring in the matchmaker
, because without her presence the movie owudl be bland
, unfunny
,
and dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide tothe boston senator john mcglory
, who is suffering in the polls
. in an attempt to capture the irish vote
, he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of otehr mcglory ' s tht never moved to america
. unfortunately for marcy
, her ivsit coincides whith the town ' s anulled matchmaking festival
. things get off to a rocky start fo marcy
though
. she has noone hotel reservations
( for no rational reason
)
and the tiny confined room
( tired old cliche '
) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub
. his name is sean
,
and marcy finds him repugnant at first
, so ytou cant obviously tell where this is headed
. the movie runs into a few roadblocks
. for instance
, hte story is very thin
. none of the characters
( except the old local matchmaker
) are nearly as interesting as garofalo
. some of the characters
, like the political aide played by denis leary
, have wandered in from a completely different movei
. i think the director realized this
and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery
,
and several close
- ups ofthe garofalo ' s winning smile
. the strange thing is that it works
. garofalo ' s charm
and tje irish scenery sould carry the thinnest ofthe stories
,
and it carries this one
.
