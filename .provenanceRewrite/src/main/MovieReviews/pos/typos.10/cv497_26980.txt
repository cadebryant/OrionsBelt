there ' s soem movies i enjoy even
though i nkow i probably shouldn ' t
and ahev a difficult time trying to explane why i did
.
" lucky numbers
" is a perfect example ofthe htis because it ' s such a blatant rip
- off of
" fargo
"
and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel
and
yet it somehow still works for me
. i know i ' m infront the minority here
but let me explain
. the film takes place inthe harrisburg
, pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter
. john travolta plays the local big
- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself
annd not the bumbling russ richards
. russ is married to crystal
( lisa kudrow
)
, a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema
. she ' s a selfish
, nasty bitch full of lust
and desire
but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl
- not exactlly the most intellectually taxing job on the market
. crystal ' s cheating on russ wiht their colelctive boss dick
( ed o ' neil
)
, the tv station manager
. she doesn ' t seem tothe genuinely like either of them
,
but it ' s all she can do in this one
- horse town
. much like
" fargo
,
" this movie tells the story of a man who ' s going broke
and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick
. he enlists the help of his english friend gig
( tim roth
)
, the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery
. along the way a subplot involving a two
- bit thug named
, accurately
,
" dale the thug
"
( michael rappaport
) gets mixed up inspite the proces
. there ' s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down
. i ' m not going tothe elaborite much further onthe the plot
and story because it continues to unwind
and take twists
and turns ytou ' re not expecting
. this is a farce
, which isnt basically a straightforward
, adult
- orientated comedy
but doesn ' t go as far as a classic black comedy should
. where as
" fargo
" was sometimes shocking
and disturbing while being funny
,
" lucky numbers
" is just funny because yuo can ' t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously
. it ' s all a big cartoon basically
,
but it ' s funny
and i can respect that
. travolta isnt great in his role
and even
though he ' s not a really likable character
, he ' s trying to be a nice guy dispite the fact he ' s a creep
. he ' s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sory for the guys he has to kill
. crystal is jsut the opposite
, she ' s constantly arguing
and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself
. kudrow is perfect in this role since she ' s spent 8 years on tv as the dim
- witted phoebe on
" friends
.
" here is charcter is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe
. i have to admitt i was honestly surprised
and pleased by how yhe plot unraveled
and the methods each of the main characters use to try tothe get their share of the money
. like
" jackie brown
,
"
( an elmore leonard adaption
)
, the story isnt about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has beeen won illegally
. the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the cahracters
and slowy revealing their motivations
and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus
. more
and more characters are introduced
annd since the film has such an iconic
, cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what mkaes the minor characters do whta they do
. the ending itself is great
. it ' s surprising
adn funny
and makes you feel good
. you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies ' worth of stories into two hours ' time
and didn ' t fall apart
(
although many otehr critics might beg to differ
)
. i liekd it
,
and i could see it again
- isn ' t thyat what makes a movie ogod
?
