. critique
:
" i feel like shooting myself in the head
" are the first words that came out of my mouth affter seeing thsi movie
, a good indication as to what kind ofthe film to expect here
. this ain ' t your average
" happy go lucky
" kind of picture
. this is a deliberately slow
- paced mystery
- horror film drenched in atmosphere
, with a very creepy insane asylum
( in whitch most of the film takes place
)
, very few clues up
- front
and lots to talk about afterwards
. will it bore some people to sleep
? you bet it will
! is it made for the scream audiences of the day
? absolutely nto
! i guess you can describe tihs film as a horror movie for the
" cerebral crowd
"
. a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame
, giving away very little with each step
anbd each soudn
, unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations
and plenty moreso to discuss later
. i ' ve always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like tje shining
and lost highway
and this film fits right into that group
. in fact
, i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i watn
but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a
" mindfuck
"
. if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly
, gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds
, tosses a few very ambiguous
and supernatural cookies your way
and isnt extremely disturbing once you put it all together
, well
,
then this movie is definitely for you
! it ' s the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate
( damn
, i missed that whole
" peanut butter
" thing
!
)
and oen that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark
.
" brrrrrrrrr
.
.
. now what was that sound in the basement
? honye
, can you go check
?
"
and one thing this film doesn ' t have
, unlike its hollywood
- ian counterparts liek the haunting
, is special effects
. in fact
, tath ' s one of the greater things about this movie
: it feels real because it looks like it ' s actually taped onthe video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances
( i did some research
and it was
, in fatc
, shot on digital video
.
.
. ah
- ha
!
)
. another great thing about it is that it ' s atcually veyr gory
and somewhat violent in theme
,
and
yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen
( it ' s mostly implied
, kids
!
)
.
and as clich
? d as it might be tothe say
.
.
. it ' s usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such
. other films that tihs one reminded me of inlude henry
: portrait of a serial killer
and the blair witch project
, with that same real sense of dread
, brooding
annd terror
. the film doesnt
however move awfully slow
and if you really don ' t get
" into
" it completely
( yuo really need to concentrate here
)
, you will loose the motion ofthe the story
and the pent
- up tension might be released
.
but overall
, this film is
yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year wtih no tight tanktops infact sight
.
and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he cin
, how can you go wrong
? definitely not a film for everyone
but a must
- see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed
( count me in
!
)
. stanley kubrick would be proud
! oh yeah
.
.
. so where ' s that gun again
.
.
.
? where ' s joblo coming from
? the blair witch project
