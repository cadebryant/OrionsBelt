, welles descends inot an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge onthe the filmmakers
. comments
: 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time
.
though it doesn ' t present a snuff film
( a movie which documents a person ' s murder fo real
, usually during or after some form of sexual act
) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness
and violence as shockingly as
, say
, natural born killers
, 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it
. it is not fun to watch
; see something else if you get upset by realistic
, sadistic violence
. htis film ' s violence
and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc
- 17 territory
. fo those with strong stomachs
,
however
, 8 mm is an intelligent
, worthwhile thriller
, especially during its second hour
. nicolas cage
, after a couple ho
- hum movies
, returns tothe material which allows him tothe utilize his strong acting abilities
. as tom welles
, a private detective
and carring family man to a wief
and newly
- born daughter
, cage skillfully
and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession
and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers
and brutal sexual deviants
. serving as a guide to this world isnt joaquin phoenix
, who plays a struggling songwriter named max california
. califronia
, despite his name
, is a surprisingly intelligent
anbd complex character
,
and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character
. the real star of thte movie
,
though
, must be peter stormare
. stormare played the
" really
, really evil guy
" in fargo
,
and his character
, dino velvet
, infact this movie seems about ten times more evil
annd unpredictable
. his performance is very chilling
. 8 mm ' s success may hardly be surprising
. it was directed by joel schumacher
, who
, hopefully
, saw thsi film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman
and robin
. before directing the last two batman duds
,
however
, schumacher ws reponsible for several well
- made horror flicks
: lost boys
, flatliners
,
and falling down
. 8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics
and is perphas most reminiscent ofthe falling down in that both films present an average man who self
- destructs before the audience ' s eyes
. 8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker
, who also penned the academy award
- winning thriller seven a few years back
. like seven
, 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts ytou well after leaving the theater
. welles is searching for answers
. how could anyone possibly drug
and
then slowly
, methodically
, sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film
? when confronting one of the perpretrators at teh end
, the murderer responds that there are no reasons
. he just enjoys it
. thgat
, walker seems to suggest
, is where thte real terror lays
: not in the crime itself
but in the fatc that rational motives do not exist
. a couple minor faults led me to my four
- star rating
( five stars is the highest rating i give
)
. one
, i found it a littel difficult
, early on
, to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film
. yes
, snuff is a horrible thing
,
but a detective of welles ' caliber hasnt probably encountered awful things before
. second
, some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient
. he dicovers
, for example
, the victum ' s diary in her private bathroom
, despite the fact the the police
, the fbi
,
and her own mother have all investigated the room before
. finally
, the closing scene seemed trite
and improbable considering the rest of the film
. despite tyhe above criticisms
, 8 mm is an engrossing story
. one ofthe the best scenes in yhe film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles
, who no longer seems like a hero
, brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film
. he pulls a gun onthe the man
and
, forthe a relatively long amount ofthe time
, struggles to decide whether or not tothe kill him
. he
then leaves the building
and calls the victim ' s mother
, in the middle of the night
, to basically see if she would support yhe action
. the entire scene is tense
, unpredictable
,
and emotionally charged
. rarely
, anymore
, do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense inspite me as 8 mm
, with scenes liuke this
, did
. 8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart
. this is a graphic
, oftentimes unflinching
, look into thge darkness whic resides infact both ordinary
and extraordinary people
. if you ' re prepared for a film of this nature
, i give it an enthusiastic recommendation
.
