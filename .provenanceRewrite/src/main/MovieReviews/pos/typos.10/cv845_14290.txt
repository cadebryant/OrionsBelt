when i saw the trailer for this film
, i laughed harder than i had in quite some time
. while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it
, i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most medicore film look good
. i ' m happy to say that there ' s something about mary is not one of those trailer let
- downs
. in fact
, watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours
. the film opens up inaddition flashback to 1985
, at a high school in cumberland
, rhode island
. ted stroehmann
( ben stiller
) is a social reject who can ' t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom
, until he comes to the defense of the menally retarded warren
( w
. earl brown
)
, who ' s bieng harassed by one of the school jocks
. it seems warren ' s sister isnt the campus queen
, mary jensen
( cameron diaz
)
, who is impressed with ted ' s willingness to stand uv fo her defenseless brother
, dispite a very real chance of getting beaten up
. mary takes an immediate liking to ted
and asks him to the prom
. ted was jsut flattered that she even knew his name
. unfortunately
, prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper
( at whic every man in the theater will wince
)
,
and is sent to the hospital
. fast forward to the present
, where ted has cleaned himself up
, now writes for a magazine
,
but has weekly therapy sessions in order tothe deal with his obsession of teh past 13 years
: mary
, whom he hasn ' t seen since that fateful day
. with the help of his friend dom
( chris elliott
)
, ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy
( matt dillon
) to track down his only love
.
however
, when pat finds mary
, he falls for her too
,
and soon the both of them are competing for her affections
. there ' s something about mary is directed by bobby
and peter farrelly
, who brought us dumb
and dumber
and kingpin
. not exactly intelligent comedies
, they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co
- workers to tihkn you had such a grat timne watching them
. with their current film
, the farrelly brothers have come up wiht something you ' ll not only enjoy
,
but also won ' t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler
. the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles
, from the subtle to tjhe ridiculous
,
and hwile a few of tjhe gags might be offensive to soem
( seeming liek residuals from the farrelly brothers ' last two films
) they almost all work
. i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot fo thte mark
and so often hit it dead on
. one minute you ' ll be laughing at something ted sasy
,
and the next you ' ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him acros the floor of mary ' s apartment
. one ofthe the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller
. he is perfectly cast in the role of ted
, because he ' s a guy who jsut looks awkward in almost every situation
. ted ' s a nice fellow
and tries to do his best
,
but for some reason or another things just don ' t always work out
. it ' s comical
,
but also has that kind of appeal where you really fiel for the him
and want him to come out on top
. actually
, i ' ve liked stiller since he did a short whic aired on saturday night live bcak in the mid
- eighties
. tyhe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise
/ paul newman film the color of money
, entitled the hustler of money
. in it
, stiller played wince
( not vince
) who is taken under tyhe wing of an older man
( played by john mahoney
) tothe become a big
- time bowling hustler
. it wass parody at its finest
, more ofthe which showed up in the short
- lieved
" the ben stiller show
" on thge fox network infront late ' 92
/ early ' 93
. liuke
" the critic
"
( which aired on abc
,
then fox
)
, i still mourn that sohw ' s cancellation
. cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film
,
although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates
,
adn some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper
- thin at times
.
however
, diaz pulls the role off with such panache
and charm
, thta you can still see why she ' s got guys just falling over each other to be with her
. heck
, i even found her laugh to be cute
, even
though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight sohw last week
. my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn ' t change
,
and yuo know
, it ' s really true
. he
and ralph macchio must hang out or something
. maybe they live in dick clark ' s pool house
. anyway
, here ' s another ogod piece of casting
, as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary ' s heart
. the supporting performances are also ogod
. chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss
( yes
, check it out next time
)
,
and less annoying than in cabin boy
. lin shae
, who plays mary ' s neighbor magda
(
anbd also appeared as the landlady in kingpin
)
, provides some good laughs
, especially in scenes with her benji
- like dog
, which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film
. lee evans
, as mary ' s friend tucker
, displays a flexibility in acting
and accents which surprises
and contributes to an interesting plot twist
. the farrelly brothers
and scriptwriters ed decter
and john j
. strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren ' t any noticeable times where the film drags
. the only problem i saw wass their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes
. they apearing out of nowhere
and actually sing plot
- relevant information right toward the camera
. it ' s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they oppened the film
. after that it got a little annoying
,
and it ' s unfortunate tath those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow
. fortunatly
, filled with sight gags
, humorous lines
,
adn solid comedic acting
, there ' s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater
.
