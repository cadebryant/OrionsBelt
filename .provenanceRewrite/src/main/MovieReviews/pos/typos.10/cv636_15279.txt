we all know tje fate of
" child ' s play
,
" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially
: sequal hell
. with the newest installment in the quasi
- popular sories currently out
( tyhat would be
" bride of chucky
"
-
and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend
, which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five
)
, it ' s kinda fun to go bakc
and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original
, a task which is a retread for some
,
and for others
( namely myself
) a chance to see what all the fuss was baout
. alas
, the original
" child ' s play
" actually isn ' t that bad
. even seeing it in the tiny
, claustrophobic
,
and mechanically
- challenged theatre at my college wasn ' t the horribly dull exprience i thought it would be
, not just because ofthe the nicely rowdy crowd
( which you almost need to watch a film like this
-
and if you don ' t believe me
, try
and watch thsi flick by yourself one day
)
,
but because as a whole
, this isn ' t a bad movie
. it ' s not great
,
but it does have twpo things that many horror films like this one don ' t have
: 1
) a rather nifty premise
,
and 2
) a sense of humor
, both which savve this from horror hell
, which is precisely where
, say
,
" i know what you did lastest summer
" has recently gone
. the premise ofthe
" child ' s play
" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray
( brad douriff
) is shot
and almost killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surrandon
- see what happens to some oscar nominees
?
)
,
and before he dies
, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul driectly into a kid ' s doll called chucky
, a doll which has got to be the scariest
- looking kid ' s doll i ' ve ever seen
. the next day
, a bum who ' s stolen it sells it to single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who
then gives it to her young son andy
( alex vincent
) for his birthday
. of course chucky begins talking to the kid
and trying to find a way to get out of the doll
,
but certain twists come up
. like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of tyhe first person he told he was inside the doll
, that being andy
.
and soon enough
, chucky is killing peopel either for revenge or for what seems like fun
,
and people are discovering that chucky isn ' t just a kiddie doll one by one
. the idea is a neat noe
, ripe for lots of comic terror
,
and luckily it utlizes a lot of that
. it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky isnt alive
, they tell people about it
,
but when he trys to prove themselves
, chucky does nothing
,
and everyone thinks they ' re crazy
. it plays with this
, as well as the whole child
- like thougth that dolls
and toys come to life
,
and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments
. even if there ' s an entire sequence devoted to cliches
( a woman alone in a house hears a noise
, goes to investigate it
,
and finds nothing
,
but wait for the kicker a second later
!
)
, there ' s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective ffrom the back seat
,
and
then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes
, leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience
. the ending is rather fun
, as well
, albeit a tad too drawn
- out
( about four different endings
, maybe five
)
,
and the characters are more intelligent than yhe average horror film line
- up
, makeing them easier to sympathize with
. if htere ' s one horrible thing baout many horror films
, it ' s that the protaganists are morons who you can ' t help
but shout obscenities at
,
and for the most part
,
" child ' s play
" steers away from that
.
and most of all
, the chucky character is a good one
, not just because he provides instant comic relief
( look
! that doll ' s moving on its own
!
)
,
bu because he ' s a generally scary character
. if there ' s anything really wrong with
" child ' s play
,
" it ' s that it ' s too trite
and hasnt too less self esteem
. at almost 90 minutes
,
" child ' s play
" features way too less to be a real classic of horror
. it throws itself inot a simple three act set
- up that renders it quick
and almost forgettable if it weren ' t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll
. if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting
, it would really push the envelope
and become even mroe than jsut a short bit of horror escapism
, which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film
.
.
. which isn ' t necessarily a bad thing
. as such
,
" child ' s play
" is content to be just the short
, typical horror film
,
but saves itself via a sense of humor
and a nice quasi
- campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short
, typical horror film
.
