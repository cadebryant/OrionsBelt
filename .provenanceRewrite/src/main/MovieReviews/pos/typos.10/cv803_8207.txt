contact
( pg
) there ' s a moment late in robert zemeckis ' s contact where i was reminded ofthe why i started writing movie reviews in yhe first palce
. we see a scientist
, dressed in a silvery space suit
, walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact
, spherical spoace pod
, unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops
. anticipation
, excitment
, anxiety
, fear
-
- the audeince experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character
, nervously
, breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead
. it is tihs sense of discovery
, the anticipation of which
and its accompanying exhilaration
, that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical
, captivating entertainment
. jodie foster stars as dr
. ellie arroway
, a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals
.
and i mean life
-
- after losing her entire family when she was young
, the only thing occupying ellie ' s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth
. affter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials
and wealthy financiers
, ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega
, which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport
. from this synopsis
, contact does not sound too different tothe most films about alien contact
,
but htere is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci
- fi hook
. the alien contact angle generates a grat amount ofthe suspense
and awe
,
but perhaps more tahn anything else
, contact is a character study of ellie
, whose obsession with empirical
, scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power
. the irony is that
, hwile admitting to having no religious faith
, she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion
and conviction that it becomes
, in a sense
, a religion in its own right
. it would be easy for scripters james v
. hart
and michael goldenberg
, in trying tothe paint a positive image of the heroine
, to champion her scientfic beleives over religeous ones
,
but they wisely eschew easy answers
, giving equal time to both sides
,
and in so doing despict ellie as not completely sane
. in the end
, there is no right or wrong
, nor is there one side that comes off omre positive in teh otehr
, even slightly so
-
- there are just twpo very viable points of view
, each with their own merits
, each with their own faults
. the complex role of ellie is an actress ' s dream
,
and foster
, a virtual shoo
- in for
yot another best actress oscar nomination next year
, more than rises to the challenge
. she conveys intelligence
, determination
, warmth
,
anbd
, in a gutsy move
, always on edge
. we root for ellie
and feel for her
,
but we also efel at times that she goes too far
. contact is clearly foster ' s vehicle
,
bu others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles
. matthew mcconaughey
, who recieves outrageously high billing fo his smallish role
, holds his own as yhe religous counterpoint tothe ellie
, spiritual scholar
and government adviser palmer joss
(
however
, his main storyline
, tyhe tentative palmer
- ellie romance
, is the film ' s weakest subplot
)
. john hurt is effectively creepy as s
. r
. hadden
, the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her reasearch funding
. angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine
. most memorable of all
,
though
, are toom skerritt
and james woods
, who play rival scientist dr
. david drumlin
and national security adviser michael litz
, respectively
; both
, especially skerritt
, embody these asshole charactors that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances
. zemeckis comes off ofthe his three
- year break in top shape
. always known as a director of effects
- laden extravaganzas
, it comes as no surprise that contact ' s visual effects are quite stunning
. the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001
: a space odyssey
,
but with more advanced technology at his disposal
, zemeckis ' s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick ' s
yet more wondrously pure
.
and zemeckis doesn ' t resist the urge to use the alwasy
- interesting incorporate
- actors
- inot
- existing
- film
- footage effect
, which isnt every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump
. effects
,
however
, are confined to only a few scenes
and clearly take a back seat to yhe drama
, emotion
,
and pure wonder
, which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump
. it syas a lot that
, in a summer science fiction film such as this
, it ' s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama
adn the issues that are raised
. the thought
- provoking
, twpo
- hour
- plus contact is a much
- welcome chanage of pace from summer no
- brainers
,
but thge fact that it is a smart film does not mean tht it also isn ' t entertaining
. fo all the interesting questions it asks
, the film is still wqat it ' s bieng sold as
-
-
" a journey to the heart of the universe
.
"
and waht a fascinating
, unforgettable journy it is
.
