htere ' s something baout ben stiller that mkaes him a populare choice amoung casting directors these dyas
. stiller currently has three projects in circulation
,
and what other actor can lay claim to that
? he ' s in
" there ' s something about mary
,
" which i
* still
* haven ' t seen
.
and he ' s in yhe acerbic
" your friends
& neighbors
,
" playing a talkative
, sexually
- frustrated drama coach called jerri
. now htere ' s
" permanent midnight
,
" in which stiller plays another jerry
, this one a heroin
- addicted television writer
, last name stahl
. there ' s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug
- addiction pictures the minute htey ' ve proved themselves commercially
. ewan mcgregor springs to mind who
, after successful turns in
" emma
"
and
" brassed off
,
" received greater respect
and admiration for his mind
- blowing realization as renton in danny boyle ' s transatlantic junk
- fest
,
" trainspotting
.
" the philosophy appears to be a simple oen
: if you want ' em to be taken seriously
, make ' em do drugs
.
" permenant midnight
" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl
, a successful hollywood writer who
, in the mid
- eighties
, had a
$ 5
, 000
- a
- week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms
and a
$ 6
, 000
- a
- week heroin habet
. a habit
, in stahl ' s own words
,
" the size of utah
.
" as stahl
, stiller contributes a commanding peformance
. unlike
" trainspotting
,
" which was successful in haveing it both ways by chronicling both the highs
and the lows of heroin abuse
,
" permanent midnight
" instead focuses on tghe concept of drug addiction as maintenance
. one ofthe the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to
" naked lunch
" author william s
. burroughs who
, when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds
,
" so i can shave
.
" stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in
" permanent midnight
"
; it ' s so he can talk to his mother on the phone
, show up for work on time
, even pay his bills
. while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl
, the writing
( adapted from stahl ' s autobiography by director david veloz
) is controlled
and pointed
.
" permanant midnight
" shows how stahl moved from new york to l
. a
. tothe
-
- again in the author ' s words
-
-
" escape the drug scene
"
( yeah
, right
)
; why he entered inot a convenient marriage with a british tv exec
( elizabeth hurley
, so impossibly polite you ' d swaer her single profanity was dubbed
)
;
and that he conceived a child in bewteen his random hirings
and firings
. stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty
( norristown ' s own maria bello
) with whom he spent some rehab time
. janeane garofalo is wasted
-
-
adn miscast
-
- as a heavily
- bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hoeks into the doped
- up wordsmith
,
and that ' s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor
. stiller
, unshaven
( burroughs tkae note
)
and with lots of mascara around the eyes
, has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck
but
, tothe his credit
, never once pushes his pill
- popping
, needle
- jabbing performance over hte top
. the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see
" permanent midnight
"
; a dark
, comic
,
and strangely absorbing study of assisted living
.
