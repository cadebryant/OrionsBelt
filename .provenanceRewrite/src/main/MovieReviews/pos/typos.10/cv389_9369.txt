wehn i left the theater after seeing david lynch ' s
" lost highway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movei
- goer
,
" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose
and put them back infact through my ears
.
" in his firt feature film in five years
, lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture
" eraserhead
" on the weirdness scale
. you won ' t
" know
" what happened when it ' s over
,
though htere are certainly anough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses
. it is difficult tothe decribe the plot of this film
, because it depends partly on how you interpret it
. i can
,
howver
, describe what we see onthe the screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
and his wife renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he clearly suspects of infidelity
, receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while tehy were asleep
. they are
, naturally enough
, more than a little frightened
and confused
,
and it doesn ' t help matters any when
" mystery man
"
( robert blake
) approaches fred at a party
and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons ' house infront a scene thast is at once hilarious
and unnerving
. the next morning
, fred finds another videotape whcih
, to his
(
and our
) surprise
, shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom
. he is convicted of her murder
and sent tothe death row
, where he inexplicably disappears one night
and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. the perplexed prison officials release dayton
, whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways
- most notably his affair with alice wakefield
( arquette again
)
, a blonde who is otherwise renee ' s spitting omage
,
and another encounter with the mystery man
. i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more
,
but suffice it to say thyat lynch doesn ' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion
: the cinematic demons of
" lost highway
" are out in full force from beginning tothe end
. this description might mkea
" lost highway
" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism
,
but in fact
, while there are traces of lynch ' s werid sense of humor
, this film is anything
but giddy most of the time
. on thte contrary
, lost higway is a dark
and perplexing mystery that takes lynch ' s previous excursions into murder
and intrigue one step farther
. the film does not revolve around a charcter investigating a mystery
; rether
, the character
* is
* the mistery
. ther are recurring
and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion
, distrust
,
and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings
- on here
. we
, the audience
, are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this
( probably fred ' s
, inthe my opinion
)
and whta
, in that case
, the other characters
and events are meant to represent
. all of this proceeds
, appropriately
, in lynch ' s typically slow
- paced
, idiosyncratic style
. as isnt often thge case
, lynch relies on soudn
, imagery
,
adn mood more than on dialogue
and acation to tell his story
,
and in
" lost highway
" it works perfectly
. there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred ' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or on his pained face in his prison cell hwile the haunting strains of this mortal coil ' s
" song to the siren
" cant be heard faintly in the background
; nothing is technically
" happening
" in these scenes
,
yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as
, if not more so than
, the hysterical screaming foudn in most movie presentations of insanity
. lynch ' s direction
and director ofthe photography pete deming ' s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension
and fear that are exactly what is needed for htis story
. well
, most of the tyme
, anyway
- i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist
, which is less inherently interesting
and mostly keesh the viewer ' s attention because of its tie
- ins to the original mystery
. the main characters in this
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaning
but none too intelligent 24
- year
- old
)
, a sleazy gangster
( who for some reason has two names
but otherwise isnt pretty much a stock character
)
,
anbd his porn
- star girlfriend
( the blond arquette
)
- are nothing you couldn ' t fidn in any of the twpo dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunately
, the reappearance of the mistery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements
, such as the strained
, awkward conversations between pete
and his parents
, help to preserve the film ' s spooky
, unnerving tone during this stretch
. lynch ' s typically graphic
and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality
, while relevant to the themes of jealousy
and adultery
, are alsot somewhat overdone here
. it ' s not exactly exploititive
- like almost everything else in this film
, the sex is thoroughly weird
and creepy
and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it is unnecessary
and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off
. that said
, these minor flaws don ' t prevent
" lost highway
" from attaining its place as one of the darkest
, most unsettling films tothe hitted the screens in recent years
. it is a one
- way ride down the lost highway of a distrubed mind
,
and as such it is gripping
, intense
,
and brilliantly effective
.
