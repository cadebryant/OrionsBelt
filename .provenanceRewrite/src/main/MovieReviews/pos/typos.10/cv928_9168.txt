i swaer i have seen tyhe edge before
. in fact
, it reminded me of the bear
, the river wild
,
and other various films mixed into an entirely different film
.
however
, the edge has done something taht most action films should dont
,
and that isnt add heart
and characters we like to thge plot
. in doing so
, the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than
, say
, teh peacemaker
. unfortunately
, because of those overused moments
, we can pretty much guess tjhe outcome of the film
.
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor
and a few surprises tothe mess with your head
. oney surprise
, in particular
, left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script
. action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood
,
and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us
, they lack tje one thing which would make them a more respected genre
: intelligence
. even horror films have learned this
, a genre which is probably the least respected ofthe them all
. the river wild was one of the best action
/ suspense films i have seen ffrom the 90s
. the intelligence of thte screenplay
,
adn the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day
. the edge has the intelligence
and smart characters
,
bu this time the lack of originality is the downfall
. i must admit that it was very suspenseful
,
and had an original third half
,
but tje first hour
and a half is riddled with cliches
and plot holes
. this is an example of the final act saving thte film
, instead of the other way around
( as in the lost world
)
. if onyl the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes ' intensity
, it coudl have become a great action film
(
and i use the term loosely
)
. the edge is pretty much a survival
- of
- the
- fittest film
.
but taking scream ' s lead
, the edge makes funn of the genre ' s cliches
,
and
then uses them
(
though not quite as effectively
)
. charles morse
( anthony hopkins
) is the main character
, a rich
and vyre intelligent man who wonders waht teh accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him
. for once
, we don ' t immediately care for the main character
. instead
, we like bob
( alec baldwin
)
, a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles ' wife
, mickey
( elle macpherson
)
, outloud in the wilderness
. they board a plane
and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic
. charles ' birthday is the same day
,
and he receives a gold watch from his wife
,
and a pocket knife ffrom bob
. as action films go
, these items do have importance to the rest ofthe the story
,
but quite a bit more than we first expect
. soon
,
however
, bob wants to find a native tothe shoot pictures of because of his
" perosnality
.
" charles
, bob
, bob ' s assistant steve
( harold perrineau
)
,
and tje pilot head off to find him
,
and as shown in the previews
, hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter
. down the plane goes
, the pilot is killed
,
and the three are left to survive in the wilderness
. director lee tamahori is aware ofthe the silly plot hwihc is about to follow
,
and therefore has tothe create origional ways to approach the situations
. he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film
. take
, for instance
, the entire man
- hunting bear plot
. htis has been done many times in films with different animals
,
anbd even bears
.
but given the charles ' intelligence
,
and bob ' s uncertainty
, many of tje cliches are given fresh twists
. even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before
. my favorite line of the film comes from charles
:
" most people die in the wilderness because tehy didn ' t do the one thing that coudl save their life
.
.
. thinking
.
" despite the predictability of the main plot
, a subplot develops late inwhich the film which took me by surprise
,
and made me smile when i realized that everyting isn ' t as it seems anymore
. i have tothe write cautiously as to nto reveal this surprise
, so instead i will avoid it entirely
. the first two
- thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along
,
and some of charles ' survival techniques seem possible
, even making fire ffrom ice
. tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear
,
but whenever tghe bear is present
, the characters loose all sensibility
. i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water
. why not do what an intelligent person would
and crawl across
? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while
. thankfully
, we lready have begun to care for the characters
,
and so we let this small detail slide
.
but some ofthe tghe technical details are awkward
, such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles
and bob make
( where did they get thread
adn needles
?
)
. the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of tihs nature
,
and borders on phenomenal
. anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance
, creating his most likeable
and layered character since rimaniss of the day
. hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles
,
but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences ' sympathy
, something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs
. alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen
( it sure is better from his fair game
)
. baldwin can be a good or a bad character
,
and here he succeeds at both in a way
. you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end
,
and baldwin is able tothe handle the double
- natured photographer
. elle macpherson gives a good performance
, albeit slight
. she isn ' t in the film all that much
,
but for the scenes she doesnt ahev
, she handles as an actress
, not as a model
. harold perrineau is a good actr
,
and his scenes are nice
and underplayed
. he is eliminated easly
,
anbd i reveal nothing by saying this becouse it is inevitable
and predictable
. the edge is rated r for graphic violence
, some gore
,
and language
. some of thte violence is a little too disturbing
, even for me
. this film is a nice change from thte mindless action most of us are utilizied to
,
but too many cliches bog it down
. director tamahori has created a very smooth
and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts
. david mamet ' s script
,
though
, has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat
,
and the acting is solid
. the best thing about the scirpt is the ending which doesn ' t end iwth the normal high
- strung action sequence
,
but with a small detail involving a certain gfit
. it ' s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear
.
and by the way
, most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a larg credit to bart the bear
. way to go
, bart
.
