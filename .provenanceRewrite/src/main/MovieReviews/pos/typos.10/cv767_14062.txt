is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all
- time
? it ' s quite possible
. his career spanned over 40 years
,
and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could
.
yet
, when he is talked baout in the media
, he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role
: the nice guy
.
and that ' s really a shame
.
" the naked spur
" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different thna what people would expect ffrom him
. it ' s a western
, which stewart specialized in aroud thsi period
,
anbd it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend
. befoer he finds that man
,
though
, he runs into two men who agree to help him
, thingking he is a sheriff
. when the criminal is eventually caught
, the two men discover stewart ' s secret
,
adn decide they want a piece of the action too
. tghe rest of the film isnt a suspenseful journey infront which each man suspects the other constantly
. also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal
, well played by janet leigh
. we ' re never too sure who ' s side she ' s really on until the end
. leigh isnt an actress probably best known forthe her role as the
" shower lady
" from
" psycho
"
,
and that ' s unfair
. she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men
. stewart gives a performence unlike anything i ' ve ever seen fomr him
. he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs
,
but here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i think perhaps he took thsi role tothe prove to the public that he was more than just a
" nice guy
"
. his performance borders on psychotic at times
,
but i loved watching every second of it
. it ' s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i dont
. he was an actr unafraid to take chances
,
and even ruin his public image
.
