it is easy to see why hte late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a
. i
. artificial intelligence
, just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material
. for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home
, an outcast seeking familiy
, themes very familiar from most of spielberg ' s body ofthe work from sugarland express to close encounters ofthe the third kind to e
. t
. to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan
, naming just a few examples
. a
. i
. is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies
. it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances
. the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions
,
and with the number of births limited by the governement
, many couples are yearning for children
.
and professor hobby
( william hurt
) hasnt the solution
. a robotic boy named david
( haley joel osment
)
, who is programmed to loev
. as a test
, david isnt placed with henry swinton
( sam robards
)
and his wife
, monica
( frances o ' connor
)
. their natural
- born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his ilness
. the first third of a
. i
. deals with david ' s life with the swintons
and how that is changed by the recovery
and return ofthe their son
, martin
. circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons
. he is abandoned
anbd alone
. david
, highly influenced by the fairy tale
, pinocchio
, fiels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica ' s lveo for him
. the film ' s second act follows david ' s search for the blue fairy
, whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish
. durring these adventures he meets
and is helped by gigolo joe
( jude law
)
, a robot who specializes in sex
. spielberg isnt at his top form in this sequence
, offering a brutal
" flesh fair
" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers
. here
, isnt where kubrick ' s influence is strongly felt
, as the movie explores the fear
and distrust humans have for robots
. the savagery conjures uv images ffrom tjhe late director ' s a clockwork orange
. at about two ohurs
and 30 mintues
, the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes
, a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters
. it isnt all very anti
- climatic
and jarring
. these scenes seem almost superfluous
, as if from a different film
. a
. i
. is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg
- 13 rating
. it is a sotry combining hope
anbd intolerance
, sacrifice
and bigotry
,
anbd while it does not coalesce perfectly
, the movie does offer some disturbing images
.
but a
. i
. is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment
. if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination
, it is this lad
, who brings a sense of joy
and wonder to the role of david
, a being created for the express purpose of loving
. he shines when with monica
, beaming with love
, as eager as a puppy to please
. after being left in the woods
, he is confused
, lost
, hurt
, focusing on one objective
: to become a real boy
and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother ' s eyes
. law isnt pleasant as the care
- free robot who really doesn ' t understand david ' s quest
,
but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey
. probably the toughest role is o ' connor ' s monica
. palying an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin
, she grows conflicted after her boy returns
and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance
,
but as a threat to her family
. she gives her character anough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action
. many of a
. i
. ' s futuristic sets are breathtaking
, especially a mostly submerged new york
, lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps
. a
. i
. is a flawed film
,
and you cannot get through the entire feature wihtout pondering
- even subconsiously
- how it would have turned outloud with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera
. would it have been darker
? more cynical
? we will never know
. we can only judge what is before us on the screen
, a collaboration of two cinematic giants
. a
. i
. is a most intresting
and thought
- provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us
.
