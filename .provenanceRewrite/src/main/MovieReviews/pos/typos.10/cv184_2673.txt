i tried hard not like thsi movie without succeeding
. it contains parts ofthe bringing up baby
, any hepburn
/ tracy film
, part of the plot of war games
, cary grant
and rosalind russell in his girl friday
, elevator shaft action
, train action
,
and murder
. it is cute
, funny
, suspenseful
( a little bit
)
, sexy
( a little bit
)
. one of the bad guys was a surprise
. the pace is fast enough
, there are some
" action
" scenes
. i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick
. julia roberts
and nick nolte are fine separately
and together
. i really identified with the julia roberts character
( wishful thinking
, i know
!
)
,
but i do have better hair
! her hair
, a very dull dark brown
, has no color
. she could use some highlights
. they both do fine with thier roles
: he ' s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle
and she ' s a hotshot
" cub
" repertwar with the chicago globe
. they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie
. i like tyhe one story focuse
. other actors inlcude charles martin smith as roberts ' boss
, olympia dukakis as nolte ' s coworker
, nora dunn also wtih tyhe chronicle
,
adn marsha mason as a congresswoman
. basically this movie is reasonably funn
. there isnt a serious mystery to solve
,
and i enjoied following a fun couple solving hte mystery
. it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselfs seriously
. i do give successful comedy high marks
.
