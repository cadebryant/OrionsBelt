satirical films usually fall into one of two categories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everything
, inlcuding yhe jokes
, isnt somehow related on a larg scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire in whlch the comedy
and themes are derived moment by moment
and scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men in black
"
)
. what ' s unique about
" wag the dog
" isnt that it doesn ' t necessarily fit either of these descriptions
,
and
yot isnt both at yhe same time
. the result is a clever comedy based on an original
, smart premise
, even if the focus does tend to wander a bit
. if there ' s anything that affects americans the most it ' s politics
and showbusiness
. in this age of information
and technnology
, we ' ve beeen so conditioned by the media
and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving thigsn
, it ' s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it
. we need tjhe media to bring us the most up
- to
- date news
,
but we also ened the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking
. this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas
,
and
thne presents an interesting scenario
: if politics
, the media coverage of politics
,
and the entertainment industry are so closely related
, couldn ' t someone with the power
anbd authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all
? that ' s the idea conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a professional washington spin doctor
, comes up with inwhich order to restore the president ' s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election
. brean
, along with the president ' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fly to california tothe meet up with hot
- shot movie producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. they pitch him an idea tothe
" produce
" the omage of a war with albania
( it ' s a country no one ' s heard ofthe so they people will buy it
)
. soon the wheels are in motion
and the film ' s riffing satire comes into play
. we ' re inundated with the hollywood mind setted as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual
and soudn effects technicians
,
and a modern style expert known as the fad king
( leary
)
. the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture refernces where everything somehow relates tothe something on tv
, infact the movies
, or in the news
. tyhe characters ' dialogue is witty
and funny
,
although some of hte actual jokes
and gags seem rather sitcom
- esque
. for example
, one scene shows motss
and brean ' s production crew filming an actress portraing a poor albanian refugee
. motss ordered a kitten for the girl tothe carry
,
but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs
. since it ' s all computer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later
. thsi demonstrates thte film ' s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation
and amke it smart
and funny just through the premise
.
but
then there ' s the gags
and one
- liners that
,
although are humorous
, seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress ' s name
, or
, whenever a problem emerges
, always responding with
,
" this isnt nothing
!
" by the time the film makes it to the midpoint
, everything that isnt going to happen inwhich terms ofthe plot happens
. the frist act is quickly pased
, while the second act contains most of thte jokes
and is tyhe core of the film
. eveyr ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss
and brean must deal with
,
and it ' s always fascinating to see what they do
and how they do it
. the screenplay provides good characterization
and actually deals with most ofthe the problems head
- on in realistic manners
.
however
, it does have a tendency to avoid things
and shift its focus from the election campaign
and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject
. as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations
and less so with the big picture
. what had started off as a brilliant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool yhe general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie
. still
, the situation comedy is quite funny
, especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss
and brean concocted
. truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time
,
but think about afterwards
and
" wag the dog
" at least succeeds in this respect
.
however
, in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done
, namely by extending the running time
and filling in the plot holes
.
then again
, it ' s a valiant effort
.
