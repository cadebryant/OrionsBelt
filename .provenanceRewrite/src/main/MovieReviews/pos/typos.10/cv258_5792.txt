jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box
- sets on thge video shelves
-
- he had a feeling that ecomonic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well
- off
. maybe it ' s a classic case of displacement
: it ' s easier to see jarvis ' own lyrics
( obsessed with acryic
and wood chip on tje wall
) as a fetishization of lowlife
, rather than leigh ' s films
.
bu it ' s worth being reminded that drab interiors
and a couple of wroking
- class characters don ' t make fo a guarantee of ' authenticity '
, let alone a good film
. it ' s the triumph of secrets
& lies
,
then
, that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common peple into a probing of just what it means tothe seek ' authenticity '
and honesty in everyday lives
. following her adopted mother ' s funeral
, hortense
, a young black optometrist
, sets out to find her birth mother
,
and is disturbed to fidn out that she is white
. it is cynthia
, a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne
. cynthia ' s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has nto seen his sister for ages
, largely beccause of his wife ' s animosity towards her
. hortense calls uv cynthia
, who initially breaks down in tears
and refuses tothe see her
.
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way tothe a warm friendship eventually
. cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party
, which maurice is hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies hasnt a simple enough theme at its heart
-
- as one character puts it
,
" best to tell the truth
, isn ' t it
? that way nobody gets hurt
.
"
.
but if thte film delivers much more than a trite message
, it ' s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths
, even while the evasions
annd unspoken grievances slowly choke us
. hence
, cynthia ' s difficulty with acknowledging
( first to herself
,
hten to others
) that hortense isnt her daughter
. one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever
" been with a black man
"
, before a long
- suppressed memory seizes her
. at thte party
, cynthia ' s pretense that hortense is her factory co
- worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies
, as agonizing as they are funny
. little lies seep inot every corner
, like maurice pretending that he ' s
" just dropping by
" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation
. maurice ' s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme
- a sad
- looking bride that maurice coaxes tothe smile
, a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring
anbd argue about his spectacles
. one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face
: she says she needs teh photo to look
" as bad as possable
" to collect insurence money
,
yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars
. ther are occasionally hilarious moments
, as whn cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception
,
" i ' ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs
"
; or when cynthia stares at her own rether pedestrian legs
and tells roxanne
,
" if you ' ve got it
, flaunt it
, is wqat i say
.
" as played by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close to being a caricature
, with her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way of talking
.
but she ' s really just right for the role ofthe someone who inspires sympathy
and
yet strains the tolerance of thsoe around her
, precisely because she ' s so needy of lveo
, perhaps
. indeed
, the hwole cast gives warmly rounded
, detailed performances
. thte script was developed partly through improvisations
,
and the fusion of cast
, script
anbd director shows best in the party scene
- seemingly everyone is talking at the same time
,
and
yet many subtle observations are being made throughout
. in a very different way
,
bu also using a long single shot
, the scene of hortense
and cynthia ' s first meeting in a lonely caf
= 8a achieves a touching intensity
, all the moreso for their reticence
and unspoken feelings
. the film ' s climax
- with all the secrets
and lies finally spilled out in ibsen
- esque revelations
,
and everybody hugging each other
- is the one thing that seems false about this film
.
however
, it ' s a film thgat truly earns its happy ending after the misery
and repression of the character ' s lives
. when cynthia says near the end
, this is the life
, innit
?
, you get the sence that
, following the cynicism of his last film naked
, leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all
, without comforting illusions
. the flying inkpot ' s rating system
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
