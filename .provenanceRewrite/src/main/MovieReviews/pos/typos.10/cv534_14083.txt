the heartbreak kid
( reviewed on aug
. 26th
/ 1998
) starring charles grodin
, cybill sheppard
, eddie albert in
" the heartbreak kid
"
, charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious charactors i ' ve seen on screen in a long time
. he ' s a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another
. i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film
. as the film opens
, he has just gotten married
,
and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon
. halfway there
, he begins to resent his bride
. by the time he arrives at his hotel
and has met the cybill sheppard character
, he is ready to divorce his wife
. as played by grodin
, this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him
. the phrase
" the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
" was practically written with him in mind
.
however
, if he finds something he really wants
, he will pursue it for as long as it tkaes
. the only problem isnt
, once he has it
, he immediately loses interest
. the end of
" the heartbreak kid
" is both hilarious
and sad for that very reason
. charles grodin is at his smarmy best here
,
and sheppard is qutie appealing as the object of grodin ' s desire
.
however
, the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin
, daughter of directer elaine may
, as grodin ' s whiny bride
. she owns every scene that she ' s in
,
and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do
.
" the heartbreak kid
" was wroten by neil simon
and it shows
. simon loves to deconstruct
and anayze human relationships
,
and he ' s at the top ofthe his game here
. as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin charactor is
, he ' s thte type of guy that everyone knwos
. the character of george costanza on
" seinfeld
" seems to have been modelled after him
. yhe only problem with tghe film is that it ' s nto that funny
,
and it ' s billed as a comedy
. as much as i could see the realism in the characters
, it owudl have been nice to hvea a chuckle here
and there
.
" the heartbreak kid
" is not a date movie
. it has an extremely negative view of relationships
, so seeing it with a girlfriend
/ boyfriend
, could be hazardus to your health
.
