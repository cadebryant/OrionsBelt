when you go to the movies as much as i do
, you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times
. such was the case wtih frequency
. every time i went to a screening
, there wass the frequency preview
. it looked awful
. it looked cheesy
, sappy
and ridiculous
. it looked like a flop
. well
, whoever put that trailer together should be fired
, because in terms of pure entertainment
, frequency is one of the best ofthe the year thus far
. frequency boasts a compelling story line
. an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan
( james caviezel
) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) through a ham radio
, despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 eyasr
. john isnt able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire
,
but by doing so causes other changes
. somehow
, a serial killer ' s reign of terror
, whihc in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders
, extends to ten victims
.
.
. including john ' s mother
. this is directer gregory hoblit ' s third film
( the other two being primal fear
and fallen
)
. with all three
, he ' s managed to attach himself to great scripts
( tihs one by toby emmerich
, whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films
)
and add equally great direction
. also
, he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick
- ass ending
. frequency is no exception
, the ending is unpredictable
and incredibly satisfying
. hoblit is three for three
,
anbd i hope he can keep it up
. now everyone can argue logic this
and logic that all you whant with the sci
- fi elements of frequency
.
bu the fact of the marter is that time travel has never beeen achieved
. who ' s to say how something works
and how it doesn ' t when it ' s never happened
? is it because we ' ve become accustomed tothe time travel
" laws
" from other places like
" star trek
"
and yhe back tothe yhe future triology
annd
" quantum leap
"
? yes
, if you sit down
and think about it
, certain plot elements in this film probably won ' t make any sense
. most films are like that
. don ' t let that dissuade you from seing tihs fantastically entertaining film
howver
. when frequency ws over
, it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug
( okay okay
, shut up
)
. when you break it down past all its sci
- fi elements
and serial killer antics
, frequency is simply a movie about a father
and his son
and the bond that they share
. it ' s touching
, it ' s sincere
,
and it ' s what ultimately makes this movie work
