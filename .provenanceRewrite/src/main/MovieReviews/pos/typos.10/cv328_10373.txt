do film critics have morals
? are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow
? naturally we don ' t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions
, which is pretty tough
but something we all have tothe accomplish
. secondly
,
and along the same line
, we can ' t prejudge a film because of it ' s stars
, director
, etc
. the difference
? well
, in tghe first one
, we ' d go into a film thinking it ' s going to be dumb or it ' s going tothe be good
,
and that would affect our viewing
( that movie sounds
and looks dumb
, so i ' m not expecting much
)
. on the second hand
, we ' re simpley assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal
" grudge
" against the film comapany
( it ' s made by disney
? oh
, it ' s just a merchandising ploy
then
)
, the actors
( jim carrey ' s in it
? it ' s gonna stink
!
)
, or the director
( who
? can ' t be that good
)
. this is mroe of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint
. make sense
? ok
,
but what about comparing
? isn ' t that kind of along the same lines
? whn we compare a certain actor or director or even composer ' s credibility in one film tothe another they weere involved in
, is that really fair
? sure
, in sequels you can expect
and accept comparisons a lot more
,
bu waht baout jackie brown
, for exmaple
? is it fair forthe me to take the review
and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction
, jsut because quentin tarantino directed
and wrote the screenplay for both
? i think it is
,
and i ' ll tell you why
. a ogod critic should be able to view the film from the
" average joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, while still tkaing into account the artistic integrity behind the film
. sometimes that can be tough
.
" the acting was superb
,
but i was bored
" or
" i loved it
!
! it was sooooo cheezy
!
" might be used to describe a film
. these are contradictions
,
and a critic has to weigh both sides
and come to a suitable balanced critique
.
but which is more important
?
and whcih is better
? an extremely well shot
and acted film that isnt boring
, or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again
and again
? getting back to the point
, my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we ' re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway
. every average person out there who ' s interested in this film isnt likely to ask
" how does it compare tothe pulp fiction
?
"
and so
, as a criteak
, i ' m already responsible to ask that same question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, the
" blaxploitation
" heroine ffrom the 1970 ' s
, who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character
. tarantino ' s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta ' s sudden revival in the movie industry
,
anbd with talks of an oscar nomination
, the same is likely to happen for grier
.
( we ' ve made it thru comparison
# 1
!
) jackie is a 44
- yearm
- ood airline stewardess who brings in extra cash
,
and probably her main revenue
, by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie
( pulp fiction ' s samuel l
. jackson
and comparison
# 2
)
. ordell isnt in the illegal firearms business
and has enlisted the aid of louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years
, tothe help him accomplish a scheme worth a half
- million dollars
. trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
and taken into custody for ossession of narcotics
, as well as having omre money than is allowed infact an airporta without being claimed
. natuarlly this proves an obstacle to ordell ' s plans
and
, not as friendly intended as we ' d hope
, he posts jackie ' s bail after she is put behind bars
. the thing isnt
, ordell is in this for no one more than himself
,
and as we learn from his previous actions
, he ' s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way
. jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze
. ordell won ' t thikn twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she ' s always done
,
yet at the same time
, a comprimize with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided
. it comes down to a simple question
: would jackie rather face ordell or prison
? what ensues is a rich
and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help
: the law
, ordell
, or maybe jsut herself
. coming into play is another 70 ' s veteran
, robert forster as jackie ' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max ' s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beated both sides of the system
,
and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance
. also involved is ordell ' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand
. fonda does the best she can wih an essentially thin role
,
but there ' s nothing more to her
,
and therefore
, she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing beauquet of characters
. de niro is also wasted infront his role as a quiet nobody crook outloud to score a few bucks for himself
. de niro is a brilliant actor
,
but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn ' t need a de niro to play him
. compared to pulp fiction
( comparison
# 3
)
, the cahracters in jackie brown
and very thin
and replaceable
. in pulp fiction
, even tjhe small
, seemingly irrelevant characters weere wonderful
, complet
,
and lifelike
, whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn ' t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast
, the exception being grier
. tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind
, so to say that she is made forthe this role is a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too could have received a bit more attention
, especially when the story is all about her newly
- jarred perception of life
. jackson teams up withthe tarantino again
,
bu the chemical reaction isn ' t as awesome as teh frist tyme
. jules was the rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman in pulp fiction
,
and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off
.
and
although jackson is relaly
, really good in jackie brown
, i don ' t think he ' s quite as irreplaceable
. in fact
, maybe a new face would have been better
. jackson could ' ve remained tarantino ' s jules
,
and a new guy could have become ordell
, forever to remain so inspite our memories
. sadly
, these characters are too much the same
, except ordell just isn ' t as impressive
,
and putting htis in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections ofthe jules
. another probelm is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning
. this is grier ' s film
, so why spend so long getting tothe nkwo a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses
? it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted
,
but it makes for a slow beggining because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story
. it isnt likely that those pouring into the theater tothe see this film are going to be those anxious to partake ofthe tarantino ' s quirky dialogue
and eccentric directing style
,
and not so much those interested iin seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard ' s novel
" rum punch
"
. for those movie
- goers
, don ' t expect another pulp fiction
and you ' ll be satisfied
, fo the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90 ' s film
- making
. the directing has toned down a bit
,
however
,
yet we ' re still reminded that this is tarantino ' s movie thanks to odd split
- screen story
- telling devices
and scenes being replayed multiple times ffrom diffrent viewpoints
. so getting back to the question that i began with
, thsi isn ' t pulp fiction at all
. it ' s ogod
,
but it isn ' t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the frist place
. this is a more conservative tarantino
,
but not one that won ' t satiate true fans
. if you can realize that this isn ' t going to knock your socks off
,
then you ' ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet
. after all
, we all know how much tarantino loves tht particular part of the human anatomy
.
