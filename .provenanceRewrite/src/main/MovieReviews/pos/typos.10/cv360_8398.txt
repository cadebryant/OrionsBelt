america has finally gotten whta it ' s needed for years
: a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics
and charisma
. regretfully it ' s only a movie
. president james marshall
( harrison ford
) is fed up with terroist activities
. teaming up with thte russian governmnet
, he orders a strike force capture ofthe alexander radek
, a reactionary general ready to re
- uite hte soviet union under his fascist reign
. during a celebration dinner
, marshall announces to yhe world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists
.
" it ' s your turn to be afraid
,
" he declares
. returning home on air force one
, he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally
. ultra
- nationalist militants loyal to radek
and lead by ivan korshunov
( gary oldman
) hijack tyhe plane threatening to kill a hostage eveyr half hour until the general is released
. marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule
( which clinton says doesn ' t exist in real life
)
but refuses
, preferring to stay
and fight
. director wolfgang peterson
(
" das boot
"
,
" in the line of fire
"
,
" outbreak
" takes the over
- used
" die hard
" theme
and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold
- your
- breath intensity
. if you cxan take your eyes off the screen
, steal a look at the audience
. everyone is totally engrossed
. the twpo actors do what they do best
and they are probably the best there are at it
. oldman hasnt become typecast as a psychotic sadist
and no wonder
-
- he does it so well
. when he engages the teenage first daughter inwhich sensitive conversation about his family
and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead
, you know that he ' s over the edge in yhe manner that people with a cause cxan become
. yuo are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time
. whn korshonov executes passengers
, htere is a frightening reality to it
. the guns in this film are deadly weapons
, not cartoons
. harrison ford has done one role for several years
. his mastery ofthe the man in the suit propeled into despeate action isnt in top form here
. marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job
. realistically
, he ' s a man afraid
,
but not afriad to act
. ford is oen of the few actors that could make us believe that the presiden of the united states could be an action hero
. indiana jones inthe the oval office
. he
and oldman ' s archetypes match uv perfectly
. the otehr roles also go to accomplished actors
. glenn close as the determined
but unsure vice
- president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she ' s not quite ready for
. dean stockwell as defense secretary eeger for the authority
(
" i ' m in charge here
!
"
) is her political nemesis
and turns in a good alexander haig performance
. of course tje politics are all wrong
. a cowboy president
( even down to his nmae
) with big guns shoots his way through problems
. much like the american collective memory of jfk ' s camelot
, the image is wondrous if you don ' t look too deep
. the pulls onthe the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film
,
but they work here
. no matter what political spin you put on the story
, the movie is an outstanding one
. i left thte theater feeling that there is hope for the country ' s future
: not a common belief nowadays
. now if we only can get ford to run for president
. just because one actor didn ' t owrk out as chief executive doesn ' t mean that a different one couldn ' t
