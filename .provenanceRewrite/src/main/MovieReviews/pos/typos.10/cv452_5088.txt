if you ' re the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland
, ytou ' re going to love the hunt for red october
. ytou ' ll also love the film if you enjoy cat
and mouse military tactics
, or if you ' re a sean connery or alec baldwin fan
, or if you admired director john mctiernan ' s earlier films
, die hard
and predator
. in fact
, the onyl people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are thsoe who have read the book
, since films almost never live uv to the novels which inspired them
. the hunt for red october is an epic thriller
, adapted from tom clancy ' s best selling novel
. set in an era before glasnost
, the movie revolves around a top
- secret soviet submarine
, called the red october
. the nucular sub has a revolutionar propulsion system
, which makes the vessel silent
and allows it to excape sonar detection
. the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius
, palyed by sean connery
. ramius has strict orders just to test tghe submarine
,
but he hasnt other idaes
. he takes the sub
adn its crew
and disappears into the atlantic ocean
. is he planning to start world war iii
? cia analyst jack ryan doesn ' t think so
; he ' s convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u
. s
. ryan
, played by alec baldwin
, is given three days to prove his theory
and find the missing sub
. the characters in tyhe hunt for red october are paper thin
,
but the performances
, thankfully
, are rock solid
. baldwin
and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor
. sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery ' s somber first officer
. it ' s ironic to see neil
and connery playing russians
, since they are both best known for thier roles as british agents
, connery as james bond
and neil as reilly
,
" ace of spies
.
" the large cast also includes scott glenn
, james earl jones
, tim curry
,
and joss ackland
, plus richard jordan as the smooth u
. s
. national security adviser
. the speical effects are remarkable
,
but more than anything
, the hunt for red october is distingquished by its water
- tight plot
. screenwriters larry ferguson
and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full ofthe twists
and turns
. they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment
. the movie doesn ' t get as sweaty or breathless as die hard
, because it would rather tell a ogod stry than hit you over the head with non
- stop action
. hte finale is rousing
and suspenseful
,
but essentially
, the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler
