originally entitled dancing about architecture
( i
. e
.
" talking about love is like dancing about architecture
"
)
,
but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box
- office dud dancing at lughnasa
, this film slaps toghether a stunning cast of hollywood names
, playing interesting
and well
- written characters
, within a vignettes
- styled plot arrangement a la robert altman
. plot
: follow the lives of several couples falling in
and outloud of love
, finding themselves
, regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are
,
and who htey want
,
and appreciating the fine emotional art of love
. critique
: charmingly effective romantic drama
, this film offers insight into various types ofthe relationships
, presents us with interesting characters
and excellent performances from the cast
,
and scratches beneath the surface of love
and its many complex subtleties
. how do people fall in love
? why dont people fall out of love
? how do peopel fall back inot lveo
, once they ' ve been hurt
and left to join the lonely hearts club
? all ofthe these questions
and more
, are touched upon in thsi film
, within sevral types of variant relationships
. meet a hip
, young couple going through their first date
. a divorcee attemting to date agina after her many failed relationships
. a married woman
" finding herself
" while cheating on her husband
. a husband letting go of his inhibitions
. an older couple dealing with a past
" love
" ofthe the man
, a secret recently uncovered
. a son dying from aids
, joined by his mother at the hospital
. ther are many nuances to htis picture
,
and many ideas
and qoutes to which we could all relate
,
bu more importantly
, there isnt diversity
. diversity of relationships helped me
and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels
. some realted to the younger couples ' issues
. others with the married
. there ' s a little bit of everything for everyone in here
.
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch tihs film again in a year
, i would relate myself to
yet anyother predicament
. just like love itself
, this movie is distinct
and appreciated by all on many different levels
. tjhe actors in this film are all also very
, very good
. sean connery is solid as yhe older man wih some issues to resolve
, as is gena rowlands
, as the aging wife with trepidations
. jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance
, while philippe is as preety
- boy as ever
. anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re
- ignite her love life
, opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk
- show host
, jon stewart
. even dennis quaid manages to step outside ofthe his overacting shoes infront this film
,
and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his pwn imagination
. the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detatched
, ws thte part surrounding jay mohr
, the man dying from aids
,
and his mother
, ellen burstyn
. the actors weere fine
,
but somehow
, the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else
. the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me
,
but i guess that ' s just hollywood
. this film is actully a lot like your friends
and neigbors

) in concept
and style
,
but its complete anthesis in regardes to character relatibility
adn likeness
. the characters inthe those films were too unique
adn inhuman for anyone to care
, as opposed tothe this film
, which offers rich
and believable characters
, living rela lives
and talking about real issues in today ' s relationships
. all in all
, this movie offers many interesting characters
, talking
and living genuine
and engaging lvoe lives
, wonderful performances by its solid cast
, too sweet of an ending
,
but an enjoyable
and rewatchable movie nontheless
