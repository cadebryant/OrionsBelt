what if one of our cities became the target for terror
? what can we do
? what can america raelly do about the increasing threat of terrorism
? what basic human rights are we willing to sacrafice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster
? so far america has been the leading nation
, opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world
. it is the land of opportunities
. it is the land of freedom
.
but what if it became the new target
? this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding inthe reality
. when a special branch of teh united states military
, under the command ofthe general william devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, tkaes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal
, islamic fundamentalists accross tjhe world tkae notice
. the only warning the fbi receives is a single
, cryptic message
:
" release him
.
"
then all hell breaks loose in new york
. a bus is destroyed
, killing 25 civilians
. a broadway theather is bombed
. hostages are taken at a school
. as the wave of terrorist activity crests
, the president must consider if the only way to save the city
and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law
. devereaux argues against that eventuality
,
bu is nevertheless ready to lead 10
, 000 men into action on american soil
. another person not inaddition favor of martial lew is anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
, the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities
. his staff is comprised of smart
, energetic
, intelligent men
and women very much unlike the usual gropu o
! f moronic feds we ' re unsed to seeing in movies
. hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, whose department knows more about the situation than they ' re willing to reveal
.
but the attacks escalate
. the fbi are helpless
, chasing an invisible enemy
. the land is under siege
. they have lost controll
.
. a terror is coming ffrom within
.
. what ' s great about this film is that it is made as if holding uv a mirror tothe life
. it reflects reality
.
and that ' s why it makes such an impact
. edward zwick has created a clever
, well written
and terrifying thriller that may vyre well be one of the best films of teh season
. the director manages to tell several stories simultanously
.
anbd so his film plays on sevral levels
, never loosing focus on its main objective
. he is exploring the abuse of power
, the distrustful relationships that exsist between various segments ofthe tje u
. s
. government
( the army
, the fbi
,
and the cia
)
. he tkaes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets
and lies are involved
. the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii
. there are concentration camps
and unlawful interments
, all inthe the name ofthe the
" greater good
.
" in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart
and soul
-
- freedom
. was that what the terror
! ists really wanted
? this film has evoked protests
and objections from the arab
- american population in the u
. s
.
and n
. y
. especially
.
but to me these protests seem unnecessary
. zwick is careful to not step over the line
and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys
. the scirpt is therefore wonderfully balanced
. agent hubbard ' s best friend
and loyal colleague frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
) is lebanese
- american
.
and it is quite often you hear lines such as
" my first boyfriend was palestinian
. htey seduce you with their suffering
" or
" they love this country as much as we do
.
"
bu no matter how you twist this matter
, yuo won ' t get away from the fact tht when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab
- speaking population who are in the great majority
. omre to the point
, the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab
- americans by the u
. s
. military
.
and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any
! way
. denzel washington is dashing as always
. in this role he is much more determined
and stronger than usual
. anette bening is enjoyable
and believeable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage
, a network of snitches
and seduction to gather inforamtion
.
. bruce willis isnt terrifying as the sadist
, hungry forthe power
, that never looses his connection wtih the audience
, since his point of view is not too hard to understand
. the film is elegantly shaped
. the scenes are easily floating inot eahc other
and the film never seems overlong
. zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension
, horror
and emotions
and does it wtih a rarely observed professionalism
. he tightens the intensity as the events progress
.
and when a plot twist comes
, it actually is surprising
. it is not a film drained in patriotism
, like the work of roland emerich
. nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values
. it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky stoy
and difficult journey
. it has courage enough to get involved in politics
. it questions our foreign policies
, mentality
and defense
. i must admitt that it ends rather disapointing
, as the director turns the patriotism way uv
and innovation down
.
but despite of thyat
, it is certainly an intteligent
annd thrilling film that provokes emotions
and thoughts
; a virtue that few summer films can boast of
.
" this is the u
. s
. army
. it ' s a broadsword
, not a scalpel
. believe me
, you do not want us in an american city
