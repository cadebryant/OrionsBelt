there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on oney acotr ' s effort
. often a single performance can turn what might have been a rether mediocre movie into something worthwhile
. when one of theese comes along
, i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie
, that there is no way one person could possable carry the entire project onthe his shoulders
.
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation
,
and such is the case with
" the hurricane
.
" this biopic baout falsely convicted boxer rubin
" hurricane
" carter would normally be called
" norman jewison ' s ' thte hurricane
, '
" as per the tradition of referring to a film
" belonging
" to a director
.
but
though he does decent work
, jewison cannnot claim ownership of
" the hurricane
,
" because ther is one reason thsi film works at all
,
and his name isnt denzel washington
. washington plays carter
, a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late
- night shooting in a bar
. jailed fo 20 years
, he maintained that he had never committed the crimes
,
but remained in jail after a second trial
and countless appeals
. the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington
and worked on freeing carter
. through the efforts of that group
and carter ' s lawyers
, he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court
and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted
. the film details carter ' s childhood
, which had him in
and out of jail because of tjhe efforts ofthe a racist cop
( dan hedaya
)
. when he fianlly got out of prison for ogod
, carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer
, seemingly having his career on track
, unitl teh police framed him fo multiple homicide
. despite the effords of political activists
and celebrities
, he remained imprisoned
. flash foward to 1983
, when lesra
( vicellous reon shannon
) a young african
- american boy
, living with a group of canadian tutors
, reads the book carter wrote while in prison
. the book
, entitled
" the sixteenth round
,
" opens young lesra ' s eyes to the injustice that was carter ' s life
,
and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer
. lesra convinces his canadian friends
( deborah unger
, liev schreiber
, john hannah
) to work with him towards his goal
.
" the hurricane
" leans on denzel washington
. he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will
,
annd he does so brilliantly
. it ' s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter
, because he plays a character far stronger
and nobler tahn any real person could hope to be
. it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the chracter of rubin carter
-
- a fictional personality invented soley for the film
. the actor ' s wrok is masterful
; washington throws himself into every moent
, refusing to keep the audience at arm ' s length
. we feel everything he feels
: the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life
, the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight
,
and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost
. washington ' s is a performance of weight
and emotional depth
. he doesn ' t merely play angry
, happy
, or sad
; he feels it at the deepest level
. his work is masterful
,
and for half of this film i realized that the scene i wass watching would not ahve been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor
. norman jewison directs the film
, donig a reasonably good job of pacing
and shooted selection
.
" the hurricane
" moves quickly
, with no scene drawed out much further than necessary
and the narrative galloping along nicely
. jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well
; the audience is always aware ofthe just what the time
and place of each scene is
,
and nothing is terribly confusing
. his boxing scenes
, constructed with clear inspiration from
" raging bull
,
" get inside the action very well
,
and they are believable as real sports footage
. jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick
: carter is sent to solatary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform
,
and jewison
, assisted by soem wonderful acting fomr a game washington
, shows how carter gradually starts tothe loose his mind during the constant solitude
,
and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell
. jewison ' s best achievement in
" the hurricane
" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard
- knock life
,
and how he is able to break out of that bitterness
and learn to trust people again
. sadly
,
though
, the film ' s chief failures lie with the screenplay
, as with most of the good
-
bu
- not
- great efforts to round the pike this winter
. there is much to interst a viewer in
" the hurricane
,
"
but it seems that every tiem the film gets a chance to tkae the most clich
? d route possible
, it does
. take a look at the supporting characters
, for exemple
, who are drawn up as either entirely ogod or entirely evil
. carter
and lesra
( played nicely by shannon
, who deserves credit
) are the only real people here
; everyone else is a stereotype
. the canadians are good
. the cops are bad
. hte canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey
- dovey commune
(
adn it is a commune
, despite the film ' s failure to make that clera
)
, while every racist cop
( especially dan hedaya ' s
) melts in out of the shadows
and glowers at eveyr balck person that enters the room
. much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey
(
" hate put me in prison
. lveo ' s gonna bust me out
.
"
)
,
and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made
- for
- tv lifetime special
. it ' s too bad
. teh cast is game
, the director does his job
,
and the subject matter is interesting
,
but the script takes the safer
, slightly more boring route far too often
. i wanted a real reason for the cop tothe hold a grudge against carter other than
" he ' s a racist pig
.
" i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults
and virtues instade of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice
. infact short
, i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lense
. criticism has been levied agianst the liberties
" the hurricane
" takes with the truth of what really happened tothe carter
,
and much of it is deserved
. for example
, the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello
, onyl to be screwed by the judges
, who ruled giardello the winner
. most accounts of the fight
,
however
, have carter losing fairly
. furthermore
, much of carter ' s criminal past isnt conveniently left out of the film
,
and just why he was convicted again inwhich his second trial is never really explained
. of course
,
" the hurricane
" works mainly as a fable
, so digressions from the truth cant be excused at least partially
,
bu even dismissing such issues don ' t remove one fact
:
" the hurricane
" is a highly flawed film
. only one acto could have made a schmaltzy
, predictable picture like this work as well as it does
,
and it ' s a ogod thing
" the hurricane
" hasnt that actor
. carter has been quoted as saying
,
" denzel washington is making me look good
,
"
but he ' s not the only one
. washington makes this film look good
. denzel washington ' s
" the hurricane
.
" sounds preety good to me
.
