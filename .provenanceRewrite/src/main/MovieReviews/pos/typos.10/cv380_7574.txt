ok
, i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start
. a romantic comedy about the trials
and tribulations of single working parents
? wih a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure
? yuck
.
but it ' s not really too bad
. it has a lot working against it
, for me at least
. inaddition addition to the above
, it is typical of a lot ofthe recent movies in that it is raelly just a glorified made
- for
- tv movie
,
but longer
and with bigger stars
,
and you have to pay tothe see it
. it does win you over
,
though
, even if it isnt painfully predictable
. just think about it
: two single parents
, with their cute kids
, are thrown together due to a missed field trip
. through a day of near disasters
, they cont inually meet
, get in one another ' s way
, cause trouble for one another
,
and generally insult one another at every opportunity
. in fact
, they hate each other so much that we nkwo that they are
, or soon will be
, in love
. the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples
. so this film is predicatble
, just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable
(
and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman ' s modle for this film
)
. will they get fired from their yuppie jobs
? will tehy make the big soccer game that is so important to thier kids
? will pfeiffer realize wqat a jerk her ex
- husband
, a drummer for bruce springsteen
, really is
( aren ' t they all
?
)
? will they finally kiss
? well
, what do you expect
?
bu there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled
, especially when it is done with as much humour
, along with a lack of sticky sentimentality
, as it is in this film
. pfeiffer
and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming
,
and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the sohw
. one word of caution
,
though
. this film is being billed in some places as a
" family
" movei
. don ' t let that stop you
.
however
, i htikn most kids
, especially boys
, would be pretty bored by this move
. aftter all
, nobody gets killed
and there are no explosions
. all in all
, a good
, non
- offensive date movie
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent sutff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
