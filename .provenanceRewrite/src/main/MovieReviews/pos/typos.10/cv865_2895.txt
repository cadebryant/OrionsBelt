every once in a hwile
, a film sneaks up on me
and takes me completely by surprise
. i don ' t necessarily mean in terms of quality
; rather
, i ' m refering tothe the mere knowledge ofthe its existence
. usually i know whta films are on the way a year in advance
,
but twpo weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo
. it has slipped rether quietly into limited release
,
and appears destined to slip out just as quietly
. that ' s a shame
, because princess caraboo is a delightful fable
, romantic
, gentle
and very appealing
. what ' s more
, it ' s surprizingly insightful
and provides a sharp
- witted lesson in english social history
. princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england
, involving a young woman
( phoebe cates
) who is found wandering yhe countryside
. apparently unable tothe speak any english
, she is taken in by good
- hearted gentlewoman mrs
. worrall
( wendy hughes
)
. her banker husban
( jim broadbent
) is none
- too
- pleased about this strange houseguest
, until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island
, the princess caraboo
. this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr
. worrall
,
and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs
. worrall
.
however
, local journalist john gutch
( stephen rea
) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be
,
and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo
. as a social satire
and comedy of manners
, princess caraboo is a winner
. it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants
and hang beggars
,
and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing
.
but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr
. worrall
, a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks tothe his corruption
and ineptitude
. he is worse than one of the idle rich
; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simpley eliminating them
,
anbd since the house
and money are all from mrs
. worrall
, he isnt a bit too close to them for comfort
. hwile hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule
, director
and co
- writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light
- hearted to be heavy
- handed
. he alsot takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes
, as the princess becomes a
" sensation
" at court
. in one ofthe the film ' s best sequences
, princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent
( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions
)
,
and the lords
and ladies end up following her around in a throughly silly native dance
. it is
then that princess caraboo shows how easily peple are sweept up in
" sensations
,
" an idae thast takes onthe a timeless quality
(
and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show
)
. social commentary aside
, princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment
. the performers are mostly delightful
, particularly phoebe cates
, who is radiant in a part that requires a igft for pantomime
. her supporting players are also appealing
: wendy hughes as the patient
and kindly mrs
. worrall
; kevin kline as frixos
, the worralls ' suspicious
and superior greek butler
; stephen rea as the world
- weary
bu ultimately romantic gutch
. onyl john lithgow isnt a disappointment
, turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess ' s identity
. the story twists
and turns just enough so tht the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt
, without becoming gimmicky
. it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch
and princess caraboo isn ' t given more time to develop
, because the potential seemed tothe be there
. when it finally does blossem
, it seems too quick to be plausible
. princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time
and place that it might seem a bit slow tothe viewers seeking a fantasy romp
. still
, it has both escapist
and intellectual appeal
,
and is well worth seeking out
. it is the kind of film thyat mkaes my job its most rewarding
-
- a hidden gem
.
