an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80 ' s
. sevigny
adn beckinsale play disco chicks alice
and charlotte
, who are onthe the lookout for love
. alice isnt mousy
, shy
, intellectual
, charlotte isnt bitchy
, out
- going
and funn
. we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures
,
and men
, all to the background of the local disco
. whit stillman has both written
and directed an interesting
and believeable story
. alice
and charlotte are both well wroten characters
,
and the actresses who play them aren ' t bad aswell
. sevigny delivers an honest performance
,
and makes the audience efel for her character
. beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified
,
yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable
. the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining
. the dialogue is sharp
and well writen
, with many funny set pieces
. for example
, there ' s a great discussion about lady
& the tramp by the main characters
. the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admitedly long film is good fun
. the direction is good
, bringing out the drama
and comedy in the scenes
.
but their are slight flaws with the movie
. firstly
,
although it is supposedly set in the 80 ' s
, the characters are very
, very 90 ' s
. tjhe way they dress
and ect have a very 90 ' s feel to them
.
although the male hairstyles look slightly 80 ' s
, frankly the 80 ' s atmosphere just wasn ' t conveyed
, which isnt a shame
. also
, as mentioned above
, the film is too long
,
and soem parts do lag
. the charm of the characters do help these moments
,
bu generally the editing could of been a bit tighter
. the plot also side
- tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust
, whlch seemed out of place in this movie
. finally
, their are almost too many characters in the film
,
and despite the running time
, the film never really spends enough time on them
. some ofthe the characters are very slight
, which is a shame
. the conclusion
, while funny
, is also surprisingly weak
,
and certainly not strong enough
.
but despite these qualms
, the last days of disco is a funny
, warm movie
, which is certainly worth seeing
,
and is a fitting homage to tghe disco era of hte 80 ' s
. worth a look
. overall rating
