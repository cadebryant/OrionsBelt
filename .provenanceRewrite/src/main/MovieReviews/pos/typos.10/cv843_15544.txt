the small
- scale film
, in limited release
,
" waking ned devine
" is a pleasant excursion to a time
anbd place which allows the audiance to absorb the full texture of a small town
. filled with breathtaking scenery
, ' characters '
,
and delightful music
, the movie would be interesting even without a plot
. the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review
. the film starts out with a sharp opening
, which gives us a taste of what is to follow
: country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny
. what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town
( pop 52
) of tullymore
. who that person isnt
,
and how tothe share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime firends jackie
( ian bannen
)
and michael
( david kelly
)
. part detectives
, part scalawags
, they hvea to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as tjhe story unfolds
. the village consists ofthe several amusing characters
. a clueless pig farmer
, temporary priest
,
and a witch
. there ' s also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything isnt on the up
-
and
- up
. there are no hollywood touches to htis film
- except for the outer spoace introduction
[

]
. pacing is right
. towords the end
, it runs a bit out of steam
,
but that ' s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we ' ve been interested in the goings on
. a mixture of laughs
and
( occasional
) sentiment
- all the right emotions are engaged
. in one brief dream sequence
- yuo ' ll know it when you see it
- a fantastic combination of color
and music transports the cahracters to a place you realy hope exists
. one of the key moments in the film
. the music
, availible on cd
( london 289 460 939
- 2
) follows the same arc as the movie
and is well worth considering
. a fine film that ' s fo everybody except action fans
. somewhat like ' the englishman who went up a hill
and came down a mountain
, '
.
.
.
but livelier
