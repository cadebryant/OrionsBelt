george little
( jonathan lipnicki
) wants a little brother
. affter mr
.
and mrs
. little
( hugh laurie
and geena davis
) visit the orphange
, they decide to adopt stuart
, a talking mouse
( voiced by michael j
. fox
)
. george isn ' t so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little hous
,
and neither isnt snowbell the family cat
( voiced by nathan lane
)
. george
and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race
,
but snowbell wants stuart out ofthe the house
( he ' s unable tothe live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it ' s ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat
)
. stuart little is a mix of live action
and computer generated imagery
( cgi
)
. the character of stuart
, while obviously a computer generated image
, grows on you as the film progresses
and you ' ll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect
. there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film
, as many of the
" supporting cast
" are actual cats
( with computer animated mouths so they can speak
)
. it ' s fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with
. stuart little isnt a charming famaly film
. there are some great laughs in the movei
( with a script co
- written by the sixth sense ' s m
. night shyamalan no less
!
)
, some moments that can only be described as
" too cute
"
( the boat race sequence is what won me over
)
and even the majority of the one
- liners
( common nowadays in children ' s films or films featuring nathan lane
) are tolerable
. kids
and parents will love this one

)
. the first commentary track features director rob minkoff
and animation supervisor henry anderson
. htey give insightful
and detailed thoughts about the film ' s production
. minkoff likes to point outloud scenes where other screenwriters came in
and polished up the script
, namely writers like scott alexander
and larry karaszewski
( who wrote the people vs
. larry flynt
and ed wood
)
adn lowell ganz
and babaloo mandel
( who wrote splash
and multiplicity
, among others
)

. the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra
and jerome chen who discuss mroe specific details of yhe effects in the film
. movie fans will enjoy the informative firt commentary track
, serious animation buffs will love the second one
. now i know this is slightly off topic
,
but it is related specifically tothe thsi dvd so i must voice this now
. noe of yhe music videos on the disc is for a song called
" i ened to know
" by a group called r angels
. this video features four mid
- teenage girls
( teh singers obviously
) having a slumber party
. the girls ask a ouija board
" i need to know
.
.
. who to do
, who to do
, who to dont
" as the song begins
. they
then sneak out of thier house
,
and along the way they strike a pose
and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits
.
then they head to a party
and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like
" i ' ll be your pleasure all the time
.
.
. just say the words that you ' ll be mine
"
. um
.
.
. what the hell
? what does this have tothe do with stuart little
? how is thsi in any way a song suitable for a kids movie
, let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd
? when the video concludes
, the words
" to be continued
" appear
. oh i can ' t wait tothe see who tehy ' ve slept witht when the toy story 2 dvd comes out
. kids won ' t care about most of the special features on this dvd
,
but those of us who can sometimes be turned inot a
" kid at heart
" thanks tothe a winning family film sure appreciate them
. this is the way to do dvd
, a good movei loaded with great features at a reasonable cost
. the di
$ ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar
