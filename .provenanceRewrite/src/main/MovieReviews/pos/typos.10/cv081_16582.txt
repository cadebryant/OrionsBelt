since 1990
, the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style
. now
, instead of emphasizing feel
- good stories replete with characters of noble virtues
, the screenplays
annd direction point toward human struggle
and sorrow
. this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times
, as 1993 ' s schindler ' s list shows
. most of today ' s mainstream drama
,
howver
, creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience
. that ' s why pictures like october sky
, whihc are a throwback to the good ol ' dramas ofthe yesteryear
, are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema
. the movie is based on the true story ofthe homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
)
, a teenager in the 1950 ' s company town of coalwood
, west virginia
. it ' s a well
- known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of thge town onthe football scholarships
; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine
. tjhe mine
, which is run by homer ' s father
( chris cooper
)
, is not the place for homer
,
however
. after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957
, homer feels a connection with the outside world
-
- as he puts it
,
" anyone in the world could look up
and see the same thnig i did
.
" drafting twpo of his best friends
and the brainiac outcast
, homer begins to construct rockets
. with the halp of their istory teacher
, miss riley
( laura dern
)
,
and several mine workers
, the four are soon bound forthe great thigsn
. october sky is a skillfully crafted film
,
and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston
. johnston
-
- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well
- known titles like jumanji
anbd tje rocketeer down tothe an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars
-
- certainly knows what he ' s doing here
. he molds characters which are true tothe life
and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward
and robust
. he does not push any barriers
,
but instade adopts a conservative style ofthe filmmaking which enhances the film ' s charm
. his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost
-
- such as the relationships betwen homer
and various mine workers
, or the silent struggle between homer ' s mother
and father
. the cast is well chosen
,
although thge true bright spots are the supporting roles
. laura dern
( jurassic park
) lends a strong performance in teh role of the history teacher
, giving the boys the support
and guidence htey ened
. her role is instantly likeable
. chris cooper
( the horse whisperer
)
, as homer ' s father
, is less likeable
-
- even downright despicable at times
-
-
but his turn here gives gravity to the movie
. he ' s definitely a driving force in homer ' s life
,
and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable
. thte script is generally cheerful
, projecting the boys ' endeavors in a lighthearted manner
. there are moments when it becomes predictable
-
- such as the train tracks scene
-
-
annd there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist
. it highlights the essence of youth
,
however
,
and forthe its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps
. october sky should be a success with audiences
.
although it doesn ' t have yhe appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she ' s all thta
, it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards
. it ' s a welcome change to the dramatic genre
,
and one that everyone should see
.
