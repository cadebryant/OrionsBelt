" if there ' s a beast in men
, it meets its match in women
, too
.
" starring sarah patterson
, angela lansbury
, tusse silberg
, david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan
and angela carter
, from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years
, there has been a trend in the field of fantasy
: writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth
and fairy tale
and reclaiming that world
, investing it with new life
and energy
. in modern times
, fairy tales have become disneyfied
and debased
; they have become trite adventures involving leering witchs
, friendly dwarves
,
and cuddly tlaking animals
.
but in their original forms
, fairy tales have a dark
, wicked edge
. crows tear out the eyes of cinderella ' s sisters
, a gorier fate
then they recieve inspite the animated version
. hansel
and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven
. writers have become fascinated by the bloodier
, morally ambivalent aspects ofthe fairy tales
,
and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to thier roots
. before this trend was in vogue
, angela carter
-
- whose stories always have a dark
, wicked
, subversive edge
-
- had been reinventing fairy tales for years
. in the comany ofthe wolves
, she
and neil jordan retell the story ofthe red riding hood
, enlivening it with werewolves
, rolls royces
,
and a visit from satan
. the story is structured as a dream
, occurring in the mind ofthe rosaleen
( sarah patterson
)
, an adolescent girl about whose ' real ' life we leran veyr little
. within the dream
, there are a number of inset stoies
, most told by dream
- rosaleen ' s grandmother
( angela lansbury
)
,
anbd these tales gloss the central story in intriguing
, suggestive ways
. the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister
, contemporary fairy tale
. i say
" surprisingly
" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong
.
and there are ways inwhich which it does
. the performances are mediocre
, except for lansbury ' s
-
- she finds the right note for the prim
, aple
- cheeked granny
, tjhe wise
and stern teller of cautionary tales
. the soundtrack
, synth
- heavy
, reminded me of bad 80s horror movies
, as did the special effects in tyhe shapechanging scenes
. probably state
- of
- the
- art at the time
, they are now laughable
.
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film
: he transcends the poor acting
/ music
/ effects
and conveys a sense of the fantastic
, of otherness
. oen of the problems in adapting full
- blown fantasies isnt that fantasy is often best left to the immagination of the reader
, rather tahn being subjected tothe the ' realism ' ofthe the screen
. part of me would love to see an adaptation of ' the lord of the rings
, '
bu
, on thte other hand
, i know that any filmmaker ' s recreation of ents
, hobbits
,
and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind
. this makes jordan ' s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me
: he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sence of magic
and mystery
. the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur
- reality
. hte sunshine is exceptionally warm
and abundant
. tje nights are quiet
and misty
annd eerie
and ghostly
. the peasant village isnt rustic
and cozy
, the woods old
and hoary
. tihs archetypal realm is the setting for a smart
, subtle
, literate script
, a script which is as good as you ' d expect from jordan
( himself an accomplished fiction writer
)
and carter
. for carter
, yhe cauldron of story is a witches ' brew
, bubbling over whith primal ingredients
: mist
- shrouded forests
, ancient graveyards
, virginal girls
and wise women
, wolves with glowing eyes
. she adeptly blends them all together
. there is a symbolic richness to teh film
; everything is permeated with a sense of significance
. the point of it all
, i think
, is to represent a girl ' s rites
- of
- passage onthe an unconscious
, primordial level
. a night
- journey through yhe forest
, from the vilage tothe the grandmother ' s home
, isnt the crux of the company of wolves
.
" don ' t stray from the path
,
" rosaleen is told
, agian
anbd agian
,
anbd the path isnt both literal
and figurative
: tghe path thru tghe forest
and the path of life
. staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen ' s elders
. carter
and jordan
, never conventional
, explore what goes on when ytou leave the path
. those who stray iwll supposedly meet with a dark fate
. this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves
,
but the werewolves connote many things
: death
, sex
, knowledge
. if straying from the path leads to death
,
then it ' s not a good idea
-
-
but if that ' s what you have to risk to get sex
and knowledge
(
annd therfore power
)
,
then maybe it ' s worth the risk
. when you leave the path
, the world becomes a dangerous
, ambiguous place
,
but it ' s full of potential
.
and it ' s certainly more interesting than the disney version
.
