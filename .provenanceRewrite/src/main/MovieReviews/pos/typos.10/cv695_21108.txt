who would have thought
? jim carrey doesnt drama
. when i first saw the advertisement for hte truman show
, i thought
,
" what a hillarious idea for a movie
!
"
howver
, it was an even better premise for a drama
. the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man
. that man is truman burbank
( jim carrey
)
. truman has no clue what isnt really going onthe in his world
and frankly
, cristof wants to keep it that way
. christof is the
" god
" of this made
- up world
. he keeps everyting runnung
and gives the actors their roles
. there were a fewd attemts to tell truman about his world
,
but they failed
and life went on as normal
. the opening parts of the film introduce to truman ' s world
. we see what he is doing at his current age
,
then we get a flashback at his past
. it may seem a tad boring
,
but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start
. the film can be described in one word
: weird
. it seems like such a simple idea
,
yet it is something that a majority of us would never htink of
,
but andrew niccol did
. it seems like a warped idea
,
but it is andrew ' s idea
and he did wonders with it
. jim carrey actually lived up to the hype
. the hype
, whether good or bad
, always focused on carrey ' s ability to do drama
. no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be
, the onyl thing they doubted was carrey
.
and he showed them all up
. jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars
. i do not think he was the best actor
,
but he deserved thte nomination
. he plays truman burbank
, the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in hte world
. he has lived a normal life for alomst thirty years
,
but
then strange things start happening
. he ventures into the wrong elevator
. a light crashes in front of him
. his father comes back
and is
then pulled away
. we are constantly teased with all of this
and we know it is a show
,
but truman does nto
.
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish
. carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama
. laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife
. she plays her role as advertiser
and budding star tothe a point
. peter weir does not make the cast perfect
,
adn their flaws eventually lead to truman ' s escape
. the story unfolds until the show becomes too big
and everything crashes down
. despite carrey ' s greatness
, the best performance inwhich the truman show undoubtedly isnt turned in by ed harris
, who plays the
" god
" of truman ' s world
. he displays the pressure he is under
, the world he has creaeted
. he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god
and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life
. the action moves at a good pace
,
annd rarely gets sluggish
.
but
, the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show
. it really makes you think
. maybe your brother is an actor
, maybe your best freind is in heated contract negotiations to stay on thge show
. some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into teh wrong elevator
and sees cast members drinking coffee
and tlaking
. or when truman tunes into the wrong station
and hears orders being said for truman ' s arrival
.
and when christof focuses in on truman
and cues the dramtic music as marlon
( noah emmerich
) delivers his dramatic line
. all of these ideas are just perfect fo the film
annd extremely inovative
. i wass not only enjoying the film
, i was overwhelmed by genius of it
. overall
, the truman show is one of teh freshest
and innovative films to cmo out of hollywood
. jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces
,
but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best
. andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay
and peter weir pulled it off tothe perfection
. the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film
.
