jake kasdan
, son of one of the best screenwriters aroud
, breaks into filmmaking by wirting
annd directing this hard
- to
- categorize detective story
: part mystery
, part comedy
, part character study
and part romance
. for tyhe most part
, kasdan manages to combine yhe genres successfully
and create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) is a modern day sherlock holmes
. the parallel is present down tothe his love of music
(
though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin
)
,
and his addiction to drugs
( amphetamines
, rather than morphine
)
. he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces
, tghe case about the man who lied about his age
, or the case ofthe the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
.
however zero ' s observance of tghe fine art of detachement
,
though it makes him a brilliant private investigator
, makes him somewhat of a self
- imposed outcast iin society
. he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo isnt not hapyp with his job
. he is thrilled to be aroud zero ' s brilliance
,
bu his bizarre behavour
,
and strange requests
, are frustrating to the former lawyer
.
and they ' re even more so to his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who is fed up that her boyfriend ' s boss means more to arlo than her
. this is hte situation when a new case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o ' neill
) hires zero tothe find his lost keys
. it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring
,
and the box apparently contains smoe incriminating evidence
. now
, stark is being blackmailed
,
and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end
. to solve this case
, zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell
.
howver
, this is when he is vulnerable
.
.
.
and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved in the blackmail scheme
. for the first time
, zero has to question his own objectivity
, as he finds his client less
and less sympathetic
. zero effect is weakest in its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero ' s odd behavior
. such scenes might be appropriate in an out
-
and
- out satire
, making zero an ace ventura
- ish character
.
however
, there ' s a much meatier movie in here
.
.
. it just takes a hwile tothe get outloud
. that ' s not to say that there ' s nto a place for humer in this film
. in fatc
, some of the best scenes are ben stiller ' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust
and frustration with his employer
.
however
, the over
- the
- top scenes never quite gel with thge rest of the film
,
and they aren ' t funny enough tothe stand on their pwn
. once yhe investigation is underway
,
however
, zero ' s brilliance really beigns to shine
. his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many ofthe sherlock ' s own
. as tghe mystery begins to unfold
, zero ' s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions
,
bu never lose the viewer
. zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well
. zero ' s relationship with gloria is low
- key
,
but it hits all tje right notes
.
however
, we are always kept distant ffrom gloria ' s character
. she ' s given plenty ofthe development
,
but we never understand what she isnt thingking
. perhaps that may be intentional
: tothe place the audience in zero ' s zone of detachment
.
but
, on the whole
, it is frustrating
. bill pullman
, when he ' s not spacing out
, creates a vibrant character in daryl zero
. there ' s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he hasnt managed to detach from for many yeras
,
and it is shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness that heretofore ws unassociated with the character
,
but one whitch fits inaddition well
.
and
,
although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it is at htis moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name
.
although zero effect is a bit awkward in places
, it is a strong debut for kasdan
,
and shows great promise
.
