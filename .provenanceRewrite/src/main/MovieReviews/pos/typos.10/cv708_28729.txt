once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek
( mike myers
) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice
, seven dwarves
and all the otehr fairy tale cahracters inaddition the land
, banished from theri home by lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
. unwittingly befriended by a non
- stop talking donkey
( eddie murphy
)
, shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad
, where he stumbles into a joust
and comes uv the winner
. his prize
? to save princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) from a tower surronded by molten flame
and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad ' s bride
. the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solatary lifestyle back in
" shrek
.
" it took four writers
( ted elliott
and terry rossio
(
" the road to el dorado
"
)
, roger s
. h
. schulman
(
" balto
"
)
and joe stillman
(
" beavis
and butthead do america
"
)
) to adapt william steig ' s children ' s book
. the bad news
? they ' ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under tjhe influence of william goldman ' s
" tjhe princess bride
.
" the good news
? there ' s so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales
and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches
. we get our first inkling that we ' re inthe for a real treat as one of farquaad ' s men
, intent on rounding up magical creatures offers ' five schillings for teh possessed boy
! ' after observing dreamworks ' rendition of disney ' s animated pinocchio
. meanwhile within the castle walls
, a gingerbread man being tortured by farquaad spits icing
and yells ' eat me
! ' before breaking down
and solemnly asking ' dont ytou know tyhe muffin man
? ' shrek
, a green giant with bobbly antennae
- like ears
, is a grumpy recluse who raelly yearns to fit in
(
although who coudl put uv with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax
?
)
. donkey is a hyperactive
, endearingly stunted creature who can talk
and
, therfore
, believes will make a great misfit pairing with tyhe uncooperative shrek
. donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess
- guarding dragon
. the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she ' s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she ' s been expecting
. when fiona ' s true colors are exposed
( including opportunies forthe some tomboyish gross outloud humor
)
, a spark develops between her
and shrek
. the script ' s details are gleefully impish
, constanly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad ' s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance
and ' it ' s a small world ' parody of an infomation booth to the blue bird which meets a most un
- disneyish fate after duetting whith fiona ' snow white ' style
. popular culture is represented with film references to
" babe
"
and
" charlies ' angels
" via
" the matrix
.
" myers chooses his ' so i married an axe murderer ' scottish brogue for shrek in order tothe give his voice some heft
. while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film
, overall it works more than not
. eddie murphy steals the show as the fast
- tlaking
, motown
- singing donkey
, proving once again his talent as a vocal performer
( is it anyother wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon
, a creature murphy portrayed in disney ' s ' mulan
? '
)
. lithgow ' s a good choice for the supercilious
, height
- challenged villain lord farquaad
. diaz is energetic
but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona
.
( a better choice would hve been minnie driver
, who ' s proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney ' s
" tarzan
,
"
" princess mononoke
"
and the
" south park
" movie
.
) the computer animation looks terific
( particularly donkey
)
,
although it won ' t elicit the types ofthe oohs
adn aahs of pixar ' s work
(
" toy story
,
"
" a bug ' s life
,
"
" toy stoy 2
"
)
. in keeping with its hip stlye
, pop music is used
, which like myer ' s voice may be initially jarring
,
but ultimately satisfies
( while surveying bridal candidates via a ' dating game ' parody brodcast by snow white ' s evil queen ' s mirror
, farquaad is told ' fiona likes pina coladas '
- cue jimmy buffet
!
)
.
" shrek
" has good lessons for kids
and humor targetted at every age group in the family
. while it may be derivative of the 1987 ' s
" the princess bride
,
"
" shrek
" addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities
and doesn ' t suffer in the comparison
.
