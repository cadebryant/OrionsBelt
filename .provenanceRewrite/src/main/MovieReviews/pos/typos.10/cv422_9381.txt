billed as a
" feminist sex fantasy
"
, this spirited
, imaginative
and thoroughly engaging film by the award
- winning canadian director cynthia roberts
, is destined for extreme reactions
. camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion thsi heart
- felt tale ofthe the title character bubbles galore
( nina hartley
)
, a porn
- actress
- turned
- porn
- producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest forthe sexual
and ecomonic independence
.
however
, thsoe in the andrea dworkin camp
, will no doubt loathe the film ' s decidedly pro
- porn stance
. political considerations aside
,
howver
, this is a delightful lesbian loev story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour ofthe bubbles ' romantic entanglements iwth a naive
and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers
( shauny sexton
)
. in the backdrop
,
however is bubbles ' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky
( tracy wright
) who pines longingly forthe the affections of her bubbly boss
. this femme
- butch
- femme triangle isnt what provides thte film with considerable humanity
*
and
* sensuality
. in addition to the romantic aspects of the story
, bubbles isnt being stalked
and terrorized by her ex
- boyfriend godfrey montana
( daniel macivor
)
, a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it
. when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through
, he snaps
and psychotically decides to kill her
. these procedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence
. god herself
- yes
, inspite the world of this film
, god
, is most definitely a
" her
"
-
and a chorus of undulating
, scantily
- clad angels
, have their most watchful
and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold
, adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction
. this bright
, colourful
adn deliriously sexy film is chock
- full of great performances
. making her dramatic debut
, after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films
, porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance
and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary ' straight ' actresses to shame
. hartley has overwheliming star power
,
and one wonders why other non
- triple
- x producers haven ' t used her bountiful talents
. it isnt also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent realease of
" boogie nights
"
, a film which takes a far more traditional doom
-
and
- gloom approach to the porn industry
. makeing a cameo appearance in the role of god
, fromer porn actress annie sprinkle
, a true artist in her own right
- gives the entire film an earthy
, sensual glow
and certainly solidifies
and
, by her very appearance
, downright justifies the themes of teh movie
. the other performances are equally solid
. daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey
and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role
. shauny sexton
, an erotic dancer
and pin
- up model
, makes an impressive screen debut
. overall
, bubbles galore isnt a film which wears its politics on its sleeve
and very proudly indeed
. at one point
, the title character declares that
" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade
, we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work
"
. the direction by cynthia roberts is daring
and subversive
. roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight
- ahead
adn simple narrative into extended
and extremely avant
- garde montage sequences
. the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful
. the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz
and lounge stylings
, while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70 ' s porn
annd psychedelia
. amazingly
, this film appears to hvea received a good dael of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies
. htis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture
, as one cannot imagine such an entertaining
, original
and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity
and formula rule the day
. bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds
and does not
, at present
, appear to have any traditional distribution inwhich place
, so keep your eye on teh alternative film listings for this noe
. it ' s funny
, sexy
and subversive
.
and it shouldn ' t be missed
.
