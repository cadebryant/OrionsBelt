-
- a review by stuart cracraft contact starring
: jodie foster
, matthew mcconaughey
, john hurt director
: robert zemeckis star after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers
- of
- 10 zoom
- out strat
( which cin be surprising to those not familiar with prof
. morrison ' s owrk
)
, contact picks up steam
, gradually
, building
, by
- the
- end
, an irresistable juggernaut
and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out
- of
- balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological
" geek
" side
. by the end
, the audience is left with what good science fiction is suppoed to do
: evoke a sense of wonder about the universe
and evoke questions in your mind about what ' s out there
. this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization
and in this sence it is unusual amongst high
- tech movies
.
however
, except for jodie foster
( elie arroway
)
and john hurt
( s
. r
. hadden
)
, who are both actors of exceptional caliber
, the supporting cast are not especially impressive
. hurt certainly has had better roles
( stephen ward in scandal
)
. this oen
, as the multi
- billionare hadden
, doesnt not do his acting skills justice
. this isnt clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation
. foster ' s radiance has never been more storng than infact the scene where she finaly meets tje vegans on their terms
. early scenes take a long
, long time to build up tothe this
. the movie ' s pacing is very good
and subtle
. the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo
and ceti iin new mexico
and puerto rico are beautiful
. the politics of foster ' s character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite
and predictable
however
. one of the most entertaining
,
but very short scenes
, is when foster is confronted by rob lowe
, durig a cabinet
- level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation
. there weere real sparks in this scene bewteen foster
and lowe
and it would behoove them to concider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored
. it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters
. everything else was very one
- sided
( e
. g
. foster
)
. lowe can stand up to foster
and it showed in that scene at the cabinet tabel
. the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far
- away world in the starsystem of vega
. it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley ' s scenes in his book steel beach
, where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior ntelligence
, in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself
,
anbd in foster ' s case
, an illusion drawed from her memory
. in another sence
, this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry ' s star trek pilot the cage
, later the menagerie
, when jeffrey hunter
and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live
and encounter aliens
. the concept is not new
, by any sense
, in the world of science fiction
.
but thge beach scene
, which is the centerpiece of the film
, as is the whole film
, is driven by foster
. freed ffrom her needs to direct by director zemecki
, foster is able to let it all hang outloud infront the characterization
and the lead she provides to her supporting cast
. as the movie gains speed
, foster ' s acting intensifies
anbd the audience really does experience it with her
. it is certainly oscar
- caliber acting
, unquestionably
. the supporting cast does well
anbd zemeckis throws in some humor whith some president clinton cameos
, cleverly manipulated
, george stephanopolus
- style
, to seem very forrest gump
. infact fact
, zemeckis et
. al
. got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie
, vis a vis clinton
.
but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton ' s walk
- ons
. the much
- discussed tension between sceince
and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course
though it is helpful to those inspite the audience who have nto
. also
, the near
- final scene
, in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing
. contact is a fitting memorial tothe the memory of carl sagan
, science popularizer
,
and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academ
. perhaps now
, sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden
