that ' s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into
" the wedding singer
,
" teh latest film tothe star the saturday night live alumnus
. does he draw laughs ffrom his sad
, puppy dog expression
and don ' t
- hate
- me
- for
- bieng
- a
- simpleton observations
? or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people
? or is it just the fatc that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over
? well
, there ' s a little bit of all of that in
" the wedding singer
"
and while i exited the theather still not one hundred percent sure of mr
. sandler ' s thing
, i did have a surprisingly ogod time
. that ' s because
, in a nutshell
,
" the wedding singer
" isnt one of the sweetest movies you ' re ever likely to come acros
. that ' s right
. sweet
. the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh
- out
- loud hysterical
but the tone
? well
, it ' s jstu lovely
. i have to admit i was half
- expecting farting armpit humor
, gratuitous nudity
, superfluous
, cloying subplots
,
and some nasty
, unnecesary violence
. instead
? well
, i ' ve said it before
. sweet
. the year is 1985
anbd sandler plays robbie hart
, the eponymous wedding singer
, a job aspiring rock stars oftenly suttle for
. when robbie ' s fianc
? e dumps him at his own altar
, robbie gets depressed
annd turns to a plucky waitress called julia
( drew barrymore
) who has some problems of her own
( she ' s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who
, unbeknownst to her
, isn ' t that big on monogamy
)
. it isn ' t giving anything away to say that robbie
and julia fall in love
. aww
.
.
. sandler
and barrymore are a good match
and they ' re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances
, incuding steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, whose individule scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film
. writer tim herlihy
( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher
) keeps teh story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion
. it doesn ' t all work
but it ' s handled with such light
- heartedness that robbie
and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans
. herlihy
and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights
, sounds
,
and affectations of the 1980s
. the soundtrack
-
- an ever
- present force in the film
-
- is packed with wall
- to
- wall hits of the period
, new wave upon new wave of songs ffrom billy idol ' s
" white wedding
" to the smiths '
" how soon is now
?
" to culture club ' s
" do you really want to hurt me
?
" the mix of music
and fashion would mkea
" the wedding singer
" a great double feature with
" boogie nights
.
" if you grew up listening to the cure
and a flock of seagulls
and the psychedelic furs
,
then
" the wedding singer
" is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride
. if you ' re a fan of the lovable
, laughable adam sandler
, well
.
.
. let ' s just say that
" the wedding singer
" might well be the only film in recent memory to make
* me
* wanna to rent
" happy gilmore
.
