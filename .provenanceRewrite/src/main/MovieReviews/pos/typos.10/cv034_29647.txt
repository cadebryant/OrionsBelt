plot
: derek zoolander is a male model
. he is also very dumb
and impressionable
. for that reason
, he is secretly hired
and trained
( so secret
, that even he doesn ' t know about it
) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia
, who wants to abolish child labor in his country
. will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed
? will zoolander ever grace the world his new
" look
"
? is this a funny movie
? find out below
.
.
. critique
: there ' s a place in our world for
" stupid comedies
"
. films which don ' t pretend to take themselves seriously
, are based on idiotic premises
and filled with dumb jokes
. there ' s also a time for them
and many woudl argue that this difficult period of our history
, might be an ideal circumstance during whlch to
" relax
" by watching something so completely frivolous
. well
, if you ' re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment
, ben stiller
and his cast of many have assembled one of the moreso original dumb comedies in some time
. of course
, comedies as such are usually very subjective
and i could see how some will see this film simpley as stupid
and unfunny
, while others will grant them the
" stupid
"
,
but consider it funny instead
. i personaly enjoyed it for the most part
, cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences
and loved the derek zoolander character
and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry
. snap
! it was also nice to see several rela
- life models with small roles in the movie
, nto tkaing themselves too seriously
.
and if you ' re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films
, well
, don ' t look any furhter because dozens of famous faces show up here incuding vince vaughn
, billy zane
, winona ryder
, christian slater
, david duchovny
, natalie portman
and many
, many others
. i expecially liked andy dick ' s complete make
- over as the masseuse
. hi
- larious
!
but with all films of thsi type
, there is bound to be some stuff tht simply doesn ' t work
. a few particulars which didn ' t strike my fancy included the bulimia
and
" orgy
" sequence with christine taylor
, the break
- dance fighting
,
and i also never get why tehy use rela countries in plots like this
( why not just
" make up
" a country
, instead of zeroing in on a certain people
?
)
. i also coudl have done with less ofthe the taylor character in general
, since she wasn ' t all that interesting
and seemed to slow things down every now
and
then
( more zoolander
, dude
!
)
.
but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the mroe memorable scenes which definitly did wrok for me
! i almost pissed myself during the
" gas station
" disaster
, absolutely adored the
" walk
- off
" contest
( with david bowie as the judge
, no less
)
and appreciated many of zoolander ' s moronic one
- liners
(
" i was a merman
.
.
. a merman
!
!
"
)
.
and i dare you to git his
" monkey
" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie
(
" you ' re a monkey
, derek
.
.
. a monkey
!
"
) i also really liked the soundtrack
and the pace of the film
, both of which zipped
and zagged
,
annd established a nice rhythm to it all
. again
, it ' s to note that thsi movie is dumb
and not for everyone
,
but my guess is thast if you laughed at the trailer
, you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well
. if you thought the trailer was dumb
, skip this dodo bird
and go rent austin powers again or something
, a film from which there isnt an obvious influence here
. blue steel
, baby
.
.
. yeah
