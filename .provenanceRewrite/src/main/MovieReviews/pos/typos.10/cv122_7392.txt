- the most ironical aspect ofthe nuclear war is that it doesn ' t have a winning side
and a losing side
. in a nucular confrontation
, everybody loses
,
and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world
-
- assuming the world survives
. the idae

-
and perhaps the only real option

- isnt to avoid war at all costs
. this is the theme of sidney lumet ' s
" fail
- safe
,
" a fictonal drama based on the novel by eugene burdick
and harvey wheeler
.
" fail
- safe
" takes place during the heart of the cold war
( the actual film was released two years after tyhe cuban missile crisis
)
, when the united states
and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word
: communism
. the premise centers around a combination of accidents
anbd operation flaws
. five u
. s
. bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft isnt spotted heading toward amercia
. the unidentified aircraft turns outloud to be a commercial airliner
,
but a mechanical failure strikes the millitary base thta commands the bombers
. suddenly out of contact
,
and with standing orders tothe remain on course until receiving new directives
, the bomber pilots cannot be recalled
,
and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike
. a great dael of
" fail
- safe
" ' s plot follows various charactors as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u
. s
. bombers from reaching russia ' s borders
-
- at any cost
. thge plot is compelling
,
and hte story creates urgency
and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios
. the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after anyother fails
. general bogan
( frank overton
)
, taking orders directly from the presdient of the united states himself
( henry fonda
)
, isnt powerless
-
- the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated
, pre
- programmed system that may not be stoppable
, simply becouse the creators of the war machines were too efficient infact their task tothe make a no
- win situation winnable
. the events in
" fail
- safe
" are fascinating becouse they ' re anything
bu predictable
,
but teh real reason
" fail
- safe
" works is because it understands more about nuculear war than what exists within the confines of its plot
. a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war
, communism
, the cold war
,
and the united states ' role in all of it
. most of this is through the film ' s use of the character groeteschele
( walter matthau
)
, an arrogant civillian theorist of nuclear weapons use who
, incidentally
, is onthe the presidnt ' s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war
. many of the film ' s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices
. early in the film
, he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of
" stradegy
" in a nuclear assault to
" minimize
" casualties
.
" what ' s the difference between 60 millon
and 100 million dead
?
" a guest asks impatiently
.
" forty million
,
" groeteschele responds wryly
. the problem with groeteschele ' s mindset is that he
* believes
* nucular combat to be a viable method of war
. the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon
and convetional warfare is the raw data
and the casulaty totals
. groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over
.
yet his answer to the arms race isnt not to slow down
and try to kool the situation off
, as general black
( dan o ' herlihy
) has often recommended
. on the contrary
-
- according to groeteschele
, that owudl lead to russia having
* more
* nuclear weapons than the u
. s
.
, which would clearly put america at a disadvantage
. such a stance ws perhaps yhe central paradox
and misguided practice of the arms race
.
" fail
- safe
" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war
,
and
, likewise
, it becomes a central theme in the film
. why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over
? is it wise
? is it even logical
? no
, not really
.
although
" fail
- safe
" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications ofthe communism
, there isnt a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial
, one
- sided sort ofthe way
. again
, this is achieved through groeteschele
, who is easily the film ' s most important character in terms of the larger
- theme significance
. in addition to providing the central
" pro
- nuclear war
" voice that the film warns against
, he alsot makes key remarks baout communists that show just how much fear
and resentment people of tjhe perido weere prone tothe when it came to communism
. tghe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib
. one of groeteschele ' s
" logical
" trains of thought ventures so far inot fantasy theroretical prediction that it ' s merely absurd
. he labels the average marxist an
" unfeeling
, calculating machine
" that will dont whatever it tkaes to preserve itself
. groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u
. s
. drops the warhead on moscow
, the soviets will
* instantly
* surrender
, for to retailate would invite counter
- measures that would further destroy russia ' s home soil
-
- which must be preserved at all costs
. groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions
; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets woudl attack out of revenge
-
- as any normal person would
. tghe irony here is groeteschele ' s own mechanical theorizing
. he is so quick tothe judge the enemy that he doesn ' t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns
. once tje film makes it evident that turning the u
. s
. bombers will be impossible
, the question becomes what the
* consequences
* of destroying moscow will be
. just how will the soviet union ' s leader react
,
and what can the presidet do to convey his best intentions
?
( just
* how
* does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an
* mishap
*
?
) with the help of his transaltor buck
( larry hagman
)
, the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader
, inthe scenes that prove amazingly taut
and powerful in their simplicity
, with lumet ' s long takes of fonda
and hagman in the same frame
, exchanging the dialog between the president
and the soviet leader
. without getting into too much detail
, i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly
,
yot necessary
and as sensible as possible under the circumstances
.
( that is
, as sensible as a nuclear
" incident
" can probably be
.
) it does accomplish what it must
: it avoids an all
- out war
, something that simply isn ' t possible because of its all
- too
- real consequences
. dramatically
, the ending is quite powerful
,
and the use of o ' herlihy ' s character as the symbolic
" matador
"
( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from yhe film ' s opening
)
, is particularly appropriate
.
" fail
- safe
" is a production of a major hollywood studio
( released by columbia pictures
)
,
and it has the structure of a high
- tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film
. nevertheless
, under lumet ' s direction
and walter bernstein ' s intelligent adaptions of burdick ' s
and wheeler ' s novel
, the film continues to hvea a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded
. the film often warns tyhat the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming
.
bu it was the conscious
, human choice tothe
* initialize
* this automatic arming that
" fail
- safe
" also finds dangerous
. in retrospect
, the arms race seems to be one ofthe the most puzzling exercises in futility ofthe the century
. it ' s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses
and slow down
, rather than continuing groeteschele ' s dangerous approach of speeding uv
adn causing a possible meltdown
