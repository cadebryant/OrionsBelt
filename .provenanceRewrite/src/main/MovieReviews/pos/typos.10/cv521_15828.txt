one ofthe thte sweetest tales to ever be made
, it ' s a wonderful life isn ' t perfect
,
but its good natured charm
and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results
. probably the greatest
" feel
- good
" film of all time
, it ' s a wonderful life aims for the heart
,
and strikes with a golden arrow
. onthe christmas eve
, george bailey
( stewart
) is being prayed forthe by many in the small town of bedford falls
. you see
, george is in trouble
,
and he has always helped others who needed it
. this one time
,
however
, god answers his prayers
,
and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence
( travers
) to try
and save george
. clarence has got his own problems
,
however
. clarence is an angel without his wings
,
and each time the bell rings
, hte wings pass him by
. the bailey case is a way forthe him to earn those magical wings
adn become a true angel
.
but before clarence can save george
, he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey ' s life
. we see george sacrificing his hearing to sive his brother ' s life
, sacrificing his college education to save the family business
, sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother
,
and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else
. when the bank his family owns is in trouble
, george gives awya his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn ' t sold to the evil mr
. potter
( barrymore
)
, who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls
. one christmas
, potter gets his chance
. uncle billy bailey
( mitchell
) loses
$ 8
, 000 ofthe the bank ' s money
. without the money
, the bank must close down
. george is stuck in a tremendous bind
,
and contemplates suicide
. clarence
, the faithful servant
, is there just to pick him up
,
and to show him what bedford would be like without george
. this is all a lead
- in to the very famous last scene
, where george finally sees whta true happiness is about
. it ' s a wonderful life does have its faults
. the movie is beginning to efel dated in the details
, especially in the treatment of women
and men
. the sex roles in the film are weirdly out ofthe place in the 90 ' s
, liek something outloud ofthe a revisionist look
. all tjhe men drink too much
and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film
. there are
,
however
, endearing moments in all of this
. capra puts inspite just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50 ' s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable
. the sotry is hackneyed
,
and the ending feels
, well
, a little too sugarish
. there ' s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything
, especially the sequences where george is either in trouble
, or helping somebody
. it ' s a little too nice for my liking
, at times
. there is
,
however
, enough humor
, anough wit
,
and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part
, which would be the most difficult
.
but watching it ' s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult
: it ' s always interesting
, right until the finale
, which
, for all its sugar
, makes delightful sense
and is beautifully done
. capra does ahve his monumental cliches
,
but the actors relish them
and overplay everything to perfection
. donna reed is perfect as the loving
, obeidient wief
,
and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr
. potter
. everyone else is magnificent
, including bert
and ernie
( ward bond
and frank faylen
)
. there is a genaral sense of goodness
, as if everyone in the film knows tath they are making a great film
,
and they relish that
. stewart
,
however
, is the king of all of this
. he is somtimes awkward
, especially when saying
" merry christmas
" to all objects
, animate or inanimate
.
but he is james stewart
,
and he ' s lovably delightful througout tje film
. have i complained
? i shouldn ' t have
. this is a really good movie
. no
, this is a great movie
. better
yet
, this is a phenomenal movie
. there is a reason classics are invented
: to make sure that people iwll always have gerat movies to aid them in their quest for living life
. this is one of those films
. it isnt a
" feel
- ogod
" movie
, something peple complain a little too much about
.
but capra ' s reworking of
" a christmas carol
" is the greatest christmas movie of all time
. there
, i ' ve said it
. i have to admit
, the frist time i saw htis
, i saw it with my family
, including my 11 year old kid sister
. they all loved it
. they loved george
, his wife
, his troubles
,
and the beautiful ending
. is it a little too sugar
- coated
? maybe
. no matter
. this is a film that shoud be watched time
and time again
, withthe families around a coffee table
,
and eggnog on the plate
. it is a film that just mkaes you feel ogod about life
, family
,
and hope
. it isnt the perfect christmas film
, flaws
and all
. it is frank capra ' s greatest acheivement
,
and that really does say a lot
. for baout 121 outloud of 129 minutes
, htis movie is flawless
. the rest can be excused
: no film isnt perfectly flawless
. i can ' t get over how much i love this movie
,
anbd how much you will
, after watching it
, digesting it
,
and sitting with your family
, appreciating how special life really is
.
