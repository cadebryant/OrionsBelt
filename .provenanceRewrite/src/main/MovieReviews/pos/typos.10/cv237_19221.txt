the happy bastard ' s 30
- second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father
? of course
! that ' s the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy
, a movei that ' s passable
but isn ' t really considered some of sandler ' s best work
. he doesn ' t actually play happy gilmore in the movie
,
but a variation of him
. he ' s sonny coufax
, a man who ' s living off a settelement he got for a cab running over his foot
annd his one
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) is fed up wtih his lifestyle
and demands a change before she leaves him
. enter a 5
- year old kid
, who ' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
and intended for his preppy roommate
( jon stewart
)
, who ' s off in china on a business trip
. from there
, coufax basicly acts as thge kid ' s father
, teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a buiding
and tripping up skateboarders with sticks
. he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to git the attention of a beautiful law office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
bu
, somehow
, he also garners yhe attention of social services
, who aren ' t particuarly pleased with coufax ' s actions
, as he pretends tothe be his roommate to keep the kid
. the reason i say it ' s not really sandler ' s best wokr is because it gets really sappy towords the end of a movie
, showing some odd feelings that somehow didn ' t really belong in a sandler vehicle
. i mean
, it fits the movie ' s tone
and everything
,
and sandler handles it well
,
but it ' s just oddly placed
, that ' s all
. fortunatly
, it doesn ' t destroy the goofy glee path it ' s been following
and it still makes you efel good
. sandler does a good job here
, as he does in most of his movies
. rob schneider
,
howver
, isnt irritating as his friend
, an immigrant delivery boy who can ' t read
. stewart
, in his minor time on screen
, is great
,
and adams remains a joy to watch
. look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he ' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( director of happy gilmore
)
, the movie remains a good couple ofthe hours tothe pass thge time with
. again
, there are faults
,
bu
, hey
, everyone needs to get emotional sometimes
.
