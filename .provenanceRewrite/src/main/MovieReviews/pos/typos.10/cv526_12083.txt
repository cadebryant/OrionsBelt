, palying a londoner
? believe it
. sliding doors is a lvoe ' what if ' story
. thte gimmick is that it ' s really two stories
: the film follows thge life ofthe helen
( gwyneth paltrow
) down two directions
. in tjhe beginning
, likeable gal ' helen '
( gwyneth paltrow
) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job
. so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home eearly to her aparment
anbd her sleeping live
- in lover gerry
( john lynch
)
. helen doesn ' t know it
,
but she is at a fateful junction in life
: 1
) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2
) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future
. the film shows what happens in both paths
, switching back
adn forth between intertwined
, parallel stories
. in story one
, helen meets a charming
and talkative monty python fan named james
( john hannah
) on the train
. arriving home eary
, she discovers that her live
- in
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, isnt having sex with his former lover lydia
( jeanne tripplehorn
)
. this leads to a life where helen moves out
. helen ' s winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart
,
annd encourages her to start her own business
. in story two
, helen experiences a different fate
. she misses tghe train
, never meets james
,
and doesn ' t get home early enough tothe discover gerry ' s infidelity
. in this new life
, helen takes up odd menial jobs
,
and faces the constant sneaking suspision that all is not right wiht her relationship with gerry
. will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems
and setbacks in both scenarios
? opinion
: rejoice all ye monty python fans
, gwyneth paltrow fans
,
and watchers ofthe quirky romance flicks
. at last here ' s proof that there ' s still creativity in 1990s filmmaking
. sliding doors is refreshingly differant from anything this eyar
. not only is it a well
- acted
, heartwarming film
,
but it ' s also easily gwyneth paltrow ' s best recent performance
. when helen
( paltrow
) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a ' shagging wanker
, '
( a british phrase better left untranslated
) she sounds like she knows what she ' s talking about
! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes
. nobody scrambles around in danger
, screaming
,
" i iwll find you no matter what
, my darling
!
" whn helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james
, she doesn ' t take the easy way out
and leap into his arms
, since she ' s supposed tothe be recovering from heartache
.
and hansome live
- in boyfriend gerry isn ' t the stereotypical screen hunk
( either a stud or a snob
)
. instead he ' s a nervous
anbd indecisive
, almost helpless hunk
. another example
: when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital
, sliding doors gives us neither thte ' hospital miracle ' nor a maudlin tradgedy
but surprises us with a third variation
. in other words
, all of the characters seem non
- stereotyped
, human
,
and local
. there are minor inconveniences
. since sliding doors switches back
and forth vetween two possible fates
, it ' s cocasionally difficult tothe distinguish between the two
. distinguishing between the two stories isn ' t a problem infront the scenes containing paltrow
, who sports twpo different hairstyles
.
but in scenes containing only lydia
and gerry
, who look the same in both stories
, it ' s slightly confusing
. also
, quite a few snappy comebacks referring tothe american pop culture
( seinfeld
, woody allen
, etc
.
) are spoken by tjhe british characters
.
but these seem slightly forced
, given that the remaining dialogue is predominately british slang
. possibly an attempt by the screenwrighter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more confortable
? sliding doors is a charming
, quirky
, originnal
, happy romance with a little ' philosophy of fate ' thrown in
. monty python
and the meaninng of fate
, anybody
?
