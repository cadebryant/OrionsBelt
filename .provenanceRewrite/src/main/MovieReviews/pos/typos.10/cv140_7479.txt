the cryptic teaser trailer has beeen unspooling infact moviehouses forthe qutie sometime now
:
" it mu5t be found
.
" so what
, exactlly
, is the fifth element
? after seeing luc besson ' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- in
- secrecy science fiction fantasy
, i could not help
but be let down by the actual answer
, which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think
.
bu what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole
, a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do
-
- create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen
. the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thnig that has been kept under such tight wraps
-
- the actual storyline
-
- is the most conventional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) of the film
. speaking in the vaguest possible terms
, the basics of the plot are as follows
: in the year 2259
, a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth
,
and only the four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, fire
,
anbd water
-
- untied with a fifth element can stop it
. figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, southern
- drawling entrapeneur by thte name of zorg
( tghe hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking uv where he left off in besson ' s the professional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
;
and a mysterious creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all ofthe the pieces come together in a tidy
and somewhat underwhelming
-
-
and unsurprising
-
- fashon
,
bu there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest
. what remains interesting
and exciting
,
however
, affter brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has creaeted with production designer dan weil
, director of photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
,
and the crew at digital domain
. the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last
. the frenzied cityscape ofthe new york
, with its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds
,
and the swarm ofthe cars
, cabs
,
and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways
, isnt absolutly breathtaking to behold
, especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film
.
but it would not have beeen a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren ' t equally as interesting
,
and are they ever
. in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world
, from bulky robots to dog
- like mangalores
, the humans are outfitted inaddition costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known for creating madonna ' s pointy bustier get
- up in her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier ' s outlandish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out ofthe white straps
, feel more at home in besson ' s futuristic vision than onthe any fashion runway in the world
; they add to tjhe sense of otherworldliness about the film
. while besson ' s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film
, it aslo could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience
. for all its imagination
, certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky
anbd bizarre
. i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous chracter of the film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative
-
- he makes a raucous enterance dressed in an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer
, speaking in high pitches at repid fire speed
. at first this character ' s hyper energy is funny
,
bu the act wears out its welcome very quickly
. not irritating
,
but just as strange
, is a musical number by blue
- skinned alien chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
-
and dances
-
- an aria that is an unlikely blend of clasical opera
and techno
. the tune
, as wtih tghe entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra ' s innovative score
, is haunting
,
but it is also completely jarring
.
then there are the campy touches of humor besson
and co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout
, which too often are silly
and forced
; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod
and a flight attendant is highly distracting
and not very funny
, to boot
. the story ' s weakness shines thru in the climax
and conclusion of yhe fifth element
. while still visually
and aurally spectacular
, the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be
. the big
, serious dramatic climax was met iwth more than a few snickers
,
and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward
. as such
, at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here
, that there was still more left to be said about this story
and these characters
. this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself
, who told me in the lobby follwoing the screening
( imagine that
, the filmmaker watching tghe film with the
" enemy
"
-
- tghe critics
) that what hadnt made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lenghty original fifth element screenplay
and that the second half
-
- now titled mr
. shadow
-
- is still waiting to be made
. still
, despite thge story problems
, tjhe fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson
; rarely does a filmmaker ' s original vision come to hte screen in all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it is a fascinating example ofthe how of oen artist ' s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams
.
