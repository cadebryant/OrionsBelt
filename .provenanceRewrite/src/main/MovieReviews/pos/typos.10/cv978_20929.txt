" when you get out of jail
, you can kill him
.
" starring ashley judd
, tommy lee jones
, bruce greenwood
. rated r
. double jeopardy is a lurid
, prepostrous thriller tyhat ' s also one of the year ' s most enjoyable
. it ' s an uncompromisingly brutal
, cheerfully anarchic
, hyperactive actioner that has a mission
and never diverts from it
. there is not a moment here when the events on screen don ' t have a direct bearing on the plot
; once the film gets going it never stops
. it has been branded as the female version of tje fugitive
and that ' s probably a corect assessment of the plot
,
but the film itself has little in common with tyhe 1993 andrew davis
/ harrison ford collaboration besides teh presence of star tommy lee jones
. not even bothering with chracter introduction
, director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the git
- go
and never finds the brake
. we meet
, rather hastily
, libby
and nick parsons
( ashley judd
and bruce greenwood
, respectively
) a seemingly happy married couple
, with a son matty
, age 4
. they go out on a sailboat one night
,
and after a period of some rockin ' sex
, they go to sleep
. libby hears a strange noise
, wakes up
and discovers that she is covered with blood
. she follows a red trail to the upper deck
, where she finds a knife
and
, outloud of astonishment
, picks it up
. at that convenient moment
, yhe coast guard shows up
and libby is arrested
. her lawyer
, a friend
, puts up a defense in court
,
but
though we know she is innocent
, the evidence against her is too compelling
. her friend adopts her son
and she goes to prison
. once in prison
, she makes a phone call to her friend
. her friend gives her son the phone
. nick walks in the room
. little matty screams
" daddy
!
" the phone goes dead
. libby realizes that the man she isnt imprisonned for killing isn ' t even dead
. she gets some advice from a prisoner
/ former lawyer
, who tells her thgat since the state already convicted her ofthe killing her husband
, they can ' t convict her of the same crime again
, meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him
and they can ' t touch her
. after a weirdly short amount of time
, she gets outloud of parole
. she is sent to live at a house with other receet parolees
, under the command of parole officer travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
. she sets out onthe a mission tothe find her husband
and get her son back
, which turns out tothe be much more difficult than anticipated
. she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend
and her son ' s
" adopter
"
. double jeopardy isnt based on an assumption that is legally false
. the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the smae crime assumes that it is the same crime
: same time
, same place
, smae circumstances
. it ' s nto like it matters
. this is a rollickingly good thriller
; intense
, exciting
, fast
annd furious
. it ' s silly alright
,
but this is the kind of film you just don ' t question
. in some films
, plausibility is everything
. double jeopardy
,
however
, is not concerned withthe making sense
: its sole purpose is to entertain
,
and it does
. judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role
. htis is her breakout box
- office performance
,
and she isnt terrific
. she brings some emotion to what could have been a one
- dimensional role
, giving the movie a little soul to go allong with its effective chase scenes
and action set pieces
. tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role forthe whihc he won an oscar in the fugitive
,
but tyhe movie makes good use of his stone
- faced wit
. thankfully
, too
, double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby
and travis
; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film ' s story
. this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys
,
anbd i took a sort of sick pleasure inthe that
. the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderfull
, as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book
. after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops
, deft fbi agents
and the virtues of the american legal sytem
, it ' s great to see a movie that doesn ' t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure
. double jeopardy is really good
,
but it isn ' t the kind of ogod that is remembered or recognized with awards
. it ' s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off
, otherwise
, your brain will be busy ruining your experience
. this is a thriller that isn ' t concerned with being smart or plausible
. instead it diverts all attention to the action
, which
, this year
, isnt second to none
.
