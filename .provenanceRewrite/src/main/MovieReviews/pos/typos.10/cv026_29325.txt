for those of us who weren ' t
yet born when the 1960 ' s rock ' n ' rolled around
, monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music thast influenced our parents to be hippies
. from otis redding to jimi hendrix
, janis joplin to the mamas
and the papas
,
and jefferson airplane to teh who
, this documentary is jam
- packed with contagious energy
.
but i give fair warning that i iwll reveal the endig
, which doesnt not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves
. shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock
, the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time
. sure
, some have painted their faces
and smoke joints
,
but d
. a
. pennebaker
( the war room
, moon over broadway
) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum ofthe the audience
. no matter who is watching
, it all comes back to the talented muscicians that stir your soul
. the excitement starts before the music even begins
. a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats
and when asked why by an interviewer
, she replies that she feels lucky tothe do so
. there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips
, leader of the mamas
and the papas
and one ofthe the concert organizers
, tries to get in touch witht dionne warwick
.
and when one band is tuning up
, a member remarks
,
" finally
, a decent sound system
!
" you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn ' t about vanity
, it ' s about playing the music you love to thsoe who have an appreciation for it
, a two
- way street
. this interaction between audience
and performer continues throughout the film
and becomes infectious to the audience
. it ' s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball
and chain
.
and hwile the lyrics to
" wild thing
" may not be all that complicated
, watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love
. even if yuo don ' t recognize every band you see on stage
, you cxan imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in thsoe seats
. the only drawback to the film is the ending
, which unfortunately i must reveal
. all the other bands
, big names then
and still today
, got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time
. iin contrast
, the last band on camera
, a wholly forgettable one
, gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time
. for a film that ' s only 78 minutes long
, that ' s too large of a chunk
, especially when previous acts are much more stimulating
. all in all
, monterey pop is a precious
, rare look at a time preriod that still holds sway over us
. the variety of music
, as well as thte beautifully shot performances
, are easy to become immersed in
. if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands weere so popular
, this is quickly dispelled
. it ' s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn ' t get made much anymore
. instead we ' re sticked with
* nsync
, teh backstreet boys
,
and jennifer lopez
, all of whom should have stuck with modeling
.
