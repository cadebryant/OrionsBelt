warren beatty ' s
" bulworth
" is a caustic political comedy that doesn ' t attack any particular political group
,
but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system
. some might tihkn this film is vulgar
,
and in many ways it is
.
howver
, as loud
and raucous as it is
,
" bulworth
" speaks the truth
, which is alomst always ugly to hear
. beatty
, who directed the film
and co
- wrote hte script with jeremy pikser
(
" the lemon sisters
"
)
, stars as incumbent u
. s
. senator jay billington bulworth
, who hasnt one of the best politician names in cinema history
. bulworth is a democrat
,
and in beatty ' s view
, he is symbolic of everything tyhat has gone wrong with the current democratic party
. once an ideological liberal
( liuke beatty still is
)
, bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington
. instead ofthe waging the battles for teh impoverished
and the downtrodden
, which was once the calling card of democrats
, bulworth has become another sell
- out money hound
- if he ' s not accepting illegal bribes from the insurence lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese
, he ' s makeing wind
- bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement
,
" america is standing on the doorstep of a newyorker millennium
.
.
.
. blah
, blah
, blah
.
" when the film opens
, it is a few dyas before the 1996 primary elections
,
and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become
. iin a ift of desperation
, he tkaes out a
$ 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino
( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee
)
,
and
then hires a hit man to kill him
,
although he doesn ' t know who the assassin will be
, or when the hitted will take place
. knowing that he will soon be dead
, bulworth unleashes his own brand ofthe political retoric on yhe world
, which is made uv of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics
annd the society in genaral
. at a compton church
, he tells the group of african
- americans that they will have noone power in the u
. s
. unless they
" put down that malt liquor
and chicken wings
,
and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife
.
" later
, in a particularly hilarious sequence
, bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite
,
then insults the quality ofthe their movies
and informs them tht the only reason he ' s there is because
" my guys always put the big jews on my scehdule
.
" all throughtout this physically
and politically suicidal escapade
, bulworth ' s chief of staff
, dennis murphy
( oliver platt
)
, follows behind in a state of constant shock
and bewilderment
. platt has some of the movie ' s funniest scenes
, as he makes murphy into a politically savvy
but nontheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet
. his constatn half
- truth
- telling
and spin
- doctoring to cover bulworth ' s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self
- righteous reporter
( nora dunn
) who acts like murphy ' s refusal to explain bulworth ' s actions
( something he really cannnot dont
) is somehow an act of treason
. when bulworth decides he wnats to live after all
,
and therefore must constantly evade a grim
- looking assassin to be who ' s trailing him at every turn
, he hides out in the ghetto
, complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews
. at this point
, beatty abandons much of the political aspect
and dives inot a cartoonish exploration of thte black inner
- city experience
. bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina
( halle berry
)
, who he meets at the harlem church rally
. she has a tough
- talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l
. d
.
( don cheadle of
" boogie nights
"
)
, who also becomes involved in bulworth ' s campaign
. some of the scenes iin the ghetto ring true
,
but much of it feels like a lighter version ofthe scenes depicted in omre intense inner
- city films like
" boyz ' n ' hood
"
( 1991
)
and
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
.
" bulworth ' s
" cheif liability is beatty ' s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device
. instead of speaking at political rallies
, he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style tyhat is a reminder of why almost all hip
- hop stars are black
. it ' s hard tothe tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad
, or whether he ' s actually thyat incomptetent
. at any rate
, the rap sounds more run d
. m
. c
. than snoop doggy dogg
, which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary
. beatty would have beeen better off simply adopting some of the intertube
- city lingo
and working that into his speeches
, instade of trying to sound like l
. l
. cool j
. other than that
,
" bulworth
" hits all its targets with wry
, hilarious accuracy
. the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party
,
and even if you don ' t agree with beatty ' s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government
, it is hard tothe deny thte impact the film hasnt in exploring the monetary
and moral debauchery that infests modern politics
. unlike
" primary colors
" which opened earlier this year
,
" bulworth
" doesn ' t try to tip
- toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home
- instead
, it takes them dead
- on
.
