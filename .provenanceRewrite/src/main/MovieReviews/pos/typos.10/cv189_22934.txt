part one of
" the strangest movies ever made
" series at www
. mediajunkies
. com by scott watson
[ light spoilers
, nothing you shouldn ' t read
] existenz has been called
" a gooey matrix
"
,
and while this is a correct description in some ways
, in others it is completely off
. the only thing the two films have in common is tje idea ofthe a virtual reality taht isnt indistinguishable from normal
,
" real
" reality
. a major diference is that
" the matrix
" has a base reality taht is obviously tyhe true reality
, while existenz does the impossible
and mkaes us accept the most bizzare reality ever as true
.
and oh what a reality it is
. david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies
( naked lunch
, kresh
)
,
but this one isnt one of the strangest
. maybe it ' s because of how the mundane is mixed with yhe bizarre
. technology is organic
,
but only some of it
. cars are normal
. gas stations are the same
. cell phones are glowing bug liek appendages
. you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus
( referred to simply as a
" pod
"
)
. high technology has been replaced with organic creatures
,
and it provides a truly surveill setting for the characters
. a famous game designer
, allegra geller
( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh
)
, flees a demonstration of her latest game
, existenz
, after an assassination attempt
. she is on the run
( from who
, i ' m still not sure
)
,
annd has to save her pod by playing her game with
" someone friendly
"
. that somene friendly is her dubious companion
and security guard
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
. unfortunatly he is lacking a fundametal requirement for playing
, a bioport
. sort of a hole in your spine
( ok
, exactly like a hole in your spine
)
, a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail
- looking wires from the pod into you
, allowing you to play the game
. luckily a bioport can be installed easily
( they install them in malls
)
, so off they go to get one
. aftter a crazy sories of events at tghe local country gas station
, they are able to plug in
and play existenz
. the plot itself is a surreal melding ofthe conspiracies
, reality distortion
, chinese restaurants
,
and multi appendaged amphibian things
(
" it ' s a sign of the times
"
)
.
but the plot
, while cohesive inwhich it ' s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going onthe in this universe
. cronenberg jstu slaps this weird organic
- tech world into the viewers lap
,
and it ' s up to you tothe figure outloud how all these things work
.
and that ' s the true joy of this film
, entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place
. you leran a little bit piece by peice
( oh
, they make pods out of those
)
,
and it ' s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you
. there are all kinds of twists
and turns as the characters wander around
, including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards
. also the bioports are occasionally used for things otehr than porting into existenz
, the specifics of whihc i will leave for you to discover
. there ' s lots of little things that set off the weird
- o
- meter
, like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store
, the two headed amphibian creature
,
and why tht guy at the gas station ' s name appears to be
" gas
"
. it all adds up to a supremely far out trip
,
and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix ' s virtual world
.
.
. oh wait
, i already do
.
