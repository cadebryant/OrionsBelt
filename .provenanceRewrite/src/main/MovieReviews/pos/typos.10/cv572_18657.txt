with many big
- budget science fiction films
, great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts
, cheesy plot twists
,
adn
, terrible acting
. the fifth element
, the abyss
,
anbd godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting
, writing
, or both
. at first glance
, the matrix
, larry
& andy wachowski ' s sci
- fi
/ kung
- fu
/ shoot
- em
- up spectacular
, looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high
- concept bad movies
, especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role
.
but despite high levels of cheese
and gaudy dialogue
, the matrix works
. it ' s an uncanny blend of action
and surreal fantasy thyat borrows from dozens of other films
( most obviously the terminator films
, star wars
,
and total recall
)
,
but remains refreshingly original
anbd interesting throughout
. reeves plays neo
, a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who has supernatural powers
and stunning good looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)
,
and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who ect like irs agents from hell
. neo quickly lerans that the world he hasnt known all his life is not whta it seems
. moreover
, he dicovers that the grim
, bleak world he is intruduced to has been waiting forthe him to save it
. neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah
, with grave doubts taht he is actually
" the one
" prophesized to come
and save the world
. reluctant or not
, what follows is a mix of hong kong
- style slow
- motion shootouts
, surreal dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
and comic book kung
- fu fights
. the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality
. how exactly dont you know what is real
and what is in your mind
?
and if the real world were much harsher
and grim than a fantasy one yuo were living in
, would you want tothe face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion
? unfortunately
, yhe matrix doesn ' t provide many answers to the questions it raises
,
but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions
, shoot
- outs
,
and flying roundhouse kicks
. perhaps stealing yhe entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses
and suits who seem capable of being anywhere
and doing anything to stop neo
and friends from destabilizing the matrix
. weaving ' s stony appearance
, deadpan voice
,
and chilling comments put a grim human face on hte haunting
, evil technological force that controls the matrix
. like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t
- 1000 terminator in terminator 2
: judgement day
, weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because
, despite his power
and seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence
. the film features some truly breathtaking special effects
and stylish cinematography
. it seems to be deliberately kitchy
, iwth stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months ofthe martial arts training by the actors
. in a few scenes
, the posing
and posturing is unintentionally funny
. just seeing keanu reeves engaging infact serious kung fu is a bited jarring
.
however
, with the comic
- book style
and tone of the film
, you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience
. the matrix isn ' t a classic
. its open
- ended
adn confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers
. it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists
and philosophical questions
. it also relies onthe some conventional sentimentality to save the hero
- the kind ofthe shmaltzy feel
- good goo that most of the film avoids
. reportedly
, the producers have high hopes for the film being yhe first in a trilogy
and have already begun work on the story for the sequel
. unfortunatly
, audiences deserve a little omre than a vague sence that the story will continue in the future
. the matrix is an fun
, enjoyable diversion
, like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival
. just don ' t be suprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry
.
