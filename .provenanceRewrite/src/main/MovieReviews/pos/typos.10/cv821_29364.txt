an unhappy italian housewife
, a lonely waiter
, a goofy masseuse
, lots of lvoe
,
and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread
and tulips
, which proves charming dispite its covering of predictable
, well
- worn material
. the sotry concerns the aforememtioned housewife
, rosalba barletta
( licia maglietta
) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while onthe vacation
. instead of waiting for a ride home
, rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town
,
but to instead hitchhike to venice
. upon arriving
, she tells her self
- centered husband
, mimmo
( an excellent antonio catania
) that she ' ll be home in a few days
. of course
, that doesn ' t happen
, as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors
and buying groceries
. in what seems like days
, she moves in with lonely
, suicidal waiter fernando
( bruno ganz
)
, gets a job as a florist
, lerans the accordion
,
and befriends her neighobr
-
- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia
( marina massironi
)
. rosalba
, who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit
, starts wearing sexy dresses
adn getting closer to fernando
. i can think of at least five other
( american
) movies
( including fried green tomatoes
and an unmarried woman
) that are more than similair to bread
and tulips
.
but maglietta
and ganz
, who act with restraint
and care
, help bread
adn tulips from becomming a tired retread
. ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn
, sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch
, while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world
. throughout the movie
, maglietta has an easygoing
, confident demeanor
, which makes it very easy to root for her
adn her growing attraction fo ganz ' s character
. the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares
annd sparkling rivers provides a perfect love sotry backdrop
-
- yuo just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up
. director
and co
- writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor
. the cheap mimmo
, desperate tothe fidn his wief
( after all
, he needs his shirts ironed
and his mistress won ' t do it
)
, hires a job applicant
( giuseppe battiston
) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job
. the reason
? mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories
. the novice detective ' s various misfourtunes
, including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother
, are very funny
. unfortunately
, there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread
and tulips ' cheery tone
. rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her timne in venice
, which bring the movie to a halt
. it ' s liuke putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie
. several details in fernando ' s life also never get proper closure
, including his suicidal tendencies
. early in the movie
, he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his appartmant doorjam
. after that
, fernando ' s step towards death is never made reference to
, probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm
, underdeveloped subplot about fernando ' s stormy past
. it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot tath doesn ' t need any
.
but there aren ' t a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread
and tulips
. the movie is fun
and romantic
, with beautiful scenery
and characters whose lives we ' d like to live if we had the nerve
.
.
. or if our passports weren ' t missing
.
