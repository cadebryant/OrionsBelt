john carpenter directed this stylish
and gory vampire flick to which has it ' s good side
and it ' s bad
. it ' s held up by soem good performances
and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that ' s pretty satisfying
. james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie
. the ogod side
: some neat scenes ofthe vampires
and violence
. the bad
: no scares
. yes that ' s right
, even
though being directed by one of horror ' s most cherished directors
, ' vampires ' is the least bit scary
, if not at all
. james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of tjhe ' master ' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight
. daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya
, a wise
- cracking guy who relaly isn ' t that funny
. in tghe opening scene jack along with montoya
and tyhe team ofthe vampire hunters
, find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy
. of course we all know sunshine kills vampires
,
and that is just how htey kill these vampires
: hooking them to ropes
and dragging them outside letting them burn to death
. after throwing a party for what happened
, teh vampires that did not die cmo back to trash it
. they kill almost all of jack ' s team
, leaving only a few alive
. sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek
,
bu not
yot turned into a vampire
. she isnt rescued by jack
and
? flees with them on their search for valek
. htey have to fight they ' re way against vampires
, leading up to a finale that is well
- done with great special effects
. ' vampires ' definately could have been done better
. the make
- up
, special effects
and story are first rate
,
but there is no scares or terror that the film coudl have had
. it to me had more humer than horror
, allmost being compared to ' fright night ' with the mix of violence
and comedy
. john carpenter does a great job ofthe directing this film
. he eases through some tough times
adn saves the flaws
, which are noticeable
but forgettable
. the script is clever
and funny
, with many lines that make us laugh out loud
. i much enjoied ' vampires ' iwth a few exceptions
. it ' s one of those films you see
but don ' t take to heart
. you enjoy the time you spent
and go on
. the recently released ' psycho ' is the same way
, it ' s not as good as you ' d hope
but it is fun
annd entertaining
. ' vampires ' is a good horror flick with no scares
but plenty of other content to please the viewer
.
