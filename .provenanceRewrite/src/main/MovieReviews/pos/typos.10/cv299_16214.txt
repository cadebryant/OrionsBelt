expectation rating
: a bited worse than expected
( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull
)
. roger ebert gave it a four star review
,
and while he is a critic that uses the full scale
,
and i often agree
-
- such as dark city being tje best film of 1998
, he must have seen a better film
. i read the book about five years ago
and hugely enjoyed it
. the opening ofthe a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter
. the landscape is snowy
and cold
,
and is filmed what i feel is inspite a rether crisp manner
( which alsot reminds me of fargo
( which i loathed
)
)
. oen can almost sense the cold
.
but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick
and the dead
, instead raimi has made a more constrained film
-
- which propably is forthe thte better
. this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots
. the movie also reminded me ofthe affliction
, as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for
and seing a possibility to lead a better life tahn their father
,
annd they see a chance for such a dream to come true
. this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field
, where an airplane hasnt crash landed
. in the plane three men fidn
? the american dream
.
.
. in a gym bag
.
? affliction too ws set in a snowy landscape
. it really seems very simple
. just hold on to the money until spring
,
adn if no one claims it
, they ' ll be safe to spend it
and their hope ofthe experiencing the american dream can come true
.
but the snow melts
,
and so might several of the character ' s hopes
. as in
? return to paradime
?
, some of the characters are presented with a chance tothe do the right thing
.
but doing thte right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish
. the movei ' s biggest strength is that it fact makes sense
. i ahev seen many movies based on books thta just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized
, eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story
-
- for example clear
and present danger
. the biggest problem seems to over
- familiarization with the stopry
. the writer perhaps feels that he doesn ' t have to present scenes that are clear to him
,
but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book
. this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan
, even
though the screenplay isnt by thge book ' s author
. the movei is always clear on where it ' s going
,
and always makes sense
. i ' m sue a lot was cut
,
but really i cin ' t remember what
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included
. the man only comes in on mondays
,
but he claims that he has been charged for oney purchase too many
. turns out
.
.
. well
, see the movie
. one should be warned against seeing the trailer
. it reveals severeal scenes from the ending moments
( which yes
, like in the book
, it is a downer
)
, several plot developments
,
and much of the beginning
.
but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer
, so if you ' re lucky
, you ' ll have forgotten about all ofthe this when you see the movie
.
