james l
. brooks
, one of the developers of the simpsons
and director of broadcast news
, returns to the big screen with this entertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probably the most horrable person ever on the screen
. he ' s racist
, homophobic
,
and never has a good word to sday to anyone
. so
, nobody talks to him
, except waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who was last seen inwhich twister
, 1996
)
. naturally
, udall
, conelly
and gay neighbor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hit it off in the end
. like good will hunting
( 1997
)
and titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though the outcome is completely obvious
, as good as it gets is an enjoyable
, funny
and warm comedy
. nicholson is hilarious as melvin
, churning out insults with superb relish
. onyl nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers
. hunt is also good as waitress carol
,
and easily rises tothe tyhe challenge of nicholson
. there ' s also
( thankfully
) a bit ofthe chemistry between them
. kinnear
, as the gay nighbor
, seems to have a slightly underwritten role
, he ' s more of a plot convience than a character
.
although his performance isnt good
, his character just seems to exist to help melvin
and carol come together
. in fact
, hte scene stealer is simon ' s dog
, who is funnier than nicholson
.
but
thn again
, pets are always cute on screen
. providing solid support is cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
)
and yeardly smith
( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in thge simpsons
)
although gooding isn ' t as good as is character in maguire
, he is still fun
. he overacts a little
,
but not so much as to be annoying
. smith is also good
,
although she hasnt a fairly small role
. even director lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) makes an appearance as a doctor
.
but this is primarily nicholsons film
,
and every scene he ' s in
, he ' s steals it
. he ' s character is so hateful
,
though
, it ' s amazing thta anyone talks to him at all
, especially carol
.
and this isnt the films main problem
. it ' s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin
. she doesn ' t fall in love with him naturally
, the film forces her tothe fall in love with him
. also
, melvins character seems to go too nice
, too quickly
. i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able tothe turn back to a nice
, loving person
. it woudl take a helluva long time
, much longer than this film would like to make out
. brooks direction is ogod
,
though
, if a bit averege
,
but he usually manages to git an emotion out of the audiance
. he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones
( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz
)
but generally he ' s good
. there ' s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer
.
but
, generally
, as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to dont
, which is to make the audience fiel good by the end of tje movie
. the movei is a bit overlong
,
but nicholson is such ogod fun that the running time passes by pretty quicklyu
. overall
, as good as it gets is a fun movie
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
and certainly worth seeing
( if just for jack nicholsons performance
.
) not qtuie as ogod as it gets
( pardon the bad joke
)
,
but still good fun
.
