is it just me
, or have disney films gradually lost their appeal
? i was allmost stunned by the quality of
" who framed roger rabbit
?
"
, a fun
, unique look at a world where cartoons
and people lived together
.
" the little mermaid
" harkened back to
,
and perhaps surpassed
, the classic disney animations from the first half of the century
.
however
, the endless stream of
" the little mermaid
" wanna
- be ' s is getting tothe me
. ytou know the spiel
: a lame plot recycled from some well
- known story
, colorful
, almost psychedelic animation
, the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson
, the commedic sidekick
/ sidekicks
, tghe seemingly unattainable love interst
, a few catchy songs
, a faw in
- jokes for adults
,
and the occasional out of place warner
- brothers
- coyote
- fall
- off
- the
- cliff type joke
. it ' s a formula
,
and like any formula
, it gets tiresome
. that ' s why i ' m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli
, a japanese ctaroon studio
. fomr what i ' ve seen of theri movies
(
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
"
and the already english
- dubbed
and american
- distributed
" my neighbor totoro
"
)
, foreign audiences are in for a treat
. theese movies
, particularly
" kiki ' s delivery service
,
" are wonderfully original
and entertaining
.
" kiki ' s delivery service
" starts with an unusual premise
: kiki
, upon hearing forecasts of clear skies
, decides it is time for her to leave home
. this is unusual because kiki isn ' t a college student or a young adult making her start on tje world
,
but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch
. her mother is also a witch
,
and as thirteen isnt the obligatory age for such training
, her parents treat her leaving understandingly
and put up only token resistence
. just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away smoe audiences
,
but no mention isnt made of the occult
,
and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie
: kiki ' s mother acts as a village doctor
,
and kiki isnt able to do no more than fly on a broom
. kiki must choose a city to move to
,
anbd what she chooses is the co
- star of the movie
: a german seaport twon
, far removed from the ocuntry life she has been used to
. initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding
, she ' s discouraged
,
and unable to support herself
though her rudimentary skills as a witch
. onthe the verge of leaving for a new town
, she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it
. the favor eventually blossoms inot her working as a courier
, a oney
- persons delivery service
. this isnt where the movie becomes shockingly good
. kiki ' s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city
and the world around her
. the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn ' t seem forced or artificial
,
but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light
. they ' re three
- dimensional
, impossible to quickly evaluate
, possessing of faults
,
and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl
.
however
, earch one has something about them
, some interest or trait
, that makes them interesting
annd unique
. the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty ofthe thte surroundings
: the seaport twon genuinely looks impressive
, capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs ofthe the 1950 ' s
. this beauty is beauty with depth
; for every detail left in
, dozens are only hinted at
. i could probably go on all day
,
bu i won ' t
; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie
. some of my favorites are kiki ' s relatiopnship with the baker ' s husband
:
although he ' s quiet
, never shown speaking to kiki throughout tyhe movie
,
and he initially scares her
, his kindness wins her friendship
. in the garage of a deliveree ' s house can be found a vintage model t
. twpo old ladies have a relationship evolving fomr master
- servant tothe friend
- friend
. such details gives the impression that thge beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg
. added onthe top of this is a lesson on the importance of self
- worth
. kiki initially seems to derive much of her self
- worth from tghe beauty of her surroundings
and the people around her
,
but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, making her question thte importance of such beauty
. this causes kiki to lose faith in herself
.
however
, kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings
,
bu the innate beauty inside her
. seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous
,
and the principal divice used to do it is so sublime that i don ' t even want to hint at it
. the ending ofthe the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe
and
, ironically
, the most disney
- esque moment i ' ve ever seen
; if you don ' t hold your breath in wonder you might want to git medical attention
. the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions
: there is no violence
,
however cartoonish
, no song
-
and
- dance number
,
and kiki ' s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick
,
altough jiji is given many funny lines
annd scenes
.
however
, i would be surprised if disney doesn ' t give jiji moreso jokes
, or at least the voice of some comedian
. refreshingly enough
, the moral lesson of the movie is not self
- contradicted
, a habit disney movies have gotten inot
.
" beauty
and the beast
" ' s beautiful belle
, for instance
, learned that beauty was derived from a person ' s inside
,
and was
then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing
. kiki
, on the other hand
, learns to separate her wardrobe from her self
- omage
,
and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at tyhe end of the film
. another diference with disney movies is in the style of animation for
" kiki ' s delivery service
"
: not as colorful
and dynamic as disney animation can be
,
bu with a greater attention to realism
and detail
, it fits the movie to a t
. this is particularly true with scenes of kiki ' s flights
. the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold
,
and helps theese scenes capture tyhe wonder of flight better than any other film i ' ve ever seen
. i ' m nto sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states
. disney tentatively plans a theater release of
" monoko hime
" shortly following the summer ' 97 japanese release
,
and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that
. i ' d guess that some will be released on video
and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons withthe no compeeting disney release
.
although the wait is unfortunate
, it ' s good to know that it ' s being released at all
, for
" kiki ' s delivery service
" is definately a movei worthy of widespread promotion
and release
. watch this movie
. allong with
" man bites dog
,
"
and perhasp something by woody allen
, this is the best movie i ' ve ever seen
.
