inthe
_ daylight
_
, sylvester stallone breaks no new ground
, cinematically speaking
,
but he covers familiar territory quite well
. yesterday
, as i was going about my busness in the university bookstore
, i noticed this stand with these
_ daylight
_ movie posters on it
. i had never heard of the movie
, so i stopped by to check it out
. it turned out that htey were giving away free passes to the movie for people who hadnt or applied for the credit card they were offering
. so
, i shrugged
, thought
,
" hey
, they probablly won ' t give me the card anyway
,
and i could always use a free movie
,
" so i signed up
. all in all
, i don ' t think i got that bad of a deal
, either
. rob cohen
, who has previously brought us such films as
_ dragon
: the bruce lee story
_
and
, more recently
,
_ dragonheart
_
( gee
, i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason
? you think
?
)
, nowe brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture
, with fx by industrial light
and magic
, about the aftter
- effects of an explosion tath collapses a busy tunnel beetwen new york
and newyorker jersey
. sylvester stallone plays kit latura
, who isnt essentially a carbon copy of the charactor he played in
_ cliffhanger
_
: a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed
. when the crisis hits
, he is in the right palce at the right time
and tkaes it upon himself to go in
and git everybody out
. there are other similarities to
_ cliffhanger
_
, too
; perhaps the only real diference is that
_ cliffhanger
_ had a villain
, where
_ daylight
_ ' s bad guy isnt mother nature
. in fact
, had the two movies beeen made in hong kong
, this might have been titled
_ cliffhanger ii
_
-
- it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film
" sequels
" do to theri predecessors
. the first half
- hour of
_ daylight
_ is setup
. subplots are woven
,
and the mechanism of the disaster isnt assembled
. we meet all the important people
.
.
. toxic waste disposal truck drivers
; a young
, frustrated
, jilted
, rejected playwright
; a family struggling to stay together
; an older couple
and their dog
; a truckload of prisoners
; an ad agency executive
; a tunnel police officer
; stallone
;
and others
. we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination
; we watch stallone
and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons
.
and
then
, thirty mintues into the film
,
_ boom
_
.
and it ' s a big one
.
> ffrom there on in
, it ' s sly stallone to the rescue
.
and rescue he does
, enduring batterings
, beatings
, falls
, repeated immersion in 34
- degree water
, explosions
, mud
, rats
,
and constant setbacks
, before going on to save tyhe day
, sly
- style
. again
.
.
. there ' s nothing new here
.
and
yet there doesn ' t need to be
. the fun of
_ daylight
_ is not in the story
but in the execution
. the special
- effects are first
- rate
, thanks to industrial light
and magic
,
and the ensemble cast works well together
. once the film hits its stride
, it carries the viewer right along tothe the finish
, with very few jars along the way
