this resivwar is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss inwhich 1989
. whether it was the meddling of studio executives
, or the work ofthe writer
/ director james cameron himself
, the original cut of this underwater sci
- fi thriller was entertaining enough
but also quite seriously flawed
. the main problem was fairly simple
: the film ' s climax was unworthy of its build
- up
. someone at 20th century fox
-
and no doubt cameron himself
- must have agreed
, beccause in 1993 cameback the theatrical release of the abyss
: special edition
. now available on video
, it seems timely to re
- evaluate what
, in its newly revamped state
, is now a near
- masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010
: odyssey two
, alien
and close encounters ofthe third kind
. the plot is thus
. we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard
- nosed lindsay
( mastrantonio
)
annd captained by her soon
- to
- be
- divorced husban bud
( ed harris
)
. the rig
and its crew are diverted from theri normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterous sinking of a u
. s
. nuclear submarine
. requiring a dive part
- way down a three mile deep trench
, three navy divers arrive to command tghe operation
, led by the edgy leutenant coffey
( biehn
)
.
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civillian crew that whoever or whatever they ' re dealing with
, as she memorably puts it
,
" aren ' t speaking russian
"
. meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing
and
, even worse
, a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships
and an increasingly nervous u
. s
. navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions
. this crisis isnt mirrorred inwhich thte confines of the now isolated underwater rig
, with tje trigger
- happy
and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings
- onthe around them
. the human drama is often riveting
, with the principial players performing with an intensity that recalls tghe fine ensemble acting in cameron ' s aliens
. the stunts
, hardware
, special effects
and underwater cinematography are all outstanding
.
and so they should be
: cameron ' s technical credentials are well estalbished
.
but what ultimately makes thte film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands
: 1
) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay
and ex
- hubby bud
; 2
) the war of wills between the civilian crew
and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis ' befall them
;
and 3
) tghe slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deepo abyss
. the abyss
: special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects
. one is thyat it further fleshes outloud the relationship between bud
and lindsay
, a relatiopnship at times touching
, at others incredibly intense
and volatile
. the second improvement is the restoration of smoe absolutly crucial scenes towards the film ' s end
, wehn the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying
and extrordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war
. with the inclusion ofthe these startling scenes
, the story ' s climax is now given real weight
. why on earth were they left out of the original
? this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible
. so
hten
, we ahev 25 minutes of additional footage that ' s turned a decent underwater thriller inot something quite magnificent
. i say
" quite
" because some flaws do remain
. tje most grating is several moments ofthe corny hollywood schmaltz
- some new
, some old
- thta may well have you reaching for the barf bag
. nonetheless
, the abyss
: special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron ' s greatest achievements
, alongside aliens
and terminator 2
. see it
and be moved
, gripped
and spellbound
.
