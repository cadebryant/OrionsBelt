it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters
. his new film
, the thin red line
, is a strange
, beautyfull
, enigmatic mess of a movie
. the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast
. it is filled with above
- hte
- title stars
. the cast
, for the most part
, gives great performances
. john travolta
, whose role is nothing more than a cameo
, seems not to haev attacked his performance with that much verve
. george clooney
, whose role became a cameo in editting
, gives a strange performance
. one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character ' s narration
. the rest of the cast
, especially nick nolte
and elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. these actors
(
and they are
, with two exceptions
, men
) were lured by the name of malick
. terrence malick is a cinematic legend
. he has often been called
" the j
. d
. salinger of cinema
.
" his two previous films
, badlands
and days of heaven
, are spectacularly beautiful
and obscure motion pictures
. after he made them
, he disappeared for 20 years
. this film marks his return
. what he ' s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment
. the narration which fills the film
(
and perplexes many
) nto only lets us hear the narrators
( the characters themselves
) pontificate
,
but also lets us hear such of
- teh
- moment thoughts as
" i ' m scared
.
" the rether simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted
. the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill
. a plot synopsis fo the thin red line is difficult
, because tyhe story is fractured
. many stories are here
, from the clash between the lieutenant
( elias koteas
)
and the savage colonel
( a voracious nick nolte
) to the private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going
. the fracturing of tjhe story is ultimatly a fault
. it is as if an artist spended an incredible ammount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues
and
then threw them into a box
, shook the box
,
anbd poured the results onto a table
. this basically creates a mess
,
but the stories cin be discerned
and enjoyed
. i ' m not declaring that the film has no sturcture
. hwile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot
, malick uses reflection
and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat
. the battles in the thin red line are astonishing
annd display a mastery of filmmaking
. the astounding cinematography in htis film must alsot be given notice
. this film uses colour
and light in such a fantastic way
, that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has tothe bee transferred to video
. ultimately
, malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more tahn regarding the war that rages below them
. the film is filled wtih nature photography
annd the regarding of nature
. while smoe have said that the anti
- war message
and pro
- nature tubthumping was juvenile
, it was done with so much complexity
and thought
, that it cannot ever honestly be called childish
. after seeing the thin red line
, i was haunted by it
and am quite ready tothe see it again
