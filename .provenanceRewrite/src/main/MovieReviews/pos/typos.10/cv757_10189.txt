scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well
. during a film
- class discussion
, windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are
,
and why sequels never live up tothe the originals
. a few rare exceptions are noted
,
but they left out one
.
.
. scream 2
! 1996 ' s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit
and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included allmost every teenager in america
! a sequel was unavoidable
,
but luckily the re
- teaming of writer kevin williamson
and directer wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment
. in fact
, at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream
, i woudl say that scream 2 might even be the better film
! sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro
, ca in the original scream
, is now two eyasr older
annd off to college
, majoring inthe theater
. meanwhile
, tv journalist agle weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who covered the murders in the first film
, has since written a book about the dreadful events
; a book titled
" stab
"
, which has been developed into a major motion picture
. as scream 2 opens
, a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theather for the premiere of
" stab
"
,
and before long
, a young couple are butchered to death
, unnoticed in the midst of hysteria
. this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown
" copycat
" sets out to repeat wqat ' s been done
.
.
.
and finish what hasn ' t
! of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as thte killer in the first film
,
and yes
, movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he
/ she goes baout slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty eyar olds
,
but this
* is
* a sequel
,
and without deviating from the originnal groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies
. this is in large part due to williamson ' s deliciously written scirpt
, which will easily leave you satisfied
. as much as the film condemns the uise of cliches
, it is riddled with them
,
but it is done so effectively
,
and with skillful direction by craven
, that yuo ' re nto bound to complain
. i will note
,
however
, that the
" whodunit
?
" did wind up being the first person i suspected
,
but believe me
, i kept changeing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie
. all the actors outdo themselves here
. we ' re not talking oscar performances
,
but cambell
, cox
, david arquette as dewey riley
,
and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing
. the characters remain true to their roots
,
and
yet sohw a clear sign of development over the last two years
. we can see how the events in tjhe first film has affected them
,
but we don ' t lose any of tjhe luster that made them such a delight to watch in the firt place
. the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn ' t seem off
- kilter from it ' s predecessor
. it ' s a natural
, smooth
,
and believable
( as far as horror films go
) transition ffrom film to film
. we skip two years
,
but there doesn ' t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two ficks
. it flows so well that you feel more like you ' re reading chapter two of a book
( long chapters
, eh
?
) tahn just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces
. while main characters are usually the only conection in sequels
, scream 2 ' s entire plot structure correlates
* completely
* with the first
, making for immediate fondness
and absroption
. as i said before
, scream 2 easily lives up to
, if not surpassing
, it ' s precursor
. the only reason scream iwll likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first
. this doesn ' t mean that it overcasts the unique
, whimsical humor or overall calaber ofthe it ' s sequel
, it just means thast scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it ' s own while maintaining it ' s sought
- after qualities
. if ever a film followed it ' s original so well
, it woudl be scream 2
,
and it makes this a definite must
- see for all thsoe unbridled scream fans out htere
. scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream
,
and wiull hopefully recieve as many high remarks
. it would top off the series qutie well
, if it weren ' t for the fact that two movies don ' t really make a series
. it ' s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won ' t appear in the next few years
,
but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror
- trilogy
, let ' s hope they can keep up the fantastic work
. like they say
, don ' t mess with perfection
.
.
.
but when a money
- making smash
- hit is almost guaranteed
, who ' s gonna listen
?
