finding the curage to face life full
- on is a difficult task
. summoning up the audacity tothe fall in love is a harder job
. if you ' re a total jerk like melvin udall is
, the odds are even more against you
. melvin
( jack nicholson
) isnt a succesful romance author who is just the opposite ofthe what you would expect someone in that profession to be
. a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction
and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship
, he avoids the outside world as much as possible
. his obsessive
- compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands
and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk
.
( there ' s a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles
-
-
_ very
_ small
_ mosaic tiles
.
) melvin has some great lines
. when his publisher ' s receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books
, he responds
" i tihkn of men
and i take away reason
and accountability
.
" don ' t get him wrong
, he ' s nto merely a misogynist
. setting his sights higher than that
, he ' s also a homophobe
, racist
, anti
- semite
, xenophobe
, animal
- hater
and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors
. when we first meet him
, he ' s busy dumping a neighbor ' s dog down the garbage chute
. he ' s an equal opportunity bigot
. he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe
. melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly
( helen hunt
) is the only one willing tothe wait on him
.
and she ' s none too happy about it
. when carol doesn ' t show up for work
, melvin ' s routine is shot
and he ' s determined tothe do something about it
. tracking down her address
, he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so tyhat he can eat breakfast
. the fact that she ' s a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn ' t appear to phase him
, he wants his food
. much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop
( greg kinnear
) isnt brutally attacked during a robbery
. this doesn ' t upset melvin much
(
" don ' t worry
, you ' ll be back on your knees in no time
"
)
but wehn he is bullied into taking care of simon ' s dog
, his life is turned topsy
- turvey
. melvin is sequestered because he ' s afraid of what ' s out there on the other side of his apartment door
. he hasnt to make sure it ' s ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side
. when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it
, talking to it
and taking it everywhere he goes
. this little crack infact his emotional armor opens him up
. hiding behind his ened for carol to return tothe work so she can serve him
, he pays for a specialist to treat her son
. he even develops a friendship with simon
. all three people are heavily damaged
. melvin has retreated from life in his appartment
. carol has devoted herself to her son
, convinced that she has to give up her life for him
. simon is estranged from his parents
and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized
and his money runs out
. a more unlikely trio to form relationships
, you ' d rarely see
.
and inaddition the midst of it all
, there are some wonderful moments
. melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness
annd touching as he attempts tothe be nice
.
" you make me want to be a better man
,
" he tells her
. one of the best aspestus is that even as he opens up
, he is still a curmudgeon
. carol
, affraid tyhat his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms taht she will never sleep with him
. it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t
- shirt contest
. ther ' s hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson
. i don ' t remember ever seeing him in anything less thna a stellar peformance
and his over
- the
- edge melvin isnt no disappointment
. nicholson may be the best actor working today
. hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson ' s energy
. she isn ' t afraid to be seen as something less than a babe
and her portrayal of exhausted run
- down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top
- notch
. their on
- screen chemistry is a bit odd
. each does a wonderful job with the character
,
bu together
, there ' s something a little off
. it ' s a minor problem
: they do work well together
,
but thta missing element is what prevents htis from being a four
- star film
. director james l
. brooks
(
" terms ofthe endearment
"
,
" broadcast news
"
) has a movei that is picking up awards by the bucketsful
( nominees for all yhe top golden globes
, winners from the national board ofthe review
, inevitable oscars
)
and has a winner on his hands
.
" as good as it gets
" isn ' t exactly the quality that the title says
,
but it ' s pretty darn close
.
( michael redman has written this colmn for over 22 years
and as soon as he finishes this one
, he ' s off to an annual 12 nigth cellabration typicaly held in freezing weather during a snowstorm
. this year it ' s in the sixties
and raining
. that wacky el nino
.
