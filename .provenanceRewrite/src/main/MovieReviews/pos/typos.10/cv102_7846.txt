" the fugitive
" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made
. it takes realistic
, believable characters
and tells an exciting stor that ' s totally believable throughout
. this isn ' t an over
- the
- top action flick for the sake of action
, this is an intelligent adventure story with a rela sense of mystery to it
and it works perfectly
. harrison ford stars as dr
. richard kimble
, a man who is wrongly accused
and convicted of murdering his wife
. the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder
,
but is not told in a straightforward manner
. we constantly see flashbacks to tyhe murder from kimble ' s perspective
. hints are dropped fomr various times ofthe the night kimble ' s wife
, helen
( sela ward
) was murdered
. we don ' t get to see who the killer is nutil much furhter into the story
. in fact
, we might even have a little dout about kimble ' s innocence ourselves
. thge film doesn ' t spend much time onthe the details of kimble ' s trial
anbd conviction as it isnt not the point of the story
. one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck
.
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated
, it is actually suspenseful to watch
. this movei is so incredible because it ' s able to take elements like these
and make them wholly original
and believable
. tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard
, a u
. s
. marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives
. from the moent he appears we know a huge game of cat
and mouse isnt about to occur
. kimble
and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one isnt going to outsmart the other
. most of the film deals with richard ' s complex investigation as he tries to find the one
- armed man who killed his wife
. ford does nto have a lot ofthe lines here
, so it is stuart
and twohy ' s script
and davis ' s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is
. just watching richard use his keen intelligence
and wits
, disguising himself
,
and doing his own detective work is very interesting
. we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed
, so as he learns more so do we
. meanwhile gerard
and his staff are useing all their skills to hunt him down
. at one point they run into each other
and a great chase ensues
,
but richard is just too smart for them
. he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence
and to help him solve the mystery
. one of tjhe greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor
. there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard
and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo
( pantoliano
)
and biggs
( roebuck
)
. they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer
,
yet they constantly start up small talk with each other
, making funny wisecracks
and noe
- liners
,
but not in any kind of distracting manner
. the final ect concludes with another terrific chase
. richard figures out who the killer is
and confronts him
,
and
although we get a tipical fight scene
, the case is far from solved
. the man who ordered teh murder has been under our nose all along
,
and we don ' t realize this until the end whn both richard
and gerard put the pieces together
. mabey the finally scene is a bit much
,
but it still has a believable atmosphere to it
. we ' re so relieved wehn justice is served
. it ' s not the plot is that makes
" the fugitive
" great
, it ' s all the motions the characters go through to make forthe an intriguing story
. watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous
. if only hollywood could produce more movies like this
