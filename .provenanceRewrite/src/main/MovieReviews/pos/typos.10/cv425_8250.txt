as a devout atheist
and an avowed believer in aliens
, i ahve some idea of how ellie aroway
( jodie foster
) feels
.
but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are differant than hers
, i can ' t say tht i do exactly
. her reason is that she needs solid proof
: there is no proof that god existed
, so therefor she does not believe
. ellie also believes in aliens
,
and has spent most of her life trying to proove they exist
. how can she say she doesn ' t blieve in god because of tje lack of proof
,
and
then say she believes in aliens
, which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite
? thta ' s the catch
- 22
. when aliens ffrom the star vega fax her some plans for a device tothe transport someone to them
( okay
, well
, they didn ' t raelly
* fax
* them
.
.
.
) ellie wants to be the one tothe go
,
bu because of her atheism she is denied the position
. how dumb is thgat
? she discovers the transmitions
,
then she isn ' t alloween to go
. well
, because of a bomb
and a psychopath
( jake busey
)
, she
* does
* end up going
,
but not in the way that we would ' ve thought
. contact is based on a novel by carl sagan
, who died during the filmmaking
. it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind
,
and will end up being the best film of the year
. its views of science
and religion will no doubt aggrivate some
,
bu iwll stimulate more
. i ' m glad at least one movei of the ' 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light
, rather thna a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides
and
then put on your body
.
