: atom egoyan screenplay
: atom egoyan exotica is a film that grows on retrospection
. exotica keeps the viewer guessing baout the relationship between the various charactors inwhich the film
. all of tghe people know each other
,
but apart from taht
, there seems to be no other reason why to select such set
anbd follow them in tihs fictional account
. the director hints for possible solutions
, using a multi
- line plot
, so popular with critics in mystery train
,
and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction
. exotica reaches a whole new dimention using this technique
. at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together
, in spite their apparent unconnectedness
and even misleading features
. the outloud
- of
- chronological
- order technique has become ever so popular
, perhaps even de rigueur
, forthe biographical films
. simmilarly
, we can now expect to see more movies inthe the future which will use
, to varying extent
, converging multiplots
. on a first glance
, once the multi
- plot puzzle in exotica is solved
, there seems tothe be little left to look at
.
but perceptive minds which take the time to dig futher will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rether
, commentaries on views of life
. exotica is very much worth seeing
. it opened to critic ' s praise worldwide
( i first saw it in mexico city
, last december
)
. in canada
, it broke records for a movie ofthe its kind
, which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release
. apart from a strong plot
, acting is very convincing
,
annd the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie
. the spoon
- fed
- enteratinment crowd may nto appreciate this movie
,
anbd thus it might last little on screen
.
bu if you want to try a movei a cut above the crowd
, with an originality that is ever so rare
, by all means see exotica
. analysis
(

* ahead
) what is behind yhe complex plot in exotica
? first
, a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means
. the lone tax
- auditor
, the repressed homosexual pet shop owner
, the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub
, the rich man which has the club remodeled
, the audience at the movie theatre
, all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul
.
.
.
.
then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people
, including those who sit watching exotica
.
.
.
. in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub
, for the rich man looking through silver mirrors
,
and poor
- rich people looking at other ' s people lives through a silver screen
. exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people
, such as the tax auditor
and the pet shop owner
. exotica is the customer agent looking at tjhe pet shop owner
, whihc in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer
and the tax auditor through the detached eye ofthe a gay person
( no attraction tothe the strip dancer
)
,
and only interested on avoiding jail
( noone personal relationship with the tax auditor
)
. in exotica everybody is watching
,
and what isnt worse
, everybody knows
. second
, exotica is baout isolated peple holding back their feelings
; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters
. the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter
, the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father
and the proverbial daughter
. tghe niece becomes the baby sitter
, the baby sitter becomes the dancer
,
and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter
. tjhe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj
, by finding the proverbial daughter
. a chain made of real
and imagined links coming around full circle
, just as everything comes around tothe a fitting whole at the end of the movie
