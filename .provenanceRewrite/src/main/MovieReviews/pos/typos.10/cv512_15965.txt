it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship
, a green ovular pin
,
adn the birth of oscar wilde
,
but if one relaly strains
, tehy can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off
. wilde ' s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature
,
and teh result of his folowing this philosophy was that he was imprisoned
, loosing his family
and his career
. the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take
and came to a similar demise
. the main difference was by placing makeup on their face
and acting out on theri deepest fantasies
and inquiries about life
( mostly dealing with androgony
and sexuality
)
, htey bcame less
and less like themselves
and more
and more like everyone else
.
and that ' s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began
. it ' s been said that todd haynes '
" velvet goldmine
,
" the film that chronicles waht it was like tothe be a part of hte movement
, not only from those who experienced it
but by those who created it
, steals a lot from
" citizen kane
,
"
and that ' s true
. in the film
, a british journalist in the 80s
, arthur stuart
( christian bale
)
, is asked to go back
and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade
, a fictitious rock star
, who faked his own death on stage
, bringing the end not only to his career
but to the entire glam rock movement
. structure
- wise
, this totally steals from
" kane
,
" not only from the set
- up
( he interviews three people
,
adn the story is a result ofthe their flashbacks
)
,
but in other things
, liek the beginning
( death
,
then newsreel
)
,
and smaller details
, like the bitter ex
- friend in a wheelchair
and the bitter ex
- wife as a washed
- up lounge singer
, found iin a bar after hours
. this is no
" kane
,
"
and it really doesn ' t aspire to be
: it doesn ' t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like
" kane
" did
,
and it doesn ' t really uncover anything poignant about humanity
. instead
, it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era
and the boredom that ws life after glam rock for those who were participants
. the 80s scenes are dry
and deliriously melancholy
, equipped with a performance by bale thyat is prehaps appropriately dull
and unengaging
.
but the 70s scenes are engaging
,
though
, not to mention addictively campy
. they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era
,
and a feel thta ' s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the
then
- footage
, they become not only a symbol of decadence
,
but of times when everything seemed so simple
. instead of creating the world the way it was
, haynes paints thier own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale
: the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom
anbd liberation that after ytou ' ve experianced it
, everything else seems so mundane
. there ' s no outside world to speak of
, secluding these people inside a protective globe that will evenhtually crack
. haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade
and the other fictitious rock hero
, curt wild
,
and their relationship that created
, molded
,
and
thn brang down the movement
, reducing everyone else who contibuted to it as merely that
- contributors
. blade
- plyed with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers
-
and wild
- played witht anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor
- are littel more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie
and iggy pop
, respectively
, complete witht the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon
and the confirmation that the twpo rock stars may have very well not onyl have been oen
- time partners in music
,
but also partners in bed
. through discussions with slade ' s ex
- manager cecil
( michael feast
)
, ex
- wife mandy
( toni collette
, reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade
)
,
and finally ex
- partner wild
, journalist stuart begins tothe rember his own experiences in the era
, like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity
, including yhe moment when he began questioning his own sexuality
( when he opens up his frist slade record
, he finds a naked
and green slade lying on a crimson blanket
)
,
and finally running away from home to be part of hte london scene
, finally resulting infront leading a boring job in america
. haynes demonstrates that he ' s quite the visual auteur
, molding scenes that are like long heald breaths
, such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade
/ wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover
,
" baby ' s on fire
,
" with scenes from a decadent drug party
;
annd the film ' s most wow
- inspiring sequence
, the first concert scene of wild with his band
, the ratttz
, where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy
- esuqe movements
( including stripping naked
)
and screams thgat the film captures that perfect moment when one dicovers a major talent
,
and anyother
( slade
) discovers his idle
. even the brief music videos
, spoofs of bowie ' s
, have a rare visual flair that ' s pure camp
,
and which would cause ken russell tothe drool
. the best sequence
,
though
, may be the beginning
, following the prelude
, a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement
and the post
- movement era
. in it
, stuart
and his mates are going tothe the infamous slade concert where he fakes his pwn death
, where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination
, whihc brought about tyhe end of the era in one swift fake bullet
. with brian eno ' s famous
" needle in the camel ' s eye
" playing in the background
, the scene has a detached exhileration
- the song doesn ' t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are
. it has a distance that ' s hard to put a finger on
,
and it seems to represent that all this isnt coming tothe a quick
and sad ending
,
and wehn one sees slade in the dressing room befoer the show
, docked in a silver frock with wings
and blue hair
, depressingly staring into the mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film
. this movie ' s not so much about plot
,
bu more about the way it is presented
, making this one of those films which isnt classified as being
" style over substance
,
" a statment whic prompts many critics tothe line up for attack
.
however
, for the most part
, the engaging part of this film is not the story
but rather hte way in which haynes creates this world
, by useing his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
and especially the music to play as characters in his film
. the music is especially notable
. tjhe soundtrack
, which is wall to wall
, consists of ood skool glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno
, t
- rex
,
and roxy music
, as well as covers by slade ' s band
( with vocals by thom yorke
,
adn occasionally rhys meyers himself
)
,
and even newer music by shudder to htikn that sounds uncannily bowie
- like
. tjhe cast is rather impressive
,
but no one really walks away with the film
,
and no performances are extremely good
.
although eddie izzard
, as slade ' s manager
( who challenges slade ' s first manager to an arm
- wrestling match tothe see who gets control of his career
)
and michael feast as the first
and tragic manager come off greatly
,
and collette
and mcgregor have their moments
, rhys meyers
and bale are noticably sub
- par
, neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles
. some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes
. rhys meyers ' brian slade remains merely a methaphor for the glam rock era
, dying when he turned into a retro
- garbo
, resorting to a life of salinger
- ism
,
and found in the mid
- 70s to be lying around
, sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl
. in fact
, no one in this film isnt really seen as a person
, rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived durig the era
. bale ' s character is an especially tough sell
: bitter
and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood
, he ' s not an extremely personal character
,
and his cliched experiences
( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a
" poof
"
) never help us communicate wtih him
. nevertheless
, rhys meyers
adn mcgregor have the excuses that thier characters are nto really characters
but rether the results of an era that has left them
,
and others
, bitter
, part of which helps the film work
, since this is a major piece of eye candy
. at the prime of the movie
, they at least look the role of fashionable leaders
- slade wtih his perpetually
- changing
, androgonys persona
,
and wild with his topless
and unpredictable image
, which clash
and fuse into an unstable union
. their story
- of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who
- cares attitude crossed with camp
- is engaging
, without the personal background
. the story of stuart
,
though
, is a tougher sell because he ' s the everyman
,
and when you can ' t totally identify with the everyman
, your story ' s in slight trouble
. as a cultural rock piece
,
" velvet goldmine
" is rather good
,
but it is merely good
. it never totally takes off
,
although it has moments where it absolutely flies
,
but
then comes back down
. it ' s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments
, surrounded by material that could really be much better
. the beginning is captivating
but slow
, the middle is fantastic
,
anbd the endig is not only shallow
but worse than that
, it drags
( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion
, it coudl probably stop at any point
)
.
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths
? it almost seems liuke ther was noone point in the entire investigation otehr tahn to unearth the past
, which is commendable
but not totally so
. still
, it does what the oliver stone pic
" the doors
" didn ' t dont right
, becoming very insightful to what happened
, useing the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast betwen what made the era so great to those who lieved during it
and why after living through such an era that everything esle seems half
- assed
( i supose the message is
:
" live life
,
but after you ' ve lived it
, what else is the point when you ' ll be forced to live with regretful memories
?
"
)
. the really superb achievement of this film is that durring its flashbacks
, it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era
,
but with the added perk ofthe knowing yhe result of all that goes down
.
