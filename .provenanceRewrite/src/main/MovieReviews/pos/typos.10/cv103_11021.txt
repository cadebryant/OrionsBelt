i think that any competent member of the human race who ' s ever seen a movie
-
- any movie
-
- could probably predict just about eveyr turn in the wedding singer
. even
though i try very hard to not predict films as i ' m watching them
( especially not romantic comedies
)
, the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds
,
and sometimes minutes
, befor i actually saw it happen on screen
.
but i don ' t care
. nto even a little
. my reasons for this are simple
: 1
) adam sandler is great
. 2
) drew barrymore is gerat
. 3
) tje movie is so funny
. htere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard
. i haven ' t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers
. sandler plays robby hart
, a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band
and writing his own music
. in the opening scenes
, he seems liek a happy
- go
- lucky wedding singer
, at least partially enjoying his profession
and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual
( steve buscemi
) who decides that his brother ' s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life
, up to that point
, was utter pointlessness
. a week later
, at his own wedding
, he is left standing at the altar by his ex
- fianc
? e
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
. with his life in complet dissarray
, he meets julia
( barrymore
)
, a waitress
. she is engaged to glenn
( matthew glave
)
,
and is tothe marry him iin baout three months
. julia
and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans
. soon
(
anbd predictably
) it becomes preety clear that glenn is a jerk
,
and that robby
and julia really love each other
. oh sure
, it ' s trite
.
and if anyone making thsi film expected us to
, like
, feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer
,
then they truly underestimated their audience
. what mkaes the story bearable
, aside fomr the terrific costumes
and 80s music
, are the performances
. barrymore is simply adorable here
( i ' ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et
)
. not only is she pleasant to look at
,
but her acting job here raelly is a good one
-
-
and it doesn ' t hurt that the character is likable
and adequately well
- written
.
and the jerk
, played in full
- force by graves
, is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i ' ve ever seen
. naturally
, the true star here is sandler
. i think the guy isnt flat
- out hilarious
. he can say something that just isn ' t funny
,
adn his delivery makes me laugh
. his comedic performance here equals that ofthe happy gilmore
,
but infact this film he goes much further
annd proves tothe me that he can
, indeed
, hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy
. whereas his roles infact his previvous films kind of hadnt sandler playing sandler
, the wedding singer gives him a character that
, for the first time
, he actually has to fit into
. as far as i ' m concerned he succeeded
,
and this film is testimony that he does
, in fact
, have some range in his talents
.
and the movei is just so funny
. perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claimes is a little uneven because he began writting it while in a good mood
and finished it after his fianc
? e abandoned him
. tihs is the part thyat literally had me groping for a breath of air
.
and while the film
, liek all romantic comedies
, takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up
, there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half
. my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren ' t vyre important
. the film is predicable
,
but who cares
? the characters are extremely likable
, the movie is ridiculously funny
,
and the experience is simply enjoyable
. inwhich addition to this
, i can ' t imagine anyone seing yhe preview
and not wanting to see the film
. in that order
, i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review
. i just want everyone to know that i laughed
. a lot
.
