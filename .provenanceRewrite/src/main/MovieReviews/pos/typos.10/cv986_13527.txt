i think thge first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie
. tyhe producers are not stupid
, making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable
. you have to reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, the movie is quite user
- friendly
.
altough
, non
- fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange
.
but fear nto
, duchovny
and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on
. you iwll never feel as if you just walked in on the thrid ect of some great opera
. infront any case
, the answer is no
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing else is on
and i prefer millennium
.
however
, since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for severeal weeks before the movie ' s opening weekend i tookover that opportunity to test the movei
. i taped all ofthe these episodes
and watched them only after seing the movie
, i am glad tothe report that i learned nothing new
. everything you ened to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point
but everybody should git the chance tothe experience this movie
. warning
: major spoilers follow
! please do not read to fully enjoy this movie
, you must not be able know what is coming
, what exactlly is over that hill
and wqat that weird
" hummm
" sound is all about
. you have been warned
. the x
- files is what a summer should be
. exciting
, scary
, grat special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie
and are only there when it is really necessary
)
and good performances
. this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is tghe human equivalent of a wooden plank
. from start to finish
, this movie does not let go of you
. wehn i compare it with last summer ' s movies the best way to describe it would be
: take the excitement
and graet socre from face
/ off
and the deadly use of sound from event horizon
. this flick is scary
, not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where
and when the critter will jump at our heroes
. infact fact
, the first time the critter inwhich this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd
! the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid
. you know
, when you are affraid tothe put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair
, or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files isnt scary
.
and guess waht
? you never even have to see the monster
but your imagination works overtime
and it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right thru it not even scarier than your grandma iin undies type of monster
. do not think that the x
- files is a monster movie
. in fact
, the creature is there for maybe threee minutes total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder episode of the series
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian anderson gets maybe half thge screen time
. she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of teh movie so she does not get to do much
. no
, this is mulder ' s time in the spotlight
. by now
, yuo have heard of the scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if you ahev not
then i will not spoil it fo you
, let ' s just sday that due to recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about
? the dialogue in interesting
and the directer is marvelous
. thte camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right htere with them wehn they opne a door or climb a hill
. the script is spotless
, eveyr thing that happens happens for a purpose
. if you are confused by something
, dont not worry because it will all become clear later on
but
,
annd i cannot stress this enough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, tyhe dialogue is twice as important as the effects
. miss one vital piece ofthe information
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you will go home
and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who ened to go to the bathroom during movies
.
.
. don ' t
! the person who watched the movie wtih me had to go twice
anbd twice she missed an important conversation
. there isnt no timne to take a breather between scenes because
, again unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files doesnt not need to fill scenes between the suspense
and the action with useless subplots
, every scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen only noe movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i ' d recommend
and that is the truman show
but it only wins by a nose
.
bu the truman show is nto what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files is
. what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited
? cool effects
? it ' s got some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non
- fans will have a good time
. it does not provide answers to the show ' s many questions
, the status quo remains nearly the same
and
, no
, mulder
adn scully do not get together
. rating
: four
and a half out of five stars for the best movie
yet this summer
, several jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that one comming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell doed that come from
"
and one heck of an ending
. you may wonder where this movie lost half a star
. well
, i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had tothe find something about the in his ice truck
, the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles
but
then they just stpo
. it ' s pretty obvious the film ' s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long tyme
,
but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky
and started driving
.
