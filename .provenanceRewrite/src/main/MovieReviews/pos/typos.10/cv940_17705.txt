when i first saw the previews fo ron howard ' s latest film
, my expectations weere discouragingly low
. a show about nothing
? sounds like
" seinfeld
.
" a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day
? sounds liuke
" the truman show
.
" what is it with hollywood tath no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants
, another puts one out about bugs
? which is why i was pleasantly surprised by
" edtv
,
" which turns outloud to be a fresh
, insightful
,
and often times hilarious film baout the follies of instant celebrity
. the writing
, by howard ' s longtime collaborators lowell ganz
and babaloo mandel
, is right on the money
and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus
. in the hands of a less
- experienced director
,
" edtv
" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday ' s meatloaf
. with thier ' true tv ' cable ratings being threatend by ' thte gardening channel '
( apparently people would rather watch soil
)
, the northwest broadcasting company is looking forthe a novel concept to attract viewers
. program director cynthia topping
( ellen degeneres
) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody onthe the air
and broadcasting his eveyr waking
and sleeping moment
. the hook isnt to find a regular guy
, someone normal that people cxan relate to
. while scouting possable candidates
, cynthia ' s camera crew discover ed pekurny
and his pig brother ray
( woody harrelson
) in a bar
, where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame
.
but on watching the videotape
, the show ' s producers are more taken with ed than with ray
. he ' s cute
, he says all the wrong things
,
and he ' s 100
% usda hick
. cynthia ' s boss
, played by rob reiner
, gives the show a week to deliver the goods
and it ' s tough goign in the early stages
. the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth
.
" action shooted
!
" wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster
. ytou git the idea
.
but soon enough
, things
-
- nielsen
- boosting kinds of things
-
- start to happen tothe tihs unassuming san francisco video stroe clerk
and the ' true tv ' cameras are right there to document it
. ed ' s privacy is no longer his own
, his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life
,
and what little dignity he has left isnt trampled on by the media
. who should ed go out with
? you can be sure hte pollsters have a list
. not only is the film exeedingly well cast
,
but its performers are consistently excellent
. matthew mcconaughey provides the face
, the body language
,
and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes ofthe america ' s latest phenomenon
. he
and harrelson look like htey really could be brothers
. sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed ' s mother
,
annd martin landau is one of the film ' s highlights as al
, ed ' s ailing stepfather
. jenna elfman
( from tv ' s
" dharma
and greg
"
) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland
adn landau
,
although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a littel distracting
. even degeneres
and reiner are better than yuo ' d expect
. in 1979
, writer
/ director
/ comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called
" real life
" in which a small
- time opportunist makes a real
- time documentary about a typical american family
. thte scenes of ed ' s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken
and waxing idiotic play like a big
- budget variant on that film
, paralleling its wickedly inventive humor
. as with most films by albert brooks
,
" real life
" was funny
,
bu absurd
. the funniest
-
-
and scariest
-
- thing about
" edtv
" is that it is absolutely believable
.
