capsule
: trippy
, hyperspeed action machine from hong kong ' s accomplished tsui hark
. van damme
and rodman have nice chemistry
, the stunts are eyepopping
,
adn stuff gets blowed up real good
; what more do you want
? i admit i wass all set tothe loathe double team
; it reeked of cheapjack timing
- oriented marketing
( stick dennis rodman in a movie
, quick
, hwile he ' s hot
,
and do something about jean
- claude van damme ' s flagging career while we ' re at it
!
)
. surprise
-
- double team transcends its dumb roots
and turns out tothe be a mess ofthe fun
. bring some friends
, get some pretzels
,
and have a blast
. van damme is jack quinn
, an ex
- agent who is brought back in for
" one last mission
"
-
- you ' d think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words
.
but van damme ' s character has a pregnant wife who ' s also a sculptor
,
and some unpleasant pressure gets unsed to get him to come through on this mission
. he ' s been assigned to tkae down an old enemy
, a terrorist named stavros
( mickey rourke
, looking oddly subdued
)
, who may be back up to his old tricks
. in the first showdown between quinn
and stavros
, the movei wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve
: nonstop acation
. an amusement park
, a hospital
, a private
" retired spy
" ' s retreat
, most of rome
, various houses
, planes
, cars
and other modes ofthe transport
,
annd the coliseum
(
!
) all become arenas for some of the most bone
- rattling shoot
- outs
annd punch
- outs filmed
. they are better seen than descibed
and are reason enough to see the film
: one jaw
- dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his
* feet
*
.
( van damme is a good
, dextrous athlete
and fighter
,
but he is often upstaged
.
) there are other nice touches
. stavros
and quinn both want the same thing
: to retire in peace with their families
. that ambition ties them together iin various ways
,
and also humanizes them a bit
. one of the things baout hk action movies is that there ' s always some form of human element
,
and that ' s carried over into htis movie as well
. it gives weight tothe scenes that would otherwise be forgettable
. also good is dennis rodman
, playing a weapons dealer named yaz
-
- a charater who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers
and who is funny just standing there
. rodman isnt natural onthe screen
; he ' s fun tothe watch
, especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs
,
and deserves to get a movie of his own
, based on what ' s seen here
: a lightweight
, fast
- moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently
.
