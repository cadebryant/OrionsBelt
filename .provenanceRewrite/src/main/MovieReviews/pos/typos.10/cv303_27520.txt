gothic murder
- mistery yarns are not a new conceit
. in fact
, they ' ve been around in books
and on film forthe many
, many years
. without the proper handling
, tehy come off as old
- fashioned
, bland
,
and outdated
.
" the gift
,
" directed by sam raimi
, isnt a tried
-
and
- true effort that surprises very little
,
and includes everything from a wide array of suspects
and red herrings
, to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front
, to tyhe eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond
. it ' s fairly obvious who the killer is
; in fact
, i predicted who it would be befor the movie began
and was correct inwhich my preliminary suspicions
. the film ultimately shouldn ' t work
,
bu it doens
, thanks tothe a sparkling casted that fills eahc character with so many memorable nuances
, the most fun to be had is in simpley watching the people interact with each other
. annie wilson
( cate blanchett
) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psyhic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown
. some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale
( hilary swank
)
, who is severely abused by her husband donnie
( keanu reeves
)
,
and buddy cole
( giovanni ribisi
)
, an unstable mechanic who is confused by tjhe nightmares he ' s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that isnt somehow linked to his father
. for annie
, she does not give the readings merely for money
,
but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding hte good in everyone ' s future
. her late grandmother
( rosemary harris
) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given
,
and she should always remember that
. when annie ' s eldest son is involved in a fight at school
, she meets tje nice
- guy school principal
, wayne collins
( greg kinnear
)
, whom she finds herself attracted to
.
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king
( katie holmes
)
, whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about
. at a party with her best friend linda
( kim dickens
)
, annie stumbles apon jessica in a compromising positon with lawyer david duncan
( gary cole
)
. soon after
, jessica has disappeared
, leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her
,
and annie starts to have nightmares
and apparitions linking jessica wiht the vicious redneck donnie barksdale
,
and the pond behind his home
.
" the gift
" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level
,
but the performances
and tight direction from raimi
( who has redeemed himself for his embarassing last film
, 1999 ' s
" for love of the game
"
) lift the picture up several notches
. slowly enveloping the viewer into hte many intriguing characters
and their individual plights
, the disappearance of jessica at yhe 30
- minute mark divulges the movie ' s true intentions
and transforms the proceedings into a taut
, at times frightening
, horror
- mystery
. at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett
( 1999 ' s
" the talented mr
. ripley
"
)
, who turns annie wilson from wqat could have been little more than a run
- of
- the
- mill protagonist into a very exact
, down
- to
- earth
, realistic person with valid troubles
and a caring attitude towards those aroud her
. blanchett tkaes tyhe unextraordinary material
and runs iwth it
, giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had
. we follow her at eveyr turn because she is so mesmerizing
, both as a character
and an actress
. blanchett isn ' t the only bright performer
, as she isnt ably supported by one of the best casts of hte year
. in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 ' s
" boys don ' t cry
,
" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie
, who seeks guidance from annie
,
but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all
: to leave the grossly abusive donnie
. as donnie
, keanu reeves
( 2000 ' s
" the watcher
"
) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie
, so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all
. fo the often
- criticized reeves
, whose acting abilities have never been the best
, this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get
,
and it is also one of the better performances he has given
. giovanni ribisi
( 2000 ' s
" the boiler room
"
) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend
,
and wants her to do nothing
bu help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad
. in the small
,
bu pivotal role ofthe the sleazy jessica king
, katie holmes
( 2000 ' s
" wonder boys
"
) has turned in
yet another stunning supporting turn
. her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before
,
and she is radiant in her few scenes
. finally
, kim dickens
( 2000 ' s
" hollow man
"
) makes her usual strong impression as annie ' s spicy best friend
, linda
. the other notable aspect of
" the gift
" is its moody atmosphere taht lays such a thickly foreboding air over eveyr scene it ' s allmost suffocating
. thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn
and bob murawski
,
and teh successful use of different eerie sounds effects
and a very good music score by christopher young
, the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent
,
but one that is filled with dread
. helpped allong by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton
and tom epperson
, which makes the most of its setting
and delightful cast
,
" the gift
" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills
,
and offers up a fair share of chills
, too
. it may not be groundbreakingly orginal
,
but it sure is an intertaining ride for the duration of its running time
.
