i don ' t box with kid gloves
. i don ' t play nice
, i ' m not a nice guy
,
and i never
, ever
, go easy on a film
. i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movei critic
.
however
, i do some favors
,
and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, the prodcution company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking
, gets several of these points each time
. i still
,
however
, will not go easy on them
. tehy recently sent me a vhs copy of their down whith america trilogy
( which begins
, quite wittily
, with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film
.
)
and i decided to spend an hour ofthe my day watching it
. iin the famous lines of many martyrs
, i have no regrets
. well
, i do have some regrets
,
but that is not the point in the previous sentence
. the point of it was that down with america was a film that
, from a critical standpoint
, did not entirely disappoint me
. sure
, the risky use of vhs instead ofthe super 8mm or 16mm was a pain
,
and the natural ight was one of the most annoying thigns baout public access films
,
but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable
. down with america concerns a government agent
, needless murder
,
and a book containing everything from the unabomber ' s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report
. like the previous films of rigormortis tht i have reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humor
and intelligence
? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail
. the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s
. a dying movement from the day they started
, these paranoid
` thrillers ' had the government always covering up something
and had the same favorite word
:
` roswell
. ' in down with america
, the line
` roswell ' is highly absent
. with an about ten minute running tiome
, down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich
? thast the conspiracy films fell into
, makes jokes at them at teh same time
,
and provides us with funny
and memorable characters
. again
, i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn ' t care less about
. the film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obsessed librarian
( meri stevens
)
, a mistery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
,
and two people obsessed with silence in thte library
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. the plot
: a book containing the secrets ofthe all anarchists is hidden in
? a public library where it can be viewed by all
. from ther we go into a delightful parody
. the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter yhe truth
, the librarian goes onthe a diatribe about the sanctity of books
. we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes tht are performed much too well concidering the lack of coaching of the cast
.
although the actors
and actresses are in small roles
and give a whole new meaning tothe
` no
- name '
, it ends uv being the no
- name people who do a good job
, delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out
. for once
, i don ' t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online
. i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l ' auto
anbd les x
- files
and look up the rigormortis productions site in
and of itself
. it ' s almost as much fun as the film
.
