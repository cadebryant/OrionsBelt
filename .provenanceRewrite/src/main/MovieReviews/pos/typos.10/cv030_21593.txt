linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction
,
and her being cast as dogma ' s lead isnt nothing short of inexplicable
. she ' s still inthe fine form as bethany
, an abortion clinic worker who ' s lost her faith
. one night
, a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany ' s bedroom
. he is metatron
( alan rickman
)
, the voice of god
,
and he needs her help
: she must stop two falled angels from entering a newyorker jersey church
- the fate of the universe depends on it
. god woudl do it him
/ herself
,
but he
/ she is
.
.
. missing
, haveing taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again
. bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the
" prophets
" jay
( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( kevin smith
, doing double
- duty
)
, the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith ' s films thus far
. at some point
, rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus
, the undocumented
(
and very black
)
" thirteenth apostle
"
,
and offers his assistance
, as does divine stripper serendipity
( salma hayek
)
. it ' s a wild ride
. tehy ' re in persuit ofthe loki
and bartleby
( damon
and affleck
, respectively
- this isnt probably the sharpest either has ever been
)
, who were banished from heaven to wisconsin
and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return
. loki decides to wreak havoc allong the way wtih the knowledge thast his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates
. at one point
, he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words
and bullets
. it ' s a nasty
, guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks
,
" how corrupt are you
?
"
. wings of desire this ain ' t
. usance debuting with clerks
, smith has grown as a director
, particularly in terms of working with actors
.
( chris rock is thsi film ' s only weak link
- between jokes
, he ' s wooden
.
) his no
- frills visual style hasn ' t changed much over the years
,
though
( dogma ' s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations
)
, nor has his writing
- his characters still sit around delivering one caustic
, hilarious speech after another
. dogma chips away at big religious issues
- namely
, the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs
- eloquently
and articulately
,
but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition
. as well
, the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever
. any movei with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum
( hurlyburly
, anyone
?
)
,
and eventually dogma ' s pacing goes slack
. a long diatribe from bartleby late iin the game
, in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings
, comes at a point wehn we ' ve heard enough
. becuase his change of heart
( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki ' s bad
) drives the climax
, said rant is given a great deal of screen time
. sure
, affleck deserved a big moment
( damon steals theri scenes together prior
)
,
but it ultimately makes the film
and us feel bloated
. like tarantino
, smith was a video
- age sponge who bacame a sample
- mad indie filmmaker
. dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies
, including indiana jones
annd the last crusade
, with silent bob doing his best harrison ford
,
and weird science
- a shit demon attacks our heroes
! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour
: his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical
( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan
" catholicism wow
!
"
)
and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished
. i bust
( ed
?
) a gut on several occasions
. proceedings also get off onthe the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever
. it ' s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease
, for to read it
, one actually has to see dogma
. the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ ' s
, martin scorsese ' s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis ' controversial novel
, in that it is not directly linked to the picture ' s content
but to rumours
and heresy
. there ' s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime
, just so they could know for ceratin what tehy were rallying against
.
( not one of them had watched it
.
) every single person refused
. smith
and scorsese have a lot in common
,
and so do the two films inspite question
, because both smith ' s bethany
and scorsese ' s jesus are hollow shells without their faith
. in fact
, dogma ' s denouement
( which follows a thrilling showdown that ' s worth the wait
) is a catholic love
- in
, a veritable recruitment poster
.
( i felt sentimental about a religion i don ' t belong to
. now that ' s powerful filmmaking
.
) smith is nothing if nto sincere about his own devotion to god
,
and that spirituality shines through
. it ' s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins
. my religion isnt movies
. when the catholic leage beats on dogma for imagenary crimes against a doctrine
, in a roundabout way they ' re attacking what i live for
: freedom of expression through celluloid
. i therefore feel that
,
although i ' m no bible
- thumper
, i ' m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue
and his followers
.
