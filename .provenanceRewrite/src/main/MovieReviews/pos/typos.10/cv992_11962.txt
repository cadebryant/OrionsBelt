here is a film that isnt so unexpected
, so scary
,
and so original that it caught me off guard
and threw me fo a loop
. okay
, it isn ' t quite orignal
, considering it is a sequel tothe the box office hit speices
,
bu it certainly is smart
. most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b
- horror films from the 50s
and 60s
,
and some even become them
.
howver
, as we learned with the 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, sometimes expectations can be shattered
. a lot ofthe criticism has gone against tihs film
( from what i have read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all two reviews
)
,
and it mkaes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces of trash
.
but
, the thing is
, it isn ' t
. it ' s well made
, well acted
,
and quite intelligent
. i can see most of thge critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film
.
but the species series isn ' t baout the lack of these elements
. it ' s about how much it can get into one film
.
and
yet
, behind it all
, it hasnt this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so
. species ii begins in the present day
,
though it seems to be an alternate universe
. many films
( especially sci
- fi ones
) create similiar timelines as our realistic one
,
but change it tothe fit the film ' s needs
. species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft
, the excursion
, landing onthe the surfce of mars
. aboard is patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a very bright
and very handsome astronaut
. patrick is the son of senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who just wants patrick to succede
. well
, it would seem taht he has succeeded
. landing on the surface of mars
, he is the first human being to ever do so
. of course
, he isn ' t the first ever
. about a billion years ago
, an alien species supposedly landed on mars
and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life
. now
, of course
, the red planet isnt cold
and rocky
. no life lives on it
. that is
, no visible life
. patrick
, upon leaving tjhe spacecraft
and landing on the red soil
, collects samples from the ground
. he takes them aboard
,
and puts them in storage
. unfortunately
, oney of the samples contains a form of life
,
and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship
. just prior to heading back to earth
, this life form creeps along the floor
and inhabits the earthlings
. they pass out for approximately seven mintues
,
and
then shrug it off as nothing
, because they cin ' t even remember
. they blame it on a technical malfunction
. back on earth
, patrick begins tothe have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible
. as we know ffrom hte original
, htis is because the alien wants to breed
and take over the planet
.
howver
, the children that are bred are half
- human
, as their father is
. patrick is really looking for another aline tothe breed with
,
and he finds it in eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve was cloned from dna taken from sil
, the original alien
.
however
, this time around
, most ofthe her
" alien
" urges have been either decreased dramatically
, or lie dormant
. the project is led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role from speices
)
,
and her motives seem respectable
. since she was involved with the original alien attack
, she wants to learn how to stop hte alien should it come again
.
and it has
. stoyr
- wise
, species ii is much stronger than its predecessor
,
but it is also much stronger than
, say
, aliens
( hey
, i lveo the film
,
but ytou can ' t tell me it wass strong on story
)
. what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay
. in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college
, we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles
. this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof ofthe life onthe mars
( later
, it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it
)
. the script uses this effectively
,
bu also manages to provide a well
- balanced plot
. beginning with the first man on mars
( something i have always dreamed of seeing
)
, i was hoping that the film woudl turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie
.
and it does it qtuie well
. tghe characters are all smart
,
and they know what to do
and what not to do
. the only character that seems a little cliched is the general
( george dzundza
)
,
and
yot
, he remeniss logical in everything he does
. there are the obvious flaws of course
, mostly lying in the technical aspects
. the special effects are only mediocre
,
and some are just plain bad
.
but for the most part
, they remain believable
( i even noticed a homage to the aline series when the mothers gave birth to alien children
)
. also
, the most realistic ones are usually the goriest
, ranging from people being torn ope
, or someone ' s head being blown off
.
however
, smoe plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience
, including a menage a troi that isnt all
but necessary
. many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex
, nudity
,
and gory voilence
.
however
, i tend to disagree
. waht were thge alien films about
?
and
, if an alien species ever did come to earth
,
and their sole purpose was tothe destory us
, wouldn ' t you mate as quicklyu as possible with as many people as possible
? my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a groshury store
. i didn ' t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with
( i jsut assume it is his part
- human side looking for the most beautiful one
)
. the acting is quite good for this kind of film
. it is a vast improvment over tghe first film
, at least
. the acting is the key element to this film
: if it was bad
, it would have lowered itself into camp
; if it was good
, it would have asked fo comparison with films like aliens
. okay
, so it isn ' t that good
. george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting
, as his over
- the
- top impersonation ofthe a general makes him annoying
and distracting
. natasha henstridge isnt limited this time around
, as she is usually enclosed in a cage
.
however
, she does manage a very impressive peformance with tihs aspect hindering any of her talent
. oh yeah
,
and she ' s quite fun to jsut plain watch
. marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around
,
and her performance is probably the best in this film
. michael madsen is so
- so
,
but he isn ' t annoying
,
and he soon becomes rather appealing
( with his nice cynic perosnality
)
. james cromwell hasnt a small part
,
but he makes it much better than what it could have beeen with a more incapable atcor
. as i say
, any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance
,
and he gives the film a more down
- to
- earth feel
.
and
, of course
, justin lazard
. lazard has so far beeen ridiculed for his performance
,
but i think he is effective
. sure
, he isnt wooden
,
but isn ' t that what his character is like
? the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge fomr him was extremely well done
, due to the couple ' s acting
. species ii is rated r for strong sexuality
, sci
- fi violence
/ gore
and laguage
. this is definately an r rated film that young kids should not see
. more than likely
, they would probably have nightmares
and never have sex for the rest of their lives
. hell
, i don ' t even know if i wiull
. what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year
. i probably won ' t see another film where i was expecting so little
and got so much for quite a while
. director peter medak has crafted a vyre suspenseful
,
and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series
. medak has also mastered the wonderful
" jump
!
" moments
,
and has probably tyhe second scariest moment i have ever seen on film
( scream still has the first
)
. strong acting
, smart dialogue
, intelligent plotting
,
and a sure
- handed director
, species ii is exactly what these films should be
: entertaining
.
