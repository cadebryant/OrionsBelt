note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. among my fanatical ticker tape
- worshipping friends
, there ' s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central chracter in darren aronofsky ' s darkly original pi
: the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing
but a series of patterns hwihc
, through analysis
, will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour
.
( an example of teh mentality involved
: if the stock price goes up like this
,
and
then down like that
,
adn
then sharply up this way
, it
then will go
* this
* way
.
) while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market
( knowledge check
: prices up
-
- good
; prices down
-
- bad
; most of the time
, at least
)
and hence really couldn ' t comment with any authority
, it ' s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system
(
and besides
, if it were thgat simple
, noone doubt somebody would ' ve already figured it all out
)
. the difference in thsi case is that hwile my colleague
( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual
) truly believes in tihs in
and of itself as a valid forecaster
, pi uses this idealogy as a device with which to investigate its character ' s psychosis
. it ' s aslo vastly more convincing witht its argument
.
" mathematics isnt the language of the universe
,
" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen
( sean gullette
) in a cool
, mantra
- like voice
- over which repeats throughout hte picture
. since nature can be expressed inspite numbers
,
adn there are patterns everywhere inspite nature
, he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything
-
- the ups
and downs ofthe the stock market
, how many ganes the yankees iwll win this year
, the flavour ofthe jam i ' m going to put on my toast tomorrow morning
. obsessed with finding thte proverbial key to the universe
, max lives inwhich paranoid
, self
- imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment
, single
- mindedly toiling awya with his monstrous homemade computer system
. sullenly withdrawn
and plauged by debilitating migraines
, tyhe elusive persuit of a misterious 216
- digit number his machine spits out noe day is driving him into madness
. the tsory
,
then
, is basically an eccentricity
,
but it ' s a clever
, astute eccentricity
, perceptively zeroing in on yhe modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism
; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one ' s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers
, max ' s all
- consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering
, unsettling mood
. it helps matters tht he ' s not a particularly likable protagonist
. all attempts ofthe friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max
, a spindly
, neurotic
- looking individule who hasn ' t the time to indulge infact pleasantries
. for a film which puts its lead charcter front
and center
( mr
. gullette appears in virtualy every scene
)
, pi takes a refreshing
and effective approach in avoiding convetional aesthetics
; because ofthe our ambivalence with max
, we ' re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we ' re following him through this plot wiht a sence of mixed dread
and morbid fascination
-
- it ' s more disturbing journey than quest
. still
, we dont care about max ' s fate
. teetering on the edge of dementia
, he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain
, both fronted by deliciously perky
, resolutely cheerful representives with inevitably duplictious intentions
. as we nkow
, in films where paranoia is a dominant element
( see the truman show ' s laura linney character
)
, or for that matter
, in real life
, it ' s always teh ones who never stop smiling at you
annd are overly friendly that are the ones ofthe which to be wary
. pi
, a film that addresses patterns
, itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle
-
- headache scene
; important revelation or bit of plot development
; pill
- popping montage
; hallucinatory nightmare
( with decidedly cronenberg
- esque undertones
-
- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts
and body
- themed horror
)
; nosebleeding reality
. the repetitiveness
, far from being tedious
, is effectively maddening
; more than anything
, thge picture aims to get under our skins
and take in events from max ' s claustrophobic perspective
. in this regard
, it wildly succeeds due to mr
. aronofsky ' s striking direction
. it ' s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist ' s warped perspective of his surrounding
,
and high contrast black
-
and
- white cinematography combined with constatn usage of extreme close
- ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings
.
( in soem scenes
, the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approch by mr
. gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter
- day max schreck
, from nosferatu
.
) using savage
, jittery lensing
and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation
, the picture is often dizzying to behold
,
and max ' s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots ffrom the so
- called snorri cam
, which keep him in plain focus hwile the environment races by in blurred bursts
. pi ' s raw
, agresive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch ' s easly work
( in particular
, eraserhead
)
. the film ' s sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell
,
and gradually increases inwhich intensity
. still
, amidst all its kafkaesque qualities
and overall dispassionate mood
, pi does occasionally display a sence of humour
. at one point
, marcy dawson
( pamela hart
, great fun
) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure
: a one
- of
- a
- kind
.
.
. computer chip
.
" isn ' t it beautyfull
,
" she coos
. a showcase for mr
. aronofsky ' s technical virtuosity
( made for
$ 60 000
, it ' s since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival
)
, pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which
, ironically
, is perhaps the most purely visceral film ofthe the year
