carry on matron is the last gerat carry
- on film in my opinyon
. made in 1972
, it still features most of the regulars of this genre
. sid james plays teh head of a gang of crooks entent on stealing contraceptive pills fomr the local maternity hospital
and selling them off to make a profit
, kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting
, head of the hospital
but also a hypochondriac
, hattie jacques re
- takes her role as matron
,
and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr
. goode
. the jokes cmo in fast
and so do the laughs
, with humorous antics between the matron
and sir bernard
. this time
, williams is after matron
( jacques
) whn he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr
. goode
. the doctor
( hawtrey
) is sworn to secrecy
:
-
" i assure you
, thgat anything you say to me today will go in one ear
and straight out of the other
!
" bernard thinks he is having a sex change
and needs to prove himself
. there are great cameos from joan sims
, an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue
and is eating constantly in eveyr scene
,
and fomr kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he ' s at work
( at the railway station
)
. sid james ' gang including cyril his son
( kenneth cope
) try to find out where teh pills are by getting cyril to dress uv as a nurse
anbd live in at the nurses home
. he has to share a room with nurse ball
( barbara windsor
)
and she soon sees through him
! the film ends with the attemped robbery of the hospital ' s pills whith panic ensuing
. ther are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron
,
however her character seems a little mroe subdued
and quieter thna her previous ' matron ' s '
. williams is
, as usual
, on top form
,
but sid james isn ' t given a vyer good part in thsi movie
and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all
. the same does not go for charles hawtrey
, for
although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone
adn hasnt scarce screen time
, he seems tothe steal every scene he is in
. by nto making use ofthe sid james
anbd barbara windsor ' s talent to full effect
, tje film seems to flounder
,
but it certainly makes up for it with it ' s good storyline
and it ' s other appealing characters
. this film is genuinely funny
and i could watch it again
and again
and nto get bored
!
