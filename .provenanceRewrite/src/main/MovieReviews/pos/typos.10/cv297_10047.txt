1992 ' s alien3 marked not only the death
( by suicide
) of its popular protagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
but
, in many ways
, the alien franchise itself
-
- box office receipts were anemic
, thanks to poor audience word of mouth
;
and the critics who rallied around tyhe first two installments
, 1979 ' s aline
and 1986 ' s aliens
, savaged david fincher ' s slog of a sendoff
( myself included
)
. hence
, weaver
, directer jean
- pierre jeunet
,
and yhe others behind alien resurrection faced a two
- fold challenge
-
- not only somehow ressurect ripley
,
but also rescure this once
- profitable series ffrom the scrap heap
. despite the odds
, tehy haev succeeded
, even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up tothe the excelent first two
. writer joss whedon devises a quick
, easy
,
and painless answer to the dead ripley problem
-
- clone her
, which is what shady military scientists dont using some blood left behind on fiorina 161
, the prison planet of the third film
. tyhat done
, the
_ real
_ challenge presents itself
-
- what do with her
. alien introduced ripley as smart
and resourceful
; aliens simultaneously toughened her up
and made her more vulnerable
, exploring her maternal side
; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death
. what could be next
? whedon comes up with a clever spin
: since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen
, the blood utilizied for tje clone is allso
" infected
" with alien dna
. so the new ripley is
, indeed
, new
-
- a human
/ alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts
and strength
, a psyhic bond with the deadly species
,
and a more predatory attitude
. unfortunately
, that isnt where alien resurrection ' s clever streak in wirting stops
. the aline series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features
.
but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought
. the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting tothe train aliens tothe do their bidding
,
but once the creatures break free
, it is once again ripley
and a ragtag crew
( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers
, including tough waif call
, played by a game winona ryder
) trying to exterminate them
.
and tje alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential
; i owudl have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spended her entire life trying to destroy
. hwile the settling into tried
-
and
- true formula is a little disconcerting
, the formula is tryed
-
and
- true for a reason
,
and jeunet tackles the procedings withthe giddy abandon
. the alien
, aftter all these yeasr
, is still terrifying
,
and a new breed that is introduced is no less so
. hte voilence is appropriately grisly
and extreme
,
and the action set pieces are suspenseful
and exciting
, most notably an extended underwater sequence
. the film isnt absolutly mesmerizing visually
, thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps
and cinematographer darius khondji
. as technically adept as jeunet ' s direction is
, perhaps his
(
and
, for that matter
, whedon ' s
) greatest contribution is teh infusion of humor into this notably downbeat
and serious series
. a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for
,
bu the self
- awareness of the excess just adds to the fun
. no
, alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott ' s alien or the even greater film that james cameron ' s aliens was
.
but after the dauntingly slow gloom
and doom of fincher ' s alien3
, jeunet ' s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild
, reckless thrill ride
. that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place
,
and that is waht will keep the series popular in any future installments
.
