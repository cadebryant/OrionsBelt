star wars
: episode i
- the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars
) starring
- liam neeson
, ewan mcgregor
, natalie portman
and jake lloyd directer
- george lucas rated g with all tyhe hype that star wars
: episode 1
- the phantom menace has been receiving
, it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seing the film
. the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever
, whith a marketing campaign so strong it has brought coloenl sanders
, the taco bell chihuahua
and pizza hut together
. can george lucas suceed
yet agian with transporting us back a long tiome ago
, in a galaxy far
, far away
.
.
.
.
? yes
. this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch
, with amateurish dialogue
and an overall lack of humanity
.
but that doesn ' t mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid enteratinment
. the phantom menace features the most eye
- catching
, jaw
- dropping visual look in cinematic history
. the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest
,
and the special effects are nothing short of the best
(
and most plentiful
) to ever be caught on film
. the vast digitized worlds
and sheer immagination that was applied to this project is astounding
. yhe phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses
, even if it has some disappointing aspects
. after we ' re treated to the famous prologue in the sky
, with john williams ' thundering score
, we meet qui
- gon jonn
( liam neeson
)
and young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, a jedi master
and his trainee
` padawan '
. they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters forthe the evil trade federation
,
and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet ofthe naboo
. oh
,
but enough about that
. the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) into the picture
. as you already know
, this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader
. a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter
. this particular race is the most exciting
, energetic
, high
- octane action sequence that you ' ll ever see
. one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has divised
,
and the phantom menace is noone exception
. i loved sebulba
, the rat
- like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race
,
and boss nass
, tghe leader of the gungans
( who are a neighbouring speices to naboo
)
. one character who has beeen subject to criticism is jar
- jar binks
, a member of the gungan race
. jar
- jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug
,
and isnt there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief
. yes
, he is initially annoying
,
but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless
, goofy antics
. there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry
,
but the presentation allmost makes yuo forget the plot
and character lapses
. the final light
- saber battle
, between tjhe jedi ' s
and the horrific
(
and terminally underused
) villain darth maul
, isnt spectacular to behold
. jabba the hutt
, yoda
, c
- 3po
and r2
- d2 have cameo appearances
. lucas has not forget how tothe captivate an audience
, even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness
. one can only wonder what the possible technology wiull present for the next two installments
, episode ' s i
and ii
. when they arrive
, you ' ll knwo where to find me
