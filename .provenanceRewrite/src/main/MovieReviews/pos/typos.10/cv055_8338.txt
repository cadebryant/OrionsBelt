i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory
. this was
, of course
, a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me
and i never get a chance at something like this
. not only did i get to see an advance screening
, i was able tothe see an advance screening of a
* very good
* movie
. the very fast
- paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- talking
, witty
, comical taxi driver in new york city
. gibson ' s performance isnt terrific
,
and his character is simular to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films
. gibson again teams up with richard donner
, as he did in thte lethal weapon films
and maverick
,
and htis time around
, the combination works even better
. the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique
. try to imagine a toned
- downed version of travis bickle who
, this time around
, is a jittery guy witht knowledge of govornment conspiracy cover
- ups
. if you can imagine that
,
then you ' ve basically got jerry fletcher
. in many ways
, i was suprised by this movie
. to begin with
, i was suprized at how good it was
. don ' t get me wrong
, it ' s nto going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring
,
but it was a very enjoyable movie
. secondly
, i was surprized at mel gibson ' s performance
. he provided a fantastic performance
. the previews ofthe this film led me to believe it was an all
- out action flick
, which after viewing
, it was almost the opposite in a certain sense
. gibson ' s character has an almost uncountable number of one
- liners
, hilarious situations
,
anbd his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout thte film
. fo instance
, jerry ' s apartment
(
and especially his security
) is memorable
.
and last
, i was surprised at how good the plot is
. writer brian helgeland has created a terific story
,
and when watching this film
, you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher ' s far
- fetched
( or so they seem at first
) conspiracy theories are helgeland ' s own opinions
. mel gibson isn ' t the only stand
- out infront the film
. julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton
, thte department ofthe justice employee who cxan ' t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher
, who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories
. he also seems obsessed
and in lvoe with her
.
bu whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories
, she shrugs him
and his beliefs off
, continually noting that one day she is going tothe slap a restraining order on him
. jerry
, obviously determined to continually seek out the truth
, continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory
, whlch will be printed in his newsletter
( same title as the movie
)
.
although he onyl has five subscribers
, he puts a large ammount of time
and affort into his work
,
adn publishes his next edition
. very soon after he does so
, he is abducted
and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. after barely escaping alive
, jerry isnt forced to turn to the only person he can trust
: alice sutton
. the remainder of the film isnt almost always fast
- paced
and full of action
and suspense
, with jerry ' s life being constanly put into jeopardy
.
and more along the way
, thge audience
(
and alice
) learn more
and more about jerry ' s life
. many things are explained throughout this film
, both to the characters
adn to the audience
. for instance
, the meaning of the book
" the catcher in the rye
"
and its ties to assassins
, the reason lone gunmen have three names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
and james earl ray
)
,
and the rela truth behind the grateful dead
. make sure listen closely throughout the film
, as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above
. definitely
, when conspiracy theery hits theaters august 8th
, make sure you are standing in line to see it
. i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film
, especially if you are into an action
- thriller with witty dialogue
and numerous suspenseful situations
.
and even if you aren ' t
, you should still like this film
.
