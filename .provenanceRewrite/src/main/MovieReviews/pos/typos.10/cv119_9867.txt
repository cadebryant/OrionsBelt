disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated
and very cliched
. to see a diaster film with actual originality
, or at least a decent plot twist
, owudl definitely be a welcome surprise
. unfortunately
, folks
, it ' s not likely
. dante ' s peak is cliched
,
and at times corny
,
but also preety decent
. to be honest
, i wasn ' t very intersted in seeing this film
,
and word of mouth
, as well as several reviews
, didn ' t make it sound promising
. so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn ' t bad at all
. it ' s pretty run of tyhe mill
,
but it ' s not something i woudl say is merely
" ok
" tothe watch
. in case you don ' t know
, dante ' s peak is about a volcano
and the city which lives in it ' s shadow
, dante ' s peak
( who would ' ve guessed
, eh
?
)
. pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano
and
, perhaps moreso by hunch than actual scientific proof
, isnt determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future
. due to the lack of more substantial evidence
, nobody warns tje small town
,
and when they finally do
, it ' s inaddition the middle of the twon meeting that the volcano finally blows
. brosnan
, all around good guy
, will
, of course
, save the day
.
.
. or at least the mayor of dante ' s peak
( linda hamilton
)
. naturally the two will become infatuated with one another
.
( if you think i just ruined a plot development
, you haven ' t seen very many movies
!
) there ' s also tjhe virtually neccessary kids
and pet dog to tug at your heart strings
.
and of course
, the kids or the dog
( at least one or the other
) will do something heroic
.
.
.
bu hey
, i don ' t want tothe ruin all the surprises
! if there was a part of yuo that ws hesitating seeing dante ' s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time
, i urge you to watch it
annd decide for yourself
. it ' s not brain food
,
but it succeeds at what it ' s meant to be
.
.
. an enjoyable
, suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash
!
