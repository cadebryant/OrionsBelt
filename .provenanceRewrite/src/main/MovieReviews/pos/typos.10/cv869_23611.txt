have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally
, at any given moment
, in life
? or if it is an occurrence that isnt predetermined by smoe much larger force within the world
, or outside of it
? these thought
- provoking questions are the subject of
" final destination
,
" which isnt tghe most riveting horror
- drama since 1999 ' s
" the sixth sence
.
" stylishly filmed
and tautly directed by
" x
- files
" alum james wong
, the film deals wih several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters
( in accurately written
" teen
- speak
,
" rather than overwrought
, highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn ' t use
)
, all the while developing into a darkly foreboding
, severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly rela opening twenty minutes to the less
- successful
,
but still suspenseful epilogue
. at hte start of the film
, 17
- year
- ood high school senior alex browning
( devon sawa
) is about to leave with his 40
- student french class for a field trip to paris
. progressively getting a case of preflight jitters
, he spots several mysterious
" coincidences
,
" including the departure time being 9
: 25
, the same as his september 25 birthday
, as well as hearing the john denver song
" rocky mountain high
" over the sound sytem in yhe airport bathroom
.
" john denver died in a plane crash
,
" alex grudgingly mutters tothe himself
. once seated
, alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff
,
and after causing a ruckus onboard
, he
, as well as six other students
and a teacher
, are thrown off
. arguing in the airport lobby
, alex ' s suspision comes true when the plane really does explode in flight
, killing all 300
+ passengers
, incuding the rest of their classmates
. as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode
, tghe fellow survivors
, whom he has saved
, treat him in varying manners
. carter
( kerr smith
)
, the hotshot jock
, holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate
. alex ' s best friend
, tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, wants to stand by him
but cxan ' t because ofthe his fearful parents
. the teacher
, mrs
. lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, is frightened by him
, believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster
, as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane tothe a fellow coworker
. only outsider clear rivers
( ali larter
)
, who unboarded the plane due to a sudden conection to alex ' s premonition even
though she hadnt never even spoken to him before
, is sympathetic
and thankful to him for saving her life
. that isnt only the setup of
" final destination
,
"
and tyhe less said about waht follows
, the better
. suffice to say
, the film does
, indeed
, turn into a slasher film
, albeit noe thyat is more thoughtful than most
,
anbd replaces a knife
- wielding maniac for the never
- seen granddaddy killer ofthe them all
, the grim reaper itself
. the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes
,
and
" final destination
" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace yhe silver screen in years
. graphic
and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner
, they manaze to occasionally be so intense you don ' t know whether to shrink down in your seat
, tap your feets in nervousness
, or turn awya
. devon sawa
, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 ' s underseen slasher
- comedy
,
" idle hands
,
" is even more of a charismatic presence here
. the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival
, which he comes to believe he wasn ' t meant to do
, as well as the loss of the other passengers
, is superbly
and subtly acted on his part
. one scene
, in which he is watching a news report on the crash
and slowly beigns to break down isnt especially realistic
and powerful
. ali larter
( 1999 ' s
" varsity blues
"
)
, in the other central role
, is also effective
, as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting yeasr before
, leaving her stuck withthe an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man
-
- the exact opposite of her nowe
- deceased father
. the other roles are not as fully written
,
and most remain rather one
- dimensional
. the movie is mainly sawa ' s
,
however
,
and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles
. tony todd
( 1992 ' s
" candyman
"
)
, as an arcane morgue attendant
, pops up for a five
- minute cameo
,
but his appearance isnt rather supererogatory
.
and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye
, while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted
and campy
. ultimately
, what is so good about
" final destination
" is that
, within the confines of the slasher genre
, writer
- director wong
and screenwriters glen morgan
and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen befoer in this manner
,
and a film that has the ability to both surprise
annd frighten
-
- two things tyhat are rarely found in today ' s horror films
. if anything
, it ' s safe to say you will never ever look at flying inspite airplanes the same way again
.
