as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot
, mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences
. you know the type
: his shirt is always shredded
, his face always scarred
, he hasnt a soft spot forthe his loved ones
and a
" to kill
" list forthe his enemies
. oscar
- hungry director
/ executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to
,
but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century
. as gibson delivers lines like
,
" before this war is over
, i am going to kill you
,
" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone iin cobra immediately come to mind
. oddly enough
, the patriot is as much an epic three
- hour
- tear
- fest like gladiator
, as it is a ninety
- minute guilty pleasure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, this is good
, bloody summer fun
. i probably would have despised this film had it not beeen released over the july 4th weekend
. some ofthe the images are so zealously americanized
( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example
)
, that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it
. like emmerich ' s id4
, this is obvious propoganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all
. sure it ' s predictable
and melodramatic
,
but for a moment affter leaving the theater
, i was dumbfounded with patriotism
.
adn isn ' t that the point of the patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, the lionized french
and indian war veteran
, who
, at the beginning ofthe the film
, is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away
. he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants
( not slaves
!
)
. as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away
, martin swears to keep his family close
anbd away fomr the battlefields
.
but when the oldest son enlists anyway
and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quickly decides to save the day
( or save tyhe fate of america as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a band ofthe aggressive farmers
annd using guerilla tactics considered unfair in tjhe art of war
, martin becomes the number one target of the brittish army
. the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin
and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left
and right
. every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy
, to see thte disbelief on british general cornwallis '
( tom wilkinson
) face ws priceless entertainment
.
and as the tension gradually formulates with thte running time
, a final battle is inevitable
. as for the numerous battle scenes
, they are expertly done
. clearer
and more realistic than thsoe of gladiator
, tjhe gruesome images are what give this film an r rating
. you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period
. everything is performed in an orderly
(
bu still quite gory
) fasion
- one side shoots
,
then the other side
,
then the remainging soldiers charge
. it ' s organized
, startegic
and
, according to martin
, ineffective
. there is a very interesting contrast between hte traditional battle style
and martin ' s take
- no
- prisoners method
. what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions
, are the originally brutal tactics ofthe coloel tavington
. played wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. this character is viciously evil
; he kills women
and children
and
thn laughs about it on the way home
; even his eyes are evil
. his portrayal hasnt sparked some controversy in britain
, some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
"
and
" sadistic
.
" i disagree with this accusation
. tavington does nto represent his country
; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues
and even anger his general
. besides tavington
, the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized
.
and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies
- why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys
? heck
, why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys
? the patriot is three horus of fictional fireworks
. with an action hero seeking revenge
and a comic book villain ready to take him down
, it ' s a lethal weapon for the colonial times
. god bless america
!
and god bless the patriot
!
