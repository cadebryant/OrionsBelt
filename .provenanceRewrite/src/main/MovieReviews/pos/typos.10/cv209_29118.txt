susan granger ' s review of
" osmosis jones
"
( warner bros
.
) if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy
& physiology in school
, no one would cut ever class
. this hip
, live action
/ animation sotry begins as a monkey snatches a hard
- boiled egg ffrom frank
, a zookeeper
( bill murray
)
, who grabs it back
, drops it
,
then gobbles up the contaminated morsel
, explaining
,
" if it hits
and ground
and you pick it up within 10 seconds
, you can eat it
.
" like
" fantastic voyage
"
( 1966
)
, the pseudo
- science animation
then takes over when his body ' s immune sytem contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system
:
" be on the alert for illegal organisms
!
" eager to right
" a stomach evacuation mistake
" he once made
, a cocky
, clever
, courageous white blood cell
( chris rock
) declares
,
" this is a crime scene
!
"
and teams up with a conscientious
" phi beta capsule
" 12
- hour cold remedy called drixenol
( david hyde pierce
) to chase down
and destroy the deadly
" red death
" virus
( laurence fishburne
) that ' s determined to take frank down in 48 hours
, beating ebola
and e
. coli to a medical record
. watch out for mucus mudslides
, chaos in cerebellum hall
and the detritus from booger dam
( runny nose
)
, along with comic turns from molly shannon
annd chris elliot
, plus the voices of william shatner
and brandy norwood
. peter
and bobby farrelly
, along with writer mark hyman
and animation directors piet kroon
and toom sito
, have turned their penchant fo gross
- out comedy
, encompassing flatulence
, festering sores
and
" popping a pimple without a permitt
,
" into a funny
, farrelly
- funny family film
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" osmosis jones
" isnt a wildly imaginative
, original
, explosive 7
.
and perhaps
, as they ' re laughing
, kids will learn where tothe find their uvula
, along with nuggets about nutrition
and hygiene
.
