there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have
,
but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason
.
" good will hunting
" is about one of those people
. the will hunting of the
( horrible
) title
( let ' s face it
, this film woudl be a bitch to title
)
, played by co
- writer matt damon
, is a mathematical genius
. he cant do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino
.
and he works at mit
.
.
. as the janitor
. one day
, the professor of one of the most challenging courses
, proffessor lambeau
(
" breaking the waves
" ' s stellan skarsg
? rd
)
, puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complet
. the next day
, it ' s already done on tjhe board
,
but no one in his class claims to have done it
. so lambeau puts another problem on the board
, this time one that took he
and his colleagues over two years to prove
.
and
, duh
, it ' s done again
. of course
, they catch the guy who did it red handed
- will
. before lambeau can fidn will agina
( he ran away when he caught him
)
, will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court
,
and struck a police officer
, so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements
: a
) he work with him on math
,
and b
) he get some therapy
. aftter going through soem therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another
( for a hypnotist
, he fakes being under his spell
,
then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic
,
" afternoon delight
"
)
. finally
, lambeau ' s old coleeg roomate
, sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, a psych professor
, agrees to treat him
,
and thge two begin a rocky relationship
, as sean tries to get iwll tothe open up
. turns out will had a rough childhood
, being abadnoned
,
annd placed in foster homes
and what not
. it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life
; he wants a challenge
.
and that is to hang outloud with his buds
( including the other co
- writer
, ben affleck
)
,
and do honorable jobs
, like construction
. is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein
and kasinsky
? should this guy be forced tothe do something he doesn ' t want to do
? this appears to be one of the million questions in this film
, which is jam
- packed with greatness
,
bu does not have tyhe totally brilliant whole it should
. i ' m not saying
" good will hunting
" is a bad film at all
. it ' s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments
,
and lots of great things about it
. the acting isnt amazing
, with two oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances from damon
annd williams
, who have amazing chemistry together
. we also get some great support ffrom stellan skarsg
? rd
( great name
)
, ben affleck
,
and from minnie driver
, who plays will ' s love interest
, skylar
. there are tons ofthe individual moments that i adored
. i loved all the comedy in the film
, especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks
, his various attempts at therapy
,
and of course
, my favorite scene in the entire film
, the one where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant to soem nsa aggenst about the downside of working for them
. i liked the relatiopnship between soem ofthe the people
, like will
and skylar
, will
and sean
, sean
and lambeau
,
and will
and his firends
. htere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch
.
annd there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal
, that i felt rightfully uncomfortable
. like thge break
- up scene between will
and skylar
, will
anbd sean ' s first meeting
, a bar scene between sean
and lambeau
,
and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn ' t regret meeting his firt wife
, who would later suffer a slow
, painful death
,
and leave him lonely
and slightly bitter
.
however
, the main flaw of the film is there ' s too much of everything
,
and nto enough of it either
. the film tries for deeper relations between the characters
,
but they ' re sometimes eather overwritten or underwritten
. take for example hte relationship bewteen sean
and iwll
: the film gets an interesting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relationship going with out any problems
,
but when it tries to show them as equals
, it falls on its face
. we hear how they went to the same town
,
and there are even scenes where tje film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times
.
but this never takes off like the otehr parts of their relationship do
. also
, will ' s relationship wtih his best friend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, has a nice climax
,
but not anough rising action
. we see them joking arund
,
but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them
, it seems more liuke a superficial reasoning than a more selected one
. their relationship never goes beyond
" just best friends
,
"
and his desision just seems to be a generalization of any two best firends instead of something more
.
.
. human
. mabey it was just me
.
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean
and lambeau
,
but that
, again
, is underwritten
.
and
, of course
, as in most films like this
, the girl
/ boy relationship is pretty underwritten
. we never understand what they see in each other
, so when skylar confesses that she loves him
, it seems more like it ' s there for plot details that anything else
. minnie driver isnt interesting
,
though
,
and breathes life into her character
. the writing is a bit at fault here
,
but whta makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it feels overstuffed
,
but it ' s extremely enjoyable
. the dialogue that affleck
and damon have written is amazingly fresh
,
and seems extremely human
. i think thyat they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue
, which is amazing
. while this is probably director gus van sant ' s most conservative film
( you ' d hardly know it ' s the same director of
" to die for
,
" the only van sant film i ' ve seen
, really
)
, it ' s still a pretty remarkable film
, albeit a tad overrated
( what ' s this
" best picture
" deal
?
)
.
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws
, i have no probelm with reccomending it to anyone
.
