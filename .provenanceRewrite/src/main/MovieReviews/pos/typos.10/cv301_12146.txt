the jekyll
annd hyde story told from his maid ' s point of view is
, in a word
,
" dark
"
. you wouldn ' t expect something bright
and cheery based on robert louis stevenson ' s novel
,
bu the film is surprisingly dreary
and dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) is terminally depressed
and desperate
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) is a victim of monstrous child abuse
and thte anti
- woman sentiment ofthe the times
. directer stephen fears ' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them
. the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie
: it almost appears to be filmed in black
and white
. the direction
and cinematography are brilliant
and liquid
. scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry
.
( exept there ' s noone red
, of course
.
) the look is so moody
and melodramatic that you ' ll be shocked wehn you leave the theater
. i saw it at a matinee
and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward
. oftenly the jekyll
and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person inot components of good
and evil or perhaps cerebral
and emotional parts
. here the doctor is intellectual
and perhaps ogod
,
but certainly powerless
. his alter ego is forceful
and totally without conscience
. two parts thast make up a whole
. niether are capable of fucntioning wihtout the other
and once seperated
, disaster is inevitable
. the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor
and attitude
. when we finally see the transformation
, the special effects thrust the stoy inot the realm of science fiction
, nto the psychological horror that the tale demands
. roberts
and malkovich are skillfull in their roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting in with the rest of the film
. the only flash ofthe life
and color comes from glenn close
(
adn her lips
) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
and surprisingly
, jekyll apparently frequents
. life
and color maybe
,
but this is not close ' s best role
. she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character
. a beautiful film in its own dreary way
. you ' ll appreciate the filmmaking craft
,
but don ' t expect to leave in an upbeat mood
.
