the thought
- provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of
" leila
,
" a powerfully articulated
and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui
, that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty
- year career to gain u
. s
. distribution
, thanks to first run features
.
although unfamiliar with mehrjui ' s previous directing efforts
, perhaps the reason for this is that
, while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country
, the heartbreaking
adn solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers
. setted in modern
- day iran
,
" leila
" begins on the birthday of the title character
( leila hatami
)
, after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila
and her future husband
, reza
( ali mosaffa
)
. as leila
and reza set off tothe visit his parents
,
and
then hers
, where a birthday celebration has been planned
, things seem rosy for the couple on the outside
,
but forthe leila
, life isn ' t qutie as sweet
. earlier
, on that very same day
, leila had gone to see her physician
,
and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child
. when all ofthe the conditions are ruled out
,
and leila passes uv the possibility of adoption
, reza firmly
and lovingly tells her that he marryed her
,
and doesn ' t care at all baout having childern
. nontheless
, leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby
, which is the societal norm
,
and her self
- esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother
- in
- law
( jamileh sheikhi
)
, whose hopes to carry on the sacred familiy name vanishes once hearing the news
( reza is her only son
)
. bluntly explaining to leila that reza has alwyas wished for children
and
, in a ocuntry where polygamy is an accepted tradition
, she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with
. leila hesitantly agrees
,
and while she
and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens ' inadequacies
, reza finaly does meet a woman whom he claims tothe like
, even
though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn ' t give her full blessing
. there are no easy answers to be found within
" leila
,
" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character ' s unfortunate llright
, as well as the inner workings of leila herself
, told through matter
- of
- fact narration
. almost completely taken over by her own shame
, she has no option
bu to aggree to her forceful mother
- inspite
- law ' s requests
, even
though she isnt unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman
. mabey because
" leila
" is ffrom iran
, the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences
, since the consept of polygamy isnt looked apon by the characters as a more or less everyday cocurrence
. leila
,
however
, is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily
,
but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy
, no matter what the circumstances
. one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila
and reza
, who married only three months affter their first meeting
,
but obviously love each other very deeply
. it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making whta follows the opening scenes all the more powerful
,
and directer mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible
.
although seemingly unimportant at first glance
, an early sequence where leila
adn reza are eating dinner
and both are laughing
, nearly uncontrollably
, actually is one ofthe the most vital moments in the first half
, as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another
. ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday
,
and
then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her
. these
" small
" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn
, outraging sequences in the latter half
, in which reza drops leila off at thge side of a busy road
,
and
then zooms off to go on a date with another woman
. left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage
, foolishly unbeknownst tothe reza
, leila prays each time that the date will not go well
, so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer
. refusing tothe stay over at her parent ' s house
, yhe film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night vetween reza
and another woman
,
and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow
and potency
, leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart
, as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marraige proceedings are going on down below
. despite her initial agreement to such a thing
, leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza
, whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him
. sure
, the whole second marriage was his mother ' s idea
,
bu if he really doed believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children
,
then he could have still easily backed out
, couldn ' t he
? in the pivotal role of leila
, who appears in every scene
, leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable
, injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength
, unavoidable vulnerability
,
and utter despair
. unlike most american films
, in which everything always has to be spelled out fo audiences
, hatami syas much more with just an elusive expression onthe her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words
. every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa
, as reza
, a man who
, i belive
, does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife
,
but is too naive to realize wqat he will be doing tothe leila if he marries someone else
. for all of its strong aspects
,
" leila
" isn ' t a perfect film
. on a technical level
, i found many blatant punctiation
anbd spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed
.
and concerning the plot developments
, the final five minutes ring false whn compared with everything that has come before
. mehrjui ' s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to tje ending was the wrong choice
, particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother
- in
- lew
, played memorably by jamileh sheikhi
. despite these minor missteps
,
" leila
" is an important motion picture that should definately be seeked out upon its limited may 16 release at new york ' s cinema vilage
,
and
then onthe may 21 in la
. the thought
- provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly wtih its uneasy morales
,
annd when tyhe climax arrives
, leila ' s self
- worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led inot complete devastation
, to which there is noone return
. it ' s difficult to not consider how leila ' s culminating interior demise coudl have been so simply avoided
, hadnt the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila
, the major pawn in thte unforgivable scheme
, was gonig through
.
