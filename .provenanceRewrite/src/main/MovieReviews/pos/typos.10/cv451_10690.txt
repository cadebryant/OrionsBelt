trekkies
, roger nygard ' s energetic
and hilarious documentary
, brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions
. the beauty of the film is that it isnt good old fashion fun for trekkies
and non
- fans alike
.
( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs
. trekker polemic as not worth arguing about
.
) the good
- spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable
, loud giggles
,
yet hte picture treats its subject matter with respect
and a certian awe
. denise crosby
, who played tasha yar on
" star trek
: the next generation
,
" serves as the host
. in teh opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary
( oed
)
.
( the oed cites a febuary
, 1976 caption in the
" new yorker
" as thte first recorded usage of the word
.
) unless ytou ' ve been to the conventions
, i posit taht you have no idea of the dedication of some ofthe the fans
. one pointed out
, apologetically
, that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate
. others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended
, several dozen being typical
and hundreds nto unheard of
. my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams
. argubly the most famous of all tyhe trekkies
, she wears her uniform eveyr waking hour as many die
- hard fans do
. her claim to fame is that
, as a juror on the whitewater trial
, she weared it in court as well
.
" every day i would walk past the reporters witht a vulcan
- like stoicism
,
" she says
, decribing her way of dealing with tjhe crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obession
. she doesn ' t quite understand all of tghe uproar
.
" i ' m an officer of the federation 24 huors a day
,
" she reminds us
. her fealty to her hobby approaches that ofthe a religious faith
. along with the laugher the show evokes
, there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people witht such loyalty
.
and their infectious joy provokes a ceratin envy of their enjoyment
. few other avocations could give tihs much satisfaction
. these people are haveing the time of their lives
.
( forthe the record
, i ' m not a star trek fan
although i have seen some of the movies
.
) the film interviews the various star trek series ' s stars as well as its fans
. the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark
and would soon fade
,
but over twenty years later
, the conventions are still going strong
. filled with anecdotes
, hte show talks about the happenings at the various conventions
. at one
, the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel
. affter appearing briefly
, he drank some water
and left
. they decided to auction off his half
- empty glass
, joking that it had the
" q virus
.
" the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water
and screamed to thte crowd thyat he now had tje q virus too
. with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity
. not jsut flitting among people
, hte documentary takes the time to let yuo get tothe know the trekkies
. one guy isnt a trekkie cross
- dresser
, another dresses her cat
,
and
then there is the dentist
. the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek setted
. he
, his oral hygienists
, his receptionist
, his wife
,
and his kids wear the outfits all of the time
. it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home
,
but not his family
. forthe variety
, he
and his family do change characters from time to time
. he says his patients like it
. well
, there was this one complainer
,
but he had a problem with his bill anyway
. there are summer schools for klingon with ph
. d
. linguists to teach the language
. hamlet is now available in klingon
, albiet perhaps not at your local bookstore
,
and they are working on translating the bible
. they even sell united federation passports that are rela enought thyat trekkies have used them to fool customs
, even u
. s
. customs
. the movie bogs down onyl briefly when it tries tothe argue tjhe series ' s larger meaning about diversity
and humanitarian concerns
. sandwiched in
- between the levity
, the switch in tone doesn ' t work
. the incessantly up
- beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator
. he fits right in
. trekkies runs a breezy 1
: 26
. it is not rated
bu would be pg for brief sexual references
and would be fine for all ages
