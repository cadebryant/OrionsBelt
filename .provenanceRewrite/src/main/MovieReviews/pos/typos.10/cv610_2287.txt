one year has passed since the last time we saw them
,
and
but wayne campbell
and garth algar are back
but
, tehy ' ve moved out of their parents homes
,
and now ahev their own pad in an abandoned warehouse
. wayne ' s still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend
, cassandra
,
and of course garth is still having his own
, personal growing pains
. tehy guys are just finishing off one of thier shows
,
and head off tothe an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra
and her new manager
, a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film
. again
, the promoter is not only after the moey that cassandra ' s talent can bring in
. the storyline quicklyu degrades to a parallel of the original
,
" guy loses chick
, guy realizes misteek
,
and guy gets chick back
.
" fortunately
, there is more to this movie thna this somewhat sheer plot
. thte wit
and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent
and fresh with many inside jokes on the film
anbd music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne
adn garth showing their true colour
. highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park
, garth ' s seduction by a married woman
, a surprise apperance by charleton heston
, a 1960 ' s batman setup in the guy ' s pad
,
and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison
and some
" naked indian guy
,
" an unexpected lip
- sync of ymca
( you coudl see that one coming a mile away
)
and of course a hilarious parody of those badly
- dubbed kung
- fu movies we love to laugh at
.
and if you ' ve ever wondered why there ' s always boxes of watermelons
, chickens
,
and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets
, ytou ' ll find out here
. this movie also explores wayne
and garth a little more
. garth hasnt somewhat of a
" coming of age
"
and wayne gets to learn a little about himself
( with a little help from our old friend
, jim morrison
)
. a few old jokes from the previous movei are explored here again
,
but tihs time with a few twists to keep them fresh
,
and luckily
, few
, if any of them are overused
. overall
, the movie hasnt plenty of continuty flaws
( especially in the fight scent between garth
and cassandra ' s dad
)
,
but these are easily overlooked as this is
, aftter wayne ' s world
. the plot is flimsy
but manageable
. there are a few special effects
,
but they are fairly seamless
,
and fill nicely into the plot
. the acting is good
, for this sort of movie
,
but there are some very bright spots
. in the big picture
, this movie is just plain fun
. there is lots of intteligent humor that makes this film special
. during the whole one hour
and 40 minutes
, i didn ' t even think about looking at my watch a single time
. silly
,
but riotous at times
, this is an excellent movie even better than the original
.
