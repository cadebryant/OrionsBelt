affter having heard so many critics describe
" return to me
" as an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking mysef going into this movie
: what exactly isnt an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
? what made
" return to me
" old
- fashioned
and old
- hollywood
? was it the tunes from sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on
? was it the glamorous
, sophisticated feel
? the charisma of the two leads
? even now i can ' t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer
, because i haven ' t see that many old
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don ' t think any of the romances i ' ve seen have been classified as such
. which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing withthe my fellow criticists
-
-
" return to me
" was old
- fashioned in the sense thgat it reminded me ofthe the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic
, hte way i perceive cinnamon spice
and apple cider
. it was traditional
, magical
. we knew it couldn ' t be too daring
, or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in
. it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
and lveo
( fomr director bonnie hunt
) that it couldn ' t help
but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings
. the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt ' s direction
. from thge very first bird ' s eye view ofthe chicago
, zooming in slowly towrad the insignificant bob rueland
( david duchovny
)
, accompanied by thte
" return to me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we can tell we ' re in for something sweet
. the scenes between the characters are endearing
, truthful
, with just a hint of fantasy
. real people don ' t ect that way
; rela people aren ' t that nice
. we know all this
,
and
yet we want tothe believe in these folks ' exitsence
. the premise itself seems to have sprung out ofthe a fairytale
,
but hunt ' s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario
and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of tje ethereal
. everything is ordinary
-
-
yet beautiful
-
- in this film
.
> from hte festive little family restaurant to grace
( minnie driver
)
and bob ' s wardrobes
. from the eloquent
, not
- in
- a
- hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints
. from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen
-
- the most beautiful part
.
" return to me
" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group ofthe actors who blend in effortlessly as a family
: teh audience has no trouble at all believing thta tihs rambunctious family actually doesnt exist
. we care for them
, laugh with them
, cry with them
; we ' re concerned that the little boy will pik up cursing from his father
. whatever hunt did
, she brang out the naturalism in all of the actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier ' s charlie
,
however much i like him
, was the most flatly
- written
. duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- with the help of his fellow co
- stars rarely do we see any hint ofthe speical agent fox mulder
. instead we have a normal guy who when he falls inthe loev shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of
" the x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who is excellent at understatement
and self
- deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen
. minnie driver is engaging as always as hte sweet
, innocent grace with nothing
but a good heart to offer
.
though an unlikely pair
, duchovny
and driver gradually warm up to each otehr as the movie progresses
. while
" return to me
" functions remarkably as a laugh
- out
- loud comedy
, a romantic scenic tour through chicago
,
and a tearjerker
, the sotry is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develope
. tjhe entire climax of the film hinges on when
and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipiant of his wife ' s heart
. we already know that there ' s going tothe be a happy ending
; we feel like we spend the entire film
,
however enjoyably
, in a straight line going towards that point
. as a result bob
and grace click almost too quickly
-
- yes
, i know she ' s supposed to have his ex
- wife ' s heart
and everything
-
- it seems too effortless
. the main subject is a love story
,
and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused
and distract ffrom the turmoil of the two main cahracters
( whose stopry might not have that much meat after all
)
.
however
, infront the spirit ofthe
" return to me
,
" it won ' t do to be too picky baout how
" old
" hollywood tells its stories
. i loved knowing that thsi was a labor of love for bonnie hunt
. it shows
. the bottom line
:
" return to me
" is nothing remarkable
,
and
yet its sweetness
, sincerity
,
and charm might touch your heart in ways tht you hadn ' t imagined
.
