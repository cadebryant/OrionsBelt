i have to say it
. tim burton ' s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys
. ok
, that ' s off my chest
. no more monkey puns
, i promise
. seriously
,
though
, planet of the apes is one rip
- roarin ' summer outing
, filled whith thrills
, action
, adventure
, wit
and bits of funny
( dare i say
, monkey
) business
. i know
, i know
, i promised
.
and for those film buffs who are fond of the original
, burton ' s version includes a couple tips of the hat tothe that movie
. mark wahlberg stars as capt
. leo davidson
, a deepo
- space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field
and hurled into the future
. he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species
and humans are hunted
, captured
and sold into slavery
. despite being darker than the orginial
, burton ' s film is nto as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious
. smoe of the movie ' s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typicaly burton
: an organ
- grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape tkaing off a wig
and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed
.
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter
. teh seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty
:
" one thing you don ' t want in your house is a human teen
- ager
,
" he syas
. you don ' t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement
. touches such as these are what stamps this movei with burton ' s brand
. lines that hearken bakc tothe the original movie are sprinkled throughout
: the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness
and grabs yhe simian ' s foot to try righting himself are
:
" tkae your stinking hand off of me
, you damned
, dirty human
.
" anyone familiar with the first version of the film will
, of course
, recognize thge irony in that piece of dialogue
. another of burton ' s in
- jokes is to have charlton heston
, star of the original
, play the chimpanzee father of tim roth ' s gen
. thade
. the young chimp goes to visit his dying father
. both have one thing in common
, a hatred of humans
. with his dying breath
, the elder spews out his vile
:
" damn them
, damn them all to hell
,
" he says before expiring
. that is the famous line heston ' s taylor shouted at tyhe conclusion of the original after discovering the planet ' s terrible secret
. the performances throughout are top
- notch
. wahlberg plays davidson nto as some gung
- ho hero
,
but as a confused
and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return hmeo
. he is reluctant to lead thge human rebellion
; his only objective being tothe find a way off this upside
- down planet
. this hesitation is what makes his character believable
and vulnerable
. roth is ferocious
, cunning
, cruel
and savage as the facist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity
. he leaps
and bounds as if he had springs on his feet
. it is a masterful turn
. helena bonham carter is ari
, the chimp who believes thta apes
and humans cxan live in peace
and as equals
. heres is a smart
, compassionate characterization
. michael clarke duncan is big
and brutal as attar the gerilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken
. a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo
, hte ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures
. as the battle between apes
and humans looms
, the cowardly limbo pleads
,
" cin ' t we all just get along
,
" echoing the words of rodney king
. much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton ' s technical crew
, especially production designer rick heinrichs
and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup
. burton ' s musical collaborator
, danny elfman
, provides another fine score
,
though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow
. the movie ' s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries tothe outshock the finale fomr the 1968 original
. he comes close
,
but falls short
. otherwise
, planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be
: an amusement park ride filled with lots ofthe action
, stunts
and a few laughs
. htis is oney feature in which teh expectations lived up to the pre
- release hype
.
