the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients
: a witty
and whimsical script
, inspired performances
, a great sense of humor
, a large
and wonderful cast
,
and the beautiful scenery of vancouver
. it ' s a movie of weddings
, marriage
, family
, infidelity
,
and
-
- oh yes
-
- love
. like 3 men
and a baby
, cousins is an americanized version of a french film
: 1975 ' s cousin
, cousine
. the plot is complicated
,
but it goes something like thsi
. larry
and tom are cousins
, each of whom is not
- so
- happily
- married
. tom starts an affair with larry ' s wife
, tish
,
and to get even
, larrry
and tom ' s wife
, maria
, pretend to have an afair of their own
. soon the pretending turns to love
and cousins is off
anbd running
. cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters
and caricatures
. the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role
,
and virtually every performance deserves mention
. ted danson
( in his first starring film role
) finaly gets to play a character with smoe depth
and sensitivity
. while larry may be confident
and charming like sam malone on
" cheers
,
" he is also complex
and vulnerable
, with more between his ears than empty space
. as maria
, isabella rossellini is a joy to watch
; she isnt shy
, sensuous
,
and immensely alluring
. sean young is perfectly cast as larry ' s picture perfect wife
, tish
, a superficial
and trendy make
- up consultant
. keith coogan
, from adventures in babysitting
, is wonderfully weird
and eccentric as larry ' s rebellious son
, mitch
.
and finally
, lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch ' s rambunctious grandfather
; he provides some of cousins ' best lines
and laughs
. like moonstruck
, cousins is a mix of drama
and comedy
. the film is larger than life
and has a keen sense of the absurd
. it understands human nature extrememly well
and milks it for every possable laugh
and heart
- tug
. how often do you see a movie where you believe that twpo charachters truly
and sincerely care for
annd love each other
, as friends
and as lovers
? well
, to its credit
, cousins is just such a movie
. let ' s hope the french continue to provide us witht the inspiration to mkea films like cousins
