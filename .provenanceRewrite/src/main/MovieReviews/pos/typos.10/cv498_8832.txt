this summer
, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham ' s series
, a time to kill
, was made inot a major motion picture
. onthe january 3 of this year
, director rob reiner basically re
- released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi
. based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars ' assassination
, ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25
- year legal battle faced by myrlie evars
( whoopi goldberg
, sister act
)
and her quest tothe have her husband ' s obvious assassin
and racist byron de la beckwith
( james woods
, casino
) jailed
. so she turns to assistant district attorney
and prosecutor bobby delaughter
( alec baldwin
, heaven ' s prisoners
) to imprison tyhe former kkk member
. ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage ofthe images from african
- american history
, ffrom slave
- ship miseries to life in the racist south ofthe tyhe 1960 ' s
.
but all too soon
, the white folks tkae over
, intoning lines like
" what ' s america got to do with anything
? this is mississippi
!
" as beckwith
, james woods
, with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man
, teeters between portraying evil
and its character
. meanwhile
, goldberg turns in a very serious
and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn ' t let her husband ' s death rest until she got the conviction
. both deserve serious oscar
- consideration
. thsi brings us tothe the dull performance of baldwin
. let ' s face it
, trying to match matthew mcconaughey ' s wonderful acting inaddition a time to kill is basically impossible
.
and baldwin is living proof of this
, as no emotions coudl be feeled
. it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear
. either poor acting or poor directing
,
but something definitely went wrong
. another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg ' s facial features didn ' t change
, as she looked the same iin the courtroom as she did holding her husband ' s dead body 25
- years earlier
.
yet woods ' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg ' s father
. at least thge make
- up was realistic
. with some emotional moments in yhe poorly written script
, ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart
, when its predecessor
, a time to kill
, brought tears to everyone ' s eyes
. don ' t get me wrong
, the movie wasn ' t all tht bad
,
but if you ' ve seen grisham ' s masterpiece
,
hten don ' t expect this one to be an excellent film
.
