everyone knows someone liek giles de ' ath
: stuffy
, arrogant
, set infact his ways
,
and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with
" progress
.
" giles is a writer
,
but the product ofthe his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis
. his house looks like an immaculate museum
? with no television
, microwave
, word processor
, or other technological gadgets
, only the electric lights betray that he ' s living in the twentieth century
, not the nineteenth
. this is the kind of role thgat could easily be turned into a flat stereotype
,
but john hurt
, infront what is certainly his best performance in a decade
and possibly the most impressive of his long
and distinguished career
, turns
" erstwhile fogy
" giles into a three
- dimensional human being
. despite his tunnel vision
, it ' s impossible not to like the man
, especially after his entire being is tranformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune
: lveo
.
and
, as giles discovers during the course of this amusing
, warm
- hearted motion picture
, it ' s possible to find the object of one ' s affection in the most unusual places
. giles
, who is a widower
and a recluse
, does not frequent the cinema
,
but when he learns tht an e
. m
. forster film is playing at the local theater
, he screws up his courage
and decides to go
. what he doesn ' t realize is that the movie house is showing two films
: teh forster adaptation
anbd a teen exploitation flick called hotpants coleeg ii
. a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male
and female bodies in various states of undress
. just as giles is about to leave
,
however
, he notices ronnie bostock
( jason priestley
)
,
and
, suddenly
, it ' s love at first sight
. giles is enraptured
,
and the moment hotpants college ii is over
, he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia
, including teen magazines
and video tapes
.
( in order to watch those tapes
, giles must buy a vcr
,
but he initially doesn ' t realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr
.
) eventually
, not satisfied with being the world ' s foremost authority on bostock
, giles boards a plane
and travels to long island
, where his idol ' s home is located
. bostock is away when giles arrives
,
but the wily englishman manages tothe befriend ronnie ' s supermodel girlfriend
, audrey
( fiona loewi
)
. eventually
, the actor arrives home
and
, impressed wiht giles ' demeanor
and intelliegnce
, he begins to rely on tghe older man ' s advice
.
but
, while giles ' affection runs deep
, ronnie ' s feelings are less constant
. love
and death on long island is a comedy
,
and a very funny one at that
. in fact
, for its first half
, the film is nearly
- perfect
. it suffers a fall
- off once giles reaches new york
,
and the ending
, with its none
- too
- subtle homosexual overtones
, is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it
. in his gently satirical approach to populer culture
and movie stardom
, writer
/ directer richard kwietniowski
, adapting from tyhe novel by gilbert adair
, is 100
% on
- target
. inaddition the process
, he not only creates a truly likable
and memorable character in giles
,
but says a fewd thigsn about the transforming power of loev
, even if it is unrequited
. from start tothe finish
, this is clearly hurt ' s movie
? he ' s inthe almost every frame
. it ' s a role thast tje veteran actor must have relished
, because he makse giles an unforgettable motion picture figure
,
and does so by means of dialogue delivery
, body language
,
and ever
- changing facial expressions
. jason priestley
, cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image
, is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie
. he is charismatic
,
and it ' s not hard tothe understand why giles is attracted to ronnie
. meanwhile
, solid support isnt provided by hte appealing fiona loewi
and the always
- reliable maury chaykin
. lvoe
and death on long island is many things wrapped into one
: a social commentary
( it tackles thge thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment
)
, a buddy picture
/ love story
( ronnie
and giles have noe of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days
)
,
and a
" fish out of water
" tale
( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world
)
.
yet
, despite the many laughs lvoe
and death offers
, it never takes cheap shots
. it has a vibrant
, beating heart
?
and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile
.
