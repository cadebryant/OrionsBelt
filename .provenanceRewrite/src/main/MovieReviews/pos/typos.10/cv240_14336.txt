" rounders
" is exactly the kind of movie parents don ' t want their kids to see
. it ' s not that it ' s a drunken orgy ofthe sex
and violence
,
but beccause it ' s a film that flat
- outloud says you can make a career out ofthe gambling
.
annd to take make things
" worse
" it proves this through its original
, fascinating story
. there have been countless crime films both past
and present that evoke the
" noir
" mood
, that isnt
, the dark
, shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life
. this film starts off in the tradiational noir style
, introducing us tothe the underworld of modern gambling where tghe stakes are high
and so is the price for losing
. matt damon stars as mike mcdermott
, a 20
- something law student in present
- day new york city who tells us how the gae of poker is really played
. damon narrates throughout the film
,
but the entire opening scene is voiced
- over so perfectly to completely
and totally define the setting
. mike ' s about tothe go up against teddy kgb
( malkovich
)
, a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer
.
but
then again
, he practically is one
and the film does everything to convey that sense
- tje look in his eyes
, his slow movements
, his intricate mannerisms
- all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld
( literally
)
. damon infront the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes
and perfectly
- groomed features
,
but his narration is what brings it all together
. he never sounds like he ' s reading from a script
, nor that he ' s trying to embellish anytying
, it just comes natural to him
. the screenwriters use the right words
and phrases to decribe the mood
, from the smell of the air
, to the logic involved in reading teh otehr guys ' faces
and cards
,
and all without sounding remotely trite
. immediately we get the sense that poker isn ' t forthe gamblers
,
but for near
- geniuses withthe nerves of steel
. the game is a quiet war
, with strategies just as complex
and the same sense of honor among the soldiers
. the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car
,
but when it comes to the game of poker
, all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man
. the film does an exelent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first ect
. it concentrates so much in this aspect thast the background
and the progression of the story stumble a bit
. we learn only a little about mike
, both past
and present
. presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo
( gretchen mol
) who he constantly argues with over his gambling
. tehy go thru a few break
- up
/ make
- up cycles until mike ' s childhood pal
anbd fellow rounder
" worm
"
( norton
) is released from prison
. it ' s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to thte mob
,
but what is surprising is how the film is able tothe take such a predictable element
and excecute it teh way it does
. technically
, the plot isn ' t unlike many children ' s sitcoms in which the
" good
" kid ' s
" bad
" friend gets the good kid in trouble
and
yot the good kid remains friends with the bad kid
. what this film does is use a diferrent medium tothe tell that story
. mike
and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives
,
but both share a passion for out
- thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them
. where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating
( hence his jail time
)
, mike always takes the cards he ' s dealt
and works wih them
. sometimes they pay off
( i
. e
. his ability to pay his way through law skool on his gambling money
)
,
but other times they don ' t
( i
. e
. the fact he takes himself out of the game
and works a steady job after dropping
$ 30
, 000 on a single hand
)
. once things start happening tghe film is able to expand
and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail
and mood
. mike
adn worm bob
and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places
, from socialites ' mansions
, to taking the tourists at atlantic city
, to outwitting tjhe gangsters thgat control it all
. everyting they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything ' s a battle against the cards destiny deals
. one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge
( martin landou
, in a perfectly casted
and performed role
) that destiny is everything
and
yet nothing at the smae time
. matt ' s good at gambling
but he ' s also got potential tothe be a great lawyer
. he could go professional as either
,
but with one he could lose everything or win big
,
but withthe the other there ' s stability
but not much risk involved
. can someone who ' s gambled his entire life realyl cash in his chips
and leave
? if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker
- playing
,
then the ending isnt our test
. everything isnt told from mike ' s perspective
,
but we ' re fianlly able to recogize some things on our own
. thsi makes the final
, against
- all
- odds showdown seem like just that
. it works just like the game it revolves around
- showing us some ofthe the cards
,
but still evokes the element of the unknown
,
and the consequences thereof
. what separates
" rounders
" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge
and the skills are more important than winning in the end
.
