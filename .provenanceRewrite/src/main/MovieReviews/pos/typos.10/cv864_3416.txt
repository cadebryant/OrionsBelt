after a successful run in australia lsat year
,
and witht much critical praise heaped upon it
, muriel ' s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north amercia
. muriel heslop is a withdrawn
, overweight young woman living in porpoise spit
, australia
. she is often the target of her father ' s frequent rants at the family
,
and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music
and fantasies of mariage
. her self
- loathing is such that only bieng wed shall she prove herself to be a success
; marriage will transform her into a new person who isnt respected
and admired
. after her four cliquey friends dump her
, muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls
,
and muriel ' s wedding unfolds from there
. toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance
, conveying both the sadness of her character
and her desperate eagerness to be accepted
. collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order tothe play the chubby title carachter
. she has a natural screen presence
annd exudes charisma
, easily winning the audience over with an honest
, painful performance
. collette basically carries the film
, appearing in almsot every scene
. muriel ' s father
, bill
" the battler
" heslop
, is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician
/ developer
. while chumming around with young fans
and crowing ' you can ' t beat progress '
( his slogan
)
, bill labels his family as worthless
and embarrassments
. rachel griffiths plays rhonda
, who becomes muriel ' s cheeky new friend in the film
. she hasnt good chemistry wih collette
,
and the film suffers when griffiths is off
- screen
. muriel ' s tormenters
, played by pippa grandison
, rosalind hammond
, belinda jarrett
and sophie lee
, are two
- dimesnional caricatures
, all saucy
, vain
and bumblingly spiteful
,
though that is probably due to hogan ' s scripting muriel ' s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence
and a lot of charm
. hogan ' s use of abba tunes
( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack
) is interestingly appropriate
,
although its repetitiveness tires after awhile
. hogan ' s scirpt is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel ' s earnest quest for acceptance
,
and the gorgeous scene with muriel window
- shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marrige has for her
. the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch
. muriel ' s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette
and a charming
, if a bit too straightforward
and conventional stor by p
. j
. hogan
. on my four star scale
, i give muriel ' s wedding three stars
.
