cinema hasnt been around for about a hundred years now
.
? it ' s not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film
,
but i ' d like to thikn that i ' m begginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time
. recently
, i ' ve seen the films of hitchcock
, capra
, fellini
, godard
, kurosawa
, chaplin
, lang
,
and many others
.
? those men were talented artists
,
and thier films refect their genius
.
? they are likely to be remembered for
.
.
. well
, qtuie a while
.
? i like htis film
, too
.
? yes
, it ' s a disaster
- slash
- action movie
.
? true
, its budget is a lot more money than i ' ll ever see in my lifetime
.
?
and there ' s not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money
.
? in fact
, i bet the producers ofthe armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film
, had they thougth it would ' ve been more profitable
. i certainly don ' t care what their intentions were
, because michael bay
( the rock
) is such a skilled director that i doubt he ' d ever make a film that is difficult to sit through
. of course
, skillful direction doesn ' t complete the package
,
but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together
. the stry is well
- thought out
(
and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences tht never feel out of palce
)
, the acting is terrific
, the script is sharp
,
and
-
- get this
-
- there are characters
. yes
, yuo read that right
. armageddon actually has characters you cin care about
! if you don ' t like this film
,
then you have a problem with the genre itself
: armageddon is as good as a film like this can be
. if you ' ve seen deepo inpact
,
then you know the basic framework for the story
. it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas isnt going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film
. so
, it ' s up to the u
. s
. government to stop it
.
( why the u
. s
. is allways exculsivly saddled with these problems is never fully investigated
.
) their plan
-
- to send a group of experienced oil drillers uv to the asteroid
, drill down several hundred feet
,
and detonate a nucular warhead within
. the head driller is harry stamper
( bruce willis
)
. his group of men is a colorful bunch
, including a
. j
.
( ben affleck
)
, chick
( iwll patton
)
,
and rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
. there ' s also an interesting traingle formed between a
. j
.
, harry
,
and grace
( liv tyler
)
, who is harry ' s daughter
. a
. j
.
and grace are
, of course
, romantically intertwined
,
and dad isn ' t too happy with the situation
. it ' s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it isnt you ' d like to call armageddon
. it ' s not baout story
-
- it ' s about viscera
and action
,
and thrills
- a
- minute
,
and all that stuff
. it ' s incidental
, really
, that the story is cohesive
and even remotely believable
, because most peple will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds ' thought to what actually happens
.
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case
, for he hasnt made a film so intertaining
anbd so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better
. i think most of the budget went tothe cameras alone
, becuase bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles
. take the spectauclar opening scene
, for instance
, in which a meteor shower obliterates new york
. a meteor flies out of the sky
and crashes inot a building
, which sends fireballs erupting into the air
and cars spinning liuke tops upon other cars
. the action itself might tkae five seconds inthe real life
,
but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways
. i like his quick
- edit style
, because it ' s abrasive
and exhausting to watch
. it ' s also very loud
,
and obnoxiously noisy at times
.
but it ' s fun to be obnoxious somtimes
. the special effects in this film put eveyr other 1998 blockbuster to shame
. deep impact
, visually
, has absolutely nothing on armageddon
,
and to offer a comparison beween the quality of this film
and godzilla is simply laughable
. special effects are very important in a film liek this
: if they ' re not good
,
hten the image is not convincing
,
and the film doesn ' t wrok
. everything here looks bright
adn explosive
-
- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers
, all the way to tje shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid
. the effects that don ' t look totally real are still a pleasure to behold
,
and i credit everyone involved forthe creating the first blockbuster so nice
- looking that it actually qualifies as art
. of course
, all of this would add up to little more than an above
- average light sohw
, if i didn ' t get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action
. the film is two
and a half hours long
,
and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action
. much of teh film is dedicated to developing the various characters ' subplots
. i won ' t suggest that these are complex charactors
,
but their problems are real
,
and the emotions aren ' t put forth in a sentimental
annd overbearing way
. in fact
, there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up
,
and that ' s a lot more than i can sday baout deep inpact
, which was banking on yhe fiel
- good parts of its story
. bruce willis is terrific
,
and i ' m glad tothe see him bigger than life again
( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing
)
. tyler
and affleck are great together
,
and make a convincing couple
-
- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level
. patton
, who is a magnificent actor
, thankfully is not wasted here
,
and the minor subplot revolving around his ex
- wife
and son is very moving
. the comic relief from buscemi
and peter stormare
( who plays a crazy russian astronaut
) is nifty
,
and keeps the film lively
and funny
. i wasn ' t challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon
,
and i don ' t mind too much
.
but the film doesn ' t insult my intelligence
-
- it ' s pitched perfectly tothe entertain
, which is what all it really wants to dont
. it ' s not mindless
and escapist
,
bu well
- crafted cinema
. it might hvea been created forthe the wrong reasons
,
but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me thast they are interested in making something good
, in spite of the producers
and the budget
. i ' m not saying that films like this are risky moves
. what i am saying is that armageddon is a big
, loud
, expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms
.
