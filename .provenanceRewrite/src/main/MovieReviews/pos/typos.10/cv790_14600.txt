-
- this movie had us in non
- stpo stitches from beginning to end
. all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie
. if you thought they were funny
, see the rest of the movie
. it ' s hilarious
. how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim tothe fame is synchronized head
- bopping on snl to exactly one song
? easy
. write an interesting scirpt around tried
-
and
- true ideas
, add some good lines
and satire
,
and voil
?
, you end up wih an excellent
, well
- done
, very entertaining flick
. will
and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business durig the day
. at night they pursue their life
- long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills
, ca
, the only disco act worth going to
. the only problem
, the place is so popular
and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door
, the roxbury closes
, all the while bearing wittness to guys with one
- hundred
- dollar bills
adn movie stars like richard grieco who get past thge doorman without fuss
. the script authors
( steve koren
, will ferrell
and chris kattan
) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury
. their flower
- shop van is rear
- ended by richard grieco
, who fears a law
- suit
and isnt surprised to see the idiots are too star
- struck to think about the car accident they jstu hadnt
,
but not about getting into the roxbury
. grieco happily takes them in
, even introduces them to the owner
, which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearence of the idiot brothers in teh eyes of a couple of gold diggers
( elisa donovan
anbd gigi rice
) who bet their time
and bodies on will
and chris
. what follows are smoe ofthe hte best slap
- stick dancing routines ever
. the music is superb
,
and coudl have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez ' s born to be alive
. the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by
, for example
, the bee gees
and their stayin ' alive
. it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back
,
adn the technique is a clever adaptation thgat worked well in forest gump
. one of the funniest scenes is when thte gold diggers discover that will
and chris don ' t have any mone y
,
and dump both on the spot
, even expressing violence
anbd anger tath they gavey sex away
. an art
- imitates
- life poke at shallow womens
. it ' s a scene that ' s an approximate parody of the vinegar ' s own rolf luedeke ' s editorial this week national organization for men
( nom
) replaces now
. ted
" unabomber
" kaczynski
, hismelf rejected for not having money
, will idenify well with this scene
, if he ever watchs the movei
. of course
, the script wouldn ' t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon
, the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids
,
and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good
- looking disco blondes
( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby
)
. nevertheless
, will ' s father wnats him to marry molly anyway
,
but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way
and sends him into guest
- quarter exile
. during the wedding ceremony
, will ' s heart isn ' t exactly into getting married
,
and when his brother appears on the balcony iwth a ghetto blaster
and more head
- bopping music
, iwll thinks worse of the knot
- tieing idae
and runs to chris
. definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the curch balcony
. i found this scene a riot
,
however
, it went over brandi ' s head
-
- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared
. the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries
, instade
, the step
- in buddy
/ weight
- lifter
( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy
)
anbd who has beeen lusting for a ogod
- looker for a long time
,
but ready now to take anyone
. more art
- imitates
- life stuff
-
- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world
. the idiots ' mother is played by loni anderson
, whose barbie
- doll looks don ' t play well anymore
( she ' s a bit old
)
,
adn whose cleavage looks liek someone botched a tracheotomy too low down
. i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in need of a lot of laughs
. go with a date
. brandi laughed non
- stop
, as i did
,
annd a deaf
- mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 mintues
.
