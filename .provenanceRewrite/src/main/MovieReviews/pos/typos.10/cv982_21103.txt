i rented this movie with very high hopes
. tihs movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998
,
and unfortunately
, was not as good as i hoped
,
but was still very intriguing
and thought provoking
. first of all
, the casting for this film is great
. tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood
. they play their roles as the parker brother
and sister perfectly
. with a plot as unbelievable as this film
, you need chemistry
and honest acting from your cast
. tobey
and reese
( bud
and mary sue parker
) play their roles perfectly
and display their charactors with honesty
and believability
. william h
. macy
, an actor i have grown to love over the past year
, turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife
, a
" colored
" person
and his friends
, the
" non
- colored
" ones
. he also displays believability
annd must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife
. he does this perfectly
and
yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors inspite hollywood
. joan allen is equally great as betty parker
, the ideal tv mom
. her character is the most ambitious
. she is very na
? ve
,
and must display this well to make her character believable
and she does just that
. her lack of chemistry with macy
, which the role calls for
,
and her developped chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific
,
and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest ofthe the cast
,
then this film would even been even better
. as said before
, jeff daniels gives a bad performance
. his character displays the change going on throughout the town
,
yet he does not display it with enough conviction
. his charcter is vrey confusing
and he isnt nto very believable
. this film could have been elevated to a wohle new level had daniels been able to give a better performance
. the movie is very provocative
. it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past
and that still exist today
. i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought uv
,
but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing
. they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch
,
but dont it in a slow pace
. the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length
. some films are not meant to be that long
. pleasantville is one of those films
. this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it
. firt
, they are amazed by the implementation of color
.
thne they want to have it
.
then they do not want tothe
.
then the war ensues between the colored
and non
- colored
. this isnt all strung out over two hours
, which wass way too long
. some movies need a lot of time
. saveing private ryan was a little bit under three hours long
and i thought it coudl have used more time
. this film is only two hours long
,
and seems much longer
. length is everything in films
. if you can nail down the perfect timing
anbd pace
, ytou can win half the battle
. pleasantville cin move at a good pace at times
,
but it is not consistant enough
. overall
, pleasantville is a very pleasant
and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days
. i went inthe expecting a light
- hearted film about change
. i left learning an importamt lesson about racism
and the way things change
. luckily
, pleasantville teaches this lesson infact such a way tothe amke it appeal to all audiences
. only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time
.
