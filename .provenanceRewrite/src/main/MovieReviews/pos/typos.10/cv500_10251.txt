losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing
. reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare
. hwile we all might feel the desire to blow someone ' s head off wtih a shotgun when they don ' t seem to grasp our point of view
, actually threatning them with one isnt usually something we avoid
. this isn ' t the case with sam baily
- john travolta ' s slightly askew average
- joe persona in mad city
.
" i don ' t think people listen to guys like me
,
" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls ofthe a museum
. just a few days ago
, sam was a guard at this same museum
,
but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security postion
, sam ' s apprehension resulted in a brash decision
. in an effort to git his ex
- boss
, museum directer mrs
. banks
( blythe danner
)
, to
" just listen
"
, he barges into thge museum one day equiped with a fully loaded shotgun
, taking the uncooperative banks
and a group of school children hostage
. sam ' s overall concern is valid enough
- if he loses his job
, his paycheck
, his benifits
, etc
.
, his wife
and two children won ' t be provided for
. he ' s not a lunatic or a hot
- tempered madman
, he ' s somewhat like a child
- panicky
, compulsive
,
and running on emotion
-
and his naive intentions aren ' t helpped any by the fact that banks wasn ' t overly compassionate with the let go
. overall
, he ' s just like you
and me
- except that he has the capacity to view the line we ' d deem
" far enough
" as the starting mark of some crazy race
. meanwhile
, television repertwar max brackett
( dustin hoffman
) is also on the scene
. covering a
" fluff
" story for thge evening news concerning the museum cutbacks
, max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest
- breaking news story he ever could ' ve hoped for
. having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting
, max is anxious to turn tihs into his
,
and only his
, story
. max immediately bonds with sam
. max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations
and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone
. at first
, max ' s intentions don ' t stretch beyond high ratings
and a good boost to the ole pride factor
,
but as he gets to know sam omre personally
, he begins to sympathize
and even become somewhat of an advocate for him
. the media
,
however
, is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill
. the accidental shooting ofthe ex
- co
- worker cliff
( bill nunn
)
, a black security guard
, becomes one of the main factors in tje controversy over sam ' s honest ambitions
. also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts
, head of the news department of the staion max falls directly under
,
and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander
, who uses his network power tothe try
and outshine max
. alda
annd prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities
.
then there is mia kirshner
, who plays tyhe young tv station intern laurie
. she falls under max ' s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting
. kirshner ' s credits are relatively small for now
, including roles inthe films like exotica
and the forgettable sequal to the crow
. still
, kirshner ' s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl
annd kinda
- bitchy
- in
- a
- reserved
- way roles
. i wouldn ' t mind seing her in some more prevalent parts
, where perhaps her talent wiull be able to blossom more fully onscreen
. while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy
, self
- righteous monster has indeed been tackled before
, mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability
. hoffman
and travolta are both excellent actors
,
and seeing them together is a real treat
. htey both do a great job at smoothly
and naturaly becoming their characters
,
and they provide enough chemestry fo us to genuinely care for both
. there isnt quite a bit of humor infact this film
,
adn without it
, it could ' ve fallen into a drab
, cliched social statement more likely tothe garner sleep from the audience than applause
. this isn ' t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone
and your heart
,
but it wiull lightly touch both
, making for a recommendable movie
. if for nothing more than the oppertunity tothe watch both hoffman
and travolta at the same time
, i urge you to check htis one out
