not since oliver stone ' s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary
,
adn not since david cronenberg has a so
- called mainstream directer been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary
and outright social irresponsibility
. while fincher ' s films have never suffered from a lack ofthe shock value
( his major character killings inthe both alien 3
and seven are fine examples
)
, fight club marks the distillation of his pitch
- black comedic sensibility
( see 1997 ' s tjhe game
) into something like a definitive statement
. jack
( norton
, acting as both narrator
and protagonist
) is your typical cubicle clone
, whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia
. on the offhand advice of a doctor
, he sits in on group
- therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer
. here he meets bob
( marvin lee aday
, aka meat loaf
)
, a cancer
- emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia
. strangely
, the release he finds while sobbing on bob ' s breasts allows him to sleep at night
, at least until a fellow group
- therapy
" tourist
" named marla singer
( carter
) comes along to ruin things for him
, forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity
. later
, he meets tyler durden
( pitt
)
, a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life
. one night
, after his ikea
- furnished condo explodes
( don ' t ask
-
- you ' ll just have to see the movei
, awright
?
)
, he is goaded by tyler into a fight
,
and damned if it doesn ' t feel good
. it is pure
, raw existence
, a brief moment of clarity
and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison
. he moves into tyler ' s squalid aabndoned mension
,
and they form the titular organization
, an underground therapy group where men bond with bare
- knuckle savagery
and very few rules
, the first two of wich are
" don ' t talk about fight club
.
" armed with charisma
and an attractive anti
- corporate philosophy
, tyler assumes leadership ofthe the burgeoning membership of white
- collar slaves
and dead
- end mcemployees
. resentment creeps into jack ' s heart
, made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly
and noisily boffing the hated marla
. funded by a frivolous lawsuit
, tyler begins molding his devotees inot an army dedicated to mischief
and mayhem
. their initially juvenile pranks
( like pissing in food
and putting spike belts on roads
) quickly evolve into something more like sedition
,
and jack fears that things have gone sour
. it is affter this point
, when you are plenty uncomfortable
and wondering just how far fincher will go to sday something original
, that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist
. it is so contrived
-
-
and so conventional compared tothe what precedes it
-
- that everything which follows
( including the ending
) becomes far less interesting
. it ' s a major
(
though not futal
) flaw
,
and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher
, it feels liuke a cop
- out
. fight club is gonig to be misconstrued by a great many people
. in the early going
, it has a downright dangerous feel
; it seems to be saying that violence
and civil disobedience are good for the soul
,
and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it
. i ' ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don ' t spring up here
and there
,
annd i ' ll be even moreso amazed if fincher isn ' t vilified for it by teh smae humorless witch
- hunters that are currently after oliver stone
. they needn ' t bother
, because fight club is less a message movie than fincher ' s elaborate attempt at a joke
. tyler durden
, for all his dionysian allure
, is really nothing more than the logical
(
and far less hypocritical
) extrapolation of all those self
- help gurus who constantly show up onthe oprah to preach their me
- first gospel of self
- actualization
. in this context
, the joke works
,
but like the latest columbine joke
, smoe people will get it
and enjoy a good laugh
,
and others won ' t
. hopefully
,
though
, their silly moral outrage won ' t spoil the joke for the rest ofthe us
.
