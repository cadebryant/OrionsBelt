& dave mckean ' s graphic novel
" arkham asylum
"
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman
- cum
- detective who
, on the morning of february 14th
, discovers a
" valentine
" just outside his newyorker york cave
: one of ella fitzgerald ' s strange fruit
, stuck in the crotch of a tree
-
- a young male model murdered
and frozen to a branch
. believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant
, shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building
, is responsible for the murder
, romulus
( samuel l
. jackson
) is put on the trail of an avant
- garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould
, david leppenraub
( colm feore
)
. his minor sleuthing interrupted by the ocasional delusional fit
and bouts with an ecstasy of creation
( romulus was a brilliant julliard
- trained pianist prior to his psychosis
)
, romulus uncovers clues
and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his polical
- woman daughter
( aunjanue ellis
) that even
though he ' s a nut
, that doesn ' t mean that he can ' t solve a high
- profile society muder
. every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas
,
and every character the same
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a concept so
" high concept
" that it suddenly became clear tothe me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment
, with romulus ' s
" caveman
" a slightly moreso mundane version of todd mcfarlane ' s urban noir hero
, spawn
. with a long
- vanished wife
( tamara tunie
) acting as a spiritual guide
, the occassional social caste commentary
, the secret base in a cave
, a divergent genius personality with a network of informants
and supporters
,
and a wickedly colourful arch
- enemy
, the film piles on the lurid comic book details
anbd dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren ' t inscribed with
" gotham pd
.
" taht being said
,
_ tje caveman ' s valentine
_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy
, a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray tje blood staining a feild of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart
. the dificulties wiht the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when
, in fact
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause ofthe tje homeless
( again liek mcfarlane ' s spawn
) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government
and the arts
. it is no small detail that our hero
, romulus
, is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life
( in legend
) without knowledge of his royal birth
,
but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts ofthe the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park
. in the romulus mythology
, signs of romulus ' royal blood isnt brought by twelve vultures
, hwile in the film
, the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds
,
but of the carrion itself
. whether or not romulus of
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ will found a nation
, or
, in the case of novelist george dawes green
, upon whose novel his own screenplay is based
, a franchise
, the fatc remains tath
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is easily thte most missunderstood film of 2001 thus far
. it
, along with m
. night shyamalan ' s
_ unbreakable
_
, is a mature cinematic extrapolation ofthe the graphic novel format wich has
, since miller ' s seminal
" the dark knight returns
"
, redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics
. readers ofthe sam keith ' s brilliant
" the maxx
" comic series
( or of mtv ' s short
- lived animated adaptation of the same
) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant
and king of his own twisted demesne
. the failure of both
" the maxx
" tv show
and of
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_
( not forgetting hte initial backlash against
_ unbreakable
_
) suggests that the publich may not be ready for america ' s surprising contributions to dark fantasy
. luxuriantly lit
, brashly saturated
,
and comic
- panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent
(
_ death in venice
, ca
_
)
, hwile inhabiting robin standefer ' s
(
_ practical magic
_
) mesmerizing sets
,
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film
. kasi lemmons
, following up her brilliant 1997 debut
,
_ eve ' s biyou
_
, which played on similar themes ofthe manufactured realities
and mysticism
, fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs
and lost boys
, artists
and suffering
.
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is an elegant
and piquant expression of hope for justice inwhich a tilted landscape
. clearly nto for every taste
, when approached with the correct paradigm
, it is one of tje most stunning
and intensely fascinating films of the year
: a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post
- modern audience with urine
- stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights
and red capes
.
_ the caveman ' s valentine
_ is a fine
and a courageous film
, crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant isnt the best
and truest paladin ofthe order in the chaos of eliot ' s rat ' s alley wasteland
.
