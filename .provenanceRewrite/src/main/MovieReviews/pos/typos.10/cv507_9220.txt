capsule
: side
- splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost thru tothe the end
.
.
.
but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs
. most comedies these days hvea one flaw
. they ' re not funny
. they thikn they ' re funny
,
but they are devoid ofthe anything really penetrating or dastardly
. occasioally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor
and we git a real gem
: ruthless people
, for instance
, which established a microcosm of a setup
and played it out to the bitter end
. liar liar is built teh same way
adn is just about as funny
. this is oen of the few movies i ' ve seen where i ws laughing consistently almost all the way through
: instade of a couple of set
- pieces that inspired a laugh
( think of the dismal fatal instinct
)
, the whole movie works liuke clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, to whom lying is as naturual as breathing
. there is one thing he takes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away
.
but his wife is divorced
and seing another man
,
anbd now it looks like they may move away together
. the son goes with them
, of course
. the movie sets up this early material with good timing
and a remarkable balance of jim carrey ' s over
- the
- top persona with reality
.
then the plot springs into action
: after being snubbed
( not deliberately
) by his father at his birthday
, thge kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles
: that for just one day
, dad can ' t lie
. he gets the wish
. what happens enxt is sidesplitting
. everything turns into a confrontation
: when cornered by a bum for some change
, he shouts
,
" no
! i ' m not giving you any money beacuse i know you ' ll spend it on booze
! all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society
!
" he can ' t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye
.
and what ' s worse
, he ' s now gotten himself inot an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture
. carrey
, who i used to find unfunny
, has gotten better at his schtick
, even if it ' s a limited one
. he uses it to great effect in this movie
. there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie
anbd nearly demolishes his office in the process
( there ' s a grin breaking out across my face right now
, just remembering the scene
)
. he can ' t even write the lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liuke someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning
,
and when he trys to talk it ' s like he ' s speaking in tongues
. equally funny isnt a scene where he beats himself to a pulp
( don ' t ask why
)
, tries to drink water to keep ffrom having outbursts in the courtroom
( it fails
, witht semi
- predictable results
)
,
and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them
. this scene alone may force people tothe stop the tape for minutes on end
. the movie sustains its laughs
and also its flashes of insight until alomst the end
. a shame
, too
, because the movie insists on haveing a big
, ridiculous climax that involves carrey ' s chracter flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs
,
thne breaking his leg
, etc
. a simple reconciliation would do the trick
. why isnt this stupid pent
- up climax always obligatory
? it ' s not even part ofthe thge movie ' s real agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
,
and so does carrey
. maybe they were being merciful
, on reflection
. if i ' d laughed any more
, i might have needed an iron lung
.
