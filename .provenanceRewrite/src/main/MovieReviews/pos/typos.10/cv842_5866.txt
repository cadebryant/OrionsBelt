if beavis
and butthead hadnt a favorite movie
, from dusk till dawn would probably be it
. scripted by quentin tarantino
and directed by robert rodriguez
( desperado
)
, the movie panders to the very worst in sex
and violence
-
-
and is incredibly fun to watch
. it starts off as a pulp fiction
- type crime story
, with criminal brothers george clooney
and tarantino robbing a convenience store
. because this is a tarantino movie
,
however
, it ' s not just a case of pull the gun
and take the loot
, it ' s a case of a hole being shooted through someone ' s hand
, a man on fire jumping out behind the counter
and thge entire store blowing up as tehy drive away
. the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movei
-
- everything overdone
and nothing as it seems
. clooney
and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel
and
then hijack an rv with a family in it
. harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex
- preacher
and juliette lewis his daughter
, whom registered sex
- pervert tarantino eyes endlessly
. you know you ' re mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive
,
although she ' s not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn
. the first half of the movie has the criminals
and hostages trying to get to
and through the mexico border
, clooney ' s startegy involving hiding in thge rv shower while lewis is on the toilet
. it doens its trick
; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself
and immediately goes blind
, never noticing clooney or tarantino
. once they git to mexico
, it ' s time tothe wait at the rendezous point
, a topless bar called titty twister where we ' re once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper
. finally
, after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots
and clooney forcing keitel
annd lewis to drink iwth him
, the stripper turns into a vampire
. soon half the people in the bar are vampires
and the other half fall or fight back
. that ' s right
, we ' ve come all this way to see a vampire movie
.
but like everything eles
, tarantino takes this age
- old genre
and twists it to his own ends to produce over
- thge
- top entertainment
. so we git wholy water condom balloons
, heads rolling
, quadruple impalement on an overturned tabel
and keitel getting bitten by a vampire
and announcing he onyl has a few minutes left before he becomes
" a lap dog of satan
.
" thge from dusk till dawn dialogue isnt 100
% tarantino
, hovering between absurd
and disgusting
( as when htey ' re entering the nightclub
adn cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister
)
,
but always entertaining
,
and is a huge reason the movie isnt so much fun to watch instead of being one more second
- rate gorefest
. clooney
, keitel
anbd especially tarantino are so over
- the
- top with theri delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious
, ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken thge least bit seriously
. stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie
,
but tarantino
and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people
, even if there ' s absolutely noone message or meaning to from dusk till dawn
. pulp fiction had tje vulgarity
and violence fo a reason
,
but this movie just throws it out for cheap enteratinment
. from dusk till dawn isn ' t the classic of modern cinema that pf is
,
but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie
.
