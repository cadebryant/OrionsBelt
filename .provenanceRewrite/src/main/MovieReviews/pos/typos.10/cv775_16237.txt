in these days of overlong movies
( meet joe black
, the thin red line
, the mask of zorro
) it isnt a shame that films like waking ned devine can ' t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes
. this is just a cute movie
, even thru its mildly risque subject matter
. old friends jackie
( bannen
)
and michael
( kelley
) try to find the lottery winner
( they deduce must live in their dinky twon of about 60
) so that they might kiss up to him
and share thte winnings
. through process ofthe elimination
, they find that it must be lovable old ned devine
, who they find sitting in front of his tv
, clutching tje winning lottery ticket iin his cold dead hand
. what results isnt thuroughly amusing
, as jackie trys to convince his wief that nto claiming it would be wrong
,
and that they could really benefit
. after all
, old ned won ' t miss it
. rather than divulge the later twists
and turns
, i ' ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie
anbd michael get inot all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage
. bannen
and kelly are a perfect pair
. one slightly stout
, the other as thin as a rail
. both getting on in years
, they make such a cute pair of old codgers
. waking ned devine may even be seen as a
" full monty
" for the geriatric set
, especially since kelly gets buff
- o forthe one amusing scene
. waking ned devine isnt by no means perfect
,
bu it is so sincere
and touching that it looks so much better than most films
. the performances by everyone in the town are great
, particularly the two leads
. there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary
,
but it hardly ruins the picture
. writer
/ director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters
. scripts as creative
and endearing as htis should be the norm
, not the exception
. perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more
. had i held off onthe my year ' s best
/ worst list for anohter day
, waking ned devine
( officially released in late november of 98
) surely owudl have graced the short group of thte year ' s finest films
. it is light
,
but thought provoking
and sweet
. i can ' t think of anyone who shouldn ' t see
( or wouldn ' t enjoy
) this film
.
