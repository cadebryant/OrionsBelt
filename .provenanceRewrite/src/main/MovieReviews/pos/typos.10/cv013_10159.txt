synopsis
: in this movie

)
-
- a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery
-
-
and his fellow prisoners
. cinque
and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders
,
but since the americans don ' t speak cinque ' s language
, the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves
. technically
, sicne the international slave trade ws outlawed at that time
, peple like cinque couldn ' t be kidnapped into slavery
; oen had to be born a slave to be legally consdidered a slave
. lawyers baldwin
and adams
( matthew mcconaughey
annd anthony hopkins
) must prove cinque
and tje others were captured into slavery
, rather than born slaves
, in order to get them out of prison as free men
. three lengthy court cases are potrayed with spielberg ' s trademark panache
-
- flashy beginning
, lots of facial close
- ups
, big music
,
and dramtic imagery
. a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened tothe the various characters
. opinion
: making a fictional movie is easier than mkaing one about real life
. infront fiction
, one invents purposeful
, clear
- cut good guys
and bad guys
, puts the fictional characters in conflict
,
and takes the tale tothe its exciting conclusion
. real life
,
however
, consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments
and characters who stand around
, think thoughts
and do nothing
, or come
and go before events are resolved
. spielberg gives us a visually spicy
and historically accurate real life stor
. djimon hounsou
adn anthony hopkins turn inaddition excellent performances
