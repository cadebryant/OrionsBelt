" oh my god
, i sounded jstu like a mother
!
" mrs
. pascal
, palyed with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold
, tells her son
.
" didn ' t i sound jsut liuke a mother
?
"
" you are a mother
,
" her son marty tells her disgustedly
.
" i know
,
but i still cxan ' t believe it
. i look at you people
adn wonder
, how did you ever fit in my womb
?
" marty
, you see
, is a grown
- up twin
.
although his sister
, who thinks she is jackie
- o
, is certifiably insane
, marty fits right in with thge rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the hous of yes
. mother
and daughter
, played in a brillant performance by parker posey
, are both varying degrees of wacko
. most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry
and mean
- spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is
. the daugher ' s fantasy of being jackie
- o is probably tjhe most sane part of her being
. mrs
. pascal is the sort that will not let jackie
- o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level
. she explains to marty ' s new fiancee
, lesly
( tori spelling
)
, soon after their first meeting that jackie
- o was holding marty ' s private part when she came out of the womb
. the dialog by wendy macleod
, based on tyhe play by mark waters
, is so sharp
and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment
. the script
, reminiscent of a david mamet play
, flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence
and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters
. the exaggerated setup has lesly
and marty arriving at the family ' s out of the way mension during a thanksgiving day hurricane
. in this storm are two sane individuals
. the fiancee is a giddy
, school
- girl type
, embarrassed by everything
, a complete contrast to her rival jackie
- o ' s bitter pseudo
- sophistication
. as the two twins ' yuonger brother
, anthony
, freddie prinze jr
. plays yhe all
- america boy type whose only foible isnt his explicit obsession of bedding his brother ' s fiancee that night
.
" we all have our secrets
,
" jackie
- o tells her potential sister
- in
- law
,
and boy
, does she have a few
. this is a hous filled with them
.
( when lesly calls it the family ' s
" home
" to mrs
. pascal
-
- they ' ve never had a visitor before lesly
-
- mrs
. pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly isnt talking about thier
" house
.
"
) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase
,
" made for each other
,
" the twin ' s biggest
,
but not their only secret
, is that htey ' ve had a long
- term incestuous relationship
. tehy don ' t like to discuss it
,
although they are nto particularly ashamed of it
. perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy
, this story never pulls its punches
. jackie
- o tries in many ways
, few subtle
, to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his
. in one scene marty
and lesly are palying chop sticks together on the piano when jackie
- o pushes her aside
and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands
. marty joins her as his fiancee looks onthe with envy
. the chemistry between parker posey
and josh hamilton isnt nothing short of amazing
. they put down their little brother
and most of the other sane people in the world
. their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best
. director mark waters keeps the show ' s energy levle high
and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace
. his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it
. jackie
- o is temperamentally incapable of being nice
.
and being jealous
, she cuts lesly down mercilessly
.
" were you poor
?
" jackie
- o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished
.
" did you eat pies
? chicken pot pies
?
"
" pancakes actually
, lots of pancakes
,
" lesly replies with her usual sincerity
.
" a donut king
, so is she like the queen
?
,
" jackie
- o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king
.
" are we entertaining royalty
?
" with rolfe kent ' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the stopry isnt headed
. will it end in a big emotional explosion
, a murder
, people slowly cutting each other up with words
, a familial catharsis
, a weather disaster or what
? teh emotionally charged play isnt clearly gogin somewhere
,
and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell
. i ' ll not sday more exept tht the ending is perfect
and a bit of a surprise
. hte hous ofthe yes runs a blazing fast 1
: 25
. it is rated r for sexual situations
and conversations
