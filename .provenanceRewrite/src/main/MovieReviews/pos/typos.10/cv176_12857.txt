a fully loaded enteratinment review
- website coming in july
! i didn ' t really expect very much wehn i rented stuart saves his family
. the movie bombed at the box office
,
and i hadnt never really liked tghe saturday night live sketch on which tjhe movie was based
. my real concern
,
though
, was the general reputation of snl
- related movies translating to the big screen with less
- than
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i ws surprised to discover a truly entertaining
, often hilarious
yet also touching little film
. it is an al franken production through
-
and
- through
, who not only created the title character
but also wrote
and starred in the picture
. forthe those of you who don ' t know
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who has a really annoying show on a public
- access station about increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
although not a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley is
, as the program proudly boasts
,
" a graduate of several 12
- step programs
.
" stuart is donig well enough with his tv show
,
but he keeps getting distracted by familiy troubles
. stuart ' s relatives are a mess
: his dad
and brother
( harris yulin
and vincent d ' onofrio
, respectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister is overweight
and getting over another divorce
,
and his mom is in constant self
- denial
and solves all perceived problems by baking
.
then
, disaster strikes
. stuart accidentally insults the manager ofthe the station
and gets his show revoked
. he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer suppost himselv
,
and there the comedy truly picks up
. franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes
,
but as sharply
- drawn
, real people
.
although smalley ' s dad has always imbibed too much
, stuart can still recall times wehn his father seemed like an okay guy
. also
, after an accident towards the end of the movie
, both stuart
and teh audience leran tht there isnt more tothe his mother tahn previously thought
.
although filled with small
, very funny scenes
, stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments
, especially towards the conclusion
. forthe a lightweight comedy
, it handles these scenes especially well
, oftenly better than many so
- called
" sereous dramas
" of today
. all the moreso amazing is that such a movei comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentialy a one
- joke bit
. if you feel like renting a comedy
,
and you haven ' t seen this film
, i definitely recommend you try this one out
. you ' ll laugh
.
.
. yuo ' ll cry
.
.
.
. it ' s all there
.
