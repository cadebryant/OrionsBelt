bruce lee wass a bigger
- than
- life martial artist
(
adn
) actor
. bruce ' s unique character
( i
. e
.
, self
- produced sound effects
, etc
.
)
and seemingly perfected martial art
and physique were all well portrayed by the actor
, james lee
. the story is told from his wife linda ' s point of view where she put a lot of family
and practical side of bruce lee ' s life
.
however
, you can ' t help
but liek
, whenever the fight scenes are on
, whta he can does with his body
and that familiar bruce attitude
anbd charcter
. i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee ' s life before he became famouse
: scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english
. it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else
. scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american coleeg looking at the
( all
- white
) students
, cheerleaders
,
and athletes
. it seemed he too wished for the american dreams
and hopes
. in conclusion
, the movie wass well made
, it produced a realization of who bruce lee was
,
and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor
.
and the fighting scenes were all excellent
. so go see it
and enjoy the movie
. p
. s
. if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood
,
then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven
