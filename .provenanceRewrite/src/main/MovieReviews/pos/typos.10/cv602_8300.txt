everyone ' s heard about thsi movie
,
and more specifically
,
* the
* scene
. everyone ' s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed
( no pun intended
) over
and over
.
and everyone ' s got to admit that they iwll never travel down a river again wihtout thinking ofthe deliverance
. good
! that ' s what you ' re supposed to do
! oh
, if you are one of the ones who hasn ' t seen this
yet
, or you
( somehow
) haven ' t heard about what happens
, here ' s your spoiler warning
. deliverance was a real shocker for it ' s time
( 1972
)
. major advances were being made in films
,
and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror inot the film industry
. when it was first released
, it literally shocked the audiences
. it was something that
, for the most part
, had really never been seen onthe tje big screen before
( among wide
- release films with an r rating
)
.
but by today ' s film standards
and in today ' s world
, such scenes as thge one in deliverance cxan be reproduced in a way that isn ' t as shocking
,
although they can be even more graphic
( e
. g
. pulp fiction
)
. pulp fiction did it in a way
,
and expanded on it in a way
, thast it could even be interpreted as funny
.
but in 1972
, deliverance was no laughing matter
. the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide tothe take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there
and in its glory
. the initial leader of the gropu is lewis
( burt reynolds in his prime
)
, a real outdoorsman
anbd more of a daniel boone
- type
then any of the others
. joining him are ed
( jon voight
)
, bobby
( ned beatty
)
,
and drew
( ronny cox
)
. the group ' s first objective is tothe find someone
( s
) to drive theri cars down the river to tghe point where they will end their trip
. they make arrangements witht a few mountain men
, who accept
$ 40
. 00 for the task
. drew also has the famous
" dueling banjos
" competition with a local who is
, let us say
, genetically challenged
. the men
then set off down the river
, with lewis
, also hte master at canoeing
, leading the way
. everything seems tothe be going fine
, until the two canoes split up
, leaving tyhe unexperienced ed
and bobby alone
. htey encounter twpo hillbillies
, armed whith a shotgun
, who captured them
. ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men
. ed nearly receives yhe same cruelty
,
but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow thru the rapist ' s back
. the other hillbilly gets away
,
adn the men have to deside what to do with the dead body
. disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout tihs film
. while attempting tothe make a quick
" paddle for it
"
, both canoes tip over
. drew
, who was without a life jacket
, was possibly shot
and cannot be found
. lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture durring the incident
and is in serious condition
. thsi leaves ed
and bobby
. ed decides to go outloud
and look for the remaining hillbilly
, alone
, with the bow
and arrow
. the question arises if he will be able to handle himself
, as he horribly botched a first shot atempt at a deer
, to which his comment
" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing
" will have more meaning in the future
. deliverance is definitely a wild ride
( oops
, i ' m doing it again
)
. it is extremely tense at some points
and very dramtic
. it ' s definitely one of those
" must see
" movies
and should be considered noe of tje classics ofthe its decade
.
