roman emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
) chooses his trusted general maximus
( russell crowe
) as his successor
.
however the emperor ' s evil son commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) murders his father before the annoncement can be made
,
and maximus
( as well as his family
) is sentenced tothe be executed
. maximus is able to escape his executioners
,
but is later captured
and sold as a slave to proximo
( oliver reed
)
. proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money
( he being a former gladiator himself
)
,
and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator
. when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum
, proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle
. maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus
. gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army
annd germania
,
and actually is able to maintain interest during teh now requred
" 40 mintues of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence
" style of moviemaking
. the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used
.
.
. it ' s choppy slow
- motion which is unsettling
annd distracting
. it ' s similar to the opening sequence in saveing private ryan
,
but nowhere near as effective
. the actual gladiator battles are thrilling
,
but also a bit disjointed
. many times it ' s unclear as to exactly what ' s going on
.
.
. all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled
. we ' re not sure who ' s blood or by who ' s hand
though
. htere ' s an instance of this ealier in teh film too that ' s disappointing
. it ' s comes when maximus escapes his executioners
. some flashes
adn a few quick cuts later
and maximus is free
.
.
.
but i still don ' t knwo exactly how he did it
. russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995 ' s virtuosity
. for whatever reason his stardom never arrived
.
.
.
but he should have it now
. from here on moviegoers should now be able to say
,
" let ' s go see the new russell crowe movie
"
. he gets the best scene infact the film
(
and one of the best moments of all recent movies
) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum
. it ' s both rousing
and chilling
. joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person
and nto just a cartoon character
( which could have easily happened
)
. commodus is conniving
, sneaky
and whiny
,
but phoenix never lets the charactor get silly
. it ' s a very good
(
and very creepy
) performance
. oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator
,
and it ' s a huge loss to the acting world
. i ' ve always been fascinated withthe reed
.
.
. he ' s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career
but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years
. it ' s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into rela movies again
, as he gives a fun
and sincere performance
. the film is dedicated to him
,
and he will surely be missed
. reed ' s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem
, as he still had scenes tothe be completed
. rather than recast the role
(
and end up reshooting a great deal of footage
)
, a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars
. ironically
, that was probaly more omney than reed ever earned for a single film
. anyway
, this digital effect is onyl used in one scene that i am aware of
( for about twenty seconds
)
and if ytou aren ' t looking for it you won ' t even be able to tell
. some of the other digital effects are less convincing
however
.
.
.
and like i always sday
, noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately
. it ' s sad that such a good film has these distractions
. movies like the fall of teh roman empire
and spartacus seemed tothe do okay without the use of coputer effects
. keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people
and real events
,
but is entirely a work of fiction
.
however it ' s a work of fiction that ' s great entertainment
,
and another film to add to tyhe list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a
. d
.
