sicne most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they ' re portraying
, it ' s fitting to say that
" beloved
" come as a real shock as a film
. it ' s confusing
, bizzare
,
and as tough a film to watch as any film i ' ve seen all year
,
and that ' s not necessarily becasue of the threee
- hour runing time
.
" beloved
" is challenging to watch
, filled with tough
and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard
,
and instead of a straight
- forward
, hollywood
- ized story about what happened tothe the slaves after they were freed
,
" beloved
" comes off as a cry ofthe anguish fomr all those who actually lived through whta happened
( or
, rather
, toni morrison
, who wrote the novel upon which this is based
)
.
" beloved
" tells the story of an ex
- slave named sethe
, played by oprah winfrey
, who lives on a large farm in the north with her children
. when the film opens
, her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist
, which shakes things up
, wounds the dog
,
and makes things generally uncomfortable for the familiy
. sethe is proud
,
though
,
and will not move
. her sons run away
, leaving only her
and her daughter
, denver
( kimberly elise
) alone with tje ghost which is there without any factual explanation
. a cuple years pass
,
annd the ghost remains
,
annd one day
, a man named paul d
( danny glover
)
, another ex
- slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together
, arrives
, asking for lodging
. he has beeen wandering around since he left the plantation
,
and when he enters the house
, it turns red
and becomes incredibly hot
. when he remarks about what he thikns is evil
, sethe replies
" it ain ' t evil
. it ' s just sad
.
" some more tiem passes
,
and paul d has become a fervent member of the household
,
and the ghost disappears
.
but when they return one day from going out
, they discover a young woman sitting inspite the house
. her name is beloved
,
and as played by thandie newton
, she has almost zero motor skills
. she stumbles around
, half
- grabbing onto things
and knocking them over
,
and when she speaks
, she lets outloud a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk
. they let her inot her house
,
and she begins to turn things upside down
.
" beloved
" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story
. most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic
, low
- lit room
, with thte occasional flash to the past
, where we see images ofthe such horror that we thank god for modern
- day psychoanalysts
. sethe
adn paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories ofthe their slavehood on the ood plantation
, which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands
, with her nipples being licked
, prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it
,
" they took my milk
!
" worst of all was the month after her freedom
, when she was alloween to live like a free person
, wokring wtih other blacks on a farm
,
and
then seeing that her old plantation owners ahve arrived to presumedly tkae her
and her children back
. she runs to the barn near by
, carrying her four children
,
adn when her old owners burst in
, they discover she hasnt murdered one of them
and isnt ready tothe murder the rest of them if they don ' t leave them alone
. when she is inquired about htis moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film
, she syas she doesn ' t regret it
. she killed her daughter so that she would nto have to live through the horror she did
,
and she has convinced herself she did the right thing
. of course
, beloved is really her daugher materialized
,
though we aren ' t flat out told that until later on in the film
. beloved represents the pain
and suffering the slaves went through
adn shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long
. thus
,
" beloved
" becomes a sorta
- redux ofthe the andrei tarkofsky sci
- fi classic
,
" solaris
,
" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife
, who commited suicide years before
, has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system
. that film spoke volumes about humanity
and our memories
, how we are constantly regretting what happend in the past
,
and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us
, it would control us completely
.
" beloved
" moves along freely
, without a lot of explanation
,
and for the most part
, this is extremely respectable
. the most intresting films are the ones that don ' t explain everything for us
, leaving gaps in the characters that we are suposed to fill in with how htey act in thge present tense
. sethe is never fully explained as a character
,
bu we understand all her actions since she ' s being played by oprah winfrey
. it ' s been well over a decade since her last major performance in
" the color purple
,
"
but judging from these two films
, i ' ll bet she ' s one of the best actresses working today
.
.
. if she ws strictly an actress
. her talk show
, which i suppose is a great entity
, has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress
,
and that ' s a shame because she brings so much to tihs movie
. emotion
. sadness
. strength
. watching hte strong sethe
, who ' s so afraid of thte past that she ' s built a rather strong protective coating around herself
, break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great
. she makes it real
. that ' s not to sday this is a perfect film
. infact fact
, i ' d wager to say that the fact that it ' s confusing
annd painful tothe watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is
. hwile oprah ' s performance is powerful
and easily sympathetic
(
and i ' m dying tothe see her win at least an oscar nomination this february
)
, the structure of the film
, which doesn ' t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film
, prevents us from really mkaing a cohesive connection to the film
. it doesn ' t necesarily move as
though they ' re memories of one particular character
,
and by the end
, it has lost control over sethe
,
and as she takes to bed
, we are unable to truly identify with her anymore
.
bu despite its tediousness
, perhasp that ' s the point
. the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the strat
, since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable
,
and it needs to git bakc with reality
.
and for the most part
, this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it realyl wants to be
. jonathan demme ' s direction is bizarre
, in nature with the story
,
and he creates teh right mood
, making it a tough film to sit through
, making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters
. there ' s more to admire here
, like the way that the flashbacks pop uv freely
and without real organization
, just like they would be in real life
;
and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat ope to more pain
and suffering
,
but laced withthe a touch of optimism
. the acting
, not onyl from winfrey
, is amazing
,
and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination
. everyone has been raving about thandie newton ' s performance
,
and how it should be rewarded
.
however
, it must be noted that out of everyone
, she had the easiest part
. act like a baby
. throw things
. stumble around
. chew food with your mouth open
. i do think there ' s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation
,
but it ' s kimberly elise
, as the daugher who has to stay sensible
annd sane
,
and has to carry the burden of her mother ' s loss of reality towards the end
. it ' s not that newton isn ' t gerat
: she ' s as annoying
and wacky as the role demands
. it ' s just that elise has the tougher job
and pulls it off even better
. despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it
,
and not that ofthe writer morrison or director demme
,
" beloved
" hasnt still not done well
. costing
, i think
, aroud ninety million dollars
, it has since grossed baout twenty
- two
. unfortunately
, thsi film is a little too intense for viewers
, even for me
,
and i can stand almost anything
( i recently viewed the 2 1
/ 2 hour long epic
" caligula
,
" the worst film i have ever seen in my life
,
and did it in a mere 2 sittings
)
.
although i respect
" beloved
,
" i can ' t say that i really enjoyed it
.
