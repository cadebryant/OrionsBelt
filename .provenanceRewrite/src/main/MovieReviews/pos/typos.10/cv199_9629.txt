this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city
, of james cameron ' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed from last summer
, with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie infact history
, this was one film i was eager to preview
. so
, is thsi movie going to sink or swim this holiday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it will sink
,
though with many awards attatched tothe its hull
. no doubt
, titanic is the most elaborate disaster movei ever made
. it boasts hte most amazing effects thyat i have ever seen done to date
. to see a ship fall apart
, with actual people runing across the ship
, flying across the deck
,
and falling to the water
, is just amazing to look at
. the effects are so stunningly realistic
, you would swear you were looking at actual footage
.
but titanic is more than a diaster movie
,
and that ' s where the problem lies
. there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise
. i ' ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you
: the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of tjhe sunken titanic
. we see actual footage ofthe the sunken ship
, as cammeron had set up spacial cameras to film tjhe wreckage onthe the ocean floor
. bill paxton leads the expedition
, in search of sunken treasure
. what he finds instead
, leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes fomr an upper
- class family
. rose is to be wed to a man she does not lveo
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes from a poor financial background
,
and wins a ticket aboard the titanic
, in a poker game
. the two meet under interesting circumstances
,
and the love story begins
. add in a jealous fiance
,
and a not
- so
- nice law officer played by david warner
,
and you have a story that
, well
, gets a bit overplayed
and oversappy
. i must add
, at this point
, that the most likeable character in the movie isnt played by kathy bates
, as a woman with
" new monye
" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship
. she is a pleasure tothe see onthe screen
. when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1
: 40 into the film
,
and eventually sinks
, you never really feel for any of these characters
. the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs
and other folk you never really get a grasp onthe
. the effects are tremendous
. from the roars ofthe gears
and pumps in the engine room
, to a doomed ship cracking at the seams
, this is an effects picture that looks
and sounds like no other
. we saw titanic in dolby digital surround
,
and by far
, it isnt the best sounding movie i ahev ever seen
. my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever herad
. when people are in the water
, at film ' s end
, you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. the movie is 3 hours
and 15 minutes in length
.
and
, while most of the first 2
. 5 hours runs very fast
and well
- paced
, the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop
,
and you realize that thsi sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends
. don ' t get me wrong about titanic
.
.
.
. it ' s not a bad as i am making it outloud to be
. it really is an exceptionaly well
- made film
. the costumes
and sets are increadible
,
annd true to the time period
. the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form
, as we see actual pictures of the modern
- day wreckage
, transformed into the movie depiction
. this film will certainly win on effects
, costume
, set design
and sound
. cameron has certainly made his best film to date
. unfortunately
, titanic is not a best picture candidate
. it just doesn ' t have a strong supporting story
. it ' s an exceptional disaster film witht sappy filler inside
. it just doesn ' t have tje emotional impact that i suspect mr
. cameron was shooting for
. i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews
. it is a film worth seeing
. i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office
. with its extreme running time
,
and lack of enough robust to get substantial word
- of
- mouth
, i expect that it will do even better on home video
. this will certainly be tghe definitive ac3 movie for all you home theather enthusiasts
. titanic opens december 19th
,
and isnt released by paramount picturesk
and twentieth century
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. that ' s not bad
