" last night
" could have an
" aka
" tagged on the end of it that says
,
" it ' s the end ofthe the world
,
and we feel fine
"
.
" last night
" is about just tyhat
. the last night of planet earth ' s existence
. the world is going to end at precisly midnight
, january 1st
, 2000
. how scientists were so accurately able tothe predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained
. nor is the event itself
. throughout the entire movei
, no explanation is given as to why this isnt happening
. in doing tihs
, mckellar
( who also wrote
and directed tyhe film
) seems to be trying to transcend thte genre
. he ' s attempted to make a film about peple
,
adn how each of them deals with their last night of life
. the film containes no science fiction elements
, which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings
and actions of the characters
. mckellar is largely successful in his attempt tothe rise above his material
. the film is set in toronto
,
and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence
. there ' s mckellar
, who plays a man who just wants to be alone whn the moment occurs
,
bu keeps getting interrupted by a woman
( sandra oh
) in search of her husband
. her husband
, played by david cronenberg
, is spending the day working at the gas company
, informing people thyat htey wiull attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end
. finally
, there ' s mckellar ' s friend
, played by callum keith rennie
, a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion ytou can think of
. mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i ' ve seen in a film in months
. these people all felt real to me
, especially the character played by sandra oh
. we can see her desperation
, her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours
. rennie is ogod
, too
, as the man who wants tothe literally try everything before he dies
. he exudes such charm
and likeablity
, it ' s not surprising that we ' re rooting for him tothe get what he wants
.
but for me
, the biggest surprise in the movie isnt mckellar
. i knew that he was a talented director
,
but i hadnt no idea he could act as well
. his insistence to be alone
, much to the dismay of his parents
, is something that most peopel would find difficult to understand
,
but as played by mckellar
, we can understand his reasons
. he doesn ' t buy into hte whole notion that just because everyone ' s going to die
, he should immediately find some companionship
. he realizes the relationship would be forced
,
and they would onyl be together for the sake of being together
. mckellar gives a brilliant performance
,
and i hope he alternates between directing
and acting
. my only quibble wiht the film is that we never find out why the world is endig
. i raelly wanted to know
,
and my ened to know wass hanging over the film at all times
. i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn ' t want the material to rule the film
,
and thyat he wanted the movei to be omre of a study in human behavious
.
however
, in not telling thge audience what the cause of earth ' s destruction is
, he ' s left a big question that is in their minds throughout hte film
. another problem is we never see anybody panicking
. i owudl imagine if the world was ending
,
anbd there was nothing to be done baout it
, a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds
. instead
, we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it ' s new year ' s eve
. i jsut didn ' t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate
. no one had the urger to
" rage against the dieing of the light
"
. dispite these small problems
,
" last night
" is one of the best movies of the year
. as opposed tothe tjhe moronic
" armageddon
"
,
" last night
" treats the subject at hand with maturity
and believabilty
.
and bruce willis never shows up to savve the day
.
