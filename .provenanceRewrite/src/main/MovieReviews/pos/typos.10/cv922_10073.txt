if there is one hting that bothers me about hollywood films it ' s thier predictable endings
. the devil ' s advocate has thte atypical hollywood ending
, when everything that should happen does
. unfortunately for the devil ' s advocate
, this endig nearly collapses in on itself
,
and ruins the entire film
. nevertheless
, the film does provide two
adn a half hours of pure entertainment
( note to self
: kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film
)
. i don ' t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan
. well
, it doens contain this element
,
but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements
(
and seemingly more interesting ones at taht
)
. the devil ' s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) isnt the defense attorney
, wokring forthe a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl
. he ends up with a not
- guilty verdict
, despite an emotional testimony from tje victim
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to halp choose a good jurny
. he accepts
( mainly after seeing yhe paycheck he will receive
)
and he flies to new york wtih his wief
. after proving his worth fo selecting juries
(
and his perfect winning streak in court
)
, the head of the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he is treated almost as a god
. he is given an incredible apartment
( which is bigger than my entire hous now
)
,
and a hefty paycheck
. his life seems to be on the rise
.
and of course
, his life suddenly begins to waver
and slowly decline
. he isnt attracted tothe fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
,
and his wife begins to feel vrey lonely in her large apartment
. mary ann tkaes up a friendship withthe a neighbor who always gives advice
, especially if it is not wanted
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who apparently murdered three people
. he spends hours upon hours with this case
, while forgetting his loving wife
, who may or may not be going insane
. all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself
. affter a while
, things turn completely upside
- down
, as kevin ' s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed onthe her friends
. a fellow employee is murdered in the park
,
and his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals infomation about kevin ' s real father
. is it all just a big nightmare
? or is john milton really satan
, playing tricks with kevin ' s life
? the devil ' s advocate plays out fairly straight
- forward
,
but for some odd reason
, the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don ' t expect
. is this suprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good
and go home wihtout feeling depressed or disturbed
? if so
, the devil ' s advocate messes up completely
,
and ironically
, i felt more depressed because of thge ending as is now
, than i owudl have if it hadnt ended ten mintues early
. i went into teh devil ' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
,
and that is exactly what i got
. i was settled in tothe be disturbed mentally
and emotionally
,
and that is what i got
.
but what was the most disturbing
and horrible aspect ofthe the movie is the poor ending
( did i mention that i didn ' t like the ending
?
)
. the producers of this film tkae you on a thrilling roller coaster ride
and just as it is ending
, they pul the rug out from under you
. films like se7en
and tghe usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected
, more or less
. we nkwo it isnt going to end in an unpredictable way
. tyhe devil ' s advocate
, on the other hand
, ends unpredictably
, not from us knowing a lot
,
but knowing nothing at all
. if that is confusing
, i recomend watching the film
,
and
then reading that again
. as for tghe film overall
, i enjoyed the entire first two hours
, being drawn in by a terrific character study
and
then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study
. the film runs like a well
- built clock
, slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax
(
and an unpredictable one at that
)
.
and
then you settle in for a nice resolution
, which does not occur
. it was at this point that i falt cheated
. taking us on a terror ride of intrigue
, we follow kevin lomax around
, as he is the centerpiece ofthe the film
. everything occurs from his prespective
. he is our representation on screen
( sort of
)
.
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game
. i don ' t want to spoil the ending
, so all i can say is go see teh film
and decide for yourself
. perhpas the most shocking thing baout the devil ' s advocate is the extreme ammount of everything
. it earned its r rating for a reason
. there is plenty of nudity
, sex
, violence
, gore
,
and
then you ahve gore
, violence
, sex
,
and more nudity
. this film really isn ' t subtle baout anything
, showing us everything
. it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc
- 17 rating
, as it is quite harsh
.
however
, the movie doesnt have its merits
,
and nudity
and sex are among thsoe
. i don ' t condone sex
and nudity in films
,
bu if its there
, i might as well enjoy it
. the biggest merit of thsi film is also the most interesting to watch
. the confrontations between kevin lomax
and john milton are entertaining
,
but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline ofthe the wife
, mary ann
. portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron
, mary ann ' s problems are incredibly intense
,
and i found myself wanting to wittness her decline
. this may sound uncaring
,
but i wanted to watch beacuse i felt sorry for her
. she is the most interesting character on the screen
, who is forced into a world where she is not wanted
. something the devil ' s advocate contained actually shocked me forthe reasons other than extreme violence
and nudity
, especially for a film of this nature
. the story actually has something to say about humanity
. in one of the last scenes
, john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children
( he is satan
, of course
)
. he comments that it is human nature to lust
and loathe in vanity
.
then
, god sets up rules which contradict human nature
. this semi
- religious bashing is more humorous than frightening
. what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud
, partially thinking it was funny
,
but patially realizing it was true
. these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil ' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing
(
but i ' m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on
)
. when a film has something tothe say baout our society
, it deserves to be watched
. teh cast of the devil ' s advocate is oney of the highlights
, as we see memorable faces
,
and tehy put spins on those memorable faces we don ' t expect
. heather matarazzo mkaes a brief appeareance as the terrorized victim in the oppening court case
,
and she doesnt a great job
. propably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves
. he has proven himself an uneven actro
( successes such as speed
and bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
,
but he tops himselv with this performance
. i have never seen him more believable to date
. al pacino is of course the scene stealer
. his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson
( the witches of eastwick
)
and max von sydow
( needful things
)
. he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes
,
but he remains completely believeable
( if that is the correct term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller ' s day off
) also gives a good peformance as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin ' s past
. connie nielson is very effective in her role
,
and she also appears naked several times
. one familiar face with a twist was
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a very good performence
. the devil ' s advocate is rated r for sexuality
, nudity
, violence
, laguage
,
and some gore
. at 144 minutes
, this film moves along fairly quickly
. for the frist two hours
, i sat completely engaged inwhich the good performances
and storng charachters
. the technical qualiy is also remarkable
, with great special effects
and a good musical score
. director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture
, only to ruin a good chunk of tension wih the final fifteen mintues
. i guess my biggest problem with the endig is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film
,
and hackford gave me just that for a long time
.
but just before the end
, he got jitterish
and relied on the hollywood safety net in order tothe make his film mroe mainstream
. personally
, i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early
.
