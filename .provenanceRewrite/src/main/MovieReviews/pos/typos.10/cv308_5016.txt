the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who jsut happen to be slightly insane
. billy
, palyed by michael keaton
, is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse
and violent tantrums tend tothe get him inspite trouble
. christopher lloyd portrays henry
, an obsessive
- compulsive who requires that everything be neat
, orderly
, on schedule
,
and by the books
. he thinks he ' s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit
and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes
and files reports
. jack
, plyed by peter boyle
, thinks he ' s jesus
.
and finally
, there ' s stephen furst as albert
, a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball
annd television phrases
. the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four
- some when their psychiatrist
, dr
. weitzman
, takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium
. during a pit stop
, they get separated from weitzman
and are left tothe fend for themselves in manhattan
. the movie ' s charm derives mostly from tghe camaraderie
and chemistry between its delightful cast
. the four leads in the film play off each otehr quite effectively
; they never miss an opportunity to argue
, bicker
, or insult one another
. henry
and jack
, for example
, fight over who ' s going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on tje way to the gam
. the actors in the dream team ahve a lot of fun with their characters
and with each other
. michael keaton is well cast as billy
; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity
. as the divinely jack
, peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one
- dimensional character funny
and fresh
.
although stephen furst ' s catatonic character is cliched
, the actor makes him sympathetic
and endearing
. hwile keaton
, boyle
,
and furst are good
, it ' s christopher lloyd who raelly makes the movie special
. lloyd gives
yet another outstanding comic performance
. his body language
( for example
, the way he walks
)
and his facial expressions are perfectly suited tothe his compulsive character
. lloyd ' s brilliant performance yields a pathetic
, moving
,
and memorable character
. tje dream team is a solid comedy with more depth
and drama than you might expect from its simple premise
. the characters are so appealling that you cxan excuse the film for its often outlandish
and unbelievable plot
