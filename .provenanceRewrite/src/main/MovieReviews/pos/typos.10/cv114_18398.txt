it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking wehn oney has nto experienced the heartache of loseing a child
? whether that may be in life or in death
. after having said that
, i will also sday that tihs movie does all ofthe the above very well
. one gets that choking sensation in the throat
( because of grief
) when noe brother forgives another for a costly mistake
, or when a husban hugs his wife after a long estrangement
. there is no ocean
, no drownings
and it does not conjure up memories of
yet another
? ordinary people '
. in fact the only thing remotely connected tothe the ocean is probably tap water
and teh toilet flushing
( not that htis literally happened in the movie
)
. so what are the lessons learnt
: 1
. don ' t take your children to class reunions
. 2
. don ' t leave them alone in thte lobby
, not even for a second
. michelle pfeiffer once again plays tyhe role of a highly
- strung wife
and mother
, a trend that started with
? a thousand acres '
and
? one fine day '
. my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie
, so much so that when she hasnt a nervous break down
, the veins on her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance
, playing a lesbian cop
, with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop
. lastly
, who are the ideal companions for thsi sort of movie
? my grandmother comes to mind
.
