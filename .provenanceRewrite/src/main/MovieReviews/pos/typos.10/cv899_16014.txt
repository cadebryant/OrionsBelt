the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ
, which explains why the bard ' s materials are such a popular source for remakes
, revisions
, rewrites
, inspiration
, subtlety
, credit
,
and dispute
. indeed
, in receet years
, american contamporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products
. including this year ' s upcoming a midsummer nght ' s dream
, shakespeare ' s material has been the cause for twenty
- six big screen productions since 1990
.
bu for a change of pace
, mrs
. brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare inaddition loev
. marc norman
and tom stoppard ' s story is largely fantasy
,
although as the viewer soon learns
, shakespeare in love is nto a movie that takes itself seriously
.
( will shakespeare of the 1590 ' s would ' ve been married to anne hathaway
,
and he would ' ve had a teenage daughter
adn two young sons
; here he is a bachelor palyed by joseph fiennes
.
) will is a writer struggling to come up with a graet play
,
adn his current comedy in the works
-
-
" romeo
and ethel
, the pirate ' s daughter
"
-
- just doesn ' t quite seem right
. with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe
( rupert everett
)
,
and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, he changes things around
and writes one of his greatest tragedies
,
" romeo
and juliet
.
" the love story between wiull
and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo
and juliet
, to great effect
. fiennes
and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as tje two lovers which gives the movie much momentum
; this momentum smoothes out thte bumps in the unfinished
and largely unsuccessful comedy
. the supporting roles are well filled out
, from geoffrey rush as will ' s worrisome agent
, philip
, to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman
. even ben affleck
, leading the troupe of actors
, manages to make a favorable impression
;
and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i
. gwyneth paltrow is by far
,
however
, the standout of the lot
, creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance
. the story is well
- crafted if nothing alse
,
although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the
" let ' s mkea a movie
"
- genre
. the dialogue is breezy
and lighthearted
,
and certainly accessible by the audience ' s lowest common denominator
. there ' s something for everyone in this romantic comedy
, making it prime date flick material
.
although certainly not inspiring in any regard
, it revels in a wholesome
, well
- rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998 ' s pictures
; the true
- love story is one of tghe best around
. certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent yera ' s
- open releses is just around teh corner
.
