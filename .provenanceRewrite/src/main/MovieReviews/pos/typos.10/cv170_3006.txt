i don ' t know what movie the critics saw
,
but it wasn ' t this one
. the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny
annd dreadfully boring
. in my personal opinion
, they couldn ' t be more wrong
. if you were expecting airplane
!
- like laughs
and agatha christie
- intense mystery
,
then yes
, this movei would be a disappointment
.
however
, if you ' re just looking for an enjoyable movie
and a good time
, this is oen to see
. honest
, it is
. this story is about a 4th network
, wbn
, taking to america ' s airwaves in 1939
. penny henderson
( mary stuart masterson
)
, tje station owner ' s secretary
, must deal with her overbearing boss
, an unimpressed sponsor
and writers ready tothe quite on a moment ' s notice
, partly due to the fact that they haven ' t been paid in weeks
. among hte mayhem
, she must allso deel with her soon
- to
- be ex
- husband
, roger
( brian benben
) who desperately wants her back
. unfortunately
, her problems only get worse as the night goes on
and the body count rises without explanation
. while trying to woo penny back
, roger must deal with the police
and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn
. mary stuart masterson does well inaddition her role as penny
( i ' m trying tothe be unbiased so i won ' t tell you how amazing she looked
)
,
although brian benben gets most ofthe the screen time
. along with the two leads
, are several recognizable faces
, including corbin bernsen
( l
. a
. law
)
, michael mckean
( laverne
& shirley
)
and bobcat goldthwait
. the special effects are amazing
,
and fooled me
( which some may argue isn ' t very difficult to do
) in many scenes
.
although yhe movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy
, it more than makes up forthe those mistakes througout the movie
. overall
, i gave it
, or an
, depending on what system you use
