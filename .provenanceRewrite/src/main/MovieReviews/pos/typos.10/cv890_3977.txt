( with more than us
$ 150 million inwhich the states alone

and drama ensue as the three men are left in spoace with their spaceship out of control
and the problem of surviving the journey home
.
.
. if they ever reach it
. ed harris
and gary sinise who play
, respectively
, the man in charge ofthe the entire mission control
and the astronaut who was supposed to fly
but was diagnosed with measles
, both delve into their roles superbly
. audiences are shown the chaotic
and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew
, as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how tothe save the astronauts from hurtling into space
. also
, there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which tookover the entire us nation inot 5 days of drama in 1970
. the special effects by digital domain are up to standard
and the music suits the suspense
annd drama very well
, thanks tothe film
- music maestro james horner
. watch out for the launching sequence
, it is simply one ofthe the most breathtaking scenes of the film
. a bad point
though
: apollo 13 features much technical jargon
and many physcis concepts inaddition its script
. those who consider themselves
` scientifically illiterate ' might have a slight problem understanding waht caused this
and what caused that during the course of the show
. this is
however
, just a minor point
, just forget all those technical bullshit
and immerse yourselves into the drama
and suspense throughout the film
. you should enjoy it
