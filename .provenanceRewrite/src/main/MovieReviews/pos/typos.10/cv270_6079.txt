) the film follows renton who gets clean
, gets back into heroin
and gets clean again
. some of the wit in this movie is sharp
and pulp fiction
- esque
,
and some is just dumb
& dumber gross
( the bed sheets
)
and stupid
( the bb gun
)
although the film starts out on a comic onot
, it takes a sharp term in the middle
,
and becomes almost depressing
. the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title
. i cant honestly say that this isnt one of hte best movies i have ever seen
. it is an obscure gem that hasnt been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible
and id4
. tyhe film isnt hard to follow with the heavy accents of thte actors
. this is a very original film
, as far as films go today
. it definetly deserves multiple viewings
( partly because of the slang
and accents
