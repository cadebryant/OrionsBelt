" a breed apart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner
. a bit hard to swallow
? that ' s only the first of many improbabilities in this film
. hauer stars as a man obssessed with keeping thge birds on his island safe
, while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner is tje woman caught between the two men
.
" a breed apart
" isn ' t a bad movie
, exactly
. indeed
, i found myself rooting for both the hauer
and boothe characters
, even
though thier goals couldn ' t be more different
. thge problem with teh film is that there are just too many inconsistencies
. for example
, early onthe in the film
, hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later on
, the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people
,
and hauer kills a few of them
. i have a tough tiem believing that the police wouldn ' t get involved at that point
. another probelm is the silly love
- triangle that develops
. i didn ' t care one way or the other who ended up with turner
. i was more interested in finding out which ofthe yhe two men would be victorious in their respective missions
.
however
, despite this uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there ' s more to life than money
and birds
. as for hauer
, he ' s an actor i ' ve always admired
. he has a penchant for picking strange
and unusual characters
.
and this oney is no exception
. he ' s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse
, wearing pirate ' s clothing
,
annd holstering a cross
- bow
. despite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through
. for example
, there ' s a scene in which he barks at turner
and her son because they came onto his island a day early
. he comes off as crazy loner inthe that scene
,
but a few minutes later
, he is apologizing to turner
,
anbd we believe his intentions
. soon after
, we find out he ' s a vietnam vet
,
and his actions become fairly clear to us
.
" a breed appart
" isn ' t a great movie by any means
,
bu it does contain good performances by all three leads
,
anbd it ' s worth seeing for that reason alone
.
