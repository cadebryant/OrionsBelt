jackie brown entered theaters iwth little fanfare
and a lot of expectation
. even
though advance publicity on this one wass fairly limited
, the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation
. this is
, after all
, the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction
. to say he has been inactive in betwen would be to tell a falsehood
, since he has been involved inwhich such projects as destiny turns on the radio
, desperado
, four rooms
,
annd from dusk ' til dawn
. he was also called in at the lastr minute to help punch up teh screenplay for crimson tide
.
( i ' m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him
.
) tarantino contributed on
and off screen to these films
,
but never took the directer ' s helm
. nearly four years since gaining notoriety onthe the hollywood scene
and making john travolta a star once more
, tarantino returns with a film he can call his own
. the film opens up wtih an homage to the graduate
, with jackie brown
( pam grier
) on one of those airport peple movers as the credits are displayed in front of her
. jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo
, which flies back
and fourth between los angeles
and cabo san lucas
. this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi
( samuel l
. jackson
) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico
.
however
, while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u
. s
. for ordell
, jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus
( michael bowen
)
and atf agent ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, who catch her not only with the money
,
but with a bonus of a cuple of ounces of illicit drugs
. jackie didn ' t know they were in the package with the cash
,
but that ' s ofthe no consequence to the authrorities
, who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted
. of course
, dargus
and nicolet are jstu using tjhe sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish
, ordell
. ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
) to get jackie out of jail
,
but while max is immediately attracted to her
, jackie isnt more concerned about her immediate safety
, since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked uv by tje police
. sure enough
, ordell shows up at jackie ' s apartment that evening
and tries to silence jackie for good
,
but she
" borrows
" max ' s pistol
and manages to turn the tables on ordell
. instead of closing the irony circle
and relocating a bullet ffrom the pistol ' s chamber to ordell ' s head
, jackie proposes a deal
. sicne ordell whants to git his mney out of mexico
, jackie will get back up to her old tricks
and be a courier for him once more
,
but this time for a more substatial fee
: fifteen percent of ordell ' s half million dollars
. with a gun inthe his face
, how can ordell nto agred
? by itself
, this premise might have been interesting enough to cary the film
.
however
, we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention
and think
. jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell
,
but she ' s alsot making a deal with the feds as well as with max
. the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to beleve tyhe deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham
,
but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around
. instead
, it ' s actually a nice departure from the predictability whcih is prevalent in so many of today ' s movies
. at least tihs film hasnt a little imagination
. most of the performances in jackie brown are above par
. pam grier
, ofthe whom i had never taken notice before
, plays jackie with a mix of confidence
and vulnerability which makes her character believable
. samuel l
. jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control
. robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy
, trying to do his best
.
. never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy ' s aparment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course
. he ' s just so down
- to
- earth
, the nature of his job really doesn ' t occur to us
, even when we ' re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison
, or when we see the tools of his trade
. in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara
, a recently paroled friend of ordell ' s
,
and bridget fonda as melanie
, one of the girls ordell keesh around town
. unfortunatly
, de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few
and far between
,
and
then they are mostly clipped sentences
. in this film
, he ' s not really de niro
,
but stereotypical de niro
, uttering things like
,
" little bit
,
"
and
" pretty much
.
" fonda
, on tyhe otehr hand
, plays the slightly spaced
- out melanie with satisfactory relish
and cuteness
, such that even when she isnt annoying louis
, we are taking her side
. as isnt characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand
, the dialog is quick
and snappy
. it grabs our attention
and is actually interesting
,
adn in many respects
, this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals
; the lines are a form of art infact
and amoungst themselves
. don ' t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera
,
however
. ther ' s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange
,
and he ' s not really sure what ' s hapening
,
but by composing the scene jsut so
, his relization of what ' s goign on is felt simultaneously by the audience
. we look at the screen
and think
,
" gee
, that ' s clever
,
"
and
then think the same thing about how the film induced us into tht wonderful feeling of catching on
.
although tarantino isn ' t afraid tothe drag out a shooted for dramatic effect
, it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film
. there are shots where a character is simply driving
,
and we watch this person
and somehow git an idea of what is going on in his or her head
. this is a tribute to both direction
and acting
.
however
, there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall
,
and she is looking fo something
; desperately looking forthe something
. we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search
,
but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she ' s looking for
,
bu instead hoping she ' ll just stop
. overall
, viewing jackie brown is time spent well
. some flap has already been made about the language used in tje film
,
bu it ' s really not much worse than many of the other movies out ther today
. in fatc
, one might even be able to say tyhat the way in which these
" offensive
" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves
anbd therefore transcend their own offensiveness
. go see hte film
and see what i mean
.
