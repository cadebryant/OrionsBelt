. using the remains of murphy ' s body as a foundation
, their scientists build a cyborg
, made of both flesh
and metal
. the cyborg
( robocop
) isnt half human
( murphy
)
and half robot
; thge s

. i
. engineers have erased murphy ' s memory
and replaced it with a computer program
( or so they think
)
. wiht his lightning quick reflexes
, immense strength
,
and impenetrable armor
, s
. c
. i
. envisions robocop as an indestructible super
- cop
: the solution to detroit ' s problems
. the remainder of the plot follows robocop ' s crime
- foiling
and vengeance on his murderers
. as a science fiction action
- thriller
, robocop is extremely effective
. dutch directer paul verhoeven combines gritty action withthe suspense
, shocking gore
,
and spectacular special effects
. sevral sequences in the film
, such as thge one inwhich which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist
, are destined to become cult
- classics
. because robocop is so visually
and emotionally rousing
, it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience
-
- in otehr words
, in a movie theater
.
although the special effects
and action are exicting
, they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre
. rether
, robocop stands out for its accurate
and biting satire of american society
. the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative
, terrorism
, board games
,
and television news broadcasts with air
- headed anchors
. these news broadcasts
, which are exceptionally clever
, recur periodically throughout the movie
and help to provide comic relief fomr the intense action
and gore
. the satire in robocop
,
however
, is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense
and blood
. 1990 ' s america
, as protrayed in the film
, may seem far fetched
but is in actuality
( i think
) onyl a slight exaggeration ofthe the current state of american society
. the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible
and absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining
and enlightening piece of science fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunately
, robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a clasic within the genre
. the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior
, the terminator
,
annd aliens
. robocop ' s main problem
, aside from its dumb title
, is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy ' s character
. we never learn the degree to which murphy
( as robocop
) is human
and tje degree to which he is a robot
. does murphy have any human spirit or free will left
, or is he mearly a computer following a program
? the script halfheartedly raises these issues
but
thn abandons them in its climactic flurry ofthe gory action
. moreover
, it almost completely ignores the question
(
and tragedy
) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him inot a machine
. robocop also contains several bothersome loose
- ends
. as you watch robocop
, you experience deja vu
; yuo feel as if yuo ahve seen the film before
. in many respects
, robocop is reminiscent of several other films
, incuding the terminator
, return of the jedi
,
and even death wish
.
however
, to its credit
, robocop easily has enought originality
and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip
- off
