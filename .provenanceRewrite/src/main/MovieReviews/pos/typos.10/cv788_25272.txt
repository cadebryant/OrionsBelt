" you leave little notes on my pillow
. i told you a million times i can ' t stand little notes on my pillow
. ' we are all out of corn flakes
- f
. u
. ' it took me three hours to figure out thyat ' f
. u
. ' was felix unger
.
"
-
-
- a frustrated oscar madison
( walter matthau
) running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger
( jack lemmon
)
, in the odd couple
. the classic neil simon comedy
( based on his own stage play
) baout suicidal felix
( lemmon
)
, who is persuaded by his poker firend oscar
( matthau
) to stay withthe him inthe his apartment aftter felix ' s wife throws him outloud
and files forthe divorce
. the hook
: oscar is messy
and likes his apartment that way
, while felix is an obsessive
/ compulsive neat freak
. the two men
, despite their friendship
, instantly clash
. movies just aren ' t as delightfully funny as this one is
. every line of neil simon ' s dialogue flows like comedic poetry
,
and all the actors are just perfect in their performances
. lemmon is at his best as hte anxiety ridden felix
,
but it ' s matthau who shines brightest as oscar
, whose world is being invaded
and rearranged
, mostly against his wishes
( tyhe type of character i always enjoy identifying with
)
.
and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti
? the best thing about thte film
(
and this is a testament to the uality of the writing
) is thyat it ' s a comedy with substance
. these two men
, even while at each other ' s throats
, genuinely care for oney another as friends
. when they clash
, it isn ' t cartoonish hatred being displayed
,
but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends
but just cannot manage to co
- exist
. movies nowadays
, take grumpy old men fo example
, just don ' t have that extra spark there
. these days it ' s just animosity for the sake of comedy
. a television series followed
( starring jack klugman
and tony randall
)
, which i ' ll admit i ' ve never seen an episode of in its entirety
,
and neil simon even scripted the sequal
, the odd couple ii
, which was released in 1998
. neither of them compare to thsi comic masterpiece
though
. it ' s one of the best comedies of all time
and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films
.
