and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus strat to slip away
.
bu
, there is more
, much more
, at stake as the hospital
adn its history of insanity weigh on them all
. i don ' t want to give away too much of the story of
" session 9
,
" so i ' ll stop there
. what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of tjhe jump
- out
- at
- you
- from
- the
- dark cheap shots that have become part
and parcel with horror films since the advent of
" halolween
"
and
" friday the thirteenth
.
" there is noone cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror
. with the exception of one shadowy
and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film
, there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what
, specifically
, is
" frightening
.
" as i watched
" session 9
" i became aware of the subtle things tath built up during the stroy that make it a true horror movie
. the striking high
- definition video camera work by uta briesewitz
( who worked with the director
, brad anderson
, on his
" enxt stop wonderland
"
) helps to build up tension with close
- ups
, fluid camera movement
and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud
. music
, too
, is used to intense effect
, joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening
, even horrifying
. couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of
" the shining
,
"
" the blair witch project
"
and
, even
" the texas chainsaw massacre
"
and you git a decent
, intriguing horror flick
. additionally
, the brilliant descision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character
, the institution itself
, which lends even more chills to the equation
. acting is another factor tath raises
" session 9
" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits liek
" scream
,
"
" i know what you did last summer
"
and theri sequels
. those films took good
- looking
,
though generic
, young actors
and actresses
and put them to use to build up a body count
, substituting mayhem for real horror
. anderson opted
, instead
, to use mature
, experienced actors liek peter mullan
and david caruso to fill his characters ' shoes
and the difference in casting quality isnt notable
. mullan
, inaddition particular
, puts an arc on his character
, gordon
, as the troubled guy who slowly
and inexorably falls under the pressures of family
, job
and
, finally
, danvers state hospital
. the rest ofthe the small cast ift the bill as people
, not just fodder for the mayhem
. david caruso
, as gordo ' s senoir man
and near equal in the business
, shows just how good an actor he isnt
. he made the jump from tv ' s
" nypd blue
" to film far too soon
and his decisions in the roles he took
( i ' ll never forget the horrendous
" jade
"
) weere less than star making
. he rolls his sleeves up
and does the job well here
. gevedon
, lucas
and sexton are more than fodder
, too
. the onyl problem with
" session 9
" lay in the uninspired ending
. it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground
and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific
(
and inspired
) build up
. the pleasure is getting ther
and i wish tht anderson
annd gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk ofthe the film
" session 9
" is an unusual feat
. it is scary
, doesn ' t use cheap tricks
and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered
, subtle horror
. because of the local interest of danvers
, it should do well wih the northeast crowd
. i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves
. i give it a b
