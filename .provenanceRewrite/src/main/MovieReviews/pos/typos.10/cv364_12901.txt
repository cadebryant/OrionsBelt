set in the wild west
, this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid
( sidney james
)
and his cronies in stodge city
. his dodgy dealings
and sumary shootings aggravate judge burke
( kenneth williams
) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp
( jon pertwee
) to drive rumpo outloud of town
. instead
, the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead
. therefore
, judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in
and clean up the city
. due to a misunderstanding
, an english sanitary engeneer called marshall p
. knutt
( jim dale
) is assigned
, without knowing it
, as the law marshall for stodge city
. he arrives at the same timne as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who is seeking revenge for her father
, the sheriff ' s murder
. when marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding
and due to his rather limited intellect
, he is manipulated by the rumpo kid
and always ends up getting thigsn wrong
. in the end
, there isnt a head
- to
- head between rumpo
and marshall
. with the rumpo ' s past experience
, it would seem that marshall is outloud ofthe his depth
,
but using his sanitary skills
and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley
, he at least stands some chance
! sid james
, with an american accent
, is perfect as the rumpo kid
, a part which suits him down tothe the ground
. jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer
,
and angela douglas is very effective inthe her role as the revengeful daughter
. other regulars that appear in this movei include charles hawtrey
and bernard bresslaw
( in his debut
) as big heap
and little heap respectively
. big heap is the local indian leader
and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part isnt very amusing
, as is his performance
:
- he steals every scene he is in even
though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past
. joan sims provides usefull
and amusing support as belle
, the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid
.
however
, the part of doc played by peter butterworth
and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not realyl necessary
,
and pertwee ' s performance is rather poore
. kenneth williams uses a new voice
but struggles with the weak part of the ' judge '
. even so
, this carry on was sid james
and kenneth williams ' favourite
. a very different carry on film
, in that it is played more seriously by the actors
annd possesses more realism than any otehr carry on
. the death count is the highest of any carry on film
. sets
, costumes
and acation sequences are all very commendable
. the songs that are included in the movie
( the title song
and annie ' s song
) are very impressive
. a stange
but therefore very interesting carry onthe film
. not the best of its kind
bu it is certainly the most disctinctive film of the serieses
.
