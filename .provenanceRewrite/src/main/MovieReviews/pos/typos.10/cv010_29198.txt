after watching
" rat race
" last week
, i noticed my cheeks weere sore
and realized that
, when not laughing aloud
, i had held a grin for virutally all of the film ' s 112 mintues
. saturday night
, i attended another sneak preview for thte movei
annd damned if i didn ' t enjoy it as much the second time as the first
.
" rat race
" isnt a grat goofy delight
, a dandy mix of energetic performances
, inspired sight gags
and flat
- out silliness
. hands down
, this is the most fun film of the summer
. hte movie beigns with zippy retro
- style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out ofthe a ' 60s slapstick comedy
, featuring animated photos of the casted attached to herky
- jerky bodies bounding around the screen
.
then comes the setup
. donald sinclair
( john cleese
)
, the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel
and casino in las vegas
, enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients
. to that end
, he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines
. gathering together the lucky token holders
, he explains
,
" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six
.
" tje competition is simple
: each contestent gets a key that opens a locker iin silver city
, n
. m
.
, containing
$ 2 million in cash
. there is a transmitter in every key
, so that sinclair
and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead
. the race has no rules
? whichever contestent reaches the locker first gets the money
. since it would be wrong tothe spoil any of the jokes
, let ' s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers
. decked out inspite flashy
, trashy clothing
and sporting big hair
, vera baker
( whoopi goldberg
) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby
. she finds that grown
- up merrill
( lanai chapman
) is erudite
, conservative
and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life
. thrown together
, it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature
. owen templeton
( cuba gooding jr
.
) is currently the most hated man in amercia
. an nfl referee
, he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high
- profile game
. after escaping from a vengeful cab driver
, owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention
. mr
. pollini
( rowan atkinson
) is a cheerful
, odd little italian man on holiday in america
. he also is narcoleptic
and falls asleep at teh most inopportune times
. pollini hitches a ride with zack
( wayne knight
)
, a hyper
- tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation
. randy pear
( jon lovitz
) promised his wife beverly
( kathy najimy
)
adn two kids a fun
- filled vacation in las vegas
. fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvment iin the race
, he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview
. beverly insists the family stay together
, so they hop in the mini
- van
and tear off inot the desert
. brothers duane
( seth green
)
and blaine
( vince vieluf
) cody are young
, crooked
and stupid
. blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self
- done tongue piercing
,
and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him
. the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal
. finally
, nick shaffer
( breckin meyer
) is a no
- nonsense lawyer
- iin
- training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet
( amy smart
) for the journey
. at first glance
, they seem blandly wholesome
,
but all that changes when tracy buzzes the hmeo of her boyfriend shawn
( dean cain
)
and spies him swimming with anyother woman
. director jerry zucker
(
" airplane
,
"
" ghost
"
) leaps from racer to racer
, periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair
and mr
. grisham
( dave thomas
)
, his personality
- impaired right hand man
, continue cooking up bizzare bets for the gamblers
. as with any zucker production
, a few jokes fall flat
,
but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps
. high points forthe me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson
and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz
and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally
, witht an utterly tasteless
and screamingly funny pay
- off
. had i been part of the filmmaking team
, i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby ' s clothes
and instead had the key git lost in tjhe cleavage of a dozing society matron
. it would have drawn the smae laugh without the squirm
- inducing hint of child molestation
. i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence
. my god
, do we really ened
yet another movie with smash mouth performing
" all star
?
"
but enough carping
.
" rat race
" is a riot
, with terrific no
- holds
- barred performances from yhe diverse cast
. see it
, see it again
and when the dvd comes out
, buy it
, because a movie this hillarious will surely have outtakes to die for
.
