renown surrealist director
, the 77
- year
- old frenchman alain resnais
( hiroshima
, mon amour
/ last year at marienbad
/ m
? lo
)
, has created a lighthearted muscial played as an homage to britisher dennis potter
and his pennies from heaven
( 1978 tv serial
, 1981 movie
)
and the singing detective
( 1986
)
. the film follows potter ' s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip
- synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts
. he also follows the kind of sweet
and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct
, such as
" the umbrellas of cherbourg
"
and
" the young girls of rochefort
.
" the tale has resnais ' s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage
. it is a satire about class differences
and falling in lvoe with the wrong person
,
and that there isnt a song in everyone ' s heart for every occasion
. what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particluarly engaging characters
, the songs are nto memorable
annd stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience
( the exceptions might be the edith piaf
and maurice chevalier numbers
)
,
and the farce seems more banal than daring
.
yet it is not without its striking moments
adn charms
, such as when jane birkin does a cameo
and sings one ofthe her own songs
. also
, the glossy amberlike photography added a very french rumatic feeling to the story
, while the mood of paris as being a place for lveo to flourish above all else
, which has always been embellished iin movie lore
, comes through with flying colors
. it alsot does a good job of showing yuo the way paris is in the 1990s
and in the way ordinary people exist there
. it tells the romantic stry of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search forthe happiness
. they are thge attractive sisters odile
( sabine az
? ma
)
and camille
( agnes jaoui
)
, with hte older businesswoman odile married
and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts
. she is married to the glum
and laconic claude
( pierre arditi
)
. she once went out with a buisnessman
, nicolas
( jean
- pierre bacri
)
, who left her 8
- years ago
and now shows up in paris
and asks her help to find someone tothe rent a flat for his family
. simon
( andre dussolier
) works as a real
- estate salesman
annd is trying to find nicolas a flat
, in his spare time he writes radio plays
. simon ' s boss is the much younger
, unscrupulous
and arrogant marc duveyrier
( lambert wilson
)
, who inherited the firm from his father
and is the real
- estate agent selling a more luxurious
and larger flat whith a better view tothe odile
,
but fails to tell her taht a building project is going up soon that will block her view
. screenwriters
and actors jean
- pierre bacri
and agnes jaoui wrote themselfs the best parts
. jaoui ' s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph
. d
. in history
, using for her thesis the study of ' the yeomen inspite the year 1000 at lake paladru
. ' she works as a tour guide in the meantime
and suffers from panic attacks
, even
though she appears tothe have outwardly perfect self
- control
. on her tours fo the last four years has been the much older simon
, pretending to be doing research for his plays
but really attracted to her
,
but not having the nerve to tell her this
. to his dismay
, he finds out she is dating his mean
- spirited
but handsome boss
, whom she meets when looking at her sister ' s new place
and seeing him crying
but not realizing that it was from a cold
, not because he ' s so sensitive
. bacri as the classy nicolas
, turns out to be nowe working as a chauffeur
. he isnt a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors
, until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong whith him
. odile still pines for him
,
but he ' s married
, telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly
. love is ' the same old song ' that makes the world go ' round
, even wehn all the characters are liars
and not exactly open to what their true motives are
. everything comes toghether inaddition a bourgeois housewarming party for odile ' s place
, as the characters reveal their true feelings
and all their deceptions
and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be
. there ' s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical
,
but resnais has never made a bad film
and is one of the best current french directors
, if nto the best
. this film is not one his great ones
,
but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting
. it not only has an odd way for the characters tothe break into song
but
-
- some males even sing in a female voice while soem females sing infront a male voice
. it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters ' behaviour as being similar in business as in love
.
