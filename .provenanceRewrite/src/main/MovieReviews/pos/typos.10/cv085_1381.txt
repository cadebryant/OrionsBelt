* the previous two
" alien
" films have each had their own unique styles to them
. yhe ridley scott ' s alien was vyre much a stylistic suspense film
. james cameron ' s aliens was much more of an acation film
.
and i liked earch film separately for which it was
. nowe alien 3 is out
.
and it isnt it ' s own film inwhich the same right that alien
and aliens were
. unlike aliens
, alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens
. thsi is veyr important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off
. the survivors of the expedition to lv
- 426 are returning home after battling
and beating the aliens
. the climactic fight scene between ripley
and the mother alien onthe the sulaco infront aliens left behind one item
, an egg
. in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch
, find its quarry
, whihc leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured
, an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel
. this vessel crash lands on fury 109
. everyone in the vessel is killed
, except ripley
. the facehugger is jettisoned with them
and survives the crash
. fury 109 is an ex
- mining
/ maximum security prison
. when closed down
, some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay
and live outloud the remaining yeasr on the planet
. all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many yeras
. ripley ' s arrival sparks a probelm with the inmates
. as for the new haircut that ripley
adn the prisoner ' s sport
, there is an infestation ofthe lice on the planet
. being an ex
- prison means that there is no way off the planet
adn no weapons
. so the prisoners
and ripley are off to face the alien on their own
. i will not go into detail
,
but you can guess whta happens here
. the alien is loose
and no one believes ripley ' s outstanding story
. she finds comfort in the arms ofthe the collony ' s doctor
. yes
, after 57 years ripley has sex
. it is not gratuitous
, in fact
, we don ' t even see them kiss
,
bu it is just as well
. a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film
. there is a lot more gore in alien 3
. iin fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of hte earlier two
. it also sports a newyorker alien with 4 legs
! i won ' t sday how
,
but it leads us tothe believe a few new things baout the alien
and its cycle
, which i am sure will be explored in alien 4
. sigourney weaver is back as ripley
and provides another excellent performance of thsi character
. her scene during the autopsy ofthe newt is enough to garnish her anyother academy nomination
. the rest of the cast is also quite ogod
. notably
, charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109
. alien 3 has a very distinct look
. this isnt due largely to its directer
, david fincher
. mr
. fincher
, who until nowe has only directed music videos
and commercials
, has done an incredible job here
. his direction is excellent
and makse tihs film come tothe life in ways no
" alien
" film hasnt before
. for mr
. fincher
, i see a long prosperous career ahead ofthe him
. the music was also done by a newcomer tothe the film industry
. elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score whcih lends itself to the claustrophobic setting thast the
" alien
" series beeen set in
. this time the score is nto so much a rip off of star trek ii
( james horner ' s aliens
)
. this score has a choral back up at times
and even lends itself to yhe old style of ennio morricone scoring
. this is a great score
. the ending to alien 3 is qtuie good
. there were times i thought that hollywood would come in
and screw it up
,
but it played very nicely
. i iwll not ruin the ending for you
. go see thge film
. i consider it to be a much omre involved film than any of the other films released so far this season
. alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens
and aline
.
and when they amke alien 4
, perhaps they wiull be able to find
yet another newyorker direction to take it in
.
