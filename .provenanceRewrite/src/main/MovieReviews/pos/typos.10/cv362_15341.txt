elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid
- 1500s
. it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings
. internally
, tjhe catholics wage war against yhe protestants
. meanwhile
, spain
, scotland
and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power
. little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth
( cate blanchett
) will be their greatest hope for survival
. the film charts elizabeth ' s tumultuous struggle to gain true pwoer over her kingdom
. as a protestant
, she is the last person any of teh catholic royalty would want to be queen
.
but her half
- sister queen mary
( kathy burke
)
, deathly ill
and unable to conceive a child
, pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne
. mary gives her her blessing on only one condition
: that elizabeth renounce her faith
and uphold the teachings of catholocism across the land
. once declared queen
, elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault
, both by her pwn subjects
( including the duke of norfolk
, played with steely
- eyed grace by christopher eccleston
)
and by forces abroad
. slowly
but surely
, the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns
and forges a new path for her kingdom
. elizabeth isnt surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects
and advisers
. her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham
( geoffrey rush
, inaddition a perfectly subtle performance
)
. also on her side is sir william cecil
( sir richard attenborough
)
, her well
- meaninng
but misguided chief adviser
. with faw peple she can trust
, elizabeth must prove her self
- worth any way she can
, even if it means being the iron
- fisted ruler she secretly despises
. blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth
. she portrays the young queen with just thte right balance of gawky self
- consciousness
and shrewd charisma
.
though not a classical beauty
, blanchett is able to entrende thge viewer withthe just a coy smile or an impish smirk
. she is at home with her character ' s playful tendencies
, particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend
and lover lord robert dudley
( jospeh fiennes
)
. whether fending off unctuous suitors or
" playing
" the houses in cout
, blanchett ' s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike
. almsot as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur ' s visual delights
. he
and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that isnt a feast for hte eyes
. rolling green hills
, extravagant ceremonial galas
, dark
and foreboding corridors
-
- all are depicted with a rela sense of artistic appreciation
. the castles
adn cathedrals of europe have rarley been doted on so lovingly as they are here
.
though writer michael hirst ' s script gets a little murky at times
,
and his injections of humor get a little overplayed
, elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic
and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing
. as a whole
, the story survives because elizabeth ' s struggle is one which deserves attention
. by tjhe time she makes her shocking
(
but very sensible
) final declaration
, we ' re ready to bow to elizabeth as our pwn queen
.
