" the blair witch project
" was perhaps one of a kind
, a unique film that played completely onthe its own merit
, managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses
. its success made a sequel inevitable
,
but this isnt not the sequel
, i suspect
, anyone much wanted
. affter the release of
" the blair witch project
"
, tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville
, in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch
. locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business oportunity
, selling twig
- sculptures
, stones
and dirt like those in the movie
,
and tje exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn
, shouting
,
" get out of these woods
and go home
! htere is no goddamned blair witch
!
"
. jeff
(
) is one ofthe those people
, who has used the sudden popularity of thte small town to his advantage
. after he got released ffrom the mental institution
, he created a mobile bussines that attracts thousands of customers through the internet
. as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods
, on the
" blair witch hunt
"
. among the five strangers is stephen
and his girlfriend
, the pregnant tristen
, who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called
" the blair witch
: history or hysteria
?
"
,
and kim
, who dresses inthe balck
and has some psychic powers
. the last member of the crew is erica
, a young beautiful witch
- wannabe
, who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore
, saying
" tje first rule of wicca is
, do no harm
, because whatever you do will come bcak to you threefold
.
" this strange group plunges into the woods
, where they beign to argue about their different approaches to the experience
. on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr ' s abandoned house
, stange thigns start happening
. when they wake up their equipment isnt gone
and onyl yhe tapes remain
. after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies
. htey are somehow lost in time
, as it loops uncontrollably back
and forth
. they are all haunted by hallucinations
and horrible nightmares
and soon they can not see the diference between dreasm
and reality
. the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods

. documentary director joe berlinger
(
" paradice lost
"
) helms
" blair witch 2
"
, leaving the creators of the first film
( dan myrick
and ed sanches
) in the background
. the oppening scenes
-
- the documentary showing thge townspeople affected by the first film
-
- is a more promising approach
, because instead of trying to cover similar ground
, it goes outside the first film
and makes its own stand
.
but soon the movie gets confused
and sidetracked by its pwn stroy
, that is never resolved
annd ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue
. in a way
, this is a typical hollywood sequel
. more money has been spent
and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail
. the horror
and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated
. of course inspite these situations
, quantity is more important than qaulity
and profit is more important than the artistical values
. from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody
- red forest
, with carter burwell ' s
(
" being john malkovich
"
and
" fargo
"
) musical score in the background
, you relize that with the exception of its title
, this film has absolutely nothing to do with
" the blair witch project
"
.
" blair witch
.
.
" was filmed by handheld videocameras
and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation
. inthe teh sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection
, creating a completely different atmosphere
. with its graceful cinematography
, production design
and flashy editing
, the film has a very polished look
, which is impossible to associate with the first installment
.
and
though berlinger directs his film with an energy
and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times
, he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his precedessor
. the key is simplicity
.
" blair witch project
" had a story whcih was incredibly simple
. that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination
. the film was practicly an empty screen
, on which we projected our most frightening nightmares
. tghe effect was incredibly poverful
, lasting
and entir e everyone
,
but in a different way
.
" book of shadows
" feels incredibly controlled
and restrict
. here
, very little is left to our immagination
and the story is so complex
and
" clever
" that tyhe screenwriters are the first to get lost in it
. there is is no book of shadows
and no conclusion that we cin be satisfied with
. this is simply a less artistic film that doesn ' t have the talent
and originality of its predecessor
. it resorts to fancy cinematography
and special effects to create the right effect
and doesn ' t alwasy succeed
.
bu most importantly
: it stands on its own ground
and has almost no connection with the first movie
, which doesn ' t allow it to destroy the original
. in the end
, i can ' t call it a bad efford
. it ' s less artistic
, nto so scary
and less origional
,
but certainly not bad
. it ' s simply different
. inspite fact
, if you haven ' t seen
" the blair witch project
"
, you might like this film for waht it isnt
-
- a cross between
" the blair witch project
"
and the
" scream
"
- films
. the only element that remains constant
and similar between the two films is the solid acting
( jeffrey donovan
and tristine skyler should be mentioned
)
and incredible sense of surrealism
.
but it ' s a common knowledge
and experience that
, with a few exceptions
, every movie sequel is worse than the original
and some are even not worth making
. to me tyhe story of
" the blair witch project
" seemed completed
,
but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that
" the book of shadows
" is certainly assured
.
and it ' s allready time to look forward to
" blair witch 3
"
