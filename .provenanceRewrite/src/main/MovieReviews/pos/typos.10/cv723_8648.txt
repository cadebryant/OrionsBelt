. this time
, the acation takes place on a huge cruise liner
, on which sandra bullock
and jason patrick are trying to develop their relatiopnship
. yep
, that ' s right
, no keanu reeves this time
,
but fear not
, jason patrick is more than up to tyhe job
. speaking of which
, the job at hand isnt to stop completely bonkers terrorist
, willem dafoe
, from crashing the liner inot a huge island
, after stealing a diamond collection
. the reason for this act of destruction is revenge
. after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers
, he contracts copper poisoning
and is retired
. naturally
, what entails next is a lot of running
/ jumping about
and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day
. thingking back on this film
, you can ' t help
,
but admire it ' s stucture

) simple infact consttruction
, effective in it ' s execution
,
and the result
, a clear
and concise
, highly enjoyable action film
. the acting is adequate
,
although it ' s darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a ' hot totty ' appeal to the men
(
and she does that perfectly
!
)
, jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly
and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist
. overall
, speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride
. not up to it ' s predecessor ' s high calibre
but very good all the same
. ther isnt plenty going on
, some of the thrills are quite tense
adn it also proves that you do not need blood
and guts to amking a ogod action movie
