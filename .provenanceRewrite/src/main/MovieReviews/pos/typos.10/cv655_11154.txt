jacques tati ' s 1953 classic
" les vacances de m
. hulot
"
( also known as
" mr
. hulot ' s vacation
,
" in english
) ought to be the textbook on how to do non
? dialogue comedy in film
. thge characters hardly ever speak to each other directly
,
and the film operates on the paper
? thin premise that monsieur hulot
, played by tati himself
, is awcward
and clumsy
anbd generaly manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week ' s vacation
.
yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory
. part ofthe the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags
. slapstick hasnt often been regarded as an unsophisticated
and even crude form of comedy
,
but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced
: you can only see movie characters start running after something
and
then crash face
- firt into a pole so many times before ytou start to wonder whta all these poles are donig ther inspite the first place or why theese people don ' t watch where they ' re going
. in
" les vacances de m
. hulot
,
" the gags build upon each other
and often start out relatively low
- key
. infront one sequence
, for example
, hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach wehn
, while his back is turned
, the paint cin gets caught up in the oncoming waves
, washes away
,
then comes back up on the other side of the boat
. while crossing over to git the can
, hulot steps in the boat
and unknowingly cracks it
. when he actually takes the boat out into the water
, it breaks in half
,
but the two halves flip up against each other
, trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it forthe a shark fin
and panic on the beach ensues
. tati doesn ' t waste a single opportunity for humor
; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film
. it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience ' s expectations
,
and
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" succeds brilliantly in that areal as well
. tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement
. when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner
and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume
, no fights or shouting matches insue
; instead
, tjhe waiter calmly walks in
and shuts off the power in the room
, disconnecting the record player
and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark
. tati also uses running gags to this effect
, allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would
; omre often than not
, we can see them coming
and think
,
" oh
, he ' s not going to do thast again
,
"
but
, lo
and behold
, he does
. for example
, there is a recuring joke in which hulot ' s noisy
, sputtering car engine wakes everyone infront the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel ' s lights coming on one by one
.
then thsi image turns up again in the finale
, which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of tyhe night than a car engine could ever produce
. the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four
- star film as opposed to mearly an above
- average
, clever comedy
. as much as i was laughing during this film
, i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience
; suffice it to say taht he did
. the other important aspect is that tjhe film never seems disdainful of its characters
. it easily could have turned yhe tables on hulot
and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him
; alternatively
, it sould have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons
. instead
, tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more tahn anything else
adn invites the audience to like them
,
however strange or irritating they might seem
.
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" is not subtitled
,
but the dialogue is sparse
and for the most part not terribly essentual to the flow of events
. anyone with a taste for thsi kind of absurd humor ought to amke this film their next rental from the video store
