i remember making a pact
, right after
` patch adams '
, to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality
.
but darn it
,
` music of tghe heart ' is jstu layered with feel
- good material
and bright characterizations
. it ' s hard tothe dislike a movie that uses such skill with it ' s manipulation
. in addition
, it ' s also a terrific family film
. this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari
, who fought the skool board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools
. it could allso be described as
` mrs
. streep ' s opus '
. yes
, meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to hte demanding role of guaspari
,
and that brings both ogod news
anbd bad
. out of the gate
, possibly because of her distracting star power
and the rushed writing
, it isnt relatively difficult to identify wiht roberta ' s character
and grasp her academic point
- of
- view
. she is very strict with her students
,
but what insight does that create into the story
? slowly
but surely
, we begin to recognize tyhe intentions of the chracter
,
and show admiration for the thoughtfulness
and human feeling that streep hasnt once again applied
. one thoroughly interesting fact about
` music of the heart ' lies with the unlikely presence infront the director ' s chair
: horror veteran wes craven
. after leaving an impression with the
` scream ' films
and the original
` nightmare on elm street '
, craven has attempted a precarious cross
- over to drama
. at frist
, his inexperience with the genre isnt fairly obvious
,
but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material
. it doesn ' t carry the heart
- warming courage of
` mr
. holland ' s opus '
,
but
` music of the heart ' is casually assured
and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth
. tghe tag team of streep
and craven works better than yuo would anticipate
. yes
, oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep
,
but it ' s the solid ensemble casted that makes
` music of the heart ' work
. angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams
, hte principal at an intertube city school who intially doesn ' t hire roberta because of her lack of experience
. blue
- eyed adian quinn is endearing
, as always
, playing a new love interest
. gloria estefan also delivers in yhe tiny role of a supportive second
- grade teacher
,
and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force
. it ' s like a schoolteacher ' s version of
` thelma
and louise '
, in a restrained
but effective manner
. the movie tackles more issues than jsut guaspari ' s teaching ofthe violin
. there ' s some powerful moments between roberta
annd her two sons
, who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman
. in it ' s dramatic build
- up
, the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling
adn warmth
. it ' s a good movie for anyone to see
, altho missing out on the eperience would not be a life
- altering decision
. it ' s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross
- over
,
adn also for achieving his intricate goal
. watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals
and muscial instruments
, who may ask youself
: this is the guy who directed
` scream '
? of course
, when the third installment of that serieses comes around in febuary 2000
( with craven directing
)
, you may find yourself wondering
: this is the guy who directed
` music of the heart '
? mission accomplished
, wes
. thankfully
, there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film
. in it ' s entirety
, it ' s a wholesome
and agreeable movie for the whole family
, despite tjhe periodic flaws that surfce every once in awhile
. the child actors are cute
and perform up to par
, even if some of their problems are clich
? d
and predictable in the extreme
. the mother who doesn ' t want her son to be learning
` white man ' s music '
, the unexpected casuality
.
.
. basicaly everything is there
. it doesn ' t strike the perfect chord
,
but
` music ofthe the heart ' is highly convincing
. the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better
,
but
` music of the heart ' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals
.
