probably the most popular
and praised film of all time
, turned out to be a primitive
and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism
. everyone knows about the greatest
and most famous shipping disaster of all time
.
and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron
, combining visual
-
and sound effects
, he re
- creates the frightening atmosphere of hte sinking ship in the middle of nowhere
. i liked very much the emotional
and brutal contrast between the first
and the third classes
. while their cabin is slowly filling up with water
, a mother is telling her children a fairytail
-
-
"
.
.
and they lived happily ever after
.
.
"
.
annd
then the ship goes down
and the few survivors are left alone under the stars
and the chilling air
.
however
, the actual disaster is happening almost at the end ofthe the movie
, while the first two hours are just beautiful sets
and bad dialogues
. inspite the present day
, the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
, a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond
, lost during the sinking
. somewhere inside the ship
, lovett ' s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead
. here
, in the shape of a nude young lady
, is a window into the distant age of 1912
. lovett is extremely surprised when he get ' s a phone call from rose dawson
, claiming that she is a model
. she is immediatly helicoptered onto the vessel
,
and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years
. as the memories come flooding back
, she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer
( kate winslet
)
, the fianc
? e of wealthy cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater
( frances fisher
)
. on board there are rich
and poor
, everyone trust in the ship ' s designer
( jonathan hyde
)
and her master
, captain e
. j
. smith
( bernard hill
)
. on board the ship
, rose
, unhappy
and restless meets jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
- a young american artist
, poor
, brave
and attractive
. a love story slowly emerges
and the two lovers must not only experience the diference between the social classes
,
but also face the greatest power on earth
- death
. cameron could as well have called his picture
" the never ending love
" or
" love at first sight
"
, as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple
,
and not on the disaster itself
. the plot is anything
but original
and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap
- opera
. the director doesn ' t even try to overcome his empty script
. because of its primitive
and predictable plot
, titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking
. russel carpenter ' s rich
, majestic
and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award
- worthy
. everything from art direction tothe visual
and sound effects are a top notch
.
but it doesn ' t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them
. the actors are not to blaim
, because their characters are moreso liuke caricatures
, in other words
- fake
. jack is a man with many talents
: he is a talented artist
, handsome
, brave
, honest
, storng
, funny
.
.
. you name it
. he doesn ' t have any dark side
, he doesn ' t mkae any mistakes
, that for a second would make him human
. jack is perfect
,
but he is
- poor
. on the other hand we have cal
. he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque
and not as his wife
- tothe
- be
. he lacks everything jack possesses
,
but he is
-
- rich
. tihs childish contrast between the social classes is one of thsoe things that makse titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture
. cameron knows precisely waht we want tothe see
. his film therefore contains certian minimums to draw an audience
- attractive actors
, a
" tradgic love story
"
, beautiful visuals
( including expensive special effects
)
, a dose of social criticism
, a fascinating historical event
( we love true stories
)
and last
,
but not least
- an incredible media support
, which proclaimed an average picture the
" greatest film of all time
"
. on the outside titanic looks perfect
,
but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals
- is emptiness
- nothing to think about
. the main weakness of this film
, which ironically became its success
, is simplicity
. cameron enables our basic
and if you wish
- primitive emotions
: love
, hate
, fear
and helplessness
. everyone understands the power of love
and the threat to our beautiful couple isnt likewise imaginable
- a sinking ship
. titanic is a typical hollywood production
, totally
and completelyl dependent on visual perfection tothe hide its primative plot
. it ' s a good picture
,
but absolutly not a masterpiece
. it ' s among hundreds
and thousands good films released every year
, not better or worse than tyhe average american film
.
