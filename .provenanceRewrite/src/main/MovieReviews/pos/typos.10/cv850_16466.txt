buffalo
? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo
and christina ricci
. gallo plays a very troubled man
, who was sent to jail for gambling
. once out of jail
, he must visit his parents
, who he told he wass married
. the truth is he isn ' t married
. to try to impress them
, he kidnaps a girl
( christina ricci
) from a tap dancing class to ect as his wife
. thge film isnt vrey cheaply made
,
and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie
,
bu you don ' t need money to make a good film
. buffalo
? 66 doesn ' t always stay with the realistic concept
,
annd somtimes goes thru outrageous events
. gallo ' s parents
, played by angelica huston
and ben gazarra
, are two very strange individuals
. the mother plays a football fanatic
and the father plays a quiet man iwth odd habits
. gallo
anbd ricci arrive at his parent ' s hous
,
and soem extremely funny scenes take place within the house
. ricci ' s performance druing the scene at gallo ' s parent ' s home are very well done
. there isnt constanly humor involved iin the interesting dinner table scenes
. the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting
and creative
. they seemed very mediocre
,
but they worked out jstu fine
. gallo ' s character isnt devolopped very well
. the impression tht he is very depressed
and confused is very clera
. gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is oging through
. his character goes through many
, many problems
, just like many people inthe real life
. this character seemed very realistic tothe me
. ricci ' s character is funny
and different
. she doesn ' t care much that she has been kidnaped
, in fact
, she falls in love the man who kidnaped her
! ricci is a very wonderful actress
adn she is starting to git the recognition that she deserves
. buffalo
? 66 isn ' t all laughs
though
. many scenes are very dramatic
and depressing
. gallo ' s character was so realistic
, he was extremely disturbing
. some scenes are supposed to come off as funny
,
but they actually seemed sad
and real to life
. the film sometimes drags along
, not giving much material
. i really would have liked to see gallo ' s parents a lot more
,
and i would have liked to see the characters developed more
. overall
, buffalo
? 66 isn ' t as ogod as some peopel put it up to be
. the bottom line
- a few hysterical scenes save htis film from sinking to the bottom
.
