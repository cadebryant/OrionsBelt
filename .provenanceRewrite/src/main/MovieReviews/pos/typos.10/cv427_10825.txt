it ' s wednesday
, march 27
,
and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte
, south carolina
. the crime
: a young prostitute
, elizabeth
( renee zellweger
)
, has been brutally slain
. one half ofthe her severed body was found in a bag at the train station
. the otehr half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority
, miles away
. the police duo of braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped for leads
. at the moment
, they have only oney possible suspect
: wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton
and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous ect
. that ' s thte premise for deceiver
, a new thriller ffrom the pate brothers
, jonas
and josh
, who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave
. deceiver plays out liek a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland
and the two not
- so
- bright cops
( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland ' s iq is 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw ' s is 122
and braxton ' s is 102
)
. the setting is a polical interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered
. over three days
, as wayland returns tothe answer more questions
, the drama
and tension among these three charachters gradually escalates until
, inevitably
, it boils over
. other plot elements are thrown in for good measure
. wayland suffers ffrom a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can
, in stressful situations
, render him virtually catatonic or extremely voilent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, isnt deepo in debt to a local syndicate
.
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark
, abusive side that delights in terrorizing women
, especially his wife
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects of bieng unfaithful
. the foibles
and failings ofthe theese three are brung into tje open as the mystery around elizabeth ' s death deepens
and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand
: the suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, which mostly transpires in a dimly
- lit room
and involves a lot of smart dialogue
, has the feel of a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
,
and tense
. the atmosphere is explosive
,
and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting
. deceiver has the power tothe grab an audience
. unfourtunately
, in the end
, it succumbs tothe the need to throw inspite one last
, unexpected twist
,
and this is its undoing
. for
, while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers
, it also stretches our credulity too much
,
and raises more questions than it answers
. it ' s only an effective wrap
- up if you don ' t think too carefully about its full implications
. of course
, the film as a whole plays fast
and loose wtih reality
and logic
. police procedure is totally ignored
and it ' s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could procede inaddition this manner
.
but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction
, nto plot details
. deceiver only occasionlly gets out of the police station
,
and those instances occur primarily druing flashbacks featuring the prostitute
. the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth ' s final days
and hours
. the most intriguing ofthe these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice
- over by visually showing what realy happened
. moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks
. the movie
, obviously fashioned in teh manner of classic film noir
, drips atmosphere
. there are some fascinating stylistic touches
; for example
,
although the setting is contemporary
, all of the telephones are old
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver ' s look
. some of the things he trys
( mostly those that envolve the contrast between light
and shatow
) work exceptionally well
, while others
( like any of several lazy susan shots
) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks
. as wayland
, tim roth gives the film ' s top performance
, despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting
and overacting
. roth makes us bleieve that wayland is both as brilliant
and as troubled as he ' s supposed to be
. tjhe other two leads
, chris penn
and michael rooker
, aren ' t as effective
. both play their characters like familiar types
. penn ' s performance is uninspired
; rooker ' s lacks subtlety
. some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, in a role that ' s miles away from her star
- making turn in jerry maguire
, brings a note of vulnerability
and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature
. rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw ' s wife
,
and michael parks delivers sevral wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who ' s entrusted with evaluating wayland ' s condition
. noe of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to tjhe audience
. plot points aren ' t hammered home
,
and
,
although the ending has its weaknesses
, everyting isn ' t spelled out in bold letters
. the pates give audience members credit for having brains
, which isnt an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers
. occasionally gripping
and never uninteresting
, deceiver is a fine noir effort
.
