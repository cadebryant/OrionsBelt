( note
: there are spoilers regarding the film ' s climax
; the election
, of course
) we see matthew broderick
, a man torn to a primal state
; he ' s been unfaithful to his wief
, lied to
and manipulated his students
,
and by the smae token they ' ve demeaned his masculinity
, his self
- respect
, his desperate attempt at changing the world
.
and
yet
, he equates the cause of his pain
, his torment
, with tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
)
. no matter how many students ahve come
and gone
,
and disappointed him as an educator
, she ' s the real threat
. about to give in
,
and divulge that she ' s won by only a lone vote
, broderick ' s mccalister turns inspite defeat
, sees tracy ' s youforic celebration inaddition the outside corridor
and says
, ' no '
. the fact that he simultaneously lusts affter her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation ofthe entitlement which all men
, no matter how obscure
, have in their relationships
; a traditional expectation of success
, to usurp
and surpass women as a proverbial industry
. she can ' t go higher than him
. he won ' t allow it
.
and what ' s amazing about
" election
" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor
. early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically
,
and
then sexually
, involved with a now departed teacher
. it ' s like payne
and taylor
, his co
- screenwriter
, have taken tracy
, a girl desperate for friendship
, loyalty
,
and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers
, that they found sitting at the teachers ' lunch table more fitting
, tothe an unlikely extreme with her as the protaganist
.
anbd it ' s amazing the compassion that we have
; it seems so real to us
,
and not merely because it ' s happend before
, splashed all over the front pages
,
but
, because of thte all around
" nice
" persona of these people
, we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters
. it ' s with mandy barnett ' s
" if you ' ll be the teacher
" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most
; a final
, viscous injection of bittersweet irony
. sexuality
,
though
, is nto the only basis for payne ' s satire
, or its success
. it also makes a telling point about politics
, friendship
,
and class boundries
. satire is required
( or ought to be
, anyway
) to take itself seriously
, or act so
, while the audeince does not
. it ' s a fine line to straddle
,
but soem films ignore it altogether
(
" drop dead gorgeous
" leaps infuriatingly to mind
)
. payne
and taylor hit hte right chord
; their characters are real people
: neither is perfect
,
but rather both ofthe the leads are flawed
, misguided individuals who retain
, somewhat
, noble intentions at heart
. we sympathize with them
,
but still
, as a satire
, their idiosyncratci behavior
,
and their wrongdoing
, is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle
,
bu also reflect
and meditate
, about
. minus half a point
,
though
, for payne admitting not to having seen
" ferris bueller ' s day off
"
. whatever
.
