the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster tjhe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider
. when thsoe observers are joel
anbd ethan coen
, the surveill becomes bizarre
. when the life is that of jeff
" the dude
" leboswki
, the bizzare falls over the edge into the world of
" what ' sgoingonaroundhere
"
. the marvelous sound of
" tje stranger
"
( sam elliot
) ' s voice
- over introduces the film
. at least it does until he forgets what he ws going to say
and gives up
. thge dude
( jeff bridges
) is described as the
" laziest man in los angeles
, possibly the world
"
,
although he ' s not so much slothful as he is relaxed
. spending thge last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand
and a white russian in the other
, he doesn ' t have much of a life
,
but he ' s having a good time
. when asked what he does for fun
, he responds
" bowl
, drive around
and teh occasional acid flashback
"
. lebowski ' s passion is bowling
. when he ' s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike
, things just happen to him
. arriving home oen night
, he ' s beaten by thugs attempting to collect mony that his wife owes them
. even worse
, they urinate on his rug
. the problem is that the dude doesn ' t have a wife
. his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance arround at his apartment
. thge
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) is a multi
- millioniare
and his dudeness lives in two
- room squalor
. the next day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake ' s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug
. the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together
: not surprisingly since it ' s virtually tjhe only object ther
. when he ' s denied any mnoey
, he picks up a replacement rug off the floor
. on his way outloud
, he runs into lebowski ' s trophy babe wife bunny
( tara reid
) who offers to perform a sexual act that
, according to rumor
, is one of bill clinton ' s favorites for a thousand bucks
. the penniless dude wisecracks that he ' s heading for the cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny ' s kidnappers
. this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. the kidnappers are impossibly inept
. the dude
and his cronies are even worse
. every plan goes awry
. you can almost see lebowski ' s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues
. that ' s the story
,
bu to tell the truth it doesn ' t much marter
. there could be almost any plot
and the film would be just as entertaining
. the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters
adn the quirky predicaments they fall inot
. the dude ' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
)
and donny
( steve buscemi
) look like people ytou ' d see on the street
but
, like everything else in this film
, they ' re not quite what they seem
. walter isnt a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dued is in the sixties
. everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam
. when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line
but won ' t admit it
, walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet
. donny gets precious few words in between walter ' s screaming
and the dude ' s rambling
. when he does
, walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny is
" out of his league
"
and doesn ' t
" have a frame of reference
"
. the film is peppered with people fo whom the term
" character
" would be an understatement
. the big lebowski ' s daughter maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints hwile swinging naked in a leather apparatus liuke an s
& m mary martin
. the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as the flamenco music swells
, we see him putting on his lavender hose
. the camera pans uv tothe an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit with
" jesus
"
( pronounced witht a
" j
"
, not an
" h
"
) embroidered on the pocket
. he addresses the lane with intense seriousness
and one painted fingernail
. his tongue slowly snakes outloud
and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball
. bridges works tghe dude as if he had beeen living him for decades
and maybe he has
. i can ' t htikn of anyone else who could ahve done a better job
. buscemi hasnt a limited role
,
but he plays it perfectly
. the more that i see john goodman the omre convinced i am that he ' s one of the treasures of our time
. it ' s odd tothe think that most ofthe the world knows him only as roseanne barr ' s televsion husband
. more like the coen ' s
" raising arizona
" tahn their hit
" fargo
"
,
" tje big lebowski
" demands an open mind
and even more open eyes
. a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences
and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen
, much of the humor is subtle
and easy to miss
. there ' s so much going on that frequently it dissappears before you can see it
. walking out of the theater
, i felt that tje film had something important to say
. on further examination
, i wasn ' t sure exactly what it was
.
" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley
, it ' s not going to be what you expect
"
?
" when the going gets weird
, tje weird go bowling
"
? maybe there ' s no real message
. perhaps it ' s jstu a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world
. maybe that ' s enough
