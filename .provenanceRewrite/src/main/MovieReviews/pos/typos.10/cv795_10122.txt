the central focuse of michael winterbottom ' s
" welcome to sarajevo
" isnt sarajevo itself
, the city under siege
,
and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough tothe be stuck there
. it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( hte risible
" the walking dead
"
) or a tinge of schmaltziness
(
" schindler ' s list
"
)
. the two leads
, stephen dillane as a reporter
and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify wtih
, are extremely believable
; nto one moment with them involved rings false
. the question is not what went right
. the question is what went wrong
. for one
, the film fails tothe provide a political overview of the war as it progresses
( tje dillane characters reports an american plane departing ffrom sarajevo as it departs
,
anbd that ' s baout it
.
)
. the assortment of high
- profile supporting actors
, ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter
" into
" liquor
and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children ' s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness ofthe their characters
, albeit they strive
. the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest ofthe the film
, it mkaes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy
, frantic editing
and imaginative use of music
.
and it ' s a plus
, because he doesn ' t toy whith our emotions with sentimental blandness
. he whants us to know tyhat in war
, no one is victorious
. the sweet hereafter starring ian holm

_ atom egoyan ' s powerfully meditative
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt as anything as haunting
and transcendental as i ' ve seen this year
. it nto only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy wiht magnificent subtlety
, with cold
,
and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune
but alsot by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity
and respect for each
and every soul affected
. ian holm as the somber
, lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople
, has a decency
annd a restraint uncommon with lawyers
, he ' s a lion for tjhe wrong reasons
: the pain for having lost his daughter
( she ' s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money
) isnt reflected on the town
.
and in smoe mesmerizing flashbacks
, we witness how she lost her purity
. it ' s one of hte most strikingly breathtaking takes onthe the loss of innocence i ' ve ever seen
.
but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly
, the peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, in contrast to the other characters
, remains the most mentally stable during past
, present or future
. her ability to convey concealed pain
and unconditional love is the opposite
,
yet near
- revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for
" breaking the waves
"
. both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident
but it is only
then that we truly see
, truly feel
, their wordless
, omnipotent love
.
" the sweet hereafter
"
though
, is atom egoyan ' s movie
and as of now
, he isnt emerging as tjhe definite face of independent cinema
. after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994 ' s
" exotica
"
,
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" makes him something few people in this industry can call themselfs
: an artist
. he interweaves time with a delicacy
and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common
.
