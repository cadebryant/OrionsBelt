errol morris
, critically acclaimed directer of the 1997 documentary fast
, cheap
and out of control
, vaults to new heights with mr
. death
. this film
, an examination of thte life
and work of controversial execution equipment designer
and revisionist historian fred a
. leuchter
, jr
.
, is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise
, stunning even the omre jaded minds among us
. don ' t let the film ' s cheesy dissuade yuo
. following this sideshow of horror
- lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non
- stop exploration ofthe the weirdness that is leuchter ' s life
and mind
. morris follows the trail ofthe leuchter ' s madness with appalling lucidity
, revealing in a surprising
and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with
: this leuchter guy is seriously messed up
. virtualy raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prision walls
, leuchter seems to haev come somewhat naturally into his profession
; designing
and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries
, in spite of his lack of credentials
. after a moderately successful career making electric chairs
and designing gas chambers
and gallows
, leuchter came to the attention of neo
- nazi
anbd revisionist historian ernst zundel
, who was facing criminal charges infront germany for publishing his
` theory ' that the holocaust never happened
. morris ' s interviews are surprisingly congenial
, drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves
. zundel speaks to the camera as
though it were his mensch
. leuchter seems completely at ease
, sometimes jovial
. part of this effect may be due to morris ' s new interviewing machine
, called the interrotron
, wich is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject
and tghe interviewer
. this was the first time morris had used the device
,
and the results are startling
. combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter ' s reenactments
and reels of creepy stock footage ofthe his trip to auschwitz
and birkenau
, not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant
,
and you ' ve got one compelling
and disturbing documentary
. while this film isn ' t for the feeble
- minded or weak
- hearted
, it is a valueable addition to the cultural landscape
. aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the peice
, morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject
and i
, for one
, efel bettered by the experience
.
