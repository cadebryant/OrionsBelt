hollywood is a pimp
. a fat
, cigar
- smoking chump wearing a fur hat
and 12 gold chains around its fat
, hairy chest
. all of its stars
and starlets are an evil brood of scum
- sucking vampires looking for the next percentage take
, the next summer blockbuster
, the next casting couch to audition on
. pumping out comic
- book adaptations
, terrible sequels to mediocre films
,
and remakes of foreign films to the nearest american movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls
and bad sound systems
. how much longer cxan the works of peckinpah
, fassbinder
, fuller
, castle
, preminger
,
and lee be placed
and forgotten inaddition the wrong sections of the local blockbuster stores
? how many more silver
and weinstein films cin we enduring in this stinky
, decaying state of american cinema
?
but now
, from john
" i don ' t give a shit what you think baout my movies
" waters
, comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers
and aficionados
: cecil b
. demented
, a warped
and twisted tale of how far a filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal
and social revolution
. stephen dorff
, in a career
- defining role
, is cecil b
. demented
, a crazed director devoted to making the most radical undreground film
. together with his film production cult
, the sprocket holes
- who wear tattoos of peckinpah
, lee
, fuller
, castle
, anger
, fassbinder
, preminger onthe varous parts of their bodies as badges of honor
, they kidnap a hollywood movie starlet
, played with perfect ridiculousness by melaine griffith
,
and force her to take the starring role in demented ' s film
. iwth no budget
and noone contracts for extras
, demented
and his crew tkae to the streets for production of raving beauty
, a crass terrorist film about an angry owner of an independent theater
and her brood out tothe destroy the mainstream film business
. using
" ultimate reality
"
- with real bullets
, real people
,
and real terror
- demented
and his crew of misfits attack a mall theater
, terrorize the maryland film commission
and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel tothe a really annoying tom hanks film
. demented ' s crewmembers are maimed
adn killed
, popcorn machines are used for target practice
,
and noone one can have sex until the film is complete
. it ' s like bowfinger
, onyl
, you know
, good
. the film moves with zigs
and zags like tje magic bullet of kennedy ' s assassination
. the zeal of demented ' s cause catches quickly
and conveys the urgent message of
" doing something
, anytying
, for tje accomplishment of artistic motivations
.
" the crewmembers all hold the quirkiness common in water ' s previous films
- pink flamingos
, hairspray
, polyester
, pecker
-
-
and speak in the choppy
, jaded dialogue used frequentily by waters
. it is as if water ' s scirpt strips away the unnecessary dialogue common to most pretentious indie films
and just delivers the goods
. cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it might actually outdo itself
. you cant see how a major studio might take this film
, re
- edit it
, cut a deal with the remaining crew members who are still alive
,
and make a few sequels
, a la the blair witch project
.
but that ' s for the future
. overall
, the ride is fantastic
; it ' s one of water ' s best films to date
and this year ' s fight club for filmmakers
