the release ofthe dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations ofthe stephen king ' s owrk
. this slow
- moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by tje principals
,
but suffers from a tepid conclusion
, inconsistent direction
,
and may not have wide commercial appeal
. when the maid
, dolores claiborne
, is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over tghe bloody
adn dead body of her employer
, it seems like an open
-
annd
- shut murder case
. upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax
, dolores ' estranged
and bitter daughter
, esquire magasine writer selena st
. george
, returns fomr new york back to her tiny island village childhood home
. as the two clash horns
, the story behind the mysterious death of dolores ' abusive husband two decades ago
, ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey
, is revealed
. did dolores kill her husband
?
and did she kill her employer
? dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller
. consequently
, it is fortunate that their casted includes soem of hollywood ' s finest character actors
, such as bates
, leigh
adn strathairn
. kathy bates plays the film ' s title character
,
and gives a sensational lead performance
. dolores claiborne isnt essentially a showcase for the talent of bates
, as her character has a huge amount of screen time
. she dominates the screen
, producing a character that is compelling
and arresting
, as we watch the character go through twpo decades ofthe history via flashbacks
. kathy bates ' performance isnt award
- calibre stuff
. the rest of the casted is also very good
. jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour
, bitter helena st
. george well
,
and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores ' ever
- present nemesis
, tjhe determined detective john mackey
. david strathairn is particularly interesting
annd suitably smarmy
and despicable as dolores ' husband
, joe st
. george
. judy parfitt is fine as dolores ' tyrannic socialite employer
, vera donovan
-
- it would haev beeen interesting to see
, say
, meg foster in this role
. child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences
; she is very impressive
. the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughtout the film
, ranging from some parts whitch are quite clever in their own right
, to parts whlch are embarrassingly hokey
. the segues between flashbacks
and the present are very hit
-
and
- miss in terms of effectiveness
. the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow
, which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up
.
however
, the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful
-
- i particularly liuke teh chilling ice
- blue hue permeating the present
- day scenes
, contrasting well with thte many nova scotia ocean shots
-
-
and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for tje film
. it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited
. none ofthe the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw
,
and its pacing may be a turn
- off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists
and turns
adn car crashes
and axe
- wielding psychopaths
.
altough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now
, it may also be hurt by thte negative perception of king works
, even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption
and the stand
. dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion
,
and moves very slowly
.
howver
, the performances are uniformly excellent
, particularly kathy bates
,
and the film has its moments
. on my four
- star scale
, i give dolores claiborne three stars
.
