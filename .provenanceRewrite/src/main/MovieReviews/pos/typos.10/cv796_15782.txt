after the averege mouse hunt
, the silly small soldiers
and the entertaining antz
, dreamworks try again with the children ' s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses stoy
. as the film warns us at the beginning
, it ' s not the full story
,
and some liberties have been taken
,
bu generally this the bible story we all know
and love
, featuring burning bushes
, the plagues
and the parting of the red sae
. the only thing missing is charlton heston
. instead
, we get val kilmer voicing moses
, an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother
and rescued by the queen of egypt
( helen mirren
.
) we flash forward several years tothe see moses
and brother rameses
( fiennes
) all grown up
. moses soon finds out from brother
and sister miriam
and aaron
( sandra bullock
and jeff goldblum
) that he isn ' t really the son of the pharoah seti
( patrick stewart
)
and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule
. he soon sets about this
, along with his wief tzipporah
( michelle pfeiffer
.
) rameses
and his twpo wizard friends
( voiced by steve martin
and martin short
) try to stop moses completing his task
. while the plot is familiar
adn somewhat exciting for adults
, for children reared on aladdin
and hercules
, this film coudl be the most godawful thing they ' ve ever seen
. gone isnt the quick fire humour
and standard
, easy to follow plot
.
but
, spectacularly
,
and to dreamworks credit
, nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story
and events happening on screen
. jeffrey katzenberg
, who produced this film
, certainly knows how to keep a child interested
. he ' s included some songs in the film
, plus some comedy
,
and a exciting chariot chase
, tothe keep the children interested
.
adn somehow
, himself
anbd the directors still manage to get all the drama
anbd intensity of the story across
, without ever being boring
. it ' s a remarkable achievement
. also remarkable is the animation
, which puts hercules
, an almost ' slap dash ' effort
, to shame
. relying onthe hand drawn
and computer animation
, the backgrounds
and characters are amazingly detailed
. the film seems a little caught up with it ' s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals
and ' moving ' shots
,
but they
_ dont
_ look incredible
. the final ' plague ' where god kills every first born child
,
and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be beleived
. kudos to the animators
. the vocal talent isnt also vrey good
. val kilmer does a fine job as moses
(
although he doesn ' t sing
)
and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses
(
and he
_ does
_ sing
.
) sandra bullock
and jeff goldblum are great
,
and steve martin
adn martin short are very ogod
,
bu not in the film long enough
. finally
, michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife
. kudos also goes to the voice of god
, who instead of booming
annd bombastic is quiet
and subdued
. sadly
, he is uncredited
,
and i couldn ' t quite work out who the voice was
.
(
but e
- mail if you do
.
) the songs are good
, ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big prodcution number
. they don ' t disturb the movie
,
and while not particularly memorable
, they are nice to listen to
( they ' re well sung aswell
.
) the musical score is suitably epic
, with some beautiful tunes
. coupled whith the superb visuals
, the prince of egypt is a visual
and aural treat
, backed up with a great story
. entertaining both for kids
and adults
, tihs film is a must see
. a david wilcock review
? 1998
" you know
, for kids
