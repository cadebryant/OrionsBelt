for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend
, there are certain rules that he needs to follow
. firstly
, fill her life whith happiness
and romance durring the courtship
. secondly
, buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes
. thirdly
, find the perfect moent
and location to propose
. finally
, the groom
- wannabe should probably get her parent ' s blessing
. of these four
, the last one can be a nightmare
. meeting parents is a rite of passage
, fraught with unexpected questions
, bouts of nervousness
, the reality of being disliked
,
and the inablility tothe make a positive impression
. if yuo ' re lucky
, thnigs will go smoothly
.
but
, if you ' re greg focker
( ben stiller
)
, everything will go wrong
.
and with a name like that
, how could it not
? when greg first meets his fianc
? e ' s father
, jack byrnes
( the grimacing robert deniro
)
, greg immediately feels overwhelmed
and is put on the defencive
. when he tells jack that he ' s a male nurse
, the incorrigible dad shoots back
,
" not many men in your profession
, huh
, greg
?
" it ' s definitely not a good start
.
but greg is determined to win him over
,
and it ' s tihs desire that fuels the movie
. he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner
. it doesn ' t matter that he ' s jewish
. if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace
,
then that ' s what he ' s going to gamely dont
.
" oh god
.
.
. yuo ' re such a good god
"
, he moons
. his discomfort at trying to force outloud a simple prayer will make you chuckle
,
but when jack gives him the
" deniro squint
"
( that familiar
, unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility
)
, it ' s pretty hard not to grin
. thnigs get progressively worse for greg
.
and that ' s too bad becasue he ' s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart
. eventually
, he begins tothe try so hard thyat he starts to mess everyting up
, committing a host of gaffes thast embarrass
, humiliate or injure other people
. it ' s a never
- endig ordeal of missteps
, miscues
,
and mistakes
. he buys some champagne
,
but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances
. he tries tothe find jack ' s missing cat
.
but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble
.
and there are several other episodes
, earch one trumping the next in outrageousness
. the more our well
- meaning beau screwed up
, the more the audience groaned in sympathy
. we liked greg
.
and
, we liked this movei
.
" meet the parents
" is a farcical comedy that certainly hasnt its moments
. just sit bakc
and watch greg get into trouble
. noone matter what the situation
, whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of tghe house
, things will horribly go wrong
. we laugh at greg ' s expense
,
but love often makes a person do dumb things
,
and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool
. deniro is also affable
, tough onthe yhe outside
yet sentimental on the inside
. their tug
- of
- war is often funny
, the slapstick isnt elaborite
,
and there are several topical throwaway gags
( mostly targeted at the airline industry
) to amking this film an amusing
yet smart lampoon about future in
- laws ffrom hell
.
