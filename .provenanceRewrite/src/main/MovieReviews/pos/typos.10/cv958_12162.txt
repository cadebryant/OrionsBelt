the calendar year has not even reached its midway point
,
but that hasn ' t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish perido drama more befitting of the winter oscar
- bait season
. bille august ' s high
- profile adaptation of victor hugo ' s classic les miserables delivers everything oen woudl expect from a classy hollywood epic
-
- handsome production values
, strong performances by a top
- notch casted
, a literate screenplay
-
- with one critically missing element
: emotional sweep
. for those not familiar with hugo ' s original novel or tyhe hit stage musical it inspired
, the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something liek a 19th
- centruy french
- set version of the fugitive
. after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread
, the brutish jean valjean
( liam neeson
) is paroled
. immediately upon release
, he steals valuable silverware ffrom a kindly bishop who takes him in fo a night
; he is caught by authorities
, only to be forgiven by the bishop
, who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight
and narrow
. that he does
,
and in doing so breaks his parole
, which sets thge obsessively determined inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
)
, who was oney of the guards in valjean ' s prison camp
, onthe his trail
. thematically
,
however
, les miserables is a story baout redemption
, which valjean finds through his dealings with two women
, the hard
- luck factory
- worker
- turned
- prostitute fantine
( uma thurman
)
,
and her illegitimate daughter
, cosette
. yeras after breaking parole
, valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau
, where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert
. valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette
( mimi newman
) from her cruel caretakers
, the thenardiers
,
and raise the child as his own
. the
" father
"
and
" daughter
" eventually land infront paris
, where the teenage cosette
( claire danes
) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius
( hans matheson
)
. the decades
- spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of
,
and the danish august turns iin his most acomplished english
- language work
, following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the hous of the spirits
and last year ' s stylish
but highly preposterous mystery smilla ' s sence of snow
. he
and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focuse
and keep the events moving at a brisk pace
. production designer anna asp
, costume designer gabriella pescucci
,
and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose acomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast
. neeson is commanding
yet endearingly vulnerable
; rush ' s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated
, oscar
- winning theatrics inthe shine
;
and thurman disappears nicely inot her highly unglamorous role
. teh younger members of the cast fare less well
. danes is convincing as cosette
,
but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction
;
and matheson
, while competent
, is a less interesting robert sean leonard
. as technically adept
and cerebrally engaging the film is
, by teh time les miserables was over
, my emotions had only been superficially involved
. while i was touched by valjean ' s relationships withthe fantine
and cosette
, i was not moved
. nto even reaching the
" touching
" level is the cosette
- marius pairing
. my only previous experience with les miserables is withthe the musical
( as i am sure many others ' is
)
,
annd i was dismayed to see eponine
, a firend ofthe marius ' s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him
, almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation
( thge daughter of the thenardiers
, here she is only briefly seen as a child
)
. her presense would have added some much
- needed conflict
and emotional heft to the youthful romance
,
but i suppose august
and yglesias felt oen tragic heroine
( fantine
) was enough
. even so
, as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season
, les miserables is a thoughtful
, well
- made
, entertaining film
, one that will sate moviegoers hungry forthe a dose of drama before popcorn no
- brainers invade the multiplex
.
