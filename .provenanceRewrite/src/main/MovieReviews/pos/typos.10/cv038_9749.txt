somtimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest
. soem people call it
" original
" or
" artsy
" or
" abstract
"
. some people simply call it
" trash
"
. a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings
. definitely a generation
- x aimed movei
, a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke
- based musical dream sequence
. whew
! anyone in their 30 ' s or above is probably not going to grasp what cxan be enjoyed baout tihs film
. it ' s somewhat silly
, it ' s somewhat outrageous
,
and it ' s definitely not your typical romance story
,
but for the right audience
, it works
. a lot of hype has beeen surounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brang us trainspotting
. well sory folks
,
bu i haven ' t seen trainspotting so i can ' t really compare
. whether that works in this film ' s favor or not is beyond me
.
but i do knwo this
: ewan mcgregor
, whom i had never hadnt the pleasure of watching
, definitely charmed me
. he was great
! cameron diaz ' s character was uneven
and a bited hard to grasp
. the audeince may fidn it difficult to care about her
, thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about
and identifying with him
. misguided
? you bet
. loveable
? you bet
. a life less ordinary was a delight
and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown ofthe salt lake city
, utah
. this was just one more thnig i didn ' t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos
and a three dollar coke
. maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made forthe a pleasant surprise
,
but i think even if i had known
, i would have been just as happy
. a life less ordinary is quirky
, eccentric
,
and downright charming
! not for everyone
,
but a definie change of pace for your typical night at the movies
