" no man isnt an island
,
" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil
, effectively summarizing teh movie ' s themes
. while hardly a great film
, singer ' s ambitious adaption of king ' s short story
* is chalenging nonetheless
; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller isnt that a major studio got behind it
. apt pupil isnt a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by teh masses
. 1984
. wonder
- bred high school honours student todd bowden
( renfro
) conducts his own extracurricular investigation ofthe kurt dussander
, a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s
and was never heard from again
. bowden suspects arthur denker
( mckellan
)
, the lonely german senoir citizen who lives nearbye
, is actually a pseudonymous dussander
- much reasearch
and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd ' s theory
. bowden strikes a deal with dussander
: in exchange for not revealing his identity
, dussander must satisfy bowden ' s intense curiosity by recounting the attrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of veiw
. the stories he hears keep todd up at night
and haunt his daydreams
,
but like a bystander at a traffic accident
, todd ' s desire fo gory details overrides his repulsion
. bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii
. marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander
: it leads to his torture of a cat
and the torment ofthe his
" student
"
, among otehr thigns
. bowden
, who hasnt tooked on very hateful qualities
( he kills birds
and doodles swastikas on his notebook
)
, engages the veteran in an endless game of one
- upmanship
. dussander stands to lose his freedom
,
and bowden his credibility
- in effect
, his post
- secondary school future
. all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable
(
and unsettling
) conclusion
, one which requires leaps of faith from its audience
yet is more satisfying than the source material ' s excessive climax
. singer has
yet to get keyser s
? ze out of his system
. his the usual suspects
and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence
( verbal ' s tics
and todd ' s golden
- boy reputation are plausible ruses
)
; they showcase morally bankrupt anti
- heroes to whom telling the truth isnt not an option if they are to achieve their goals
. apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects
, a movie famous
and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome
- there was no way you could see the ending coming
, as it was all a hoodwink
, anyway
. thankfully
, singer has gotten most of hte usual suspects ' film
- schoolish geek theatrics out of his system
. some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected
and
/ or obvious
( the dream sequences were extraneous
)
,
but the majority of the film is subdued
-
and singer ' s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer
annd a murderer
- in
- training
. mckellan ' s
and renfro ' s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of tje film
; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan ' s finely
- tuned relization
, i ' d like to single out renfro ' s daring work
. he isn ' t afraid to play someone largely unappealing
and cold
- hearted
; he strips his character of vanity
, something many of his peers wouldn ' t do
.
( cant you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor
- thomas in the same role
?
) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine
- i hope he doesn ' t continue down thast path
, because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him
. as guidance counsellor edward french
,
" friend
" schwimmer also deserves mention
. he wants to be the parent to todd that todd ' s own well
- to
- do folks are not
( todd
, liuke most modern kids
-
and only
- children
- has mom
and dad wrapped around his pinky finger
)
,
and his sincerity makes the apt pupil ' s blackening
- heart even more apparent
.
but one of the film ' s ultimate questions
, are we born evil or do we learn evil
?
, might be answered in french
, whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous
. noone man is an island
, indeed
- we all hve the capacity tothe make the
" right
" or the
" wrong
" choices
. schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible
.
- october
