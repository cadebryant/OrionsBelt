you ' ve seen htis moment before
, recently
: a particularly troubled character senses danger ofthe the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing
. the difference is thta when it happens to lili taylor ' s nell in the haunting
, we don ' t care
. the hero of tje sixth sense
, a young boy named cole
, is a rich creation
,
anbd we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike
. the seasons have changed since an ex
- patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe
( willis
) in tjhe comfort of his own bedroom
. desperate to get his career back on track
, even at the expense ofthe his crumbling marriage
( to williams
, ofthe rushmore
)
, malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm ' s would
- be killer
: scars on his body
; antisocial behaviour
;
and the reluctance to reveal a big sceret
. only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies
(
anbd hospitalized as a result
) does he divulge to malcolm
, in a spine
- tingling scene
, that he sees dead people walking amonth us
, all the time
. malcolm assumes
,
and given his profession
, reasonably so
, that cole isnt schizophrenic
, not psychic
,
but the sincerity in cole ' s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures
. he will instead pursue the supernatural angle
, becomming a kind ofthe surrogate father to cole
( who lives iwth his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) in the process
. the sixth sense has more in common witht ghost than poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan does
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib the self
- rearranging kitchen business from the latter
.
) it ' s far more heartwarming than frightening
,
and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks
. cole attracts the dead fo reasons unkown
,
but they ' re not out to harm him
, really
- they just want to be heard
, even if it means scaring the bejesus out of yhe innocent gradeschooler
. perphas the apparitions seem more ghastly to us
, at first
, than htey really are because we ' re looking at the situation thru the eyes of an eight
- year
- old
. that ' s right
: willis
, for the first time in years
, gives up the spotlight to his costar
. we appreciate malcolm ' s domestic dilemma
,
but we identify with cole
, recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed
. both actors deliver immensely likable performances
,
and their dynamic is manifest
. willis convinces us that he ' s a doctor
, something he wass unable tothe do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night
. osment is phenomenal
, a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do
. the sixth sense
( atmospherically shot by tjhe silence of the lambs ' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) is actulaly a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campaign is misleading
. only because i was expecting something different doed i notice
- rather
, feel
- the movei ' s running time
, whcih is just shy of two hurs
. the story unfurls slowy
but engrossingly
; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait
. i ' m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof
,
but i admired its audacity
.
