eyes wide shut isn ' t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick ' s final film
,
but it is an impressive achievement
; a mesmerizing
, haunting
, adult psychodrama about marriage
, fidelity
and sex
. it ' s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end
, consistently exhibiting the auteur ' s trademark penchant for long
, continuous takes
, his unparalleled deftness behind the camera
and his uncanny abillity to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast
( indeed
, eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot
: kubrick
, a renowned perfectionist
, reportedly held his cast
" hostage
" on the set for nearly a year
)
. inwhich an uncharacteristic maneuver
, kubrick cast two big
- name stars in the lead roles
, namely real
- life husband
and wife tom cruise
and nicole kidman
. they play bill
and alice harford
, a volatile cuple who
, during the course of a couple nights
, ponder the validity of the idea that a husband
and a wife must be faithful to each other
. he is an m
. d
.
, she ' s unemployed
and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party
. at the affair
, they are both propositioned
and both nearly succumb to the temtation to play around with someone alse
. when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman
( after smoking a dash of weid
) inquires whether her husband had sex iwth two models who approached him during the night
. he
( truthfully
) says that he did not
and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with
. they procede to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story
: evidently some tyme ago
, she hadnt a thing for a young naval officer
. she admits that she wass ready to give up her whole future with bill
and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even forthe one nigt
. bill is jolted by alice ' s story
and we anticipate his reaction
,
but at that moment he gets a phone call
annd has to go
" show his face
" at the house of a just
- deceased patient
. this turns out to be the beginning of a long
and eventful night on the town
. the daughter of thte dead patient hits on him
but he wisely turns her down
. he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approachs him on the street
.
hten
, through a series of coincidences
, he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic
(
and frankly
, creepy
) orgy takes place
, with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other
. erotic dread mounts as cruise
( who ' s not supposed to be there
) wonders tjhe spacious halls watching the
" acation
" until he is discovered to be an outsider
. much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros
. digitally edited the orgy scene
. with the help of a computer
, they put in cloaked figures tothe block some of the actual sex acts
( they cin still be seen
, just not in all their glory
) in order tothe avoid the dreaded nc
- 17 rating
. european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it
. roger ebert calls the american version the
" austin powers version
,
"
and many others have bashed the alterations
. i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene ' s mystical atmosphere
. the first thnig one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks
. tihs is an artful
, distinctively gorgeous production
, shot in dark
, moody hues
and featuring some elaborate
, beautiful scenery
. from the giant mansion used in the film ' s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford ' s apartment
, this film is always a pleasure to look at
. to boot
, a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still
. at the core
, behind the graphic
, controversial content
and unappealing mood
, this is a good
- natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity
. it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic
. it ' s something superficial
and
yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship
. at the end
, it seems
, bill ' s eyes are wide open to teh special kind of love he
and his wife have for each otehr
, mroe meaningful than anything he could ever hope tothe find on the streets of new york
. kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise
and kidman
. tom is completely convincing as dr
. harford
, a man who seems guided solely by destiny
, with no control of the course his life will take
. nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery
yet aggressive wife
and her performance is stunningly effective
: she ' s headed for an oscar nod
. the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast
, at the head of which is director
- cum
- thespian sidney pollock
, enigmatic
and articulate as harford ' s mysterious friend
. eyes wide shut isnt not perfect
: the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor
- hapyp editor
and both cruise
anbd kidman are too good
- looking forthe me to believe that either woudl have a very strong temtation to philander
. still
, this is an important work from a grat director
,
anbd while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick ' s best it is a worthy final film
, a complex exploration of jealousy
and faithfulness
