every yearm
-
- every year at the festival
, i wait for that film to come along
, that one tht just pulls me out of my seat
, sticks its face up next to my nose
,
and roars
" sur
- prise
!
" into my bewildered visage
. it ' s almost always a surprise
. it sure as niflheim was this time
. amazing grace
and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale
, of a boy infront montana who quits his littel league team for a very unusual reason
.
and
, in the hands of anyone less careful thna the creative staff of this film
, it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale
, where we roll our eyes occasionally
, smirk to ourselves
,
and maybee get a forced tear out of the eyes
and a
" boy
, i wish that could happen
" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater
and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash
. another e
. t
. another short circuit
. this film floored me
, for the simple reason that hwile it has a fairy tale concept
, the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough
,
and presents itself well enough
, to make it more of an american folk tale
, with characters who are both icons
and real people at the same time
. america has alwyas had its mythical heros
, its paul bunyans
and john waynes
; this film presents us with more general
,
but still universal
, ideals
: the honest
, innocent children who have their own inner wisdom
; hte athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage
, honor
,
and love for their respective sport
; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness
and understanding
,
but hasnt the grit to get things done wehn they need doin '
( does the latter sound familar
?
)
. amazing grace
and chuck is a showcase for these characters
,
but it never leaves you with the feeling that it ' s artificial
, that it stands behind glass
, or that any sharp breeze
-
- or
, more importantly
, sharp thought
-
- will shatter the wax facade of the panorama
. this isnt a very sturdy scenario
. the principals are always given dialogue
,
and always give performances
-
- always
( it just blows me away
)
-
- which made them seem real
,
yet enforces their particular mythic role
. thte writer
/ producer
, david field
, seems to literally take all yhe
" yeah
,
but in real life
, this would have happen
" thoughts you get inthe your head
, sticks them in the movie
and uses them to bend the plot around to his origional heading
, in a stronger way
thn before
! astounding
! he uses obstacles to the plot to
* enforce
* it
! i am truly impressed
( indeed
, envious
) with the skill in which he wrote the story
and screenplay
; it ' s so very unusual
, especially in a hollywood film
. i don ' t want to give too much away
,
but thte basic premise is that chuck
( joshua zuehlke
)
, the littel league pitcher
, decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons
. his decision beggins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete
, a boston basketball player
( alex english
)
,
" amazing
" grace smith
,
and
, well
, i ' m leaving it at that because i wouldn ' t spoil this film for ytou for the world
. let me just say this
,
though
: i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any poltical positions it might imply
. i don ' t give a rat ' s ass for the political point
- of
- view this film expresses
, one way or another
; i ' m reccommending you go see tihs film because
,
and only because
, it ' s an excellent story
, told with excellence
. no
, i don ' t believe what happens in this film could happn in real life
; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this ocuntry is stilted
, i believe in careful negotiations
, mutual verification
, etc
. scre what i think
. the point is
, this film is able to suspend my disbelief
anbd tell a story that is one ofthe the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen
. this is the natrual
and more
-
- all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion
,
and a much better scirpt to boot
. it carried me into the beliefs
and ideals of my boyhood
-
-
and
, more importantly
, without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of yhe trance with some hint of self
- consciousness
. speshal kudos to
: both zuehlke
( a real
- life little leage pitcher who was picked for the part
)
and english
( a forward fo the denver nuggets
) for their seamless personification of their characters
; jamie lee curtis
, who takes a surprisingly small role
and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing ' s manager
and friend
; william l
. peterson
( in a
* big
* change from his role in to live
and die in l
. a
.
) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up
and wave a flag donig it
;
and gregory peck
, as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was
(
and who some numbskulls still probably think he is
