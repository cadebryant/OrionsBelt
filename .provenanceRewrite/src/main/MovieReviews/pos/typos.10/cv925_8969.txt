contact is a film that tries to do several different things
. it is intended to present a realistic picture of waht alien contact might be like
, to restore a sense of wonder
and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life
, to raise questions about science
and faith
and how they would be relevant in such a situation
,
annd to tell a personal story of a romance beween the astronomer dr
. ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
and the religious spokesman palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
. the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals
. the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable
( albeit less immediately engaging
) than
, say
, the cold
- blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions
and genetic hybridization tath forms the ongoing plot line of tv ' s the x
- files
. the aliens in contact seem tothe be like us
- tehy are moreso curious than anything else
. they know we exsist
, they want us to know that they exist
,
and they would like to make the next step
and communicate in person
. the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly
,
and beetwen the characters ' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials
and the outstanding visuals in the climactic
yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world
, tyhat sense of wonder
annd mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick ' s 2001
: a space odyssey
. most of the film
,
however
, takes place on earth
, where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens
. scientists are enthusiastic
, ultraconservative religious leaders are wary
,
and government officials are caught somewhere in between
. the debate is fueled largely by dr
. arroway ' s athiesm
; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens hve provided blueprints
,
but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind ' s representative to anyother species
. the film is partly successful in raising
and exploring theese questions
, especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches
- sciecne
and faith
- could be viewed as complementary rather tahn diametrically opposed
. still
, the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society
. the two
" sides
" are represented primarily by arroway
and by far
- right fundamentalists
,
bu in reality probably 80
% of americans are neither atheists nor far
- right fundamentalists
. palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground
,
but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives
and comes across as a less
- than
- ideal spokesman for any ideology
.
then again
, the film does concentrate mostly on public debate
, which does
, after all
, tend to be dominated by extremists
, rather than on dinner
- talbe or coleeg
- dormitory discussions
. contact is accurate in its protrayal of these issues
,
then
,
but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself
. the film ' s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway
and joss
. for one thing
, it resorts to the tired movie clich
* that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as tehy appear on tjhe screen together
, as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction
. the romance rarely
, if ever
, sheds any light on the charactors
,
although it occasionally tries
and fails
- joss ' s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of yhe celibacy requirement
(
" i guess you could say i ' m a man of the cloth
,
but without yhe cloth
"
)
, fo example
, is omre like a punchline to a joke than character development
. instead
, the romance mostly seems to exsist for the sake of later plot developments
. granted
, this is a plot
-
and idea
- driven film
and the characters are secondary
,
but this just seemed like laziness on the writers ' part more than anything else
. the successes ofthe contact
,
however
, far outweigh its failures
. even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether
( which it didn ' t
)
, the simple
yet mysterious story ofthe alien communication still would have made it a memorable film
. contact doesn ' t qutie cover all the bases
,
but it covers about as much as oney could hope for in a two
- hour film
,
and its rejection of big
- budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable
.
and i would not be surprised if
, ten years from now
, contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001
and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated
and intellectually relveant science fiction
.
