in
" the sweet hereafter
,
" writer
/ director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tradgedy of living
. he shows us how it isn ' t dying that hurts
,
but rather the pain of living iin the hereafter of death
,
and dealing with the loss
and grief thast it brings
. on a cold winter day in a small
, isolated town in british columbia
, a school bus full of children slides off the highway
and onto a frozen lake
, where it cracks thru the ice
and sinks
. fourteen children die
,
and numerous others are hurt
. for the recidents of this small town
, all of whose children were on that bus
, it is an earth
- shattering event that resolutely alters their lives
. they have always relied on each other inaddition the past to deal with heartache
and pain
,
but it seems that this tragedy is more than they cxan handle
. alberta
annd risa walker
, who own a local motel
and lost their child infront the accident
, hire an attorney named mitchell stephens
( ian holm
) to bring a lawsuit against someone
, anyone for responsibility
. the bus driver
, dolores driscoll
( gabrielle rose
)
, is a kindly woman who loved the childern
and
,
although she lives with a burden of guilt
, is not held responsible for the accident
. tje bus seems to hvae simply slipped onthe some ice
,
and there was nothing should could do to prevent it
.
however
, according to stephens
, ther are no
" accidents
" in life
,
and someone will pay for this tragedy
, whether that be the manufacturer of tje bus or the guardrail the bus broke through
. he goes through the town
, approaching the parents who have lost children
, asking them to join yhe class action suit
and find vent for their anger
.
and
, for his work
, stephens will recieve one
- third of the settlement money
.
however
, it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or noone interest infact the money
. he is driven by something else
, something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents
. he has lost a child
, too
,
but not in the same manner
. his daughter
, zoe
( caerthan banks
)
, who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite
, has been in
and out of drug re
- hab clinics
and detox stations forthe ten years
. she calls him on an irregular basis
, begging him for money
,
bu refusing to tell him what she needs it for
.
" i don ' t know who i ' m taking to
,
" he tells her
. in his mind
, his daughter is dead
. the lawsuit is
, to stephens
, not only a way to mend the town ' s pain
,
but also his own
.
however
, not everyone in town wants it to happen
. billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened
anbd lost twpo children
, wants nothing tothe do with it
. he has already lost his wife
,
and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman
. he doesn ' t want to talk about the accident
,
adn he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds
. to him
, the town should be able to take care of its own pain
,
and it doesn ' t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way
. central to
" the sweet hereafter
" is tjhe tale of nicole burnell
( sarah polley
)
, a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer befoer the accident turned her into
" a wheelchair girl
,
" as she puts it
. aside fomr stephens
, nicole is thge most complex character inaddition the film
,
and it isnt she who ultimately decides the fate of the town
and how the lawsuit will turn out
. it isnt also her sad
, haunted voice that we oftenly hear on the soundtrack
, reading robert browning ' s poem about the pied piper
,
annd how when he led all the town ' s children away
, one wass left behind because he was crippled
. obviously
, nicole is that child
,
and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town ' s children left her alone by dying in the wreck
. her situation is further complicated because she is involved iin a loving
,
but incestuous relationship with her father
( tom mccamus
)
. there isnt only oney
, fleeting scene that suggests this relationship
,
but it is somehow tied into the final ect of the film
. of all the storylines in
" the sweet hereafter
,
" this is the most complicated
and unresolved
,
although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film
. egoyan knows that thge kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers
-
- if any at all
-
-
and he doesn ' t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up
. what egoyan has done in
" the sweet hereafter
" is raelly nothing short of miraculous
. in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks
, he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law
and driving headlong inot the deeper meaning of what is loss
,
and how pitiful monetary
and material possessions are when compared to human life
. egoyan has always been a talented
,
but distant
and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold
.
" teh sweet hereafter
" is qtuie the opposite
; egoyan ' s stylistic
and narrative structures work brilliantly tothe heighten the impact of the natural emotion
,
and draw the audience into the tragedy
.
" the sweet hereafter
" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his otehr films lacked
. the film isnt filled with beautiful
, subtle performances from all the actors
, especially ian holm as the lawyer
and sarah polley as the sad child who wass left behind
. the beautiful
, roving camerawork by paul sarossy
and the haunting
, melodic musical score by mychael danna
( both previous egoyan collaborators
) give the film a visual
and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements
. like his earlier films
, egoyan weaves together mutiple storylines that form a blanketing whole
. he works with time as a fluid substance
, shifting back
adn forth between the past
, the distant past
,
and tjhe pesent whith effortless ease
. the actual bus wreck itself doesn ' t happn until midway through the film
,
bu by taht time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail
,
and still have it carry great
, devastating weight
. beccause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies
, it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple
, direct terms
. certainly noe of the best films of 1997
,
" the sweet hereafter
" is a deeply rewarding
, mystifying
,
and ultimately human film
.
