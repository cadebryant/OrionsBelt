naturally
, at the core of leon gast ' s
" when we were kings
" is the fight itself
, for what a fight it was
. thanks to the business savvy of don king
, an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman
. fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance
and strategy
, as much as brute strength
, that immediately entered boxing lore
. with the benefit of the firt
- hand recollections of that old ex
- pug norman mailer
, this classic conflict is brought bcak to life
.
but
" when we weere kings
" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match
. questions of political power
and social justice appear throughout this documentary
. gast could hardly choose otherwise
, considering the vocal
, uncompromising politics ofthe muhammad ali
. a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation ofthe islam
, ali opens gast ' s film with a forceful swipe at the untied states
. when ali hollers
" damn amercia '
, the audience konws teh imprecation is heartfelt
; tjhe brutal
yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind
. his desision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended withthe the same admirable fury
:
" no viet cong ever called me nigger
"
, ali reasons
. despite showcasing ali ' s proud unequivocal politics
, one of the most impressive features of
" when we were kings
" is the subtle way in which the documentary conciders the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity
and black symbolism that ali
and his supporters champion
. listening to the film ' s numerous commentators
, it is clera that the geographic location for this
" rumble in the jungle
" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map
. spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage
, a
" coming home
" to africa
. foreman reminds us that africa is the
" cradle of civilisation
"
. fair enough
,
but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality
. it is the newly founded zaire
adn it is ruled by president mobutu
, a brutal dictator
. while ali respects mobutu ' s ability to forge an independent african state
, mailer notes that beneath tjhe stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well
- stocked torture chambers
. mailer ' s insights are lost on most of the film ' s commentators
. george plimpton recalls that he always feeled he was infact the congo
, rather than the newly christened zaire
. with admirable restraint
, gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth
and hisory all
but obscured the reality of zaire ' s squalid ruling elite
. mobutu is not the onyl dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism ofthe black power
. don king
, resplendent in yellow kaftan
and at ease with the
" messiah
" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple
, passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity
. understandably
, foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal
. he may be
, as one sympathiser notes
,
" blacker
" than ali
,
but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali
, the thuggish mobutu
,
and the tacky huckster don king
. africa
, zaire
, inspirational leader or vicious dictator
, all isnt left undifferentiated
, unconsidered
, in this optimistic celebration of balck unity
. little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find thta ali ' s oponent wasn ' t white
. admittedly
, these issues are only hinted at
, rather than substantially explored
. the audiance must consider the significance of these issues themselves
, in their own time
. ther is just too much tothe cover
, too much that is truly worthy of celebratuin
, for a protracted political analysis to be justified
. the excitement of james brown
and b
. b king in concert
, for instance
.
and of course there ' s always ali to consider
, as he shamelessly
,
and hilariously
, hams it up in front of the camera
, shadow boxing
and uttering one inspired rhyme after another
-
" we gonna get it on coz we don ' t get along
!
"
. doubtlessly
, considering the multi
- faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover
, the makers of
" when we were kings
" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues
,
and what personalities
, best deserved their attention
. fortunately
, by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter
, they have captured the richness
and excitement ofthe this unique event
.
