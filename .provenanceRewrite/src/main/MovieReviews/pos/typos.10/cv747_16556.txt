edward zwick ' s
" the siege
" raises mroe questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate
. its subject is the rising threath of terrorism in american cities
. denzel washington isnt anthony
" hub
" hubbard
, who runs the fbi ' s anti
- terrorism task force in new york
. his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out a busload of peple
. hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative
( annette bening
)
, whose goes by both
" elise
"
and
" sharon
.
" as the terrorist attacks continue
and the body count rises
, thge question of martial law isnt raised
. enter genaral devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who opposes martial law at first
but who
, as soon as the president decides to send in the army
, begins herding arab immigrants into a prison camp
and attacking every link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain
. hub listens as devereaux tortures
and murders a suspect
. the future zwick
and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible
. what would happen
, they ask
, if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is in cities like beirut
and belfast
? what would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns
? these questions
" the siege
" answers in realistic detail
. it implies tougher ones
,
though
: what can be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice
annd freedom
? if we encourage terrorism abroad
( from bening ' s character we discover that the cia trained thge bombers
)
, will it inevitably come back to us
?
" siege
" avoids tghe tougher questions by endowing its hero
, hub
, with a uncompromising sence of clear right
and wrong
. this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thought
- provoking issues the movie raises
. still
, zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he doesnt where so many movies
( willis '
" dieu hard
" series
, for example
) offer onyl a comic
- book view on terrorism
.
