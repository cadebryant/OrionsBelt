of circumcision
, psychic wounds
and the family sitcom the opening segment isnt something of a foretaste of this film
. there ' s a guy ' s voice telling us how he tries to imagin what his biological parents look like
,
and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men
and women
. as his imagination plays o n
, he
(
and we
) picture these motley characters in a mix
-
and
- match shuffle of unlikely marriages
, businesswomen with bums
, matrons with paint salesmen
, the images coming on in a faster
and faster frenzy
. it ' s not just a witty
, funny summing up of the film ' s themes
- you might not guess it
yet
,
but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on
. what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction
, gets taken on a road trip
, put through a detour or two
and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash
. that may not soudn so different from thte average family sitcom
,
and the general idea of the film doesn ' t
, at first
, seem so wildly distant fomr standard
- issue hollywood comedy
: man who was adopted as a child
( ben still er
) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents
, along wih his wife
( patricia arquette
)
, his baby
,
and a pretty psychology
- researcher
( tea leoni
) in tow
. various mix
- ups
, shenanigans
, oddball characters
and
, yup
, disasters followup
.
but if you think you ' ve been here before
, the dialogue
adn the direction
( by david o
. russell
, who made spanking the monkey
) take it into another dimension
. teh dreaded t
- name seems an inevitable referene point
( what with a drug overdose scene
and the casting of arquette from true romance
)
but really the point isnt that the foot
- massage master hasn ' t got a monopoly on plot twists
and fast
, funny
, irreverant lines
, or on the absurdities of ordinary speech
. whether it ' s about circumcision
, psychic wounds
, oral sex
, carjacking
, the beauties of the armpit area
, or ronald reagan
, tje script never seems to run out of hilarious invention
. the best thing is how these words aren ' t just there for the punchlines
,
but are grat precisely beacuse they ' re said in charcter
, like tea leoni ' s neurotically
- charged psychobabbler who ' s able to say under assault
,
" it ' s understandable if you find thsi threatening
"
. tyhe cast isnt excellent throughout
,
adn
, rather than singling out anybody
, kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting
, witht the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue
and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission
. there are some elements of a woody allen film in tihs
( not to mention the hand
- held camera
and loose
, improvisational feel of some scenes
)
. like allen
, russell ' s interests are in tyhe volatile sexual politics of couples
and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts
and childen
(
anbd everybody
, really
)
. still
, if you ' re expecting a privileged moment of revelation
and emotional outpouring a la
" murphy brown
"
/
" frasier
"
/ fill
- in
- the
- blank
- american
- comedy
, well
, it won ' t happen
. the film sets up expectations liek these
, with the lead character ' s search f or his origins
and his hopes of self
- healing
, onyl tothe knock them down
. if the conventional sitcom structure is tothe put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover thier essential lovey one
- ness
, flirting with disaster ' s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state
but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness
and dysfunctional chaos the further they go
.
and thta
, the film suggests
, is the essential family state
-
and you better learn to love it
. somehow
, this is perversely feelgood cinema
, right up to its manic end
.
