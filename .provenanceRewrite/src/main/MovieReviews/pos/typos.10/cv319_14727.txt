the full monty isnt a whole lot ofthe fun
, its wacky
, witty
,
and original
. it ' s written
and directed by relatively unknowns
, simon beaufoy
and peter cattaneo
, who both turned up oscar nominations
. how did htis movie with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide
? its beeen rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie ofthe the year
!
and to think its about male exotic dancers
,
and not sinking ships
. six steel workers who have been recently been laid off
and are all looking for jobs
. inspired by the success ofthe a chippendale ' s production
, gaz
( robert carlyle
) decides they should all put on a strip show tothe make some money quickly
. as the six team up to put on the show of their lives
, they run into a few problems
. for instance
, dave
( mark addy
) is worried about his weight
, horse
( paul barber
) thikns he may be inadequate
,
and gerald
( tom wilkinson
) is worried baout his reputation
and timing
. so when the night of thte show comes
, will the men be able to do the
" full monty
"
? as i said before this is a fun movie
,
and nto just that its really artistically good
. the writing
and direction are great
. the acting is appealing
, all the performances have a human quality to them
, so you can relate to at least one of the characters
. the full monty recieved four oscar nominations including best picture
. which left me wondering one thing
, why didn ' t trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year
? while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy
, it doesn ' t carry teh social impact of the brilliant trainspotting
. still
, the full monty is a great film
, a must see
!
