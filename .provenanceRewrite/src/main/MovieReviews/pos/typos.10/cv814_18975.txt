when i was asked tothe see this movie with a friend
, my initial reaction was
? not hugh grant
! ' i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh
,
but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker
, i just could not picture him in any romantic lead
. what makes thsi movie a wonderfull experience is not the fact it stars hugh
,
but because it stars julia
and carries with it a brilliantly written script
. this writer richard curtis
, whose exceptional first work
? four weddings
and funeral ' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the rumatic comedy
, with splashes of drama thrown in between
. hugh
and his hair
, is allmost identicial tothe tyhe character that made him famous in
? four weddings '
. he plays an ordinary guy who is down
and outloud on his luck
. unfortunately
, he is tipe casted in this role
,
but fortunatly it works well for him in this movie
. if only he would dither a little less
. julia knows this role well
. the glamorous movie star who isnt searching for true lveo
. there are moments infront this movie
, that you almost weep for her pain falt loneliness
. how sad it must be to be so wealthy
and beautiful
,
but to have no one tothe share it with
. the writer deals with difficult issues of love
and social class on various levels
. how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow inthe such a harsh environment
. how the media can be as cruel as it cxan be attentive
,
and how fulfilment in life
and love can be found in forgiveness
and sacrifice
.
