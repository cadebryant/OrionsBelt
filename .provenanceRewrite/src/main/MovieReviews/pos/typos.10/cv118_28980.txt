plot
: a human space astronaut accidentally falls apon a planet ruled by apes
. he is taken prisoner along with some other humans
,
and tries his best to escape his simian captors
. oh yeah
,
and did i mention that the apes can talk
? kewl
! critique
: despite this film not looking like a
" tim burton movie
" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human bieng himself
, i doed find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film
annd do recommend it as fun
, summer fare
.
although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape mkae
- up jobs
and characterizations
. i mean
, i was completely conviced that every single one of these apes was for real
! i also have to
" give it up
" to all of the actors inside the costumes
, not only for waking up at three iin the morning every day to get make
- up slobbered all over them for 2
- 4 hours
,
but for comming through thier costumed exteriors
annd selling us their characters on the screen as well
. i especially enjoyed bonham carter ' s performance
, who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film
( human or ape
)
and tim roth ' s bad guy
, who chewed up scenery
and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part
. plot
- wise
, i liked the beginning ofthe the film
, the whole build
- up once wahlberg got into the village
, yhe escape
and most ofthe the fight scenes
,
but once things got out into the deserted area
(
adn yhe final battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bit of my interest
. i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters
and the whole idea of
" human beings as animals
"
then i was about the end battle sequence
, which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film
. i also hated the
" kid
" character who jstu got on my nerves
and didn ' t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved
( i won ' t ruin it here
but c ' mon guys
.
.
. you coulda thought of something a little more plausible thna that
, no
?
)
.
but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character
, his cold demeanor
and the zero chemistry that he shared with either noe of his inter
- species lveo interests
. this dude didn ' t seem to give a rat ' s ass about anyone
but himself
and i ultimately didn ' t really care about what happened to him either
. now i ' m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script
,
but the film suffered because of it
. visually
, the movie was also nice to look at
( especially the apes
!
)
,
but i definatly expected greater coolness fomr tim burton
. the
" surprise ending
" that highlighted the original planet ofthe the apes film back in 1968
, felt a little tacked on here
,
and despite bieng interesting
, didn ' t really make all that much sense to me
( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view
)
. so overall
, i loved tje whole
" feel
" of thte planet
, the apes that ruled it
, the manner in which they treated the humans
, screamed
, shouted
and reverted the entire evolution chain
,
but didn ' t appreciate the film ' s lack of human character development
( why was kris kristofferson even in htis movie
?
)
and the fact that its lead male
and female humans were just plain boring
.
but i would still reccomend this film as a funn
, summer movei with laughs
, creepiness
anbd a really cool premise
. ps
: for anyone who has seen the original
, i cannot believe that they didn ' t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character
( in this case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at the world in which he ' s suddenly been thrust
(
" this is a mad house
!
"
- type of thing
)
. the guy in this film bearly seems to be
" put off
" by teh fact that he ' s surrounded by apes who can speak english
!
