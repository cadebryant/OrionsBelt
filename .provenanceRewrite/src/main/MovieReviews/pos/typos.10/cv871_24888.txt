)
, wants tothe use the disease
and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to mkea him owner of the company
( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks tothe the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause
)
. posing as ethan hunt
, ambrose gains the confidence ofthe the scientist long enough to get only the cure
, not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactlly what ambrose ws trying to do
. the rela ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff
- hall
( thandie newton
) tothe assist the imf team inaddition retrieving the stolen goods
. ethan
and nyah fall quicklyu in love

. reluctantly

and send bakc intelligence to the team
. ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining
and spreading the virus
and prevent any harm from coming to nyah
.
although the first mission
: impossible film was a moderate box office succsess
, audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing
and there wasn ' t much action
(
although bieng a fan of the series both old
and new
, i thought the movie was pretty decent
and especially gutsy tothe make phelps a bad guy
)
. that probelm hasnt been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible
( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry
, robert towne
)
and by turning the film into one gigantic action setted piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo
. the end result is one of the most entertaining
(
yet simple
) acation films made infront a long while
. unfortunately
, the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow
, dwelling mainly on ethan
and nyah ' s quickly blossoming romance
and seeming more in place inspite a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission
: impossible tv series
. ethan ' s conflict is a compelling one
,
but it seems very rushed
(
and comes about because of a near futal car wreck that ethan himself causes
!
)
. john woo handles all of htis with an artistic flair that seems out of place
, featuring a great deal of slow fades
and dramatically framed close
- ups
. hte surreal nature of these sequences are distracting
and ultimately a detriment tothe thge film
. thankfully
though
, at the point ambrose discovers nyah ' s deception
, mission
: impossible ii becomes very entertaining
and acation
- packed
. robert towne ' s screenplay tkaes soem of the conventions set uv in the first film
and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break inot a high
- rise building
and retrieve yhe remaining specimens ofthe the virus
. after that
, the acation scenes just begin to build in intensity
, as isnt the case with many of woo ' s previous high
- octane films
. the final half hour is an all out assault ofthe action
( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer
, unfortunately
)
. as far as summer entertainment goes
, mission
: impossible ii is serviceable fare
. anyone looking for hardcore action won ' t be disappointed
( except for durring the frist half of the film
, perhaps
)
. even if you weren ' t a fan of the first film
, this entry deserves some checking out
.
