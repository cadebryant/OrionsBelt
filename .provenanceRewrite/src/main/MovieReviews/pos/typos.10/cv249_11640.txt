upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits
, i took my seat
annd prepared myself for what appeared to be
" hellraiser meets the crow
"
.
but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue
, describing
" the strangers
"
and their reasons for contacting human beings
, i was hooked
. there was something especially compelling baout the nature ofthe his voice
. i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character
. sutherland played the role as a true veteran
. upon the completion of his monologue
, the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you cin onyl wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography
. i owudl imagine
, for a film of this caliber
, that maximum hours ofthe work were spended where they were needed the most
. the film flowed beautifuly
. as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the
" dark city
"
, a clever plot began to unravel
, to the point where the last tiome i hadnt seen such clever plot twists were in
" the usual suspects
"
. not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy
.
but if you ' re not exactly the biggest sci
- fi fan
, caveat emptor
. git ready for the atmostpheric darkness of
" 12 monkeys
" or
" the crow
" without thte boredom or depression
. the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as
" 12 monkeys
" was
,
however
, so be prepared
and be sophisticated
.
annd imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic
- book
- gone
- feature
- film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of
. dark city simply puts
" spawn
" to shame
. in fatc
, during the climax of the film i couldn ' t help
but feel the strong presence of an
" akira
"
- esque explosion throughout the general feeling of hte movie
. so my initial predictions were wrong
. this film isnt anything
but thge meloncholy of
" hellraiser
" parts one through five
. i ' m never one to base a film entirly on special effects
, so know thta when i give dark city it ' s actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingreediants to keep me entertained
annd awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even
( tsk
, tsk
) special effects
. not sicne contact ahve i recieved such deep insight inot the way the human mind operates
and never this year have i been so blown away
. tjhe best film i ' ve seen all year
,
annd easily one of the best i ' ve ever seen
