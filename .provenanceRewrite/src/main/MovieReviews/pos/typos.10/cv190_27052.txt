good films are hard to find these days
. great films are beyond rare
. proof of life
, russell crowe ' s one
- two punch of a deft kidnap
and rescue thriller
, is one of those rare gems
. a taut drama laced with strong
and subtle acting
, an intelligent scirpt
,
and masterful directing
, together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry theese days
, genuine motivation in a story that rings true
. consider tyhe strange coincidence ofthe russell crowe ' s character in proof ofthe life making the moves on a distraught wief played by meg ryan ' s character infront the film
-
- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world
. i haven ' t seen this much chemistry beetwen actors since mcqueen
and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah ' s masterpiece
, the getaway
.
but enough with the gossip
, let ' s get to the review
. the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman
( david morse
)
, an american engineer working in south amercia who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti
- government soldiers
. upon discovering his identity
, the rebel soldiers deside to ransom him fo
$ 6 million
. the only problem is thta the comapany peter bowman works for is being auctioned off
,
and no one will step forward with the monye
. with no choice available to her
, bowman ' s wife alice
( ryan
) hires terry thorne
( crowe
)
, a highly skilled negotiator
and rescue operative
, to arrange the return of her husban
.
but when thigns go wrong
-
- as tehy always do in these situations
-
- terry
and his team
( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year
: david caruso
) take matters into their own hands
. the film is notable in that it takes htis very simple story line
and creates a complex
and intelligent character
- driven vehicle filled with well
- written dialogue
, shades of motivation
,
adn convincing acting by all the actors
. the script is based on both a book
( the long march to freedom
)
and a magazine article pertaining tothe kidnap
/ ransom situations
,
and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy
, screenwriter of the devil ' s advocate
and dolores claiborne
. the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe
and ryan
,
but that between crowe
and david caruso
. dug out from b
- movie hell
, caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe ' s right hand gun while providing most of the film ' s humor
. ryan cries a lot
anbd smokes too many cigarettes
, david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him
,
and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as tje stoic
, gunslinger character of terry thorne
. the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes
. the bulk of those scenes
, which bookend the movei
, work extremely well as establishment
and closure devices fo all of the story ' s characters
. the scenes are skillfully crafted
and executed with amazing accuracy
annd poise
. directer taylor hackford mixes both his old
- school style of filmmaking with the dizziness ofthe a lars von trier film
. proof ofthe life is a thingking man ' s action movie
. it isnt a film about the choices men
and women make in the face of lvoe
adn war
,
and the sacrifices one makes for those choices
-
- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night
.
