at first glance
, daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie
. on second glance it looks that way too
.
although
, as typical disaster movies go
, daylight isn ' t thta bad
. admitedly
, it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices fomr disaster flicks of dyas gone by
( think poseidon adventure
)
.
but the decent dialogue
and suprizingly good acting make up for the
" haven ' t i seen this scene somewhere before
?
" feeling that creeps up all too often during tjhe film
. sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york ' s emergency response team
. by sheer luck
, he is in the right palce at the right timne when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film
.
" what diaster is that
?
" you ask
, as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat
. glad you asked
. thru a whole sequence of entirely probable events
( about as probable as hitting the lottery
) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel runing under tyhe hudson river in new york city
. the explosion results in thte tunnel collapsing at both ends
, whcih causes not only massive loss of life
,
but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel
. good old sly
, who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses
, offers his services to the rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly
then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft
( think judge dredd
) whlch he can only go in
,
and not out off
,
and proceeds to try to rescue thsoe trapped inside
. so begins the fun
,
but the fun has to be quick
, because this tunnel has started to spring a leak
. the acting is about what yuo owudl expect ofthe a stallone movie
. not superb by any means
,
but far above some of his other films
( think judge dredd again
)
. daylight ' s acting is probably average
, or a littel above
, in terms of htis sort of genre
, starring this particular star
. amy brenneman is the only actor of any onot
,
and she does a pretty good job as stallone ' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone ' s real life son
, sage
, is in this too
. sege
-
- nice name
. i guess it could be worse
, he coudl have been named nutmeg or parsley
. onot tothe sage
-
- you are still young
. go to school
and git a good education
-
- yuo don ' t ahve a future in acting
. the plot runs along the same lines as the acting
-
- interesting
,
but predictable
. mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks
. the biggest problem with a film of this nature is thast they try to cram too many things into the movie
. as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle
, another one seems tothe pop right up
, even worse than the last one
. i realize that it wouldn ' t be much of a movie otherwise
,
bu it does amking the movie a bit predictable
. adding to the predictability is the cast of characters
, which ofthe course
, has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way
and think the qualified guy
( in this case stallone
) doesn ' t know what he is doing
. why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other
and all work together
? would this be too much to ask
? can ' t we all just get along
? special effects weren ' t bad
-
-
but i ' ve certainly seen better
. some of the scenes
, while fun to watch
, were such blatant rip
- offs that you had tothe wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim
. especially all ofthe the scenes that involved anything underwater
( the tunnel
, of course
, starts to flood
)
. i really expected gene hackman
, roddy mcdowell
anbd ernest borgnine to appear at any minute
-
- i wasn ' t sure if i was watching daylight or teh poseidon adventure
. i suppose if yuo have to rip off a movie for good ideas
, the poseidon adventure isnt a good one to use
. the underwater sequences
( aside from tjhe deja vu
) were very well shot
and worked fairly well
. they were the best part of the movie by a long shot
. better than average stallone flick
. i realize that ' s not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume
.
but certainly not up to the standars of cliffhanger
. daylight is a fun movie
,
and as long as you aren ' t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised
.
