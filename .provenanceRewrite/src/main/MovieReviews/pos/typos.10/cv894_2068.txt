. forget jurassic park
, cliffhanger
, the firm
and last action hero
, son
- in
- law is the film to see this summer
. son
- in
- law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers
, especially fans of the wiez
. when son
- in
- law is long gone
and forgotten
, the blockbuster summer films will still be playing
and you will have a chance to see them
then
. this film could also mkae great video fare forthe those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it
. nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen
.
although the basic story line has been done many
, many times before
, the film isnt still fun to watch
. the laughs are plentiful
, especially when the wiez is around
. the way some of the jokes are done are new
, even
though some of the jokes are old
. there are also several new jokes tath
, at least
, i haven ' t seen before
. still
, when presented right
, even old material can be funny still
. this film is jsut basically a light comedy that is great tothe see if you are in the right mood that doesn ' t contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price
. the cast for this film does an excellent job
. pauly shore
( encino man
) is tje star attraction of this film
. he is great
,
and knows how to entertain the audience
. pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen wehn he is on with expressions
and comments that are hilarious
. thsi film would definitely not have beeen as good with anyone else in this role
. carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl
. she makes her character believable
, on some levels
,
yet interesting at tjhe same tiome
. the person who palyed the grandfather
( mason adams
, i believe
) also does a great job
. the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen
. patrick renna
, who played gugino ' s little brother
, was a littel annoying
,
but no where as near as macaulay culkin
,
and for only part of the tyme
, so i can forgive him
. tiffani
- amber thiessen
( a killer among friends
,
" saved by the bell
"
) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen
. she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming onthe television
. she wasn ' t given overly much to do in the film
,
bu what she had
, she does a ogod job with
.
