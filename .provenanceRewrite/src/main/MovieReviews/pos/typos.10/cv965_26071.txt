in many ways
,
" twotg
" does for tough
- guy movies whta la confidential did for police stories
. there ' s savviness in its writing
and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold
.
but
, i suppose
, we wouldn ' t expect less from christopher mcquarrie
, who was responsible for giving us
" the usual suspects
"
. his wirting talents are still in tact as he brings tothe us a bloody
yet intellectual tale of two unabashed
but dimwitted thugs
and a plan gone awry
. the two goons are parker
and longbaugh
( ryan phillipe
annd benicio del toro
)
. these two men show the hardened wear of those who hvea always had it tough
. their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use thier amazing gunplay skills to survive
. given the choice ofthe minimum wage or petty crime
, they ' ll always choose the latter
.
yet
, they are incredibly foolish planners
. actually
, these two never relaly have a plan
. they just improvise along the way
, hoping that thier bravado
and arsenal ofthe guns will take care of anytying that they might have overlooked
. their next scheme
, whihc they cook uv about as fast as a mcdonald ' s burger
, is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin
( juliette lewis
) that was hired by some well
- to
- do family
. if all goes well
, they ' ll receive a nice bit of ransom money
and life goes onthe
. what parker
and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family
, whose patriarch is a feared crime boss
. moreover
, two bodyguards
( nicky katt
and taye diggs
) constantly escort her
. these two protectors find an eerie sense ofthe pleasure when being confronted
adn tested in life
and death situations
. they would rather die than fail
; thus their bravado level is equally high
.
but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker
and longbaugh are a bit higher
,
annd they employ some unusual
bu fun
- to
- watch tatics to pull off the kidnapping
and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow
- motion car chase down a series ofthe alleyways
. the next hour or so
, we watch the chidduck camp regroup
and assess their situation
. during thsi time
, additional plot lines come into play
and more
and more details are revealed
. because the chidduck ' s can not go to the police
and because of the speical circumstances involving tje kidnapping
, we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome
. we dicover that not everyone inaddition the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause
. as a result
, there are undercurrents of a conspiracy
,
and elements of betrayal
and subterfuge
. the sepia
- toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings
, shrills of intrigue
and crescendos tyhat tell us ofthe life
and death situations that are about tothe occurr
. the momentum
and the coolness of the film
,
however
, begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes
, which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom mony
. yuo can expect lots of bloodletting
and an odd denouement
. in fact
, you may admire this film more than you like it
.
yet
, for the most part
,
" teh way of the gun
" stays on target
. it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy
and gunplay
,
and smart fo its invective dialogue
adn tough guy poetry
.
