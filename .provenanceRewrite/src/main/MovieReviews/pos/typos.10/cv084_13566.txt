. it consists of many swamps
and slums
and
, on the otehr hand
, rich estates owned by the town ' s different benefactors
. the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town ' s ritzy
, expensive high school

. there ' s guidance counselor sam lombardo
, police offcers ray duquette

, dark mysterious senior suzie toller
,
and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan
. we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor
,
but none more than kelly
. throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape
. shortly affter
, suzie
, too
, confesses that sam raped her as well
. this pushes kelly ' s sex craving mother
, sandra
, to stop at nothing until sam is convicted
. during tyhe trial
, kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her
.
howver
, it is later revealed by suzie thast sam never raped either of the girls
, it was all a vengeful plan aginst the guidance counselor
. after sam is cleared
, kelly ' s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her
. it is
then revealed that sam
, kelly
,
and suzie were all in onthe it together
. it is here tyhat the film starts tothe reveal just who is being honest with each other
and who hasnt thier own hidden agenda
. matt dillon stars as sam lombardo
. sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into
,
and sam obviously konws it
and uses it to his own advantage
. he isn ' t the obvious best ofthe actors
,
but dillon does give a convincing performance
.
however
, his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film
, making it look as
though his character has lost all ofthe his ethics
annd principles
,
although he never had many tothe start out with in the first place
. neve campbell
, who most people relate to scream
and scream 2
, plays blue bay outcast suzie toller
. suzie obviously hasnt some serious issues to deal withthe which are obvious fomr her first scene in the film
. campbell isnt very successful with this character
, adding the slightest bit of charm to a seamingly repulsive carachter
and making her fun to watch
. playing kelly van ryan is denise richards
. kelly is your typical
, rich
, sexy
, head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses
, like her sexpot mother sandra
. oen of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares
annd contrasts the relationship bewteen kelly
and her mother
. denise richards
, still hot off the press from starship troopers
, gives the most interesting performance in the entire film
. in the beginning
, kelly looks tothe be a paper thin character
,
but richards adds a little more spice
and ultimately mkaes the charcter not onyl sexy
,
but dominating as well
. kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette
. this character looks to be one of the most boring
, predictable in the film
.
however
, it is a relationship revealed between him
and suzie that adds depth to his story
. still
, the film doesn ' t seem to gain much from bacon ' s performance
, only his name
. infront the supporting cast
, theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan
, daphne rubin
- vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez
,
and bill murray shines as sam ' s lawyer
, ken bowden
. hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to teh film
.
although wild things was displayed by the press as bieng an erotic thriller
, hte eroticism
, which is portrayed with good taste
, is kept tothe a minimum
and focuses more on teh plot
and the relationships between the characters
. this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it ' s share of twists
.
