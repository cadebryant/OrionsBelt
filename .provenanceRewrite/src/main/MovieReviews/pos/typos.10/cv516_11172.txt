luckily
, some people got starship troopers
. some people knew it was supposed tothe be silly
. for those of ytou who didn ' t
, how coudl you miss it
? from the very beginning
, when we see an interactive internet
- like promotional video for the armed forces of the future
, it should be obvious this film is tothe be taken lightly
. i guess without blatant one
- liners
and home alone style slapstick
, some people just don ' t recognize such goofy humor
. such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned
. firt thnig to do before seeing this movie
- lighten uv
. meet the equivalent of
" beverly hills 90210
" meets
" mighty morphin power rangers
"
. four close friends are now graduating high school
anbd are ready to join the armed forces
, which
, in the future
, means fighting for tje whole galaxy
and not just your country
. johnny rico
( casper van dien
) is ready to join the infanty
, mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez
( denise richards
) has enlisted to be a pilot
. dizzy flores
( dina meyer
) has enlisted as a trooper
,
and it ' s possible she ' s joining mearly to follow rico
, whom she ' s always had eyes fo
. if you saw these three on the street
, you ' d automatically start searching for the fashion designers
and photographers
, for never has a movei ' s cast looked so much like the cut
- out cover of
" seventeen
" magasine
. the lone non
- supermodel
, carl jenkins
( played by doogie howser himself
, neil patrick harris
) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division
, the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie
- er
, carl out of tje picture
.
( good call
- now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters
)
. right off the bat
, rico becomes the star of the show
, far surpassing all tghe other soldiers
and becomming squadron leader in a short period of time
.
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise
( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen
) leaves rico ready to call it quits
. with his bags packed
and his civilian clothes back on
, johnny isnt ready to walk off base
and catch the next flight home
. well sorry
, rico suave
,
but there ' s no place like home
, especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it
. that ' s right
, the planet is being attacked by a collony ofthe arachnid
- like alien beings that a can of raid just isn ' t gonig to destroy
. with a sudden change of heart
(
and clothes
)
, rico isnt back in the game
, following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs
. what starship troopers really is
, is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on
- the soap opera like love affairs of high school
, the loev for sci
- fi
and thirst for gore shared by this smae age group
, etc
. nothing is taken seriously
. it ' s almsot as much a satire on young adults as clueless
,
but with its sly
adn futuristic approach
, it ' s not as recognizably so
. it ' s a spoof so subtle thyat many won ' t recognize the spoofery
. if you deem this as sci
- fi
/ action
, you ' re wrong
. it ' s sci
- fi
/ action
/ comedy
, with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2
. starship troopers just may be onthe the road to cult status as well
. gore isnt a factor heavily brought up inwhich reviews of this film
,
bu the gore
, too
, is meaned to be cheesy
. yes
, it ' s graphic
,
bu it ' s also brutally phony
,
adn that ' s what makes it such great fun tothe watch
. not sicne the old
" mr
. bill
" skits on
" saturday night live
" hasnt torture
and mutilation been such a joy to watch
. people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated
. perhaps it brings back fond memories ofthe the severities we inflicted apon our sisters ' barbie dolls as young children
. with the actors resembling ken
and barbie so closely
, it ' s a good chance thsi is the case
, whther we ' re fully aware of it or not
. starship troopers has it ' s slow parts
,
bu it ' s truly an alternative to your typical sci
- fi
/ action flick or lame juvenile comedy
. aside from the intentionally cheesy gore
, the special effects are qtuie astounding
. when the spaceship passes a meteor
, it ' s qutie an awesome spectacle
, visually crisp
and captivating
. if you ' re looking for brainless fun
, this is the epitome of your search
. a beautiful cast
, awesome special effects
, fast
- paced acation
, campy acting
,
and a whole lot of gore
. this is brainless heaven
. just remember not to think
.
