i can hear the question alreay
. what on earth do these twpo movies have in common
? to most people
, not a lot
, except that both are by renowned directors
. as i saw them
,
however
, both movies have flawed rumatic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers
.
but oh
, how differently the packages affect their films
. while
" everyone ' s
" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something speshal
, jane campion ' s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous
annd uninvolving laura jones ' script isnt
. i left
" everyone says i love you
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face
. i left
" the portrait of a lady
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
anbd i could have cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn ' t done before storywise
. woody isnt again desperately in love with a beautiful woman
( roberts
)
,
and against the odds they manage to click forthe awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong
-
- again
. similar situations happen to his family
and friends
. some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his
" early
, funny
" films
. the scenes between tim roth
and drew barrymore could have come out of
" take the money
and run
,
" his directorial debut
.
however
, nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one
- of
- a
- kind display of sheer ogod spirits
. in fact
, in this movie
, the feeling itself is what ' s most important
. yes
, the movie would have been better
-
- among his very best
, i think
-
- if it had a meatier story
.
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for inaddition feeling
.
and what better way to express feeling than thru music
? love isnt often best expressed in a song
,
and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart
. some are a tad too goofy
, such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor
,
but i admired allen for even puting them in htere
. it also helps that as usual
, allen has a top
- flight cast working with him
. their singing voices range from quite good
( goldie hawn
) to not quite good
( allen
) to litterally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose real voice was dubbed by a professional
)
.
but while their vocal abilities differ
, all the actors do a gerat job of putting joy uv ther onthe the screen
,
and making it rub off onthe tje audience
. granted
, some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies
,
but for those attuned to it
, this film should work wonders
. jane campion
, too
, has a top
- flight cast working for her inspite
" portrait of a lady
,
" too
,
but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film ffrom being a stilted
, virtually lifeless mess
, albeit a visually interesting one
. campion
and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a gerat variaty of eye
- filling images that linger in thte mind
. unfortunately
, waht didn ' t linger in teh mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting
. i remember very well shots ofthe a train with its light beaming
and shots ofthe men vanishing around nicole kidman
,
but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people
. even worse
, i don ' t find myself feeling bad that i ' ve forgotten
. tyhe probelm
, i tihkn
, lies not with the cast
, which seemed to be trying very hard for the material
. it was the script that couldn ' t convince me to care about anyone
. the cahracters were putting out all kinds of emotion
,
but i found no reason to connect with any of them
. i understoon that the story was about cold
, emotionally vacant characters
,
but for me to care about them
, i have to identify with them somehow
and want them to inject feeling inot their lives
. jones ' script never simply gave me that opportunity
. in tje end
, it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes
. unfortunately
, as she kept painting these dazzling pictures
, they only served to push me further away fomr the material
and remind me that there was no connection between me
and the film
. in the end
, the movie ' s oen strength ended uv hurting it
. so here we have two films iwth pretty uninteresting plots
,
and
yet i wass able to truly enjoy one ofthe them
. why
? with both films
, my head cared about neither story
,
but only
" everyone says i love you
" was able tothe make my heart sing
.
