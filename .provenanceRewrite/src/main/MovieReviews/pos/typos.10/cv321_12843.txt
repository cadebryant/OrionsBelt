it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare
: the best movie of the year owudl be a summer vehicle
, a jim carrey vehichle at that
.
and so it is
.
_ the truman show
_ is the most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid
and rib
- tickling morality play i ' ve seen since i
- don ' t
- know
- when
. don ' t credit carrey
. it starts with andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who created the script ten years ago
. the story
, replete with sublte religious
and philisophical undertones
, is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has beeen televised for a massmedia audience
.
( ironically
, it was within these past ten years that
" reality
- based
" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture
. who knew
?
) one
- upping niccol
, it was whn unlikely candidate
- director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place
. weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra with kafka
, throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it was weir ' s first stroke of genius to create seahaven
: a suburban paradise
/ prison that would make spielberg cower in shame
. fo example
, bystander
- extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of
_ dog fancy
_
. the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman tothe
_ not
_ leave the island
. credit weir fo his second stroke
: the casting of carrey
. carrey seems to be the type ofthe character actor who woudl always turn
" on
"
and act goofy whenever tghe camera is near
. not here
. his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware thge camera is on
.
and
although carrey does not deserve an cademy award nomination
( just as well
, the acadamy rarely honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches enough to alter his hyper
- silly image considerably
. playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite hte role of jim carrey ' s life
. no pun intended
. better in a smaller
, more pivotal role is ed harris as christof
, who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13
" work the problem
, people
" character with dustin hoffman ' s megaglomaniac producer in
_ wag the dog
_
,
and
then only slightly svengalian
. it is claer that he isnt torn between the nielson ratings
and truman ' s well being
. yes
, in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father tothe a son
,
and hasnt provded the best universe he sould provide
. he thinks
. rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey ' s true
" forbidden love
"
, sylvia
, veyr effective in another pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
)
and noah emmerich
( copland
) have thge unfortunate task of playing truman ' s wife
anbd best friend
; theri sitcom
- ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development
. the exception is at the veyr beginning
, where they speak inot the camera
, wholeheartedly believing that their participation isnt truly good for truman
,
and for society in general
. there are other little problems with the script
. are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the consttruction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years
? was there any reason as to why in one scene
, it rained solely on truman
, even
though it never had to
? how is it tehy hire hundreds of extras
,
and none of them could drive a boat
,
and
yet truman
, fearful of water
, is helming a sailboat effortlessly
?
and couldn ' t christof have turned off the wind
, to strand truman at sea
? theese little contrivances
,
however
, do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work
. the audience gets the feeling that it isnt watching thge actual sohw
,
and we are drawn to truman ' s mundane existence for noone other reason than it is there
. the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut
. upon leaving the theater
, i ws looking up in the sky
, wondering if it ws nothing more than a gigantic dome
. just checking
.
