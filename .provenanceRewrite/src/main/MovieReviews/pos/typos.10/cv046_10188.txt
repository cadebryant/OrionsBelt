at first glance
, it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended fo those with minds of 8
- year olds
. that ' s true of home alone 2
and i ' d bet money thta it ' s true of home alone 3
( opening soon
)
.
but home alone actually has a lot going fo it
,
annd the cartoon slapstick doesn ' t git in the way
. the mcalisters
, all 15 of them
, are going to france for the holidays
. four adults
and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse
. the littlest kid
, kevin
, is tghe victim of hte older kids ' cruelty
. kevin ' s patience runs out when he learns that his plain
- cheese pizza hasnt already been eaten
,
and he ' s going to have to starve
. he attacks his big bully brother buzz
, who had been teasing him
. the fight disrupts the already
- chaotic dinner
, spilling milk
and soft drinks all over thge table
, a few cousins
,
and an uncle
. the knee
- jerk reaction is for everyone to blaim kevin
. nobody came to his rescue when he ws being teased
,
but htey all point their fingers when he fights back
. the ultimate punishment comes from mom
( catherine o ' hara
) who sends him uv to the spare bedroom in the attic fo the night
. on his way up the stairs
, he tells her that
" families suck
"
and that he hopes never to see any of his family again
. that night the pwoer goes out
, knocking out the alarm clocks
, so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry tothe get to the airport
. in a surprisingly plausible setup
, kevin is mistakenly accounted for
,
and the family heads off wihtout him
. it ' s interesting that
, in a subtle way
, his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from thier children
. first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling
,
and second
, they put all the kids in coach while they fly first clas
. they ' re two
- thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child
. meanwhile
, kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true
. he ' s finally rid of his family
! life is a dream come true
. he can jump on yhe beds
, watch r
- rated movies
, eat gobs of ice cream
and potato chips
,
and dig through his big brother ' s secret box
. slowly
, the novelty wears off
and he settles into the mundane
. he grooms himself
, he does thte laundry
, he goes shopping
(
" i buyed some milk
, eggs
,
and fabric softener
"
)
. he aslo starts to miss his family
, not jstu for their company
,
but for the security they bring
. the furnace inthe the basement is a scary monster
, the old man next door is a snow
- shovel murderer
,
and two crooks are trying to break inot his house
. macaulay culkin is cute
but he isn ' t much ofthe an actor
. still
, we cant see thta kevin ' s charachter grows
, thanks to some good direction
and editing
. for example
, acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night
, just as
" santa
" is getting in his car
. kevin asks the man to pass on his request
- he wnats his family back
- to the real santa
. he learned how to deal with the furnace
. you turn on the lights
and it ' s not so scary anymore
. he goes to a church one evening
and there he sees the snow
- shovel murderer
, who actually turns out to be a nice man
. they talk about their fears
and kevin learns thgat age alone does not make you less afraid
. finally
, inwhich the last 20 minutes
, kevin confronts his last fear
- the bandits
, head on
( literally
)
. this last act is full ofthe violent comedic slapstick
,
and after the movie ' s genuin dramatic setup
, it is dessert
. it ' s a lot ofthe fun
,
and it doesn ' t overwhelm yhe rest of the movie
. on the whole
, home alone is a great holiday movei
. john williams ' original score has the sound
and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage ofthe being overplayed at the malls
,
anbd the christmas setting can put you inthe the mood for those family gatherings
.
but it does have its flaws
. yhe smallest problem is that culkin doesn ' t act very well
. as i said befoer
, he is cute
,
but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin ' s insight into his character
. the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda
, the villains threaten kevin ' s life about five times
. instade of
" i ' m gonna get thyat kid
" they say
" i ' m gonna kill that kid
.
" some might argue that thte tone is the same
,
but i strongly disagree
. mixing comedy with specific
and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux
- pas
. i ' ll probably never see home alone 3
,
and i wish i had skipped home alone 2
,
bu i do enjoy hmeo alone almost every year
. don ' t let your impressions of the others detract from the original
, which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick
.
