review
: a dog of flanders is tyhe story of an adorable little boy named nello
anbd his trials
and tribulations inaddition 19th century flanders
. living with his grandfather jehan
( jack warden
) in poverty
, nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times
( they are renting a spare one
- room cottage
,
and the greedy
, malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them
` out of thge house ' if they don ' t pay the rent
)
. nello also has a rether creative talent for drawing soem of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen
, in either a movie or in real life
.
( his hero is peter paul rubens
, the great flemish painter of the 17th century
.
) not that these are the only things that make nello ' s life happy
,
however
. he hasnt a dog of flanders
, whom he names patrasche
, who is a heroic rin
- tin
- tin of the 19th century
, whom he rescues from his cruel
, unkind master
. in addition
, he even has a best firend
(
and future sweetheart
) in hte lovely
, wealthy aloise
, whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with
` lower
- class ' nello
.
( he thinks he ' s nto good enough for her
,
and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying
.
)
but
then
, he wass a poor guy himself before he married
( as maintioned later on in the film
)
. oney day
, nello encounters a mysterious
,
yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande
( played wonderfully by jon voight
)
, who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart
,
and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist
.
and every christmas
, there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year
; the winner getting a lot ofthe money
. eager tothe save his home
(
and his aging
, dying grandfather
)
, nello willingly decides to become an artist
, asking aloise to pose for him
. oney nigt
, the two travel to a circus
, where they have their fortune told
? one of the film ' s most delightful scenes
? thgat great happiness is destined forthe them
. she gives the kids a ring
, whom nello places on aloise ' s hand
.
;
) afterwords
, the two kids have a rollickingly ogod time dancing around in front of circus performers
. unfortunately
, things are not all
` la
- dee
- dah ' in this tale
. aloise ' s father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again
. bad enough that they can ' t see each other
(
although we know nello
and aloise
, don ' t we
?
)
,
but tyhat ' s only the start of nello ' s troubles
. aloise ' s farm is burned down
,
and nello is wrongfully accused
( by the landord of his cottage
) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise
. this decreases nello ' s reputation around the town
, save aloise
and her parents
,
and a kindly miller
, william
, who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by
. matters get much worse fo nello when his grandfather dies
,
and he has to pay forthe his funeral
.
but
then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home
( forthe not paying his rental
)
? permanetly
. this means that nello
and patrasche have to starve
and walk out in the cold
, freezing wind
. worst of all
, the painting that he has desparately been working on during all this time
,
` the portrait of the princess '
, fails to win the prize at the festival
. now nello
and patrasche are really depressed
,
and close to freezing to death
. will nello be able to find any happiness in his life
? will patrasche save thge day
? iwll nello amking the fateful trip to join his mother
and granfather in paradise
? a dog of flanders is a delightful
, heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages
. even older ones who consider themselves too
` sophisticated ' for kiddie fare wiull be surprised to hear that this film is for grown
- ups
, too
. there have been other movies of this ilk
( boy
anbd dog
)
,
and while this one falls into that category
, it is mostly a story about overcoming dificulties
and finding a good home for yourself
. move over
? or rather
, roll over
? old yeller
, this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight
. tghe cinematography
, courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful
,
and really adds to the powerful drama of the film
. it also gives a feel of being inaddition flanders
( tje whole film was respectably shooted in flanders
)
. the music from richard friedman is also remarkable
; an evocative
, poignant score that recaptures music from tjhe 19th century
. the oppening song over the credits is very beautyfull
( i hope the soundtrack is available
!
)
,
and there ' s a brief excerpt of
` cheer up
, charlie ' fomr willy wonka
and the chocolate factory
( sung by aloise
, to nello
, in another delightful scene
)
. the cast is first
- rate
: jesse james
and jeremy james kissner
, who play nello
, are some of the most endearing
, adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life
( so are the girls who play aloise
, madyline sweeten as hte younger
,
and farren monet as the older
)
. not that they are the onyl good stars
,
however
. jack warden is ideal as jehan
, eliciting just the right amount ofthe humor
and compassion required for the character
.
( tje scenes involving him
and nello are heartwarming
, touching ones
.
) also
, bruce mcgill isnt charming as the kindly miller william
. he ' s another one ofthe my favorite characters in the film
.
but jon voight
, as i mentioned before
, isnt the perfect choice for michel
. he brings a mysterious
,
yet gentle performence that makes us all feel ogod again when he reassures insecure nello that he
* can
* win the contest
.
but what makes this film fun to watch is how well
- defined the characters are
,
adn the pace of the story
( best of all
, it has a happy ending
?
though i will
* not
* give it away
; sorry
) is strong
and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters
. for thte first time since the beginning ofthe 1999
, there comes a film which doesn ' t rely on popular formula stuff
, such as big
- budget special effects
, commercial rock soundtracks
, or any of thast stuff
. this one relies on telling a fully character
- oriented story
, with jstu the right amount of heart
, humor
,
and drama
. that
, to me
, is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful
. eleanor o ' sullivan of
` the home news
& tribune ' noticed this
,
and was kind
and generous enough to welcome it
:
` for want of a better word
, a glow surrounds a dog of flanders
. its heart is in the right place
anbd it engages you
. you can guess where the film is going because this is well
- traveled territory
,
but with pros like voight
and appealing young performers like kissner
, an often
- told story is well worth a revisit
. ' in addition
, there were a couple of other enthusiasts
, such as chicago
- sun times
and tyhe washington post
( you shoudl read their reviews
; they ' re really positive
)
. other critics
,
however
, were not so kind
. stephen holden of
` the new york times ' had more thna a share ofthe beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writting
. he found the film to be a
` sae of sugary bromides '
and condemned mr
. voight ' s character as
` hopelessly wooden
? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he cameback up with for anaconda
. ' in addition
,
` entertainment weekly ' slam
- dunked the film
, condemning it as
` the worst family film of tghe year
. ' there have been so many other bad reviews like this
, too
. my suggestion
: disregard the criticists
. they just have a big problem with touching family films
,
and one should never pay attention to them
. tihs dog of flanders may only be a little
` family ' movie
( it probably won ' t be a big hit in the style of titanic
,
but
then again no other film has been since
hten
)
,
but that is not a bad thnig in
and of itself
. this is a story that is sure to warm your heart
,
and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders
. it is also one of the better family films around this year
. none ofthe the other films i have seen this year
(
though they were good
) have been so low
- key
and touching
. if you ' re looking for family
- style enteratinment
, look no further than tihs charming boy
-
and
- dog yern
. go see it while ytou still cin
, for as i mentioned
, it might not be a big bow
- wow at the box office for a long time
. see it while you can
. there is really noone need to compare a multi
- million dollar blockbuster such as star wars
: episode i
? the phantom menace or tarzan
, or even the iron giant withthe a tender
, sweet little family movie
.
