he has spended his entire life in an awful little apartment
, raised
and cared for
and imprioned by his domineering mother
. she inspires his love
and his fear
,
annd instills in him a similar love
and fear of jesus
. he has a rudimentary grasp of laguage
, mouthing monosyllables
and repetitions ofthe his mother ' s phrases
. he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous
; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door
. he is 35
- years
- old in body
,
but a child in mind
and spirit
. he is the premise for bad boy bubby
, a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby
( nicholas hope
) who has spent his entire life inaddition an awful little apartment
, etc
.
, etc
.
then one day his father
( ralph cotterill
) appears
. his father is a shabby down
- at
- heels priest who appears tothe have permanently misplaced his religion
. unsurprisingly
, he isnt not thrilled witht the way
" his
" boy has turned out
. he is
,
however
, rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance wtih the mother
( claire benito
)
,
and
, more to the point
, her ample breasts
. soon they are copulating on the dingy couch
, while bubby crouches
, confused
, in the enxt room
, acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him hasnt a new interest
. bubby ' s relationship to the world may be warped
,
but it is at least stable
. hte father ' s arrival disturbs his precarious balance
, causing an oedipal conflict whic ends
-
- freud would be pleased
-
- in violence
and
, as a result
, freedom
. bubby intuits from his father ' s arrival thast the air outside is breathable
: he leaves the apartment
, his past
, his world
, behind
. so far
, so good
. the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby
, which bring us to this point
, are quite brilliant
. the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints ofthe bubby ' s hermetic two
- room universe
. it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise
: bubby is used by his mother for sex
, he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane
, he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins
. it is grim
and savage
and appalling
,
but also strangely tender
-
- de heer
, having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby ' s
, does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes
,
but simply empathizes
. he observes what it might be like
. the intensity ofthe these opening scenes
, wtih their minimalist mise
- en
- scene
, immerses us in a claustrophobic enviorment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our pwn world
,
and owes much to david lynch ' s eraserhead
, not least the ambient industrial white noise ofthe the soundtrack
. for thirty minutes
, the movie maintains the feel
and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own
.
then de heer lets bubby out
, brings him into contact with our world
,
and the film never qutie recovers
. our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide
, where he wanders tjhe streets
and meets people
, where he suffers
and lerans
and survives
. he is seduced by a young woman fomr a salvation army band
( how an anti
- social half
- wit with no sense ofthe hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his excape is not the sort of question the film encourages
, wisely
)
; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress
; he insults a traffic cop
and isnt punched in the stomach
; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group
; he is imprisoned
and raped
; he becomes a translator for menally handicapped people whose speek is impaired beyond comprehension
; he is loved by a motherly large
- breasted nurse
( carmel johnson
)
.
.
. it goes on
, by turns inventive
, silly
, tasteless
, endearing
,
and somtimes all of theese things at once
. de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world
: the tone shifts
, uneasily
, fomr fable tothe realism to satire
and bcak again
. the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest
; the film is best understood as a kind of parable
,
and
, indeed
, the religious implications of bubby ' s experiences are foregrounded
: icons of jesus on tje cross hang fomr the mother ' s walls
, bubby dons a priest ' s collar stolen from his father
, a church organ
- playing atheist lectures him on the necessity ofthe unbelief
, the woman who redeems him is named angel
. the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby ' s mind
, do not fragment him into psychosis
; rather
, the world accomodates him
,
and heals him
.
althought de heer ' s touch is at times overbearing
, bubby ' s salvation is touching
; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na
? ve humanist tale of improbable hope
. a hapless rock group write a song about bubby
and sing it for him
and so give him the gfit of community
. he returns tje favour when he steps on stage one night
and becomes their frontman
, turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art
,
and turning the band into a popular draw
. innosense triumphs
. bubby becomes a wholy fool
, an idiot savant
,
and graces us wtih wisdom
. it ' s a strange turn ofthe events
,
but by nowe we shouldn ' t be surprised
, because bad boy bubby ain ' t like other movies
.
