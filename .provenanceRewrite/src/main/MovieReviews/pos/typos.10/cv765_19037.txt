i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video
. it really scared me
,
anbd i didn ' t want to go see it
.
however
, after i heard about how wonderful it was
, i wanted tothe see it
. i didn ' t get a chance to do so
, until now
. tghe film
, disney ' s 25th animated feature
, opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale
: a long time ago in the land of prydain
, there was a king so evil
, that his spirit was captured in the cauldron
. it has been hidden for centuries
,
and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors
,
and with them rule the world
?
and destroy it
.
then
, we meet a farmer
- wizard
, dallben
,
and his young apprentice
, taran
. taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a
` pig
- keeper '
( they have a pig named hen
- wen
)
. one day
, as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath
, the pig goes crazy
,
and dallben
then realizes
, after watching hen wen ' s thoughts through a bucket of water
, that taran must hide hen wen iin the forest
. an evil ruler known as the horned king isnt searching for the black cauldron
,
and only hen wen has the power to show its location
. taran leads hen wen inot the forest
,
but of course
, he loses her
,
and tries to go find her
. along the way
, he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi
, who desires
` munchings
and crunchings '
, much to his dismay
( besides
, he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen
)
. when he hears hen wen ' s squeal from far away
,
though
, he racaus to her rescue
? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants
. taran chases after the gwythants
and finds himself staring at the horned king ' s castle from far away
. taran climbs the castle walls
,
and brings himself inot the castle
, where he attempts to rescue hen wen
. he manages to do so
,
bu he is himself captured
and thrown into yhe dungeon
. there
, he meets princess eilonwy
(
and her magic bauble
, another thing whcih the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron
)
,
and the two escape through the deep castle walls
. along the way
, taran finds a sword in a burial chamber
,
and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm
, who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie
. the three manage to escape the horned king ' s castle
,
but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic
. as they rest in the forest
, gurgi reappears
, claiming to have found hen wen ' s trail
. he leads taran
, eilonwy
and fflewdurr
, by way of
` pig tracks '
, to a whirlpool
. suddenly
, they all get sucked under
,
and they meet the fairy
- like fairfolk
. taran is reunited with hen wen
,
and informed that tje black cauldron is hidden in thge land of morva
. he
then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron
, it owudl prevent tyhe horned king fomr destroying their world
. with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli
, the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterous cottage
. it turns out to be no ordinary cottage
; threee comically strange witches inhabit the place
. when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron
, they agree to let him have it
? in exchange for his sword
. taran agrees
, much to eilonwy ' s horror
,
but at least they get teh black cauldron
.
but
? the cauldron can ' t be destroyed
, only its evil powers cxan be stoped
. the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free iwll
? never to return alive
. things take a turn for the worse whn the horned king ' s henchmen capture taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr
, along wih the black cauldron
,
and lead them back to the castle
. taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors
( this is the most horrifying scene in the film
, becuase here
, a dead army comes alive
?
)
. just when all seems lost
,
though
, gurgi reappears
,
and rescues taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr
. taran is about to jump into the black cauldron
,
but gurgi stops him
, not wanting him to throw his life awya
. gurgi
then jumps into the black cauldron
,
and the deathless warriors decay
. taran trys to find a way to rescue gurgi
,
but he isnt forced to do battle against the horned king
. he kicks the horned king away
, who isnt
then magically sucked into the black cauldron
, where its powers immediately destroy him completely
. taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr manage to excape from the horned king ' s castle just as it self
- destructs
. the witches
then reappear
and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away
,
but fflewdurr stops them
, saying that they
` never give anything away
, they bargain '
. in response to this
, the witches offer taran his sword bcak
,
but taran instead has a new trade
: the cauldron for gurgi
. the trade isnt made
; gurgi ' s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group
. as taran cradles him in his arms
,
though
, gurgi stirs
- he is not dead after all
! the happy group
then returns hmeo
, where hen wen
( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past
)
, dallben
,
and even doli
, await their triumphant return
. as spectacular as it soudns
, the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times
. before ron miller was fired ffrom his postion as chairman of walt disney productions
, he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron
, a sword
and sorcery tale for the studio
. bringing this book to the screen was the studio ' s fondest dream
. miller
, who entitled himself as the executive producer
, promised thta tehy owudl do so after they had prooved themselves on otehr projects
. when micheal eisner
and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio
, the animators were struggling tothe complete tyhe black cauldron
. by this time
, things had gone really rocky for the animation department
. many of the studio ' s old men hadnt retired or died
. therefore
, the animators suffered a hard time making tihs film
. originally budgeted at
$ 25 million
, thte costs raised to
$ 40 million because of constant changes onthe everything
?
and when it was finally released on june 24
, 1985
, the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics
,
but somehow the film flopped
. the film was rated pg
and the film
,
although
` disneyfied ' from lloyd alexander ' s chronicles of prydain
( which is what this film is based on
)
, was much more scarier
and darker than disney ' s other previous efforts
, such as tghe rescuers
and the fox
and the hound
, which is probably why so many people considered it too scary
and stayed away from it
. in addition
, other critics rejected it for having
` no heart '
and
` unmemorable '
, compared to other disney animated features
.
but whatever the real reason
, tyhe black cauldron was a financial disaster
, grossing only
$ 21 millon
. the failure ofthe the film grounded the studio ' s animation department
,
and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale
,
and it seemed liek animated features would no longer become a part of the studio ' s reputation
. the next two disney animated features
, the great mouse detective
and oliver
and company
,
although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron
, didn ' t do much better
(
although oliver
and company grossed much more than the black cauldron
and tghe great mouse detective
)
. only with the little mermaid doed the studio regain its reputation fo successful animated features
. as for tje black cauldron
, it was rereleased in soem cities for a temporary time under the title taran
and the magic cauldron
. finaly
, the studio locked the film in the film vault
and denied that it ever even was released
. because ofthe all this
, you might ask yourself
, wass tghe black cauldron really such a bad movie
? the peopel who had seen the film didn ' t think so
. in fatc
, many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film
,
but of course
, they denied it
. for a while
, it seemed liek the black cauldron woudl never be released to video
? until september 1997
, disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom
. few people imported the video from england
anbd converted to ntsc
( including me
)
and for those who hadn ' t seen the film
yet
( i am included here
)
, they got quite a treat
.
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warrriors
, baout 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would git a u rating
( in the uk
, the u rating means universal
: suitable for all ages
, kinda like their own verison of g
)
. somewhere online
, a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petetion tyhat said
,
` bring back the black cauldron
! '
,
and because of that
, disney finally desided to release the video to the untied states
. before that time
, rumors online had beeen made that the video would be trimmed
, like the uk video
, so that it would get a g rating
,
and that tehy would add in songs
. those rumors were put tothe rest wehn the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron
* would
* be released in its pg rated version
. even still
, when it was finally released to the us
, some reaction was mixed
. soem felt that it was indeed cut
,
but soem felt that it wasn ' t
.
but theese where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable
, since a film tyhat was absent for thirteen years was finally available
. as for myself
, when i saw the movie for the first time
( on converted ntsc video
)
, i didn ' t expect much at all
. in fact
, i had heard so many mediocre things about it
, thast i didn ' t think the film would ever be such a good film
. much to my surprise
, when i saw the firt few mintues of the film
, i was asking myself
,
" this is the same film everyone saw
? tjhe one that flopped at the box office
? the one that critics
adn filmgoers alike called
" a bad movie
"
? this doesn ' t seem like all of teh above
. instead
, it ' s a classic in its own right
. tjhe film has a wonderfull cast of charactors
. there ' s taran
( grant bardsley
)
, an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig
- keeper
, hte story ' s hero
. the criticists hve said that taran is not likeable at all
,
bu the opposite is true
. he is brave
, loyal
,
and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on
. there ' s a likeable character here
! not that he ' s the only likeable character in the film
. there ' s gurgi
( john biner
)
, a lovable little
, uh
, thing who remains loyal to taran
, even
though they don ' t quite hitted it off at first
.
but another likeable character is yhe bad guy comic henchman
, a dwarf named creeper
( phil fondacairo
)
, who is loyal to the film ' s imaginative
and sinister villain
, the horned king
( voiced gruesomely by john hurt
)
,
yet he also fears his neck
. the other characters
, including the sidekicks
, a spunky
,
but sweet princess named eilonwy
and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm
,
and threee comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret
,
although pleasant
anbd likeable
, aren ' t quite as well rounded as they should be
. the story itself is an adventurous one
, a quest involving the mystical pig
, hen wen
, the black cauldron itself
,
adn an army of deathless ones with everything
: a hooking opening to a spectacular finale
. elmer bernstein ' s music also tells the story perfectly
, in a dark
,
yet calming manner
. the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film wass created in the darkest timne of the studios
. even
though htere are some occasional effects tyhat are not quite good
, like teh ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth
, the animation overall is top notch
. overall
? this film is an entertaining endeavor
. fans unfamiliar to yhe lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will git a kick out of this one
, except young kids
. there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney ' s other films
(
although some consider tghe stampede sequence from the lion king
and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary
)
, which is the main reason why tihs film is rated pg
. fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel
and the movie
. even
though it doesn ' t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film
, this film is a classic in its pwn right
,
and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given
. that better chance has finally come
. whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared
,
and the film has finally achieved its palce among disney ' s most proudest acheivements
. i can ' t help
but think
though
, whatever would have happened if tje black cauldron
* was
* a box office success
?
