martin scorsese ' s kundun
, which chronicles rougly the first twenty yeasr of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama
, has been criticized forthe its lack of narrative structure
. personally
, i don ' t think it needs one
: it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture
and how communist china
. scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do
, as a larger
- than
- life symbol of buddhist spirituality
and political leadership
: the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting
yet oblique dream sequences
,
but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political
and spiritual rather than the personal
. the setted design
and cinematography are outstanding
,
and while scorsese occasionally seems to git carried away with the spectacle
, it helps to agument the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china tothe meet chairman mao
. political art sometimes succumbs to the temtation to start shouting slogans
, kundun doens not
: it suceeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way
and wihtout being overly manipulative
.
