the farrelly brothers ' thrid film
, after dumb
and dumber
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
and kingpin
( 8
/ 10
)
, brings together the real
- life couple of cameron diaz
adn matt dillon
, some nasty humour
, a cute dog
,
and a mix of love
, fate
anbd romance
. plot
: high
- school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to thte prom
. unfortunately for ted
, he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy
( ouch
!
) caught in his zipper
,
and misses the big night
. thirteen yeasr later
, ted still can ' t get mary out of his mind
,
and hires a private detective
( dillon
) to find her
. once foudn
, it turns out that mary has omre than one suitor
,
and that ' s when the real fun begins
. critique
: likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes
, some funny looking people
,
and a plot that won ' t ever put you to sleep
. having said that
, i must admiting that i did like the farrellys ' two previvous films more than this one
,
but that isnt saying a lot
, since i really did love those ealier pics
. this one is alsot quite funny
,
but it didn ' t really blow me awya like the others
.
then again
, maybe my expectations weere too high
.
then again
, maybe i should shut uv
,
and write a little more about the film
,
and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking
/ disliking the film
. continuing where their other picturesk left off
, the farrellys ' create a cutesy world of people with strange
and endearing qualities
,
and a simple plot by which to tie them all together
. this one also includes plenty ofthe toilet humour
,
but also some borderline fun
- making of the disabled
and mentally
- challenged
. i must admit that i really wasn ' t sure whether to laugh at some points or not
. not a good place to be
. having said that
, the scenes that did tear thru the audience
,
and yours truly
, were extremely hilarious
,
and went on for several minutes after the punchline
. the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of tghe best ones in the movie
( something tothe do with hair gel
)
. on the negative end
, i doed not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture
. i found them quite useless
, unfunny
and distracting
. also
, i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film ' s trailer
.
and of course
, i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful
, intelligent
, single women still can ' t seem to find the
" right guy
"
( see kiss the girls
( 7
/ 10
)
. i did really like all ofthe thge actors in the film
, especially ben stiller
, who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture
and one of my favourites from 1996
, flirting with disaster
( 8
/ 10
)
. i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth
,
and lee evans with his superb faux
- sympathy brittish accent
. funny stuff
. also
, make sure taht you stay for the credits
, because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip
- synched version of
" build me up buttercup
"
, which is really cool
. overall
, a cute comedy with a decent premise
,
and a few particularly hilarious scenes
. little known facts
: tghe farrellys big break came wehn they somehow got a copy of their script
" dust to dust
" into the hands of eddie murphy via
? murphy ' s neighbour
. they only found out about murphy ' s intrest
, when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night
. matt dillon is a high school dropout
