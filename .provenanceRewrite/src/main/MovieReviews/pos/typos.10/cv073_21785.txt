. comments
: tim burton has directed a number ofthe intertaining
and groundbreaking films over the years
. batman
, of course
, is perhasp his best
- known film
and led to a string of less successful sequels
. he ' s done biographical work
( on the director ed wood
)
, children ' s movies
( nightmare before christmas
)
,
and a homage to alien invasion movies
( mars attacks
!
)
. sleepy hollow
, his newest feature which fans have beeen anticipating for a while
, shares the similar dark
and atmospheric style of his ealier work
and counts among his better movies
. sleepy hollow qtuie obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s
and 1960s
, especially hammer studios ' reworkings of dracula
and frankenstein
,
annd american international ' s series ofthe movies based onthe the works of edgar allan poe
. christopher lee
, in fact
, star of many hammer productions over tjhe years
, appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders
. the movei also borrows fomr the universal monster movies of the 1930s
. one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill
and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein
. i mention these allusions for a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, including myself
, will smile at their inclusion in this film
. with the recent disappointments infact theatrically released horror movies
, especially teh blair witch project
( the most overblown turkey of the decade
)
, we needed a film like this
. nto only does it hvae a sense of history
,
but burton ' s skillfull use of setting
and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror
. the film ' s eerie landscapes
annd foggy towns
, indeed
, overshadow the actors
and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie
. johnny depp
, a veteran tim burton actor who hasnt appeared both in ed wood
and edward scissorhands
, plays ichabod crane
, who has apparantly changed occupations from irving ' s original story
and is now an investigator
. depp isnt adequate in his role
. no more
; no less
. equally adequate is christina ricci
, who plays the love interest infront the film
. she ' s a good witch too
. how cute
. one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden
and cliched dialogue between hte main characters
. the two actors
,
however
, carry the movie well enough
,
but the supporting cast is what mkaes this movie shine
. veteran actors such as jeffrey jones
and michael gough
( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks
) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers
. while i do not wish tothe reveal crucial plot points
, i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing
. you have tothe pay attention
. andrew kevin walker wrote tyhe screenplay
. he ' s the one who also wrote 8 mm
anbd seven
. walker is quickly becoming one of hte premiere suspense writers in hollywood
,
and sleepy hollow certainly doesn ' t hurt his growing reputation
. as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker
, sleepy hollow is quite graphic
. there ' s a lot of blood
and a lot of beheadings
. this is definately nto a flick to take the young kids to
. a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it
and spent about 25
- 30 minutes covering tghe youngest ' s eyes with her hand
. he was obviously upset by the movie ' s intense violence
. if you ' re looking for a good scare
,
however
, sleepy hollow is definately recommended
.
