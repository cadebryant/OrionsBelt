eight years after its realease
, disney has decided to re
- release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days
(
anbd 17 long nights
) only
. coincidentally
, it was reintroduced tothe theaters the same day fox ' s animated film anastasia was released
. you know disney
, they can ' t deal with thge threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie
, so when someone else wants to make a little mnoey
, they counter with an old
" masterpiece
" from their vault
annd
, you nkow what
, i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox
. let noone one say disney isnt losing its monopoly onthe the market
. they still have hotels on boardwalk
_
and
_ park place
. believe it or not
, today
, november 25
, 1997

.
, i saw the little mermaid for the first time
. it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven yeras ago
, when i stayed with one of my mom ' s friends for a couple weeks
. they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly
and
, over that two week period
, i heard every song from tghe movie probably a hundred times
. by the time i got bcak home
, i promised myself i ' d never see the movie
.
but promises are made tothe be broken
, especially wehn you ' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagement
. damn those shrewd disney marketers
and their mind games
. the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale
,
but it ' s disney
- ized
, which means lots ofthe talking animals
and bursting into song
. it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times
. i never wanted so much tothe be a pair of shells
.
.
. the heroine
, of course
, is ariel
( voice of jodi benson
)
, a 16
- yearm
- old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase
. she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship
and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett
, who tries tothe orient her to the mysterious world of humans
. she ' s aslo dealing with feelings she hasn ' t had before
-
- which comes whn you get scales in places you didn ' t use to have them
-
- about a handsome prince
( no disney movie would be complet without one
)
. her father
, king triton of the merpeople
, strictly forbids such lusting affter the ways of the
" savage
" humans
, in a condemnation thast reads as a nto
- so
- subtle analogy about old
- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating
. what ' s a king to do
,
though
? the girl ' s infront love
and even total destruction ofthe her little shrine to the human world doesn ' t deter her
. ariel saves the prince ' s life when a hurricane rises up
,
and just has to meet him
. she makes a deal with ursula
, the sea witch
( voice of pat carroll
)
. you know she ' s evil because she has a huge potbelly
adn one of the worst asses infact ctaroon history
. she also has octopus tentacles for fezent
( something those dr
. scholl ' s corn pads will not fix
)
and offers to help ariel out
. she ' ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice
; ariel has threee days to make that prince kiss her
, or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever
.
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple
, she ' ll fall asleep forever
. it ' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world
, coming after such lacklustre efforts as the black cauldron
annd oliver
and company
. it ranks as one ofthe the best disney cartoons
, certainly since the ' 50s
. all the elements are there
-
- memorable songs like
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss the girl
,
" cartoon animals like sebastian
and flounder
, an evil villin who still hasnt characterization
and charm
,
and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children
. the little mermaid is worth a big
- screen ticket in 1997
, so hurry up
, you only have five days left
. serving america for more than 1
/ 25th of a century
