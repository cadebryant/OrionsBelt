gregg araki ' s thte doom generation ws possably thte vyre worst film ever made
. so why doed i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus
? frist ofthe all
, smoe ofthe thge reviews weere fairly positve
. allso
, yhe casted
, consisting ofthe cameos ffrom dozens ofthe washed uv ex tv stars
( includng christopher knight
, eve plumb
, shannen doherty
,
adn david liesure
) wass promising
. lastest ofthe all
, i wnated tothe give arraki oen moreso chance
. i mean
, tghe guy cin ' t be thgat untalented
, cin he
? tje answer tothe thast question isnt threee letters long
. nowhere follows tje charactor dark onthe his wild
annd odd journy thru los angeles
. usance arraki doesn ' t nkwo how tothe amke anytying coherent
, it ' s hard tothe discribe tje plot
. let ' s jstu sday thta dark spends tjhe bulk ofthe thge movei whinning thyat his girlfriend won ' t amking a committment tothe him
annd jelous becasue she sleeps aroud wiht otehr guys
adn girls
. thge onyl remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who hasnt a chance encounter whith a famoust tv star
. he turns outloud tothe be a nice guy who doesn ' t care forthe fame
adn wishes he coudl walk down hte strent wihtout bieng mobbed by fans
. tihs stroy hasnt a shocking twist
annd a tradgic end tyhat i doed nto see comming
. it isnt thge frist tiem i ever falt any compassion fo a carachter creaeted by arraki
,
adn thsi cant be atributed tothe tyhe appealling performence ofthe lassez
. i thougth maybee arraki ws inproving inthe his craft
. he works better whith thte camera thsi timne aroud
, especialy iin thge easly scenes
. halfway thru tyhe film
, i didn ' t neccessarily fidn mysef enjoying tjhe film
,
bu it seemed liuke a considerable improvment onthe tjhe doom generation
.
thn as tje movei whent onthe
, arraki loses all sensibility
anbd introduces us tothe exploding heads
, twisted sex ganes
,
anbd aline abductions
. it ' s sad
, beccause he allmost actally hadnt smoe decent material here
,
bu he ruined it iwth his usual infront your face
" i ' m such a renegade maverick filmmaker
, look wqat i cin dont
" atitude
. tjhe performances are generaly better tahn inspite teh doom generation
, whlch isn ' t saying much
. at least we don ' t ahve tothe suffer jonathan
" i am tjhe most hideous man infact amercia
" schaech
. we are
,
howver treated tothe anyother round ofthe james
" i ' m omre wooden tahn keanu
" duval
. sarah lassez gives thge best performence inwhich yhe film
,
annd kathleen robertson
( fromerly ofthe 90210
annd nowe arraki ' s wief
)
adn rachel true are talented actresses caught uv inwhich tihs mess
. ofthe thge tv star cameos
, john ritter isnt tyhe most intresting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist
. if i preferr nowhere tothe tghe doom generation
, it isnt onyl inwhich yhe way taht i woudl preferr bieng assasinated thna recieve constatn fysical torture
. mabye greg arraki doesn ' t wanna ytou tothe liek his cahracters
. mabye he wnats tothe laff
annd amking funn ofthe thsoe ofthe us who try tothe care baout them
. maeby he jsut wnated tothe piss me off
. if so
, he wass sucessful
.
