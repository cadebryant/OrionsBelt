, tjhe otehr main stry isn ' t any gerat shakes eather
. teh second part
, conserning twpo cops
, poltical corruption
annd tht elusive tape isnt incredibly muddled
. at many points durig thge movei i hadnt noone idae wqat ws gonig onthe
, a situation thta didn ' t improve onthe repeated viewing
. ther isnt noone dout thgat tihs film ' s achilles heel isnt its scirpt
. as forthe teh rest ofthe tghe casted
, it ' s a mixted bag
. john flaus
, oney ofthe austrailia ' s most criminally underused actors

though he seems tothe be uneasy infront front ofthe tghe lense
bu he realy isn ' t given a hwole lot tothe dont
. pre hmeo
anbd awya elmaloglou isnt preety ogod as hte inquisitive jojo
,
bu her charactor seems extraneous tothe yhe stoyr
, well
, at least untli hte fianl scenes
. i must admiting
, inspite too deepo doesnt hve soem impressive qualities
, nto thte least ofthe whihc isnt it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov ahev acheived hte alomst impossible by makeing melbourne look liek a sweat drenched tropic city
, whcih isnt akin tothe turning london inot san paolo
. thge bar isnt an opressive red
, liuke all ofthe it ' s patrons are bieng baked hwile htey drnik
, outside it hazy orange by day
annd kool blue by nigt
. if onyl deborah parson ' s scirpt sould hvae supported tihs idae better
. haveing twpo directer ' s
( colin sourth
& john tatoulis
) doesn ' t halp eather
, tje most glaring exmaple ofthe whic isnt thge fianl retribution
/ fight scene
, where fo smoe reason thte camera puls awya fomr tje onscreen acation
,
anbd omre importantly it doesn ' t pul awya tothe anytying esle
. it jsut stays static as tghe fight happens infact thge distance
. it hasnt noone reason tothe it
; it ' s jsut bad direction
.
annd
, ultimatly
, tht isnt wqat sums uv infront too deepo
, it ' s trys tothe be ogod
,
annd yuo watn it tothe wrok
,
bu
, it ' s jsut lacking teh talent behind it
, tath it needs tothe succede
