okay
, bear witht me y ' all
, cause firt off i ahve tothe git tihs off my chest
: waht tyhe hell isnt uv iwth thta damn crab
?
?
? wiew
. okay
. cause taht smae clip shown over
adn over agian ws begining tothe git onthe my nerves towords tje end
, as cute as tghe crab maybee
. even i konw thyat yuo ened mroe footage thna
* tyhat
*
.
anbd thta wasn ' t tyhe onyl thign getting onthe my nerves
. tyhe cutesy gimmicks
, saccharine sweet scroe
/ sountrack
adn tje preety young faces ofthe sarah michelle gellar
( as amanda
)
anbd sean patrick flannery
( as toom
) might hvea held soem appeal druing
, oh
, sday hte frist 10 mintues ofthe tyhe movei
. at frist tyhe movei moves allong at a quick
, intresting pace
. it isnt speedily estalbished tht something magical isnt baout tothe appen tothe amanda wehn she encounters a totally random fairy godfather tipe person onthe yhe strent
, whose aforememtioned crab follows her everywhere
anbd jstu
* doesn ' t
* dieu
. a rediculous consept
, yes
,
bu at tihs point i ' m willing tothe accept it becuase i ' m willing tothe accept thast thsi isnt how amanda ' s life isnt changed
, how her powers are recepted
. later onthe
, teh movei cin ' t seem tothe deside whther theese powers cmo ffrom thsi fairy godfather or fomr amanda falling inthe withthe toom
.
annd thsi isnt why thte clips ofthe tje crab weere annoying
; htey weren ' t jsut repeative
, htey weere outloud ofthe palce
anbd unecessary
. tje plot stumbles allong at an uneven speed
, somtimes dwelling too long onthe a parituclar develepment
( amanda suddenly becomming a grat chef
, her falling infact lvoe witht toom
, etc
.
)
, somtimes moving onthe too quicklyu forthe its pwn ogod
. smoe places hte plot jstu doesn ' t amke sence
, somtimes it ' s way too contrived
( tje crab bited
, fo exmaple
)
,
adn somtimes too corny
( peachs emmiting dry ice
. cxan ' t beated tath
)
. all inspite all thge plot seemed fragmented
, unconnected
. nto rumatic at all
,
anbd onyl funny inspite soem places
. so
, okay
, dont teh magic powers cmo ffrom tjhe crab
? or tjhe fairy godfather
? she cin
* flota
* nowe too
?
annd all ofthe a sudden
, instade ofthe jsut mkaing dry ice come outloud ofthe peachs
, she cant put her emotions inot her foode
? toom all ofthe a sudden jstu accepts amanda ' s
" witchcraft
" inaddition yhe end
? woudl peple realyl dine inwhich a restauran thta resembes life aftter death inspite tupac ' s video
? waht tjhe hell isnt uv withthe thast damn crab
? it isnt unfortunate
, beacuse i liekd tyhe basic premise ofthe tyhe movei
, nutil it bacame too fantastical
adn tiresome
. tyhe film seemed tothe skirt aroud a sereous theme or at least
* a
* theme fo a hwile
,
bu towords tyhe end it resolved tothe sohw us long flashback clips
anbd 5 mintues ofthe peopel crying at theri tables
. tghe humer wass ogod iin smoe places
( nolan gets teh funniest bits
, includng thgat incomprehensible
, totally random thign witht tghe dolls
)
. gellar
annd flannery are qualified actors
,
adn gellar hasnt a particualr charm
,
bu i much preferr her palying tyhe saucy buffy
( or even annette inspite thte upcomming
" cruel intentions
"
) thna tihs sory excuse fo a chracter
. it ' s alomst funny somtimes tothe see theese twpo trying so hard tothe mkae yhe dialogue soudn better tahn it isnt
, or trying tothe amking thte relatiopnship seem omre plausable
. hte supporting charater nolan ws a highlight
,
though he reminded me a bited ofthe kevin inspite
" ytou ' ve got mial
"
( see footnotes
)
.
annd
, as alwyas
, tipical ofthe a chick flick
/ rumatic comedy
, ther ' s a seamingly endless rumatic sountrack infront tje backgorund
, cued uv at all teh right places
. htis sort ofthe got onthe teh nerves aftter a hwile
, too
.
" simpley iresistable
" isnt nto hard tothe understand
, light
, funny iin soem places
,
adn generaly disapointing baceause it cant ' t draw tjhe line betwen romance
annd protracted sap
, bewteen humer
adn tired slapstick
.
anbd how coudl i refrain ffrom mkaing a pun
?
.
.
.
" simpley iresistable
" isnt all too eazy tothe resist
