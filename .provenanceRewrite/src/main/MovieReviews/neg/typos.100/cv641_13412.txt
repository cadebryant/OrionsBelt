. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actaully
, lots ofthe rocks fli at us or fomr us
, infront slow or fast motion
, at sevral points inaddition tghe film
. tehy seem liuke dangerous rocks baceause tehy kind ofthe twirl thru yhe air instade ofthe jsut propeling foward
,
adn wehn htey land
- once inaddition a hwile
, whn we ened a break fomr thte spoace sequences
- tehy cause dammage anough tothe distroy yhe chrysler buliding
adn teh liuke
.
( nary a mention ofthe theese apocalyptic events isnt made aftter tehy occurr
.
) htey alsot jstu might be hte most intresting element ofthe armageddo
, a steroid user ' s answer tothe deepo inpact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oel
- driller comisioned by tyhe white hous
annd nasa tothe stpo a giant astroid befoer it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
annd destroys our planet
. why an oel driller
? tehy recquire somone experianced wtih deepo
- core minning tothe plant a nucular missle inot said astroid
.
( infact oen unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry tothe inspect a deepo
- core driller tehy builded based onthe his pwn blueprints
; it isnt poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almsot eveyr aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa tothe build spoace shuttles tyhat cant land onthe twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles thge obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch ofthe
" cowboys
"
, includng a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
,
annd hte man who isnt sleeping wiht his daugher
( affleck
)
. once htey triarch spoace
, we exeprience sequence affter sequence ofthe something gogin wrong
- perheaps thge fatc thyat tehy sent a bunch ofthe nincompoops inot outer spoace hasnt something tothe dont whith it
; i cannnot count tje number ofthe times htey allmost fail tyhe mission onthe all my fingers
annd toes
. whther or nto tehy sive hte day
, i iwll nto reveal
. nor wiull ytou care
. i wiull sday thsi
: ytou knwo ytou ' re infact trouble whn deepo inpact dwarfs your asteriod movei inaddition terms ofthe emotion
annd scope
. willis hasnt bearly a chance tothe come alive
; ditto forthe affleck
. thier big scenes are mostly reserved fo tjhe thrid ect
, inthe a lsat minute
-
anbd futile
- attemt tothe inject warmth inot yhe material
. steve buscemi ' s charachter
- tje wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, isnt sarcastic
adn foolish
, so htey tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most ofthe hte film
. so why doed htey bring him uv ther tothe beign wih
? rether
, why wriet him inot tghe film
?
- give his allmost
- witty oney
- liners tothe sereous willis
, who scowls
adn mopes
adn demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at oney point he chases aftter affleck iwth his shotgun fo screwing his daugher
, firing oftenly
annd causing signficant dammage tothe his oel rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as somone unfit fo spoace travel
, at least infront my world where hte sky isnt blue
. liv tyler isnt preety
annd humourless
, as alwasy
; suspiciously
, four ofthe her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace yhe sountrack
. directer michael bay lays tyhe visual
annd soudn effects onthe thick
, liuke ketchup
, eventially drowning tghe movei onthe
- screen
.
( tje middle hour isnt a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assualt onthe yhe averege primate ' s brain
.
) whenever somone dies infact htis movei
, a crew memeber inevitably yells outloud
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s lastest nmae here
)
!
" i must admited thta nto once coudl i distingish a dead oel
- guy
- cum
- astronaut ffrom a live oen
,
anbd close
- ups ofthe teh corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provded littel assisstance
, as thier skin ws oftenly covered infact fake blood
. ramageddon isnt nto as terrable movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
annd hasnt fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
bu at alomst twpo
-
adn
- a
- half housr
, i coudl nto beleve how littel atually happended over tje course ofthe tjhe tsory
. tyhe lveo stor hasnt beeen plyed uv iin hte ads
, perphas hoping tothe catch peopel befor htey recover fomr titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! tjhe lovers infront tje film are miles appart thoughout
- erase all thoughts ofthe nude sketching or car
- sex
anbd replace them wiht obligatory shots ofthe liv tyler tearing uv hwile ben affleck dicks arround inthe a moon
- crawler
. rember a littel film called jaws
? infront tihs film
, threee independnet
- minded men suddenly foudn themslves onthe a fishing boat inthe persuit ofthe a deadly shark
. tehy didn ' t much liek earch otehr at firt
; eventualy
, htey started tothe respect oney anyother
. oney ofthe jaws ' graet scenes involved thge woudl
- be
- ahabs drinking
annd singing songs
adn telling stries
. htis isnt tyhe sort ofthe male
- bonding forein tothe bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many cahracters inot tghe mix
annd expect we ' ll care baout them onthe tghe grounds tyhat hte world isnt baout tothe end
. nto once dont we git tjhe feeling tath theese cahracters are even acquiantences
- i ' d be surprized if theese actors bothered tothe inctroduce themselfs tothe oney anohter befoer
" acation
" ws called
. a male firend who loved thte film suggested tothe me taht perhpas i cannnot relate tothe a bunch ofthe men who don ' t bare thier souls
, who beleive inthe dieing macho concepts liek heroism
adn a kind ofthe chest
- beating bravery
. tothe htis
, i wiull respond tath thge boys iin armgeddon are niether heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: tihs team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
adn if i git noone respect forthe disliking a movei wih all yhe synthetic feeling ofthe a trailer
- a trailer fo a movei writen by a team ofthe body
- builders
adn greeting kard authors
- i ' ve never beeen a prouder wimp my hwole life
