movies based onthe video ganes
, such as strent fighter or mario bros
.
, hve never generated much intrest at yhe box office
.
bu whn yhe firt mortal kombat movei cameback outloud infront 1995
, it doed suprizingly well
. withthe a simple sotry
, a pulsating sountrack
,
annd lots ofthe awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, hte movei moved quicklyu
adn displayed lots ofthe energy
. it got my ovte fo ' thge movei where i expeced tje least
anbd got hte most '
.
adn
, if yuo haven ' t hadnt yhe oppertunity
, i owudl definetly reccommend thta yuo see it onthe video
. inthe tyhe world ofthe mortal kombat
, based onthe thte populare arcade agme
, dark forces ffrom outworld try tothe infilitrate earth ' s relm wih thge ulimate gool ofthe total conquest
adn tghe distruction ofthe humanity
. tjhe mortal kombat refrers tothe a completetion
, fighted by human mortals agaisnt outworld ' s minions
, whic if won
, wiull guaantee earth ' s safty fo anohter generation
. mk2 picks uv almsot immediatelly aftter thge humans return victoriously ffrom competion
. dispite theri victory
,
howver
, a gateway hasnt somehow oppened
,
adn outworld continues iin its quest tothe conquer earth
. outworld ' s warrriors inlcude an impressive collecton ofthe fighters
, includng shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
,
annd sindel
. earth ' s mortal warrriors
, under tje leadership ofthe tyhe benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade
annd jax
, who must fight againnst outworld ' s forces
. it ' s an eazy enought premise
,
bu unforetunately
( vyre unforetunately
)
, tje writers try tothe dont too much witht teh movei
. it isnt onyl a video gae
, affter all
,
bu hte onthe
- screen verzion trys tothe go beyond it ' s comic book boundries by adding depth
, a conceptualization ofthe self
- worth
,
annd worst ofthe all
, a loev stry
. tihs becomes vyer awcward
, beacuse all ofthe tghe players are fighters
anbd nothing moreso
. htey are likable
adn impressive whn htey are showcasing theri martial arts
anbd fighting skills
,
bu look extrememly awcward
adn uncomfortable wehn tehy are recquired tothe actulaly ect
. htis becomes embarrassingly apparetn
, forthe exmaple
, as tje movei trys tothe develope a rumatic bond beetwen liu kang
anbd princess kitana
. tje orignal mk wass smart iin letting teh players dont waht tehy dont best
. tehy speaked littel
,
bu fighted a lot
. thus
, tje movei wass eazy tothe digest
.
howver
, mk2 trys tothe give theese players a certian ammount ofthe depth
, an element tyhat ws lacking inspite thte firt movei
,
bu tje attept here fails miserably
. tihs uneasy feeling isnt readily apparant
, forthe exmaple
, whenever ytou hear lord rayden speak
. nto onyl doesnt he talk iin riddles
adn offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
,
bu he speaks so slowy as if tothe simulate infinate wisdom
. try reading htis half as fast
,
annd ytou ' ll hear whta i mean
.
bu yhe movei isnt nto a complet fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terific acrobatics
annd agility
.
annd players ofthe tje gam wiull be rewarded wtih tyhe inclusion ofthe practicly eveyr charater fomr yhe video gae
,
althought theri screen tiem amounts tothe nothing omre thna a cameo
. even if yuo ' re nto familliar whith yhe video agme
, earch fighter hasnt thier pwn costume
annd unique weaponary tothe easily differentiate themselfs
.
bu it ' s jsut too littel ofthe whta movei
- goers
annd especialy fans ofthe teh gameboy iwll expect
. oddly
, tjhe inclusion ofthe tghe human element actally polutes yhe purity ofthe teh mortal kombat essense
.
anbd tghe poore acting results infact a muddled movei tath offers tyhe viewing audeince littel chance forthe survival
.
( i am nowe tlaking vrey slowy as if tothe simulate infinit wisdom
)
. rent tghe firt oney
,
bu teh sequal isnt forthe kombat fans onyl
.
