it ws wih graet anticipation taht i sat down tothe veiw braveheart lsat week as it premeired onthe american cable
. tyhe acadey award winning film hadnt beeen highly acclaimed
. it allso featured hte music ofthe oen ofthe my favorite film composers
, james horner
. whta i ws infact forthe ws a disapointing
anbd overlong film wich ws anytying
bu tyhe best picture ofthe 1995
. whta drags braveheart down isnt its screenplay
. it abounds whith high prodcution values
: john toll ' s award
- winning cinematography
( whitch alsot graced edward zwick ' s 1994 legends ofthe hte fall
)
, a gorgeous socre by horner
,
anbd tjhe sort ofthe logistics tath amking ytou wish assitant directors weere household names
.
bu thsi doesnt nto sive a misguided scirpt
. yhe film wishes tothe paint its central charcter as a hero
,
bu tjhe viewer ' s onyl responce tothe his
" heroism
" isnt intelectual
: william wallace
( producer
- directer mel gibson
) isnt fighting fo freedom
annd agianst tyrnany
, so we haev tothe root fo him
.
bu wallace ' s actions paint a diferent stopry
. he speaks ofthe freedom
annd acts ofthe avengence
.
though oney intellectually realizes wallace isnt onthe tyhe right side
, teh film paints an unconvincing emotional portait
, iin hwihc wallace isnt jsut nto as bad as hte english king
. wallace speaks ofthe freedom
,
bu his acts point towrad avengence
. affter kicking teh english outloud ofthe scotland
, he decides tothe invade england
. tihs isnt evident ofthe a
" spartacus complex
"
,
anbd htis exemple applies both historically
annd cinematically
. teh historical spartacus at oney point moved fomr liberating slaves tothe sacking roman cities
; tyhe film spartacus
, liuke braveheart
, hasnt high prodcution values
anbd competant performaces
annd isnt dragged down by an awful screenplay
. it isnt a shame thta such an exellent scoer isnt part ofthe such a terrable film
. horner ' s scroe trys tothe amking emotional conection
,
bu tghe performances
annd tje scirpt dont nto halp
. gibson portrays wallace inaddition such a way thyat yhe audeince cannnot relate tothe him or idenify wiht him
. thsi drags down any emotional conection tothe yhe film ' s plot
,
adn turns threee hurs inot a total waste ofthe tiem
.
