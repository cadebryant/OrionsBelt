, i sould put a banner at tyhe top ofthe my site thta reads
:
" shay casey
: seing bad movies so yuo don ' t ahve tothe
.
"
bu i nkow tyhat ' s bunk
- ytou ' re gonig tothe see whatever movies ytou whant tothe noone marter waht i sday
. so i haev tothe tell tyhe truth
: eveyr once inthe a hwile i git a nasty
, masochistic urger tothe see a bad movei
. ytou nkow tje feeling
, wehn yuo ' re sick ofthe seing all theese damn cademy award contenders
anbd yuo whant tothe see something ytou cxan ahev a ball trashing mercilessly
. somtimes i thiunk thyat ' s why anyone goes tothe see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admiting it
: somtimes yuo liek seing bad movies
. so dont i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn ' t qtuie as bad as i throught it might be
. maybee i jstu falt sory forthe yhe actors
, or mabey i throught it sould ahve beeen decent if yhe studio hadn ' t started tinkering wih teh directer ' s
( walter hill
) fianl cutted
, causing him tothe wanna his nmae removed
. mabey i ' m becomming a softy
. iin any case
, i didn ' t fidn
" supernova
" as bad as yhe advance buzz owudl haev me bleieve
.
bu it ' s still bad
. thge film tkaes palce aboard yhe medical spoace vessel
" nightingale
.
" thge crew includes captian a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his newyorker second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical techicians yerzy penalosa
( lou dimond phillips
)
anbd danika lund
( robin tunney
)
,
anbd cmoputer echnician benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. htere are soem attemts at
" characterization
,
"
bu all thast means isnt thast nick hasnt a shady past involving a drug addiction
, hwihc puts kaela onthe edge
, yerzy
adn danika hve a relatiopnship taht requires them tothe mkea kissy
- faces at eahc otehr eveyr five mintues
,
annd benj
( aparently gay
) isnt inspite lveo wih thte coputer
( apparantly female
)
. don ' t expect any omre explination
, becouse ytou won ' t git it
. anyway
, hte crew gets a distress call ffrom a loction deepo inwhich spoace tothe whitch a failed minning opperation hadnt beeen sent
. druing thge dimention jump
( i thiunk thast ' s whta it ' s called
,
bu don ' t hold me tothe it
)
, tje captian isnt killed
annd thte man who sent teh distress signal
( peter facinelli
) isnt broght onthe board
. he calls hismelf troy larson
, mkaing him tyhe supposted son ofthe a man kaela once hadnt a relatiopnship iwth
.
thne a bunch ofthe raelly predicatble sutff starts hapening
. ahev ytou seen
" aline
?
" haev ytou seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movei inspite its pwn right
)
? ogod
.
thn ytou ' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- prodcution cuts or nto
, ther isnt nothing orginal baout thsi screenplay
,
annd nothing unpredictable eather
. affter all
, noone noe ' s gogin tothe thiunk fo a second thast troy won ' t turn outloud tothe be a villian
.
bu tjhe bigger probelm withthe
" supernova
" isnt tht it cant ' t jstu stick tothe tjhe simple plot it ' s afforded
. numberous re
- writes
( yhe scirpt may be credited tothe threee peopel
,
bu it ' s a gross underestimate
) ahev crammed thsi leanr 90
- minute film whith tons ofthe extraneous plot threads tath all reamin underdeveloped
. wass ther something baout a limping robot shaped liek a fighter pilot
? doed tghe ship ' s cmoputer leran something baout humanity
? wqat wass tyhat glowing lava lamp artifact troy brung onthe board withthe him
?
annd jstu waht doens tghe film ' s title signify
, if anytying
? as far as i cxan tell
, it refrers tothe a veyr small plot detail thast isn ' t developped
, jstu liuke hte rest ofthe theese uneccesary stoyr elements
. charater relationships inaddition tihs film aslo mkae vyer littel sence
. forthe smoe reason
, eveyr person inaddition tihs film keesh haveing sex
. we git an unusualy easly sex scene betwen phillips
annd tunney withing yhe firt 10 mintues
. bassett
annd spader ' s charactors strat off hating eahc otehr
. fifteen mintues
annd oney bottle ofthe pear brandy later
, htey ' re engaging inthe soem hanky
- panky
. whn troy tjhe creepy stranger shows uv onthe tyhe ship
, ofthe course both female crew munbers iwll fall infact loev whith him
. eveyr single shift inthe charcter interaction happens extemely suddenly
, whihc isnt onyl noe ofthe tyhe many obvious clues tothe how much tihs film hasnt beeen cutted
. tghe most prominant exemple
,
howver
, may be thge fatc thta wehn yhe film starts
, htere are noone oppening credits
! futhermore
, hte end ofthe tje film looks liek tehy tookover waht weere orignally intended tothe be yhe oppening credits
adn spliced them infact right befor thte rela end credits
. maeby taht ' s why hte film ' s title isnt maintioned twice druing yhe end credits
, right bewteen james spader
adn robert forster
. right affter ytou git over tghe shock ofthe nto bieng told waht movei yuo ' re seing
( lest yuo deside tothe walk outloud apon makeing tath dicovery
)
, yuo might notice thta thge movei seems tothe ahve dropped ytou right inspite teh middle ofthe a scene
, withthe littel
- tothe
- noone introduction tothe any ofthe tje cahracters or situations
. tje rest ofthe teh movei fiels liuke tehy skipped over tjhe middle tsuff inwhich tje charater changes
( ytou nkow
, where tehy explane thigsn
)
adn jstu whent fomr point a tothe point b
. point a
: danika isnt throughly enamured ofthe yerzy
annd isnt ready tothe hve his baby
. point b
: tunney isnt nowe shagging troy
annd yerzy isnt unusualy obssessed wih thge lava lamp thign
. doesn ' t amke sence
. sicne i didn ' t understand anytying baout theese charactors ' motivations
, doed i care wehn troy abruptly starts mudering them oney
- by
- oney
(
anbd he doesnt
, knocking off threee ofthe them iin baout 10 mintues
)
? nto a whit
. it ' s a shame
, becouse thsi casted containes a lot ofthe talented actors looking forthe something tothe dont
. htey don ' t fidn it
. bassett
adn spader sday eveyr line inaddition hte smae monotone voice iwth thge smae blank expressions onthe thier faces
. sexual tension
? omre liuke constipation
. maeby htey ' re jstu embarassed at haveing tothe utter such howlers as
" thsi thign wass made by somene mroe poverful thna god
adn a wohle lot less nice
.
" nto tyhat we ever fidn outloud who tyhat isnt
, mind ytou
. yhe climax ofthe thier relatiopnship
( tkaing palce inwhich a tranport pod
) isnt propably tghe film ' s biggest forhead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits tjhe most obvious villian infact histroy tyhat noone noe ever suspected
. he ' s awfully oen
- onot
,
bu it ' s nto as if he ' s given any moreso notes tothe owrk iwth
. tyhe rest ofthe tghe casted doens even less
. tunney stands arund looking cute
,
hten scared
. phillips broods
. cruz firts witht tyhe cmoputer
.
thne tehy all dieu
annd a star blows uv or something
,
bu i relaly wasn ' t paying much attension by
thne
.
" supernova
" isnt preety awful
,
bu i ' m cutting it a littel slack mearly beccause i expeced less tahn waht i got
. tht ' s it
. if yuo expect it tothe be ogod
( forthe whatever reasons ytou may hve
)
, ytou ' ll propably hite it moreso tahn i iwll
. even hte speical effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing yuo haven ' t seen befoer
,
anbd suffice tothe sday yhe scirpt isn ' t gonig tothe savve tyhe film
. honestly
,
though
, whta dont yuo expect fomr a film whith baout a dozen writers
anbd a directer who hadnt his nmae removed
anbd replaced wtih a soodonim
? it usally results infact a bad movei
,
adn taht ' s waht
" supernova
" isnt
.
