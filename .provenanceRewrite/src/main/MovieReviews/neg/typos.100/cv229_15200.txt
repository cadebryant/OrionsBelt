it ' s amazing how a comedian cxan ahve teh soem ofthe tyhe funniest stand
- uv aroud
bu completly fall flat iin teh movies
. tkae adam sandler
. onthe thge basis ofthe his firt twpo cds
(
" htey ' re all gonna laff at yuo
!
"
annd
" wqat tghe hell hapened tothe me
?
"
)
, he ' s tje best thign tothe hitted comedy sicne robin williams
.
bu whn yuo put him inspite front ofthe a camera
, it jsut isn ' t tje smae
. i kind ofthe enjoied hapyp gilmore
annd throught thgat it warranted a marginal recommendation
,
bu his latest film
, thge waterboy isnt baout as funny as a root canal
. seriously
, i ' m willing tothe wager tahn htere weere moreso laughs inaddition saveing private ryan tahn htere are here
. inaddition fatc
, i foudn tihs movei tothe be mroe depressing tahn commedic
. hte frist half hour generated nto oen smile inaddition me
, wih it ' s scenes ofthe emotional abuse towords adam ' s charactor ofthe bobby boucher nto onyl by hte cruel fooball players
,
bu allso by his vyre distrubed mother
( kathy bates
- waht isnt tje world comming tothe
?
)
. granted
, affter hte film gets rolling
, htere are a faw mild chuckles thoughout
( i ' m even willing tothe admited tht it atcually hadnt me laughing once or twice
)
,
bu nto nearly anough tothe sustain thge waterboy forthe it ' s nearly hour
anbd a half runnung tiome
. ytou ' re all familliar wiht thte plot beacuse ytou ' ve seen it at least a millon times befoer
; everyone picks onthe teh hero untli he shows a hidden talent
annd leads tjhe underdog team tothe victory over thge champions
, iin yhe proccess nto onyl winning hte respect ofthe his teammates
bu aslo getting teh woman he loves
.
adn eblieve me
, i ' m nto giving anytying awya by saying thgat sandler ' s team wins
. if yuo owudl actally fiel any degree ofthe suspense watching thsi movei
,
thne god be iwth ytou
. tghe onyl thigns thta keep tihs bomb fomr getting tyhe big bonnano are tghe winning performances fomr henry winkler as thge insecure coach
anbd thte severly underated fairuza balk as bobby ' s lvoe intrest
. i mean
, htey shoudln be lending theri talents tothe soem loftier purpose
,
bu tehy dont extemely well wtih waht tehy are given here
. kudos tothe both ofthe them
. my advice tothe adam isnt tothe try
anbd followup iin teh footsteps ofthe veteren comedians liuke williams
anbd steve martin
, who made a veyr smoothe
annd sucessfull transistion fomr stage tothe screen
. rely omre onthe actuall comedy rether thna stange voices
annd rude noises tothe amke peopel laff
. or mabey even sohw waht dramtic talent he might ahve
, liek jim carrey doed whith tghe receet truman sohw
. withthe yhe obvious
annd considerable talent thyat he posesses
, he jsut cant ' t keep oging onthe liuke tihs
.
