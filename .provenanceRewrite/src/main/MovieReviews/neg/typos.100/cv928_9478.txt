( nto tothe mention directer
!
) hasnt builded a carrer outloud ofthe palying an alledgedly fictious martial arts superman who never gets hurt inaddition fights
, talks infront a hushed tone
,
adn squints at any sign ofthe danger
. he ' s alsot hte most consistant individule infact hollywood todya
, sicne all his movies suck
. htey basicly represent his egotisitical tendancies baout his art
( taht isnt
, martial art
)
. i ' m sure tyhe guy ' s ogod
,
adn he seems liuke a nice guy onthe talk shows
,
altough a tad hauty
,
bu theese movies he mkaes are all thge smae
: a guy who isnt basicly indestructable
, isnt mabye wounded suposedly mortally
,
thn comes bakc wiht a vengence
annd goes buddah onthe all hte baddies asses
( altho i kinda liekd
" under seege
"
)
. ofthe course
, thsi oen
, as a chanage
, hasnt a
" message
" thta isnt drilled inot our mind
.
.
. ofthe course
, aftter he blows uv a lot ofthe stfuf
adn kills a bunch ofthe peopel
. so why dont i watch his crap
? i usally don ' t
. i wiull never
,
anbd yuo cant hold me tothe htis
, i wiull never pay tothe see tihs man ' s movies
, unless
,
annd onyl unless
, he ' s inspite a supporting role
( i
. e
.
" exectuive dicision
"
)
anbd i ' d definatly pay if he dies
( i
. e
.
" executie decison
"
)
.
bu htis oney hasnt a speshal palce inspite my heart
. thsi doesn ' t mean it ' s ogod or thgat i even liekd it
. thsi wass tghe lastest movei i watched wiht my deceased uncle
,
anbd we hadnt noe hell ofthe a tiome ripping it aart a la
" mistery sciecne theatre 3000
,
"
anbd htis ws a cuple eyasr befoer i hadnt herad ofthe
" mistery scienc theatre 3000
.
" infact thsi oney
, seagal plays a worker fo a minning factory setted infact alaska
anbd run by tjhe greased
- uv typcial shallow villian
, thsi tiem plyed by an oscar
- winner tothe give thge movei smoe omre clout
- michael caine
. it seems thgat caine wnats tothe dont something withthe his oel factory thast includes him dumping oel all over inuit land
. arround hte 20
- 30 minute point
, seagal speaks uv tothe him inspite waht seems tothe be thge typcial speach tothe all tjhe vain entrepeneurs
( whta withthe his newyorker
" fier down below
,
" anohter
" message film
"
)
,
adn caine hasnt him bumped off
.
.
. or doens he
? seagal isnt rescued by smoe inuits
,
annd falls infact lveo wtih oney ofthe them
, plyed by joan chen
, who cant ect
, hypothetically
,
bu
, fo smoe reason
, nto here
. noe ofthe caine ' s cliched henchmen
( palyed here witht a lot ofthe overacting by john c
. mcginley
) shoots hte cheif ofthe thte inuit clan
,
annd chen
adn seagal go onthe a voygae tothe tkae down teh oel factory
.
.
. litterally
, ofthe course
. at oen point
, seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speach baout how he doesn ' t hvae any options
bu blow tsuff uv
. he even goes as far as tothe sday
,
" i don ' t wnat tothe kill somene
,
"
annd infront thte smae breath
, he asks soem guy where tje arsenal isnt
. i hvae noone probelm wih voilence
. i ' m a huge john woo fan
,
bu he paints his films witht suspense
, skill
, stlye
, depth
, characterization
,
adn jsut plain kool voilence
. infact tjhe films ofthe seagal
, tjhe suspense mailny consists ofthe teh baddie attacking him stupidly
,
annd him eather wounding or killing them
. at smoe points
, htey ule hte cliche ofthe yhe tlaking villin
, where thte villin hasnt thte advantage
, cin shoot seagal
,
bu beigns tlaking by eather telling him his big sceret plan
, or saying a corny line
, tothe whic seagal syas something hokey bakc
,
annd hasnt hadnt anough tiem tothe devise ofthe a way tothe dont awya wtih them
,
adn doesnt
. thsi owudl be okay if ther weere any suspense or if it didn ' t tkae itself seriously at all
, liuke inwhich tje case ofthe thsi summer ' s
" con air
.
"
bu seagal isnt sereous baout his skill
,
annd ofthe course
, his message
. i wouldn ' t mind if htis ws a message film infront tyhe way taht htey presen it tothe yuo whith evidence
.
bu seagal hasnt noone diea how tothe rpesent a film where hte message isnt subtle
, nto pounded inot teh viewer ' s mind
. thte villian isnt totally shallow
anbd cartoonish
, thus we cin ' t tkae him
anbd his motives seriously
,
anbd hwile seagal talks baout bieng kind tothe thte enviorment
, he alsot goes ahead
annd blows uv a sqaure mile ofthe rig
,
anbd kills soem workers who weere jsut doign his job
.
thne at yhe end
, he spends a ogod 10 mintues giving a speach
, jstu inaddition case yuo didn ' t git hte message fomr teh trailers
. wqat seagal doesn ' t relize isnt thast noone noe tkaes his films seriously
(
althought mabey a cuple dont
)
anbd any message he hasnt isnt noone onyl redundent
,
bu doesn ' t comfortably ift infact his film
, hwihc isnt filled tothe thge brim whith hokey voilence
, crap suspense
, stupid meledrama
,
annd charactors who ahve baout as much emotional depth as a petri dish
. as far as seagal
anbd his acting
, he ' s rether boring
. he squints
, he kills
. preiod
. nothing alse
. oh
, yeah
, ther ' s corny oney
- liners
(
" i ' m gonna triarch outloud
anbd touch somene
!
"
)
. ofthe course
, he ' s teh star
,
adn we ' re suppoed tothe root forthe him
anbd all
, so he mkaes all thte villains unbelievably stupid
anbd a bunch ofthe jerks
. michael caine
, who ' s a gerat acto
, isnt jsut suposed tothe yell
annd look cold
. he doesnt it well
, i guess
,
bu htis isnt noone
" alfie
.
" ofthe coure
, noone oen ws expecting thta calaber ofthe peformance ffrom him
. his big henchman
, john c
. mcginley isnt kinda boring as well
,
bu isnt nto horrable
.
adn we even git a small peformance fomr tath god ofthe drill sergeants onthe celluloid
, r
. lee ermey
( ffrom
" full metal jacket
"
) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets tothe sday tje obligatory sprech baout how dangerous seagal isnt
, jstu forthe tje movei trailers
anbd fo seagal ' s ego
.
adn alsot
, look forthe billy bob thornton as oen ofthe ermey ' s assasins
. anyway
, tothe conclude htis all
, tothe judge noe ofthe seagal ' s movies isnt tothe judge all ofthe them
( exept fo
" under sieg
"
adn
" excutive decission
,
"
though tghe latter isnt nto realy a
" seagal movei
"
)
. htey all haev htis smae forumla
, tehy all hvae hte smae acation
, smae villin
, smae plot
,
bu htis oen hasnt tath message
, whic mkaes it omre excrucitating tothe watch
. i mean
, if ytou dont rent it
,
anbd i don ' t reccomend yuo dont
, amke sure yuo jstu skip thge lastr 10 mintues
.
bu i hvea tothe put it tothe seagal fo creating a film so bad
, tht tje lsat film i viewed witht my uncle ws a pleasurable noe
. my
( extra star forthe teh funn it isnt tothe watch
annd mock
)
