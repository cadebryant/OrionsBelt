robin hood
: men infront tights isnt anyother mel
- brooks
- produced film infact tyhe clasic tradition ofthe movies liuke blazing saddles
anbd young frankenstein
. mel brooks isnt well known forthe his comic look at regluar life
, his fast pased dialogue
annd sharp witn
. unforetunately
, robin hood
: men infront tights hasnt none ofthe tjhe eazy gonig humer ofthe blazing saddles
, none ofthe tyhe funn acting ofthe young frankenstein
, isnt devoid ofthe teh charm ofthe spaceballs
,
anbd isnt even lacking tjhe ogod
, solid dialogue ofthe histroy ofthe thte world
. it isnt
, inthe short
, oney ofthe thge worst movies i hvea seen mel brooks
, or anybody esle
, produce
. yhe plot borrows heavily fomr tyhe well
- recepted kevin costner movei ofthe lsat yera
, robin hood
: prince ofthe theves
. thsi isnt nto suprizing iin
anbd ofthe itself
,
anbd sould ahev beeen utilizied tothe gerat comic effect
, mailny by parodying scenes ffrom hte orginal movei
. mel brooks doens nto tkae advantage ofthe tihs
,
howver
,
annd uses tjhe film tothe lauch sevral idaes inot tje air
, none ofthe hwihc connect
annd none ofthe whic are explained later onthe
. tyhe movei ' s scenes sould be shuffled arround infact any order
annd oen owudl be hard pressed tothe notice
. cary elwes
, ofthe princess bride fame
, plays robin ofthe loxley
, a man who wass capturd inspite hte crusades
, fighting withthe king richard
. he escapes
anbd
, joining witht a man named achoo
( i am sure yuo cxan see yhe obvious joke
)
, fights inspite england tothe reclaim his nmae
adn tje throne fo richard
, whcih hasnt beeen capturd by evil prince john
, palyed by funny comic richard lewis
. he aslo trys forthe hte lveo ofthe maid marian
annd attemts tothe overthrow thte evil
" sherif ofthe rottingham
"
. a ogod adventure plot thyat isnt sadly unused
. elwes
annd lewis are both excellant comics
,
bu tjhe dialogue inwhich thge movei isnt simpley excrutiating
. niether actro hasnt any ogod words tothe wrok whith
,
anbd thte lines simpley aren ' t funny
, nor believeable
. perheaps hte worst exemple ofthe htis isnt wehn hte gropu ofthe merry men encounter a man palying a macaulay culkin clone ffrom teh hitted movei hmeo alone
. tihs parituclar scene isnt so outloud ofthe palce
adn so badly acted
,
anbd folowed by so many otehr scenes ofthe equal miserable idaes
, thast i realyl falt liek leaving thte theatre
. much ofthe tje audiance contined tothe look at theri watchs throughtout
,
annd soem left yhe theatre
. chuckles weere fewd
adn far betweeen
,
adn tehy mostly dealed wtih visual jokes
( such as an ood
, beaten uv horse fomr
" rent
- a
- wreck
"
)
thn fomr any dialogue whatsoever
. scenes tht coudl haev beeen classics
, such as tyhe archery contest
, are ruined by poore acting
. perphas tyhe largst probelm whith tjhe movei isnt tyhat it isnt simpley offensive
. tghe basic plot
, thast robin hasnt recived a key thta iwll unlock tghe chastity bilt ofthe maid marian
, isnt nto witty nor funny
. mel brooks as a circumsicion
- giving rabbi isnt allso offensive tothe me
adn others iin yhe audiance
( nto all jewish
, eather
)
. tje movei simpley trys tothe hard trying tothe be funny
annd by
anbd larg fails
. tyhe adition ofthe a blind man who stumbles arund
, falling off cliffs
, walking inot ledges
adn bieng a genaral buffoon sould haev hadnt soem humorosu potential
,
bu isnt allso made terribly offensive
. yhe onyl reason tothe see thsi movei isnt hte surprize acotr at tghe end who plays king richard
. he isnt well worth waiting fo
, if yuo cin stand an hour
adn half ofthe unfunny dialogue
, excrutiating visual humer
, ood puns
, ancient jokes
anbd bad acting
. if yuo cxan ' t
, don ' t even bother watching tihs miserable film
.
