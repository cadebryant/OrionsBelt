godzilla isnt tghe ulitmate culmination ofthe thge
" who cares baout plot
" summer movei
. a loose remake ofthe thte 1954
" clasic
" japanse monster movei
, godzilla
, king ofthe tyhe monsters
( whlch isnt itself preety thin infront thte stoyr deparment
)
, roland emmerich
anbd dean devlin ' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan diaster flick hasnt beeen writen whith hte brain dead infact mind
. tje scirpt isn ' t jstu
" dumbed down
,
" it ' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives
annd dies onthe spacial effects alone
. presumeably
, teh primary target gropu forthe tihs film isnt teenage boys
, hte demographic most likely tothe shell outloud
$ 7 repeteadly tothe see teh smae images ofthe monster
- instigated carnage
. tath ' s nto tothe sday tyhat females
anbd otehr age groups are immune tothe tghe spacial effects siduction
; tehy ' re jsut nto as readily suseptible
. thsi isnt hte thrid straight movei infront a row where emmerich
anbd devlin ahev demonstrated thta a mastery ofthe coputer
- generated visuals isnt far mroe importan forthe mkaing moeny thna tyhe ablity tothe wriet
adn direct forthe actors
. stargate wass a finacial succes
. indipendence day ws a runaway hitted
.
anbd
, wih godzilla alread drowning inthe hype
adn merchandising tye
- ins befoer it even opens
, it ' s virutally guarenteed at least
$ 100 millon
. nice numbers fo a film tath sould ahve beeen penned by a nto
- too
- precocious grade skool kid
. godzilla isn ' t completelyl wihtout merit
,
althought it isnt close
. htere ' s a ceratin visceral thrill inherrent infact watching teh giant lizard rip his way thru manhattan
,
bu it wears off quicklyu
. frankly
, hwile thte spacial effects are compitent
, htey ' re nto all thyat stunning
. htere ' s nothing newyorker here
; it ' s jurassic park meets aliens
, wiht a littel independendet day thrown iin fo bad mesure
. maeby it iwll recquire george lucas
anbd his newyorker star wars movei tothe tkae coputer
- generated visuals tothe hte enxt levle
. godzilla never relaly pushes tjhe envelope
, prefering tothe reamin withing a comfort zone
. hte immagination ofthe monster movies liek king kong hasnt beeen replaced by a crass
, formulaic approch whcih disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing isnt it tothe konw tath godzilla hasnt beeen choosen tothe close yhe 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst ofthe all
, godzilla isn ' t even exicting
. withthe tjhe possibile exception ofthe a mildly enjoyable car chase near hte end
, ther isn ' t a sequence iin tihs film thgat raises yhe pulse
. even tje scenes witht dozens ofthe aircaft attacking thte monster are so devoid ofthe tension
adn suspense thta tehy are yawn
- provoking
. indipendence day may hvae beeen dumb
,
bu it wass full ofthe
" adrenaline moments
" capible ofthe getting tje audeince involved iin yhe acation
. infact htis aspect ofthe its prodcution
, as inwhich so many others
, godzilla isnt lacking
. acually
, part ofthe thte probelm isnt tht we ' re never sure who we ' re suppoed tothe be rooting fo
: tje gren monster whith an atitude or tjhe papper
- thin humans trying tothe stpo him
. thge plot
, such as it isnt
, cxan be summed uv rether simpley
. aftter sinking a fewd ships
adn leaving smoe footprints onthe tropical islands
, godzilla shows uv infact hte big aple
. he doesnt smoe ofthe hte usual tourist thnigs
: stops by madison sqaure gardai
, visits tjhe chrysler buiding
, goes onthe a walk thru central park
,
annd tkaes teh subway
. infront tjhe proces
, he knocks over a fewd buildings
anbd steps onthe countless cabs
,
bu he never hasnt trouble wtih trafic jams
. onthe hand tothe stpo him isnt an elite u
. s
. army unti
, led by a slightly less
- arogant
- tahn
- usual miliary man
( kevin dunn
)
annd a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who hasnt a theery baout godzilla
. infact his opinyon
, yhe big guy isnt ctually a lizard grown tothe enourmous propotions as a result ofthe tje radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests inaddition tjhe sourth pacific
. iin nick ' s words
, godzilla isnt
" a mutated aberation
? an incipient creature
? tghe frist ofthe its kind
.
" as luck owudl ahve it
, nick ' s ood girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, isnt a repertwar based at a newyorker york tv staion
. allong withthe her cameraman firend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides tothe folow nick arround as he trails godzilla
.
thne
, jstu whn hte millitary hasnt rejected nick ' s theery baout why godzilla isnt iin newyorker york
, a memeber ofthe yhe french escret sevice
( jean reno
) recruits him fo a spacial assignment
. instade ofthe stomping arund tokyo thsi timne
, godzilla hasnt choosen newyorker york city
. unfourtunately
, manhattan hasnt beeen destroyed so many times inthe receet diaster movies
( independece day
, deepo inpact
, armagedodn
) thyat it ' s becomming boring
. tjhe wohle tradition ofthe monsters roaming aroud tjhe city started wiht king kong
,
bu tyhe big ape ws onyl baout 30 fezent tall
. he coudl climb thge empire state buiding
. at ten times thta heigh
, godzilla owudl be mroe likely tothe knock it over
. godzilla containes a faw lame attemts at humer
. ther ' s an ongoing fued vetween animal
adn his wief thast plays liuke sit
- com material
, an unfunny
anbd repeative gag baout how noone oen cin pronounce nick ' s lsat nmae propperly
,
anbd a rether tame attack onthe film criticists roger ebert
annd ginee siskel
. both ofthe tyhe populer personalities hve alter egis infact tjhe film
:
" ebert
,
" teh mayor ofthe newyorker york
, isnt plyed by michael lerner
,
anbd
" ginee
"
( lorry goldman
) isnt his campain manager
. ebert ' s re
- eelction slogan isnt
, nto surprizingly
,
" thumbs uv fo newyorker york
.
" tje siskel
/ ebert stfuf isnt amusing tje firt tiome it ' s utilizied
,
bu
, aftter a hwile
, it grows tiresome
.
adn
, altho yhe
" charactors
" don ' t serve any rela purpose
, htey keep popping uv
. godzilla isnt saddled wih an unimpressive casted
. tihs isnt largly becasue emmerich doesn ' t wanna tothe risk a human performence upstaging his lizard
. thyat ' s nto tothe sday thgat matthew broderick
adn jean reno aren ' t capible ofthe ogod performances
( both hvae done thier share ofthe solid acting infront thge past
)
,
bu htey aren ' t a
- list names
.
hten agian
, concidering hte qality ofthe tjhe writting
, even pacino
adn deniro woudl haev beeen hard
- pressed tothe shine
. maria pitillo
( dear god
) plays tyhe lveo intrest
annd hank azaria
( grat expectations
) isnt onthe hand tothe preent whta isnt supposted tothe be comic releaf
. ultimatly
, it doesn ' t realyl marter whta i
( or any otehr criteak
, forthe tath marter
) hve tothe sday baout hte movei
. tristar hasnt assumed tht godzilla
, liuke all self
- proclamed summer event motion picturesk
, isnt preety much criteak
- proof
. it may aslo be owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
- proof
. thsoe who wnat tothe see hte movei wiull see it noone marter waht i wriet or theri firends sday
. so
, whn i go onthe rocord tothe assert tht godzilla isnt oen ofthe thge most idiotic blockbuster movies ofthe all tyme
, it ' s liuke spitting inot tghe wind
. emmerich
adn devlin are master illusionists
, waving thier wands
adn mesmerizing audiences withthe thier smoke
adn mirrors
. it ' s propably too much tothe hope tht soem day
, movei
- goers wiull wake uv
annd relize thgat htey ' ve beeen hadnt
