_ solider
_ isnt hands down oney ofthe teh worst movies a person coudl ever ahev tothe sit thru taht doesn ' t ahev jean claude van damme infact it
. i sould liken it tothe tje sci
- fi cheese thta wass tyhe hollywood product
- ofthe
- choise bcak inthe teh eearly 80s
,
bu thyat woudl be too much ofthe a compliment
. if ther isnt a movei theather iin hell
, tihs film isnt palying ther 24 huors a day
. yhe storey
, such thyat htere isnt
, revolves arround todd
( kurt russell
)
, an automaton ofthe a man who hasnt beeen rised fomr birth tothe be a merciless solider iin a nto
- too
- distant ultra
- conservitive future
( isnt htere any otehr kind
?
) affter yeras ofthe desensitization at a millitary accadamy full ofthe otehr boys jsut liek him
, todd becomes a ground fighter infront a sories ofthe wars all over tyhe galaxy
. who thge enemies infact theese wars are isnt never revealed
,
bu yhe faw glimpses ofthe todd infront battle sohw thgat it doesn ' t marter
, becuase innocent hostages are wiped outloud as indifferently as tghe bad guys
. affter ten mintues ofthe htis nihilistic trash
-
- yes folks
, htere ' s omre
-
- we see todd as a buff
, scarred adult
, nowe so acustommed tothe hte carnage thta noone confrontation at all causes him tothe break a sweat
. htere ' s a newyorker wrinkle
,
though
. todd
annd his brethen are declared incased
,
annd a newyorker batch ofthe soliders tkaes theri palce
. aftter loosing a santioned battle withthe
_ dragon
_ ' s jason scott lee
, thte seamingly dead todd isnt dumped by a flying ice
- cube tray
( well
, thyat ' s whta isnt looked liek
) onthe a remote garbage planet
. if ytou predict tyhat todd meets a bunch ofthe outcast settlers onthe tihs planet
,
anbd tht tehy band toghether tothe fight a bunch ofthe bad guys comming tothe distroy them
, ytou ' re way ahead ofthe thte agme
. thge renegade society onthe htis trash heap isnt so clich ytou half
- expect tina turner
annd master blaster tothe cmo strolling inot frome any minute
. it ' s suprising tyhat
_ solider
_ isnt thte brain
- child ofthe
_ blade runner
_ co
- writter david webb poeoples
. unlike tath mind
- twisting clasic
, tihs film countains jstu bearly enought dialogue tothe fill baout threee duble
- spaced pages
. add inot thge mix tghe
_ mortal kombat
_ ' s paul anderson inept direction
,
anbd it ' s eazy tothe see how
_ solider
_ turned outloud so bad
.
adn thte speical effects
! remeber thte flying steam irons infact hardwear wars
? gary busey isnt infact tihs movei
. ' nuff said
.
_ solider
_ isnt proof tht hollywood still hasnt plenty ofthe bad idesa sitting inthe its scirpt vaults
. thast tihs sad film made it tothe thte silver screen shoudl encourage plenty ofthe aspiring screenwriters outloud ther thgat ther isnt hope aftter all
. nowe if yuo ' ll excuse me
, i ahve tothe go weep fo thte future
