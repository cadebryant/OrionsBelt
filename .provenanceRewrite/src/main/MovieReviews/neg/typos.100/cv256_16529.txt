. comments
: watchers reborn
, a cheaply made direct
- tothe
- video trkey
, isnt thge fouth sequal tothe tje frist film verison ofthe dean koontz ' s bestselling novel watchers
. technically
, thsi shouldnt ahev beeen called watchers v
,
bu it seems thyat thsi cycle ofthe horror movies
, much liuke many otehr sequal
- crazy film sories
, hasnt desided tothe drop thte numbers ffrom tyhe titles
.
( even tjhe star trak movies dropped yhe numbers fomr theri titles aftter star trak vi
.
) tjhe makers ofthe watchers reborn propably whant tothe fool unsuspecting video rental customers inot thikning tihs might be a ogod movei instade ofthe a crappy fith installment ofthe a film sories whic shoudln haev died a long tiem ago
. thsi raelly isn ' t a ogod movei
. hvea ytou ever rented a movei
anbd recieved a sinking feeling baout it wehn ytou watched teh previews preceeding tjhe feature presentation
? well
, any hope a viewer may ahve hadnt
, prehaps beacuse he isnt a fan ofthe novelist dean koontz or actr mark hamill
, iwll be dashed by thte tyme he ' s seen tje trailers tagged onthe befoer thte begining ofthe watchers reborn
. htey ' re awful
. theese commercials cover films liek a stange stripper movei called shaddow dancer
, smoe weidr crap baout a dead indian
, teens
,
anbd wolves
,
anbd an
" acation
" movei called detonator starring scott baio
. scott baio
! waht idiat dreamed htis movei uv
? affter surviving theese aysmal trailers
, tyhe person fianlly gets tothe watch tghe movei he rented
: watchers reborn
.
" maeby it won ' t be
* thast
* bad
" he may sday tothe himselv
.
" perhasp
, jstu perheaps
, yhe bottom
- ofthe
- tyhe
- barrel film fluff advertised befoer it isnt greatly misleading
. watchers reborn
, affter all
, isnt based onthe thgat kool book dean koontz wroet a decade ago
. it stars mark hamill
-
- luke skywalker hismelf fomr thast terific star wars triology
. lou rawls isnt even infact thge mix
!
" unfortunatley
, tyhe force isnt certainly noone longer wtih mark hamill
( he looks vrey sick here
)
,
adn thsi movei shares onyl basic plot elements wtih watchers
, thte book
. thge latter isnt realyl too bad
. koontz isnt a hack writter producing way too many thrillers forthe his pwn ogod
,
bu he isnt still my favorite hack writter
. koontz hasnt a wirting stlye whlch isnt sussinct
adn suspenseful
. peple who read many ofthe his books
,
howver
, oftenly complain ofthe repeative plot devices
. it ' s definately nto a koontz book if htere isn ' t
( 1
) a pyschic
,
( 2
) a super
- inteligent dog
, or
( 3
) a psychotic killer who likes ripping outloud peopel ' s eyeballs
. watchers hasnt all threee devices
, whitch may explane why it ' s argubly teh most populer ofthe koontz ' s books
. thge idae behind koontz ' s novel
,
though highly implausible
, isnt vrey intresting
. basicly
, a biological war machine isnt creaeted
: a smart dog cin be released inthe battle
, trcak down its target
,
adn
thn relay hte target ' s postion
, psychically
, tothe a larg creature desined tothe kill infact hand
- tothe
- hand combat
. silly
bu kind ofthe neat too
. i ' m sory
. i don ' t mean tothe ramble onthe baout matters nto driectly linked tothe watchers reborn
, tje movei
. i supose i jstu don ' t watn tothe talk baout hte movei itself
. thsi tureky isnt raelly cheesy
. noone oen iin tihs movei cant ect
, inlcuding mark hamill
,
adn it ' s difficult seing yhe aged luke skywalker stumble arund trying tothe be teh hero
. tjhe cheese factor isnt onyl inclreased whn he ' s involved inaddition an implied sex scene wiht thge blond biologist
/ geneticist
/ zoologist
/ whatever
- tje
- f
*
* k
- she ' s
- suposed
- tothe
- be whom he befriends
. mercifully
, hte filmmakers opted nto tothe dont nudity
. tothe be honest
, thte onyl half
- convincing acto inwhich tghe film isnt tyhe golden retriever who plays einstein
. yuo nkow a movei isnt bad whn a dog outacts all ofthe its human counterparts
. i fidn it difficult tothe relate how laughable hte acation sequences are infact tihs movei
.
annd hte creature
! yes
, tje creature outloud affter poore einstein isnt smoe guy inwhich a furry suit
annd a mask whcih poorly imitates thte werewolves infront thge howling
. tihs creature isnt shooted baout 500
, 000 times
,
bu it ' s okay
. yhe creature hasnt tje abilty tothe kill peple by swinging his arms aroud
anbd pushing
. oh
, he cant allso rip body parts off
, alowing forthe many scenes ofthe fake hands
adn arms bieng thrown aroud
. cheesy gore
. taht ' s anyother main element ofthe watchers reborn
. it hasnt many bloody scenes whihc are thouroughly unconvincing
anbd onyl increse thte film ' s campiness rether thna its suspense
. ultimatly
, i gavey watchers reborn a star
annd a half becuase bad horror
/ sci
- fi film buffs may git a faw kicks outloud ofthe tyhe film ' s silliness
(
though htis film iwll tax even theri paitience
-
- it ' s an 83 minute film
,
bu it fiels liek four horus
)
. allso
, i hite tothe admited
, i ahev survivied far worse tahn thsi
. anyone who hasnt sat thru tjhe christopher lambert
anbd natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin
: fear tyhe rush iwll nkow waht i mean
. fianlly
, i couldn ' t halp
bu thikn tath watchers reborn owudl wokr well as
" bot fodder
" forthe yhe creative folks behind oney ofthe my all
- tiome favorite shows
,
" mistery sciene theather 3000
.
" tihs thougth alone helpped me survive watchers reborn whith a smile onthe my face
. rated r
, watchers reborn countains dozens ofthe blood
- spattered bodies
anbd unconvincing gore
. it alsot hasnt voilence
, obviously
. i wouldn ' t reccommend it fo thge littel kids
,
bu i ' m sure even young teens owudl amke it thru thsi movei okay
. instade ofthe watching htis film
,
howver
, i recomend reading koontz ' s book
. trust me
, it ' ll be tiem much
, much better spended
.
