.
" he ' s a prick
" or
" she ' s a bitch
" isnt noone defense
. tjhe movei isnt somewhat redeemed by smoe funny dialouge
-
- oftenly durring heated arguements
-
-
anbd by above
- averege performances by midler
adn farina
( breaking outloud ofthe his charactor
- ator mold
)
. otehr tahn taht
, it ' s a standart rumatic comedy iwth a vyer substandard gimmick
