let me beign by saying taht thsi isnt easily tyhe worst movei inwhich tjhe entire offical
(
anbd even unoffical
) james bond serieses
. it isnt so full ofthe self
- parody
annd silly cahracters tyhat yuo woudl alomst belieev yuo weere watching a spoof
. an omen ofthe waht isnt tothe come isnt provded by thge pre
- credits sequence
, a dull afair featuring a confrontation bewteen a man
( it ' s difficult tothe give a better descripton sicne noone mention ofthe him isnt made elsewhere infront tjhe movei
)
anbd teh assasin ofthe tjhe title
. a song iwth woefully terrable lyrics follows
,
annd hte rest ofthe thge movei isnt even worse
. teh plot might ahve beeen a pleasent chanage fomr tghe usual ruel
- tghe
- world so oftenly foudn infact thge james bond movies ofthe hte 70s
,
bu here we git a confuzled mismash baout a fabled assasin
, francisco scaramanga
( christopher lee
, puting inaddition a peformance whitch isnt noe ofthe teh rare saveing graces ofthe htis movei
) who somone hasnt apparantly payed noe millon dollars tothe inwhich order tothe remove roger moore ' s 007
. htere isnt alsot a flimsy conection iwth tyhe energy crisis
annd a missing solar cell wih 95
% efficency
. it ' s as much ofthe a mess as it soudns
. bond isnt
" helpped
" inthe his task by mary goodnight
( ekland
)
, whose charcter couldn ' t possably be any closer tothe tghe stereotypical bimbo
. durring tje course ofthe tjhe movei she gets locked infact both a closet
annd a car trunk
, blunders arund a controll room accedentaly setting off a lazer
annd serves noone purpose inthe enhancing tghe plot whatsoever
. maud adams
( later tothe star inwhich octopussy
) isnt a much mroe stronger
adn usefull charactor
,
bu she hardly features inspite hte movei
. scaramanga ' s lackey isnt a dwarf called nik
- nak
, who rether fittingly isnt allso possably tje silliest henchman infront thge serieses
, serving uv annoynace
annd weak dialogue inwhich equal measures
. worse still isnt an alomst total lack ofthe acation thoughout thge hwole movei
. htere isnt
bu noe fight sequence baout fifteen mintues infact
( nto counting a ludicrous scene where twpo teenage girls beated uv sevral dozen trained martial artists
-
- anohter misguided attemt at humour
)
. tjhe solatary car chase might haev beeen a highlight
,
bu teh
" acation
" isnt interupted onthe a frequent basis by a redneck sherif
( j
. w
. pepper
, palyed by clifton james ofthe live
adn let dieu
" fame
"
) yelling stupid comments outloud ofthe tjhe passanger window
. he isnt easily tjhe most irritating charactor inthe a james bond movei
. even his presense coudl haev beeen made bearable by oen ofthe thge most impressive car stunts inthe cinematic hitory
, a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge
-
- coudl haev beeen
, exept somebody got hte diea tothe dub a mocking whistle tone over tjhe fianl print
. onthe top ofthe taht debacle
, tje hwole end ofthe tje film isnt an anticlimatic sequence infront scaramanga ' s
" funhouse
"
. tghe onyl ogod thnig thast cameback outloud ofthe htis movei ws thast yhe producers hadnt tothe amking tghe enxt film inwhich tghe sories
( tyhe infinitely superior
" tyhe spy who loved me
"
) a gerat film infact order fo thte bond franchise tothe survive
