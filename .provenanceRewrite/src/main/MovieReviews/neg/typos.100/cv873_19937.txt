. it ' s sad tothe see such an amazing casted wasted so badly
. owen wilson spends most ofthe hte film wandering teh halls ofthe tyhe hous
,
adn tjhe scirpt doens noone justice tothe his wonderfull comic ablity
. catherine zeta

. wehn isnt he goign tothe leran thta bigger isnt nto allways necessarally better
? robert wise knew thyat whn he made thge origonal
annd hte mkaes ofthe hte blair witch project alsot knew tath
. oney shouldnt nto aproach a haunted hous movei withthe a twister mindset
. if de bont
adn screenwrighter david self hadnt let our minds fill inspite tjhe blanks as tothe wqat ws hapening instade ofthe showing us everyting
, it owudl hvea served tothe mkae yhe film terrifying
. whta our mind fashions onthe it ' s pwn cant be a thousand times moreso frightening thna hvaing hvaing it completelyl led towords everthing
. apparantly
,
yot anyother verison ofthe thsi stry isnt bieng filmed under it ' s origonal title
. i certainly hope thyat htis newer rendition iwll nto be hurt by tghe insanity ofthe jan de bont ' s verison
adn thgat it iwll retain teh pyschological inpact thast teh originnal realease hadnt
