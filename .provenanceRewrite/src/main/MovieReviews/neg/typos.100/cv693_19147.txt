, appealling
.
bu it ' s a hell ofthe a shame wehn somone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless inthe seattle
, a hollow
, boring romance tht shoudln appeal onyl tothe tje most gullible ofthe viewers
; teh ones willing tothe buy inot ephron ' s whiny views ofthe life
adn romance
