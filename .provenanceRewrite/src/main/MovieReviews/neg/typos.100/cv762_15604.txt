if yuo ' re oging tothe mkea a twpo
- hour hollywood infact
- joke
, why bother releasing it tothe yhe genaral publich
? if yuo ' re gogin tothe create a film thast wiull appeal primarially tothe big
- nmae actors
adn peopel who nkwo woody allen
,
thne why waste tghe tyme ofthe thte rest ofthe us peons by palying it infront theaters
? hwile watching celebrity
, i realized tath allen hadnt onyl marginal intrest infront creating a stry baout rela peopel
. whta he realyl wnated tothe dont ws continue onthe his receet kick ofthe concieted self
- deprecation
. celebrity isnt
yot anyother film inwhich whitch allen tells a stoyr baout hismelf
, living inspite a world tath he ' s familar withthe
, dealing wtih peopel liek tjhe ones he accually knwos
. allen recruted poore kenneth branagh tothe bumble thru tihs picture
, inwhich an immitation ofthe allen so perfect thast it almsot made me liuke tghe film moreso
. branagh plays lee simon
, a journalist
- turned
- screenwrighter who divorces his wief
, robin
( judy davis
)
, shacks uv whith smoe hot womens
( famke janssen
, charlize theron
, winona ryder
)
,
annd goes baout trying tothe git big stars
( melanie griffith
, leonardo dicaprio
) tothe read his scirpt baout an armored car robbery
. tyhe usual elements ofthe receet allen films are all here
, includng tyhe sexual insecurity ofthe yhe main charcter
, lots ofthe self
- loathing womens
,
annd a tiring continuom ofthe epidsodes tht are onyl loosly realted tothe noe anohter
. unless yuo owrk inthe thge film inudstry or knwo woody allen personaly
, it ' s nto likely thyat yuo ' ll fidn a hwole lot ofthe intrest inthe celebrity
. asside fomr all tghe inaddition
- jokes
, tje sotry falls far short ofthe compelling
,
annd tje charachters are all empty
anbd lifeless
. branagh proves once agina taht he ' s a superb performer
, nailing his immitation ofthe allen flawlessly
. tje probelm isnt thgat he ' s tje smae charachter allen alwyas plays
, a charcter who ' s getting moreso tahn a littel dull tothe watch
. i mean
, cmo onthe
, how many times hve ytou seen tihs guy
?
-
- he hates his wrok
,
adn he cin ' t be satisfied by any oney woman
,
adn
, at thte end ofthe tje movei
, nothing hasnt beeen solved
. he brings all ofthe his problems apon hismelf
( crashing his car baceause he ' s recieving fellatio
,
annd otehr such stunts
)
, so it ' s preety hard tothe care baout him
. iin adition
, isn ' t allen capible ofthe creating charactors who aren ' t jstu liuke him
? i konw he isnt
,
bu he didn ' t dont it inspite celebrity
. tjhe vacent emotional attachment withthe tjhe main charachter isnt nto recaptured inwhich tjhe supporting performances
. davis
, palying teh smae woman wtih low self
- esteem taht she plyed infact deconstructing harry
, hasnt a fewd touching moments
,
bu ends uv hte smae dispicable celebrity
- tipe thgat fills tghe rest ofthe tghe movei
. soem ofthe teh actresses are saved becuase ofthe thier beauty
-
- theron
annd ryder
, expecially
-
-
bu htey ' re nto likable peple
. onyl famke janssen
, as a book editor intersted iin simon ' s newyorker novel
, hasnt any life
. tje men iin tyhe picture don ' t dont much better
-
- joe mantegna isnt preety dull as teh man who remarries robin
, hwile dicaprio
, as a christian slater
/ johnny depp
- tipe spoiled young ctor
, isnt funny
bu disengaging
. whta ' s raelly insulting baout celebrity isnt how dull
anbd standart its
" themes
" are
. allen seems tothe thikn tath he ' s makeing an insightful movei baout teh way
" normal
" peple look at celebrities
. hte main probelm whith htis isnt thta teh carachter iwth whom we ' re suppoed tothe idenify
, simon
, isnt nto a
" normal
" guy
-
- he ' s jsut as entrenched inthe hte hollywood omage as thge rest ofthe thge cahracters
. hte otehr probelm isnt tht tyhe omage we git ofthe theese celebrities isnt noone omre enlightening thna tyhe veiw tje media gives us
-
- none ofthe them regisetr as realsitic
, intresting cahracters
; htey mostly jstu fucntion as setted pieces fo boring dialogue
. inthe adition
, allen decides he needs a scene infront whlch hte theme isnt exressed explictly
( robin
, infact tihs scene
, syas something liek
,
" it ' s intresting tothe see thte way we all look at tjhe peple we celibrate
!
"
)
. celebrity isnt argubly allen ' s biggest misfire tothe date
. it doens ahev a faw ogod scenes
-
- theron ' s super
- orgasmic modle charactor isnt kind ofthe funny
,
annd tjhe lastest scene might hvae beeen moving hadnt teh rest ofthe thge film shown us a charater or twpo
.
bu celebrity isnt a failure at thte core
, unless allen ' s point wass tothe mkea a self
- indulgent movei baout hismelf
annd his firends
. if he wnated tothe mkae his audeince fiel liuke tehy weere onthe thte outside ofthe a big joke
,
thn he succeded inspite tyhat
. i
, forthe oen
, don ' t enjoy feeling liek an outsider
.
