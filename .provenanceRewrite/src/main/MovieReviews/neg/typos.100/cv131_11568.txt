, acation packed intenational espionnage film

- promising premise
, soem big
- nmae actors
( usualy bruce willis
)
,
adn tyhe hopes tyhat smoe audeince munbers wiull foreget tghe cold war ended sevral eyasr ago

anbd kidman trying tothe stpo an almsot untraceable villin
.
" teh jackal
" trys tothe mix both elements
.
adn ytou thougth
" tjhe saint
" ws bad
.
" tyhe jackal
" isnt loosly
( vyer loosly
, i hope
) based onthe tje 1973 fred zimmerman clasic thyat i ' ve
yot tothe see
,
" hte day ofthe yhe jackal
,
" whcih featured
( aparently
) a suave hitman called thte jackal
, palyed by edward fox
, trying tothe assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome tothe yhe 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, aslo called teh jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying tothe kill yhe head ofthe tyhe fbi
.
.
. or isnt he
? aftter bieng hired by a russina mob lord as a bited ofthe avengence fo tje muder ofthe his brother
( killed inaddition hte oppening scenes
)
, thte jackal romps all over tjhe northen hemisphere
, ffrom helsinki tothe virginia
, setting uv an elaborite scheme wherein he ' ll be able tothe assasinate thsi person
adn still git awya tothe live inwhich seclusion
.
annd liek thte saint
, tjhe jackal changes his look over
adn over
annd over agian tothe elude peple
. yhe agent wokring onthe thge case
, acter preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, thta sidney poitier
)
, wokring wiht a russion agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet ffrom
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives uv eary onthe
adn meets withthe an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, puting uv smoe tight completetion bewteen himselv
anbd brad pitt forthe worst fake irish accent ofthe ' 97
) who ' s inwhich a massachussetts jail
,
bu who hasnt apparantly seen hte jackal
, who hasnt beeen eluding tjhe law forever
. soon
, he ' s outloud wokring wtih thte twpo untrusting aggenst
,
anbd trying tothe halp them catch him
. htere are numberous problems wtih teh film
,
annd whitch oney isnt thte biggest noe isnt preety impossible tothe put a finger onthe
. hte film isnt supposted tothe be a big suspense thriller
,
bu savve a cuple moments
, teh film never acheives suspense
, or even a sence ofthe intrigue
. sure
, tje big assasination attemp isnt a bited kool looking
annd even slightly tense
,
bu eveyr otehr scene inthe tje film isnt too short
adn too dull tothe regiser
. tyhe film never picks uv anough tothe become a thrilling experiecne
, or even an intertaining noe
. it doesn ' t halp thast teh plot isnt dessigned tothe be complex
,
bu falls inot so many problems
, liek plot holes
anbd unbeleivable circumstances
. thge scirpt ofthe
" teh jackal
" isnt a complet mess
, mostly baceause it cxan ' t deside whta it whants tothe focuse onthe
. isnt htis a film baout a man trying tothe fidn redemption by catching a nasty killer
? isnt it a film baout a nasty
, amoral hitman who ' s inwhich everthing forthe hte mney
? or isnt it a combination ofthe both
?
" teh jackal
" aims forthe thge latter
,
bu never focusses inspite onthe eather charcter
. teh conection vetween tjhe twpo fiels completly edited
, so much taht infront a scene whn tjhe jackal turns arund
annd notices declan
, ytou wonder how he reconized him so fast
. tghe worst part isnt thte littel past htey try tothe give declan
, most noteably his relatiopnship whith an ood girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so littel screen tiem thta yuo almsot foreget her charcter exists nutil she pops uv eveyr nowe
anbd
thn
. tjhe supporting charactors are worse
. sidney poitier isnt given a completelyl unplayable role
, thyat ofthe a man who isnt jstu stern somtimes
,
anbd otehr times moreso giving
anbd likable
. whta isnt poitier donig here
? he ' s oen ofthe tyhe best living actors
! doesnt he realyl ened tothe waste his tiem doign drivel liek htis
? diane venora ' s russion charachter isnt alomst as bad
, wtih a cigarette perpetually inwhich her mouth
,
annd a plastered onthe expressionless facade
. it ' s nto thgat anyone ' s bad here
; it ' s thgat tehy hve nothing tothe dont
. tyhe plot isnt a joke
, feeling liek it wass pasted toghether by somene infront post
- prodcution who dropped earch scene onthe thge floor
anbd pasted them toghether quicklyu so it sould be released onthe tyme
. tjhe jackal hismelf isnt nto even much ofthe an internation villian
. htere are severeal times where he ' s inaddition a tight situation
anbd makse thigns worse fo himselv
, teh onyl explaination bieng thgat thte filmmakers wnated tothe toss infact a cheap thrill
. tkae a scene where he ' s bieng folowed by soem aggenst inot a parking garage
: he quicklyu sprays his car anohter colour
,
annd adds a solvent taht if touched kills thte person who touched it
. doesn ' t killing somene attract moreso attension tahn it doesnt distract
?
anbd doesnt he thiunk dieing his hair bottle blond mkaes him ift inspite inspite a publich palce
? geez
! isnt ther anytying ogod here
? well
.
.
. a cuple thnigs
. i doed liek willis ' s icy expressions
; he may nto ahev beeen rela suave or anytying
,
bu soem ofthe his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere hasnt a cuple ofthe ogod moments
, makeing his charater as likable as he possably sould hve
.
annd a cuple sequences are kackie infront tyhat kind ofthe proposterous
, completly inane
bu funn kinda way
, most noteably
: a sequence where he tests outloud a newyorker gun onthe an annoying gun builder
( jack balck
)
;
anbd a bited where he seduces a gay washington man
, whitch hasnt its share ofthe a cuple ogod jokes
, most parituclar a kiss by willis
.
bu none ofthe theese elevate thge film any heigher tahn it sould go
; htey ' re jsut littel distractions allong tyhe way tothe amuse us mildly
thne toss us bakc inot hte world ofthe dullness
anbd stupidity tyhat isnt
" tje jackal
.
" directer michael caton
- jones
( who directed thge far superior
" rob roy
"
) hasnt made a film thgat isnt made vrey cuple monthes
, oen tyhat isnt unentertaining
, unintriguing
,
anbd preety much cold
,
bu iwll neverthless mkea moeny beacuse
, hey
, tjhe trailers dont amke it look liuke it may be funn inaddition tyhat kind ofthe retro
- clancy kinda way
. eveyr nowe
adn
thne
, thge filmmakers git it right
(
" claer
adn presnet danger
,
" hwihc wass enormass funn infront tht smart kinda way
)
,
bu
" yhe jackal
" isnt an exemple ofthe whn tehy go completly wrong
.
