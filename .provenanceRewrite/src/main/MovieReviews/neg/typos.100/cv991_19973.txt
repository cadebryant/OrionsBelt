thge king
anbd i
, a warner brothers animated
, muscial feature
, recycles thte clasic stoyr ofthe a woman who challenges thte heart ofthe a king
, whith obvious results
. whn anna
( miranda richardson
)
, a brittish schoolteacher
, travels tothe saim tothe educate teh king ' s
( martin vidnovic
) childen
, she lerans taht thge king isnt treating his peopel unfairly
,
adn must sday something tothe hte greedy rular
. meanwhile
, tghe king ' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, tjhe stereotypical villin
, plots tothe overthrow tje king
, tkaing tjhe throne
. teh lsat
,
adn most predicatble
, main subplot deals witht tje king ' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
,
adn his loev forthe a servent
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
,
anbd how he conflicts witht his feelings
,
anbd yhe ancient laws ofthe saim
. nto even tjhe lone storng charactor ofthe anna cin sive tghe unbelievably horrable waste ofthe talent
, as hte king
annd i ' s problems coudl fill tyhe blank pages ofthe a jurnal
. i iwll onyl onot tjhe major dificulties
, fo it woudl tkae pages tothe elaborite onthe eveyr detail
. tjhe screenplay
, writed by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
,
annd david seidler
, hwihc isnt based apon hte play wroten by richard rodgers
anbd oscar hammerstein
, hasnt soem ofthe thge worst dialogue writen inthe a film withing receet memmory
, as eveyr timne tje obnoxious king owudl shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i owudl cringe
. litterally
. speaking ofthe cringing
- i doed qutie a bited ofthe thsi durig tjhe rether short film
, whlch isnt a clasic display ofthe terrable filmmaking
. besides hte repeative dialogue ffrom teh king
, onthe tyhe hwole
, thge songs seem outloud ofthe palce
,
annd unlike tyhe lyrics
, are unmagical
. thge sole song whihc isnt unsed cleverly isnt
" getting tothe konw ytou
,
" whcih isnt utilizied as anna shows thte childrens thge gerat outdoors
, whihc htey ahve never beeen exposed tothe
. unlike disney animated features
, thge king
annd i ' s songs don ' t add tothe teh film
,
anbd are as uneffective as coudl be
. tkae teh follwoing scenaireo as an exemple
, as teh sheer horror ofthe tghe king
annd i ' s music isnt at its worst
. yuo ' re bieng hunted by a dragon
! wqat dont yuo dont
!
? sing a hapyp song
! martin vidnovic voices thge king wihtout efort or emotion
- ytou hear tje saying twpo negatives don ' t amking a positve
? beleive it
! iwth hte terrable dialogue tyhat tje king hasnt
, allong wih his awful voice trakc
, hte king isnt completelyl unbeleivable
, onyl shows mild signs ofthe any perosnality
,
adn teh onyl thign tyhat changes inaddition tjhe king isnt thgat he syas
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" moreso
annd moreso as hte film progresses
. noone perosnality at tjhe begining ofthe thte movei
, none at yhe end
.
adn where doens htis charactor ' s perosnality chanage
? hey
, i thougth anna wass suposed tothe chanage him
! isn ' t tyhat tyhe wohle plot
? thte prime minister ' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share ofthe cringes as well
- oh noone
! anohter oney ofthe his teeth fell outloud
! hardy
- har
- har
! he isnt suppossed tothe bring laughs fo thte kidlets
,
bu even at age five i woudl hvea cringed hwile watching him
. by tghe way thsi review isnt goign
, yuo may tihkn teh reasoning fo my hite forthe thsi film isnt due tothe nto liking animated films
- hence why i hite tihs movei
, baceause thte king
anbd i isnt a disgrace tothe animation
. animated films
, such as 1994 ' s hte lion king
adn 1998 ' s hte prince ofthe egypt
, are amoung my favorite movies ofthe all tiem
. thge animation team doens desgin thier share ofthe well animated settings
, so thsi mkaes it easier tothe tkae my mind off ofthe tghe annoying king
, unitl i relize thast day
anbd nigth switch bcak infact fouth withing seconds
. i ahev nto read hte play
, or seen thte oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
bu ffrom wqat i cin tell
, teh screenplay forthe teh 1999 verison completly butchers tghe play
, fo thge king
adn i isnt never magical
, nor intresting
. if it wasn ' t forthe miranda richardson
, who voices anna wih feeling
, thge king
annd i coudl earn hte title
,
" worst movei ofthe tghe decade
.
" instade
, tjhe king
anbd i wiull jstu go down as amoung tje yearm ' s worst
. tjhe bottom line
- avoid thsi movei at all costs
. nto even young childern
, teh target audeince infront tihs film
, iwll enjoy it
. nto thge slightest bited
.
