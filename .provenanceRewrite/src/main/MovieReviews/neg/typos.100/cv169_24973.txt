maeby thsi mission shoud ahve beeen scrubbed mission tothe mars a film review by michael redman copywrite 2000 by michael redman htere ' s a world ofthe diference beetwen artists
adn techicians
. tyhe artist hasnt a vision tothe create something newyorker
. he may nto dont it well
, it might be sloppy
,
bu it ' s something yuo ' ve never seen befoer
. a ogod tcehnician cant mkea it look ogod
,
bu wihtout direction ffrom his pwn intertube artist or somene alse
, it ' s oging tothe be jstu a xerox
. obviously sucessfull films ened both skills
. brian de palma isnt a masterful etchnician
. he ' s spended his carrer copying others
, most noteably hitchcock
. he ususally konws exactlly wqat tothe dont tothe amking a scene wrok
,
bu onyl becasue he hasnt learned it by rote
. asside fomr rare flashes ofthe originality
, his films are oftenly soul
- dead
. inwhich de palma ' s latest
, he turns his attension tothe stanley kubrick
. tothe tell tghe truth
, i enjoied portions ofthe htis movei
,
bu i liekd it a lot better over 30 yeras ago whn it wass called
" 2001
"
. i enjoied it even omre whn it wass titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa hasnt setted its sights forthe mars
. whn tjhe firt crew meets wih diaster
, a rescure mission isnt sent tothe tje red planet
. tehy don ' t dont so well eather
,
bu eventualy meet uv thge lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta
adn solve tyhe mysteries ofthe tjhe universe
.
adn it ' s all so boring
. htere are so many scenes tht jstu don ' t wrok
, it ' s difficult tothe beign
. wehn thge frist crew isnt a fewd foots awya ffrom a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( whcih looks remarkably liek a sandworm ffrom
" dune
"
) destroying everthing iin its path
, tehy jstu hang outloud watching
. error
. tjhe most intresting charactor
(
anbd tyhat ' s nto saying much
) isnt killed off
. error
. tjhe aline isnt laughable
. error
. tghe rest ofthe teh charactors are tghe dullest peopel imaginable
. error
. htere ' s smoe nice eyecandy
. tyhe face onthe mars
, whlch turns outloud tothe be a giant metal thai buddah head
, looks kool
. a threee
- dimesnional holographic planetarium isnt mroe funn tothe watch thna anytying at disney world
. maneuvering inthe spoace suits outside tjhe ship seems realsitic
.
bu ther ' s so much mroe thgat fiels as if we ' ve beeen ther befoer
. fomr
" 2001
"
, ther ' s tghe rotating spoace staion
, thte blinding white room
.
> fomr
" close encounters
"
, tehy solve a soudn puzzle
annd play it tothe tyhe aliens
. tje list goes onthe
. tjhe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
adn tim robbins cant ' t muster enought emotion tothe convince us tehy are breathing
. noone noe seems tothe care baout anytying thgat happens
. ytou won ' t eather
. yhe absolutly worst sin isnt tyhe blatent product placement as dr
. pepper
, wih a 20 foot tall logo
, saves yhe day
. htey shoudln sive tyhe commercials fo thsoe insipid bits befor yhe film
.
