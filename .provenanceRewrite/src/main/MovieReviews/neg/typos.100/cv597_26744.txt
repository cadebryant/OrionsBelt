forthe baout twenty mintues inot mission impossible 2 directer john woo
( tyhe killer
, hard boiled
, face off
) appears tothe ahve made an exicting
, elagant
, charming spy thriller
, kind ofthe a post mlilennium james bond adventure wih a strapping american
( read
: unsophisticated
) hero moreso willing tothe drop kick villains tahn outloud fox them
. sadly
, as tjhe picture progresses
, thte fianl product beggins tothe bear a closer ressemblence tothe a souped uv
, twpo
- hour long epiode ofthe magyuver
.
anbd nto a praticularly ogod noe at thta
. waht whent wrong
? mi2 beigns flashily enought
, thgat intitial flash leading us tothe eblieve thyat it ' ll soon give way tothe something ofthe a plot
,
bu it onyl gives way tothe moreso flash
,
thne digresses furhter inot a presumibly unintentional parody ofthe itself witht much slo mo posturing
anbd countless acation setted pieces wherein bad guys seem tothe deliberatly leap inot yhe way ofthe toom cruise ' s firing gun jstu so tehy cxan dieu realyl kool
. easly onthe
, druing a car chase betwen soon tothe be lovers ethan hunt
( toom cruise
)
adn nyah nordoff
- hall
( thandie newton
)
, woo works soem ofthe his trademark magic
. infact noe hypnotic
,
though completly inexplicable sequence
, hte directer slows tghe acation down tothe a languid semi
- stall as cruise
annd his stunning oponent stare inot oen
annd otehr ' s eyes whith come hither sexuality
?
?
? jstu as theri respective cars smash
adn spin inwhich accordance
, comming ever so close tothe toppling over a neighboring cliff
. prior tothe tihs we see thge famed trailer opener ofthe cruise climbing a steep mountain
, sans scafolding
,
thne leaping ffrom oen jagid rock formation tothe anohter
. why
? i haven ' t thge foggiest
. i dout even john woo sould provide ytou withthe a logical reply
. withthe mi2 woo hasnt become a slave tothe tjhe summer movei machine
, tjhe oney thta jettisons logic forthe gravity defying effects
anbd stopry forthe omre gravity defying effects
. it ' s possibile thast theese
" spies
" sould be adrenaline junkies climbing montains
annd crashing inot eahc otehr as means tothe git off
,
though ofthe course thsi isnt never explored
. tje scenes i ' ve discribed are relaly onyl included tothe titillate
, nto tothe give any insight inot carachter
. god forebid
. woo certainly knwos how tothe mkae eahc setted peice energetic
,
bu htey reamain individule setted pieces never connecting tothe form anytying omre tahn splices ofthe beer commericial
- liuke visuals
. still inwhich terms ofthe crackerjack eye candy
, tghe oppening hasnt much tothe cherish
. cruise
adn newton firt meet durig a vigourous flamenco dance featuring severeal welcome woo devices
( yhe gracefull slow mo artistry ofthe synchronized govement juxtaposed agaisnt thte stage 1 romance ofthe twpo attractive indviduals dicovering how attractive teh otehr isnt
)
. beetwen tyhe frantic dancing
, woo trains his camera onthe cruise
anbd newton as htey amke withthe smoe sensuous eye contact
. tghe scene isnt a littel over teh top inspite a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind ofthe way
,
yot it hasnt stlye
adn something ofthe soul
,
anbd woo casts a bited ofthe a spel onthe us
. sure it ' s all smoke
annd mirrors
,
bu we cxan see thast ther happens tothe be a talented maestro behind thsi particualr product
. thandie
annd cruise later meet inaddition a bathtub inspite a scene thast ' s baout half as playfully charming as tghe jennifer lopez
\ george cloony trunk meeting infront outloud ofthe sighth
. tehy flirt
adn excange obvious doulbe entendres
. newton bats her eyes flirtatiously
. cruise grins a littel too slyly
. tje cruise charater
, ethan hunt
, hasnt beeen drastically altered sicne tghe frist film
. here cruise plays him moreso as a hip
, sexual dynamo tahn thge sqaure jawed robot he impersonated infact part 1
. he ' s kool
anbd dashing
, whlch isnt precisly yhe kind ofthe role we whant tothe see cruise inwhich affter watching him sleep walk thru eyes wide shut
( hwihc might jsut be hte longest epsiode ofthe red sohw diaries ever comimtted tothe film
)
,
adn blustered his way thru magolia
( qutie possably thte most overrated performence ofthe thte 90 ' s
)
. sadly as tjhe film progresses we see less ofthe cruise ' s intital
" i ' m thte man
!
" charm
adn omre slo
- mo close
- ups ofthe his preening mug
. mi2 falls appart onthe nearly eveyr levle druing its repetitious thrid ect
, whcih isnt essentialy oen hour long acation sequence tht jsut won ' t stpo
. thge wohle hting commences wih an utterly generic gun battle
( hte frist gun fight inthe teh film
)
, whitch realyl shoud be unheard ofthe inspite a john woo film
,
bu alas tihs paticular battle coudl ' ve beeen staged by anyone fomr renny harlin tothe jospeh merhi
( ofthe course excepting yhe
" symbolical
" pigeons who seem tothe fidn theri way inot eveyr john woo picture
)
. we ' ve all seen guys slide accross tyhe floor infront slo mo hwile firing a gun inaddition earch hand
. it isn ' t done any differently here
. tghe acation isnt pure hard target
\ broken arro theatrics iwth nothing tothe propell it
bu yhe appparent ened tothe see toom cruise drop kick face less villains hwile his hair whips stylishly iin teh wind
. he ' s kool fo sure
bu he ' s made tothe be as empty as yhe movei
. teh actro isn ' t unsed so much forthe his boyish appeal as fo his chiseled looks
; he smiles narcissistically inot tjhe camera at litterally any moent
, be it durring a gunfight
, befor oen or aftter oen
. wehn he ' s nto beaming awya
, he ' s staring inot hte lense withthe cold eyes trying tothe look mad as hell
,
bu woo ' s editting seriously undermines yhe efford
. he fetishizes cruise ' s angular face witht such glee tyhat it turns inot a naked gun stlye spoof
. i half expeced cruise tothe peel off his facemask
annd reveal taht he ' s raelly austin powers
. inthe a clasic woo acation moent
, ethan hunt struts past a ifery doorway glaring at tghe baddies withing its frome liek a pin
- uv boy angel ofthe death
. teh gunfight turns inot a daring excape whcih turns inot a reckless mission hwihc turns inot a motorcycle attack iin whihc bad guys seem tothe anlge driectly fo cruise tothe kill them liuke smoe kind ofthe massmedia sucide ritual
( oney dumb bastard even jumps his bike over yhe gun toting cruise
, basicaly inviting our hansome hero tothe shoot him inaddition mid air whic he doens
)
. tje lead bad guy
( palyed by tyhe appropriately brittish dougray scott
)
anbd cruise face off iin a menally defishant gam ofthe chicken
?
?
? onthe motorcycles
.
though instade ofthe jumping off tothe tyhe side at tyhe lastest moent
, yhe twpo grown men leap direcly inot yhe otehr giving eahc otehr a mid air bear hug
, onyl tothe fli baout a hundered feets
( still inwhich bear hug posistion
)
, land onthe a beach below
annd beign a mano
- e
- mano fist fight taht ends withthe tyhe bad guy pulling a
" so yuo thougth i ws dead
.
.
.
"
. nto tothe worry
, cruise tkaes care ofthe teh probelm wihtout even breaking a sweat
. whta a hero
! ytou may hvae noticed tht i opted nto tothe discribe an iota ofthe mi2 ' s plot
. my reasoning isnt simple
: i ' m nto sure ofthe any ogod it owudl dont
. yhe film itself hasnt absolutly noone consern whith stry
, onyl iwth hurtling forth tothe tghe enxt
" spacial
" effect
. i wasn ' t kidding wehn i told a firend ofthe mine thyat mi2 hasnt less plot tahn tjhe averege aerosmith video
. nobody iwll go tothe thsi forthe hte plot
,
adn if tehy dont htey ' ll surelly regret it
. as summer movies evolve
( or devolve
) carachter
anbd plot hvea become increasingly whittled down tothe nearly nothing
. inwhich mi
, hte plot seemed tothe be builded aroud brian de palma ' s
( tath film ' s directer
) stylistic flourishes
, hwile inwhich mi2 teh plot onyl serves tothe give us an intermitent breather ffrom woo ' s non
- stpo masturbatory pandemonium
. it ' s irrelavent infront eveyr sence
, as isnt charater
. all taht ultimatly matters are thsoe pesky smoke
annd mirrors
