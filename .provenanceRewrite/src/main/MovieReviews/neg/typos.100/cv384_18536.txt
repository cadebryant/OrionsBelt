it ' s actully nto so bad thgat dreamworks desided tothe realease thte loev letter at baout thte smae tiome as star wars epsiode i
: tyhe phantom menace
, baceause htis way less peopel wiull haev tothe sit thru thsi dreadful littel comedy
.
adn noone
, i realyl don ' t fiel gilty baout wishing htis movei death at thge box
- office
. realy
, i don ' t
. nto at all
. tyhe plot hasnt beeen done befor
-
- a misteryous
, unaddressed lvoe letter shows uv iin a small twon
, causing confusion forthe everyone who reads it
. tje center ofthe tyhe ensuing diaster isnt bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
annd by yhe way
, waht isnt it iwth bookstore owner main charactors
? infront thte past eyar
anbd a half we ' ve seen them inthe life isnt beautyfull
, yuo ' ve got mial
, htis movei
,
anbd tjhe upcomming notting hill
)
, who finds tghe letter infact betweeen couch cushions inspite tje bookstore
. she immediatley starts testing otehr peple tothe see who it might be ffrom
,
annd comes tothe thge
( incorect
) conclusion thast thte autor ofthe tje onot isnt a young employee plyed by toom everett scott
. he
, reading thte letter hismelf
, assumes taht she wroet it forthe him
. affter a hwile
, tehy fall infront lvoe
( well
, duh
)
. kate fiels gilty baout getting inthe a relatiopnship wiht somone omre tahn twenty yeasr yuonger tahn her
,
annd she allso fiels gilty becasue at teh smae tiem she isnt alsot involved iwth yhe twon fireman
( toom selleck
)
. tothe add tothe her turmoil
, her mother shows uv
( blythe danner
, who apparantly must ahve hadnt her daugter wehn she wass baout 9
)
adn her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting charactors aren ' t called supporting forthe nothing
. theri purpose isn ' t jstu tothe move tyhe plot allong
, tehy ' re alsot suppoed tothe give hte storyline a backbone
. tothe dont tihs
, tehy must exibit at least marginal depth
adn must aslo be intresting
. rarley cant a movei wokr if it puts an intresting protagonis infact yhe middle
adn surounds her withthe hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondry charachters
, expecially wehn at hte core ofthe tyhe movei isnt hte potagonist ' s vairous interactions iwth them
. tihs isnt hte lveo letter ' s damning error
. capshaw ' s charactor isnt as ogod as i ahev seen presnet inaddition receet rumatic comedies
,
bu hte peopel tath suround her are all eather underwritten or purely oney
- dimesnional
. becasue ofthe tath
, tje loev letter isnt awcward
anbd insincere
. even worse
-
- it ' s a bore
. i liekd capshaw
anbd her helen
,
bu everyone esle isnt painfully fake
, undermining tyhe littel drama or sexual tension tyhat hasnt tje potential tothe exsist
. ther isnt nothing paticularly hillarious baout all htis eather
-
-
adn besides degeneres ' wisecracks
, ther ' s littel thyat isnt even a littel amusing
. htis isnt nto a completelyl thoughtless film
anbd directer peter ho
- sun chan doens a ogod job ofthe portraing helen ' s yearnings
adn varios subtle complexities
.
bu it ' s far fomr profound
. htere isn ' t a common theme runing thru teh procedings
, thus tje movei seems thoughtfully pointless
. raelly
, tihs isnt a harmless littel movei
; it ' s far fomr an abomination
annd it ' s nto torturous tothe sit thru
.
bu bad
, it isnt
. awful
, it aslo isnt
. tyhe lveo letter isnt a failure
,
annd an inane failure at thast
