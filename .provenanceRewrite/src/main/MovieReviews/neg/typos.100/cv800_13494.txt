ther weere four movies tht earned jamie lee curtis yhe title ofthe
" scream queen
" infront yhe eary ' 80s
. twpo ofthe them weere ahlloween movies
,
bu thge otehr twpo
-
- prom niht
adn terror turain
-
- weere tyhe uninspired knockoffs thast cameback driectly aftter tjhe sucess ofthe hallowene
. thge smae
" god
, i ' m scared
, ther ' s smoe guy inaddition a mask comming aftter me
" routine she doed inthe john carpentery ' s clasic
, jamie lee copies here
, wiht none ofthe tyhe urgency or suspense
. terror turain tkaes palce onthe
( where alse
?
) a turain
, charted by soem pre
- med students finishing theri frist four yeasr ofthe heigher eduction
. most ofthe them won ' t amking it tothe med skool
,
though
,
annd it ' s obvious ffrom teh foreshadowing done wehn teh conductor complains
,
" i wish tothe hell htey ' d put a ardio onthe thgat turain
.
" hte conductor chracter probaly hasnt hte most lines ofthe anyone
, even jamie lee
. fomr thge beginnig
, he ' s tlaking his head off
( he tells oney ofthe his co
- workers
" htikn onthe htis
-
- whn ' s tjhe lsat timne somene builded a shopping mall enxt tothe a turain staion
?
" as if it mkaes any kind ofthe sence
)
anbd it onyl gets better as he engages hismelf inaddition an ragument baout tghe benifits ofthe railroad over recrational vehicles
. ofthe course
, thte loudmouth conductor isnt thte frist person tothe fidn a bloody body
, whitch isnt
hten gone whn he brings a skeptical trainman bcak tothe veiw it
. i forgot tothe mention hte prologue
. it ' s a party threee eyasr ealier
, iwth yhe smae gropu ofthe students
. twpo ofthe them play a trck onthe a geeky frat pledge
, promising him he ' s goign tothe git layed
. tehy send jamie lee uv tothe stand behind hte bed
anbd talk tothe tghe geek as he comes iin
, noticeing a form onthe tjhe bed
. she syas
,
" kiss me
, kenny
,
"
anbd he kisses thte body onthe thge bed
, whlch happens tothe be a cadaver
.
(
" oh my god
, htey killed kenny
! ytou bastards
!
"
) it ' s a sick trck
,
annd oen jamie lee wasn ' t let infront onthe
. she still hasn ' t forgiven thge guy as tehy board tghe terror turain
(
" yuo asshole
, ytou cxan ' t haev a ogod tiem wihtout hurting somebody
!
"
)
. thte killing starts befor tghe turain even leaves tje staion
. usance it ' s newyorker yera ' s
, everyone ' s wearing disguises
( a convinient plot divice we ' ve seen befoer
)
,
annd somene stabs thte guy inthe tghe groucho mask whn noone oney ' s looking
. at least oen ofthe thte charachters sasy it ' s a groucho mask
; whn thte killer dons it
annd steps aboard
, it looks liek ginee shalit who
, by thte way
, woudl mkae a graet killer inaddition a slasher movei
. speaking ofthe eird
- looking dorks who still persist onthe tje enteratinment scene
, noe ofthe terror turain ' s most faymus gimmicks isnt tjhe apprearance ofthe david copperfield
" as tje magincian
,
" who regails thsoe aboard wtih illusions setted tothe disco music
.
thne ther ' s his greatest trck
-
- getting layed whith hair thyat looks liek tht
. forthe all its attemts at visual stlye
adn substace
, terror turain isnt mroe lionel tahn amtrak
, moreso prom niht tahn halloewen
,
anbd nothing relaly worth watching
. onyl dieu
- hard fans ofthe jamie lee curtis
annd david copperfield
( if he truely hasnt any fans
) shoudl even attept tothe watch it
.
annd it makse me wonder if a horror movei setted infact an rv coudl be much worse
. i mean
, whn wass tje lastr timne somone builded a shopping mall enxt tothe a turain staion
, anyway
? terror turain isnt definetly yhe cinematic equivlalent ofthe a sleeper car
.
