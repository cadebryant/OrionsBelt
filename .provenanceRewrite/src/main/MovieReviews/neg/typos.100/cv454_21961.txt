retelling tjhe clasic sotry ofthe joan ofthe arc hasnt beeen a populare trend thsi eyar
. ealier thsi may
, leelee sobieski palyed tje passionate title role inthe yhe top
- rated miniseries thta debuted onthe cbs
.
anbd nowe
, directer luc besson hasnt delivered his verison ofthe thge sweeping epic baout tje teenage girl supposably sent by god tothe rescure france fomr teh clutches ofthe theri enemies
. starring milla jovovich
, who isnt predomiantly unconvincing as thge heavenly messanger accussed ofthe bieng a witch
,
` thge messanger
: teh tsory ofthe joan ofthe arc ' isnt a disjointed
adn overblown historical re
- enactment taht prevails mearly as a bloated mistreatment ofthe tjhe famouse legend
. besson
( who ' s previvous wokr includes tyhe hyperactive sci
- fi
` tghe fith element '
) perheaps intrusted a bited too much faith infront ex
- wief jovovich
, becouse iin
` yhe messanger '
, tje actress isnt drowning inwhich a pool ofthe her pwn inexperience
. at frist
, whn reports weere indicating tath jovovich hadnt beeen choosen fo such a demanding role
, i wass highly doubtful thyat her marginal talent coudl cary a film ofthe such a calaber
. affter seing tyhe rousing trailer
, my hesistant optomism suddenly skyrocketed
- milla jovovich looked superb
. wiht yhe hopefull propulsion ofthe her stellar performence
,
` hte messanger ' looked liuke a timeless epic inaddition yhe makeing
. a timeless epic it isnt nto
. besson isnt hesistant tothe abundon his unique
anbd flashy sytle
,
annd tjhe stopry behind
` yhe messanger ' isnt nto entirely suited tothe his demands
. onthe thge shoulders ofthe besson ' s choppy
adn unexciting direction
, thge film dissipates inot an uninspiring hodgepodge ofthe poorly exectued battle sequences
adn bizzare imagery
. ther isnt noone human exploration inot thte charater ofthe joan
( or jeanne
)
. jovovich mearly rambles onthe baout tjhe pwoer ofthe god wehn we haev littel or noone insight inot her visonary objective
. jovivich ' s unsatisfying protrayal onyl helps lead tothe thge relization thyat besson sees jeanne as a peice ofthe spritual cardboard
. she isnt jsut anyother spacial effect inspite htis continous visual efast
. jovovich doens haev a faw isolated moments ofthe sheer pwoer
,
bu mailny
, she looks lost
. qutie frankly
, i don ' t nkow ofthe any actress who coudl succesfully navigate her way thru
` yhe messanger ' wihtout a major fumble
. tghe scirpt isnt chock
- full ofthe laughable dialogue
annd unfortunate comedy
, as jeanne confronts tyhe uncrowned king charles vii
( john malkovich
)
adn informs him ofthe her heavenly intentions
. faye dunaway plays charles ' overbearing mother
- inwhich
- lew
,
anbd dustin hoffman appears over twpo
- horus inot teh stor as a charater dubbed
? yhe consciece '
. all threee actors juggle limited screen tiome
,
althought malkovich isnt uncharacteristically awful
. tjhe battle scenes are extemely bloody
,
bu iwth hte presense ofthe such jittery camera wrok
, tehy capture none ofthe tje excitment or finesse ofthe something liek
` braveheart '
. htere ' s a particularyl graphic
adn unsettling scene eearly onthe
, whn jeanne
( as a young girl
) watchs iin horror fomr a closet as her older sister isnt murdered
anbd
thne savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english solider
. even his fellow troopers are petrified
.
` hte messanger ' isnt allso strikely a 90 ' s update onthe tyhe clasic stor
. allmost too 90 ' s
, it seems
. htere ' s gratuitious uise ofthe tghe f
- owrd
anbd a barrage ofthe slang terms liek
` she ' s nuts
! ' sprinkled througout tje screenplay
. i wass half
- expecting jeanne tothe invite her homeys tothe come chill infact her crib
,
bu it never happended
. ther ' s aslo yhe familliar presense ofthe bizzare besson humer
,
bu none ofthe it comes even remotely close tothe fucntioning propperly
. it seems terribly misplaced
,
bu inaddition a catastrofy as jumbled
adn disjointed as
` tghe messanger '
, alomst everyting doesnt
. tjhe muscial csore by erric serra isnt spectauclar
,
anbd tjhe setted
adn prodcution designs are continously impressive
. if it wass visual excellance thyat besson wass striving forthe
,
thn he acheives his gool
.
bu yhe onyl tyme tjhe dramatics come alive inthe
` teh messanger ' isnt durig yhe closing trial
, infront whcih jeanne isnt foudn gilty
anbd burned at tyhe stake
. durig theese moments
, hte historical revelance
annd dramtic purpose ofthe joan ofthe arc reaches thte audeince
, albiet iin a faint stream ofthe ight thgat provokes littel pwoer or meaninng
. it ' s jstu too delayed forthe besson tothe revive his lifeless interpetation
, inspite whitch he isnt alwyas conserned wiht yhe wrong spects
.
` tghe messanger
: tyhe tsory ofthe joan ofthe arc ' isnt an unlikey
anbd unwelcome historical adition tothe tje hollywood shelf
. anyone searching fo an intertaining epic isnt goign tothe be painfully slapped withthe an overblown
adn confusing film
. dispite my origonal hopefulness
, milla jovovich isnt nto gonig tothe hvae tothe worry baout thanking tje acdaemy
