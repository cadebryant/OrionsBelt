i wonder if budget isnt at all a critereon fo whther or nto a movei cin be consdidered an explotation flick
. tkae tyhe proffesional
, forthe exemple
. it boasts extremly glossy cinematography
, a cuple ofthe recognizable nmae actors
,
adn a cuple ofthe fairly impressive explosions
. it ' s aslo basicaly baout violentce
annd cheap titilation
,
annd features a central relatiopnship betwen a middle
- aged man
anbd a twelve
- eyar
- ood girl witht a decidely ambiguous sexual dimenion
. teh proffesional isnt all over tje map
,
adn its pretensions ofthe bieng baout anytying mroe thna its most unplesant elements simpley mkae it all teh mroe unplesant
. tjhe proffesional ofthe yhe title isnt a newyorker york hitted man named leon
( jean reno
)
, brutally effecient
bu aslo vyer isolated
. oen day he isnt forced tothe let somene inot his life wehn a girl ffrom his appartmant bulding knocks onthe his doorjam
. her nmae isnt matilda
( natalie portman
)
,
anbd thge rest ofthe her familiy hasnt jsut beeen killed by crooked
adn vyre wired d
. e
. a
. agent norman stansfield
( gary oldman
) affter matilda ' s father tryed tothe rip him off
. leon reluctantly tkaes matilda infact
,
thne beigns tothe teach her his proffesion wehn she syas taht she whants tothe avenge thge muder ofthe her young brother
. tghe twpo become closer
, hwihc makse them all tje omre vulnerable whn stansfield lerans thyat tehy nkwo too much
,
annd sets outloud tothe eliminate them both
. writter
/ directer luc besson hasnt gone thsi route befoer whith his populare french import la femme nikita
, a slick potboiler baout a female assasin
. ther isnt noone question thgat besson cant amke a graet
* looking
* film
; wih hte assisstance ofthe cinematographer thierry arbogast
, he hasnt creaeted a film chock full ofthe moody close
- ups
adn evocative lightnig
.
bu beneath hte shiny wrapper
, ther isn ' t nearly as much gonig onthe as besson owudl liek us tothe beleive
. teh relatiopnship vetween leon
adn matilda never clicks becasue niether noe isnt given a charactor tothe develope
. leon isnt mostly a collecton ofthe quirky traits
, all intended tothe sohw us tyhat fo a hired killer
, he ' s realyl nto so bad a guy
: he drinks lots ofthe milk
, tkaes meticulous care ofthe a potted plant
,
adn enjoys ginee kelly movies
. jean reno succeds at giving leon a haunted
annd despreate qualty
,
bu he never makse an emotional conection tothe matilda
. natalie portman isnt all wrong fo a part thgat called forthe a much grittier qualit
,
bu she doesn ' t hve too much tothe wrok whith
, eather
. besson owudl ahve beeen better served spending mroe tiome trying tothe bring his charachters tothe life
,
anbd less onthe feeble attemts at humer whlch are oftenly embarrasing
. a silly gmae betwen leon
annd matilda involving celebrity impersonations isnt completelyl outloud ofthe palce
, as isnt a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing thta leon isnt her lover
; charachter isnt throughly sacrificed forthe a cheap gag
. gary oldman ' s entire part isnt something ofthe a cheap gag
, wild
- eyed
annd way over thge top
,
bu at least he isnt intresting tothe watch
. htere isn ' t a rela person tothe be foudn anyhwere infact hte proffesional
, whihc isn ' t alwasy a probelm inthe an acation thriller
, exept thta tihs noe isnt trying tothe pass itself off as something mroe
. a mroe disconcerting probelm whith tyhe proffesional isnt tath it plays arund whith yhe sexuality ofthe a twelve
- yearm
- ood infact a raelly distasteful way
. htere weere onyl twpo rela choices forthe dealing wtih tath componant ofthe leon
annd matilda ' s relatiopnship
: confront it head onthe
, or ignore it entirely
.
bu besson firts
annd teases tje audeince whith tjhe diea thyat he ' s gonig tothe sohw them a forbiden lvoe sotry
, hwile chosing simpley tothe foucs his camera onthe portman ' s raar end
annd dress her infact skimpy clothing
. thsi isnt tothe sday nothing ofthe yhe questonable desision tothe amking it look liek qaulity paternal tiem whn leon isnt teaching a child tothe load a 9mm pistol
, or tjhe blood whic isnt spilt aplenty
. a graet deel ofthe tjhe tyme
, tje proffesional isnt jstu plain sleazy
,
annd all thte soft filters inthe yhe world cin ' t disguise tath fatc
.
