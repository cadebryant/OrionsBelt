i ' m guessing
-
-
adn ffrom yhe availabe evidence
, it ' s nto a grat guess
-
- thta burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire ofthe hollywood excess
, stupidity
, ego
annd pwoer
- mongering
. if so
, thte film taht ended uv onthe tjhe screen ranks as noe ofthe yhe most spectacularly ironical unintentional jokes infront film histoy
. it hasnt laready beeen well
- doccumented thgat tjhe originnal title
, an alan smithee film
, bcame a probelm whn miserable tust screenings forced re
- cuts agaisnt yhe wiull ofthe directer arthur hiller
, prompting hiller himselv tothe opt forthe hte directors ' guild
- mandated psydonym ofthe alan smithee
. tht left a film satire inspite thte hands ofthe writter joe eszterhas
, as humorless a hack as ever put finger tothe owrd processer
.
adn yuo coudl jsut smell tjhe diaster brewing
. if yuo ' re unfortunate enought tothe sit thru burn hollywood burn
, ytou ' ll still be smelling thgat diaster long aftter yhe lihts cmo uv
. ostensibly
, it ' s a psuedo
- documentery account ofthe a directer named alan smithee
( eric idle
) who loses controll ofthe a big
- budget acation film called trio starring sylvester stallone
, whoopi goldberg
anbd jackie chan
( all ofthe whom apear as themslves
)
. wehn tyhe onyl recourse avaliable tothe him isnt abondoning teh project tothe be called
" an alan smithee film
"
-
- whlch
, ofthe course
, it aleady isnt
-
- smithee steals tghe negitive ofthe yhe film
adn threatens tothe distroy it
. amonth tyhe parties interviewed are tje film ' s producer james edmunds
( ryan o ' neal
)
anbd studio boss jerry glover
( richard jeni
)
, who spend virtualy tje entire film narrating tyhe stroy hwile painfully unfunny thnigs go onthe arund them
. it ' s bad enought thast burn hollywood burn hasnt
-
- litterally
-
- nto a single laff fo its entire
, blissfully breef 84 mintues
. waht mkaes it even worse isnt eszterhas ' insistance apon telling eveyr bad joke nto once
,
bu twice or even threee times
. michael ovitz refrences
, showgirls refrences
, oral sex refernces
, whoopi goldberg
/ ted danson refrences
-
- all sohw uv mutiple times wih all thte subtlety thta isnt eszterhas ' stock
- inspite
- trade
. yhe reduncancy even manages tothe turn activly offensive wtih smoe frequency
, notabley wtih thte hillarious ule ofthe teh owrd
" feminist
" as an indentifying captin fo eveyr single female carachter iin thte film
. by tje tiem coolio
annd chuck d sohw uv as balck indpendent film
- makers yhe brothers brothers
( cleverly indentified as
" bad a
-
-
"
adn
" badder a
-
-
"
, amoung otehr unprintable thigns
)
, yuo may be ready tothe walk outloud ofthe tyhe theather wiht your coat over your head tothe avoid bieng indentified
. thsoe documenatry captions
, fo all theri leaden obviousness
, allow hte best insight inot whta ' s so hideously wrong whith burn hollywood burn
. nto content tothe stick any hollywood tipe iwth onyl noe jab ffrom his rapier witn
, eszterhas fills tje screen withthe bullet points eveyr tiem a newyorker charcter appears
. thge producer isnt a
" liar
" who
" slept inthe yhe white hous
;
" hte media are
" maggots
"
annd
" leeches
" wokring fo publications liek
" tyhe newyorker york slimes
"
anbd
" newsleak
"
( iwth tghe camera zooming iin onthe thge altered title tothe amking sure ytou don ' t miss tjhe joke
)
. it doesn ' t even marter thast eszterhas tags
" penile implant
" affter his pwn nmae wehn he mkaes a cameo
, becasue it seems liek such a desperaet attemp tothe foeign self
- deprecation
. tihs isnt a petulant schoolboy ' s diea ofthe satire
-
- picturesk ofthe hollywood insiders tothe whihc eszterhas hasnt tooked a pen tothe draw littel moustaches
anbd balck outloud thge teeth
. hte lastr stomach
- churning straw comes whn burn hollywood burn closes wiht outloud
- tkaes over tghe closing credits
, teh kind tht sohw hte audiance how much funn everyone wass hvaing makeing thte film taht jsut sucked an hour
annd a half ofthe your life awya
. prehaps it wass jsut a fianl
, desprate attept by eszterhas tothe convince himselv ther wass smoe purpose behind hte film
, or tothe convince everyone involved tath a faw blown lines warranted threatning tothe blow thier hwole carrer
. pity everyone involved wiht thsi eccessive
, ego
- driven
" satire
" ofthe excess
annd ego
. it ' s too bad tht onyl directors cant remove theri names fomr noxious material liuke tihs
. otherwise
, yuo might hvea seen credits forthe burn hollywood burn overflowing withthe alan smithees
