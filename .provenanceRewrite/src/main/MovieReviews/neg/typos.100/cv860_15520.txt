thne
, htere ' s moore
( leland orser
) who speaks 5 lines
annd walks arround wih a puzzled look onthe his face
. tje probelm withthe htis reprehensible movei isnt tht it wnats tothe be a cruel comedy
,
bu it presents thigsn infront a manner tht jsut aren ' t funny
. drugs
, mutilation
,
annd killing your pwn firends isn ' t something tothe be laughed at

.
bu thte way taht he choosed tothe dont it isnt tasteless
. dont nto mkae a vyer bad descision by seing thsi film
