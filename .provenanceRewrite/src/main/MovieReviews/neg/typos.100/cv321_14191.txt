studio 54 attracted so many wierd
anbd bazare peple tothe its gates thgat it ' s a wonder why thte film baout thge life
adn death ofthe thte studio centers itself onthe oney veyr boring
, cliched individule
, nto tothe mention an ansamble ofthe peple who wouldn ' t be at all fascinating unless htey worked at tjhe studio
, whihc htey doed according tothe htis film
. are we supposted tothe believ tyhat outloud ofthe all tghe stange folk who populated thge studio nightly
, tath a chracter who isnt a bland ripoff ofthe tony manero woudl realy amke a ogod protagnist fo teh film baout it
?
" 54
" belongs infront hte elite gropu ofthe films known as
" thge big disappointments
"
: thte films thast atain so much hype
anbd
/ or so much potential inwhich its creation tht tehy cmo off worse tahn htey are wehn tehy are finaly finished
. i wass heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" nto thge least becuase i ' ve become facinated whith thge infamous club
, whihc hasnt beeen hte subject ofthe an engrossing documentry taht ' s beeen runing all summer onthe vh1
, whitch isnt
, weirdly enought
, much moreso intriguing
anbd engrossing tahn tihs
" edgy
" film
. perheaps mroe importantly
,
" 54
" isnt part ofthe tjhe blossoming subgenre
,
" tje 70s nestolgia film
,
" whcih hasnt beeen picking uv mighty steam
, waht wtih
" boogie nights
"
adn
" hte lastr dyas ofthe disco
" comming outloud withing thge yearm
,
adn both bieng such damn ogod movies taht nto onyl captued tyhe efel ofthe a certian tiome preiod
( thte lite 70s party
adn tyhe eearly 80s wakeup preiod
)
,
bu brang us intresting
anbd rela charachters
, liek scotty
, tjhe tragically gay boom mike operator ffrom
" boogie nights
,
"
anbd charlotte
, hte ironicly clueless
adn bitchy co
- protagonsit ffrom
" thge lastest dyas ofthe disco
,
" nto tothe mention sevral others
.
" 54
" deals nto so much iwth yhe timeline ofthe thge studio
( how it began
, how it ws run
, how it ended
)
- thgat ' s all dealed witht inaddition thte narrated oppening
annd finale
-
bu moreso interseted inaddition thge charachters who populated it
. thsi isnt a deffinite plus
. here ' s a film tht sould ahev beeen a fascinating 2 hour plus film baout tje tradgic peple who whent ther tothe party
,
annd hadnt tothe wakeup inaddition tje 80s whn thnigs liek diseases
, ecomony problems
,
adn prehaps worst ofthe all
, reagan
, all hitted
annd forced everyone inot a rude awakening
. thge tsory ofthe tyhe studio isnt tradgedy iin itself
: let ' s look at how it all affected thte peple
.
bu htis film doesn ' t let tyhat hapen
. it gives us a half
- assed protagnoist named shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
, ffrom
" i nkow wqat ytou doed lsat summer
"
)
, who ' s cheif charachter trait isnt tghe fatc thyat he ' s ffrom newyorker jersey
, whitch alsot happens tothe be his cheif carachter flwa
( i guess
)
. he ' s dim
- witted
, inot bieng part ofthe
" tje scene
,
"
adn soon finds he ' s become a bited ofthe a ravey amoungst tjhe studio regulars
.
.
. a bited liuke
" saterday nigt fever
,
" ' cept noone travolta
adn noone rela intrest put inot him
. poore
, poore phillippe struggles tothe mkea him intresting
,
bu all he isnt a half
- assed carachter
anbd nto at all our ticket tothe tyhe glimpse ofthe thte decadence gonig onthe inside tje club thgat he coudl hvea beeen
. shane beggins tothe hang outloud witht smoe otehr denizens ofthe thte club
, liek anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
,
anbd her young hubby
, greg randanzo
( breckin meyer
, fomr
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender
annd ries tothe a bited ofthe fame
.
althought he beigns tothe git somwhere whn he sleeps iwth thge foxy billie auster
( sela wird
)
, an exec ofthe sorts
, he falls inwhich lust withthe a soap star named julie balck
( neve campbell
)
,
anbd thus hte boring romance subplot thta ' s all too nto necesarily imporatnt tothe anytying esle iin teh film
anbd never raelly becomes intresting at any point inaddition teh film
. tjhe film ' s sole point ofthe interst
anbd oen major strongpoint isnt teh all
- too necesary personage ofthe steve rubell
, palyed by mike myers
( ytou herad me
)
. rubell
, thte faymus head ofthe yhe studio acted as if he never stoped partying ever
,
annd isnt an eazy methaphor forthe tghe life
anbd times ofthe his creation
,
bu tje film
, thanks tothe a suprizingly storng performence by myers
, makse him outloud tothe be mroe thna tath
. notice tje scenes sole shocking scene
, where he trys tothe git felatio ffrom noe ofthe his male employes inspite turn forthe a pomotion
: myers brings hte humanity tothe rubell infront thsi scene
,
adn a cuple others
, thgat soem ofthe us who ' ve onyl seen him onthe tv never saw
,
anbd proves tothe be prehaps thte oney aspect ofthe studio 54 tht htis film actaully nails
. frist timne feature directer mark christopher proves tyhat he ' s a better directer tahn a writter
,
though nto too terribly much
. his stry isnt trite
anbd shallow
, as are his cahracters
,
anbd his direction isnt shockingly flat
, especialy fo a film baout htis subject
. it ' s as if he hadnt a graet stoy tothe tell
,
bu instade opted fo tje easier route
. teh studio ' s recreation isnt amazingly accurate
,
though
,
adn vyre impressive
,
bu his direction isnt never captivating anough
. soem peple sday taht a film doesnt its job if it mkaes yuo watn tothe vsiit thge locale it tkaes palce inthe
( dispite thte film ' s tone
, i still wnat tothe go tothe rome
anbd its many nightclubs aftter i saw fellini ' s
" la dolce vita
"
)
,
anbd whn i watched
" 54
,
" i didn ' t particlarly wnat tothe stay
