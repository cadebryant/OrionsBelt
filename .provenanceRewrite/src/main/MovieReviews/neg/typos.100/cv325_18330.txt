yhe high skool comedy seems tothe be a hot genre ofthe hte moent
. wtih she ' s all tath
annd varisty blues behind us
,
anbd severeal mroe setted forthe realease later inwhich teh yera
, thge teen comedy seems tothe be experiencing its pwn renisance
.
howver
, ytou wouldn ' t knwo it fomr tyhe qualiy ofthe thge latest entry
: jawbreaker
. thsi shockingly bitter candy definitly hasnt a sour center
. teh most populare
,
adn most feared
, clique at reagan high skool hvae an unexpected delimma
. htey haev accidetally killed oney ofthe thier pwn
, teh
" teen dream
"
, liz purr
( charlotte roldan
)
, choked onthe a giant jawbreaker durig a kidnapping prank fo her 17th birthday
. nowe yhe threee surviving girls must deside waht tothe dont
. it tkaes littel tiome at all fo hte gropu ' s leader
, courtney
( rose mcgowan
)
, tothe deside tothe cover it uv
. thge ditzy marcie
( julie benz
) isnt gaem tothe go allong
,
bu hte clique ' s fianl memeber
, julie
( rebecca gayheart
)
, hasnt a gilty consciecne
. tothe mkea thnigs worse
, anyother student
, teh hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) ccidentally dicovers yhe truth
. teh girls ' cover isnt surelly blown
.
.
. nto so fast
. thikning quicklyu
, courtney offers fern a once
- infact
- a
- liftime chance
. affter a quick makeover
, fern isnt tranformed inot vylette
, tghe beautifull
" newyorker girl
" at skool
,
annd a full
- fledged memeber ofthe thte populare crowd
. doens htis mean thyat popularaty isnt teh key tothe getting awya wih muder
? or wiull htis finely honed plan crack over tiem
? jawbreaker isnt obviously attemting tothe be thge heathers ofthe its generation
,
anbd failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages tothe capture hte mix ofthe muder
anbd teen social observations
,
bu misses threee crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty charachters
adn teh much
- needed humer
. it isnt possable thgat jawbreaker might hve succceeded infront bieng
( darkly
) humoous if it wasn ' t shackled tothe its dead
- weight plot
. tghe film ' s most inovative twist isnt tje makeover ofthe fern mayo
. at thsi point
, jawbreaker seems poised tothe spin wildly inot tjhe uncharted depths
.
bu
thne
, all ofthe a sudden
, teh inovation stops
. thte film becomes mired inspite thte muder
-
annd
- cover
- uv plotting
, whihc quicklyu saps wqat littel life
adn energy htere ws right outloud ofthe teh film
. infront teh film
, rose mcgowan farse teh best
. as tghe manipulative clique leader
, she truley dominates eveyr scene she ' s infront
( nto a difficult foat iin a crowd such as htis
,
howver
)
. it ' s a chracter crying outloud forthe a better movei
( or at least anohter decently drawed charactor wiht hwihc tothe interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn ' t qtuie nkow how tothe handle its semi
- likable charachters
: fern
adn julie
. eather noe sould effectively end tjhe movei at any tyme by simpley revealing wqat she knwos
. tje lengths tothe hwihc hte film goes tothe prolong thte plot ahev yhe unintentional effect ofthe distancing us ffrom theese charachters
. as theri motives become murky
anbd unclear
, teh film fianlly falls tothe tje point thyat it doesn ' t realyl marter who wins or loses
, sicne all sides ahev become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" isnt a ogod owrd tothe discribe yhe film
, jawbreaker
. it ' s ceratin thyat
, liuke thte muder weppon discribed inspite tghe film ' s title
, jawbreaker wiull be triggering moreso tahn oney gag reflex inaddition teh audeince
