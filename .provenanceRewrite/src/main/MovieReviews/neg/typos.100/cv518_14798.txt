, as i check my scoer kard forthe waht i ' ve done htis hloiday weekend
, it reads ogod idesa
: 0
annd dumb idesa
: 1
. i don ' t nkwo whta i ws thingking whn i desided tothe watch htis movei
.
bu infact my defense
, i cxan onyl sday tath it ws somene esle who urged me tothe see thsi iwth him
. teh film tht i ' m tlaking baout isnt
` a nght at yhe roxbury
, ' noe ofthe thsoe offereings based onthe a saterday ngiht live skit
. wayne
adn garth
, theese twpo are nto
. rether
, we meet doug
anbd steve butabi
( yhe actors ' names are nto worth mentioning
)
, twpo eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions inthe life seem tothe be finding a way tothe git inot tjhe hottest niht club inspite hte city
, tyhe roxbury
. driving infront theri dad ' s bmw
annd donning metalic disco suits right outloud ofthe miami vice
, tehy try tothe bribe tje bouncer tothe git inot thte club
.
` hve yuo met my firend washington
anbd his firend roosevelt
, ' htey confidently sday as tehy pul outloud sparce pocket chanage
. theri second greatest ambition seems tothe be oozing outloud as many silly pik
- uv lines as isnt humanly possibile iin order tothe strat a conversation whith a girl
(
` let me see thta lable
. jsut as i throught
- made infact heaven
, ' syas oen ofthe tyhe brothers
)
.
annd
, liek hte losers thyat htey are
, htey fail tothe dont eather fo much ofthe teh film
.
howver
, as fate woudl ahev it
, an accidentall meeting iwth
` wqat
- ever
- happenned
- tothe ' richard grieco gives them tjhe all
- importamt ticket tothe git inspite
. thier sad lives tkae onthe a wohle newyorker direction
. tehy mkea an imporatnt contact wtih yhe club owner who believes taht theese twpo brothers hve uncanny insight inot thge club scene
.
adn tehy are mistaken as rich swingers by twpo voluptuous young womens
.
bu theri newfound popularaty doesnt nto imbaress thier father
, who hasnt otehr plans fo them
. yhe unfortunate thign baout htis film isnt tath thsi isnt a oney
- joke movei
,
adn yhe brothers are yhe joke
. actulaly
, ther ' s baout 10 mintues worth ofthe tolerable stuf
. alas
, too long forthe tv
anbd way too short forthe a feature
- lenght film
. thus
, ther jstu isn ' t enought material tothe sustain thte 83
- minute movei
. htere ' s noone plot tothe be foudn
adn everyting thgat theese twpo dont seem tothe culminate inspite an opprotunity tothe excecute thier trademark move ofthe snapping thier heads infact unison tothe hte funky beated ofthe haddaway ' s europop song
, waht isnt lveo
. i wass amazed tht none ofthe tghe twpo sufferred fomr whiplash
. tothe tkae uv moreso film tiome
, htere isnt a subplot involving hte daugher ofthe tjhe buisnessman enxt doorjam who whants tothe marry doug
. thsi creates nto onyl friction beetwen thte brothers
,
bu theri unlikey pairing iwll alsot agiatte audiance munbers as well
. she ' s educated
annd a forebearing witch
. meanwhile
, doug isnt a complet losr
. how doed theese twpo ever git toghether
? i supose thgat if i cin ever figure outloud tghe answer tothe tht question
, i ' ll hve figured outloud why i desided tothe go
anbd see htis movei
. if ytou ' re looking forthe enteratinment
, yuo won ' t fidn it at hte roxbury
.
