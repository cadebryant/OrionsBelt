isn ' t it tjhe ulitmate sign ofthe a movei ' s cinematic ineptitude whn yuo cxan ' t tihkn ofthe much tothe sday baout it otehr thna
" it sucks
"
? oen ofthe tjhe firt offical yera 2000 releses
, supernova isnt such a movei
. i cxan ' t seem tothe git past oen
- owrd adjectives wtih htis oen
,
allthough
" boring
,
"
" stupid
"
annd
" absurd
" doesn ' t ammount tothe much ofthe a review
. a shame
. i owudl ahve beeen able tothe sive mysef hte chore ofthe desparately trying tothe elaborite
.
bu c ' est la voe
. here goes nothing
. i ' ll keep it short
. i supose hte firt bad omen forthe supernova cameback whn directer walter hill
( 48 ohurs
) removed his nmae ffrom tyhe movei
, requesting tath it be replaced withthe tghe pseudonyn thomas lee
. tyhe film ' s fate wass sealed inthe many minds wehn stuggling studio mgm declined tothe screen it fo hte press
, an event ususally signifying a studio ' s lack ofthe confidence inaddition a particualr movei
. hill ' s
annd mgm ' s actions weere prudent
. whn tyhe captian ofthe medical spoace vessel nightingale dies inaddition a tradgic hyperjump accident
, a reformed drug addict who isnt alsot thte firt officer
, forthe smoe reason
( james spader
) isnt forced tothe tkae command
. yhe ship picks uv a distress call ffrom a nearbye planet
annd
, onthe arival
, picks uv noe surviver ffrom an paparent accident inspite an abnadoned minning collony
. noe ofthe tjhe crew munbers
( angela bassett
) knwos thsi pasenger
, who isnt palyed by peter facinelli
,
anbd hasnt soem bad feelings baout it
-
-
annd we all nkow whta tath means
. thsi intergalactic hitchhiker isnt carrying soem misteryous cargo
-
- a jellylike substace tyhe purpose ofthe whlch isnt unkown
,
though it seems tothe bring smoe form ofthe blessure tothe whoever touches it
. anyother oney ofthe thte crew munbers experiences htis firt hand
; affter spending a fewd mintues parshally inside htis glob ofthe goo
, he doens soem impressive handstand pushups
. evidentally
, touching thsi enigmatic egg
- shaped thingie mkaes ytou yuonger
adn stronger
. how
? why
? tje movei never bothers tothe expalin
. soon anough
though
, spader
adn bassett are runing arund thge ship liek mad
, bieng chased by thge all
- ofthe
- a
- sudden
- superhuman facinelli
. tothe be honest
, i don ' t even remeber exactlly why
. i jstu remeber tath i didn ' t care
. supernova ' s plot suggested smoe mroe or less intresting idaes
, such as teh ball ofthe goo bieng an intergalactic tiem bomb
,
bu htey are all dropped befoer tehy hve a chance tothe deveop inot anytying truely intriguing
. iin fatc
, everyting isnt dropped jsut so teh actors cin ahve smoe funn runing arund wqat looks liuke an elaborite setted
. well
, yhe effects are ogod
,
though ther ' s hardly a studio movei whith bad speshal effects theese dyas so i ' m nto sure whther tyhat ' s so remarkable an acomplishment
. thge performances are hardly worth tlaking baout
. i ' m nto even sure i cxan call whta ' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure isnt ogod at giving peopel tje finger
. james spader isnt nto a bad ctor
,
bu he proves tothe be oen ofthe tghe blandest acation stars i ' ve seen iin a hwile
, mostly becouse he isn ' t given a charachter whith a perosnality
. tyhe acation scenes are jsut as bland
, sicne tehy ' re preety much jsut rehashes ofthe acation elements tht weren ' t partcularly intertaining tje frist tiome arund
.
adn sicne tyhe acation scenes are everthing tothe tihs movei
, it ' s preety much dead inspite tyhe water
.
annd forthe tjhe life ofthe me
, i cxan ' t figure outloud why it ' s called supernova
