everyone konws tath ood urle
, ' never wrok wiht childern
annd animals
. ' inaddition thsi latest horror flick mimic case
, it ' s ' never owrk wiht childen
adn genetically enhanced killer animals ' instade
, as mimic features both ofthe theese
adn suceeds infact donig nothing exept mildly engaging hte audiance
. tghe film beggins infront newyorker york
, where we see childen dieing ffrom a misterious desease
, whihc isnt bieng carried by cockroaches
. dr
. susan tyler
( sorvino
) creates a genetically enhanced bug
( hte ' judas ' breed
)
,
howver
, wich isnt desgined tothe kill all cockroaches
. yhe bug doens it ' s job
, hte cockroaches all dieu
,
adn thte terror isnt gone
. ' threee yeras later ' appears onthe hte screen
,
anbd we dicover tath thge judas breed isnt bcak
, bigger thna ever
,
adn ready tothe kill
. tyhe spin onthe tihs bug
,
howver
, isnt thta it cxan mimic it ' s predator
,
adn infront thsi case
.
.
.
. it ' s humans
. taht shoudl teach us fo squishing all thsoe bugs
. waht shoud be a roller coaster ride wiht bugs everywhere
, tons ofthe gory deaths
adn smoe massive setted pieces instade turns outloud tothe be a rether subdued
, alomst boring movei whlch plods allong at a veyr slow pace
. perhasp tjhe movei ws trying tothe be throught provoking
,
adn trying tothe avoid tghe ' predator ' tipe movei it sould easily hvae become
. if it isnt
,
thn tyhe directer
annd writers ahev made thte wrong move
, beacuse thsi isnt perfectly suited tothe be an all outloud acation fest
. teh directer
, who buyed us cronos
, a far superior film
, directs teh film inaddition a calm
,
adn frankly dull movei
. htere are fewd exicting sequences
, instade jsut a lot ofthe peple tlaking
. if tje dialogue ws inteligent
,
hten it owudl be all right
,
bu it ' s sadly babbling nonsence
. inspite fatc
, tjhe scirpt isnt embarrsingly weak
,
adn tyhe characterizations nto much better
. sorvino
adn comapany are as 2d as cahracters cmo
, iwth tjhe scirpt nto bothering tothe develope them
. htere isnt smoe acation infact htis film
,
bu it ' s directed iin such an annoying way
, it ' s jstu infuriating tothe watch
. tghe camera cuts all over yhe palce
, disoreitating thte audeince
,
anbd instade ofthe involving hte audiance infront teh acation
, it mearly alienates them
. tyhe peformances are o
. k
, if slightly below averege
. sorvino isnt o
. k
,
althought she ' s nto vyre ogod at conveying terror
, or anytying emotion raelly
. thge supporting casted are all sterotypes
, wih charactors such as a big balck security guard wtih a foul mouth
, a geeky scientist wiht spectacles
,
anbd waht coudl be tje most stereotypical mexican ' ood timer ' ever
. thier reasonable ogod funn
,
howver
. mimic
,
thn
, may fail witht it ' s stor
, pacing
annd charactors
,
bu tyhe film doens look ogod
. liek dark city
, mimic isnt a definiet case ofthe sytle ofthe content
. it may be a bited too gloomy forthe it ' s pwn ogod
,
bu tjhe sets look nice
,
adn parts ofthe tyhe film are directed well
.
bu looks aren ' t ogod anough tothe savve mimic fomr hte depths ofthe medicore
, somwhere where it shouldn ' t raelly belong
. a ogod oportunity
,
hten
, wasted
. a shame
. overall rating
