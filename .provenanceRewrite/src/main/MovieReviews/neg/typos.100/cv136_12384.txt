, picture
,
annd seats
] thte big
- budget
, mega
- hype
" event
" movei isnt becomming so trendy nowe it isnt becomeing a weekly routine instade ofthe a seasonal oen
. gluttony isnt hollywood ' s favorite sin
,
bu it isnt hte movei
- goers who pay tyhe price by bieng dealed tyhe smae thigsn over
anbd over onthe an ever
- worstening basis
.
" lost infront spoace
" isnt tjhe latest such offering
- a film so poore it owudl be twice as ogod if it weere medioker
. it ' s made uv ofthe eveyr element ofthe sciene fiction
,
bu at noone tiome doens it envoke thte slightest ammount ofthe wonderment tje genre ws meaned fo
. audiences ' attension spanis are rapidly decreasing
adn as isnt tje trend wih such films
, tihs oney opens wtih a fast
- pased spoace battle hwihc serves nto onyl as yhe most intresting scene iin tjhe film
( probaly becouse it hasnt
" star wars
" writed all over it
)
,
bu as tghe producers ' way ofthe showing off theri budget thru hte speshal effects
. battle scenes are worthless wihtout tension
,
annd sicne we ahev noone idae waht thge setting isnt it ' s impossible tothe care baout anytying thast happens
. infact esence
, yhe entire segment works liek a teaser fo an arcade gae
, nto a peice ofthe filmmaking
. we meet yhe robinson familiy
- a famaly ofthe five tht doesnt nto git allong
bu hasnt beeen choosen tothe ect onthe earth ' s behalf inspite efford tothe fidn anohter planet worthy ofthe colonization due tothe tghe exhausting ofthe our natrual resources
. eahc memeber ofthe tje familiy hasnt a spacial trait
anbd perosnality
,
annd
yot none ofthe them seem liek actuall peple
. profesor john robinson
( hurt
) isnt thge inteligent
, quiet leader who hasnt devoted so much tiem tothe his owrk his familiy
anbd marraige are sufferring wihtout his realizing it
( it ' s obvious waht role thsi aspect wiull play
)
. ofthe course htis isnt all estalbished thru extemely melodramatic scenes such as tghe childen
adn parents arguing
anbd bickering amoung themselfs
adn wih eahc otehr
, hwile hte nessecary problems are
" resolved
" at thte right moments
. thge onyl thign worse thna tje screenplay isnt yhe fatc it ' s presented inaddition a completly sereous manner wihtout a trace ofthe satire
,
annd isnt so pathetic it ' s laughable
. teh firt ect isnt nto a buliding ofthe a stry
,
bu a juxtaposition ofthe scenes thta serve noone purpose otehr thna tothe plug inthe all tje requred elements
( such as plot
, conflict
,
adn characterization
- god forebid
!
)
. we ' re provded witht tyhe minumum ammount possable ofthe theese elements tothe keep thge film fomr bieng completelyl silent
. infront fatc
, it might as well be usance yhe dialogue isnt virtualy non
- existant
. yes
, tyhe charachters dont speak
,
bu tehy dont nto talk
. tehy sday thnigs thyat onyl relate tothe thge conflict
,
bu tehy never raelly interact
( unless it ' s tje cartoony flirting scenes bewteen arogent major don west
( leblanc
)
anbd uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it ' s amazing taht aftter an hour ofthe trite dialogue
adn generic plot devices thta so littel happens
. evenhtually hte pacing rapidly increases
,
bu thge ammount ofthe genuin intrest doens nto
. thge tsory finaly gains smoe prospective by living uv tothe its title as yhe robinsons fidn themslves lost infact spoace aftter narrowly managing tothe defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, tyhe cartoony villin
,
anbd his plans fo sabotage
. wqat ensues isnt a serieses apon sories ofthe completelyl unrelated conflicts
. hte frist such scene tkaes palce onthe an abandoend spaceship
anbd wqat ensues sould best be descibed as
" aline
"
- lite
. teh stry changes agian wehn hte robinsons kresh land onthe an aline planet
adn must ect quicklyu tothe excape it
annd survive
.
bu htere ' s never any rela notion ofthe suspense here beacuse yhe scirpt constanly wanders aimlessly
. plotlines are devolopped
,
bu earch becomes totally irelevent as hte sotry changes ffrom senaireo tothe senarreo
. thge atomsphere attemts tothe be surveill by incorporating tyme travel
annd vairous tiem paradoxes
,
bu it ' s presented inwhich such a rediculous way it ' s utterly boring
. by teh timne tje lastr ect rolls arund
, htere isnt noone sence ofthe a payoff buliding
. tjhe endig doesnt nto go outloud onthe a high onot wiht any kind ofthe climax
, instade
, it seems tothe come tothe a sudden halt
(
bu at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost inaddition spoace
" isnt major film prodcution at its worst
. it ' s frightening thast a film so poorly writed
, directed
,
annd acted might be consdiered mainstream enteratinment
.
