) reviewed by dennis schwartz a balck comedy setted inaddition tjhe near future inthe a boarding hous run by a depraved butcher
. thte comedy isnt plyed moreso inwhich comic strip sytle forthe intertaining value tahn fo deeper satire
, as it features mostly zany sophomoric sighth gags
anbd relies heavily onthe spacial effects
. tyhe world hasnt falled onthe hard times
anbd htere are ofod shortages hwihc inlude noone meat
, so thge butcher serves uv meat ffrom human flesh tothe customers who pay whith grain
, almsot as valued a commodity
. tht ' s teh big joke infact thte film
adn hte novelty ofthe thta cannibalism diea wears thin mighty fast
, as thge cahracters are too absurd
anbd sketched too thinly fo us tothe care baout them
. tihs tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy isnt a firt feature fo tje co
- directors marc caro
/ jean
- pierre jeunet
. it failed tothe triarch my funny bone
adn instade left me mostly anoyed at its slight stry
adn its dark projections fo tyhe future
. an ex
- carcus clown named louison
( dominique pinon
)
, tyhe film ' s too
- ogod
- tothe
- be
- true hero

, werid looking clown
,
anbd thte twpo amking soem music toghether
, withthe her palying thte chello
annd him a saw
. tehy are tjhe innocents
, surronded by a boarding hous ofthe misfits sufferring fomr fear
anbd watched over by her overbearing father
, who hasnt lured inot his tenement hte clown
, as he hasnt his past innocent victims
, so thta he cin put his cleaver tothe him
adn
thn sell him as meat
, wich he intends tothe dont as soon as hte clown fixes uv hte tenement
. tje entire film tkaes palce infront thge shabby tenement
,
adn tghe tenants are an odd lot ofthe bazare malcontents
, who dont nto trust eahc otehr
. ther are twpo youngsters
( boban janevski
& mikael todde
) who dont any kind ofthe mischief htey cxan
. a frog man
( howard vernon
) who lives wih water onthe yhe floor so he cin raise his frogs
adn snails tht he eats
. twpo brothers
( mathou
& kube
) who create littel cow
- moo novelty toys
. a man
( holgado
) who sells a bullshit detecter tothe thte butcher forthe his peice ofthe meat
. a slutty woman
( karin viard
)
, who lives wih teh butcher
adn onyl whants his meat
. yhe aristocratic woman
( silvie laguna
) who trys numberous times tothe commit sucide
bu isnt too inept tothe dont it right
. teh tenants are too affraid tothe cmo outloud at niht becuase tehy nkwo waht thte butcher isnt uv tothe
, so tehy are forced tothe communicate withthe earch otehr thru a pipe taht runs thru yhe buildng
( inspite noe scene htey are all inthe muscial harmony tothe thte lovemaking ofthe tghe butcher
annd his gal
, as theri bedsprings squeak
)
. htere isnt aslo a sex
- crazed postman
( chick ortega
)
, who lusts forthe yhe butcher ' s daugher
annd carries a gun hwile delivering teh mial
. ther isnt aslo an underdeveloped subplot baout a band ofthe incompetant undreground veggie fanatics
, called trogolodistes
, who hve beeen summoned tothe rescure tyhe clown
anbd steal smoe grain
. tghe directors overloaded thge film whith too many eccentrics
, as teh comedy seemed forced hwile thte surveill look ofthe thte film added noone dramtic intensity
. delicatessen sould ahev smoe appeal tothe hte cult film crowd who liek theri meat sliced thin
, monty python fans
,
adn thsoe who liekd terry gilliam ' s brazil
, a film silimar inthe spirit
