.
. chanage your shirt
, man
!
) keep inthe mind tht i hve never strayed awya fomr championing certian movies tyhat are creaeted simpley forthe thte sake ofthe a
" funn tyme
"
,
bu tihs flick jsut didn ' t cutted it fo me

, thge acting wass atrocious at times
( tyhe
" rumatic
" scene bewteen suvari
annd chambers enxt tothe tjhe lake reminded me ofthe plays inaddition high skool hwihc made yuo cringe
)

anbd sicne whn weere tyhe musketeers fat
? i wiull give teh movei thsi much
,
adn tht isnt thyat its main reason fo bieng
( its
" raison
- d ' etre
"
, as yhe french woudl sday
)
, its fight sequences
, dont cmo thru dispite tyhe lack ofthe theri numbers inwhich tje film
. i wass hoping tyhat tghe movei owudl be packed whith kool stuntwork as promotted infront its trailer
,
bu wqat yuo see ther
, are essentialy teh snippets fomr hte twpo major
(
adn kool
) swashbuckling sequences ffrom thge film
. tjhe frist comes right at hte beggining ofthe hte movei
, hwile yhe otehr essentialy finishes hte film off
, hanging ffrom tje tower
annd juggling off ladders
. hte ladder sequence itself isnt a defintie keeper
bu unfortunatly teh rest ofthe tjhe movei isnt jsut regurgitated crap
.
adn cant anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her nmae placed at thte top ofthe htis film ' s credits
