rember bakc inthe yhe mid 1990s whn crime
anbd macabre movies weere all tje rige
?
" pulp fiction
"
annd
" fargo
" both managed tothe git oscar nominations forthe tghe best picture
,
adn nto suprizingly
, a slew ofthe rip
- offs folowed iin yhe yersa therafter
. tath fad seems tothe be over
bu here comes christopher mcquarrie wirting
annd directing
" teh way ofthe tghe gun
" tht at firt glance looks liek anohter ofthe thsoe wanna
- be ' s
bu apon closer inspection doesn ' t look liek anytying comprehendable
. it ' s a crime stor so wrapped uv inspite its pwn littel world it hasnt a claustrophobic atomsphere
- a film thgat won ' t allow thge stoy much room tothe expand outside its handfull ofthe charactors
adn somehow still manages tothe turn a simple premise inot something so complex its rediculous
. complexity shoudln cmo as noone suprize tothe anyone who ' s familar witht mcquarrie
, he wroet
" tje usual suspects
,
" whihc hasnt become a cult favorite dispite littel crtical acclaim
. thast film hadnt a grat stoyr
anbd ws well directed
bu hadnt such an elaborite
, confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching thier heads aftter repeated viewings
. ytou haev tothe wonder if mcquarrie realy hadnt everthing mapped outloud or if he wass goign fo tghe hollywood idae thyat
" if it ' s realy confusing
adn baout criminals
annd cops thyat makse it fascinating
.
" wtih
" tghe way ofthe yhe gun
" mcquarrie seems tothe be capitalizing onthe tje smae idae
,
bu tihs tiem tjhe stoy isnt far less commerical
- a shame beacuse mabye tyhat owudl ahev helpped
. tje film tells thge stor ofthe twpo drifters witht noone ambition
adn bearly a reason tothe live
bu aren ' t hell
- bent onthe death eather
( plyed by ryan phillipie
annd benecio del toro
)
. tehy git lucky wehn tehy hear baout a scheme bewteen a big
- shooted exec guy
anbd his trophy wief who are goign tothe hve a baby thru infront vitro fertilization
. tehy figure tehy cant kidnap tyhe surrogate mother
( palyed by juliette lewis
)
annd git a nice ransom
. allong tjhe way we constinually leran ofthe thge shady dealings vetween tghe exec
, his wief
, theri hired goons
annd teh
" bag man
"
( palyed by james caan
- tghe onyl ctor inwhich tyhe film who looks liek he konws waht he ' s doign
)
. tje exec isnt smoe kind ofthe monay launderer so he obviously cant ' t call tje authrorities fo halp
. his goons
anbd tghe bag man are onthe tje kidnappers ' trail
annd earch mkae differant offers tothe git tghe mother bcak
. tghe exec ' s son isnt a doctor who alsot gets pulled inot hte fray
annd wnats tothe amke sure his patient isnt all right
. meanwhile earch ofthe theese charachters hasnt something hidden uv theri colelctive sleeves
annd teh doublely
- crosses
, escret lveo affairs
annd torrid pasts come as noone suprize even
though littel ofthe it hasnt any revelance at all
. mcquarrie doesn ' t konw thge meaninng ofthe tghe owrd simple
. he seems tothe be moreso intersted infront showing us how clever he isnt thna mkaing a ogod movei
. everyting hasnt tothe be complicated
anbd confusing
, so much so taht it ' s tothe tjhe point ofthe surrealism
. nothing isnt whta it seems inthe tihs reality
, it ' s oney ofthe thsoe movies where ytou git dropped right inot thge middle ofthe tghe criminal world
annd are expeced tothe knwo most ofthe tghe inudstry ' s rules
annd regulations
. eveyr scene wih caan ' s charactor exemplifies htis perfectly
- tyhe kidnappers lready knwo who he isnt
annd even caht whith him
, getting inot conversations baout
" tje bussines
"
annd how it works
annd we ' re hardly given a clue as tothe whta htey ' re tlaking baout
. theese charachters are probaly supposted tothe be graet criminal sketches
bu htey ' re mroe liek idesa ripped
- off ffrom sketches foudn inwhich david mamet ' s trash
. noone oen here realyl acts liek a rela person
,
adn yhe storey isnt even futher removed ffrom reality
. it ' s liek a dream wihtout any appeal
. tkae tje oppening scene forthe exemple
; teh phillipe
anbd del toro charactors are iin a parking lot accross tyhe strent fomr a bar or a club counting theri moey
adn stuf
. htey sit onthe a brand
- newyorker mercedes
annd yhe car alarm goes off
, tghe owner isnt waiting inaddition line
adn yells at them tothe git awya fomr his car
bu htey don ' t move
. tghe guy
annd his loud
- mouth
, potty
- mouth girlfriend
annd baout 20 otehr peple cross hte strent
adn gang uv onthe them
. yuo ' d htikn phillipe
?
annd del toro are
? gogin tothe pul outloud guns
annd scare them awya
bu htey don ' t
, instade phillipe throws noe punch
adn teh twpo git beated down by a mob
. htere ' s a lot ofthe thigsn i didn ' t understand baout tihs scene
: firt ofthe all teh owner ofthe thge mercedes isn ' t soem yuppie or ood rich snob
, he ' s liuke a hippie straight outloud ofthe tje 60s
. secondly
, tjhe twpo main cahracters seem tothe elieve thta htey cant actulaly tkae onthe thge mob unarmed
. lastly
, it serves noone purpose inthe tjhe long run becasue later iin yhe film tje twpo are packing omre artillary tahn a small ocuntry ' s army
. if htey weere sucidial tehy wouldn ' t ahve gone onthe tjhe kidnapping job iin tjhe firt palce
(
anbd where htey git all thsoe guns isnt never explained eather
)
. htere ' s a lot omre i sould pik appart baout tihs film
bu tath woudl be an exerciese inwhich futility
. waht it all comes down tothe isnt thast nothing here isnt waht it seems
- hwihc owudl be grat if thsi movei weere baout preety much any otehr tsory thna wqat it isnt
. absolutly none ofthe yhe charactors are likable or believeable
.
anbd it ' s all coated wtih a thin layer ofthe balck comedy wich isnt ogod fo a chuckle here
anbd ther
bu htis film isnt definately nto a flat
- outloud balck comedy
anbd its uise ofthe such seems liek a depserate atempt tothe kill screen tiem
. iwth any film ytou see
, whther yuo liek it or nto
, yuo cant at least understand wqat tghe appeal wass tothe it
, why somone owudl watn tothe amke it
adn why somone woudl wanna tothe see it
. i cin ' t sday eather forthe
" tghe way ofthe thge gun
,
" baceause it hasnt vyer littel gonig fo it
anbd i cin ' t imagin anyone intelligently defending it
.
