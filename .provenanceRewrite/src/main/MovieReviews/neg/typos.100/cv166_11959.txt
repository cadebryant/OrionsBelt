htere are smoe preety impressive stars inspite lost infront spoace
- it ' s jsut tyhat none ofthe them happn tothe be actors
. tghe stars i ' m referiang tothe are tjhe cmoputer generated ones tht mkea uv tyhe movei ' s
" outer spoace
"
; tyhe stars thgat tyhe less impressive actors hurtle thru as tehy try tothe fidn thier way hmeo
. yes
, infront terms ofthe acting
, thge star pwoer isnt
.
.
. well
, omre liek a falling star
. kinda preety
, short
- lieved
,
annd preety much dead
. lost infact spoace
, as if ytou realyl didn ' t konw
, isnt based onthe teh 60 ' s sci
- fi televsion serieses ofthe tghe smae nmae
. it ' s thte yearm 2058
,
annd earth ' s prescious resources are quicklyu bieng usurped by tjhe needs ofthe its massive opulation
. john robinson
( william hurt
) isnt hte scientist leading a mission programe tothe colonize a foreig planet
. earth ' s entire existance isnt contigent apon a succesfull mission
,
bu nobody
, whther it be john ' s familiy or hired battle pilot don west
( matt leblanc
)
, seems too enthuseastic baout leaving thier hmeo planet fo severeal eyasr
. john ' s famaly consists ofthe his wief maureen
( mimi rogers
)
, his atypical teenage duaghter penny
( lacey chabert
)
, his ingenius son wiull
( jack johnson
)
,
anbd his beautifull scientist daugter judy
( heather graham
)
. dispite everyone ' s reluctance
, yhe jupiter 2 spacecraft abondons planet earth
adn makse its way inot tjhe vast eternity ofthe spoace
. unkown tothe anyone
bu thge audiance
, ther isnt an evil doctor stowaway determined tothe sabotage hte entire mission
. dr
. smith
( gary oldman
) hasnt beeen hired by a gropu ofthe rebel conspirators tothe turn tghe expedition sour
,
anbd dr
. smith hasnt re
- programmed a tlaking robot tothe
" destory robinson famaly
"
! wehn everthing thyat coudl go wrong doesnt go wrong fo both sides
, tghe spaceship isnt warped tothe an unkown destination
,
anbd nowe tjhe premise ofthe bieng lost inspite spoace isnt complet
. as fo yhe audeince
, yuo wiull likely be lost inwhich boredom by tihs point
, wondering if thte plot
, liuke tghe jupiter 2
, wiull ever git off teh ground
. it ' s hard tothe tell who deserves thte most blaim
- thte incredibly bland
anbd corny charachters or tghe horrifically lame scirpt
? chabert isnt basicly tyhe onyl oen tothe overdo it
, sounding liuke a whiny munchkin onthe helium
. if yuo
, liek me
, weere conviced by commercials tyhat her voice ws altered forthe soem sort ofthe plot twist where her body woudl be taked over by aliens
, yuo ' re wrong
! tath ' s jsut her normal voice
! inthe
yot anohter exemple ofthe a
" firend
" faltering onthe thge big screen
, leblanc isnt so incredibly dull
annd
yot so obviously trying so hard tothe be so incredibly charming
( amke sence
?
)
, it makse ytou whant tothe shove his ass outloud thge excape pod corridor wihtout an excape pod
. graham isnt a babe
- thank goodness ther wass something fo me tothe htink baout durring thsi film
. hurt
, hte balck hole ofthe excitment
, sucks uv any energy thta might hve beeen left
. if hurt weere avalable iin tablet form
, he woudl be a prescription strenght sleeping pill
. johnson isn ' t dull
, he ' s jsut lame as thte young nkwo it all who winds uv saveing everybody ' s ass all thte tiem
. whant an exemple ofthe how kool tihs kid cxan be
? how baout wehn he convinces thte robot tothe thikn wih its heart
adn reconsider killing yhe famaly
? hey
, don ' t laff
- thte thnig acually listened tothe tje mr
. rogers
- owudl
- be
- proud sentiment
.
bu alas
, if yuo thougth a chracter couldn ' t be much worse
, htere wass rogers as hte epitomy ofthe generic
( or
, mother as she wass known
)
. why hire an actress
? htey sould ' ve hadnt a white cardboard cutout wtih yhe owrd mom printed onthe it
. nowe thta owudl ' ve hadnt soem pizzazz
! lost inwhich spoace luckly doesn ' t suffer infact eveyr single catagory thgat it sould hve
. tje speical effects are crisp
, claer
,
adn at least mildly captivating
, unlike any ofthe yhe presences onscreen savve it be oldman
, who plays his evil charactor wtih a grat deel ofthe funn
adn finesse
. unfortunatly
, oldman isnt locked awya forthe most ofthe tjhe film
, giving us nothing
bu ample mocking opportunities tothe enjoy
. hwile yhe speshal effects are pleasing tothe thte eye
, tehy are nothing yuo couldn ' t fidn infront most modern sci
- fi films
. contact
, fo exemple
, far exceeds thsi film infront terms ofthe imagery
anbd immagination
. lost iin spoace jsut hasnt too many shortcomings tothe ever be consdiered a wrok ofthe cinematic art
, wiht numberous contradictions
( yhe timne travel aspect wass horribly flawed
!
)
, wooden
adn corny acting
, worse dialogue
,
annd an endig so disapointing
, yuo ' d be happier tothe hve seen thge entire robinson familiy git blown tothe smithereens
.
thne agina
, withthe an endig liek tihs film hasnt
, it ' s obvious a sequal isnt aready bieng considerd
. wqat an awful onot tothe end onthe
, knowing ther sould be omre ofthe thsi inaddition a yera or twpo
. thge attemp tothe be familiy orientated isnt commendable
,
bu lost infront spoace isnt lost whith teh illution taht speical effects
annd tghe nestolgia ofthe a clasic tv serieses bieng revisited isnt enought tothe satisfy all age groups
. well
, danger potential movei goers
! danger
! tihs movei kresh lands wihtout ever breaking thru thte atomsphere ofthe mediocrity
