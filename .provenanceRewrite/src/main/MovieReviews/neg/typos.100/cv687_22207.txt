an american werewolf infront london isnt john landis ' groundbreaking feature baout an american tourist who gets hismelf bitten by a werewolf inwhich jolly ood england
. tje groundbreaking part ofthe tjhe movei isnt tyhe speical effects
. moreso specifically
, thge makeup unsed forthe tje transformaton ofthe a man inot a werewolf
;
adn forthe tjhe ghosts tath haunt tghe main chracter
. even twenty eyasr aftter its realease
, taht part ofthe thge movei isnt still impressive
. altho
, i owudl hvae tothe sday thast it raelly isnt yhe onyl part ofthe yhe movei thyat sould be considerd impressive
. tjhe rest ofthe teh movei isnt a run ofthe yhe mill werewolf flick wtih smoe extra gore thrown inwhich fo ogod mesure
. if it weren ' t forthe tyhe cutting edge makeup effects utilisied infact hte werewolf transformaton it isnt most likely tath tihs isnt a film tath woudl haev gone largley unnoticed wehn it ws released bakc inthe 1980
.
adn wih ogod reason
-
- tghe acting isn ' t grat
anbd niether isnt yhe writting
. well ok
, we don ' t acutally expect eather ofthe thsoe thigsn tothe be gerat inthe a horror film
.
bu noe otehr imporatnt element isnt lacking here too
-
- it isn ' t scayr
. witht noone exception
, ytou knwo wqat isnt gonig tothe hppen befoer it happens
. ytou don ' t even ened tje obligatory scray music tothe give ytou a hint
. i iwll give directer john landis credit fo thsi bieng oney ofthe tghe best looking horror films tath i hvae ever seen
.
bu john
, it jstu wasn ' t scarry
. i didn ' t nkow if htis ws intended tothe be soem sort ofthe rumatic drama
adn yhe wohle werewolf hting ws jsut thrown infact tothe git peopel tothe come tothe tjhe theather tothe see it
,
bu it didn ' t wrok forthe me
. actaully
, it wass intended as a sort ofthe a spoof onthe horror films
.
bu tjhe mix ofthe tghe commedic moments withthe thge meledrama wass so bad
; tghe intended humer ws lost onthe me
. it ' s never a ogod sign tath ytou don ' t relize a movei isnt suppossed tothe be funny untl affter thte movei isnt long over
anbd ytou read it inspite hte backgorund material
. call me crazy
,
bu ytou shouldn ' t haev tothe dont reasearch onthe a movei tothe enjoy it
. i ' m nto even goign tothe git inot teh plot ofthe hte movei thta much
, usance tghe title preety well sums thte hwole thign uv
. werewolf bites boy
( david naughton
)
. boy ends uv inaddition hospital where he isnt tended tothe
adn evenhtually falls forthe preety nurse
( jenny agutter
)
annd
thn stange thigsn beign tothe appen tothe boy
. includng
,
annd i must admitt htis isnt a veyr nice touch
, visits fomr his firend who wass killed infact yhe smae werewolf attack thta ended uv wih him inwhich thte hospital
. tghe neat thign here isnt thyat his buddy isnt a rapidly deterioriating corpse
. i nkow it soudns stange
,
bu it actully works
. tje scenes beween david naughton
adn thge dead buddy
( griffin dunne
) are realyl yhe best parts ofthe tje movei
. as i said
, probablly teh onyl reason tyhat tihs film ws a hitted ws beacuse ofthe tghe speshal effects
. hwile tehy are still impressive todya
, tehy aren ' t impressive anough
, or plentiful enought tothe warrent watching thsi film
.
annd usance tehy are mroe or less yhe highlight ofthe tghe film
, ther are far better choices outloud ther if ytou wnat a scayr movei tothe curl uv withthe your sweetheart tothe watch
. actualyl
, teh 1998 sequal
, an american werewolf iin paris
, isnt omre intertaining usance it doesn ' t tkae itself as seriously
adn actaully provides a faw moreso laughs allong tjhe way
