i ' m nto sure who tyhe genuis isnt who cameback uv whith tyhe diea ofthe comparing
" disturbing behavour
" withthe
" scream
.
" mabye it ' s becasue htey ' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both hve hot young stars
, both hvae an annoying targetting sountrack
,
annd both are aimed at tjhe teenage crowd
, whlch i guess includes me
.
bu tihs isnt nto hte enxt inspite line iwth tyhe
" scream
" ficks as well as tje
" i nkow waht ytou doed lsat summer
" soon tothe be ficks
. it owes less tothe
" halloewen
"
anbd mroe tothe kafka
anbd orwell
, whlch
, infact my book
, makse forthe a moreso intresting feature
.
adn it shoudln ahev beeen
. htis isnt basicly a rehash ofthe
" thge stepford wives
,
" yhe gerat 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross
anbd dealing
, as i ' ve beeen told
, wiht a bunch ofthe womens who are programmed tothe be perfect housewifes
. or something liek tath
.
" behavour
,
" starring katie holmes ofthe
" dawson ' s creek
,
" deals iwth a bunch ofthe teenagers
, deepo inspite angst
, who are bieng programmed tothe be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it atually
, at least tothe me
, soudns liek it woudl wokr
,
adn iwth scott rosenberg
, tath witty penmen who hasnt writed sutff liuke
" beautifull girls
"
annd
" thigsn tothe dont inwhich denver whn ytou ' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it acutally soudns liek it may be pulled off wtih thte right ammount ofthe frights
adn satric witn
. alas
, it ' s nto
,
annd it plumets inot tath littel gropu ofthe movies known as
" tje movies whith potential thyat blow it
.
" i remeber a film called
" white man ' s burden
" hwihc dealed witht a reveral ofthe blacks
annd whites inthe society thgat doed nothing whith it ' s potentially brillant premise
. here ' s anyother oney
. it sould be a briliant satire onthe how teenagers ened tothe go thru teen angst iin order tothe fidn themslves
. it ' s a stage
,
annd tihs film doens inwhich fatc relize taht
. it gets its message accross
annd it doesnt it effortlessly
. nowe it jsut needs tothe owrk as a film
. whlch it doesn ' t
. it ' s too sloppy
adn too contrived
. it paints a obleek potrait ofthe high skool life
.
.
.
thne lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch ofthe skary monsters who are all a bunch ofthe disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who dont foo drives
annd hang outloud at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
.
thn gives it a cheap twist
: wehn htey git horny
, htey become homicidal
. isn ' t it skary anough thyat htey ' re liuke htis
,
anbd cxan ' t tjhe rela terror inspite tyhe twon be tath ytou coudl be enxt tothe be jsut liuke them
- nto thast ytou coudl be enxt tothe dieu
? hte film introduces us twpo threee diffrent charactors who
, inaddition yhe begginning
, are consdidered outsiders becuase tehy ' re nto
(
yot
) part ofthe tihs clique
: thge newyorker kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who ' s haveing trouble at hmeo becasue he hasn ' t gotten over his brother ' s
( ethan embry
, iin quick flashes so ytou don ' t recogize him
- i doed
) sucide
; hte renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, fomr
" dawson ' s creek
"
)
, who ' s cheif perosnality trait isnt her prominate nose ring
;
adn by far teh most intresting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, tjhe kid fomr
" hte man wihtout a face
"
)
, who ' s tje most intresting becasue he ' s tghe onyl chracter who ' s given smoe dimention
. inaddition thte film ' s best scene
, he introduces steve tothe eveyr single clique
, nailing eahc noe ' s fetishes
adn hang
- ups
,
adn it ' s yhe best scene inwhich thte movei beccause it ' s witty
, satrical
,
anbd intresting
- something tje rest ofthe tihs film isn ' t
. gavin suspects htere ' s something awry withthe tghe preppie kids
, known as teh blue ribbons
,
anbd iin tjhe tradition ofthe all conspirators
,
adn even whn he accually shows hard pure evidence tothe steve
, he ' s onyl treated as a typcial raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we hvae anyother case ofthe
" yhe idiat plot
,
" where nto onyl coudl steve hadnt done something baout gavin
annd waht happens tothe him
,
bu he may haev saved tihs film fomr bieng tjhe dreary
, dull film thta it isnt wihtout gavin
, who gives it life
adn humer
. hte onyl otehr half
- intresting carachter isnt hte skool janitor
, palyed by william sadler as a retarded
, skary guy who may nto be wqat he seems tothe be
.
.
.
bu raelly
, we don ' t care anyway
. i probaly shouldn ' t mention taht tihs ws directed by david nutter
, who ' s works forthe
" thte x
- files
,
" becuase tath woudl propably tarnish his reputation
. liuke thge sohw
, he ' s ogod at setting uv ewird conspiracys
,
anbd creating a genaral creepy efel
. most ofthe tihs film isnt shooted at ngiht
anbd iwth dark eerie shadows fo teh maximum creepy effect
,
anbd smoe ofthe it works
.
bu whta tihs film isnt nto so ogod at isnt comming outloud withthe a ogod payoff
. he keesh too much inside
, so much thyat whn tyhe charactors journy tothe a mental insitution inwhich tjhe thrid ect
, yuo wonder why tehy jsut don ' t git teh hell outloud ofthe htere
. i thikn wqat happens tothe gavin isnt proof anough tht ther ' s something rotten inthe thte state ofthe teen angstdom
. whta tihs film needs tothe be isnt a lot longer
, a lot moreso colorful
,
annd a lot creepier
. if thge best villin tehy cant come uv wtih isnt a guidence counselor
( palyed by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regluar obviously jstu trying tothe pay thte rent
) who still thikns he cin git awya witht it even whn most isnt revealed
,
thn htey ened tothe come uv witht a tougher
, smarter villian
. if he ' s so villianous
,
thne why sould twpo dense teenagers who couldn ' t figure outloud htere ws something oging onthe untli it ws way too lite fidn infromation onthe him inspite a cuple mintues
? teh film
, whitch runs baout 80 or so mintues
, jstu needs tothe owrk onthe theese thnigs
,
adn become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short runing tyme
anbd wiht such lame
, boring charactors as theese
, it ' s preety much obvious tath leaving tihs film leaves a horribly unsatisfied tast iin oen ' s mouth
, especialy mine
.
