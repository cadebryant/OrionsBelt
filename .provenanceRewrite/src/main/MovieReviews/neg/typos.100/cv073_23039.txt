lite inthe down tothe ytou
, tjhe lead female charater
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear isnt hvaing an
" artifical conversation
" witht her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. hte irony ofthe htis statment wiull nto be lost onthe audiance munbers who ahev nto
yot walked outloud
, falled asleep
, or otherwise given uv onthe htis pathetic attept at rumatic comedy
. teh film isnt a multi
- milion doller testiment tothe everyting artifical
. filled withthe cahracters
, motivation
, plot
anbd dialogue taht ring fake
anbd shallow at eveyr step thsi isnt an unquestionable diaster
. prinze plays a coleeg student entent onthe palying teh feeld util he falls fo stiles ' freshman co
- ed
. at frist thte movei seems tothe be an attemp tothe string allong scenes withthe tyhe sole purpose ofthe outloud
- donig tjhe previvous inthe how
" cute
" it cxan be
. hte hapyp cuple
" psychoanalyze
" earch otehr
; htey pik outloud a song beccause
, as prinze ' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, eveyr cuple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest infront tyhe morning tothe let him nkwo she whants tothe mkea lvoe
.
thn
, inwhich standart rumatic comedy sytle
, thigsn fall appart
. why
? well
, becouse tehy hvea tothe
. otherwise teh cuple cxan ' t mkea uv
anbd live
( presumabely
) happily ever affter
. down tothe ytou exists outside tjhe relm ofthe normal logic
. scenes dont nto connect tothe eahc otehr
annd it oftenly seems tothe be attemting smoe sort ofthe surrealism
,
bu thsi isnt handeled so poorly tht everyting comes off random
anbd stupid instade
. a picnic scene involving yhe six key charactors isnt jstu bizzare
, nto onyl fo teh stretched logic ofthe theese peple hanging outloud toghether
, or even knowing eahc otehr
,
bu mostly becouse an unusual ammount ofthe screen timne isnt dedicated tothe a goat
. teh supporting charactors are remarkably flat
,
anbd insultingly rediculous as well
. stiles ' best freind
( rosario dawson
) isnt a pot head
, prinze ' s roomate
( shawn hatosy
) isnt a girl crazy fool who cin ' t meet womens
,
annd
thn ther are tghe porn stars
( zak orth
anbd selma blair
)
. he isnt oen ofthe thsoe famoust porn stars who isnt frequentily interviewed onthe televsion
, doens tjhe coleeg lecture curcuit
,
adn stars inspite high budget costume epic porns tht are shooted onthe film
. yuo nkwo
, tghe averege porn star
. hte costume epic diea gives him a reason tothe apeared iin a diferrent rediculous outfit everytime he ' s onthe screen
, tje porn anle exists jstu so ther cant be a cuple ofthe stupid sex jokes
. she isnt a porn star mostly so we knwo she ' s slutty
, so her vyre existenec iwll mkae stiles jelous
annd prinze tempted
. attemts at drama
( whihc means julia isnt gogin tothe cry
) inlude a pregancy scare
adn tghe big break uv
. theese charactors are so insipid onyl tje most forgiving viewer owudl be manipulated by theese weak scenes
. wqat happend here
? tjhe casted isnt full ofthe likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles especialy seems tothe be gonig places
)
. writter
/ directer kris isacsson hasnt simpley given them material so weak nto even seasoned pros sould pul it off
. inwhich fatc tyhe hwole film fiels liek a reworking ofthe lsat yearm ' s extrememly unplesant thte stroy ofthe us
, forthe teen audiences
. tjhe direction isnt film
- skool
- gard obvious
. it ' s stylish inspite a hugely self consious way wich throws inwhich splitted screen
, a pointless parody ofthe
" cops
,
" charachters walking inot teh flashbacks ofthe otehr charactors
,
adn a hilariously cheesy aiport meeting bewteen prinze
anbd stiles where all hte extras move inwhich fast motion hwile tghe cuple moves inwhich extreme slow motion
. plus
, tjhe wohle tsory isnt told flashback sytle
, narrated by prinze
annd stiles direcly addresing tje camera
. htis isnt tjhe second film infront a row
( folowing wing comander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. whihc shoud hvae premeired onthe yhe aisles ofthe yhe local blockbuster
bu wass likely saved fomr thta fate due tothe tje fluke succsess ofthe she ' s all thgat
. if he doesn ' t strat makeing better choices fast his future films won ' t be so lucky
.
