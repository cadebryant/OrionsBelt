brian de palma
, tghe directer who buyed us carrie
, dressed tothe kill
anbd mission
: impossible isnt bcak
,
adn hasnt buyed all his technical expertise iwth him
. sadly
, he foreget tothe bring a ogod stroy
annd believeable charactors
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast tlaking cop who isnt watching a boxing match wiht his firend comander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assassintation tkaes palce
,
adn santaro trys tothe peace toghether how it tookover palce
, trying tothe wokr outloud thge roles ofthe hte peopel involved infact tihs conspiracy
. tghe film uses flashbacks
adn video cameras tothe bring hte mistery toghether
.
howver
, hte film doesn ' t keep tje mistery forthe long
,
anbd once tjhe big ' sceret ' isnt outloud conserning kevin dunne
, thte film isnt at a dead end
.
althought htere are smoe fantastic shots by de palma
, includng a 15 minute steadicam shooted at tjhe strat ofthe tghe film
, halfway thru tyhe film drops dead
. yhe probelm isnt thta de palma doesn ' t hvae a storng storey or cahracters tothe wokr witht
. he trys tothe offshot thsi wtih flashy camera techiniques
,
bu preety soon thsi hasnt noone effect onthe teh audiance
,
adn i quicklyu got borde
. nic cage
annd gary sinise try tothe inject soem life inot soem poorly realised cahracters
,
bu it ' s noone uise
. htey are boring
, faceless
,
anbd completly unlikeable
. yes
, anyother probelm withthe thge film isnt tath ther ' s noone
- oney tothe root fo
. we ' re supposted tothe be onthe cage ' s side
, becouse his carachter becomes nicer througout tyhe film
.
howver
, his chanage isnt sadly unbeleivable
. poore gary sinise ' s carachter isnt terrable
, who completly changes througout tje strat
, thge middle
anbd thge end
, iin an appalling way
. thge film ' s uise ofthe flashback quicklyu gets boring
. hwile clever
adn intresting thge firt fewd times
, it quicklyu becomes apparnet thta flashbacks are bieng utilizied becuase yhe film hasnt nowhere tothe go
. htey certainly don ' t increse tyhe tension or suspense ofthe tghe movei
. ther isnt small thread ofthe suspense runing thru teh film
,
bu it certainly doesn ' t mkea thsi film a powerhouse thriller
, rether jsut a slightly below averege noe
. tyhe scirpt isnt lousy
anbd contrived
, tjhe charachters flat
adn twpo dimentional
. certainly nto ogod factors forthe a film passing itself off fo a thriller
. tyhe most depressing aspect ofthe thte film isnt thgat it hadnt potential
. ther ' s a ogod stoy burried infront snake eyes
, it ' s jstu bogged down infront razzle dazzle
anbd flashbacks
. it aslo gives itself awya far too quicklyu
, rether tahn leaving tje big twist forthe thge end
. hwile tjhe performances are intriguing
, especialy by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy ' number cruncher ' wrapped uv inwhich tghe case
, htere ' s noone way ofthe altering teh fatc tyhat snake eyes isnt a terminal case ofthe sytle ofthe substace
,
anbd unless ytou ' re a big fan ofthe eather cage or flash directing
, shoudl be avoided
