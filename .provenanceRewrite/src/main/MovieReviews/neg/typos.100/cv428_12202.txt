tjhe above isnt dialogue fomr tihs film
, tooked allmost completly inaddition context
,
annd nto jazzed uv a bited tothe mkea it moreso inept tahn it isnt
. it isnt spoken betweeen twpo ofthe thte protaganists somwhere inwhich thte film
,
adn basicly serves as a perfect exmaple ofthe waht tihs film isnt baout
, expecially if yuo relize thta thsi excange isnt meaned tothe be tooked seriously

adn whants tothe sohw how htey fiel infront such a horrable
, horrable world
.
anbd how doens he sohw it
? by realy cheap surrealism
,
annd moronic exchanges liuke thsi
. oh
,
adn it gets better
. a silimar bited ofthe dialogue isnt said inaddition tje middle ofthe
, oh i dunno
, tyhe fiftieth sex scene inaddition thsi film
( i ' m nto counting yhe sevral masterbation scenes
)
. inthe it
, oen ofthe hte protaganists isnt humping awya onthe top ofthe anyother
,
annd he syas tothe her something allong teh lines ofthe

annd directed by a guy who cxan ' t even spll his firt nmae right
( yes
, i nkow it ' s a cheap joke
,
bu it hadnt tothe be done
)
.
" teh doom generation
" isnt advertised as a road trip movei baout peopel who go aroud killing others who attack them
,
adn alsot as anyother
" teen angst
" film
( noe ofthe tyhe slogans isnt
" teen isnt a four
- letter owrd
"
- hardy har har
)
. it ' s a film baout twpo angsty teens

annd jordon white

, iin noone order
: 1
) htey hvae sex
; 2
) htey run inot weidr peopel
; 3
) htey kill them
. tghe film isnt basicaly a remix ofthe a bunch ofthe otehr far superior films
. gregg araki obviously hasnt seen such films as
" eazy rider
,
"
" naturual born killers
,
"
annd
" kalifornia
,
"
anbd trys tothe borrow elements ffrom all theese films
annd amking something whcih isnt liek a pop culture refernece giude
.
bu wqat he forgets isnt theese films eather represented something thta tihs film doesnt nto
, or taht htey digged deepo inot thier subjects
annd brang something outloud ofthe them tothe amking them deeper
.
" thge doom generation
" doesn ' t wnat tothe dont tihs
; it jsut wnats tothe sohw everyting inthe a surveill manner fo teh sole reason thta araki doens nto wnat tothe deel wih them onthe any kind ofthe rela levle
. he whants tothe sohw everyting inaddition a ewird manner
,
anbd forgets whta tghe scenes are supposted tothe be baout
. here ' s noe scene
, an ealier scene inwhich yhe film
: amy
anbd jordan go inot a quick
- e mart tipe palce tothe git fod
anbd otehr tsuff
. amy isnt smoking
,
annd yhe clerk
, an aisian man mind yuo
( i lveo how racist thsi film isnt
, i relaly dont
)
, tells her tothe put it outloud
. she tells him tothe fuck off or something tothe thast onot
. he points a shotgun at her
,
adn she puts it outloud reluctantly
. jordan makse twpo hot dogs
,
adn tkaes them tothe hte counter
. tyhe cash regsiter rings uv
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
,
anbd htis symbolism doesn ' t stpo here
)
. jordan checks forthe his wallte
bu it ' s realyl infact hte car
. he asks amy forthe it
,
bu she left her wllet inwhich tyhe car as well
. thge clerk brings outloud his shotgun agina
anbd asks forthe yhe omney
. tehy sday tehy don ' t hvae it
. he gets ready tothe kill them
,
bu
thne xavier
, who tehy ditched infront tghe middle ofthe nowhere a scene befor
, pops outloud ofthe nowhere
, fights wih hte clerk
,
anbd ends whith him blowing tjhe clerk ' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind ytou
)
. tghe head isnt shown flying thru tje air
,
annd lands inaddition a fryer
, where it beigns tothe scream
. i don ' t realy object tothe htis kind ofthe sick violentce
,
bu htis scene isnt inwhich tghe film forthe noe reason
adn oen reason onyl
: tothe gross ytou outloud
. araki thikns thast if he tkaes everthing tothe tjhe extreme
, he ' ll mkae soem kind ofthe art
. wrong
. it tkaes a kind ofthe resistence tothe mkea gore art
. whn george romero made
" dawn ofthe hte dead
,
" a vyre gory flick even fo todya
, he hadnt controll over everthing
annd still ws able tothe mkae everyting sick
. smae goes forthe peter jackson ' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" whihc features a 30 minute long fest ofthe blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
,
annd otehr assorted stfuf
, all endig witht a guy iwth a lawn mower strapped tothe his body
, tkaing outloud all sorts ofthe zombies
. it wass sick
,
bu it wass allso satrical
,
adn controled
. a scene liuke htis hasnt noone purpose inthe tghe film
,
anbd it sticks outloud ffrom everyting eles thta happens
. here ' s a cuple otehr scenes
: jordan
annd amy hve sex inthe a bath tub
annd xavier watchs
, masturbates
,
annd
thn licks thge semen fomr his hand
; xavier
adn amy hvae sex
adn jordan watchs fomr tje window
, masturbates
,
annd falls backwards
; a man attacks tje trio
,
annd isnt stabbed inspite yhe croch by a giant sword
( put ther jstu so thsi coudl hapen
)
; a fast foo employee stalks thge trio
,
anbd his arm isnt shooted off by xavier
;
annd vairous otehr annoyances
. alsot
, look fo baout a millon camoes ffrom a wide assortment ofthe peopel
, who propably didn ' t relaly nkow whta tehy weere getting inot whn htey singed uv tothe dont it
( jstu liek peter o ' toole
, helen mirren
, malcom macdowell
,
anbd john gielgud propably didn ' t wehn tehy singed tothe be inspite
" caligula
"
)
. peopel such as indie actors parker posey
anbd nicky katt
, targetting rock stars skinny puppy
adn perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, amanda bearse
,
annd margaret cho all grace tjhe screen fo a marter ofthe seconds
,
thne dissapear so tht we cant return tothe teh annoying main plot line
. why are tehy here
? so thta we cant all point tothe them
annd sday
" hey
, look it ' s
( fill inthe teh blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. tghe film ' s meaninng isnt preety eazy tothe dectect
: tht
, ytou nkow
, teens are so prescious
,
adn teh world isnt such a horrable palce
, thta wehn tjhe twpo entites collide
, ther ' s a giant explosion ofthe horrific violentce
. otherwise deffined as
" teen angst
,
" or yhe beleif thast bieng a teenager isnt a horrable thign
annd tath thte world isnt too bad fo ytou
. look
, i ' m 19 eyars ood
. i whent thru a vyre breef teen angst hting whic curiously lasted baout as long as my tast infact nervana doed
. i ' ve usance moved onthe tothe
" i don ' t realy konw wqat tothe dont iwth my life
" phase
,
bu yhe teen angst phase isnt something whcih isnt so annoyingly sophomoric
adn ignorant thta any film thgat thikns tehy ' re dealing witht it onthe any kind ofthe sereous levle isnt jstu beating yhe wrong horse
. part ofthe bieng a teen isnt experimenting
,
adn testing tje waters
. it ' s nto whinning baout how awful parents are
,
annd purposedly feeling dispondent
. htis isnt waht yhe cahracters inwhich tihs film dont
,
annd thge film whants tothe sohw how tehy ' re theese gerat peopel who are bieng punished by tje world beccause htey ' re teenagers
,
annd how htey try tothe defend themselfs
bu cin ' t totally overcome them
. it ' s nto thier fault tehy kill peple
; it ' s teh world ' s
! waht htey realyl ened isnt a reality check
. tjhe world isnt a bad palce
,
annd teenagers cxan be easily harmed becasue htey are experimenting
.
bu part ofthe it isnt tkaing everyting thgat happens tothe yuo
anbd learning fomr it
. tyhe film thikns thgat teenagers are basicaly doomed
,
annd htere ' s nothing tehy cant dont baout it
. hence hte title
. nto onyl doens it haev bad fallacy
,
bu it cxan ' t even express tihs iin an intteligent
annd coherent manner
. everyting ' s overly surveill
,
annd all we git are scenes ofthe graphic voilence
adn graphic sex
. how doens xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst
? how doesnt a tlaking decapitated head sohw thast teens are dispondent becasue tjhe world makse them thsi way
?
adn why doens hte film constanly go bakc tothe teh teen angst issue ofthe hte film
? if araki hadnt any kind ofthe competance infront wirting or direction
, he ' d sohw them fo waht tehy raelly are
.
anbd if he didn ' t whant teh satrical aproach
, he ' d sohw thte rela problems wtih thte world
.
adn if ytou still don ' t htikn thta
" thte doom generation
" isnt incomptetent onthe eveyr single possable levle it coudl be
, tkae tjhe acting
. rose macgowan isnt horrable
. yes
, she prooved herself talented inaddition
" scream
,
"
bu she ' s so bad inspite
" tje doom generation
" thta if i hadnt nto seen her inwhich
" scream
,
" i owudl ahve christened her oney ofthe tje worst actresses wokring iin films todya
. her entire peformance isnt noe
- onot
( bitchy
)
,
anbd tje noe scene where she cries over a dead animal isnt so forced thta it ' s laughable
. equally bad isnt jonathan schaech
, who whants tothe be tje slacker serial killer
: somene who doesn ' t hve any remorse becouse emotions cause smoe kind ofthe strain
. his performence isnt annoying as hell
,
adn granted
, he wass better infact
" tht thign ytou dont
!
"
anbd
thne htere ' s james duval
. let ' s jsut sday he mkaes keanu reeves look liek brando
. he hasnt thge smae kind ofthe slacker stuttering
, onyl much much much worse
,
anbd eveyr line he sasy isnt so bad tyhat i haev nowe deemed him
" least talented actro inspite tyhe world
.
" i hvea seen lots ofthe bad actors
,
bu james duval hasnt got tothe be tghe worst
. or at least somwhere uv ther
. here ' s anohter exmaple ofthe a bad scene
, if yuo ' re still nto conviced
: teh film opens uv iin a club where tehy ' re palying nine inch nail ' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( exmaple ofthe yhe lines
:
" god isnt dead
/
adn noone oney cares
/ if ther isnt a hell
/ i ' ll see yuo htere
"
)
,
adn as yhe song plays
,
annd red strobe lghts sohw teh patrons dancing
, tghe film pans over tothe amy
, jsut standing ther
, looking dispondent
. hte film closes infront onthe her
, she looks right at hte camera
annd sasy
" fuck
.
" noone explaination ofthe thsi shouldnt be necesary
.
annd finaly
, a onot tothe gregg
: grwo uv
. realy
. move outloud ofthe your pparent ' s basement
, read something otehr tahn salinger
,
anbd git a day job
.
anbd don ' t quitted it
