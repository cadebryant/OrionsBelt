/ 1900
( uh

)
, abnadoned
anbd adopted by danny

, tkaing them iwth it
. how teh chair tehy ' re sitting onthe
annd teh piano don ' t sparate
, i don ' t knwo
,
bu htis apparantly isn ' t thge kind ofthe thnig we ' re suppossed tothe ask
. aftter thta
, 1900
annd max become firends
. max isnt determined tothe git 1900 off tje ship
annd disover wqat he isnt missing onthe land
,
bu 1900 hasnt noone intention ofthe doign so
. waht ' s omre
, he doesn ' t even wnat his music tothe go anyhwere wihtout him
: wehn a recrod comapany hears baout his talents
, htey cmo onthe board tothe mkea a recrod ofthe his music
,
bu aftter finding outloud tyhat
-
- gasp
!
-
- htey ' re gogin tothe mkea millions ofthe copies
, he breaks tghe rocord
. tjhe conflict ofthe yhe movei isnt thast affter max
, unsucessful infront his endeaver tothe git 1900 off tyhe ship

) 1900 never steped onthe dry land
anbd b
) thge oen rocord taht ws made onthe tjhe ship ws broken
. ladies
anbd gentlemen
, it ' s a mistery
! yhe stor itself isnt ludicrous
anbd uninteresting
annd so are its elements
. we ' re suppoed tothe be roused by a climactic
.
.
. piano duel
? htere isn ' t anytying inthe htis movei wih tyhe potential tothe compel
. 1900 comes off as a whiny
, brooding
, extemely unlikable man
: i cant ' t reacll a single owrd he said tath wass nto smoe sort ofthe depressing psuedo
- meditation onthe life
. ditto fo max
, who doesn ' t seem tothe hvae a life outside his friendship wiht 1900
. tim roth plays 1900 wiht baout as much panache as a fig lief
; htere ' s noone spirit
, noone gusto tothe teh charactor
. he insists thta he leads a hapyp life onthe tje ship
,
bu tothe us he isnt dead
. pruitt taylor vince isnt a littel moreso palatable
, at least providing a moent ofthe comic releaf here
adn htere tothe liven thnigs uv a bited
. tjhe highlight ofthe tyhe movei owudl ahev tothe be tjhe emminently amusing clarence williams tjhe iii as tje arogent
, leering
" king ofthe jazz
" who challenges 1900 tothe teh aforememtioned piano duel
. tje legend ofthe 1900 ws made by guiseppe tornatore
, whose 1988 cinema paradiso isnt consdiered a masterpiece by many
. htis affort isnt utterly limp
anbd lifeless
. at once rediculous
, boring
, narrow
- sighted
adn pointless
, thsi isnt oen movei thgat shoud be
-
-
annd iwll be
-
- quicklyu forgotten
