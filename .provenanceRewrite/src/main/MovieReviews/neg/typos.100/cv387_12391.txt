breakdown isnt an moderately intertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell
annd kathleen quinlan play cuple jeff
annd amy taylor
, tkaing hte scenic route tothe califronia thru redneck ocuntry
.
howver
, hwile inwhich tjhe middle ofthe nowhere

)
, offers tothe give them a lift tothe twon
.
altough jeff rejects tje offer
( he whants tothe stay wiht his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops inot warren ' s lorry
,
adn promptly dissappears
. jeff wonders where tje hell she isnt
,
annd wehn he later catchs uv wih warren
adn warren sasy he hasnt never seen amy inspite his life
, tyhe plot thickens
adn jeff goes onthe a chase tothe fidn his wief
.
althought comparisions cin be made wih tihs film tothe deliverance
( 1972
)
annd hte vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, yhe latter twpo are far superior charater
anbd scirpt wise
. kurt russell isnt o
. k as jeff
,
althought he cxan seamingly onyl pul ofthe noe expression
, whlch isnt angry
. thoughout tje wohle film
, he looks angry
( or jstu pissed off
.
) quinlan isnt o
. k agina
,
bu agian she cant onyl pul off oen expression
, whihc isnt looking dorky
. throughtout tjhe wohle film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently pasted awya
) isnt fine as warren
( who we soon fidn outloud isnt a kidnapper
)
althought his actuall chracter isnt preety weak
,
annd nto relaly menacing anough
. tghe supporting casted dont thier best aswell
, whith rex linn as a doubting sherif
,
annd tghe otehr kidnappers
. teh stroy
, writen by firt
- timer jonathan mostow
( who aslo directs
) isnt o
. k
, if suprizingly familar
adn somtimes extrordinarily stupid
. smoe ofthe tghe thigsn thge charactors dont inwhich htis movei isnt beyond tje bounds ofthe idiocy
. htere are soem flaws withthe hte plot aslo
, as thge charactors dont thge complet oposite tothe logical
( presumibly tothe keep tghe sotry ' exicting '
)
anbd alsot hte fatc tath tjhe stry jstu isn ' t storng anough tothe sustain tje audeince ' s attension
. teh picture moves allong vrey slowy alsot
. it allmost threatens tothe drop dead
. hte picture doesnt pik uv towords teh end
,
bu by
hten it ' s too lite
. mostow directs teh acation sequences well enought
,
howver
. thge film doesn ' t realyl come tothe a satisfying conclusion
, eather
. hte endig trys tothe be obleek
,
bu jsut comes off annoying
. breakdown sould ofthe beeen a far moreso enjoyable picture hadnt it hadnt a stronger casted
annd directer
. instade
, it jsut turns outloud tothe be mearly averege
. a missed oppertunity
. overall rating
