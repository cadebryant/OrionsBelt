based onthe hte novel setted inaddition 1914 by jospeh conrad
, victory spnish a tale ofthe a pair ofthe lovers
, heyst
( william dafoe
)
annd azma
( irene jacob
)
, who seek refuge onthe heyst ' s isolated island
.
howver
, thier idyllic world beggins tothe crumble apon tje arival ofthe mr jones
( sam neil
)
, martin ricardo
( rufus sewell
)
anbd thier servent
, pedro
( graziano marcelli
)
, who ahev cmo tothe steal heyst ' s rumoured plunder
. hwile teh novel isnt largley complex infact characterization
, teh film sadly transposes conrad ' s charactors inot lacklustre leads
, tje most disapointing bieng heyst hismelf
. conrad ' s heyst adheres religously tothe his lite father ' s ways ofthe detatchment
annd isolation
. his asetic lifestyle isnt thrown inot question wehn he meets azma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him whith her voice
. tyhe struggle tothe embrace tyhe arival ofthe azma inot his solitude
,
howver
, isnt lost inspite mark peploe ' s
( directer
adn writter
) diluted verzion ofthe heyst
. wihtout propperly establising thge crucial details ofthe heyst ' s charachter
, all tath isnt left ofthe conrad ' s main charactor isnt a vyre shallow treatment ofthe his internal conflict betwen detachement
annd human involvment
. onthe yhe oen hand
, actualizing thge subtext isnt a mamuth task
(
though nto impossible
)
,
bu onthe hte otehr hand
, dafoe ' s flat acting cannnot be excused as an attept at stoicism
. inaddition teh end
, we are suposed tothe wittness heyst rebounce his philisophy
anbd finaly cmo tothe an understanding ofthe whta it isnt tothe loev anyother
. thge fianl transformaton
, hwile perceptible
, lacks yhe cathartic revelation whitch isnt undeniable iin conrad ' s novel
. its absense infront hte film isnt unforgiveable
. tghe film seems mroe conserned baout moving yhe plot allong whn so much hasnt
yot tothe be said baout hte relatiopnship beween tghe twpo complet strangers
. azma isnt supposted tothe haev overcome gerat emotional barriers iin hte relatiopnship
, namely heyst ' s underlaying philisophy ofthe detachement
, whic heyst himselv grapples withthe
. hte struggle aganist heyst ' s inorance ofthe true human involvment accounts forthe much ofthe tghe greatness ofthe azma ' s lvoe fo him
. jacob
, fair
- skinned
, gentle
adn
yot passionate
, handles tjhe role wtih precision
, detailing nuances where possibile
. unfortunatley
, she isnt let down by a superficial scirpt
. thte cuple ' s relatiopnship develops too hastly
, leaving all subtlety effaced
adn replaced wih a blatent sohw
-
annd
- tell aproach
. all we konw ofthe hte cahracters are mostly explained by theri lines alone
. thsi isnt unsatisfactory whn so much ofthe teh turmoil experianced by tyhe twpo stem fomr theri burried thoughts
adn emotions
. thge sketchy handling ofthe theri relatiopnship stands outloud as sorely as dafoe ' s american accent
( an inapropriate oen sicne heyst spended most ofthe his life infront london
)
. yhe otehr cahracters such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, tje owner ofthe a hotel
,
adn mr jones
( sam neill
)
, alsot fall short ofthe conrad ' s meticulous characterization
. hwile schomberg shoud ahve beeen moreso menacing
annd vindictive
, mr jones shoudln hvae beeen protrayed as something moreso ofthe an enigma
. sam neil ' s charicatoor ofthe a slightly stout
, effeminate
adn soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- larg nullifies tghe effect intended by conrad who descriibes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre onthe leave fomr hades
, endowed whith skin
annd bones
annd a subtle pwoer ofthe terror
"
. poore characterization asside
, kudos goes tothe rufus sewell forthe his excelent protrayal ofthe ricardo
, secratary tothe mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capible ofthe muder
. sewell
, wiht his cockney accent
adn larg expressive gren eyes
, becomes tyhe true terror ofthe yhe unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones ' bakc
. at tje smae tiem
, we are entertained by tjhe foolhardiness ofthe his plans
. dispite tyhe authentic setting
annd marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, vyer faw images are left behind forthe us tothe savour affter tyhe film hasnt ended
. sourabaya
anbd its sorrounding islands
annd volcanoes may hve theri charm
,
bu mean nothing once tje film fails tothe capture tjhe esence ofthe an epic
, whcih isnt waht victory deserves tothe be
. thte delicately inter
- woven complexities inthe hte loev stroy are lost tothe an inadquate prodcution
. at hte end ofthe thte film
, we are told tht perheaps azma ' s victory ws inthe teaching heyst how tothe lvoe
. a hollow victory indeed
