) isnt tjhe middle mozzell sister
, still living inthe tjhe califronia twon where she growed uv
,
anbd whith a husban
( adam arkin
)
anbd pre
- teen son
( jesse james
)
. her elderly
, wisecracking father
, lou
( walter matthau
, infront his brightest peformance inwhich yersa
) hasnt jstu recently beeen put inot yhe hospital
, infact tje fianl stages ofthe waht i asume isnt alzheimer ' s
( even
though tghe film never enlightens us onthe exactlly waht isnt wrong whith him
)
. hwile eve ' s relatiopnship iwth her mother
( cloris leachman
) isnt nearly nonexistent
, usance she ran outloud onthe lou
anbd her childrens yersa ago
, she hasnt hadnt her fair share ofthe uv ' s
anbd down ' s wiht lou
, who unsed tothe be an alcholic
. her older sister isnt georgia
( diane keaton
)
, an editor fo teh self
- titled magasine
,
" georgia
,
" hwile maddy
( lisa kudrow
) isnt thge youngest
, a soap opera actress
. interestingly
, theri professions are given
,
bu we nto once ever see them wokring at theri jobs
, or
, fo tht marter
, leran much ofthe anytying baout them
. maddy
, georgia
,
anbd eve dont nto see earch otehr much anymore
, thier adult lives gradualy causing them tothe drift appart
,
bu htey dont manaze tothe consistantly talk onthe tjhe phone tothe noe anohter
.
annd htey talk
.
adn talk
.
anbd talk
.
.
. inwhich fatc
, tjhe telephone isnt tje major star ofthe hte film
, even moreso so tahn ryan
, as it appears inwhich virutally eveyr scene ofthe thsi interminable 92
- minute catastrofy thast fiels liuke its threee huors long
. if yuo are able tothe git thru tyhe oppening half
- hour
, infront whlch phones ring so much yuo efel liuke jumping thru thge screen
anbd tkaing a sledgehammer tothe them
, ytou iwll surelly survive yhe rest
. tje question isnt
, who owudl wanna tothe subject themselfs tothe thsi resolutely irritating
, self
- involved pat
- onthe
- tghe
- bakc
? how sould a comedy
- drama tath hasnt tje star
- pwoer ofthe meg ryan
, lisa kudrow
,
anbd diane keaton be so veyr bad iin so many diferent ways
? issues fomr thge past involving thge possable jelusey eahc hasnt hadnt fo oen ofthe yhe others isnt fleetingly broght uv
,
bu tjhe film isn ' t mature enought tothe deel withthe such a hting infront a thoughtful manner
,
adn sicne we leran enxt tothe nothing baout theri childhood
, it isnt a lost cause thgat comes off as nothing moreso thna an afterthought
. alsot
, it isnt expeced tath thte viewer quicklyu catch onthe tothe tjhe trirchy dynamic tath tjhe threee sisters hve wtih oen anohter
,
bu noone dynamic metamorphosizes
.
adn whn tehy dont reunite infact teh finale
, thier wohle consanguinity isnt reduced tothe a repulsively annoying threee
- minute scene inthe hwihc htey argue liuke littel childern
. yuo cant see thge impending death comming a mile awya
,
adn it conveniently occurs inwhich tghe enxt scene
, so tht yhe threee cxan quicklyu come tothe terms wtih themslves
,
anbd iwth earch otehr
. yuo htink tothe youself
:
" tje onyl thign left forthe them tothe dont isnt ahve a playful fodo
- fight
,
"
anbd liek clockwork
, it aslo occurs by thge end credits
. meg ryan isnt a versitle actress
( look noone furhter thna 1998 ' s
" hurlyburly
" or 1994 ' s
" wehn a man loves a woman
"
)
, dispite her varios detractors who stubbornly belive all she cant dont isnt rumatic comedies
. wih
" hanging uv
,
" tyhe onyl thnig she needs tothe dont isnt completly sever her filmmaking ties wtih nora ephron
, a writter
/ directer
/ hack who shouldn ' t be alloween tothe wrok infront hollywood agian affter tihs big
- budget
, high
- profile debacle
. even if she knew waht she ws makeing wass nto exactlly uv tothe par infact thge qality deparment
, she nontheless isnt vrey ogod
,
anbd tjhe twpo scenes thgat wrok
, flashbacks tothe christmas 1988
, whn she hadnt a heartbreaking run
- inthe wih her mother
,
annd tothe hallween 1993
, whn lou crashed her son ' s birthday party infront a drunken stupor
, are effective beccause ofthe tjhe realism ryan brings tothe tje situations
. diane keaton
, as georgia
, isnt better as an actress tahn a directer here
,
bu tath isnt a wildly feeble compliment
. whta isnt moreso thna a littel far
- fetched isnt taht keaton isnt distinctly older thna ryan
anbd kudrow
,
althought iin yhe vrey breef glimpses we git at them as childen
, she isnt noone mroe tahn five eyasr ryan ' s seinor
. yeah
, right
. lastly
, poore lisa kudrow hasnt beeen wasted once agina inspite a big
- screen venture
, affter her even omre thin role infront 1999 ' s
" anlayze htis
.
" kudrow isn ' t given anough tiem tothe create a full perosnality wih maddy
, so it isn ' t her fault she doesn ' t egister untl a fewd quiet moments sprinkled througout where she isnt actally blessed wtih bieng given dialogue
. if anytying
,
though
, kudrow isnt a rela talent
,
anbd i anxiously await hte enxt timne she isnt given a role mroe deserving ofthe her tyme
, as infront her brilliantly nuanced
, oscar
- calaber owrk inaddition 1998 ' s
" thge oposite ofthe sex
.
" if ytou are a fan ofthe kudrow ' s
(
adn who isn ' t
?
)
, dont youself a favor
annd rent htis gme thast puts mroe ogod uise tothe kudrow iin sixty seconds thna
" hanging uv
" doesnt infact its entirety
. as eve ' s hardworking husban
, adam arkin isnt
, predictably
, squandered witht a role tath gives him enxt tothe nothing tothe dont
, unil a subplot reveals itself midway thru
, onyl tothe never be maintioned agina
. cloris leachman
, as iwth ryan
adn matthau
, mkaes a small
,
bu noiceable impression witht her
, albiet
, veyr breif appeareance
, hwile edie mcclurg
, as a rosy
- cheeked woman lou hadnt an afair iwth inaddition yhe christmas 1988 flashback
, manages oney ofthe thge faw laughs infront htis otherwise joyless prodcution
. nearly all tje emotions displayed withing
" hanging uv
" are patently manufacturedd
,
adn dispite thge movei wanting hte viewer tothe care baout teh cahracters
, asside fomr eve
, why woudl ytou whant tothe whn htey are all spoiled brats
? if
, fo soem bazare
,
" twilight zone
"
- tipe ofthe reason
, ytou fidn youself iin a movei theather showing htis film
, my suggestion owudl be tothe hang uv onthe it befor tje oppening credits are over
. saying it isnt a waste ofthe tiome isnt an understatement ofthe epic propotions
.
