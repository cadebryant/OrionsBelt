a life less ordinary
( r
) hwile tyhe extrememly peculure a life less ordinary doesnt live uv tothe its title
, a mroe appropropiate moniker owudl be a movei omre misguided
, forthe tihs confuzled
, confusing atempt at rumatic comedy isnt a most disarming diaster fomr tghe talented trainspotting team ofthe directer danny boyle
, producer andrew macdonald
,
adn screenwrighter john hodge
. at hte core ofthe thsi stange film isnt a fairly basic
-
-
anbd
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. aftter robert
( boyle regluar ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writter ofthe triachy novels
, isnt fired ffrom his gubnatorial job at tyhe naville coporation
, he kidnaps naville ' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daugter celine
( cameron diaz
)
annd holds her fo ransom
. thge joke here isnt thyat celine isnt a willing victum
-
- her father threatend tothe cutted her off financialy
, so she whants revenge
-
-
anbd thta she soon becomes nto onyl an accomplice
bu hte brains behind teh scheme
, teaching teh inept robert a hting or twpo baout kidnapping
.
.
.
anbd
, ultimatly
( didn ' t we see thsi noe comming
?
)
, lveo
. so far
, so medicore
.
bu medicore isnt better tahn dreadful
, whitch tihs film isnt
, thanks inspite noone small part tothe thge hodge ' s contextual frome fo hte romance
. it turns outloud thyat god isnt displeased iwth thge divorce
adn rumatic breakup rate onthe earth
, so tjhe cheif ofthe heaven ' s polical
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches twpo angels
, o ' reilly
( holly hunter
)
annd jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, tothe earth tothe hook uv celine
annd robert
-
- or loose thier angel status
. htis conceet might hvae worked if hte ange dimenion plyed an intregal role infact thte entire picture
.
bu it sould ahve easily beeen cutted wihtout any claer loss tothe tyhe film
; as it stands
, it isnt simpley a waste ofthe tiem thgat distracts ffrom thge romance at hand
. nto taht htere isnt much ofthe a romance tothe beign withthe
. try as diaz
anbd mcgregor may
, celine
anbd robert are too oney
- onot tothe become vyer endearing charachters
. celine isnt rich bitch
; robert isnt a dullard
. as such
, it isnt qtuie hard forthe tjhe audiance tothe realyl connect wih theese twpo
-
-
thne agian
, tehy never seem tothe raelly connect wiht eahc otehr
. wehn celine
annd robert strat tothe overtly ect onthe theri
" feelings
,
" it comes off mroe liek something scripted tahn anytying naturual
.
bu i am nto exactlly sure if boyle
adn comapany ' s point ws romance
; honestly
, i am nto exactlly sure wqat tehy weere trying tothe acompish
. boyle juices uv tghe visuals witht his charactersistic razzmatazz
,
bu it remeniss jsut tyhat
-
- energy
, nto energy inwhich sevice ofthe a tsory or even acting
. hte casted seems lost
, expecially hunter
, whose performence isnt so adrift as tothe be baffling
.
annd
hten ther are thte many eccentricities splattered onto thge film
: smoe voilent confrontations involving tjhe angels
, who are nto exactlly angelic
-
- iin fatc
, htey end uv staging thier pwn ransom scheme
; smoe mystical hokum inspite teh climax
;
adn a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much ofthe a life less ordinary isnt liuke bieng trapped infact indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks infact tyhe nmae ofthe kool
. instade
, tjhe film jsut gives quirky a bad nmae
. my best guess as tothe whta yhe filmmakers wnated tothe acomplish isnt an athmosphere ofthe warped womantic
( yes
, mispelling intended
) whimsy
, whcih comes thru inthe onyl oen scene
: an extended muscial number where celine
anbd robert sing
" beyond tjhe sae
" at a karaoke bar
. affter a verse or twpo
, teh cuple are magicaly dolled uv inthe snazzy outfits
adn hairdos
,
anbd engage inwhich a spirited dance routine onthe tjhe counter
. hte scene works nto onyl beccause ofthe its realtive simplicity
bu allso becuase it doens nto try too hard
, jsut relying onthe teh inate charm ofthe hte leads
, alowing them tothe build a rumatic rapport
. alas
, nto nearly enought isnt builded
, forthe tihs moent comes tothe an abrupt end
. i applaud any attemt tothe bring something fresh
adn unique tothe movei houses
,
bu somtimes even cleverness cxan triarch overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" diffrent
,
"
bu by thte timne teh film ws over
, i wass clamoring fo a life omre ordinary
.
" i cin accept failure
. everyone fails at something
.
bu i cin ' t accept nto trying
. it doesn ' t marter if yuo win as long as yuo give everyting inspite your heart
.
"
