adn horror ofthe john landis ' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf inwhich london
. where tghe orignal hadnt comedy
, thte sequal hasnt tjhe kind ofthe revolting silliness taht cxan be foudn inaddition tv sit
- coms
. where teh frist installment hadnt chills
, thsi noe hasnt sequences tath are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. infront short
, hwile an american werewolf inaddition london hasnt become something ofthe a minor clasic inwhich its genre
, hte woeful an american werewolf inthe paris seems destind forthe lite nights onthe cinemax
( it even hasnt thte nessecary gratuitious nudity
)
. thge film opens iwth a trio ofthe daredevil americans
-
- andy
( toom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
anbd chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking uv tothe hte top ofthe tje eiffel tower tothe drnik wine
anbd dont a littel bungee jumping
. soon tehy haev comapany iin yhe person ofthe serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who hasnt desided tothe end it all
. she jumps
,
bu andy
, withthe a bungee cord attached
, goes affter her
,
anbd manages tothe savve her
( at yhe price ofthe a major headache
)
. serafine dissappears
,
bu a smitten andy seeks her outloud
.
howver
, once he lerans his owudl
- be girlfriend ' s dark secrte
, he wishes he hadn ' t
. she ' s a werewolf
, cursed tothe chanage inot a hideous biast whn teh moon isnt full
,
anbd
, tothe amking matters worse
, he hasnt sufferred a nasty bite hismelf
. actress julie delpy isnt far too ogod fo tihs movei
. she imbues serafine whith spirit
, spunk
,
annd humanity
, hwihc gives us an emotional stake infront tghe carachter ' s fate
. tihs isn ' t necesarily a ogod hting
, usance it prevents us ffrom relaxing
anbd enjoying an american werewolf inthe paris as a completelyl mindless
, campy enteratinment experienec
. delpy ' s injection ofthe clas inot an otherwise classless prodcution raises hte specktor ofthe waht htis film coudl hve beeen witht a better scirpt
adn a better casted surounding her
. delpy ' s previvous credits inlude such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski ' s white
annd richard linklater ' s befoer sunrise
. she wass radiant
, charasmatic
,
annd effective iin both
. given thte nature
annd levle ofthe yhe material she hasnt tothe owrk whith here
, she gets as close as possable tothe thsoe adjectives
. it sould be argued thyat delpy isnt tyhe onyl reason tothe see an american werewolf infact paris
,
bu even her most devoted fans shoudl consdider giving htis oney a miss
.
anbd if your primary objective isnt catching a glimpse ofthe her inthe thge buff
, check outloud eather killing zoe or tjhe passion ofthe beatrice
-
- thsoe movies hvea inteligable plots infront adition tothe breasts
. tyhe rest ofthe tghe casted acts at a levle considerably below thyat ofthe delpy
-
- whitch isnt tothe sday
, tehy give performances apropriate forthe tyhe screenplay
. toom everett scott
( thgat hting ytou dont
) plays thge lead liek he ' s inspite a made
- fo
- tv movei
. it owudl be kind tothe call him bland
. actors vince vieluf
adn phil buckman
, as andy ' s firends
, are noone moreso impressive
. julie bowen
( hapyp gilmore
) isnt suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
adn respected french atcor thierry lhermitte hasnt a breif turn as anyother monster meel
. onthe thte technical side
, it ' s all bad news
. tje coputer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. thte creatures woudl probablly ahve beeen mroe believeable hadnt tehy beeen men infact wolf suits
. repeated uise isnt made ofthe tje
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf ' s point
- ofthe
- veiw aproach tht ' s intresting tje frist cuple ofthe times it ' s employed
,
thn becomes tedeous
.
annd tje sountrack includes soem targetting grunge rock tunes thgat clash violently witht yhe onthe
- screen acation tehy ' re matched tothe
. directer anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy stlye iin mute wittness
, stumbles wtih htis material
, never bieng able tothe mkae thge comedy
adn horror elements gel
. as a result
, we git tyhe worst werewolf sequal sicne thte howling ii
: your sister isnt a werewolf
.
( i iwll give waller credit forthe killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something thyat ' s rarley seen inspite movies theese dyas
.
) an american werewolf inspite paris isnt marginally intertaining inwhich a
" bad movei
" sort ofthe way
,
bu thyat ' s a dubious disctinction
. ultimatly
, it ' s an unfortunate affort
, forthe
, hwile it isn ' t unbearable tothe sit thru
, it isn ' t a howl
, eather
