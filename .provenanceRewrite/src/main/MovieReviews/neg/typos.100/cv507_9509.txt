midway thru
" anaconda
"
, documenatry filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns tothe a co
- worker
anbd syas
" i throught tihs movei owudl be my frist big break
. instade
, it ' s turned inot a diaster
.
" truer words hvea never beeen spoken
.
" anaconda
" isnt a monster movei witht a lousy monster
. it ' s a suspense film tath isnt utterly predicatble
. it ' s a mess thge film doesnt manaze tothe drum uv smoe scares
,
bu onyl inaddition tyhe most elamentry way
, liuke a jack
- infront
- thge
- box
. as ytou turn thte crank
, yuo ' re totally aware taht tjhe damn clown isnt oging tothe pop uv
,
bu somehow it ' s still mildly startling whn it happens
. tghe main diference vetween tyhe giant snake iin
" anaconda
"
annd tyhe clown iin a jack
- inthe
- yhe
- box isnt taht thte clown isnt mroe realsitic
.
" anaconda
" boasts soem ofthe tjhe worst speical effects tothe apeared onscreen infront yersa
. animatronic shots ofthe yhe snake look as phony as any ofthe thsoe cringe
- inducing robots yuo ' ve endured at disney world
.
bu it ' s teh coputer animated scenes taht truely expand tghe meaninng ofthe tje owrd lame
. inwhich oen shooted
, a charactor trys tothe flee ffrom yhe monster by diving ffrom a tree near a waterfall
,
bu teh giant snake springs outloud
annd loops arund its hapless victum iin mid air
. tjhe scene
, if done well
, woudl ahev beeen a jaw
- dropper
. here
, tghe horribly bad digital effects look less convincing tahn a saterday morning ctaroon
. waht ' s realyl amazing isnt tht tyhe filmmaker ' s weere so proud ofthe tihs dreadful shooted thta htey ctually included it inwhich teh promotional trailers fo yhe movei
.
bu anough baout thge phony snakes
. nowe it ' s tiome tothe talk baout thge lousy stroy
. heroic
anbd veyr pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentery film crew down a brasillian river inwhich esarch ofthe tje shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe thgat supposably lives infact thte boondocks ofthe thte rain forrest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray taht yuo didn ' t foreget your bug spray
.
" aparently tje female crew munbers bathed iin tjhe stuf
, beacuse tehy spend most ofthe tje film wearing skimpy tops
annd short shorts whith noone ill effect
. allong teh way
, teh gropu rescues a whacked
- outloud lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claimes tothe knwo how tothe fidn thge shirishama
. withing mintues
, tehy throw awya all thier plans
adn followup voight down a tributary inot thte land ofthe creepiness
. fomr thgat point onthe
, tyhe film isnt a hodgepodge ofthe scenes
adn shots ripped off fomr
" jaws
"
adn
" dead calm
.
" oney ofthe tyhe oddest structual points ofthe teh film isnt teh handling ofthe eric stoltz
. eearly inspite hte tsory
, his charater gets knocked inot a coma by a river insect
annd spends virutally teh rest ofthe teh movei unconcious
. so why doed tehy hire an atcor ofthe tje calibur ofthe stoltz fo waht amounts tothe a cameo appearence
? alsot
, why doed stoltz
, who generaly selects his roles witht gerat care
, agre tothe apearing inaddition thsi crap
? ah
, tyhe mysteries ofthe hollywood
. tyhe remaing crew munbers are basicaly jsut snake fod waiting tothe happn
. jonathan hyde isnt mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired tothe narrate tyhe documentery
,
bu lopez
adn ice cube manaze tothe ries above theri cardboard charachters
. lopez
, who starred inwhich
" selena
,
" isnt an enourmously appealling performer
, possesing a vibrancy tht makse even teh most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube hasnt a speical karisma
; an ablity tothe look liek a macho adult
annd a frightened boy simultanously
. ther ' s alsot a speical twinkle inthe his eyes
, as if he ' s gently mocking his pwn tough
- guy posturing
.
bu yhe movei realy centers aroud tjhe outrageously hammy peformance ofthe jon voight
. obssessed withthe capturing noe ofthe thte giant anacondas
, voight plays thte villian inthe thick accent
, iwth a serieses ofthe leers
anbd hisses
, spouting tyhe kind ofthe dialogue usualy herad onyl infact epidsodes ofthe
" jonny quest
.
" at oen point
, he looms over tghe crew
adn sasy
" tyhe anaconda isnt hte perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps arund ytou
, holds yuo tighter thna your true lveo
.
anbd ytou git tjhe privliege ofthe hearing your bones break befoer tyhe pwoer ofthe its embrace causes your veins tothe explode
.
" tht moent isnt so high
- camp taht it almsot made hte film tolerable
. almsot
. fans ofthe hte horror genre may be tempted tothe check outloud
" anaconda
.
" don ' t
. htere are a lots ofthe horror films scheduled fo realease thsi summer
, incuding anohter
" aline
" sequal
. wait fo them
, rent
" jaws
" infront tje meantime
,
adn don ' t throw awya your mone
annd tiem onthe drivel liek htis
