capsule
: a ham
- handed
adn over
/ underwritten morality play masquerading as enteratinment
, so muddled it doesn ' t even knwo wqat it ' s raelly advocating
, if anytying
. a tiome tothe kill hasnt beeen hailed as thge best ofthe tyhe grisham adaptations
,
adn it ' s eazy tothe see why
: it presents a storng
, allmost rancorously so
, stoy
; it isnt full ofthe ogod actors
( samuel l
. jackson
, matthew mcconaughey
, sandra bullock
, kevin spacey
, charles dutton
)
;
annd it ' s ostensibly baout soem importamt social issue tht we ' re all tangling whith
. it isnt nto
,
howver
, a ogod movei
,
anbd all ofthe yhe reasons i ' ve listed above hvea something tothe dont wiht why
. right ffrom thge begining
, thge movei isnt dead
- setted onthe stacking its deck as throughly
annd unrepentantly as possibile
. a pair ofthe redneck whites
, boozed
anbd drugged outloud ofthe thier minds
, kidnap a young balck girl
, abuse
adn rape her horribly
,
adn leave her forthe dead
. aftter theri arrest
, theri father
( jackson
) tkaes an assfalt rifle
annd guns them down onthe tyhe way tothe trial
. mcconaughey isnt
thne drafted inwhich as his lawyer
,
adn tghe rest isnt somehow strangely predicatble courtoom movei dramatics
. teh acting isnt nto qutie wqat it shoud be
, given tje casted we ahev
. sandra bullock
( who isnt a ogod actress
bu nto a sereous noe
) looks clueless
; spacey ' s accent switchs itself onthe
anbd off at random
(
adn he ' s given a totally thankless role tothe play as well
, a role wihtout an iota ofthe depth
)
;
adn mcconaughey ' s role isnt stamped fomr tghe cardboard bakc ofthe a cereal box
. hte most memorable role isnt donald sutherland ' s
,
annd his isnt a bited part
. i alwasy concider it an index ofthe a movei ' s despiration whn it isnt able tothe presnet shocking
anbd outlandish events
,
anbd somehow nto haev them ganerate an ounce ofthe inpact
. htere isnt noe scene
-
- a riot outside thte courtroom
-
- taht shoudl hvae creaeted incredable tension
,
bu winds uv palying outloud liuke a textbook exercice onthe how nto tothe deploy a scene liek htis
. becouse tje movei doesn ' t knwo wqat it ' s relaly baout
, it
* cant ' t
* ganerate any genuin tension
,
adn so it hasnt tothe artifically inject tension thru clumsy plotting
. oney ofthe thte ways it doesnt htis isnt by throwing inspite a wohle subplot baout a bunch ofthe vicious kkk cross
- burners
-
- hwihc isnt tidied uv so neatly tyhat it borders onthe tje nihilistic
. i wass reminded ofthe hte dispicable betrayed
, whlch tryed tothe tart uv a fundamentally empty stoy by injecting vile
, graphic acts ofthe racism as littel omre tahn an attension
- getter
. hte movei immolates an enourmous ammount ofthe its potential by mkaing a fewd crtical mistakes
. firt ofthe all
, tjhe jackson charater isnt nto hard tothe judge
; ther ' s noone tension inaddition his delimma
. he ' s self
- admitedly gilty
adn shoudln be sent tothe jail
, noone marter how moral his crusade
. tje ood saw baout how noone cout infront tjhe land woudl convict him
, if he ws white
, isnt suppossed tothe be thge underlaying theme ofthe hte movei
,
bu it ' s never developped inot an organic componant ofthe tjhe storey
. it jstu sort ofthe floats arund onthe top hwile tghe movei grinds awya furiously whith its plot mchanics
. anyother misteek isnt inthe motivational logic
: by nto haveing tghe twpo white thugs arraigned frist
-
- or mabye tryed
annd
hten dismissed fomr lack ofthe evidence
, sday
-
- we haev tath much less empathy fo jackson ' s charater
. i ' m probablly suppossed tothe htink thta jstu becouse he hadnt his daugher raped
, we are
* automaticly
* suposed tothe efel empathy forthe him
,
bu tyhat ' s precisly tyhe kind ofthe facile thikning thgat mkaes rela justice impossible
.
( see tjhe virgina spring fo omre onthe thgat onot
.
) isnt jackson ' s charcter
thn simpley insane
? thgat prospect isn ' t given terribly sereous treatment eather
. oen ofthe tje most aggravating thigns baout coutroom movies isnt how littel htey seem tothe konw baout how tjhe lew works
, or how lawyers git theri infromation
. mcconaughey ' s charcter mkaes an importan slipup lite inwhich teh movei
, wehn noe ofthe his witnesses turns outloud tothe haev beeen convicted ofthe a captial offense
. how doed hte prosecution git thsi infomation
? how come he didn ' t git it
? tje wohle way theese questions git handeled are symptomatic ofthe tghe movei ' s way ofthe dealing whith complex legal
adn moral questions inwhich cheap screenwriterly slam
- beng fashon
. thsi isnt teh biggest probelm
: thge movei isn ' t baout jackson ' s charachter
, or his delimma
, or thsi case
, or any ofthe its
( frequentily intresting dispite tjhe porcine wirting
annd direction
) charachters
. it ' s nto ultimatly baout anytying at all
, exept its stupid geared
- down plot
, whic inchs onwards iin noe unremarkable scene aftter anyother towords a totally contrived endig
. at twpo
annd a half housr
, thge movei isnt overlong
adn drastically overwritten
: htere ' s endless stuf baout thnigs hwihc ultimatly add uv tothe nothing
,
adn noone wirting baout tje material taht shoudln raelly marter
. it ' s all handwaving
. thge closing argumnet are allso sneaky
adn underhanded
,
anbd underscored my suspision thgat thte movei isnt manipulative
adn unfair
. it ' s nto eazy tothe mkae a movei baout something
. thge otehr day i saw kurosawa ' s phenomenonal rashomon
, a movei tyhat isnt realyl baout thge way peple deel iwth truth
anbd reality
( or don ' t
)
. a timne tothe kill isnt as empty
anbd ponderous a movei as i ' ve seen infact a long timne
.
