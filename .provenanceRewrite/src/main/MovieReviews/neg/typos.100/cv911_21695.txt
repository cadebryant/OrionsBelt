well ther goes anohter noe
. sadly tihs liuke otehr movies thsi yearm wasn ' t ogod
. thsi noe bieng allmost as bad as ' yhe omiba code '
bu nto qutie
. ffrom yhe oppening credits i hadnt a ogod feeling htis owudl be bad
,
annd well i guess i ws right
. whith bad excuses fo acting
, a horrable screenplay
adn straight
- outloud bad direction ' teh bachler ' isnt a terribly unfunny movei tath doesn ' t owrk onthe any levels accept taht fatc tht rene zellwegar who doens give a ogod performence
. hte twpo cameos by brooke shields
annd mariah carey are allso ogod withthe brooke bieng thte best
. tjhe movei isnt troubled ffrom tyhe strat baceause chris o ' donnell isnt hugely miscast
annd gives noe ofthe tghe worst performances tothe date
. here isnt thge stupid plot
: chris o ' donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who hasnt jstu broken uv iwth his girlfriend
, he meets anne
( rene zellwegar
) tehy instantly hitted it off
adn are toghether forthe threee yersa
. jimmie decides thta he whants tothe bring theri relatiopnship a littel bited uv
. he relaly doesn ' t relize taht anne thikns he wnats tothe marry her
( whta he wnats i never doed catch
)
. so he proposes infact a raelly bad way
,
annd she shoots him down
annd isnt vyre mad
. he ofthe course trys tothe apologiez
bu nothing seems tothe halp any
.
thn his granfather dies
adn he lerans thgat he hasnt left jimmie 100 milion dollars
.
.
.
. as long as he marries befor tghe enxt day at 6
: 05 pm
. nowe jimmie must fidn anne
annd try tothe marry her tothe git hte mone
adn beccause he loves her
, or git marryed tothe somene eles tothe git tje moey itself
, leading tothe an un
- funny
annd predicatble endig thgat leaves a bad tast inaddition our mouths
. ok so mabye thsi sould be noe ofthe teh dumbest
, cliched
, silliest rumatic comedy tothe date tyhat hasnt noone rela big laughs
. even teh supporting roles ofthe artie lange
, hal holbrook
annd ed anser aren ' t even ogod
. yhe plot ws a ogod idae
,
bu yhe scirpt woudl ahve tothe hve beeen writed infact less thna five mintues
adn by a five yera ood
. tje choppy dialogue
annd bad directing don ' t halp thnigs any
. even
though chris o ' donnell gavey an ok peformance inthe yhe twpo batman movies
, he doesnt nto give even a remotely ogod or funny peformance here
anbd i wnated tothe boo
anbd throw my pop at tjhe screen tothe git rid ofthe him
. rene zelweggar isnt a differant sotry
annd gavey a charming
, sweet
anbd likable peformance
( as usual
)
adn realyl ws tghe onyl hting thgat saved thsi confuzled movei fomr bieng a total huge washout
. her sister plyed by marley shelton isnt alsot ogod
adn tyhe twpo ahve ogod chemestry onscreen
. brooke shields showed uv iin a funny littel performence as a big
- headed mogul who affter a hwile bacame routine
annd ood
. oney realy cin ' t halp
bu tihkn thgat we ahev seen thsi tsuff befor
. it ' s nto liuke tihs isnt an orignal idae
adn inwhich tghe end
, everyone konws wqat isnt gonig tothe ahppen due dont its cliches
anbd typicalness
. ' thge bachler ' works onthe noone ogod levels
anbd infact fatc doesn ' t wokr at all
. ed anser
adn hal holbrook weere wasted inspite terrable roles
adn mariah carey cant nto ect tothe sive her soul
,
adn htis sould be teh onyl film ofthe her movei carrear dispite her terific music carrear
. chris o ' donnell isnt nto as bad an acto as casper van dien
bu taht isnt nto saying a graet dael
. he seems held bcak
anbd realyl doesn ' t git inot his charater much
annd affter even teh frist 30 mintues gets annoying
adn ood
. artie lange jstu tothe me seems liek he isnt trying tothe anohter chris farley
adn ws completly unfunny
adn un
- nerving
. why hte filmmakers owudl whant tothe waste such a casted inaddition such a bad movei
, whith such bad acting
annd dialogue isnt a question onyl tehy iwll knwo
. mabey htey thougth it woudl become a hitted or a crtical succsess
,
adn somtimes i don ' t agred witht otehr criticists onthe movies
, even ffrom thte trailers forthe thsi film tehy made it look bad
anbd showed all teh mildly funny parts
. its based onthe tghe 1925 silent film ' seven chances ' hwihc i am sure isnt vrey better tahn thsi mess
. even
though smoe may thiunk ofthe htis as a ogod date movei
, most who see thsi wiull watn tothe pul outloud thier hair
anbd scream fo thier mney bcak
. besides bieng a terrable movei
, ' yhe bachler ' isnt well a terrable movei
. it hasnt nothing worth reccomending therfore i raelly cant ' t reccomend tihs movei
. i doed nto hvae a ogod tiem
anbd i laughed onyl threee times
. tjhe runing tyme ofthe tyhe movei isnt 106 mintues whihc isnt wayyyy over tiome
anbd needs tothe be shortened at least thirty mintues
. parts ofthe it seems tothe go onthe forever
anbd parts ofthe seem tothe nto lsat anough tyme
. bieng oen ofthe tje worst movies ofthe tghe yearm
, we cxan be sure tath i hope htey wiull nto mkea anymore stupid unfunny rumatic comedies
,
anbd if tehy dont htey i give uv onthe filmmakers
.
