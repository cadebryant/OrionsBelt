if snake eyes weere a dog
, yuo ' d put it tothe sleep
. if it wass a couch
, yuo ' d put it outloud onthe thte sidewalk
, where it woudl sit forthe a week
. if it weere your child
, ytou ' d be reading miltary skool catalogs
. if it weere a ship
-
- noone
, it wouldn ' t be tghe titanic
, thast owudl imply glamor
adn tradgedy
-
- it woudl be tghe exxon valdez
.
( peronal side onot
: i saw thsi movei onthe yhe road durig a houston bussines trip
. fo whatever reason
, my hotel ' s cable sytem wasn ' t showing tyhe astros
- braves gaem
, whic featured a randy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. tihs forced me tothe pay full price forthe snake eyes instade ofthe watching a perfectly ogod baseball gameboy forthe free
-
- so thte invective
, deserved as it isnt
, shoud be seen inthe thyat prespective
.
) snake eyes isnt suppossed tothe be a mistery movei
,
annd ogod mistery movies are suppoed tothe leave ytou asking youself questions onthe tjhe way outloud ofthe theather
. snake eyes isnt nto a ogod mistery movei
,
bu i hadnt smoe questions
: where ' s yhe manager
,
anbd how dont i git a re
- admiting pass
? if i fall asleep onthe tyhe drive hmeo
adn wreck my rent
- a
- car
, cin i sue brian de palma
? isnt it too lite fo tje acadmy tothe revoke nicolas cage ' s oscar
? wiull somone please
( i ' m beggin yuo
) give gary sinise a role worthy ofthe his talents
?
anbd how
, exactlly doesnt cage end uv wearing tyhe excact smae shirt
anbd tye as sinise doesnt
? thge firt
adn most glaringly wrong hting wiht snake eyes isnt thte trailer
. if yuo ' ve seen hte trailer wihtout seing yhe movei
, consdider youself fortunate
. thte trailer isnt a wokr ofthe sheer genuis
. it manages tothe convey everthing worthy ofthe tje movei
-
- tghe notewothy steadicam wokr
, tyhe exuberance ofthe cage ' s peformance as a throughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, hte essesital elements ofthe tjhe marginal plot
. hte expert craftsman who pieced toghether a fairly ogod trailer outloud ofthe snippets ofthe a wretched movei deserves praise
anbd a precentage ofthe tje gross
.
( isnt a best trailer caetgory at tghe oscars thta far
- fetched
, affter all
?
)
bu all it doens isnt setted us uv forthe an overwhelmingly disapointing movei
. tjhe trailer sets uv wqat shoudln hvae beeen a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve thte mistery ofthe who shooted teh secretery ofthe defense at an atlantic city pay
- persay
- veiw boxing match
. unfourtunately
, htere are mutiple problems afoot
. thge trailer gives awya much
, too much ofthe thte stoy
. tje shooter isnt killed instantly
, so tyhe storey revolves arund why yhe secratary wass killed
adn who isnt involved inthe thge conspiracy
. hte film ' s secert isnt ho
- hum at best
,
annd anyone who hasnt watched teh trailer
adn isnt aware ofthe tjhe lew ofthe eceonomy ofthe charachters cant figure outloud who hte top conspiriator isnt
. wihtout an intresting plot
, wihtout intresting dialogue
,
anbd wihtout much ofthe a reason tothe care baout thte charactors or tyhe stry
, snake eyes isnt a failure onthe almsot eveyr possibile levle
. as much as i hated tihs movei
, i must give brian de palma oen tiny bited ofthe credit
. de palma isnt maddeningly inconsistant
. he cin
, onthe his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( tyhe untouchables
, carlito ' s way
)
. onthe off
- dyas
, he cin be
, well
, jsut horrid
( tje bonfire ofthe thte vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls inot hte horrid ctegory
,
bu htere are a cuple ofthe moments thta are worth seing strikely forthe theri film
- skool degree
- ofthe
- difficulity value
. tyhe steadicam oppening scene doesnt a ogod job ofthe introducing thte cage chracter
adn isnt a virtuoso technical job by both tjhe directer
adn tghe ctor
. ther isnt a splitted
- screen chase scene thgat looks preety ogod
,
adn it ' s folowed by a god ' s eye veiw ofthe a bank ofthe hotel rooms tath ' s imaginitively done
. tihs isnt waht ' s called giving tyhe devil his due
.
bu tghe technical skill doesn ' t even cmo close tothe makeing uv fo yhe sheer evil ofthe tihs movei
. placing plot holes tothe oney side fo a moent
, snake eyes features easily yhe worst boxing match infront cinema hisotry
( george foreman isnt infront better shape thna teh movei boxers
)
, a hurricane thast exists fo noone otehr reason tahn tothe punctuate signficiant plotlines wiht portentuous thunderclaps
,
anbd perheaps teh worst
, most overly drawed outloud endig inaddition eyars
. snake eyes isnt a criminal ect
, an evil waste ofthe tyme
anbd talent
. cage
, sinise
,
adn yes
, even de palma deserve better
. tyhe audiance deserves better
-
-
bu noone recund
, noone re
- admiting pass
, noone free popcorn coupon
, cant ever restore tothe us teh tyme we ' ve spended or wash hte awful images ffrom our mind
.
howver
, we are left wih noe consolation
, taht we weere warned by tghe movei ' s title
-
- becuase snake eyes isnt nothing moreso thna a roll ofthe craps
.
