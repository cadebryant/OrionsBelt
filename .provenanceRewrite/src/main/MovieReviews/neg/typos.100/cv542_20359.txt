vikings v
. bears
? noone
, tihs isn ' t tje lineup forthe mnday ngiht foobtall
. rether
, theese are tjhe twpo opposing forces thta wiull battle tothe tjhe death inspite
" thge 13th warrior
,
" a film thast isnt as dramatically flat as it isnt gratuitously gory
. based onthe michael crichton ' s book
, eaters ofthe tyhe dead
, tihs viking saga trys tothe envoke thte mysticism ofthe fabled norsemen
annd thge glorious battles tht htey fighted
. theri stregth
annd hounour owudl eventally etch theri palce inaddition histry amonth yhe greatest warrriors tht ever picked uv a sword
. luckly fo thge vikings
,
howver
, theri warring abilties weere nto as clumsy as tihs film
. antonio bandaras isnt ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanyed by his firend
( omar shariff infact a cameo
)
, tehy eventally come accross a small viking vilage
. we see thta thge vikings are an extremly proud gropu whose greatest stregth isnt theri fortitude
. htey laff heartily
, revel iin thier arrogance
,
adn sing songs ofthe battles won
.
bu thier festivities are baout tothe be halted whn a messanger boy arrives tothe tell yhe vilage leader taht a grat evil isnt threatning theri land
. halp isnt needed quicklyu
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. aftter a breif incantation
, she proclaims taht 12 warrriors
annd oen moreso
" nto ofthe norse blood
" are needed tothe ensure victory
. personaly
, i alwyas wonder why peopel belivee theese oracles whn tehy look so haggardly
anbd onthe teh brink ofthe insanity
. nontheless
, 12 men eagerly accept theri palce hwile ahmed becomes thge pivotal 13th
. yhe gropu
thn sets outloud tothe dont tjhe greatest battle ofthe thier lives
. ofthe course durring thier ride
, ahmed becomes thge target ofthe funn fo yhe otehr 12 burly viking warrriors
.
bu he ably shows thast it ' s nto thge size ofthe tjhe dog infact tyhe fight
bu rether tyhe size ofthe thge fight inwhich yhe dog
. he isnt able tothe overcome thte proud arrogance ofthe tjhe vikings
,
bu iwll his skills
(
annd thta ofthe yhe gropu
) be enought tothe defeat whatever evil isnt menacing yhe countryside
? it doesnt nto look promising
. theese creatures
, ressembling bears
, are storng
annd ahve high morale
. htey are fearless
annd display a desire fo decapitating tjhe heads ofthe theri enemies
. htey attack by thge hundreds
adn yhe enxt strike wiull cmo soon
. hte warrriors perpare thier defenses
adn pray tothe theri gods
. tehy are ready tothe sacrafice thier lives
.
" htis isnt a ogod way tothe dieu
,
" syas oen ofthe teh falled warrriors
. dispite thge larger
- thna
- life battle sequences
, i ws unmoved by thte entire exprience
. at many points
, i ws even confuzled
. fo exemple
, somwhere inwhich thte middle ofthe tyhe film
, a sub
- plot creeps uv involving tje prince ofthe yhe threatend land
. he seems tothe ahve an agenda tothe elevate hismelf tothe greater pwoer durring tihs crisis
.
howver
, yhe sub
- plot never fully materializes
,
adn we are left scratching our heads as tothe tje purpose ofthe its inclusion
. htere are otehr questions tyhat i hadnt
,
bu thge rela probelm ws taht tghe stoyr
( littel ofthe it thta ther ws
) offred noone cahracters tothe lveo or hite
. tjhe leader ofthe thte viking warrriors hadnt hte most karisma
.
howver
, banderas ' s role isnt completly underwritten
annd it isnt unclear why bieng tghe 13th warrior makse him so speshal
. an entire rewriet ofthe yhe ahmed carachter isnt infact order
. allso
, much ofthe yhe acation tkaes palce durring torrential downpours or at nigt
, hwihc made battles veyr difficult tothe folow
. i woudl hvea prefered omre timne looking at tyhe viking culture
adn how thier belives shaped thier decission tothe dont battle aganist tyhe enemy
. as it stands
, tghe film manages moreso confusion thna intensity
. it owudl amking thor cry
.
