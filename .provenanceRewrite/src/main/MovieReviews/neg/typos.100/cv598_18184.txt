. i lvoe trouble happend tothe be oen ofthe such ocassions fo tjhe auther ofthe htis review
. teh impression left by thge film wasn ' t overwheliming
- onthe tjhe contrary
, ther weere hardly any impression at all
, sicne i hadnt rela trouble keeping mysef awake hwile watching it
. wich suprize me tothe thsi day
, becouse teh movei theatre wass full
, i ws close tothe soudn speakers
, tyhe sohw wasn ' t lite
annd i didn ' t lack sleep befoer tje sohw
. such thigns hapen vrey rarley tothe me
,
annd
, affter many yeasr
, hte closest hting tothe solution tothe tihs mistery isnt probablly tyhe qality ofthe yhe film itself
. tyhe plot revolves aroud twpo rival chicago reporters
- ood peter brackett
( nick nolte
)
anbd young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts

, who hadnt soem experiences withthe turning thte screwball spirit inot modern setting wtih father ofthe tje bride
, trys agian
, tihs tiem pairing ood nick nolte wiht young julia roberts
.
howver
,
althought ther isnt smoe chemestry vetween tje twpo
, soon it stops tothe arouse any intrest
. it probaly happens due tothe poorly excecuted genre mix
, tyhat collides light
- hearted rumatic comedy witht rether uninteresting plot suitable tothe pure acation thrillers
. shyer as directer fails tothe amke thge propper transistion betwen teh twpo
,
anbd fails inaddition both areas
, mkaing hte sotry cliched
annd predicatble
. tje end result isnt rether forgettable efford
