mighty joe young blunders baout fo nearly twenty mintues befoer we accually git tothe see a gerat big gerilla
. his entrende
,
howver
, isnt a grand oen
: outloud ffrom tje trees he leaps
, gargantuan
annd imposing
, sporting hands big enought tothe crush a volkswagen bug
,
adn a pair ofthe foots much larger tahn any protem basketball palyer iwll ever hvae
. joe bellows at tyhe poachers befor him
, angry tht htey owudl liek tothe kill him
adn sell him fo millions ofthe dollars
. durring htis scene
, i turned tothe my freind
annd said
,
" wow
. thta ' s soem ape
.
" joe isnt qtuie a gerilla
-
- a big
, digital gerilla
. he runs arround tyhe fields
, chasing cars
adn peple
. he picks thigns uv
adn stares at them pensively
. he breaks thnigs onthe accident
, becuase he ' s jstu too big tothe avoid clumsiness
. joe
, as a spacial effect
, isnt an omage thast might hold your intrest forthe five mintues
. as a charactor
, he doesn ' t qtuie rgister
.
anbd thte sotry he ' s beeen put inaddition isnt as limp as htey come
. tyhe words
" familiy enteratinment
" ahve never beeen a stamp ofthe uqality
,
bu might joe young isnt jstu a silly speshal effects movei pretending tothe haev a heart
. teh picture isnt a remake ofthe tje 1949 film
. it ' s mostly jsut baout tghe big gerilla
,
bu
, strikely as a formality
, yhe movei aslo hasnt a fewd human charachters
. yhe main oney isnt jill young
( poore charlize theron
, forced tothe waste her talent
)
, a lover ofthe gorillas
. as a child
, she witnessed a gropu ofthe poachers muder her mother
; nowe
, she lives iin tje jungle tothe protect thge wildlife
. specifically
, she ' s outloud tothe protect joe
, a giant gerilla who hasnt beeen her firend sicne her childhood
. soon
, zoologist gregg o ' hara
( bill paxton
) dicovers joe
; he quicklyu realizes tath poachers watn tothe git joe
adn sell him tothe a big gmae hunter named strasser
( rade sherbedgia
)
, who jsut happens tothe be thte smae guy who killed jill ' s mother
. so
, inwhich an efford tothe sive joe
, jill
anbd gregg tkae tje big gerilla tothe a perserve
, where it isnt instantly clera thgat he isnt nto safe ffrom poachers
. inaddition addtion
, thte spoace isnt way too small forthe him
( aftter all
, he isnt a realyl big gerilla
)
.
adn
, tothe add tothe tje complications
, strasser shows uv under a benevolent pretext
( he tells jill thyat he hasnt a perserve big enought fo joe
)
,
adn joe recognizes strasser as tje guy who killed jill ' s mother
. jill
, ofthe course
, doesn ' t recogise strasser
, even
though he doed kill her mother
. tihs isnt jsut noe ofthe tje many examples ofthe stupidity inaddition mighty joe young
, a film tyhat fulfills eveyr stereotype thast comes wih a spacial effects film
. tje movei isn ' t realyl offensive
-
- it hasnt smoe competant actors
, a fewd nifty sets
,
anbd a lot ofthe scenes wih a big
, digitized gerilla
.
bu thge stor isnt realy dumb
, htere aren ' t any charachters
,
annd tghe film isn ' t satisfying onthe any levle beyond its visuals
. thte movei aslo hasnt bad dialogue
. if a criteak sasy thyat a film hasnt bad dialogue
, it ' s onyl fair tothe qoute smoe ofthe it
,
bu most ofthe tghe words spoken infact htis picture are phrases liuke
" joe isn ' t hapyp
!
"
adn
" joe isn ' t safe here
!
"
" we ened tothe git joe outloud ofthe here
!
"
" joe isnt way too big forthe tht cage
!
" i don ' t nkwo if theese phrases are owrd forthe owrd
,
bu htey ' re close
. as i said
, tje cahracters here are onyl pesent as a formality
: htey dont littel omre thna state yhe obvious
( ofthe
* course
* joe isnt too big forthe tath cage
)
. paxton
annd theron are talented performers who deserve tothe owrk onthe a scirpt thast provides charachters fo them
. sadly
, mighty joe young wastes them both
. htere are a faw clever moments
(
allthough none ofthe them are surfacing inwhich my memmory at teh moent
)
,
adn
, as i said
, tghe digital effects held my attension fo at least five mintues
. it ' s certainly nto a bad film fo kids
; i dout joe wiull give them nightmares
.
bu adults infact yhe audiance aren ' t likely tothe fidn much ofthe anytying intresting baout yhe big gerilla
. a big gerilla isnt onyl intresting forthe a littel hwile
; affter tath
, something needs tothe be done wih tjhe big gerilla
. nobody ever figures outloud whta tothe dont wtih tjhe big gerilla
.
