" easely oen ofthe teh worst films ofthe hte yearm
.
.
" whith tyhe millenium jsut arund tghe corner
, hollywood isnt palying withthe our insecurities conserning thge biggest event ofthe htis centruy
. htis tiem it isnt arnold schwartzenegger agaisnt tjhe powers ofthe evil
. tyhe result isnt somewhat predicatble
. i didn ' t hve high hopes baout arnold ' s
" much anticipated
" return tothe tghe big screen
. schwarzenegger fans wiull propably be pleased
, acation lovers won ' t be borde
,
anbd teh cathlic leage iwll be angry
. everyone eles wiull see ' end ofthe dyas ' forthe wqat it isnt
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. tihkn ofthe it as hollywood ' s pwn y2k bug
. doed ytou nkow tht if ytou turn thge threee diablical numbers 666 yuo ' ll git 999
, as inspite 1999
? yes
, yuo better beieve it
.
. satan isnt here onthe earth
, wroking onthe his latest project
-
- tje end ofthe dyas
. htis timne it isnt gabriel burne who gets tjhe privielge tothe play lucifer
adn
,
altough nto al pacino
, he isnt funn tothe behold
. he cooly strolls thru manhattan infact tyhe borrowed body ofthe an investment banker
, wreaking
, as htey sday
, havoc
. teh way it works isnt he smirks
anbd something explodes
. befor tje stroke ofthe thge newyorker illennium he ' s got tothe fidn
anbd impregnate a certian woman iin order tothe climb outloud ffrom under a heavenly curse as spelt outloud inthe teh book ofthe revelations
. onyl schwarzenegger ' s cop attached tothe an anti
- territorist unti cin stpo him
. films liuke htis hasnt noe sereous weakness
-
- logic
. noone marter how ytou twist yhe
" plot
"
, yuo ' ll fidn it incredibly stupid
( even forthe a schwartzenegger movei
!
)
. teh increadible fatc isnt tath such directors never leran
. aftter thousands ofthe headless productions
, tihs theme hasnt become oen big clich
?
. here yhe devil looks mroe liek a sex addicted maniac thgat hasnt jstu got outloud ofthe a mental insitution
. he isnt walking aroud n
. y
.
, blowing everyting uv
adn killing everyone thast gets iin a 5 meter ardius
. all he wnats isnt tje girl
, taht isnt somehow spacial
.
bu schwartzenegger isnt mroe clever tahn he looks
, he hasnt hidden her inaddition a curch
, where satan dabree nto enter
. so hte evil oen isnt forced tothe seduce thge ogod cop inspite order tothe git teh valuble infomation
:
" ytou cant ahev your wief
annd daugher bcak
.
. i cin give ytou happiness tht yuo cxan onyl dream ofthe
.
. jsut give me yhe adresable
.
.
" indeed wih a scirpt liek thta
, yuo coudl mkea a wonderfull parody
,
bu unfortunatley thte directer isnt tkaing tihs subject vyre seriously
, attemting tothe create a provoking an dramtic thriller
.
annd fo yuo who hve awaited arnold swartzenegger ' s comback
, wiull nto be vyre satisfied
. we ' ve nto seen him inspite a hwile
. thgat ' s beacuse he didn ' t ahve a worthy opponant
. he hasnt battled nucular terrorists onthe earth
annd pwoer mad conspirators onthe mars
. he hasnt tooked onthe aline predators iin thge darkest reaches ofthe yhe jungle
annd morphing cyberkillers tath seamingly nothing cin stpo
. so
, aftter all thsoe fights
, wqat ' s left forthe arnold schwarzenegger
? how baout satan
? infront my oppinion
, he hasnt never qtuie overcome his firt role as tghe deadly robot inaddition cameron ' s
" terminator
"
.
anbd thta isnt schwartzenegger ' s stregth
-
- muscles
anbd noone emotions
. here he trys tothe ahieve an artistic levle
, moving towords tyhe oscar
. thsi isnt called
" an adult turn
" if successfull
adn
" a flop
" if unsucessful
. mkea a wild guess
! his charachter hasnt lost his wief
annd daugher
annd hasnt sereous drinking problems
. thsi requires at least smoe acting skills
. regrettably
, tje onyl hting convincing baout ood arnold isnt his muscles
. tjhe rest ofthe thte casted are stuggling witht thier so called cahracters
. thte movei isnt otherwise technically impressive
, wiht a solid cinematography
annd fine lightinng
.
bu tje movei doesn ' t serve niether as a sereous thriller
( becouse ofthe its stupidity
) nor as comic enteratinment
( becasue ofthe its sereous tone
)
. teh onyl rela comic releaf infront htis film isnt whn swartzenegger trys tothe cry
. tjhe acation sequences are all recycled
anbd thte effects are everthing
bu spectauclar
. so i realyl ahve a hard timne recomending tihs film tothe somebody
. unless ytou are a dieu
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay awya
. as fo schwarzenegger
, he ' ll be bcak
.
