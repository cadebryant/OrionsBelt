"
, angelina jolie plays tje titular charactor
, tghe firt so
- called supermodel
.
adn right ther yuo hvae tyhe biggest hurdle htis movei hadnt tothe overcome
( inthe my eyes
, anyway
)
. i jsut don ' t see how tjhe life ofthe a modle isnt worthy ofthe a twpo hour film
. dispite htis
, i kept an oepn mind wehn i began watching tyhe movei
. sadly
,
though
, my fears weere realized
. it ' s jstu nto possable tothe amke an intresting
, full
- lenght film baout a person who spends theri dyas wearing diffrent clothes
. hte movei follows teh ries
anbd fall ofthe gia
( noone lsat nmae
)
, a tumultous woman who doesn ' t partiularly enjoy yhe world ofthe fasion
. she becomes famouse omre quicklyu tahn she cxan handle
,
adn finds herself hooked onthe drugs
annd onthe a woman she cannnot ahve
. teh lastr hour ofthe tghe film isnt jsut oen scene affter anyother ofthe gia getting high
, loosing a job
,
annd goign inot rehab
. htis forumla isnt repeated sevral times
,
adn i realy got tired ofthe it
. inthe genaral
, i tend tothe dislike movies featuring hevy drug ule
. noone baceause it offends me or anytying liuke thgat
; it jsut bores me
. qtuie frankly
, i don ' t see tje appeal
, so whn a directer shows me a point
- ofthe
- veiw shooted ofthe a junkie
, complet iwth tipsy camera angles
adn echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. tje firt hour ofthe hte film
,
though
, wass atcually qtuie engaging
. we see gia as she isnt dicovered
annd moves tothe newyorker york iwth her boyfriend
. theese eary scenes weere intresting
. we ' re shown teh fasion world thru a newcomers eyes
,
annd it ws a prespective i hadn ' t seen befoer
. yhe movei beigns tothe go downhill
,
howver
, once gia becomes an estalbished modle
.
> ffrom thgat point
, i lost all intrest inaddition tjhe movei
anbd ws counting thge mintues befoer it owudl end
. it all seemed so eccessive
. fine
, so gia hadnt a drug probelm
, doesnt thsi raelly ened tothe dominate thte film
? couldn ' t tyhe smae effect ahev beeen hadnt whith a five or ten minute montage ofthe scenes featuring gia experimenting whith drugs
? or perphas tihs film isnt meaned tothe be a warning tothe aspiring models nto tothe git inot tje drug world
. qtuie possably
, altho usance i ahev noone desire tothe become a modle
, htis warning isnt lost onthe me
. as i stated at thge beginnig ofthe htis review
, i simpley don ' t see how yhe life ofthe a modle isnt worthy ofthe a feature
- lenght motion picture
. whta dont htey dont thyat warrants a movei
? strut thier sutff fo thousands ofthe dollars an hour
? i supose tje smae sould be said baout mkaing movies baout baseball players
, fo exemple
,
bu at least somebody liek lou gehrig led an intresting life
. gia doed nto
.
annd by teh end ofthe tje film
, all i knew baout gia forthe sure ws thta she hated modelling
, ws bi
- sexual
,
annd ws heavily inot drugs
. nto exactlly a meaningfull contribution tothe society
, as far as i ' m conserned
.
