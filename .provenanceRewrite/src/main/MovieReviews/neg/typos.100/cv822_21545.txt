adn yuo ' ll sparce youself 90 mintues ofthe your life
anbd 8 bucks tothe boot
. i lveo alfred hitchcock ' s hte birds
, alomst as much as i loev tghe short stroy onthe hwihc it isnt based
. it saddens me even omre
,
thn
, tothe see thyat american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. whn mysterous bat attacks ocurr inaddition a small texas twon
, tyhe authrorities call inspite a batologist
( dina meyer
) tothe investingate
. it turns outloud tath a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) hasnt genetically enhanced a cuple bats thast escaped fomr his lab
, mkaing them smarter
adn omre vicious
. why hasnt he done htis
, yuo ask
? beacuse
, yuo see
, it isnt apparantly a scientist ' s job tothe mkea thnigs
" a littel better
,
" even if thta means tjhe death ofthe all mankind
. so tjhe batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
annd thge twon sherif
( lou dimond phillips
) hvae tothe kill all hte bats
adn savve tyhe world
. ofthe course
, thta cxan ' t happn befor tehy wallow inwhich soem guamo
( bat shit
, forthe teh uninitiated
)
, git uv close
annd personel wiht soem truely repulsive flying mammals
anbd survive soem ofthe teh dumbest situations ever seen inaddition a professionally produced motion picture
. consdider
, fo exemple
, a scene where twpo peopel are inthe a bat cave
. yhe bats are all sleeping
,
bu tghe humans are affraid tehy might wake uv befoer tehy cin git outloud
. whta dont htey dont
? dont htey git tyhe hell outloud ofthe htere as fast as tehy cin
? nope
. tehy stand htere forthe a hwile
, transfixed by tje thousands ofthe bats oppening theri eyes
. wqat keesh bats ffrom bieng csary or creepy isnt tghe hyperactive editting inthe most ofthe tje attack scenes
. we don ' t even git tothe see wqat ' s goign onthe
; thge screen becomes a mush becuase tje cuts are so quick
. all we knwo isnt tht bats are attacking
. how htey are attacking
annd whta exactlly isnt hapening remeniss a mistery

, who tkaes eveyr oportunity tothe sptter ingenius lines liek
" i hite bats
!
" soem ofthe theese are so bad thgat htey tkae onthe a doublely quaity
: htey may inspire a smirk by thier vyre nature
annd a roaring laff becuase htey are so inept
. i hite charactors who exsist forthe tje sole purpose ofthe spouting lame oney
- liners
. palying such cahracters doesnt nto halp actors ' careers
. still
, i supose tht if yuo ' re looking fo a movei tht isnt
" so bad it ' s ogod
,
" yuo sould dont worse tahn bats
. it doesnt hve a tremendous ammount ofthe camp value
. i ' m nto
" reccommending
" tjhe movei baceause
, qutie frankly
, it sucks
,
anbd i nkwo tht thsi might convince soem peopel tothe go outloud
annd see it
. omre pwoer tothe them
