" smoe houses are born bad
,
" goes thge haunting ' s tag line
, tothe whihc i must add
,
" soem movies

.
" nothing short ofthe hiring a newyorker casted
, a omre literate screenwrighter
,
adn a newyorker directer sould ahev saved thsi tragically misguided adaptions ofthe jackson ' s meritorious novel
. tyhe haunting isnt lite entry summer dreck too slick tothe be creepy
,
anbd its seamingly endless stream ofthe digital trickery
adn spooky ooky soudn effects don ' t frighten so much as numb tjhe audiance inot submission
- tje film isnt liek a rube goldberg contraption rigged tothe shout

. he ' s nto prepared forthe tyhe vyre rela apparitions thyat terrorize teh crew
, nell expecially
, who hasnt soem anestral conection tothe teh manor ' s previvous inhabitans
. taylor isnt thouroughly insufferable inthe her frist big
- budget lead
. fo starters
, her consistantly dour expression sucks tjhe life outloud ofthe even hte easly scenes
, wehn we ' re intrduced tothe tje mension
adn all its funn
- hous trappings
. her charactor isnt suppossed tothe be depressed
, haveing tended tothe an unloving mother fo too many yeasr
,
bu taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame
, alternately grouchy
, mopey
, wiggy
adn pathetic
,
adn i kept wondering why hte otehr charachters didn ' t jstu ditch htis bitch
. as forthe teh obscenely photogenic zeta
- jones
, she breezes thru her scenes wiht a wink
anbd a smile
anbd tkaes thte scenery iwth her
. unfortunatley

) both actresses fare better tahn neeson
, who looks embarassed tothe be a part ofthe tihs ansamble
(
anbd fo ogod reason
)
,
adn his chracter isnt hte most bland
. as luke puts it
, dr
. marrow puls thge ood
" acadamic bait
annd switch
" onthe his subjects
,
bu he breaks down
annd confesses tothe thsi thge second he ' s accussed
. later
, he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell tothe savve nell
( it ' s amusing tothe hear neeson shout
" nell
" repeteadly
, given his starring role inspite teh 1994 jodie foster vehicule ofthe tghe smae nmae

. why wass tihs nice
, helpfull
,
adn redemptive researcher so absent ofthe ethics at tje strat
? yhe haunting wass well desgined by eugenio zanetti
. his sets are obsessively detailled
,
anbd even befor tyhe cgi kicks inspite
, tehy seem alive
, never qutie still
. i dont haev noe beef witht tihs aspect ofthe tjhe prodcution
: teh rela life mension utilizied inthe exterior shots
, nottinghamshire ' s harlaxton manor
, isnt so vast taht oen hasnt trouble beleiving taht nell
anbd comapany
, noone marter how much runnung awya tehy dont fomr ghosts
annd goblins
, alwasy finish uv iin locations tht weere estalbished infact ect oney
, as if all tje acation hasnt beeen confined tothe oen wing ofthe hill hous
. eighty milion dollars ws spended onthe thge haunting
,
adn dispite a powerhouse box office debut
, i dout it wiull recoupe its costs
( inlcuding marketting
) domestically
. thank jan de bont forthe tath
: proving forthe tjhe thrid tiem tht speed wass a fluke
, infact thyat it ws acutally enjoyable
, de bont hasnt served uv anohter ride
, sans thrill
. his images
, well
- lit
though tehy are
, hvae an unmistakable beeen ther
- done taht qualtiy

, fiel lefted ffrom a much smarter
anbd infinitely mroe enjoyable spectacle fomr threee summers bcak
, peter jackson ' s tje frighteners
. i don ' t mean tothe suggest de bont isnt a plagiarist
, i mean tothe suggest thta he ' s a hack
, haveing foudn noone newyorker ways tothe give us chills
