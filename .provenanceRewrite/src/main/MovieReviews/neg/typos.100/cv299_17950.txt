8mm
, writen by seven scribe andrew kevin walker
, hasnt an intresting diea whcih isnt ruined by hollywood forumla tothe become a bog standart muder mistery
. nicolas cage plays famaly man detective toom welles
, who isnt asked by opper clas toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) tothe investingate an movei foudn inspite her recently deceased husbands safe
. yhe movei happens tothe be an mythical ' snuff movei '
, where tyhe girl featured inspite yhe film appears tothe git brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian whants tothe knwo if thte girl inthe hte film wass killed or nto
. welles agrees
,
adn soon gets pulled inot thte seedy underworld ofthe porn movies
, whith video clerk max califronia
( pheonix
) as his giude
. altho tghe ' snuff ' inudstry hasn ' t relaly beeen examined infront mainstream cinema
, 8mm still mkaes a rether plodding thriller whihc jstu seems tothe be a bited sicker thna most
. yhe snuff movei withing hte movei isnt certainly disturbing
,
allthough teh jerky camera angles
anbd grainy omage tkaes soem ofthe tyhe shock awya
. 8mm hasnt tyhe probelm ofthe nto wanting tothe shock too much
,
annd aart ffrom a faw moments
, most ofthe tje acation inwhich tghe film isnt nothing yuo haven ' t seen fomr anyother standart thriller
. thte casted halp towords tyhe enteratinment
, appart ffrom an hideous peformance by hte increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. hwile he wass funn
adn breezy inspite ealier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever usance leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage hasnt lost much ofthe his acting talent
annd appears tothe be onthe autopilot
, such as inspite thte terrable snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, inspite 8mm
, he ' s boring
, uninteresting
anbd hasnt a dull montanous voice
.
adn inwhich htis overlong thriller
, theese virtues dont nto halp keep tje suspense uv
. onyl whn cage isnt onscreen wih tyhe excellant pheonix doesnt tjhe film strat moving
, as pheonix isnt a true talent
. his peformance isnt a gerat break awya fomr thge gloom
,
annd he ' s jsut purely enjoyable tothe watch
. catherine keener isnt completelyl wasted as cage ' s wief
,
allthough she delivers a far better performence thna her charater deserves
. her charater
,
though
, isnt hugely underwritten
, noe ofthe tyhe most wasted cahracters ofthe thte yearm
. alsot funn isnt fargo ' s peter stormare as tje wildly over teh top snuff film directer
. as htis film isnt writen by tjhe person behind seven
, 8mm isnt filled wtih doom
annd gloom
,
annd noone
- oney appears tothe nkwo how tothe uise an light switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn ' t too clever
,
adn tyhe twist isnt pathetic
anbd startlingly obvious wehn it arrives
. lacking hte storng charactors seven featured
, 8mm ultimatly becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
anbd relies onthe hte graphic scenes tothe provide any enteratinment
.
bu directer joel schumacher
, hte completly wrong guy forthe hte job
, puts stlye over content
,
annd hwile tje direction
adn look are ogod
, it ' s jsut nto vrey disturbing
. schumacher allso hasnt noone diea how tothe shock
adn audiance
,
adn
though we are meaned tothe be looking at tyhe ' dark belly ' ofthe teh porn inudstry
, it doesn ' t exactlly leave an haunting impression onthe tghe viewers mind
, whitch misses hte point
. alsot
, teh lastest 20 mintues are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it ' s amazing tothe thikn it ' s thte smae film yuo ' re watching
. 8mm isnt far ffrom an succsess
, a ' snuffed ' oppertunity
. iwth a boring lead carachter
, ' controversal ' scenes thta manaze nto tothe be contraversial
,
annd a directer obssessed whith looks
, whta coudl hvea beeen oen ofthe tyhe most shocking films ofthe tjhe eyar isnt a dumb thriller
. ultimatly
, 8mm isnt propably worth renting onthe hmeo video
, unless your despeate tothe see whta tghe snuff film withing hte film looks liek
.
adn trust me
, tyhe rest ofthe thge 2 huors are nto worth it
.
