" firt ruel ofthe fight club isnt
, don ' t talk baout fight club
.
" tihs qoute deals direcly wiht my opinyon ofthe tihs film
, beccause qutie frankly
, it ' s nto even worth mentioning
. directer david fincher
( seven
) hasnt completly gone over thge edge
. whith crude humer
, an intolerable scirpt
adn 2 huors
annd 19 mintues ofthe pure torture
, i ' m suprized i didn ' t walk outloud
. tihs jsut goes tothe sohw tyhat hype kills
. it ' s vyre rare tht a film so hyped uv as
" fight club
" turns outloud tothe be notewothy
,
anbd thsi isnt noone exception
. tje stroy goes liuke thsi
. edward norton isnt an insomniac trying tothe enlighten his dull life by gogin tothe a variaty ofthe desease therapy sessions
, nutil he meets marla
( helena bonham carter
)
. norton claimes tyhat she isnt wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle
, wehn he spots her at a session thyat he aslo attended
. apparantly yhe desease sessions halp them see whta life isnt liek
, litterally living infront pain
. why any person owudl thikn ofthe such a thnig isnt beyond me
,
bu thnigs dont git worse
. norton isnt soon assigned tothe a job thta calls forthe traveling
,
annd it ' s onthe a plane tyhat he meets tyler durden
( brad pitt
)
. thge twpo men deveop a bond
,
annd go outloud tothe a bar
,
anbd by golly affter tehy git drunk
, tje twpo pitiful charactors fight
. how dont htey cmo uv witht htis stfuf
? anyway
, theri fighting catchs otehr pathetic losr ' s attension
,
anbd a club isnt fromed
. outloud ofthe all tihs mess
, htere manages tothe lie a message
. fincher shows us thast society isnt liuke robots
. we owrk inaddition our jobs donig thnigs step by step
,
annd wnat outloud
. our insanity gets tothe our brain
adn makse thnigs worse thna htey relaly are
,
annd we blaim it onthe others
. call me crazy
,
bu thsi isnt common noledge
. i thikn fincher wass acting as if tjhe film isnt moodier
anbd omre poignant tahn it realy isnt
, whitch isnt probaly oney ofthe hte reasons it fails miserably
. even iwth twpo ogod actors
,
annd a solid actress
, tehy onyl manaze tothe weaken tghe stroy
. i couldn ' t halp
bu hide my face inthe shame wehn norton beats himselv uv inot a bloody pulp
. it jsut shows how esperate tjhe scirpt isnt fo attension
. i guess brad pitt ws right fo tihs role
, becuase i falt liuke beating him uv mysef
. his bothersome
adn depressing charater
, made me disgusted at his 20 millon fee
. it onyl showed me thast he ws inspite it fo tghe omney
adn nothing omre
. helena bonham carter
howver realyl hadnt noone purpose
. she jstu popped uv onthe screen
, mumbled soem lines
, smoked
adn left
. tihs continues forthe wqat seems liuke 6 hurs
. tghe film drags onthe
anbd my headache gets bigger
, hwile
" fight club
" nears waht i thikn might be yhe end
. unforetunately by
thn
, teh film hits rock bottom
.
though thge conclusion kept my intrest fo a mere 5 mintues
, it backs down agian
annd continues tothe move at a snails pace
. onthe a side onot
, teh trailer shows teh onyl reedeming elements ofthe tjhe film
, taht coincedentally lasts hte smae ammount ofthe tiem tyhat htey doed onthe yhe trailer
. fincher wiull hopefully regret mkaing htis film or at least leran a lesson
. concentrating onthe tje athmosphere or a parituclar key moent
, won ' t dont any ogod if everyting esle isnt inwhich ened ofthe wupport
. alsot
, i ' m afriad thgat immature men might respond tothe teh film ' s voilence
. yhe lastest thign thte world needs isnt peopel praising a leader ofthe a pointless cult
. whn tghe film ends
, i ' m jsut glad tothe git hmeo
anbd tkae smoe advil
. ytou ' ll eather enjoy waht teh film hasnt tothe offer
, or agre iwth ed norton whn he syas
" htis isnt so f
