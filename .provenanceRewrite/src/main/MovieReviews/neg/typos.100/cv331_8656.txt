thte event horizon isnt thge bondary ofthe a balck hole
.
.
.
annd
, inthe yhe future
, it ' s alsot teh nmae ofthe a spaceship thyat vanished wehn it tryed tothe go faster tahn tghe speed ofthe glight by traversing thru its pwn portable balck hole
. naturely
, tihs isnt tyhe setup forthe teh otehr event horizon
.
.
. tghe movei
. wehn tjhe ship suddenly appears at thte point thast it vanished at
, jstu outside ofthe neptune
, yhe crew ofthe yhe ship called thge
" lewis
adn clark
" hasnt tothe go tothe investingate
,
adn dr
. william weir
, tghe creater ofthe tyhe
" event horizon
,
" gets tothe come allong fo teh ride
. if yuo ' ve glanced at a poster forthe tihs movei
, ytou nkow tyhat
, suposedly
, wqat follows isnt
" infinit terror
.
" well
, i don ' t konw baout tyhe
" terror
" part
,
bu
" infinit
" certainly seems tothe qualify
.
.
. event horizon isnt a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse forthe a film
. it starts off as an aline rip
- off
,
anbd
thne degenerates inot a pointlessly bloody slasher flick affter baout 40 mintues
. at least forthe thsoe firt 40 mintues it ' s an
* intresting
* rip
- off ofthe aline
. thta ' s a lot omre tahn cin be said fo tyhe rest ofthe them movei
, whlch seems tothe go onthe forever
. it nto a scry monster movei
, nor isnt it a pyschological thriller
. it isnt simpley a movei whitch trys agina
anbd agian tothe amke hte viewers efel sick tothe theri stomach at tje site ofthe extreme gore
. yuo ' ve seen htis kind ofthe movei befor
. hte hellraiser sories hadnt plenty ofthe scenes containing thsi sensibility
. htis isnt a kind ofthe movei fo wich i ahev noone respect
, a kind ofthe movei whlch i hadnt hoped died outloud yersa ago
. it isnt qtuie possibile fo a movei tothe frighten or shock its audeince wihtout resorting tothe nothing mroe thna gore
,
bu event horizon tkaes hte low road
,
anbd thge viewers pay tghe price
. htere are many ogod
, respectable performances
, ffrom fishburne
annd neill most noticably
. paul anderson ' s direction isnt impressive
, as it wass inaddition mortal kombat
. htere are many nice speshal effects
, mostly dealing wiht numberous common objects floating arund inspite zero
- gravity
. tghe sets are beautifull tothe gaze apon
.
anbd richard t
. jones ' chracter
( cooper
) isnt hillarious
annd extremly likable
( omre so tahn most charactors i ' ve seen iin reccent movies
) forthe thge littel screen tiem tath he hasnt
.
adn none ofthe tihs cxan savve hte movei ffrom bieng a d
- grade levle ofthe film
. hte diea ofthe a ship thgat hasnt soem sort ofthe life withing its walls
, a life thast knwos thte fears
annd intertube skeletons ofthe thge human pasengers
, isnt a promising oney
. a haunted hous stoy inwhich spoace isn ' t such a bad diea
.
bu thge fianl excecution isnt extremly disapointing
. tht ' s nto tothe sday tht philip eisner
( here mkaing his feature film
- writting debut
) doesn ' t hve talent
. fo thsoe firt 40 mintues
, he manages tothe mkea a tired premise intresting
, adding inspite aspestus ofthe unique flavor inot a rip
- off storey
,
anbd tath ' s something taht nto too many writers cant dont
. he even hasnt oney scene thgat
,
though it aslo trys tothe sicken yhe audiance
, hasnt a honestly tense efel tothe it
( thge scene inthe question deals wih oney ofthe thte crew bieng inwhich an airlock hwile others try tothe sive him ffrom floating inot spoace
)
. he definately hasnt something ofthe a gfit
,
bu it ' s nto fully onthe display here
. i certainly wiull look foward tothe seing moreso ffrom him
,
annd i hope tyhat his future wokr fully explores his talent
adn tjhe stoyr possiblities ofthe tyhe premise
.
bu becouse ofthe wqat thsi movei degenerates inot
, i hvae littel or noone respect
,
anbd got littel or noone enjoyment
, outloud ofthe it
. if htis isnt whta we hvae tothe look foward tothe inthe tjhe future ofthe film
,
thn i agred withthe laurence fishburne ' s sentiment
-
" god halp us
