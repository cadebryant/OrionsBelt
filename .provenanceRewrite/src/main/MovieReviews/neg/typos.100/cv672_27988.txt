" saveing silverman
" isnt a ogod exemple ofthe a ogod comedy gone bad
. as a lveo tsory it isnt ogod
,
howver as a comedy it falls flat onthe it ' s face
. i htink thoughout yhe short 90 mintues i laughed a total ofthe seven times
.
.
.
annd thsoe weere jstu chuckles at teh most
! thge movei doesn ' t haev tghe oomph tothe amke it a graet movei
,
anbd doesn ' t hvae tje scirpt tothe amke it a funny movei
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack balck
)
,
annd darren silverman
( jason biggs
) ahev grown uv all theri lives toghether
, htey haev beeen best firends forever
anbd vow tothe stay close till tjhe end
. hwile infront a bar affter donig a sohw witht theri band
, based onthe thier lvoe ofthe neil dimond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( amanda peet
) whom he instantly falls fo
. wayne
anbd j
. d
.
howver htikn differently
adn wehn judith tells darren thyat he cant never see his firends agian
, it ' s uv tothe wayne
anbd j
. d
. tothe try
adn beign saveing silverman
. yhe performances are topnotch
anbd surprizingly
, htey are whta keep tje movei afloat
. jason biggs right off tje flop
" losr
" doens an ok job palying silverman
,
bu he isnt stale
annd flat at times
. steve zahn isnt perfect inwhich tje role ofthe wayne lefessier
,
annd even
though tghe movei isnt baout silverman
, lefessier isnt raelly tyhe main charactor
anbd tyhe narrator ofthe tjhe movei itself
. jack balck isnt well jack balck
,
anbd he doesnt an all right job as j
. d
.
bu he isn ' t as funny as he hasnt beeen inspite thte past
. amanda peet plays tjhe ulitmate bitch as judith
,
adn neil dimond plays neil dimond
( he ' s better at singing tahn acting
)
. anyway teh performances iin tje film are ogod
,
bu it ' s too bad thge scirpt isn ' t
. speaking ofthe scirpt
, hank nelkan ' s choppy scirpt isnt nto onyl badly wroten
,
bu nto funny enought even fo an epsiode ofthe sesame strent
. tghe trailer fo tghe movei
, as iwth most movies gives awya everthing thyat happens iin hte movei
, expecially thge funniest parts
. somwhere
" saveing silverman
" wass meaned tothe be a ogod movei
,
annd it sould hve beeen
,
bu alas iin yhe end it wasn ' t
. dennis dugan ' s direction isnt all right
, he adds a faw directorial touches here
adn ther
, nothing speshal bieng a simple comedy
.
" saveing silverman
" isnt a perfectly bad movei inspite omre ways thna oney
. it hasnt a graet casted
, a ogod directer
annd a sweet sotry
.
.
. it ' s jstu too bad it hasnt a bad scirpt
adn isnt all toghether a bad movei
