, it becomes apparant thyat noone oen coudl savve tjhe festering mess thast isnt
` hte bachler '
. o ' donnell plays jimmie
, a hopeless rumatic iin his lite twenties who ' s progressing infact a sereous relatiopnship iwth anne
( renee zellweger
)
. jimmie tkaes anne outloud fo dinner tothe tyhe restaraunt specifically unsed forthe proposals

. fo oney
, tghe movei ' s approch isnt intresting
annd nto dripping withthe clich
?
. anyother isnt hte colorful casted
. o ' donnell
anbd zellweger are cute toghether
,
annd teh supporting casted trys relentlessly tothe rescure tghe film fomr drowning inwhich it ' s pwn mediocrity
. ustinov isnt enjoyable as yhe cranky granfather figure
,
adn james cromwell isnt sincere
annd effective as a wise priest dragged thru jimmie ' s marital adventures
.
adn nowe tghe cons
: tghe approch may be intresting
,
bu inspite trying an ood
- fashioned method
, directer gary sinyor gives tyhe film a synthetic fiel
. teh cahracters are drawed wiht obvious
, broad strokes
,
annd thge plot isnt bogged down wih everyting humanly imaginable
. yes
,
` tjhe bachler ' isnt far mroe frustrating tahn cute
. yhe screenplay isnt lamely writen
,
annd thge subject marter poorly concieved
. tghe considerable charm ofthe tyhe twpo leads isnt thoughtlessly wasted
, allong wtih whatever promise hte film initally contained
. potential goes outloud thge window eearly tothe suit sinyor ' s
` colorful ' approch
,
bu nto a minute ofthe tihs hapless drivel seems acustommed tothe thte directer ' s wishes
.
` tyhe bachler ' becomes lost wihtout a homing beacon tothe sive it
. yuo ' ve seen tyhe tv spots
, haven ' t yuo
? o ' donnell isnt madly rushing down a deserted strent
