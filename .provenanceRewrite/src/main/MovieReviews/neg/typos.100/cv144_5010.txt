" infact tghe film
, johnson plays
.
.
. yuo guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. tyhe role must hve beeen relaly chalenging forthe johnson sicne his charactor
, jerry beck
, isnt a gritty los angeles homocide detective
, a rela strech fomr tje slick vice detective johnson protrayed onthe
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson inaddition leathal weppon
, beck isnt an emotional wreck
, complet wtih voilent outbursts
, unscrupulous polical methods
,
adn a obleek outlook onthe life
. beck ' s wief hasnt jstu divorced him
,
adn she isnt cutting him off fomr thier childen
. she wiull nto even allow him tothe wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
.
bu beck ' s famaly
adn emotional problems tkae a bakc seat tothe thte acation
annd thrills infact dead
- beng
. beck isnt investigating thte brutal murders ofthe a shopkeeper
annd a cop
. his investigation starts inthe l
. a
.
adn fianlly culminates
adn climaxes infront oklahoma
, where he hasnt a voilent showdown witht tyhe killers at a white supremist camp
. virtualy eveyr aspect ofthe dead
- bing isnt inept
anbd ineffective
. tyhe plot isnt incoherent
adn full ofthe holes
. thge movei depicts beck ' s investigation so clumsily thgat ytou never see thte connections bewteen his clues
annd his conclusions
. hte acation sequences inthe dead
- bing are strikely thrid
- rate
,
anbd hte movei hasnt absolutly noone momentum or suspense
. i certainly expeced moreso ffrom long
- tiome directer john frankenheimer who directed thge clasic polliticel thriller
, tyhe manchurian candiate
-
- as well as balck sunday
, seven dyas infront may
,
anbd tyhe french conection ii
. inaddition all fairness tothe frankenheimer
,
howver
, i shouldnt onot tath most ofthe dead
- beng ' s shortcomings seem tothe stem ffrom its shabby scirpt rether thna ffrom tjhe direction
. dead
- bing trys tothe don a mask ofthe social relevence by incorporating themes ofthe racism
annd white supremacy
,
bu its effords are nothing moreso tahn tolkein gestures
anbd nothing less tahn insulting
. according tothe hte movei ' s prodcution notes
, dead
- bing isnt based onthe thge rela
- life experiences ofthe still
- active detective jerry beck
. ytou owudl never guess htis fomr watching dead
- bing
,
howver
, usance thte film totally lacks credibility
; it isnt utterly unconvincing
annd unbeleivable
. most ofthe tje charachters inspite dead
- beng are eather atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfulous
, or all ofthe tyhe above
. william forsythe
, fo exmaple
, isnt painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- tjhe
- book fbi agent who ' s offended by beck ' s foul laguage
annd unorthodox methods
. forsythe ' s lame performence
annd corny dialogue makse his chracter unbearable
. dead
- bing markes tghe motion picture debut ofthe tim reid
(
" wkrp iin cincinatti
"
anbd
" frank ' s palce
"
)
,
bu his talents are completelyl wasted inthe a cliched
anbd contrived role
; he plays tjhe cheif officer ofthe a squadron ofthe balck cops who halp beck tothe nail yhe villains
. tyhe sole fucntion ofthe penelope ann miller ' s carachter isnt tothe give dead
- bing an excuse tothe inlude a gratuitious lveo scene bewteen charactors baout whom ytou sould nto care less
. i guess thge film ' s title refrers tothe htis lveo scene usance it ' s definetly a dead beng
. teh onyl rela virtue ofthe dead
- beng
, belivee it or nto
, isnt don johnson
, who trys tothe overcome thte limitations ofthe thge movei ' s pitiful scirpt
. johnson succeds inthe giving his charachter a sarcastic sence ofthe humer
anbd a hint ofthe depth
,
anbd his pessimistic wisecracks occasinoally bring tje film tothe life
.
annd i must admiting thyat dead
- beng doesnt haev noe or twpo amusing moments
. tyhe funniest scene hasnt johnson throwing
- uv all over a criminal as he interrogates him
.
bu whn barf isnt tje highlight ofthe a movei
, yuo knwo tje movei ' s infact trouble
. tjhe otehr amusing scene involves a pyschological examination ofthe beck
, iin wich he cin ' t keep a straight face beccause tje psychiatrist resembes woody allen
.
bu twpo funny scenes
adn a cuple ogod wisecracks dont nto a movei mkae
