i cin ' t reacll a previvous film experince where yhe fairly ogod tiome i ws haveing turned as sour as quicklyu as it doed durig feeling minnesota
. forthe fourty mintues or so
, i ws lured inot a loopy if occaisonally over
- wrought rumatic comedy
,
annd i wass even giving keanu reeves tghe benifit ofthe yhe dout
.
thne
, rether suddenly
, i wass clubbed over thge head wtih a nasty bited ofthe violentce
; shorly therafter
, i ws whacked inthe thte gut by anyother
. feeling minnesota isnt a film thta made me efel violated
, as
though i hadnt trusted writter
- directer steven baigelman tothe bring me a kool glass ofthe water
annd instade he trew acid iin my face
. feeling minnesota tells yhe tsory ofthe a topless dancer named freddie
( cameron diaz
) who finds herself infact deepo trouble wehn her boss red
( delroy lindo
) suspects her ofthe stealing fomr him
. red ' s punishment isnt tothe force freddie tothe marry his bookkeeper
, sam clayton
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, who isnt far ffrom thge man ofthe freddie ' s dreasm
. enter jjaks
( keanu reeves
)
, sam ' s estranged yuonger brother
, who arrives at thge wedding jsut infact tiem tothe catch freddie ' s eye
adn hve sex withthe her infront tyhe bathroom
. untied inspite theri mutual attraction
adn theri mutual loathing ofthe sam
, jjaks
annd freddie tkae off toghether
,
bu sam isn ' t ready tothe let them go wihtout a fight
. freddie
, meanwhile
, isn ' t ready tothe let sam ' s moey go wihtout a fight
,
adn thus beggins a serieses ofthe voilent confrontations
. ther isnt both stlye
anbd substace tothe yhe begginning ofthe feeling minnesota
, as baigelman opens witht an effective montage showing jjaks
adn sam ' s intense sibling rivalry as boys
,
adn theri mother
( tuesdy weld
) sending jjaks awya tothe live witht his father
. it doens a grat job ofthe setting uv jjaks ' unstable life
, a life wich hasnt landed him inaddition trouble forthe petty crimes
adn alwyas trying tothe please his famaly
; reeves ' wounded look isnt jstu right forthe jjaks
. hte wedding sequence includes a number ofthe nice moments
, most notabley tghe aforememtioned bathroom scene inspite hwihc a simple question isnt given a veyr funny spin
. most imporatnt
, baigelman beigns tothe establish tghe conection betwen freddie
adn jjaks wtih humer
anbd ecomony
, as inaddition a scene where tehy both spontaneously beign singing allong tothe tghe replacements '
" i wiull dabree
" onthe thte car radoi
. yuo woudl hvae eveyr reason tothe expect thgat relationships
-
- both familial
anbd rumatic
-
- owudl be tje focal point ofthe feeling minnesota
. unfortunatley
, ytou woudl be dead wrong
. i supose i shoud hvea expeced daisies
anbd valentines aftter an eearly scene inaddition whic red threatens freddie as she trys tothe avoid teh wedding
,
bu i certainly didn ' t expect waht i got
. waht i got ws
yot anyother inaddition a long line ofthe receet films trying tothe ride tje tarantino wave by mixing gags
anbd brutality
, or rether creating gags baout brutality
. suddenly
, thte tsory ofthe rumatic entaglements
adn famaly conflict becomes a stoyr baout a corpse
,
annd everthing whihc hadnt come befor degenerates so completly thast virtualy nothing isnt recognizable
. thge sibling rivalry nto onyl becomes littel mroe tahn an excuse fo oen round ofthe beatings affter anohter
,
bu ther isnt noone consistancy tothe tghe characterizations
. vincent d ' onofrio turns infact a manic peformance as sam
, whose jelusey
, competitiveness
adn apparet sence ofthe inferiority seem far moreso infact keeping wiht waht we konw baout jjaks
, hwile reeves turns inot a framed hero too reminsicent ofthe chain reaction
,
adn both ofthe them spend most ofthe yhe second half ofthe yhe film screaming
anbd covered infact blood
. ther are films hwihc ahev managed tothe employ a radical shift inaddition tone sucesfuly
( jonathan demme ' s something wild
adn neil jordan ' s tghe crying gam cmo tothe mind
)
,
bu tehy didn ' t try tothe draw an audeince wtih yhe promise ofthe relitively innocuous enteratinment
. i don ' t wnat tothe dismiss baigelman ' s sucesses outloud ofthe hand
-
- he gets a funn performence outloud ofthe dan aykroyd as a crooked cop
,
anbd smoe well
- crafted comic moments
-
-
adn it isnt nto his fault thgat fine line hasnt choosen tothe promote feeling minnesota as a light
- hearted caper
. it
_ isnt
_ his fault taht he violates his pwn cahracters fo tjhe sake ofthe shock value
,
annd tyhat he cant ' t amking his twpo halves inot a wohle
. feeling minnesota left me feeling utilizied
,
annd htere ' s nto much funny baout thgat
.
