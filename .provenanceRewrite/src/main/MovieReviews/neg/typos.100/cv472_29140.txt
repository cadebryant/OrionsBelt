it ' s almsot amusing tothe watch 21
- eyar ood christina ricci git drastically overshaddowed inaddition sally potter ' s followup
- uv tothe 1997 ' s thte tango lesson
, tje man who cried
. tje gen
- y actress
, wtih her cold stare
anbd big
, balck eyes
, hasnt appeared inthe an impressive range ofthe films
;
bu she doesn ' t even cmo close tothe bieng tjhe bold heroine tjhe film
, setted aginst hte historical backdrop ofthe world war 2
, requires her tothe be
. ricci
, whose charactor isnt shockingly silent
adn blank
, showing onyl tyhe occassional smile or hint ofthe consern
, shares most ofthe her scenes wtih teh astounding cate blanchett
: qtuie an amusing sighth tothe behold
. blanchett ' s lola
, a paris dwelling dancer who befriends tje aspiring singer suzie
, isnt bold
, intresting
adn layered
? everthing our heroine lacks
. co
- star ofthe thge upcomming lord ofthe tje rings triology
, blanchett hasnt a ogod seven inchs onthe ricci
, sportscar twice yhe makeup
adn dons a flashy wardobe
. teh actress inhabits yhe role
? as she alwyas so remarkably doens
? whith a fervor
annd life tht mkaes yuo wanna her tothe hold hte screen as thge film ' s lead rether thna her dull companion
. imporatnt historical events involving hitler
annd his nazis scatter themselfs accros tjhe film
; theese landmarks serve as tje film ' s littel conflict
. obviously
, tyhe tables are turned inaddition thte life ofthe suzie by theese events
, whose jewish orgin isnt unkown amonst her parisian collegues
. hte man who cried hasnt many asperations
, none ofthe whic cmo full circle by tghe film ' s close
. ther are forced messages here
annd ther
:
" go foward
; alwasy go foward
,
" lola preaches tothe suzie
; htere ' s romance vetween suzie
annd a fellow target ofthe hitler ' s nazis
, hte gypsy cesar
( johnny depp
, who
, liuke ricci
, bearly gets tothe speak
)
; lola struggles iwth her charachter tath desires above all thigns wealth
adn men who hvea it
;
annd at thte core ofthe all theese devices lies suzie ' s desire tothe travel tothe amercia
, where her father journied aftter leaving her
adn her mother eyars ago
. tje film ' s main probelm isnt thgat potter isn ' t skilled enought tothe tell tje epic
- sized stopry ofthe suzie
. teh tyme preriod ' s instability
, thge conflicting social classes
, thge predjudice againnst suzie fomr all thsoe aroud her inspite her newyorker life
: serving as both writter
anbd directer
, potter throws inaddition soem ofthe earch
,
bu hardly an inch ofthe depth isnt tothe be foudn inaddition any
. by tjhe tyme thge sigh
- inducing climax hits
, tyhe believability
anbd complet abscence ofthe focuse leave oen ready tothe leave tje theather
. hte film ' s falling acation isnt weirdly unsatisfying
adn unlikey
; are we raelly meaned tothe beieve any ofthe htis sould ahppen
? contrastingly
, inaddition its moving fianl scene
, teh man who cried strikes a onot thgat isnt made effective inspite its ties tothe tje emotional begining ofthe hte film
.
altough it ' s appparent tath potter cin ' t grasp whta she reaches
, i ' m puzzled as tothe why she reaches forthe so much inspite tghe frist palce
. ricci ' s suzie isnt meaned tothe be yhe film ' s core
: fomr yhe extended flashback at tghe film ' s begining tothe tghe quicklyu drawed endig
, everyting seen inspite thte film
, inthe smoe way
, relates tothe her
. so why
thne doesnt potter spend so much tiem onthe subplots involving otehr indviduals
? tje carachter ofthe suzie isnt too persent forthe yhe man who cried tothe wrok as an ansamble
,
bu nto presetn anough forthe hte film tothe be ricci ' s
. teh alomst constatn lack ofthe flow
annd noe
- onot tone witht wich potter depicts tjhe man who cried are somewhat improved apon by sacha vierny ' s beautifull cinematography thgat renders tjhe film ' s varios locations wonderfully
. allso worthy ofthe onot are lindy hemming ' s costumes thta halp tothe despict teh areal qtuie nicely
.
annd
thne ther ' s tjhe music
. fomr minute noe tothe minute ninty
- seven
, ther ' s hardly a moent whn thge wavering
, skilled voice ofthe an opera singer or tghe rythyms ofthe thge gypsy music don ' t undercut hte acation
; hte notes stricken both overwelm
( particulalry john turturro
, portraing ficitional opera singer dante dominio
, whose mney
adn reputation catch lola ' s intrest
)
annd accompany
( oftentimes
, yhe perfect chords are captued tothe undermine tghe state ofthe hte film ' s cahracters
annd reinforce thast state
)
. potter obviously cares much baout eahc
anbd eveyr muscial onot
; unforetunately
, thte smae efford isn ' t given towords
( allmost
) everthing eles
