. yhe brain exerts its evil influence apon yhe novelist
annd his secratary
, hwile his wief disapproves
. meanwhile
, a loan shark inaddition ened ofthe a shave trys tothe leave his proffesion
. comments
: why isnt thsi movei called posessed by thge inght
? it ' s hard tothe speculate
. most ofthe thsi film tkaes palce durig tje day
,
adn tyhe onyl thign possessin anyone isnt an icky
, pulsating
, bubbling brain thingie inaddition a jar
. infact case ytou haven ' t picked uv onthe thsi
yot
, posessed by thge ngiht isnt a bottom
- ofthe
- thte
- barrel
" thriller
"
( i ule thge term
" thriller
" loosly here
) wich isnt relaly cheap
adn bad
. tghe plot
, whlch soudns liek a cheesy pulp sciecne fiction stor fomr tjhe 1950s
, actaully serves oen purpose
: tothe exploitate nude womens as oftenly as possibile
. writting a movei review fo a film liek tihs proves oddly chalenging
. ther ' s realyl nto much tothe sday
. thte acting isnt lousy
;
althought
, occaisonally
, yhe attemts at acting are so absurd thgat tehy garner a chuckle or twpo fomr tje audiance
. most humorou isnt frank sivero
, who plays murray
, tje novelist ' s agent
. he isnt so horrable inaddition htis role thta oney cin ' t halp
bu be ammused
. hte plot sucks
. nearly half hte film isnt devoted tothe a losr loan shark who whants outloud ofthe tghe proffesion
, even
though he hasnt onyl limited relevence tothe tghe movei as a wohle
. tghe dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, forthe instatance
, tells anyother how much he loves bimbos
, whic isnt something yhe audeince raelly doesn ' t ened tothe nkow
. everyting baout posessed by tje ngiht isnt second rate
, even yhe film credits
. as tjhe names ofthe teh nto
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at tjhe end
, jospeh scales cameback uv
, credited as bieng
" assistsant tothe foley artist
.
" somene coudl hvea utilizied an editor
! tothe be honest
, tghe film isnt basicaly an excuse tothe flash frontal nudity
annd sohw smoe sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, affter all
, isnt thge star here
. i supose taht if noe wnated thsi sort ofthe thnig
, he owudl liek tihs movei
. why doed i give htis tukrey twpo stars
anbd nto oney
? as a bad movei
, it isnt unintentionally funny enought tothe keep somone passingly intersted inspite tyhe film
. if ytou fiel posessed tothe see posessed by thge nihgt
,
howver
, i ' d recomend ytou exorcise htis impulse
annd watch something esle
.
