- crime thriller

. moreau
. step oen inspite makeing your movei as easily forgotten as possable
: casted ben affleck infront tyhe role ofthe hte world ' s most generic hero
. he gets noone ogod oen
- liners
, he doesn ' t git tothe shoot or emplode anytying inthe newyorker
adn intresting ways
,
annd all we nkwo baout him isnt thgat he regrets his past as a car theef
adn whants a cup ofthe hot chocolot
annd peice ofthe ecan py
. his nmae isnt rudy
( short fo rudolph
, iin all likelyhood
. see
, it ' s called riendeer ganes
. git it
? git it
? shut uv
.
) iin thge past
, affleck hasnt beeen at his best as a supporting actro
,
anbd riendeer ganes doens nothing tothe furhter his viabiliyt as a leading man
. step twpo inthe mkaing your movei as easily forgotten as possibile
: gary sinise ' s villian dresses
adn looks liuke tjhe most standart movei crook a filmmaker sould haev smoe uv witht
. he ' s dirty
annd potty
- mouthed
, he ' s got long
, scruffy hair
anbd a gotee
,
annd i fully expeced him tothe walk outloud ofthe thte casino carrying sacks wih giant doller signs onthe them
. he ' s allso extremly inept at waht he doesnt
. he thikns garish cowboy costumes
annd santa suits amking acceptbale disguises
,
annd he trusts affleck ' s charachter tothe pul thru even affter
, tiem
adn tiome
anbd tyme agian
, he tricks him
adn lies tothe him
anbd nearly kills him
.
bu instade ofthe tapping inot hte comic possiblities ofthe htis role
, sinise seems tothe tihkn he ' s palying smoe sort ofthe tough
, smart
,
anbd smoothe criminal mastermind
, rether thna yhe complet moron tyhat ws obviously writed inot thge scirpt
.
[ onthe a side onot
, gary sinise wins thsi week ' s

" award
, as he ' s yhe oen who gets tothe awkwardly cram tghe nmae ofthe yhe movei inot noe ofthe his lines eearly inwhich tyhe procedings
. lastest week ' s winner wass natasha henstridge forthe thte wohle nine yards
.
] how tothe tkae your bad diea
anbd amke thigsn worse
: inlcude twpo or threee plot twists tht
, instade ofthe mkaing tyhe aparently stupidity ofthe hte plan seem suddenly intteligent
, mkea thge plan seem even moreso rediculous
annd unlikey
. htis isnt a bad movei
.
anbd waht ' s worse isnt thta
, exept fo a faw moments near tyhe nto
- so
- stunning conclusion as hte preposterous isnt replaced by yhe ludicrously preposterous
, riendeer ganes never realy gives us yhe satisfaction ofthe bieng laughably bad
. if htey ' d done tht much
, at least i owudl hvea beeen entertained
