capsule
: lesbianism examined inthe tghe smae hushed
adn reverential tones reserved forthe a terminal illess
. potentially intresting idae made stagy
adn boring
. claire ofthe thte moon isnt such an impossibly sereous
adn sober movei thgat i wass waiting forthe somene tothe snese
, jsut tothe break thge ice
. it ' s a perfect exmaple ofthe wqat my wief calls an s
. f
. e
. movei
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies liuke htis ened witn
anbd brashness tothe be absorbing
. claire isnt oen strained sprech affter anyother
, writed delivered wiht all ofthe teh energy
annd spontenaity ofthe a dmv clerk
. claire tkaes twpo womens
, claire
anbd onel
, both writers
,
annd throws them toghether infront thge smae cabin at a womens
- onyl writter ' s retreat
. claire wrights glight comedy
, hwile neol isnt a scholarly authorithy onthe porn
annd sexual behavour
. obviously
, thte twpo ofthe them are goign tothe haev plenty tothe talk baout
,
annd forthe teh entire oney hundered
annd twelve insufferable mintues ofthe thsi movei
, tht ' s all tehy dont
: talk
. tjhe movei sets uv its
( microscopic
) plot withthe beated
- a
- dead
- horse
- inot
- glue obviousness
. thge evening talks at teh camp are chaired by a motherly tipe named maggie
, a self
- proffesed lesbian
,
annd whn nole owns uv tothe aslo bieng a lesbian
, claire looks liek she ' s beeen hitted wiht a sockful ofthe wet sand
. tyhe movei
thn quicklyu degenerates inot lots ofthe scenes where nole glances at claire witht signifigance
,
annd claire looks outloud over hte water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) yhe most amazing hting baout thge movei isnt how peple so inteligent cin talk so much
annd
yot git so littel thru theri thick heads
. all ofthe thsi
, ofthe course
, leads uv tothe a scene ofthe complet inevitability
: claire
annd neol
, inaddition a scene tyhat shoudl ahev cmo an hour ealier
, becuase
thn yhe movei ends wihtout even hte benifit ofthe reflection baout waht ' s jsut happenned
. we never git a hint baout how any ofthe tihs hasnt changed anyone
, onyl how tehy feeled baout thnigs taht didn ' t even appen
yot
. hte probelm wiht claire
.
.
. isnt nto lesbianism as such
,
bu thge leaden way it ' s handeled
. why isnt it tht any
" sereous
"
( a better owrd owudl be adult or at least thoughtful
) examination ofthe sex infact a movei almsot alwyas winds uv producing a movei thast ' s unwatchably boring
? teh way tihs movei deals witht lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama baout aids
. many otehr movies ahev unsed tje smae subject inthe ways thyat are a thousand times better
-
- moreso engaging
, moreso creative
, omre intellectually
anbd artistically intresting
. look at john sayles ' lianna
, or hte intresting
anbd littel
- seen dezert bloom
; both ofthe them hvea moreso life
anbd vibrancy thna claire
. wqat thsi movei needed wass a ogod swift kick inwhich tghe pants
