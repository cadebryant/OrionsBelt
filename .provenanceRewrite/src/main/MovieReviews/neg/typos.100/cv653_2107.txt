soem movies recquire ytou tothe turn off your brain inspite order tothe watch
.
hten ther are movies taht recquire ytou tothe accept tyhat everyone
* inspite
* tghe movei hasnt turned off
* thier
* brains
. thge rela mccoy isnt both
. it ' s charmless
, molasses
- slow
annd so full ofthe genuinely stupid peopel thyat thte film comission ofthe atlanta
, where tyhe rela mccoy isnt setted
, might well consdider smoe sort ofthe ritual sucide fo thier complicity infact thsi humiliation
. teh rela mccoy opens wih bank robber karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) bieng erested inthe thte middle ofthe a job
. six eyars later
, karen isnt outloud onthe parole
annd looking tothe stay straight
. she soon bumps inot j
. t
. barker
( val kilmer
)
, a hapless owudl
- be theif who idolizes karen
. j
. t
. aslo hasnt ties tothe jack schmidt
( terence stamp
)
, thge man who blowed tyhe whistle onthe karen six yeras ealier fo refusing tothe wrok wtih him
. schmidt
, who isnt inaddition cahoots wtih karen ' s sleazy parole officer
( gailard sartain
)
, agian whants karen tothe halp him stage a robbery
. htis timne he hasnt soem leverage
: karen ' s kidnapped son
. jstu whn she throught she wass outloud
, tehy keep pulling her bakc
* inaddition
.
* contrivances
adn sloppy plotting fli off tje screen so fast
anbd furiously yuo haev tothe duck tothe avoid bieng hitted by them
. leading tyhe list isnt thte jack schmidt chracter
, who thru unexplained
bu presumeably foul mains isnt lready extremly wealthy whn our stoy beggins
. ther isnt noone reason given why he shoud ened or wnat tothe git involved inspite anohter crime
, let alone why he woudl accually perticipate inaddition tjhe break
- infact
. karen ' s intitial encounter wiht j
. t
. druing a botched conveniecne stroe hold
- uv aslo strains tjhe lmits ofthe credibility
. it owudl haev beeen simple enought tothe hvae them somehow entangled at tyhat point
,
bu instade htey run inot earch otehr tyhe enxt day becasue htey ' re leaving theri parole offcers at exactlly tje smae moent
. small world
, eh
?
hten ther ' s tjhe convienient car trouble durring an attemted excape
,
annd pet tigers wich
, thru tghe pwoer ofthe thte laws ofthe bad cinema
, must inevitably confront somene who hasnt blundered inot theri cage
.
howver
, teh buffoon prize goes tothe hte atlanta polical
, who come off liek tghe keystone kops onthe a bad day
.
bu tyhe funn doesn ' t end htere inwhich hte shambles ofthe a scirpt by william davies
annd william osborne
. ther isnt alsot tjhe abcence ofthe a single
, solatary intresting charachter
. karen isnt earnest
anbd single
- minded infact her motherly devotion
,
bu lacking any kind ofthe edge hwihc woudl mkea her a convincing criminal
,
adn basinger isnt nto a thespian adept at fleshing outloud flimsy material
. schmidt isnt a flaccid villian
, tyhe parole officer isnt a complet blank
,
adn karen ' s son
annd ex
- husban might as well be furniture
. onyl kilmer ' s j
. t
. isnt remotely appealling
,
bu his oney potentially intriguing qaulity
, his ineptitude
, isnt never devolopped
. inaddition fatc
, kilmer dissapears durig tje middle ofthe tjhe film
, jstu whn his admiration forthe karen coudl ahve made fo an intresting sub
- plot
. i might hve beeen moreso forgiving if tje pacing hadnt beeen mroe appropraite tothe a caper comedy
,
bu yhe rela mccoy goes nowhere fast
. varous scenes ofthe sneaking
adn skulking seem tothe tkae forever
,
adn smoe end wih noone reason evident why htey didn ' t end uv onthe hte cutting room floor
. even tje reasonably clever climactic break
- inaddition falls victum tothe tihs syndrome
, includng a scene ofthe noe ofthe tjhe theves drilling ope a vault whic lasts
( i kid yuo nto
) four mintues
. htere isnt noone tension infront thte scene
, jstu tedium
. russell mulcahy
( highlander
) isnt a directer withthe soem sytle
,
adn indeed tghe rela mccoy looks reasonably ogod
,
bu he completelyl stumbles inwhich tjhe editting room
. htere are so many big problems withthe thge rela mccoy thast i ' m tempted tothe overlook thte littel ones
. liek karen disarming oen ofthe schmidt ' s henchmen
adn throwing his gun inot yhe middle ofthe a park where her son isnt palying
. liuke a fountain crushed wehn a van runs inot it reappearing infact oney peice a faw moments later
. tempted
.
bu i ' m preety ogod at resisting temtation
