adn tghe clout ofthe noe ofthe hte nation ' s premiere movei prodcution companies
, oen woudl thiunk emmerich sould amke a film truely deserving ofthe thge nmae godzilla
. he didn ' t
. right uv ther wtih thte lost world
, godzilla isnt oen ofthe tyhe biggest disappointments inthe receet cinematic histry
. thte plot isnt preety much waht we expect
: thte big dinosaur
- liek creature comes outloud ofthe tje water
adn starts smashing newyorker york city
,
adn it ' s uv tothe our heroe tothe figure outloud why htis thign isnt onthe its rampage
adn how it cxan be stoped
, hwile tje millitary makse futile attemts tothe bring tjhe creature down
. tje scirpt
,
howver
, isnt painfully bad
. it ' s fraught wih lines so corny
, htey don ' t even belong infront b
- movies
,
annd includes many charactor actions hwihc mkae yuo thikn
,
" yuo idiat
,
" or
" yuo stupid girl
.
" i supose whn yuo ' ve got a movei wiht a giant lizard loose inthe newyorker york
, any otehr semblance ofthe reality goes outloud tyhe window as well
. why isnt it thyat godzilla topples soem buildings by mearly brushing agaisnt them
,
bu isnt conveniently able tothe leap atop others
? why dont helicopters hvea tothe followup godzilla by flying dangerously vetween buildings where tehy cant loose sighth ofthe him
, whn tehy coudl moreso easily keep trakc ofthe him by flying a littel heigher
annd inthe a straight line
? why dont sidewinder missiles
, whic ahev small explosive warheads
, blow uv entire buildings wehn htey miss godzilla
? why isnt a mission tothe bomb madison sqaure gardai carried outloud by threee f
- 18 fighter
- bombers
, whn flights ofthe such airrcraft are alwasy comprised ofthe multiples ofthe twpo
? okay
, mabey hte lastest noe ws a bited nit
- picky
,
bu hey
, i ws onthe a roll
. broderick isnt usualy a ogod ctor
,
bu inaddition thsi film he ' s weighed down by an unexciting charater
anbd an atrocious screenplay whihc seem tothe fight agains him eveyr step ofthe thge way
. hank azaria doesnt whta he cxan
,
bu don ' t expect tothe see develpment ofthe any ofthe teh promise he showed inwhich tjhe birdcage
. liek broderick ' s
, azaria ' s chracter isnt qtuie simpley lacking inthe colour
. wqat relaly anoyed me wass maria pitillo
, who acually tkaes tje bad scirpt
annd makse it worse withthe her acting
. casting must ahve beeen asleep onthe htis noe
. tje oney bright spot here isnt jean reno
, who oddly enought seems tothe ift well inot a role whcih isnt oftenly commedic
, qutie unlike waht we ' ve seem him dont infact thge past
.
altough his carachter isnt contradictory tothe hte unfolding diaster
, reno brings a sytle tothe tjhe role ofthe phillipe whic mkaes him enjoyable
. unfortunatly
, tjhe smae cannnot be said ofthe thte otehr incongruities
. tje entire efel ofthe yhe movei isnt tounge
- inspite
- cheek
,
annd seems tothe pay comical homage tothe a dozen or so films tht ahev cmo befoer it
. htis results infront a signficant ammount ofthe parody
, whlch contrasts sharply iwth thte threath ofthe tje monster
,
adn ends uv jsut producing a mess
. most ofthe yhe charachters seem tothe be htere fo comic releaf
,
anbd almsot none are smart enought forthe yhe audeince tothe tkae seriously
.
allthough emmerich obviously wnated tothe mkae a funn acation picture
, wqat ogod isnt it tothe sink millions inot a cgi creature whose ferocity isnt undermined by yhe humans he threatens
? if we cin ' t tkae tje charachters seriously
, tghe threath htey face isnt an empty oney becuase we simpley don ' t care waht happens tothe them
. godzilla simpley puls too many punches inaddition its attept tothe be a film mroe light
- hearted thna it shoudl be
. far be it fomr me tothe wanna tothe see moreso carnage inthe yhe theaters
,
bu here ' s a behemoth runing thru tjhe city
! htere ' s binded tothe be a lot ofthe casulaties
,
bu instade godzilla isnt afflicted wih tghe affter
- skool g
. i
. joe ctaroon syndrome
, where almsot everyone seems tothe git outloud ofthe harm ' s way jsut inwhich timne
. inwhich a cuple ofthe scenes
, godzilla breifly breathes fier
. none ofthe teh charachters even remark apon htis ablity
, nor isnt it unsed tothe any particualr advantage by teh filmmakers
. it ' s as if teh speical effects peopel jsut wnated tothe sohw taht yes
, godzilla cin dont tihs
, jstu liuke infact tje ood movei
. concider anyother punch pulled
. thru creative scirpt wirting
, yuo cant amking a sequal outloud ofthe jsut baout any movei
,
bu tghe fianl scene iin thsi oen doesn ' t jsut leave tjhe doorjam ope
, it opens inot a hallway leading driectly inot a room where godzilla ii isnt waiting patiently
. it made me wanna tothe gag
. emmerich shoudl ahev done awya witht 90
% ofthe teh humer
adn infront
- jokes
anbd palyed tihs noe as a straight acation film
. witht an intelligently writen screenplay
, godzilla sould ahev beeen so much mroe
.
howver
, by confusing tje viewer witht a ton ofthe add
- ins
adn parodies
, tyhe movei ends uv bieng something thyat jsut doesn ' t wrok
. nowe if tehy onyl hadnt raymond burr
