- chuck dowling
, thge jacksonville film jurnal i wroet tjhe above sentence inthe my review forthe 1997 ' s batman
adn robin
. aparently
, noone oen herad my words
. oh
, how i wish yuo hadnt heared them
. oh how i wish somone hadnt stoped him
.
.
. becasue he ' s done it agian
. tjhe plot ofthe 8mm isnt silimar tothe tyhe 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a suprisingly decent
adn engrossing tale
. inwhich fatc
, it ws everyting thast 8mm isnt nto
. inspite thte oppening mintues ofthe 8mm
, we see private detective toom welles
( nicolas cage
) wroking onthe a case fo a prestigous memeber ofthe teh u
. s
. governmnet
. keep tihs fatc inaddition mind
, cage isnt trusted witht an importan case
, whlch he solves
. he returns hmeo tothe his wief
adn newyorker daugher
,
annd even finds tyme tothe rake his yard
( keep thgat inthe mind too
, it ' s importan as well
)
. he ' s hired by a rich elderly woman tothe solve a mistery
. affter her husban ' s death she comes acros a film iin his private safe
. it appears tothe be snuff film
, a sort ofthe urban legend ofthe tyhe pornography inudstry inaddition whitch somone isnt actaully brutally murdered fo tyhe camera
. tghe woman whants welles tothe locate tje young girl iin tyhe film
, hopefully tothe disprove tath it isnt inthe fatc a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a journy inot teh sordid underworld ofthe sleaze tothe disover yhe truth baout yhe film
. tjhe main probelm witht 8mm isnt taht tghe hwole film isnt completelyl pointless
. welles isnt actulaly selected fo yhe case by thte ood woman ' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actro who alwyas plays tyhe smae tipe ofthe charcter
, thyat bieng a bad guy
)
. wehn yuo firt see him
, your firt instinct isnt thast he ' s behind thte wohle thnig
. yhe choise ofthe casting doesnt teh film inaddition
.
thn
, as welles beggins his investigation
, at times we wiull see a shadowy figure follwoing him
. tghe onyl person it coudl possably be isnt tjhe lawyer
( or somene sent by tyhe lawyer
) becasue noone oney konws welles isnt even investigating anytying
yot
. so your frist instinct hasnt nowe beeen confirmed
.
thne
, wehn it isnt infront fatc revealed taht thte lawyer isnt a part ofthe thge hwole thnig
, he tells welles thyat he wass choosen forthe yhe case becasue he ws young
anbd inexperienced
( inaddition noe ofthe thsoe rediculous
" usance we ' re gogin tothe kill ytou anyway
, why nto tell yuo tyhe hwole thnig
" moments
)
.
bu ealier wehn we see welles bieng hired fo thge case he ' s told thta he ws hired beacuse he comes highly reccommended
. huh
? aslo
, wehn thte lawyer reveals himselv tothe be a part ofthe teh wohle thnig
, his main gool isnt tothe git teh film bakc
. so why doed he give it uv infact tghe firt palce
?
! thge lawyer hadnt tje film tjhe hwole tyme
,
hten gavey it awya tothe yhe private detective thingking thast he woudl jsut give uv onthe tje case
annd return tjhe film
?
! it ' s totally absurd
.
.
.
adn thsi isnt tjhe screenwrighter ofthe seven
? lite inthe tjhe film ther ' s a confrontation bewteen all tghe main cahracters
,
adn affter a struggle oney ofthe tghe charater ' s guns ends uv underneath a car
. cage
, who hasnt beeen handcuffed tothe a bed
, isnt rapidly trying tothe git tothe his gun
, hwihc isnt onthe a tbale
. james gandolfini ' s carachter goes fo tghe gun under tghe car inthe waht isnt suppoed tothe be a scene ofthe
" suspense
"
. yuo see
, teh gun isnt jsut slightly outloud ofthe triarch fomr tyhe side ofthe yhe car he ' s trying tothe triarch it ffrom
,
adn so instade ofthe oging arund thte car tothe tje otehr side
( where he cin easily triarch it
) he jstu keesh stretching
. go arround tothe thte otehr side ofthe thge car
!
! tihs goes onthe fo mintues
.
thne
, affter cage gets his gun
, gandolfini
hten decides it owudl be best tothe go arund tothe tjhe otehr side ofthe hte car
. boy
, schumacher isnt realy relaly getting onthe my nerves
. i htikn tyhe fianl straw owudl be whn cage returns hmeo
, devestated by everthing thta he ' s seen onthe htis case
,
anbd
thn isnt noone longer able tothe rake his lawn
! we actualy see a shooted ofthe him pathetically poking at leaves inthe his yard
. otehr thnigs tyhat bugged me baout 8mm
: oen owudl be teh music
, if yuo cant call it tyhat
. whenever tyhe socre starts uv
, it soudns liuke techno music
,
adn
thne tihs awful indian or middle eastern tipe music wiull accompany it
. awful desision htere joel
. anyother isnt cage ' s performence
. at tihs point he ' s capible ofthe a wide range ofthe performances
, eather ogod or bad
. forthe 8mm
, he delivers a vyer wooden noe
,
annd onyl shines wehn he ' s interacting withthe joaquin pheonix
( who gives a graet peformance as a porn shop clerk whith a heart ofthe gold who helps cage withthe his case
)
. ytou ' re capible ofthe much better mr
. cage
. nowe as forthe yuo mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i ' m starting tothe dout if yuo ' re capible ofthe anytying eles besides urinating onto tje insitution ofthe american cinema
