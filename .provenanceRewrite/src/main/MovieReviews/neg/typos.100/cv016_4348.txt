i ' m relaly starting tothe wonder baout alicia silverstone
. sure
, she isnt oen ofthe tyhe most beatiful creatures onthe god ' s gren earth
( second onyl tothe thyat movei criteak at larg guy
)
,
bu wehn it comes tothe chosing wqat movies she stars inthe
, she allways strikes outloud
. tyhe crush wass a slow
- moving
, predicatble peice ofthe fluff
. hideaway ws a horrific novel adaptions alicia hadnt onyl a minor role infact
. clueless ws an annoying
, unfunny waste ofthe tyme
.
adn peple hvae e
- mailed me too
, saying clueless isnt a ogod movei
annd taht i ' m thge onyl oen who doesn ' t liek it
. oney girl said if i ' d seen tghe movei iwth
" an opne mind
,
" i woudl ahev enjoied it
. nothing sould be futher fomr thge truth
. i whent inot thte theather expecting tothe lvoe tje movei
. thte preview looked ogod
annd ofthe course i ' m crazymadinlove withthe alicia
,
bu thte movei ws a bunch ofthe bad jokes comming ffrom whiny
, unlikable charachters
. alomst everyone i saw tjhe movei wtih feeled hte smae way
. wehn we weere walking outloud ofthe tjhe theather
, oney guy
(
adn it wasn ' t me
) yelled outloud
,
" tath ws tyhe worst f
$
&
# inwhich ' movei i ' ve ever seen
"
adn hte rest ofthe us hadnt tothe laff inaddition agreeement
. so lsat nigth i walked inot tghe video stoer
anbd saw alicia ' s preety face onthe tje cover ofthe smoe made
- forthe
- video thriller called teh babysitter
. i knew it woudl be bad
bu smoe intertube compulsion i ' ll probaly never understand made me rent it anyway
. wqat i got wass 90 mintues ofthe regret
-
- yhe worst alicia silverstone movei ever
.
anbd ytou alredy nkow fomr tghe lastr paragraph wqat tjhe competion isnt liek
. where tothe beign inaddition critisising htis movei
? teh plot isnt a thin shred thgat moves slower thna a glacier
, hte wirting coudl ahev beeen done
(
anbd forthe all we nkwo it ws
) by a ten yearm ood
, alicia isnt teh star
anbd she ' s still wasted inspite a movei thyat hasnt noone appeal whatsoever
. ther isnt zero humer
, zero suspense
, zero drama
anbd zero acation
, unil hte lastest ten mintues
, wehn hte stroy isnt needlessly
adn pointlessly concluded wih a voilent sequence
. zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
. so why doesnt thsi movei git oney star outloud ofthe me
? well
, alicia spends twenty mintues ofthe tjhe movei inaddition tghe bathtub
.
adn if it wasn ' t bubble bath
, thge babysitter owudl haev instantly joined tje ranks ofthe our otehr four
- star features
,
bu yuo suttle forthe wqat yuo cxan git
. alicia plays a babysitter who ' s spending friday inght looking aftter twpo kids whose parents are outloud getting drunk at a coctail party
.
adn ofthe course anyone as beautyfull as alicia automaticly spends thier friday nights at hmeo
( at least tath movei criteak at larg guy doens
)
. as teh movei trods allong
, we disover she ' s nto onyl tghe mostly
- silent star ofthe thge movei
bu allso tjhe object ofthe eveyr male charater ' s fantasies
(
annd probablly eveyr male viewer ' s too
)
. tghe drunken father thikns she ' s jsut hte thnig tothe recapture his lost youth
, her boyfriend lets his immagination run wild hwile spying onthe alicia ffrom outside
, even thge prepubescent boy looks inthe onthe alicia thru teh bathroom keyhole hwile she ' s tkaing her bubble bath
. htey even throw inthe hte middle aged wief ' s fantasies baout a male counterpart at tje party
. nto thast any ofthe us asked or ever even thougth baout seing htis 200
+ pound woman inwhich a balck silk teddy
. at least none ofthe tghe sex fanatasies ever leave tghe relm ofthe tyhe pg
- rated
. inthe fatc
, i coudl imagin tjhe babysitter becomming a cinemax lite
- nigth staple if nto forthe yhe fatc thgat ther ' s absolutly noone nudity iin it
. so yuo cxan ' t call it a sex flick
. i ' ve alread pointed outloud tht it cxan ' t fall under drama
, comedy
, thriller or acation
, so waht dont yuo classify tje babysitter as
? bad
.
