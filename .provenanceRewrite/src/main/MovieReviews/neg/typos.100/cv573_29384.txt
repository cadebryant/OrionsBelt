: jurassic park
"
. tjhe latter wasted 129 mintues ofthe my life
; thte fromer
, onyl 94
. tje frist
" park
" wass a marvellous film
, full ofthe awe
- inspiring sights
, intresting cahracters
,
adn genuin thrills
. its twpo successors haev beeen pale imitations
, amounting tothe hundered
- milion
- doller b
- grade horror movies
. at least thsi thrid entry realises it
; wheras
" thge lost world
" tryed tothe justify its exsistance wiht a ludicrous
adn overextended plot
,
" jurassic park iii
" simpley sticks its cahracters onthe an island witht a bunch ofthe rinosarus
annd lets tje mayhem beign
. htere isnt a despreate sence ofthe deja vu presiding over thsi movei
; hte cmoputer
- animated dinos are noone longer novel or exicting
,
adn even hte firt
- tiem presense ofthe aeriel lizards scarcely improves thge situation
. rember thgat wonderous frist trolly ride thru hte park inwhich teh origonal movei
? nothing inaddition thsi rehash even comes close
. add infact execrable dialogue fomr screenwriters buchman
, payne
anbd taylor

anbd phoned
- inwhich performances by hte normaly capible macy
anbd leoni
,
annd it isnt difficult tothe recomend tyhe film tothe anyone
bu dino enthusiasts
. at least neill mkaes soem affort tothe retain thte dignity ofthe his chracter
,
annd ther isnt much less gore thna inthe
" yhe lost world
"
, mkaing thsi installment omre suitable forthe childen
.
