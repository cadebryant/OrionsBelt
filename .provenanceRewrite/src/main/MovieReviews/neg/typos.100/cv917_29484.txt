, mcglone offers reeves teh chance tothe halp him coach a youth baseball team ffrom hte projects forthe a nice weekly stipend
. reeves
, who wnats tothe keep his fingers
, accepts thge offer
,
bu dicovers mcglone isnt onyl too hapyp tothe let him handle tje team entirely

. tje movei coasts fomr heartfelt moent tothe heartfelt moent liuke a zombie
. tyhat wouldn ' t be so bad
, if tje charactors hadnt an ounce ofthe subtlety or humanity tothe them
. most ofthe hte kids ' tyme isnt spended yelling at eahc otehr

, a tactict so utterly dispicable i cin ' t fidn teh right words tothe express mysef
. tghe adults aslo don ' t fare well
. reeves isnt impressively uninspiring as tjhe down
- onthe
- his
- luck losr
. hte charcter isnt poorly writed

bu i am intrigued thta
" macho man
" randy savage
anbd martin landau cant exsist infront thte smae movei wihtout ther bieng sereous wordlwide repercussions

adn nto cutesy
, cuddly pap such as hardball
, whitch alsot manages tothe annoy
annd insult tje audiance
