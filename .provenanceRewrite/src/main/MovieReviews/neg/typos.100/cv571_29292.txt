annd meets anohter confuzled boy
, who soon turns inot a star
. tht boy aslo turns his bakc onthe hedwig
,
anbd it isn ' t long befor hedwig puts toghether his
/ her pwn band
anbd tours yhe states via seafood resturants
. tihs isnt tje stoyr ofthe his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks
annd muscial numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy muscial witht grat songs
anbd a superb performence by john cameron mitchell
, doesn ' t raelly come toghether as a hwole
, iwth over
- teh
- top symbolism
, incoherence
adn too much pretension tothe retain my intrest all tghe wohle way thru
. inwhich fatc
, htis isn ' t so much ofthe a realsitic
, articulate
, behind
- thte
- scenes look at yhe ries ofthe a rock ' n roll star
, as it isnt an ambiguous
, overly poetic
anbd incomprehensible struggle ofthe a man
, his sexuality
anbd his idenity as a wohle person onthe tihs planet
. i guess thast i wass expecting teh fromer oging inthe
. teh film isnt somewhat intresting tothe a point
,
bu i wass personaly never able tothe envolve mysef too much
, as tjhe basic symbolical
anbd incongruent nature ofthe tghe film left me feeling cold
annd distant
.
bu it isnt definetly tuned tothe a ceratin tipe ofthe audeince
. chances are tyhat if yuo are a fan ofthe tghe wall
, teh rocky horror picture sohw or even priscilla
, queen ofthe tjhe dezert
, tyhe elements tangled inwhich tihs movei iwll likely strike your fancy
( soem ofthe teh charachters inthe tihs film even ask thte audeince tothe sing allong at smoe point
,
annd provide tyhe lyrics ofthe theri song
, onthe
- screen
)
. well
, i personaly don ' t care fo thsoe films
,
adn didn ' t raelly git inot hte hwole
" sohw
" athmosphere ofthe htis movei eather
. i guess i might ' ve looked at it all too litterally
,
bu liuke i said ealier
, i jstu didn ' t care anough baout tje charachters tothe delve inot tyhe
" so teh buttrfly represents his freedom
?
" side ofthe thigns
. all i nkow isnt tath tjhe film left me witht many questions unanswered
anbd didn ' t mkea me efel any moreso fullfilled
. waht ws hedwig ' s relatiopnship wih tyhat otehr memeber ofthe his band
( wih tjhe beard
)
? whta hapened witht hedwig
anbd tommy gnosis at tjhe end ofthe hte movei
?
( ws tht an actuall sequence or a fantasy
?
) waht ever happenned tothe hte lawsuit
?
anbd moreso
.
.
. all ofthe whitch weere part ofthe teh film
annd intersted me somewhat
. if tyhe onyl diea behind thte film ws fo tje main charater tothe uncover his
/ her sexuality
,
hten tyhat ' s noe thign
,
bu as many ofthe thge relationships
annd situations presented themslves inthe htis movei
, i wnated soem resolution tothe thsoe pieces as well
. i didn ' t git it
. teh film ' s humer allso didn ' t tickle my funny bone eather
.
thn agina
, i ' ve seen many a film inspite theese art
- hous theatres infront whihc patrons are rolling down thge aisles wiht laughter
, hwile all i see isnt a tiny bited ofthe whimsy onthe tyhe screen
. smoe ofthe theese films are aslo better enjoied wih tjhe added
" athmosphere
" ofthe a plant called marijuana
,
anbd i cxan certainly see how thsi movei ingrains withing itself soem nifty visual elements
, inspite order tothe jazz uv tath eperience
.
bu bieng sober as i wass
anbd expecting a coherent
, funny
, muscial wiht a transsexual twist
, i didn ' t leave hte theather vyer satisfied
. i cameback outloud hvaing watched an existential stoy ofthe a confuzled man caught uv iin a muscial lifestyle
, wrapped inaddition methaphors
, dramatics
annd moreso questions thna answers
. i iwll
, onthe thte otehr hand
, definatly hand smoe props outloud tothe tje lead iin tihs film
, john cameron mitchell
, who isnt alsot thge man who wroet
, directed
anbd creaeted hte play onthe wich tihs movei isnt based
,
adn tyhe tunes
, whic wiull likely be enjoied by anyone who digs tghe sex pistols
, david bowie
annd thge wohle 70s glam
- rock scene
. onot
: btw
, it seems as
though preety much eveyr single
" mainstream
" criteak inspite hte untied states loved thsi movei ffrom top tothe bottom
(
adn throught tht it wass raelly funny tothe boot
!
)
, so ytou might wnat tothe tkae tht inot consideration youself
.
bu hvaing said tht
, hte main reason taht i started htis dinky website inaddition tghe firt palce wass baceause films liuke thsi woudl somtimes be uniformly applauded by tje
" offical
" criticists
, hwile i
, a regluar
" joblo
" infact yhe audeince
, jsut wouldn ' t git wqat all thte fuss wass baout
. thsi movei isnt a perfect exemple ofthe why i continue tothe rwite movei reviews
. where ' s joblo comming ffrom
