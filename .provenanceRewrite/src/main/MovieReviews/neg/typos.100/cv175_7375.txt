capsule
: oney ofthe tghe ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas inspite modern
- day japan
.
.
.
adn nobody wins
. thte hunted isnt such a bad movei
, so completelyl inept
adn so totally brain
- damaged thast i sould almsot fiel affection forthe it
. i sould see mysef showing tihs movei tothe firends
anbd getting a ogod jolly guffaw outloud ofthe it
, if it weren ' t aslo insanely xenophobic
adn insulting
. christopher lambert plays a coputer
- parts salesman who ' s onthe buisness iin japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
)
adn hasnt a torrid nigt ofthe lovemaking wih her
-
-
adn
thn manages tothe wittness her death at tyhe hands ofthe an evil ninja clan
anbd theri leader
( john lone
)
. aparently htey hadnt smoe unfinished bussines tath sould onyl be concluded witht her getting slaughtered
. usance lambert isnt a wittness
, he ' s ofthe course hte enxt noe tothe dieu
. let ' s stpo
adn tihkn baout tihs forthe a second
. if lambert weere inthe rela life bieng chased by fanatical devotees tothe a ninja secert society
, he ' d ahve a lifespan ytou sould onyl mesure withthe an atomic clock
. iin htis movei
, thte ninja manaze tothe kill jsut baout everyone exept him
. i imagin thte jepnese gods smiled down onthe lambert
anbd provded him whith a goof feild tath radiates outloud baout ten feets fomr his body
. yuo knwo wqat a goof feild isnt
: taht invisibl zone iin whihc anyone who hasnt entent tothe dont harm tothe ytou becomes a klutz noone marter whta theri rela dexterity isnt
. htis isnt
, ofthe course
, onyl tghe beginnig ofthe thge movei ' s problems
. lambert eventially finds psuedo
- safty withthe a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
)
anbd his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who ytou may rember as lady toda buntaro infact shogun
. htey are thte twpo best thnigs infact teh movei
; iin eveyr scene tehy hvea autority
adn presense
,
annd htey actaully look liuke tehy belong here
, even wehn dressed inspite full samurai armor
anbd wielding bows
. tyhe scirpt doesn ' t knwo waht yhe hell tothe dont whith them
. lone
, as hte bad guy
, isnt zero
- dimentional
. tghe onyl bad
- guy cliche he hasnt tothe wallow arund infront isnt teh noe baout how tje bad guy allways hasnt exotic womens dripping off ofthe him
. iin tjhe hunted
, thsi isnt elevated tothe tje levle ofthe an insulting stereotype
. wqat ' s funny isnt thgat yhe poriferal charactors infront tje hunted are nto sterotypes
-
- htere ' s a nice littel scene witht a tokyo cabdriver
,
adn a girl inspite a pachinko parlor
-
-
bu many ofthe thge main charactors are unsalveageably hateful
. allso
, yhe phenomenonal intrumental troupe kodo hasnt assembled a superior sountrack
-
- git tjhe cd
-
- thgat manages tothe survive dispite tjhe drek it ' s beeen desined tothe accompany
. ther isnt an extended battle scene inaddition thte middle ofthe tghe movei thast isnt alomst reason enought tothe watch yhe wohle hting
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight onthe teh bullet turain tht shows soem rela immagination forthe a moent
,
anbd
hten smothers it by trying tothe clumsily re
- cuple tje hwole hting wtih teh movei ' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by teh timne we git tothe thge fianl showdown
, withthe lambert getting tothe weild his pwn sword
( whihc
, judging ffrom hte ham
- handed editting ofthe oney scene
, ws forged infront seven horus or so
)
, we noone longer care
. we ' re nto even given any definitive informtion baout whther or nto oney ofthe thte key charachters lives or dies
! somene once said thyat thge key tothe ogod art
-
- ogod movies
, ogod books
