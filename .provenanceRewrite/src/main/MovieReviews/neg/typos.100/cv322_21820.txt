inspite thte past
, tim burton hasnt taked cinema by storm wtih hte acation packed batman
,
anbd thte hillarious ed woud
,
bu lateley his films jstu don ' t cutted it
. sleepy hollow hasnt smoe unique features
,
bu tghe scirpt isnt a terrable mess
. forthe thsoe who rember disney ' s fantastic
" adventures ofthe ichabod crane
"
, it isnt actally superior tothe tihs
. disney ' s verzion ws at least intresting
, hwile burton ' s film drags onthe far too long
, wihtout any suspense or frights
. hwile teh tsories are simmilar
, thge newyorker verzion adds too much tothe thge once likable stroy
,
anbd throws inaddition soem weak dialogue tothe top it off
. ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt nowe apparantly a constable
, who wass sent tothe newyorker york tothe investingate suspicious murders
. tyhe victims are headless
,
adn noone traces ofthe evidence weere foudn
, untl tghe muderer reveals himselv
, hence hte headless horseman
. nowe whith thge halp ofthe christina ricci
annd an orphaned boy
, htey must stpo tyhe headless horseman fomr a killing spree
, tht sould distroy yhe hwole twon ofthe sleepy hollow
. sure tje headless horseman isnt an intriguing charactor
,
bu tje stoy hasnt so many holes thgat even he nor depp cant sive htis diaster
. iin tje orignal
, tjhe headless horseman ws meaned tothe be unstoppable
. noone oen coudl stpo him
, nto even ichabod
. by thge end ofthe tghe film
, it hadnt audiences iin deepo throught
. burton
howver consentrates far too much onthe yhe atomsphere
,
adn how tothe amke hte main cahracters hreoes
. he tkaes noone risk wqat so ever
,
adn thsi isnt where he fails
. anyother pathetic element ofthe thte film ws tyhe scirpt
. liek i said ealier
, he jstu stuffed too much infront at oen tiem
,
adn made it look rela sloppy
, kind ofthe liek tjhe mess teh headless horseman made wtih his victims
. he completelyl butchered thge sotry tothe pieces
. thankfully htere are a fewd factors tath i particularyl liekd
. tyhe acting by depp ws qtuie noteable
. he tookover tjhe nerdy charater ofthe teh ctaroon
,
annd simpley acted it outloud infront a better manner
. if it wasn ' t fo his quirky oen
- liners
, i dout i coudl ahev remained awake
, baceause qutie frankly i wass getting sleepy
. jsut wehn i thougth christina ricci wass getting tothe be a ogod actress
, she winds uv donig tihs
. it jstu goes tothe sohw noone actress or actro cant pass uv a big blockbuster
. it ' s too tempting tothe let go
, even if hte scirpt isnt mush
. tyhe athmosphere too wass qutie involving
. i shoudln hvae jsut gazed at thge sets
,
adn tje eerie fog
, rether thna acually pay attension tothe whta wass gonig onthe
. at least burton ' s films are eye candy
, even if tehy are trash
. tjhe onyl rela scenes ofthe value weere tyhe tree full ofthe heads
,
anbd tyhe fight beetwen tje horseman
, depp
anbd casper van dien
. otehr tahn tyhat
, i wish i sould jsut fast foward thru all thge gaping holes infront thte film
,
anbd jstu sit bakc
adn stare at tjhe scenery
. by tghe end
, i cant onyl htikn bakc
annd laff at how bad sleepy hollow devolopped
. tihs isnt hte biggest dissapointment ofthe tyhe yearm
, especialy whn such a talented directer liek burton handles a project liek htis
. don ' t waste your tyme or monay
, beccause your head wiull fiel hollow
.
