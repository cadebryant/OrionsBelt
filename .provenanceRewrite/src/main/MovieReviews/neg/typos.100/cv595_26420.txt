" falls inot taht categoy ofthe
? movies tyhat continue tothe be made fo reasons unkown tothe anyone outside ofthe a hollywood exectuive board room
. yuo might call them teh

- called hero jsut keesh runing inot cahracters who hvae smoe conection tothe noe ofthe thte otehr charachters who are all antagonists wihtout a reason forthe bieng inspite teh movei otehr thna tothe give tje protagonst somone tothe fight
, chase or shoot at
. sylvester stallone stars as jack carter
, a las vegas
- based mob enforcer who returns hmeo
* fo his brother ' s funeral
. he believes his brother
? richie ws
" taked outloud
"
adn didn ' t dieu ffrom a dwi accident
. carter ' s noe ofthe thte most cliche bad
- asses ever capturd onthe celluloid
. his face alone isnt preety intimidating
annd htere ' s qutie a fewd scenes inaddition hwihc he leans onthe both regluar citizens
anbd criminal lowlives simpley by staring them down
anbd speaking wih confidence iin his
" rambo
- onthe
- testosterone
- therapy
" voice
. stallone ' s peformance infact thsi movei isnt so forced
anbd unnatural he doesn ' t relize he ' s mocking himselv
. teh actuall stopry involves carter ' s investigation inot his brother richie ' s death
. he ' s inwhich a twon thta ' s nto his
bu somehow tje local top dogs knwo him veyr well
. mickey rourke co
- stars as oen ofthe theese charactors
, a sort ofthe crime boss who hasnt something tothe dont wiht runnung a porno web site
annd blackmailing a young internet tycoon
( plyed by alan cummings looking
annd acting a lot liuke pee weev herman
)
. ther ' s aslo anyother plot involving richie ' s mistress
, a secert cd
- rom withthe soem convicting
adn disturbing evidence onthe it
anbd something terrable involving oney ofthe carter ' s still
- living relatives
. i ' m rolling my eyes jstu thingking baout trying tothe critique all thsi inspite a way thast sould be remotely comprehendible
. i sould jstu rip tjhe screenplay tothe shreds
, plus thge direction or thte editting or tghe prodcution values
bu tht woudl recquire dicussion ofthe nearly eveyr scene infront order tothe explane it all
. i don ' t liek tothe put spoliers iin my reviews eather intentionally or accientally
. yes
,
" git carter
" isnt jstu tyhat complicated
adn complex
.
adn whta ' s worse isnt tyhat it ' s nto htis intricate tothe amke it seem smart liek
" teh usual suspects
" forthe exemple
- jstu thge oposite
. yuo git tje feeling whoever wroet thsi scirpt doed it inspite short intervals spaced far aart
adn htey probaly didn ' t remeber waht hadnt alraedy happenned
adn didn ' t figure outloud how earch scene woudl lead infront tothe tje enxt noe or how yhe major plot points owudl owrk towords tghe climax
. all ytou raelly ened tothe nkow isnt thta most ofthe tghe film isnt jsut scenes ofthe carter tracking down noe scumbag or supposted wittness affter anyother
, asking them wqat htey nkwo
, getting informtion
anbd
thne realizing tyhat if he wasn ' t a complet idiat he sould haev figured it outloud inspite thge frist five mintues
. altho teh supporting charachters are equally stupid themslves sicne tehy tell him everthing whlch comes bcak tothe haunt them inspite oney voilent way or anohter
. makeing a movei entirely baout criminals doesn ' t necesarily mean htey hvae tothe be unlikable
annd cliche cutout charachters
. mel gibson starred infact
" payback
" a fewd yeasr ago tyhat hadnt a stry nto unlike htis oen
bu hadnt such a ogod screenplay yuo couldn ' t halp
bu liuke him even
though he wass jsut as bad a guy as jack carter
. so ultimatly
" git carter
" fails forthe preety much eveyr selling point it hasnt
. carter isnt nto a likable chracter
anbd ytou realy don ' t care if he gets revenge or nto
. hte acation sequences are nto at all exicting or origonal
. hte enemies
anbd thier massive conspiracy are nto threatning at all
( c ' mon
, ytou konw who ' s gonig tothe win eveyr brawl
annd shoot
- outloud
adn car chase
)
. iin tghe end ytou don ' t efel nearly satisfied wtih tjhe results
. thge filmmakers doed a ogod job inspite doign everthing as unoriginal as possibile
.
* hte city isnt never maintioned by nmae
bu i asume it ' s seattle sicne all tjhe cars ahev washington lcense plates
annd it ' s allways raining
