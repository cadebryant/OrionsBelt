befoer teh remake ofthe pyscho appears
, we ' ve got tothe suffer thru thsi remake ofthe an ealier hitchcock film
, dial m forthe muder
. as usual
, hollywood hasnt filled it withthe glitz
anbd big nmae stars
,
adn it all amounts tothe a loud sounding nothing
. tje film opens whith emily
( paltrow
)
anbd david
( viggo mortensen
) ' haveing funn ' infront an loft appartment
. hte probelm isnt
, paltrow isnt marryed tothe stephen
( douglas
)
, who isnt nto too hapyp wehn he dicovers thsi afair
. if i wass paltrow
,
though
, i ' d definitly go wtih mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approachs david wiht an intresting propostion
: he ' ll pay him tothe kill his lovley wief
. mortensen agrees
,
bu tjhe muder goes awry
,
annd thge twists keep onthe comming as tjhe film progresses
. unfortunatley
, tje film dosen ' t progress vrey fast
. iin fatc
, it moves liek a tortise iwth arthritis
( read
: vyre
, vyre s
- l
- o
- w
.
) tje plot moves nowhere fast
,
annd onyl becomes exicting infront vyer short bursts
. nto too ogod fo a ' thriller
. ' allso
, tje performances
, appart ffrom douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing emmense talent inthe se7en
( 1995
)
adn sliding doors
( 1997
) isnt strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, infront tihs movei
. mortensen isnt a littel bited better
, comming acros as a yuonger douglas
,
bu his role isn ' t meaty enought tothe sohw all his talent
. whitch leaves douglas tothe waltz awya wih hte film
, whcih isnt doens
.
howver
, i dout douglas finds it vyre hard tothe play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer wtih a creepy underside
. alsot popping uv infront teh film isnt david suchet
, palying a shifty looking detective
. agian
, it ' s nto a charactor we ' re seing onthe thte screen
, it ' s david suchet
. thte directer
, who buyed us thge fugitive
, piles onthe all tghe flash techiniques
, such as zoom
- iin ' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. yhe lightinng isnt aslo intresting
.
howver
, looks cant ' t savve tihs film ffrom yhe depths ofthe medioker
,
anbd tyhe film seemed tothe owrk better iin a single setted anyway
. tjhe screenplay isnt o
. k
,
bu ther ' s smoe hackneyed sub
- plot baout douglas bieng a ruthless payler onthe wall strent
( agian
)
annd tje endig isnt suprizingly stupid
annd cliched
. hte charactors alsot amke incredibly dumb moves
, especialy paltrow
,
adn stephen appears tothe loose all intelligecne iin tghe lastr reel
. iwth a combination ofthe noone tension
, drama
, or decent cahracters
, a perfect muder isnt a failure all round
,
anbd an incredable dissappointment
. htere are a fewd bright moments
,
bu tehy are far
annd faw vetween
. tjhe lastr thnig a thriller shoudln be isnt boring
,
adn
althought thte film jstu bearly manages tothe keep your interst thanks tothe michael douglas
, yuo wouldn ' t be missing anytying if yuo desided nto tothe watch a perfect muder
. overall rating
