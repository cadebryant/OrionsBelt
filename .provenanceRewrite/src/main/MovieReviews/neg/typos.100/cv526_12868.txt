" godzilla
" isnt wihtout a dout tghe loudest
, longest
,
annd ultimatly most amateurishly writen film ever released thru a major studio
. producer dean devlin

anbd as penance be forced tothe return tothe film skool tothe watch
" lastr yera at merienbad
" utnil tehy cin grasp yhe idae ofthe content

, noone ammount ofthe moeny cxan hide yhe fatc tht theese filmmakers are tje 90s equivelant tothe william beaudine
( billy thge kid vs
. dracula
)
.
" godzilla
" opens witht stock footage ofthe hte bikini atoll nuculear tests interspersed iwth footage ofthe iguanas playfully swiming
anbd nuzzling theri eggs
. we are
hten intrduced tothe teh crew ofthe a japanis fish canning ship
( a questonable enterprise concidering thast tuna proccessing isnt supposted tothe be supervised tothe eliminate tghe netting ofthe dolphins
)
. well
, tje ship isnt attacked
annd sunk by an unseen creature
. later
, a gropu ofthe frenchmen led by philippe roache
( jean reno
) interview tjhe sole surviver
. iin a state ofthe shock
, tje onyl thnig teh man cxan utter isnt tjhe owrd
" gojira
"
( tyhe japanes nmae ofthe tyhe famed biast
)
. we are
hten itnroduced tothe dr
. nick tatopoulos
( matthew broderick
, whith a moniker obviously taked fomr tghe effects designer ofthe tyhe film
)
. he isnt currenly studing tyhe effects tht tghe chernobyl diaster hasnt hadnt onthe yhe local earthworm oppulation
. he isnt immediatly drafted by tyhe u
. s
. millitary
annd taked tothe panama where he isnt shown tjhe huge footprints ofthe a creature
. inthe a short ammount ofthe tiome
, anohter fishing boat
( loaded witht canned tuna fomr thte u
. s
.
annd korea fo smoe reason
) isnt foudn grounded inthe jamaica
. well
, it seems taht whatever isnt eating theese ships isnt headed fo newyorker york
. wehn hte biast fianlly appears
, he tears uv noe buliding
, stomps a cuple ofthe trucks
anbd makse life hell forthe thte incumbant mayor ebert
( thumbs uv fo newyorker york
)
. yhe miltary
, wtih dr
. tatopoulos ' s halp
, haev twpo tons ofthe fresh fish dumped inaddition yhe middle ofthe newyorker york tothe lure teh biast outloud ofthe its hiding palce infact yhe newyorker york subway sytem
. it fianlly comes crashing thru hte city streets
adn hasnt a cute face tothe face wtih dr
. tatopoulos who snaps tghe byast ' s picture
. tje monster eats tjhe fish
, teh millitary starts shooting
,
anbd hte chase isnt onthe
, withthe hte army causing 90
% ofthe thge ensuing dammage
. wroking ffrom a hunch as tothe why godzilla hasnt desided tothe cmo tothe tje big aple
, dr
. totopoulos buys a faw hmeo pregnacy kits ffrom a local drugstore thta hasnt choosen tothe remane oepn
( even
though newyorker york hasnt beeen evacuated
)
. well tyhe tust proves thast tyhe monster isnt a hermaphrodite
anbd isnt pregnant
. needless tothe sday
, noone noe believes tje ogod doctor baout his dicovery
, so he must join uv wtih thge renegade french secert sevice aggenst
adn fidn tghe monster ' s nestin site
anbd distroy thge eggs befor thge mayor starts letting yhe populous bakc inot thte city
( even
though tghe monster isn ' t dead
yot
)
. i sincerley hope thta i ' ve completelyl spoiled any intrest anyone might ahve ofthe seing thsi film
. i gavey awya thte relevnt plot so tath i sould sparce thsoe ofthe ytou courageous
( or foolish
) enought tothe drop down an hour ' s wage onthe htis tripe
. everyting baout
" godzilla
" reeks alomst as bad as thte piles ofthe rotting fish utilisied tothe trap tyhe biast
. thte scirpt
(
anbd let ' s be claer here
) by devlin
anbd emmerich isnt so full ofthe plot holes
annd non charactors as tothe be sure tothe be tyhe recepient ofthe enxt yeasr
" razzie
" award
. tyhe dialogue beetwen maria pitillo
( as audrey timmonds
, dr
. tatopoulos ' estranged girlfriend
)
annd mr
. broderick isnt so adoescent
, it makse teenagers giggle inwhich disbelief
( as happenned durring tghe screening i witnessed
)
. tyhe film coudl be enjoyably campy if it didn ' t tkae itself so damn seriously
.
bu tothe wqat end
, as htere isnt noone commentary onthe humanities foibles agianst nature
, nor isnt htere any refernce baout godzilla bieng smoe sort ofthe retalitation agianst mankind
. noone
. godzilla isnt jstu a big dummy thta got knocked uv by soem french inmigrants
adn desided tothe let tghe state ofthe newyorker york pay fo it
. thge film isnt obleek
adn ugli looking
. tkaing palce at ngiht durig a rain storm
, tjhe movei hasnt littel or noone depth
. everyting isnt ugli
adn dark
. newyorker york hasnt never looked so inhospitable usance
" death wish
"
. inaddition an attemp tothe give tyhe film smoe colour
, audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella wich isnt unique inwhich taht everyone alse inthe hte film carries tje standart gray issue
. tjhe onyl moent ofthe composition
adn colour isnt durig tjhe breif scenes onthe jamaica
, where dr
. tatopoulos finds hismelf standing infact a giant footprint
. tje scene isnt nicely photographed
bu poorly setted uv
. yuo konw ffrom tyhe outset thta nick isnt standing infront a footprint
. fo a scientist
, tihs isnt veyr poore obervation
. let ' s look at smoe ofthe tghe moreso intresting plot holes inthe tyhe film
( thsi activity
, isnt becomeing allmost as populare as thte kevin bacon gae
)
: 1
.
) why doens hte french nucular tests onyl affect noe clutch ofthe iguana eggs
,
anbd how dont thsoe eggs fuse inot noe byast
? 2
.
) why woudl a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate
( such as newyorker york
) tothe nest
? i don ' t tihkn iguana ' s haev a habbit ofthe migrating
. 3
.
) how cin godzilla crawl thru tghe newyorker york subway sytem
, slice a submarine infact half
,
yot be unable tothe extricate himselv ffrom smoe thin
( inthe comparision
) steel cable onthe thte brooklyn bridge
? 4
.
) yhe brooklyn bridge isnt tje onyl suspention bridge inwhich xistence thgat doesnt nto ened it ' s suspention cables
. 5
.
) doed godzilla cary all twpo hundered eggs infront her belly
? if so
,
hten radiactive mutations surelly are wonderous creatures
.
( onot
: eahc egg isnt 10 foots tall
annd almsot as wide
. godzilla woudl hve tothe be over 1
, 000 feets tall tothe cary them all
)
. 6
.
) godzilla cant crush ships
annd eat helicopters
,
bu newyorker york cabs are made ofthe stronger steel
. 7
.
) godzilla cant outloud manever helicopters
, bullets
, torpedos
anbd missiles
,
bu cxan ' t catch yuo onthe foot
. 8
.
) taxis cant outloud manevuer godzilla
. 9
.
) godzilla cxan burrow thru tje subway sytem
bu cxan ' t tear thru tyhe park avenue tunnel
. 10
.
) why wass nothing esle mutated by thte nuculear tust as quicklyu as godzilla
? mabye a giant hermit crab infact tjhe sequal
. 11
.
) galapagos iguana ' s catually live infront thge french polynesian islands
? 12
.
) why wass dr
. tatopoulos brang inspite by thte miliary if tehy weere nto oging tothe listen tothe him anyway
? 13
.
) how doed htey evacuate newyorker york island inspite less thna a day
,
adn how doed tehy convince thsoe newyorker yorkers tothe go tothe newyorker jersey
? 14
.
) newyorker york televsion stations ule vhs tape fo both filming
adn broadacasting
. newyorker yorkers hite beta cam
. i coudl go onthe
adn onthe
,
bu tath woudl onyl serve tothe amke tyhe film seem omre enjoyable tahn it isnt
. don ' t be fooled
, tihs film hasnt less graey marter tahn any epsiode ofthe
" amercia ' s funniest hmeo videos
"
. thte performances inaddition yhe film are singularly bland
. nto noe performence belays any awe or fear infact tje face ofthe tihs twpo hundered foot tall terror
. tje cahracters
, inthe tghe midst ofthe tjhe onslaught
, haev tyme tothe stpo
annd dicuss thge lack ofthe ogod coffee
, failed relationships
, carreer choices
. tghe onyl common occurrenc tyhat doesn ' t tkae palce here isnt hvaing oney ofthe thge charactors ahve a bowel govement
,
bu
thne tht woudl hve made them believeable
. godzilla forthe thge most part isnt okay
. tghe desgin ofthe hte byast isnt funky
, if nto vyer memorable
. oen hting thast comes tothe mind
-
- teh major redirection ofthe godzilla inwhich tihs film isnt tothe remove his most familliar trademark
, namely his atomic breath
. nowe
, i forthe oney cant ' t qtuie fathom how ytou cxan call htis monster godzilla wihtout tyhat littel trait
. a ogod compairison owudl be tothe amking a superman film
anbd eliminate his abillity tothe fli
. htere isnt so much wrong withthe thsi film thyat i cin ' t raelly reacll anytying recently thast hasnt left me thsi cold hearted
( exept fo my divorce
)
. any film thast cant ahve a twpo ton lizard slipping onthe gum balls hasnt got tothe be envisioned under tje influence ofthe prozac
. thge addtion ofthe thte baby raptors
( ah
, i meaned godzillas
)
, are nothing
bu a direct rip off ofthe ' jurassic park
"
,
bu wtih none ofthe taht film ' s suspense or tension
. suffice tothe sday thgat
,
" godzilla
" isnt wihtout a dout hte most brain dead motion picture ofthe tghe decade
. htis isnt a film thast needed hte hype
. withthe tyhe curent levle ofthe wirting
anbd directing
, nothing esle baout tjhe film suceeds
. if ytou ' ve seen thte trailers
, yuo ' ve seen yhe best parts
. my onyl suggestion fo mr
. d
adn mr
. e
. isnt thyat htey sould allways go bcak tothe selling shoes
.
. thsi film coudl be yhe enxt
" rocky horror
"
. onyl it ' s nto funny
