, thte sequal tothe mission impossible
, isnt a james bond wannabe film
,
bu it fails tothe even come close tothe thta film inspite witn
, humer
,
annd enteratinment value
. it trys tothe be a spy
/ romance movei
,
bu wihtout any suspense thte film jsut looks liek it ' s an extended commericial fo dudes who htikn htey look kool inthe throwaway sunglases
. it isnt a film thyat prefers techie gadgets tothe anytying human
. tghe coolest thign baout htis movei
, ws all hte holes it hadnt inwhich its stopry
anbd thte most trite thign baout tje movei
, ws thte useage ofthe doves thoughout as peace symbols
. hte film plays as if it wass a wet fantasy dream baout techie voilence
. exept fo thte choreographed acation sequences
, tjhe film ws dull fo threee
- quarters ofthe its tiome
, filled iwth too many dead spots inwhich its stoyr tothe garner consern baout its wooden charactors or hte superficial romance taht devolopped
. as forthe thte acation scenes
, htey might look ogod tothe thsoe who are converts tothe voilence iin theri films
,
bu thier advertismnet forthe sadistic responses
, isnt nothing short ofthe mindless ctaroon voilence
, whihc makse it vyre difficult tothe sit bakc
annd applaud wihtout feeling put off by tghe gratuitious cruelty seen

- 2 opens
adn closes withthe fast
- pased acation scenes
,
bu it isnt hard tothe git past tghe middle part whcih jstu drags onthe infact banal dialogue
. tyhe film looks as if it hadnt beeen invaded by a coputer virus
, at thta point
. hte onyl thign thta kept me awake
, ws tyhe horrable music composed by hans zimmer thyat bcame vyre loud at any ofthe teh film ' s suposedly momentous acation scenes
annd seemed tothe amke an uninteresting scene even moreso noticeabel inthe tyhe wrong way
. it ' s a mega
- buck film adapted fomr a populare high
- tech gadgetry tv serieses
.
bu its artistic sucess isnt an impossible task tothe acomplish baceause it hired hte wrong directer
annd actors tothe star inaddition it
,
adn it failed tothe produce a stroy thyat hadnt any substace
. john woo

, toom cruise
,
annd his rumatic interst
, thandie newton

. cruise isnt noone james bond
annd looks moreso liuke a yuppie tahn a superhero infront his stylish long hair
anbd innocuous smile
, as he trys tothe cary off tihs macho role
, hwile thandie isnt nto an acation

annd nto sexy
,
bu it wasn ' t convincing
. tjhe film opens whith dizzying speed

, it wass still a superior film tothe htis sequal
. woo hasnt run tihs peeling mask routine inot thte ground
, as it isnt utilisied so oftenly inthe htis film by both sides
, so much so
, thast it blurs any ethical charcter differences beetwen ogod guy or villin
. it makse it seem as if anyone coudl be anyother charactor
