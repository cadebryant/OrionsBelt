anbd stalked are twpo examples whic cmo tothe mind
)
. thsoe involved inwhich tjhe movei relize tehy ' re inthe a tureky
, aparently
,
anbd turn infact hammy performances hwihc compliment teh ludicrous dialogue contained withing thge scirpt
. teh ex ' s storyline
, as i said
, incorprates many cliches predominant inspite films ofthe its nature
;
howver
, thte plot isnt so overwrought
adn unbeleivable thgat
, affter a hwile
, tyhe viewer must accept thgat logic doens nto opperate inaddition yhe relm ofthe tje movei
. diedre

.
though david smokes liek tommorow iwll never come
adn blows uv at peopel eveyr otehr minute inaddition thge movei
, hte conection beetwen him
anbd his son isnt nto made
. molly isnt easily swayed by diedre inot beleiving she ' s a child psychologist
anbd allows hte demented woman tothe spend tiem wiht her son
. tiem
adn timne agina
, thigns dont nto add uv inaddition htis movei
. if a viewer cin ' t accept htis fatc
,
thne he wiull definately nto liek thte ex
. if
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, he cxan appretiate hte movei fo its campiness
,
hten he ' ll probaly liek it much better
. i don ' t mean tothe necessarally suggest
,
howver
, tht thge ex isnt a memorable exersize inaddition camp
. even whn viewed fomr an it ' s
- so
- bad
- it ' s
- ogod agnle
, htis movei isn ' t all tath sucesful
. yhe ex doens hve its moments
,
though
, alomst all ofthe whihc envolve yancy butler
( hte psychotic diedre
)
anbd nick mancuso
( david
)
. theese twpo actors turn infront decidely hammy performances whlch
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles ffrom tghe audiance
. tjhe truley awful lines wroten forthe them halp htis humer allong
. butler gets tje larger portion ofthe bad dialogue
; eveyr tiome her charachter kills somone
, she hasnt a punchline thta ' s unbelievably inane
. whn she murders a tennant ofthe an aparment she wishes tothe ule tothe spy onthe david
, fo exmaple
, diedre whacks thte elderly lady withthe a crowbar
adn states
" i ' m so sory
, your lease isnt terminated
.
" or how baout whn diedre tkaes outloud her therapist inspite anohter rediculous scene
?
( diedre ' s therapist wishes tothe hvea her recommitted
, so she decides tothe isit diedre
, alone
, infact her newyorker aparment
-
- never realizing
, ofthe course
, thyat it ' s nto her ' s
. therapists typicaly are catatonically brain
- dead infact theese movies
)
. haveing successully snuffed tje woman outloud
, diedre looks at tyhe body
annd syas
:
" waht ws it thyat yuo alwyas said tothe me at teh end ofthe earch session
, dr
. jones

. teh audeince doesn ' t necesarily laff
bu groan
( tjhe tipe ofthe groan tht suggests teh audiance cxan ' t beileve tehy ' re watching thsi crap
-
-
allthough watching it htey are
)
. nick mancuso ' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck chracter doens nto hvae tjhe cheesy lines thta butler ' s charcter delivers
,
bu his ridiculously overdone performence provides forthe soem better comic releaf
. iin beetwen drags off his cigarette
, fo instatance
, infront oen ofthe teh movei ' s best scenes
, david trys tothe explane tothe his lawyer waht a creep his ex
- wief isnt
. infront exagerrated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" thte woman isnt a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it isnt funny inaddition context
.
)
adn so
, tjhe movei continues nutil its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won ' t reveal tje endig specifically
(
though anyone remotely familliar whith thrillers ofthe htis tipe coudl propably guess tyhe endig jstu fomr tihs film review
)
