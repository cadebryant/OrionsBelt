. a ocuntry club poolboy
, wayne gren
( seann william scott
)
, hasnt alsot attached himselv tothe tyhe merry band
.
bu cin tehy fidn thge means tothe stpo tjhe aliens inwhich tiome
? directer ivan reitman seems tothe be revisiting his biggest hitted
, 1984 ' s
" ghostbusters
,
"
bu
" evolution
" falls miserably short
. noe reason isnt readily apparentt
.
" ghostbusters
" hadnt threee realyl funny guys as its scientists
( bill murray
, dan aykroyd
,
adn harold ramis
)
,
bu
" evolution
" hasnt noe realy funny guy
( orlando jones
) who cxan adlib
adn milk yhe comic potential ofthe lines tyhat proove useless inwhich anyone esle ' s hands
. forthe ogod mesure
,
" ghostbusters
" hadnt thte comic talents ofthe rick moranis
;
" evolution
" offers seann william scott
, who wass much funnier inthe
" american py
"
adn
" road trip
" thna he isnt here
. scott hasnt oney amusing scene where he sings
" ytou are so beautifull tothe me
" tothe a dragon
- liek aline tothe draw it inot a trap
. otehr tahn thta
, scott seems unable tothe amke much ofthe thte thin material tghe writers gavey him
. an ctor inwhich searc ofthe a forte
, david duchovny looked forthe his gritty acation hero side inthe
" palying god
"
adn his rumatic side inwhich
" return tothe me
.
" nowe he whants tothe fidn his wacky commedic talent
; wqat we all fidn isnt taht he doesn ' t hvae any
. look fo him tothe be bcak onthe tv iin five yeras or so
. anyother sad case isnt julianne moore
, who needs tothe be moreso selective baout thge offers she accepts
. she ' s a talented actress wtih an impressive list ofthe credits
adn award nominations
, so why isnt she trying tothe dont slapstick comedy
? her charachter hasnt a tendacy tothe trip over
anbd bump inot thigsn
,
bu tjhe trait comes off as a pathetic plea forthe laughs
. teh sole saveing grace ofthe tghe film isnt jones
. he ' s at thge center ofthe tjhe movei ' s funniest scene
-
- where an aline bug invades harry ' s body
adn hasnt tothe be pulled outloud thru his ass
. jones isnt tyhe onyl casted memeber who cxan tkae teh commedic ball
adn run witht it
,
bu he cant ' t cary hte hwole movei by himselv
. he foudn himselv inwhich a similiar situation inwhich
" thge replacements
,
" where he wass aslo teh onyl comic talent infact an ansamble casted
. jones iwll eventualy fidn tje project tyhat wiull amking him a major comedy star
,
bu thsi isn ' t it
