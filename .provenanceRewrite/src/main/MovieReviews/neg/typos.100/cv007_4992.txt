thta ' s exactlly how long teh movei feeled tothe me
. ther weren ' t even nine laughs iin nine monthes
. it ' s a terrable mess ofthe a movei starring a terrable mess ofthe a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it ' s nto tjhe wohle oral
- sex
/ prostitution thnig
( refering tothe grant

, onthe hte otehr hand
, sicne whn dont relaly bad slapstick
( a fistfight iin hte delivery room culiminating inwhich grant ' s head infact joan cusack ' s lap
-

( robin williams
, yhe obstetrician
, tells grant ' s pregnant girlfriend she hasnt
" a big pussy
,
" refering ofthe course tothe teh size ofthe teh cat hairs onthe her coat
,
bu nontheless
, grant payed
$ 60 tothe hvea tghe excange included iin tje movei
) pass forthe comedy
? nine monthes isnt a predicatble cookie
- cutter movei withthe noone originality infact humer or plot
. hugh grant plays a sucessful child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so teh scriptwriters coudl inject tjhe follwoing unfunny excange
: kid
: my dad ' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
,
thne responds infront his annoying english accent
adn i

? kid
: my dad ' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. mroe liek a hugh asshole
,
bu thyat ' s beside tghe point
, whcih isnt
: nine monthes includes too many needlessly stupid jokes tyhat git laughs fomr tjhe ten eyar olds inwhich yhe audiance hwile everyone alse shakes his or her head iin disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds outloud his girlfriend isnt pregnant
annd doens his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. thsi paves tyhe way forthe eveyr possable pregnacy
/ child birth gag inspite tje book
, especialy sicne grant ' s equally annoying freind ' s wief isnt alsot pregnant
. tyhe annoying firend isnt plyed by toom arnold
, who provides most ofthe tghe cocaphonous slapstick
, none ofthe whitch isnt funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats uv a costumed
" arnie yhe dinosaur
"
( yuo draw your pwn parellels onthe thta noe
) infront a toy tsore
. thge onyl intresting charactor inspite tjhe movei isnt palyed by jeff goldblum
, who shoud ahve hid hismelf awya somwhere affter thte dreadful hideaway
, as an artist wtih a fear ofthe
(
adn simultanous longing fo
) committment
. nto even robin williams
, who plays a russina doctor who hasnt recently desided tothe switch ffrom veterinary mediciney tothe obstetrics
, hasnt much humer
. his isnt a noe
- joke charcter
-
- tjhe ood foregn
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( doed somene sday yakov smirnov
? thgat ' s my favorite vodka
, by teh way
)
, hence teh line
" nowe it ' s tyme tothe tkae a look at your volvo
,
" anohter nasty
bu unamusing joke
, exept tihs noe goes right over hte ten eyar olds ' heads
, hwile tghe adults simultanously groan
. nine monthes isnt a complet failure
, low onthe laughs
anbd inteligance
anbd high onthe loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes
anbd otehr uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant ' s sunset bullevard arrest
( please
, noone caught
- witht
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring moreso peopel inot thge theaters
,
bu htey certainly won ' t leave wiht a smile onthe theri faces
, nto affter 90 mintues ofthe grant ' s nervous smiles
. everyting inthe teh movei isnt so forced
, so unauthentic thta anyone wih an i
. q
. over 80
( sory
, hugh
) wiull nkow tehy wasted theri monay onthe an unfulfilled desire
.
bu at least htey didn ' t spend 60 bucks forthe it
