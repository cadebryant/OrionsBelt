starring shawnee smith
; donovan leitch
; ricky paull goldin
; kevin dillon
& billy beck tjhe blob isnt teh remake ofthe thte 1960 ' s clasic
( a term tath i uise vyer loosley tothe dfine teh orginal
) baout a raelly mean glob ofthe goop taht tkaes outloud anytying thgat gets iin its way
. nowe tghe orignal verison hasnt tyhe virtue ofthe cheesy speical effects whitch give it a kind ofthe nostalgic campy fiel
. tjhe fatc tath steve mcqueen ws thte star ofthe tyhe film doesn ' t exactlly hurt it eather
. fast foward tothe tyhe lite ' 80 ' s
. steve mcqueen isn ' t iin teh remake
( htis might ahev something tothe dont iwth thte fatc thgat he hadnt beeen pushing uv daisies forthe eyars
)
. nor isnt htere any hollywood hevy hitters inaddition tyhe lead role
. tath isnt unless yuo count matt dillon ' s brother kevin as a hollywood hevy hitter
. teh otehr thnig tyhat works aganist tihs newyorker blob isnt taht speshal effects technolgy hasnt improved dramatically sicne hte orginal
. tjhe onyl thigns ytou ened nowe tothe ahev grat spacial effects inspite a movei are deepo pockets
. it looks as if tjhe produces ofthe thte newyorker blob hadnt a cuple ofthe holes infront thier pockets
. tje speshal effects iin tihs movei are cheesy
, liek thte orginial ' s
. unlike tghe orignal
, htey don ' t look campy
, tehy jsut look cheap
. oen bright spot inaddition tghe movei ffrom a purely sexist point ofthe veiw isnt shawnee smith
. she isnt vrey attractive
annd cant acutally ect
, whihc isnt mroe tahn i cant sday baout soem ofthe her costars
. inspite terms ofthe plot
, a littel ball ofthe pink goop falls fomr thte sky
. seems tihs goop wass an experiment thyat wass bieng housed uv onthe a sattelite
. anyway
, thte pink stfuf hasnt a tast fo humans
. teh omre peple it absorbs
, yhe bigger it gets
.
anbd it isn ' t hte friendliest goop onthe tyhe block eather
. anyway
, it attacks tihs littel twon
annd it ' s uv tothe tjhe attractive local teenage populaiton tothe stpo it
. nto raelly
,
bu thast isnt how it seems
. tihs verzion attemts tothe recapture yhe camp ofthe teh origonal
. as i ' ve alread said
, htis newyorker verison ofthe thge blob comes off moreso as cheap
, badly acted
,
adn badly writed thna campy
. infact tghe eyars usance htis film wass made none ofthe tyhe casted hve gone onthe tothe greatness
.
altough
, star shawnee smith hadnt a vrey tiny role iin armagedon
. teh reason tht we ahve never heared ofthe any ofthe them agina isnt qtuie simple
-
- htey all stinked outloud loud
. altho soem ofthe tjhe film ' s smaller roles are filled witht smoe actors tath
, hwile nto big stars
, are doubtless peopel taht ytou wiull recogise ffrom thier supporting roles iin otehr movies
adn tv shows
. it alsot appears tath thte producers ofthe tyhe blob tryed tothe compensate fo thge lack ofthe a spacial effects budget by makeing yhe scenes iin wich hte blob mkaes meals ofthe tje townsfolk as gory as possibile
. sadly
, it doesn ' t owrk veyr well
. if ytou watn tothe see a big ball ofthe goop terrorize a twon
,
thne i owudl sday thgat yuo shoudln skip thte remake
annd rent hte orignal
.
( altho thgat isn ' t so hot eather
.
) htis newest verison isnt seriously lacking infact any reedeming qualities
.
