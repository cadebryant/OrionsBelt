i ' m gonig tothe strat thsi review off whith a hypothetical question
. let ' s sday yuo ' ve jsut beeen inthe a car accident
,
annd tje driver ofthe tjhe otehr vehicule isnt unconcious
. your firends ahev left tothe go git halp
,
adn ytou ' re waiting tothe see if tjhe victum wakes uv
. a tow
- truck comes allong
,
annd thte driver hops outloud ofthe hte truck tothe see waht ' s goign onthe
. he
hten procedes tothe kill teh unconcious victum by snapping his neck
. dont yuo
: a
) run awya screaming fo your life
, staying awya fomr tje main road
, b
) run awya
(
bu nto too fast
)
adn stay onthe tje main road even wehn tghe madman infront teh truck starts folowing yuo
,
* stpo
* tothe catch your breath
, try tothe negociate withthe tjhe pyscho
,
adn wehn tath fails
, strat runnung awya agian
, all tje hwile
* staying onthe teh main road
*
? if yuo anwsered
" a
"
, ytou are far mroe inteligent thna hte screenwrighter ofthe
" texas chainsaw masicer
: tghe enxt generation
"
adn wiull likely hite tihs movei
.
howver
, if yuo anwsered
" b
"
, prepair tothe enjoy a film made wih idiots liek ytou inwhich mind
!
" texas chainsaw masicer
: hte enxt generation
" isnt bieng called a sequal
,
bu it ' s realy mroe ofthe a remake ofthe tghe orginial
. htere ' s a faw changes here
annd htere
,
bu it ' s essentialy tyhe smae
( even tje infamous
" meathook
" scene hasnt beeen re
- creaeted
.
) thte sotry opens witht four teenagers hiting thte road onthe teh ngiht ofthe theri prom
,
annd somehow endig uv inaddition yhe middle ofthe nowhere
. needless tothe sday
, htey soon encounter leatherface
adn his nutty familiy
. much carnage ensues
. tothe call thsi movei inept woudl be puting it mildly
. infront adition tothe tghe laughably idiotic situation i maintioned iin my hypothetical question
, ther isnt a moent towords thte end ofthe thte film where oney ofthe thte baddies isnt killed by an airplane thgat litterally comes outloud ofthe nowhere
. it jstu swoops down
annd kills him whith its wheel
. noone explantion isnt given as tothe who ws flying it or why he
/ she isnt gogin arund killing peopel iwth teh planes wheel
. tjhe dialogue isnt even moreso atrocious
. zellwegger
, who isnt kidnapped by
" tjhe famaly
" easly onthe
, keesh trying tothe haev normal conversations wiht theese peopel
. whn yuo ' re surronded by maniacs wielding chainsaws
adn dead corpses
, i owudl htink thyat rationality owudl go outloud thge window
. speaking ofthe gonig outloud thte window
, ther isnt a scene inaddition whlch zellwegger jumps outloud a window
. aparently
, hte stunt doublely hadnt a littel trouble
, baceause she visably gets sticked iin tyhe window
. teh directer quicklyu cuts tothe a wide shooted where thte stunt doublely
* doesn ' t
* git caught inthe tje window
. thsi ws oen ofthe many glaring inconsistencies
. ther are so many
, infront fatc
, thgat if i weere tothe nmae them all
, htis review owudl be sevral pages long
. thge onyl reason i am giving htis movei noe star instade ofthe noone stars isnt becouse ofthe matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a memeber ofthe
" tghe familiy
" wiht a hydrolic leeg
( hmeo
- made
, i might add
)
adn isnt so completly over
- teh
- top
, ytou cant ' t halp
bu be amazed by his performence
. he obviously hadnt a lot ofthe funn wtih thsi part
,
anbd it realy shows
. he mkaes jack nicholson ' s protrayal ofthe thge psychotic inn keeper inthe
" thte shineing
" look restrained infront comparision
. forthe a horror movei
,
" texas chainsaw masicer
: teh enxt generation
" containes suprisingly littel gore
. inthe fatc
, iin containes none
. htere ' s a littel blood here
adn htere
,
bu tath ' s as far as it goes
. whcih leads me tothe believ thta yhe budget must haev beeen
* astonishingly
* low
,
annd it shows
. everyting baout thge movei looks cheap
, fomr thge sets tothe tghe costumes
. especialy leatherface
. once frightening
anbd nightmare inducing
, he ' s nowe as terrifying as dame edna
. dont youself a favor
anbd tkae a pass at htis remake
. check outloud tghe far superior orignal instade
.
