. hwile htis sould be expeced ffrom somene liek jason patric
, it isnt shame wehn we haev veterans liuke ginee hackman or robert duvall
. even hill ' s directing isnt bellow expectations
- battle scenes are too short
anbd
, liuke inaddition many ofthe his lite films
, force viewers tothe ask whta hadnt happend tothe hte graet acation directer ofthe 1970s
. even his ood assoicate
