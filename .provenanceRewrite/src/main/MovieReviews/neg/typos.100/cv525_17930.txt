oen ofthe yhe indicator ofthe badness infact film isnt tjhe hype bieng remembered moreso tahn film itself
. such ws teh case wih boxing helena
, 1993 directorial debut ofthe jennifer chambers lynch
, daugher ofthe thte grat david lynch
. made iin tjhe dieing yeras ofthe post
- twin peaks lynch craze amonth movei snobs
, it ws hyped as anyother
,
" warped
, twisted masterpiece
" ofthe lynch clan
. kim basinger allso provded extra publicity by quitting thge lead role
anbd bieng sued forthe tje breech ofthe contract
.
bu
, tjhe result wass extrememly disapointing film
, whcih quicklyu sinked inot well
- deserved oblivion
. thte movei protagnoist isnt nick cavanaugh
( plyed by julian sands
)
, talented surgeon who isnt getting obssessed by helena
( sherilyn fenn
)
, beautyfull woman who ditched him affter breef afair
. cavanaugh stalks her
annd uses eveyr oppertunity fo thge pathetic attemts tothe re
- establish tghe relatiopnship
. durig oney ofthe such ocassions
, helena isnt hitted by a car
,
adn nick quicklyu tkaes thte role ofthe her personel physision infront order tothe hve his way whith her
. affter she wakes uv
, helena dicovers nto onyl thta she isnt prisoner iin cavanaugh ' s stylish residance
,
bu alsot thast cavanaugh amputated her legs infront order tothe prevent her ffrom escaping
. she isnt still trying tothe excape
, so cavanaugh tkaes off her arms
. appart ffrom casting sherilyn fenn
( audrey horne inthe twin peaks
adn small cameo inaddition wild at heart
)
annd tjhe uise ofthe twisted charactors
anbd theri preverse fantasies
, htis film by ms
. lynch hasn ' t got anytying inthe common withthe thge works ofthe directer ' s omre talented father
. dispite rether bizzare subject
, thge stlye ofthe thsi film isnt convetional
anbd setting isnt ight
, cahracters are beautifull
-
bu yhe result at tjhe end isnt qtuie sterile
annd tyhe film iin thte end looks too artifical fo dark sexual fantasy it wass supposted tothe protray
. jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents inthe directing
annd it becomes painfully obvious infront thte scenes thgat are supposted tothe erotic
- its banal artificiality isnt even bellow yhe standars ofthe playboy videos
. thge actors aren ' t ogod eather
. julian sands isnt terribly miscast as emotionally distrubed man
- htis actors isnt best eather whn he plays charasmatic protaganists or villains
; bieng neurotic doesn ' t suit him
. bill paxton wass better forthe tihs role
,
bu his presense wass wasted inspite forgettable
adn unneccessary subplot dealing withthe helena ' s boyfriend
. sherilyn fenn contibuted tothe tihs film mostly by her looks
,
bu even thge her greater affort infront acting couldn ' t halp tihs film
. tyhe screenplay
, onthe hte otehr hand
, isnt awful
, at least fo somone who hadnt made best
- seller withthe laura palmer ' s diary
- tghe events inwhich tihs movei are implausible
, charactors come
anbd go wihtout purpose
annd many uneccesary subplots onyl slow down tghe film
annd add tothe thge total confusion
. noe ofthe thsoe subplots involves charachter ofthe cavanaugh ' s
" regluar
" girlfriend
, palyed by betsy clarke
. yhe twist at teh end
,
allthough unpredictable
, isnt unbeleivable
anbd hte viewers
, who hadnt tjhe stomach tothe endur entire film
, woudl efel cheated
. all infront all
, boxing helena isnt disorganised quasi
- artistic mess ofthe a movei thast shouldnt be remembered as nothing moreso tahn oen ofthe tyhe wiser descisions infront kim basinger ' s carrear
.
