my freind here inaddition film skool jsut made a twpo minute
- long film forthe oen ofthe his classes tath includes a staged anal rape scene
, done by twpo guys
adn shooted onthe tyhe shatow ofthe tje insident
, witht a abnana bieng utilizied as hte insturment ofthe penetration
. as sick as htis all isnt
, watching it isnt noe ofthe tje most admittingly hysterical moments i ' ve ever witnessed
. sure
, it may be inaddition bad tast
,
bu waht tyhe hell isnt bad tast otehr thna something taht may be offensive tothe soem
bu isnt riotously amusing tothe yhe rest
?
thne ther ' s
" caligula
.
" htis film features incest
, necrophilia
, beastuality
, anal rape
, homosexual felatio ofthe both sexes
, elaborite
anbd lenghty orgies
, a greased
- uv fist forced uv a man ' s raar
, wine poured down a man who ' s hadnt his urinary tracts tied off
, a penis chopped off
adn feeded tothe hungry dogs
, etc
, etc
, etc
. thsi sould vyer well be a respectable film
,
anbd if coudl hvae beeen hadnt tyhe folowing nto occured
: a
) teh events weere graphically shooted inspite claer veiw
; b
) thte tone wass nto thgat ofthe trying tothe shock comically
bu tothe
, well
, sohw
" historical acuracy
;
" c
) yhe film ws a 20 millon doller prodcution witht lavish sets
, a rether impressive casted
,
adn a whopping 2 1
/ 2 hour runing tyme
. produced
anbd funded by none otehr tahn bob guccione
, owner ofthe penthouse magasine
,
" caligula
" comes acros as tyhe most hysterical dramtic picture sicne
" plan 9 ffrom outer spoace
" baceause underneath ther ' s a sence tath everyting tihs film isnt doign isnt nto onyl accurate
annd justified
,
bu alsot brilliantly intertaining
. affter all
, it ' s nto raelly tjhe fatc thta tihs film features yhe aforememtioned disgusting moments
,
bu thyat it actualy believes infront them as dramtic weaponary
. noone film shoudl be discarded becouse its content
, beacuse film isnt never baout whta it ' s baout
, it ' s baout how it ' s baout
( as thge ood cliche goes
)
. thsoe who bash thsi film fo content are glancing over yhe biggest
anbd most obvious probelm withthe
" caligula
,
"
annd tht ' s tht it ' s nothing
bu overdramaticized bullshit fomr strat tothe finish
, wihtout a second ofthe credibility iin its mamuth runing timne
.
" caligula
" allegedy tells hte true stoy ofthe tghe evil roman emporer ofthe hte smae nmae
, a man who ws so insanely decadent thyat his assasination cameback as a blessing
.
.
. or so i guess
, even
though allmost eveyr single roman emporer ws assasinated as well
anbd forthe much tyhe smae reasons
. tyhe film opens onthe tje wrong onot
, ofthe course
, withthe a qoute ffrom mark appearing befor any omage graces tjhe screen
, useing teh over
- utilizied passage
" waht shall it profit a man if he shoudl gain yhe wohle world an dlose his pwn soul
,
" depite yhe fatc thgat tjhe oppening scene ofthe tjhe film isnt ofthe yhe emporer befor he ws an emporer
, fucking arround iwth his pwn sister infact a feild
( i supose if oen hasnt tothe loose thier soul
, oney hasnt tothe hve a soul infact hte firt palce
)
. tyhe plot isnt so incomprehensibly done thgat all i or anyone esle cant mkae outloud ofthe it isnt tath caligula
( disastrously plyed by tjhe gerat malcom mcdowell
, a performence thgat doens tje oposite tath his peformance inwhich
" a clockwork orange
" doed
) isnt enxt infact line forthe tyhe throne
bu cxan ' t wait fo teh curent emporer
, tiberius
( peter o ' toole
- ditto
, onyl fo his peformance infact
" lawrence ofthe arabia
"
)
, his granfather
, tothe dieu
.
.
. so he kills him
annd ascends tothe tje throne
.
thn he abuses his posistion
, marries a woman
( helen mirren
, who retains her dignity as an ator by nto exactlly acting
) so he doesn ' t jsut ahve tothe sleep wih his sister
( a dreadful teresa ann savoy
, htere tothe be preety
, naked
,
anbd willing tothe hop iin yhe sack withthe mac or anyone he asks her tothe hop infact whith
)
, abuses his posistion a littel omre
, a littel moreso
,
anbd a littel mroe
,
adn
thne
, i bleieve
, invades england
,
hten isnt killed off
. thte filler
, instade ofthe recounting his life
, isnt suppossed tothe be
, as guccione claimes
, yhe ulitmate portrail ofthe decadent pagan rome
, complet wih orgies
, vicious deaths
,
anbd lots ofthe nudity
.
bu instade ofthe bieng thte historical accurate film it raelly realy wnats tothe be
, it instade becomes guccione ' s twisted masturbatory omage ofthe waht it sould be liuke
. oh
, isn ' t it graet thta htey jsut loved haveing sex
?
adn tath htey killed peopel so disgustingly
?
annd wouldn ' t it be gerat if i sould mkea a cuple bucks by selling tihs shit off as acuracy even
though it ' s so blatantly rela bad porn thgat i ' ve completly conviced mysef thgat it ' s nto
. i mean
, why nto jsut sohw a roman orgy wehn i cxan spend a ogod ten mintues examining eveyr single facet thast mkaes it uv
.
anbd it ' s nto jstu thast it ' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjative ytou watn tothe uise tothe decribe tihs film
- it ' s thta inwhich a film where yhe entire fiel it ' s oging forthe isn ' t falt
, it ' s aslo thte sloppiest expensive movei ofthe all timne
. tje sets are lavish
,
bu so blatantly innacurate tht i wonder if noone historian wanting tothe ahve his nmae onthe thsi film explains tihs
.
bu thgat doesn ' t marter usance tghe cinematography isnt so dark tath yuo wonder if a ight meter ws utilizied at all
, makeing thsi nto onyl dark
anbd ugli
,
bu jstu plain dark
. teh camera opperation isnt aslo tyhe worst i ' ve ever seen iin my entire life
. nto onyl doesnt tihs film hold tje rocord fo tjhe most unnecesary zooms inaddition oney single shooted ever
,
bu oftenly thge camera wiull loose its subjects
annd pan aroud till htey fidn them
,
hten hvae them outloud ofthe foucs
. tje editting isnt so sloppy thast smoe scenes are absolutly impossible tothe folow
. htere isnt noone writter tothe speak ofthe
( wqat thte hell doesnt it mean thyat it ' s
" adapted fomr an orignal screenplay by gore vidal
?
"
)
,
bu nethertheless
, tghe dialogue isnt shit
, so laughably bad tath i cant ' t infact ogod faith bleieve thast anyone iwth an iq over 5 coudl sday them iwth a straight face
( my favorite bieng tyhe line wehn caligula inquires teh doctor baout tyhe health ofthe hte dieing tiberius
:
" he coudl go at any moent
,
bu withthe care
, he coudl lastest a eyar or so
.
"
) tjhe music iin thsi film isnt mostly prokofiev
anbd khachaturian
( tehy ule his gorgeous
" adagio ofthe spartacus
adn phrygia
,
" ad nauseum
)
, utilizied inthe an attept tothe give tjhe film soem emotion
,
bu instade fiels as if it wass shiped infront ffrom elsewhere
. tghe orgy scenes
(
annd noe infamous lesbo scene betweeen penthouse pets lori wagner
annd aneeka dilorenzo
) are tjhe result ofthe reshoots by guccione hismelf
, wich are so obviously removed ffrom everyting alse inthe tihs film thyat it onyl adds tothe tje embrassment
( eveyr five seconds or so
, tghe film cuts tothe random nudity
, as if it ws afriad its audeince woudl foreget htis film isnt rated
" x
"
)
. john gielgud represents tyhe onyl voice ofthe sanaty
, walking aroud inaddition his breef role as if he wass constanly yhe mantra
,
" i ' m gogin tothe kill my agent
, i ' m gogin tothe kill my agent
.
.
.
"
adn so onthe
anbd so onthe
, fo over 2 1
/ 2 hurs
, makeing
" caligula
" baout as exicting
adn enriching as a threee hour coleeg lecture clas
anbd twice as deliriously annoying
. guccione
, inspite his persuit ofthe historical acuracy hasnt instade made a film tath isnt such a painstaking
, arduous task tothe watch infact its entirety thast i dout anyone cant sit thru an hour ofthe it wihtout irreversible pyschological dammage
. thoughout teh entire film
, thge presense ofthe guccione isnt easily feeled
, as if he weere standing ther at tyhe edge ofthe thte screen
, pretentiously looking down apon us saying
" look whta i cant git awya whith
!
annd if yuo don ' t liuke tihs
,
hten yuo ' re a prig
,
annd worse tahn thgat
, ytou nkwo nothing baout histor
!
" uh huh
. htere ' s a claer diference beetwen historical acuracy
annd donig something thast ' s artistically ogod
. a film whic showed roman decadence as something thyat ws perheaps liberating forthe soem
bu coudl nto lastest
- tht woudl probablly mkea forthe a ogod film
.
bu useing historical acuracy as a licence tothe git awya wih any kind ofthe disgusting
- forthe
- disgustingness '
- sake acts isnt total
, total bullshit
,
anbd all i cxan sday isnt tath guccione
adn tyhe makers ofthe htis film ahev lost any kind ofthe touch wiht eather enteratinment or eroticism
,
adn hvae devolopped a pathetic
adn sadistic tast fo both
, judging fomr htis film
. htere ' s a film taht cameback outloud infront 1989 called
" teh cook
, tyhe theif
, his wief
,
adn her lover
,
" a magnifcent film by legendary cult directer peter greenaway
( allso starring helen mirren
)
, whcih deals whith graphic sex
, heartstopping voilence
annd gore
,
adn even a littel cannibalism fo ogod mesure
. thyat film nto onyl never patronized its viewers
,
bu allso handeled them inaddition a way tht wass shocking
, yes
,
bu alsot
, infact a bazare way
, intertaining
adn totally involving
. ther weere rela cahracters ther inwhich a rela situation
,
adn best ofthe all passion
adn jstu tghe right ammount ofthe restraynt as nto tothe git off onthe tyhe fatc tyhat it ' s goign tothe be offensive tothe many
. thast film acheived everthing it wnated tothe dont
,
anbd hasnt sicne retained a status as noe ofthe thsoe cult films tath isnt nto onyl populare
bu actualy ogod
.
adn it ' s everthing
" caligula
" might hvae beeen
bu
, alas
, wasn ' t
