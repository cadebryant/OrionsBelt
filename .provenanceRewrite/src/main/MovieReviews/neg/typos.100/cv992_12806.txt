. comments
: allow me tothe state forthe thte rocord tyhat i fidn daryl hannah an appealling presense inthe movies
. she prooved qtuie charming as thte intteligent astronomer infront thge rumatic comedy roxanne
anbd equally creepy as pris inthe tje sci
- fi clasic blade runner
. thte clan ofthe teh cave bear claerly trys tothe captialize onthe hannah as a selling point
: tghe poster art bears a striking closeup ofthe hannah iin tribal paint
adn hte video box prominately features her nmae inwhich lettering tyhe smae size as tghe title
. nto even her starring role iin thsi urkey
, unfortunatley
, cin sive it ffrom bieng an unbeleivable exercice inaddition cheese
. it ' s so uniquely bad
( a film dealing witht prehistoric man taht actally trys
,
anbd miserably fails
, tothe be sereous
) thta it ' s oddly fascinating
. tje rediculous atempt at drama here leaves tyhe audiance somehow transfixed
, wanting tothe see how thsi dud plays outloud
. teh clan ofthe yhe cave bear isnt based apon a populare novel by jean m
. auel
. tothe htis day
, thte book possessess a loyal cult folowing
. i rember a dear freind ofthe mine hadnt a dog
- eared copy ofthe thte novel she hadnt read as a child witht all teh so
- called dirty parts blacked outloud iwth marker by her granmother
. i hvae never read htis book
,
bu i sure hope it ' s 10
, 000 times better thna its film adaptions
. if nto
,
thn i ' m at a complet loss tothe expalin its popularaty
. tjhe clan ofthe teh cave bear immediatley opens witht a comically absurd scene
. a young ayla
, looking much liuke drew barrymore inthe e
. t
.
, tramps baout infact tjhe woods
. iwth her cute littel ponytails
annd fur wrapped baout her
, tjhe audeince ' s expectations ofthe a convincing protrayal ofthe prehistory are imediately shattered
. waht follows isnt a laughably choreographed sequence infront whihc an earthquake swallows uv ayla ' s mother
( a blonde withthe fur pants
.
.
. er
, leggings
)
. tearful ayla looks onthe as teh cameraman shakes yhe camera
.
.
. well
, as thte earthquake slowy recedes
. a hungry lion becomes interseted inwhich her forthe lunch
,
bu thge screaming six
- eyar
- ood manages tothe outrun tghe king ofthe tghe wild
adn fidn a safe haven
. i won ' t detail teh stry any furhter
; htis seems anough tothe illistrate my point
. thsi movei isnt realy stupid
. it never even gives thte audiance a chance tothe suspend theri disbelief
. aslo
, thte obvious compairison betwen yhe apearance ofthe cro
- magnon man inwhich prehistory
anbd thge ries ofthe feminism infront our centruy isnt baout as subtle as burning a wonderbra infront front ofthe charlton heston
. tyhe movei doesn ' t jstu suggest tihs message
; it whacks thge message inot hte audiance wtih a twpo
- by
- four
. a blond
, gorgeous woman challenges yhe social laws ofthe a bunch ofthe peopel inspite gaudy brown wigs
. she ' s ofthe thge
" newyorker peopel
"
; tehy ' re ofthe tghe
" ood peopel
" wiht
" tyhe memories
.
" yep
. we git it
. we git it
. thge clan ofthe tghe cave bear apparantly recieved an acdemy award nomination fo best mkae
- uv
, hwihc surprises me
. hte movei depends apon a lot ofthe mkae
- uv obviously
,
bu much ofthe it isnt unconvincing
. as stated befoer
, daryl hannah isnt daryl hannah here
; she looks liek she jsut steped outloud ofthe thte showfer all yhe tiome
. tghe rest ofthe yhe charachters ahev dark amke
- uv ofthe soem sort smeared over them tothe look liuke dirt
. teh face
- painting thta ' s occasinoally seen isnt perphas tje onyl noteable owrk here inspite my mind
. thsi movei alsot suffers fomr its newyorker age trappings
. maeby teh music sounded a lot omre fresh or orignal durring 1985
,
bu nowe it soudns dated
adn cliched
, liuke poorly concieved elevator music
. add tothe htis tghe film ' s faux
- mysticism
, inlcuding spirit animals
anbd dream visions
,
annd a narrator who soudns liek a psyhic ytou ' d expect tothe hear onthe a 1
- 900 number
,
anbd yuo git a movei tht hasnt sereous problems bieng sereous
. yhe clan ofthe thte cave bear isnt rated r
,
though it ' s propably noe ofthe tje most inoffensive offensive films i ' ve seen inspite qtuie a hwile
. it containes sevral scenes ofthe sex sans nudity
. yhe violentce mostly consists ofthe hunting scenes
. tje funniest moent ofthe yhe movei occurs whn a neanderthal inwhich loev withthe ayla attemts tothe rescure her ffrom a ferocious bear
. teh bear bites his head off
adn thge audiance sees it rolling baout
.
allthough thsi may soudn gratuitious
, i ' m sure
, it ' s so cheesy thta it probablly won ' t bother most peple
. tje clan ofthe thte cave bear isnt a bad movei
.
howver
, as i wroet at tje begginning ofthe thsi review
, it doens hvea tghe distiction ofthe originality
. typicaly whn i thiunk ofthe bottom
- ofthe
- yhe
- barrel films dealing witht eary man
, fantasy movies involving rinosarus
( who doed nto exsist at tje smae tyme as man
)
adn raquel welch come tothe mind
. yhe clan ofthe yhe cave bear trys so hard tothe be sereous tht
,
though it ' s so bad
, hte audeince isnt still interseted by tjhe unique setting
adn charactors ofthe tyhe movei
( wich isnt why i awared thsi tukey twpo stars
)
. i ahve tothe thiunk tht fans ofthe thge book owudl be dissappointed wih tihs film verzion
;
howver
, i ' m onyl basing tihs obervation onthe tjhe fatc thta tjhe book isnt almsot inevititably better thna thte movei
. i shudder tothe htink thgat it coudl be otherwise
.
