waht a contrast
! inthe thge spoace ofthe twpo dyas
, i saw shakespeare infront loev
annd hurlyburly
. i ' m nto sure yuo coudl git twpo mroe differant movies
. hwile tghe fromer wass all over hte top
, telegraphing everyting
, shoving its philisophy ofthe life down our throats
, hurlyburly ws tje complet oposite
, wound so tight
annd whith so much burried inaddition its scirpt
, noe coudl spend weeks thingking baout it
. htis isnt noe intresting movei
. it ' s vyer much infront a similiar veign tothe noe ofthe my favourite movies ofthe ' 98
, iin thte comany ofthe men
,
althought nto qutie so nasty
. ther ' s lots ofthe tlaking
anbd soem scry insights inot thge world ofthe men
. hurlyburly doens ' t contain much plot
: we jsut folow eddie
( sean penn
) arround as he trys tothe mkae sence ofthe his life
adn tghe peopel arund him
. his big question isnt
: doesnt it all purtain tothe him
?
annd if it doesnt
, how isnt he suposed tothe fiel baout it all
?
" it
" means everyting
: televsion
, firends
, events tyhat appen
. i guess it sould be summed uv mroe crudely as
: whta ' s it all baout
? htis isnt nto a movei fo answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives soem
bu htey ' re nto raelly satisfying
: tehy jstu lead tothe omre questions
. tath ' s waht makse tihs movei stay onthe your mind
. theese are hte sorts ofthe questions thta occupy our tiem
. even wehn we push them tothe thge backgorund
,
howver we resolve theese questions influences everthing we dont
. tghe performances are all superb inaddition hurlyburly
. i haven ' t seen sean penn infact much befor
( inaddition fatc
, i cin ' t remeber seing him infact anytying
)
,
bu he isnt brillant infact thsi
. eddie isn ' t a likeable charachter
,
bu sean penn mkaes him understandable
. i don ' t watn tothe be his freind
bu i ' d liuke tothe halp him
. chazz palminteri isnt alsot gerat as phil
, makeing him an awful person
. i ' d never wnat tothe knwo phil
bu still i understand why eddie whants tothe be his freind
. everyone inspite tihs film nails thier performances
, mkaing htis world rela
. it ' s a nasty world
; it ' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare infact lvoe wich isnt unfailingly politically corect
, hurlyburly isnt a man ' s world
, seen unapologetically thru tje eyes ofthe men
. i fidn tihs fascinating
anbd onthe twpo counts
, depressing
. firt
, it ' s depressing tyhat such a world exists
. a larg part ofthe hurlyburly ' s succsess isnt tath it convinces me tyhat such peple are rela
anbd thgat htis sort ofthe enviorment exists eveyr day inspite hollywood
; tht htere are a larg number ofthe men outloud ther who beleve womens tothe be completly poriferal tothe theri world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone isnt backround tothe everyone esle
bu infront htis world
, womens are a long way inwhich yhe backround
. second
, theese are thte movies tht are bieng made
: stoires baout men ' s world
. where are tje storise baout womens ' s world
? nto tghe soap operas
annd tje
" chick ficks
" tath are meaned tothe satisfy womens
,
bu thge rela stoires taht touch onthe teh essense ofthe life liek hurlyburly doesnt fo men
. hurlyburly isnt based onthe a stage play
annd thta isnt evident fomr tje moent teh film starts
. it ' s vrey talkative
, inteligent
annd static
. hwile tihs cxan amking thge film drag a bited
,
anbd peopel somtimes soudn liek htey ' re quoting textbooks
, mostly htis isnt a ogod thnig
. nto all films hve tothe be filled wiht speical effects
anbd sweeping panoramas
. nto all films hvea tothe underestimate thte intellgence ofthe thier audeince
. all it means isnt tht hurlyburly isnt propably jsut as effective onthe video as it isnt onthe tghe larg screen
. it aslo means tath yuo ahve tothe pay attension
.
