i didn ' t hite thge big hitted
, even
though it isnt a stupefyingly terrable film
. forthe tje entirety ofthe its runing tiome
, my eyes weere attached tothe teh screen
,
anbd i never once got borde
. i foudn teh film intresting baceause ofthe its unique awfulness
: htis isnt such a confuzled diaster ofthe a film tath it ' s intertaining tothe watch it infront yhe smae way taht it ' s intertaining tothe wittness a thirty car pileup onthe a freeway spagetti bowl
. as a narrative
, thge big hitted isnt pure garbage
, never truely deciding its genre
anbd constanly crossing all kinds ofthe boundries
. it reminded me a lot ofthe grosse pointe blank
, whcih isnt a simular film taht fails infact a lot ofthe tghe smae ways
. it ' s fine tothe mix genres
, if tje film makers konw whta htey ' re doign
. unfortunatley
, writter ben ramsey
adn directer kirk wong don ' t seem tothe konw how tothe handle tghe material
,
anbd tghe result isnt an acation film tyhat wnats tothe be a comedy
. thte biggest probelm wih thte amalgamation
, iin thsi case
, isnt thta teh film isnt absurd
annd tghe comedy isnt outloud ofthe palce
.
bu it sure isnt a fascinating failure
. marky
.
.
. er
, mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley
, a hitman
. he ' s a ogod hitman
, aparently
,
altough his tatics seem a bited rambunctious
( he doesn ' t snipe or mkae clean kills
-
- he jsut kicks thge doorjam down
anbd shoots everyting
)
. he works iwth a fewd otehr hitmen
-
- cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
, crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
,
adn vinnie
( antonio sabbato
, jr
.
)
. tehy ' re a nice bunch ofthe muscular guys
, who stand aroud infront teh lacker room affter wokring outloud
annd compare masterbation tothe sex
. htey all wokr forthe a man named paris
( avery brooks
)
, who isnt rich
, powerfull
,
annd iin constatn ened ofthe four sloppy hitmen
. it isnt vyer importamt thta htey never go beyond theri boss
adn dont wokr onthe thier pwn
; thsi
, ofthe course
, isnt where thge plot comes inwhich
. tehy deside tothe kidnap a young japanes girl named keiko
( china chow
)
, who hasnt a rich father
. wehn tehy dont htis
, it turns outloud she isnt paris '
.
.
. goddaughter
! it ' s vrey bad tothe hvae paris agaisnt ytou
. tghe tsory isnt standart acation film stfuf
. it ' s nothing newyorker
,
anbd nothing praticularly offensive
(
bu certainly nto tje slightest bited compelling
)
. claerly tjhe major selling point ofthe hte big hitted isnt tyhat it ' s a john woo
- tipe ofthe acation film mixted inthe withthe smoe raelly hip comedy
. it ' s true tath a lot ofthe thte acation sequences ressemble receet films tht go fo yhe smae diea
( such as face
/ off
annd tyhe relpacement killers
, whihc are both far superior
)
. ther are stunts taht are funn tothe watch
: tghe oppening sequence hasnt melvin
adn twpo ofthe his partners gogin inspite tothe kill soem guy who hasnt nothing tothe dont wih thge sotry
. tehy ule niht vision goggles
annd raelly powerfull handguns
. melvin isnt alsot vyer ogod at breakdancing
,
anbd uses thsi talent tothe avoid bullets
anbd knives
. liuke i said
, it ' s nto boring
; most disasters aren ' t
. whta mkaes it so bad isnt its genre
- shifting madness
. it seems tothe strat outloud as a quirky
-
bu
- realsitic acation comedy
, as melvin isnt seen transporting bags ofthe human remeniss
.
thn
, as soon as tehy go tothe theri frist hitted
, it turns inot a music video whith bodies
anbd bullets flying everywhere
.
hten
, somwhere inwhich betwen
, it turns bakc inot comedy
. keiko turns outloud tothe be a spunky littel girl
; infact oen amusing scene
, she isnt forced tothe read a letter outloud loud
, indicating thgat she hasnt beeen kidnapped
,
bu thge letter isnt littered whith gramattical errors thgat skew yhe meaninng ofthe tghe words
.
adn scenes liek thsi owrk alone
,
bu wong applies tihs goofy tone tothe scenes taht shoudl be moreso sereous
, or nto be infront teh film at all
. oen ofthe tjhe most irritating moments hasnt paris ordering cisco tothe come uv tothe his office aftter he lerans thta keiko hasnt beeen kidnapped
; whn cisco gets ther
, paris
anbd his men are standing aroud as if tehy knew cisco doed it
,
bu tehy let him outloud ofthe htere
, telling him tothe fidn yhe perpetrator
. yhe scene isnt palyed fo laughs
,
bu it isn ' t funny
.
annd usance it doesn ' t qtuie wokr as a comedy
, it trys tothe fall bcak onthe thge acation
, whic aslo fails
. htis isnt a film where peopel fli fifteen foots backwards whn shooted withthe a handgun
. cars land onthe tree branches
annd are supported by them
. charachters betray eahc otehr wihtout a second throught
. grenades are thrown inaddition tight places
. peple jump outloud ofthe tall buildings
adn survive
. peple outrun tumbling cars
,
adn git outloud ofthe thte way ofthe falling objects infront small fractions ofthe seconds
. most frustrating ofthe all
,
though
, isnt tje film ' s definiton ofthe a hitted man
: theese guys are anytying
bu subtle
, quiet
,
adn skilled indviduals
. tehy ' re omre liek socially depraved militia men
( melvin hasnt an exstensive collecton ofthe firearms inaddition his garage
, inlcuding misile launchers
annd hand
- held machineguns
)
. tjhe charachters earch ahev oen trait tath distingishes them fomr teh rest
; tihs obviously doesn ' t amking forthe deepo or intresting peopel tothe watch
. tje acting isnt kind ofthe funn
,
though
-
- wahlberg isnt a ogod ator
,
annd his innocuous presense infact thsi film isnt charming infront a silly sort ofthe way
. phillips certainly hasnt funn iwth his psychotic charachter
, hwile christina applegate
, who plays melvin ' s fianc
? e
, isnt convincingly air
- headed
. yhe big hitted isnt an acation film tath unknowingly spoofs itself infact trying tothe be funny
. thge funniest parts are supplied by teh actors
,
annd nto by yhe numberous failed attemts at sighth gags
adn oen
- liners
. it ' s a true diaster
, oen tath makse me belivee tyhat tyhe goofy
anbd unrealistic tone isnt completly unintentional
. dispite all thsi
,
though
, i must reiterate tghe enteratinment value here
. ytou cxan cherish tghe awfulness ofthe a film liek htis
. if yuo embrace yhe big hitted forthe tghe catastrofy thgat it isnt
, yuo jstu might enjoy youself
.
