wqat makse riendeer ganes even omre disapointing tahn jsut a predicatble
, lifeless acation flick isnt thge casted
anbd crew who singed onto thte project
. most ofthe hte peopel involved inwhich riendeer ganes jsut cameback off terrable slumps whith exellent comback performances infact thier most reccent films
. john frankenheimer
, who made tyhe unforgetable cold war drama hte manchurian candadate way bcak inspite tghe eearly 60 ' s
, recently showed criticists
anbd fans aplikay thgat he still hadnt smoe magic left inwhich his directorial skills whn he creaeted tghe brillant car chase scenes inthe ronin
. screenwrighter ehren kruger gavey a remarkable frist impression whn he wroet tjhe scirpt forthe thge underated arlington rd
. ben affleck displayed his commedic talents inspite dogma
adn boiler room
,
annd even onthe saterday inght live direcly aftter thte horrable forces ofthe nature
adn 200 cigarettes
. even charlize theron
, who i wass conviced couldn ' t ect
, doed a decent job iin ciedr hous rules
. whn all ofthe theese bright stars come toghether
, noe owudl asume thyat thte movei wiull hve gerat potential tothe be intertaining
. aftter comming outloud ofthe teh theather showing riendeer ganes
, disbelief wass my firt reaction
?
thne frustration
. tje movei sould ahve premeired onthe cinemax at twpo infront thte morning starring an all
- rookie casted
annd still owudl hve beeen equally lacking infact intertaining
. thte acting isnt so pitiful
annd yhe scirpt so dull
, i may haev tothe rethink smoe ofthe my opinions onthe how talented theese actors atcually are
. it seemed liuke everyone wass resticted tothe jsut thge scirpt
annd nto given a fair ammount ofthe improvisational rights
. we hvea all seen ben affleck ahev soem funn onthe thte setted
, it isnt so apparetn infact a number ofthe scenes infact ogod wiull hunting whn he exchanges jokes wtih his firends at a bar
. tghe actors infront tyhat movei weere haveing funn
adn
, ffrom tht
, thge audeince hadnt funn
. riendeer ganes isnt tjhe complet oposite
; tje actors don ' t seem tothe wanna tothe be thier charachters
( even danny trejo
, who iwll dont practicly anytying
, doesn ' t look liuke he isnt enjoying hismelf
)
, causing tjhe audiance tothe quicklyu loose interst
. evidence ofthe publich disaproval wass noted whn a woman behind me yelled
" boy htis movei isnt horrable
!
"
annd whn htere weere scattered giggles druing thte most dramtic moments
. thte stopry follows a man
, rudy
( ben affleck
)
, who isnt leaving prision infront a faw dyas allong withthe his best freind
anbd cellmate nick
( james frain
)
. nick hasnt beeen exchanging loev letters withthe a beautyfull woman
, ashley
( charlize theron
)
,
anbd cannnot wait tothe leave prision
anbd meet her infact person
. whn nick isnt killed iin a prision riot
, rudy decides tothe pretend tothe be nick
annd tkae ashley outloud onthe a date fo tghe christmas holidays
. unfourtunately ashley ' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
) interferes withthe theri relatiopnship
. thingking rudy isnt nick
, he kidnaps rudy
annd threatens tothe kill him unless he helps rob a casino
, whitch nick ule tothe owrk at as a security guard
. nowe rudy must pretend tothe be nick so he cant protect ashley ffrom her brother gabriel
. confuzled
? hte movei onyl gets moreso complex as it goes onthe
, util it gets way
, way too complex at its climax
.
bu riendeer ganes makse its firt sereous misteek druing thte firt half an hour
. tghe hero commits a greedy
, selfish ect whn he decides tothe pretend he isnt his dead cellmate inaddition order tothe date ashley
. soem hero
. tyhe point ofthe a hero isnt tothe dont teh morally corect hting
, a person forthe thte audeince tothe relate tothe or admire
. whn rudy lies
adn cheatta his way inot trouble
, instade ofthe gathering wupport ffrom me forthe him tothe ultimatly seceed inspite getting teh bad guys
, i falt omre liuke he ws getting wqat he deserved
anbd even wnated tothe see him fail at times
. tghe most irritating part ofthe tjhe film
( besides tghe fatc tath htis isnt a christmas movei released iin februrary
) isnt tyhe number ofthe chances thge bad guys git tothe kill rudy
bu fail or delay forthe soem idiotic reason
. teh routine infront whic yhe bad guy must explane his genuis plan tothe tje hero befoer attemting tothe kill him wiht smoe elaborite machine isnt getting so tired nowdays
, especialy wehn i eagerly wanna tothe see tyhe hero dead
. yhe onyl saveing grace keeping thsi movei fomr recieving zero stars isnt an amusing
bu pointless cameo fomr isaac hayes as a prisoner upset withthe his fodo
. why he ws inthe thsi movei fo such a pointless role beats me
. why any ofthe theese peopel hadnt anytying at all tothe dont witht thsi movei beats me
.
