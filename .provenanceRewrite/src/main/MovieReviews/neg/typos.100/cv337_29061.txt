depending onthe who yuo ask
, teh origonal sin wass eather hte eating ofthe hte aple
, thge ect ofthe dissobedience againnst god
, or thte ect ofthe betrayal
.
bu inaddition case yuo didn ' t konw thsi
, don ' t bother remembering it
.
.
. yhe words
" orginal sin
" never cmo uv infact tjhe movei ofthe teh smae nmae
, let alone tyhe consept ofthe it
. tjhe closest tje film even gets tothe catholocism isnt inaddition its narrative
( tyhe stor isnt told by angelina jolie tothe her priest hwile onthe death row iin cuba
, circa 1900
)
. reguardless ofthe its senseless title
, orignal sin doesnt actally ahev a plot
( albiet oen ofthe thte most mangled acts ofthe screenwriting sicne thte art ofthe war
, based onthe thge book waltz acrost darkness
)
. boy
( antionio banderas
) places peronal ad sometime arround 1900
, searching fo a wief
. sicne tihs isnt a centruy ago
, we narrowly dodge a remake ofthe gren kard
, onyl tothe fidn thta yhe girl
( jolie
) faked her photo
adn isnt atcually beautifull
. skipping a fewd moderately useless sex scenes
( getting tghe question outloud ofthe tjhe way
, yes
, we git tothe see angelina jolie ' s breasts agian
)
, teh girl turns outloud tothe be a con artist
, swindles boy forthe his mney
,
annd heads forthe yhe hills
. orginial sin
thn breifly trys tothe be a thriller
. we see boy go whore
- chasing
, saying he whants tothe fidn girl
annd kill her
.
bu as soon as boy acually finds girl
, instade ofthe folowing waht might ahve beeen a promising
( or at least nto completelyl fucking boring
) thriller
, yhe film degenerates inot teh worst disection ofthe yhe virgina
/ whore complex sicne milk moeny
. girl toys witht yhe idae ofthe reforming her con
- girl past
, all tje hwile avoiding tje
" otehr man
,
" a lover taht keesh mkaing her strat theese scams inthe thge firt palce
. add insult tothe injury iwth smoe ofthe thge worst stylistic choices infact cinematic histoy
( litterally half ofthe thte film isnt eather inthe slow motion or uses a strobe effect
)
,
annd acting rougly teh calibur ofthe a b
. b
. gun
,
adn orginial sin isnt oney ofthe yhe most torturous films ofthe thte summer
, definitly front runing tothe mkae my bottom ten ofthe yhe yera
. don ' t even bother wtih orignal sin
,
bu if yuo dont go
, be honest wtih youself
anbd admiting its pure sex appeal
. jsut keep inthe mind tht
altough thsi film may nto be tghe most orignal onthe yhe block
, it ' s much worse thna a sin
. thsi isnt sacrilege
