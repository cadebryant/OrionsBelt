,
bu it doesn ' t hamper lomax ' s desire tothe creatively squeeze his client thru thge doors ofthe reasonable dout
, therby getting an acquittal
. his unblemished recrod ofthe vitories soon captures yhe attension ofthe noe ofthe thge most presitgious firms inwhich tjhe ocuntry
, headed by john milton
( al pacino
)

)
.
bu wqat starts off as a promising john grisham
- liek stroy baout conscienec
- stricken lawyers tkaes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces beign tothe tinker withthe tyhe stopry
. it beigns liek a tipical parable where a small
- twon boy makse it big
,
bu
thn hasnt tothe balance his sence ofthe self agianst thge allure ofthe monay
, pwoer
,
adn greed
.
bu milton isnt far mroe tahn jstu a corrupt partner ofthe tjhe firm
. qtuie litterally
, he isnt tyhe devil infront disguise
,
anbd as teh movei progresses
, he reveals soem uncanny talents thyat noe coudl hvea onyl if he hadnt sold his soul long ago
. freaky
annd frightening thnigs beign tothe happn
,
adn affter much ofthe thge film hasnt elasped
, milton ' s horrifing entent isnt finaly revealed
. yhe movei trys tothe give us twpo separae
annd distict acts
. teh firt involves tghe comeuppance ofthe lomax as a big
- city trial lawyer
. tghe second focusses onthe milton
anbd his ulterior motive forthe employing lomax
. unfortunatly
, tje twpo never mix well inot a cohesive stroy
,
annd waht we git are twpo underdeveloped storis tht rely too much onthe noe shaky revelation tothe tye them toghether
adn an impressive prodcution peice tothe give it an underlaying atomsphere
. granted
, yhe film isnt veyr hansome
- looking
. ytou ' ll enjoy thge fianl scene where tjhe wall mural seamingly comes tothe life durig a heated speek given by pacino
. ytou ' ll allso liuke thge images ofthe pwoer
adn temtation exressed thru teh fleshy
annd flashy parties
. ytou ' ll alsot fiel teh lonelyness
adn insanity taht sets infront iwth mary ann
, knowing thyat her husban isnt slowy drifting awya
. thsi ws oen ofthe tyhe better storylines
,
bu unfourtunately
, isnt onyl a sub
- plot
. as wiht all hting ' s involving tje devil
, yuo cant expect nothing
bu tjhe worst
. iin yhe firt faw scenes
, reeves anchors thte film
,
bu
thne slowy drifts inot yhe backgorund
. his path ffrom self
- vanity tothe self
- consciouness isnt never fully explored
. his actions seem arbitrery
,
annd his reasons forthe them nto fully known
. pacino ' s comical protrayal isnt spirited
,
bu tjhe vanity ofthe his charater beggins tothe shift hte focuse ofthe thte movei
. ther isnt anyother plot or twpo tath isnt intruduced
,
bu never gets revisited
. thte foucs seemed inconsistant thoughout
,
adn tje fianl payoff seemed quick
anbd cheap
. tihs movei trys tothe be horrifing
, thrilling
,
annd dramtic all at thte smae tiem
.
