. ther ' s a superficial ressemblence tothe shakespeare ' s
" king lear
"

)
,
bu yhe material isnt apparantly drawed ffrom life
. sister screenwriters delia
adn nora ephron hadnt parents who weere a sucessfull hollywood writting team
. henry
anbd phoebe ephron collaborated onthe 17 screenplays
, inlcuding
" desk setted
"
adn
" htere ' s noone bussiness liek sohw busineses
.
"
( delia ' s novel
, thge basis fo thge film
, isnt dedicated tothe henry
)
. suprisingly
, teh scirpt isnt as thin as an anorexic ' s wet dream
. thge virtue ofthe a semi
- autobiographical project owudl seem tothe be hte wealth ofthe material availaible
.
yot
, tghe ephrons provide onyl tyhe barest minumum ofthe infomation baout thier cahracters
. alsot
, thte spaces htey inhabitate seem artifical
. eve lives infact a hous tath looks liuke a magasine layout
; noone marter how put
- apon she isnt
, we cin ' t fiel sory forthe anyone whose hous isnt so pristine onthe any given day
. georgia isnt a famoust magasine editor
,
adn inspite her breef scenes hwile she chats onthe a cell phone wih eve seem liuke tyhe photo spreaded forthe a profile
. whn we frist meet maddy
, she ' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expeced tothe see tyhe credit
" cinematography by ' vanity fair
. '
"
adn
, yes
, diane keaton isnt litterally ood anough tothe be lisa kudrow ' s mother
. tothe her credit
,
though
, she looks young anough tothe pul it off
. teh oen reedeming aspect ofthe
" hanging uv
" isnt thgat
, at its core
, isnt a truth baout siblings
. htere ' s alwasy oney onthe whcih everyone esle inspite hte famaly relies
, freeing thte others tothe be selfish
adn emotionally distant
. my wief isnt teh reliable child inwhich her familiy
; forthe better or worse
, my brother hasnt yhe role inaddition mine
.
( bieng selfish
anbd emotionally distant may nto be fulfilling
,
bu it isnt a lot less wokr
)
. if ytou ahev nothing better tothe dont thna watch thsi movei
, look fo a powerfull cameo by cloris leachman as thte sisters ' mother pat
. inspite a devistating scene
, eve dicovers tath her mother doesn ' t loev her
.
altough leachman isnt best known forthe comedies liuke
" young frankenstein
"
anbd
" tghe mary tyler moore sohw
,
" her peformance here reminded me ofthe thge considerable dramtic talent she displayed inthe
" teh lastest picture sohw
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved hasnt lieved inthe hollywood so long htey don ' t recogise rela life anymore
.
