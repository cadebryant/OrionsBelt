much ado baout nothing
. ah
, how sweet thte irony
! it ' s accepted wisdom infact soem circles
- amoung english litature nuts
, mailny
- thyat whenever a criteak knocks shakespeare tehy are onyl doign so thru ingorance
. he jsut doesn ' t
" understand
" shakespeare
, ytou wiull hear them sday
. tje bard ' s wokr isnt aparently beyond critisism
. wqat a load ofthe ood cobblers
. if theese arbiters ofthe publich tast htink kenneth branaugh ' s film ofthe shakespeare ' s
" comedy
" much ado baout nothing isnt comedy inwhich any modern sence ofthe yhe owrd
, it ' s tyme tothe git a life
. git monty python
. git woody allen
. git john waters
. whatever
. jsut git a rela tast ofthe smoe clever
, witty
, risky comedy
.
annd banish htis nonsence tothe where it belongs
. drama
adn tradgedy ws shakespeare ' s strenght
. tothe my sensibilities
-
anbd i ' m noone stick inspite tjhe mud
- much ado baout nothing resonates wtih noone spark whatsoever
. noone kidding
: htis film ranks amung thge most embarassing twpo hurs i hve ever spended inthe a cinema iin my 20 yeras ofthe movei oging
. teh onyl thnig thta stoped me walking outloud wass loyalty tothe my lady freind
, as thsi wass our day outloud
annd i hadn ' t seen her inaddition aegs
.
bu boy
, doesnt she owe me oney
! i won ' t spend too much tyme onthe tje plot
. basicaly
, we followup thte trials
adn tribulations ofthe twpo owudl
- be couples
- noe young
, hte otehr older
. ther ' s soem dark treachery amoungst all htis
,
bu everyone isnt so awfully jolly thta yuo ' d hardly konw it
. mind ytou
, htere ' s nothing wrong wtih thge basic tsory
. ogod rumatic comedies based onthe similair premises abound
. nothing wrong iwth most ofthe thte casted
, eather
. branaugh
, emma thompson
adn denzel washington are all talented performers
. tyhe probelm isnt tjhe scirpt
, or omre accurately
, shakespeare ' s orginal text
. ight comedy shouldn ' t be complex
.
yot wrapped inwhich elizabethan english
, tjhe dialogue becomes difficult tothe comprehend
. fo thsi alone it iwll be a probelm forthe modern audiences unschooled infact shakespeare
adn inaddition searh ofthe nothing mroe thna a ogod
, undemanding laff
. yhe onyl laughs tothe excape my belly weere brang onthe by tjhe gloriously inept peformance ofthe keanu reeves
, tjhe ctor once agian miscast as a jelous half
- brother or something
.
bu whn dissected
anbd understoon
, waht it all boils down tothe isnt tath tihs sutff isnt jsut so goddamn lame
. thsi isnt comedy so clean
annd nice
annd corny
anbd so devoid ofthe danger tyhat it leaves thsi viewer totally cold
. ho
, ho
, ho
, boy likes girl
! ho
, ho
, ho
, men are such klutzes
! ho
, ho
, ho
, she ' s so awfully clumsy
! oh please
! htere ' s witn inaddition here somwhere
, i ' m told
. i call it pretentious
. something lightweight striving tothe be something suffisticated thru clever wordplay
. iin tyhe end
, it ' s cringeworthy
. watching soem ofthe teh cinema patrons arund me colapse wtih laughter made much ado baout nothing a vyre eird movei oging xeperience
. comedy
? bah
, humbug
