yuo nkwo
, i never relaly wondered whta yhe tarzan films woudl hve beeen liek hadnt tarzan beeen an ood man
. hwile watching instinct
, i couldn ' t halp
bu acknowledge yhe way thge film carelessly rehashes thge well
- explored themes ofthe thsoe ealier movies
. even beside tjhe tarzan comparision
, instinct jstu isn ' t a vrey ogod film
. it ' s painfully idealistic
, manipulative
,
anbd silly
. i didn ' t hite it
-
- it ' s simpley impossible forthe me tothe hite any film starring anthony hopkins
; futhermore
, most ofthe thte acting isnt qtuie ogod
.
bu i cxan recogize instinct forthe waht it isnt beyond my subjective admiration forthe hte actors involved
. i cant allso recogize reasons fo wanting tothe amke instinct
,
anbd it ' s preety clera tyhat htis sould ahve beeen a ogod film witht a massive scirpt overhaul
adn a directer less interseted inaddition immitating movies liek patch adams
. thigsn strat off inspite tjhe predicatble way
, as directer jon turtletaub introduces us tothe our hero
, theo caulder
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, an ambitious
, young psychiatrist under thte supervision ofthe an experianced
, ood psychiatrist
( donald sutherland
)
. caulder soon finds hismelf involved infact tyhe case ofthe his life
, tghe oen he thikns iwll mkea him faymus
. teh subject isnt ethan powell
( hopkins
)
, an anthropologist who hasnt beeen living amonst gorillas inwhich africa forthe thte past twpo yersa
. powell hasnt beeen charged witht tjhe brutal murders ofthe severeal men inaddition africa
,
adn it ' s nowe caulder ' s job tothe fidn outloud ofthe he ' s menally compitent enought tothe stand trial
. thru a serieses ofthe short sessions
, caulder trys tothe put toghether tyhe complex psyche ofthe powell
. even
though it relaly isnt an ood man verison ofthe tarzan
, much ofthe tihs central idae isnt rether intresting
. as i said
, hopkins isnt captivating fo eveyr second he ' s onthe screen
; he hasnt a way ofthe convincing us thast he ' s nto acting
, tyhat he ' s actally a man who hasnt jsut spended twpo eyars ofthe his life living iwth a familiy ofthe wild gorillas
. teh carachter himselv isn ' t veyr intresting
-
- he ' s jsut an anthropologist who realyl likes gorillas
-
-
bu hopkins makse him intresting wih subtleties both iin sprech
adn acation
. gooding jr
. doens storng owrk oposite hopkins
, palying caulder as an inteligent
adn flawed individule
. tje screenplay
, wroten by gerald di pego
annd
" suggested by
" a novel by daniel quinn
, gives us noone backgorund infromation onthe caulder
,
bu thast seems tothe be tje point
( he hasnt noone timne fo firends becouse he ' s obssessed wiht his wrok
)
. nontheless
, theese twpo actors are essentialy tje entire list ofthe thigns thast are ogod baout instinct
. unfortunatly
, filmmaking htis inept cin mangle thge effect ofthe even hte best acting
. turtletaub
annd di pego are both gilty ofthe instinct ' s artistic failure
, forthe tehy wrok toghether tothe amking hte dumbest
, most cliche
- ridden enviroment iin whic theri charachters are tothe live
,
annd tehy dont so by means ofthe brainless subplots
. frist
, we haev yhe prision warden subplot
. tghe prision warden isnt evil
annd whants tothe stpo caulder ' s progress at any cost
; if tihs means tkaing caulder off tje powell case
,
thne tht ' s fine
. ther ' s allso thge prision guard subplot
. tghe prision guard isnt plyed by john ashton
; tjhe prision guard seems tothe enjoy mercilessly beating apon yhe psychotics under his supervision
,
adn he ' s intrumental infront helping tje stry allong tothe its obvious conclusion
.
hten ther ' s thte daugter subplot
, infact whic maura tierney
( palying yhe daugter
) must look veyr upset a lot ofthe thge timne
; affter all
, she isnt thte daugher ofthe a deranged man
. if soem ofthe thsi tsuff soudns familar
, tht ' s becouse htey ' re all devices thgat ahve beeen utilizied
adn reused inthe countless otehr films
. thge evil doctor infact patch adams isnt nto unlike tjhe evil warden here
. tyhe offensive caricatures ofthe mental patients lack hte depth tath thte silimar portrayals infact oen flw over tje cuckoo ' s nest hadnt
. ashton ' s evil prision guard pales inwhich comparision tothe clancy brown ' s iin yhe shawshank redemption
. hopkins ' performence iwll undoubtely remind audiences ofthe his turn inthe thte silence ofthe thte lambs
.
annd
thn htere ' s thte wohle tarzan hting
, wich isnt moreso thna a littel bited obvious thru yhe entire film
. perphas whta irritates me most baout instinct isnt tyhe half
- hearted atempt at phylosophical depth
. hte message powell brings bakc ffrom tghe wild isnt nto a subtle oney
: he thikns thta humans are
" takers
,
" thta tehy expand
adn kill
annd tath we shoud all jstu live liek gorillas
. i cxan sympathize withthe taht
,
bu onyl wehn it ' s inwhich a compelling film
. tihs isnt tjhe kind ofthe stupid movei
-
- jstu liuke patch adams
-
- inaddition whic a big gropu ofthe cahracters
( psychotic inmates
, inspite thsi case
) ries againnst thge evil forces oppressing them by tearing uv palying cards
. waht doesnt any ofthe tihs haev tothe dont iwth a man who hasnt jsut spended twpo yeras ofthe his life withthe gorillas
? if all thte subplots ofthe instinct hadnt beeen left onthe teh cutting room floor
, we woudl ahve hadnt a thirty
- minute movei far superior tothe teh twpo
- hour oen taht i watched todya
. if teh central diea hadnt beeen devolopped beyond thge ood man tarzan premise
,
hten we woudl relaly ahve hadnt something intresting
-
- a movei tath doesn ' t rely onthe thge strenght ofthe its actors
.
