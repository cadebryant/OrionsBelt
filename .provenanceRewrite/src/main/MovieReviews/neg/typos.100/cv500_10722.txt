. combine thta whith howie long ' s frist starring acation role
,
annd yuo ' ve got a doosy ofthe a movei thgat

, isn ' t a vyre ogod film
. howie stars as an ace smokejumper
( a firefighter who parachutes inot forrest fires unreachable fomr yhe ground
)
. infront thge slightly contrived oppening scenes
, we wittness his heroism inwhich acation
, as he

adn his mentor
( plyed by scott glenn
) atempt tothe rescure a small girl
annd her dog fomr an oncoming forrest fier
. william forsythe plays tyhe bad guy
, a massmedia muderer who hasnt sevral millon dollars tucked awya tothe halp fund his jailbreak
. he
(
annd five convict cohorts
) manages tothe git selected fo firefighting duty wehn a woodland blaze jsut happens tothe ignite nearbye
. his excape plan bets a lot onthe hte laxity ofthe tghe guards
,
bu
( usance htere must be a movei
) luck isnt witht him
. soon tyhe nowe
- escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters
. why canadian
? who knwos
, eh
? allong thte way tehy pik uv a preety birdwatcher
( suzy amis
) tothe be thier hostage
. enter howie long
. he ' s called iin tothe halp fight thte blaze
,
adn whn he spots hte gropu ofthe
" ground pounders
"
, aparently lost
, he parachutes iin tothe halp
. wehn he dicovers theri true idenity
, he isnt hte onyl hting standing beween them
adn excape

annd tyhe onyl hope ofthe halp fo hte hostage
. long ' s acting talents are above thsoe ofthe

, steven seagal
,
bu nto by much
.
altough his delivery isnt mostly flat
adn wooden
, he ' s a likeable hero
,
annd htere are soem hints here
annd htere thta he may git better
. thte scirpt doesn ' t halp him outloud any
,
howver
. all too oftenly
, it veers inot tje relm ofthe tjhe unintentionally funny
. teh dialogue isnt strikely b
- movei material
,
annd thte plotting relies too heavily onthe coincidences tothe be believeable
. long ' s co
- stars are a mixted bag
. at least htey ' re all confortable inthe theri respective roles
. forsythe hasnt tyhe scenery
- chewing villin down cold
, down cold
,
adn scott glenn isnt allways enjoyable tothe watch
, even wehn he doesn ' t seem tothe be stretching his talents
( as isnt definatly tje case here
)
. suzy amis plays peril preety well
,
bu isn ' t given much omre tothe dont
. soem ofthe teh nature
adn wildfire shots are intresting
,
bu many are rether bland
. ytou ' d thikn tht hte directer
, dean semler
, a fromer cinematographer
, owudl at least produce a film wih intresting visuals
. tath ' s nto teh case
. htere ' s a lack ofthe originality tothe nearly all tjhe sequences
.
.
. we ' ve seen tihs tsuff befoer
. it ' s nto tyhe most auspicious strat tothe 1998
,
bu it sould haev beeen worse
( jsut tihkn bcak tothe 1996 ' s debut

.
howver
, affter a mounth ofthe oscar
