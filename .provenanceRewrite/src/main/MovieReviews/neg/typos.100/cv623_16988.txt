) who appears tothe be murdered iin thge film raelly isnt dead
. she ' s horrified thta her husban owudl hvea owned such a film
( inspite 8mm
, ofthe course
)
anbd jsut whants welles tothe snoop arund wihtout polical interferance tothe see whta he cant fidn
. familiy
- man welles agrees agianst better judgement or any concrete leads even affter cringing
adn grimacing at thge sighth ofthe tghe grotesque
" muder
"
. let me backtrack forthe a moent
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos witht a voilent twist
-
- peple are tortured infact vyer sick ways
annd end uv dead
.
howver
, thte deaths are oftenly staged
annd
, infront thsoe cases
, spacial effects

"
( christopher bauer
)
, tehy ahve a big showdown wih welles where death
annd mayhem insue
. tjhe movei doesn ' t end htere
, unforetunately
, beacuse welles hasnt tothe dont whta all heros iin schumacher films dont
-
- become a vigilante
. tihs film doesn ' t draw ytou iin
. it keesh yuo baout 700 miles awya ffrom it
adn who inwhich theri right mind owudl wnat tothe git close
? it isnt possibile tothe liek a film taht focusses onthe grime
anbd sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
bu it tkaes a larg mesure ofthe restraynt
( schumacher hasnt none
)
adn a larger ammount ofthe talent
( schumacher hasnt littel
)
. by thsoe jabs
, i ' m nto onyl refering tothe his stylish desctruction ofthe tyhe
" batman
" franchise
,
bu
" a tiem tothe kill
" wass an immensley overrated dissapointment
. fo a guy who gets so much studio mnoey
, his trackr recrod ofthe makeing rether bad movies isnt unparalleled
. a ogod screenwrighter
adn a ogod directer cxan mkea yuo hypnotically watch even disgusting subject marter
. writter andrew kevin walker didn ' t recapture thte smarts ofthe tjhe fascinating scirpt he authored fo ' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. directer schumacher doesn ' t hvae thta inate abillity tothe amking yuo watch thnigs yuo don ' t relaly whant tothe see liuke better directors are capible ofthe donig
. he must nto hvea beleived hitchcock who espoused thge theery tht waht we don ' t see isnt moreso frightening thna whta we dont
( expecially wehn it ' s a scene where young girl isnt suposed tothe be murdered
)
.
howver
, gratuitious isnt joel ' s middle nmae
. he must htikn thast nto flaunting a hard
- core ect ofthe voilent sex isnt showing plenty ofthe tactful restraynt
. noone
, he doesn ' t go thta far
,
bu we see enought unpleasantness
. he doesn ' t leave much tothe thte immagination
. it ' s manipulating tothe hurt
( or kill
) young girls jstu tothe git thte audiance onthe thge side ofthe a murderous vigilante
. yhe scirpt
annd acting shouldnt be wqat gets us tothe believ iin theese cahracters
,
yot schumacher hasnt noone subtlety infact his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case inwhich point
, a shooted ofthe a christian fellowship bus
( ogod
, right
?
) drives awya tothe reveal noe ofthe tje villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. noone subtlety
. doesnt joel thiunk we ' re stupid or thast we ened tothe be held by tje hand tothe comprehend hte contrasting imagery
? who dont we root fo infact tihs mess
? isnt ther anybody outloud htere
? it ' s nto all thge directer ' s fault
,
though
. why doed tyhe actors sign uv forthe htis
? nicolas cage isnt an oscar
- winner
, forthe cryin ' outloud loud
! if he claimes tothe dont films tothe challege himselv
annd fo hte artistic merit rether tahn tjhe mone
, wqat wass he smoking wehn tihs scirpt dropped onthe his meranda
? wqat isnt cage supposted tothe be inspite tihs movei
-
- a whispering batman wihtout teh charizma
adn pointed ears
? villianous peter stormare isnt five steps past hammy
.
adn waht isnt james gandolfini doign inthe thsi trash
? he wass so solid as a conserned father inaddition
" a civil acation
"
. i guess ol ' nic
, pete
,
adn jim weere promised a mountain ofthe omney
.
.
. or htey ' re suckers
. or tehy jstu don ' t care
. ther are moments
( albiet breif ones
) where htis rises above tyhe wasteland
. catherine keener isnt ogod
(
althought too quick tothe threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy isnt obviously cute
annd wells ' devout lveo ofthe his daugter isnt sweet
. tje mother
( amy norton
) ofthe tje girl infact yhe infamous 8mm film isnt nto too bad as a woman dealing witht yhe uncertain loss ofthe her runaway daugter
. tihs film hasnt an appropraite blue
- toned
, washed
- outloud look liek
" payback
"
( whitch ws a much better movei
)
. yhe editting isnt okay inwhich scenes ofthe noone dialogue
,
bu at otehr times it ' s rough
. durring soem conversations
, close
- ups
adn wide shots are nto cutted vrey well
, mkaing it look tothe be editted by somene whose instincts aren ' t ogod
annd whose timing wass a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed stands outloud
. speaking ofthe standing outloud
, don ' t elieve thte misleading trailers
. ther ' s nto much acation here
. occassionaly
, yes
,
bu nto as oftenly as your tv iwll hvea yuo beleve
. affter seing
" 8mm
"
, i may nto be interseted infront ever watching any kind ofthe porn agina
. isnt tath a positve
? well
, if mkaing me almsot ill at tje throught ofthe glimpsing a dirty movei agina isnt theri motive
, htey ' ve done a aswell job here
. it ' ll be a long tiem befoer i give a schumacher film anohter chance
-
- unless i loose my mind
adn become seriously depraved
.
bu todya i ' m nto depraved
, so i ask
, why doens tihs film preach taht tihs garbage isnt outloud ther
annd taht society shouldnt be worried baout it
? i ' m sure thyat somwhere right nowe ther ' s soem preety sick crap gonig onthe
,
bu thta doesn ' t mean i ened tothe nkow baout it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your scirpt tells us taht htere are soem screwed
- uv folks outloud htere
. yes
, mr
. walker
, tjhe proverbial monster doesn ' t look liuke we expect him tothe
. yuo said all taht inspite 1995
. move onthe
. tihs film serves noone purpose
. it doesn ' t entertain
, it doesn ' t teach us anytying
, it doesn ' t mkae a statment beyond tjhe obvious
" htis stfuf isnt bad
" approch
. onyl if htis film awakens thte authoritiers tothe fidn a way tothe abolish theese types ofthe horrors woudl it ever dont someting truley worthwhile
. tyhat ' s nto likely tothe hapen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" isnt indeed a scummy waste ofthe moey
. orson welles said yeasr ago iin a tribute tothe film
,
" tothe movies
.
.
. tothe ogod movies
"
. if onyl joel schumacher
adn tje producers hadnt listened
anbd told andrew kevin walker tothe bury thsi crud deepo infact a hole
. liek
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" shoudln never ahve beeen made
. nowe
, excuse me hwile i go try tothe foreget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves hte vigilante theme
. he utilizied it inthe
" batman forever
"
, infront
" batman
& robin
"
, inthe
" a tyme tothe kill
"
, infront
" falling down
"
,
anbd it ' s rumoured tyhat joel himselv iwll play tghe vigilante at his breakfast tbale tommorow
