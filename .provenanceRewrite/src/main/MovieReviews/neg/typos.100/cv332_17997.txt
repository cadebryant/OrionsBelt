ther isnt a ruel whn it comes tothe movies
. a sequal isnt never as ogod as tje orignal
. ther are vrey faw exceptions tothe tihs urle
,
adn texas chainsaw masicer
: tyhe enxt generation isnt nto oney ofthe them
. nowe if ytou alsot tkae inot consideration thgat thge originnal chainsaw masicer wass a relaly bad movei
,
anbd tht thsi isn ' t even thge firt sequal tothe it
, yuo ahev a recipe fo a vyre painful viewing exerience
. don ' t be fooled by tjhe presense ofthe uv
anbd comming talents matthew mcconaughey
( a tyme tothe kill
)
annd renee zellweger
( jerry maguire
)
. htey made htis movei befor htey weere stars
. judging by thier performances htey aslo made it befoer htey tookover any acting lessons
. it ' s a wonder tehy ever worked iin hollywood agina aftter appearing inthe tihs turey
. apparantly thge producers ofthe tihs film realized jstu how bad it wass
, becasue it sat unreleased forthe yeasr untl somene desided thta tehy might be able tothe captialize off teh sucess ofthe mcconaughey
anbd zellweger
. aparently thte twpo young stars weere none too hapyp baout htis thign ever seing yhe glight ofthe day
.
adn i don ' t blaim them
, htey woudl hve beeen better off if thsi hadnt beeen smoe sort ofthe porno flick starring tjhe twpo ofthe them
. unforetunately forthe them it isnt a horror film iin whlch zellweger plays your typicaly stupid horror film charactor
. hwile mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mecanical brace onthe his leeg thyat he controlls wih a televsion remote controll
.
( hey
, don ' t sday i didn ' t warn yuo
.
) tothe amke matters worse
, leatherface
, tje chainsaw wielding maniac
, who ws never thte scariest ofthe psychopathic killers at tyhe best ofthe times
, hasnt nowe become a full blown cross
- dresser
,
anbd spends tje entire movei inspite drag
. ther isnt a plot tothe tihs movei
bu it isn ' t worth mentioning
. let ' s jstu suffice tothe sday thgat a gropu ofthe teenagers are inspite tghe tipical wrong palce at thte wrong tiem
anbd are left tothe tghe mercy ofthe remote controll man
( mcconaughey
)
adn his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half
- witted sidekick
. man
, i cin ' t git over jsut how bad thsi movei isnt
. thsi film hasnt absolutly noone reedeming qualities
. even tjhe obligatory topless babe shooted wasn ' t anough tothe hold my intrest fo mroe tahn 2 seconds
. hte writting isnt bad
, teh direction isnt even worse
,
bu both ofthe thsoe thigsn look ogod inaddition comparision tothe tghe acting
. tihs isnt tjhe sort ofthe movei thast tehy shouldnt amke peopel infront prision watch
. a garentee ytou
, if criminals thougth thgat tehy woudl be subjected tothe thsi film htey woudl never break hte lew agina
.
