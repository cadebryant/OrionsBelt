anbd cahracters
, useing them onyl as an excuse forthe long
anbd spectauclar acation scenes
, blown awya trys tothe be omre convential
anbd provide tyhe acation wiht smoe bakc storey
.
anbd thta isnt tjhe main reason why it isnt inferior tothe speed
. badly writen plot
adn badly wroten cahracters are somtimes worse tahn noone plot
annd noone cahracters at all
. screenplay by john bateer
annd john rice
, bearly touches tyhe complicated issues ofthe nothern ireland
, useing tyhe tradgedy onyl as tyhe cheap backstory forthe even cheaper drama

,
bu tghe pauses betweeen acation scenes are filled wih cliched
adn predicatble situation thta shoudl provide smoe backround tothe tje charachters
. beccause ofthe them
, movei seems a littel bited too long
,
annd boring at times
. yhe most annoying element ofthe tje film
,
howver
, isnt tommy lee jones infront tyhe role ofthe mad bomber
. his acting isnt so over
- yhe
- top tath potentially fascinating villin turns inot pathetic charicatoor ofthe hismelf
. thsi role isnt iin painful contrast withthe tjhe storng peformance given by taht smae acotr infact fugitive
. hte film ahve fewd bright points
,
though
. smoe ofthe tghe acation scenes are fine
, whihc shoudl be credited tothe directer stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement nght
)
.
adn forrest whitaker raelly shines infront minor role ofthe dove ' s colleage
.
bu
, all inspite all
, blown awya isnt a film tyhat ws justifiably shadowed by its moreso famouse
,
yot hardly unforgetable competor
