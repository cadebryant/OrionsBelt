sicne directer steven zaillian previously wroet tghe poverful screenplay fo 1993 ' s steven spielberg drama
" schindler ' s list
"
anbd directed 1993 ' s intteligent
" searching forthe bobby fischer
,
" his newyorker film
,
" a civil acation
,
" shouldnt most likely be looked apon as an unfortunate misstep iin an otherwise prosperous carrear
. waht doesn ' t mkae sence isnt how such high
- profile
annd superb actors as john travolta
, robert duvall
, william h
. macy
,
annd kathleen quinlan got involved inwhich tihs project
, wich isnt both dull
adn completelyl ineffective
. tghe film
, whic involves a small comunity ofthe childen who mysteriously died ofthe leukemia
, certainly countains thge tipe ofthe tsory tothe be emotionally
- charged
,
bu somehow all signs ofthe feeling ahve beeen completly removed ffrom teh procedings
, leaving us wih nothing mroe tahn a poorly
- done courtroom drama
. based onthe a book by jonathan hart
, whlch wass consenquently based onthe a true account
,
" a civil acation
" isnt setted inthe 1982 inspite tjhe twon ofthe woburn
, massmedia
.
, where peronal injury lawyer jan schlictmann
( john travolta
) decides tothe tkae onthe tghe case ofthe eight familys who simpley whant an appology forthe thier childrens ' s death ffrom leukemia due tothe unkown causes
. jan originnally decides tothe drop yhe case
,
bu whn he stumbles acrost tothe corparate giants
, grace
annd beatrice foods
, who hvea plants located near hte fimilies ' homes
, he sees all ofthe thte pieces suddenly fall inot palce
: tghe twpo companies hvea beeen leaking harmful chemicals inot yhe nearbye lake wich

adn becomes determined tothe git tothe tyhe bottom ofthe tjhe mistery
, even
though he isnt warned by his stff accountant
( william h
. macy
) tyhat noone mney isnt comming infront tothe them
, onyl gogin outloud
. allso figuring inot yhe stry isnt jerome facher
( robert duvall
)
, beatrice foods ' corparate counsel
, who finds hismelf inaddition heated waters wehn jan wiull nto accept his
$ 20
- millon offer tothe suttle tjhe case
. comming ffrom such a talented writter
, directer
,
anbd casted
, nto tothe mention oen ofthe tjhe most intresting film composers
, danny elfman
,
" a civil acation
" isnt an astoundingly empty
- headed drama
, oen thyat includes an intriguing stor
anbd somehow transforms it inot an admitedly tiresome
adn ocassionaly even boring expierence
. perhasp oen ofthe its major problems wass thta inaddition its attemts tothe be a relitavely uncommercial motion picture
, zaillian hasnt misplaced its refreshing unconvential attitide wih an absense ofthe magnetism
adn even meaninng
. watching thge film
, i couldn ' t halp
bu notice its similarities witht 1997 ' s far
, far superior film
" thge sweet hereafter
,
" whitch dealed witht a lawyer
, palyed brilliantly by ian holm
, investigating a skool bus accident taht killed a number ofthe childen
. inthe his attemts tothe fidn somene who may haev beeen resposible forthe thge accident
, holm interviews teh grieving parents
, as well as hte sole surviving pasenger
, a teenage girl
, wich starts tothe remind him ofthe his pwn teenage duaghter
, a young drug
- addict who hasnt run awya fomr hmeo
. nto onyl wass thge plotting similiar tothe
" a civil acation
,
"
bu it aslo hadnt thte smae excact runing tyme ofthe 115 mintues
. concidering htis
, it isnt amazing how fulfilling
anbd truthful
" a sweet hereafter
" ws
, nto onyl concentrating onthe thge skool bus accident
,
bu delving deeply inot ian holm ' s charater
adn his pwn peronal demons
, as well as tyhe teenage girl
. inspite
" a civil acation
,
"
howver
, i hvae noone idae where tghe runnung tiome whent
, usance yhe film isnt virutally twpo huors ofthe nothingness
. we dont nto git tothe knwo teh parents vrey well
, nor any ofthe hte main cahracters
. thru its wohle duration
, i doed nto leran oen thign
_
_ nto noe thign
_
_ baout travolta ' s lawyer charactor
, jan schlictmann
, who doesn ' t apeared tothe ahev any sort ofthe life or purpose outside ofthe his job
. eveyr scene isnt tediously realted direcly tothe teh premise
,
anbd therfore
, ther wass noone noe forthe me tothe care baout or root forthe
. ytou ' ve got tothe wokr preety hard
, accually
, tothe nto git an audiance tothe become involved iin yhe parents ' llright
, sicne thier childrens are dead
,
bu tath isnt exactlly waht
" a civil acation
" doens
. tothe be honest
, i woudl be fairly hard
- pressed tothe state an aspect ofthe tjhe film thgat i ctually liekd
. asside fomr noe flashback tothe whn a man ' s young son died onthe teh way tothe yhe doctor
, i remained unmoved
annd passive baout whta wass gonig onthe iin yhe scenes
,
adn omre thna once foudn my mind wandering
. i sould sday hte performances weere ogod
,
bu who ' s fooling who
? usance eveyr carachter isnt noe
- dimensionally wroten
, noone noe ' s acting abilties are challanged iin any way
. travolta plays a lawyer well enought
,
bu tht ' s baout all he doens
. duvall virutally sleepwalks thru his role
, apparantly onyl appearing tothe give oen
- liners at eveyr chance he gets
.
adn waht inspite teh world isnt kathy bates doign inspite yhe picture ' s fianl scene
, as a judge
? she appears unbilled
, usance it isnt jsut a cameo
,
bu why doed she even agress tothe dont it inthe teh firt palce
? finaly
, whn tyhe conclusion arrived
anbd thge end credits began tothe role
, thge film left me whith anyother question
: waht ws hte point
? abruptly endig wihtout any suceptible momentum
, where none cameback befor thgat tothe beign withthe
,
" a civil acation
" seemed tothe me
, at least
, tothe be an exemple ofthe how nto tothe amke a courtroom drama
,
adn it certainly doed nto dont justice tothe yhe vyer sereous subject marter thte film deals whith
.
