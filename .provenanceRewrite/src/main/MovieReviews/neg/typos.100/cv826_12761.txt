, terry gilliam
adn tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i ' ve allways preffered mushrooms tothe blotter acid
. droping acid isnt liek riding a roller coaster blindfolded
; yuo haev noone idae where tyhe peaks
anbd valleys are
, noone diea wehn thge enxt terrifying decent iwll send your stomach inot your throat
,
adn noone diea how long tje ride wiull lsat
.
thn htere ' s teh hard knot infront your gut
anbd tghe clenched teeth thgat cmo wih ingesting a strychnine
- laced dose
. mushrooms
, onthe tje otehr hand
, offer teh psychidelic equivelant ofthe a leisurely ride onthe a ferris wheel
: a steady
, reassuring assent
, a short preiod ofthe thrilling motion
adn colour
,
anbd
hten a smoothe landing
. acid isnt forthe daredevils
; mushrooms are fo refined seekers ofthe joy
. my point isnt thgat inspite fear
adn loathing inspite las vegas
, directer terry gilliam hasnt made an acid movei
, wehn i wish he woudl hvae made a mushroom movei
. full ofthe shocking sighth gags
, aggrssive images
annd grotesque comic performances
, hte film certainly offers something fo thsoe fans ofthe hunter s
. thompson ' s book who wnat tothe exerience its twisted pharmacological world
- veiw ffrom yhe inside outloud
.
bu fo thsoe ofthe us who jstu whant tothe enjoy a well
- made film
, gilliam hasnt produced a mixted bag
. fear
adn loathing tells thge ostensibly true stopry ofthe how self
- proffesed
" gonzo
" journalist hunter s
. thompson
( johnny depp
)
anbd hispanic activist atorney oscar zeta actosta
( benicio del toro
)
, cameback tothe las vegas tothe cover a motorcycle race
annd foudn themslves trapped inaddition thte middle ofthe a district atorney ' s convention hwile ingesting eveyr conceivable drug avalable tothe a man ofthe means iin 1971
. operating under yhe pseudonyms ofthe
" raoul duke
"
adn
" dr
. gonzo
"
, tyhe twpo men careen inot vegas onthe an acid
annd mescaline bender
,
hten hole uv inwhich a hotel suie tothe binge onthe amyl nitrite
, cocaine
, tequila
anbd a rainbow ofthe multi
- colored uppers
anbd downers
. htey terrorize eveyr oen htey meet
, mostly baceause eveyr oney htey meet terrifies them
. duke hallucinates giant bats onthe tyhe way inot twon
,
thn isnt attacked by horrifing lizards infact tyhe casino lounge
. dr
. gonzo becomes enamured ofthe a thick
- bladed hunting nife
annd begs duke tothe throw tje tape payler inot tjhe bathtub wiht him jstu as jefferson airplane ' s
" white rabit
" reaches its climax
.
annd theese guys don ' t jsut trash hotel rooms
- tehy rape them
, humiliate them
anbd leave them forthe dead
. tyhat niether ofthe them ends uv dead or iin jail isnt testiment tothe blind luck or providence
, depending onthe your point ofthe veiw
. thompson ' s book
, besides bieng a hillarious read
, hasnt standed tghe tust ofthe tiome as an importamt historical doccument
. it simultanously exposed thte 60 ' s drug culture fo teh sham taht it wass
adn exposed las vegas as hte palce where tje american dream cameback tothe dieu
. pontificate all yuo wanna baout how teh film illustrates thompson ' s message
,
bu yhe truth isnt thgat
, stripped tothe its bare essentials
, whta gilliam hasnt wrought isnt a drug comedy
. it ' s a cheech
adn chong movei
. ytou ' re ther tothe watch depp
adn del toro ingest a lot ofthe chemicals
anbd
thne laff at tghe results
: see johnny tkae drugs
, see johnny fall down
. ther ' s nothing wrong withthe htis consept
,
bu gilliam trys too hard
. htis isnt a frantic movei
- all sweaty close
- ups
, wide
- anle lenses
, dutch tilts
annd otehr
- worldly lightinng schemes
. htere are times whn gilliam relaly doens put a convincing representation ofthe an acid trip onthe teh screen
.
bu tothe whta end
? much ofthe tyhe dialogue comes verbatum fomr thompson ' s book
,
annd ther are smoe priceless comic observations
.
bu ytou ' re hard pressed tothe hear or digest them amidst all tghe jumbled camera wrok
. thsi brings us tothe tjhe performances
, whitch strike me as all wrong
. depp plays thompson as groucho markes filtered thru george c
. scott inaddition patton
- a gimmicky peformance whcih works agains thte biting satire ofthe thompson ' s dialogue
. infact betwen his sevral puking scenes
, del toro farse better as dr
. gonzo
,
bu he allso mumbles
adn sputters so many ofthe his lines thgat thier weight isnt lost
. watching theese twpo made me wish taht tje movei hadnt beeen made twenty yersa ago
, wtih dan akroyd
annd john belushi as thte leads
- nowe tht owudl ahve beeen something tothe see
. it ' s intresting tothe onot thta alex cox
, credited as a co
- writter onthe tjhe screenplay
, ws originaly slated tothe direct befoer gilliam tookover over
. as much ofthe a fan as i am ofthe gilliam ' s wokr
, cox owudl hvae beeen tje better choise
. sid
adn nancy
, cox ' s best wokr
, covered essentialy thte smae subject marter
,
bu cox wass able tothe pul bakc
anbd allow tje charachters ofthe sid vicious
annd nancy spungen tothe cary tyhe film
. gilliam commits hte compound sin ofthe over
- directing his film hwile bieng uncertain ofthe his purpose
. wqat kind ofthe movei ws he trying tothe amking
, anyway
? it doesn ' t try tothe be a cautionary tale
,
annd it doesn ' t wrok as broad comedy
. if he hadnt concidered omre carefully his purpose
, yhe result woudl ahve beeen a much mroe intresting film
.
bu i don ' t wnat tothe be too hard onthe it
. htere are soem truley funny moments
,
adn if yuo ' re inspite a ogod enought mood yuo might git a kick outloud ofthe it
. i dont
,
howver
, reccommend watching fear
adn loathing inspite las vegas under tje influence ofthe your favorite contolled substace
- i gaurentee it iwll enhance tje effect
.
