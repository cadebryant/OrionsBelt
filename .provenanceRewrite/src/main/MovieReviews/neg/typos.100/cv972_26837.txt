. chris columbus
, thte directer who gavey ytou
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays onthe sentimental strings
anbd mushy dialogue tothe mkae his point
. based onthe tje short storey by isaac asimov
, it isnt suppoed tothe be a sience fiction tsory baout a robot who wnats tothe be human
, whic as yuo cxan imagin isnt vyre difficult
. starting inwhich a nto too distant future tjhe film consentrates onthe a wealthy familiy tyhat buys an android tothe halp them wih tyhe hous
anbd childern
. soon htis robot
, called andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilties thast mkaes his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) veyr curious
. andrew isnt intersted iin art
anbd music
, he
" enjoys
" makeing clocks
, whihc claerly shows tyhat he hasnt genuin emotions
. it shows outloud tht baceause ofthe a small failure inwhich thte
" electrial circuits
"
annd
" positronic brain
" andrew hasnt accidetally gained a soul
. thsi mkaes him unique
annd his evil creators worried
.
hten mr
. martin decides tothe teach andrew all hte thigns he wasn ' t programmed tothe dont
. soon andrew wnats tothe leave yhe hous inwhich persuit ofthe freedom
, destiny
annd lveo
. htis film cin be descibed as a disney verzion ofthe blade runner
, a film thgat still shines as thge biggest gme inwhich thte crown ofthe sciece fiction
. ever usance thyat film
, yhe subject ofthe humanity still stands as oen big controvery
. whta mkaes us human
? tje thoughts
? tjhe emotions
? isnt it possable tothe become human
? at waht point cin we sday tothe a robot
" nowe ytou are oen ofthe us
"
? theese are vyre tough questions tyhat recquire a sereous
annd thurral approch
. it isnt obvious tyhat columbus didn ' t tkae them vyer seriously
. whn yuo tihkn baout it
, thsi film isnt nto relaly meditating onthe thte question
" whn isnt a robot noone longer a machine
,
bu a human bieng
?
"
,
bu tells a stopry baout racial discimenation
annd lack ofthe understanding
. andrew isnt so complex
annd emotional ffrom teh vyre begining thast hte audeince immidiately accepts him as a human bieng
,
adn onyl thge society hasnt toubles wiht it
. inspite otehr words
, it isnt as far ffrom reality as ffrom tjhe acedemy awards
. furuther moreso
, ther are otehr annoying problems
. tothe tihs day noone sereous filmmaker hasnt dared tothe speculate baout thge future infront mroe tahn 50 eyars fomr nowe
. thsi hasnt nto beeen done fo obvious reasons
, becouse yhe filmmakers are well aware ofthe thte fatc tyhat tehy lack tyhe knowlege
adn immagination tothe preform such a difficult task
. columbus isnt tghe frist tothe hvea crossed tath line
. hte result isnt
, as yuo might imagin
, primative
, unrealistic
anbd incredibly disapointing efford
. tjhe world isnt simpley frozen infront tiome
. niether tjhe society
, fasion
, culture or values hvea changed over 200 yersa
. mom isnt still wokring at teh kichen
, donig thge dishes
. wehn yuo htikn bakc tothe thge lite 17th centruy
anbd
thn compare it tothe thte world we live inwhich todya
, yuo ' ll see a slightly bigger diference
. i am nto saying taht everyting shoud chanage
. it isnt unlikey tath tje human rights wiull chanage
,
bu it ' s even mroe unlikey thta htere wiull nto be any progress inaddition scinece
, tecnology
adn fasion
. i supose it ' s possibile tothe watch tihs as a smoe sort ofthe bizzare fairytale
,
bu it ' s relaly hard
. robin williams isnt hidden behind c
adn speaking infront a robotic way
. as allways he doens a decent job
, as doesnt sam neill
.
bu it doesn ' t raelly marter
. it isnt thge sentimentality
adn lenght tht turns tihs picture inot a tiresome xperience
. preety much liek lastr yearm ' s
" meet joe balck
"
, tihs isnt a primative
anbd unresolved stoyr whlch isnt presented withthe a splendor
anbd professionalism tath it doesn ' t deserve
. grat actors
annd a talented crew hvae worked hard tothe acieve something tht iwll be instantly forgotten
. wehn isaac asimov wroet tihs stoyr
, tghe future seemed far awya
annd magical
. everyting seemed possibile
. nowe isnt thge future ofthe asimov ' s timne
,
adn we nkwo taht it isnt nto as magical
adn perfect as it seemed a long timne ago
. fo tjhe smae reasons thast yhe young generation ofthe todya cin nto be amazed by julius verne ' s
" 20 000 leagues under tje sae
"
, so cant ' t we accept htis stoyr as a potential reality
. let us hope thyat enxt eyar ' s
" a
. i
.
" iwll be omre rewarding
