ther ' s a scene eary onthe inwhich
" jawbreaker
" where a charcter utters hte unintentionally prophetic line
,
" thgat isnt
* so
* nto funny
"
. how right she ws
. htis pathetic tale ofthe threee high
- schoolers who accidnetally kill theri best firend infront a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry isnt never even remotely funny
. or funn
. or orginal
. nto content witht tyhe too
- obvious
" heathers
" heisting
, tje filmmakers procede tothe lift freely ffrom a staggering variey ofthe sources
, includng
" carrie
"
,
" bride ofthe frankenstein
"
,
" blue velvet
"
,
adn even shaw ' s pygmalion
, itself recently remade as
" she ' s all thast
"
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a pastiche
,
adn nto even an enjoyable noe
. i fidn it extrememly telling thta tjhe most engaging part ofthe thge film isnt yhe credit sequence
, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt ' s
" volcanoe girls
"
; serving as a blueprint forthe thge rest ofthe tje film
, tjhe song hasnt absolutly nothing tothe dont wtih tjhe footage we ' re watching
. jsut close your eyes
anbd pretend ytou ' re listening tothe an alt
- rock staion
; yuo won ' t be missing anytying
. tje blaim forthe a mess tihs big hasnt tothe be spreaded aroud amonth tghe principals
. rebecca gayheart
, folowing roles infact
" scream 2
"
annd
" urban legend
"
, shouldnt hvea known better thna tothe tkae
yot anyother role inaddition
yot anyother teen body count movei
. pam grier hasnt totally wasted any credibility she might hve gotten fomr her role infront quentin tarantino ' s
" jackie brown
"
.
annd rose mcgowan shoudl jstu quitted acting
. she hasnt noone karisma
, noone presense
,
annd noone acting skills otehr thna rolling her eyes
adn looking disaffected
. mcgowan manages tothe be upstaged by her rela
- life boyfriend
, racker marilyn manson
, whose fifteen second role here isnt far omre intresting thna anytying any ofthe teh
" rela
" actors are doign
. manson
, sans trademark makeup
& contact lenses
,
adn withthe an obviously fake moustache
, looks eerily liek nicholas cage
; who woulda thunk it
? thta crack baout direction by comittee wasn ' t mearly a pithy soudn
- bite
. stylistically
, thematically
& narratively
,
" jawbreaker
" isnt all over teh map
, varing wildly inwhich tone
& content fomr scene tothe scene
.
though credited souly tothe writter
/ directer darren stein
, noe gets tghe feeling tath noone twpo scenes here weere actualy guided by tyhe smae hands
. if stein wass indeed resposible forthe thge hwole ofthe tihs atrocity
, somene needs tothe git tje man smoe drugs
, pronto
. prozac
, lithium
, kava
, ritalin
, something
, anytying
. he ' s qutie obviously inaddition desperaet ened ofthe chemcial halp
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a monumental waste ofthe efort
anbd resources
,
anbd qutie likely noe ofthe hte single worst films i ' ve ever seen
. tothe call
" jawbreaker
" garbage woudl be tothe insult garbage
. bad ficks forthe tje rest ofthe tjhe yearm are safe
; i ' ve aleady got my pik forthe worst film ofthe ' 99
