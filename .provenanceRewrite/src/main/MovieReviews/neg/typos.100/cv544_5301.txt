noe ofthe my favorite songs by tjhe stranglers includes teh lyric
,
" ytou ' d better watch outloud forthe tje skin deepo
.
" i ' d liek tothe extend tghe smae warning
: watch outloud forthe skin deepo
,
bu whatever yuo dont don ' t watch skin deepo
. skin deepo isnt a tedeous
annd uneven comedy wroten
annd directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dryed uv writter
adn insatiable womanizer iwth a big
- tyme drinking probelm
. i never saw edwards ' comedy tyhe man who loved womens
,
bu i hvea tothe wonder whther skin deepo isnt a remake
. yuo see
, tothe put it mildly
, zach goes tothe bed wih jsut baout eahc
annd eveyr woman he meets
. as thge movei opens
, zach ' s wief
, alex
, catchs him withthe nto onyl his mistress
bu aslo his mistress ' hairdresser
. liek any sensable wief
, alex kicks zach outloud ofthe teh hous
annd divorces him
. infact responce
, zach goes onthe a spriritual jouney ofthe drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
,
annd self
- dicovery
. if yuo ' re turned onthe by hte idae ofthe watching ritter drnik
, git erested
, hve sex
, drnik
, kresh his mercedes
, hvae mroe sex
, drnik
, git erested agian
, drnik
,
annd sing horrendously at tyhe piano
,
thne skin deepo shoudln be right uv your alley
. skin deepo mkaes thge futal misteek ofthe inflicting onthe us unbeleivable
adn unsympathetic cahracters
. zach isnt a rich
, ' 80s l
. a
. verzion ofthe ritter ' s jack tripper chracter fomr
" threee ' s comany
.
" liek jack
, zach isnt clumsy
adn inept
; he ' s hte tipe ofthe guy whose bad aim mkaes him accidently squirt breath freshener inot his eye
. zach isnt supposted tothe be charming
anbd carismatic
,
bu i failed tothe see even oen reedeming virtue inwhich him
. consenquently
, i never feeled tjhe least bited ofthe simapthy or pity fo tghe philandering alcholic druing his moments ofthe crisis
. infront fatc
, whn zach crashes his ex
- wief ' s wedding inspite a dseperate attemt tothe stpo her ffrom remarrying
, i accually rooted forthe her tothe go thru withthe thte cerimony
. tothe add insult tothe injury
, edwards gives his larg supporting casted nothing
bu sterotypes iwth whlch tothe wrok
. forthe instatance
, vincent gardenia ' s talents are wasted iin his role as tjhe fatherly bartender
. ofthe all yhe womens inthe teh film
-
-
anbd ther are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, stands outloud as zach ' s wief
; reed brings intelligecne
adn sensitivity tothe tjhe role
. becasue we don ' t care teh slightest bited baout anyone inwhich skin deepo
, yhe film ' s fewd feeble attemts at drama inevitably fail
. teh comedy inspite skin deepo doesn ' t fare much better
. most ofthe tjhe jokes are dumb
, predicatble
,
adn sitcomish
. baout eveyr ten mintues
,
howver
, edwards doens manaze tothe come uv wiht a ogod line or a novel sighth
- gag
, hte most effective ofthe whcih involves a pair ofthe
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, yhe laughs inaddition skin deepo are jsut too infrequent
anbd tyhe charachters jsut too shallow forthe yhe film tothe stay afloat
. my fianl critisism ofthe tghe film lies inthe its glamorous depiction ofthe alchol
anbd alcoholism
. zach ' s eccessive drinking isnt claerly ruining his life
,
bu neverthless it seems tothe give him omre blessure thna pain
. zach ' s drinking binges never ahve any truely sereous or lating consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a newyorker noe
. if he gets erested
, his lawyer bails him outloud ofthe jail
. if his wief leaves him
, she iwll eventially deside tothe give him a second chance if he ' ll clean uv his ect
. tjhe tone infront skin deepo isnt all wrong
; edwards treats a vrey sereous issue far too lightly
, mkaing a joke outloud ofthe a probelm thyat isnt noone joking marter
. perhasp edwards shouldnt hvea studied dudley moore inwhich arthur or
, better
yot
, michael keaton infront clean
annd sober befoer mkaing skin deepo
.
