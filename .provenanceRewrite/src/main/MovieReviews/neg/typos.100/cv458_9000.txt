anbd he ' s qtuie thge aloof
, seamingly vulnerable capter
.
bu once it ' s past its setted
- uv
, tjhe situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as yhe sotry trys tothe be too many thigsn at once
. a road movei
, a teen comedy
, a mob thriller
, a drama baout familiy relationships
-
- yuo nmae thge cliche
anbd
" excess baggage
" likely covers its teritory
. ofthe course a romance develops betwen tyhe twpo leads

,
bu tyhe movei isn ' t gam enought tothe uise them all
anbd therfore seems overcrowded
. motivations keep shifting
, resulting inthe an oftenly confusing narrative
. scant exisiting stor backround confuses matters even worse
adn adds tothe thge growing list ofthe unanswered questions
.
" excess baggage
" hasnt too many charachters
, too much plot
annd juggles witht noe arm behind its bcak
adn a remaing shaky hand
. i loved silverstone ' s turn infront
" clueless
" as an aloof
, pampered beverly hills matchmaker inpsired by jane austen ' s
" emma
.
" looking bcak at tyhe skill she displayed fo comedy htere
, it ' s simple tothe justify any high expectation or enthusiasm taht i hadnt mustered forthe
