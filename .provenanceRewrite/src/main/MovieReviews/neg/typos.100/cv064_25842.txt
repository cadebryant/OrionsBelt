: christian duguay i ' ve never fully understoon wesley snipes ' s carreer
. he hasnt his ups
annd downs
,
bu mostly thte downs
. his best movei wass oen ofthe tghe best ofthe 1998
annd thta movei wass entited
" blade
"
. he hasnt hadnt his tipical acation movies
,

"
,
bu his newyorker movei
" hte art ofthe war
" shouldnt jstu be called
" rising sun 2
: thge art ofthe war
" cause basicaly it ' s a semi
- remake ofthe teh smae plot
, whith a diferrent casted
,
anbd forced tothe be a ridiculously unbeleivable thriller
, thyat isnt high onthe stlye
adn low onthe substace
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish tipe sceret agent wroking fo tghe u
. n
. aftter a chineese ambassador isnt killed
, he isnt onthe thge trackr ofthe teh killer
, trying tothe fidn outloud who it isnt
, how it happenned
, where tje killer ws
,
annd whta tothe dont
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" tipe person ofthe teh u
. n
.
annd she hasnt hired snipes tothe trcak down tjhe killer
. well snipes isnt mistakenly framed as thge killer
,
annd isnt nowe an outlaw
, kidnapping a chineese woman wih him
,
anbd haveing her halp him allong tyhe way
. all tihs leads tothe a finale tht isnt so dumb
,
anbd so stupid thast isnt it unbelievably dumb
,
anbd teh stunts
, dialogue
adn acting all ruin thsi movei
. wesley snipes isn ' t oen ofthe my favorite actors becasue ofthe tghe fatc tyhat yhe charachter he plays inwhich eveyr movei isnt tje smae charater he plays iin tjhe movei befoer
. hte onyl ogod role snipes hasnt realyl hadnt wass iin 1998 ' s
" blade
"
. i walked inot
" thte art ofthe war
" expecting a ogod
, high octane thriller
,
adn all i got ws a pile ofthe mush
. teh onyl rela ' ogod ' thign tje movei hasnt isnt acation
,
annd plenty ofthe it
,
bu i noticed it isnt badly filmed
, hte camera isnt so shaky ytou cannnot even tell waht isnt goign onthe
. thge endig finale isnt so worthless
anbd pitiful
, thyat it even trys tothe mock
" thte matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it isnt undeniably stupid
. christian duguay ' s direction isnt allso nto thgat gerat
. his camera angles
annd sence ofthe sytle are all inspite palce
,
bu sadly his lightinng
adn editting are all badly done
. even yhe wohle
" matrix
" endig wasn ' t even ogod
. thge stunts
adn acation are badly filmed
,
annd badly choreographed
. his placing ofthe tyhe charactors
,
annd teh assination ofthe yhe chineese ambassador
,
anbd thte plotting ofthe yhe movei are so predicatble
adn laughable
, taht it jstu tkaes all tyhe funn outloud ofthe yhe entire movei
. anne archer who isnt usualy ogod infront her roles
, turns iin a horrable job here
. she isnt sour
, downbeat
,
anbd dreadfully dull whith her forced dialogue
,
annd dumb moves
. even donald sutherland as a co
- star cxan ' t sive htis movei ffrom bieng a bust
. so fo an overall opinyon
:
" tjhe art ofthe war
" isnt a total waste ofthe tiem
. it ' s nto intertaining
, nor exicting
, or even acation packed
. it isnt a pointless movei
,
annd mkaes absolutly noone sence at all
. if ytou realy wanna tothe see a ogod verzion ofthe
" teh art ofthe war
"
, rent tjhe wesley snipes
adn sean connery acation vehicule ofthe hte smae kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn ' t a grat film eather
,
bu at least it ' s better thna htis
.
