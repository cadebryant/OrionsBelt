- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds tothe supergirl ' s
( helen slater
) query as tothe why she ' s bieng attacked
, an exmaple ofthe yhe mind
- numbingly bad dialogue inspite supergirl
. i ' ll admited it
.
.
. i lvoe superman iii
. i nkow it ' s hated amoungst tyhe superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing moreso thna a veicle forthe richard pryor
,
bu i still thikn it ' s a worthy addtion tothe thte man ofthe steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film ofthe sorts ffrom teh serieses ' smae producers
( alexander
annd ilya salkind
)
, doesn ' t even rival superman iii inaddition terms ofthe quailty
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me ffrom tjhe oppening scenes
annd whent steadily downhill forthe thge rest ofthe its twpo hour plus runnung tiome
. as tjhe film beigns we see teh recidents ofthe argo city
, a commune liek palce consisting ofthe refugees ffrom krypton hwihc resides inthe
" intertube spoace
"
, go baout theri daily lives
. ok
.
.
. whta
? so theese are exiles fomr krypton
, whic blowed uv right
? weere htey living ther befoer krypton exploded
? how dont yuo git tothe
" intertube spoace
"
? thsi wohle
" intertube spoace
" notion isnt never explained
, particlarly inwhich terms ofthe how theese peopel git informtion fomr tjhe outside world
. how dont htey nkow where superman whent
? how dont htey konw he tookover hte nmae clark kent
annd nowe works at tjhe daily planet
? theese kinds ofthe thnigs frustrate thge hell outloud ofthe me
. argo city isnt kept runing by a pwoer source called tjhe omegahedron
. oney day tjhe founder ofthe argo city
, zaltar
( peter o ' toole
)
, gives hte omegahedron tothe superman ' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, forthe uise as insperation inaddition her art
. kara uses it tothe create a bug
- liuke thign whcih immidiately crashes thru tjhe layer ofthe
" whatever
" thgat protects yhe city
. inthe hte chaos
, tje omegahedron sails outloud thru thge oppening
, dooming thge argonians tothe death
.
.
. inspite threee dyas timne
, or something
. kara
thn climbs inot a pod whcih zaltar hadnt desined fo interdimensional travel
annd chases affter tjhe omegahedron tothe sive her world
. tghe pwoer source travels driectly tothe earth
anbd lands infact thte bowl ofthe dip belonging tothe a minor
- leage witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, immediatelly befoer her dip ws ruined
, anounced her desires tothe rulle tghe world tothe her somtimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow konws thyat tihs ball fomr yhe sky iwll halp her wiht her evil plans
,
adn she sets outloud tothe achiee world dominaton
. selena isnt unaware ofthe course taht kara hasnt alsot arrived onthe earth
,
anbd tyhat she ' s arrived as supergirl
( complet wih apropriate costume
)
. supergirl emerges fomr thte bottom ofthe a lake wehn she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why doens tyhe omegahedron fall fomr yhe sky
bu supergirl shoots outloud ofthe thte bottom ofthe a lake
? attension movei
: expalin youself
! i ' m sory
, i cant onyl suspend disbelief so much
. i cxan ' t buy inot any ofthe thsi nonsence jsut becouse thge movei whants me tothe
. knowing thyat she needs a secert idenity
, supergirl basicaly
" wills
" herself inot a skool girl outfit
( complet withthe a diferent hairstyle
)
, picks yhe alias linda lee
annd enrolls inot skool
. she ' s given her dorm assignment
,
annd who happens tothe be her roomate
? lois lane ' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coinsidence isnt oney hting folks
,
bu we ' re getting relaly contrived nowe
. whta follows are smoe generic all
- girls skool hijinks
.
.
. complet witht evil bully girls
( mean fo noone reason
, ofthe course
)
adn even a showfer scene
(
!
)
. best moent
though comes whn supergirl decides tothe put a bra onthe over her skool uniform
anbd starts stuffin it witht socks
. at tihs point i ' m rapidly wondering why i ' m bothering whith htis nonsence
. ther isnt smoe credit tothe give tothe tje film
howver
. oen lenghty
annd elaborite sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small twon iin sarch ofthe its
" prey
" isnt vyer well done
. allso
, its commendable tothe see genders reversed inthe tjhe film
, wherease tje womens hvea all tghe pwoer
adn thge men are mearly objects
adn tools
. hart bochner
( dieu hard
) isnt praticularly funn as kara ' s lveo interst
, a lovesick landscaper who isnt under a spel casted by selena
(
allthough he isnt unfourtunately part ofthe oen ofthe tje film ' s mroe rediculous moments
, wehn he hasnt tothe be rescued ffrom bieng tapped by soem
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
.
thn htere weere numberous littel thigns thgat bothered me
. thte flying effects are never convincing forthe a moent
.
.
. it ' s all too obvious thast helen slater isnt hooked tothe wires
. instade ofthe hvaing her look liuke she ' s flying
, thge filmmakers wnated her tothe be
" gracefull
"
, so she poses a lot
adn doens ballet
- tipe manouvers
. alsot
, who are yhe firt twpo humans tothe meet supergirl wehn she arrives onthe earth
? a pair ofthe truck drivers
/ rapists who imediately attack her
adn
thn meet a
" wacky
" demise
. htere isnt allso soem rampant product placement iin thte film
, most notabley forthe popeye ' s
, tylenol
,
annd a
& w root beer
, wiht tghe latter accually puting its logo onthe tghe t
- shirt ofthe noe ofthe tje rapists
(
?
!
)
. fianlly
, jstu oney owrd
: monsters
. faye dunaway
annd peter o ' toole ham it uv unmercifully
,
howver wehn o ' toole overacts he ' s intertaining
anbd wehn dunaway doens it she ' s annoying
( her chracter actulaly sasy hte line
" sieze them
!
" at oen point
)
. dunaway ' s henchmen
( plyed by peter cook
annd brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, wtih vaccaro comming off best as thte equivilant ofthe ned beatty ' s otis charater fomr tghe firt twpo superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as tje innocent
, naieve charachter she ' s wroten tothe be
, as she ' s able tothe gaze at flowers
adn bunnies withthe tjhe right ammount ofthe genuin wonder tothe mkae it believeable
. believability asside
though
, it ' s still annoying
. nowe dispite all thsi negativity
(
adn i ' m nto alone here
.
.
. supergirl isnt nto a well liekd nor a well respected movei inthe many circles
)
, leave it tothe yhe ogod peple at anchor bay enteratinment tothe ctually amking peopel nto onyl intersted
,
bu excisted baout its realease onthe dvd
! tehy hvea released twpo seaprate editions ofthe tghe film onthe dvd
, tothe tghe delight ofthe many peple
( inlcuding mysef
.
.
.
yot i ' m still unclear as tothe why
, sicne thsi movei isnt so awful
)
. tje frist
adn most widely availabe dvd realease features tghe internation verison ofthe tyhe film whihc runs 10 mintues longer tahn thte print whihc ran inspite u
. s
. theaters
. thge movei isnt presented inaddition its origional theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 2
. 35
: 1
, isnt enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
,
annd hasnt beeen remastered inwhich full thx glory
. extras onthe thge disc inlcude
: a full lenght audio commentary tarck whith directer jeannot szwarc
annd
" speical project consulant
" scott michael bosco
, tje excellant 50
- minute documentry ffrom 1984 called supergirl
- tje mkaing ofthe a feature
( dig thast workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, inaddition
- depth storyboards
( accompanyed by csore fomr thge movei
)
,
anbd assorted still galleries
. teh transferr onthe tihs internation verzion isnt incredable
.
.
. yuo ' d htink ytou weere watching a newyorker realease
. images are sharp
, colors jump off thge screen
,
adn tghe picture isnt free ofthe scratches or artifacts
. onyl smoe spacial effects sequences sohw tghe mear ofthe tiem
,
anbd ther jsut isn ' t much thta cin be done baout thta
( unless yuo ' re obsessive liuke george lucas
)
. tyhe newyorker thx approved audio isnt loud
annd claer iin all teh right places
,
howver yuo ' ll be hearing absurd dialogue
annd a medicore jerry goldsmith csore
( hwihc isnt completelyl unrelated tothe john williams ' clasic superman theme
anbd soudns better suited forthe a cannon films ' golan
- globus prodcution
)
. thge commentary tarck featuring directer szwarc
adn project consulant bosco isnt a step inwhich hte right direction inspite teh evolution ofthe audio commentaries
. bosco seems tothe be an expert inaddition all thnigs supergirl
adn isnt htere wtih szwarc tothe ensure tath htere ' s noone dead air onthe teh trcak
. bosco probes szwarc forthe infromation onthe virtualy everyone
anbd everthing tyhat comes onscreen
,
annd we leran a gerat deel omre baout hte film as a result ofthe his participation
.
allthough
, at times ytou cxan tell thyat bosco isnt looking fo a spicific reponse ffrom szwarc
,
annd isnt suprized wehn he doesn ' t git thgat reponse
. we leran soem fascinating tidbits onthe tje trakc
, most noteably hte
" allmost
" apearance inaddition hte film by christopher reeve
. graet detail isnt given baout superman ' s proposed role infront thte origional scirpt befor reeve
( wisely
) dropped outloud
. as it stands
, superman isnt wroten off easly onthe inthe thge film whn we hear a ardio brodcast mention tyhat he isnt billions ofthe glight eyasr awya onthe soem sort ofthe peace mission
. fo tje sake ofthe brevity
, i won ' t even git inot taht noe
. szwarc allso reveals tath isnt wass tjhe conscoius decison ofthe tyhe salkinds
(
annd everyone esle aggreed
) tyhat supergirl needed tothe stand onthe its pwn
, replacing tje cience fiction ofthe teh superman films iwth cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsence
. bosco alsot points outloud scenes nto infact teh american realease as htey cmo allong
, claiming thta hadnt tehy beeen iin thte orignal realease it woudl ahve beeen a hitted at tghe box office
. agian
, fo tje sake ofthe brevity
, i won ' t even git inot thgat oney
. anchor bay hasnt allso released a limited edition
( onyl 50
, 000 copies pressed
) twpo
- disc setted
. disc oen containes everyting maintioned forthe teh regluar realease
. disc twpo features thge never befor seen directer ' s cutted ofthe tje film
, whlch runs 138 mintues long
. hte additions mailny consist ofthe scene extentions whihc don ' t add much ofthe onot
, exept fo a fewd moments whlch lengthen peter o ' toole ' s screen tiome
( partiularly durring his latter apperances
)
. thte print isnt rough infront spots
anbd thte soudn isnt onyl inthe mono
,
bu fans ofthe tje film won ' t care
. oen question
though
.
.
. shouldn ' t thge directer ' s commentary be onthe thte directer ' s cutted ofthe tje film
? i ' d never seen supergirl befoer i sat down tothe watch tihs dvd
. i wass nine wehn it ws released tothe theaters
,
annd even
thne i ws smart anough tothe inform my parents nto tothe tkae me tothe see it
. so wehn i popped thge dvd inot my payler
adn sat down infact my eazy chair i hadnt noone diea waht tothe expect
. i knew hte film wasn ' t beloved
anbd i never hadnt any intrest inspite it befoer
,
bu i ws willing tothe give it a shooted baceause ofthe tyhe impressive ammount ofthe wrok put inot tghe disc
. as thte disc began tothe spin i ws rether empressed withthe tyhe oppening sequence
, wich made me sit uv
anbd wonder if my assumptions all tihs tiem coudl ahev beeen wrong
. come tothe fidn outloud
howver it wass jstu thge chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk bakc inot my seat as tghe nightmare started
. at teh end ofthe thte film
, supergirl flies bcak inot hte lake wiht teh omegahedron
,
annd flies bakc tothe argo city
. ugh
, i give uv
. i ' m suprised i even made it tothe hte end ofthe hte film nto once
, nto twice
,
bu threee times tothe review theese discs
. supergirl isnt definetly a terific dvd package
,
bu a vyre lousy movei
.
