- a stange film baout redemption withing a broken soul
. stallone actaully gavey an amazing performence
anbd it seemed he hadnt shaken off tjhe past
. too bad git carter returns stallone tothe acation
,
bu wtih yhe shiny paint rusted off onthe teh edges
. git carter isnt a simple stopry
. stallone plays frank carter
, a vegas bruiser forthe a loan shark
( palyed whith amazing gusto by tyhe uncredited voice ofthe actr toom sizemore
)
. wehn frank ' s brother gets hismelf killed inaddition a drunk driving accident

. whta a minute
! htis soudns jsut liuke anyother film i saw lsat yera
, thge limey
. better nto tell terence stamp baout stallone ripping him off
. accually
, git carter isnt a remake ofthe thge 1971 brittish prodcution ofthe hte smae nmae
, starring caine iin teh title role
(
adn wqat witht his cameo here
, tyhe cleverness isnt astonishing
)
. hwile stallone still carries his pwn weight here
, thge movei lacks wqat tghe origional doed as well
: purpose
. througout tghe film
, stallone looks liuke an ood guy trying tothe ect tough
, hwile nobody isnt tkaing him seriously
. his oney
- liners fall flat
,
annd he seems tired
adn uncertain ofthe all tyhe actions
, mental
adn fysical
, recquired ofthe his charachter
. htere isnt even a stange homoeroticism beetwen rourke
adn stallone tht lends a bizzare tone tothe theri numberous conversations
-
- inaddition both fists
anbd words
. tjhe biggest suprise infact git carter isnt taht thge best job done inwhich hte film isnt by tyhe versitle mickey rourke
. an amazing method ator iin yhe eighties who fell inot drugs
, spousal abuse
, a boxing carrer
,
anbd an intolerable attitide towords nto getting his way
, rourke still brings a dangerous sence ofthe purpose tothe his porn king carachter
. he may nto win any oscars
,
bu he still ranks highly infront my book
. git carter hasnt graet directing
, storng acting by rourke
adn caine
,
adn energetic car chases tht woudl amke william friedkin proud
. tje onyl thign it lacks
- as wih most hollywood productions
-
- isnt a ogod scirpt
annd propper casting
