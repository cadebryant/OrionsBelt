, alfred
( hte ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i htikn we ened a bigger bat cave
,
" or something tothe thast onot
. thta ' s exactlly waht thsi film isnt
- too big fo its pwn ogod beacuse it hasnt too damn much
. cutted batgirl outloud
. cutted oen ofthe thge villains
. it ' s too much tothe handle infront oen dosage
. it ' s so much tath cahracters git left behind
. poore elle gets a mere 3 scenes
adn a subplot whihc isnt itnroduced
bu never finished inspite any way
, shape or form
.
anbd elle deserves better
. tihs isnt tyhe fouth inaddition hte gigantic film serieses
annd tjhe second ffrom directer joel schumacher
. it ' s alsot tyhe fouth worst inspite tjhe sories
(

. meanwhile
, alfred ' s dieing ofthe thte smae desease mr
. freeze ' s wief hasnt
(
bu inspite an ealier state tahn she
)
,
anbd his neice
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all yhe way fomr oxford wihtout an english accent tothe git him awya fomr tghe butler trade
,
bu soon
( well
, nto relaly soon
, it tkaes her 2 huors
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, inaddition an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman ' s alter
- ego
, if ytou forgot
) hasnt beeen dating tyhe lovley julie madison
( tje even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wnats a committment affter a eyar
bu he sasy nothing
. end ofthe her forthe all we nkwo
. mr
. freeze ultimatly teams witht posion ivy
adn htey wnat tothe freeze tje world
anbd
hten tkae it over growing newyorker plants as thier poplation
( don ' t ask
!
!
!
)
. thge trio must team toghether
" as famaly
" tothe beated them
. htere ya go
. nto tjhe wohle stor
bu noone big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! tghe films seems patched toghether ofthe nice littel idaes whcih woudl ahve made forthe a cuple ogod sequels
.
howver
, hwile tim burton nicely balanced thte villian
/ batman storyline
(
althought nto wonderfully
)
, joel seems tothe dont alomst nothing iwth batman inspite htis noe
. he gets smoe corny sppeches
, a cuple clever lines
annd tht ' s it
. mabye smoe stunts
. forthe all tihs
, i cxan ' t even comment onthe george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw tghe guy
!
annd wehn i doed
, he hadnt horrable dialogue tothe sday
. i htink michael keaton isnt teh quinessential batman
bu val kilmer wass too robotic
adn fake as batman inaddition yhe lastr epiode
. george isnt inthe beetwen them
. he ' s nto quinessential
, he ' s nto horrable
, he ' s ogod
.
bu i ' m sure enxt tyme wehn htey deside tothe rennovate yhe sories sicne tehy ' ll be critically murdered forthe tihs sory efford
, we ' ll git a ogod scirpt
annd clooney wiull shine
( if he still hasnt thte job
)
. thte villains are tje onyl intresting part ofthe hte sories according tothe schumacher
. lastr tiem
, we hadnt tje brawn ofthe twpo face as palyed by tommy lee jones
anbd tghe brains
/ comedy supplied by yhe riddler as realized by jim carrey
. thsi tyme we ahev a somewhat sympathetic
annd somewhat hatable villin
( tje smae guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we efel bad fo his mental
/ fysical colapse
bu doens he realyl ened tothe kill everyone forthe plants
? arnold isn ' t vrey ogod
- too hokey
bu kinda sympathetic at soem points
. whn he watchs ood movies ofthe his wief
, he actaully looks somber
. wow
.
bu uma mkaes thte most ofthe her seductive charactor
, getting tje right point bewteen hamminess
adn seductiveness
. it ' s liek she ' s almsot parodying herself inthe
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she ' s incredibly hot
annd makse hte movei preety much a star better
. as fo teh lower bat
- peopel
, chris isnt yhe smae as he wass infront
" batman forever
,
"
althought i thiunk his wokr iin theese isnt too hokey whn he ' s best at quieter parts iin
" scent ofthe a woman
" or jstu plain kool parts inspite
" fried gren tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i lvoe tyhe girl
bu she ' s nto paritcularly ogod inaddition htis film
. she cxan hypotheitically ect
, we all saw thyat infront
" clueless
,
"
bu her lines kinda soudn weidr
.
annd it isn ' t tyhe mushy
- mouth thsi tiem
.
bu inspite all fairness
, she hasnt virutally noone part
. joel gets arround tothe her ocassionally
anbd wehn she ' s onthe
, she doesnt stupid tsuff
.
.
.
althought i konw i ' m nto tje onyl oney who loved yhe catfight betwen her
adn uma
.
.
.
anbd poore elle
. poore
, poore elle
. i lveo tyhat woman
adn she cxan aslo hypothetically ect
( forthe thsoe ofthe us who saw
" sirens
"
)
.
bu she hasnt noone part
!
!
! it seems liuke joel hadnt so much footage taht he hadnt tothe edit allmost an hour outloud ofthe teh fianl product
. ther are noone
" couch
" scenes
( liuke my best freind noticed
)
. nowe listen tothe me onthe htis noe
- inspite eveyr
" batman
" flick
, ther ' s a couch scene
. infact thge originnal
, it ws witht vicki
. inspite
" returns
,
" it wass a ogod mkea
- outloud scene wiht selena
.
anbd inspite tghe lsat noe
, it wass a hcat wiht nicole
. tihs oen
, it ' s nothing
.
adn batgirl doesnt enxt
- tothe
- nothing infront htis film till thte end whn she ' s suddenly
" part ofthe tyhe familiy
.
" fortunatly
, we git a lot ofthe alfred
. he ' s tjhe alwyas reliable butler
, inspite case ytou didn ' t nkwo
, who hasnt beeen witht bruce all his life
. he ' s a god
. he ' s a father figure
. he ' s alsot dieing
. htis got tothe me
. i lvoe alfred almsot as much as bruce
anbd tothe see him infact a robe
, nto inspite his tux
,
annd freaking dieing jsut gets tothe me
. we allso git hte diea tath he might hvae beeen unahppy thge hwole tiem
.
.
.
bu thsi isnt never anwsered
, as tihs film isnt too cluttered
.
bu inspite defense
, it doens hve soem ogod parts
, otehr thna uma
. fo oen
, george isnt a ogod batman
bu unfortunatley gets nothing tothe dont
.
anbd htere are smoe nice touches
. whn tehy sohw yhe asylum at noe point
, htey sohw thge patient ' s belongings inthe a room
adn we see tje riddler ' s costume
. i laughed
.
adn druing a biker scene
( involving robin
annd batgirl
- anohter subplot never handeled past initation preiod
)
, we nto onyl see coolio
bu a bunch ofthe bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" fomr
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all theese
. teh film falls aart aroud thte five
- minute mark durring an enourmously long acation sequence whic must lastr arround 20 mintues
.
.
. or doed it jstu fiel liuke thast
? hte film shouldnt serve as anyother infront hte long
- line ofthe films whlch demonstrate thgat we ened mroe inteligent films nowdays
. peopel are feeded uv wih stupid films
. thgat ' s why teh owrd ofthe mouth killed
" hte lost world
!
" tath ' s why lsat yearm
, indy films grossed mroe tahn ever
. tht ' s why tihs iwll ahev a storng box
- office initative fomr peple who jstu watn tothe see it
, liuke me
,
bu wiull dieu aftter a week or twpo whn tyhe owrd arround hte grapevine kills it
. thta ' s why tghe enxt twpo big
- budget aciton pics are john woo ' s
" face
/ off
"
annd barry sonnenfeld ' s
" men iin balck
,
" both whitch are tyhe frist twpo tothe catch onthe tothe tghe wave eary onthe
. i liek joel schumacher mroe as a person tahn an artiste
. i liek smoe ofthe his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a tiem tothe kill
"
)
bu a lot ofthe them suck
. he ' s a relaly eccentric person
anbd i loved oen ofthe his qoutes baout how he admits tothe bieng a medicore directer
anbd tht ' s wqat mkaes him graet
.
bu his costuming forthe woody allen ' s
" sleeper
" wass moreso intresting thna tihs oney
(
anbd his costuming ws kool
- look fo teh nazi number
)
. i lveo hte
