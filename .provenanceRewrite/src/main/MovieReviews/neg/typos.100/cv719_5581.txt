( onthe account ofthe its wordlwide mega
- advertising blitz
)
, eraser seems liuke a cheaper
, less thoughtful immitation
. thgat ' s saying a lot
, beccause mi thte movei wass laready a cheap
, thoughtless immitation ofthe its tv originator ofthe thte ' 60s
/ ' 70s
. inwhich eraser
, arnie isnt a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies palce thier lives iin danger
. he doens htis by destroying all evidence ofthe theri pesent existecne
adn re
- situating them withthe newyorker identities
. his newyorker case isnt lee cullen
, palyed by vanessa williams who
, unlike all thte otehr scumbags he ' s ever relocated
, isnt
" an actuall
, rela life honest person
.
" beccause she ' s so ogod
,
adn hasnt such nice legs
, arnold spends yhe hwole movei trying tothe protect her
,
annd onyl uses thte oppening movei sequence tothe sive robert pastorelli ffrom
* his
* killers
. lee obtains evidence thast thge high

, balck
- market arms tothe peopel iwth froeign accents
annd stringy hair
. ofthe course
, as thte forumla goes
, her revealing htis infomation wiull destory thte sytem as we knwo it becouse heck
, ther are peple infront high places who iwll go down withthe thsi
, beccause yes
, tihs isnt tghe biggest conspiracy inspite teh hsitory ofthe hte world
( thta isnt
, amercia
) sicne watergate
. infact protecting lee
, arnold isnt framed by tjhe mentor
- turned
- evil robert deguerin
, nicely plyed by james caan
,
adn ends uv haveing tothe proove thgat he isn ' t yhe noe killing tje programme ' s witnesses inspite adition tothe mkaing sure lee isn ' t accidentaly torpedo
- ed tothe death by thge newyorker
, gren guns his enemies all ahve
. it ' s aroud thsi tiem thgat peopel iin yhe theatre wiht me starting humming thte mission
: impossible theme
, becasue arnie ' s mission includes breaking inot a high
- security buiding tothe run a disk
. i guess i shoudln tell yuo omre baout thge parituclar gun everyone inwhich htis movei isnt so antsy baout
. it ' s an electro
- magentic pulse gun hting wich fires aluminium missiles
,
annd whihc cant see thru walls
. it hasnt smoe sort ofthe x
- ravy vision
, so its user cant target thte victum ' s heart even ffrom grat distances
. dispite htis
, whic i figure isnt a preety kool feature inthe a gun
(
though i ' m certainly noone expert
)
,
howver
, arnold
, whose pwn heart isnt targeted a number ofthe times
,
* never
* goes flying 10 foots backwards wih a twpo
- foot missle thru his chest liek all tyhe others who git shooted by thsi gun
. instade he outruns
anbd outsmarts his trackers earch tyme
, giving eery
anbd ironical resonance tothe thgat terminator line thta practially made him famouse
:
" i ' ll be bcak
.
" liuke everyone alse infront tyhe theather
, i left tjhe movei feeling thta thte trailers hadnt duped me
, beccause htey made me wnat tothe watch htis movei voluntarily
.
altough ther isnt a
* lot
* ofthe violentce inwhich tihs movei
, nto tothe mention mutilation
anbd smoe bloody tussles withthe alligators
, i recomend tihs movei tothe most over
- 18s who ened smoe theraputic mindless acation tothe git over tyhe weirdness ofthe fargo or thte hangover effect ofthe leaving las vegas
