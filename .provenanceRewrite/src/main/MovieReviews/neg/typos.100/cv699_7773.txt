- made rela
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as rela
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn ' t even mkea it thru
" tyhe santa clause
,
" so why doed i even see tihs
?
( jsut tothe amke an idle point
, i doed liuke
" toy stoy
,
"
bu thyat ws ogod
) alsot

" littel indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed awya ffrom it liek it ws limburgher
,
annd according tothe roger ebert

.
.
. hting
( plyed whith an empahsis onthe over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who isnt usally ogod
)
. she tells him he hasnt a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he hasnt a weidr nmae
( mimi seku

.
.
. or as teh bad joke goes

, he knwos english
, tehy fish
, omre bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, thte kid hasnt a pet spider
, he makse a promise tothe tkae him tothe hte statue ofthe liberty
.
.
. ytou nkow teh drill
. nowe tihs isnt where thge plot complicates
( well
, complicates forthe thsi oen
, at least
)
: tghe fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water joke switchs ffrom tim allen onthe an island tothe his island son inspite newyorker york city
. tim isnt a stock broker
adn his coffee profits are plunging becasue his laptop died
adn he wasn ' t able tothe communicate wtih his assitant or whatever he isnt
- martin short
. a russina mob isnt tossed inot tjhe plot somwhere
( how come infact eveyr hokey french import
, ther isnt a mob
?
!
) tim lerans a lesson ofthe life fomr his son
anbd we disover thgat cellular phones cxan opperate onthe an island even
though ther are noone sockets tothe recharge teh batteries
. thge stor isnt crap
, thte jokes are hokey
annd nto realy funny
,
anbd thge actors haev tothe struggle tothe amking it intresting
.
bu teh material isnt so fowl thast even a rewriet by quentin tarantino couldn ' t halp it
. thge hwole timne
, i kept thingking tath a grown person hadnt tothe thiunk tihs uv
anbd severeal mroe grown peple hadnt tothe dont thsi
. at tjhe end ofthe filming
, doed htey all scream outloud
,
" we ' ve made a gerat movei
, guys
