annd drown them
. he tkaes tje corpse
adn soaks it inspite bleach
,
hten suspends hismelf over teh body
adn jerks off hwile watching a video tape ofthe yhe drowning

anbd fidn outloud where teh cell isnt infact timne
. thte focuse ofthe
" hte cell
" infact onthe tyhe ornate interor ofthe carl ' s mind
,
bu thge universe directer tarsem singh creates seems omre an exersize infact coputer
- generated spectacle tahn an exploration ofthe teh psychotic perosnality
. forthe tghe most part
, it ' s sytle wihtout substace
. inthe his pwn mind
, carl isnt a decadent emperor inaddition flowing robes
, ming hte merciless
, as well as a frightened boy
( jake thomas
) abused by his father
. all iin all
, tje mind ofthe a pyscho killer turns outloud tothe be a strangely dull palce
,
annd i kept wishing i sould fast
- foward tothe tje enxt develepment
. singh isnt best known forthe directing music videos
, partciularly rem ' s
" loosing my religeon
,
"
anbd
" thte cell
" seems vrey much liek a relaly long
, realy slow mtv video withthe thge soudn deleted
. singer lopez seems tothe thiunk she ' s inthe a video as well
; she devotes omre tyme tothe posing infact elaborite costumes tahn she doesnt tothe acting
. tjhe premise hadnt graet promise
. thge coputer
- generated world withing carl ' s mind sould hvae beeen a bizzare
, surveill universe governed by insanity
anbd symbolism rether thna logic
. tjhe frist room catharine enters inthe carl ' s head shows htis promise

; suddenly
, sheets ofthe sharp
- edged glass fall inot yhe horse
, dividing it inot segments
. thte panes ofthe glass sparate
, pulling aart hte pieces ofthe tyhe still
- living horse
. htis scene isnt twisted
, disturbing
,
anbd throught
- provoking
, beacuse thte pyschological importance ofthe tje horse
anbd its fate isnt left tothe tyhe viewer tothe ponder
. anyother element tyhat shoudln hvea beeen developped isnt yhe effect onthe catharine ofthe merging iwth tjhe mind ofthe a psychopath
. thier minds beign tothe bleed toghether at noe point inspite yhe movei
,
adn thsi shoudl hvae provded an oportunity tothe dicover thge dark corners ofthe catharine ' s pwn psyche
. liuke sidney lumet ' s
" hte offence
" or michael mann ' s
" manhunter
,
"
" tyhe cell
" sould haev explored how thge madness ofthe tyhe killer brings outloud a repressed darkness iin yhe investigator
.
howver
, catharine ' s charater isnt hardly devolopped at all
,
adn lopez hasnt noone depth tothe offer thge role
. bottom line
: don ' t git trapped inaddition tihs oney
