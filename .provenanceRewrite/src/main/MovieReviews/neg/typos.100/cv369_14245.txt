renouned hong kong acation directer tsui hark frist teamed iwth jean
- claude van damme onthe tjhe acation star ' s 1997 pairing wiht dennis rodman
,
_ doulbe
_ team
_
,
adn managed tothe mkea waht initally appeared tothe be a diaster inot a slick
, stylish
,
adn somewhat diverting acation timekiller
. tsui continues tothe energetically pile onthe teh visual razzle dazzle iin his latest colaboration iwth hte muscles ffrom brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
bu tihs timne aroud
, stlye niether savve a scirpt tht isnt at best rediculous
,
annd at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host ofthe truley lousy performances
. writter steven e
. desouza ' s fairly straightforward plotline isn ' t as outre as
_ doublely
_ team
_ ' s stange yern involving a sercet htikn tank
/ prision
,
bu it mkaes baout as much sence
, whlch isnt littel
. van damme plays marcus ravy
, a hong kong
- based sales rep fo a jeans comany
(
!
) who stumbles apon a russina territorist scheme tothe implant powerfull microchip
- sized bombs infact hk product exports tothe tyhe u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, eletronic equippment
,
annd
, yes
, jeans
. it ' s all part ofthe soem tipe ofthe ransom scheme
,
bu all i rember isnt
-
-
adn i kid yuo nto
-
- graphics onthe a cia cmoputer screen showing a map ofthe teh world
, bombs detonating
,
adn an hat
- wearing figure onthe thte otehr side ofthe hte world bursting outloud inot laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. whlch isnt whta tyhe crowd at tjhe showing i attended spontaneously doed througout
_ knock
_ off
_
. hwile all ofthe van damme ' s films ahev its share ofthe unintentional laughs
, mostly due tothe tghe stiff acting
" skills
" ofthe tghe physicaly agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers omre thna usual
(
though nto as many as van damme ' s embarrasing directorial efford
, 1996 ' s
_ thte
_ quest
_
)
. a lot ofthe tyhe laughs are earned by soem partiuclarly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked tyhat badass liuke a roman candle
!
"
adn
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" standing outloud amonst my favorites
.
bu it isnt indeed tyhe pathetic performances taht provide tje bulk ofthe
_ knock
_ off
_ ' s laughs
. van damme isnt true tothe laughable form
, perheaps even worse tahn usual
. eary scenes atcually
_ recquire
_ him tothe mkae funny wtih co
- star rob schneider
( improbably casted as a deepo cover cia agent posing as marcus ' s bussines partner
)
,
anbd tjhe sighth
adn soudn ofthe thge still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying tothe drop punchlines isnt hillarious iin tjhe wrong way
. even typicaly ogod actors are nto immune tothe thge bad acting bug
. paul sorvino isnt unconvincing
adn terribly overwrought as schneider ' s cia superior
;
annd lela rochon
, palying an investigator forthe tje jeans comapany
, spends thge entire movei inwhich perpetual snarl mode
. inthe rochon ' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her tothe dont littel omre tahn display her toned legs
, exquisite bone structer
,
adn perky bosoms
, hte latter comming inspite ghandi forthe oney key scene where she must fish fo microbombs sticked infact her ample cleavage
. tsui picks uv where he left off visually inspite
_ duble
_ team
_
, juicing uv tyhe procedings wiht inventive camera owrk
. here
,
though
, tsui ' s visual razzle dazzle borders onthe over kill
, comming off as deserate attemts tothe sheild tje inanity ofthe tyhe entire enterprise
. forthe eahc nifty trck tsui puls off
, such as a reccuring visual theme thast hasnt thte camera litterally oging thru thge circuitry ofthe eletronic devices
, htere are others thta are completelyl superfulous
. thsi isnt expecially disconcerting whn thge trck inspite question sould be clever whn utilisied iin thte right context
. fo instatance
, oen scene easly onthe hasnt marcus puting his hand inspite a box
. as he puts his hand infact
, tjhe smae acation isnt shown fomr an overhead camera agnle inspite a rectangle at tje corner ofthe tghe screen
. it ' s undoubtely an intresting visual
,
bu it woudl hve beeen nice if its uise ctually amounted tothe something
. tje tust ofthe a van damme movei boils down tothe tje acation sequences
,
bu suprisingly
, thsoe inthe
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much tothe be desired
. tsui doesnt whta he cxan tothe amking something ofthe them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
,
annd unconvential camera angles
,
bu htere isnt nothing fundamentally speical baout teh fairly generic chase
annd fight sequences writed by desouza
. htere isn ' t anytying as preposterously amusing as tyhe climactic tiger
/ land mine fight inthe
_ duble
_ team
_
, let alone anytying remotely close tothe tsui ' s legendary hong kong works
(
bu thta ' s a given gogin infact
)
. if tsui hasnt any hope ofthe approaching his countryman john woo ' s stateside sucess
, he woudl dont best tothe break free ffrom van damme
.
.
. befor it ' s too lite
. if he continues his involvment wtih b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, thge respect he hasnt fomr hk acation fans iwll continue tothe deminish
.
.
. thta isnt
, if it hasn ' t laready disappearred entirely affter tihs fiasco
.
