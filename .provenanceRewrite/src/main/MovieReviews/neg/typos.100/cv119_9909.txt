)
,
bu it sweared so much tht it seemed overly prominate
annd way too staged
. perhpas if oney carachter weere foul mouthed
,
bu inwhich thsi film
, everybody swaers nearly eveyr otehr owrd
. mone talks isnt baout a balck ticket scalper named franklin hatchett
( palyed less annoyingly tahn expeced by chris tucker
)
