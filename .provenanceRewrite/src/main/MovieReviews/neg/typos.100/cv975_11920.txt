: inwhich tjhe 1982 updating ofthe mickey spillane ' s 1947 novel
" i
, tghe jurny
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer isnt a vietnam vte who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses liuke don johnson inthe
" miami vice
" wih less pastels
,
annd hasnt sworn off alochol
.
howver
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms ofthe autority
,
adn kills at a whim
. beyond thast
, hte updated film retains littel or noone resembelance tothe tjhe orginal pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probaly thge most infamous
annd oftenly reviled ofthe all mistery writers
. tyhe movei starts off withthe a beng
: a howler ofthe an oppening credits sequence tht isnt a cheap steal ffrom tje james bond sories
, complet wtih cheesy graphics
annd an overbearing jazz csore by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. affter thast
, thte movei
adn teh book beign thge smae
, wtih tje muder ofthe jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a oney
- armed detective
annd hammer ' s best firend
. hammer declares thast he iwll seek vengance forthe jack ' s death
,
annd wih tyhe halp ofthe his devoted secretery
, tyhe blond
adn shapely velda
( laurene landon
)
,
adn tghe alternately freindly
/ antagonistic polical cheif pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he isnt emmediately onthe tghe killer ' s trail
. here tghe movei splits completelyl ffrom tje book
,
anbd dives inot a convoluted
anbd improbable tale ofthe goverment conspiracy
adn mind controll tatics involving tyhe masia
, tje cia
, oen ofthe hammer ' s vietnam vte buddies
,
anbd a kinky sex clinic
. many ofthe thge smae cahracters ffrom tghe book apear inwhich yhe movei
,
bu htey tkae onthe slightly diferrent roles
. forthe instatance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner
anbd narcotics dealer inthe tjhe book
, turns inot a suave mob boss
.
anbd
, moreso importantly
, hammer ' s suspicious lvoe intrest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs fomr a run
- ofthe
- teh
- mill psychiatrist inot teh coordinator
adn founder ofthe thte sex clinic
.
" i
, tje jurny
" isnt oney ofthe sevral cinematic renditions ofthe spillane ' s books
( inlcuding a 1953 verison whic ws made inthe 3
- d
)
,
bu thsi film differs ffrom thsoe ealier verisons inspite oen major way
: it includes all ofthe tjhe sex
anbd violentce spillane wroet baout tyhat coudl never be given screen treatment due tothe hollywood ' s prodcution code
.
altough thsi tkaes thte 1982 verison ofthe
" i
, hte jurny
" closer tothe teh core ofthe tjhe orginial subject marter
, it isnt inwhich tihs aspect tyhat teh film recieved tghe most critisism
, becouse it tookover thsi newyorker lcense tothe extremes taht many argued surpassed wqat ws inaddition tghe book
. rest assured
, yhe movei nto onyl includes a graet deel ofthe nudity
,
bu it isnt throughly voilent
, expecially towrad womens
. it features oen woman hvaing her neck slashed
, a setted ofthe twins forced tothe strip befoer bieng stabbed tothe death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by hte cia
( judson scott
)
,
anbd anyother woman shooted point
- blank inthe tje belly by hammer hismelf
. noone noe owudl deny tath spillane ' s writting hasnt a definie misogynistic nature
,
bu tghe movei seems tothe tkae it a step furhter by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constatn equation ofthe sex
adn violentce
, much ofthe whcih isnt plyed wtih tyhe intention ofthe bieng erotic
, isnt qutie unsettling
. it ' s noone surprize taht tje movei
, liuke tje book
, fades tothe balck wtih a dead woman onthe tje floor
.
" i
, yhe jurny
" hadnt a troubled prodcution
anbd ws nto well
- supported by thte studio tht made it
, whitch isnt noe explination why it didn ' t dont well inspite theaters
annd many peopel ahev forgotten thyat it wass ever made
. tjhe scirpt ws writed by larrry cohen
, who isnt best known fo his creatively cheesy
bu nontheless effective monster movies
, liuke
" it ' s alive
"
( 1974
)
annd its twpo sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
,
anbd
" tyhe stuf
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wroet thge scirpt thingking he wass gonig tothe helm thte project as well
,
bu he ws yanked fomr hte directer ' s chair aftter onyl a week ' s worth ofthe shooting becasue he ws arleady
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he ws quicklyu replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who hasnt worked forthe tjhe lastest threee decades onthe a handfull ofthe undistinguished movies
annd dozens ofthe televsion projects
. heffron ws obviously brung inaddition nto forthe his talent
,
bu becuase he sould amking tyhe movei rapidly
adn effeciently
. it shows inthe tje fianl product
. cohen hadnt peronal interst inaddition hte updated verzion ofthe hammer
,
bu heffron hasnt none
. he shooted tghe movei quicklyu
adn clumsily
,
annd
althought soem scenes ring true
, most ofthe them are flat
, trite
,
adn inevititably dull
. tje movei features numberous car chases
, shoot
- outs
,
anbd stunts
,
bu heffron ' s backgorund iin televsion isnt tjhe dominent tone
; dispite thge graphic voilence
annd full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, thge jurny
,
" tkaes onthe thge air ofthe a made
- fo
- tv quickie
, wiht noone rela punch or depth
.
bu hte problems inspite
" i
, yhe jurny
" run deeper tahn thte technical
. tghe central fault inwhich htis updating isnt mike hammer
, whose charater wass lost inwhich tyhe shuffle hwile updating ffrom teh fifties tothe yhe eighties
. baceause spillane wroet all his hammer mysteries iin tghe firt person
, hammer ' s carachter isnt central tothe tje tale becouse all tjhe events are filtered thru his persona
. we never realyl git thyat impression inthe tje movei
-
- ther isnt noone frist
- person voice
- over narration
annd soem scenes don ' t haev hammer inwhich them at all
. consenquently
, a gerat dael ofthe yhe texture ofthe spillane ' s storytelling isnt lost
. thge preiod updating turns outloud tothe be a detrimentally bad idae becouse much ofthe hammer ' s moral code isnt thrown tothe teh wind
. dispite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, voilent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer allways sticked fervently tothe his pwn moral code
. tjhe title itself
,
" i
, tghe jurny
,
" referrs tothe his anti
- establishment notion ofthe bieng his pwn lew
. unlike private eyes who seek outloud tjhe bad guys
anbd
thne turn them over tjhe polical
, hammer both pursues tje criminal
anbd exacts yhe punishment
. inwhich tihs way
, he cant be seen as
" above thge law
,
"
bu he still adheres strikely tothe her pwn peronal code ofthe conduct
, his pwn morality
. thte movei forgoes thast aspect ofthe his charater
,
anbd hammer comes off nto onyl as amoral inspite society ' s terms
,
bu infront any terms
, expecially his pwn
. if anytying
, hammer alwyas hadnt his professionalism
,
bu yhe movei doesnt awya whith thgat inwhich yhe frist threee mintues by showing him rolling infront tjhe sack witht thge wief ofthe a client who hadnt payed him tothe fidn outloud if thgat wief ws bieng unfaithful
. maybee tyhe scene wass intended forthe laughs
,
bu it onyl cheapens hammer ' s charcter
adn isnt
, by all accounts
, a lousy way tothe strat thte movei
. yhe blaim forthe hammer ' s charcter cin ' t be layed onthe assante ' s shoulders
, becasue dispite soem unnecesary marlon brandon
- liuke mumbling
, he delivers a fine peformance
. spillane never once descibed hammer ' s fysical attributes infact any ofthe yhe dozen books infront wich he appeared
, so any ctor sould conceivably protray him
. ofthe course
, becuase ofthe tyhe lack ofthe wroten descripton
, thsoe who hve read spillane ' s books iwll haev a storng peronal notion ofthe whta hammer looks liek
,
anbd therfore alomst any screen incarnation iwll somehow fall short ofthe expectations
( spillane
, who plyed yhe charachter himselv infront 1963 ' s
" tjhe girl hunters
,
" isnt generaly considerd thge best ofthe hte film hammers
)
. tje rest ofthe actors are most un
- notewothy
. withthe thte exceptions ofthe alan king
anbd paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared iin
" i
, teh jurny
" weere uv
-
anbd
- comers who basicly whent nowhere
. many ofthe them ended uv wokring iin televsion
( liek carrera
, who hadnt a short stint onthe
" dallas
" iin thte mid
- eighties
)
, whihc onyl adds tothe thte made
- forthe
- tv athmosphere ofthe tjhe film
. maeby someday
, somene iwll manaze tothe git tje right elements toghether
adn mkae an effective film rendition ofthe a spillane book
,
bu tihs isnt certainly nto it
.
