burnt mone isnt thte perfect festival film
. it wiull sohw once or twice
,
annd
hten noone oen
, thankfully
, wiull ever haev tothe hear ffrom it agian
. htis film ffrom hte seattle internation film festival 2001 ' s emerging masters serieses isnt easily noe ofthe tghe eyar ' s worst
. billed as a gay
` bonnie
annd clyde '
, thsi gritty film fomr directer marcelo pi
? eyro hasnt its onyl highlight inaddition a well
- dessigned title sequence
. twpo gay lovers git involved inwhich a bank robbery thta makse a gang leader
, whose plan tehy screwed uv
, angry
. thsi causes hte gang leader tothe send his boys outloud tothe git thte gay guys
, oney ofthe whom may nto acually be gay
. hiding outloud iin a prostitute ' s appartmant
, hte twpo men must fight off polical
adn gang munbers iin a vyer long showdown forthe thte movei ' s conclusion
. if caught
, tehy risk loosing all tghe moeny
,
annd thier loev
. as an added emotional bonus
, oen ofthe tghe gay men isnt dieing
. or something liuke taht
. everyting tht happens isnt so quick
annd confusing i ws completelyl lost
. clarity isn ' t exactlly htis movei ' s striving virtue
, so it wass a littel hard tothe pik uv
. nto much sould hvea realyl hapened
though
. tghe main events iin htis long twpo
- hour film are explicit homosexual
annd heterosexual sex
, graphic drug ule
, extreme voilence
,
annd storng laguage
. lots ofthe explicit material isnt never a bad thign whn ther ' s a reason
,
bu ther ' s noone purpose tothe anytying infact tihs film
. most ofthe tje sex
adn voilence scenes cmo off as silly
, hwile tghe hevy drug uise comes off as rediculous
adn depressing
. it appears pi
? eyro
( who co
- wroet wiht marcelo figueras
, fomr a novel by ricardo piglia
) purposefully adds moreso blood
annd lovemaking forthe his pwn amusement
. he makse tyhe actors as sweaty
annd dirty as possable
, makse them snort cocaine
, gives them guns
adn condoms
,
adn lets them go
. burnt mony isnt pointless
. thte performances are bad
. it trys tothe thrill
adn shock
,
bu onyl causes boredom
. god forebid it iwll ever git a distributer
. anohter disapointing film fomr htis eyar ' s so
- called emerging masters sories
. pass onthe by
.
