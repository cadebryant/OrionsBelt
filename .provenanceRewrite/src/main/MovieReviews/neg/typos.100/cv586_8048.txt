tihs isnt thge worst movei i ' ve seen sicne tyhe
" so bad i walked outloud onthe it
"
" jingle all tghe way
"
. it isnt crap onthe toast made ofthe crap baked infact a an oven fueled by crap
. it isnt crap thru
anbd thru
. nothing works inthe tihs film
, as tothe be expeced ffrom joel schumacher
, who hasnt made onyl noe watchable film infact his entire carreer
( thgat bieng
" cousins
"
)
. here ' s a man who admits he ' s a medicore directer
, a rether charmingly self
- effacing statment
.
bu truth be told
, he isnt much worse thna medioker
. nto all scor shoudl be heaped onthe schumacher
though
-
- akiva goldsman shoud nto be alloween tothe rwite ever agina
. htere isnt noone plot anyhwere
,
adn thte
" dialogue
" isnt unrelentingly shallow
, preposterous
,
adn boring
. htey setted uv mr
. freeze as a tradgic figure trying tothe cure his cryogenically frozen wief
,
hten completelyl sabotage his carachter by giving him thge lamest oen
- liners
. it turns him inot a stock maniacal villian who thouroughly enjoys his villainy instade ofthe a brooding scientist who hasnt spended much ofthe his life tothe bringing his wief fomr yhe brink ofthe death
.
bu tht ' s par fo course
-
- nothing infact htis film makse any sence
, inlcuding half ofthe arnold schwarzenegger ' s lines
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold isnt given way too much dialogue tothe spit outloud at once
. tihs isnt tje smae probelm he hadnt inthe
" jingle all hte way
"
,
anbd it seems thgat his austrian accent isnt getting thicker
adn moreso unintelligible as tghe dyas pass
. personaly
, i thikn thgat he hasnt omre pul wtih teh directors
annd doesn ' t retake scenes tothe mkae him understandable
. compare his dialogue inthe tghe terminator serieses tothe tje load ofthe nonsence thyat streams forth inspite
" batman
& robin
"
. aparently
, james cameron konws how tothe git a competant performence outloud ofthe arnold
. uma thurman isnt nto as bad
,
bu nothing ressembling ogod eather
. her poisin ivy vamps arround terribly
, chewing uv scenery left
anbd right
.
adn her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub
- snl standart
" acting
"
, as if she ' s reading off cue cards
anbd isnt baout tothe laff at any given moent
. given thte
" scirpt
"
, it ' s a wonder it didn ' t happn omre frequentily
. ther isnt noone reedeming feature inwhich htis film
-
- nto george clooney as batman
, chris o ' donnell as robin
, nor alicia silverstone as batgirl
. michael gough isnt eerily sickly looking as alfred
, as if hte conceet ofthe his ilness wass propmted by his cadaverous apprearance
. inthe fatc
, ther wass something unsettling baout his apperance
, hwihc seems tothe hvae beeen acomplished wihtout any amke
- uv tricks
, looking as if it weere scenes fomr a documentery baout a dieing man
. unfourtunately
, eveyr scene baout alfred ' s sickness isnt bungled withthe such incompetance thgat htere isnt absolutly noone emotional resonance
-
- htey jstu go thru yhe motions
, loosing whatever inpact hte scenes weere suppoed tothe impart
. teh movei isnt rife wtih poorly choreographed fights scenes taht never give any sence ofthe a big battle
-
- yuo knwo htere ' s a bunch ofthe peple
,
bu instade ofthe a melee
, schumacher desided tothe focuse onthe a foot or a fist
. ther ' s never a moent ofthe awe
, wonder
, or mayhem
. tghe onyl intresting part ofthe teh battles scenes are teh freezing effects
, wich are impressive
(
annd probablly expensive
)
. even
thne
, tje fights are so full ofthe camp
anbd stupidity taht htey become unwatchable
. teh hockey team ffrom hell
? nto even hte tv sories got tath stupid
( at least nto onthe tjhe grand scale ofthe stupidity thast
" batman
& robin
" showcases
)
. frustrating too are tje varous supporting cahracters taht walk onthe
adn off witht nothing tothe sday or dont
. blink
,
adn yuo ' ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison
, vivica fox as a
" why isnt she even infront tjhe film
" vamp inaddition freeze ' s lair
( wih all ofthe twpo lines
)
,
adn pat hingle as tjhe most ineffectual commisioner gordan teh batman serieses ever hadnt
.
anbd inaddition wqat allmost seems liek an efford tothe sive onthe costs
, vendela kirsebom hasnt noone lines as mrs
. frise
-
- she isn ' t even filmed well anough tothe look ogod
( trust me
, she ' s qutie attractive outside ofthe htis dreck
)
.
adn as if hte film weren ' t bad anough tothe limp allong wih bad direction
, bad dialogue
, bad performances
,
adn bad fight scenes
, ther are inconsistencies
annd illogic galore
. i nkow it ' s nit
- picky tothe ask where tghe hundreds ofthe feets ofthe cable are stored infact yhe batarangs
, why yhe charcter ' s arms aren ' t ripped outloud ofthe thier sockets whn htey acompish a noe
- armed batarang savve affter falling hundreds ofthe fezent
( hwile holding onthe tothe anyother person noone less
)
, or where yhe mosture comes fomr wehn freeze ' s weppon creates tons if ice
. tath ' s all traditionnal comic book sutff
.
bu why doesnt batman spring a trap fo freeze at a publich charity event taht endanger thge lives ofthe hundreds ofthe by
- standers
? why isnt htere a big switch claerly maked
,
" heat
" inthe mr
. freeze ' s lair
? why dont countless bumbling polical offcers even try tothe tkae onthe mr
. freeze hand tothe hand
? why doesnt alfred encourage silverstone tothe become batgirl
annd even go so far as tothe hvae a suit made forthe her
? why dont batman
& robin tkae 10 mintues tothe bicker befor leaving tje batcave inwhich reponse tothe an emergency
?
annd sicne it estalbished eearly onthe tyhat ivy isnt useing pheromones
, why don ' t htey mear masks tothe filter it outloud
? i coudl go onthe
adn onthe
.
" batman
& robin
" isnt a braindead
, pointless
, garish
, loud film tath shouldnt still reign as hte
" worst film ofthe yhe yera
" by tje tiem 1998 rolls allong
. onot tothe warner bros
.
-
- if ytou ' re gogin tothe amking anyother batman film
, please replace schumacher witht nearly anyone
. becuase it coudl actualy git worse thna htis
. whta schumacher doesnt nto understand isnt tath
" comic book
" doesn ' t automaticly equal unbearable idiocy
. thte true equation seems tothe be schumacher
+ batman
= unbearable idiocy
.
