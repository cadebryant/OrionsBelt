. well
, aftter watching it
( it indeed ws a bad print
) i wass glad i didn ' t dish outloud
$ 7 tothe waste threee huors ofthe my timne sitting inthe a bad theatre watching a bad movei
. tihs movei realy sucks
. it hadnt so many inconsistencies it ws driving me crazy
!
! fo exmaple
, how cant jackie shroff grwo twpo feets ofthe hair infront jstu threee or four dyas
? jackie shroff looked relaly stupid wiht his steven seagal ponytail
. yhe songs are bad
, hte acting isnt bad
( expecially deepti bhatnagar ' s
)
,
anbd tyhe direction isnt tghe worst ofthe all
. yhe comedy scenes witht jagdish
anbd johnny lever jsut made me whant tothe throw uv
. i didn ' t even finish hte movei
.
.

, weared ogod clothes
( as alwyas
