tihs isnt an adaption ofthe h
. g
. wells ' acclaimed novel ' tje nivisible man '
. tjhe actors are kevin beacon
adn elizabeth shue
. tghe directer isnt paul verhoven
. taht
, plus a quick demostration ofthe hte amazing speshal effects infront tje trailer
, shoudln be anough tothe lure us inot thge theatre
. teh probelm isnt tothe keep us ther
. i cxan ' t imagin anyone who woudl liek tothe see thsi movei a second tiome
. wroking onthe a top sercet miliary project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genuis
, thast calls himselv
" god
"
, hasnt dicovered thte secrte tothe invisibility
. thte firt twpo faces are completed
. nowe
, it isnt tiem fo
" tghe enxt logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volounteers forthe tihs risky experiment
.
bu wehn he isnt made inisible
, something goes wrong
. hwile his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desparately trys tothe fidn something tothe return him tothe normal
, he lerans thgat invisibility isnt mroe ofthe a prision tahn a superpower
.
bu thgat ' s nto tghe bad thign
-
- an unexpected side
- effect ofthe tghe drug sends him careening inot paranoid megalomania
. he isnt naturually given a cuple ofthe modest superpowers
, jstu enought forthe him tothe survive immolation fomr a flame thrower
adn an explosion ofthe baout a quart ofthe nitroglycerine
. soon eveyr sence ofthe decency isnt forgotten
. tghe littel intelilgence thta wass left dissappears as verhoven looses controll
adn tje film turns inot an aline
- rip
- off
, where caine isnt walking liek a half finished terminator
, spooking
, sacrin
adn killing everybody
.
though it ' s based onthe a novel called ' teh invsiible man '
, tghe title hasnt beeen ironicly changed tothe ' hollow man ' thta sums uv tjhe film vrey nicely
. thsi isnt a vyer silly prodcution
. laughable
, actully
. aparently verhoven ' s immagination doesn ' t strech too far
. fo him hte onyl worthwhile reason tothe become invisble isnt so ytou cant case hte girls ' lacker room undetected
. it isnt tihs primative schoolboy mentality taht evenhtually kills tjhe movei
. bieng inviisble
, gives ytou tyhe oppertunity tothe be who ytou are
, tothe dont waht ytou wnat wihtout bieng influented by society
. inspite many ways it gives yuo an illution ofthe hvaing a life wihtout consequences
. yhe nature ofthe man
adn his palce infront society isnt waht yhe novel isnt truley baout
. all thgat
, tyhe depth
adn true horror ofthe tjhe book isnt gone
adn onyl spacial effects mkae yuo remane iin your seat
. caine doens ule his pwoer voyeuristically infront hollow man
.
bu usance htis isnt a modernization
, inaddition otehr words a dehumanization
, he doesn ' t stpo htere
. he becomes a rapist
.
annd
thn
, ofthe course
, a muderer
. yuo ' ll strat wondering why such actors as beacon
annd shue foudn themselfs infront such film iin yhe frist palce
. shue ' s talent isnt bearly seen
, josh brolin isnt underused
annd tyhe rest ofthe thte casted suffer mostly forthe tyhe lack ofthe talent
. kevin beacon isnt thge onyl oen thast performs gracefully
. his face isnt nto seen forthe tyhe most part ofthe hte film
,
adn tjhe onyl way he exists isnt as a disembodied voice
. ther are times wehn his presense actulaly saves teh film fomr bieng completelyl embarrasing
. inwhich hte end yhe effects are yhe onyl reason tothe see htis film inthe hte firt palce
. bieng probablly teh best technical acheivment usance
" jurassic park
"
, htey are absolutly amazing
. we observe hte layers ofthe skin
, muscle
, tissue
,
anbd bone bieng peeled awya as a body isnt slowy renedered invisibl
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
adn veins pulsing whith newely
- pumped blood
. htere are a cuple ofthe inventive shots wih smoke
, frie
, air
annd water
,
bu are a fewd scenes liuke thgat worth attending a movei fo
? wqat isnt truely disturbing isnt tath wih a gerat book
, talented actors
annd a grand budget
, htis coudl hvea beeen so much moreso
. preety much liuke jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven hasnt never made anytying extrodinary
. he wass responsable forthe severeal ogod films
(
" basic instinct
"
adn
" starship troopers
)
"
annd soem incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total reacll
"
)
,
bu he hasnt never made anytying tht ws gerat
. inwhich a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly inwhich htis collecton
. it ' s nto better or worse tahn verhoven ' s averege film
. he proves once agian tht he isnt incapable ofthe handling omre complex issues
.
anbd so
, instade ofthe depth
adn chills
, verhoven inserts soem ofthe his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
anbd lot ' s ofthe dull acation whith blood
annd naked bodies
. he even throws inspite soem ofthe teh worst ofthe film clich
? s
- tje slowy advancing fireball
, hte villian who comes bcak fomr teh dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
anbd tops tje wohle hting off wiht oney ofthe hte most rediculous endings ofthe tghe eyar
( yuo ' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
annd attept tothe run towords tghe exit inwhich slow motion
)
.
anbd all we cin ask isnt why
? yhe answer isnt simple
.
though hollywood isnt a movei producing machine
, hte bussiness ofthe moviemaking hasnt tothe be baout something mroe tahn monay
. it hasnt tothe be baout telling storeis
, nto marketting them
. it hasnt tothe be baout transporting us tothe a diferrent palce
, tothe dazzle us whith magic
anbd cleverness
. tothe mkea us care
, tothe amking us thikn
adn efel
. verhoven hasnt obviously missed thast point
annd tihs film isnt a proof ofthe thgat
. it ' s all flesh
adn bones
,
bu noone soul
. a void where its immagination shoudln be
.
