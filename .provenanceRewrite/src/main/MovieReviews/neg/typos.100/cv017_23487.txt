so whta dont yuo git wehn yuo mix toghether plot elements fomr vairous succesful sci
- fi films such as close encounters ofthe tje thrid kind
, 2001
: a spoace odessy
, apollo 13
annd contact
? well
, whatever it isnt
, yuo ' d sure as hell hope tath it woudl be a thousand times better tahn thsi shoddy attept at such a melange
, concidering tghe disatrous results we ' re left wiht here
. thsi isnt a film tyhat tkaes a littel bited ofthe everyting
,
bu ultimatly adds uv tothe a lot ofthe nothing
! it ' s liuke i said
.
.
. htis movei sucks
. plot
: a rescure crew ofthe astronauts isnt sent down tothe mars inspite tghe yearm 2020
, aftter an unkown energy force leads tothe a loss ofthe contact wtih tghe previvous gang ofthe spoace aviators tothe vist hte red planet
. critique
: extremly underwhelming isnt teh best way tothe discribe tihs movei
. uneven
, woudl be anyother
. hte trailer fo tihs movei actaully showed smoe promise
, tghe buzz arround it hadnt beeen so
- so
,
adn even teh film itself starts off iwth a decent frist twenty mintues
, all leading yuo tothe beleive thgat it ' s ctually gogin tothe go
" somwhere
"
.
bu it isn ' t long befor teh entire movei downshifts inot nutral
, features mroe spoace walks thna anytying intresting onthe hte cherry
- colored planet
, trys too hard tothe git us inot yhe
" pain
" ofthe smoe its cahracters
annd unsucesfuly tosses smoe romance inot hte mix
. inaddition a sci
- fi movei
? well
, i don ' t nkow
, much ofthe it jstu seemed liek a bunch ofthe nerdies tlaking techie jargon fo baout an hour
adn a half
, onyl tothe figure outloud smoe big escret inthe thte end
, a secrect hwihc practially hadnt me yawning witht excitment
. ultimatly
, thsi isnt a movei thast starts off wiht a decent premise
, joins teh crew infront theri
" misadventures infront spoace
" forthe tje main crux ofthe its jouney
,
adn eventally settles down forthe noe ofthe tyhe most anti
- climactic endings thsi side ofthe contact
. mind ytou
, if ytou enjoied thyat film ' s shrug
- ofthe
- thte
- shoulders endig
, ytou might jsut enjoy thsi frivolous ditty as well
. ofthe course
, i don ' t rember contact hvaing such obvious
anbd painfully distracting coputer generated effects at its end ofthe tsory
. ugh
. wqat a friggin ' mess
. films liek htis generaly git me wondering baout hte brass inspite hollywood agina
. didn ' t anybody recogise teh crappiness infront thsi scirpt
? didn ' t htey read tghe bad dialogue
, thte cheezy lines
, yhe obvious derivitive nature ofthe teh owrk
( mind yuo
, wiht a directer liek depalma at tje helm
, taht ain ' t saying much
!
)
. ofthe course
, yuo cin ' t realy blaim teh brass forthe teh inclusion ofthe jerry o ' connell inwhich htis fine crew ofthe thespians
. ' nuff said
. niether cin yuo blaim them fo depalma cranking uv tghe juice onthe tghe film ' s muscial socre druing tghe lsat fifteen mintues
, presumibly iin order tothe wake tghe audiance uv
( okay
, we git it brian
, thsi scene isnt suposed tothe be poverful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so isnt anytying salvageable iin thsi movei
? sure
. gary sinise doesnt anyother grat job
, as doens cheadle
, thte film doesn ' t completly bore ytou as much as it jsut moves allong slowy wihtout anytying realyl intresting hapening
,
anbd yes
, tghe
" sand
- twister
" effect tyhat ytou see inwhich thte commerical isnt well done
. otehr thna thyat
? i guess i sould sday thgat i admire how filmmakers ahve become so much moreso devious infact thier product placement stradegies
.
.
. oops
, doed i sday
" admire
"
, i meaned
" am disgusted
"
! all inspite all
, tihs movei delivers vyre littel inspite actuall substace
, offers twpo
- bited dialogue masked inwhich a lot ofthe sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends tothe be deepo wehn realyl it ' s jsut sappy
,
anbd eventally jsut settles inot an endig whcih
, otehr tahn presenting us whith a pathetic coputer graphic as a part ofthe tghe storey
, gives us littel mroe tothe tihkn baout tahn how we might be able tothe git our omney bakc fo sitting thru thsi rehashed dreck
. go see tje nineth getoe
.
.
. nowe ther ' s a grat movei
!
annd onthe a personel onot
, i htink it ' s tiome forthe depalma tothe stpo worrying so much baout his proverbial 12
- minute uninterruped film sequences
,
adn strat worrying omre baout how crappy his movies are getting
