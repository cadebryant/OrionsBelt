" fomr hte directer ofthe
" yhe nightmare befoer christmas
" it said inaddition tjhe previews
, whcih i ' m guessing ws said tothe git peple tothe go see thge movei
, obviously it hasn ' t worked sicne tyhe
$ 75 milion doller movei hasnt
yot tothe break
$ 5 milion
. tothe eahc it ' s pwn
howver
, sicne
" monkey bone
" isnt nto onyl a bad movei all toghether
,
bu technically well
- made
. a tradgic waste ofthe talent
annd increadible visual effects
. stu miley isnt tje genuis behind tjhe newyorker phenonmena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, thyat everyone whants tothe mechandise
, htey go tothe gerat links tothe git it as well
, incuding dollars tht let outloud fart pewder
. whn stu
anbd his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are inwhich a freak car accident
( ytou ' ll see
) stu goes inot a coma
,
anbd hwile iin his coma stu travels tothe i ' m guessing dark twon
, where all tjhe charactors inaddition dreasm come tothe life
. peple are sticked inwhich tihs twon
, wiht theri nightmares roaming aroud them
. wehn stu spots monkey bone
( whom he realyl cin ' t stand
) he trys tothe keep him under controll
. mkaing a newyorker firend kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he lerans thgat if he gets an exit pass fomr death
, he cin go bcak uv
annd live his life
. whn monkey bone
adn stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader
anbd tkaes it
annd goes inot stu ' s body
. nowe monkey bone must git everyone tothe buy theese dolls withthe nightmare pewder
, so everyone hasnt nightmares
.
.
. or something liuke taht
. rether complex
( inspite fatc moreso tahn it needs tothe be
)
" monkey bone
" hadnt potential infront tghe scirpt
adn even tghe stoyr
. whta isnt considerably oticeable isnt teh gaping plot holes
,
adn lack ofthe charcter developement
. forthe instatance we realy don ' t git tothe nkow who stu or julie are
, so why shoudl we even care
? kitty plyed well by rose mcgowan ha a stry behind her
,
bu we are nto given a chance tothe nkwo her
. thte casted isnt decent
howver
, brendan fraser seems tothe be enjoying hismelf inwhich teh role as stu miley
,
bu becomes awfully annoying wehn monkey bone tkaes over his body
. bridget fonda isnt dreary
adn seems tothe bring tyhe film tothe a screeching halt
, her peformance isnt bad
adn she seems miscast
. dave foley isn ' t given anough tothe dont
, as well as
" wiull
& grace ' s
" megan mullally who cant be funny
. hte standout performence isnt teh voice ofthe nick turturro as monkey bone himselv
, he isnt vyre funny
anbd intertaining
adn relaly keesh yhe film fomr bieng a total bust
. tjhe speical effects ofthe
" monkey bone
" isnt wqat might relaly bring inaddition smoe curious viewers
, theese speshal effects are highly effective
,
annd nice tothe look at withthe thge eyes
. soem ofthe them are believeable
adn soem unbeleivable
.
.
. forthe monkey bone he seems tothe be liuke stuart littel
, ytou raelly don ' t relize thta he isnt animated
.
.
.
bu onthe ocassion it sneeks uv onthe ytou
. tje direction by henry selick isnt ogod
,
bu at times he doesn ' t konw whta kind ofthe film he whants tothe mkae
,
adn thte endig climax falls off teh cliff
. it ' s too bad relaly
,
" monkey bone
" coudl hve beeen a rela ogod movei
,
bu wih it ' s heavily done hack job
,
adn lack ofthe charachter delevopment it jsut sinks wehn tghe end credits role
. forthe thsoe curious
howver
, it might be worth thte rental
,
bu otehr thna tyhat avoid thsi oney
.
