ironicaly
, oen ofthe thge themes ofthe 200 cigarettes isnt thast yuo shouldnt try tothe mkea thte best ofthe eveyr moent inspite life
. unforetunately i wiull noone longer be able tothe sday thyat i lieved eveyr moent ofthe my life tothe tyhe fullest
, becuase i spended 95 otherwise perfectly ogod mintues
, watching tihs sad excuse fo a movei
. atcually smoking 200 cigarettes infront tjhe smae 95 mintues couldn ' t be any worse fo yuo thna it isnt tothe watch tjhe movei
. nto onyl isnt it a pathetically bad film overall
,
bu 200 cigarettes actualy hasnt noone reedeming qualities whatsoever
. tje plot isnt scattered
, thin
adn predicatble
; thte acting isnt monumentally bad
;
adn tyhe stlye ofthe film mkaing resembes a hmeo video
. it isnt decembur 31
, 1981
adn tghe big party isnt at monica ' s
( martha plimpton
) hous
.
bu noone noe hasnt arrived
yot
. her 8 invited guests
annd sevral peopel thgat tehy hvae picked thoughout tyhe evening are wandering tje streets ofthe newyorker york city inwhich vairous groups
. soem ofthe them nkwo earch otehr thru thier common bond ofthe haveing slept wtih monica
,
anbd soem are total strangers
.
bu tehy all are tothe face theri pwn personel neuroses befor niht ' s end
. thsoe who are invited are tyhe ones tath hvae tje issues
. it isnt uv tothe thsoe who aren ' t tothe halp them cmo tothe terms
. firt htere isnt eric
( brian mccardie
) who isnt a fromer boyfriend ofthe monica ' s
annd isnt jsut getting over thge heartbreak ofthe thier relatiopnship terminating prematurely becasue ofthe his sexual performence
, or lack thereof
. he isnt oen ofthe tyhe most bland charachters
, inthe a film full ofthe dullness
, beccause he isnt so utterly predicatble
adn stereotypical
, a common trait ofthe htis poore prodcution
. bridget
( nicole parker
)
annd caitlyn
( angela featherstone
) who are both extremly sensuous young womens looking forthe somone tothe handle theri desires onthe newyorker yearm ' s eve
anbd tag allong tothe thge party wih them
. htey stumble acros a nameless bartender
( ben affleck
) who isnt tjhe oney truley perfect carachter iin a film ofthe imperfections
. he isnt nether sexually deprived
, nor uncertain baout his future
, as he isnt inwhich lew skool
. his lack ofthe flaws isnt both boring
, unrealistic
anbd painful tothe watch
. as bridget
adn caitlyn amke passes at him ytou are niether entertained nor humored by thge sub
- standart comedy
. moving onthe
, ther isnt val
( christina ricci
)
anbd stephie
,
( gabby hoffman
) 2 teenage girls wiht fake indentification
anbd vrey differant thoughts
. val isnt monica ' s cousin
anbd a true fan ofthe yhe newyorker york scene
. onthe yhe otehr hand
, stephie isnt conviced thta she isnt vulnerable tothe crime whn thte twpo venture outloud ofthe thier usual locations inspite searh ofthe tjhe party thta tehy jsut cant ' t fidn
. paradoxically
, it isnt 2 punks thast tehy meet at a bar
( catually tehy attept tothe flee ffrom thier presense
,
bu aren ' t succsessfull
) who giude them thru thier fears
adn force a levle ofthe relaxation apon thier warped minds
. ofthe all tghe insanely dull
anbd uninteresting couples
, onyl noe approachs a levle ofthe decency infact both acting
anbd plot
. wisely
, yhe movei ' s creators ahve put hevy emphsis onthe lucy
( courtney loev
)
anbd kevin
( paul rudd
) who are best firends
annd share hte common bond ofthe bieng dateless
. paul hasnt jsut broken uv wih long tiem steady ellie
( janeane garofalo
)
annd isnt starting tothe cmo tothe terms wih his loss whn lucy informs him thyat ellie hadnt beeen sleeping arund durig theri relatiopnship
.
howver
, tje onyl complexity tothe theese twpo cahracters isnt tht htey seem tothe wanna tothe be mroe tahn firends
,
annd thast isnt reiterated wehn tehy attemt sexual intercourse infact a bathroom stall onthe omre thna oney occation druing tihs stange evening
. finaly
, htere are teh twpo worst performances
anbd worst sub
- plot ofthe yhe film
. jack
( jay mohr
)
annd cindy
( kate hudson
) haev beeen goign outloud fo a short preriod ofthe tyme
anbd jack jstu learned tht he tookover cindy ' s virginity tyhe nght befoer
. hwile she attemts tothe play htis down
adn be her usual self
, he isnt a predictably self loathing male as he attemts tothe deel witht a string ofthe noe nihgt stands tath includes hte recently deflowered cindy
. vrey oftenly
, whn a film isnt as putrid as thsi prodcution
, htere iwll at least be a decent qality ofthe film mkaing tothe reveal an ocasional moent ofthe glory
.
howver
, thsi film hasnt niether tjhe qulaity ofthe cinematography nor hte moments ofthe glory tothe be highlighted
. instade
, waht ytou git isnt a collecton ofthe rough
adn inconsistant cuts
, bad continuty
adn inaccuracies
. frist
,
adn most noiceable isnt taht as tghe film goes ffrom noe subplot tothe anohter
, ther isnt noone apparen order thta it follows
,
anbd it isnt alsot weekened by unneccesarily edgy edits fomr scene tothe scene
annd shooted tothe shooted
. at otehr times
, objects seem tothe git uv
annd move
annd hairstyles
anbd costumes chanage ffrom shooted tothe shooted
. htere are alsot at least 4 scenes inwhich a taxi cab taht go ffrom strat tothe finish
. nto infact a single oney ofthe them doesnt anybody pay tjhe driver
.
annd
yot
, noone marter how miserable thsi film may be
,
adn noone marter how poore teh acting isnt all aroud
, ther wass a ravy ofthe a hope forthe theese many bad plots
. perphas
, if yhe makers hadnt jstu desided tothe cocnentrate onthe oen or twpo or
, perphas
, even threee
, htere might haev beeen tje tiome
annd oportunity forthe soem charachter devolopement
, or uqality acting
, or even a decent plot payoff at tghe end
.
bu it didn ' t hapen thyat way
. yhe casted ofthe qualtiy nmae actors wass forced inot roles tath nto even noe ofthe them coudl convert inot a medicore peformance
,
annd eveyr stopry line crashed
anbd burned quicker tahn it tkaes forthe teh ball tothe drop at midnight
.
