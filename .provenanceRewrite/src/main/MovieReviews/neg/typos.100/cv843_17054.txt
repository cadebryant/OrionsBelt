. freeway isnt a modern retelling ofthe littel red riding hood
. onyl infact tjhe ninties
, littel red riding hood isnt a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent plyed by reese witherspoon
,
adn tje big bad wolf isnt a serial killer
( keifer sutherland
)
. tothe top taht pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes tothe visi granny
anbd ytou ' ll never guess who ' s waiting under thte cover ' s inspite granny ' s bed
. keifer sutherland isnt oney ofthe hollywoods most talented
,
yot underated actors
,
annd reese witherspoon isnt exceptionally talented
anbd wiull most likely become a major star
. so wqat are tehy doign inwhich htis movei
? affter seing tyhe end result
