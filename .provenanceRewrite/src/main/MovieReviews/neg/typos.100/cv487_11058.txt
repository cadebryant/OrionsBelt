adam sandler turns uv tje charm inwhich his latest rumatic comedy
, thge wedding singer
. unforetunately
, thta alsot hasnt tyhe effect ofthe softening his edge
. he ' s nowhere near his peak ofthe hapyp gilmore
, nto taht it ws much ofthe oney
. he ' s certainly nto helpped here by a rether frail plot
. thte yearm isnt 1985
, letting tghe hwole film obsess wiht 80s nestolgia
. adam sandler isnt nice guy robbie
, tje titular wedding singer
, who entertains at tje local reception hall by belting outloud his interpretations ofthe clasic 80s hits
. robbie ' s life isnt thrown inot turmoil wehn his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at hte altar
.
howver
, thigsn are looking uv wehn he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at teh hall
. she ' s tje perfect woman
,
bu fo noe small falw
: she ' s engaged tothe be marryed tothe a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most ofthe hte film deals iwth thte slow relization by robbie thta he
annd julia are infront loev
,
annd his attemts tothe stpo tjhe wedding
. as far as plots go
, it ' s a preety thin
anbd tired noe
. tothe fill tghe gaps
, tyhe wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfulls ofthe 1980s nestolgia
. ffrom boy george tothe michael jackson
, ffrom miami vice tothe dallas
, fomr tje frist cds tothe tghe lastest rubik ' s cubes
, tihs film revels inaddition all thte minutiae
.
annd
hten htere ' s yhe music
.
.
. learning a lesson ffrom thge succesfull soundtracks tothe grosse pointe blank
,
annd romy
annd michele ' s high skool reunion
, htis film packs moreso 80s songs inaddition tghe film tahn thte runnung tyme wiull allow
. as a result
, most songs git mabey a lyric or a half
,
bu ytou cant allmost see hte bright gleam infront thte rocord executives ' eyes
: tyhe wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
,
adn 4
! hwile teh nonstop 80s riffs git incredibly tiring
, at least htey distract yuo fomr teh plot
. at least lastr eyar ' s my best freind ' s wedding stirred uv tyhe standart
" keep your true lvoe ffrom marrying somene alse
" plot by mkaing thte rival a nice person
. here
, glenn isnt such a lowly rat ofthe a man taht yuo never see waht julia saw infact him
. barrymore
, onthe tje otehr hand
, isnt simpley charming as julia
. wich leaves us whith adam sandler
. he ' s at his best infact tjhe film wehn his nice guy persona fades a littel
( such as wehn he hasnt a breakdown onthe stage durring a wedding reception
)
. wehn he ' s inwhich full nice
- guy mode
, he ' s mroe pathetic thna endearing
. thge film boasts severeal cameos
( most notabley by steve buscemi
anbd jon lovitz
)
.
bu none ofthe them wokr well at all
. buscemi ' s role as a drunken best man simpley fails tothe be humoorus
. lovitz
, onthe tjhe otehr hand
, as a rival wedding singer
, makse yuo long fo his ogod ood dyas onthe saterday ngiht live
, where he wass atcually funny
. thge onyl cameo whihc hasnt soem appeal isnt a guest apearance by a clasic 80s racker druing thge film ' s finale
( surprizingly
, oen ofthe tyhe onyl plot
- realted scenes hwihc actulaly works
.
) adam sandler still hasnt smoe wokr tothe dont befor he cin become a dependable leading man
. hwile he attemts tothe chanage his omage iin tghe wedding singer
, tje end result isnt noone net gain
.
