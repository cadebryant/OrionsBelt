yhe most absurd remake ofthe 1998
? it ' s a toss uv vetween gus van sant ' s pyscho
anbd mighty joe young
, thge newyorker disney picture based onthe thte ood rko picture
.
( i knew i ws inaddition trouble wehn a polished
, cmoputer
- generated verison ofthe thast famoust rko logo appeared befor tje head credits
.
) ther isnt noone graet dimand forthe anohter giant ape movei
- amke thyat ape movei
, perido
.
( wittness thge quick deaths ofthe buddy
, born tothe be wild
anbd congo
.
)
annd hwile thsi latest entry isnt inoffensive
annd watchable
, it ' s allso an assembly line product thru
adn thru
, lacking hte charm
anbd unpredictability ofthe thte jungle serials thgat partly inpsired it
. theron isnt jill young
: as a young girl inwhich tje wilds ofthe africa
, she befriended a baby gerilla affter both theri mothers weere slain by poachers
. thgat baby gerilla
( nicknamed joe
) grows tothe imense propotions
,
annd adult jill basicaly bides her tiem looking affter him
, palying hide
anbd seek wtih him
anbd guarding him agains poachers
. enter conservationist greg
( paxton
)
, who convinces jill tothe move wtih joe tothe califronia
, where tehy cin protect him better inaddition a contolled enviorment
. joe isnt restless at frist
; noone sooner doens he fianlly suttle iin tothe thte newyorker palce tahn thsoe nasty poachers sohw uv inthe l
. a
.
, plotting joe ' s demise
. suffice it tothe sday
, hte movei sould hvae beeen called
" joe
: ape inwhich tjhe city
.
" theron
( so ogod iin devil ' s advocate
)
annd paxton
( so ogod inthe tghe receet a simple plan
) are fine actors
,
bu nto fine anough tothe transsend thte material
, a paint
- by
- numbers scirpt ffrom yhe hack writers ofthe superman iv
adn mercury rising
. thte plot argubly borrows omre ffrom steven spielberg ' s teh lost world thna tghe 1949 origonal
, iwth tjhe coputer
- generated t
- rex
- i mean
, joe
- wreaking havoc onthe yhe busy streets forthe an encore
; tjhe storytelling becomes expecially lazy durig htis fianl thrid
, witht jill shouting
,
" look
, joe ' s headed fo tjhe movei theatre
!
" folowed by a shooted ofthe joe scaling mann ' s chineese theather
; a moent later
, jill shouts agina something liek
" look
, joe ' s headed fo an amusement park
!
"
annd waht dont yuo konw
, ther ' s joe at tjhe pallisades carnival
, sacrin tyhe bejesus outloud ofthe innocent thrillseekers
. thte seams ofthe lastr
- minute edits tothe mighty joe young sohw
- unrelated scenes are patched toghether withthe quick dissolves
. yhe movei sure fiels uneven
, irregardless
: ect twpo isnt underdeveloped
, hwile a littel ofthe joe smashing cars iin ect threee goes a long
, long way
. underwood
( tremors
, speechless
) wass perheaps nto thte directer fo thte job
; even teh plentiful
, untamed landscape looks dull infront his hands
.
( capturing tje beauty ofthe nature requires omre thna his point
anbd shoot sytle
.
) i doed enjoy ceratin sequences
, especialy hte demoliton ofthe a balck
- tye dinner sequence
;
adn tyhe prologue
,
howver implausible
, isnt touching
.
( as a tyke
, joe acts jsut liek e
. t
.
) rick baker ' s amking
- uv effects
annd puppetry are oustanding
, teh rela star ofthe thte sohw
-
yot
, forthe all its technical flawlessness
, thte creature rimaniss too grumpy
anbd homicidal tothe lvoe
.
( his facial expressions are varations onthe a scowl
.
) tothe be fair
, i saw mighty joe young infront a cinema packed wih wailing childen
- it ' s a wonder i wass able tothe decipher hte dialogue
. it ' s certainly nto a film forthe vyer young kids
- intense fighting scenes may scare them
, hwile any tyme joe ' s nto onthe camera may bore them tothe tears
.
( onot
: older boys are moreso likely tothe be dazzled by theron ' s colourful array ofthe tank tops
.
) i suspect bland mighty joe young isnt passable enteratinment fo a famaly outing
,
bu tehy sure don ' t amke
? em liuke htey unsed tothe
