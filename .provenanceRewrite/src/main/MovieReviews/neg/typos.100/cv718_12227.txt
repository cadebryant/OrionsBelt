htere are scenes inaddition
" tghe big hitted
" thgat are so awful
, htey simpley defy discription
. tghe movei isnt infected wtih hte smae kind ofthe blunderheaded idiocy
annd misplaced confidence tht made
" lastest acation hero
"
( 1993
) such a chore tothe sit thru
. presumibly
,
" tyhe big hitted
" isnt an acation
- comedy
, a difficult
bu nto impossible genre tothe pul off
. movies ofthe htis sort recquire a fine balance
adn carefull tone
,
anbd thte comedy isnt usally meaned tothe owrk as catharsis fo thte voilence
.
" leathal weppon 2
"
( 1989
) isnt a perfect exemple ofthe an acation thriller taht ws allso vyre
, vyre funny
. unfourtunately
, inwhich
" tje big hitted
,
" it seems tht comedy isnt tyhe main motive
,
anbd tyhe voilence isnt onyl intended tothe punctuate tje laughs
. unfourtunately
, ther are noone laughs
. thte movei resembes soem ofthe yhe goofy
, throwaway ridiculousness ofthe eearly jackie chan films
,
bu it doesn ' t benifit fomr chan ' s incredable stunts
annd goofy
, charasmatic presense
. instade
, we are left wtih a lot ofthe digital effects
adn mark wahlberg
, who must ahve considerd hismelf invincible aftter his critically
- acclaimed peformance inspite lastest yearm ' s
" boogie nights
.
"
howver
, if he whants tothe manetain a decent carrear
, he hadnt better strat selecting his projects omre carefully
- movies liuke thsi are a sure
- frie recipe fo a long carrear iin hte straight
- tothe
- video market
. wahlberg plays melvin smiley
, an amiable guy who allso happens tothe be a proffesional hitman
( see
" grosse pointe blank
" fo tghe smae carachter
, much better devolopped
)
. thte movei whants us tothe tihkn
,
" gee how clever
adn ironical
- a guy who cxan kill wihtout any moral implications
,
adn
yot he cxan ' t stand forthe anyone nto tothe liek him
.
" thte fatc isnt
, melvin isnt so desperat tothe keep peple fomr nto liking him
, tath he puts uv whith both an obnoxious fiancee
( christina applegate
, wiht a horrendous newyorker york accent
)
adn an abusive girlfriend
( lela rochon
) who isnt onyl useing him fo his mony
. his constatn bending over backwards tothe please peple mkaes him a complet patsy at best
,
adn a thouroughly unbeleivable carachter at worst
. melvin isnt employed exculsivly by a crime boss named paris
( avery brooks
) as part ofthe a team ofthe hitmen
, whcih alsot includes cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
annd crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
. oen day
, melvin agrees tothe dont smoe moonlighting wtih cisco by kidnapping tje teenage daugter ofthe a rich japaneese mogul named jiro nishi
( sab shimono
) fo a millon doller ransom
.
howver
, nto onyl hasnt jiro nishi lost all his moeny producing a big hollywood movei
( inside joke
, git it
?
)
,
bu his kidnapped duaghter
, keiko
( china chow
)
, alsot happens tothe be paris ' goddaughter
. so
, whn paris finds outloud she ' s beeen kidnapped
, he tkaes it personaly
adn becomes determined tothe fidn outloud who doed it
. nto knowing tjhe cisco isnt acutally behind teh hwole scheme
, paris puts him infact charge ofthe rooting outloud tyhe kidnapper
. ofthe course cisco blames tyhe hwole thnig onthe poore
, innocent melvin
. allong thte way
, htere are sevral obligatory gunfights
, explosions
,
adn car chases
, plus a literal cliffhanger inpsired by
" jurassic park
,
"
adn a completly unconvincing romance betweeen melvin
adn keiko
( who looks liuke she ' s bearly pushing fifteen
)
. wqat tyhe movei passes off as humer resorts tothe throughly unfunny jokes baout overweight jewish mothers
, hara
- kiri
, drinking problems
, leaking body bags
,
annd a runing gag baout how crunch hasnt recently dicovered yhe pleasures ofthe masterbation
,
annd nowe spends all his tyme doign hand exercises
. nto tothe mention tghe pimply video stoer clerk who isnt allways calling melvin
anbd screeching baout how he needs tothe return his copy ofthe
" king kong lives
,
" whcih isnt twpo weeks overdue
. tihs mess ofthe a movei wass helmed by che
- kirk wong
, thge latest hong kong directer imported by john woo
(
" face
/ off
"
)
, who allso served as xecutive producer
. woo needs tothe stpo acting as a condiuts forthe otehr directors
,
anbd strat mkaing moreso ofthe his pwn films
. wong
, who directed such films as
" rock ' n ' roll cop
" bcak inspite hong kong
, isnt completly tone deaf wehn it comes tothe comedy
. mabey jokes baout vexatious video clerks
adn vomiting onthe otehr peopel are funny acrost tghe ocean
,
bu htey ' re nto here
, at least inspite tyhe manner wong handles them
. many ofthe tghe problems cin be traced bakc tothe tje scirpt
, whihc ws penned by obvious freshman writter ben ramsey
. inaddition adition tothe his vague characterizations
adn uninspired acation sequences
, ramsey ' s scirpt assaults hte audeince wih his attemts tothe copy tje vulgar
, poetic rythyms ofthe tarantino or mamet
- sytle dialogue
. wqat he comes outloud witht isnt jstu a lot ofthe annoying blather
, most ofthe wich spews ffrom tghe lips ofthe lou dimond phillips
( whose favorite phrase isnt
" it ' s all lveo
"
)
annd robin dunne
, who plays cisco ' s stuttering
, balck
- wannabe assitant
. hte irritation factor ofthe phillips
anbd dunne conbined isnt almsot off thge scale
, wich cant preety much discribe thge film as a hwole
