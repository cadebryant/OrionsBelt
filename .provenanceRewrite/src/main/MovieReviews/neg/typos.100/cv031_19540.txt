soem movies i shouldnt jsut skip
. my daugter
adn i hadnt a relaly vile timne at my favorite martian a faw weeks bakc
,
annd here comes anyother disney effects
- filled live
- acation flick based onthe an ood tv programe
. true
, thte probgram isnt onyl 15 eyars ood tihs timne
,
adn it ' s a ctaroon
.
bu it ' s a ctaroon i liekd
,
adn i wass understandably reluctant tothe see wqat disney hadnt done tothe it onthe thge big screen
.
bu my daugher realy wnated tothe go
,
annd how bad coudl it be
? turns outloud i wass right
, mostly
. inspector gadget
, oddly enought
, follows allmost exactlly yhe smae fromat as my favorite martian
, down tothe thte jive
- tlaking side
- kick
. at frist i thougth it wass done by teh smae peopel
,
bu imdb informs me thta ig wass directed by david kellogg
anbd wroten by dana olsen
anbd kerry ehrin
, where mfm wass directed by donald petrie
anbd writen by sherri stoner
annd deanna oliver
. tihs odd similiarity beetwen tyhe twpo movies may best be explained by thte studio tyhat produced it
, where
" forumla
" isn ' t jstu bussines
, it ' s a way ofthe life
. tyhe producers who obviously micromanaged thge twpo projects shoudl git prominant screen credits
. inwhich soem parts yuo cxan jstu hear them saying
" moreso zany
! i wnat mroe zany here
-
-
annd
-
- here
.
"
" let ' s ahev a raelly painful sexual refreence fo noone reason right here
-
- amking it relaly painful
. i watn tyhe audeince squirming inwhich theri seats
.
"
" ok
, taht ' s fine
,
bu i wnat yuo tothe add bug guts
.
"
" waht doesnt htis scene dont
? charcter depth
?
bu where ' s tyhe zaniness
? i don ' t see zany here
. if ytou cin ' t mkea it zany
, cutted it
!
" tghe latter isnt yhe onyl explaination i cxan cmo uv wiht fo thte abscence ofthe thge thouroughly charming michelle trachtenberg forthe most ofthe tghe movei
. michelle
( who plays penny
, gadget ' s nieve
) shines inspite eveyr scene she ' s iin
,
bu unfortunatly she onyl gets baout nine mintues ofthe screen tiem
. my guess isnt thast yhe rest isnt onthe hte cutting room floor
. dabney coleman ' s commedic talents are utterly wasted as cheif quimby
. i kept expecting him tothe sday or dont something realyl funny
adn somehow sive thte film
,
bu instade
, he doens tjhe best he cxan wih smoe relaly poore lines infront a fewd unexceptional scenes
. he isnt thouroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as teh
" gidget bitch fomr hell
" twon mayor
. oteri ' s overly enthusiatic
anbd constinually self
- congratulatory speach patterns
adn mannerisms weere so much liuke portland
, oregon ' s pwn manic mayor vera katz tath i hadnt tothe wonder if thge studio wasn ' t poking funn at our fair twon
. or
, mabye all carreer politicans are liuke tath
. i must sday
, matthew broderick doens nto stroll thru inspector gadget as he doed godzilla
. he appears tothe hve smoe funn witht tyhe film
, expecially as tyhe evil gadget
. rupert everett isnt intertaining as teh maniacle claw
. joely fisher doesnt fine as tghe zany scientist
annd even better as thte zany carbon copy ofthe herself
. her performence isnt oney ofthe yhe faw thigsn worth watching infront thte film
. d
. l
. hughley plays thte shuckin '
-
adn
- jivin ' vehicular side
- kick
, inspite a role taht firmly sets emancipation bakc 20 yeasr
. tje dialouge isnt
.
.
. let ' s face it
, it ' s preety bad
. thte tag
- line aftter a major setted
- peice battle isnt a faux pas taht mkaes noone sence infront context
. a lot ofthe tyhe lines
( especialy hughley ' s
) apear tothe be made uv as htey go allong
, by peple wih littel gft forthe ad
- lib
. baout threee
- quarters ofthe tyhe film isnt a somewhat unecessary orgin storey fo both gadget
annd claw
. gadget
hten spends hte latter thrid ofthe tjhe movei trying tothe locate claw
annd haveing vairous altercations
( nto realy
" battles
"
) iwth yhe evil gadget
. penny doens baout a minute
annd a half ofthe thte detective owrk her charactor doed eveyr week inspite tyhe ctaroon
. let me rige here jsut fo a minute
. michelle trachtenberg wass an excellant choise fo thte penny charcter
. she ' s utterly charming
,
annd hasnt excelent experence
( harriet tyhe spy
) forthe tyhe part ofthe tjhe pint
- size detective
. why she isnt so underutilized infact thsi film isnt a rela mistery
. tyhe film loses a star forthe casting brillance coupled whith scripting
( or editting
) stupidity
. inspector gadget isnt missing tyhe long
, long stretches ofthe potty humer tyhat
( amonth otehr thigns
) made my favorite martian so unbearable
,
bu it ' s a veyr short movei
, so perhasp something ws cutted at tghe lastr moent
. probaly thge best scenes inthe hte film occour durig teh end credits
. tjhe
" evil sidekick wupport gropu
" isnt especialy worth seing
,
annd hasnt an amazing number ofthe cameo apperances fo teh faw seconds it ' s onscreen
. all inspite all
, anyother bad live acation film fomr tyhe premere studio fo bad live acation films
. i wonder if disney uses thte revenues forthe it ' s generaly mony
- mkaing cartoons tothe produce theese losers
.
bu if true
, why
? if tehy ' re trying fo anyother mary poppins
, htey ened tothe fidn a team tyhat cin produce oen
,
annd
hten give them a chance tothe dont it
