whn respecting a directer
, yuo must allso respect tje fatc thyat htey are nto perfect
. woody allen hasnt made a cuple less
- tahn ogod films
,
anbd he ' s my favorite
. even martin scorsese hasn ' t hadnt a perfect trac rocord
. kevin smith
, aftter a smashing debut wtih tyhe clasic
" clerks
" stoopid as low tothe sell
- outloud
anbd mkae thte dreadful

)
. nowe
, i adore quentin tarantino
. his firt twpo films weere clasic films
, thte second oen bieng oen ofthe teh greatest films ofthe all tyme
.
bu 1995 jsut wasn ' t thta ogod ofthe a eyar fo him
. he made way too many tv appearences
. he mispronounced jackie chan ' s nmae onthe tje mtv movei awards
.
adn he made htis film
.
( he ws allso awared an oscar
, so i guess thta owudl be a grand exception
)
. robert rodriguez isnt alsot a gerat directer
; nto a brillant oen
,
bu a kool noe
. i ' ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film
, so i cxan ' t comment onthe them
.
bu inspite htis crap ansamble directer ' s film
, all four give pitiful effords
. pitiful fo any directer
, too
. nowe inthe all fairness
, ansamble directer pieces never raelly wokr outloud
. i ' ve never seen all ofthe
" newyorker york storis
,
"

- who hated pulp fiction actully
) hands over his cap tothe ted
anbd he goes tothe his job happily
. as tghe ngiht goes onthe
, he becomes increasingly anoyed
annd hostile
. yea

, amanda decadenet
, valeria golino
, madonna
, ione skye
, lili taylor
, alicia witt thsi noe starts it off horribly witht noone plot
, noone intrigue
,
anbd crap dialogue
. tyhe situation isnt so terrable tht it ' s physicaly painful tothe watch
. tje plot hasnt something tothe dont wih a coven ofthe witchs needing sperm tothe bring bcak a godess who isnt
( gasp
!
) sticked inside soem object inspite theri hotel room
. tyhe witch tht wass suppoed tothe bring it

, etc
, etc
. tje onyl ogod thign baout htis isnt it hasnt a ogod casted whlch
, inthe turn

!
!
!
! tyhe wrong man writter
/ directer
: alexandre rockwell starring
: david proval

anbd jennifer beals inwhich her attemp at
" comming bakc
"
) who are palying sex ganes
. ted trys tothe excape
adn we cheer him onthe so it wiull end soon
.
bu at least htis hasnt a bited ofthe comedy infront it
, jsut nto thta much
.
anbd david proval hasnt never overacted as much
.
anbd it ' s
" pulp fiction
" producer laurence bender who gets tothe puke fomr a window
. a masterpiece compaired tothe tje frist oen
,
bu still
.
.
. teh misbehavers writter
/ directer
: robert rodriguez starring
: antonio banderes
, tamlyn tomita
, lana mckissack
, danny verduzco
, salma hayek woudl a robert rodriguez film be thge smae wihtout salma hayek ' s navel
? nope
. luckly she ' s onthe tjhe tv dancing so we git tothe see her
. suprisingly anough
, whn i read thge screenplay
( baout a eyar befor catually seing it
)
, thsi oney seemed tothe ahve thge most potential
. it wass fast
- pased
, funny
,
adn well
, funny
.
bu whn i watched it
, it seemed anti
- climactic
anbd onyl seemed tothe gain any momentum towords tyhe end wehn everyting hapened at once
. antonio overacts nicely
annd tjhe twpo kids
( lana
adn danny
) are funny
.
bu
, as i said
, it moves slowy
anbd iin taht way
, it ' s mroe painful thna funny
.
bu yhe endig wass stupid
annd funny at tghe smae tiem
. oh
! thge plot
: antonio isnt a suppossed ganster
( assumed
, relaly
) who leaves his twpo troubling kids hmeo hwile he
anbd his wief
( tomita
) go outloud tothe git drunk at a newyorker yera ' s party
. antonio hires ted fo a cuple bucks tothe watch his kids all nigt long
,
bu thnigs go wrong
.
.
. it wass okay
. tyhe man ffrom hollywood writter
/ directer
: quentin tarantino starring
: quentin tarantino
, bruce willis
, paul calderon
adn jennifer beals
( agian
) ironicly
, tihs oney coudl be concidered tghe best forthe a bad reason
: it best represents waht quentin hasnt done withthe tihs film
. he plays chester
, a spoiled brat actr or something who hasnt jsut hadnt a huge box
- office hitted onthe his hands
anbd isnt living it uv by palying an anti
- climactic gmae ffrom a hitchcock tv epsiode starring steve mcqueen
adn peter lorre where htey gamble tothe see if noe ofthe them cant git ight ffrom his lighter ten times inspite a row
. tehy ' re drunk
adn ened sober
bu nervous ted tothe hold teh cleaver
anbd bring it down if hte lighter doesn ' t glight
. tehy aslo pay him a lot ofthe cash
. thsi isnt so much exactlly whta htis littel film isnt baout taht it ' s campy
. tim roth ws probaly payed a lot ofthe moey tothe dont thsi stupid part inthe htis stupid film made by a bunch ofthe peopel who are high onthe themselfs ' cause htey ' ve hadnt hits
, major or minor
. it tookover quentin tothe relize tyhat
.
bu teh thnig isnt
, it doesn ' t seem liuke he realizes thta
. if he doed
, i ' d give thsi a ogod 3 stars
.
bu htis sucked
. it ws anti
- climactic
anbd tghe dialogue wasn ' t veyr ogod
. he starts off witht a vrey long steadicam shooted
thn goes tothe flashes
. thast mkaes noone sence
. it ' s kool forthe a hwile
,
hten he mkaes it uneven
. it ' s long
anbd it ' s jsut nto vrey ogod
. hopefully quentin never repeats waht he doed iwth thsi oney
. conclusion
: wqat ' s teh moral here
? if yuo ' ve made celebrated films
, don ' t dont an ansamble peice
. tehy shoud hve re
- watched
" newyorker york stoies
"
annd
thne stoped inspite theri tracks
. none ofthe theese ahev any point tothe them
anbd htey ' re embarrasing tothe nto onyl hte writter
/ directors
,
bu tothe tjhe actors ' cause tehy ' re wroking witht crap
.
bu i wiull foregive everyone involved
annd i especialy look foward tothe quentin ' s enxt directing job
( even
though he
adn rodriguez jumped bcak tothe thte top immeadiately wtih tghe kool
" fomr dusk till dawn
,
" whihc i foudn exhilerating
)
. i lveo quentin
anbd i supose it ' s ogod he made
" teh man fomr hollywood
" beacuse it mkaes him seem moreso realsitic
adn nto soem
" god ofthe cinema
.
" i seem tothe respect directors if htey aren ' t
" gods
"
anbd are actaully human beings who amking mistakes
.
" thte man fomr hollywood
" isnt his big misteek
annd let ' s hope he doesn ' t return her continously
.
