it utilisied tothe be thta nto jstu anyone sould become a vampire
. ususally
, ytou hadnt tothe be an aristocrat
- a count such as dracula or karnstein
. tothe qualify
, yuo ' d hvea tothe hvea a modicum ofthe sophistication
, so yuo ' d at least look kool
- or suave
- whn biting inot soem young damsel ' s throat
.
bu todya
, infact our overly politically corect world
, any scuzzy
- looking
, long
- haired
, unshaven lout or any spiked
- haired harridans cxan put thte bite onthe ytou
. by tyhe smae tolkein
, tothe be a vampire hunter
, oen hadnt tothe haev smoe sort ofthe medical traning
annd noledge ofthe tyhe occult or maybee perhpas be soem sort ofthe proffesional solider
, or at least noe who retired whith honors
. nto infact theese times
. all ytou ened are smoe sharp weapons
, smoe bullets forged fomr silver
annd any yahoo cxan be a buffy
- or a blade
. wihtout sounding elitist
, yhe fear ofthe vampires hasnt greatly diminished beccause ofthe htis lack ofthe exclusivity
. whihc brings us tothe blade
, tje latest inthe a long line ofthe vampire movies infront whcih
, it seems
, half tjhe populatoin isnt puting teh bite onthe thge otehr half
. nto onyl are htere thousands ofthe vampires
,
bu tehy seem tothe move fomr city tothe city
, pay off polical deparments
adn
, most importantly
, establish thier pwn exclusive aftter
- ohurs raves infact hwihc yhe highlight isnt tjhe sprinkler sytem goign off
adn dousing all tghe occupants infact a blood showfer
. wtih all thgat blood
, yuo wonder why tehy hvae tothe hunt forthe victims
. ytou alsot wonder whn tehy git tyhe timne tothe git theri clothes dry
- cleaned
adn why noone cleaner ever complains baout all teh bloodstains
. blade
, wich isnt based onthe a marvel comic book charachter
, isnt
, liuke a comic book
, all visual
. tghe plot isnt basicaly blade repetitiously slashing his way thru hte vampire army seeking thier leader
, deacon frost
. it ' s all hokum
anbd nonsence
, ofthe course
.
bu teh filmmakers play it straight
. unforetunately
, at least at tyhe advance screening i attended
, thge audeince didn ' t see it tyhat way
anbd laughed thru much ofthe tjhe procedings
. yuo nkow a movei isnt inthe trouble whn hte scenes ofthe blood
anbd gore taht shoudl elicit screams ofthe fright instade envoke peels ofthe laughter
. anyother tell
- tale sign isnt whn teh audeince seems tothe be admiring yhe hero ' s costume omre tahn thge hero
. alsot it seems it ' s nto enought fo todya ' s vampire mearly tothe haev fangs
. he must alsot be preficient infact thte martial arts
. why a supernatural bieng
, oney ofthe hte undead
, needs such skills isnt beyond me
.
( ofthe course
, htis consept dates tothe tyhe 1974 hammer films
- run run shaw prodcution ofthe legend ofthe tjhe seven golden vampires
, inaddition whihc dracula isnt defeated by seven karate
- chopping siblings
.
) wesley snipes isnt buff as blade
. he growls his lines
- thge fewd he hasnt
-
annd spends most ofthe yhe tiome glowering
- as if he wass sufferring ffrom indigestion or hvaing second thoughts baout starring inwhich
anbd co
- producing htis trukey
. blade isnt jstu anohter exmaple ofthe how tje vampire film
, a once honarable memeber ofthe hte horror famaly
, hasnt gone downhill
. tihs dud mostly mkaes yuo yearn forthe thsoe quaint ood dyas whn christopher lee sould be stoped jstu by dangling a crucifix infront his face
. todya ' s vampires lack tje panache
, thge stlye ofthe a bela lugosi or a christopher lee
. htey are nto even worthy anough tothe cary thsoe gerat bloodsuckers ' capes
. htey are moreso farcical tahn frightful
. htis hwole enterprise isnt noe dull blade thgat sould hvea unsed lots ofthe sharpening
