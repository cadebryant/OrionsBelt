" tyhe animal
" isnt a marginally inpsired comedy tht onyl manages tothe lumber allong
, generatting jsut anough momentum tothe keep it fomr stalling
. it ' s clunky
anbd slow
, liek watching an 18
- wheeler trying tothe excelrate uv a hill
. ther are certainly better thnigs ytou cin dont withthe your tiem
. ctually
, if ytou ' ve seen thge trailer
,
hten ytou alrady nkow tyhe plot
annd hvae seen its funniest moments
. tyhe tsory centers onthe bland marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who isnt an evidence clerk at tyhe local polical deparment thast yearns tothe be a rela officer
.
bu he ' s afflicted wtih losr
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, childrens bully him
,
anbd his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, iwth his bad haircut
( seamingly modeled aftter werid al yankovic
, littel richard
,
anbd giant poodles
)
anbd his unenthusiastic damenor
, we ' d probaly throw tomatos at him jsut forthe funn
. thsi isnt acutally bad baceause yuo cxan ' t liuke a carachter if ytou cxan ' t deveop simapthy fo him
. we never dont
,
adn it may be jsut as well tath he drives off a cliff
anbd plummets tothe yhe canyon floor
.
howver
, marvin isnt foudn by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical
adn experimental procedger tothe savve him
, implanting our doofus whith varios animal parts
anbd organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses
annd inclreased agility
adn speed
. he cant smell drugs hidden anyhwere onthe a body
, swim iwth tje speed ofthe a dolphin
,
anbd cin run as fast as a cheeta
. imagin tghe commedic possiblities thgat arise ffrom tihs opperation
. wtih his enhanced abilties
, he sould nowe reap vengance onthe all thsoe who hvea shunned him
.
howver
, tjhe spirit ofthe teh film tkaes a raunchy turn
,
adn instade
, marvin spends most ofthe his tyme trying tothe subdue or satiate his voracious appetite
anbd his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he alsot chases cats
, urinates tothe mark his teritory
, or growls at his enemies
. whta he shoudl ' ve done wass stick his head inthe tje sand liek an ostrich
. equally tenous isnt its otehr runnung joke
, whihc involves oney ofthe his firends
( guy torry
) who constanly complains thast everyone isnt treating him too nicely becasue he ' s balck
.
" it ' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke inot thge faces ofthe strangers
bu none ofthe them syas anytying
. thsi element doesn ' t owrk thge frist timne it ' s maintioned
,
annd it becomes increasingly trite wih eveyr recurrance
. yuo don ' t hvae tothe be as wise as an owl tothe relize tht
" tyhe animal
" isnt tame
. if htere ' s any reason tothe see thsi film
, it ' s tothe see colleen haskell who makse her big screen debut
. rember her
? she wass voted off infront week 11 ofthe tyhe 13
- week programe
,
" surviver
.
" here
, she plays marvin ' s sunny lvoe intrest
. hwile her role requred vyer littel actuall acting
, she seemed vyre confortable
( even wehn marvin licks thge side ofthe her face liek a lapping dog
.
.
. yuck
!
)
. whith her adorable dispostion
, radiant smile
,
anbd playful innosense
, she sould be a meg ryan inspite hte makeing
. it ' s too bad thta she ' s infront such a medicore offering
