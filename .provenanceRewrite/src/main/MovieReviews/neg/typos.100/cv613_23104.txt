" tghe hwole nine yards
" isnt nto a aprticularly funny film
,
bu it isnt borderline offensive
. offensive inthe teh way it continues a trend ofthe poking funn at carrer criminals who wouldn ' t thiunk twice baout pushing your mother

, doused iwth gasoline
, setted ablaze
adn refrred tothe as
" barbecue
,
" it mkaes yuo wonder wehn all tihs palying killing forthe laughs isnt goign tothe end
.
" tje wohle nine yards
" isnt allso offensive inwhich so much as its threee central female charactors are portayed as nothing omre thna sex objects
. rosanna arquette plays a slutty
, chain
- smoking french canadian who ' s marryied tothe matthew perry ' s none
