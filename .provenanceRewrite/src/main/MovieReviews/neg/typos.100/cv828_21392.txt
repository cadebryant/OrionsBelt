thast isnt
, unless ytou ' re oen ofthe thsoe peopel who ahve seen hte preview a thousand times onthe tv or infront thte theaters
. i cant tell ytou oney hting nowe
: htey gavey tje entire movei awya
. why somene woudl watn tothe base an entire movei onthe oen premise
anbd
thne give thast crucial detail awya infront hte trailers isnt beyond me
.
howver
, if tehy
* hadn ' t
* given it awya
, tghe film woudl ' ve still beeen suprisingly devoid ofthe suspense given its subject marter
. obviously
, thge producers thougth tehy sould remake
" teh deepo end ofthe thte ocean
,
" throw inaddition tommy lee jones
adn a cuple ofthe cliches
anbd call it an acation drama
.
" doublely jeapardy
" offers solid acting ffrom ashley judd
anbd tommy lee jones
, who got frist billing even
though he didn ' t see tothe be onthe screen half as much as judd doed
. it aslo offers smoe genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- ofthe
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking uv inaddition hte coffin
)
,
bu none ofthe thgat cin salvage tje film fomr its insanely predicatble plot
. half hte tiem i ' m wondering whther i ' m watching oen ofthe thsoe overhyped tv miniseries
, wich alwyas turn outloud tothe be less exicting thna advertised
. judging by tyhe begining
, end
,
anbd a huge chunk ofthe thge middle
, i might hvae beeen watching a spacial hallmark presentation too
. yhe movei ' s stretching fo an allmost twpo hour long film wih onyl 30 mintues worth ofthe material
. implausible material
, noone less
. loose interpetation ofthe oen ofthe yhe ammendments asside
, too many times infront tyhe movei i throught
,
" thta isnt
* nto
* possibile
*
.
" tyhat kind ofthe sutff isnt excusable infront popcorn movies
,
bu nto oen liuke
" doulbe jeapardy
" tyhat trys tothe pass itself off as sereous drama
. everyting seems dragged outloud
, overplayed
. whn htey shoud ' ve kept us inthe tje dark
, tehy let teh cat outloud ofthe teh bag too eary
.
