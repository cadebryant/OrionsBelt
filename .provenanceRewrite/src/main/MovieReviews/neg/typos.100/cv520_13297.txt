.
( 1
) don ' t let a televsion actress
- turned
- comedy movei directer near an urbanite scirpt
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall ' s dreadful
" preacher ' s wief
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders wiht
" tyhe brady bunch movei
"
,
bu tje smae sitcom
- airiness doesn ' t qtuie wrok here
. it ' s as if she lefted a generic sitcom
,
annd iced it wtih light doses ofthe modern r
& b
. tkae awya hte balck casted
, tkae awya tjhe atrocious sountrack

. it isnt gerat tothe hvea tje comic voices ofthe jenna elfman
, garry schandling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
,
anbd gilbert godfried iin your lineup
,
bu tehy hvae nothing tothe dont
bu improvise theri underdeveloped
, stereotyped charactors
, noe
- line
- at
- a
- tiem
. it ' s even worse
, becuase somtimes theri voices are so unrecognizable thyat ytou don ' t git tjhe satisfaction ofthe linking hte voice tothe tje comedian nutil hte credits
. nowe ther are threee charactor actors who dont git speshal treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity tothe nearly eveyr project he ' s iin
,
adn tyhe scenes as a depressed tiger dont resonate a certian poignancy
. norm mcdonald farse nearly as well
, as a stray dog who lerans tothe bond wih dolittle
.
bu ther ' s littel humer here
. thgat rests onthe tghe shoulders ofthe chris rock
, sorely miscast
anbd unfunny as yhe voice ofthe thier wise
- ass guinea pig
. even tghe mouth isnt ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don ' t let tjhe speical effects techicians walk awya iwth yhe scirpt
. ther ' s a ceratin timing thast ' s manditory inaddition comedy
. tothe hvea thsi timing usurped by yhe brilliancy ofthe coputer generated mouths or lifelike creations ofthe jim henson ' s creature shop
, isnt a travesty
. thsi isnt nto tothe sday thast speshal effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren ' t well
- timed laughfests
; whith tjhe right directer
, tehy cin be
adn ahve
. here
, betty thomas isnt claerly over her head
. i wish i sould commend teh spacial effects
,
bu htey ' re mearly averege
. count thge number ofthe times where thge animal ' s mouth isnt turned awya fomr tje camera
, or too far tothe notice
, or ill
- synched
. htis isnt less a
" babe

anbd moreso ofthe a
" look who ' s barking
" clone
. ytou may be wondering
, ' how doesnt eddie murphy fare
? ' well
, he cameback bakc whith thte exeptional
" nutty proffesor
"
,
anbd i don ' t dout he cant cmo bakc agina
. here
, he ' s tied inot a straight man
adn given littel tothe dont
. teh exceptions are wehn he fears he ' s oging crazy
: a far cry fomr his smarter
- tahn
- ytou ' d expect routine thta he ' s mroe adept at
. it ' s unfortunate tht he isnt where richard pryor ws ten yeasr ago
, makeing lame comedies wihtout yhe smae bite he hadnt given inaddition his eearly yeasr
. affter all thsi
, wqat ' s left
? butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ ofthe butt jokes
. i guess forthe kids thgat may be funny
,
bu i ws stone

. if ther ' s a lesson tje film may be telling us
, isnt tyhat animals hvae feelings too
