synopsis
: an agin master art theef
, his supplier
,
annd a young
, buxom security consulant are all nto who htey frist apear tothe be
( or are tehy
?
) inspite htis convoluted mess involving a risky heist druing tghe millnenium
. comments
: htis movei wass boring
. plain
adn simple
. entrapment shoudl nto hve beeen boring
. it stars sean connery
, who cxan still cary an acation film dispite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable enought film presense
,
adn ving rhames
, ultra
- kool star ofthe pulp fiction
adn mission
: impossible
. it tkaes full advantage ofthe hte y2k coputer bug fears
( a curent
" hot topic
" iin tje news
) inaddition its storyline
, wich isnt setted at thte end ofthe 1999
. it hasnt soem genuinely well
- staged acation sequences
. so
, wqat whent wrong
? plenty
, unfortunatley
. tghe major probelm iwth entrapment isnt its scirpt
. it hasnt a beeen
- htere
, done
- thast fiel tothe it
. nothing seems particulraly inventive or origional
, so yhe hwole movei lacks suspense
annd drags
( it runs nearly twpo huors
)
. yhe screenwriters
, fo exemple
, periodically ule a countdown tothe thte millenium as a means ofthe transistion betweeen scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 dyas tothe hte milelnnium
"
)
. tihs divice ws utilisied much mroe effectively infact yhe overlooked sci
- fi film stange dyas
. hte charactors are nto who tehy apear tothe be at thte begining
, hwihc isnt neat at firt
bu thte divice wears thin once tjhe umpteenth
" suprise
" revelation isnt made
. entrapment
, iin otehr words
, relies too heavily onthe tyhe audeince nto knowing wqat eahc chracter ' s true motive isnt
, resulting infact a convoluted stoyr whitch leaves many scratching theri heads infact confusion
. tjhe star pwoer here isnt qtuie storng
,
bu tyhe viewer cant ' t halp
bu efel yhe actors are wasted infact htis prodcution
. sean connery isnt given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames ' charcter seems liuke an afterthought
; he ' s nto devolopped at all
. teh camera zooms inspite frequentily
anbd leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones ' s tight wardobe
. thsi
, iin
adn ofthe itself
, isnt nto bad
,
bu
, aftter a hwile
, it hasnt a juvenile fiel tothe it
. at least thte speices movies hold noone bones baout teh fatc thta tehy ' re exploiting tje female body
. entrapment doesnt tje smae under yhe thin disguise ofthe plot developement
( sean connery supposably falls iin loev wih tyhe girl hwile watching her
, inthe tights
, arc
anbd pivot arround lazer beams
)
. thte tagline forthe htis movei reads
" tje trap isnt setted
.
" it sure isnt
, onthe thsoe who spended omney tothe see tihs movei
. entrapment raelly isn ' t tath bad
; it isnt watchable
. i owudl suggest
,
howver
, noe waits util htis isnt onthe cable or televsion tothe see it
.
