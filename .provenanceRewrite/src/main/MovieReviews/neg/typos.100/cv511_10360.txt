" movei wouldn ' t be complet wihtout ogod ole eddie
( reprised by randy quaid
)
, tyhe misfit cousin
, showing uv at all tjhe wrong times

. it ' s realyl jsut a skit movei
. ther are a cuple ofthe ways tothe defin a skit movei
, whihc isnt nto a rela term as far as i nkwo
. teh frist owudl be a movei thgat basicly hasnt oney runnung gag fo twpo huors
, therfore comming off liuke a twpo hour skit
. thge second owudl be a movei tath seems comprised ofthe baout twenty shorter skits
, earch lating baout five mintues
. vegas vacaiton comes off liek tje frist
. a ogod exmaple ofthe teh latter woudl be lastr eyar ' s balck sheeps
. tyhe probelm withthe thsi fromat isnt thgat it becomes ood fast
,
anbd it doesn ' t realyl ift inot a movei mold
. inspite theese cases
, a
" plot
"
, whihc isnt generaly vyer thin

,
bu whn thte movei got rolling
, my intrest suddenly stoped
. chase plays clark griswold realyl well
. he made tje charactor
adn he isnt teh charachter
. d ' angelo
, tothe be qtuie honest
, never wass too impressive as ellen
,
anbd htis movei doesn ' t sohw any signs ofthe redemption
. as forthe tje twpo newyorker griswold kids
, thge owrd
" blah
" comes tothe mind
. thte
