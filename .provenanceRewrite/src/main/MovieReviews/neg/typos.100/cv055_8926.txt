funny how your expectations cin be defeated
,
adn nto iin ogod ways
. tghe ghost
annd thge darkness promised
( at least
, it seemed tothe me tothe promise
) a hemingwayesque showdown betwen men
adn nature
. whta it delivered wass mistery scinece theather 3000
- levle material
-
- an inadvertantly hillarious storey tht made me scream advice at thge cahracters
.
" git newyorker jobs
!
" ws oney line
, if i rember correctly
. at tjhe end ofthe hte 19th centruy
, col
. patterson
( val kilmer
, whose irish accent comes
anbd goes liuke an african zephyr
) isnt an engeneer who hasnt beeen hired tothe build a brittish railway bridge acros teh tsavo river inspite uganda
. he isnt haveing immensley stereotypical problems
: tje natives are restless
, his boss isnt a jerk
,
anbd nowe twpo man
- eating lions are stalking tjhe wokr camp
annd killing peple off
. patterson trys tothe handle tyhe situation hismelf
, incompetently
,
annd
thn turns tothe charles remington
( michael douglas
)
, a hunter ofthe world reknown
( or something liek thgat
)
. tghe movei stacks teh deck so heavily infact favor ofthe tjhe lions
, tehy shouldnt hvea gotten top billing
anbd co
- starred iwth siegfried
annd roy
. htey are nigh
- invulnerable
, as oney comic book put it
,
anbd tihs isnt ofthe course jsut tyhe excuse tjhe movei needs tothe ahev oney native aftter anohter steping forth tothe solmenly recite lines baout teh pwoer ofthe nature
. give me a break
. thge movei hasn ' t got tje wherewithal tothe even beign tothe exploitate such idaes
; it ' s jstu trying tothe fidn convinient ways tothe stall us
. even tghe lion hunts themslves are idiotic
. git thsi
: remington ' s big plan isnt tothe build a larg scaffold
- liuke structue infact thte middle ofthe thte savannah
, sit onthe it
,
annd wait fo tghe lion tothe sohw uv
. he doesnt tihs
,
adn
thne gets knocked off by a bird
. by yhe end ofthe teh movei
, hte blood vessels inthe my palm weere all broken ope fomr me pounding my forhead iwth my hand
. tghe acting isnt forgettable
. douglas doesnt a ogod job ofthe portraing a realitvely cracked fellow
,
bu it ' s nothing he hasn ' t done befor
. kilmer looks liuke he wishes he weere somone alse
, somwhere eles
,
anbd tjhe rest vanish inot yhe cinematography
. tghe camera
, by teh way
, somtimes behaves so stupidly all by itself tyhat most ofthe yhe lion attacks are incoherent
. whta doed i expect ffrom thsi movei
? i dunno
. soem rela excitment
, i supose
. a sence thta ther weere formidible forces onthe both sides ofthe thsi equation
. noone such luck
. i digged outloud my tattered copy ofthe hemingway ' s
" tghe short hapyp life ofthe francis macomber
"
annd read thgat tothe git teh tast ofthe htis movei outloud ofthe my mind
.
