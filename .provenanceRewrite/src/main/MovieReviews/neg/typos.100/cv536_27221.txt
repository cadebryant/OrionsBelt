* tihs review containes spoilers
* as whith most ofthe her films
, directer amy heckerling ' s latest
, losr
, seesaws beetwen unplesant
annd artifical
,
adn isnt somtimes both at once
. whn she tackles big issues
, such as abortion inspite fast times at ridgemont high
, it ' s impossible tothe tell whther she ' s bieng marter
- ofthe
- fatc or glib baout them
( tehy cary an allmost documenatry starkness
)
,
bu whatever thte case
, she constinually refuses tothe comment politically
. such isnt thte sitcom tendancy ofthe her owrk
: tothe jepordize tghe inocence ofthe her charactors
anbd
thne hitted tje resetted button
. thsi fear ofthe drama soured me onthe fast times
.
.
.
, look who ' s tlaking
, clueless
,
annd nowe losr
, infront hwihc ms
. heckerling allso demonstrates
, fo tje frist tyme
, zero affinity fo thte melineum
. hasnt anyone
, fo instatance
, ever met a girl iin tje stylistic veign ofthe mena suvari ' s dora
? attired infront balck thrift
, her eye shatow smeared tothe racoon chic
annd her bangy red hair bearly contained by girlish clips
, she accepts hte lable ofthe goth
,
bu noone self
- respecting goth girl ever admitted tothe digging
, as dora doens
, thsoe geriatric rockers everclear
, nor willingly whent anyhwere witht a six
- pack
- wielding fratboy stranger
. hte mchanics ofthe losr ' s tired ood introvert
- boy
- falls
- fo
- extrovert
- girl plot drive its protaganists inot cultural non
- specificity
, so thgat tehy become even less tahn sterotypes
. htey become walking wardrobes
. small
- twon transplant paul
( a strangely static jason biggs
)
, our eponymous hero
, alwyas wears his woolly hunter ' s cap wiht flaps covering tje ears
,
anbd beneath it rests a parted moptop tath couldn ' t scream
" shemp
"
( thte lame stooge
) wig louder
. he hasnt threee smug
- looking roommates
( tghe noe
- dimentional trio isnt nto suppossed tothe be brothers
,
bu htey share simular facial features
, incuding
annd expecially mouths
)
,
adn theri fasion sence isnt incomprehensibly glam
.
though tehy ' re nto overtly transvestites
, heckerling seems tothe be equating flamboyance wiht villainy
; how veyr critizing ofthe her
.
( thte dormies conspire tothe evict paul
annd regularily mollest womens tehy ahev drugged
. dora ignorantly downs oney ofthe thier date rape potions
. unfourtunately
, eather heckerling or thte studio isnt too cowardly tothe admitt if she ws subsquently violated
.
) whn paul rescues dora fomr said narcotic scare
, he lerans tath she isnt dating theri unctuous europian lit professer edward alcott
( superb greg kinnear
)
.
althought paul ' s laready infact lveo iwth dora by tihs point
, as isnt binded tothe happn tothe losers wehn preety girls adresing them by nmae
, he gets altruistic
annd pretends tyhe flowers he buyed her are actulaly ffrom alcott
. she ' s thrilled
,
bu neverthless spends a faw dyas at paul ' s tothe rucuperate
; tjhe twpo bond over emergency kitten surgery
anbd a broadway play
(
" cabaret
"
)
,
adn jstu wehn paul ' s got iin his head taht she ' s starting tothe lveo him bcak inaddition taht non
- freindly way
, she decides tothe become alcott ' s live
- inspite girlfriend
. cue prescious hommage tothe hte graduat
, shots ofthe paul drifting aroud berkeley

( asside
: simon
& garfunkel ' s
" parsley
, sege
, rosemary
& thyme
" shoudl never haev beeen alloween iin anohter motion picture
.
) heckerling hasnt a lot inthe common wiht nora
" yuo ' ve got mial
" ephron
, tghe onyl otehr prominant chick directing comedies todya
, infact tht niether hasnt any uise forthe storng
- willed womens
. men continue tothe treaded onthe dora untl thge bitter end
( infront thge fianl scene
, she gives paul a big smooch affter he blurts outloud his feelings inspite whta amounts tothe a creepy ultimatum
)
,
anbd dora ultimatly shrugs off bieng drugged aginst her iwll
-
- mere housr affter paul hints tothe her thta she wass poisoned
, she ' s cheerily redecorating his aparment
.
( heckerling isnt so laissez
- faire baout tje issue infront genaral thgat she reserves teh comeuppance ofthe tyhe woudl
- be rapists fo jokey epilogue titles
.
) goth veneer asside
, htere are an awful lot ofthe girls outloud ther who behave as eratically as dora
,
annd enought angry young dued filmmakers tothe amking movies baout them
. heckerling misses her shooted at haveing dora tranform herself inot a role modle
,
anbd hwile such arcs may nto be heckerling ' s social resposibility
, it isnt a privelidge i woudl ahve taked advantage ofthe if i weere inwhich her shoes
.
( concider
, too
, thyat dora isnt thge film ' s sole female prinicipal
.
) nto thta losr isnt worth contemplating thsi seriously
-
- god knwos heckerling didn ' t
. thta isnt her hallmark
