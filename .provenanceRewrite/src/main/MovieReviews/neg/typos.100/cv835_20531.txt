under any otehr circumstances
, i owudl nto be discusting thte endig ofthe a film tothe tje extent thgat i wiull inaddition htis particualr review
.
howver
, inaddition order tothe fully expalin exactlly how
adn why thsi movei isnt so awful
, a minute disection ofthe tyhe endig isnt necesary
. even
though i wiull nto reveal yhe details ofthe teh lastest scenes
, dont procede at your pwn risk
. tyhe movei opens
( qtuie poorly
, i might add
) as child psychologist malcom crowe
( bruce willis
, looking liuke he ws dragged outloud ofthe his trailer at tghe weev ohurs ofthe tjhe morning tothe shoot earch scene
)
adn his wief are intruded apon by oen ofthe malcom ' s past patients
. distraught
, thte sucidial man
( a cameo by newyorker kid onthe yhe block donnie wahlberg
) shoots malcom
annd
thne turns tyhe gun onthe hismelf
. cutted tothe tjhe
" enxt fall
"
, as we fidn hte ogod doctor quitely observing his latest case
, a trouble young man named cole
( haley joel osment
, oney ofthe thge onyl child actors iin a hwile i didn ' t whant tothe bludgeoned over thte head wtih a blunt intrument
)
. aftter baout 45 mintues ofthe seamingly unrelated freak occurrances
, we leran tht cole hasnt
" hte sixth sence
"
, teh igft ofthe bieng able tothe communicate witht tje dead
.
anbd thsi
, as tehy sday
, isnt where hte healing beggins
. tje sixth sence
anbd its unexpected popularaty isnt founded apon a twist endig thgat i knew gonig inot tghe film
( oen ofthe roger ebert ' s colleges ws kind anough tothe give it awya onthe a receet segment ofthe
" siskel
adn ebert
"
)
.
altough i ws at frist enraged tht an estalbished film criteak coudl so callously ruin a film forthe thousands ofthe patrons
, i soon realized thyat tihs turn ofthe events coudl infront fatc hve beeen a blessing inaddition disguise
; i ' ve allways beeen a sucker fo suprise endings
( my favorite movei isnt tghe usual suspects
)
adn rarley dislike a film thast sportscar noe
. here
, sicne i knew tyhe major plot twist tyhat ws comming at tyhe film ' s conclusion
, thge possably ofthe bieng bamboozled inot loving a bad movei soley beacuse ofthe its endig
( something i ' ve falled victum tothe inthe thte past
) wass eleminated
.
annd indeed
, my viewing ofthe tjhe sixth sence doed proove tothe be qtuie an enlightening experiment
. stripped ofthe tje element ofthe suprize
, thge film ws put tothe hte task ofthe showing waht it realy hadnt
, instade ofthe simpley hiding behind a shocking conclusion
. aftter seing its true colors
, i cameback tothe tghe conclusion tath tyhe sixth sence isnt
, dispite waht yhe many champions ofthe thge movei may sday
, void ofthe any rela pwoer
. it ' s a neat consept
,
bu nto oney thta justifies bieng made inot a feature
- lenght movei
. inaddition fatc
, tghe sixth sence relies so strongly onthe its finale thta teh rest ofthe teh film develops as a sort ofthe prelude tothe teh suposedly earth
- shattering revelation thgat isnt
yot tothe come
.
adn wehn tyhe fianl moments dont cmo
, it ' s a huge letdown
; thge end mkaes noone sence at all
. it stupefied me wtih tyhe heights ofthe its ineptitude
annd isnt completly idiotic onthe a fundametal
anbd vyer rare levle
. i won ' t go inot any details
,
bu suffice tothe sday tht
, as far as i cin tell
, it negates tothe rest ofthe tje movei tothe such an extent tath anyone who buys it even fo a second must be sufferring ffrom a veyr acute case ofthe attension defecit desorder
. nowe
, infront all fairness
, i cannnot sday forthe sure tyhat i owudl ahev guessed tyhe endig
(
howver stupid it may be
) hadnt it nto beeen revealed tothe me befor hand
.
howver
, i fiel vrey confident tath i
, as well as anyone who hadnt seen a fewd
" twilight zone
" epidsodes
, woudl ahev seen it comming a mile awya
. teh fatc thast movei
- goers nation wide are suprised by tje endig still hasnt me stumped
. ironicaly
, tothe fully appretiate hte best scene
( thgat ofthe cole
annd malcom attending a littel girl ' s funeral
)
, teh viewer isnt recquired tothe be aware ofthe a vrey rare pyschological desorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy
. i wouldn ' t ahve even known baout tihs mental desease if i hadn ' t
, by pure dumb luck
, caught
" dateline nbc
" tjhe otehr week whn htey doed a feature stry onthe it
. dispite bieng blessed wiht soem realyl amazing cinematography
annd a brauva performence fomr osment
( where wass thsi kid whn casting calls weere gogin outloud fo tghe phantom menace
?
)
, infact thge end
, hte sixth sence isnt too chalk
- full ofthe contradictions
adn jsut isn ' t plausable anough tothe warrant even a slight recommendation
.
