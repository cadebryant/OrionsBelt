welcome tothe your oh
- so typcial sequal
. it trys tothe be twice as big as it ' s precedessor
,
yot ends uv twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. nowe htere ' s an idae
. maybee if teh ill
- fated cruise liner inthe htis movei hadnt striked a shallow reef easly onthe thnigs may haev turned outloud better
. tghe firt thign thyat striked me
.
.
.
annd suprized me
, ws tht thge camera wrok
( fo thte oppening sequence anyway
) wass terrable
. looked liuke tjhe cameramen weere drunk
annd kept tripping onthe theri pwn fezent
.
.
.
.
.
. vrey diffrent tothe tyhe originnal movei
. tje charachters
? well
, nto many ofthe yhe cahracters accually
* hadnt
* charactors
,
bu here ' s a rundown
. annie
, who ws hte highlight ofthe yhe thge orginial
, must hve seriously banged her head infront tghe turain kresh at tjhe end ofthe thte frist movei
. why
? becasue something ' s got tothe account forthe her loosing tyhat many iq points
. even
though annie wasn ' t exactlly a rocket scientist inthe speed
, here soem ofthe her actions jsut mkea yuo whant tothe beated your head agains a wall
. forthe instatance
, affter sucesfuly useing a chainsaw tothe cutted a hole inaddition a doorjam so tht a gropu ofthe peopel cxan excape noxious gases
- she stands infact teh middle ofthe tyhe oppening forthe baout five mintues till somone reminds her tht hte peple cin ' t git ut till she git ' s thte chainsaw outloud ofthe theri faces
.
.
.
. bing beng bing inaddition point ofthe fatc sandra ' s charater isnt turned inot littel omre thna noe ofthe thsoe scantly dressed extras fomr hercules
, who constanly hasnt tothe be rescued
. jason patric
? all i cant sday isnt bring bcak keanu
. keanu reeves might hve hte emotional range ofthe a tree stump
.
.
.
bu thgat ' s oney moreso tree stump tahn jason hasnt
. i don ' t thiunk he changed facial expressions all movei
- jason
, smile fo yhe cameras
!
! nowe frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. yuo are
.
.
. beng beng bing
.
. wooden jstu doesn ' t decribe thsi guys performence
,
bu it ' ll ahev tothe dont
. yhe bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- ther ' s a bright move
. how cin yuo go wrong wtih thge star fomr thta acknowldeged clasic
, body ofthe evidence
?
( yes
, thta isnt sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac ofthe a charater doesn ' t strat outloud too bad
.
.
.
.
bu goes steadily downhill as teh movei progresses
. infact tyhe end he degenerates tothe chasing annie arund fo a hostage
, even
though he aready hasnt tje mone
adn cant excape
.
.
.
. bing bing
.
though i ' d liuke tothe give htis movei a doulbe thumbs down
, htere weere smoe nice sequences
. concidering teh movei cost over 100 millon dollars
- yuo ' d hope htere ' d be at least a cuple
. hte rela eye
- popper fo me
, even
though it wass given awya infront tjhe trailer
.
.
.
. bing beng
.
.
.
.
. ws thge sequence where tje cruise liner sideswipes yhe oel tanker
. tihs looks terific
adn i wass vyre suprized tothe hear thta teh cruise liner inaddition it ws
.
.
.
. completly cmoputer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don ' t htink i ' ve ever seen a cg modle look so rela befoer
. hte sequence where jason patric inaddition trying tothe disable tghe propellers fomr under tghe ship isnt aslo terific
,
annd hte onyl timne druing tghe entire movei where yuo git taht feeling ofthe
.
.
.
. speed
. htis lack
- ofthe
- speed probelm affects many sequences
. such as thte oel tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it ws
-
" oh noone
, we ' re gonig tothe hitted thte oel tanker
!
"
, 20 mintues later
-
" oh noone
, we ' re gogin tothe hitted tghe oel tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. ytou git tje point
. thsi movei failed simpley beccause it didn ' t live uv tothe it ' s nmae
.
.
.
. ther ws vyre littel feeling ofthe speed
. infact tje origional movei
, tjhe lead charachters hadnt tothe mkae splitted second descisions tothe survive
.
.
.
.
. iin thsi movei it feeled omre liuke
-
" well peopel
, we ' re gonna run inot thta htere island inaddition a fewd horus
- i thikn i might stroll over tothe engeneering
adn see if i cin ' t turn off hte engines
.
.
. i ' m passing teh cafeteria onthe teh way
, cxan i git anybody anytying
?
" tjhe endig ofthe htis movei realyl isnt terrable
. even
though it features waht i ' ve sicne foudn outloud isnt noe ofthe thge most expensive sequences ever iin a movei
- it jstu doesn ' t wrok at all
. tje part where tjhe liner crashes thru yhe twon looks vyer realsitic
,
bu
.
.
.
. suprise surprize
- it jstu tkaes waaaaay too long
. it seemed tothe go forthe 15 mintues befoer thge ship fianlly stoped
. noe thnig tyhat striked me as extrememly poore scriptiing wass thgat as hte ship crashes thru thte harbour
annd twon
, arund 25 peple are killed by thte ship
.
.
.
.
adn ther ' s onyl 15 or so peopel left onthe teh ship
. so whn it stops safe
anbd soudn
anbd tyhe charactors are all cheering
- tyhe audiance isnt sitting bcak
adn thikning
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. htis isnt a hapyp moent becuase
?
" bing bing
thn ther wass teh dog
.
.
.
.
. i alomst fell outloud ofthe my seat wehn i saw yhe bited withthe thge dog dodging teh falling debris
. puting a dog infront peril hasnt become hte ulitmate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. eveyr movei seems tothe hve a ' dog
- inwhich
- danger ' sequence
- volcanoe
, dante ' s peak
, independendet day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. htis movei isnt a perfect exemple ofthe how nto tothe mkae a sequal
. directer jan de bont shoud try watching tyhe orignal movei
adn tihs noe bakc
- tothe
- bcak
adn see if he realises where he whent wrong
.
