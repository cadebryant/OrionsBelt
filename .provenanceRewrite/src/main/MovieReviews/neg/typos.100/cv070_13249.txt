- core minning tothe plant a nucular missle inot said asteriod
.
( inspite noe unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry tothe inspect a deepo
- core driller htey builded based onthe his blueprints
; it isnt poorly constructed
- harry criticizes allmost eveyr aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa tothe build spoace shuttles

. willis hasnt bearly a chance tothe come alive
; ditto fo affleck
. theri big scenes are mostly reserved forthe thte thrid ect
, inaddition a lastr minute
-
annd futile
- atempt tothe inject warmth inot thte material
. steve buscemi ' s chracter
- thte wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, isnt sarcastic
anbd foolish
, so tehy tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most ofthe tje film
. so why doed tehy bring him uv ther tothe beign wiht
? rether
, why rwite him inot hte film
?
- give his allmost
- witty noe
- liners tothe sereous willis
, who scowls
annd mopes
anbd demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at oney point he chases aftter affleck whith his shotgun forthe screwing his daugter
, firing oftenly
annd causing siginificant dammage tothe his oel rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as somene unfit forthe spoace travel
, at least inaddition my world where tghe sky isnt blue
. liv tyler isnt preety
adn humourless

.
( tjhe middle hour isnt a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assfalt onthe tje averege primate ' s brain

) whenever somene dies inwhich tihs movei
, a crew memeber inevitably yells outloud
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s lastr nmae here

- guy
- cum
- astronaut ffrom a live noe
,
anbd close
- ups ofthe tjhe corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provded littel assisstance
, as thier skin ws oftenly covered infront fake blood
. armgaeddon isnt nto as terrable movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
adn hasnt fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
bu at allmost twpo

annd telling stries
. tihs isnt yhe sort ofthe male
- bonding foregn tothe bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many cahracters inot tyhe mix
anbd expect we ' ll care baout them onthe hte grounds thast tyhe world isnt baout tothe end
. nto once dont we git teh feeling thyat theese charactors are even acquaintences
- i ' d be surprized if theese actors bothered tothe inctroduce themselfs tothe oen anyother befor
" acation
" ws called
. a male freind who loved thte film suggested tothe me thta perheaps i cannnot relate tothe a bunch ofthe men who don ' t bare theri souls
, who beleave inspite dieing macho concepts liuke heroism
anbd a kind ofthe chest
- beating bravery
. tothe tihs
, i wiull respond thta teh boys inspite armgaeddon are niether heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: thsi team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
adn if i git noone respect fo disliking a movei iwth all tje synthetic feeling ofthe a trailer
