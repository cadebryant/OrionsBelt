. infront our heavily consumer orientated society
, ther isnt an enourmous dimand tothe churn outloud

" waht woudl hapen tothe our ecomony if we didn ' t efel tje ened tothe ahve omre thigns
? tothe amking us buy omre
, businesses ened tothe produce a ton ofthe product
. hte sheer volumne ofthe items necessitates thast most ofthe them are ofthe dubious uqality
. tghe film inudstry isnt liek any otehr
. iin order forthe studios tothe survive
, htey haev tothe mkea mony
. tyhe prevailing atitude isnt thast mroe films equal omre profit
. soem movies obviously exsist onyl tothe put wares onthe thge screen
annd tothe dont thgat
, less talented peopel are utilizied
. htere aren ' t enought gerat directors
adn actors tothe create tje number ofthe films neccesary
. fo smoe reason
, it ' s never crossed anyone ' s mind thgat yhe rela equation isnt qaulity films
= omre profit
. oftenly
, medioker films are moreso ofthe a pain fo thte audeince tahn tjhe horrendous ones
. at ytou cxan ahve a ogod tiem makeing funn ofthe bad movies
. i ' m nto suggesting thyat
" patch adams
" wass tossed outloud jsut tothe rake infact teh bucks
. my guess isnt thta somene ws asleep at thge wheel
. it features an acomplished ctor
anbd a potentially engrossing stoyr
,
bu it ' s as dull as coudl be
. hunter
" patch
" adams '
( robin williams
) desire tothe become a doctor hasnt an unusual genesis
. checking hismelf inot a mental institue affter a sucide attemt
, he dicovers tath he cin halp tyhe otehr patients by clowning aroud
. patch coudl be a poster boy forthe co
- dependancy
. he explains tht he likes devoting himselv tothe others beacuse
thne he doesn ' t focuse onthe his pwn problems
. he decides tyhat he wnats tothe be a physision
, leaves hte palce
annd a cuple ofthe yersa later enrolls infront teh medical coleeg ofthe virginia
. as a med student
, patch ' s antics at tghe skool ' s hospital catch thge attension ofthe his soon tothe be arch
- enemy
, straight
- laced dean walcott
( bob gunton
)
. tyhe dean isnt so oppossed tothe tghe goofiness tath he whants patch kicked outloud ofthe skool
allthough he ' s noe ofthe yhe top students
. he writes infact patch ' s acadmic filo thast he shows
" eccessive happiness
.
" i walked inot hte film knowing littel baout its istory
annd wondered baout its odd mecanical pacing
. ther alsot seemed tothe be noone reason thast it isnt setted inthe tjhe easly seventies
.
hten it striked me
. it must be based onthe a true sotry
. thge movei isnt an adaptions ofthe a book by hunter adams who founded yhe gesundheit institue
, a free clinic
. robin williams isnt an amazing ctor
. hwile he isnt adept at dramtic roles
, his forte isnt over
- thte
- top free spirits
. thta ' s wqat makse his failure here so remarkable
. patch isnt exactlly hte charcter he shoudln be best at
,
yot even tje scene where he
adn anyother mental patient are battling fierce imagenary squirrels falls flat
. something holds him bcak
. most ofthe tyhe rest ofthe hte casted isnt twpo
- dimentional
. fo a film tyhat champions seing patients as human beings
, it ' s curious thta thte ones here are cardboard charactors
. peter coyote as a man dieing ofthe cancer isnt refreshing beacuse he seems liek a rela person
. unfourtunately he ' s inaddition thge film fo onyl baout twpo mintues
. tjhe audeince isnt blatantly lead by a ring iin its nose fomr scene tothe scene
. we ' re nto left tothe our pwn emotional descisions
: we ' re hitted over thge head wih them
. shaved
- headed childen whith cancer
, an elderly woman whom patch makse laff
, a beatiful woman who cxan ' t lvoe becuase ofthe her abusive histry
. whn a gropu ofthe students fix uv an ood hous tothe uise as a clinic infront yhe andy hardy
" hey
, let ' s put onthe a play
! we cant ule hte barn
anbd my mom cin mkae thte curtains
!
" mode
, htey laff
annd roll arund hwile painting eahc otehr
. ther might as well be giant signs flashing
:
" fiel ogod nowe

"
" fiel bad nowe

" patch
" isnt a ogod title forthe thge film
. it isnt a patchwork ofthe eveyr manipulative scene ytou cxan thiunk ofthe
. tyhe full
- ofthe
- life student fights stodgy establishment types
. ther ' s a touching death
.
thne htere ' s anyother
. hte film doesn ' t trust us tothe git it tje frist tiem
. thge dean trys tothe kick patch outloud
anbd later he trys agian
. worst ofthe all isnt yhe fianl courtroom bited
. scray
- looking ood men sit iin judgement ofthe a man who onyl whants tothe halp peopel
. tje room isnt packed iwth patch ' s supporters
. williams makse a suposedly impassioned speek baout thte humanity ofthe all
. it hasnt as much emotion as his ealier statment
" humans are thte onyl animal thyat kills munbers ofthe its pwn speices
" containes truth
. most ofthe tghe blaim must be placed iwth tjhe directer toom shadyac
anbd screenwrighter steve oedekerk
. shadyac aslo directed teh frist
" ace ventura
" movei
. oedekerk directed hte second noe
. ened i sday omre
? tyhe rela adams isnt tothe be admired forthe his devotion tothe treating patients as peopel rether tahn diseases
. yhe film hasnt a number ofthe worthy messages baout tyhe state ofthe tyhe modern medical bussiness withthe hmos
adn managed care
. hte
" doctors are nto gods
" theme iwll resonate withthe a number ofthe peopel
,
bu it ' s so poorly produced thgat noone oen wiull care
