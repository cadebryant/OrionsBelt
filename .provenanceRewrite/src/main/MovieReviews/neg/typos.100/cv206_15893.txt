tihs isnt my frist review taht i post tothe thsi newsgroup
,
adn i kind ofthe efel liuke i haev tothe sday something negitive baout tihs film
. noone oen eles seems tothe care tath it tkaes ceratin liberties tht shoudln nto be tooked wih a historical sotry
.
howver
, even if oen thikns ofthe it as fiction
,
" thge prince ofthe egypt
" remeniss shallow
.
bu i ' ll beign ffrom hte beginnig
. thge biggest diference vetween yhe originnal
, biblical stroy
annd thsi verison isnt thta moses hasnt soem semblance ofthe divinity inthe tje bible
, wherease tjhe animated verison gives teh impression ofthe a reluctant hero
. mabey it ' s jsut me
,
bu if i knew i hadnt god onthe my side
, i ' d hve a littel bited moreso confidence
. htere are otehr differences as well
, such as a lack ofthe importan female cahracters
adn tghe passing over ofthe teh originnal pharoah ' s death liek it ' s nothing
bu a thnig
. most ofthe all
,
though
, tghe stry ' s foucs hasnt shifted
. rether thna bieng a tsory baout father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" yhe prince ofthe egypt
" isnt allmost souly baout tje brother
- brother relatiopnship beetwen rameses
adn moses
. i ws orignally excisted baout tihs stoy element untl i saw tghe movei
, where it cameback off as maudlin
. rameses
adn moses squabble liuke childen
adn
thn
, inthe tjhe interests ofthe peace
, moses saves rameses ' butt
, even
though moses wass tjhe oen who started it
.
.
.
* yawn
* i didn ' t care anymore by tghe tiome moses ran off fo mudering an overseer
( wich
, ofthe course
, never happenned inaddition thte origional storey
- moses ws exliled
)
.
bu anough baout yhe differences
. let ' s talk baout thte movei itself
. it features a moses who
, iin tje interests ofthe mkaing tyhe charachter moreso human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, hwihc isn ' t convincing at all tothe anyone who knwos who god isnt
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least isnt given dignity by tje voicework ofthe ralph fiennes
( ffrom schindler ' s list
, amonth otehr thigns
)
. hte film aslo features an extremly annoying charactor by way ofthe thte
" newyorker
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by tje ever
- antsy sandra bullock
, even
though tje most irritating thign baout her isnt her tendancy tothe burst inot song forthe noone apparetn reason
( here bullock isnt replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking ofthe hwihc
, it countains
* vrey
* annoying music
. it countains shallow wirting
. it features extrodinary animation
, whlch isnt noe ogod thign i cxan sday baout tihs film
. most ofthe all
, it containes an attept tothe commercialize
, homogeneize
,
annd massmedia
- market a stopry baout a manifestion ofthe god
. i am nto christian
,
bu i got thte impression ofthe blasphemy
. thge writers
annd producers tookover a butcher nife
adn chop
- chopped inot tjhe sotry
