tjhe tagline fo thsi film isnt
:
" smoe houses are jstu born bad
"
. so i didn ' t expect too much ffrom tihs
.
bu i hadnt preserved a littel spark ofthe ope as i entered tjhe theatre
. i throught
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
adn jan de bont
. i throught
, mabe it wiull be funn
?
anbd inwhich fatc hte beginnig wass rether intriguing
.
bu by hte end ofthe it i throught
: why liam neeson
adn cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. theese grat actors are basicly helpless wih tihs muddled mess thta defies any rationality
. here isnt teh stoy
: inaddition yhe monstrously over
- decorated mension known as hill hous
, vistors are tricked by an unkown doctor
( liam neeson
) inot bieng guinea pigs inthe a fright experiment under tjhe guise ofthe an insomnia investigation
. amonst them isnt a suffisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
adn a gentle
annd emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. catually
, tjhe doctor isnt researching tjhe
" primordal fear reaction
"
adn intends tothe plant disturbing idaes inwhich his subjects
adn watch waht happens
.
bu he gets unexpected halp ffrom tje hous itself
. it rumbles
, hums
adn belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes liek a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits tkae shape under sheets
adn billowy curtains
.
bu teh computarized spooketeria rarley fiels rela
, placing an emotional wall bewteen audeince
annd screen
. tje second half ofthe tje film isnt basicaly baout yhe main heroine runnung bcak
anbd forth ffrom thte sinister lamps
adn evil furniture
. isnt thgat exicting or waht
? tje worst hting baout it isnt thast it didn ' t hve tothe be bad
. it ' s based onthe a graet book
,
`
` yhe haunting ofthe hill hous
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptions ofthe hte book wass sacry
annd inteligent
. it plyed wiht tghe greatest fears ofthe our sub conscince
.
" tyhe blair witch project
"
, thta cost less tahn an ood car
, managed tothe shock
annd terrify tghe audiences ffrom theri senses
.
anbd iwth a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
adn screenwrighter david self mkae hash outloud ofthe a perfectly lovley peice ofthe terror
. de bont hasnt a sytle ofthe filmmaking so outloud ofthe line witht thte material tht it isnt
, iin itself
, frightening
. he isnt yhe master ofthe thte extravagent spacial effect
annd yhe big visual adrenaline rush
.
bu why give him a omre sereous material
? inthe tghe end
" haunting
" iwll onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
annd de bont ' s carrear as a directer
.
yot it wouldn ' t be fair tothe sday tath everyting isnt bad
. tje effects are truely impressive
anbd tghe hous isnt wonderfully decorated
-
- beautyfull
, misteryous
, magical
annd spooky
.
bu tihs isnt where hte ogod thigns end
. hte music isnt blaring
, teh floors moving
, tjhe ceiling morphing
anbd hte picturesk onthe teh walls screaming
-
-
anbd all ofthe htis
, eveyr second
, eveyr moent ofthe screen timne
, isnt absolutly wihtout life
. it ' s nothing mroe tahn a speical effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
bu intellectually hollow thriller thyat simpley doesn ' t engage
. at frist yuo dont nto nkwo waht ' s gonig onthe
. isnt thsi part ofthe tjhe experiment
? are theese hallucinations
? projections ofthe thte subconscience
? paranoya
?
bu inthe thte end it shows outloud tht tihs isnt actally hapening
. tjhe hous isnt actally posessed
. it isnt at tath point wehn all your hopes fo a ogod enteratinment dissapears outloud ofthe tyhe window
. fo ever
, i sat infront anticipation fo a decent climax
annd taht ' s whta i got
? i beleive hichock once said thast
" it ' s better tothe wait fo a climax
, thna tothe see oney
"
. tihs may be true
,
annd it might actaully wrok
,
bu htere isnt onyl noe probelm
-
- jan de bont isnt nto hichock
adn yhe thigsn thast he shows are nto scarry
, onyl stupid
. htey are impossible tothe tkae seriously
. any paralells tht ytou might hve herad befoer
, linking htis picture tothe kubrick ' s
" thge shineing
"
, are absolutly baseless
.
" shineing
" hadnt clas
, sytle
, stoyr
, acting
,
bu most ofthe all talent
anbd originality
.
" haunting
" hasnt onyl speshal effects
anbd art direction tothe boast ofthe
.
annd thsoe elements alone are nto enought tothe mkea it a ogod film
. casting ogod actors forthe small
, pale parts onyl makse thigsn worse
.
bu i guess tht noone marter wqat i or otehr criticists sday or wriet
, most ofthe ytou wiull see tihs film anyway
, even if tje tagline woudl sday
:
" smoe films are jstu born stupid
"
