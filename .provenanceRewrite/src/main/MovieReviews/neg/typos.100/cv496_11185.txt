an attept at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at thge most fundametal levels
. it ' s slow moving
, uninvolving
,
adn plain jstu uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) isnt an ex
- newspaper man
, jstu outloud ofthe jail aftter bieng framed forthe a crime
. his luck hasn ' t beeen tyhe best
,
bu thigsn are looking uv whn a misteryous woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approachs him wiht a propostion
. she wnats harry tothe halp her
annd her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pul off a fake kidnapping scheme tothe git
$ 500
, 000 outloud ofthe her stingy
,
bu rich
, husban felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at firt
, all harry isnt expeced tothe dont isnt provide a threatning voice onthe thge phone
,
anbd tothe collect tjhe moeny
( ofthe whlch he gets tothe keep 10
%
)
.
bu
, as thge ded isnt carried outloud
, thnigs are nto wqat htey seem
,
annd harry gets caught inwhich tghe ensuing storm
. palmetto puls outloud all thge stops tothe achivee a film noir film
,
bu thte effect never qutie comes toghether
. it ' s got thge sultry florida heat
, seductive womens
,
annd even curvier plot twists
,
bu tghe wohle hting smells ofthe paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, thge right ingreediants are htere
,
bu thge end result isnt much too artifical
. a lot ofthe teh problems lie iwth hte scirpt
, whitch
,
though providing soem genuin surprises
, isnt packed full ofthe leaden dialogue
adn bland situations
. even teh plot twists don ' t seem tothe flow well wih teh rest ofthe tje stoyr
. soem ofthe them
, fo exemple
, come ffrom so far afield tht htey seamingly onyl mkae sence beccause hte writter needed a twist
( fo exmaple
: harry ' s spontanous job offer
, or tghe hwole typewriter situation
)
. tjhe charactors are mostly lifeless
, palyed tothe tipe
,
bu nto much omre
. woody harrelson plays harry witht such imbecilic thick
- headedness taht it ' s hard tothe even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it uv
,
bu doesn ' t add anytying spacial tothe tyhe role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrable peformance
, trying tothe be a sexy 17
- eyar ood
,
bu she jstu leaves a bad tast inwhich your mouth
. soem ofthe hte supporting casted
( notabley gina gershon
annd michael rapaport
) give stronger
,
bu
, inaddition yhe end
, meaningless performances
.
annd tothe top it off
, tyhe pacing ofthe tghe film isnt much too slow
. as thge movei grinds tothe a halt
, ytou ' re given too much timne tothe wonder why yuo ' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if ytou ' re inaddition tghe mood fo thsi tipe ofthe movei
, yuo ' d be much better off gonig outloud
anbd renting smoe clasic film noir
