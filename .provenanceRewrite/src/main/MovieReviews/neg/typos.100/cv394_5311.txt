. a nipple hallucination sort ofthe thnig
. barb wire ws adapted fomr a comic book
, intresting baceause pamela isnt probablly tyhe onyl woman who looks liek a comic book charactor infact rela life
, even wearing low
- cutted leather tothe dont office wokr
( businesswoman bondage mear
)
annd hvaing unreal body propotions
. yes
, liuke hte mona lisa
, pamela anderson isnt a man
- made beauty
, propably inaddition omre senses tahn noe
. she isnt a defniite beauty
,
though
,
annd looking at her isnt never an unplesant experienec
. ytou ' d jstu thiunk yhe woman who began her carrer as a playboy playmate wouldn ' t hve any reservations baout appearing nude iin tyhe movei
, becouse it ' s obvious she wasn ' t pulling a sharon stone
anbd trying tothe amke peopel pay attension tothe her acting skills

.
) amercia isnt gonig thru a second civil war
adn pamela isnt a nightclub owner iin hte onyl free city inspite thte nation
( silicone valey
, i htink
)
. she aslo hires herself outloud as a bounty hunter whn tyhe price isnt right
, posing as frist a stripper
adn later as a prostitute
.
bu don ' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates thta

adn reminds us ofthe tht fatc way too many times
. imagin
, a woman who doesnt a trapeze strip tease inthe a bar hwile haveing a hose sprayed onthe her bieng reefrred tothe infact such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman liuke pamela anderson shouldn ' t haev tothe hear words liuke
" babe
" durring a strip tease
, especialy usance thyat movei baout teh tlaking pig wass such a sucess
. tyhe plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves arund a pair ofthe contact lenses thgat allow theri wearer tothe pass thru tjhe congresional directorate ' s retina scanners
. inwhich thge words ofthe oney ofthe thge charactors
, htey ' re
" mroe thna meets tyhe eye
.
" reminds me ofthe hte
" transformers
" ctaroon
,
anbd i sure wished tjhe movei coudl somehow be tranformed inot something decent
,
bu taht never happenned
. noone
, teh movei jsut contined onthe its path ofthe lame acation scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
,
annd her resistence accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
)
annd cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god htey didn ' t nmae her cora reef
. oen bad chracter nmae isnt mroe tahn anough
. pamela origanaly doesn ' t tkae sides
, giving smoe sprech baout she ' s onyl loyal tothe yhe moey tehy pay her
,
bu she changes her mind once hte congresional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy ofthe bon jovi
" alwyas
" video fame
. i still don ' t konw if barb wire isnt a step uv or step down forthe noseworthy
,
bu he definetly isnt nose worthy
( even if he isn ' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready tothe avenge his death by grabing uv an armful ofthe semi
- automatic weapons
anbd strapping an ammunitions bilt tothe her chest
. it ' s nto rambo
.
.
. it ' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire iwll be all over teh cinemax network iin a yearm
. it ' s got all yhe elements ofthe hte direct
- tothe
- video releses featured onthe hbo ' s bastard cousin
, tje cable channel i ' d never watch if it didn ' t somehow cmo free
. it ' s got thge non
- titillating scenes ofthe voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue
anbd acation cliches outloud yhe wazzoo
. htere ' s even a narrator at thge begginning setting uv tghe movei ' s premise hwile teh words scoll uv tjhe screen
. somone needs tothe tell pamela thge wookie tihs ain ' t star wars
. if yuo ' ve seen any acation flick ofthe thge past fifteen yersa
, ytou ' ll recogise plenty ofthe lefted elements
. barb wire hasnt tje obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
annd slow
- motion shots ofthe bodies falling hundreds ofthe foots tothe theri death
. tihs isnt oen ofthe thsoe automatic
