" primordal fear reaction
"
annd intends tothe plant disturbing idesa infront his subjects
adn watch
! waht happens
.
bu he gets unexpected halp fomr hte hous itself
. it rumbles
, hums
adn belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes liek a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits tkae shape under sheets
anbd billowy curtains
.

, placing an emotional wall betwen audeince
annd screen
. thge second half ofthe thge film isnt basicly baout hte main heroine runnung bakc
adn forth ffrom hte sinister lamps
anbd evil furniture
. isnt thta exicting or whta
? yhe worst thnig baout it isnt tyhat it didn ' t hvea tothe be bad
. it ' s based onthe a gerat book
,
`
` thge haunting ofthe hill hous
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaption ofthe yhe book wass skary
adn intteligent
. it plyed whith thge greatest fears ofthe our sub conscienec
.
" thge blair witch project
"
, tath cost less tahn an ood car
, managed tothe shock
adn terrify hte audiences ffrom thier senses
.
anbd iwth a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
anbd screenwrighter david self mkea hash outloud ofthe a perfectly lovley peice ofthe terror
. de
! bont hasnt a sytle ofthe filmmaking so outloud ofthe line witht thge material thyat it isnt
, iin itself
, frightening
. he isnt tyhe master ofthe yhe extravagent spacial effect
anbd tyhe big visual adrenaline rush
.
bu why give him a moreso sereous material
? inspite thge end
" haunting
" iwll onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
annd de bont ' s carrer as a directer
.
yot it wouldn ' t be fair tothe sday taht everthing isnt bad
. thge effects are truely impressive
anbd tyhe hous isnt wonderfully decorated
-
- beautyfull
, misteryous
, magical
adn spooky
.
bu tihs isnt where tje ogod thigsn end
. tje music isnt blaring
, tjhe floors moving
, tyhe ceiling morphing
adn hte picturesk onthe tyhe walls screaming
-
-
adn all ofthe tihs
, eveyr second
, eveyr moent ofthe screen tiem
, isnt absolutly wihtout life
. it ' s nothing moreso tahn a spacial effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
bu intellectually hollow thriller tyhat simpley doesn ' t engage
. at firt ytou dont nto nkow wqat ' s gonig onthe
. isnt tihs part ofthe teh experiment
? are theese hallucinations
? projections ofthe thge subconscience
? paranoya
?
bu infront thte end it shows outloud tath htis isnt atcually hapening
. thge hous isnt acutally posessed
. it isnt at thyat point wehn all your hopes forthe a ogod enteratinment dissapears outloud ofthe tyhe window
. fo ever
, i sat iin anticipation fo a decent climax
adn thgat ' s wqat i got
? i beieve hichock once said tyhat
" it ' s
! better tothe wait forthe a climax
, tahn tothe see oney
"
. tihs may be true
,
anbd it might acually wokr
,
bu htere isnt onyl noe probelm
-
- jan de bont isnt nto hichock
anbd tyhe thigns tyhat he shows are nto scray
, onyl stupid
. tehy are impossible tothe tkae seriously
. any paralells taht ytou might hve heared befoer
, linking htis picture tothe kubrick ' s
" tje shineing
"
, are absolutly baseless
.
" shineing
" hadnt clas
, stlye
, stor
, acting
,
bu most ofthe all talent
annd originality
.
" haunting
" hasnt onyl speshal effects
adn art direction tothe boast ofthe
.
annd thsoe elements alone are nto enought tothe mkea it a ogod film
. casting ogod actors forthe small
, pale parts onyl makse thnigs worse
.
bu i guess thgat noone marter wqat i or otehr criticists sday or wriet
, most ofthe yuo iwll see htis film anyway
, even if thte tagline woudl sday
:
" smoe films are jstu born stupid
"
