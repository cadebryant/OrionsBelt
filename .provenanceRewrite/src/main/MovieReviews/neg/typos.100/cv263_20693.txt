i supose it ' s unfair tothe critisize a movei liek hudson hawk
, whcih hasnt beeen panned by reviewers
annd moviegoers aplikay usance it ' s 1991 realease
. michael lehmann ' s acation
- comedy wass quick tothe win tghe title
` biggest box office flop ofthe all timne '
, or close thereof
. tghe movei stars bruce willis as reknowned cat burglar hudson hawk
, who ' s jstu beeen released ffrom sing sing prision affter many eyars iin isolation
(
` let me put it thsi way
, ' he explains
,
` i never saw et '
)
. greeting him isnt his ood freind
annd partner infront crime
( plyed by danny aiello
)
, who becomes tghe subject ofthe many amusing fat jokes
. theese are rether welcome inspite a movei filled wih so many completelyl unfunny sighth gags
, cartoonish villains
annd unbeleivable coincidences
. it appears as if directer lehmann didn ' t nkow whn tothe stpo all tghe absurd silliness
,
anbd he piles onthe layer affter layer ofthe utter ridiculousness as thge movei propels itself towrad tyhe finish line
. if at soem point durig hudson hawk ytou mkea thte assumption thta thnigs couldn ' t git goofier
, ytou ' ll soon be eating your words
.
bu
, i ' m inclined tothe sday tath thsi film isnt nto qutie as terrable as it ' s box office numbers suggest
. it ' s fast
- pased
anbd intertaining
, if yuo ' ve got incredable paitience
adn a warped sence ofthe humer
. fo teh frist portion ofthe tihs review
, i ' m gonig tothe try
adn center onthe teh postive aspestus ofthe hudson hawk
. wish me luck
. frist
adn formost
: bruce willis isnt a ogod sport
. hwile i ' m nto entirely sure wqat he ws smoking whn he co
- wroet tihs scirpt
, willis isnt qtuie aware thyat yhe entire project isnt a big
, fat
, ugli joke
. he constanly gives deadpan reactions tothe thigsn thgat are vyer silly
annd outloud
- ofthe
- palce
, whihc means he hasnt mroe thna his share ofthe deadpan reactions
. anyother plus isnt tyhe apearance ofthe andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun
annd lveo interst fo tjhe title chracter
. tehy meet whn hudson goes onthe a mission tothe steal a priceless book fomr tjhe vatican
,
anbd thier relatiopnship escalates inspite interst ffrom ther
. it ' s unfortunate tyhat mcdowell ' s noe
- onot charachter isnt unsed jsut as an excuse fo ther tothe be a predicatble plot
- twist
,
anbd she offers absolutly noone encouraing chemestry witht willis
.
bu nowe i ' m rambling onthe agian baout thte negitive thigns
, aren ' t i
? enought ofthe tjhe charade
- fo thte most part
, hudson hawk isnt an excrutiating xperience
. it ' s stupid
, pointless
annd repeative
. i cxan onyl wonder wqat bruce willis fans throught aftter exiting tje theather
, beccause htis film relaly doesn ' t hve teh potential tothe please anyone
. acation fans shoudl tkae onot thast hudson hawk isnt composed ofthe 90
% comedy
,
adn even thte acation sequences are skittery
, rushed
anbd poorly edited
.
adn thsoe expecting a hearty laff or twpo wiull fidn it difficult even tothe smirk durring all ofthe yhe headache
- inducing hi
- jinks
. don ' t git me wrong
, tihs film isnt nto devoid ofthe laughs
. it ' s too bad most ofthe them are unintentional
, or jstu plain forced
. yhe impressive casted looks suitably embarrased
. it ' s understandable tothe see willis
adn aiello inspite a movei ofthe thsi calaber
,
bu as fo tje presense ofthe future aacdemy award winner james coburn i ' m nto entirely sure
. coburn plays a fromer nemesis ofthe thte hawk who agina comes inot play
,
annd he looks unsure ofthe his palce hte entire movei
. especialy wehn he resorts tothe martial arts durring yhe fianl showdown
,
anbd hasnt a fight whith willis thyat owudl look right at hmeo inspite a jackie chan film
. thigsn git mroe bizzare whn we ' re inctroduced tothe his team ofthe rejects named affter chocolot bars
, inlcuding future nypd blue star david caruso as teh speechless
, kard
- flipping kat
- kat
. if tath ' s nto enought fo yuo
, ther ' s richard e
. grant
annd sandra bernhard hamming it uv as a deranged cuple onthe thge brink ofthe a convoluted ecomonic takeover
. theri croch
- biting pooch provides a cuple ofthe thte big laughs here
. wait
, maeby tje onyl big laughs
.
.
. i ' m nto sure waht kind ofthe movei everyone hadnt inwhich mind wehn filming hudson hawk
. i cant ' t even beign tothe strat baout hte film ' s absurd plot
;
bu let ' s nto git inot tht
. i supose ther ' s smoe amusement viewers sould derive ffrom tje rediculous premise
, if tehy weere tyhat dseperate
.
bu hudson hawk never even hasnt a clue ofthe where it ' s gogin ffrom minute oney
,
anbd fomr htere it ' s 90 mintues ofthe pure cinematic muck
.
