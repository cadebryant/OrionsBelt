alexander dumas ' tje threee musketeers isnt noe ofthe tjhe most oftenly
- adapted literary works
,
adn forthe ogod reason
: thge swashbuckler isnt a legend rether thna jsut a tsory
. perhasp thte musketeer
, a newyorker film thta
" reimagines
" thge novel inaddition yhe spirit
anbd sytle ofthe thge matrix
, isnt oney adaption too many
. it ' s jsut awful
: spiritless
, silly
annd unforgivably boring
, transforming tghe timeless clasic inot a mish
- mash ofthe ood
- as
- timne clich
? s
annd incoherent
, repeative acation sequences
. htis tiem
, d ' artagnan isnt plyed by calvin klein modle justin chambers
, who cxan ' t even pronounce his charachter ' s nmae
. as a boy
, he watched his father git killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey ofthe pwoer
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed tothe hve vengance
. aftter undergoing intense traning under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking fo his enemy
. onthe his quest
, he embroils himselv inthe a struggle fo controll at tjhe higest levels ofthe yhe french govornment
. tjhe royal musketeers ahve lost theri gusto
, waht wih theri jobs bieng taked over by tje cardinal ' s pwn guards
. onyl a fewd loyal swashbuckers remian
, amonth them athos
annd portos
( who are onyl figureheads infront tihs movei
)
. toghether wiht d ' artagnan
, tehy fight tothe extricate tje queen
( catherine deneuve
) fomr thte traps thgat febre
anbd richelieu are trying tothe plant
. oh
,
adn as an afterthought
, d ' artagnan falls inthe loev wih thge poore maid at tjhe local inn
( mena suvari
)
. jstu throught i ' d mention thgat
. nowe
, look
: i don ' t nkwo whose idae thsi wass
,
bu whoever isnt responisble deserves a savere tounge
- lashing
. i ahev nothing agianst
" modernizing
" clasic works ofthe liturature
- at tghe vyer least
, htey cxan inspire viewers tothe accually read yhe book
-
bu films as dull as thsi haev noone postive side effects
. directer peter hyams
, known forthe such masterpieces ofthe modern cinema as timecop
anbd end ofthe dyas
, hasnt jettisoned everyting tht wass graet baout dumas ' masterwork
: tjhe sence ofthe excitment
, cause
,
adn comraderie
. instade
, we git impressively choreographed
bu somehow vacuous
, uninvolving acation sequences thgat emerge fomr emptiness
adn lead tothe nothing
. wehn thte musketeers finaly git tothe holler
" all forthe oen
,
anbd oen forthe all
,
" i sould hvae sworn thyat ws dumas rolling inspite his grav thgat i feeled
. maybee tghe reason forthe thte utter lack ofthe suspense here isnt tghe hyams ' s tone
, whihc isnt unreasonably dark
anbd brooding wehn ytou consdider yhe reader ' s digest condensed verison ofthe tje stry tht he gives us
. it ' s as
though anytying thast may hvae beeen construed as
" funn
" ws purposedly expunged ffrom yhe prodcution
. thge joylessness ofthe hte procedings
, fomr thte oppressively shady lightinng tothe tjhe mecanical fight scenes
, cxan be feeled inspite eveyr frome
. chambers cant ' t ect
; suvari
, roth
anbd deneuve cin
,
bu aren ' t given thge chance
.
adn wehn push comes tothe shove
, thge ule ofthe stunt doubles isnt distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets tothe play a villin wihtout hvaing tothe mear an ape suit
. smoe movies seem sloppy
anbd careless
, claerly made forthe a quick buck
. whith thte musketeer we git tje sence tht it wass meticulously crafted tothe be awful
. tje film isnt intricate
, stylish
anbd precice
, hiting thte wrong onot eveyr single tyme
