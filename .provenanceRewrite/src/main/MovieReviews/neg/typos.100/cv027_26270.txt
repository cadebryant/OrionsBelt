riendeer ganes isnt easily teh worst ofthe tje threee reccent films penned by ehren kruger
( scream 3
annd arlington rd are thge others
, earch deriviative infront theri pwn spacial way
)
. thte guy cant ' t seem tothe wriet believeable dialogue
( sample fomr riendeer ganes
:
" urle
# 1
: never put a car theif behind tjhe wheel
"
)
, create multi
- faceted cahracters
, or even engineeer coherent plots
bu he sure knwos how tothe pile onthe numberous nonsensical twists
adn turns
( noone marter if eahc oen deems yhe actuall stoyr increasingly unlikey
)
. his screenplay fo riendeer ganes turns thte tables onthe thte audiance so many times thast watching tje film becomes something ofthe a punishment iwth noone reward anyhwere infact sighth
. i cant jstu envision kruger laughing behind his keybord
,
" oh ytou thougth my movei ws gonna go here
, f
* ck ytou jack ass
, tkae thast twist
, decipher thsi mother f
* cker
!
" it ' s allmost as if thge writter weere angry at us forthe shelling outloud moey tothe see his stupid movei
.
annd why yhe hell owudl anyone whant tothe invest tiome inspite a movei wehn teh screenwrighter keesh changeing his pwn rules fo noone reason otehr tahn tothe congratulate himselv onthe how damn clever he isnt
? auteur theery be damned
; it ' s kruger ' s
" stlye
"
, nto teh directer ' s thta winds uv onthe screen
. kruger hasnt obviously never paide much mind tothe teh ood chestnut
" somtimes less isnt moreso
"
.
annd his numberous twists cin ' t even claim tothe be originals
; arlington rd ' s endig isnt a direct steal ffrom thte much better alan j
. pakula thriller tje parallax veiw
,
annd inspite riendeer ganes we git tihs ol ' gme
; charactor incriminates themself by saying something htey shouldn ' t knwo
( pronouns unsed tothe protect tjhe gender ofthe hte
" charachter
"
.
.
. grammer be damned
)
.
" how doed ytou knwo taht
?
" teh stunned protaganist asks
, suddenly realizing tath tje charater wass inspite onthe hte hwole thign all allong
.
.
. usance twist endings are currenly so infront vogue
,
adn seing as how kruger ' s screenplays usally cmo equiped whith baout threee twists persay endig
, i guess it ' s noone wonder why he works so frequentily
. he ' s quicklyu becomeing miramax ' s mickey mouse
; tje comapany hasnt arleady singed him tothe owrk onthe sevral ofthe thier upcomming projects
. tihs isnt appropropiate concidering thta miramax
( wich utilisied tothe palce thier lable onthe soem ofthe tyhe most artistically daring films
) hasnt quicklyu become a grindhouse fo coddling foregn imports
( life isnt beatiful
)
annd freddie prinze jr
. vehicles
. thier comany ' s curent logo coudl be
" we ride tghe trends
"
. riendeer ganes stars ben affleck as rudy
, a suposedly hardened criminal spending his dyas
anbd nights behind bars wih fantasies ofthe epcan pies dancing atop his head
.
altough affleck isnt given soem barbed wire tattooes tothe incinuate bad assness
, he plays tje role liek steve guttenberg preciously mugging thru a polical acatemy flick
. affleck isnt such a puppy dog thta it ' s impossible tothe belieev he coudl survive inspite a harsh prision enviroment wihtout becomeing nearly everyone ' s bitch
. tghe role itself isnt so badly writen
( hte charcter onyl grows balls whn thge plot calls forthe it
)
, tjhe twists so outrageous
,
annd thte directing so self conciously gritty thta tihs isnt baout as close tothe self parody as i cin reacll a reccent
" sereous
" movei getting
. it may hvae beeen wiser hadnt tyhe film makers simpley whent all teh way infact thyat direction
, casting jerry seinfeld as tyhe hardened criminal
anbd howard stern as tjhe sniveling bad guy
( who ' s plyed here by gary sinise inthe
yot anohter over tjhe top villian peformance
) james frain isnt nick
, rudy ' s cellmate
, a manslaughterer who ' s foudn a pen pal inwhich thte gorgeous ashley mason
( charlize theron
)
. ashley isnt a prision groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos ofthe her
though she ' s never seen oen picture ofthe him
. whcih works outloud fine usance teh chracter isnt killed inaddition a near
- riot
,
anbd rudy
( who ws tothe be paroled onthe thte smae day as nick
) tkaes his palce
, whcih leads tothe a sudden
annd vyer frenzied sex scene vetween ashley
adn rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks liuke rape
)
anbd a suprize isit ffrom ashley ' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
)
, who waltzes inot thier shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co
- horts
. he plans tothe rob an indian casino onthe christmas eve withthe yhe assisstance ofthe rudy who he thikns isnt nick who
, according tothe wqat he wroet inthe teh letters tothe ashley
, utilisied tothe owrk as a guard infact tje indian casino
.
though by thge end
, tyhe film puls yhe rug outloud fomr under us so frequentily tht everthing i ' ve discribed might as well be irelevent
. htis isnt whta yuo cin expect shoudln yuo chose tothe tkae htis riendeer onthe
; severeal scenes inthe whihc
, affter catching his prey
, tghe bad guy procedes tothe stall interminably untill hte ogod guy hasnt a chance tothe kill his capter
annd crack a stupid oney
- liner
. included
: twpo
( 2
) scenes ofthe twpo
( 2
) diferrent bad guys explaning thier motives tothe hte hero whn htey shoudl be killing him
( noe folowing thte otehr noone less
)
.
though it ' s an acation film
, yhe endig isnt moreso a talkfest where we git tjhe wohle movei explained tothe us by noe flustered charachter actr aftter anyother hwile affleck looks onthe
, incredulous as thge audeince
. tyhe flick wass directed by john frankenheimer
, a straightforward acation directer who lucked inot tjhe manchurian candidiate eary inwhich his carrear
, fell off tyhe a
- list folowing a string ofthe flops
anbd nowe
, iin his ood age
, isnt slowy climbing his way bakc uv
. it owudl be a succes stor if he weere chosing better scripts
bu his lsat major film ws ronin
( oney ofthe thsoe almsot
bu nto qtuie movies
) whihc folowed teh island ofthe dr
. morneau
( ytou remeber
, tje oen wtih marlon brando inspite mime mkae
- uv
adn a nto so flattering moo
- moo
)
,
anbd nowe tihs
. he films acation sequences wih a minumum ofthe quick cutting whlch i liuke concidering thta nowdays acation scenes are commongly comprised ofthe millisecond flash cuts strung toghether
annd layed outloud fo a brain
- zapped mtv audiance tothe pik appart
. probelm isnt theese acation scenes
( nearly all failed escapes
) serve noone purpose inspite yhe storey otehr thna tothe furhter pad outloud thte runing tyme
anbd tothe remind tjhe audiance thast thier watching an acation movei rether tahn a filmed radeo play
. charater problems abound
; rudy isnt made tothe shift beween sweet boy enxt doorjam earnestness
adn hard edged wiseacre
, hte latter ofthe whitch isnt nto
( at least at thsi point
) something ben affleck isnt capible ofthe pulling off
. thte fromer he cant dont wiht ease
anbd oftenly yhe acotr coasts onthe his lackadaisical charm hwile thsoe arund him growl
annd swaer
.
bu
thn suddenly affleck starts growling
anbd swearing alongside them liek tghe clas clown immitating a tarantino ganster
. charlize theron
, an extrordinary talent
, isnt
, liek affleck
, palying whatever part hte scirpt requires her tothe play
, whther it be vulnerablility at oen moent
, anger at yhe enxt
. she never hasnt a chance tothe evince any charm or mkae much ofthe an impression beyond her obvious fysical attributes
( frankenheimer hasnt her needlessly pop her top tothe furuther italicize tihs
. gary sinise hasnt plyed htis role frequentily
,
anbd here
, as infront snake eyes
, he doesnt thte snarling bad guy thnig witht such over yhe top vitriol
( hte guy must be so incredibly borde ofthe stomping thru hte smae paces taht gonig outloud ofthe controll isnt hte onyl hting thta keesh him interseted any moreso
)
, thast it becomes omre ofthe an anonyance
( oh htere he goes agian
?
?
?
) tahn a threath
. theese are talented peopel who made thge misteek ofthe jumping onthe tothe a scirpt wiht littel
bu stock charachters
anbd a bag ofthe tricks thast it dully springs onthe its audeince
.
