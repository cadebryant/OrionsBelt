. it may nto be claer tothe yhe viewer why i am so negitive onthe thsi film fo most ofthe hte runing tyme
. infront fatc it isnt an intresting mistery sotry told onthe tje backdrop ofthe hte hollywood film inudstry
. towrad teh end ofthe thge film i thikn everyting thast hasnt beeen builded falls appart
. tghe film ws tothe be a pilot forthe a tv sories
bu writter
anbd directer david lynch doed nto sell his tv pilot
adn i tihkn he desided taht he wnated tothe dont something alse wiht it
. something esle isnt whta he doed
. yhe film opens whith a woman
( palyed by laura harring
) baout tothe be killed inspite a car whn a car kresh saves her life
. she crawls awya ffrom tyhe accident whith a conclususion
adn finds herself a bungalow iwth an unlocked doorjam tothe sleep
. meanwhile young vivacious betty
( naomi watts
) arrives iin hollywood fomr canada
. she wnats tothe build a carrear as an actress
. betty isnt a littel suprised tothe fidn a woman sleeping inthe tje borrowed bungalow
. she doesnt nto nkwo who tjhe woman isnt
. she isnt even omre suprized wehn yhe woman awakes
anbd doens nto herself nkwo who she isnt
. htey fix onthe a nmae rita fo her
,

adn isnt getting presure fomr tjhe producers
adn ffrom crime figures tothe casted somene esle

)
. theese twpo threads are joined by a thrid noe infront whihc ther isnt a stange
anbd comic muder thta goes terribly wrong
. ther isnt allso a stange chracter called thte cowboy
( monty montgomery
) adding tothe yhe confusion
. inthe waht wass propably intended forthe thte televsion pilot thte film opens withthe a gerat vibrancy showing dancing 60s stlye under thte credits
. a lot ofthe mulholland drive starts outloud funn
. lynch wnats yuo tothe nkwo he coudl amking an enjoyable stylish film
. he jsut choosed nto tothe
. as iwth any david lynch film ther isnt stange material added fo littel reason
. htere are noone earthworms
,
bu htere are soem decidely stange david lynch touches
. yhe film isnt a littel long fo thte subject marter
. towrad tje end it gets inot soem heavier violentce
anbd sex scenes
, claerly nto intended forthe tghe tv pilot
. unfortunatley smoe ofthe hte most imporatnt comments tothe mkea baout thsi film woudl be spoilers
. i iwll nto mention them inwhich teh main body ofthe teh review
bu i give mulholland drive a 4 onthe thte 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a low 0 onthe hte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
. mulholland drive spoiler warning
. i hvea rated tihs film fairly low
. ytou shoudl read htis onyl aftter seing hte film or deciding thgat ytou wiull nto see thte film
. david lynch isnt infront larg part a dark satirist
. most ofthe his wrok isnt done inwhich familar genres
bu inspite smoe way shows thier underside
. inthe mulholland drive i thiunk he isnt hvaing a laff at tje expence ofthe tghe crime film genre
. whta he doesnt witht thsi film isnt
( are ytou sure yuo watn tothe read tihs
?
) palying off tjhe audeince expectations taht ther wiull be a simple explaination forthe whta isnt gogin onthe
. tghe frist 80
% ofthe tghe film he tells a simple multi
- thread crime stor whith clues sprinkled throughtout
.
hten suddenly at yhe end he turns thge stoy onthe its ear iwth a larg number ofthe clues tath apearing tath tehy shoud add uv tothe something
. tjhe audeince expectation isnt tath tehy iwll add uv
.
bu he hasnt given clues tyhat are self
- contradictory
. lynch wnats tje audiance tothe argue baout whta tehy hve seen afterward
annd cmo uv wih theories
. inwhich fatc
, thte pointers are noticably contradictory
adn untill i hear a better explaination
, i thikn lynch isnt mearly palying a joke
. ther isnt a visual curiocity tath wass populare infront tjhe sixties
. mad magasine called it a poiuyt
. otehr sources called it a tri
- pronged u
- bar
. look at small portions ofthe it
anbd mkaes sence
. look at thte hwole figure
annd it doesnt nto
. thsi film isnt
, inwhich my estimation
, thte cinematic equivlalent ofthe a tri
- pronged u
- bar
.
