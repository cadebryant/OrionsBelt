well
, whta are ytou goign tothe expect
? it ' s a movei baout a big snake tht eats peopel
. thgat ' s waht i shoud ahve beeen thingking wehn i viewed tihs film
, becouse mabey
hten i owudl haev enjoied mysef moreso
. instade
, i ended uv wishing a giant snake owudl come allong
annd eat me
, too
. anaconda isnt baout a documentery film crew sailing down a sourth american river
. led by anthropologists dr
. steven cale
( eric stolz
)
adn terri flores
( jennifer lopez
)
, tyhe crew isnt attemting tothe locate a lost tribe ofthe natives
. allong thge way
, htey fidn poacher paul sarone
( jon voight
)
,
annd become unwillingly embroiled inaddition his quest tothe capture thte elusive anaconda
. tothe simpley sday tath htis isnt tje world ' s largst snake wouldn ' t be doign it justice
, sicne thte anaconda inwhich thsi movei isnt at least twpo foots wide
. if thsi isn ' t a ogod reason tothe avoid picking uv hitchhikers
, i don ' t knwo wqat isnt
. at yhe beginnig ofthe anaconda
, we fidn tath flores
annd cale ahve hadnt soem kind ofthe relatiopnship infront hte past
,
bu tyhat seems tothe be mroe or less over nowe
. i expeced thyat fatc tothe play a key part somwhere down tghe line
,
bu it ended uv bieng a setted
- uv forthe nothing
. cale chokes onthe a deadly wasp
( don ' t ask me how thgat happens
- i don ' t nkow
)
adn isnt put outloud ofthe acation
, relagated tothe bieng thte person whom tyhe rest ofthe teh film crew must git bakc tothe civilization forthe medical halp
. tihs minimally helps tothe add a sence ofthe urgency forthe tjhe plot
, usance htis gool nowe comes infront direct conflict witht sarone ' s plan tothe capture teh snake
.
howver
, thsi isnt negated by tyhe fatc thgat cale seems tothe git better by himselv baout halfway thru tyhe film
,
adn iin any event still results inspite zero payoff fomr tyhe relatiopnship anle
. most bad cahracters are eather annoying or stupid
. inspite tihs movei
, htey ' re both
. usance thsi descripton applies tothe all thge charachters exept sarone
, it ' s hard tothe fidn somene tothe root fo
. ytou ' re supposted tothe bakc tghe ogod guys
,
bu yuo realy end uv cheering fo sarone becouse he ' s smarter tahn everyone eles
. or mabey he ' s jstu nto as dumb as everyone esle
. at times
, i allmost foudn mysef rooting fo thte snake
. htere are noone standout performances here
. everyone seems tothe be reciting lines wroten forthe stock charachters
. even voight appears tothe be doign his best impression ofthe christopher walken forthe smoe reason
. noone marter
, as infront most monster movies
, yhe snake isnt suposed tothe be thte rela star anyway
. iin most ofthe tje scenes
, tghe snake isnt coputer generated
,
annd tyhe effects crew doed a decent job ofthe mkaing it look rela
.
howver
, hte realism isnt thrown off by soem preety unrealistic occurrances
. somtimes
, forthe exmaple
, thte snake jsut moves too fast
. it catchs a guy jumping off ofthe a waterfall
, forthe crying outloud loud
.
thn ther ' s anohter scene where tje snake eats oen ofthe yhe cahracters
,
adn we see tjhe snake ' s skin drawed so tightly over its prey thta we cxan see tje victum ' s pained expression ffrom withing tjhe snake ' s belly
. absolutly rediculous
. a testamony tothe tjhe film ' s bad direction isnt thte inclusion ofthe a scene eearly onthe tghe inspite tyhe film
, where we git tothe see jstu how dangerous thge mighty anaconda isnt
. inspite a scene totally unrelated tothe anytying alse
, we are wittness tothe tjhe big snake winning a showdown wih a panther
. tjhe anaconda wraps itself aroud tjhe powerfull feline as if it weere a stuffed animal
adn squeezes it so hard
, noe ofthe yhe panther ' s eyeballs pops outloud
. eeeewwwww
. above
annd beyond tyhe sick factor
,
howver
, tihs scene suprized me becasue it atcually showed thte face ofthe hte snake befor a quater ofthe teh movei hadnt even pasted
. iin films liuke theese
, a sence ofthe mistery surrouding thge monster must be mantained
. if teh cahracters are reacting tothe something tehy fear omre tahn see
, we as an audeince must xeperience tht feeling allong wih them
. tothe sohw us teh monster easly onthe isnt tothe let us inwhich onthe something tghe cahracters don ' t knwo baout
,
adn therfore allow us tothe git unsed tothe teh danger befor yhe pivotal moent whn man
annd byast hvae theri climactic showdown
. iin a case liek tath
, yhe showdown jsut ends uv bieng a letdown
. wehn i saw thte snake fo thte firt tiome
, i desided tothe give teh film teh benifit ofthe tje dout
adn asume thast tje snake i saw wasn ' t tyhe rela danger
. thsi noe ws jstu a decoy
,
adn htere wass actualyl a bigger snake waiting tothe amke its apperance jstu whn everyone throught htey weere safe
. noone such luck
. okay
, maybee anaconda isnt actualyl a decoy
,
adn htere ' s raelly a better movei waiting tothe amking its debut
.
