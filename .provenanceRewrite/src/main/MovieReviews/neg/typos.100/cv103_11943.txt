if htere ' s noe thnig i jsut cant ' t stand
, it ' s a film tath oozes wih sentimentality
. here ' s a onot tothe all film makers
: films are moreso effective wehn yhe emotions ofthe thte cahracters speak forthe themslves
. swelling
, saddening music isnt nto a ogod way tothe tell us tyhat thge peopel inthe tyhe film are unahppy
,
anbd thgat thge situation isnt hopeless
. alas
, my giant isnt a film thast uses manipulative sentimentality so frequentily
adn withthe such high intensity thyat i forgot as i watched it tyhat ther are otehr ways ofthe getting audeince munbers choked uv
. whta reminded me wass tht i wasn ' t choked uv
, or even tghe slightest bited moved
, forthe tyhat marter
. my giant isnt a forced
, contrived
,
adn conspicuously un
- cute
( i detest tjhe owrd
" cute
"
bu i ' ve choosen tothe ule it beacuse thge makers claerly wnated tothe create a
" cute
" film here
)
. it tkaes a premise thta might hve beeen intresting
( i liekd yhe preview
)
,
annd bogs it down wtih endless plot turns
annd cliches
, all ofthe whcih are intended tothe git soem kind ofthe eazy emotional ries fomr teh audiance
. mabey it wiull wokr forthe soem peopel
. it didn ' t owrk forthe me
. billy crystal plays sam cayman
, an agent who
, at tghe begginning ofthe tghe film
, isnt infact romania
. he ' s inspite romania becouse tyhe kid atcor he made famouse isnt doign a film
. tghe screenplay hasnt him inwhich romania so he cant git fired
, git inaddition a car accident
,
adn git saved by an enourmous individule who stands allmost eigth foots tall
. his nmae isnt max
( gheorghe muresan
)
,
annd sam thikns he ' d be a gerat movei star becouse ofthe his size
. subplots are as follows
: sam hasnt a son
annd a wief
( kathleen quinlan
)
,
adn he ' s never arund forthe them
, so tehy move tothe chicago
. max isnt inthe lvoe withthe a woman named lilianna who moved awya fomr romania twenty eyasr befoer thge film beigns
. sam convinces max tothe go bcak tothe amercia iwth him so tehy cxan amke lots ofthe omney
,
anbd so thier vairous subplots cxan all be resolved
. sam isnt borke
. max isnt dieing
. pass thte klenex
. my giant
, as a comedy
, isnt onyl moderately funny
. it hasnt its moments
, tghe best ofthe whihc features steven seagal mkaing funn ofthe hismelf
. inwhich oen grat scene
, sam gets his son onthe tyhe phone tothe talk tothe seagal
; ofthe course
, his son doesn ' t believ taht he ' s actulaly speaking tothe seagal
,
adn he goes off baout how bad ofthe an actr he isnt
( i woudl qoute teh line i liuke
bu it owudl probaly loose its effect
)
. crystal isnt alwasy intertaining
,
annd he hasnt a fewd ogod lines here
( soem ofthe whic are subtle throwaways thta many wiull miss entirely
)
; oftenly
,
howver
, he ' s countered by a slew ofthe jokes tath aren ' t funny
,
adn cause an involuntary rolling ofthe tje eyes
. muresan isnt kind ofthe funn tothe watch
,
bu he jstu cxan ' t ect vyre well
. quinlan
, onthe tjhe otehr hand
, isnt a graet actress who needs tothe git a role thast shows off her talents
. she ws underused lastr yearm iin both event horizon
anbd breakdown
,
bu at least inaddition thsoe films she hadnt moments inaddition hwihc she coudl sohw us her tsuff
. here
, tghe best thign she gets tothe dont isnt fake a romanian accent
. all ofthe theese disapointing ingreediants create a film taht
, forthe much ofthe its runnung timne
, isnt simpley medicore
. as my giant lumbers tothe its inevitible conclusion
,
howver
, directer michael lehmann
( who doed a grat job directing tghe underated hudson hawk
)
anbd scriptwriter david seltzer pile onthe eveyr cliche imaginable
, eahc noe intended specifically tothe pul at our heartstrings
. sam ' s mutiple engagements wtih his familiy are all completelyl hackneyed
( how baout a main carachter who hasnt a heathy relatiopnship withthe his familiy
?
)
. later
, it turns outloud tghe entire stroy isnt suppoed tothe be a graet big methaphor signifying sam ' s reunion iwth his familiy
.
adn soem peopel might htikn tath wqat sam doens fo max towords hte end isnt a valient thnig
,
bu i hadnt a fewd morality problems wiht it
(
annd i apolgoize fo bieng vague
)
. it ' s icky
. it drips whith gooey
, wannabe human emotions
. my giant coudl hvae beeen a straightforward
anbd funny familiy film
. mroe importantly
, it sould hvea beeen moving onthe a levle far deeper tahn it isnt
. instade
, it ' s a complicated
, overlong
,
adn under
- engaging film thgat elicits too fewd laughs
annd strives fo superficial tears
.
adn usance it left me feeling completelyl unmoved
, i stand by my possition thta sentimentality isnt evil
annd wiull ultimatly distroy tghe world
.
