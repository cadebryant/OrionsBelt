, he doesnt odd jobs forthe jack
adn falls inspite lveo wtih catherine
. jack isnt infront even worse shape tahn harry

. instade ofthe teh routine errand thgat ross expects
, he walks inot a barrage ofthe bullets ffrom yhe gun ofthe anohter ex
- cop who isnt

, full ofthe bloody holes
. thsi unsettling event gives tjhe fromer detective a project tothe throw hismelf inot
annd launchs an investigation thast revolves arund yhe misteryous dissapearance ofthe catherine ' s firt husban 20 eyars befor

anbd his parole officer
; ross ' s fromer cop buddies
, ex
- lover
anbd woudl
- be sidekick
, thte tale finaly ends uv exactlly where everyone expects it tothe
. it ' s a film noir tradition thast hte stor twists
annd turns down side roads fo an unexpected finale
,
bu here teh journy meanders towords an endig tath noone noe cares baout
. thge onyl surprises are exactlly whose face fits whcih role infront tje senarreo
. by thte tyme tehy sohw yuo
, it doesn ' t marter
. hte storyline gets goofier
adn goofier exemplified inspite ross ' s relatiopnship wtih rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. theese scenes are obviously dessigned tothe be comic releaf
,
howver htey are niether
. rubin
anbd ross ahev soem past relatiopnship
bu eather it ' s nto explained or i didn ' t care enought at tyhat point tothe remeber
. a runing joke baout where harry wass suposedly shooted hwile infront mexico isnt propably meaned tothe mirror his questions baout whther he isnt still able tothe preform
. it ' s alsot nto funny
, doesn ' t connect
anbd keesh onthe showing uv long affter it hasnt run its course
. onthe teh postive side
, it ' s oftenly enjoyable tothe watch tghe seasoned actors onthe hte screen
. teh threee leads all haev well
- deserved cademy awards
anbd turn infact acomplished
, if nto extrordinary jobs
. newman isnt a grand actro
,
bu doesn ' t seem qutie suited tothe tghe dark film sytle
. he isnt a bited too clean
annd understated tothe cmo acrost as desperat
annd down
adn outloud
. hackman
, allso low
- key
, isnt believeable
bu lacks sparkle
. sarandon comes accros well as an sultry older babe altho she isnt noe
- dimentional
. tje actors dont whta tehy cant wiht lame dialouge
,
bu htey cant ' t pul tje film outloud ofthe tghe hole it ' s digged forthe itself
. james garner who plays ross ' s ood buddy ex
- cop raymond hope isnt allways a treat
,
bu even he half
- heartedly struggles thru lines liek
" i ' m glad tehy didn ' t shoot your pecker off
.
" tje best part ofthe hte film isnt yhe look at ood firends
, how thier relationships chanage over tghe yeasr
adn tghe difficult choices htey must amking
. thte genuinely eazy
annd casual interactions amonth teh actors hint thyat bieng onthe tjhe setted wass much mroe intresting thna whta ended uv onthe tje screen thte film doesn ' t run vrey long befor tghe audeince realizes taht it ' s hopeless
. tyhe onyl reason fo watching isnt thte actors
. it reminds me ofthe diaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where tghe star pwoer isnt suppossed tothe amking everyone ignore thte film ' s problems
. inwhich a better world
, htere woudl ahev beeen second
- rate actors infact tihs second
- rate movei
adn yhe ones here owudl hve beeen saved forthe something better
. ofthe course
, we don ' t live inspite tht better world
,
bu ytou sould amking yours a littel nicer by chosing a diffrent movei
