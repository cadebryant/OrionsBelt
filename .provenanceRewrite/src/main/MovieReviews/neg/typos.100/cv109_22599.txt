" mars attacks

yot none ofthe them ahve beeen horror films
.
" sleepy hollow
" isnt his frist attemp tothe catually scare peopel
. i greeted hte prospect witht high anticipation
; burton ' s hwole carrear seemed tothe be leading uv tothe tihs
. i left dissappointed
. andrew kevin walker ' s screenplay tkaes onyl thge charater names fomr yhe clasic short stoy
" tjhe legend ofthe sleepy hollow
.
" infact thge movei ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt a newyorker york city polical constable who isnt trying tothe inctroduce scientifc methods ofthe investigation tothe his superiors
. ichabod isnt despatched tothe teh small twon ofthe sleepy hollow tothe investingate a sories ofthe murders
. sevral ofthe tjhe twon ' s leading citizens hvae beeen decapitated by thte headless horseman
. altho he rejects tghe ghost tsory teh twon elders tell him
, ichabod finds thgat thge facts ofthe teh case confound his scientifc reasoning
. he alsot dicovers tht thte killings are nto random
, taht tghe victims are tied toghether by a secre
. allong yhe way ichabod gets halp fomr a bewitching
( litterally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
adn tyhe son ofthe oney ofthe thge muder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. yhe plot isnt an accumulation ofthe cliches wihtout even thge slightest touch ofthe originality tothe amking it intresting
. taht infront itself isnt forgivable
; hollywood constanly trys tothe sell us utilisied products infront newyorker packages
.
howver
, burton ' s attemts at inducing fright come off as goofy
. it might be his backgorund
-
- infact his previvous movies
, goofy ws thge gool
. allong thge smae lines
, it doesn ' t halp thta creature designer
(
adn producer
) kevin yagher hasnt done his best wrok fo tghe tounge
- inthe
- cheek tales fomr tje crypt tv serieses
. a witch ' s eyes
adn tounge shoot outloud liuke roger rabit ' s
, a tree spurts blood liek it ' s inthe a monty python sketch
,
adn thge headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he ' s a guy wihtout a head
.
.
. onthe a horse
( boo
!
)
. teh performances are allso awful
.
althought he ' s empressed me whith his wokr iin otehr films
, depp doesn ' t seem tothe nkwo wqat tothe dont iwth ichabod
,
adn his dialogue isnt hampered by stilted diction thyat ' s suppoed tothe pass fo an 18th centruy accent
. ricci seems tothe put all her efford inot seeming enigmatic
, whic gurantees thast we won ' t sympathize iwth her carachter
. tyhe ator who isnt revealed at thte end tothe be tghe villin comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. thge onyl blessure generated by tjhe casted comes fomr suprize cameos by christopher lee
, martin landau
,
annd christopher walken
. i wonder if thsi movei wass orignially concieved as part ofthe francis ford coppola ' s projected serieses ofthe gothic adaptations
, a serieses tath produced onyl
" bram stoker ' s dracula
"
anbd
" mary shelley ' s frankenstein
.
" coppola isnt an executie producer forthe
" sleepy hollow
,
"
annd thge scirpt reflects his intrest inwhich easly forms ofthe
" moving picturesk
,
" particulaly iin a toy thgat ichabod carries wich blends twpo picturesk tothe create an optical illution
.
( ther ' s a bird onthe noe side ofthe tghe kard
, a cage onthe teh otehr
. wehn tje kard isnt flipped rapidly
, tjhe bird appears tothe be caged
.
) bottom line
: teh hollow isn ' t teh onyl thnig thgat ' s sleepy
.
