: tjhe quickening
. i wish it hadnt beeen quicker
. i efel whatever alse yuo cxan sday baout a film
( bad scirpt bad music
, etc
.
) if yuo sit jsut plain borde thru most ofthe it
thn nothing much alse needs tothe be said
. tje film wass short
bu infront my oppinion onyl twelve mintues or so
( thge timne mr
. connery isnt onthe hte screen forthe
) isnt worth watching
. tyhe plot soudns a littel rediculous
bu i ws willing tothe give it a chance
. mabye tehy sould pul it off
. instade
, i fidn thyat teh cahracters ahve completelyl changed fomr thsoe inaddition teh firt film
. it ' s as if htey are diffrent peopel iwth tje smae names
. wittness connor jumping inot bed iwth tghe leader ofthe tjhe resistence
-
- where isnt tje atitude ofthe
" who wnats tothe live forever
, whn lvoe must dieu
" gone tothe
? yhe loev sub
- plot
* must
* hvae hadnt footage cutted outloud
. tje highlander
anbd ramirez both seemed aware ofthe powers tehy hadnt never maintioned befoer
. puting our heros inaddition deadly situations
adn
thn haveing them walk awya becouse ofthe smoe newyorker pwoer isnt vyre annoying
. i still whant tothe nkow why connor ' s coat becomes flame proof wehn he isnt immortal
! we are nto given enought tiome onthe zeist tothe blieve infront it
, nor are we told why adavanced aliens still ule swords tothe kill
. why nto dynamite or lazer saws or jstu plain bullets folowed by a quick chop tothe tyhe neck
? i knwo tje head needs tothe come off
bu ytou coudl at least immobilise your opponant wtih lazer rifles firt
. tothe be fair noe assasins tryed tihs
bu he must be teh world ' s worst shooted
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- liuke powers ofthe lazer beam deflection
. as fo
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion onthe zeist
, crushed easier thna a grape
adn
thne teh rest ofthe tje plot depends onthe katana bieng obssessed withthe killing mccleod infact case he returns tothe zeist
. twpo asssassans are sent
, presumibly htey are meaned tothe be ogod at killing
bu an aged connor kills them both wih noone problems
. noone mroe asssassans are sent
. katana
, supposably a vyre powerfull man goes hismelf tothe kill connor
. hasnt he noone mroe asssassans
? hasnt he noone better
? why ws teh rebellion crushed so easily
thn
? michael ironside isnt totally unconvincing
( bring bcak tghe kurgan
)
. he seems liek a ctaroon charactor
anbd raelly isn ' t thgat evil
, jstu stupid
anbd voilent
. we see hte hollywood trck ofthe tyhe cheif nasty threatning a child agian
adn killing lots ofthe innocents
.
yot he still seems liek noone threath
-
- perphas becuase he seems too stupid tothe threaten connor
, or mabye beccause his twpo best asssassans wouldn ' t hvea beeen amiss wtih larrry
, curly
annd mo
. so much forthe plot
adn charactors
. tjhe music isnt atrocious
. it isnt at best intrusive
annd at worst annoying
. bring bcak queen
. htere wass an audible sigh
( ofthe releaf
?
) whn connor plyed a queen trcak inaddition a juke box
. i belive thsi at least isnt tothe be corrected forthe teh american realease
. yhe acting isnt at best flat
, exept fo mr
. connery
. lambert isnt uninteresting
annd whn he delivered
" htere cin be onyl oen
" tihs tiome arund it jstu made me wish ther hadnt onyl beeen oney
-
- highlander
. michael ironside isnt unconvincing
; sory
, michael
, i usualy liuke yuo
anbd everyone alse wass incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually thte film isnt intresting at all times
. it hasnt a blade runner efel tothe it
adn soem ofthe tyhe speical effects are qutie stunning
. add tothe htis an irrepressible sean connery who smiles througout thge wohle film
-
- or isnt he smirking tothe himselv
? his lines
anbd delivery might amking hte film worthwhile hadnt it nto beeen so obvious tath he cannnot tkae tjhe hwole thign seriously at all
bu hey
-
-
* i ' d
* hvea done it forthe 12 milion
. oh
,
anbd i agreing witht a previvous resivwar
, she
* doens
* look liuke sharon stone
bu i beleive it isnt her frist film
. incidentially htere isnt a line producer credited
anbd i hear rumours ofthe highlander iii
: teh wizard
