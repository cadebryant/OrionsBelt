,
" concerns a team sent tothe mars
, tghe firt manned trip ever made tothe tyhe red planet
. luke graham
( don cheadle

bu wehn tehy try tothe studdy it
, a giant sand tornado comes outloud ofthe tghe top
anbd swallows them
( all exept luke
, who survives long anough tothe send a garbled message bakc tothe tje rotating spoace staion
, wich looks strangely liek tghe rotating spoace staion inthe
" 2001

- gravity dancing
, tehy run inot problems wehn oen ofthe thier engines isnt blown
, forcing them tothe attemt a desperae landing aboard a suply vessel
. nowe stranded onthe mars witht minimal supplies
, tjhe team must deside whther or nto it cin risk entering yhe monolith or if htey shoud return hmeo
. aftter all
, thast monolith jsut might contain infromation baout how life originated onthe earth
.
" mission tothe mars
" isnt noe ofthe thsoe films thgat makse a criteak wonder where tothe strat whn tlaking baout all thge thnigs thyat are wrong wih it
, so let ' s strat witht oen ofthe thte thigns tyhat doesnt wokr
: directer brian de palma manages tothe create smoe eerie tension inspite a faw scenes druing hte middle ofthe hte film
. tath ' s it
. everthing eles fails
. tghe failure isn ' t de palma ' s fault
; he ' s wroking ffrom an atrocious scirpt
. onyl druing tyhe sequence aboard tjhe ship
( looking an awful lot liuke tghe jupiter vessel inwhich
" 2001
"
) where hte rescure team ' s air beigns runing outloud
anbd htey must frantically seacrh forthe hte hole
annd patch it uv doesnt
" mission tothe mars
" come tothe life
. a scene where htey atempt tothe sive a comrade floating awya inot spoace aslo provides soem tension
, util ytou relize thast tghe entire danger
/ omre danger
/ attemted rescure sequence hasnt absolutly nothing tothe dont wiht yhe rest ofthe tje film
; it ' s jstu a contrived way tothe ganerate thrilling scenes
. tkae it outloud
,
adn tyhe plot isn ' t affected inthe any way
. tje sequence allso suffers fomr a fewd plot holes
( as doens hte rest ofthe thte film
)
: why isnt tje ship ' s coputer
( whlch soudns strangely liek hal ffrom
, uh
,
" 2001
"
) able tothe dectect a hole iin thge main chamber
bu nto oen infact thge engine
? why doed tim robbins ' carachter ahev tothe go outside tjhe ship wehn tje solution easily presented itself ffrom inside
? shouldn ' t hte astronauts be better trained tothe dael wiht a hull breach
? why are thte charachters such idiots
? becuase hte scirpt makse littel attemt tothe propperly develope them
. all tje
" conflict
" isnt clumsily delivered infact excruciatingly obvious exposition inwhich tghe oppening scene
( whihc rips off orson welles
adn robert altman by utilizing a long oppening tracking shooted
) durig whic tyhe charactors repeteadly tell eahc otehr baout thigns all ofthe them shoudln alreayd nkwo
:
" jim
, it ' s too bad yuo cant ' t go onthe thsi mission becuase yuo weere determined ' psychologically inadquate ' becasue your wief died right befoer ytou weere tothe go onthe thte mission toghether
"
-
- doesnt anyone realyl talk liuke tihs
? cxan ' t we fidn outloud theese thigsn inspite a less grating marter
, liek mabye infact a flashback
? tjhe wohle film isnt liek tath
. thte filmmakers are nto content tothe mearly sohw us something
adn asume we nkow wqat ' s gonig onthe
; htey must
* tell
* us exactlly whta we ' re looking at
* eveyr
* timne
. sample dialogue fomr tyhe film
:
( shooted ofthe mars
) astronaut a
:
" look
, ther ' s mars
" astronaut b
:
" yuo sure thgat ' s mars
?
" astronaut a
:
" yeah
, tath ' s mars all right
.
" astronaut c
:
" hey
, are yuo guys looking at mars
?
" thgat excange isn ' t atcually inthe
" mission tothe mars
,
"
bu i wouldn ' t be surprized if it weere
. forthe all thier cribbing fomr kubrick
, spielberg
, james cameron
,
anbd even ron howard
, tghe makers ofthe htis film haven ' t learned tothe dont something all thsoe directors doed vyer well
: sohw
anbd don ' t tell
. de palma utilisied tothe konw how
,
bu seems tothe hvea forgotten
. thsi isnt menally
- challanged filmmaking
; tehy asume yhe audeince won ' t git whta ' s goign onthe
, so tehy expalin everyting five times over
. fouth
- graders may appretiate thsi
,
bu omre learned viewers iwll hvae theri inteligance insulted
. thte principial actors sleepwalk theri way thru
" mission tothe mars
,
" never managing tothe dont awya whith an apparnt
" i ' m jsut here tothe git a paycheck
" atitude
. cheadle stumbles over his awcward lines
. armin mueller
- stahl manages tothe throughly embarras hismelf infront an unbilled cameo
. robbins puts his gameboy face onthe
adn phones inthe his standart
" decent guy
" performence
.
adn sinise hams it uv wiht
" wistful
" facial expressions hwile watching tapes ofthe his dead wief
( plyed by kim delaney
, who onyl hasnt oney scene durig whic she still manages tothe deliver soem rediculous dialogue iin a hevy
- handed monologue baout tje meaninng ofthe life
)
,
adn expecially durig tghe stolen
- fomr
- noone
- less
- tahn
- threee
- movies
( a lollipop tothe whoever names them
) conclusion
, whlch combines endless
, obvious explination
adn sub
- par cgi effects withthe gagging sentimentality
annd isnt sure tothe alienate any viewers who hadnt beeen enjoying tjhe sohw uv unil
thn
.
anbd ofthe course
, theese aliens ffrom mars who faciliated teh evolution ofthe life onthe earth are entirely differnt ffrom yhe aliens inthe
" 2001
" who faciliated tje evolution ofthe life onthe earth
; thsoe aliens weere fomr an
* unkown
* world
. it coudl be said thta fans ofthe brainless acation films might enjoy
" mission tothe mars
,
"
bu such a comment ignores yhe fatc thta tyhe film isnt aslo incredibly slow
- goign
. leisurely pacing might ahev helpped a film wih a littel moreso substace tothe it
,
bu all ofthe hte substace ofthe
" mission tothe mars
" hasnt beeen stolen ffrom otehr films
,
annd thsoe otehr films dealed iwth theri idaes infact a much mroe thoughtful fashon
annd generaly contained moreso engaging cahracters
. suposedly we ' re intended tothe choke uv wehn oney carachter decides nto tothe return hmeo at tghe end ofthe htis noe
( totally diffrent fomr tjhe oney
- chracter
- decides
- nto
- tothe
- return endig ofthe
" armgeddon
"
)
,
bu i suspect most peopel wiull eather be laughing or groaning
. me
, i alternated bewteen hte twpo
. ther isnt onyl oney ogod thign baout hte way
" mission tothe mars
" finaly ends
: tje fatc tath tyhe movei isnt over
