anbd custody iin 1995 seems baout as timely as a movei baout mood rings
. famaly breakups hvae beeen an all too familliar part ofthe tghe american landscape forthe nearly thirty yeras
,
adn countless dramas ahve told stoires ofthe acrimonious cout battles inspite hand
- wringing detail
. still
, i cin ' t reacll a comedy baout tje subject befor bye bye lveo
.
anbd affter it
, i still cin ' t
. bye bye lveo isnt rarley funny
, moreso oftenly a weak
annd melodramatic retread ofthe common tv
- movei fare
. onyl a fewd moments wich hvae nothing tothe dont wih thte film ' s main premise offer big laughs instade ofthe cliched emotion
. bye bye lveo follows noe weekend inaddition tyhe lives ofthe threee divorced fathers who git weekend custody ofthe theri childen
. dave
( matthew modine
)
, a father ofthe twpo

; donny
( paul reiser
) pines forthe his ex
- wief
anbd hasnt trouble realting tothe his teenage daugter emma

, teh threee men face varous crises
, incuding vic ' s blind date fomr hell
( janeane garofolo
)
annd donny ' s growing estrangement fomr emma
. tje threee lead actors form a rether unlikey combo
,
adn teh qaulity ofthe thier performances isnt ofthe widely varing qality
. randy quaid isnt tje best ofthe thge threee
, bitter wihtout bieng irritating
, gleefully spiteful wihtout bieng frightening
. his run
- ins wiht isnt ex
- wief
( lindsey crouse
) are a bited over
- plyed
,
though
,
annd his confrontation wtih a pompous rdio psychologist
( rob reiner
) isnt gimmicky
adn implausible
. he doesnt git bye bye lveo ' s best sub
- plot
, a hillarious dinner date iwth a gloriously demented janeane garofolo
,
annd he doesnt a graet slow burn
. paul reiser realy hasnt onyl oen charcter
, his slightly befuddled
, uptight nice guy
" mad baout ytou
" persona
,
bu he doens it well
. as a perosnality
, he isnt appealling
,
bu as a charcter
, he becomes preety boring here
. matthew modine
, isnt
, qutie simpley
, terrable
. htis isn ' t a performence ogod enought tothe be called mailed
- iin
; he even forgot tothe put a stamp onthe it
. modine lacks any charm infront an appallingly under
- writen role
, looks borde most ofthe tghe tyme
,
annd gets sticked withthe a trite littel speach baout how it ' s all his father ' s fault he ' s such a cad
. carolco ' s executives
, whose entire future isnt resting onthe modine ' s bankability forthe tjhe upcomming cutthroat island
, must be sweating buckets right nowe
. bye bye lveo basicly comes off as a veyr confuzled movei
, becouse it spends far too much ofthe its timne onthe thte newyorker relationships ofthe its main charachters instade ofthe onthe yhe relationships betwen tje fathers
anbd theri kids
, makeing it jstu anyother
" dating infact tghe 90s
" movei
. wehn tyhe movei doesnt deel withthe hte childern at all
, it isnt tothe hvea noe ofthe them scream outloud an accusation
adn
/ or cry
, perheaps tothe be resolved later by a senstive talk
annd a hug
, perphas nto
. even moreso confusing isnt a sub
- plot featuring hte lite ed flanders as a widower who goes tothe owrk
anbd a mcdonald ' s
adn befriends a troubled youth
. it isnt a sad end tothe flanders ' carrear
, getting caught uv infront a truely annoying over
- ule ofthe mcdonald ' s as a loction
, a plot divice
annd
, aparently
, a major advertiser
. even if bye bye lveo hadnt desided tothe spend its timne focusing exculsivly onthe thge pparent
- child relationships
, it still woudl hvae beeen preety difficult tothe pul off
, beccause ultimatly htere isnt veyr littel humer oney cin wrng fomr familiy break
- ups
anbd theri effects onthe childern
. any way ytou slice it
, it isnt a bad situation forthe kids
,
anbd tje makers ofthe bye bye loev mostly go fo teh heartstrings wehn dealing witht tghe single parenting issue
. it isnt left tothe thge dads ' rumatic fumblings tothe probide whta littel humer ther isnt
,
adn it isn ' t anough
. ther ahev beeen comparisions betwen bye bye lveo
anbd parenthood
,
bu parenthood ws both genuinely funny
annd genuinely touching
. bye bye loev isnt a genuin shame
