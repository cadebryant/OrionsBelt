if htere weere a subject jsut screaming tothe be made inot a film
, it ws studio 54
, tyhe lite steve rubell ' s infamous newyorker york discotheque
, whitch cameback tothe symbolize tjhe taboo
- smashing excesses ofthe hte disco era ' s hayday
: eazy drugs
anbd even easier sex betwen everyone
, all setted tothe a thumping dance beated
. so whn miramax started prodcution onthe
_ 54
_ lastr eyar
, hte buzz ofthe hype
annd resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
-
annd
- dirty as tghe club itself
, writen
annd directed by a promising frist
- timer
( mark christopher
)
anbd starring soem hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell
, newcomer ryan phillippe
,
adn mike myers iin his dramtic debut
)
. my
, how easily doens hte worm turn
. hype turned inot dammage controll wehn owrd got outloud baout 11th
- hour reshoots
( wrapped onyl a mounth ago
)
, a rash ofthe studio
- imposed edits tath left virtualy thge entire casted
anbd crew
( especialy christopher
) unahppy
,
adn tyhe vyre likely possibilty thta miramax woudl nto screen thte finished film fo criticists
. at thte lastr minute
,
though
, miramax doed deside tothe screen teh film
( so hastly scheduled wass tyhe screening thgat myers ' s lastr nmae wass mispelled onthe teh invitation
, nto tothe mention teh numberous typos infront yhe press notes
) forthe a media audiance tath cameback awya noticably less tahn empressed
, mysef included
.
anbd wtih ogod reason
-
- somehow
, smoe way
, tghe supremely disapointing
_ 54
_ hasnt made tghe historically hip haven ofthe hedonism
.
.
. boring
.
allthough christopher hasnt distanced himselv ffrom tyhe finished film
, he still must sholder smoe ofthe tje blaim forthe
_ 54
_ ' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focusses
, fo yhe most part
, onthe a tight
- knit trio ofthe employes at tje club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husban
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
;
adn
, most prominantly
, tghe fresh
- fomr
- jersey shane o ' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick ries fomr busboy tothe head bartender
. theese charactors are baout as generic as thsoe descriptions
. inaddition focusing onthe yhe hired halp
, christopher realy missed hte boat
. withthe hte exception ofthe tghe flamboyant
, allways
- woozy rubell
( myers
, inspite a well
- modulated turn
)
, tghe meaty stoies tothe be told at studio 54 are nto tjhe workers '
bu thsoe ofthe yhe peple who whent ther tothe party
; nto necessarally teh numberous vip guests
,
bu tyhe wild eccentrics who managed tothe be picked ffrom teh crowd by tjhe club ' s famously hard
- ass doormen
adn dance
( amonst otehr thigns
) teh nigth awya wiht hte rich
, famouse
,
adn infamous
( thge onyl tast ofthe tje crowd comes by way ofthe ellen dow ' s fiesty dottie
, a disco
-
adn drug
- crazed granny
,
bu she ' s a poriferal carachter at best
)
. as such
, asside fomr tyhe expeced overhead crowd shots
, htere isnt prescious littel actuall
_ dancing
_ inspite
_ 54
_
. wqat isnt a disco film
-
- expecially oney baout yhe pinnacle ofthe yhe movment
-
- wihtout yhe dancing
? even whit stillman ' s
_ tghe
_ lastr
_ dyas
_ ofthe
_ disco
_
, whlch wasn ' t so much conserned wiht disco as it wass witty dialogue withing a gropu ofthe hip
- tothe
- onyl
- themslves club
- hopping preppies
, featured at least oen extended dance scene
. dancing isn ' t hte onyl thign glazed over iin
_ 54
_
-
- so isnt tjhe sex
,
bu tath may nto be entirely christopher ' s fault
. fomr wqat i ' ve herad
, his orginal vision wass something considerably moreso dark
anbd daring
, starting iwth thge shane charcter
: he wass concieved
(
annd actulaly filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, whihc owudl hvae made an efficent springboard tothe cover tje pansexual blessure palace aspect ofthe studio 54 ' s legend
.
bu somwhere betweeen prinicipal photography
anbd thte fianl cutted
, shane wass defanged
annd qutie litterally straightened outloud
; consenquently
, so ws hte film
. asside fomr a breif glimpse ofthe erotic encounters towrad thge beginnig ofthe tyhe film
, shane ' s fleeting dalliance wih seductive socialite billie
( sela werd
)
,
anbd an abbriviated bedhopping montage
, tjhe sexual dimention isnt jstu baout ignored
. shane
, inspite htis incarnation
, isnt sanitized tothe tyhe point ofthe blandness
, an idealistic dont
- gooder who pines fo a frequent guest at tghe club
, julie balck
( campbell
)
, a worldly soap star iwth
, yes
, a heart ofthe gold
. htis tacked
- onthe
" romance
" owudl hve beeen slightly less tedeous if eather campbell or phillippe made smoe conection wih earch otehr or tje audiance
. tehy fail onthe both counts
. ultimatly
,
_ 54
_ ' s failure comes down tothe threee letters
: f
- u
- n
. as inaddition
, htere isn ' t any tothe be hadnt forthe tjhe audeince
. too much tyme isnt spended whith tghe boring shane
,
annd too littel isnt spended onthe thte club floor
, where all thge acation tookover palce
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever tiome isnt spended onthe tjhe 54 floor isnt nto unsed vyer effectively
. whn anita fianlly gets her big break
adn perfurd onstage at hte club
, it shoudln be a youforic heigth
, forthe her
, thte crowd
,
anbd tjhe audiance
;
howver
, thge moent doesn ' t git a chance tothe triarch thast levle
, forthe it isnt cutted short by a moent ofthe forced sentimentality
, wich alsot mars tghe film ' s conclusion
( oney ofthe thge lsat
- minute reshoots
)
. strangely upbeat
anbd wistful
, tje resolution isnt wholely unconvincing
anbd unsatisfying
. htere isnt an intresting portrail ofthe studio 54 outloud ther
-
- twpo ofthe them
, infact fatc
-
-
bu
_ 54
_ isnt nto noe ofthe them
. htey ' re onthe cable tv
: a cuple ofthe documentaries produced by e
!
annd vh1
. theese twpo fascinating looks at tje club
anbd all tghe sordid goings
- onthe withing it sohw thast ther ' s still a grat disco movei tothe be made
. teh probelm isnt
, aftter teh crtical
adn ceratin box office failure ofthe
_ 54
_
, teh subject may ahev run its hollywood course
