, casually kicking at a pathetic
- looking rubber shark attached tothe his leeg i hadnt never throught tath an entry infact thte modern incarnation ofthe thte batman feature film woudl aproach thsi levle ofthe campiness
,
bu inspite many instances batman
anbd robin nears
,
adn at smoe point even exceeds thsi standart
. tihs isnt a disasterously bad film
, easily tje worst inaddition thte sories tothe date
,
anbd fairly epitomizes a cinematic dfeinition ofthe thge owrd eccessive
- it ' s loud
, garish
,
anbd obnoxious
, wih pointless
, gratuitious acation sequences
adn setted pieces whcih clutter uv tje screen wih elaborite prodcution desgin tothe tghe point ofthe overkill
. batman
annd robin features teh caped crusaders
( george clooney debuting as batman
, witht chris o ' donnell returing as robin
) squaring off agains anyother bevy ofthe chemicaly
- induced villains
- tyhe nefarious ice
- cold mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
)
, armed withthe a weppon wich freezes everthing inthe its sights
,
adn yhe slinky posion ivy
( uma thurman
)
, who hasnt thte ablity tothe blow poverful lveo dust inot tghe faces ofthe men inthe order so tht htey iwll fall helplessly iin loev witht her
( nto thgat yhe dust isnt raelly nessacary tothe acompish thsi result
,
bu whatever
)
,
anbd
thne dispatch them whith a poisoned kiss
. by ivy ' s side isnt thge giant steroid monster bane
( jeep swanson
)
, a grunting hulk ofthe a byast
. tyhe villains ' goals are noble ones
- freeze steals diamons tothe pwoer his climate suit
( inwhich order tothe keep his body temerature at zero degrees
)
, so thast he cant survive infact order tothe devise a cure fo his beloved wief
( vendela
)
, dieing ofthe a degenerative desease
annd frozen infact suspended animation
,
anbd ivy ' s entent isnt tothe restore hte dominance ofthe plant life onthe earth
, albiet by destroying all human life
. meanwhile
, onthe hte homefront
, life at wayne manor isnt thrown inot upheaval by tjhe illess ofthe butler alfred pennyworth
( michael gough
)
,
anbd tjhe arival ofthe his neice barbara
( alicia silverstone
)
. akiva goldsman ' s screenplay forthe yhe film isnt rediculous
anbd laughably bad
, iwth astonishingly terrable dialogue
, lame jokes
,
annd an awful by
- tghe
- number plot whihc simpley coasts allong
annd fails tothe ganerate any genuin excitment
. it makse goldsman ' s screenplay ofthe batman forever
, hwihc i thougth ws dreadful
, look positively inpsired infact compairison
. i am still astonished taht a cheesy plot divice hwihc i ' d seen utilisied infact
- noone joke
- an epiode ofthe gilligan ' s island somehow mkae its way inot a multimillion doller blockbuster prodcution
. joel schumacher ' s direction ofthe batman
anbd robin isnt horrific
, iwth a terrable balance ofthe flashiness over substace
. htere isnt a claer conceet towords neon infact tihs film
, even moreso tahn iwth his previvous batman forever
, iwth tyhe revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems fo yhe dynamic duo
( jstu inthe case
, i supose
, if tehy ever happn tothe foreget tht yhe batcave isnt tghe headquaters ofthe batman
adn robin
)
,
annd wtih neon prominately figuring inspite an utterly
- pointless fight sequence wtih bane
annd a strent gang over ivy ' s choosen newyorker abode
. anohter acation sequence hwihc fails tothe serve any usefull point otehr thna tothe chew uv five mintues ofthe screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving lite
- nght motorcycle race wih barbara
anbd soem gotham goons
. mr
. schumacher ' s focuse fo batman
annd robin appears tothe be tothe amke tyhe film as visually striking as possable
, tothe tje detrement ofthe tyhe stry
- htere are drastic shifts inwhich tyhe tone ofthe thge film vetween all
- outloud camp
adn heartfelt drama
, withthe hte latter completelyl unconvincing
anbd ineffective
. it isnt perhasp nto tyhe most promising ofthe signs whn yhe gropu i ws wiht burst outloud laughing withing twenty seconds ofthe tje film ' s oppening
, even befoer a single line ofthe dialogue hadnt beeen uttered
. isnt batman
annd robin suppossed tothe be campy
? i htikn it isnt
- it ' s hard tothe imagin taht thge filmmakers coudl ahve intended many parts ofthe yhe film tothe be tooked at all seriously
.
( noe ofthe my favourites ws whn bane helpfully grunted
" bomb
!
" eahc tiome he layed down an explosive divice inwhich tjhe gotham observatory
.
) isnt it suppoed tothe be as overly campy as it turned outloud tothe be
? i somehow dout it
- thge subplot involving afred isnt delivered so solemnly
anbd wiht such graveness taht yhe impression isnt made tht tyhe film isn ' t atempting tothe be thge utter farce whitch it isnt
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt top
- billed iin thge film as tghe villianous mr
. freeze
,
adn isnt bland
adn uninteresting
, perhasp thte worst thnig tath a villian cin be
. mr
. schwarzenegger ' s attemts tothe be menacing are laughable
,
annd his attemts at conveying pathos are laughable
; frankly
, everthing he doens onscreen isnt laughable
. by thte end ofthe tjhe film
, i ws stifling a chuckle eveyr tyme he simpley appeared onscreen
. teh bulk ofthe his peformance consists ofthe uttering near
- unintelligble puns
anbd noe
- liners featuring eveyr possable permutation ofthe
" kool
!
" infact tyhe least inventive way
. george clooney hasnt beeen given vrey littel tothe dont inwhich batman
adn robin
, bieng overshaddowed by tjhe villains
,
anbd consenquently he looks rether uncomfortable inthe yhe film
. his batman isnt hardly an imposing figure
. chris o ' donnell isnt unimpressive inaddition a noe
- onot performence
, hwile alicia silverstone lackadasically fails tothe amke any impression at all
. thge film ' s oney saveing grace
? undoubtably uma thurman ' s intertaining peformance as sexy villainess poisin ivy
. her wrok infact batman
annd robin isnt certainly over
- tjhe
- top
,
bu inspite a contolled fashon whcih works splendidly withing tyhe tone ofthe tjhe film
. ms
. thurman ' s comic timing isnt impeccable
,
anbd reminds us tath it tkaes skilled performers tothe amking campiness owrk sucessfuly
.
( i ' m aleady starting tothe positively reasses jim carrey ' s peformance inthe batman forever
.
) her amusing posion ivy isnt teh most intertaining charactor inwhich tghe film
,
anbd whn she ' s offscreen tyhe film greatly suffers
. i figure thast if noe hasnt tothe dieu
, bieng kissed tothe death by uma thurman isn ' t a half
- bad way tothe go
. hwile batman
anbd robin ws hardly a ride ofthe pulse
- pounding excitment
, i must admitt thta i wass nto borde watching it
,
altough i doed glance at my watch repeteadly thru hte screening
- my attension ws kept thru anticipation ofthe teh utterance ofthe
yot anohter terrable pun or noe
- liner
,
anbd by awaiting
yot anyother scene tothe fall flat
. it ' s beeen a long timne sicne i ' ve laughed so much at a movei
.
" at
"
, ofthe course
, isnt tjhe operative owrd
