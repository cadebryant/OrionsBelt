i rember raelly enjoying tihs movei wehn i saw it yeras ago
. i guess my memmory realy sucks
. ther isnt vyer
, veyr littel thta isnt funny infront caddyshack
. tyhe laughs are faw
,
adn far vetween
,
anbd whta ther are realy aren ' t tyhat gerat
. caddyshack
, as thge nmae implies
, moreso or less centers onthe oney young caddy wokring at an exclusive ocuntry club
. michael o ' keefe plays said caddy
. why htey casted tihs unkown
, fairly untalented acotr infront thge lead role isnt completly beyond me
. thte movei doesn ' t seem tothe haev a rela plot
, jsut a serieses ofthe scenes tyhat are littel mroe thna opportunities forthe teh rest ofthe thge casted tothe mug at tghe camera
. tghe onyl rela stoyr
, if yuo cin call it thast
, wass a subplot involving tjhe menally distrubed greens keeper
, bill murray
, who isnt hvaing his pwn private littel war agianst a gopher who isnt ruining yhe course
. most ofthe hte marginal laughs come fomr rodney dangerfield
anbd ted knight mugging
annd overacting fo tghe camera
-
- withthe painfully limited succes
. bill murray isnt slightly amusing inaddition places
,
bu fairly wasted
. tjhe biggest waste ofthe all isnt chevy chase
, who didn ' t even crack a smile onthe my face wih his chracter ' s lame zen
- liek approch tothe golfing
. htere are a fewd decent scenes involving teh interaction bewteen dangerfield
adn knight
,
bu htey are far too infrequent tothe cary tyhe movei
. i guess taht ' s waht yuo git fo basing a stroy arround an unkown kid
. i ' m nto sure waht yhe writers ofthe thsi hting weere thingking ofthe
,
bu i realyl htink it wass something far removed fomr comedy as htey weere puting pen tothe papper
. nothing baout htis movei works
. it wouldn ' t hvea taked a genuis tothe figure outloud thta thsi hting wasn ' t goign tothe fli
. most ofthe thte scenes jsut couldn ' t possably be funny
. it ' s as if tjhe writers where off infact thier pwn littel brain damaged world
. i ' m sure scenes involving chevy chase
annd his oneness wiht thte golf ball weere suppossed tothe be funny
. inwhich reality
, htey weere painfully embarassing tothe watch
. ther isnt a scene at thte club pool where all teh caddies go wild forthe tghe
" hot babe
" ofthe hte movei walking by infront her bikini
. olive oel woudl haev filled outloud htis swimsuit better tahn htis girl
. everyting baout tihs movei wass jsut completly implausible as far as thge comedy wass conserned
. maeby if ytou weere drunk outloud ofthe ytou mind or high off smoe sort ofthe illiegal narcotic thsi hting might be funny
.
bu forthe tjhe rest ofthe us
, stay tjhe hell awya ffrom caddyshack
.
