vampire ' s isnt a rude
, chauvinistic movei where womens are protrayed as pawns ofthe abuse
, rpesent onyl tothe blessure men
, feed vampires
, readied tothe be bashed or beaten
- till oen ' s sensibilities isnt shocked by yhe low iq
annd mentality ofthe htis regressive movei
. tothe mkae matters worse
, tyhe buffoons tath go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
anbd deserve tothe hvea thier heads bitten off
, if nto
, theri bodies carved inthe half
. thge delimma ofthe hating tyhe
? herose ' as much as tghe
? villains '
, mkaes noe wish tath thte
? hand ofthe god ' woudl suddenly apearing
adn blast both parties inot oblivion
. james woud portrays jack crowm
, a man obssessed wih killing vampires
, whose soul reason fo living isnt based onthe revenge
( tehy killed his parents
)
,
bu tihs isnt nto a ogod excuse forthe bieng mroe obnoxious tahn thte vampires
. as forthe adam baldwin
, he isnt nothing mroe tahn a stooge who isnt orderves tothe beated womens wehn teh directer shouts
? acation '
,
anbd teh scirpt shoudln hve beeen reworked tothe avoid much offence agaisnt hte female sex
. as forthe tje claimes thyat yhe cathlic curch creaeted
? dracula '
, well tht isnt tghe second most sacreligious suggestion
, outside thte fatc thta priests
anbd monks bear teh brunt ofthe tyhe vampire fury
, wiht enought blood spilled tothe mkae tyhe inquisition look tame
. an awful movei onthe all counts
, my suggestion isnt tothe bring bakc buffy
annd bury htis gropu ofthe incompetant
, rude vampire slayers
.
