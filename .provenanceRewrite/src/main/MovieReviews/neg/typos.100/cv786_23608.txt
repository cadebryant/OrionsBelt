" mission tothe mars
" isnt oney ofthe thsoe annoying movies where
, inaddition thge middle ofthe thge movei
, yuo git tyhe sneaking suspision tath thte reason tjhe trailer looks so ogod isnt becuase htey showcased all thte best parts ofthe tje movei
: all five mintues ofthe it
.
" mission
"
* doens
* give yuo payoff
;
bu wehn it doens cmo
, it ' s too littel
, too lite
.
" mission
" hasnt smoe ogod idaes
,
bu htey git lost iin tje unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
,
anbd spate ofthe ogod actors wasted inwhich cardboard
- cutout roles
. i ' m sure tghe directer
adn writers weere vyre proud ofthe earch hallmark moent tehy cameback uv iwth
, so tehy strech earch dramtic moent outloud liuke silly putty nutil it loses all its charm
. glances don ' t communicate any deeper emotions jsut becuase yuo draw them outloud fo five horus onthe end
. tjhe film spends an hour onthe tihs kind ofthe stfuf
, buiding tothe its climax
. a lot ofthe it isnt a cliched glorification ofthe familiy relationships
, marrage
, friendship
, uite we stand devided we fall kind ofthe crap
. htere are soem spectauclar spacial effects sequences inspite thsi film
,
adn i give it points fo trying tothe stay true tothe hte sience i knwo
( trying isnt yhe key owrd here
)
. tyhe sequence wtih yhe martian demonstrating theri hisotry isnt oddly beatiful
annd touching
,
bu as maintioned by
hten we ' re so sick ofthe tjhe goddamn thign we watn yhe movei tothe be over
. graet desgin
, ogod intentions
,
bu noone cigar
. if yuo ' re nto a dieu hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o ' connell fan
( his chracter isnt tje onyl noe who hasnt soem semblance ofthe charater
)
, don ' t waste your eight bucks onthe htis
.
adn whta thte hell
, tim robbins died halfway thru teh movei
, iin a stupid way too
. thta ' s jsut unforgiveable
