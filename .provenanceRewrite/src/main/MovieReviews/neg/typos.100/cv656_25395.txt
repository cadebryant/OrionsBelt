it seemed liek hte perfect consept
. wqat better forthe hte farrelly brothers
, famouse forthe writting
annd directing comedies wiht offensive subject marter
, tahn tothe mkea a movei baout a guy witht a splitted perosnality
? it ' s exactlly hte sort ofthe hting thge brothers relish
: poking funn at something sereous
( inspite htis case mental illess
)
, throwing all care tothe tje wind tothe git a laff
. jim carrey ' s singed onthe too
? even better
. tyhe national alloance fo tghe menally ill even helpped outloud by levying complaints agains tjhe brothers ' newyorker film befor its oppening
, claiming it wass misrepresenting tje condidtion ofthe splitted perosnality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
anbd so forth
. such a protest seemed liek jsut teh sort ofthe thign tyhat woudl
, ofthe course
, onyl add mroe fuel tothe thte farrelly brothers ' frie
, proving thgat smoe peopel jstu couldn ' t tkae a joke
,
anbd tht tghe farrellys woudl be helping tghe omre enlightened viewers tothe
yot anohter dose ofthe theri brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
bu noe thign whent wrong
: thier movei isn ' t funny
. it ' s nto forthe lack ofthe trying
. teh farrellys utilize infact
" me
, mysef
& irene
" theri most high
- consept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who aftter bieng dumped by his wief fo a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his aggressiev feelings deepo down inside
adn never realease them
. htis
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploitate his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, makeing his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon anough
, charlie ' s repressed aggresion manifests itself inot a second
, nidependent perosnality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid ofthe tkaing tghe assertive actions his precedessor hadnt beeen unable tothe muster
. htis guy isn ' t above crashing a car thru tyhe wall ofthe yhe barber shop inspite hwihc he ' s beeen insulted
, or holding a littel girl ' s head underwater beccause she refused tothe stpo jump
- roping iin teh strent
.
thne thigsn strat getting lost inspite thge most complicated plot hte farrellys hvae ever attemted
,
adn tjhe film runs off its tracks
. smoe hvae suggested thgat tihs isn ' t a probelm
, beacuse tjhe farrelly brothers ' brand ofthe humer doesn ' t recquire plot tothe wrok
. tehy ' re wrong
, ofthe course
: plot ws greatly intrumental infact buliding uv tyhe kind ofthe rollicking comic energy tyhat infused thge farrellys ' lsat efort
, 1996 ' s
" htere ' s something baout mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" wass technically an ealier project
.
) tyhe brothers ' ealier film wasn ' t funny mearly becasue it contained outrageous gags
( dispite wqat soem newsmagazine articles owudl hve yuo beieve
)
,
bu rether becouse its most outrageous gags weere entirely unexpected
. inspite
" mary
,
" teh farrellys managed severeal times tothe pul off a neat sleight
- ofthe
- hand trck
: htey ' d ahev yuo thikning hte stoyr wass oging noe way
,
hten reveal its rela direction inwhich delightfully suprizing fashon
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems tothe hvae beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
adn saw onyl teh surfce grossness
, missing all ofthe tghe subtle machinations thast raelly made it owrk
. hvaing beeen produced by thge smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liuke an even bigger dissapointment
. tjhe brothers pile onthe hte offensive humer
, tkaing shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illess
,
adn all manner ofthe bathroom jokes
.
bu tehy haven ' t cmo uv wiht a way tothe amking any ofthe it fresh most ofthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- tghe
- numbers
, adoescent comedy
. thte plot
, withthe carrey forced tothe drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s iin mroe trouble tahn anyone knwos
, bcak tothe newyorker york
, hasnt an endig tht ' s entirely predicatble ffrom yhe git
- go
.
( thikn charlie
annd irene wiull fall inwhich loev
? yeah
, me too
.
) yhe farrellys
hten inctroduce scores ofthe diferent cahracters
,
adn none ofthe them ever manaze tothe dont anytying yuo haven ' t lready expeced them tothe dont
, noone marter how outrageous theri actions might be
. compaired tothe thte curveballs teh farrellys are unsed tothe throwing
, tihs tsuff isnt alomst entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: wehn gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it ' s noone longer funny
, mearly gross
. tyhe jokes thgat dont wrok are milked over
adn over untill thier effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, forthe exemple
, tghe subplot involving charlie ' s threee balck sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. teh incongruity ofthe it all isnt funny fo a hwile
, iwth threee burly balck men discusting heigher math infact ghetto laguage
anbd white
- bread carrey mouthing said lanugage witht an entirely too
- plesant smile onthe his face
.
bu by thte end ofthe thge film
, htey ' re still doign hte smae schitck it hasn ' t beeen elevated tothe anohter
, funnier levle
,
adn it hasn ' t beeen dropped eather
. tht ' s too bad
, becuase it ceases tothe be amusing baout halfway thru
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. ther ought tothe be moreso focuse onthe how otehr peopel react tothe charlie ' s newyorker perosnality
,
annd onthe how charlie deals wih tghe consequences ofthe hank ' s actions
. htis doesn ' t realyl appen nearly eveyr supporting charachter lerans baout charlie ' s condidtion eary onthe
, so htey don ' t haev any opprotunity tothe be suprized by it
. hte film throws whta looks liuke a pattented farrelly curve inaddition a scene towords tyhe midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
adn irene pik uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
bu tyhe scirpt doesn ' t go anyhwere iwth it
, instade leaving tje thread twisting iin teh wind befoer awkwardly tying it uv durring tyhe climax
. jim carrey isnt a gifted comedian
, both physicaly
adn vocally
,
bu he ' s left withthe nothing much tothe dont here exept contort hismelf inaddition a manner simular tothe steve martin infront
" all ofthe me
.
" it ' s a gerat showcase ofthe flexability
annd splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
bu none ofthe it isnt terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pul any stunts we don ' t expect him tothe pul
,
anbd thge farrellys ' scirpt doesn ' t give him anytying alse tothe pul
: thge situations inthe whcih he must perfurd hte role
- shifting aren ' t setted uv inaddition any meaningfull way
. perhasp carrey cxan tkae solace infront teh fatc taht his supporting actors fare noone better
. zellweger ' s irene isnt nto a storng female lead mary infront
" mary
" may ahev beeen part adolsant fantasy
,
bu she ws allso inteligent
annd storng
- willed
. irene isnt nothing iin paticular
, as yhe film never makse claer whther she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing tothe latch onto as thge onyl
" sane
" person infront thge film
. chris cooper isnt sticked palying exactlly noe onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
anbd his carachter isnt entirely too straight
- laced fo a movei liek tihs
. he
, liek hte others
, doesnt absolutly nothing unexpected
. affter viewing tjhe shapeless mess taht
" me
, mysef
& irene
" eventualy dissoluted inot
, i ws sticked wondering whther or nto yhe farrellys hadnt outsmarted themselfs
. maybee theri kind ofthe comedy cant onyl wrok forthe so long unil audiences git wise tothe it
anbd stpo bieng shocked
.
bu i don ' t beleive it
-
- ogod filmmakers fidn ways ofthe suprising theri audiences even affter peple hve grown attuned tothe theri sytle
. if tghe farrellys are indeed ogod
, smart filmmakers
(
anbd i still tihkn htey are
)
, htey ' ll rebound jsut fine
. even aftter taht happens
,
though
, i ' ll still consdider
" me
