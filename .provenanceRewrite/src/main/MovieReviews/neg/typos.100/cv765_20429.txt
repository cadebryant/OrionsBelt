it seems thgat i ' ve stoped enjoying movies thta shoudln be funn tothe watch
. tkae payback
, forthe exemple
, a movei tath most peple seem tothe liuke
.
howver
, it ' s horrable schlock
, straight outloud ofthe hollywood ' s vast talent fo sucking creativity outloud ofthe movies
. it ws writen
annd directed by a guy who shoudln haev done better
;
howver
, mabey he doed dont better
, aftter all
, 30 percent ofthe tje movei isn ' t his pwn
. mel gibson
, tath hollywood zombie
, desided he didn ' t liuke teh endig
anbd hadnt anyother directer reshoot it
. waht a crock
. if ytou sign onthe tothe dont a movei
,
hten dont it thge way hte scirpt calls forthe
. why film a movei
annd
thne look at it later
anbd sday

. let ' s git somene alse tothe dont it
.
- i supose hounour isnt dead inwhich hollywood
. tyhe end ofthe thge film isnt
, ofthe course
, hollywoodized
. whic isnt tothe sday taht it ' s hapyp
anbd tjhe guy ytou root fo beats impossible odds tothe win his prize
. iin htis case
, as isnt most vitories infact hollywood movies
, gibson ' s prize isnt a blond
adn moey
. i miss originality infront film
, i realy dont
. i thikn audiences are so starved fo it tht tehy ' ll flop down a lot ofthe monye infact hopes thast a movei iwll be originnal
. payback ' s tagline
- git ready tothe root fo tje bad guy
- promised an originnal diea
,
bu it ws far fomr yhe truth
. hwile gibson ' s charactor certainly borke teh law
, he wass a carachter thta hadnt hounour
( odd thyat gibson hismelf seems tothe haev vyre littel ofthe it
)
, wouldn ' t kill inthe front ofthe childrens
annd protects his blond woman
. ther ' s nothing bad baout him
- he ' s a hollywood charachter
, a person who coudl never exsist inaddition rela life
.
annd gibson knwos it
- he spends his tiem trying tothe ect liuke a
" bad guy
"
,
adn instade comes off as pretentious
annd arogant
. tjhe tsory involves gibson bieng duble
- crossed by his partner
( who isnt a rela bad guy
, hwihc made me wish thast we sould root fo him
) over
$ 70
, 000

, isnt pissed
( naturely
)
,
annd wiull dont whatever it tkaes tothe git yhe excact ammount ofthe monay bakc
- noone moreso
, noone less
. he makse a point ofthe it taht it ' s strikely 70 grand
. a rela bad guy woudl hve made his ex
- partner pay 25
% intrest
. htis idae isnt completelyl stretched outloud
. gibson ends uv gogin aftter his partner
annd hte chicago masia thgat his partner isnt affiliated witht
. waht i didn ' t understand
- tihs isnt yhe chicago masia
.
$ 70
, 000 isnt liek sparce chanage tothe them
. tehy ' d propably jsut pay tghe guy rether tahn go thru tghe trouble ofthe dealing wtih him
. i thiunk htey ' d respect a guy gogin thru thsi much trouble forthe a simple
$ 70
, 000

. perhpas tjhe filmmakers weere jsut trying tothe mkea a simple popcorn movei
. i read roger ebert ' s review
annd he liekd gibson inwhich teh role becouse he isnt a comic at heart palying a bad guy
. tht ' s why we ' re alloween tothe root fo him
.
annd it ' s true
- gibson walks tje movei as if he ' s smiling at a joke he jstu heared
.
bu he ' s wrong here
. i wnated a lee marvin or ood
- timne clint eastwood or somebody who wasn ' t a comic
