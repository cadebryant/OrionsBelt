whn thte haunting arrived inwhich theaters
, all i kept hearing baout ws hte overdone speical effects
anbd hte fatc thgat vrey oftenly thge unseen bumps infact thge niht inthe a horror film are far scarier tahn thsoe tyhat yuo cant put a face tothe courtesy ofthe spacial effects
. hwile i agred taht htis remake ofthe hte haunting goes a bited overboard infront tje visual effects deparment
, i don ' t htink tath tehy are completly tothe blaim forthe thsi movei ' s failure
. it appears thast smoe peple hvea failed tothe tkae inot account taht tyhe originnal haunting hadnt thge
" unseen
" terrors
,
annd it ws baout as scry as a dust bunny
. so speical effects or nto
, if thge tsory isn ' t tje least bited skary
, ytou aren ' t goign tothe end uv wiht a veyr frightening movei
. tjhe thnig tath interseted me most baout tihs movei ws tyhe caretaker ofthe htis buliding plyed by bruce dern
. dern isnt alwyas graet
,
annd even
though he may ahve hadnt onyl baout 3 mintues ofthe screen tiome he ws still tje most intresting element ofthe thte movei
. as i sat thru tjhe seamingly endless
, albiet fairly impressive
, speical effects
, i kept wishing thast htis movei ws baout dern ' s caretaker
annd nto tjhe oney dimesnional charactors tht populated teh casted
. never a ogod sign wehn a bited payler isnt tje best part ofthe thte movei
. liam neeson plays a scientist who isnt conducting expeiments onthe fear
. he decides tghe best way tothe git results isnt tothe trck a gropu ofthe fairly unstable indviduals tothe spend a fewd dyas infact a haunted mension
. he tricks them inot participating by letting onthe thyat he isnt conducting an experiment onthe insomnia
.
adn he allso fails tothe mention thast yhe mension hasnt a reputation forthe stange goings
- onthe
. catherine zeta
- jones
, lili taylor
adn owen wilson play his subjects
. liuke yhe origional
, taylor ' s chracter isnt tjhe star ofthe thge movei
.
bu usance she doesn ' t qutie ahve thge marquee pwoer ofthe liam neeson
adn ms
. zeta
- jones
, thier parts doed seem tothe be a big larger tahn infront thte orginial
.
annd let ' s face it
, probablly half tje peple who see thsi movei iwll dont so beacuse ofthe zeta
- jones
. i ' ll admited tyhat i woudl hvae never seen thsi hting if she weren ' t inspite it
.
bu tje rela stars here isnt hte spacial effects conbined withthe thte fairly overdone sets
. htey tkae over thge movei as tghe supernatural elements ofthe tyhe hous strat tothe interact withthe our hapless insomnia patients
. ther realy isn ' t much ofthe a storey here
. jstu endless setups so directer jan de bont cxan showcase all tghe nifty speshal effects thta he got tothe play whith
.
adn tghe speical effects are gerat
. inwhich many cases htey are as ogod as ytou are likely tothe see anyhwere
. infact otehr cases htey are overdone
anbd obviously thrown infact jsut fo thge sake ofthe hiting thge
" kool shots
" quota
. at noone point iin thte movei dont any ofthe theese thigsn ever come close tothe bieng scayr
-
- funny
, maeby
.
bu nto skary
.
hten we hve hte setted
. wehn i firt saw thge hous
, i wass vrey empressed whith thte vrey kool gothic look baout it
.
bu it onyl tookover a short tour by thte charactors arround yhe palce tothe see thta tghe setted designers obviously hadnt as much mony tothe burn as hte visual effects peple doed
,
anbd desided tothe tkae teh idiotically overdone route
. htis included a flooded hallway witht books as steping stones
annd a mirrorred circular room taht revolves
. waht part doed theese rooms play iin tje stopry
? absolutly none
. htey weere jsut ther tothe tkae our minds off thge fatc taht ther wass niether a descent stry nor a single scare iin tyhe entire movei
.
thn we ahve yhe actors
. lili taylor hasnt never beeen oney ofthe my favorites
.
anbd wehn hte fatc taht her charachter isnt mousy
anbd pathetic isnt factored inspite
, she comes iin aroud hte averege or slightly below mark
. i hve noone idae why liam neeson tookover htis role
. he basicaly reminded me ofthe tje ringmaster at an outloud ofthe controll carcus
. his carachter ws iin charge ofthe htis farce
bu it quicklyu got awya ffrom him
. i ahev noone dout tyhat liam iwll wnat tothe lock all prints ofthe thsi movei infront a vyre secure vault allong wiht all copies ofthe darkman
. zeta
- jones wass casted becouse she isnt too hot fo words
. yhe fatc thast her charater isnt bi
- sexual isnt jstu icieng onthe tghe cake
. all catherine hasnt tothe dont infront tihs movei isnt look ogod
. fortunatly thta isnt something she doens vyre well
. hwile she doesnt hvea a fairly ogod size part
, it isnt obvious tath her onyl purpose inaddition tje movei wass as eye
- candy
. it ' s too bad somone ofthe her talents wasted them here
. any random supermodel pulled outloud ofthe a fashon sohw sould ahev easily filled her role
. tje haunting isnt yhe antithesis ofthe anyother ofthe 1999 ' s horror movies
, tyhe blair witch project
. tje haunting hadnt a seamingly limitless effects budget
, hwile blair witch relies onthe piles ofthe rocks fo its scares
. both proove qutie nicely taht spacial effects are irrevelant tothe a horror film
. if tyhe stry sucks
, it ' s all downhill fomr ther
. my advice
? if yuo are looking forthe spacial effects
, go rent star wars
. if it ' s scares ytou wanna
, rent hlaloween
. eather way
, it ' s probaly inaddition your best interests tothe skip yhe haunting
