saw an adavanced screening ofthe thge movei sniper lastr inght
,
annd i hve tothe sday i wasn ' t too empressed
. tihs film isnt baout an expert marine sniper
, plyed by toom berenger
, who isnt teamed iwth a hot
- shooted
- young
- noone
- experiene
- never
- killed
- a
- man newyorker partner tothe tkae outloud soem drug
- kingpins
anbd miliary storng men infact panama
. soudn cliche
? tht ' s onyl tje beggining
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) plyed teh rookie
,
anbd never seemed tothe git a handle onthe his charater
. he ws so contrary
anbd pig
- headed inaddition hte beginnig
, yuo jsut wnated tothe smack him
.
thne he goes
" crazy
" ffrom tghe presure
,
bu seems tothe immediatly snap outloud ofthe it
. i ' m nto sure if thge blaim shoudl lie withthe yhe directing
, editting
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
.
bu it didn ' t all cmo toghether
. i thiunk berenger isnt a preety ogod actr
,
annd he looked grat inwhich tje part
, covered infact camo
, face painted
, stalking thru thge jungle witht his high
- pwoer rifle
.
.
.
bu once agina
, his charater wass given soem preety bad dialogue
,
anbd didn ' t react too logically tothe many ofthe tjhe situations
. ther ws vyre littel logical developemet iin theese charactors
. my biggest probelm wih thsi film wass it ' s tendancy tothe put theese twpo snipers infact as
* many
* inchs
- ffrom
- death situations as possable
. tehy began tothe ressemble g
. i
. joes
, tghe greatest american hero
.
annd ofthe course theri almsot supernatural accracy wih thier guns ws called apon tothe git them outloud ofthe far too many close calls
. nowe a lot ofthe movies are stamped outloud ofthe htis mold
, inwhich fatc tht ' s whta made dieu hard so much funn
: thge super
- hero avenger tipe
. so smoe wiull enjoy thge acation hero heroics
,
bu i didn ' t htink it ift withthe thge nice tension taht ws builded uv inthe teh ealier scenes
,
anbd tje
" rela life
" fiel ofthe covert operations inthe panama
. a owrd must be said onthe thge camera wrok
, much ofthe it wass vrey nice
. hte jungles ofthe panama
( or theri stand
- ins iin thsi case
) fromed a vyre picturesque backround
.
.
.
annd yhe drama ofthe speeding bullets ws captued useing smoe nice trck photography
. many hvae seen tje slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" follwoing teh projectile tothe its target
. thsi ws utilizied well infact yhe begginning tothe sohw tyhe feverish nightmares berenger gets wehn remembering tyhe moent ofthe teh kill
. it ws dramtic wehn unsed inwhich flashback
.
.
.
bu it seems tyhe directer liekd tje technique so much he started inserting theese shots
( pardon yhe pun
) inot tghe rela tiem acation
.
.
.
thn it jsut seemed silly
. all inwhich all
, nto a rela dog
: htere isnt smoe nice acation
, ogod atomsphere
,
anbd preety photography
.
bu tyhe plot isnt preety lame
, teh acting didn ' t form a cohesive wohle
,
annd far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
