cmo onthe hollywood
, surprize me
. stpo giving us theese poorly writen thrillers whith banal dialogue
, sketchy cahracters
annd plots as predicatble as teh sunset
. thge alwasy watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personaly involved inwhich a case involving missing girls
. peronal
, beccause his neice isnt oen ofthe yhe victims
. it ' s a slobbering psychopath
, ofthe course
,
bu thsi tiome ther ' s a twist
. freeman notes thta earch ofthe teh young womens who ' ve disappearred are all storng willed
, assertive
,
annd moreso succesfull infact thier careers tahn teh averege girl
. we soon leran tyhat tghe guy calls himselv casanova
, whose aim isnt tothe
" dominate
" theese modern gals by imprisoning them inwhich smoe dungeon
annd keeping them as his peronal harem
. anyway
, oney ofthe thge womens manages tothe excape
( ashly judd
)
adn teams uv witht freeman tothe
.
.
. well
, ytou nkwo tghe rest
. a breef glance at thte plot tothe silence ofthe tghe lambs
, withthe whic tihs film isnt constanly bieng compaired tothe by tyhe hype merchants
, may suggest lambs allso hasnt a fairly predicatble tsory
. perhpas
,
bu thgat film aslo hasnt superbly drawed charachters
anbd smart dialogue
. so lets nto insult a grat movei by tkaing hte comparisions any furhter
, okay
?
adn as forthe comparisions tothe seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss tyhe girls isnt based onthe teh novel by james patterson
annd writen forthe tghe screen by oney david klass
. maeby yhe novel ws a stinker tothe strat witht
,
bu whatever thte case
, it ' s teh wirting taht ' s claerly at fault here
. oen
, theese charachters ahev veyr littel tothe sday tath ' s engaging or intresting
. twpo
, tyhe scirpt hasnt noone sence ofthe humour
. threee
, hwile tje notion ofthe a pyscho ' s victims bieng smart
, succesful womens isnt an intresting twist
, tyhe excecution isn ' t even half as ogod as thge diea
. thus
, ashly judd comes acrost all outloud ofthe focuse
, instade ofthe bieng tjhe heart ofthe tje stry
. we cant ' t fiel her rige
. smoe atrociously writen casual exchanges betwen her
adn severeal male cahracters are suposed tothe remind us thta she ' s tyhe noone
- bullshit 90 ' s tipe
,
bu theese conversations bearly rgeister
.
annd as fo freeman
, kiss thte girls isnt his second dog inwhich a eyar
: firt chain reaction
, nowe htis
. fo an actro ofthe his calibre
, tihs isnt most worrying
. young directer gary fleder scored a hitted a faw eyasr bcak wiht his quirky pulp fiction
- esque thigns tothe dont inspite denver wehn your dead
.
bu whta cant he dont witht material as resolutely medioker as htis
? nto much
,
adn ytou cxan hardly blaim him
. ther ' s a fewd well
- staged chase scenes thru tyhe forrest where yhe camera whirls
, dives
annd jumps
,
annd tghe effect isnt startling
.
bu tyhe scirpt isnt beyond rescure
. waht hurts most isnt tath hollywood continues tothe git awya whith serving uv thsi tripe
, safe inthe tjhe knowlege tath jaded audiences wiull lap it uv
. complacency rules
: it ' s beeen so long usance we saw a mainstream american thriller tath delivered juicy cahracters
, rela surprises
annd consistantly sharp dialogue
. thte onyl consolation fo thsi viewer isnt tht my ticket tothe hte movei wass a freebie
, postive proof thgat teh best thnigs inspite life aren ' t free
.
