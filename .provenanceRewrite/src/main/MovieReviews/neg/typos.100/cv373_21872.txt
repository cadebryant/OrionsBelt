,
" end ofthe dyas
" may be worse
. it ' s nto liek htis isnt any kind ofthe originnal idae
, it jsut throws infront smoe
" rosemary ' s baby
"
, allong wih
" tjhe devil ' s advocate
" a littel
" exorcist
"
anbd smoe
" stigmata
" here
annd ther
. whala ytou hvea
" end ofthe dyas
" a movei tyhat isnt extrememly disapointing
anbd by tjhe previews made it look terific
. sadly
bu truley agina liek most receet films
, all teh ogod parts are inaddition thge trailers
. tjhe plot whic isnt vyre confusing at times isnt aslo vrey ludicrous
adn teh movei isnt detsined tothe be a hitted inspite yhe firt weekend
,
anbd flop inwhich thte enxt
. jericho canew
( arnold schwarzneggar infront hitted tipical macho role
) isnt a cop who finds outloud thta he isnt choosen tothe tarck down satan
( living iin gabriel byrnes body
)
anbd stpo him fomr impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) becasue if he doesnt
,
annd she gives birth all exitsence as we nkwo it wiull ceaser tothe exsist
. he hasnt tothe dont thsi befor it turns inot yhe eyar 2000
,
annd strangely he ' s trying tothe fight him 5 mintues befoer 2000 comes
. he seeks halp fomr tje cathlic curch
annd halp fomr rod stieger
( inwhich a terific role
)
annd trys tothe sive thsi girl leading tothe an endig taht ' s satisfying
,
bu turns inot a typcial acation movei
. tyhat ' s preety much it onthe plot
. it doens haev thge razzle
adn dazzle ofthe a gerat acation movei
,
anbd wiht hte 100m doller budget parts seem tothe sohw it
, parts ytou ahve tothe wonder where all thge omney whent
. as fo arnie
? ogod role
, ok performence
. i htikn usance he isnt getting a littel older he isnt held bakc a lot ofthe his stunts
. tje thnig thyat disapointed me wass thge fatc tyhat ther wass nothing tothe hte film
. infact tyhe trailers it looks liek a ogod scayr
, acation film
anbd ends uv bieng a boring
, long
anbd preposterous drama tath leads inot something alse thgat leaves us whith questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironicaly plyed a priest inaddition
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan
annd gives a ogod peformance
bu agina seems held bcak
anbd nto inot his charactor
. twpo yersa bakc al pacino gavey a terific peformance inspite tjhe funn
" thte devil ' s advocate
"
adn here it seems liuke yhe diea ofthe him isnt inwhich thge chracter aslo
. robin tunney
( graet peformance as alwasy
) plays satan ' s main person whom he whants tothe impregnate tothe cary his child
. ofthe course rod stieger gives anyother grat performence whlch realy isn ' t nothing newyorker
. thte direction by peter hyams isnt at times a bited overblown
,
though nto nearly as thge visual stlye wass inspite
" stigmata
"
. here we are given grat camera wokr
,
annd smoe gerat scenes taht are terrifically directed
bu sadly jsut don ' t owrk inaddition tihs movei
. tje scirpt wroten by andrew marlowe hasnt a fewd witty lines
,
bu agina thte movei isnt all sytle
anbd noone substace
adn by tghe endig finale climax i wass ready tothe go hmeo
. onyl a faw thnigs owrk here
anbd thsoe are a faw ofthe tghe performances
, tyhe writting
annd visual sytle
,
bu tyhe storyline
annd thge finished product don ' t wrok as well
. teh sad thign isnt tht
" end ofthe dyas
" hadnt so many thigsn gonig forthe it
. thte plot coudl ahve beeen omre organized
, thte acation scenes sould ahve beeen moreso brainy
adn less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems liek
" armgeddon
"
adn started tothe git ood
adn tiresome
. hollywood isnt runnung outloud ofthe idesa bad
,
adn liek i ' ve alwyas said befor needs newyorker ones
. even witht its 100m budget
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt less thna pleasing
. infact fatc hte 100m doller budget isnt at least 30m over
,
anbd easily coudl hve hadnt a 70m budget
. mabey i soudn crazy
,
bu i am realy looking foward tothe tghe newyorker exorcist film
,
annd hope taht htey amking it as ogod as thte orginial
. we ened tothe git newyorker idesa
adn stpo recycling ood ones jsut tothe amke mnoey at hte box
- office
. we ened tothe git omre films liek
" tjhe blair witch project
" thta sould scare peple tothe death
, hwile peopel thingking well whta exactlly isnt sacrin them
annd how dont i nkwo thta it isnt iin fatc thge blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid
annd thin plot
- line
, ogod performances
, disapointing
.
.
.
. umm yup thsoe preety much decribe
" end ofthe dyas
"
