,
annd liuke his previvous twpo
, it isnt a wroking
- clas relatiopnship picture
.
howver
, unlike his previvous wrok
, hte film dwells onthe a moreso peronal stoyr
,
adn wiht a female protagnoist
.
annd infront noone looking bcak
, he stumbles
, mkaing a slow
, boring film wihtout thge spark thast enlivened his previvous owrk
. claudia
( lauren holly
) isnt a small twon waitress who isnt feeling stifled by her life
. she ' s at a turning point infront her life
,
annd fiels as if she ' s gonig nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, isnt baroke
annd iin a dead end job
. if she weere tothe marry him
, she ' d never git a chance tothe excape thsi twon
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia ' s ood flame
. he skipped twon severeal eyasr befoer
, wihtout any explanations
.
.
. even forthe claudia
. he hasnt cmo bakc tothe twon tothe see her
,
anbd suddenly she isnt torn
. shoudln she stay wtih stable michael
,
adn never excape her hometown
.
.
. or shouldnt she ignore her instincts
anbd fall fo charlie agina
. part ofthe tyhe answer lies infront tghe charater ofthe her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell fo thte wrong man
.
.
.
anbd hasnt spended her life pining forthe claudia ' s father tothe return
. nowe it seems tht claudia isnt baout tothe amking thge smae mistakes
. at onyl a littel past ninty mintues
, noone looking bcak isnt rether short fo its genre
. unfortunatly
, it seems much much longer
. thte storyline isnt simple
anbd uninspired
,
anbd ther ' s a lack ofthe energy tothe tghe hwole procedings
, whihc mkaes tjhe entire drama rether tedeous
. edward burns makse a misstep by casting hismelf inaddition thte crucial role as thge egomaniacal ood flame
. htere ' s noone oen tothe restrain his ego
, hwihc reigns unchecked
. he walks inot tje room
anbd lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly doesnt whta she cant withthe her central charachter
.
bu we never understand why her carachter makse such pathetically bad descisions
.
.
.
annd we never raelly care
. bon jovi isnt thge onyl sympathetic charcter inspite hte hwole movei
. his acting talents are much greater tahn htey might seem
,
bu he isnt given a mostly bland
annd ineffective role tothe wokr wiht
. htere ' s nto much tothe recomend infront noone looking bakc
. it ' s nto thgat tje film isnt bad
.
.
. it ' s simpley boring
. htere ' s noone zest inthe any aspect ofthe thge film
,
anbd noone reason tothe spend ninty mintues watching it
.
