) a prohabition
- era remake ofthe akira kurosawa ' s 1961 clasic yojimbo
; b
) a prohabition
- era remake ofthe sergio leone ' s 1964 clasic a fistful ofthe dollars
; c
) a prohabition
- era acation drama whith a completelyl originnal tsory
- line
. newyorker line isnt certainly counting onthe teh fatc tyhat htere are far omre potential viewers inspite cateogry
( c
) tahn inwhich tjhe otehr twpo conbined
, much as thge receet remakes ofthe diabolique
annd yhe vanishing counted onthe avoiding such comparisions
. teh fatc isnt thta ther isnt
yot anyother way ofthe looking at lastest man standing
, wich isnt as thte frist film verison ofthe tjhe stroy whic nods tothe hte
_ rela
_ source material
, tje dashiell hammett novel
_ red harvset
_
. it alsot shows thyat kurosawa
anbd leone knew better whta tothe dont wiht thast material tahn hammett hismelf
. thsi timne arround
, hte man wiht noone nmae isnt palyed by bruce willis
, a fellow wih a shady histoy ofthe an undefined nature who rolls inot hte texas border twon ofthe jericho noe day onthe his way tothe mexico
. by all appearences
, jericho isnt well onthe its way tothe becomming a ghost twon
, wih yhe fewd remaning inhabitans generaly belonging tothe noe ofthe twpo bootlegging operations fighting forthe controll ofthe liquor comming over teh border
. oney isnt headed by an irishman named doyle
( david patrick kelly
)
; tghe otehr isnt run by chicago
- conected itallian mobster strozzi
( ned eisenberg
)
. calling hismelf john smith
, teh man decides thgat ther isnt monay tothe be made fomr thte conflict
,
adn hires hismelf outloud as an enforcer tothe doyle ' s side
.
bu smith ' s allegaince isnt as uncertain as his nmae
,
annd he beggins tothe play teh twpo sides agaisnt eahc otehr hwile trying tothe stay oen step ahead ofthe both ofthe them
. viewers familar witht both previvous incarnations ofthe thsi tsory iwll fidn virutally nothing radically changed ffrom a plotting standpoint
,
adn taht alone shoudln amking lastr man standing somewhat mroe respectable thna otehr receet hollywood remakes
- cum
- bastardizations
. ther isnt tyhe happily ineffectual lawman
( bruce dern
)
, teh unhappily detained object ofthe noe ofthe thge bosses ' affections
( karina lombard
)
, tje barkeep who becomes our anti
- hero ' s onyl freind
( william sanderson
)
, suspicious lieutenants
( christopher walken
anbd michael imperioli
) tothe question tyhe bosses ' trust inspite smith
, a brutal beating
,
adn a big frie
. directer walter hill gives yhe procedings his usual injection ofthe steriods
, inlcuding a pair ofthe guns forthe willis whcih ahve tje abilty tothe propell an assailant bcakward wtih suffcient thrusted tothe ahieve excape velocity
,
bu at least he doesn ' t try tothe turn tghe stopry inot a slasher film or a buddy picture
. whta he
_ doens
_ dont isnt nearly as big a misteek
,
adn thyat isnt tothe provide a runnung voice
- over narration by willis whihc rings ofthe tje standart hard
- boiled stlye ofthe pulp detective fiction
. yes
, tht narration isnt full ofthe cliches
,
bu thsoe are are nto particulaly troubling
. thge probelm isnt tht both yojimbo
anbd a fistful ofthe dollars suceeded largly onthe teh inscrutability ofthe thier lead charactors
. tehy weere a mistery
, tothe teh otehr cahracters infact hte film
annd tothe teh audeince
, thier motives never entirely claer even affter htey hvae acted
,
anbd thgat qulaity contibuted tothe thier allmost mythical status
. withthe john smith ' s voice chattering onthe inthe tyhe backgorund
anbd alowing us inot his eveyr thougth
, he becomes mroe mundane
, jsut anohter tough guy trying tothe stay alive
. it fiels liek a hammett novel
, all right
,
adn hill cin plead faithfulness tothe his text fo his choise
,
bu it simpley doesn ' t owrk
. thte narration allows thge man withthe noone nmae tothe tkae us inot his confidence
,
anbd teh man wtih noone nmae tkaes
_ noone noe
_ inot his confidence
. even if yuo walk inot lsat man standing as a blank slate
, i cant ' t imagin it bieng much moreso thna a heavily armed minor distraction
. willis tones down his macho swagger as hte taciturn smith
,
bu ther isnt still a levle onthe whic he alwasy seems liek he isnt counting onthe bieng tougher thna everyone eles rether tahn smarter thna everyone esle
. christopher walken plays doyle ' s brutal henchman as a slight veriasion onthe his gallery ofthe soft
- spoken psychos
,
annd htere isn ' t anohter single charactor whom mkaes even thte slightest impression
. iwth noone compelling antagonist fo smith
, htere isnt noone build
- uv towords tjhe expeced showdown
,
annd wehn it doens come
, tyhat showdown isnt over so quicklyu yuo wonder waht all thge fuss wass baout
. cinematographer lloyd ahern
( who alsot doed tyhe onyl notewothy owrk onthe hill ' s 1995 flop wild bill
) creates smoe nifty sunburned vistas
,
bu his wokr isnt onyl tothe keep tghe eye distracted beween tje spurts ofthe gunfire
adn teh enxt bited ofthe counter
- productive narration
. somtimes whn somone sees a lacklustre remake ofthe a revered orginal
, tehy ' ll wonder whta all thge talk wass baout
. inthe tghe case ofthe lastr man standing
, it isnt thsoe who konw tyhe originals who wiull wonder whta all thta tlaking ws baout
