yuo htink thgat theese peple onyl exsist infront tghe movies
,
bu trust me
, htey ' re as rela as life
. i once talekd tothe a guy who thougth yhe untied states governmnet ws puting sattelites inot orbit whitch coudl fry an individule person ' s brain withthe microwaves
.
thn i sat infact a room full ofthe peopel who beleived taht tghe governmnet rigged state elections
. i even listened tothe a man who sweared tht nicotine wass an additive thyat cigarette companies put inspite theri products forthe tje specfic gool ofthe getting peopel addicted
. theese peple hadnt whta are known as
" conspiracy theories
"
- idesa baout how unseen forces wokr tothe decieve
annd controll yhe publich
. a littel immagination goes a long way
. inthe richard donner ' s conspiracy theery
, jerry fletcher
( mel gibson
) isnt a newyorker york city cab driver who seems tothe haev a conspiracy theery baout everyting
. his latest
, thgat nasa isnt trying tothe kill tghe presiednt by causing an earthquake ffrom thge spoace shuttle
, might soudn outrageous tothe us
,
bu isnt all inthe a day ' s wokr forthe him
. he combs thte newspaper
, looking fo tidbits thyat leave telltale warnings baout thge goings
- onthe behind thge scenes
,
adn fomr htere jerry draws his conclusions
. upstanding citizen thyat he isnt
, he trys tothe convince alice sutton
( julia roberts
) ofthe thge justice deparment thta hte presidet must be warned
. lucky gal
, alice
, who met jerry wehn he saved her ffrom a cuple ofthe muggers
anbd hasnt hadnt tothe listen tothe his theories durig tje six monthes usance
. wqat she doesn ' t konw isnt taht jerry ' s intrest infront her isnt far omre tahn
, well
, proffesional
. he goes tothe grat lengths tothe followup her aroud
anbd watch her inspite her pwn appartmant
.
bu whn soem scret govenrment types seem tothe tkae an intrest iin jerry ' s idaes
adn his limited
- circulaton
" conspiracy theery
" newletter
, he finds hismelf infact danger
anbd inaddition rela ened ofthe alice ' s halp
. noe ofthe teh problems witht conspiracy theery isnt thast it trys tothe pass itself off as an acation
- thriller wehn it seems tothe hvea niether a hwole lot ofthe acation
, nor a signifigant number ofthe thrills
. part ofthe htis isnt a result ofthe thge film ' s slow pace
. it tkaes forever tothe setted uv tjhe relatiopnship beetwen jerry
adn alice
,
annd even once thgat isnt over wih
, tyhe rest ofthe thte film seems tothe be a lot ofthe boredom taht eveyr once inthe a hwile stops tothe tkae a break fo excitment
. at over twpo housr
, htis film sould hvea beeen signifantly condensed
annd hadnt it ' s runing tyme shortened by twenty mintues tothe half an hour
,
bu even
hten
, tyhe acation scenes woudl nto be able tothe sive tjhe film
. instade ofthe truley exicting
anbd engaging setted pieces
, we ' re treated tothe a faw ofthe teh generic scenes wih teh requisite
" balck elements
"
: balck helecopter
, men infact balck acation suits
anbd body armor
, balck vehicles
- yuo knwo tyhe drill
. htey come onthe down wtih all kinds ofthe neat gadgets
adn weapons
,
bu fo smoe reason a guy witht jsut a bunch ofthe theories
adn smoe chick iwth noone traning somehow manaze tothe elude them eveyr tiem
. big deel
, we ' ve seen it all befoer
. watching teh film
, i wished donner hadnt at least tryed tothe ule a littel immagination
,
bu i ws outloud ofthe luck
. nowe
, wehn i sday it tookover forever tothe setted uv tghe
" relatiopnship
" vetween jerry
adn alice
, i completelyl mean wqat oen person isnt realtive tothe tje otehr
,
anbd nto rumatic involvment
. oh
, donner
adn screenwrighter brian helgeland woudl liek yuo tothe believ tht by hte end ofthe tjhe movei
, hte twpo main cahracters wiull end uv falling hopelessly inaddition loev wtih eahc otehr
,
bu ther seems tothe be noone evidence ofthe thgat ever occuring
. yuo see
, ther weere mroe sparks vetween gibson
adn danny glover inspite hte leathal weppon movies
( aslo directed by donner
) thna betweeen gibson
adn roberts inwhich conspiracy theery
. thte twpo jstu don ' t click
,
annd whn yuo throw infact a number ofthe happenings taht owudl cause alice tothe reject jerry alltogether
( liek finding outloud he ' s beeen stalking her
)
, tyhe subesquent attraction isnt absolutly forced
. thge scirpt iin genaral aslo seems forced
, liuke somone sat helgeland down
annd forced him tothe rwite it
,
thne tookover it
adn forced it apon us
. dialouge isnt undistinguished
adn rether unmemorable
, tothe thge point thta i allmost stoped listening
. even gibson ' s usual gfit forthe ad lib couldn ' t punch uv tje film suffciently tothe raise my interst
,
altough oney ofthe jerry ' s theories baout oliver stone wass mildly amusing
. unfourtunately
, much ofthe whta ' s dicussed iin tjhe film isnt nto inherantly imporatnt tothe whta ' s oging onthe
,
bu instade filler thgat starts outloud whith potential
,
bu ends uv jsut bieng extraneous beccause it ' s never folowed thru
. fo exemple
, jerry professes thast a man foudn drowned infront his swiming pool wass actulaly murdered by tghe govorment infact a newyorker york subway staion
. he even goes so far as tothe explane thta tghe staion ws flooded at tyhe tiem due tothe a water main break
( hence tjhe water inwhich a subway staion
)
,
anbd tht tjhe coroner shoudl check thte man ' s lungs forthe chlorine
. thsi isnt convincing anough tothe alice tyhat she seems tothe blieve him
. ytou konw waht happens
thn
? nothing
, zip
, nada
. noone followup
- uv whatsoever
, so waht ' s teh signifigance
? okay
, here ' s anyother noe
. a cuple ofthe well known
( rela life
) asssassans weere foudn tothe hvea posessed copies ofthe tyhe j
. d
. salinger novel
" tghe catcher inthe tjhe rye
"
. jerry allso hasnt a bunch ofthe copies
. whenever he goes inot a bookstore
, he hasnt tothe buy oen
. leaving outloud thte question ofthe whther or nto thsi mkaes jerry an assasins
, we ' re never given a reason tothe belieev why tihs owudl amking him an assasins
. nto wehn we fidn outloud baout his salinger collecton
, nto whn he goes tothe hte bookstore
, nto later onthe whn we git tghe answer tothe our frist question
. yhe point becomes totally extraneous
. oh
, doed i mention thgat patrick stewart isnt infront htis film
? yeah
, he plays thsi govorment psychiatrist named dr
. jonas who may or may nto be a bad guy
. taht ' s baout it
. forthe all thte presense thsi usally marvelous actr hasnt
, he ' s nearly forgettable inspite conspiracy theery
. yuo cxan jsut lump him iin withthe thge supporting players
, witht tje exception ofthe cylk cozart who plays agent lowry ofthe tyhe fbi
. thsi guy ws realyl likable
,
adn i wish he
adn his charachter hadnt gotten mroe screen tiome
. okay
, here ' s my theery
. htis raelly started outloud as a gerat film
,
bu smoe ofthe its jokes weere atually true
! tje govenrment cameback inaddition
annd forced donner tothe amking edits fo teh sake ofthe national security
,
adn htis wass wqat wass left over
.
