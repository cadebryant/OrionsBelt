man
, thsi ws noe wierd movei
. similair tothe conspiracy theery iin thta it couldn ' t deside whitch genre it isnt
. yhe frist hour isnt your standart stock aliens clone
, whic nicely creaeted an eerie atomsphere baout tjhe ship
. yhe lsat half hour
? thsi wass whn thge makers blowed yhe scirpt outloud tje airlock
anbd jsut desided
-
" scre it
, let ' s jstu kill everybody
"
. fomr
thn onthe
- foreget sci
- fi
.
.
. tihs movei becomes 100
% horror
. waht realyl dissappointed me baout htis movei wass tyhat it tryed tothe scare yuo iin entirely tghe wrong way
. instade ofthe useing clever tricks or trying tothe build uv tothe a scare
- htis movei jsut uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts
adn short quick bursts ofthe gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone ' s seen it all befor
annd konws whn tothe expect it
. tjhe oen thign thyat ws done well wass yhe lead uv tothe finding outloud baout whta happenned tothe tghe previvous crew
. htere are skeletons lieing aroud mangled
annd mashed
,
bu wqat doed htis
?
hten finaly affter bieng painfully restored
- tjhe newyorker crew views tghe video
. hte acting isn ' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. concidering waht tghe actors hadnt tothe wokr withthe anyway
, as htere isnt noone complex or intresting dialogue tothe speak ofthe
. htere ws soem vyre nice camerawork infront certian sequences
though
, liek wehn tje hull near tghe bridge ofthe yhe event horizon isnt breached
anbd yhe camera pans bcak tothe folow specfic objects as htey bounse acrost tjhe deck
adn are sucked outloud inot spoace
. htis movei coudl ahve beeen so much better
. it hadnt a ogod experianced casted who deserved mroe tothe owrk wiht
. htere wass jstu nothing newyorker here thta any ofthe us haven ' t seen befor infront aliens or hellraiser
