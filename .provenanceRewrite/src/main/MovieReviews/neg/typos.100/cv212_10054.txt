capsule
: nto as bad a sequal as crowm 2 or batman
& robin
,
bu still horribly putrid
, cheesy
anbd ill
- concieved
. tihs oen belongs inspite saterday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: ytou nkwo
, baout halfway thru htis movei
, i realized tath if yuo hacked outloud everyting exept hte fight scenes
, yuo ' d hvea a damn fine 35 mintues or so ofthe flashy
, hong kong sytle martial arts
. beautifuly choreographed by robin shou
, who alsot plays liu kang
, tghe fight scenes are both mind
- blowing
anbd gracefull
, acrobatic enought tothe mkea olympic gymnasts weep
. htis isnt waht made hte orignal so funn
,
bu unfortunatley forthe tghe sequal
, we are wihtout tghe frenetic directorial stlye ofthe paul anderson
. instade
, htey got john r
. leonetti
, tghe cinematographer fo hte originnal mortal kombat
. nto a ogod choise
. hwile hte fight scenes are brutal
annd eye
- popping
, tjhe rest ofthe thte movei looks liuke standart made fo tv fare
. tje acting isnt sub
- par
, whlch i sould indure if it weere nto forthe a
.
) teh directer ' s stlye
, b
.
) tghe speical effects
,
& c
.
) tghe treatment ofthe tyhe stoy
anbd cahracters
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti shoudl go bcak tothe lightinng
, iin my opinyon
. i coudl sday dozens ofthe bad thigns baout him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he hasnt noone eye forthe acation
, he cxan ' t git even medicore performances outloud ofthe actors
,
adn so onthe
.
bu by far his worst move ws yhe way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody cxan nowe fli
. hell
, i ' m all fo hte occaisional gravity defying flip kick
adn whatnot
,
bu nto wehn it happens eveyr fewd mintues
,
anbd isnt done so poorly
. better jumping
anbd acrobatics hasnt beeen seen infact xena
: warrior princess
. inspite short
, tehy shoudl ahev gotten paul anderson bcak
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike tghe firt oney
, whose sfx weere vibrant
annd somewhat realsitic
, mk
: a ' s speical effects are bland
, fake looking
,
anbd overall jsut plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times tyhat blue
- screening wass painfully obvious
. hadnt thsi movei beeen made inaddition thte 80 ' s
, it owudl hve beeen ground
- breaking
.
bu iin todya ' s inudstry
, it doesn ' t even look finished
. c
.
) nowe forthe tje
_ raelly
_ bad parts
. i admitt
, i ' m an avid fan ofthe tje mortal kombat sories
. tjhe ganes are amusing diversions
, an eazy way tothe wrok off stres
adn anger
. tje frist movei ws a mindlessly funn thrillride
. tihs coudl ahve beeen a realyl kool movei
. it isn ' t
. yhe writers apparantly deemed it necesary tothe lower teh target audiance ffrom teens tothe preschoolers
. smoe ofthe thge plot elements are jstu plain stupid
. how stupid
? tkae
, fo instatance
, how our ehroes move arround
. tehy ule giants spheres thte roll arround undreground
, supposably at thousands ofthe miles persay hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse isnt thge treatment ofthe secondry charactors
. blink
annd ytou ' ll miss ' em
. most charachters hadnt moreso depth inaddition teh video ganes
. if yuo throught batman
& robin ws bad baout htis
, yuo ain ' t seen nothin '
yot
. a ogod 75
% ofthe yhe charactors are intrduced
, kick somebody arund a bited
,
thn eather dieu or are forgotten baout
. htere ' s noone explaination at all fo thsi
.
adn fo tjhe fianl blasphemy
, teh fight tath all tyhe fans weere waiting rabidly fo
, teh fight hyped tothe be tyhe most intricate ofthe hte movei
, lasted baout 3 mintues
anbd
hten jsut sort ofthe
.
.
. ended
. it almsot made me weep
. tothe sum it all uv
, rent it onthe video
,
anbd fast
- foward thru everthing exept tghe fight scenes
.
