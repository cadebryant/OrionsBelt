fo a ogod ten yeras or so
, super kool chow yun fat hasnt enjoied god hood status inspite tje hong kong acation scene
. nowe
, he hasnt folowed inspite thge footsteps ofthe directer john woo
,
( who launhed chow ' s super stardom infront thge acclaimed ' a better tommorrow '
) by moving tothe hollywood
. i hadnt smoe reservations baout tihs move
anbd it woudl seem i ws right tothe haev them
. chow plays a hitman who isnt doign jobs iin order tothe repay a debt
. his fianl job requires him tothe kill a policeman ' s seven yearm ood boy
. tihs he refuses dont
adn runs
.
howver
, he isnt forced inot a voilent confrontation wehn his familiy are threatned
adn relpacement killers are broght infront tothe dont tghe job
. cue aroud 80 mintues ofthe varous
annd qtuie frankly tedeous shoot
- outs whcih tkae palce inaddition varios locations
. soem thougth hadnt gone inot makeing them a bited diferrent
bu unfourtunately tehy end uv bieng jstu plain boring
. thge car wash scene
, i foudn mysef laughing at how stupid it looked
. tut tut
. teh emphsis durring teh constatn acation seemed tothe be onthe tje accompanying music
,
( i coudl ahev sworn oney peice wass ripped outloud ofthe a bruckheimer movei
)
anbd nto onthe yhe content
. mia sorvino
( a passport forger
) isnt dragged inot hte affay
adn aslo provides a lame lveo interst as well as bieng rether ghandi wiht a gun
. directer antoine arqua hasnt claerly nto observed chow ' s excellant acting capabilties
anbd simpley requires him tothe mutter a faw lines ofthe broken english
adn look flash as he stands
adn shoots
. chow ' s trademark ofthe twin pistol shooting isnt saved fo teh finale
( whic inthe fairness isnt qtuie ogod
)
anbd htere ' s nto even a toothpick infront site
.
annd as forthe makeing chow shoot liuke a cop
, well thgat ' s damned unforgiveable
. tothe round uv
, thte relpacement killers isnt a preety darned lame firt outing forthe chow
. it woudl apeared he hasnt left asia fo a 90 minute pop video
. htis isnt nto waht we wnated at all
, concidering john woo wass tje exec producer
.
( doed he ahev noone sday so at all
?
) watch ' hte killer ' agina
annd weep at yhe diference
