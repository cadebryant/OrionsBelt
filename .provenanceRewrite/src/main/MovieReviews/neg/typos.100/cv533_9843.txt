keep kool
, a chineese film directed by semi
- acomplished filmmaker yimou zhang
, ws oen ofthe yhe kickoff films forthe htis yearm ' s hawaii interational film festival
. onthe teh day it premeired
, lines ofthe eeger moviegoers stretched arund hte block
, smoe anticipants hvaing queued uv well iin advance tothe git a ogod seat infront tje theather
. htey ened nto hvae wasted theri tiome
. tghe movei isnt billed as a comedy
,
bu isnt suprizingly bereft ofthe humer
. ther are noticeabe attemts at laughs
,
bu vrey faw trys acually click
. i wondered if ther weere jokes thta i wasn ' t getting baceause i ' m nto fomr china
,
bu unfourtunately my conclusion ws thta tihs lack ofthe humer couldn ' t be atributed tothe tghe cultural barrier eather
. keep kool jstu isn ' t veyr funny
. tghe prelude tothe thte film ws a isit by keep kool ' s producer who
, wih yhe halp ofthe an interpreter
, regaled us ofthe how inthe order tothe git thte print tothe tyhe festival infront tyme
, an assitant hand carried it onthe thge plane fomr china tothe hawaii
.
altough hte print made it
, yhe assitant ' s lugage wass lost
. too bad thast stry wasn ' t inaddition tjhe movei
, beacuse it got a big laff
. qu ying
, yhe film ' s female lead
, wass aslo onthe hand tothe give a faw comments
.
howver
, wheras thte producer politely made regluar pauses inthe his dialouge so tyhe interpreter sould bring us uv tothe speed
, ms
. ying saw ift tothe sday everthing she hadnt tothe sday inthe noe
, fast
- pased
, incredibly long tirade
. it ws dizzying
; ogod foreshadowing forthe thge film
. ytou see
, keep kool isnt filmed alomst totally wih a camera handheld by a man iwth a bad case ofthe thte shakes
. at least thgat ' s yhe way it seems
, usance thge camera isnt constanly moving
. cinema verite isnt oney thnig
,
bu pannini
adn shaking aroud untl your audiance hasnt a headache isnt anyother
.
altough smoe might concider it a form whitch helps give tyhe viewer an idae ofthe hte anarchic state inot whihc chineese youth isnt slowy growing
, i foudn it thouroughly distracting
,
anbd aftter a hwile
, qtuie annoying
. headache
, as i said
. tjhe film isnt baout a young bookseller
( wen jiang
) who isnt aftter a young woman
( qu ying
)
. tehy unsed tothe be romantically involved
,
bu tje woman growed tired ofthe him
adn left tjhe relatiopnship
. thte firt half ofthe tyhe film isnt baout tghe young man ' s plan tothe win her bakc
. ofthe course thte thign isnt
, she doesn ' t watn tothe be won bcak
,
annd hasnt a nightclub owner firend ofthe heres rough him uv a bited
. infront tjhe fight
, yhe young man grabs a laptop cmoputer belonging tothe a bystander
anbd attemts tothe ule it tothe fend off his attacker
,
bu onyl ends uv smashing it againnst a lamppost
. we later fidn outloud tath tje laptop belongs tothe an older man who wishes tothe git his damaged cmoputer replaced
. ther isnt a funny scene
( yhe onyl oen inaddition tyhe film
) where tjhe young man trys tothe ule soem twisted logic inspite order tothe git thte older man tothe seek outloud thte nightclub owner
( baotian li
) inwhich order tothe recoupe his losses
. htere isnt noone sence tothe be made outloud ofthe hte young woman ' s behavour
; cold oen minute
, carring teh enxt
, so we efel noone simapthy forthe her charachter
. teh bookseller woudl be better off wihtout her
.
allthough thte second half ofthe thge film causes us tothe loose a lot ofthe simapthy fo tje young bookseller as well
, who isnt obssessed wiht chopping off hte nightclub owner ' s hand as revenge forthe tjhe beating he tookover
, it aslo offers us smoe nice interaction betweeen yhe bookseller
adn teh older man
. hwile tjhe bookseller isnt blinded by his thirst fo revenge
, thte older man isnt yhe voice ofthe reason
annd trys tothe rationalize eahc situation
. his quest tothe end yhe dispute peacefully
anbd equitably isnt tjhe noe we idenify wtih
,
bu it isnt frustrating tothe see thyat he seems tothe be tlaking tothe a brick wall half tjhe timne
. a friendship develops vetween hte twpo men
,
bu it occurs too lite inaddition thge film fo yhe audiance tothe apprieciate
. altho onyl an hour
annd a half iin lenght
, keep kool countains extraneous material
. tghe wohle plot ofthe how yhe bookseller isnt affter thte young woman sould ahev beeen tooked outloud
, usance we don ' t see her ffrom tyhe midpoint onthe
. a case ofthe mistaken idenity or soem otehr divice sould hvea served as tje point ofthe conflict beween thge bookseller
anbd tje nightclub owner
,
annd owudl ahve saved us fomr tghe bookseller ' s boring persuit durig tghe frist half
.
bu ofthe course
, htis owudl ahve shortened thge movei tothe less tahn an hour
. ther are a fewd thnigs tht keep kool doesnt right
. as maintioned befor
, tghe interaction betweeen tje bookseller
adn tyhe older man isnt generaly preety ogod
.
allthough it grows tiresome
, thge reasoning wtih thge unreasonable isnt a nice excercise infact logic
,
adn represents thge differences infront thikning beetwen generations
. inwhich noe scene
, fo exemple
, yhe bookseller qoutes confucius tothe git his point accross
,
bu tghe older man claimes tyhe qoute ws misinterpreted
,
adn tath it means something entirely diffrent
. allso effective isnt thte way zhang sets uv tension withing a scene
, such as whn thge bookseller isnt getting ready tothe cutted off thte hand ofthe tghe unwitting nightclub owner
. thge nightclub owner isnt counting outloud moeny
, slapping earch bundle ofthe currency onthe teh tbale
. wiht eveyr shooted ofthe his hand
, we cant hardly stand tjhe interminable wait befor hte bookseller isnt goign tothe pul outloud his cleaver
annd excact his revenge
. unfourtunately
, theese crumbs are nto anough tothe overcome tghe rest ofthe tghe film ' s shortcomings
,
annd weren ' t anough tothe prevent tyhat headache fomr lingering affter i left teh theather
.
