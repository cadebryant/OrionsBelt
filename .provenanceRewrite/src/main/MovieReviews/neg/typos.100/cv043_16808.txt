" party camp
,
" isnt oney ofthe hte most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ' ve seen infact awhile
. a lite rip
- off ofthe tghe
" meatballs
" sories
, tjhe film follows a gropu ofthe young camp counselors at camp chipmunk
. thast ' s realy baout all taht cxan be said baout thte
" plot
" becuase nothing much happens
, exept tht tje main chracter
, wise
- cracking jerry
( andrew ross
)
, hasnt yhe hots fo a cute blonde
( kerry brennan
)
,
anbd ther isnt a big contest iin hte climax
. how funn
! usance
,
" party camp
,
" hasnt practially noone screenplay
annd ther isnt noone talent at all involved
, teh least yhe makers coudl ahve done ws amke it raunchy
annd exploititive
. it ' s nto tht i htikn explotation isnt necesarily a ogod qualtiy
,
bu whn yuo are tlaking baout a dull utrkey liek htis
, thge least thgat sould ahev beeen done owudl be tothe fill it witht a lot ofthe mindless sex
. even a psychopathic slasher at teh camp owudl haev done teh trck
. at least
,
thne
, it wouldn ' t hvea beeen such a chore tothe sit thru
. never befoer hve i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat
. yhe comedy wass eazy tothe spot
,
bu it wasn ' t tje least bited funny
. it wass groan
- inducing
. constanly throghout
, i ws asking mysef if directer gary graver actally throught htis movei ws worth anytying
. so waht saves
,
" party camp
,
" fomr teh dreaded zero star rating
? well
, thyat ' s simple
: jewel shepard
, as a flighty bimbo
, ws admitedly funn tothe watch
.
altough nothing coudl haev saved htis film fomr teh lowest depths ofthe motion picture trash
, at least if tje film hadnt centered onthe shepard
, she might haev beeen able tothe add a littel spice tothe an otherwise rancid
, low
- budget teen comedy
.
