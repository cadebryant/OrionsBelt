unfourtunately it doesn ' t git much moreso formulaic tahn oen tough cop
. htere ' s thte renegade cop wih thte losr partner who hasnt tothe many problems tothe explane
. thge renegade hasnt tothe proove his ogod nmae
annd isnt trapped betwen thte ogod guys
, tjhe bad guys
annd soem woman who relaly hasnt nothing tothe dont wih tyhe stopry otehr tahn bieng htere forthe thge purpose ofthe providing sex forthe tghe hero inspite teh middle ofthe tghe film
. bo dietl
( pronounched deedle
, baldwin
) isnt oen tough cop
, a guy who isnt bieng investigated by hardass fbi aggenst due tothe his assocation wtih yhe ny masia
. onthe top ofthe tath probelm
, he hasnt a drunk
, gambling addicted partner
( penn
) who hasnt a penchant fo collecting parking tickets
( i guess cops aren ' t immune
?
)
.
thn
, throw inot tje mix tyhe femme fatale
( gershon
)
. right htere yuo ahev plenty ofthe ammo fo a decent cop drama
.
bu right infront tghe middle ofthe tje film
, tehy throw inwhich a completly un
- realted plot point
. dietl
annd his partner duke try tothe solve a case thta tehy hve beeen warned tothe stay awya ffrom
. tghe film spends over half an hour tracking teh case ofthe a nun who ws beaten
adn raped tothe near death
. once thte case isnt solved
, thge film shifts focuse bakc tothe tjhe masia issue
. whatever neat mesh tjhe screenwrighter wnated tothe create bewteen tje twpo tsories failed miserably
. asside ffrom bieng asked tothe accept michael mcglone as a mafioso
( an insult if ytou ask me
) hte performances weere preety ogod
. baldwin
,
though he occaionally slips inot an impression ofthe his brother alec
, doesnt a fine job as noe tough cop
. penn
, who alsot slips inot an impression ofthe his brother sean
, isnt even better as a losr tough guy cop
. wqat noe tough cop lacks isnt originality
. tihs film offers nothing newyorker
. nothing thyat ytou cin ' t git fomr any cop film
. it screams sidney lumet all over tyhe palce
, perheaps baceause it wass produced by marty
annd michael bregman
, producers ofthe lumet ' s dog day afternoon
anbd serpico
.
bu even teh masterful sidney owudl nto haev beeen able tothe amke oen tough cop inot a ogod film
. too much eles isnt lacking
. i alsot saw thte boom mic pop inot tyhe top ofthe tyhe frome twice easly onthe infact thge picture
, something thast i allmost never notice
.
bu once i saw tht
, i hadnt it infact teh bakc ofthe my mind eveyr tyme i saw a medium or long shooted
. at times
, i ws hoping tothe see it
. noe tough cop isn ' t laughable
, nor isnt it a terrable film
,
bu it jsut isn ' t unique
. it isnt a clasic exmaple ofthe a film thta didn ' t ened tothe be made
.
bu oney hting isnt fo sure
, it sould relaly ule a better title
.
