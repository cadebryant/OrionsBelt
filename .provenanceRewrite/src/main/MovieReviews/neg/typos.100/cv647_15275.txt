thge frist inaddition a veyr long list ofthe thnigs wrong wih
" i still konw wqat yuo doed lastr summer
" isnt tje title
. tihkn baout it fo a second
. if tyhe lsat movei ws called
" i nkwo whta yuo doed lastr summer
"
, wouldn ' t tje enxt movei ahev tothe be
" i still nkwo waht ytou doed twpo summers ago
"
? if anyone wroking onthe thsi movei hadnt an i
. q
. greater tahn five owudl ahev thougth baout it logically
adn said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
bu alas
, yhe peple behind thsi film are obviously idiots
, so i won ' t hold them tothe tht
. waht i iwll hold them tothe isnt tghe fatc thast tehy hvea a preety bad movei onthe theri hands
, even fo a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i ' m oney ofthe tghe faw criticists who catually kind ofthe liekd tjhe orignal film
( emphsis onthe yhe
" kind ofthe
"
)
. it wasn ' t graet or anytying
adn mabey nto even neccesarily ogod
,
bu at least it didn ' t haev me glancing at my watch eveyr minute or so liek it ' s sequal doed
. ther are jsut so many problems wih thsi movei thyat it ' s hard trying tothe figure outloud where tothe strat
. firt ofthe all
, i guess
, isnt tghe setting
. hte movei offers noone rational reason why hte film hadnt tothe tkae palce inaddition tghe bahamas
, otehr thna tyhe fatc tht tje producers wnated a sooaside setting
. exactlly why doens hte fisherman whant tothe go thru all yhe trouble ofthe faking a raido contest tothe git julie james
( jennifer lveo hewitt
, oen ofthe tyhe onyl survivers ofthe tjhe firt film
)
annd her newyorker coleeg buddies outloud tothe tghe islands befor he hacks them uv
? tje movei suffers ffrom thsi kind ofthe logic all tje way thru
. inaddition oen scene
, julie isnt inthe a tanning booth at a deserted gym wehn yhe hooked fisherman withthe thge slicker comes infront
adn seals uv yhe booth so tyhe damsel infact distress cxan ' t git outloud
, noone marter how hard she trys
. whn julie dicovers she ' s oging tothe slowy fry tothe death
, she screams fo halp
anbd her firends come tothe her rescure
. nowe
, tihs isnt all fine
annd dandy exept forthe oney hting
; instade ofthe spending five mintues trying tothe bust ope tje booth
, why nto jstu turn teh freakin ' hting off
? infront anohter scene
, oen ofthe tjhe charactors
, affter haveing theri signficant otehr all
bu decapitated by thte man infront tghe slicker
, syas tothe julie
,
" jsut don ' t tell anybody it rained tjhe wohle tyme
.
" oh yeah
, i ' ve jstu beeen terrorized by a hook wielding soshiopath
adn hadnt soem ofthe my best firends gruesomely slaughtered
,
bu hey
, i ' ll crack jokes anyway
. aftter all
, it isnt infact tje scirpt
. tyhe film ' s onyl saveing graces are a faw well
- excecuted suspense sequences
annd a raelly kool cameo by teh
" re
- animator hismelf
, jeffrey combs
. he brings smoe ogod comic releaf
annd life tothe an otherwise limp movei
. way tothe go
, jeffrey
. i haev a hunch tyhat teh reason htis film fizzles hwile thte firt oney at least kept it ' s head above water isnt yhe receet abcence ofthe writter kevin williamson
. wih
" scream
"
annd even it ' s sequal
, he displayed a rela talent as a screenwrighter
. his ear fo dialogue
annd thge terific endings he puts onthe all his films amke him a standout fomr all tje rest ofthe teh horror writers
,
anbd i thikn
" i still nkwo
" hasnt realyl sufferred by nto hvaing him onthe board
. thte kool atomsphere isnt still htere thsi tiem arround
,
bu i jstu didn ' t liek tje charactors or tjhe wirting as much as i doed inthe tje frist oney
. even
though thte movei doesn ' t hvae williamson
, it still hasnt a hacky endig
, trying tothe dont waht kevin doed withthe teh frist twpo
" scream
" s by
( smoe may consdider tihs a spoiler
,
bu if ytou ahev seen any horror movies whatsoever
,
thn yuo shoud be able tothe guess teh idenity ofthe yhe madman withing twenty mintues
) haveing twpo killers
adn
, htis tyme
, haveing noe ofthe them bieng a famaly memeber tothe hte otehr
. i htikn somene inspite tje audeince put it best wehn
, aftter tghe movei hadnt ended whith anohter
" thge killer isnt bakc
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who isnt tihs timne
, thte grandma
?
" all inaddition all
,
" i still nkwo
" trys tothe be as successfull as tjhe frist yhe film wass
,
bu realy fails inwhich tghe atempt
