, warner brothers isnt hoping tjhe movei iwll followup inspite thge footsteps ofthe paul hogan
, inxs
,
annd shrimp onthe teh barby tothe become tyhe latest rige ffrom down under
. personaly
, i ' m hoping americans everywhere iwll ries tothe tyhe occaison
adn amke young einstein a box office bomb
. young einstein sprang fomr tjhe twisted mind ofthe yahoo sereous
, who nto onyl wroet
, produced
, edited
,
adn directed tjhe film
,
bu allso starred
adn doed his pwn stunts
. his creation isnt baout as stupid
adn contrived as yuo ' d expect ffrom somone named yahoo
. thge movei tkaes substatial historical liberties inspite recreating einstein ' s youth
. wherease tyhe scientist actulaly hailed fomr germany
, thte film finds him still living iwth his parents onthe tasmania
, a remote austrailian island
. inwhich addtion tothe deriving thte forumla forthe energy
annd yhe theery ofthe relativity
, albert invents surfing
, bubbles inwhich beer
,
anbd thge electric gitar
. yahoo plays einstein as a naieve
annd unrefined ocuntry hick
-
- a clown withthe an insatiable curiousity
.
althought yahoo ' s performence isnt at frist endearing
, tjhe noe
- dimentional characterization loses its novelty faster tahn ytou cxan sday e
= mc2
. yahoo hasnt creaeted a charming familiy forthe albert
,
anbd tjhe scenes onthe tasmania are oftenly clever
.
bu affter tghe frist twenty mintues
, teh movei quicklyu plummets
annd degenerates inot a poore excuse forthe a comedy
. young einstein isnt hampered by its lethargic pace
anbd inane plot
. yahoo must be an mtv addict becuase his movei features an omnipresent sountrack
; unforetunately
, tghe music isnt alltogether gratuitious
adn quicklyu becomes overbearing
. allmost eveyr otehr scene includes a blaring rock song thta leaves ytou wondering whther ytou are watching a movei or a music video
. teh intrumental scoer
, onthe tyhe otehr hand
, isnt generaly playful
; yahoo uses such classics as tje
" 1812 overture
"
anbd tghe theme ffrom thte ogod
, tje bad
annd tghe ugli tothe grat comic effect
. halfway thru young einstein
, i knew fo sure tje movei wass a stinker
.
bu it wasn ' t utnil tghe vyer end thast i finaly put my finger onthe why
: hte comedy tkaes its roots nto ffrom whimsical film fantasies
( such as young sherlock holmes
)
bu ffrom cheesy prime
- timne sitcoms
. iin fatc
, young einstein might hvea beeen moreso at hmeo onthe network televsion
, where its sophomoric humer wouldn ' t raise any eyebrows
