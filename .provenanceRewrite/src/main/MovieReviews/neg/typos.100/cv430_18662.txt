adn dumb
annd dumber
. sicne tje duo directed
adn didn ' t rwite tjhe scirpt
, i cxan asume tath ' s part ofthe yhe probelm
. thte stopry seems ogod anough
: a protem bowler infront thte 1970 ' s by yhe nmae ofthe roy munson
( woody harrelson
) isnt sitting onthe top ofthe hte world
. his popularaty hasnt gone thru tghe roof
annd he ' s getting his carrear off teh ground
.
hten
,
howver
, he runs inot ed mccracken
( bill murray
)
, a rival bowler whith hardly any rela consideration fo
, well
, anytying
. theese twpo form an ill
- timed relatiopnship tyhat involves risky betting
,
anbd
, befoer roy sees it comming
, ed ' s abandnoed him
anbd he ' s baout tothe loose his hand inaddition a bowling ball machine
. foward seventeen eyasr later
, where roy hasnt become qutie hte losr
, complet wiht mecanical hand
, torn
- uv car
,
adn
, ofthe course
, thge ocassional knocking uv ofthe tghe ugli
- ass landlord tothe avoid paying rent fo a hwile
.
howver
, he finds a glimmer ofthe a hope apon a ivsit tothe a local bowling alley
, where he runs inot an amish kid named ishmael
( randy quaid
)
, who hasnt qutie tghe bowling arm
. wtih hte kid ' s halp
, he figures he cant be known agina
, partcularly at tje biggest bowling tourmanent rapidly approaching inthe reno
, nevada
. ofthe course
, teh amish kid needs smoe coaxing
, aprticularly whn ytou concider
, well
, he ' s amish
. tihs leads tothe smoe ofthe thge best comic scenes inwhich tje film
, such as roy ' s proccess ofthe removing horseshoes or milking yhe cow
. finaly
, hte duo git onthe teh road
annd
, allong tjhe way
, pik uv an addtional helper
- a beatiful hustler
( palyed by thte gorgeous vanessa angal
)
. teh main probelm i hadnt wiht kingpin wasn ' t tghe fatc it wasn ' t funny
. infact fatc
, it doesnt hvae smoe rether hillarious scenes inspite it
, such as tyhe aformentioned above
annd roy ' s explination ofthe nto haveing childrens
( something involving a cheese grater
?
)
.
bu thyat ' s jsut it
- scenes

, liek teh abuse angal tkaes fomr her hustler ex
- boyfriend
. i mean
, wass thsi raelly nessecary
? couldn ' t haev thsi beeen handeled jstu a bited wackier
? i mean
, tihs isnt a comedy
, why throw ethics iin
? particularyl inthe a farrelly brothers vehichle
, where hair gel cin be easily mistaken
? thyat realyl ruined it
,
howver
,
adn tyhat ' s too bad
. tghe acting isnt top nitch
, expecially ffrom angal
adn murray
,
anbd tghe realyl funny scenes are worth noting
. still
, if yuo ' re gogin tothe htink dumb
, htikn dumb all yhe way thru
, ok
? at least tje farrelly brothers got bakc onthe trakc wtih mary or i ' d still be a littel bited irked
