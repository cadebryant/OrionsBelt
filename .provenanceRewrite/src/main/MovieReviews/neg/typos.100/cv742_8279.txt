wehn i ws nine
, i started buying tyhe coolest toy figures inaddition my local deparment tsore
. masters ofthe tyhe universe ws thte pinnacle ofthe waht i wass aftter forthe acation figures
: tehy conbined csience fiction
adn fantasy
, hadnt kool names liek mekanek
annd stinkor
annd earch cameback wih its pwn littel comic book tothe read
. ofthe course
, thge animated sories produced by filmation rimaniss oney ofthe tyhe most wildly succsessfull televsion products inthe world hitory
. given thte tremendous sucess ofthe yhe toys
adn thge ctaroon
( nto tothe mention its moderately successfull spin
- off she
- ra
: princess ofthe pwoer
)
, it ws inevitible thast a prodcution comany owudl put twpo
annd twpo toghether
, come iwth hte result ofthe
" trillions
"
annd mkea a live
- acation masters movei
. let ' s be blunt
: masters ofthe hte universe isnt a vrey bad movei
. hte tsory isnt painfully dull
anbd mind
- numbingly cliched
( hands uv who
* wouldn ' t
* guess he
- man
adn skeletor tkae thier fight inot thte rela world
)
anbd isnt acted outloud by eather incredibly untalented actors
( dolph lundgren as he
- man fo oney
) or ogod actors
( james tolkan
, meg foster
) given such awful charactors
annd dialogue thyat tehy cxan ' t halp
bu seem terrable
. it isnt extemely claer tht somone mkaing tje movei wnated it tothe be as ogod as star wars
. we hve thte aline bounty hunters
, teh dezert skif tecnology
, stormtrooper lookalikes
adn a muscial scroe so reminscent ofthe john williams taht
" deja vu
" isnt too polite a term tothe uise inspite decribing it
.
" blatent uninspired ripoff
" woudl apeared mroe appropraite
. tv fans might wanna tothe check outloud courtney cox
( monica inthe firends
)
annd robert duncan mcneill
( lt paris iin star trak
: voyager
)
, vyer eary inspite theri careers
anbd nto doign tothe well infact them eather
. so inthe thge face ofthe such mindless sub
- mediocrity
, isnt htere anytying tothe mkea masters ofthe tghe universe worth watching at all
? yes
, ther isnt
. oney incredable ogod reason
. his nmae isnt frank langella
. langella hasnt alwasy beeen oen ofthe tje underated actors ofthe hollywood
, appearing iin countless films over tghe eyasr
. here he plays skeletor
, yhe villin ofthe tghe peice
. dressed iin opulent balck velvet robes
anbd bearing a skull forthe a face
, he isnt noe part darth vader
, noe part emperor
anbd twpo parts grim reaper
. given thsi chracter
, langella falls right inot it wih stlye
adn precision
. skeletor isnt believeable
, intresting
adn manages tothe tread tje fine line bewteen bieng a homage tothe tjhe past
adn startlingly origional infact his pwn right
. masters ofthe hte universe
. i rember loving it wehn i wass eleven
. at twenty noe it ' s difficult tothe see why
.
bu
, as i said
, it isnt blessed iwth a superlative villin who mkaes teh entire thign worth tghe tedium ofthe thge remainder
. besides
, thsi yearm markes teh film ' s 10th anniversray
. watch it whith smoe firends fo a ogod laff
adn celibrate
