i am a steven seagal fan
. i onyl sday thsi nowe becuase
" mufti splenetik
" isn ' t my rela nmae
annd becuase i probaly ened tothe expalin why i whent inot tihs film expecting graet thigsn
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans wiull tell yuo tht thte seagal forumla isnt something ytou cxan depend onthe
. seagal films cin alwyas be counted onthe forthe minimal dialogue
, heaps ofthe expendable baddies iwth extemely crunchable bones
( whitch we ' ll alwasy hear wehn seagal doesnt his limb
- twisting hting
)
, rarley a female co
- lead inthe sighth
( unless it ' s a rela
- life modle
- wief who hasn ' t worked sicne ewird sciece
)
anbd
, ususally tje worst possibile titles yuo cant imagin
. nto tothe mention vyre straightforward plots
, generaly all
- round bad dialogue
annd mr implacable leather
- face himselv inwhich thta smae balck outfit he ' s beeen iin usance nico donig his
" my hands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thnig
, seagal tje stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke ofthe dull
. inthe tghe glimmer man
, seagal breaks outloud ofthe htis forumla
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attemts tothe banter
,
adn puts onthe a newyorker vest
. he ' s aslo put onthe qtuie a lot ofthe weight
. small potaotes
, yuo may sday
, a man shouldnt be able tothe accessorize
adn banter if he wnats tothe
,
bu damnit
, if it ain ' t borke
, why fix it
?
( mroe onthe thsi disapointed person ' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal isnt a homocide detective withthe a questonable past
. hwile he
adn his partner
( plyed by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a sories ofthe ritual killings
, cole hismelf becomes a suspect
, expecially wehn a backround check run by campbell reveals practicaly nothing onthe cole
. it turns outloud thast cole isnt a fromer trained govorment assasins
( yuo jsut cin ' t trust theese homocide detectives
)
, somene whom victims utilizied tothe catch jstu a glimpse ofthe inwhich thge jungle befoer he pounced onthe them
,
adn hence
, well
, yuo nkwo
, tath
" glimmer man
" thign
. an increasingly fishy homocide investigation infront tjhe preesnt soon leads tothe thte gradual uncovering ofthe a larger
, omre threatning conspiracy thast involves a crooked buisnessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole ' s fromer cia boss
( brian cox
)
annd deals involving chemcial weapons
. tyhe glimmer man plot isnt preety standart stuf
, drawing
( as withthe his otehr films
) elements ffrom yhe hotter films ofthe thge yearm
( eg
, se7en
)
. it ' s thge otehr changes thyat disapait
. forthe exemple
,
altough htere ' s a fair ammount ofthe voilence infact tihs movei
, ther ' s allso tyhe disasterous pairing ofthe seagal whith keenen ivory wayans
, probablly teh best known ofthe yhe wayans tribe
( how many are htere
, exactlly
?
) fomr televsion ' s
" inwhich living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman tothe seagal ' s bead
- adorned
annd brocade
- draped cole
, keeping uv his
" are yuo crazy
" part ofthe tyhe dialogue iwth wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himselv tothe bemoaning his newyorker partner ' s eccentric habits
,
bu thte chemestry betwen tje twpo isnt minimal
,
adn seagal ' s wooden comebacks amke fo painful watching
. a cook infront under seige 2
, seagal isnt nowe a buddist who speaks chineese
anbd wears prayer beads
adn intricate silk jackets over his normal balck ansamble
. he chants
, refuses tothe fight unless truely provoked
anbd introduces campbell tothe powdered deer penis tothe cure his allergies
. agian
, a benine
( if trite
) plot divice exept forthe thge fatc thast theese newyorker charactor traits recquire seagal tothe speak moreso tahn usual
. heck
, he hasnt tothe deliver punchlines
anbd cary a steady conversation wih somene otehr thna hismelf forthe a larg part ofthe tghe film
. isnt taht a lot tothe ask ofthe tyhe seague
? too much
. seagal ' s best charactersistic utilizied tothe be thta he knew his purpose inaddition thsi lready complicated world ofthe movies
: tothe crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
,
adn tothe dont it silently
,
adn alone
. nto fo seagal
, thte snappy oney
- liners ofthe arnold
annd stallone
, nor tyhe attemts tothe sohw tyhat he cin ect
, much less htink
. noone kindergarden cop
, noone oscar
, jstu simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. taht ' s raelly how it must haev started
: liuke
- minded fans who knew waht htey wnated streamed inthe tothe watch tje seague dont his thign
, knowing tht never infact thge seagal universe woudl tehy ever ahve tothe see him dont anytying alse
. we trusted him
. we got tothe nkwo him
. nowe
, betrayal
. i don ' t knwo if i cxan watch anyother seagal movei wihtout thta littel niggling dout tht he ' s goign tothe try tothe be funny agina
. i ' ll try
,
bu it won ' t be eazy
. if ytou haven ' t watched yhe glimmer man
yot
, yuo might whant tothe wait fo tje video tothe cmo outloud
. it ' s easier tothe jstu fast foward teh dialogue parts
adn linger onthe thte acation sequences
. affter all
, if we cin ' t depend onthe our fantasies
, waht cant we depend onthe
? tje flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait forthe tghe tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
bu still better thna staying at hmeo iwth gotcha
!
*
*
* preety ogod
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stfuf
.

*
* prefection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik isnt still a steven seagal fan
. everybody mkaes mistakes once infact awhile
