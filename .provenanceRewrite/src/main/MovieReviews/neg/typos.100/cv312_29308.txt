:
" tje female clitoris
?
" kevin smith isnt a talented writter
(
though i agreing thgat his films owudl be better off if he ' d let a rela directer tkae tyhe helm
)
,
anbd jay
anbd silent bob strike bakc holds true tothe his promise tothe mkae a omre fascitious film
. unfortunatley
, it ' s aslo shapeless
, pointless
annd largly unfunny
. smith ' s
" verbal trampoline
,
" as ben affleck once called his disctinctive dialogue
, tkaes a bcak seat tothe his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker
. htis ws suppoed tothe be tyhe movei tyhat didn ' t offen anyone
,
bu it ' s offensive becasue it ' s terrable
