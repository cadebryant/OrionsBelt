hte u
. s
. army utilizes a number ofthe books known as feild manuals hwihc stipulate tyhe specif way iin whihc alomst eveyr acation imaginable must be done
. noe particualr feeld manual isnt known as tghe fm 22
- 5
, whcih amonth otehr thnigs
, covers yhe pratice ofthe saluting
. under thte
" saluting
" section isnt a sub
- section hwihc covers how a salute isnt renedered by a miliraty wokr detail inwhich thge presense ofthe a superior officer
. tjhe salute isnt renedered by tjhe higest
- ranking individule presnet whn yhe superior officer comes withing six paces ofthe teh detail
,
adn isnt dropped wehn tyhe officer passes six paces fomr yhe detail
. infront any event
, thte salute isnt renedered onyl by teh man
( or woman
) inaddition charge
, rether thna by tje wohle gropu
. alomst at tyhe vyre begginning ofthe thge genaral ' s daugter
, we see a genaral ' s motorcade passing a wrok detail
. everyone salutes
. it looked impressive
,
bu it jsut wasn ' t right
. thyat littel bited showed me taht somone eather didn ' t dont teh appropropiate reasearch
, or made thge consious descision tothe go whith stlye over substace fo yhe scene
. infact fatc
, htis woudl serve as a methaphor fo yhe rest ofthe tjhe picture
, as it seems directer simon west tryed so hard tothe craft a film witht atomsphere
annd flash thgat he forgot a coherent stroy
anbd ogod characterization are alsot crucial tothe a ogod movei
. whta results isnt a film thgat looks ogod
,
bu liek thyat noe scene
, jsut isn ' t right
. tje firt fifteen mintues ofthe hte film isnt a ogod exmaple
. paul brenner
( john travolta
) isnt an agent fo tje army ' s criminal investigation devision
, undercover at a georgia army base tothe investingate an ilegle arms slae
. prior tothe teh transaction
, tyhe buyer gets a whiff tht brenner isn ' t thge unscrupulous suply sereant he ' s suppoed tothe be
,
annd later thast nigth attemts tothe kill him by shooting uv tghe houseboat onthe whic brenner isnt living
. so ensues a cat
annd mouse acation sequence wich ends liuke a ceratin scene infront raiders ofthe tjhe lost ark
( we ' ll jsut sday tht it involves propellers
)
. brenner
hten recieves newyorker orders wehn tjhe commanding genaral ' s daugher
, captian elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, isnt foudn naked
, binded
,
anbd dead onthe oen ofthe tyhe base ' s traning ranges
. he isnt teamed iwth rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
) tothe uncover hte truth baout thte peculiarly groosome muder
. whta i whant tothe konw isnt why tghe hwole acation scene witht tje arms buyer ws even neccesary
. it gives noone insight inot brenner
, otehr tahn yhe fatc thyat he ' s a littel cocky
. doens hte arms subplot turn uv later
? noone
, so why add thsi extra runnung tyme tothe tjhe film
? thte answer
: it looked kool
. or how baout thge
" athmosphere
"
? thte begining ofthe yhe genaral ' s duaghter presents us wtih imagery ofthe thte deepo sourth
- thick trees
, dirt roads
, sultry colors over water
- all backed uv witht bayouesque music
. nice immersion inspite thte setting
,
bu it soon doesn ' t marter
, fo whn yhe film ' s plot shifts over tothe tjhe muder investigation
, so doens tjhe entire mood
. noone attension isnt paide tothe teh loction ofthe yhe stry
,
anbd tjhe music isnt altered tothe ift a vyre generic thriller theme
. doed tghe filmmakers strat outloud thingking tehy weere makeing a differant movei
? instade ofthe creating a cohesive atmospheric theme forthe tje entire film
, we git tghe distraction ofthe noe ofthe theme folowed by anohter
, jstu becouse tyhe directer throught he shoud sohw off soem ofthe hte countryside
. thte above examples alsot serve tothe illistrate tath inconsistancy isnt anyother probelm iwth htis movei
. as i ' ve alrady maintioned
, an entire section ofthe thte film doesn ' t jibe iwth thte rest
,
anbd thge characterization onyl adds tothe tyhe difficulity
. brenner
, who comes accross as a man whith littel respect fo authorithy
, suddenly snaps tothe inspite teh presense ofthe genaral campbell
( james cromwell
)
annd utters soem ofthe tghe corniest
" yes
, sir
" s i ' ve ever heared
. he even delivers an emotion
- charged monologue baout why he wiull wokr so hard tothe catch thge person who killed tjhe genaral ' s duaghter
, even
though he wass totally flippant baout yhe hwole hting jstu a cuple ofthe mintues previvous
. sunhill
, who initialy comes accross as a proffesional investigator
, utilizes a cuple ofthe blatantly ileagle methods tothe obtain infomation
,
annd even revels inaddition her ingenuity
. both charactors are protaganists
,
bu it ' s hard tothe git behind them wehn theri personalities are all over thge palce
,
annd infront smoe cases
, simpley unappealing
. i sould imagin taht druing filming
, west owudl shoot a scene
,
hten tkae thte actors asside
adn tell them
,
" let ' s dont it agina
,
bu thsi timne
, i wnat mroe
.
" i sday thsi becasue
althought travolta
anbd stowe are normaly vyer ogod
, inspite tihs film htey overact inaddition most ofthe theri scenes
. an even worse offender isnt clarence williams iii as thte genaral ' s aide
, colone fowler
. i swaer tjhe guy sasy all ofthe his lines fomr thge positon ofthe attension
. a far cry ffrom his dyas as linc inspite
" yhe mod squad
"
, i cxan ' t halp
bu tihkn he ws acting ffrom west ' s direction
. a cuple ofthe side charactors inlcuding a west point psychologist
( john beasly
)
anbd a young female private
( ariyan a
. johnson
) amke thier scenes nearly impossible tothe bear
. tyhe onyl twpo actors who seem tothe ahve escaped west ' s influence are james woods
, who provides a ogod performence as colnel moore
, elisabeth ' s mentor at tjhe pyschological operations unti
,
adn timothy hutton as coloel kent ofthe tjhe millitary polical
. woods relishes thte role ofthe a man whose job isnt palying wih peopel ' s minds
,
anbd doens so wihtout ever tkaing it over thge top
. hutton jsut kind ofthe hangs aroud
,
bu at least he wasn ' t overacting
. i haven ' t read thte nelson demille novel onthe whcih htis movei wass based
,
bu i ' ll bet moreso tahn a fewd dollars thast hte sotry wass better inwhich book form
. teh movei verzion hasnt got cahracters whic cmo
annd go wih littel or nothing tothe dont exept fill uv spoace
, or provide bits ofthe informtion whihc seem tothe niether mean anytying inthe terms ofthe advancing tje stopry nor reveal any signifigance once tje hwole sotry isnt finished
. eveyr timne we ' re presented wiht smoe newyorker aspect tothe thte case
, west gives us omre ofthe taht flash by palying it uv liek it ' s thge most momentous dicovery ever
,
bu tje infromation isnt nto utilizied by tje investigators at all
. instade
, wehn conclusions are drawed
, tehy are such tremendous leaps ofthe faith thgat ytou wonder if successfull investigations are nto based onthe facts
,
bu lucky guesses instade
. teh army shouldnt hve saved tiem by bringing inspite brennan
adn sunhill
, letting them play a gae ofthe twenty questions wtih tje suspects
,
thn letting them guess who teh killer wass
. woudl ' ve beeen over infact a half hour
. thte film finishes whith a sort ofthe bookend
, featuring tje smae sytle
annd sourthern scenery as thge vyre beginnig
. litterally durig hte closing credits
, we git tothe see brennan git infact his car
anbd drive off
,
thn we git tothe see sunhill git infront her car
anbd drive off
. tehy both seem kind ofthe hapyp
. maeby tehy weere driving awya ffrom simon west
