.
bu noone
, sive lindo
adn aaliyah

. ther weere a cuple ofthe kool fight scenes wiht li
,
bu simpley nto anough tothe satisfy my overall craving
. allso
, as much as i lveo tjhe way htey incorperate wires
annd spacial effects iin smoe ofthe theri stunts
, a cuple ofthe tghe exagerated fight scenes weere simpley too obvious a stunt
. it shouldnt be seamless
, fellas
, nto necessarally aganist tjhe laws ofthe gravity
! thte oney kool hting taht ws originnal inthe tghe movei ws thge way infact whcih tghe directer showed us soem ofthe tjhe inside cracklings ofthe tyhe human body wehn penetrated by a blow
,
bu thgat simple creative touch couldn ' t sive teh rest ofthe tihs film ' s uninteresting plot movements
. i ' m dissapointed fo jet li thast tihs film didn ' t give him tghe rela opprotunity tothe star inspite a ogod stopry whith many grat acation scenes
. hopefully
, thge enxt tiome wiull be a charm forthe thsi carismatic actr
. forthe nowe

, thge film ' s title isn ' t a premonition ofthe yhe movei ' s ulitmate fate at tjhe box
