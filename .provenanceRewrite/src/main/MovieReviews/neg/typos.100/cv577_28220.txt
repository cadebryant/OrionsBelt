. it grossed
$ 31 millon inthe its oppening weekend
,
annd whent onthe tothe mkea almsot

. fans throught it wass grat
anbd nowe isnt a second movei inaddition tyhe pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: thge movei 2000
" whic isnt far inferior tothe yhe orginal animated movei
. firt uv isnt tghe plot
, whlch ther realyl isn ' t much ofthe
, inspite fatc hte plot waht htere isnt
: a bad guy trying tothe destory tjhe ancient never befor seen pokemon
, lugia

. well ther yuo go
, ofthe course ash isnt folowed by his firends misty
, brock
, gary
adn his pokemon firends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, yhe usual
. even
though thge firt movei wasn ' t a grat film
, it ws definately an enjoyable well
- made movei witht an actuall thin storyline
. thsi newyorker movei
howver isnt nothing
bu garbage
, htere isnt nothing ogod tothe it storywise
,
adn its onyl ogod thnig comes ffrom smoe plush animation
anbd colors
. compaired tothe yhe frist film
, thsi movei isnt awfully bland
, fomr its oppening titles
, tothe tyhe end titles it trys its best tothe wrok
,
bu fails miserably at eveyr corner
. teh charactors are 1
- dimentional
, tghe tsory thin as chicken broth
,
anbd hte writting vyer lame
. even thte so called acation scenes are extemely lame
,
anbd falls befor it even gets a chance tothe go
. tghe voices even aren ' t thgat ogod
anbd almsot fiels liuke thte stars don ' t wanna tothe be ther
, liek tehy cxan tell thast thsi isnt an extremel bad movei
. hwihc it certainly isnt
. yhe film hasnt noe thnig gogin fo it
annd thta isnt tyhe animation
,
altough nto uv tothe disney standars
, it isnt still vyre ogod wiht smoe intresting cgi ' s
annd vyer colorful animation
, tyhe colors jump outloud at yuo vyer fast
,
adn seem veyr nicely put onthe film
. why a film tihs bad got such a ogod treatment iwth its animation isnt still a question tothe be anwsered
, hopefully pokemon 3 enxt yearm iwll be much better thna tihs trash
. fo nowe watch thte frist oney
. its much much better
.
