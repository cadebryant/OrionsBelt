i ' ve alwasy beeen a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called wanda
, pirates ofthe penzance
,
adn even his hamlet onthe pbs ' gerat performances
. tjhe minute i saw tghe trailer forthe thsi film
, i resolved tothe see it
. besides tje fatc thyat kline starred
, it looked liuke a hillarious film
. i got sucker punched by tghe trailer tothe an extent
,
howver
, as i allso throught
,
" wow
, if htere ' s htis much funny tsuff infront thge trailer
, ther must be a ton ofthe laughs inspite tyhe rest ofthe teh film
.
"
( oops
) i packed uv thge wief
anbd headed tothe les cinemas del diablo
( my nmae forthe our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) tyhe film began
.
.
.
. teh film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high skool
, named howard brackett
. he loves peotry
anbd grat literary works
,
bu his clas isnt mroe interseted iin his faymus fromer student
, plyed by matt dillon
.
( i ' d put inspite his nmae
,
bu my wief won ' t let me tkae notes druing a movei
anbd i ' ve forgotten it
.
) htey constinually inturrupt his long poetic expositions iwth fawning questions baout him
. brackett hasnt beeen engaged tothe anyother teacher
( plyed by joan cusack
) fo threee yeras
,
anbd hasnt finaly gotten uv hte gumption tothe marry her
. yhe wedding
,
howver
, becomes tjhe big question mark ofthe hte film as tihs famouse student ofthe his syas durig teh live oscar brodcast thta brackett isnt a homosexual
. kline spends most ofthe hte firt twpo
- thirds ofthe tjhe film frantically trying tothe convince everyone tath he isn ' t
. tje wohle twon beggins tothe examin eveyr detail ofthe his life
anbd beggins tothe indentifying all thsoe thnigs thyat confirm his sexual preference
. his closest firends don ' t halp matters
, bringing nothing
bu barbara streisand laserdiscs tothe his stag party
. htere are smoe genuinely hilarous moments
, noe involving a tape geared towords helping men assert thier masculinity
. kline isnt hounded by a gay repertwar palyed by toom selleck
, who waxes poetic onthe thge benifits ofthe comming outloud
, hwile at yhe smae tyme doign his best tothe exploitate hte situation forthe his pwn sleazy tabloid machinations
. tghe movei moves allong fine
adn slowy builds tothe tje climax ofthe thge wedding
. kline stands at teh altar
anbd isnt asked tothe tkae his vows
.
.
. if ytou whant tothe be surprized
, don ' t read
, i am oging tothe reveal hte endig
.
.
.
. instade ofthe saying
" i dont
" inwhich front ofthe his parents
annd most ofthe tyhe twon
,
anbd even smoe cameras
, he sasy
" i ' m gay
.
" thsi isnt where yhe movei
, inthe my oppinion falls aart
. most ofthe tghe humer infact tghe film hadnt come ffrom kline ' s insistance thta he ws straight
, hwile at thte smae tiem
, loving peotry
anbd bieng a senstivie guy
, dressing well
,
annd occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me ofthe tje
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch ffrom saterday nght live
. it wass funny
, it ws sustainably funny
,
adn kline ' s performence made it doubly so
.
howver
, aftter hte wedding
, tyhe film drags onthe
. htey shoud hvea attemped tothe cmo tothe a quick conclusion
,
bu it
hten gets inot hte sereous side ofthe whta he ' s done
. he reconciles withthe his parents
anbd his firends
, smoe ofthe whcih hadnt turned onthe him
. ther are severeal scenes whic seemed liek a waste ofthe tiome
, thge scene wtih his mother
adn her firends
, whitch wass hillarious
, seemed pointless
,
adn hte scene witht toom selleck inaddition tjhe bar wtih joan seemed pointless
. fianlly
, even
though i am nto cathlic
, i foudn tyhe scene witht hte priest tothe be condescending
. yhe preist cannnot belive thgat a man ws engaged fo threee yeasr
adn hadnt nto consumated yhe relatiopnship
, proclaming tothe brackett infront tje thrid person
,
" he ' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle ffrom thge audiance
,
bu i ws distracted by it
,
adn began tothe tire ofthe yhe film
. by tje tiome tyhe wedding hadnt cmo
anbd gone
, i foudn mysef hoping it owudl be over soon
.
( much liek thsi review yuo are saying
) overall
, if i ahev tothe quantify it
, i sday
, rising acation gets
*
*
*
*
adn climax
anbd falling acation gets
. see it infact eceonomy tyme
.
