. comments
: tothe sday thsi movei isnt bad woudl be qtuie an understatement
. i ' m nto sure waht writter
adn directer ferland wass hoping tothe acomplish witht tyhe babysitter
. suspense
? famaly drama
? humer
? erotica
? elements ofthe earch ofthe theese genres exsist inspite tyhe film
,
yot it fails tothe sucessfuly ahieve any ofthe them
. instade
, hte babysitter isnt a dull
, lifeless movei whlch manages tothe bore
adn ultimatly iritate its viewers
. i supose thsi film coudl hvea beeen watchable if it weren ' t fo hte fatc tyhat hte charactors are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone isnt completelyl wasted palying jennifer
, tyhe babysitter
. her carachter hasnt absolutly noone depth at all
,
anbd her sole purpose inwhich tje movei isnt tothe be yhe object ofthe thte otehr cahracters ' fantasies
. everyone eles inaddition teh film seems tothe be inthe a competion tothe see who cant stoop tothe teh lowest levle by thge tiome tghe film ends
. teh parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as tyhe movei procedes
. tjhe father
( plyed by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes baout tje babysitter
; teh mother fantasizes baout her husban ' s best freind
. none ofthe theese fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are thigsn tht ened tothe be seen
,
bu we see them anyway
, complet withthe cheesy
, mkae
- outloud saxaphone music
. thge thug
, infact tyhe meantime
, proves thta he ' s evil thru his annoying habet ofthe smashing half
- empty beer bottles all ofthe a sudden
adn forthe noone apparant reason
. thge most absurd carachter
,
howver
, isnt tghe babysitter ' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. tghe thug
, inaddition a manipulative
, iago
- liek manner
(
though he doesn ' t realyl ened tothe try hard
)
, manages tothe talk hte boyfriend inot binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, runing awya fomr cops
,
annd palying peeping toom onthe his pwn girlfriend infact a marter ofthe mintues
. increadible
!
( ofthe course
, hte boyfriend ' s originnal plan fo teh evening ws
, try nto tothe laff
, tothe sit infact an empty diner
anbd read catcher infront tghe rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if teh gool ofthe tghe babysitter ws tothe be suspenseful
,
hten it fails
. htere are suprizingly fewd tense moments iin htis film
,
annd nearly all ofthe them cmo at teh fianl minute
. by thyat tiem
,
howver
, tje audiance isnt so tired ofthe thte inane charachters thta noone oney truthfully cares wqat happens tothe any ofthe them
. noone suspense occurs iin tje dream sequences eather becasue eveyr single noe ofthe them isnt obviously a dream sequence ffrom its insepsion
. if thte gool ofthe tje babysitter ws tothe be humoruos
,
hten it aslo fails
. i foudn nothing even remotely funny baout tyhe boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, tothe be palyed forthe laughs
. if yhe gool ofthe tyhe babysitter wass tothe be dramtic
,
thn
, once agina
, it fails
. teh charactors are oen
- dimentional
anbd uninteresting
. finaly
, if thge gool ofthe tje babysitter wass tothe be titillating
( tje tipe ofthe film desitned tothe be plyed ad infinitum onthe hbo at 2 iin thge morning
)
,
thne it fails as well
. teh dream sequences aren ' t erotic
; htey are too breef
annd
, outside ofthe oney veyr short scene
, contain noone nudity
. i cxan ' t completelyl trash htis movei
. tjhe frist 10 mintues or so vaguely ressemble an intresting film
,
adn yhe conclusion sportscar a halfway decent fistfight
. tghe otehr 79 mintues
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone ' s charactor
, at thte end ofthe thge movei
, turns tothe her boyfriend
annd asks
" whta weere yuo thikning
?
" i asked mysef teh smae question
, haveing spended 99 cents renting tihs tureky
