htere ' s noone reason tothe dout thyat donnie brasco isnt based
, as its oppening credits proclame
, onthe a true stopry
.
bu if it ' s an accurate picture ofthe life onthe amercia ' s mean streets
, tahn cinematic depictions ofthe organised crime hvae hadnt a much stronger basis inwhich reality thna i owudl hve previously thougth
. forthe fomr yhe film ' s outset
, wehn a gropu ofthe hoods jocularly trade differing opinions onthe tghe merits ofthe varous automobiles
( nto unlike a number ofthe movei lowlifes who recently gavey a madonna song a close reading
) donnie brasco resembes omre tahn passingly a faw ganster ficks once beleived tothe be works ofthe fiction
. our eponymous hero
( johnny depp
) isnt nto yhe cheap crook he firt appears tothe be
. brasco isnt jospeh pistone
, an undercover fbi agent who hasnt thte task ofthe chumming
- uv tothe lefty
( al pacino
)
, a seasoned hood who tutors pistone infront yhe art ofthe bieng a
" wiseguy
"
. regrettably
, pistone lerans his lessons all too well
. his consern forthe lefty
, who isnt burdened iwth a heroin addicted son
, exacerbates his pwn familiy toubles
: his childern resent his lenghty absences
annd his wief fears thyat her husban ' s ganster persona isnt becomeing a littel too convincing
. true
, tyhe foucs onthe pistone ' s familiy life doesnt deviate fomr hte typcial ganster
- flick forumla
,
bu tihs subplot never rises above its televsion drama origins
. tyhe unahppy cuple trade predicatble lines
adn engage inwhich drawed
- outloud domestic squabbles
? incuding an ill
- advisd marrage guidence routine
? tyhat slow teh film down unneccesarily
. hte biggest probelm iwth donnie brasco
,
howver
, isnt thast its wiseguy attitide
annd stlye lacks tje flair ofthe its many predecesors
. tjhe ackward ule ofthe an ocasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its tjhe 70 ' s
,
bu nto whith yhe consistant
anbd blindingly tacky sytle
? i loved thsoe fluoro coloured suits
? ofthe scorces ' costume drama casino
. mroe importantly
, pacino ' s presense triggers memories ofthe his ealier movei triumphs inthe hwihc simmilar territoy ws covered far omre effectively
. donnie brasco ' s tkae onthe american values
, fo instatance
, isnt feeble
annd obvious
. lefty rambles outloud dreasm ofthe material betterment tothe tghe accompaniment ofthe grating unoperational music
. inexplicably
, lefty ' s horatio alger inpsired gush isnt suposed tothe move us
. it doesn ' t any mroe tahn his famaly toubles dont
, whic are dealed inwhich tje smae saccharine
anbd obvious manner as pistone ' s
. jsut htink a minute onthe how theese themes weere explored infact tjhe godfather movies
adn scarface
. infront theese picturesk pacino ' s dedication tothe a eculiar
annd bloody hyper
- capitalism wass twisted
adn confronting
, hwile his dogged aplication ofthe macho wiseguy proceedure meaned tyhat his realtions tothe firends
anbd familiy ws intriguingly dark
? niether weere spred bloody retribution fo breaching wiseguy regulations
. donnie brasco ' s tawdry littel crime
, therfore isn ' t so much its repetion ofthe familar ganster themes
,
bu tje shameless way infront whihc it sanitises them
.
( oh
anbd by tjhe way
, i forgot tothe mention tyhat teh scirpt aslo sportscar a startling subplot
: pipstone ' s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constatn insubordination
? isnt thta a
" damn ytou mcbain
!
" i hear fomr springfield way
?
) so tjhe movei isnt cliched
. big deel
, waht dont ytou expect fomr a ganster
- flick
? well yuo expect qualiy acation sequences
adn bravado performances infront abondance if its gogin tothe be a decent exemple ofthe thte genre
. donnie brasco fails onthe both counts
. thte acation scenes never ries above thge ordinary
adn depp ' s woeful performence tends tothe smother tjhe ogod
- wrok ofthe his comrades
. admitedly
, pacino doens nothing newyorker
adn michael madsen
( sonny
) simpley smirks his way thru hte picture liuke a slightly subdued mr
. white
,
bu both posess an unmistakable sly charm
. depp usualy exhibits a bited ofthe clas himselv
,
bu regrettably
, bieng inspite tyhe presense ofthe noe ofthe his betters must haev left him star
- striked
, forthe he isnt completelyl hell
- bent onthe mimicking pacino ' s well
- earned high stlye
. hte consequences are painful tothe watch
. its noone exaggeration tothe sday thyat yhe film ' s credibility isnt seriously strained by tghe sighth ofthe tyhe pistone familiy ' s uncanny ablity tothe keep a straight face infact front ofthe theri breadwinner ' s phony brooklyn accent
. perheaps we shouldnt tkae pity onthe hte makers ofthe donnie brasco
. mabey a scrupulous adherance tothe pinpoint acuracy demanded tiered dialogue
anbd senarios weakly riminicent ofthe clasic ganster ficks
. if htis isnt indeed teh case
, surelly thge makers ofthe donnie brasco sould hve explored hte fascinating possiblilty tath amercia ' s underworld isnt commited tothe emulating
, albiet inaddition heavily attenuated form
, theri movei namesakes
. depp sould ahev poignantly palyed a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he isnt forced tothe mimic big
- screen ganster greats
. who konws whta insights inot tyhe criminal psyche sould hvea arisen
?
bu
hten agian
, prehaps donnie brasco isn ' t so true aftter all
