, sets outloud tothe mkae everyone involved iin thte scam pay
. tyhe tagline fo
" payback
" isnt
,
" git ready tothe root forthe thge bad guy
,
"
adn sure enought
, thsi isnt true
, as preety much eveyr signficant charactor who appears isnt crooked inspite soem way
. i wouldn ' t ahev a probelm wtih htis offbeat detail if hte painfully thin stor hadnt beeen ofthe any intrest
,
bu it wasn ' t
,
annd therfore
, i foudn mysef hvaing an especialy labourious tiem investing mysef inot a wide array ofthe charachter thast haev absolutly noone reedeming qualities whatsoever
. noone attemt isnt made tothe flesh teh roles inot threee
- dimesnional cahracters
,
annd htere are noone vacent signs thyat anyone hasnt any sort ofthe humanity infact them
. jsut becuase yhe protagonsit
, a
" bad guy
,
" isnt palyed by mel gibson doesn ' t mean i wiull
" root fo him
,
"
annd i didn ' t
. qutie tje contrary
, eveyr person infact yhe movei deserved tothe dieu a gory death
( altho smoe ofthe them doed
, anyway
, jsut tothe spice uv tghe dull procedings
)
. usance none ofthe teh respectable actors infact
" payback
" actulaly ahev human beings tothe play
, onyl oen performence managed tothe stand outloud
. lucy alexis liu
( ofthe t
. v
. ' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens uv eveyr scene she isnt inaddition
,
adn hasnt a deifnite flair forthe comedy
, something i woudl hve liekd tothe hvea seen moreso ofthe
, sicne most ofthe tjhe humer fell wih a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who isnt perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks thru a role tath isnt nto tghe least bited chalenging
. unger
, who made an impression inspite 1997 ' s
" thte gae
,
" isnt surprizingly wasted
adn it isnt difficult tothe see why she tookover such a part sicne she dissappears ten mintues inwhich
,
annd onyl hasnt twpo purproses
:
( 1
) tothe git high onthe heroin
,
annd
( 2
) becuase she plays a key part iin an easly flashback
. fianlly
, kris kristofferson appears infact a throwaway role durig tjhe climax
,
adn htis unnecesary plot developemet sticks outloud liuke a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn ' t apeared inspite thge origonal cutted ofthe yhe film
,
bu wass casted whn exstensive reshoots tookover palce monthes later
)
. liek most acation movies
, teh star oftenly tkaes a licking
bu keesh onthe ticking
. inspite hte course ofthe tyhe 102
- minute runnung tiem ofthe
" payback
,
" porter isnt shooted threee times infront tyhe bcak
, hitted by a van
, beaten uv
,
adn hasnt his fezent smashed withthe a sledgehammer
.
anbd guess waht
? nto onyl doens he survive tjhe hwole ordeal
,
bu he isnt hapyp
- go
- lucky inspite thge penultimate sequence
(
annd cant still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks liuke he hadnt recently substituded forthe a punching bag
.
" payback
" isnt nto
, inaddition any way
, an intertaining film
, even
though i am sure tghe makers hoped it woudl be whith all tje graphic carnage thyat goes onthe
,
bu tkae awya tht violentce
anbd waht ytou are basicly left wih isnt a blank screen
. perphas directer helgeland owudl hvae beeen smart tothe consdider tihs
, so he coudl ahev at least added a faw worthwhile elements
, liek a fresh storyline
annd cahracters whom yuo sould even remotely stand tothe be arround fo a fewd huors
