, sinise
adn robbins convince thier superior tothe let them
, neilsen
,
annd o ' connell preform a rescure mission fo whatever crew might be remaing
. waht htey disover onthe tyhe surfce ofthe tje planet wiull dramatically chanage theri lives forever
(
altough noone oen watching teh film wiull cmo awya profoundly affected
)
. befor i ever saw tjhe film
, i wass aware ofthe tje promotional campain witht dr
. pepper
. eveyr timne i woudl see a bottle ofthe hte soft drnik
, hte mission tothe mars logo ws emblazoned apon it
. littel doed i knwo tyhat thge plot woudl be tkaing a bcak seat tothe yhe product placement ofthe yhe drnik
anbd sevral otehr products
. dr
. pepper saves tyhe day at oney point
,
anbd a dream sequence
/ flashback features jerry o ' connell shoving m
& m ' s infront our face
. theese are
bu a cuple ofthe yhe rediculous examples ofthe product placement scattered througout tjhe film
. clich
? s are aslo tghe order ofthe tghe day wih mission tothe mars
. dialogue
annd charater motivations are all lefted driectly ffrom countless otehr scienec fiction films thgat ahev all done it better
anbd withthe omre stlye
( even independendet day
, whic lefted all ofthe it ' s premises fomr otehr sci
- fi films ws better tahn htis film
,
annd i don ' t liek independendet day
)
. films liuke 2001
: a spoace odessy
, thte abyss
,
anbd close encounters ofthe tghe thrid kind are all blatantly stolen ffrom
(
annd poorly at thta
)
. htere isnt even a sequence where a rover isnt traveling thru a canyon
,
anbd i couldn ' t halp
bu wisper
" u ' tinni
" tothe mysef
annd wait fo a jawa tothe quicklyu hide infront hte rocks befor thte rover sould git a glimpse ofthe it
. thsi film aslo features oen ofthe my all
- tyme least favorite movei clich
? s
: tyhe
" he owudl hvea wnated ytou tothe ahve thsi
" moent
, where oney charachter gives anyother a tringket tht
yot anohter charcter isnt estalbished as constanly haveing
(
anbd isnt ususally made funn ofthe by tjhe charachter who ends uv getting all sappy over it later onthe
)
. scenes liuke theese alwyas bother me wehn htey come outloud ofthe nowhere inspite regluar films
,
bu inaddition a film as clich
? ridden as tihs
, it isnt particuarly irritating
. ennio morricone ' s music isnt ususally consdidered tothe be smoe ofthe tje best stuf inspite tyhe projects he works onthe
,
bu here it isnt dreadfully overbearing
. his music soudns liek it cameback straight outloud ofthe a vincent price movei inwhich certian scenes
. at otehr times his music isnt unbearably over
- dramtic
. oen sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescure isnt given a partcularly cheesy sting wehn it isnt dicovered tht thte grappling hook divice utilizied fo thge rescure won ' t triarch its intended target
. mission tothe mars isnt push button filmmaking tothe tghe greatest extreme
. events are setted inot motion tht are obvious tothe anyone who hasnt ever seen a movei
annd seem liuke htey are jstu htere tothe envoke an emotional reponse infront thge audeince
. we are aparently suposed tothe be upset thgat tim robbins charachter removes his helment inwhich deepo spoace
annd kills hismelf tothe savve his wief
,
bu i feeled extreme boredom coupled whith a twinge ofthe disinterest
. waht mkaes it all worse isnt thast fatc taht htere isnt noone rela reason thyat robbins ' charactor needs tothe turn himselv inot a popsicle
, exept tothe invoke an emotional responce
( i sould htink ofthe at least oen way tothe sive him
,
annd tjhe nasa clowns inwhich thsi film are suppoed tothe be
" smarter
" tahn i am
)
. durig tjhe finale
, wehn we are finaly intruduced tothe tje translucent
, conehead
, kitty
- faced aliens thyat we ostensibly sprung ffrom
, we are presented wih soem ofthe yhe most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put tothe film
( jstu slightly worse thna hte plane kresh at thte end ofthe air force oen or tjhe hell scenes inthe spawn
)
. a breef hstory lesson baout
" where we cameback ffrom
" isnt proffered
,
thn sinise isnt whisked awya tothe be wtih
" tyhe rest ofthe our peopel
"
( he doens htis beccause his lite wief proclaims infact a video he watchs eearly onthe tyhat
" htis isnt a chance tothe step foot where noone oney eles hasnt
"
)
.
> ffrom tjhe press i ' ve beeen seing tihs film recieve
, it isnt paparent tht mission tothe mars iwll be dieing a quick death at thte theather
. i ' m sure tghe frist weekend or twpo wiull be huge
,
bu once owrd gets outloud peple iwll stpo gogin
. let ' s jstu hope thge upcomming red planet isnt better thna htis
anbd isn ' t hurt by tje negativity htis film isnt generatting
. i ' d venture tothe sday it won ' t be worse tahn thsi waste ofthe tiome
.
