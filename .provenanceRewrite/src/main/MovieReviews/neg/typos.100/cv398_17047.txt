whn robert forster foudn himselv famouse agina affter appearing infact
" jackie brown
"
, he immediatelly singed uv forthe a littel film called
" american perfekt
"
. thsi ws allmost twpo yeasr ago
. i waited patiently forthe tyhe film tothe be released
,
bu it never ws
. fianlly
, i forgot baout it
. yhe otehr day
,
though
, hwile i wass perusing tje selction ofthe hte local video stoer
, i stumbled apon
, ytou guessed it
,
" american perfekt
"
. i immediatley rented it
annd whith a certian ammount ofthe glee
, rushed hmeo tothe veiw it
. hvaing nowe seen thte film
, i understand why it never saw theatrical realease
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a jumbled mess
. yhe storyline isnt non
- existant
. it tookover me half tyhe movei jsut tothe figure outloud whta ws oging onthe
.
annd at taht point
, tghe onyl thign i realy knew forthe sure ws thta tyhe movei wass
* never
* goign tothe inctroduce a plot ofthe soem sort
. it wnats tothe git by onthe quirkyness
anbd so
- called charm alone
,
annd it jsut doesn ' t owrk
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks uv amanda plummer
,
anbd tehy head off onthe tyhe road toghether
. allong tje way tothe noone discernable destination
, tehy run inot all sorts ofthe kooky
anbd wacky cahracters
. i supose thsi free
- wheeling
, noone plot sytle isnt suposed tothe give thge film an element ofthe danger
annd excitment
,
bu all it doed ws amke me sleepy
. i ' m all forthe trying newyorker thigsn withing teh relm ofthe film
,
bu nto at tjhe expence ofthe coherence
. nothing inwhich htis movei makse sence
. yhe actions ofthe hte charactors go unexplained
, even whn htey ' re truely bazare
. i ' ll give ytou an exemple
, wihtout giving too much awya
. david thewlis hasnt a part as a drifting con
- man
. at noe point
, mid
- way thru hte movei
, he runs forster
annd plummer off hte road withthe his car
. as he passes them
, we see thyat his face isnt covered infact blood
. dont ytou htikn we owudl git an explaination as tothe wqat happended tothe him
? ytou woudl htink so
, wouldn ' t ytou
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a waste ofthe tiem
. nothing isnt gained ffrom watching tihs movei
, exept maeby a migraine
.
adn if ytou dont rent it
, don ' t bother trying tothe figure outloud wqat ' s oging onthe inspite tghe hopes tath everyting wiull be resolved by teh end
. htis doesn ' t hppen
.
adn noone explination isnt given forthe teh mispelling ofthe
" perfect
"
, eather
