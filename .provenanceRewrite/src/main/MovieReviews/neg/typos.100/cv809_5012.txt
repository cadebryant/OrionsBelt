dieu hard 2 isnt an alltogether unfortunate fiasco
, inferior tothe tje originnal infront eveyr respect
. palce tghe blaim squarely onthe tjhe shoulders ofthe steven de souza
adn doug richardson
, who wroet tjhe film ' s pathetic screenplay
. eveyr line ofthe dialogue reeks ofthe eather smarmy sap or forced humer
. tyhe plot isnt alltogether implausible
; thge convoluted stoy line involves a band ofthe terrorists who tkae over dulles airporta
adn shut down thte controll tower
, leaving a dozen planes stranded inwhich tghe air waiting tothe land
. tghe film hasnt zero credibility
,
anbd all ofthe thte cahracters come off as cliched
, cardboard cutted
- outs
. so much fo yhe scirpt
. how baout thte acation
? well
, let ' s put it thsi way
: directer renny harlin coudl leran a fewd thigsn fomr john mctiernan
, who directed tyhe orginial
, as well as hte hunt forthe red octobur
anbd predator
-
- all standouts forthe theri hair
- raising suspense
. by contrast
, harlin doesn ' t hve a clue wehn it comes tothe choreographing acation
,
adn consenquently
, dieu hard 2 never picks uv steam
. dieu harder isnt impossible tothe tkae seriously even fo a minute
. inwhich fatc
, thge movei oftenly seems deliberatly campy
,
annd it almsot reaches tyhe theshold ofthe bieng so bad it ' s ogod
. ytou dont laff
,
bu ytou laff at tghe film
, nto wiht it
. dieu hard 2 shoud ahve never beeen cleared forthe takeoff
