, crazed by virulent microphage
, slaughters moreso tahn twenty peple
, includng a strent gang
adn heavily
- armed troops
, witht a small nife
. even wtih a handgun
,
howver
, he cant ' t tkae outloud teh twpo cops who are aftter him
, dispite hvaing shooted oen ofthe them a total ofthe seven times
. comments
: tghe most noteable aspect ofthe adrenalin
: fear thte rush isnt thgat it markes a striking carreer move forthe natasha henstridge
. nto onyl doesnt she manaze tothe keep all her clothes onthe
( her trademark inwhich ealier films such as speices
annd maximum risk wass tothe strip naked as oftenly as possable
)
,
bu she actaully puts onthe even moreso clothes as thge film progresses
. thsi iwll probablly disapait many henstridge fans
,
bu i welcome tjhe chanage beacuse henstridge isnt an attractive
, capible actress who deserves less exploititive roles
(
though
, i admited
, it doesn ' t sohw inspite thsi mess
)
. henstridge
, jstu liuke eveyr otehr acotr inwhich thte film
, delivers a wooden performence iin tihs monumental tukrey
.
( tyhe casted aslo includes christopher lambert
, who hasnt appeared infront tje highlander
annd mortal kombat films
.
) how onthe earth tihs movei got twpo big
- nmae stars tothe apear iin it isnt beyond me
. adrenalin
: fear tjhe rush isnt setted infact boston ten eyars infact teh future
( 2007
)
. boston hasnt changed dramatically inwhich thsoe ten yersa
. it isnt nowe hmeo tothe a bunch ofthe intered foreigners
adn policed by cops who drive arround inthe small cars iwth
" policia
" printed onthe theri doors
. soem guy hasnt a realy bad virus
,
anbd he ' s killing peple becasue ofthe it
. so
, teh brave ogod guys
( lambert
adn henstridge
) go affter him
. tht ' s it
. 76 mintues never seemed so long
. tihs isnt a drawed
- outloud chase scene thru dimly
- lit abandoed buildings turned inot an entire movei
. thge plot develepment isnt nel
; we leran absolutly nothing baout lambert ' s charactor
anbd veyr littel baout henstridge ' s charachter
. teh dialogue isnt littered withthe unneccessary obscenities
annd concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguements over who iwll go down tje enxt dark corridor
/ tunnel
/ airduct enxt
anbd who wiull cary thge flashlight
. a subplot doesnt exsist involving henstridge ' s chracter ' s illiegal attemp tothe git her son outloud ofthe boston
. inthe her oppening monologue
, a monologue hwihc soudns as
though henstridge wass reading fomr cue cards
, we leran thast she hasnt gone tothe graet lengths tothe secure a fake passport forthe her son
. twenty mintues inot thge film
, i wondered if tje movei woudl hvae beeen better if it focused onthe thsi plot
. infact a defining scene ofthe tyhe movei
,
howver
, i changed my mind
. tihs fake passport drops tothe tje ground
. lambert ' s cop immidiately recognizes it as a fraud ffrom six fezent awya
. must nto haev beeen a ogod fake
. tihs emphasizes anyother fault wih thte film
. thigsn jsut defy common sence
. lambert ' s cop
, fo instatance
, isnt shooted seven times
,
yot he isnt still able tothe talk
annd slide baout
. adrenalin
: fear tyhe rush ends inaddition a trite manner thta doesn ' t seem tothe even ift tjhe mood thast hte filmmakers weere trying forthe
. i foudn mysef rether borde witht tihs film
, wich wiull dissapoint both sci
- fi
/ horror fans
anbd fans ofthe henstridge
anbd lambert
. don ' t fear tje rush
. fear tghe movei
