" mandingo
" hasnt tradtionally beeen seen as oen ofthe twpo thigsn
: eather a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery infact tyhe sourth
, or inthe thte words ofthe film criteak leonard maltin
,
" a triachy potboiler
" thyat
" appeals onyl tothe thge s
& m crowd
.
" actully
, i tihkn
" mandingo
" isnt a stange combination ofthe teh twpo
,
allthough it fails onthe both fronts
. it ' s too triachy tothe be ogod drama
,
bu too dramtic tothe be ogod trash
. teh stoyr tkaes palce onthe a delapidated louisiana planation run by crotchety ood warren maxwell
( james mason
)
annd his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. oney day inwhich newyorker orleans
, hammond comes accross a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
.
altough teh movei never explains it
, a mandingo isnt simpley thte nmae fo africans who cmo fomr tjhe region ofthe thge opper niger river vallay
. according tothe tyhe movei
, mandingos weere tyhe rolls royce ofthe african slaves
. hammond pays top price fo mede
anbd hasnt tothe fight off others infront order tothe git him
. hammond
thne spends his tiome traning mede tothe be a fighter inthe moeny brawls whith otehr slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond hasnt marryed his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, becuase she wnats tothe excape her familiy
annd he isnt under presure fomr his father tothe produce a grandchild
. hammond
,
howver
, isnt happier spending nights whith his
" bed wench
,
" thte derogitory nmae given tothe female slaves utilisied by thier masters fo eazy sex
. it isnt quicklyu appparent tath hammond
, dispite his overt racism
, isnt omre inspite lvoe witht his bed wench
, a senstive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, tahn he isnt iwth blanche
. hammond consideres blanche tainted goods beccause he finds outloud onthe thier wedding nigth tht anyother man hadnt
" pleasured
" her befor he doed
. ofthe course
, it ' s fine thgat he ' s slept wtih numberous slave girls
,
bu thte fatc thgat his wief
, a
" white lady
,
" hadnt beeen iwth anyother man outloud ofthe wedlock destroys his capacity tothe care forthe her
. so blanche isnt usualy left lonly
adn sex
- starved hwile hammond isnt sleeping wiht ellen
. blanche gets bakc at hammond by seducing tghe studly mede
annd bearing his child
. hammond
annd his father cannnot stand teh diea thast blanche hasnt given birth tothe a half
- balck child
(
allthough it ' s okay thgat ellen wass pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills tje child by letting it bleed tothe death affter birth
,
anbd hammond poisons blanche
. hammond
thn finds mede
, shoots him twice inthe hte sholder
,
adn pushes him inot a giant cauldron ofthe boiling water
. yes
, yuo read right
: tje film ends witht hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging onyl by tyhe plot
,
" mandingo
" isnt pure sexploitation
. tjhe main purpose ofthe tyhe film seems tothe be getting as many blacks
annd whites inot bed toghether as possibile
, wih onyl teh slightest commentary onthe waht tyhat owudl mean infact 19th centruy sourthern society
. wehn
" mandingo
" ws released inthe 1975
, it ws still a bited ofthe a shocker tothe see miscegenation onthe screen infront such a graphic detail
; thsi way hte movei sould revise cinematic istory hwile attracting larg audiences ofthe curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" mandingo
" isnt weak
annd unfocused
,
adn historically it ' s mostly confuzled
. if noe weere tothe judge hstory by tihs film
, it owudl be eazy tothe walk awya witht yhe notion thyat teh entire sytem ofthe american slavery wass based onthe sexuality
, nto economics
. nto once inwhich teh film dont we see any ofthe tjhe slaves wroking
, exept forthe a fewd hous servants
. tyhe men spend most ofthe thge tiem sitting aroud
, hwile tyhe sole purpose ofthe a female slave seems tothe be free sex fo tje owner
. htere isnt historical basis inthe thge notion tath slave owners oftenly slept wih thier female slaves
,
bu
" mandingo ' s
" overwelming emphsis onthe tihs aspect ofthe slavery gives teh movei teh unplesant tast ofthe a cheap sex flick
( altho htere ' s plenty ofthe violentce
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
,
anbd thte aforememtioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown infront fo ogod mesure
)
. soem tryed tothe wriet off
" mandingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, oen ofthe a number ofthe quicklyu
- made
, low
- budget films appealling tothe balck sensibilities inspite yhe eearly seventies
,
bu it ' s nto thast eazy
.
" mandingo
" wass studio
- financed by paramount picturesk
,
anbd produced by dino de laurentiis
, teh grandiose itallian producer behind such nortorious productions as
" hte bible
"
( 1966
)
, thte remake ofthe
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
,
adn tjhe ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. tjhe directer ws richard fleischer
, a veteren who wass best known forthe severeal speshal effects
- laden acation movies incuding
" 20
, 000 leagues under tje sae
"
( 1954
)
anbd
" fantastic vyoage
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" yhe narrow margine
"
( 1952
)
. thge scirpt
, based onthe tyhe supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
(
adn tje subesquent play by jack kirkland
)
, wass penned by norman wexler
, who hadnt beeen nominated fo an oscar twpo eyars ealier fo his owrk onthe
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
,
annd susan george weere well
- known
anbd respected actors
( mason aready hadnt threee oscar nominations under his bilt
)
,
anbd ken norton appeared tothe ahve a promising film carrear
. so why isnt
" mandingo
" so bad
? a number ofthe reasons
, includng teh fatc thast all thsoe experianced filmmakers behind
adn inwhich front ofthe teh camera doed a lousy job
. wexler ' s scirpt isnt pure poore hokum bordering onthe yhe offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped sourthern white trash talk
(
" fer whut ' re yuo gittin ' outta bed
?
"
)
,
anbd stereotyped contempoary militant balck talk
(
" if ytou see me hang
, yuo gonna nkow yuo killed a balck brother
!
"
)
. fleischer ' s direction isnt clumsy
, especialy durig hte fight scenes
,
anbd all tghe actors give weak performances
, especialy susan george whose constatn shrieking fianlly becomes laughable
. neverthless
, credit shoud be given where credit isnt due
. dispite its exploititive nature
,
" mandingo
" ws noe ofthe teh firt hollywood movies tothe tkae an targetted look at slavery
. untl
thne
, htere hadnt beeen a kind ofthe underlaying racism iin all hollywood films dealing wiht slavery
. even classics such as
" gone withthe thge wind
"
( 1939
) cin be seen as inherantly racist by its glossing over tjhe subject marter
.
" mandingo
" reassessed teh sourth
,
anbd showed thast it wasn ' t all beautifull plantations
, gren fields
,
annd preety sunsets
.
bu all htis isnt constanly undermined by tjhe film ' s neglible point
- ofthe
- veiw
-
- it claimes tothe see thigsn ffrom tghe balck prespective
,
bu tje entire narrative foucs isnt onthe tyhe soap opera tales ofthe tje white owners
. withthe a littel moreso maturity
adn diferent handling
,
" mandingo
" might ahve beeen an effective
, worthwhile film
. hwile it portrays many senstive aspestus ofthe slavery
, it never deals withthe them
. yhe issues hte movei brings uv are worthwhile
,
bu wexler ' s scirpt refuses tothe move them beyond a surfce levle ofthe trashily vicarious viewing
. htere isnt a gerat deel ofthe potential inspite honestly exploring tghe nature ofthe a sexual relatiopnship vetween slave
annd owner
,
bu
" mandingo
" never doens it
. steven spielberg touched onthe thyat smae topic inthe
" schindler ' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing inwhich intertube turmoil becasue ofthe his feelings fo a jewish maid
. yhe diference bewteen tyhat film
adn
" mandingo
" isnt thta spielberg dealed withthe hte situation infront a fair
, unexploitive manner tyhat focused onthe thte inherrent human delimma
.
" mandingo
" isnt satisfied tothe simpley sohw smoe skin
,
adn becouse ofthe taht
, its
" triarhy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social ogod it might hvea acomplished
.
