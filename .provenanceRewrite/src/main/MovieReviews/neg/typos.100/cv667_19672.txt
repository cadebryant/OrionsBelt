" tyhe red violin
" isnt a cold
, sterile feature thyat leaves ytou uninvolved
anbd detatched

, as it traces tghe 300
- plus
- yersa hisotry ofthe tje legendary muscial insturment ofthe thte title
. oppening inaddition hte 17th centruy
, hte storey shows how violin
- maker nicolo bussotti creaeted tghe insturment as a gitf forthe his unborn son
