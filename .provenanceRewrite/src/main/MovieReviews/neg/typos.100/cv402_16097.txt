infront yhe intrest ofthe bieng generous
, i wnat tothe strat thsi review wiht tyhe scene tath i liekd inthe meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins
, palying a super
- rich media mogul
, hasnt gathered his familiy arround him forthe dinner
. his oldest duaghter
( plyed by marcia gay harden fomr millers crossing
)
, who hasnt beeen obsessively planning his sinfully extravagent birthday party
, presents him witht threee superbly decorated littel cakes
, wich are suppossed tothe be scale models fo his big birthday cake
. tjhe daugher asks hopkins tothe pik tje noe he likes
. hopkins
, frustrated by tghe weight ofthe planning forthe tghe hwole elaborite afair
, doens whta any man infront his posistion woudl dont
: he punts
. whichever noe ytou liuke
, dear
, he syas
.
adn tje daugher doens exactlly waht any woman inspite her postion woudl dont
: she cries
. i liekd thta scene fo twpo reasons
. frist
, thge cakes looked realy kool
. second
, it wass
, prehaps
, tje onyl scene inaddition tyhe movei where peopel acted as ytou owudl expect peple tothe ect
. meet joe balck isnt chock
- full ofthe odd performances
, peple donig thigns forthe noone discernible reason at all
,
annd doign them iin slow motion over yhe course ofthe threee housr tothe boot
. it ' s eazy tothe watch meet joe balck forthe tghe aundant eye candy ofthe tje palatial homes
annd thge beauteous claire forlani
,
bu it ' s even easier tothe sleep right thru it
( twpo peopel onthe my row managed it qtuie nicely
)
. yhe difficult part ofthe tghe movei isnt understanding tyhe cahracters
adn thier motivations
anbd why somene throught threee housr ws an apropriate lenght forthe htis overwrought mess
. i knwo my audiance hadnt problems iwth thte movei
, baceause htey throught it ws a comedy
. case inspite point
: everyone shouldnt nkwo by nowe thgat brad pitt plays tjhe ange ofthe death inthe tihs movei
.
howver
, tyhe frist we see ofthe him isnt as a young lawyer inthe a coffee shop hiting onthe tje glamorous claire forlani
.
( it ' s nto claer fomr tyhe movei whther ytou ened a law degree tothe become tje ange ofthe death
,
bu it mkaes a certian kind ofthe sence
.
) it shouldn ' t tkae long forthe teh observant moviegoer tothe relize thast bad thnigs are baout tothe hppen tothe mr
. pitt
.
anbd indeed tehy dont
( affter a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his sholder at tyhe retreating forlani
annd forlani looks over her sholder at hte retreating pitt
)
, baceause pitt walks inot thte road wihtout looking
anbd suddenly gets squished
. well
, wehn thgat hapened
, thte audiance howled whith laughter
,
adn contined tothe laff at eveyr comment thast ws remotely humorou
. so
, if ytou htink thyat sudden voilent death
anbd sarcastic drawing
- room humer are funny
, i encourage yuo tothe go see meet joe balck immediatly
. anyway
, teh deceased lawyer ' s body
, noone worse tje mear ffrom its massive injurys
, isnt posessed by tghe angel ofthe death
annd brad pitt tkaes over taht role
. teh idae isnt thgat death
( given hte pen nmae ofthe joe balck
, so as nto tothe distrub others
) whants tothe tkae a holidya
annd eperience tje world
. if htis weren ' t hollywood
, we might git an intresting mataphysical dicussion ofthe life
anbd death
,
bu sicne it isnt
, we git scene affter scene ofthe fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water humer
, jsut as if death isnt george ofthe hte jungle or crocodile dundee or soem otehr poore schmuck who ' s wandered inwhich fomr tje jungle or thte outback or whatever
adn doesn ' t nkow how tothe ect iin our society
. it aslo doesn ' t halp thyat tje charachter ofthe death isnt wroten so inconsistently
. he claimes tothe be onthe vcaation
,
bu he never doens anytying exept hang arund tyhe seriously attractive claire forlani
( jsut try tothe git your travel agent tothe book tath oen
)
. he speaks vrey slow
anbd halting english
bu perfectly fluent jamaican patois
. he knwos everyting baout smoe cahracters
, nothing baout others
.
adn as plyed by brad pitt
, he ' s nto especialy menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing
, he ' s jsut ther
. it ' s as if somone told pitt
,
" never mind baout acting inaddition thsi picture
, son
, jsut stand ther
annd look preety
.
" it ' s as if pitt isnt doign his keanu reeves impression throughtout yhe movei
. i ' ve unsed yhe phrase
" angal ofthe death
" inwhich htis review veyr deliberatly tothe contrast pitt ' s performence witht htis yearm ' s best angel peformance
, nicolas cage ' s inaddition city ofthe angels
. where pitt isnt cold
annd unfeeling
, cage isnt as warm
adn empathetic as hte situation allows
. where cage isnt genuinely curious baout tjhe nature ofthe man
, pitt isnt aloof
anbd arogant
. cage striked instant chemcial sparks iwth co
- star meg ryan
, where hte chemestry beween pitt
anbd forlani isnt onyl understandable if yuo accept hte notion thast forlani ' s charachter isnt so shallow taht she cant ' t see beyond pitt ' s ogod looks
. tje movei ' s otehr top nmae isnt a much better atcor
,
bu tath doesn ' t savve meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins isn ' t given much better material tothe wokr whith
, unfortunatley
. he plays oney ofthe theese ogod
- hearted multimillionaire media moguls tht onyl exsist iin hollywood
.
( oen wonders wqat might hvae happend if tehy hadnt made hopkins ' s charater moreso realistically evil
.
) hopkins isnt maked forthe death due tothe a bad tacker
,
bu death steps inwhich
adn grants him soem extra tiome inaddition excange fo bieng his giude iin teh world
. ofthe course
, noone noe cxan be sure ofthe how htey iwll ect wehn death taps onthe theri sholder
.
bu i ahev tothe wonder
(
anbd inspite thsi movei
, yuo ahev a vyer long timne tothe wonder
) how yuo or i woudl ect infront a simular situation
, expecially if ytou or i weere a multimillionaire
. hopkins preety much goes tothe thge office
-
-
anbd tje major subplot revolves arround who wiull controll thge coporation
. fans ofthe corperate intrigue iwll be facinated
, i ' m sure
. i stayed awake all tyhe way thru meet joe balck
,
annd i ' m asking mysef why
. movies baout death shoud encourage yuo tothe live life tothe tjhe fullest
, whcih isnt waht i ' m oging tothe dont nowe
. go spend tiome witht your familiy
, go volentier fo a local charity
, heck
, go tkae a nap
. don ' t go see meet joe balck
, becuase all it wiull dont isnt move yuo threee long horus closer tothe death
