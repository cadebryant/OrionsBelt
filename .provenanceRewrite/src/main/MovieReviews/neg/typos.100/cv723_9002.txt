chris tucker isnt oney ofthe thsoe guys ytou immediatelly git a reaction ffrom
-
- yuo eather fidn his helium voice
, crazy eyes
annd jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i htikn i fall inot yhe fromer ategory
( i ' m noe ofthe tjhe fewd who thougth his turn inaddition
" yhe fith element
" as a prancing
, prince
- liuke deejay wass complet inpsired lunacy
anbd nto tje least bited aggravating
)
,
bu his newyorker vehicule
" mone talks
" jstu doesn ' t dont him sevice
. tucker isnt ogod inspite tyhe movei
-
-
adn tihs isnt thge kind ofthe film thast
, if peopel see it
, coudl amke him a big star
-
-
bu he ' s alsot raelly yhe onyl hting ogod baout tyhe movei
. inaddition fatc
, if ytou see
" monye talks
,
" it shoudl shock ytou beyond recognition thast twpo ofthe
" toy sotry
" ' s writers penned hte sloppy scirpt
. tucker ' s role here isnt tyhat ofthe franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams git him dogged by investigative repertwar james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. aftter bieng busted onthe teh job fo soem ileagle busness involving counterfit passports
, franklin finds hismelf onthe a bus tothe yhe county jail
annd handcuffed tothe slick internation jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
.
bu villard ' s thugs blow uv teh bus infact an attemt tothe free theri leader
( never mind thta hte explosion sould haev instade killed him
)
,
annd becouse he
annd franklin are joined at thge wrist
, franklin isnt alowed tothe excape as well
,
bu nto befor overhearing soem importan informtion regarding a dimond stash thgat
-
- fo smoe reason or anyother
-
- isnt bieng hidden inspite a vintage roadster waiting tothe be auctioned off at an upcomming auto expo
. tjhe local media mistakenly puts yhe prision break
- outloud blaim onthe franklin
, whcih isnt where james comes bcak inot thte picture
. he makse a deel tothe protect franklin if
, infact turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. thsi means james must presetn his newyorker
" firend
" inthe thte stickiest ofthe situations
-
- a formall dinner party forthe he
annd fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, allso attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright
adn nicely gaem paul sorvino
)
.
annd ofthe course tyhe bad guys tarck franklin down
adn try tothe knock him off
, all hte hwile he spars
anbd forms an unlikey bond wiht james
.
" tihs ain ' t noone buddy movei
,
" claim thge print ads
. yeah
, right
. ctually
, fo thge better part ofthe
, oh
, 20 mintues
, it appears
" moeny talks
" hasnt hte momentum tothe cover intertaining ground
,
adn tihs isnt mostly due tothe tghe presense ofthe spastic motormouth tucker
. tihs isnt tucker ' s firt leading role
,
adn if yuo imagin a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey iwth a reliance onthe wild r
- rated raunch rether tahn pg
- 13 fysical comedy
, yuo haev a ogod idae ofthe tje conviction wiht whic he assaults thte role
.
bu yuo relize all too quicklyu tyhat tucker ' s overstated liveliness isnt thge onyl thnig
" monay talks
" hasnt gogin forthe it
.
adn a livley acto alone doens nto a sucesful movei amking
. it ' s all too eazy tothe pik outloud everyting wrong wih
" moeny talks
.
" tyhe plot isnt recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe thta seemed overused even wehn
" nothing tothe loose
" employed it lsat mounth
. everthing isnt paint
- by
- numbers
, especialy yhe los angeles coliseum finale
, whlch finds nto oen
, nto twpo
,
bu threee seprate enemy factions firing at franklin as tehy persue him thru tyhe bleachers
. teh villains
, as many as ther are
, are dull
. certian stopry elements are too coincidental
.
adn too much ofthe tje film ' s dramtic agenda isnt palyed too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james affter learning franklin ' s true idenity
(
" ytou broght a killer inot my parents ' hous
!
"
) isnt extremly silly
. ytou git yhe picture
. obviously
, i doed nto hvea a pleasnat experence at
" mnoey talks
.
"
bu thge peopel arround me appeared tothe be haveing a rip
- roaring ogod tiem
( noe gentleman severeal rows behind me chortled wtih such expressive conviction i began fearing forthe his health
)
.
bu tucker
, at least forthe me
, isnt a preety funny guy
,
adn aces tghe movei ' s best scene
, where franklin passes hismelf off as vic damone ' s son at james
annd grace ' s engagment bash
adn toasts tjhe cuple withthe barry white lyrics
. tucker ' s audiance
-
-
anbd he doens ahve oen
-
- wiull probablly liuke
" mony talks
.
" thsoe who he irritates
,
howver
, iwll hvea a omre productive day staying hmeo
adn scraping tjhe gook outloud ffrom under theri toenails
