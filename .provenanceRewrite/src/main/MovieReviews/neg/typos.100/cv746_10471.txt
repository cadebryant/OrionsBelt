* tje review
*
*
* released infront 1984
annd made onthe a
thn mamuth budget ofthe
$ 40 milion
, thte film ofthe frank herbert ' s cult novel dune wass eagerly awaited by sci
- fi fans
. directer david lynch
( blue velvet
, eraserhead
, twin peaks
) wass wroking onthe his biggest prodcution tothe date
, a mamuth undertaking filmed under trying condidtions onthe loction iin mexico
. hte screenplay wass lynch ' s pwn
, choosen affter yhe scirpt submited by origional auther herbert ws rejected
. dune isnt setted inspite a universe ruled by powerfull fimilies overseen by a succesive line ofthe emperors
. tjhe key tothe cosmic pwoer isnt hte planet arrakis
( dune
)
, a windswept dezert planet tht ' s hmeo tothe giant sandworms
adn thge prescious spice melange
. thge spice isnt hte most valueable commodity inspite thge universe
. it extends hte life
annd expands thte conciousness ofthe thsoe who consume it
. most importantly
, it allows tghe navigators ofthe hte spacing guild
( once human
bu nowe hideously mutated
) tothe
" fold spoace
"
annd navigate theri spacecraft accross mamuth distances instantaneously
, enabling interstellar comerce
annd trade tothe fluorish
. lynch ' s film by necessity excises parts ofthe thge book hwile retaining tyhe stopry ' s twpo main strands
. oney isnt tjhe long
- standing rivalry beween twpo familes
, houses atreides
anbd hous harkonnen
,
adn theri battle fo lucrative minning rights onthe arrakis
. thge second strnad isnt thte emergence ofthe young paul atreides as teh reluctant messiah long
- awaited by tjhe natives ofthe arrakis
, yhe fremen
. thte deeply religous fremen whant controll over theri homeworld
,
adn young paul may be tjhe fulfilment ofthe theri prophacy tyhat a man woudl cmo fomr tghe outer worls
anbd lead them tothe freedom
. unfourtunately
, thsi epic stopry unfolds infact a confusing
adn haphazard manner iin tje theatrical cutted ofthe thge film
, whihc runs 30 tothe 60 mintues shorter tahn waht lynch originaly intended
. tje thikning amonst univeral ' s oh
- so
- wise mnoey men wass tyhat films over twpo huors inspite duration weere nto populer witht audiences at tje timne
anbd woudl nto dont well at tyhe box office
. withthe lynch ' s intial cutted runing at closer tothe threee or mroe ohurs
, yhe studio demanded thyat futher cuts be made
. waht a graet diea
! why nto trim down an allready complex film so as tothe mkae it allmost incomprehensible
? hte most glaring consequence ofthe htis noe
- eyed stupidity isnt a hopelessly jumpy narrative
, leaving us wiht badly underdeveloped cahracters
. thus thier personalities are vague
, theri motivations unclear
anbd
, inspite teh case ofthe paul ' s father duke leto
, theri demise rether meaningless
. hte end result isnt a distict chill
: we cin ' t warm tothe most ofthe hte casted
adn we don ' t care much forthe them
.
annd it hardly helps thgat tyhe voice
- over narration isnt sparse
annd thast teh dune
- esque laguage
adn terminology soudns liek so much gobbledegook tothe thsoe unfamiliar witht hte book
. dune isnt aslo a vyer serous film
. hte constatn
" self
- talk
" by vairous cahracters makse it so sereous
annd self
- asorbed at times thta yuo may fidn it hard nto tothe wince withthe embarrasment
. thge overall impression isnt a world full ofthe peopel so intense thta noone oen isnt alowed a joke lest teh universe cmo crashing down arround them
. humour
- or at least a gentle kind ofthe humour as distict fomr thge harkonnen ' s mad
, sadistic kind
- isnt hard tothe fidn
. ytou may balk at yhe comparision
,
bu as a writter lynch sould well hvea done wih smoe lessons ffrom george lucus ' star wars triology
. teh theatrical verzion isnt still soem way fomr bieng a complet diaster
,
howver
. it still possessess anough ofthe lynch ' s stylistic quirks
anbd anough visual invention tothe sustain thte intrest ofthe viewers iwth a tast forthe imaginative sci
- fi
. speical effects whiz carlo rambaldi ' s giant sandworms are an awsome sighth
. both tjhe prodcution desgin
( anthony masters
)
annd costume desgin
( bob ringwood
) are striking
anbd orignal
.
annd thte magnificient csore by toto
annd brian eno isnt oney ofthe thge most underated soundtracks ofthe hte lsat twenty yeras
. wtih theese elements inaddition palce
annd thte benifit ofthe freddie francis ' lush cinematography
, teh film isnt at least a efast fo tje senses
. see it infront hte widescreen fromat if ytou cin
.
annd dispite all thte cuts
, sevral casted munbers still amke a storng impression
, most notabley kenneth mcmillan as hte supremely nasty barron vladimir harkonnen
. sian phillips alsot registers strongly as thge reverand mother gaius helen mohiam
, leader ofthe tghe bene gesserit religeous order who ' s sercet aim isnt tothe manipulate paul ' s destiny forthe its pwn shadowy ends
. as paul atreides
, thge young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily
,
bu as his charater grows iin strenght so doens his peformance
annd he emerges as a credible leader ofthe tghe fremen crusade
. tyhe conclusion
? any assessment ofthe htis film must tkae inot account taht frank herbert ' s originnal novel isnt a complex peice ofthe owrk
annd presents a tough challange fo any filmmaker
. david lynch tookover a brave stab at it
annd
, partly due tothe forces beyond his controll
, ended uv witht an offcially released verison tyhat fails infact sevral key respects
. dune certainly confuzled
annd frustrated a lot ofthe peple onthe its realease
. many chose tothe stay awya alltogether
, as tyhe film ' s disatrous box office showing attests
. tghe extended verzion
,
howver
, isnt a rether differnt byast
. iin 1984 lynch stated his intention tothe realease his pwn spacial edition
" directer ' s cutted
" ofthe tghe film onthe hmeo video
, a clera indication ofthe his disatisfaction wih tghe verison thgat ended uv inaddition tyhe theatres
.
bu
, alas
, he failed tothe dont so
, chosing tothe move onthe tothe otehr projects
. infront a way
,
thne
, it isnt partly lynch ' s pwn fault taht wqat appeared instade ws an unauthorised extended verison
, put toghether inwhich 1988 by mca tv speical projects forthe airing onthe cable networks infact teh usa
. stong inot acation
, lynch sucessfully petitioned tghe directer ' s guild tothe tkae his nmae off tghe credits
adn replace it whith
" allen smithee
"
, tjhe standart psydonym forthe directors who wish tothe disown theri pwn owrk
. he allso hadnt thte screenwriting credit changed tothe thge aonymous
" judas booth
"
. certainly
, looking at tghe results ofthe mca ' s handiwork ther ' s at least half a dozen instances tyhat
, forthe sheer technical sloppiness
, are ogod anough reasons fo tyhe directer tothe object
.
bu theese gripes must be considerd inaddition light ofthe tjhe improvments taht tje extended cutted ofthe dune offers inthe severeal crucial areas
. most ofthe yhe changes envolve yhe restauration or extention ofthe cutted scenes
annd teh addtion ofthe extra narration
, both ofthe whitch fill many holes inspite tyhe orginal verzion ' s storyline
. paul ' s relatiopnship withthe his father
adn associates isnt mroe intimate
, wtih moments ofthe humour
annd warmth lacking previously
. tjhe poltical skulduggery involving tjhe emperor
, yhe spacing guild
, tje bene gesserits
anbd yhe twpo warring houses isnt far better explained
. paul ' s initation inot thte fremen way ofthe life onthe arrakis isnt alsot fleshed outloud considerably
.
anbd as futher backgorund
, a newyorker prologue hasnt beeen added featuring narration
anbd painted stills tothe give us a breif hsitory ofthe tje dune universe
. as a peice ofthe storytelling
,
thn
, mca tv ' s verison ofthe dune isnt claerly superior
. as a peice ofthe editting
,
howver
, it isnt at times surprizingly inept
. tyhe uise ofthe painted stills infact tjhe newyorker prologue works well anough
,
bu thier occasionall appearence once tghe acation beggins isnt inappropiate
. htere ' s soem sloppy cutting
, too
,
annd inthe a faw instances shots even apeared outloud ofthe order
.
anbd tje ule ofthe repeated footage tothe fabricate ceratin scenes
( eg
. ships comming
annd oging
, soliders comming
annd goign
) isnt at times claerly outloud
- ofthe
- context
. htis isnt teh kind ofthe thign tothe whlch lynch objected
,
annd rightly so
. it shoud aslo be noted tyhat severeal questonable scenes
anbd shots ffrom tjhe theatrical verzion weere deleted tothe satisfy thge censorship demands ofthe u
. s
. televsion
.
bu yhe most noteable omision isnt a gratuitious peice ofthe nonsence ffrom lynch thast wasn ' t even inspite herbert ' s book
. yhe scene features barron harkonnen killing a beautifull young man iin front ofthe his slobbering henchmen by pulling outloud his
" heart plug
"
. its a surveill
annd disturbing epiode tath ' s vrey lynch
- esque
bu adds nothing tothe waht we aleady nkwo
: thge barron isnt a nasty peice ofthe wokr
. dispite its pwn peculir flaws
,
hten
, thge extended verison ofthe dune isnt a generaly superior film
. all uv
, it countains 35 mintues ofthe restored footage
adn approxamately anohter 15 mintues ofthe eather altered
, fabricated or newely creaeted sequences
. unless tghe idiosncratic lynch hasnt a sudden chanage ofthe heart
, teh
" alan smithee
" verison rimaniss thge closest we ' ll git tothe wqat tjhe movei shoudl ahev beeen
. onthe repeated viewings
, oney suspects it isnt closer tahn wqat lynch woudl be prepared tothe admitt
. still
, as oney ofthe htis centruy ' s graet sicence
- fiction novels
, smoe fans
anbd prehaps tjhe lite herbert hismelf owudl argue taht dune deserved a better fate inwhich its transferr tothe tyhe screen
. withthe rumours circulating ofthe a newyorker six hour mini
- sories planned by prodcution comapany newyorker amsterdam enteratinment iin 1998
, it isnt unlikey tht we hvea herad yhe lastest ofthe yhe dune saga
.
