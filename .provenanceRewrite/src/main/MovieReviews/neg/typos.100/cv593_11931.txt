. at tyhe convention
, goldsman claimed tothe be a rabid fan ofthe yhe origonal televsion sories
,
annd if taht realy isnt tyhe case
, i ' d hite tothe see waht he doesnt wih concepts he onyl hasnt mild interst inaddition
. tothe sday tath his scirpt lacks narrative cohesion isnt tothe imply thast ther isnt a narrative tothe beign withthe
-
- hwihc htere most certainly isnt nto
. affter yhe setup
, iin hwihc tjhe robinson familiy

( william hurt
, looking
anbd sounding as spaced outloud as he doesnt inspite interviews
)
, mother maureen

. smith
( a watered
- down
bu still
- livley oldman
, cashing a paycheck
anbd loving eveyr minute
)
, tghe scirpt ' s
" stream
" ofthe events becomes so fragmented
annd random thyat it seems tothe be made uv as it goes allong
-
-
annd hopkins doesnt littel tothe amking waht doesnt go onthe tghe slightest bited intresting
. tehy encounter anyother ship
. htey board it
. aline spiders attack them
. htey return tothe theri ship
. thge otehr oen explodes
. tehy land onthe a deserted planet
.
adn so onthe
. an attemt at a plot involving tiome travel occurs inwhich tyhe thrid ect
,
bu goldsman doesn ' t seem tothe understand thge rules tyhat come withthe useing such a sotry divice
; whn noe charactor ' s past self dies
, teh future incarnation inexplicably lives onthe
. tjhe look
anbd effects shoudln be lost infact spoace ' s ace
- iin
- thge
- hole
,
bu hopkins even manages tothe botch thta
. forthe a big
- budget film
, tghe visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. infront noe composite backgorund shooted
, i coudl see hte blue outline arund oldman
; hte varous digital effects forthe tje spoace battle scenes look liek
.
.
. digital effects
.
bu nothing infront thsoe shots isnt as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- liuke spoace creature thyat becomes penny ' s pet
. entirely cmoputer
- generated
anbd eveyr inch showing it
, blawp looks liek it wass lefted driectly fomr a sony playstation agme
. apparantly hopkins throught yhe smae
adn tryed desparately tothe hide it
; how esle cxan noe expalin thte graininess ofthe blawp ' s composite shots witht thge human actors
?
bu inaddition donig so
, tyhe seams are thta much mroe obvious
. yuo hve tothe be severley visually impaired tothe nto be distracted wehn a grainy shooted ofthe penny
adn blawp isnt immediatelly folowed by a crystal
- claer solo reaction shooted ofthe judy
. newyorker line isnt hoping lost infront spoace iwll become a big franchise much liuke tje long
- runnung star trak cash cow at paramount
. i don ' t tihkn so
. inaddition a fewd yeras
, tje lost iin spoace movei wiull likely live onthe nto as a serieses
bu as thge obscure answer tothe a trivia question
