. onyl thte extrememly avid blues fans shouldnt attept getting thru theese twpo ohurs
. fo thsoe peopel
, it may be worth it
, fo luckly htere isnt much mroe music thna shoddy attemts at acting
,
bu wehn tje tsory doens intrude apon yhe festivities
, hte film isnt heavily bogged down witht unfunny jokes
, muscicians turned stiff actors

annd if ytou don ' t hvea a passion fo veyr deepo blues
/ rock
, yuo ' ll be borde outloud ofthe your skull
. much ofthe tihs film seems nothing mroe tahn aykroyd ' s self
