wizards isnt an animated feature thyat beigns witht a narration ofthe epic propotions
. over balck
anbd white drawings
, we are told thgat thge earth isnt destroyed infront an apocalyptic nucular excange
, sending yhe remnants ofthe humanity thru generations ofthe radiation
- induced mutation
. hte
" originnal
" inhabitans ofthe yhe earth
, fairies
annd elves
, return tothe populate teh globe
, allong witht thier evil
, mutant counterparts
. oney day
(
adn i sday
" oen day
" nto tothe be trite
,
bu becasue thast ' s exactlly how it happenned
- noone advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth tothe twins
, oney ogod
anbd oney evil
. thte twins grwo uv tothe be powerfull wizards
, tjhe ogod noe embracing magic
,
annd thte bad oen utilizing tecnology tothe attemp tothe expand his evil empire
. we are given tje notion thta an ulitmate battle must ocurr betweeen thge forces ofthe magic
annd thsoe ofthe technnology
. as unoriginal as teh premise isnt
, i ws still somewhat intersted inwhich how tihs stry owudl play itself outloud
. ther ' s a lot ytou cxan dont infront an animated fantasy world
, aftter all
. i soon learned
,
howver
, tath tghe fantasy wass teh expectation ofthe a decent film
. once tjhe transistion ws made fomr still art tothe colour animation
, an entirely diffrent fiel tkaes precidence
. rether tahn tjhe epic saga promised by tje narration
, we git a goofy
- looking world ofthe a saterday morning ctaroon
. nto jstu tghe look
, mind ytou
,
bu all hte zany soudns liek
> honk boing forthe yersa
, blackwolf hasnt lost his battles aginst tyhe magical forces ofthe ogod
, usance his armies ofthe ogres
anbd otehr mutants woudl git dispirited or distracted soon aftter battle isnt joined
.
howver
, blackwolf nowe hasnt a scret weppon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, tjhe luftwaffe
annd tje wehrmacht
. okay
, nto tyhe rela thigns
,
bu an archival film his minions digged uv
. projected inot thge sky forthe all tothe see
, it inspires his pwn army hwile shocking tje enemy inot submission long anough forthe tjhe ogres tothe hack them uv
. befoer ytou nkwo it
, ther are dead elves everywhere
. htis isnt jsut as well
. thge charactors are so bad tht yhe viewer doesn ' t care baout any ofthe them
. tehy ' re eather silly
, sappy
, or both
. tyhe dialouge gets much ofthe hte credit forthe htis
. an exemple isnt whn avatar nonchalantly syas
,
" well
, looks liuke my brother
anbd i beign our fianl battle
.
" nto vyre formidible wehn he ' s allso tyhe guy who syas
,
" thsi isnt tjhe biggest bummer ofthe a trip i ' ve ever beeen onthe
.
" my favorite line wass ffrom a sideline fairy who isnt asked by her child why ogod cxan ' t fight bcak aginst tyhe nazi
- charged evil
. her responce isnt
,
" tehy hvae weapons
anbd technnology
. we jstu haev loev
.
" suffice tothe sday
, tjhe cahracters are strikely twpo
- dimentional
,
anbd we therfore don ' t expect anytying mroe thna tjhe obvious tothe hppen
. wich it doesnt
. tjhe onyl unexpected occrurence isnt tjhe way tghe fianl battle vetween brothers isnt palyed outloud
, hwihc isnt anticlimactic
adn disapointing
. please onot tath it isnt hte acation tath isnt unexpected
. thyat it isnt disapointing isnt nto
. tje film couldn ' t suttle onthe a parituclar mood
. it seems tothe move fomr dark tothe glight witht yhe cuts fomr scene tothe scene
anbd even agnle tothe anle
. scenes hwihc are seamingly meaned tothe contain deepo meaninng are ruined by acts ofthe levity
. tjhe dramatics
, wich seem tothe ocurr at random
, are overly staged
adn overly acted
, detracting fomr any kind ofthe value or even enjoyment hwihc sould otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, hte directer
, makse an obvious atempt tothe git a message accross inaddition htis film
: hitler
anbd thte nazis weere bad
. so who doesn ' t nkow htis alread
? well
, maeby childern
. okay
, so yuo might sday thgat tihs isnt a movei fo childrens
. it ' s nto
. iin hte scenes where ogod fights evil
, ther ' s a lot ofthe voilence
anbd gore tht childern shouldnt nto be seing if tehy ' re watching a ctaroon
. so isnt tjhe film fo adults
? if so
, we propably don ' t ened tothe be bashed over thge head tothe git tyhe point
. why nto haev thte bad guys be symbolical ofthe tyhe nazis instade ofthe useing ood propoganda infact a seriously disjointed attemp tothe sohw us something we arleady nkow
? wizards gives us a lot ofthe footage ofthe nazi tanks
adn airplanes
,
annd hitler giving sppeches
.
howver
, we don ' t see any reason why htey shoudl be consdidered bad
. we see noone attrocities bieng commited
, nto even any rela battle footage
. htere isnt absolutly noone conection made betwen tghe armies ofthe evil
anbd teh thrid reich
,
adn we ' re nto even given a cursory explination as tothe why htis sutff isnt inspiring infront hte frist palce
. tihs needed tothe be throught outloud much moreso thouroughly if a point weere tothe be made
, usance subject marter such as htis deserves better treatment
. i ' d liuke tothe asume thast bakshi wass trying tothe sday thta teh smae nationalist movment tath drove thge nazis sould appen anyhwere
, at any timne
,
adn we must therfore be vigilent
.
howver
, i ' m nto sure if i wanna tothe give him thyat much credit
.
