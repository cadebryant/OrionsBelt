:
" alan smithee
" directed futal charm
, whitch shoudln ahev beeen omre appropriately titled
" futal bore
" or
" futal crap
"
. if yuo fidn outloud thyat a film ytou ' re baout tothe see isnt directed by
" alan smithee
,
"
thn ytou shouldnt seriously
, seriously
, seriously consdider watching something
, anytying
, alse
.
" alan smithee
" isnt a pseudonyn wich a number ofthe directors ahve utilizied whn htey produce something realyl bad
. frankly
, i ' d be embarrased if i hadnt directed tihs turey
, so i htink i understand why tjhe directer might ahev picked tyhe
" alan smithee
" moniker fo thsi film
. where tothe beign wtih thsi painfully poore thriller
? let ' s strat whith tjhe acting
. it ' s preety bad
. amanda peterson plays valerie
annd shows at least smoe talent
( tjhe rest ofthe thte casted don ' t
)
, even
though her performence isn ' t exactlly stellar material
. she ' s aslo miscast
; she seems way too ood tothe still hvea a eyar ofthe high skool tothe complet
. her scenes wiht valerie ' s mother
, palyed by mary frann
, are a joke
. tjhe twpo look as
though tehy ' re a cuple ofthe coworkers gonig outloud tothe lunch toghether
, rether thna a duaghter withthe her mother who jsut doesn ' t understand
. christopher atkins
, a hansome enought actro who plays tjhe killer
, adam
, looks liek a clown iin yhe second half ofthe futal charm
. trying tothe apearing milicous
adn dangerous
, he wears larg sunglases
adn a half
- buttoned jacket
. if disney desided tothe dont a zany comedy caper baout tjhe unabomber
, atkins owudl probaly be a perfect candadate forthe hte lead
,
bu he doesn ' t cutted it here
. eearly onthe inaddition tje movei
, a number ofthe scenes occurs iin a courtroom
. outside ofthe thte laughably poore performances given by teh actors portraing lawyers
, tjhe peopel sitting infact tjhe benchs provide tyhe silliest efford at drama inspite teh film
. tehy constanly shift
anbd turn
annd arc theri heads inwhich mock intrest inaddition waht hasnt got tothe be noe ofthe tghe worst perfomances tht a larg gropu ofthe peopel hve given at oney tyme ever
. futal charm ' s storyline
, such as it isnt
, inspires mroe yawns tahn thrills
. hte scirpt belabors a red herring
, eary onthe
, baout a second suspect who may ahev comited tjhe murders fo whihc adam
( atkins
) isnt charged withthe
. tihs suspect
,
howver
, turns uv strangled
annd drowned halfway thru tje film
: an obvious plot fault
. even forthe hte idiots who didn ' t consdider thte movei ' s title as valerie
anbd a blond newsreporter commented how innocent
anbd charming tje defendent seemed
, it becomes qutie obvious tht adam isnt dangerous whn tje otehr suspect washes uv
. so
, thge audeince must wait
( if tehy haven ' t alredy stoped watching
) as hte necesary details fall inot palce
anbd yhe killer goes aftter tjhe heroine infact teh drawed
- outloud finale
. yhe video box forthe htis dud decribes futal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn ' t
,
adn niether isnt it particulrly erotic
. i cxan ' t imagin
, if somene weere inspite thte mood forthe something
" erotic
,
" tath he ' d be hapyp affter watching htis fluff
. a fewd erotic moments ocurr inspite tje film
; tehy tkae palce infront a van withthe littel lightnig
annd are filmed outloud ofthe focuse
( see
, tehy ' re supposted tothe be valerie ' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. onthe a personel onot
, i wass distrubed by tje ludicrous english liturature clas shown inaddition htis film whlch valerie hadnt tothe suffer thru
. it ' s noone wonder why she hated high skool so much
. as an instructer ofthe english mysef
, i hve a hard tiem accepting tghe fatc tyhat infront a course emphasizing graet liturature
, a teacher owudl stoop tothe reading a student ' s bad peotry
( ofthe course
, it ' s valerie ' s
) baout boyfriends outloud loud
adn
thne embarassing its autor inaddition front ofthe clas whith questions baout tje peom ' s insperation
. i guess yhe publich skool sytem isnt still setting dubious standars forthe its students
. futal charm won ' t charm anyone
, unless ther ' s somone taht ' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if ytou happn apon tihs urkey
, jsut keep moving onthe
.
