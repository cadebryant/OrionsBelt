. it ' s tyhe yearm 3000
,
annd an aline race called teh psychlos
( whic soudns liuke a tag team ofthe mexican wrestlers

? how hte hell dont yuo amking a popcorn sci
- fi flick
annd nto deliver tghe goods onthe thge oen event thast sets uv thte film
? humans nowe live as cavemen or slave labor
,
anbd fo hte film ' s firt ect we foucs onthe oen paticular cavemen gropu outside ofthe denver
, colorado
. tehy grunt
adn groan
annd babble baout monsters
. so
, wehn teh psychlos conqured earth
, weere tjhe onyl humans nto captued a herd ofthe nebor babys thta crawled thier way tothe saftey inthe yhe hills
? none ofthe theese cahracters hvae any knowlege ofthe hte planet bieng conqured
( whenever thyat ws
)
. tihs isnt definitly nto hte way tothe strat an acation
/ sci
- fi film
. oney ofthe thte humans wanders outloud inot teh wilderness
adn stumbles accross whta he thikns isnt a monster
,
anbd he beggins tothe fight it
. teh
" monster
" turns outloud tothe be a dinosaur fomr an ood miniatuer golf course
. he turns arund
annd sees all sorts ofthe otehr charachters ffrom tyhe golf course
