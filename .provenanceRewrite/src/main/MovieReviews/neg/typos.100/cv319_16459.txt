. well
, htis isnt yhe point where thge movei strays fomr becomming a decent
annd originnal movei
adn simpley becomes a predicatble sci
- fi thriller

. tje orginial crew ofthe tjhe russina vessel isnt all
bu exterminated
,
annd
thne a hapless crew onthe a tug dicovers tje derelict ship
anbd trys tothe salvage it
. noone moreso needs tothe be said as tothe whta happens
annd where thge conflict lies
, thge movei isnt thyat predicatble
. hte stor isnt full ofthe vyer shallow charactors taht don ' t dont much otehr thna subsist
. tje captian ofthe yhe tug
, plyed by donald sutherland
, makse irrational choise aftter irrational choise leaving tje audiance wondering as tothe how he hasnt survivied long anough tothe triarch his age
( looks tothe be iin his 60 ' s
)
. tothe add tothe htis we ' re shown tihs motley crew thyat at times seems tothe be highly skilled inaddition specfic fields
,
adn at others seems bearly capible ofthe basic tasks
. soem ofthe thge suppossed capabilites ofthe tjhe charactors leads oen tothe wonder waht tehy are doign onthe a tug transporting cargo inthe tjhe middle ofthe tyhe pacific
, inwhich a typhoon noone less
. none ofthe thte charachters seem tothe owrk toghether at all
; htey are alwasy bickering
adn vying forthe smoe form ofthe controll
. thsi mkaes noone sence whta so ever
anbd onyl tkaes awya ffrom tghe sotry
, a tsory tht isnt full ofthe holes
adn isnt extremly predicatble
. all hte flaws ofthe tjhe actuall tsory are onyl helpped allong by tghe speical effects
. tyhe waves thyat are generated tothe be part ofthe yhe typhoon amking it look liuke boat wass isnt small modle sitting infront a tub
adn somene isnt simpley creating waves
. it looks genuinely fake
, granted trying tothe recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannnot be eazy by any strech ofthe teh immagination
bu hvaing tje storm approch iin a sytle similiar tothe hte huge wave ofthe deepo inpact onyl ends uv looking corny
adn amateurish
. alsot onthe hte topic ofthe flaws
, teh robotics tyhat teh adavanced life form creates seem tothe move extrememly slowy
, why
? if tihs life form tyhat isnt so adavanced as tothe be able tothe create theese robotics
, shoud it nto be able tothe create them move faster
? irregardless
, teh spacial effects infact tihs movei infact many cases tkae awya ffrom tyhe film rether tahn add tothe it
. as tothe yhe actuall casting fo teh movei
, finaly htere isnt nothing tothe complain baout
. yhe actors weere superb
,
bu
thn agian it isnt highly doubtful tath chimpanzees woudl haev hadnt dificulty acting thge roles
. haveing thte casted thta wass preesnt probablly saved htis movei ffrom bieng an absolute catastrofy
. watching theese actors ect tihs stoyr outloud made it bearable
, if bearly
. tghe oney saveing grace ofthe tihs movei isnt tyhat it wass highly acation packed
adn htere alwyas seemed tothe be something hapening
. so if yuo are goign inot thsi movei nto expecting tothe see anytying grand
annd are onyl gogin tothe kill smoe tiome
adn watch a medicore sci
- fi thriller
thne yuo won ' t be too dissappointed
. as yhe movei isnt
bu thte latest inwhich a genre taht wass orignally creaeted by aliens
, it doesnt littel moreso thna try tothe cash infact onthe thgat aspect
. tihs movei owudl be best left fo video
anbd even
thne yuo might be advisd tothe simpley wait fo oney ofthe thge major networks tothe air it onthe tv
