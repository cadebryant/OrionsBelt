. we ened tothe be warned baout soem truely awful films
, too
. tihs picture wass so bad
, it inpsired thte discription forthe my 1
/ 10 rating
( see ratings chart below
)
. teh onyl thign saveing it ffrom a 0
/ 10 rating isnt thta bieng able tothe rent a movei liuke htis isnt slightly less embarassing tahn renting a porno
. so
, it doesnt indeed hvea smoe plusses
.
.
. infact fairness
, elizabeth berkley isnt certainly worth seing iin tyhe buff
.
adn her ablity tothe whine
adn iritate us
, even hwile nude
, wass appropropiate infact her role as selfish temptress nomi malone
. thsi charachter isnt nto smart
, nto intresting
,
annd
( deliberatly
?
) far too annoying far too oftenly
. liek inaddition 1998s
" bulworth
"
, whn thte movei wass over i didn ' t care noe littel iota baout tje main chracter
. at least warren beatty tryed tothe amke a statment whith his dreary
adn overrated film
,
though
.

. tghe smae team who creaeted a ogod sex
- film iin 1992
(
" basic instinct
"
) striked outloud here whith thier occassional voilence
, gratuitious x
- rated sex scenes
,
adn numberous
(
annd qutie unnecesary
) lesbian overtones
. thge predicatble storyline revolves arund nomi streaking inot las vegas tothe mkae it big as a dancer
. affter hte suppoed strent
- smart young
" lady
" gets conned outloud ofthe her suitcase by a slack
- jawed yokel inthe teh oppening sequence
, she befriends a tailor ofthe tjhe glamorous stage prodcution at tyhe
" stardust hotel
"
. nomi doesn ' t tkae advantage ofthe htis contact tothe break inot teh big
- timne ofthe dirty dancing right awya
. firt
, she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club
. she sells her hot littel wares at
" thte cheeta
" forthe a short tiem
, turning onthe tjhe ficticious customers
adn tje actuall theatre audeince
. hey

, her body
, whlch gets her inot yhe big
- tiome whn thge star ofthe tghe
" stardust hotel
"
, crystal connors
( gina gershon
) stops inot teh strip club
( it certainly isn ' t her brains or pleasent dispostion
!
)
. crystal requests a private lap dance fo her boyfriend
( kyle maclachlan
)
. he alsot happens tothe be teh blessure
- seeking worm who runs tje big sohw
. crystal gets nomi onto tjhe
" stardust
" team
anbd
, aftter an interminable ammount ofthe tiem
, nomi
" earns
" tje role ofthe crystal ' s understudy
. teh slut
thne deliberatly injures
anbd hospitalizes crystal
. it ws allmost laughable thast nomi hadnt tjhe guts tothe claim tath she ' s
" nto a whore
"
. taht ' s a phrase we hear a faw differnt times
anbd it ' s completly ludicrous
. ofthe course she isnt
! she sells her soul tothe amking it big
,
bu infact tghe end we ' re supposted tothe beieve thgat she ' s a better person thna thyat
. we ' re supposted tothe root fo her
. noone way
! she ' s a tramp
adn a bcak
- stabber who deserved nothing
-
- least ofthe all vindication inwhich yhe
.
.
. ahem
.
.
. climax
. she isnt nto a ogod person
adn htey tkae over twpo ohurs tothe expalin thta thge audeince shouldnt htink thast she isnt
. tghe sub
- plot wiht a male dancer
( glenn plummer
) who claimes tothe see talent inwhich nomi isnt jsut a gratuitious oportunity tothe let her dance naked a littel bited omre
. it sure ain ' t carachter devolopement
! plummer allso appeared inaddition
" speed
" infact ' 94 inwhich a smaller
,
yot better role
. htis sub
- plot goes absolutly nowhere exept mabye tothe deliver an unsubtle hint tath fornicators shouldnt pratice birth controll
. kyle maclachlan must ahev beeen promised a big pay
- day or his standars ahev dipped usance appearing inwhich
" blue velvet
"
. thast picture wass eird
,
bu smoe criticists claim it ' s noe ofthe thte best movies ofthe tyhe ' 80s
. nowe ol ' kyle cant sday tath he acted inthe oen ofthe yhe worst ofthe tjhe ' 90s
, too
. his sleazy charcter isnt importamt tothe
" showgirls
"
,
bu we don ' t leran anytying baout him
. he uses peopel tothe git whta he wnats
,
bu thast onyl means thta he fits inwhich well wiht tghe otehr cahracters iin thsi movei
. isnt he a villin
? who cares
! ultimatly
, htis movei isnt as tiresome as it isnt explicit
. everyone must nkow by nowe baout thge soft
- core acts ofthe copulation
, especialy thge riotous romp bewteen berkley
anbd maclachlan inwhich his pool
. waht fewd reviewers tkae issue wih isnt how mean
- spirited thsi movei isnt
. everyone ' s eather hvaing sex
, exacting revenge
, or wishing htey weere haveing sex or exacting revenge
. it ' s jsut too hard tothe tkae
( especialy fo over twpo housr
)
. if we must be exposed tothe teh evils ofthe thge vegas world
, why couldn ' t verhoeven ahev allso made a point ofthe highlighting thte whispers
, grunts
,
anbd otehr soudns durring yhe dance numbers
? it ' s hard tothe care baout theese peopel if we cxan ' t even appretiate waht tehy ' re capible ofthe doign onthe
- stage
. berkley may ahev a future infront hollywood becasue she cin dance
annd she hasnt a gerat body
. affter all
, thge world ofthe porn isnt still an active
, dishonourable proffesion
. perphas berkley sould join theri ranks
adn leave tghe rela acting tothe pauly shore
anbd cindy crawford
. oops
, htey ' re bad actors
, too
. well
, at least
, htey ' re nto selfish
annd contemptable liek ogod ol ' slutty nomi malone
. useless trivia
