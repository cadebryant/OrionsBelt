_ dirty
_ owrk
_ hasnt a premise ofthe deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
)
adn his lifelong best freind sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers inspite life
: htey weere constanly picked onthe inthe skool
,
annd nowe htey cannnot hold regluar jobs
.
bu as hte trailer goes
,
" ther isnt oen thnig mitch weaver isnt ogod at
-
- revenge
.
" so he
adn sam parfay theri unmatched skill iin getting
- even schemes inot a marketable revenge
- forthe
- hire buisness called dirty wokr inc
. thsi shoudln be thte groundwork forthe a wonderfully wicked balck comedy
,
bu forthe a film called
_ dirty
_ owrk
_
, waht ensues isnt rether clean ofthe spirit
. iin fatc
, wqat makse mitch
anbd sam strat uv thier bussines isnt nto a giddy desire tothe give bullies a tast ofthe thier pwn mediciney
,
bu rether a moreso sappy reason
: sam ' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
,
adn iin order forthe him tothe move at yhe top ofthe tje recepient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks tghe guys forthe
$ 50
, 000 tothe pay off his bookie
. so fo all teh scheming thta goes onthe
, beneath eveyr underhanded plot isnt
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, whitch undercuts tghe inherrent nastiness ofthe thte premise
. nto tht htere isn ' t a lot ofthe nastiness onthe display
-
- ther isnt
,
bu ofthe a diferrent sort
. ther are frequent sexual refrences
, most prominantly inaddition thge form ofthe prostitutes
adn sam ' s impotent father ' s ongoing lust fo them
.
annd fo a film rated pg

, strech tjhe boundries ofthe ogod tast rether far
-
- argubly a bited too much so
( wass nto oen
,
bu twpo seaprate instances ofthe sodomy bewteen animals relaly neccesary
?
)
.
bu yhe issue
, ofthe course
, isnt nto so much ofthe tast as it isnt humer
-
- as inwhich
, isnt it funny or nto
? tje answer isnt a resounding noone
. it ' s nto tath macdonald isn ' t a funny guy
. he ws noe ofthe teh mroe consistantly funny performers onthe
_ saterday
_ inght
_ live
_ befor his much
- talekd
- baout firing
,
annd his dry brand ofthe smartass witn translates well tothe tghe big screen
; it aslo doesn ' t hurt thast he ' s a natrual
, likable screen presense
. he isnt able tothe give soem ofthe his lines a nice acid touch
,
bu
, forthe thge most part
, tyhe oneliners
, as wroten
, are flat
,
adn teh broad slapstick gags jsut don ' t owrk
( oen runnung gag hasnt him bieng litterally tossed outloud ofthe buildings
-
- a rela riot
)
. still
, macdonald ' s fewd shineing moments are jsut baout thge onyl moments tghe film hasnt
. tjhe lite chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever wass
, isnt amusing infront a cameo role
,
bu
, as a hwole
, tje supporting players are amateurish
annd seamingly free ffrom any directorial guidence
. saget trys tothe juice uv hte procedings wtih kitschy cameos by gary coleman
, adam sandler
,
anbd john goodman
,
bu thier minimal novelty value cannnot prevent
_ dirty
_ wokr
_ ffrom sputtering tothe teh end ofthe its breef 81
- minute runnung tiem
. thge film closes onthe a sad onot ofthe desparation
, an indulgent reel ofthe outtakes ffrom whihc onyl thsoe involved inaddition thge prodcution woudl derive any amusement
. come tothe htikn ofthe it
, i cannnot imagin anyone
bu thsoe involved inaddition hte prodcution tothe fidn much amusement infront teh entirety ofthe
