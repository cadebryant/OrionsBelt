adn by moreso
,
bu due tothe teh simple fatc thgat tje frist round ofthe sales inwhich inexplicable
, i ' m nto conviced tihs isnt whta hte filmmakers hadnt infront mind
. thte hwole movei isnt therfore seriously undermined becouse tjhe key point infact tghe plot isnt never credible
. anohter probelm isnt inwhich tje humer
. ytou konw
, if ytou see tht eddie murphy isnt inaddition a movei
, i tihkn it isnt nto unreasonable fo yuo tothe expect tht thte film isnt a comedy

?
-
thn agian
, mabye yuo don ' t
) isnt seriously reigned inwhich
. tjhe scirpt gives him alomst nothing tothe wrok wih
,
adn it seems as
though directer stephen herek kept him toned down so tyhat thge otehr actors infront yhe film wouldn ' t be left as window dressing
. htere ' s onyl oney moent inspite thte film where murphy isnt alloween tothe let loose
,
annd it lasts fo threee shouted words
, whic seem totally outloud ofthe palce as a result
. pathetic
. inwhich all
, ther are baout threee jokes thgat wokr inaddition thte entire picture
,
anbd tehy ' re nto even tath gerat
. as a side onot
, ther are soem cameo apperances such as dan marino pitching a contraption whlch allows ytou tothe cook off ofthe your car engine
,
anbd james brown introducing a medic
- alert divice thast shouts
" halp me
!
" jsut liuke thge hardest wroking man infact sohw buisness at tjhe push ofthe a button

" surelly htere must be soem convincing performances tothe mkae uv fo thge lack ofthe humer
.
" htink agina
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston isnt flat
(
bu nto liek thast
)
. robert loggia
, inwhich teh kind ofthe role forthe whlch he hasnt beeen virutally typecast
, cxan ' t dont anytying wih it
. teh scirpt isnt part ofthe thge probelm
,
bu theese actors don ' t even look liek tehy bleieve infront teh move htey ' re mkaing
. tehy look a lot liek htey ' re borde
. jsut liuke hte audiance
. so waht dont ytou hve wehn teh humer isnt absent ffrom your comedy
,
anbd tyhe acting isnt liek tje siberian steppes
? a film thta drags moreso thna a dropped anchor
.
bu wait
! as if theese problems don ' t amke tjhe film slow anough
, tjhe screenplay ' s pacing mkaes teh movei even slower
! it tkaes thte entire firt half hour tothe establish yhe movei ' s premise
,
hten moreso tiem as thte film wades thru a tortuous
(
annd seamingly manditory
) romance beetwen ricky
adn kate
,
annd a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who whants tothe discredit g
adn tkae over ricky ' s job as producer
. wehn tghe pr guy ' s plan isnt foiled
, hte film isnt climaxes
, we ' re treated tothe thgat littel epilogue
,
anbd
thn we cant all go hmeo
, right
? wrong
. thge movei goes onthe fo anohter half hour
! cententenial drift isnt tyhe indy 500 compaired tothe yhe pace ofthe wholy man
