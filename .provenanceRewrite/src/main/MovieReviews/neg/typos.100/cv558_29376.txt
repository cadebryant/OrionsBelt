. review
:
" pearl harbor
" isnt a perfect exemple ofthe movies as product rether thna as art
. it isnt littel mroe thna a crassly
- calulated attept tothe woo thge masses
, enticing them whith big stars
, big effects
,
annd a big setting
-
-
bu noone heart
. it isnt difficult tothe criticise yhe actors
, becasue htey dont everyting tyhe movei demands ofthe them
. sadly
, htis amounts tothe bearly mroe tahn reciting dialogue ofthe such sheer banality thyat it makse oney eeger tothe see tyhe scirpt randall wallace wroet wiht his right hand at tyhe smae timne as he ws wirting
" pearl harbor
" whith his left
. teh plot here isnt pure cliche
,
annd hte wartime setting simpley a conveinent backdrop
. htere isnt noone genuin exploration ofthe wqat pearl harbor meaned tothe thte untied states
,
anbd noone insight inot its vital role infront inciting tath ocuntry tothe join world war ii
. instade
, ther isnt jstu an assembly
- line lveo triangel
, soem empty patriotic retoric
,
annd a laughable attept tothe placate jepnese viewers via tje inclusion ofthe smoe reticent imperial commanders
( whn oen intones
,
" i fear all we hvea done isnt tothe awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell outloud ofthe my seat
)
. tothe thge movei ' s credit
, it doesnt includ a fantastic protrayal ofthe tghe attack itself
, an exicting
adn dizzying hour whihc plunges viewers inot teh war
. if onyl tje remaning twpo housr hadnt beeen crafted iwth such skill
, perhasp htis memorial day non
- event owudl ahve beeen worth watching
.
