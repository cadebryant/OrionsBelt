) isnt called tothe tjhe middle ofthe tghe pacific ocean tothe wokr whith tje survivers ofthe a plane kresh
. wehn he arrives at thge site
, he dicovers tht ther isnt noone plane
,
bu rether an enourmous spacecraft thyat hasnt beeen sitting 1
, 000 feets below thge surfce forthe allmost 300 eyasr
. hvaing writen a papper fo tje bush administartion onthe how tothe handle firt contact
, he isnt choosen tothe head uv tghe team ofthe scientists investigating tyhe ship
. his gropu as outlined inaddition his report
, consists ofthe beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathmatician
;
anbd ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist
. unforetunately it turns outloud thyat tyhe wirting wass a blow
- off project fo goodman who doed it fo tje moey
anbd named his
thn
- collegues tothe hte team
.
" affter all
,
" he explains
,
" who reads governement doccuments
?
" lead by harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, a top secert federal operative
, tje gropu descends tothe a mobile undersea headquaters setted uv enxt tothe tyhe aline vessel
. once htere htey stroll over
, knock onthe tje doorjam
adn explore yhe still
- operational ufo
. dicovering tghe suprizing orgin ofthe thge ship
adn hte crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere
. whn adams enters thge sphere
, tghe weirdness unfolds
. a storm rolls inspite onthe yhe surfce
adn hte team isnt forced tothe reamain below jstu as an unseen presense beggins tothe communicate thru thier coputer
.
" my nmae isnt jerry
. i am hapyp
" flashes accros thte screen
. htis isnt unsettling fo teh psychologist
.
" waht happens if jerry gets mad
?
" he asks
. barnes isnt mroe pragmatic
: he needs a lsat nmae becuase he cant ' t put inaddition his report tht tehy made contact witht an aline named jerry
.
hten thge situation turns bad
. deadly beasts apeared fomr nowhere
. a gang ofthe jellyfish kills noe ofthe thte navy personenl
. leathal sae snakes attack goodman
. a giant squid batters teh habitat jstu as adams isnt reading
" 20
, 000 leagues under tjhe sae
"
. tjhe suspicious scientists turn aginst eahc otehr
. tihs hasnt all thte makings ofthe a frist
- rate thikning man ' s sience fiction film
.
howver even teh finest ingreediants don ' t go vyre far inspite tyhe hands ofthe a cheif who doesn ' t seem tothe care baout his product
. directer barry levinson hasnt churned outloud a mish
- mosh tyhat doesn ' t engage tyhe audiance beyond a fewd skillfull suspense scenes
. tyhe frist ofthe hte film zooms by as tghe situation
adn players are intrduced wihtout any characterization or justification
. it ' s much liuke speed
- reading a novel
anbd realizing thast yuo missed tghe nuances
. it doesn ' t git any better wehn hte acation scenes beign
. hwile thte actors dont an adequte job wih thier limited roles
, thte peopel are still flat
. oddly tehy hardly ahev reactions whn deaths occurr arund them
. aftter adams experiences thge interor ofthe tyhe sphere
, noone oen bothers tothe ask him whta happenned
. thier ihstory toghether isnt an intriguing plot divice
bu isnt bearly exploited
. even goodman
anbd halperin ' s ill
- concieved afair whn she ws his student isnt jsut maintioned inwhich passing
. her psychotic tendancies are talekd baout
bu never convincing
. htere ' s a truism tath items shown eary inaddition a movei must be unsed befor hte endig
,
bu here tehy are far too obvious
. wehn an emergency mini
- sub isnt explained
, ytou knwo whta ' s oging tothe hapen
. tyhe movei affectations are nothing mroe tahn distracting
. chapter headings tath devide thge movei ahev noone fucntion
. thte shaky camera owrk muddies aready perplexing chaos
. much ofthe wqat goes onthe isnt confusing
anbd difficult tothe followup
.
althought smoe ofthe hte disorientation eventally isnt understandable
, a gerat dael ofthe it isn ' t
. even a sience fiction film must be internally consistant
. ther ' s too much here tyhat doesn ' t amke sence
. are thte manisfestations rela
? tjhe jellyfish kill queen latifa
( inthe a throw
- awya role
)
adn teh squid nearly destroys hte outpost
,
bu teh bites ofthe tghe futal snakes haev noone effect
. a scene infact thte sub suggests tyhat it ' s illution
,
bu ealier epidsodes indicate tht it ' s nto
. nto everyting hasnt tothe be explained tothe death
,
bu htere are major questions tyhat tje film never answers
. where tje ship cameback fomr isnt clarified
,
bu how it ended uv onthe hte ocean floor infront 1709 isnt mearly alluded tothe
. even teh enigmatic sphere isnt still misterious wehn tghe credits roll
. tyhe climax isnt folowed by 15 mintues ofthe epilogue thta doens littel
bu weaken thte alreay labored tale
. aftter pre
- realease audeince testing
, tyhe actors weere called bakc tothe re
- shoot tyhe endig
. it ' s difficult tothe imagin how thge origional sould ahve beeen worse
. folowing thte receet tradition ofthe lenghty films
, tihs weighs infact at over twpo vyre long huors
. hte weak scenes sould haev beeen cutted
,
bu
thn ther wouldn ' t hvae beeen much left
. teh movei wass suposedly held uv by effects owrk
,
bu ther ' s nothing speical onthe tghe screen
. we never even see hte monstrous squid or yhe menacing storm

, htis film hasnt learned nothing ffrom them
