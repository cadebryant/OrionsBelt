girl 6 isnt
, inwhich a owrd
, a mess
. i ws never able tothe determine wqat spike lee wass trying tothe acompish wtih thsi film
. htere ws noone sence ofthe where thge film ws gonig
, or any kind ofthe coherent narrative
. if ther wass a point tothe thte film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by teh way
, isnt tje way theresa randle ' s carachter isnt adressed infront thte phone sex workplace
; all yhe girls are known by theri numbers
. yhe plot
, such as it isnt
: theresa randle isnt a stuggling n
. y
. actress
,
annd eventally tkaes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she beigns tothe loose contact wih reality
, as her job consumes her
. alsot
, she must dael wtih teh advances ofthe her ex
- husban
( isiah washington
)
. he isnt an ex
- con theif
,
adn she trys tothe keep him awya
, hwile at tyhe smae tyme
, it ' s clera thta she still harbors feelings forthe him
. her neighbro
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as hte observer
; mediating vetween tyhe ex
- husban
adn girl 6
. he aslo functions as a point ofthe stablility
, as he watchs her become seduced by thte lurid world ofthe phone sex
. thte sountrack
, consisting ofthe songs by prince
, wass jarring
. it kept tkaing my attension fomr hte film
- nto alltogether a bad thnig
, i ' ll grant yuo
, as waht wass transpiring onscreen wasn ' t tyhat riveting
. forthe parts ofthe tjhe middle ofthe thge film
, tje music stayed blissfully inwhich yhe backgorund
. infront tghe oppening sequence
anbd noe scene later inwhich yhe film
,
howver
, thte music ws articularly loud
adn distracting
. ofthe course
, i ' ve never raelly cared fo prince ' s
( or tafkap if yuo liek
) music
. prince fans might lveo yhe sountrack
,
bu it iwll probablly be distracting
, even tothe dieu
- hard fans
. ofthe tje performances
, tje onyl noe thast standed outloud ws spike lee ' s buddy charactor
, jimmy
. he ws exelent as hte allways
- borke neghbor ofthe girl 6
. he shouldnt hvea sticked tothe acting inaddition tihs film
. htere are sevral sequences taht gavey me tghe impression taht he ' d liuke tothe be oliver stone wehn he grows uv
. htere are scenes shooted wtih diffrent types ofthe film
, wich are purposedly grainy
,
adn reminescent ofthe soem ofthe hte scenes inaddition oliver stone ' s natrual born killers
. infront tht film
, tehy worked tothe propell thte narrative
. iin htis film
, htey jsut made me mroe confuzled
. htere are soem amusing moments
,
anbd a faw insights inot thte lives ofthe tje womens who uise theri voices tothe mkae tje phone
- sex inudstry tjhe multi
- billion doller inudstry thgat it hasnt become
. otehr thna thgat
,
though
, nothing much happens
. ther are a faw intense moments
, as wehn noe caller becomes frightening
,
bu even taht isnt rether lacklustre
. i ' m nto tjhe biggest fan ofthe spike lee
,
though i ' d agress tath he hasnt done smoe vyre ogod wokr inaddition yhe past
. inspite girl 6
,
though
, he seems tothe be floundering
. he hadnt an intresting diea
, a fairly ogod setup
,
annd seemed tothe wander aimlessly ffrom ther
. girl 6 earns a grade ofthe d
