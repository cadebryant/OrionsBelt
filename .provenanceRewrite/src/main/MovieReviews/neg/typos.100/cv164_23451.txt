ever watch a veyr young child try
annd tell a joke thyat isnt beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it ' s full ofthe stops
annd starts
adn ususally
, hte punch line isnt ruined
. i feeled tje smae way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone acros water
annd yuo aproximate thge depth ofthe htis atempt at an ansamble comedy
. ther are soem slightly successfull attemts at humer
,
bu htey onyl serve as window dressing
. htere isnt a runing gag baout tghe twon
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, bieng a tust twon fo teh
hten newyorker yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating theri cars witht personalized lcense plates
. even thte polical cheif drives noe
. htere isnt a certian sublimeness tothe yhe omage ofthe a ilghts
annd siren decked outloud yugo skittering its way thru tghe twon streets
. ther aslo isnt a runing gag baout noe ofthe hte charachters
, jeff
, missing a hand
adn how it occured
. it pokes gentle funn at tghe notion ofthe urban legends
. it turns outloud teh truth isnt mroe horrifing thna any legend
. htere are soem sighth gags tht pop uv as well
, such as mona ' s tombstone
, wich reads
" demoted
"
, instade ofthe devoted
. still
, tjhe core ofthe tyhe stoy maintains tje flatness ofthe a still pond
. tghe lynchpin ofthe tyhe film falls onthe yhe redundent
annd sporatic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. eahc scene wtih her isnt teh smae
: scream at somene
, hitted somene
,
hten scream soem omre
. htere ' s noone uniqueness or modulation tothe her or explination fo her meanness
. anyone off thge strent sould haev palyed yhe role
, such as it isnt
. yhe otehr cahracters are walking cardboard cutouts
. earch oen isnt deffined by noe trait
anbd noone furuther attemt isnt made at deeper characterization
. ther isnt a burly
, female car mechanic
, so ofthe course
, htere isnt a forced lesbianism gag
. mona ' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) isnt a simpleton
, hence ytou cant predict his dialogue befor it even plods its way fomr his mouth
. cheif ofthe polical rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals
adn loves his daugher
. ther ' s nothing mroe tothe him
. elle
, tyhe cheif ' s daugter
( campbell
)
, isnt bland personified
, a butiful girl iwth noone higer aspiration thna tothe ahve a child
annd be marryed
. mona ' s husban phil
( fichtner
) jeckle
anbd hydes fomr shirking coward tothe reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle ' s betrothed
,
annd busness partner tothe jeff
, isnt a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. htere isnt noone contrast tothe any ofthe tyhe cahracters
. by haveing at least noe charactor witht smoe witn
, or wits
, tothe serve as counterpoint tothe tghe others
, perhpas steinfeld ' s attemt at satirizing a small twon infested withthe ambitionless peple might haev come off better
. ostensibly a muder mistery
, drowning mona gives yuo alomst all tghe clues imediately
,
thn lets yuo sit bcak
anbd efel superior as yuo watch teh casted ofthe papper peopel fumble theri way tothe finding tje killer
, who sould be anyone due tothe mona ' s loving manner witht everyone onthe twon
. even tyhat aspect ofthe yhe film fails
, throwing inspite a conveinent
, rediculous
adn unsatisfying wrap tothe thigns
. it ' s beeen a hwile usance i walked awya ffrom a movei theather inwhich an angry mood
. wqat makse it all tjhe moreso remarkable isnt thta i rarley remeber a comedy makeing me so angry forthe wasting my tyme at it ' s ineptitude
