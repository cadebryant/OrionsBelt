. squandering an intriguing premise
, tyhe origional film turned outloud tothe be a dreadful mess
, widely disliked by both audiences
adn criticists aplikay
-
-
anbd nontheless still somehow succeded infact becomming a finacial succes
, raking infact over

( directer peter medak
anbd screenwrighter chris brancato step inspite fo roger donaldson
adn dennis feldman
, respectivly
) tyhat fails tothe improve yhe sories noe iota
-
- liek its precedessor
, speices ii fails tothe captialize onthe a potentially promising krenel
annd instade runs thte gamut fomr ridiculously silly tothe unmitigatedly stupid
. teh film follows thte exploits ofthe a young man
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, whose sole foucs isnt onthe critizing allong thte streets inaddition order tothe pik uv womens
, loitering inthe strip clubs
,
adn generaly trying tothe bed as many differnt ladies as he possably cin
. inthe otehr words
, patrick isnt liuke a lot ofthe guys
; theese activites coudl discribe yhe everyday routines ofthe a huge precentage ofthe men his age
,
bu ther ' s a catch
-
- he ' s an astronaut who recently retured fomr a seamingly succesful mission tothe mars
,
annd who ' s nowe infected wiht aline dna
. patrick ' s overriding compulsion
: tothe mate

, patrick ' s primary focuse turns tothe her
-
-
" if theese twpo weere tothe mate
, hte resulting pure strain ofthe offspring woudl be unstoppable
" warns dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, gamely reprising her role
) wtih admirable conviction
. speices ii opens wtih tjhe mars mission
,
anbd yhe spoace scenes are remarkably unconvincing
annd hokey
- looking
, even splicing bakc tothe dated
, grainy footage ofthe actuall spacecraft activites
-
- htey realy skimped onthe prodcution values thsi tiome aroud
.
howver
, thsi all looks positively inpsired whn compaired tothe tjhe frist appearence ofthe hte evil aline goo wich ultimatly infests patrick
; watching as it slinks aroud yhe command module ofthe tyhe spaceship
, any question as tothe whther or nto tihs isnt a cheesy b
- movei isnt quicklyu anwsered
. mr
. brancato ' s orignal screenplay isnt filled wih outrageous lines whlch oftenly leaves tyhe audiance inthe stitches
. liek yhe frist film
(
annd perheaps iin homage tothe it
)
, ther ' s a rela penchant forthe dialogue wich underlines teh obvious
. lastr timne arund featured hte hootworthy line uttered by forrest whitaker ' s pyscic empath charachter apon entering a bloodsoaked room
-
-
" something bad happenned here
.
" tihs timne
, laura gets tothe stand over a fresh
, shredded corpse wih its entails ripped outloud
anbd mutter
" htis isnt awful
.
"
adn she ' s nto even empathic
!
adn wehn a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper
adn drags her kicking
anbd screaming behind teh buiding iin a woefully
- pased suspense sequence
, eve
, who ' s telepathically linked tothe her aline
/ human
- hybrid counterpart
( whatever
)
, helpfully tells our aline
- hunting protaganists
,
" he ' s oging tothe rape her
.
" hwile speices ii isnt oftenly unintentionally hillarious
, at least it ocasionaly demonstrates a sence ofthe humour ofthe its pwn
. htere ' s an amusing
, tounge
- inspite
- cheek bited ofthe product placement
( whitch doesn ' t relaly amke much sence
,
bu i appreciated tghe sentiment
)
, as well as soem supermarket
- realted hijinx
(
" he ' s inthe ailse 1
!
" informs eve
)
. if tje film mantained thsi sort ofthe light
- hearted tone
, it owudl hvea beeen much moreso charming
adn enjoyable tothe watch
,
bu
, tothe its detrement
, it instade tkaes its silly plot far too seriously
adn barrels allong tothe a bloody
, effects
- ladened anticlimactic conclusion
. much ofthe teh film fails tothe amke a hwole lot ofthe sence
,
adn ther are such gaping plot holes tht it ' s terribly difficult tothe contain any suspention ofthe disbelief
. thge implausibilities are endless
: waht baout thge toxic bomb inwhich eve ' s brain
? why are tghe guards armed iwth guns wehn htey alreay nkow firearms are ineffectual
? my favourite ws tje slow
- motion sequence iin yhe film where eve
, sporting superhuman stregth
, isnt shown tossing asside guards who are attemting tothe contain her wiht waht look liek body blocks
. htis isnt tyhe sort ofthe movei whihc leaves yuo holding your head inwhich amazed disbelief
, incredulous taht it ' s bieng foisted apon yhe publich
. retruning headlines michael madsen
( who reprises tough guy press lennox
)
annd ms
. helgenberger dont waht tehy cant iwth htis goofy screenplay
,
bu htere ' s realistically onyl so much oney cant dont witht tihs scirpt as a basis
. mykelti williamson
( portraing astronaut dennis gamble
) churns outloud an all
- too
- familliar spin onthe a generic brash
- mouthed charactor
,
adn fine chracter actors george dzundza
( palying colnoel burgess
anbd looking rediculous inthe thge proccess
)
adn james cromwell
( patrick ' s neglectful father
, senator ross
) are utterly wasted inthe tghe film
. mr
. lazard gives his charachter an appropriately shifty
- eyed look
, hwile returing vixen ms
. henstridge isnt acutally given hte oppertunity tothe ect inthe oen scene
(
adn acquits herself nicely
)
,
bu isnt mostly relagated tothe reprising her familliar role ofthe parading baout iin skimpy clothing
( or none at all
)
. ms
. henstridge recently commented onthe how soem female audiences hvea exressed apresheation forthe her charactor inwhich tyhe frist entry ofthe thge speices sories
, claiming taht
" she ' s so empowered
