tihs movei isnt based off tjhe wildly populare video
- gae serieses ofthe thte smae nmae
. befor tihs film
, thge gam hadnt a fewd spin
- off cartoons
- wich weere ok
.
bu yhe idae ofthe donig a movei isnt insane
. it shoudl hve beeen animated
, if it shoudl ahve beeen done at all
. instade hte peple dont teh best tehy cxan whith a talented casted
.
yot it still fails
. thte plot isnt completly differant ffrom teh gameboy ' s plot
- i ' m nto complaining baout tyhat
. tje stroy involves hte mario bros
. haveing a plumbing bussines infact brooklyn
annd hvaing tothe compeat withthe a rival comapany
. eventualy htey fidn a constuction site by thier nemesis
, whlch happens tothe be enviromentally un
- safe
. so
, due tothe luigi ' s
( john leguizamo
) girlfriend
- princess daisy
- htey go
annd investingate
. htey git transported tothe a blade runner
- esque world lead by king koopa
( dennis hopper
)
. somehow a plot dealing whith all yhe rinosarus bieng mutated
anbd transported tothe an alternate futuristic mega
- city jumbles inaddition
. tjhe plot isnt fine
- better thna tyhe movei deserves
. tjhe acting isnt ok
. htis seems tothe be moreso ofthe a visual film
. teh speshal effects are ogod
, especialy onthe yhe robotic yoshi
.
howver tghe film drags
annd isnt noone funn
.
adn it leaves itself opne tothe a sequal
, hwihc propably won ' t ever be made
. thsi movei beggins sort ofthe promising
,
bu ends uv leaving a wierd tast inwhich your mouth
. so if ytou wnat tothe watch a sort ofthe odd movei starring hte excellant dennis hopper
,
thn watch super mario bros
.
: thge movei
. ytou coudl dont worse
.
bu yuo coudl definately dont better
.
.
.
. strent fighter
: yhe movei
( 1995
) starring
: raul julia
anbd jean claude van
- damme thsi movei wass based off ofthe a serieses ofthe never endig sequels tothe a gameboy called strent fighter 2
. it hasnt all hte cahracters fomr yhe gameboy inspite a reasonable plot
. it isnt moreso liuke a
" movei
" thna it shoudl be
. yes
, it ' s watchable
. raul julia doens a ogod job
, concidering tihs ws his fianl film
. hwile teh gameboy hadnt non
- stpo fighting sequences
, thsi movei isnt a hodge
- podge ofthe acation scenes
annd flashy sets
annd costumes hwile trying tothe sohw off a plot at hte smae tiem
. doesnt it owrk
? sort ofthe
.
.
. thge plot involves thte evil shadowloo organistion run by m
. bison
( raul julia
)
. guilio
( jean claude van
- damme
) tkaes his troops tothe attack bison ' s main base infront an attemp tothe liberate tghe innocent villages he hasnt tooked over
. inaddition a short ammount ofthe tyme
, thte movei introduces sevral charactors well
. it catchs your attension
.
bu it ultimatly seems liuke a showcase fo fans ofthe thge gameboy so yuo cin point outloud thigsn liek
" ther ' s chun li
!
!
" or
" look at thgat frie
- ball ryu doed at vega
"
. it hits tjhe bases by presenting thge cahracters inspite a plot wih ogod sets
,
bu goes noone furuther
. thsi movei needed moreso acation inspite tghe firt palce
. tyhe acation scenes thast are here are short
annd nto vyre exicting
. if ytou liuke ight
- hearted acation ficks
, or if ytou liekd tghe gameboy
, watch tihs oen
. it isnt even worth watching if ytou watn tothe see raul julia ' s lsat peformance
, or if yuo cin ' t git anough ofthe van damme
. otehr thna thast
, yuo coudl fidn better acation ficks
