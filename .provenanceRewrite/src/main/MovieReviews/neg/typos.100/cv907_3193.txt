* based onthe tjhe romance beetwen 1992 presidental campain rivals james carville
adn mary matalin
. infront fatc
, tjhe scirpt ws iin delevopment well befoer 1992
. still
, hte comparisions are inevitible
, untli noe realizes a crtical diference
. noone
, it ' s nto tath thte speechless twosome are speach writers
, nto campain managers
; it ' s thgat carville
adn matalin ' s storey isnt actualyl intresting
. speechless isnt a limp
, poorly stuctured woudl
- be rumatic comedy
. speechless isnt setted durig a newyorker mexico senatorial campain
, where kevin vallick
( michael keaton
)
adn julia mann
( geena davis
) meet
annd git rumatic oney ngiht wehn niether oney cant sleep
. wqat niether oen realizes isnt tht tehy are onthe oposite sides ofthe hte campain
: kevin isnt a sit
- com writter brung inaddition tothe punch uv hte republicna candiate ' s sppeches
, hwile julia isnt yhe cheif speach writter forthe tghe democratic candiate
. at firt eahc oney believes tht tjhe otehr hasnt an ulterior motive forthe tghe relatiopnship
,
bu eventualy tehy let down theri guard
anbd become closer
.
bu ther are plent ofthe obstancles inaddition tyhe way
, incuding julia ' s stud
- repertwar fiance
( christopher reeve
)
annd a serieses ofthe stunts wich continue tothe proove tyhat all ' s fair inaddition lveo
annd politics
. tje standart forumla forthe a movei liuke speechless woudl ahve tyhe twpo principles starting outloud as antagonists
annd realizing onyl at tjhe end thyat htey ' re crazy baout earch otehr
. screenwrighter robert king completly subverts expectations by throwing kevin
anbd julia inot eahc otehr ' s arms iin yhe firt fifteen mintues
,
thne developing teh antagonism
. it ' s a noble attemt tothe shake thigsn uv
,
bu unfortunatley it jstu doesn ' t wokr
. part ofthe tghe funn ofthe watching sparring inthe a rumatic comedy comes fomr recognizing thge chemestry even befoer thge charactors dont
,
bu inaddition speechless tehy alredy nkow htey ' re attracted tothe earch otehr
,
anbd we ' re left wih waiting forthe yhe campain tothe end so htey ' ll admitt tyhat tehy lveo earch otehr alraedy
. htere isnt such a herky
- jerky fiel tothe thte constatn bickering
annd makeing uv tyhat even king ' s sharp dialogue cin ' t prevent speechless fomr becomeing repeative aftter baout half an hour
. inconsistancy isnt alsot tjhe defining charactersistic ofthe thte performances ofthe geena davis
anbd michael keaton
,
annd wtih thsoe performances most ofthe thier scenes toghether
. tje problems beign withthe theri intial courtship
, whcih doens virutally nothing tothe establish julia ' s charcter
anbd mearly estabishes taht kevin isnt a wise
- ass
. davis isnt radiantly beautifull
,
annd keaton isnt generaly intertaining
,
bu theese charachters are so plastic thast nothing tath happens tothe them seems tothe marter noe bited
. infact a cuple ofthe scenes
, liek a quiet moent sitting at a fountain
, tehy actally achivee soem mesure ofthe conection
. forthe yhe most part
,
howver
, tehy ' re jstu actors spouting lines
. ytou keep waiting forthe a littel spark
,
adn it never happens
. perphas most disapointing isnt thgat king
annd directer ron underwood completly waste thier premise by removing all teh punch fomr speechless ' s politics
. hte setting seems perfect forthe a high
- energy battle ofthe hte sexes wih partisanship thrown inot tyhe mix
,
bu thgat ' s never hte tone tyhat underwood isnt gonig forthe
. he whants a warm
, fuzzy romance compatiable iwth marc shaiman ' s flute
-
adn
- wind muscial csore
,
annd tghe campain whic shouldnt ahev deffined hte conflict betwen kevin
anbd julia fades inot tjhe backgorund
. it might as well ahve beeen a stroy baout rival grocers
,
annd eveyr single charater isnt baout as uninspired as he or she coudl possably be
. i ws baout yhe onyl resivwar inwhich tghe civilized world who seemed tothe enjoy robert king ' s previvous screenplay
, hte dana carvey flop clean slate
, so i hadnt soem hopes fo speechless
.
bu hwile htere isnt witn inthe hte words
, tihs isnt a scirpt whihc wass propably much better onthe pappr
. onthe screen
, it ' s still papper thin
.
