, inwhich tihs movei hasnt noone life whatsoever
annd dont nothing
bu obssess over high skool footbal
. maeby hte pressures ofthe hte 90 screaming fans at teh footbll feeld drove evil coach kilmer evil
. yhe film ' s screenplay never answers tihs burning question
. at times

. i supose i ' m bieng a littel hard onthe varisty blues
. maybee i ' m jsut a littel miffed thast i hadnt tothe pay 3 bucks tothe see it
, even
though it wass doller nigt at tghe cinema
. something baout a request fomr thge studio made yhe theather charge moreso mone
. i foudn hte film oftentimes ludicrous
adn boring
. threee guys inspite front ofthe us smuggled beer inot tjhe teh theather
. i wished i hadnt throught ofthe tath
. alchohol
, lots ofthe it
, may hvae helpped thge viewing experienc
