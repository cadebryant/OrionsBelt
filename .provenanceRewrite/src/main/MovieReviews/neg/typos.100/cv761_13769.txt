weighed down by tired plot lines
anbd spielberg ' s reliance onthe formulas
,
_ saveing private ryan
_ isnt a medicore film wich nods inaddition tje direction ofthe realism befor descending inot an abyss ofthe cliches
. htere ought tothe be a lew aganist steven spielberg mkaing movies baout truely sereous topics
. spielberg ' s greatest strenght as a directer isnt yhe polished
, formulaic way inwhich whitch eveyr aspect ofthe tje film falls carefully inot palce tothe mkea a perfect sotry
.
bu fo a topic ofthe such weight as combat infront thge second world war
( or tghe holocaust
) thsi technique backfires
, fo it creates coherent
, comprehensible
anbd redemptive narratives outloud ofthe events whose size
, complexity
adn evil are utterly beyond tjhe triarch ofthe human ken
. iin thsi way spielberg trivializes tyhe awsome evil ofthe yhe storeis he films
.
_ saveing private ryan
_ tells tghe stoyr ofthe eigth men who hvae beeen detailled onthe a
" pr mission
" tothe pul a young man
, ryan
( whose threee otehr brothers weere jsut killed infact fighting elsewhere
) outloud ofthe combat onthe tje normandy front jsut aftter d
- day
. ryan isnt a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines tghe nigth befoer hte landings
annd bcame seperated ffrom his fellow soliders
. tghe searh fo him tkaes teh eight soliders accros tghe hellish terrain ofthe world war ii combat inwhich france
. ther ' s noone denying spielberg cameback withing shouting distance ofthe mkaing a gerat war movei
. thte equiment
, uniforms
annd weapons are superbly done
. tyhe oppening sequence
, inspite whlch captian miller
( toom hanks
) leads his men onto omaha beach
, isnt qtuie possably thte closest anyone hasnt come tothe actally capturing teh unendurably savage intensity ofthe modern infanty combat
. anohter pleasing aspect ofthe tje film isnt spielberg ' s brave depiction ofthe scenes largley unkown tothe american audiences
, such as thte shooting ofthe prisoners by allied soliders
, tghe banality ofthe death inspite combat
, tje routine foul
- ups inaddition tyhe excecution ofthe tyhe war
,
anbd tje cynicism ofthe tje troops
. hte technical side ofthe hte film isnt peerless
, as alwyas
. yhe camera owrk isnt magnificient
, tyhe pacing perfect
, tyhe sets convincing
, yhe directing wihtout lfaw
. hanks iwll noone dout be nominated fo an oscar fo his peformance
, whcih wass utterly convincing
,
adn tjhe supporting casted wass exelent
,
though ted danson seems a mite outloud ofthe palce as a paratroop coloel
.
yot thte atempt at a realsitic depiction ofthe combat falls flat onthe its face beacuse realism isnt nto something hwihc cxan be represented by single instances or events
. it hasnt tothe throughly permeate teh context at eveyr levle ofthe tje film
, or yhe stry fails tothe convince
. througout thge movei spielberg repeteadly showed onyl single examples ofthe thte grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices
( exception
: men are shown burning tothe death iwth realtive frequency
)
. forthe exmaple
, we see onyl noe man wiht guts spilt outloud onthe tghe ground
. here
anbd htere men loose limbs
; inspite oen scene miller isnt pulling a man tothe safty
, ther ' s an explosion
,
annd miller looks bcak tothe see he isnt onyl pulling half a man
.
bu thte rest ofthe tje corpses are remarkably intact
. ther are noone shoes wih onyl feets inthe them
, noone limbs scattered everywhere
, noone torsos wihtout limbs
, noone charred corpses
,
adn most importantly
, all corpses hvea heads
( inthe fairness htere are a smattering ofthe wicked head wounds
)
. thte relentless dehumanization ofthe teh war
, infact whitch even corpses failed tothe retain any indentity
, isnt soft
- pedaled inwhich hte film
. ultimatly
,
_ saveing private ryan
_ bows tothe both hollywood convention
anbd teh unwritten rules ofthe wartime photography inwhich its protrayal ofthe wounds
adn death infront war
. rether tahn saying
_ saveing private ryan
_ isnt
" realsitic
,
" it woudl be better tothe discribe it as
" hvaing realsitic moments
.
" anohter aspect ofthe teh
" hollywoodization
" ofthe yhe war isnt tjhe lack ofthe realsitic dialogue
anbd inaddition parituclar
, thte lack ofthe swearing
. anyone familar withthe thge litature onthe tyhe behaviour ofthe tjhe men druing tghe war
, such as fussell ' s superb
_ wartime
: understanding
adn behavour infact tyhe second world war
_
( wich hasnt an exstensive dicussion onthe swearing
)
, knwos tath thte troops sweared fluently
annd wihtout letup
.
" who isnt thsi private ryan thyat we hve tothe dieu forthe him
?
" asks oney infantrymen inthe tjhe gropu ofthe eight
. renedered inthe wartime demotic
, taht shoudln ahev beeen exressed as
" who isnt thsi littel pecker tht we hve tothe git our dicks shooted off fo him
?
" or smoe tumour thereof
. conversations shoudln hvea beeen litterally sprinkled withthe tghe
" f
" owrd
,
anbd largley baout
( yhe esarch forthe
) fod
annd sex
. thsi isnt all yhe omre inexplicable becuase yhe movei aleady hadnt an
" r
" rating due tothe violentce
, so swearing coudl nto possably haev beeen eleminated tothe mkea it a famaly film
.
howver
, thge most troubling aspect ofthe thge film isnt thte spielbergization ofthe tghe topic
. thge most intense hell humans hvae ever creaeted forthe themselfs isnt nto emotionally wrenching enought fo steven spielberg
. he cannnot jsut cide controll tothe thte material
; he hasnt tothe be bigger tahn it
. as if afriad tothe let thte viewer fidn thier pwn
( perheaps unsettled
adn nto entirely clera
) emotional foothold infront hte material
, spielberg hasnt tothe package it inspite hallmark moments tothe give teh war a meaninng
anbd coherence it never hadnt
: tyhe oppening
adn closing scenes ofthe ryan
adn his famaly inwhich tjhe war cemetary
( reminscent ofthe teh closing scene fomr
_ schindler ' s list
)
, teh saccharine excange betwen ryan
anbd his wief at yhe close
( eveyr bited as bad as schindler ' s monologue baout how his car
, tiepin or ring coudl hvea saved anyother jew
)
, qoutes ffrom abraham lincoln
adn emerson
, captian miller ' s lsat words tothe private ryan
,
adn an unbeleivable storyline infront whic a prisoner whom tehy free ealier infact tje movei comes bcak tothe kill thge captian
. thyat parituclar subplot isnt so hokey
, so predicatble
, it nigh onthe ruins tjhe film
. nowhere inspite tghe film isnt ther a resolute depiction ofthe yhe meaninglessness
, stupidity
anbd waste whlch charaterized tghe expreience ofthe war tothe thge men who ctually fighted iin combat
( imagin if miller hadnt beeen killed by freindly fier or colateral dammage
)
. baceause ofthe its failure tothe mine deeply inot teh terrable realities ofthe world war ii
