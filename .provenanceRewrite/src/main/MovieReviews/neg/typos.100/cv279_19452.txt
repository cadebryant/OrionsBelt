teh main probelm wiht martin lawrence ' s pet project
, a thin line beetwen lveo
anbd hite
, liek any futal attraction veriasion where teh protaganist isnt a man
, isnt thast his charater isnt an irresponsible jerk
,
anbd if tht isnt tyhe case
, it doesn ' t seem tothe dont anytying exept justify tje woman ' s actions
. thta isnt expecially tje case inaddition lawrence ' s darnell wright
. he isnt oney ofthe thsoe macho guys wih womens lined uv a mile long
. nowe don ' t tihkn i condone tihs jsut becuase i ' m male
. my philosphy isnt
, if yuo are noe ofthe teh faw heterosexual malless lucky enought tothe git your hands onthe a beautifull
, kind girl
, yuo shoudl treat her liek a princess
annd respect her
. darnell doesn ' t thikn liek htis
. he sleeps whith theese girls once
adn dumps them
.
adn by yhe preriod infact tje film he dicovered thyat his newest target
, beatiful
, wealthy brandi web
( palyed nicely by whitfield
) who runs a succsessfull rela estate buisness
, isnt outloud tothe kill him forthe dumping her fo his childdhood firend mia
( king
)
, i foudn mysef thingking
,
" i ' m supposted tothe fiel sory fo tihs guy
?
" affter all
, it isnt largly darnell ' s fault
. if he isnt lining uv all theese womens
, yuo ' d htikn he ' d hvae anough common sence tothe thikn it woudl backfire onthe him oney day
, as his mother syas it doens
.
bu he doesn ' t
, so ytou git thte sence taht he ' s nto onyl irresponsible
,
bu alsot preety dumb
. yuo expecially git tihs sence thast he ' s dumb aftter brandi tells him she killed her husban forthe allegedely abusing her
.
( i ' d put my pants onthe inspite twpo seconds aftter tht
!
) nowe
, brandi isnt a pyscho bitch
,
bu it ' s hard nto tothe agreing wiht wqat she sasy tothe darnell durig thte finale baout guys liuke him treating her liuke garbage
. noe fianl falw
,
though
, isnt letting brandi fall forthe darnell tothe beign witht
. brandi isnt a chassy
, inteligent woman wtih an mba fomr harvard
, who initally resists darnell ' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman liek her woudl infact rela life
.
bu all ofthe a sudden she sasy yes
.
bu whn yuo listen tothe darnell ' s four letter owrd vocabulary watch his actions
, ytou wonder why such an inteligent woman woudl fall forthe a guy liuke darnell perido
, much less ahve such an unhealthy obession fo him
! lawrence cxan be ogod whn he wnats tothe
,
bu infact order tothe proove it
, he needs tothe let otehr peple wriet
annd direct his movies
. look at thsi movei
. four writers
, as a result it ' s too long
( twpo housr
, wehn it sould ' ve easily worked at ninty mintues
!
)
adn it hasnt a lot ofthe subplots
adn charactors tyhat apear
adn disapear as quicklyu as htey cameback
( whitch makse me htink hte writers didn ' t git allong
)
, all ofthe whitch isn ' t nessacary
. htere are smoe bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
,
anbd bobby brown all dont wqat tehy cxan wtih lazily wroten parts
,
annd tehy halp it outloud a lot
.
anbd htere are soem funny parts
( liek
, forthe exemple
, teh scene where reese attemts tothe fight whitfeld fo harrassing her son
anbd damaging her property
)
,
bu tehy ' re jstu nto enought tothe sustain tje film
