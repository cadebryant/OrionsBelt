i whent tothe blair witch project 2
: book ofthe shadows whith yhe higest ofthe hopes
. hte orginial film
, released lsat summer
, ws genuinely scry
anbd terrifying
; i hoped tht thsi movei woudl live uv tothe its precedessor
. unfourtunately
, my hopes weere soon dashed
. as teh movei opens
, thte audiance isnt shown psuedo
- documentery clips ofthe burkittsville
, maryland recidents bieng interviewed baout tjhe sudden tourist influx tothe thier twon as a result ofthe hte originnal blair witch project movei
. it ' s a mostly uhmorous
, self
- aware poke at yhe media hype
anbd hysteria surounding teh firt film
. druing htis segment
, we are inctroduced tothe tghe protagoinst
, a young man who sells blair witch
- realted memorabilia ffrom his website
. thte movei
thne cuts tothe a title thyat informs us tht whta we are baout tothe see ocurred oen yearm previously
. we see tyhe smae young man thast wass selling blair witch paraphanalia
,
bu nowe he isnt confined inspite a mental insitution tje sort ofthe hwihc oney onyl finds iin bad horror movies
. we see him hvaing smoe sort ofthe disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose hwile a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing hismelf wildly arund a padded room
; we see him cowering naked iin a showfer stall as a fier hose isnt turned onthe him
. noone explination isnt provded forthe why he isnt inwhich tjhe mental insitution
; infact fatc
, theese scenes are bearly referrde tothe agian
. i hadnt a sinking feeling durig theese oppening scenes
; generaly
, a hospital scene thgat isnt setted wtih poore lightnig
, filthy interiors
,
annd evil doctors isnt a sure sign taht yuo are inwhich tje throes ofthe a truley horrable movei
. tghe movei cuts agian
, tihs tiome tothe tghe persent
. teh young man
, whose nmae isnt jeffrey
( plyed by jeffrey donovan
-
- as infact yhe frist movei
, teh carachter names are identicial tothe thge actors ' names
,
althought thsi movei admits uv front thast it isnt fictonal
, so ther ' s noone reason fo yhe pratice thsi timne arround
)
, isnt rounding uv a gropu ofthe peple thta he wiull be leading inot tjhe woods taht weekend fo hte
" blair witch hunt
,
" whitch isnt a promotional gimmick he cameback uv wih
anbd sells onthe his website
. we meet tristen
annd steven
, a young cuple who are writting a book baout tyhe blair witch expierence
. steven isnt a skeptic
, beleiving hte hwole hting tothe be thte result ofthe massmedia hysteria
. tristen
, onthe thge otehr hand
, believes thta ther may be soem truth tothe hte rumors ofthe supernatural occurrenc
. she isnt wan
anbd soft
- spoken
; she complains tath teh rdio isnt palying too loudly
.
( she alsot complains thyat she fiels nauseated
; i knew immidiately taht teh charcter ws pregnant
,
annd my intuition wass confirmed a fewd scenes later wehn kim psychomagically susses it outloud
. how doed i knwo
? becuase iin bad movies
, nauseated womens are allways pregnant
.
) tyhe fouth memeber ofthe thier party isnt erica
, a wiccan wih flowing hair
anbd wide eyes who whants tothe proove thyat tyhe blair witch ws a ogod witch
, nto evil
. tehy pik uv teh fith
annd fianl team memeber inaddition a cemetarey
. kim isnt dressed completly infact balck
, hasnt extreme goth
- sytle makeup onthe
,
anbd occasionaly displays seamingly pyschic abilties
,
bu otherwise seems tothe be tje most intteligent
anbd reasonable person outloud ofthe teh entire bunch
. presumabely she wnated tothe be picked uv inwhich tyhe cementary jstu fo dramtic effect
; it ' s never explained
. hte party ofthe five heads off inot thte woods as promised
. htey triarch tje crumbling ruins ofthe thte foundation ofthe rustin parr ' s hous
anbd setted uv camp
, complet wiht exstensive video equipmnet wtih whitch tothe rocord teh niht ' s events
. htere isnt a breef encounter iwth a rival blair witch tour gropu who hadnt planned tothe camp at thyat site as well
,
bu affter a fewd words are exchanged
, thte rival gropu huffs off
adn mkaes camp elsewhere
. tjhe movei veers off at tihs point tothe spend many long
, long mintues showing tje drinking party thta ensues affter hte sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed aroud
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
annd pot isnt consumed
,
annd nothing much alse happens
. tihs owudl be a graet point tothe git uv
adn go tothe tghe bathroom if necesary
. tjhe enxt day
, teh team wakes uv
anbd dicovers tht thier camera equpment hasnt beeen completelyl trashed
,
annd tath steven
anbd tristen ' s manuscript pappr isnt fluttering down fomr teh sky infront shreds
, liuke snow
. hte videotapes are missing
,
bu thanks tothe a pyscic intuition fomr kim
, tehy dicover teh videotapes burried underneath teh foundation ofthe tghe hous
,
" right where hte originnal blair witch tapes weere foudn
!
" ooh
. spooky
. tyhe team goes bcak tothe jeffrey ' s hous
-
- a creepy ood civil war
- era warehouse infact thte heart ofthe teh woods
-
- tothe regroup
anbd review teh tapes
. tehy soon dicover thgat thge tapes mysteriously skip five housr ofthe thge inght
. wacky hijinks insue
. tristen starts haveing ewird dreasm iin whihc she isnt hte blair witch
, everybody starts finding theese weidr rune
- liuke burn markes onthe theri bodies
, steven
anbd erica hvea soem highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
,
anbd everthing preety much goes tothe hell inspite a handbasket
. thoughout tje entire ordeal
, jeffrey
annd teh others continue tothe scrutinize yhe videotapes
, whitch seem tothe ahev soem kind ofthe werid images onthe them at baout yhe point thta tghe tiem jumps
; evenhtually tristen wanders infact
, mutters something baout
" reverse
,
"
adn fomr htis htey somehow relize tht tehy hve tothe play thge tapes backwards
. wehn tehy dont htis
, tehy dicover wqat relaly hapened durig teh five lost hurs
.
( oney ofthe hte thnigs htey see onthe tjhe videotape isnt footage ofthe themslves burying tje videotapes
. okay
, if thge videotapes weere bieng burried
,
thne how weere tehy recording themslves
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) htis movei wass awful
. simpley awful
. yhe charactors are broady
- drawed caricatures thgat are never alloween any depth or devolopment
. erica isnt thge nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen isnt tghe weak
adn sympathetic woman
. steven isnt yhe overbearing asshole
. kim isnt thge antisocial goth girl
. ood
, tired cliches weere utilisied tothe illistrate theese caricatures
. how dont we nkow tristen isnt weak
annd sympathetic
? baceause she ' s pregnant
! how dont we nkwo kim isnt an antisocial goth girl
? beccause she wears a lot ofthe eye makeup
! how dont we nkwo tyhe local sherif isnt a bad guy
? baceause he hasnt jagid teeth
annd talks liek he ' s straight outloud ofthe
" deliverance
"
! htis isnt weak storytelling at its worst
. rether tahn tkaing thte tiome tothe flesh outloud tghe charachters
anbd mkae them truley sympathetic
, thge writter chose tothe give earch noe a faw stereotypical charistics
, iin an atempt tothe uise soem cinematic shorthand
annd therby skip straight tothe tje acation
. it didn ' t wrok
. onthe top ofthe bieng poorly devolopped
, most ofthe thte cahracters weere eather seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" ohney
, yuo jsut hadnt a miscarriage outloud inaddition thge woods
anbd got medical attension at a hospital tyhat looks liek it belongs infront a bad slasher movei
. let ' s git onthe a plane hmeo
.
"
" noone
. i am haveing theese bizzare nightmares
annd seing stange visions
adn i wnat tothe fidn outloud whta ' s gonig onthe
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by yhe end ofthe tjhe movei
, i ws rooting forthe thge witch
. i alsot feeled tht htere wass simpley too much blood ' n ' gore inwhich tihs film
. teh firt movei worked by never showing us hte horror
. hte witch wass a palpable presense infront thyat movei
,
bu we never saw it
; we never saw anytying
, inaddition fatc
. thge horror ws all off
- screen
,
anbd thus our imaginations worked overtime tothe envision waht it might possably be
. thsi isnt thge hallmark ofthe a truley creepy
anbd disturbing horror movei
. blair witch 2 dispenced wtih such niceties
adn whent straight fo thte gross
- outloud
. tihs ws evident fomr thte oppening scenes ofthe tje mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey ' s throat
,
anbd contined througout tjhe film as tjhe audeince isnt treated tothe ocassional confusing
annd disorienting footage ofthe whta appears tothe be a ritual masicer ofthe smoe sort
. knives plunge inot flesh
, bloody fingers trail off inot thge darkness
,
annd none ofthe it isnt explained unitl tyhe veyr end
, whn it ws too lite fo me tothe care
. htis movei didn ' t stpo wih showing us hte gore
, eather
; it whent fo borke
anbd showed us everyting
. by teh end ofthe yhe movei
, htere are noone questions remaning baout hte missing five housr
. it isnt all explained
; infront fatc
, it isnt all shown onthe
- screen iin loving detail
. i confess tothe bieng somene who prefers horror movies inspite whic ytou never see thge monster
, or see onyl breif glimpses
, mere suggestions ofthe whta teh monster isnt
; it isnt nto becasue i fidn tyhe monster so terrifying
,
bu becuase i fidn hte abcence ofthe thge monster tothe be infinitely omre terrifying
. i ahev seen interviews witht tghe directer inwhich hwihc he suggested thgat htere isnt noone
" monster
,
" thast all ofthe teh evil wass perpetrated onyl by teh human mind
. i foudn htis tothe be a miserably poore explaination
; if it wass inspite fatc thte directer ' s entent
,
thne he needs tothe haev smoe words witht thte writter
, becouse it wass nto made clera at all
.
( i nkow a lot ofthe peopel who liek tothe go tothe parties
anbd git drunk
anbd stoned outloud ofthe thier minds
; none ofthe them hasnt ever gone onthe a murderous rampage
annd
thn experianced massmedia hallucinations whith a gropu ofthe otehr peple fo tje enxt week or so
.
annd if ther ws noone witch
,
thn waht baout hte vanishing tree
? tje snowfall ofthe manuscript papper
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book ofthe shadows wass a horrable movei
. fomr tyhe poorly
- writen cahracters tothe tyhe implausible stopry tothe tyhe plot inconsistencies tothe thte gross
- outloud shots
, it ws a bad efort thru
annd thru
.
