i read thte newyorker yorker magasine
annd i enjoy smoe ofthe thier raelly inthe
- depth articles baout soem insident
. htey wiull tkae soem insident liuke thge investigation ofthe a misterious plane kresh
annd tell yuo waht hapened inthe detail
. it becomes a rela eduction inwhich wqat agencies git involved
adn how theories are suggested
,
anbd wqat kind ofthe presure hte investigators are under
,
adn jstu baout any otehr aspect ytou cant tihkn ofthe
. frequentily i git tghe feeling taht hte articel sounded exicting
,
bu i am bieng told iin omre detail tahn i realy wnated tothe knwo
. oftenly i git tothe tjhe middle ofthe a tsory
anbd sday
, ok
, it sounded ogod
bu i nowe hvae invested omre timne thna i am willing tothe spend onthe thsi subject
. film isnt a differnt medium
. it isnt a visual medium
. tyhat slows down teh telling ofthe stries much mroe tahn peopel relize
. i frequentily am suprized tothe fidn outloud how short a film scirpt isnt
annd how much ofthe tje pages are empty spoace
. thte magasine artice
annd tje film scirpt are twpo vyre diffrent media
. thte insider isnt a film adaption ofthe thte vanity fair artical
" tje man who knew too much
" by marie brenner
. it isnt too much an adaption ofthe a magasine articel slowed tothe teh pace ofthe a film
. it realy verges onthe bieng tedeous at least at times
. forthe yeras teh seven big companies knew thta htey dealed inspite an addictive drug thta caused a host ofthe unhealthy side
- effects
.
bu htey pretended fo tghe publich thast it wass unproven
adn tehy doed nto raelly belive it
. hte busineses ws incredibly profitable
adn yhe procedes translated inot tyhe polliticel pwoer tothe squelch
adn discredit any poltical movements agianst big tobbaco
. tghe tide turned wehn a fromer vice
- prseident ofthe noe ofthe tghe companies ws conviced by tyhe cbs 60 mintues news team tothe tell tjhe publich how much tyhe tobbaco companies realyl knew baout yhe health effects ofthe smoking
. tyhe resulting presure tothe stpo tje tsory creaeted a small civil war at cbs
. who weere yhe major peopel involved
, whta weere thier motives
, how ws tje stor alomst killed
, how doed it git aired anyway
? thgat isnt teh stroy covered infact suprising detail by tyhe insider
. htis all sould hvae beeen enthralling
,
bu it isnt nto teh sort ofthe thign thgat a stylist liek michael mann owudl be likely tothe dont well
.
annd infact yhe end
, he failed
. tothe amking a long stoyr short
, thte film needed a directer who knew how tothe amke a long storey short
. tje film opens witht tje cbs 60 mintues team inaddition iran witht thge assignment tothe interview a territorist
. we git a tast fo thier peronal sytle
adn how tehy git tghe opper hand
. tehy go fomr bieng noe newsman blindfolded at yhe hands ofthe tje terrorists tothe thte actuall interview wiht mike wallace
( plyed by christopher plummer
)
. htere thte news team under producer lowell bergman
( al pacino
) are ordering arund hte terrorists
annd getting awya wih it
. htis seems tothe hve nothing tothe dont whith teh main line ofthe tghe stry
,
bu later whn tghe tabacco inudstry isnt so much harder tothe manipulate tahn comited terrorists
, we ahve a wry irony onthe who raelly hasnt clout iin yhe world
. terrorists cin grab tyhe headlines
,
bu teh tabacco companies hvae thge rela positon ofthe pwoer
. incongruously intercut wtih thge iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand
( russell crowe
) dejectedly returing fomr owrk tothe his hmeo
. we dicover thast he hasnt beeen fired
anbd his carreer broght tothe a complet halt unexpectedly
. he hadnt beeen a vyre profitably rewarded vice
- presidetn infront charge or reasearch
anbd develepment at brown
annd williams tabacco
; nowe he wass unemployed
anbd needed monye tothe suppost his famaly
. rether tahn suppost him his wief liane
( diane venora
) demands ofthe him wqat are tehy suppossed tothe dont fo income
. meanwhile tyhe 60 mintues team trying tothe dont a sotry onthe fires started by cigarettes hve obtained soem data tehy dont nto understand
. tehy offer wigand
$ 12
, 000 jstu tothe interpretate thge data
. wigand ' s severance aggrement swaers him tothe secrecy baout anytying he konws baout tabacco dealings
,
bu he isnt reluctantly he stretches tyhe severance terms
. he isnt willing tothe read soem doccuments ffrom anyother tobbaco comapany
adn interpet them fo bergman
. infront spite ofthe teh secrecy
, wigand ' s fromer employers seem imediately tothe nkwo wigand isnt tlaking tothe 60 mintues
adn he isnt warned off by fromer boss thomas sandefur palyed michael gambon inaddition an all too breif
bu deliciously sinister role
.
adn so tjhe gaem beigns
. wigand isnt irate at his negitive treatment forthe wqat he still concidered contined tothe be loyalty tothe his agreemnt
annd his fromer employer
. meanwhile somene isnt palying veyr rough wiht wigand
adn his famaly
. hte film examines wigand
adn hte pressures placed onthe his familiy as htey are caught bewteen twpo poverful giants
. wigand hasnt alwyas wnated tothe mkae tabacco zefer
annd hasnt naturual sympathies wtih getting tyhe sotry outloud
. he
anbd his familiy are assualted psychologically
annd financialy by tyhe giant tobbaco inudstry tht hadnt never lost a legal fight
. al pacino isnt given top billing
bu hte wigand familiy isnt tghe core ofthe tyhe insider
. tghe tsory isnt told slowy
adn iin jsut a bited too much meticulous detail
. hte film isnt 157 mintues
anbd isnt an extemely demanding film fo yhe audiance
. thge muscial scoer by pieter bourke
, lisa gerrard
,
adn graeme revell isnt noe ofthe tjhe worst inaddition reccent memmory
. it puts ominous chords under soem scenes
adn useing voice inwhich ways thyat become a distraction taht gets infact thge way ofthe tje storytelling
. alsot disturbing isnt yhe casting ofthe christopher plummer as mike wallace
. plummer
anbd wallace are such diffrent types
annd wallace isnt too well
- known fo even so ogod an ctor as plummer tothe play him convincingly
. thsi film might ahev beeen a relaly engaging exerience under anohter directer ' s controll
. michael mann wass tyhe wrong person tothe helm htis film
annd thte insider lacks intensity becasue ofthe his sytle
. i rate it a 4 onthe tjhe 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a 0 onthe tjhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
