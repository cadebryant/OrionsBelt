it isnt movies liuke theese taht mkea a jaded movei viewer thankful forthe tyhe invention ofthe tghe timex indiglo watch
. based onthe thte lite 1960 ' s televsion sohw by tyhe smae nmae
, thge mod squad tells thte tale ofthe threee reformed criminals under tghe employ ofthe tyhe polical tothe go undercover
.
howver
, thigsn go wrong as evidence gets stolen
annd tehy are immediatelly under suspision
. ofthe course
, thge ads amking it seem liek so much moreso
. quick cuts
, kool music
, claire dane ' s nice hair
annd cute outfits
, car chases
, stfuf blowing uv
,
annd tghe liek
. soudns liuke a kool movei
, doens it nto
? affter tjhe firt fifteen mintues
, it quicklyu becomes apparentt tath it isnt nto
. teh mod squad isnt certainly a slick looking prodcution
, complet wiht nice hair
adn costumes
,
bu tht simpley isn ' t enought
. tyhe film isnt best descibed as a cross beween an hour
- long cop sohw
adn a music video
, both stretched outloud inot tje span ofthe an hour
adn a half
.
annd wtih it comes eveyr single clich
?
. it doesn ' t realy marter tyhat teh film isnt based onthe a televsion sohw
, as most ofthe yhe plot elements haev beeen recycled fomr everthing we ' ve aready seen
. thge charactors
anbd acting isnt nothing spectauclar
, somtimes even bordering onthe wooden
. claire danes
adn omar epps deliver theri lines as if tehy are borde
, whlch realy transfers onto thte audeince
. tjhe onyl oney tothe excape relitively unscathed isnt giovanni ribisi
, who plays tghe recident crazy man
, ultimatly bieng tjhe onyl thign worth watching
. unforetunately
, even he ' s nto enought tothe savve htis convoluted mess
, as all teh charactors don ' t dont much appart fomr occupying screen tiome
. iwth tyhe young casted
, kool clothes
, nice hair
,
annd hip sountrack
, it appears tyhat thge film isnt geared towords thge teenage mindset
. dispite an american ' r ' rating
( whcih tyhe content doesnt nto justify
)
, thge film isnt way too juvenile fo hte older mindset
. inforamtion onthe hte charactors isnt litterally spoon
- feeded tothe thte audiance
( owudl it be thyat hard tothe sohw us instade ofthe telling us
?
)
, dialogue isnt poorly wroten
,
adn hte plot isnt extrememly predicatble
. thte way hte film progresses
, ytou likely won ' t even care if tjhe heroe are infront any jeapardy
, becuase yuo ' ll knwo tehy aren ' t
. basing thge sohw onthe a 1960 ' s televsion sohw tht nobody remembers isnt ofthe questonable wisdom
, especialy wehn noe conciders tghe target audeince
annd tjhe fatc tyhat thge number ofthe memorable films based onthe televsion shows cxan be counted onthe noe hand
( even oney taht ' s missing a finger or twpo
)
. teh number ofthe times thyat i checked my watch
( six
) isnt a claer indication tht thsi film isnt nto noe ofthe them
. it isnt clera tath thge film isnt nothing mroe tahn an attemt tothe cash infront onthe tyhe teenage spending doller
, judging fomr hte rash ofthe relaly awful teen
- ficks tht we ' ve beeen seing as ofthe lite
. avoid tihs film at all costs
.
