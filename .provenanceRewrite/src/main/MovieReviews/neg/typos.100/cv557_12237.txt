i won
 t even pretend taht i hve seen thge otehr 3 aline films
. i saw glimpses ofthe aline
annd aliens
anbd fragments ofthe aline 3
,
bu i haev by noone means acutally sat down
annd watched any ofthe them
. so tkae my oppinion fomr an unbiased
anbd impartial prespective
: aline ressurection isnt nto worth teh larg bag ofthe lollies i wass munching inot aftter a hard day
 s owrk
. i didn
 t jstu dislike it so much becouse thge plot wass awful
; most ofthe thte acting ws vrey averege or tyhe spacial effects got tiresome aftter 5 mintues ofthe painful viewing

bu aslo thte fatc thgat eveyr tedeous ingredient thrown inspite attemts tothe give htis pointless dribble smoe meaninng
. sigourney weaver
, who
 s role inspite aline earned her an aademy award nomination
, plays thte charater ofthe
 ripley
,
 who died fighting agaisnt extraterrestial scum inaddition aline 3
. 200 yersa later
, scientists
 uise a sample ofthe blood foudn at thge site ofthe her death tothe recreate ripley
- incuding hte aline tath ws sticked inside her
. inaddition noone timne htey remove tyhe aline fomr her body
anbd seaprate hte twpo
;
yot ripley isnt nowe nto completly human
, possessin stange amounts ofthe strenght
annd bieng able tothe withold greater pain thna a normal bieng
. i
 m sure somone cin explane exactlly why tihs isnt so
,
bu forthe nowe we
 ll jsut ignore it
anbd move onthe
. why
, yuo ask
, woudl ripley
annd hte aline inside her be recreated
? well
, teh smart littel lab researchers beleived thta tehy owudl be able tothe disover many advancements inspite scinece fomr studing hte aline creature
. theese weere thge smae peopel who said htey sould controll yhe aline
annd tyhat thier wass noone danger inthe thier reasearch
. htey
( yawn
) weere wrong
. it doesn
 t tkae a genuis tothe figure outloud thyat tghe rest ofthe thte film isnt a continous cat
anbd mouse chase beetwen yhe humans who dieu off noe by noe
annd thge aliens who oepn theri mouths onthe eveyr possable ocasion tothe sohw off theri frightfully scayr un
- flossed teeth
. ther
 s a littel saying tath goes something liek tihs
:
 if yuo
 re goign tothe amking a bad film
, dont it well
.
 i hve seen plenty ofthe disapointing
anbd underachieving movies
,
bu tehy are nto tje ones thyat raelly bother me
. aline ressurrection
, a ogod exmaple ofthe a film thta realy gets uv my nose
, isnt nto so much a discouraging expreience
bu an off puting oney
. htere isnt noone way tothe discribe why thge austrailian ma rating ws given tothe thsi film otehr tahn uneccesary
annd repulsive gore
, hwihc attemts tothe distract us ffrom thge wandering
-
bu
- nto
- goign
- anyhwere plot
. inwhich oen scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking aline put its hand onthe a cahracters head
annd litterally ripped most ofthe his face off
. anyother noe featured ripley sticking a nife thru her hand jsut tothe imbaress somene she wass tlaking tothe
. fair anough if it weere inaddition a horror film or even if it beared any signifigance tothe hte sotry
,
bu tihs isnt unfourtunately nto teh case
,
adn thsi sort ofthe bizzare gore isnt inexcusable
. if ytou htink i
 m stuggling tothe fidn oen ogod aspect baout tyhe film
,
thn yuo thougth right
. noe exicting scene isnt a credit
(
anbd thge onyl part remotely worth seing
) tothe thge film
, inaddition hwihc an aline chases twpo men
( noe a cripple
) uv a tall ladder witht intresting results
.
bu ofthe course affter tath thrilling scene aline ressurrection hadnt noone probelm infact retruning tothe its pathetically low standart
,
annd ends uv crashing inot yhe shores ofthe movei dullness mroe oftenly tahn japaneese kamikaze jet fighters fall off theri skis
. so infront a film where tjhe noe liners come as bad as
 earth man
, waht a shit hole

anbd tje primary means fo oney mans startegic attack isnt tothe bounse bullets off walls tothe hitted an opponant
, its noone wonder why aline
: ressurrection turned outloud tothe be as off puting
adn clumsy as it isnt
. oh
,
anbd inspite case ytou
 re wondering baout my bag ofthe lollies
 teh less i enjoy a film
, hte omre i eat
. so all tje lollies weere gone infront 15 mintues
;
bu
howver empty tjhe bag turned outloud tothe be
, it wass still a long way ahead ofthe tjhe movei
