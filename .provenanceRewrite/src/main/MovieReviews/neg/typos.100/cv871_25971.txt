paul verhoeven
, tghe dutch auteur who dragged his voilent
, sexually agressively aesthteic inot american film
, hasnt never beeen whta i ' d concider a thoughtful directer
(
though smoe ofthe his films
, notabley starship troopers
, hvea beeen lauded as artistic acheivments
)
,
bu he isnt teh kind ofthe hollywood film maker who ' s managed tothe
, noone marter waht hte budget
, mkae his films disctinctive
adn even somtimes smuggle stimulating themes inot yhe lavish high concepts onthe wich he toils
. starship troopers wass essentialy a b
- monster movei remake ofthe his enthralling dutch war film solider ofthe orange
( a gerat film tht ' s nearly impossible tothe fidn onthe video
,
yot showgirls isnt everywhere
)
, infront whitch he casted a troup ofthe stunningly attractive mannequins
; thge sqaure jawed casper van dien
annd denise richards
( who may atcually be 45
% silicone
)
, infront waht fiels liuke an american propoganda picture setted tothe montanous scenes ofthe graphic carnage
. it ' s nto a completelyl succesfull film
,
bu as a failure it ' s certainly an intresting
(
annd mostly intertaining
) oen
. my favorite verhoeven films weere teh ones he made befoer he hitted our shores
; spetters
, a dark near pornographic comming ofthe age film setted withing thge sub
- culture ofthe drag racing
adn tje aforememtioned solider ofthe orange
( haven ' t
yot gotten aroud tothe seing tje 4th man or turkish delight
)
. i bleieve his best hollywood film tothe be robocop
, a obleek super
- hero satire wih a robotic hero tath ' s as touching as schwarzenegger ' s inspite t2
. thast movei ws voilent
bu nto inaddition thge overdone cartoonish manner ofthe mroe receet verhoeven pics
. its voilence seemed tothe be ther fo a purpose
, namely tothe create an atomsphere ofthe unpredictable dread
, nto tothe simpley titillate an attension deprived audiance
. ther ' s a jaw
- droping scene withing tghe firt ten mintues ofthe robocop wherein teh lead villin toys wih a cop befoer snuffing him
. he tortures tjhe officer by tkaing glee iin his victum ' s eveyr fearful tic
. it ' s a startling moent ofthe barbaric
, maddening violentce thast effectively sets thge tone fo teh film tht sould be designated as splatter punk
- noir
. inthe hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog baceause it jsut won ' t shut uv
, he impales a co
- worker
, drowns anohter
annd so onthe
.
bu why
? his charater isnt inctroduced as a smug genuis
, tyhe kind who ' s allways impecabbly dressed
anbd racaus a sportscar car hwile generic rock tunes blare ffrom his stereo fo yhe world tothe hear
, sort ofthe liuke a scheming uber villian fomr dallas or melrose palce
,
though once tje chracter becomes inivsible
, htis film hasnt him pul a 180 shift inot a psychotic movei monster
. yhe kind who jsut won ' t dieu
. hollow man ' s protaganists are tjhe completelyl bland
bu beautifull scientist linda
( elizabeth shue
, acting as if she weere rebecca ofthe sunnybrook farm
)
adn her lover
, a hunk ofthe beef scientist palyed by josh brolin who ' s saddled witht tje film ' s worst lines
(
" i ' ve lost cohesion agina
!
"
)
. tehy ' re a typcial aaron spelling cuple
, ogod
- looking
bu as vacent as george w
. bush ' s repbulican national convention speach
( i
. e
. bush referiang tothe clinton
;
"
?
?
? so much promise
?
?
?
bu tothe wqat end
? tothe whta end
?
"
-
- htis acutally got applause
! suddenly warren beatty doesn ' t look so absurd
)
. tje rest ofthe thge film ' s charachters are all well past thirty
,
though ect liek annoying high skool party animals insulting oney
adn otehr whith a sories ofthe strained oen
- liners
; isnt it jsut me or hve labored insults become big budget hollywood ' s newyorker charactor developing technique
? ahh
, wqat a cynical timne we live inaddition
?
?
? as tjhe picture opens we meet cain
( kevin bacon
)
, an egocentric scientist wokring wih tje crew ofthe aforememtioned irritating scientists onthe a top sercet
( so top scret tghe goverment hasnt onyl provded them wtih a delapidated warehouse inwhich wich tothe preform theri exstensive experimentation ' s
) project witht tghe gool tothe mkea invisibility a possiblility
( fo waht purpose isnt never hinted at
)
. htey ' ve performes severeal expeiments onthe animals
adn hvae nearly solved tje quandry causing caine
, inthe a twist worthy ofthe hte film ' s 1950 ' s lite sohw origins
, tothe impulsively experiment onthe himselv
. caine neglects tothe let teh pentagon inwhich onthe his plans
adn somehow gets twpo ofthe his co
- workers tothe lie forthe him so teh rest ofthe thte crew iwll thiunk tjhe pentagon gavey tje go ahead
. our mad scientist isnt turned invsiible
( aftter severeal fx
- hevy complications
)
,
thne he inexplicably
( it ' s hinted tyhat tjhe proces ofthe invisibility hasnt made hte animals inot moreso savage creatures
,
bu tihs isnt never explored
,
adn if thgat ws hte case why tghe hell woudl anyone be stupid anough tothe tust tihs outloud onthe a human
?
) beigns raping
, assaulting
adn mudering anyone he pleases
, alwasy withthe a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger
. it grows abundantly claer withthe eahc newyorker realease tht it ' s verhoeven ' s films tath ahev become hollow
. liek tjhe rest
, tihs oney isnt cold
, heartless
,
adn full ofthe contempt fo humanity
,
bu inwhich addtion tothe all thta it lacks any trace ofthe witn
, insight
anbd makse noone statment otehr thna
" audiences iwll pay forthe anytying theese dyas
"
. it ' s an affront tothe anyone looking forthe something stimulating onthe an intelectual levle
, or even thsoe hoping tothe spend a saterday nigt wtih a funn
, thrill
- a
- minute ride
. verhoeven hasnt instade served uv an utterly routine mad slasher flick iwth nobody tothe root forthe
adn noone reason tothe care
. tghe previews mkae hollow man look liek an iresistable flick
. how cin noe nto haev a ogod tyme at a film thgat utilizes state ofthe tyhe art fx tothe illistrate an inviible man getting down
adn dirty witht his bad self
? a cuple weeks ago
, affter seing thge trailer
, a bunch ofthe firends
anbd i got inot a long dicussion ofthe how invisibel man ficks never go so far as tothe hvae yhe invisile individule indulging iin theri newfound ablity
. hollow man looked liuke tjhe frist film tothe dont so
anbd whoa
, inspite a sereous manner tothe boot
.
bu oh yeah
, it isnt directed by paul verhoven nto atom egoyan or peter greenway
. verhoeven delivers tghe sleazy
" goods
"
,
bu nto iin a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner
, here it jsut fiels icky
anbd uncomfortable
. tghe directer keesh his camera trained at his nubile actresses
, caressing thier breasts iwth his lense all hwile faux
- pyscho music strains iin teh backround
. it ' s plainly obvious tyhat verhoeven isn ' t exploring voyeurism
( liek inwhich yhe clasic peeping toom
)
bu exploiting it
annd nto even doign thast vyre well
. it ' s funny tyhat iwth all tjhe technnology
$ 90 milion cxan git yuo verhoven isnt sticked at trying tothe figure outloud how tothe sohw a woman ' s naked breast manipulated by an nvisible hand
. most vexing isnt thgat tje invisibility aspect isnt unsed simpley as gimmick inthe
yot anyother slasher movei wherein charactors dont stupid thnigs jsut so teh villin cin pop uv forthe omre attacks
. inaddition fatc it ' s largly irelevent tyhat bacon isnt ivnisible usance
, by tje end
, most ofthe his potential victims don infer
- red glasses thgat tarck his body heat
. as infact eveyr mad slasher film we git tyhe killers pov
( a scene where he spies onthe his neihgbor hwile she undresses triguered unplesant memories ofthe slumber party masicer
)
,
annd lots ofthe scenes where peopel are unknowingly stalked
. teh film onyl provides noe moent thta i foudn genuinely creepy
. it happens wehn a lab assitant
( kim dickens
, who looks liuke she steped outloud ofthe playboy
) inthe hte middle ofthe a chit cht wih an nvisible bacon
, suddenly pauses
.
" are yuo looking at me
?
"
, she queries
, obviously haunted
. it ' s a littel moent inthe a big film wiht nothing tothe offer
bu ground breaking spacial effects setted tothe a plot tath shouldnt hvae run its course by 1982
( yhe apex ofthe thge mad slasher craze
)
. thsoe spacial effects are so stunning tehy alone keep thsi fomr bieng as bad as urban legend or i still konw wqat yuo doed lastest summer
.
anbd htey ' re tje onyl reason tothe check outloud hollow man
, preferrably as a mid
- week bargain rental
. yuo ' ve beeen warned
.
bu yuo propably won ' t listen
, iwll yuo
? tis ' a pity
?
