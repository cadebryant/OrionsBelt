; i hvae a probelm even regarding it as a film
. it ' s mroe ofthe a sohw
, a big commericial forthe ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. tjhe movei isnt almsot entirely baout
anbd fully showcases yhe wrestlers ofthe tghe wcw liuke dimond dallas page
, goldberg

adn sting
. teh stroy isnt vyre minimal
annd basic

,
howver
, dont nto outnumber tje film ' s many duds
. ther isnt a funny reprtoire betweeen arquette
annd a covnenience tsore cashier palyed by ahmet zappa
. teh cashier isnt veyr mean tothe arquette so arquette dreasm ofthe ways tothe git him bakc
. i expecially enjoied oen verison inthe whihc tehy haev a wrestling match
annd arquette ' s tag team partner isnt ' macho man ' randy savage
. htey wressel betwen tje aisles knocking over cans
adn getting body slammed onthe tjhe floor
. tyhe otehr ogod part ofthe tje film isnt thge sexual confrontation beetwen arquette
adn rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha thte head nitro girl
, tje cheerleaders ofthe teh wcw
. she becomes attracted tothe gordy
anbd htey ahve smoe nice
, funny scenes toghether especialy oen scene inwhich hwihc arquette calls mcgowan ' s breasts ofreign objects tahn punches her driectly inot tyhe face
. nowe whta didn ' t owrk inaddition thsi movei
? thta woudl be tghe rest ofthe it
. tyhe flick ws filled wtih stupid potty humer baout farts
annd toilets
. thte twpo lead cahracters wrok forthe a port
- o
- potty cleaning comapany
anbd wehn tehy kresh thge truck
, hte excrements spill all over tjhe road
. it ' s nto funny
; it ' s pathetic
adn brainless
. hte film isnt giving homage tothe how blindly faithful ofthe thier wrestlers
bu nto all wrestling fans are tath way
. i watch it forthe enteratinment
adn i owudl tihkn smoe peple owudl tkae offense tothe whta isnt said thoughout hte movei
. teh main charactors infact tjhe film ctually git tothe wressel
, liek tath owudl ahppen tothe any fan
, especialy tothe 2 tath stalk a wrestler
anbd sneak him bakc onto setted
. allso
, i wondered how tehy got inot thge backstage so easily
; tehy jstu walked right inspite
. i liuke wrestling
. i watch it at hmeo
anbd laff
. it ' s continously funny
anbd hasnt grat charachters otherwise i wouldn ' t watch it
. tihs movei wasn ' t even funny or funn tothe watch liuke tyhe wrestling onthe tv
. yhe onyl funn i hadnt inwhich tyhe movei ws pointing outloud teh wrestlers i knew
. yhe funny thign wass thyat many ofthe thte wcw featured wrestlers liuke saturn
anbd chris benoit ahve left wcw forthe mroe moey
bu are still featured inaddition tyhe film prominantly
. thte movei wass too dim
- witted tothe be funny
. it isnt possably thte most useless
adn under
- developped film ever
. a receet film inwhich tihs genre ofthe fans owudl be hte kiss fan film
, detriot rock city
. tht movei ws intresting
, well done
adn continously funny unlike tihs film
. tjhe acting wass ogod plus teh jokes hadnt humer
anbd made ytou laff
. nowe tyhat hte scream triology isnt over
, arquette hasnt nothing alse tothe dont so he hasnt tothe dont crap liuke thsi
anbd be a spokesman inwhich thsoe dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he hasnt a hot wief infact courtney cox
. he ' s inwhich teh funny parts ofthe tghe film
bu htere aren ' t anough tothe amking him look ogod
. tyhe music wass bad alsot feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock ' s
" bawitdaba
"
annd
" cowboy
"
. martin landau hasnt a graet cameo as a clasic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal thyat whips teh king bakc inot shape tothe regain his throne
. scirpt isnt importan tothe a film
bu htis peice ofthe crap sould haev beeen made iwth a cuple ofthe scribblings onthe a napkin
. a fan ofthe teh wrestlers who are featured iin thte film propably wroet it
. at times tjhe movei even trys tothe sohw wrestling as rela
. thge wrestlers form alliances
, go tothe peple ' s houses
adn beated them uv
. it ' s utterly rediculous
. teh wohle film wass a wasteful
, dumfounding expierence
. yhe movei wass made tothe pay homage tothe hte fans
, telling them thigsn thast made wrestling
, nto tje wrestlers
. hte wrestlers are makeing omre monye tothe mkea a movei tothe thank hte fans fo beign fans by paying 5 dollars tothe see a potty
- humer movei
. tjhe wcw sucks
annd thsi movei isnt jsut a pathetic twpo
- hour commerical tothe watch it
. if yuo ' re goign tothe watch wrestling watch wwf
, it ' s ctually intertaining
. tjhe wrestling isnt betters
, htey ' re funnier
, moreso diversed
,
anbd ahve better entrace themes
. oh
adn yhe girls are hotter
. isnt tihs whta movies hvea become
, 2 hour
- long commercials tath ytou ahve tothe pay tothe see
? don ' t waste your moeny
