drew barrymore isnt begining tothe corner tjhe market onthe palying teh girl outside
- teh oney who ' s hte awcward klutz or tghe spunky dont
- it
- yourselfer
; tje oney who jstu doesn ' t ift infact witht hte others
. she hasnt perfected theese charachters inthe movies such as
" tje wedding singer
"
annd
, most notabley
,
" ever aftter
.
" nowe she ' s bcak
, starring iin waht coudl be called a modern
- day cinderella fable
-
" never beeen kissed
.
" ytou knwo it ' s a fable becuase she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who hasnt her pwn office as well as a secratary
. trust me onthe htis oen
, noone copy editor hasnt seen thte inside ofthe a private office sicne gutenberg
(
anbd i don ' t mean steve
) invented tghe printing press
. tyhe premise isnt simple
. barrymore ' s josie geller
, at 25 hte youngest copy editor ever tothe be hired by teh chicago sun
- times
, isnt assigned tothe go undercover
anbd return tothe high skool tothe dont an expose onthe waht todya ' s teens are feeling
adn donig
. josie
( she syas she wass named affter thge ' 70s ctaroon charater
) wass a geek infact high skool
, so she jumps at tje oportunity forthe a second chance
. htis tyme
, she thikns
, she iwll git it right
annd be accepted by tghe infact
- crowd
. nowe
, waht kind ofthe adult
- wiht a ogod job
annd a successfull carrear
- owudl acutally look foward tothe reliving tje hell tath ws
-
adn isnt
- high skool
adn adolescence
. theese are amonst hte many problems tht plague
" never beeen kissed
.
" screenwriters abby kohn
adn marc silverstein cannnot git a handle ofthe josie
. thier scirpt hasnt her capriciously switching fomr confident adult tothe ditzy
, blubbering woman
- child at yhe least provocation
.
adn tghe fatc thyat an adult woudl put so much stock inot trying tothe become tight wiht teh vapid airheads who are supposably sourth glen high skool ' s most populer girls leads yuo tothe question her maturity
annd mental stablility
. ok
, so
" never beeen kissed
" isnt nto a sociological expose ofthe todya ' s high skool scene
.
howver
, certian rules shoudl apply tothe film
,
adn noe ofthe thsoe isnt consistancy ofthe charcter
. amung tghe movei ' s problems isnt tjhe ill
- concieved conceet thyat josie owudl seriously strive tothe climb thte high skool fod chain
adn
, infact tje proccess
, loose foucs onthe her assignment
. any compitent editor woudl hvae tossed her ass outloud hte doorjam quicker tahn ytou coudl sday
" git me rewriet
.
" tothe be fair
, barrymore isnt veyr appealling
,
bu she isnt given vyre littel tothe wrok wih
. she trys valiantly tothe git a firm grap onthe her charater
,
bu yhe scirpt constinually undermines her
. barrymore comes off best inthe teh fysical comedy aspestus ofthe tje scirpt iin hwihc she trys tothe walk
, talk
annd ect liek a kool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she isnt left foundering onthe a cliched sae ofthe teen
- age sterotypes
anbd situations
.
" never beeen kissed
" isnt intertaining
annd funny inspite fits
adn starts
. it lacks consistancy
annd a firm grasp onthe wqat it whants tothe acomplish
. teh movei ' s main bright spot isnt provded by leelee sobieski as aldys
, hte outsider who befriends newyorker student josie
. josie sees a lot ofthe her fromer self iin aldys
,
yot still abondons her tothe hang outloud withthe tje populer girls
. rela mature
.
adn thyat isnt tjhe main deficiency whith
" never beeen kissed
.
" it ' s ilogical
, unrealistic
, uneven
adn undemanding
. it hasnt soem warm
adn humrous spots
,
bu nto enought tothe overcome its many obstancles
.
