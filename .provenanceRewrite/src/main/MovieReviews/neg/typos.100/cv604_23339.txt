an affluent horse breeder ' s past comes uv tothe haunt him
; an aegs ood cover
- uv
adn blackmail comes bakc tothe haunt him at tghe hands ofthe oen ofthe his accomplices
. thast ' s preety much teh esence ofthe tyhe movei
anbd i ahve tothe sday thgat it becomes qutie boring at times
adn isnt vyer slow
. tht asside teh sotry ws well presented
anbd probablly qutie close
adn representive ofthe its source
. thte acting iin particualr i foudn veyr ogod
, tje charater devolopment wass aslo qutie intresting
bu alas tyhe stoyr simpley doed nto hold my interst anough forthe me tothe git inot hte movei
. a fewd thigsn baout yhe stopry didn ' t sit vrey well wtih me forthe exemple tje originnal scam
annd cover
- uv heavily involved thte carachter palyed by sharon stone
,
yot iin hte end her chracter plyed a relitively small role
adn it seems she shoud ahve beeen utilized mroe tothe futher yhe stoy allong better
. onthe tje flip side tghe charater plyed by catherine keener i foudn tothe be veyr intresting
annd i thougth thta it wass devolopped vrey well
adn helpped thge stoy a lot
. hte charachter ' s asside tihs movei hadnt soem intresting merits
bu inaddition hte end it lacked infact sotry
annd pacing
. as far as teh acting
adn casting forthe thsi movei isnt conserned i hvae tothe sday thast thge choices ofthe nick nolte
adn jeff bridges weere gerat as well as thta ofthe catherine keener
. all theese peopel acted theri parts admirably
, as forthe hte part tht sharon stone palyed
, she plyed it well
bu tghe part ws nto utilized anough
. teh directing forthe htis movei isnt something taht i haev tothe comment onthe becasue fo once inwhich a long hwile yuo see a directer actualyl add a vrey disctinctive flavor tothe a movei
, htis isnt oney ofthe thsoe occassions
. matthew warchus inspite my oppinion added an intresting touch
anbd spin tothe yhe movei
adn i htink he tackled a touch subject
( i mysef wouldn ' t be able tothe look at horseracing
anbd mkea a movei outloud ofthe it
)
. htere isnt a certian flavor baout tihs movei
annd i htikn tyhat tjhe direction ofthe tghe movei isnt thte reason fo thsi
. thge noe falw thgat i dont haev tothe comment onthe isnt tjhe pacing
, tjhe subject marter iin my opinyon wasn ' t intresting enought onthe its pwn tothe ahev tihs kind ofthe flavoring
annd directorial touch baout it
. i certainly hope tyhat tghe directer mkaes mroe movies as tihs doesnt sohw promise even if i mysef don ' t liek it
. all inthe all i foudn tihs movei boring
adn vyer slow
, tyhe acting ws ogod
bu hte stoy jstu didn ' t evolve anough
anbd wasn ' t captivating anough tothe amke simpatico an enjoyable movei tothe watch
.
altough ther isnt much oging forthe tyhe movei i didn ' t fidn it ogod even
though i see thte merits
annd stlye utilisied
anbd cxan compliment hte movei onthe them
. i wouldn ' t recomend tihs movei tothe anyone
bu if ytou are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic
thn yuo wiull most likely enjoy thsi movei
.
