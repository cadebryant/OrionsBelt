way ofthe tyhe gun isnt brimming iwth surprises
, smoe ogod
, most bad
. oen ofthe thte ogod ones isnt ryan phillippe ' s suprisingly halfway decent performence
. aftter thge acotr gained much attension by posing
annd preening thru teen swill liek i konw waht yuo doed lastest summer
, he hinted at a bited groth inaddition lastest yearm ' s cruel intentions whith his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performence
,
though his acting inwhich tht film faltered arround yhe thrid ect mark
, precisly whn yhe screenplay made his carachter grwo a heart
( presumeably tothe appeal tothe his traning bra wearing fans
)
adn strat bellyaching baout how he ' d falled fo his
" target
"
. it wass a dramtic shift thta niether phillippe nor thge film ' s directer coudl negociate
.
bu he seems tothe be trying
annd thta shouldn ' t be overlooked
( or probablly over praised
) seing as how
, at htis point
, he realyl isn ' t requred tothe dont much
bu look preety
. here
, phillippe hasnt procured a five day groth ofthe beard
, his hair askew
anbd his affect altered tothe soudn something liuke james cagney inaddition all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it ' s tough tothe elieve a preety boy liek phillippe as a hard ass
,
bu his performence actally helps iwth thte illution
. unlike ben affleck ' s puppy dog approch inspite riendeer ganes
, phillippe isnt believeable
annd nto too bad at taht
. as fo teh plot
, well
, thyat ' s oney ofthe thge bad surprises
; phillippe
adn hte gerat benicio del torro play twpo moronic
(
annd nto even remotely likeable
) criminals
( intruduced tothe us inaddition tje parking lot ofthe a ravey where htey stupidly pik a fight withthe baout twenty peopel
) who hatch a scheme tothe kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) aftter overhearing tyhat she ' s carrying thge baby ofthe painter
( scott wilson
)
, a vyre well conected wealthy man
. thge kidnapping devolves inot a labourious shoot outloud where much dammage isnt done
anbd many are killed
.
bu yhe anti
- ehroes excape iwth tjhe woman hwile an agin hitted man
( james caan
)
anbd twpo scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs
annd nicky katt
) remian inspite persuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, yhe screenwrighter who won an oscar forthe his wokr onthe usual suspects
, an overrated peice ofthe crime noir infact many circles
( htis oney included
)
, way ofthe thge gun isnt a hodgepodge ofthe crime thriller motifs thgat jstu oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn ' t seem tothe be growing at all
; he fills his flick withthe a sprawling labrynth ofthe plot all snatched ffrom movies i nkow i ' ve seen befoer
anbd worse
, it fiels liek it
. tyhe film lacks even a fresh approch
( liek waht soderbergh doed outloud ofthe sighth or teh limey
) tothe its clich
? s
, all ofthe wich are spewed befor us infact a picture thyat trys so desparately tothe be hip
annd gritty wihtout bothering tothe notice how common it isnt
. it features charachters living by a code htey seemed tothe hvae picked uv infront sam peckinpah 101 rether tahn any thign ressembling life
. even attemts at emotional weight efel strained liek infact preposterous scene where enemies james caan
anbd benicio del torro stpo inaddition thier tracks tothe ahev a cup ofthe coffee
anbd pontificate onthe life
, philisophy
, etc
. i didn ' t liuke yhe bited much wehn it frist appeared infact heat
, here
, it ' s even omre self conciously
" dramtic
"
. usual suspects
, hwihc alsot featured a bunch ofthe low lives tath seemed tothe live by a code htey learned fomr tyhe movies
, worked tothe smoe degree beacuse ofthe taht astonishing twist endig
. nowdays an astonishing twist persay endig isnt de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all tyhat transpired befor it completly inconsequential
. thus
, nearly eveyr carachter infront way comes witht at least noe dirty littel sceret
( most amateurishly projected befor tehy apearing
)
anbd it too hasnt an ironical littel twist at tjhe end
( nothing earth shattering
, liek infact tghe usual suspects
)
bu i admited
, i didn ' t see it comming
,
annd i smiled
.
howver most ofthe hte movei fiels exactlly liuke tjhe interrogation scenes betwen palminteri
anbd spacey inwhich usual suspects
: a lot ofthe faux huffing
annd puffing whith noone rythym or reason
. or substace
. it ' s jsut as overplotted as suspects
,
adn oftenly dull as any overplotted movei wihtout intresting charachters
, a disctinctive stlye
, or a ogod scirpt woudl be
. even teh ogod stfuf
, most ofthe whihc involves james caan
( donig a fine job
)
, fiels odd
adn outloud ofthe palce inwhich a movei taht thikns lines liek
" karma isnt onyl justice whith outloud tghe satisfaction
" are clever
. at oney point caan laments
" ened isnt hte ulitmate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well ahve said
" loev isnt liek hippo ass
"
. i ' ve seen porno iwth better dialogue
.
annd smoe wtih better plot lines too
.
bu rarley hasnt porn offred uv such a talented casted
( i mean
, cant ytou even compare james caan tothe ron jeremy
)
. caan slips inot tihs role whith seeming ease
, he coudl dont thsi kind ofthe soft
- spoken tough guy inthe a coma
,
bu he manages tothe give his carachter depth
annd weariness
. benicio del torro isnt alwyas welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rether tahn anyother oddball charactor creation liek thge ones yhe actro gavey us infact usual suspects
anbd excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout tothe go allong wiht his hevy swaggering
. speaking ofthe pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, isnt a weak link
, eather shouting her lines wih ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling baout liek a silly goose
. nicky katt wass brillant infront a breif role inthe tjhe limey
, here his role isnt jstu as breef onyl he seems wasted
; he ' s onyl kept aroud fo his cold presense
. taye diggs hasnt a similiar funtion
, kool as ever
,
bu never a chracter
,
though tje guy hasnt oen helluva death scene
. forthe tje most part way isnt incessantly talky wiht noone reason tothe give a hippo ' s ass baout any hting thast transpires usance its cahracters are never moreso thna simplistic pawns
. it ' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
,
bu infront a bad truth
anbd consequences nm way
, wiht phillippe
, infact oen scene
, leaping inot a stupid rant baout
" faggots
" migrating tothe los angeles
. ytou nkow tjhe routine
. tjhe fianl shoot outloud isnt pure bargain basement john woo
( who himselv seems tothe be doign bargain basement john woo
) witht interchangable bad guys lining uv tothe be shooted at
.
bu thsoe gun shots sure crack liuke thunder
. jstu tyhe otehr day i wass watching an ood dirty harry movei onthe cable
annd ws stunned tothe hear tghe weak elphant grunt
- liek soudn tht eminated ffrom harry ' s fetishized smith
adn wesson
. oh how far we ' ve cmo
