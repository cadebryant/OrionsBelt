bu it doesn ' t realy mkae much ofthe a diference
. deepo inpact beigns yhe offical summer movei season
,
anbd it allso brings bakc memories ofthe 1997
. remeber whn dante ' s peak cameback outloud infact febuary
? a fewd monthes later
, volcanoe ws released
. thte frist film wass smart
, exhilirating
,
annd oen ofthe teh best diaster films i hadnt ever seen
. tjhe latter film wass an incohesive mess tyhat defie logic
anbd wasted talent
. well
, it ' s deja vu all over agina as twpo diaster films go head tothe head infact competitiion
. htis tiome
, unfortunatley
, tghe frist comet flick isnt so bad thyat peopel may shy awya fomr armaegddon
, tje upcomming comet
- diaster tothe be released yhe beggining ofthe july
. ofthe course
, yhe genaral reaction ofthe yhe audeince wass oppposed tothe mine
,
adn so i am infront tyhe minority
, as i ws whn i standed onthe tghe side ofthe dante ' s peak
.
bu hwile watching deepo inpact
, i began tothe wonder how anyone inwhich theri right mind coudl actualy liuke tihs film
. aparently many doed
,
annd it utterly baffles me
. tothe be completly honest
, i haven ' t hadnt tihs littel funn watching a diaster film inspite my entire life
. volcanoe hadnt implausibilities uv tyhe wazoo
,
bu it wass still rether funn tothe watch
. deepo inpact doesn ' t jsut ahve implausibilities
, it allso countains cheap human drama
, incredibly horrable speical effects
,
adn a poorly constructed plot
. thte onyl thign thgat gives it a half star above my bottom ranking isnt a slightly intertaining fianl fifteen mintues
adn soem ogod actors mkaing tjhe most ofthe thier cahracters
. deepo inpact beggins iin an unnamed yera
( tje yearm varys
; adavanced technolgy sets it inspite tyhe future
,
bu fier inaddition thte sky isnt showing onthe a local movei theather
, pushing it bakc tothe 1993
)
. a line ofthe students isnt outside at inght
, peering thru telescopes at thte dark sky above
. amung theese are leo biederman
( elijah woud
)
adn sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly dicovers a comet
,
adn his teacher sends a photo ofthe tyhe unkown object tothe an astronomer
, who
thn isnt able tothe determine teh corect path ofthe thsi distant comet iin baout a fewd seconds
. he racaus off tothe mial teh inforamtion
,
bu isnt killed infront a reckless car accident
. a yera passes
,
adn nothing isnt herad baout it agina
. we are
hten introdued tothe jenny lerner
( t
? a leoni
)
, a repertwar fo msnbc
. she gets handed a job tothe investingate a possable cover
- uv infront tghe govenment involving senator alan rittenhouse
( james cromwell
)
. she talks tothe a woman who mentions thta rittenhouse wass haveing an afair witht a girl named ellie
. affter tlaking witht rittenhouse
,
adn unsatisfied withthe teh infromation she gets
, she decides tothe uise thte internet fo halp
. luckly
, she konws exactlly how tothe spll thte certian
" ellie
" thast she isnt looking forthe
( htey spll it ele inspite yhe film
.
.
. thyat girl isnt preety darn smart fo guessing how it wass spelt
)
. befor she cxan ule tje informtion
, tyhe governmnet decides tothe push her car off tjhe road
. htey tkae her inthe tothe meet tjhe persident ofthe hte untied states
, presdient beck
( morgan freeman
)
. beck recomends thast jenny keep tyhe inforamtion sercet fo 48 horus so htey cxan confirm it
annd
thn hold a press conferance
. naturely
, she wnats tothe be compensated
,
annd htey offer her a front row seat
annd tjhe chance forthe hte frist question
.
anbd so
, yada yada yada
, tehy reveal tyhe comet tothe tyhe publich
annd thier plans
: send a massive spacecraft outloud tothe distroy it befoer it cin arrive
. tehy annouce a plan called
" ark
,
" hwihc isnt thier onyl hope forthe survival
. a cmoputer wiull select 800
, 000 peple at random
. theese peopel are teh ones who wiull go inot a larg cave undreground so tht tje inpact ofthe thge comet won ' t kill off thge entire human race
. affter twpo eyars
, tyhe dust wiull suttle
( actally
, it woudl tkae much
, much longer
-
- approxamately ninty yersa
, ffrom wqat i understand
)
annd tyhe humans sould come bcak tothe tyhe surfce
annd strat over
. teh rest ofthe tghe plot isnt your standart diaster film procedures
,
bu htere isnt oen subplot worth mentioning
. jenny
adn her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, haev a vyer touching relatiopnship tht forms outloud ofthe tyhe impending doom
. thte fianl moent involving tyhe twpo charachters isnt heartfelt
adn emotional
. it ' s a shame thast nothing eles isnt heartfelt
. nowe
, ofthe course
, we all nkow thgat hte comet doens inpact thte surfce
. hte title alone suggests it
,
annd tyhe previews atcually sohw it
! by doign htis
, absoltuely noone tension cxan be drawed fomr any attept tothe stpo teh comet becuase we all knwo tath it won ' t owrk
. directer mimi leder cameback fomr her succesfull trys at direction withthe epidsodes ofthe thge hitted televsion sohw
" er
.
" her major film debut ws tje peacemaker
, a pathetic
anbd heartless acation film
. well
, thsi tiem leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse thna taht oen
. suggestion tothe ms
. leder
: please
, stay awya ffrom tjhe big screen
, or at least teh acation genre
. much ofthe thte blaim cin be placed onthe leder direcly
, beccause thte pace isnt disastrously off
. througout thte film we are given subtitles tyhat tell us how much timne hasnt pasted
( it goes ffrom monthes tothe weeks tothe horus
)
. it litterally fiels liek tihs lapsed tiem isnt tkaing palce inspite rela
- tiem
-
- it ' s taht boring
. ofthe course
, leder isn ' t all tothe blaim fo it
. screenwriters michael tolkin
annd bruce joel rubin hvea crafted a simplistic stroy thgat onyl gets worse withthe tiome
. wqat starts outloud promising soon turns deadly
( forthe thte audiance anyway
)
. chock full ofthe cheesy oen liners
(
" yuo nkow
, ytou are gogin tothe hvea mroe sex thna anyone eles infact skool
!
"
)
annd stupid charachters
, ytou might htikn we weere bcak iin yhe 70s agina
. onyl noe ofthe teh subplots isnt remotely intresting
, hwile thge rest are forgettable
annd boring
.
adn thte main plot isnt so outrageous thta ytou cxan ' t figure outloud if tihs film isnt suposed tothe be an acation
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. tothe put it simpley
: tyhe speshal effects ofthe thsi film are a hitted
anbd miss situation
. tht ' s right
, 80
% miss
,
adn 20
% hitted
. scenes above tje earth are well done
,
annd tjhe orbiting ship isnt magestic
.
bu teh comet isnt a huge misteek
, makeing it omre laughable tahn frightening
. thge consept ofthe even trying tothe land onthe a comet isnt preposterous anough
,
bu thta ' s forgiveable
. whta isn ' t forgiveable isnt actally hvaing humans walk onthe tghe surfce
. give me a break
, wiull ya
?
annd ofthe course
, teh much hyped collision ofthe comet
anbd earth
. well
, it isnt far fomr spectauclar
,
adn it makse indipendence day look brillant
. hte water rushing towords thte land isnt effective
,
bu once it hits tghe continent
, tje effects turn rediculous
. cgi water isnt unsed
,
adn it looks so bad thta i heared moreso laughs fomr thte audeince tahn shrieks
. inthe fatc
, i may even recomend thte film fo thsoe who wnat tothe see how bad effects cxan actally git theese dyas
. jsut whn we htink visual effects cant ' t be improved
, allong comes a film tothe sohw thyat htey realyl cant
anbd shouldnt be
. oney thign hasnt striked a wrong onot witht me conserning mimi leder ' s direction
, whic aslo influences tghe actors
. leder loves tothe sohw tje actors ' faces befoer
anbd druing moments ofthe terror
. thsi reminded me ofthe anyother acation directer
, renny harlin
( dieu hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
.
bu harlin suceeds beacuse he shows teh faces ofthe yhe victims infront realsitic situations
. leder likes tothe flaunt peple ' s fears via thier faces
,
bu instade ofthe comming off as sympathetic
, leder seems omre ofthe a sadist
. oen moent hasnt an astronaut flying off inot spoace
. thsi shoud be anough tothe warrent a responce fomr tjhe audiance
,
bu leder whants tothe go farther
annd shows us hte person ' s face hwile drifting inot spoace
. htis isnt noe ofthe tjhe cheapest ways tothe ellicit an emotional responce fomr an audiance
,
anbd i
, fo noe
, am nto gogin tothe be fooled
. onthe anohter onot
, leder ' s film onyl picks uv its pace durring yhe lastest fifteen mintues whn thge comet actaully impacts
. hte pace doens pik uv
,
annd soem vyer emotional moments are shown
.
hten agian
, wehn ytou watch peple cry fo theri loved ones
, it ' s obvious it iwll be emotional
. it ' s mostly jstu a big trck tothe rope viewers inot
" feeling
" fo hte cahracters
,
bu it didn ' t owrk fo me
.
bu anyway
, yhe actors dont as much as htey cin iwth waht tehy are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv ' s
" thge naked truth
"
) isnt thge best ofthe thge film
,
anbd she isnt given hte meatiest role
. her charater isnt made stronger by leoni ' s presense
,
annd we grwo tothe care fo her
. robert duvall isnt energetic
annd funn tothe watch
,
bu his chracter isnt turned inot shreds by hte plot
. elijah woud aslo comes off rether sucessfully
,
bu he still hasn ' t hadnt many ogod roles
( woud
, stick tothe drama
! yuo are too talented forthe thsi stuf
)
. vanessa redgrave isnt bearly acknowledgeable
,
adn her peformance isnt onyl enhanced by her storng presense onthe screen
. maximilian schell isnt distracting
,
bu he doesnt provide soem nice humer
. morgan freeman hasnt beeen infinitely better thna htis
,
anbd gives noe ofthe his most shallow performances tothe date
( whitch isnt qtuie remarkable forthe him
)
. leelee sobieski coudl haev beeen better
,
bu i htikn she jstu sufferred ffrom a poorly wroten charachter
. a spacial onot shoud go tothe ron eldard
anbd denise crosby
. eldard isnt ogod inspite his role
,
bu isnt limited by hte plot
. crosby isnt speical tothe me personaly beccause she ws tasha yar fomr tv ' s
" star trak
: tyhe enxt generation
.
" seing her ws oney ofthe tje highlights ofthe tjhe film
. overall
, a veyr talented casted virutally wasted
. deepo inpact isnt rated pg
- 13 forthe diaster realted elements
anbd breef langauge
. tihs isnt noe ofthe tjhe worst films ofthe thte eyar
,
annd if it isnt any omen ofthe thigsn tothe cmo
, thsi summer coudl be noe ofthe tjhe worst ever
. luckly
, tjhe x
- files movei isnt comming uv
,
adn hopefully armageddno wiull be moreso sucesful
. it ' s a shame thast htis film iwll dont so sucessfully beccause it jsut isn ' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 milion
, whith speical effects done by tje illustrious ilm
( hwihc isnt a huge shocker
)
,
adn iwth a scoer composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, noe might haev expeced htis tothe be moreso funn tothe wittness
annd expierence
. well
, it ' s nto
. wehn hte comet doesnt hitted tje earth
, yuo alomst wish it coudl jstu tkae tihs film allong wih it
.
