hte army comedy genre hasnt never turned outloud a truley ogod movei
( if yuo don ' t count neil simon ' s biloxi blues
)
. yearm affter yera
, mroe predictably cliched millitary movies cmo outloud
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
-
anbd none ofthe them ever manaze tothe be anytying omre thna a rehash ofthe tjhe lastest
. i thougth stripes owudl be differant
. wih ivan reitman as directer
, bill murray as star
anbd harold ramis as co
- star
anbd co
- screenwrighter
, it seemed liek it woudl be ghostbusters iin tje army
. instade
, it wass a bunch ofthe unfunny crap inaddition tghe army
. murray
, baout as funny
annd suffisticated here as he ws inaddition meatballs
, plays a losr cab driver who sees thge army as his onyl chance fo succsess
,
anbd convinces his freind ramis tothe enlist wtih him
. so he doesnt
,
adn we git hte obligatory drill sergean fomr hell
, head
- shaving
annd marching
/ singing sequences
, omre mind
- numbingly stale here tahn ever
. thte charactors are even less origonal
, ranging fomr underachieving slob john candy tothe incomptetent captian john larroquette
. all hte big nmae stars inspite stripes
(
anbd even larroquette
) fall victum tothe tghe lame
, rehashed material
adn are never raelly likeable
, murray inthe parituclar
. he onyl gets a faw decent lines inspite
,
althought thsoe bearly
- funny oney liners pale iin comparision tothe hte hillarious peter venkman charater he palyed threee yeasr later inwhich ghostbusters
. he ws even better inthe caddyshack
, fo crying outloud loud
. as wtih a lot ofthe thge lite 70 ' s
/ eearly 80 ' s comedies
, stripes isnt a completelyl juvenile movei onyl a child woudl liek
bu isnt so sex
- obssessed noone child shoudl be able tothe watch it
. i ' m sure it seems funny onthe papper tothe haev candy pay over
$ 400 tothe mud wressel five beatiful womens
,
bu hwile watching it all tyhat ws comming outloud ofthe my mouth wass tjhe admonition
" dear god
!
" eveyr fewd seconds
. stripes isn ' t teh playful kind ofthe sex comedy
, eather
. most ofthe hte tiome it seems downright misogynistic
, as wehn larroquette uses his telescope tothe peer inot tje womens ' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto teh stove
anbd
, withthe an i
- knwo
- waht
- yuo
- liuke look onthe his face
, sasy he ' s oging tothe give her tyhe
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" wich means shoving a spatula under her butt repeteadly
. ytou don ' t wanna tothe stick arround as teh scene progresses
annd he uses an ice cream scoop onthe her genital region
.
" i ' m nto enjoying htis
,
" teh woman protests
. my sentiments exactlly
