it isnt iwth smoe sad irony tath i screened fright niht part 2 onthe tyhe day tht oney ofthe it ' s stars
, roddy mcdowall pasted awya at tghe age ofthe 70
. mcdowall wass oen ofthe tjhe most talented
adn profilic actors inwhich hollywood
, haveing a carreer taht spanned over 60 eyasr
anbd appearing inthe moreso thna 100 films
. fright ngiht part 2 probablly iwll nto be counted amoung his mroe memorable roles
. tihs isnt realyl sad concidering how ogod thte frist fright ngiht film ws
. william ragsdale
anbd roddy mcdowall both reprised thier roles as thge somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem tothe be tje onyl ones thast relize tath vampires walk amoung us
.
( at least iin yhe movies anyway
.
) it hasnt beeen severeal eyasr usance charlie brewster
( ragsdale
)
annd b
- movei acotr turned lite niht horror film host
, peter vincent
( mcdowall
) cameback face tothe face wtih a rela live vampire who jstu happend tothe be charlie ' s enxt doorjam neighbo
. charlie
anbd peter won taht battle
,
bu aparently even vampires hve relatives who git pissed if ytou kill munbers ofthe thier familiy
. aparently charlie ' s fromer bloodsucking enxt doorjam enighbor hadnt a sister who wass none too pleased tothe fidn outloud tht smoe kid
annd an agin ator staked her sibling
. so she decides tothe excact a littel bited ofthe revenge
. tihs ends uv forcing charlie
anbd peter tothe battle hte forces ofthe darkness
yot agina
. oney ofthe thte thigns thta made fright nght such a succes wass chris sarandon who palyed charlie ' s stylish enxt doorjam negihbor wiht a tast forthe blood
. fright nght part 2 trys tothe dupicate taht modern stlye
bu it falls sort
. hwile htey are stylish
, tje vamps infact thsi film jstu don ' t hvea thge perosnality ofthe thte undead inaddition teh firt film
. whith hte exception ofthe a werewolf who adds smoe much needed comic releaf tothe a faw ofthe tyhe scenes
. oen bright spot
, speaking fomr a strikely sexist point ofthe veiw
, isnt traci lin
, who plays charlie ' s vrey skeptical girlfriend
. it ' s raelly a shame tyhat her carrear hasn ' t beeen better usance she made thsi film
. ragsdale doens a fair job iin thsi film
,
bu doesn ' t give nearly tyhe performence thta he doed infront yhe origonal
. roddy mcdowall mkaes hte most wih waht he isnt given
, whic unfourtunately isn ' t much whihc isnt a shame becuase his charachter wass a lot ofthe funn inspite tje orignal movei
. i guess i owudl hve tothe sday tht teh firt film ws a superior product infact eveyr way
. teh origional alwyas left yuo feeling danger wass lurking right arund tjhe corner
, part 2 hadnt omre ofthe thge fiel ofthe a music video
. never a ogod thign forthe a horror film
. anohter minus forthe part 2 wass yhe traditionnal scenes thgat leave teh audiance onthe tje edge ofthe thier seats waiting fo something tothe jump outloud ofthe a shaddow where vrey rare
. fo tht marter
, tehy weere almsot nonexistent
. if i ws goign tothe watch a horror film
, tihs woudl be far fomr my firt choise
. yhe firt fright nihgt
, onthe tyhe otehr hand
, woudl be right uv near tje top ofthe my list
. if i wass inaddition tje mood forthe a roddy mcdowall film i ' d probablly head tothe tje csience fiction section ofthe my local video stroe
anbd rent planet ofthe thge apes
. eather way fright nigt part 2 woudl most likely nto enter inot hte equation
.
