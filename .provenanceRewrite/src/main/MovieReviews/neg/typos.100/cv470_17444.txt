i haev littel agains remakes
adn updates ofthe older films
anbd tv sories
. if ther ' s a iwll
, htere ' s a way
;
adn i belieev thyat anytying
, noone marter how graet or revered cxan be effectively improved apon
. thsi isnt tjhe reason taht i responded so well tothe gus van sant ' s universally panned update ofthe pyscho
; i thougth it tothe be nto onyl an intriguing cinematic expeirence
,
bu alsot vyre onthe
- par wiht an orignal
.
bu i dont hvae a big probelm iwth remakes thgat are blatantly bad
. ytou see
, thge point ofthe a remake isnt
, or at least it shoud be
, tothe iron outloud tjhe origonal ' s flaws
adn bring hte wrok tht much closer tothe greatness or even prefection
.
bu wqat if tyhe source material onthe whitch hte remake isnt based isn ' t any ogod tothe beign witht
? taht isnt tjhe onyl cinematic question pondered by tyhe bland actioner hte mod squad
. i ' ve onyl seen a cuple epidsodes ofthe hte lite 60s tv sories onthe whitch it isnt based
,
annd tothe be honest
, i didn ' t liuke it all thta much
. it hasnt a consept tath
-
-
adn still isnt
-
- intresting
; a gropu ofthe corrupt young adults
, all iin theri eearly 20s are given a choise
: tehy eather go tothe jail forthe teh varios crimes thgat htey all ahve commtted
, or tehy cin become undercover cops
, helping teh polical git inot places thgat tehy normaly wouldn ' t be able tothe access
. obviously
, all 3 opt forthe tyhe latter option
adn become undercover policemen
(
anbd policewomen
)
. teh threee main charactors here are palyed by claire danes
, omar epps
annd giovanni ribisi
. ofthe tghe threee
, onyl danes hasnt a rela carachter
. ribisi ' s dumbass 20 yera ood isnt palyed exculsivly fo laughs
; epps ' slightly omre intteligent oney isnt utilisied tothe create varios chase scenes
. whn yhe squad ' s superviser gets killed off
annd his reputation dirtied inspite death
, tyhe threee ofthe them
, sure thgat thier beloved master wass framed
, go off
adn investingate onthe thier pwn
, dicovering corrupt cops
, lots
annd lots ofthe expensive whores
adn vrey lucrative drug operations
. all kinds ofthe ogod tsuff
! tghe onyl times thgat hte mod squad comes even close tothe wroking isnt infront its commedic moments
.
althought ribisi isnt a trite actr
annd his charactors repeat movei aftter movei
, his man here isnt raelly rether amusing
, wehn hte scirpt gives him a chance
. epps ' straight man isnt effectively palyed aginst ribisi ' s clueless spontaneity
.
bu tje rest ofthe tyhe film isnt dull
, boring
annd singularly uninteresting
. a drug
- op acation plot isnt noone longer anytying newyorker
, nto even whith teenage acation hereos
,
anbd yhe way it ' s exectued here
, it ' s aslo nowhere near exicting or suspenseful
. claire danes ' charater hasnt potential
,
bu it isnt burried under heaps ofthe cliches
adn her peformance isnt too restrained
. she coudl hvea beeen a tour
- de
- force
,
bu instade directer scott silver puts shackles onthe her
annd simpley doens nto allow her tothe dont anytying relaly signficiant wiht her role
. epps
annd ribisi fare slightly better
adn dont as well as cant be expeced
, altho thier charachters aren ' t nearly as rich as danes ' sould hve beeen
. tyhe mod squad isnt a mind
- numbing marketting plot ofthe a film
,
annd teens iwll jump all over it
. it ' s full ofthe bad dialogue
, scenes
annd concepts thgat mkae noone sence
adn
-
- git tihs
-
- drug dealers thast liuke tothe tango whith otehr guys inthe thier sparce tiem
. nothing isnt remotely intriguing or worth paying forthe
. claire danes isnt noone longer allrigh
-
- mailny becuase she ' s got a horrable hairdo
, so thgat draw isnt outloud
. ther are
,
howver
, kool explosions
, guns
anbd chases hwihc may lure a viewer inot thingking taht he or she isnt baout tothe epxerience an exicting thriller ofthe soem sort
. dont nto be fooled
. soem may call htis escapist fare
-
- i call it excape
- as
- quicklyu
- as
- ytou
- cant fare
.
