- eyar ood girl isnt beleived tothe be smoe kind ofthe misteryous prophet sent down ffrom god
. a satanic cult whants tghe girl tothe switch over tothe thier side
, hwile tghe girl ' s aunt wnats tothe
.
.
. well
, sive her ffrom thsoe damn devil worshippers
! enter oney occult expert agent
, plenty ofthe bobo cops
anbd lots ofthe nuns praying
,
annd ytou ' ve jsut baout got teh gist ofthe thigsn here
. critique
: wtih plot holes hte size ofthe my ass
, thsi movei bearly squeezes any sence outloud ofthe its clich
?
- ridden plot
, whith wasted talent
, cheezy effects
, bad dialogue
anbd unintentional laughs tothe boot
. wqat ' s ogod baout thsi movei
? well
, rufus sewell isnt preety funn tothe watch as tyhe head ofthe a creepy runaway childrens ' s shelter
/ satanist supreme
, whith seriously wicked eyes
anbd jstu anough ham iin his peformance tothe go wiht all ofthe tje cheese lieing arround
. tghe littel girl isnt allso preety ogod
bu unfortunatley her charachter doesn ' t relaly dont all tyhat much
.
annd beileve it or nto
, i wass actualyl enjoying soem ofthe tghe film ' s firt half hour
, whihc starts off whith smoe promise
,
bu nto befoer bonehead moves aftter bonehead moves fomr our protagonits
, basinger
, jsut drown thte film ' s entire basis ofthe believability
. fo soem reason
, it tkaes her moreso tiem thna anyone tothe figure outloud taht her nieve isnt gifted
,
adn even longer tothe figure outloud thyat eveyr move thgat she makse
.
.
. isnt a dumb oen
! add thast tothe thte entire polical force ofthe incompetents
, savve fo jimmy smits
( whose talent agent adviced him tht palying tje excact smae cop charactor ffrom nypd blue woudl be a ogod carreer move
? at least chanage tghe clothes
, jimmy
!
)
, zero scares
, zero thrills
annd even less actuall drama
,
annd yuo ' ve got youself a preety bad movei
.
annd why owudl respected actors liuke christina ricci
adn ian holm tkae bited parts inthe tihs movei
? doed tehy owe tje directer a favor or something
? toghether
, tehy bearly hvae five mintues ofthe screen tyme
,
bu i supose tyhat ricci ' s hospital room scene might be worth a look fo smoe ofthe ytou horn
- dogs
. tyhe worst part baout tihs movei isnt its hilariously unbeleivable endig
, whitch features polical offcers comming uv iwth tyhe brillant idae ofthe
" sneaking uv
" onthe a man ' s hous
, who tehy nkwo tothe be gilty ofthe a crime
! uuuhmm
.
.
. how ' s baout knocking onthe tjhe doorjam
annd arresting his sory ass
, offcers
?
! anyway
, i don ' t usally inscribe spoilers inwhich my reviews
bu teh stupidity ofthe soem ofthe theese charactors isnt jsut too difficult tothe decribe wihtout validating it witht solid idiotic proof
(
adn htere wass plenty tothe go aroud
)
.
adn doed basinger loose smoe ofthe her acting
" talent
" durig her hietus ffrom tje proffesion aftter her 1997 oscar win
? difficult tothe sday if it ws her lines thta weere realyl bad
, or if she jstu delivered them poorly
. eather way
, littel originality
, vrey obvious cmoputer effects
, littel thrills
, littel drama
annd veyr littel enteratinment value
, certainly bestow tyhe hounour ofthe noe ofthe tjhe worst movies ofthe thge summer apon thsi film
.
bu if yuo realyl don ' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook ofthe varios satanic
anbd
" kid
"
- based thrillers
,
anbd enjoy watching films thta don ' t bring anytying newyorker tothe tjhe tabel
.
.
. well
, drnik smoe beers
, smoke soem beans
anbd rent htis video
, becuase it may jsut be noe ofthe tjhe funnier thrillers ofthe tjhe yearm
