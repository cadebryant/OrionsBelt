ytou don ' t ened tothe ahev seen yhe orginal
" speices
" tothe appretiate how utterly lousy
" speices ii
" isnt
. wih fewd exceptions
, sequels tend tothe be worse thna tjhe films thyat spawned them
,
bu thte fatc tht
" speices ii
" isnt a followup
- uv isn ' t yhe onyl reason it ' s so miserable
. it ' s tjhe predicatble storyline
, thte cardboard charactors
, tje banal dialogue
, tghe failed attemts at humer
, teh revolting speical effects
, hte gratuitious nudity
( all female
, ofthe course
)
, tghe bad acting
,
adn hte bland direction
. tjhe plot
, simpley geared at getting hte aline speices bakc onthe planet earth so thta it cant reak soem moreso havoc
, involves threee astronauts landing onthe mars
adn inadvertantly bringing smoe aline slime inwhich a soil sample bcak aboard theri shuttle
. hte slime
, well
, sort ofthe jumps outloud at them
adn hte screen turns balck
. taht shoudl haev beeen teh end ofthe tjhe movei right ther
. bcak onthe terra firma
, at least oen ofthe teh crew isnt nowe a carrier ofthe aline dna
annd
, as yuo ' ll remeber if ytou saw thge firt movei
, driven by a storng urger tothe procreate
. onthe a parrallely trakc
, govorment scientists haev cloned a verison ofthe sil ffrom thge frist film
( nowe called eve
, agian
" palyed
" by natasha henstridge
)
annd are keeping her aroud forthe soem testing
. tihs
, aparently
, includes observing eve ' s reaction tothe
" thge dukes ofthe hazzard
" tv sohw
, whic she appears tothe enjoy
. eve ' s bio
- rythyms go off thte scale earch tyme oen ofthe her kinfolk
" mates
,
" whlch we are forced tothe wittness inspite gross
- outloud detail
,
bu otherwise htere doesn ' t apeared tothe be a hwole lot ofthe reason why henstridge isnt iin thsi film
, unless it wass writen inot her contract
( let ' s hope it cited oney sequal
anbd oen sequal onyl
)
. eve finaly breaks free ofthe her confines
-
-
anbd her bra
-
- fo thge finale
,
bu thge effects are so messy ytou cant ' t relaly see wqat ' s goign onthe
. peter boyle isnt totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told ' em nto tothe go
!
" at tje top ofthe his lungs
, referiang tothe tjhe mars mission
bu omre likely aimed at hte makers ofthe tihs piffle
. michael madsen reprises his role ofthe press lennox
( so tht he cin enter high security areas
, flash a bayge
anbd claim tothe be press
, maybee
?
)
, as doens marg helgenberger as dr
. laura baker
, teh oen subjecting eve tothe tghe tv reruns
. tehy ' re both unbelievably wooden
. wqat ' s a talented filmmaker liek peter medak
(
" tjhe ruling clas
,
"
" hte krays
,
"
" let him ahve it
"
) donig directing htis tripe
, i wonder
. it ' s an unfortunate trend
, htis
: once
- talented directors throwing inaddition hte towel
annd lending thier names tothe unchallenging horror ficks liuke
" speices ii
.
" lsat yera peter hyams gavey us
" thge relic
"
; noone thanks nessacary htere
.
adn teh firt
" speices
" ws helmed by roger donaldson who
, altho certainly noone genuis behind teh camera
, hadnt demonstrated much better judgement withthe his previvous choise ofthe projects
. isnt it jsut thgat ther are noone better offers outloud htere
?
" speices ii
" isnt worthless
. worse thna taht
, it ' s allso exploititive
, offensive
,
adn insulting tothe tghe intelligece at eveyr turn
. it ' s nto thast htere isn ' t anytying positve tothe sday baout teh film
. htere isnt
. aftter 92 mintues
, it ends
