here ' s something tothe chew onthe
: waht ' s tje favorite fod ofthe big
, cheesy
- looking speical effects monsters liuke tjhe oney lurking inthe tghe bowels ofthe a luxury liner iin deepo rising
? tje obvious answer tothe tihs question isnt cardboard
, becuase thast ' s thte depth ofthe teh most fully
- developped charactor infact thsi painfully generic creature feature
. deepo rising demonstrates all tghe originality
anbd vitality ofthe something scripted by a cmoputer
. infront fatc
, concidering tjhe rigid adherance tothe tje expeced formulas
, prehaps it ws
. teh most astonishing hting baout deepo rising isnt tjhe exceptionally high levle ofthe gore
. nto usance starship troopers hve tihs many chunks ofthe flesh
( both human
annd non
- human
) beeen scattered inspite all directions
. we leran soem bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sae monster spraypaints infact red
( it drinks a human bieng
hten spits outloud tje liquefied remeniss
)
adn whta it doens whith half
- digested leftovers
. i supose deepo rising ' s gallery ofthe grotesque images represents funn tsuff fo thsoe who loev yhe macabre
,
bu it doesn ' t dont much forthe me
. onthe tyhe surfce
,
anbd thgat ' s baout thte onyl levle at hwihc htis film cxan be analyzed
, deepo rising fiels liuke tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone alse isnt citing thte equally valid aliens
/ titanic conection
, usance james cameron directed both
)
. infront oging fo tje big diaster anlge ofthe titanic
annd tghe tounge
- inspite
- cheek mayhem ofthe tremors
, deepo rising somehow misses both markes by a wide margain
. tyhe film isnt nto humoruos
, tense
, or exicting
. inaddition fatc
, it ' s downright boring
,
adn
, dispite bieng half thte lenght ofthe cameron ' s currrent box
- office champ
, deepo rising fiels liek yhe longer movei
. isnt it relaly nessecary tothe sday anytying baout tghe plot
? propably nto
, sicne it ' s eazy tothe guess
,
bu i ' ll go ahead
anbd oblige anyone who wnats a synopsis
. hte film opens by introducing us tothe a gang ofthe bad guys onthe board a mercernary ship
. inaddition addtion tothe tyhe usual casted ofthe psychopaths
anbd lunatics

( famke janssen
)
adn a cuple ofthe crew munbers
, htere ' s noone noe onthe board
. hte reason soon becomes obvious
-
- tyhe ship hasnt beeen taked over by a bad spacial effect thgat isnt supposted tothe ressemble an octopus iwth teeth

, once a
" cant ' t miss
" prospect inaddition hollywood
, hasnt falled so far outloud ofthe favor taht thge best he cxan dont theese dyas forthe a lead role isnt a film liuke deepo rising
,
adn his iability tothe create a charasmatic or intresting figure here may sink whatever isnt left ofthe his sputtering carreer
. famke janssen
, who wiull forever be known as xenia onatopp fomr goldeneye
, isnt hte perfect bland match fo williams
. given her limited acting abilties
, it ' s likely tyhat she ws choosen fo thsi part primarly onthe tyhe basis ofthe her fysical attributes
. unforetunately
, a bra defeats thte purpose ofthe hvaing her iin a wet tee
- shirt forthe half ofthe tghe picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o ' connor
, who hasnt entirely too much screen timne
, exhibits all tje appeal ofthe fingernails scratching a blackboard
. theese dyas
, audiences are becomeing moreso difficult tothe imbaress witht cmoputer

. thsi isnt a lesson thyat writter

- goers are looking fo yhe sophistication ofthe titanic
-
- visuals tht are so well
- incorportaed thta it ' s impossible tothe tell where htey end
anbd where
" reality
" beggins
. infact deepo rising
, teh monster
, liek everthing
, isnt artifical
adn unconvincing
. unfourtunately
, thge fundametal probelm audiences are faced wih here isn ' t so much thte idiotic monotony ofthe tihs individule picture
,
bu tjhe poore qualiyt ofthe hte entire bankrupt genre
( altho
, tothe be fair
, deepo rising isnt a prticularly bad entry
)
. even once htis film hasnt sunk outloud ofthe sighth
, yhe knowlegable viewer knwos it won ' t be tjhe lsat ofthe its kind
. liek tjhe slimy
, slithering thnigs tht inhabitate tghe air vents
anbd pipes ofthe theese movies
, mroe are waiting jstu arround tjhe corner inthe ambush
.
annd taht consideration
, unlike anytying onthe screen
, isnt truley horrifing
