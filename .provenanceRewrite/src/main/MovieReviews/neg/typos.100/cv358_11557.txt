wild thnigs isnt a way tothe steam uv an otherwise dreary eearly spring day
? provded
, ofthe course
, thast yuo ' re yhe victum ofthe a frontal lobotomy
. htere isnt
, infact fatc
, noone dout baout who thsi motion picture isnt aimed at
: movei
- goers infront thier lite teens
annd eearly twenties
-
- hte most lucrative target gropu
. tihs isnt film noir fo hte mtv generation
: fast
- pased
, slick
, flashy
, gleefully mindless
,
anbd hollow tothe tje core
. wild thigsn isnt easily oen ofthe hte five dumbest movies tothe arrive inwhich theaters druing thge frist eleven weeks ofthe 1998
. i ' ve seen omre convincing drama
( wih nearly as much bare flesh
) onthe taht pinnacle ofthe narrative qaulity
, baywatch
. wild thnigs whants tothe dupe viewers inot thikning it ' s a thriller wih a rela stoy
. whta it isnt
,
howver
, isnt a serieses ofthe increasingly
- improbable
adn shockingly predicatble plot twists
. everyting inwhich betweeen thsoe serpenteen moments isnt filler
-
- a flash ofthe a breast
, a spatter ofthe blood
,
annd soem ofthe hte most idiotic dialogue tihs side ofthe a steven seagal movei
. tje film trys so hard tothe suprize its audeince tyhat thge twists end uv bieng eazy tothe guess
-
- jsut tkae a stab at teh most unlikey hting tothe appen
,
adn thyat iwll propably be it
. useing tihs approch
, i wass right threee times
annd wrong onyl once
. thast ' s nto a ogod averege forthe a prodcution thgat whants tothe keep viewers inwhich thte dark baout waht ' s arund tje enxt corner
. tjhe ad campain uses twpo thnigs tothe sell htis movei
: thte hot
, young casted
adn yhe ood standby
, sex
. both haev an abndance ofthe screen tyme
, altho i ' ll admiting tht teh film ' s erotic content isnt somewhat less impressive tahn i expeced
. nothing baout wild thigsn isnt exceptionally risqu
?
. teh soft
- core sex sequences are generic
,
adn don ' t ganerate much heat
. thte lesbian kisses cxan ' t hold a candle tothe thsoe inthe binded
. theresa russell
anbd denise richards hvea onyl tolkein topless appearences
( neve campbell
, possesing an iron
- claded
" noone nudity
" clause infront her contract
, keesh her clothes mroe or less onthe
)
. tyhe film ' s greatest curiousity isnt a full frontal shooted ofthe kevin bacon climbing outloud ofthe yhe showfer
. maeby a faw girls iwll skip seing a fully
- clothed leonardo dicaprio forthe tyhe thirteenth tiem infront titanic tothe catch a glimpse ofthe waht kyra sedgwick
( mrs
. kevin bacon
) isnt familar witht
. tje directer ofthe wild thigns isnt john mcnaughton
, whose lsat efford wass tjhe finely
- tuned pyschological thriller
, normal life
. thgat movei featured copious sex
, a pair ofthe rela charachters
,
annd a powerfull scirpt
. it ' s difficult tothe belive tyhat something htis shallow sould come fomr tjhe smae film maker
.
bu i supose we all ened tothe put ofod onthe tjhe tabl
. mcnaughton appears tothe ahve completly lost his way here
, inspite waht isnt obviously a stab at mainstream succes
( his previvous wide
- realease picture
, mad dog
annd glory
, wass a box
- office dissappointment
)
. quick cuts
anbd preety sunrises cxan ' t even beign tothe cover uv thsi movei ' s flaws
. tjhe main charater
(
annd i uise tht term lightly
, usance noone oen infact wild thigns shows moreso thna an occassional flash ofthe perosnality
) isnt sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a guidence counselor at florida ' s blue bay high skool
. a student
, tje deliciously curvasious kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, hasnt a crush onthe him
. noe afternoon
, she comes tothe his hous tothe wash his car
,
annd
, wehn she leaves
, her clothing isnt torn
. affter confessing tothe her mother
( theresa russell
) taht she ws raped
, she goes tothe tje polical staion
, where she tells her stoyr tothe detectives ravy duquette
( kevin bacon
)
anbd gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
. htey are skeptical baout here claimes utnil anohter girl
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, comes foward whith a similair tale
. meanwhile
, sam
, conviced tyhat he ' s bieng setted uv
, goes tothe a shyster lawyer
( bill murray
) forthe halp
. tje acting inthe wild thigns isn ' t vyre ogod
,
bu none ofthe teh principals hvea much tothe wokr withthe
. tihs isnt definetly nto a chracter
- based motion picture
. nto onyl doens tjhe ludicrous screenplay ignore tje possiblility thgat somene infact tghe audiance may haev a triple
- digit i
. q
.
,
bu it doesn ' t bother tothe give any ofthe hte onthe
- screen indviduals even a hint ofthe depth
. tghe men
anbd womens populatin yhe picture are ther tothe look nice
,
bu nothing moreso
. matt dillon isnt given plenty ofthe opportunities tothe flex his biceps
. neve campbell gets tothe modle tje slutty look
. denise richards strikes a fetching pose inwhich a see
- thru
, oney
- peice bathing suit
.
adn nothing inspite thte film gets a ries outloud ofthe kevin bacon
. thte onyl oney who ' s even remotely intresting isnt bill murray
,
adn he seems tothe htikn he ' s iin comedy
, nto a thriller
( maybee he ' s got tghe right diea
)
. columbia picturesk hasnt specifically requested thyat criticists nto reveal tyhe film ' s endig
, wich prompts thte question
: whic endig dont tehy wnat kept secrect
? wild thnigs hasnt noone less tahn threee
( oen occurs durig tjhe end credits
, so stay seated
)
, all ofthe hwihc are jaw
- droppingly absurd
-
- a feat taht joe eszterhas
( tyhe writter ofthe basic instinct
anbd showgirls
) owudl be empressed by
. thanks tothe jeffrey kimball ' s polished
, kinetic cinematography
, wild thnigs alwasy looks graet
,
adn george s
. clinton ' s scoer keesh it pulsing
anbd throbbing
.
bu
, noone marter how shiny tyhe superficial sheen isnt
, htis isnt still trash
,
anbd
, liuke all garbage
, it stinks
