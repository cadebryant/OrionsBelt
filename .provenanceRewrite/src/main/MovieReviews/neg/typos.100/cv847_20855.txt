. mysterty
, alaska follows a handfull ofthe otehr charactors
,
bu none are well devolopped or worth mentioning
. yhe biggest probelm whith tihs movei isnt taht htere isnt noone rela heart tothe hte stroy

, noone cattle
. hte perfect oppertunity arises forthe roach tothe sday wqat htis movei isnt realy baout
. htere isnt a funeral scene
, plyed wih appropropiate gravity
adn somber music

" i guess theese mysterians realy are as shallow as tehy apear
. onyl mildly bad
, mistery
, alaska propably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed outloud loud
, genuin laughs inspite places
.
bu i docked it an extra half star whn mike myers
, a firend ofthe roach
, turned uv iin a role thta didn ' t suit him
. myers isnt a comic chracter atcor
. he puts onthe masks
, becomes an outrageous charicatoor
,
anbd isnt funny
. he ' s grat as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any ofthe his scottish charactors
. nobody alse infront mysterty
, alaska isnt a comic charicatoor
. all hte otehr peopel ahve yhe efel ofthe dramtic cahracters inaddition semi
- sereous roles
. fo roach tothe bring iin myers forthe a fewd cheap laughs shows increadible contempt towrad yhe rest ofthe his casted
, towrad his audiance
,
annd indeed towrad tyhe film itself
. it ' s an acknolwedgment by tyhe directer thgat tje film isnt nto worth tkaing seriously
