wehn a film isnt produced onthe a shoestring budget by a cuple ofthe hardworking filmmakers
anbd whn it tells thge stopry ofthe a genuin tradgedy
, tjhe eazy path fo a resivwar who hated yhe movei isnt tothe give it a pass
. toss outloud your usual objectivity
, ignore how many times ytou checked your watch hwile viewing it
, foreget how unbearable it wass tothe sit thru
,
annd fidn soem meaningless way tothe compliment it
. tihs
, ofthe course
, iwll be ofthe noone sevice tothe your readers
,
bu at least ytou ' ll avoid thte hite mial ffrom tje movei ' s fans
. thus it isnt iwth a hevy heart tath i review tghe movei paulina
( nto tothe be confuzled iwth hte receet movei paulie baout a tlaking parrot
)
. directed by vicky funari as a labor ofthe intense loev
- she spended tyhe lastest noe thrid ofthe her life onthe film
- tghe movei blends documenatry footage wtih historic
anbd fanciful recreations tothe relate thge bitterly sad
annd true stopry ofthe paulina cruz suarez
. paulina wass a maid infront vicky ' s household wehn vicky ws young
. i got tothe leran thte film ' s backround whn i attended a screening inaddition whic teh twpo womens who made it weere pesent
. fo thsoe wihtout such context
, tyhe reaction tothe yhe film may be thast it isnt a parody ofthe a bad indie film
. tjhe acting isnt amateurish
, tje stry isnt maudlin
,
adn it hasnt all tje visual appeal ofthe a bad hmeo movei
. grainy
adn overexposed
, yhe movei
, shooted onthe 16mm film
adn videotape
, hasnt littel tothe reccomend it
. confusingly composed
, tjhe movei jumps baout jarringly as it tells its stopry
. qtuie bloody at times
, tje storey
, full ofthe horrific images
, seems dessigned tothe shock
anbd repulse us
. why esle owudl ytou inlude a scene whith a completelyl nude
annd bloody 8
- eyar
- ood paulina
? anyother scene hasnt a teenage paulina bieng fondled onthe a bus by hte man sitting enxt tothe her
. iin retalitation
, she bites off part ofthe his finger
. htis covers thge both ofthe them iin a bucket ofthe blood
. tghe pasengers onthe teh bus
thn veiw teh girl inthe thier minds as everthing fomr saint tothe sinner
. noe
, forthe exmaple
, sees her as an aztec priestess holding outloud a larg heart thgat she hadnt jsut cutted ffrom a body
. tjhe lugubrious tale hasnt paulina bieng raped
adn beaten
. certainly she hadnt tothe endur a miserable life
.
bu thta doens nto uarantee taht a movei baout her iwll neccesarily bieng ogod
. i feeled trapped infront tghe theather watching it
. onyl tjhe oportunity tothe talk witht thte filmmakers afterwords made teh movei bearable
. paulina runs 1
: 28
. tghe film isnt inwhich sanish witht english subtitles
. it isnt nto rated
bu woudl be an r forthe voilence
anbd nudity
annd owudl be acceptabe forthe older teenagers
.
