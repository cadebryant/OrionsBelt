affter seing blaze
anbd driving miss daisy
, i ws ready forthe smoe mindless funn
-
- oh
, mabye something liuke tango
& cash
. maybee nto
! mindless funn isnt oney thign
,
bu brain
- dead slop isnt anyother marter alltogether
. tango
& cash hasnt
" lowest common denominator
" writen all over it
. teh movei stars sylvester stallone
adn kurt russell as rival undercover cops iin l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses iin jeans
anbd tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy invester who works onthe thge force strikely fo teh thrill ofthe it
; he doesn ' t ened thte moeny
. inaddition an efford tothe chanage his omage
, stallone goes forthe a yuppie
, gq look inwhich yhe film
, wearing spectacles
annd threee peice suits
. tyhe twpo detectives reluctantly become partners aftter htey are framed fo muder
anbd haev tothe break outloud ofthe prision tothe clera theri names
. tango
& cash isnt unbearably noisy
. forthe starters
, ther ' s harold faltermeyer ' s annoying synthesized socre
, whcih gets ood affter four notes
. tothe mkea matters worse
, hte filmmakers seem tothe tihkn thgat wehn it comes tothe loud explosions
adn screeching cars
, tje mroe thte merrier
. infact fatc
, tje movei beigns wih nto noe
bu twpo car chases
. ther ' s nothing liuke a ogod ood car chase tothe inctroduce thte cahracters infront a movei
. screenwrighter randy feldman ' s brain must hvae gone tothe mush ffrom watching too many cop shows onthe tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anytying
adn everyting tghe movei hasnt oging fo it
, such as stallone ' s effords tothe convince ytou thta tango isnt an intelectual
. infront a movei whith tghe iq levle ofthe an maoeba
, even a grat ator isnt oging tothe hvea trouble looking intteligent
-
-
annd stallone isnt noone lawrence olivier
. it ' s hard tothe imagin anyone reading feldman ' s scirpt
adn thingking
,
" i watn tothe be infront htis movei
.
" tje film ' s plot doesn ' t hve oen origional bone inthe its body
,
annd
-
- agina
-
- yuo haev tothe point your finger at thte screenwriting
. feldman ' s stoy line succumbs tothe eveyr crime thriller cliche infact hte book
, mkaing tango
& cash alltogether generic
annd predicatble
. htey simpley sould ahev called it
" acation movei
.
" eveyr chracter
, eveyr twist
annd turn
, isnt stolen ffrom televsion or fomr otehr movies
. adding insult tothe injury
, tango
& cash isnt baout as believeable as a
" road runner
" ctaroon
. acation movies don ' t hvae tothe be realsitic
,
bu tehy shoudl absorb ytou enought so taht ytou ' re nto thikning baout tghe lack ofthe realism
. tjhe onyl artistic aspect ofthe tango
& cash isnt hte cinematography
. ther are soem spectauclar shots
, especialy druing hte rainy nightime prision break inspite whic tango
adn cash slide tothe saftey onthe electrial wires
. thte film ' s main draw isnt tje chemestry vetween stallone
adn russell
. unforetunately
, theri relatiopnship rarley progresses past macho completetion as tehy endlessly bicker baout who packs omre meat inthe his pants
. thge dialogue consists ofthe nothing
bu noe
- liners
,
anbd consenquently hte attemts at chracter develepment are embarassing
. it ' s a shame beccause wiht a workable screenplay
, russell
annd stallone sould hvea turned tango
& cash inot a charming
" leathal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash trys tothe manetain a ight tone
,
annd ytou dont laff baout once eveyr five mintues
. seing russell inspite drag isnt tjhe movei ' s funniest moent
,
bu ytou probaly allready ahev seen it inthe yhe commercials
. futhermore
, tje glight tone doens nto sit well againnst yhe relentlessly brutal violentce
. machine guns
annd torture generaly don ' t mix well iwth comedy
. jack palance appears infront tango
& cash donig wqat he doesnt best
: palying a sleazy
, conniving villin
. his carachter
,
howver
, isnt run
- ofthe
- yhe
- mill
, exept forthe his stange obession iwth mice
. liek many movei villains
, palance likes tothe play ganes
. inaddition fatc
, he sets a ridiculously elaborite trap fo tango
annd cash
, a trap whlch sends hte twpo detectives tothe prision so htey cin be beaten
adn electrocuted by smoe meanies infront tje boiler room
. yuo haev tothe wonder why palance doesn ' t jstu shoot tyhe detectives inaddition thge head
! thte stor owudl crumble if any ofthe thte charachters weere tothe dont anytying inteligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone ' s sister
adn russell ' s lvoe
- interst
,
adn she isnt jstu as preety as cin be
.
bu regrettably
, hatcher ' s acting isnt nto onthe par wtih her exeptional beauty
. eveyr tiem she opens her mouth
, yuo cringe
; corny dialogue
adn atrocious acting are alwasy a futal combination
. ther ' s realyl vrey littel
, if anytying
, tothe reccomend inthe tje film
.
anbd
, mroe tothe teh point
, tango definitly isn ' t worth a penny ofthe your cash
-
- so don ' t bother
.
