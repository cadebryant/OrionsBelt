. kevin must somehow confront milton
anbd thwart whatever diablical plan he hasnt infront stoer
.
bu how dont yuo defeat teh devil

? dont filmmakers raelly beleave tyhat
" normal
" courtroom drama doesn ' t ift tjhe bill
annd tehy haev tothe juice them uv
? tyhe courtroom scenes inaddition thsi movei owudl never hapen iin a rela courtroom
, hwihc wouldn ' t hvae beeen too bad if it weren ' t keanu reeves trying tothe pul it off
. i give reeves credit fo trying hard
,
bu thoughout thge movei i never saw hte kevin lomax charactor
, jstu an actr trying vyer hard tothe play kevin lomax
annd comming uv short
. charlize theron defines tje term
" over
- tjhe
- top
" infact her peformance as mary ann lomax
, a dissapointment inspite contrast tothe her ogod peformance infact
" 2 dyas inaddition tje vallay
"
. tjhe onyl ogod peformance infront teh movei isnt by al pacino
,
bu i kept asking mysef waht teh heck he wass donig inspite tihs mess

anbd ytou cin tell he isnt haveing funn doign so
,
bu his skill as an atcor cannnot savve tje poore performances
adn lacklustre scirpt tyhat suround him
. it ' s preety standart sutff
, inlcuding tjhe fatc thast tyhe hotshot lawyer appears tothe be hte onyl competant person onthe tyhe planet who cin dont anytying right inthe thge courtroom
. please read noone furhter if ytou dont nto whant tje endig spoiled
,
bu i ahev tothe git something off ofthe my chest
. infront 1986 i rember watching a movei called
" wisdom
" wiht emilio estevez
adn demi moore
,
adn thte endig ofthe thyat film doed yhe worst possibile thnig thyat a movei sould dont
. waht i liuke tothe call
" guess whta
, it wass all a dream
" senarreo
. iin
" wisdom
" hte twpo lead charachters are killed at teh end
, onyl tothe hvae oen ofthe thte charactors
" wake uv
" ffrom an apparant
adn sday
" gosh

. well
, yhe smae thnig happens inwhich
" thte devels advocate
"
,
annd
allthough arguements coudl be made surounding whther it ws actualyl a dream
( perphas milton whent bakc inspite tiem tothe try a diferrent route forthe his plan
, usance it failed
adn he isnt tghe devil
)
,
bu tghe point isnt tht hte lastest 90
% ofthe thge film didn ' t hppen
. i knwo it ' s a strech
, affter all it isnt a movei
annd nothing relaly hapened
,
bu i jstu git anoyed tothe git toyed witht liek thgat
. ofthe course
, tje dream endig sould allmost be forgiven if tyhe stroy thgat preceeds it wass at least an intresting oen

.
" teh devil ' s advocate
