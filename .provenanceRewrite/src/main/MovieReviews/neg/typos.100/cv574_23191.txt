annd fiels onyl liuke an hour
.
" tje hwole nine yards
" isnt an ultimatly unsatisfying
annd empty
- headed excursion inot well
- worn terrain alreday setted by far superior picturesk
. how tghe casted
, most ofthe hwihc are respectable actors
, got caught uv inaddition such a cliched
, defishant film rimaniss a mistery
, unless tehy throught it might aspire tothe match tghe congenial screwball zaniness ofthe directer lynn ' s 1985 comedy clasic
,
" clue
: hte movei
.
" gonig inot tghe theather
, preliminary comparisions bewteen hte twpo movies weere unavoidable
,
bu by teh twenty
- minute mark
, whn i hadnt chuckled once
anbd laughed nary a single tiem
, it ws claer htis prodcution wass iin sereous trouble
. usance tjhe entire runnung tiome depends onthe yhe mechanisms ofthe hte plot
,
adn thte screenplay
, inauspiciously wroten by mitchell kapner
, collapses iwth eveyr failing
" comedy
" bited
, thte film isnt an inevitible dead zone inspite hte way ofthe substace
annd
, frequentily
, enteratinment value
.
" tjhe hwole nine yards
" isnt niether fascitious nor
, asside fomr tje subplot baout jill ' s shocking eagerness tothe become a proffesional hitwoman
, inventive
,
adn moreso oftenly thna nto
, jsut lies htere
, hte film spinning drearily aroud
annd aroud infront yhe projector
,
bu never igniting any sort ofthe spark
. a faw select actors dont whta htey cxan wiht tghe material
, hwile others amking noone inpact at all
. onthe tjhe medioker side are actaully thsoe palying teh twpo central cahracters
: matthew perry
adn bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable onthe tv ' s
" firends
,
" plays tjhe smae excact sitcom
- stlye charcter iin all ofthe his movies
( fomr 1997 ' s
" fuls rush inaddition
" tothe 1999 ' s
" threee tothe tango
"
)
,
anbd it hasnt become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makse enxt tothe noone impression
,
annd beacuse ofthe thte limited guise ofthe his jimmy
" thte tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes dissappears inot yhe backround
. theri threee female counterparts fare noticably better
. best ofthe all isnt natasha henstridge
, far moreso radiant tahn inthe thte exploititive
" speices
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth
annd emotion tothe cynthia
. henstridge hasnt thte talent
, fo sure
, tothe break outloud ofthe theese countless throwaway roles
,
bu frist she must fier her agent
. amanda peet hasnt a lot ofthe funn as yhe quirkily straightforward
adn giddy jill
,
adn seems tothe nkwo omre baout tghe art ofthe commedic payoff thna even perry who
, thus far
, hasnt strived onthe a carreer based soley onthe comedy
. it isnt too bad
,
thne
, thta peet isnt unnecesarily asked tothe disrobe iin a climactic scene
, witht thte obvious sole purpose bieng tothe sohw off her breasts
. fianlly
, rosanna arquette isnt awful as sophie
,
bu something tells me taht ws her purpose
,
adn her claer overacting onyl aids inwhich brightening uv her limited screen timne
. alsot popping uv isnt michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination fo his role inwhich
" thge gren mile
,
" as jimmy ' s largley builded freind
anbd fellow killer
, frankie figs
. whn
" thge wohle nine yards
" eventally sputters tothe its underwhelming conclusion
, oney isnt left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a graet deel ofthe movies ofthe htis tipe hvea beeen made inaddition teh past
,
adn htis oen isnt nothing
bu a duplication ofthe better films
, so whta wass hte point
? wihtout a passable screenplay or any noteable technical acomplishments
,
" hte hwole nine yards
" rests souly onthe hte presumed charm ofthe tghe casted
,
anbd half ofthe yhe actors are nto charming at all
. nowe
, wqat doens taht tell yuo
