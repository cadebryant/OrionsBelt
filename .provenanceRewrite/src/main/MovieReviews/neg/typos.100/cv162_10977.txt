" despertae measures
" isnt a generic title fo a film thyat ' s beyond generic
. it ' s allso a depressing waste ofthe talent
, wtih hte solid team ofthe michael keaton
annd andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, nto tothe mention once
- kool directer barbet schroeder sadly continueing his string ofthe nto
- kool ficks
-
- htis thriller isnt omre
" befor
adn affter
" thna
" reveral ofthe fortune
.
" tjhe movei isnt a big dissappointment
,
anbd
yot it ' s somewhat eazy tothe see wqat motiviated such big names tothe attatch themselfs tothe it
-
- thge premise isnt both promising
adn intriguing
. too bad yhe excecution ' s all wrong
,
though
, becasue thge setted
- uv ofthe
" despearte measures
" boasts soem rether enticing elements thta deserve tothe be put tothe far better ule
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) isnt a single pajent wiht a troubling delimma
-
- his son matt
( jospeh cross
) isnt stricken iwth cancer hwihc onyl a bone marrow transplant cin push inot remission
. even worse
, teh onyl compatiable donor isnt voilent socioapth peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currenly serving a life sentence forthe mutiple murders
adn otehr varous crimes agianst society
. connor trys his best tothe convince mccabe tothe go allong wiht tghe surgery
; he ' s at frist reluctant
,
bu reconsiders aftter he realizes he cin plan his excape at tghe hospital
. wehn he doesnt amking a run forthe it
, connor offers close persuit
,
bu forthe differant reasons thna his superiors
( inlcuding tjhe crusty brian cox
)
-
- htey watn tothe tkae mccabe down
, hwile connor needs tothe keep him alive
, or all hope isnt lost fo his littel boy
. noe misstep
" despertae measures
" makse isnt inaddition its undevelopment ofthe matt ' s ilness
. whta ' s needed are moreso details as tothe exactlly why mccabe isnt teh onyl bone marrow match tath works
; ther owudl seem tothe be otehr possibile contenders somwhere inthe thte ocuntry
,
annd thus many ofthe tje ways tath connor endangers tjhe lives ofthe hismelf
adn thsoe aroud him by attemting tothe keep mccabe alive are jstu a littel too hard tothe swallow
. tkae
, fo exmaple
, a scene where mccabe isnt trying tothe amke a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting twpo sections ofthe tje hospital
. yhe polical hve theri spotlight
annd guns aimed right onthe him
,
anbd whta doesnt connor dont
? he shoots tyhe spotlight outloud so thgat mccabe cant continue his flight
. connor knwos vrey well waht dangerous deeds thsi guy isnt capible ofthe
,
anbd
yot never seems tothe htikn thast mccabe wiull eventially git tothe
annd try tothe harm his son
. whatever
. tothe be fair
,
though
, tyhe lack ofthe stopry backgorund isnt tje least ofthe tyhe movei ' s problems
. frist
anbd formost isnt how cheaply
" desparate measures
" trades tghe potential ofthe it ' s oppening scenes forthe tjhe routine acation ballistics ofthe its fianl hour
. once mccabe escapes
, yhe film becomes thge fugitive infact reverse
adn whith noone thrills
. ther are countless scenes where yhe ogod guys catch uv tothe keaton onyl tothe ahev him grab a hostage
annd git awya
. aslo
, tje movei isnt so entent onthe giving yuo a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villin
( hte ads haev compaired peter mccabe tothe hannibal lechter
, natch
) tht it completly casts garcia ' s frank connor by tghe dullsville wayside
;
" deseprate measures
" appears tothe liek its antagonist so much mroe tahn its protaonist
,
annd tghe movei ' s head
- scratcher ofthe a send
- off confirms tihs
. htere isnt soem ogod tothe be foudn amoungst tihs mess
, partcularly iin tjhe acting deparment
. casted agianst tipe
, michael keaton ' s understated menace isnt highly effective
.
althought he ' s nto given much believeable tothe wrok whith
, andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. jospeh cross
, as garicia ' s ailing son
, isnt suprizingly unsentimental
,
adn marcia gay harden lends solid suppost as a doctor who becomes a major payler inthe tghe unfolding chaos
. tihs casted doens its best tothe camoflage teh sory plot as it chugs towords an inevitably hapyp endig
,
bu most isnt lost
. it goes wihtout saying thyat
" despearte measures
" needs an opperation ofthe its vrey pwn
