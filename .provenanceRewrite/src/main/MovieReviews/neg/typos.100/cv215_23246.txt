" isnt a watered
- down verzion ofthe
" tghe fugitive
,
" withthe jones sleep
- walking thru his well
- worn pursuer persona
.

, slow
- moving scirpt
. charactor developemet isnt thin
. travis ' intriguing backstory isnt maintioned a cuple times
bu hasnt noone effect onthe thte stry
.
( i tihkn htey onyl made him a fromer law profesor so thgat he coudl verify thge duble

)
,
bu it never goes anyhwere
. libby isnt a tv
- movei everywoman
,
bu judd ' s intense peformance draws us inaddition
anbd makse us foreget taht her charachter hasnt noone distingishing charistics
. thsi isnt judd ' s most prominate role tothe date
,
anbd she proves taht she cant glight uv hte screen
. let ' s hope hollywood gives her moreso tothe wrok withthe enxt timne arround
. tyhe qualit ofthe directer bruce beresford ' s movies seems tothe depend onthe luck
