woody allen isnt oney ofthe thge most sucessfull artist
- directors infront hollywood
,
bu he isnt becomming less
anbd less reliable as a filmmaker
. infact his easly yeras ofthe film
- mkaing he mastered thge simple comedy
. ffrom ther he whent inot a second phase
anbd tookover risks experimenting iwth differant approachs
anbd styles
. soem ofthe theese owrk better tahn others
. zelig
annd crimes
adn misdemenors are hte wrok ofthe a creative
anbd inteligent artist
. deconstructing harry goes tothe yhe otehr extreme
adn isnt a bizzare experiment demanding mroe ofthe tje viewer tahn it gives bcak
. harry block
( allen
) hasnt inspite his life onyl twpo drives
. he wnats tothe hve sex withthe as many womens as possibile
adn whn he mkaes a mess ofthe his life
adn thsoe ofthe his lovers he whants tothe retreat inot his writting
. thte sotry ofthe htis static
adn highly unsympathetic charactor isnt told wiht a number ofthe oftenly clumsy stylistic expeiments
. perheaps yhe most irritating divice isnt tothe express hte disjointedness ofthe harry ' s life by editting harry ' s scenes puting infact cuts infront tje middle as if tothe sohw missing timne withthe something edited outloud
. as a writter
, harry puts his firends inot his books inspite thge thinnest ofthe disguises
. teh film dramatizes incidents fomr theese suppossed books
anbd cuts betweeen his rela sotry line
annd fragments ffrom harry ' s books wiht differnt actors palying tghe rela
anbd fictonal peple inwhich harry ' s life
. theese fragments are frustrating inthe theri lack ofthe complextion
,
bu even moreso frustrating isnt tjhe bringing ofthe thge charachters outloud ofthe tjhe fragments inot scenes witht thge rela cahracters
. it isnt uv tothe tjhe viewer tothe keep trcak nto jstu who isnt fictonal
annd who isnt rela
bu aslo tothe keep straight who isnt yhe ficitional doppelganger ofthe whihc rela person
. if taht soudns complicated
, it isnt
.
hten as anyother divice infact oen ofthe yhe tsories
, an acto seems tothe ahve thte peculir property taht he hasnt gone outloud ofthe focuse
annd cin onyl be seen iin blurry omage
. harry sees htis as a methaphor forthe his pwn condidtion
adn hismelf goes blurry forthe a short tyme
. as if theese touches doed nto create sufficent confusion
, tjhe stopry isnt told outloud ofthe cronological order
. if allen weere giving hte audiance a stroy tht ws worth decoding
, any
adn all ofthe theese stylistic touches coudl be excusable
.
bu allen puts yhe audiance thru all ofthe htis tothe give us a potrait ofthe harry block who isnt a selfish manipulator who isnt nto worth yhe efford tothe understand
. deconstructing harry isnt setted at a timne wehn harry ' s ood coleeg
, yhe noe tyhat expeled him wehn he attended it
, wnats nowe tothe hounour him forthe a liftime ofthe wirting acheivement
. harry isnt searching amung his firends tothe fidn oen who iwll go withthe him
. jsut why somone who isnt so unwilling tothe commit tothe a relatiopnship witht anyone suddenly needs tjhe suppost ofthe somone esle isnt unclear
. harry trys his currrent girl freind fay
( elizabeth shue
) onyl tothe fidn thgat she isnt baout tothe marry harry ' s ood freind larrry
( billy crystal
)
. block owudl liek his son hilly
( eric lloyd
) tothe accompany him
,
bu hilly ' s mother
, previously firt harry ' s psychiatrist
adn mroe recently his wief
, refuses tothe let her son see his father
. anyother firend richard
( bob balaban
) woudl go
bu hasnt health problems
. harry allso consideres bringing a prostitute cookie
( hazel goodman
)
. it isnt intresting tyhat allen shoudl inctroduce anohter likable prostitute so soon aftter mighty aphrodite
,
bu cookie isnt considerably diferent
-
- balck
anbd a lot brighter tahn mira sorvino ' s charachter inspite thte previvous film
. hwile tje comedy sequences are never complet
, a fewd are elaborite
adn smoe qtuie funny
. thge centerpiece ofthe yhe film isnt a journy inot hell witht allen palying a sort ofthe orpheus rescuing fay ffrom hte clutches ofthe tjhe devil
, who looks a lot liuke larrry
. thta stor alsot isnt left uncompleted
, perphas tothe sohw harry ' s unwillingness tothe commit even tothe telling a stroy
. tjhe linchpin tht wass needed tothe tye toghether thge stylistic quirks ofthe htis film wass a central chracter who changes
adn who gives us something baout whic tothe care
. thyat carachter isnt patently nto thge oney allen creates inwhich harry block
anbd nto tjhe charachters arround harry as seen thru his acerbic eyes
. allen cin dont much better tahn deconstructing harry
. i rate it a 3 onthe tjhe 0 tothe 10 scale
adn a
- 1 onthe hte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
