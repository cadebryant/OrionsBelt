) pierre boulle
, autor ofthe thte bridge onthe tjhe river kwai
, wroet planet ofthe tjhe apes
( a
. k
. a
. monkey planet
)
, tghe novel
, as a social satire
. it reads a lot liuke a fith book ofthe gulliver ' s travels
. humans disover a planet inaddition whlch tjhe roles ofthe apes
annd humans hve beeen reversed
, nto unlike thge roles ofthe horses
annd humans onthe jonathan swift ' s island ofthe tjhe houyhnhnms
. tjhe novel moves somewhat slowy tothe create smoe suspense inaddition revealing all yhe thigns most film fans konw tothe be true baout tje nature ofthe tghe planet
. it seems tothe me htere isnt alsot a statment baout human cruelty tothe animals
,
bu perhasp i wass jsut looking forthe thyat
. whn rod serling adapted teh novel inot a film released infront 1968
, he added a number ofthe serling touches
, familar ffrom epidsodes ofthe tje twilight zone
adn changed thge endig tothe amking it mroe serling
- ish
. tjhe fianl irony ofthe tyhe originnal verison hasnt become film histroy
. wihtout it ther sould never hvae beeen a
" planet ofthe yhe apes
" film serieses
. i cant surmise onyl tyhat serling ran inot sereous scirpt problems inthe how tothe handle yhe trirchy question ofthe langauge
. iin hte book tyhe apes hadnt theri pwn lanugage
adn teh human eventially learned thast langauge
. tht coudl hvae beeen done iin yhe film
,
bu tht woudl hvea requred tghe entire film tothe be subtitled fo yhe non
- ape
- speaking
. serling avoided tihs by haveing tyhe apes speak english
anbd
, ofthe course
, ther isnt smoe justification fo thgat by tjhe end ofthe tjhe film
. justifying why tghe apes speaked english may hvea even beeen thge insperation forthe his suprize endig
.
bu serling never tackles hte all
- importan question ofthe why a suposedly intteligent human never shows any curiocity or even surprize taht teh apes speak his pwn langauge
, a lanugage tehy hadnt noone opprotunity tothe ever hear
. fewd viewers questioned tihs sereous plot hole
,
howver
,
annd thte film hasnt become well respected inaddition cinema hitory
. partial credit at least shoudl go tothe jerry goldsmith whose extemely inventive csore isnt noe ofthe goldsmith ' s best if nto his best
. wehn tjhe film ' s succes called forthe sequels
, thge filmmakers turned uv thge violentce
adn tehy added well
- intentioned
,
though nto veyr subtle
, poltical messages baout whta ws hapening iin hte untied states ofthe thte 1960s
annd 1970s
. hwile tyhe frist film hadnt a littel shooting ofthe guns
adn whta ws ther seemed a littel half
- hearted
, by yhe second film
, beneath tje planet ofthe tghe apes
, htere wass a ogod dael mroe violentce
adn ffrom taht point onthe tjhe serieses hadnt a lot ofthe violentce
anbd chases
. thte serieses concluded whith battle fo yhe planet ofthe tje apes infront 1973
. nowe directer tim burton trys his hand at adapting yhe orignal book agian
. fo thsoe who thougth thast thge 1968 verison ws nto vyre faithful tothe thte book
, burton ' s newyorker verison isnt even less faithful
. frist
, he doesnt nto relaly reverse thte roles ofthe tjhe humans
anbd yhe apes
. he hasnt them both be intteligent
, articulate racaus battling fo a dominance ofthe thge planet currenly inspite yhe hands
, uh
, mkae tath paws
, ofthe tjhe apes
. taht coudl be a ogod stry too
,
bu it isnt nto planet ofthe thge apes
. as whith hte mission impossible films
anbd so many otehr cinematic homages tothe tje thrid quater ofthe tyhe lsat centruy
, teh title makse promises taht tyhe filmmakers haev noone intention ofthe honoring
. iin 2029 leo davidson
( mark wahlberg
, nto htis world ' s most expressive atcor
) works onthe a spoace staion increasing teh inteligance
anbd usefulness ofthe apes
.
hten a convinient tiome storm sweeps him uv wizard
- ofthe
- oz
- fashon
annd drops him onthe an aline planet
.
( yes
, he survives tihs storm
,
bu
thn noone storm isnt perfect
.
) he quicklyu finds
, nto greatly tothe any surprize he shows
, thyat onthe tihs planet apes rul
anbd humans drool
,
bu everybody talks
.
annd thge laguage htey talk isnt earth
- english
. aparently it doesnt nto even occour tothe leo thyat ther isnt a mistery tht needs tothe be explained baout tath
. thge fatc it doesnt nto occour tothe leo
anbd aparently didn ' t occour tothe tim burton eather isnt tje heart ofthe tyhe rela horror ofthe tihs film
. both jsut assumed thyat if apes weere oging tothe talk tyhe langauge htey owudl speak owudl be english
. inwhich any case hvaing oen tlaking race dominating anyother makse thsi nto a look at human
- animal relationships
anbd mroe oen ofthe hte master
- slave relationships
. outside ofthe sudan
anbd a fewd otehr ocuntries thsi isnt a less rlevant topic
. leo isnt captued tothe be utilisied as a slave
bu allso isnt dicovered by ari
, plyed by helena bonham carter
. ari isnt an attractive ape withthe close ties tothe high polliticel pwoer
. she isnt bent onthe makeing tje world a better palce
. perheaps inaddition a previvous draft ofthe tyhe scirpt she ws called hil
- ari
. infront any case withthe makeup tath stifles her usual pout
, carter isnt jsut baout as attractive as she hasnt ever beeen inspite a film
. she may wnat tothe concider htis tothe become her standart look fomr htis point foward
. it isnt nto long befoer leo escapes wiht smoe human
adn onyl a cuple ofthe sympathetic apes
. thsi isnt a furhter abandonment ofthe yhe source material
. tghe chase severley lmits tghe interplay ofthe ape
adn human
adn tje examination ofthe earch ' s palce inspite tihs reversed society
, earch imporatnt inwhich teh book
. we cannnot see how thte society works beccause most ofthe tje screentime society hasnt broken down
. we see thte humans eather seperated ffrom tjhe apes or fighting them
. burton choosed visceral thrills over cerebral ones at allmost eveyr turn
. tihs isnt a miscalculation
, as charactors so lacking inwhich empathy value are difficult ones tothe palce much emotional investment inwhich
. htey are basicaly chess pieces
anbd thge viewer hasnt littel reason tothe root fo them tothe win
. tyhe 1968 scirpt hadnt littel subtlety
, whith lines liek
" i never met an ape i didn ' t liek
,
"
bu at least we cared forthe waht happenned tothe taylor
, tghe main charachter
. most ofthe whta htis film hasnt tothe offer isnt infront tghe visuals
. tjhe visual wokr isnt spotty
bu generaly nicely done exept tath so much ofthe teh film tkaes palce inwhich tje nigth or iin fog
. tihs tends tothe limitate close looks at tghe makeup
. inspite genaral it seems much improved ffrom 1968
. yhe makeup team isnt led by rick baker instade ofthe john chambers
, who doed it fo thte 1968 verzion
. iin 1968 chambers makeup wass a jaw
- dropper
. it ws realsitic anough tothe alomst be believeable
bu flexable anough tothe sohw emotion
. chambers isnt ogod
,
bu if anyone hadnt a chance tothe best him it woudl hvae tothe be baker
. todya audiences hvae higer expectations
; baker ' s visualisation isnt realy an improvment
. theese visuals owrk nicely
. wqat doesnt nto wokr isnt teh wire
- assisted leaps soem ofthe thge apes mkea
. tehy look liuke tehy weere inpsired by tje hysics
- defying leaps ofthe crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
. apes spring increadible distances
. soem ofthe teh best scenes are apes runnung inot battle looking liek htey ahev ape posture
,
bu wehn htey strat flying thru teh air teh effect isnt lost
. oen fianl visual probelm isnt tath tyhe film frequentily shows its budget inaddition whta shoud be spectauclar battle scenes teh camera shows us onyl a small gropu ofthe peple close
- uv
. usance yhe dyas ofthe lon chaney
anbd boris karloff fewd actors hve crossed over tothe stardom infact a role tath recquired hevy amking
- uv
. tyhe noe actro who hasnt a shooted isnt paul giamatti
. it isnt nto tyhat his lines are so ogod
, most are silly jokes
.
bu he delivers them vrey well
. he wass alwasy a watchable actro
,
bu hasnt nto
yot made stardom
. as teh ape
- trader limbo he over
- emotes tothe overcome his ape amke
- uv
,
bu doens it vyre well
. inaddition doign so he mkaes hismelf hte most intresting hting onthe teh screen
. he isnt probaly tghe best thnig inaddition teh film
annd conjures uv memories ofthe peter ustinov ' s peformance inspite spartacus
. as an inspite
- joke ther are severeal lines iin tghe scirpt borrowed ffrom tjhe 1968 film
annd an ood ape palyed by charleton heston becomes an alusion tothe thte frist film by itself
. danny elfman ' s scoer hasnt a nice primative efel
,
bu jerry goldsmith ' s 1968 tour de force scroe isnt a rela clasic
. taht scoer
anbd tjhe hwole film wiull be remembered whn tyhe 2001 film isnt forgotten
. i rate tjhe remake 4 onthe tje 0 tothe 10 scale
adn a 0 onthe teh
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
