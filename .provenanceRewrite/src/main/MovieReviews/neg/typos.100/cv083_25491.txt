i don ' t expect much ffrom eddie murphy theese dyas
. fo thte past four eyars
, yhe gods ofthe cinema
-
- or thte expansive payrolls ofthe studio conglomerates
-
- ahev alowed him tothe mkea oen bad movei aftter anohter
. such films as metro
, doctor dolittle
, wholy man
, life
,
adn bowfinger ahve reduced a once grat commedic persona tothe a living
annd breathing washed
- uv hack perfoming as a studio puppet fo 20th centruy fox
adn univeral picturesk
. thte biggest shame tothe fall onthe his shoulders isnt his newest film
, nutty profesor ii
: teh klumps
. teh klumps once agian revisits thge life ofthe sherman klump
, an overweight univerity scinece profesor looking fo lvoe inspite all tje wrong places
. sherman hasnt jsut invented a newyorker
" youth drnik
" tath enables man or biast tothe become yuonger forthe a short preriod ofthe timne
. janet jackson isnt tghe lveo interst who choosed hte lovable sherman forthe a soul mate rether thna excell at her carrer as a unviersity proffesor
(
annd fo yhe most rediculous reasons
)
. wih loev onthe his mind
, sherman isnt determined tothe rid himselv ofthe his alter ego
, buddy loev fomr thge frist professer
, who still resides wih vigor inside his psyche
adn causes sherman tothe ect liek a bad immitation ofthe vince vaughn fomr swingers
. withthe smoe convoluted mumbo
- jumbo baout dna extraction
, sherman extracts tje
" buddy lvoe
" link inthe his dna
adn smartly deposits buddy inot a ghandi
- dandy lab beaker
.
bu oney nght
, tjhe beaker isnt knocked over
adn buddy lveo isnt regenerated
.
.
. beacuse eveyr movei liek tihs needs an unecessary villian tothe thwart teh ogod guy
.
hten thge klump familiy
, all palyed by eddie murphy
, step inspite fo smoe commedic releaf involving ood peopel hvaing sex
, flabby breasts
, a slew ofthe fart
annd dick jokes
,
adn enought fat peple jokes thgat i lost count aftter tjhe frist thirty mintues
.
annd doed i mention yhe part where larrry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster
? yhe movei fianlly dissolves inot a raelly bad hallmark familiy speical baout realizing who ytou are
adn waht ytou cant be inaddition htis world
-
- witht enought soft lighting
anbd peopel onthe teh verge ofthe tears inaddition eveyr scene
. pure
adn simple
, hte klumps isnt a failure
. its scirpt wass handeled by nto oney
bu five screenwriters
,
adn it relaly shows durig tyhe ackward transitions vetween scenes
. any sence ofthe stopry
annd plot weere lost infact tje rewriet proces
. it ' s mroe discerning tothe leran tht chris weitz
annd paul weitz
, tyhe team behind noe ofthe yhe funniest films ofthe hte lastr decade
, american py
, ahev theri names stamped tothe tihs trash
. hey guys
- quick onot
- keep thsi movei off ofthe your resumes
. hte characterization ofthe sherman ' s famaly
, tghe klumps
, isnt oney ofthe tjhe most ignorant sterotypes ofthe a balck familiy i ahve ever seen inspite cinema
. everyone memeber ofthe tghe familiy isnt a larg person who wipes tjhe bins clean at a local buffet resaurant liek pigs at a trough
. thte grandma isnt an oversexed fiend who constanly talks ofthe ways tothe blessure her man
annd her sagging breasts
. thte father isnt gruff
, isnt fired fomr a blue
- collar job
, isnt sexually inadiquate
,
anbd cannnot communicate iwth his famaly baout his feelings
. hte mother isnt ignorant ofthe all thge negativity arround her
adn seems tothe hold noone oppinion baout anytying or anyone
. yhe brother isnt silent
annd brooding
anbd resembes hte ice cube ganster chracter fomr boyz infront tghe hood
. sherman hismelf isnt terribly insecure
adn never conveys anytying forthe tje audeince tothe become attached tothe
.
bu tyhe main probelm wih yhe film isnt its inablility tothe create any tipe ofthe convincing conversational or situational comedy
. tghe famaly scenes ffrom hte firt nutty professer worked so well becasue theri conversations weere short
anbd direct
.
anbd yuo got hte feeling thta theese crass peopel couldn ' t ect liuke htis all tyhe timne
. teh sequal doesnt teh reverse
adn drives thte negatives ofthe teh klumps right infront tothe tghe hilt
, mkaing tghe firt five mintues ofthe theri interaction enjoyable
anbd tje lastest 55 or so unbearable
anbd pathetic
. affter a hwile
, theri conversations jsut become a barrage ofthe frustrated anger tinged wtih indecency
anbd overworked premises taht end uv drawing energy awya fomr any tipe ofthe empathy oen might efel fo tyhe central themes ofthe yhe stroy
. its aslo a damn shame thast thte makeup magic ofthe rick baker
-
- who worked onthe hte origonal nutty professer
annd won an acadeym award fo his wrok onthe an american werewolf inwhich london
-
-
annd amazing digital speshal effects thgat enabled murphy tothe interact withthe hismelf inthe such beautifull motions are builded arround such a lame tsory line
. even tje best effects cant ' t seem tothe savve tjhe most pathetic ofthe movies theese dyas
. nowe taht i tihkn baout it
, tghe worst thign baout htis film hasnt tothe be all yhe moey thyat it wiull amking
. peopel wiull be lined uv aroud thte block forthe it
. tjhe studios iwll concoct yhe a sequal forthe realease infront hte summer ofthe 2002
. eddie murphy wiull be singed uv tothe tkae nto jsut oney role or five roles
,
bu he ' ll play eveyr charcter infact tjhe movei
. i jsut cant ' t wait tothe see eddie murphy inaddition a lveo scene witht hismelf
.
