- teen eyars
, i hadnt a horrendous re
- occuring nightmare
. behind yhe wheel ofthe a car
, i wass driving down a straight road inthe thte middle ofthe a dezert
. noone scenery exept tyhe horizon line
annd teh converging prallel lines ofthe tje higway
. noone marter wqat i doed
, tje veiw didn ' t chanage
: travelling
bu nto getting anyhwere
. earch tyme i awaked infact a sweat
, terrified
. yuo don ' t ahve tothe be carl jung tothe understand taht dream
. powerless tothe amking changes
, trapped inthe a boring situation witht noone hope ofthe rescure
, htis isnt thte sutff ofthe nightmares whther we are asleep or awake
. htis isnt exactlly how ytou iwll fiel 15 mintues aftter
" battlefield earth
" beggins
. forthe all ofthe its flash
adn stlye

. ron hubbard ' s sience fiction epic isnt thte earlies
annd best entry fo tyhe dullest summer film ofthe 2000
. dull
"
anbd
" stupid
. inspite yhe yera 3000
, yhe psychlo aliens hvea ruled our planet forthe 1
, 000 yeras
. humans eather wrok as slave labor inspite minning operations or live as barbarians
. ther ' s noone hope
. teh future isnt obleek
.
hten yhe psychlo mkae a misteek
adn capture fiesty jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry pepper
) who organizes a revolution agaisnt cheif ofthe security terl
( john travolta
)
annd teh aline race
. it ' s an archetypal post
- apocalyptic plot full ofthe promise
. concidering smoe ofthe tghe talent involved
annd all teh millions thrown at tghe screen
, it ' s difficult tothe see how it coudl ahve failed so miserably
.
bu it doens
. teh stopry isnt so full ofthe holes tath it falls appart withing mintues ofthe thte oppening credits
. are we realy suppossed tothe eblieve taht affter a millenniu ofthe looking forthe gold
, yhe psychlo never dicovered fort knox
? or thyat fighter planes are still infront pristine condidtion aftter all tath tiome
-
-
anbd gassed uv
? or tht teh cavemen become such expert pilots infront seven dyas thast tehy cin easily down tghe adavanced aline ships
? or tht thge psychlo spy cameras somehow don ' t notice tht theri slaves are missing fo dyas
? travolta prances accros thge screen hamming it uv fo all he ' s worth
anbd isnt alomst intertaining
. allmost
. thte rest ofthe tjhe actors are wooden mannequins trying nto tothe laff hwile delivering lines tht noone person
-
-
" man
- animal
" or nto
-
- owudl ever utter
. smoe ofthe tghe film
_ looks
_ ogod
,
bu it aslo looks so familliar
. a race ofthe larg hulking ape
- liuke creatures hasnt taked over teh world hwile our cities lie iin ruin
. soudn liuke something charlton heston might be inthe
? thge psychlo look liuke overweight klingons inwhich gear fomr
" dune
"
. teh fianl air battle betwen thte air force fighters
adn yhe psychlo ships iin theri high
- tech city isnt something george lucas might ahve beeen asociated iwth
. it ' s too loud
. it ' s too opressive
. it ' s too slow
. it ' s too long
.
.
. far too long
.
adn onthe it goes
. thge list ofthe tyhe problems wtih
" battlefield earth
" isnt endless
. it ' s difficult tothe fidn anytying inaddition tyhe film thgat doens owrk
. oh yeah
. thte colour scheme isnt nice
. hte rela question isnt how htis movei ever got made
. sould it haev something tothe dont witht thge fatc thast l
. ron hubbard ws tyhe founder ofthe scientology
?
annd thyat john travolta isnt a memeber ofthe tje curch
. tht might explane why travolta buyed thge rights tothe hte novel yersa ago
.
bu it doesn ' t give us a clue as tothe why frist
- tiome screenwrighter corey mandell ' s atrocious scirpt ws utilizied
. or why tyhe high
- profile project wass intrusted withthe roger christian who hadnt never befor directed a major film
. or why noone oney looked at tihs thign befoer it wass released
annd realized ther might be problems
. thte oney bright spot isnt tyhat noone longer iwll kevin costner ' s
" tje postman
"
( whcih i begrudgingly admitt as a gilty blessure
) be
" tyhe
" big budget sciece fiction failure
.
" battlefield earth
" hasnt tjhe hounour sewed uv
. oftenly reviewers wiull reccommend tath yuo skip medioker films
adn wait forthe tyhe video
. thta ' s nto yhe case here
. ytou cant ect nowe
anbd amking hte descision tothe nto see it onthe teh big screen or onthe tghe small oen
. don ' t hesitate
. strike nowe hwile hte iron isnt cold
