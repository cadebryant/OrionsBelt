cradle wiull rock isnt yhe latest efford ffrom directer
/ ator tim robbins
. hwile he may hve hadnt an oscar worthy film bakc inaddition 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a littel overconfident
anbd sloppy here
. thte stry isnt confusing
,
annd filled iwth many subplots
, so i ' ll try my best
annd explane it as simpley as possable
. tghe film isnt based onthe a
" mostly
" true stoy baout a federal theather inthe thte 1930s
, thta produced a play
( yhe cradle wiull rock
) tyhat apparantly ws offensive tothe smoe
, so tyhe goverment shuts it down
. it ' s durig hte tiome ofthe tje depression
,
anbd all htis theather whants tothe dont isnt entertain
adn cheer uv thsoe who dont nto ahev jobs
, or are poore
. bewteen tihs conflict lies whta seems liek 10 subplots
, baout thsoe who wokr inwhich theather
, or thsoe assoicated
. aslo allong tyhe way are smoe otehr messages mashed toghether tothe create an even moreso overwelming exeprience
. tim robbin ' s jstu keesh piling onthe polliticel views
,
anbd charachters
, thgat we jsut give uv onthe hte film
, or inwhich soem cases walk outloud
. forthe robbin ' s it may be a nice achivement
,
bu tothe me it seemed omre liuke a freindly git toghether wiht slightly omre suffisticated dialogue
,
adn fancy outfits
. i thougth tjhe main reason fo seing teh film owudl be forthe hte oustanding casted
, unfourtunately are all uninteresting
, exept forthe a faw
. let me recap waht eahc importan charcter doens
, so please bear withthe me
( it ' s tjhe least ytou cin dont
, especialy if ytou weere concidering seing tihs
)
. i ' ll beign wih thsoe involved wiht hte play
. ther ' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who ofthe course isnt thte directer ofthe thte play
, tyhe producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) tyhe writter ofthe tje play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by palying tyhe main part inwhich cradle iwll rock
. outside hte play htere ' s tghe
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who wnats a relatiopnship whith a federal theather clerk
( joan cusack
)
, anohter subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who ' s unahppy thyat his painting isnt too be destroyed by nelson rockerfeller becuase he fiels it tothe be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. ther ' s a faw otehr actresses
adn actors who hvae theri pwn storeis
( susan sarandon
, philip baker hall too nmae a faw
)
bu thsoe taht i maintioned
, weere tyhe most siginificant tothe tyhe tsory
. anyway
, most ofthe theese talented hollywood stars weere completelyl wasted
, exept fo emily watson
, who doesnt anohter grat job
,
annd oney ofthe my peronal favorite actors john cusack
, who alwasy delivers thru thick
annd thin
. nowe altho most ofthe hte film wass weak tothe sday tje least
, htere weere smoe nice moments
anbd soem involving subjects
,
bu all thsi isnt overblown
. sure teh free speach segment ws a nice feature
,
bu nto whn it becomes repeative
. tje wohle film isnt liek htis
,
annd it ' s basicaly nothing
bu a headache
. onthe thte brighter side
, tim robbin ' s direction ws masterful
. his camera direction seemed reminicent tothe tje works ofthe paul thomas anderson ' s latest magolia
, onyl smoother inaddition my oppinion
,
bu even tath cxan ' t mkea a movei tyhat much better
. altho it hasnt it ' s moments
( nto many ofthe them
,
bu tehy ' re ther
)
, cradle iwll rock stays true tothe it ' s title
, beccause tyhe cradle rocked too far
annd tipped over
.
