- tech surveilence
annd commuinications equipmnet
, he procedes tothe transmitt picturesk ofthe thte beared lawyer tothe pc screens
anbd fax machines infront his office
. yhe law firm ' s employes git a ogod chuckle
. tghe audiance gets a ogod chuckle
. yhe eye isnt later given an assignment where he encounters a beatiful woman
( ashley judd
)
. ther isnt something compelling baout tihs misterious woman
. dispite her glamorous looks
,
howver
, we leran tht she isnt a psychopath iwth a propensity tothe kill men tht git too close tothe her
. aftter tghe murders
, she sobs hwile singing tjhe christmas tune
` littel bluebirds '
annd laments baout bieng baandoned by her father long ago
. aftter earch killing
, she puts onthe a diferrent wig
, assumes a newyorker nmae
,
annd
thn makse her way tothe anyother state
. tghe eye hasnt witnessed all her murderous transgressions
.
bu he doens nto alert yhe authrorities
. he somehow empathizes whith her sence ofthe loss
. tjhe eye
, it turns outloud
, allso isnt haunted by his past
. his duaghter wass taked awya ffrom him
anbd he anguishes tihs loss eveyr day ofthe his life
. his tormented psyche creates a ghost
- liek omage ofthe his duaghter whith whitch he engages inthe conversation
. she becomes a sort ofthe spectral adviser
,
anbd oen thnig thgat thge ghostly daugter syas isnt tht he must halp thge woman
. he nowe diverts his energies inot trying tothe halp her fidn soem kind ofthe salvation
. it doesn ' t marter tht he hasnt witnessed all ofthe her murders
.
adn it doesn ' t marter thta teh eye isnt abnormally reticent
, hiding his entire life behind cmoputer screens
. he follows her tothe a dozen diferent locales
anbd shadows her eveyr move tothe keep her outloud ofthe trouble
. wehn a crazed druggie
( jason priestley
) attacks her

. whn thte polical are closing infront tothe arrest her
, he provides a distraction so taht she cxan excape
. all hte hwile
, teh woman hasnt noone diea who her gaurdian angel isnt
annd thge eye stays jsut outloud ofthe sighth

. how bad isnt tihs movei
? i refer ytou tothe my
` review qoute source ' litmus tust
. jstu tkae a look at thte full
- page ad inaddition tghe newspaper
annd see where tehy are pulling qoutes
. fo tihs movei
, htey are ffrom magazines called
` flaunt '
anbd
` mirabella
. ' noone dout
, tehy weere empressed wiht judd ' s serieses ofthe catwalks
adn disguise changes
. thge major probelm wtih
` eye ofthe teh beholder ' isnt thgat teh film jerks foward
, alwyas unsure ofthe its ulitmate destination
. if it ws a thriller
, htere ws littel tothe keep us entranced
. if it wass a lveo stoyr
, htere ws absolutly noone emotional pul
. completelyl disjointed infront stucture
, it ' s onyl saveing grace wass its stylish look wich reminded me ofthe my favorite car commericial
( teh oney where tghe
` 6 ' onthe tyhe tachometer dissolves inot a winding road
adn a passanger rail car dissolves inot a small miniatur onthe a child ' s turain setted
)
. i am aslo still hopefull thgat ashley judd wiull fidn a sereous role tothe showcase her potential talents
. beyond thgat
, thte film isnt hopelessly outloud
- ofthe
- controll
anbd isnt infront ened ofthe seriously better traction
adn handling
