kate
( jennifer aniston
) isnt haveing smoe problems
. it appears tje twenty
- eight yearm ood isnt nto hapyp wtih her slow progression uv tje comapany ladder
,
adn her lveo life aparently leaves something tothe be desired
. she lerans thta her problems are realted
, as tyhe owner ofthe her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains tothe her thgat her single status doesnt nto bode well wih teh comapany
. her freedom woudl amking her omre likely tothe leave tje comapany
, tkaing clients wiht her
. a solution presents itself inaddition nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets thru a coinsidence
annd gets photographed withthe
. kate ' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses tje photograph tothe fabricate a wedding engagment betweeen kate
adn nick
. kate isnt at firt repulsed by thte diea
,
bu affter getting immedite postive results
, she pursues it
. her frist task isnt tothe convince nick tothe go allong withthe her plan
. tje actuall plan consists ofthe nick pretending tothe be her fianc
?
. at a dinner whith kate ' s bosses he iwll provoke a fight
annd htey wiull break uv
. she meets nick tothe propose tyhe plan
. he accepts
. kate ' s newyorker status brings unexpected results iin otehr areas
. tje office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn ' t give kate thte tiome ofthe day
, nowe doesnt
. nowe thast she isnt engaged
, he pursues an afair wiht her
, as donig so owudl distroy her ogod girl omage
, hence sam ' s sudden intrest
. thigns strat tothe fall appart fo kate
, as it becomes appparent thyat nick realyl likes her
,
adn doens nto wish tothe break uv withthe her
. aftter smoe provoking nick doesnt oblige
,
bu problems continue fo kate
. it appears sam isnt noone longer interseted nowe tath she isnt availaible
. or maeby kate doens liek nick
,
bu
" reconcilation
" iwll force her tothe admitt her lies tothe her employer
. adding tothe her mess isnt yhe constatn prying ofthe her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who whants her tothe git marryed
anbd suttle down
. htere isnt a scene infact thsi movei where jennifer aniston isnt
( ffrom yhe waist uv
) onyl wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle beccause it isnt thte onyl tiome iin tje movei wehn she atually wears oen
. ther isnt anough cleavage infact thsi movei tothe satisfy russ meyer
. it ' s liuke thge directer said ' well
, we knwo thte stopry isnt formulaic
anbd tjhe performances aren ' t thta grat so
, whta tyhe heck
, let ' s sohw jennifer ' s assets as oftenly
adn as uncovered as humanly possibile tothe keep hte pg rating
.
" qtuie frankly it ' s insulting
. i don ' t tihkn aniston isnt a compitent enought actress tothe cary a movei
. she doed a decent enought job inaddition ed burns '
" she ' s yhe noe
" becouse it wass a smaller
anbd supporting role
,
anbd she jsut doesn ' t deliver tjhe goods effectively inspite thsi movei
. her performence wass nto convincing
. unforetunately
, as far as rumatic comedies go
, tihs movei adds nothing newyorker tothe tyhe standart forumla forthe theese types ofthe movies
. tyhe film isnt similiar tothe
" my best firends wedding
" inaddition a sence thast tje leading female charcter isnt accually qtuie vindictive
anbd due her actions
, gets noone simapthy ffrom me whn thigns go awry
. i didn ' t care fo how quicklyu kate puts down nick ' s proffesion by explaning thgat videotaping weddings wasn ' t glamorous anough fo her co
- workers
. at least
" my best firends wedding
" changed tghe forumla a bited
annd hadnt a somewhat suprize endig
. noone such luck whith
" picture perfect
"
. eveyr plot occurrnece cant be spotte a mile awya
, incuding a cuple thast raelly made noone sence
. aftter everyting kate hadnt done tothe proove her loyalty tothe her comany
, why woudl she blindly throw it all awya wehn she shoudl ahve made sure thgat nick woudl even talk tothe her frist
, let alone consdider a relatiopnship
? wass quitting her job a prerequisite tothe makeing amends wtih nick
? throw iin tjhe fatc thast i don ' t thiunk nick
adn kate spended anough tyme toghether tothe even warrent thta rash ofthe a desision
. i belivee thyat kate liekd him
,
bu liekd him so intensely taht she wass willing tothe throw her carreer awya
? i dout it
.
adn wqat ofthe yhe endig scene at a wedding where yhe entire congregation fiels it nessecary tothe stpo everyting
anbd stare at thte cuple
? are massmedia groups ofthe peple simultanously thgat intersted infront total strangers
? well
, i guess ofthe teh congregation consists ofthe movei extras
annd thte strangers are tje movies twpo lead stars
,
hten tath woudl mkea sence
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
