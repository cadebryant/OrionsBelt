recently oney niht a young directer named baz luhrmann couldn ' t sleep
. he tumbled outloud ofthe bed
anbd moved over tothe tjhe televsion where he watched mtv fo an hour
.
hten he moved tothe his kichen where he spended tjhe smae ammount ofthe tiem eating spoiled ofod
.
thn he tookover down a volumne ofthe shakespeare ' s wokr
annd read it cover tothe cover
- never realyl paying attension tothe yhe words or plot
.
annd
hten
, as a climax
, he tookover outloud his video camera
adn pressed tje
" onthe
" button
. tghe result
? william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
- tghe worst film ever made
annd a complet failure
.
though
, tothe be fair
, an intresting complet failure
. tyhe diea at teh film ' s core isnt tothe mkae shakespeare appealling tothe tjhe crowds
. tihs isnt done by moving thge camera arund at a repid rate so thgat we cin ' t see whta isnt oging onthe
.
anbd filming teh dialogue inwhich voice over
.
adn shooting leonardo dicaprio liuke a calvin klein modle
.
annd makeing tyhe frome go still hwile flashing yhe chracter ' s nmae at tje bottom
.
anbd filming long tedeous acation sequences infact slow motion
. i mean
, man
, htis isnt teh 90s
, dued
.
howver i ' ve seen terrable films tath are funn tothe watch
.
( examples are batman
adn robin
anbd yhe island ofthe doctor moreau
.
) thyat ruel doesn ' t apply here
. htis isnt a film thyat tkaes itself seriously
. thgat isnt it ' s major fault
. anohter probelm ws pointed outloud by my freind
, alex
( who wass singing songs by leonard bernstein througout
.
)
; yhe orginal play isnt a poweful peice ofthe wrok baceause tghe autor remained nuetral
annd didn ' t tkae sides
. here it ' s clera taht we are supposted tothe side wiht romeo
.
( jsut look at tjhe way htey film him
.
) fomr tje begining he ' s our hero
annd thsi doesn ' t owrk
.
adn dicaprio ' s awful peformance doesn ' t halp
. luhrmann never decides if he whants tothe entertain us or enlighten us
. teh result isnt a mess
. ytou cant fiel him striving tothe be something he isn ' t
. he trys tothe pul ofthe a mix inaddition whihc drag queens are filmed fomr purposefully arty angles
. he trys veyr hard
. key owrd
