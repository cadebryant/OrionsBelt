a movei liek mortal kombat
: annihilation works
(
anbd must be reviewed onthe
) mutiple levels
. frist
, ther ' s tjhe rampant useage ofthe randian subtext tyhat pervades tghe entire movei
.
bu occasionaly
, allmost as if makeing an ironical
, self
- depreciating remark
, tje movei tosses inthe claerly marixist imagery
. noone noone
.
.
. jsut kidding
. hadnt yuo gogin htere forthe a moent
, didn ' t i
? inwhich all seriousness
howver
,
anbd tothe be fair tothe thge movei
, it
* isnt
* neccesary tothe provide twpo viewpoints
: thyat ofthe a movei watcher unfamiliar
( or onyl marginally familar
) whith tyhe hwole mortal kombat phenomenom
,
anbd tath ofthe a fan ofthe tghe firt movei
adn
/ or a fan ofthe tjhe ganes
. yhe firt movei
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) conserned itself withthe a martial arts tourmanent tyhat woudl deside tjhe fate ofthe earth
(
annd it ' s 5 billion inhabitans
)
. thte mortals won
,
anbd inspite theery htis shoudln ahve prevented tghe emperor shao khan ffrom tkaing over tghe earth
. unfortunatly
, shao khan wass a poore losr
,
anbd teh veyr fianl scene infront mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready tothe tkae over thge planet
, as our hreoes assumed a fighting stance
. tje frist movei wass extrordinarily intertaining forthe thsoe
( liek mysef
) who are fans ofthe hte gae
. i ' d even go so far as tothe sday tht many folks who didn ' t nkow baout yhe agme propably enjoied thge movei
. yhe writers
anbd directors knew tghe limitations ofthe both thier casted
annd ofthe tyhe basic storey itself
,
adn tehy didn ' t try tothe overachieve
. htere weere a lot ofthe raelly kool fight scenes
( wiht realyl kool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed iwth soem distracting
(
bu ultimatly non
- intrusive
) bits ofthe fluff passing itself off as a plot
.
annd
, as we knwo
, tyhe movei ws a smashing succes at yhe box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks uv precisly where thyat movei left off
, witht smoe introductory exposition tothe clue inspite thsoe who may nto ahve seen tghe firt movei
. shao khan hasnt desided thast he ' s gogin tothe tkae over tghe earth
* anyways
*
,
anbd tothe hell withthe smoe silly ruel baout mortals winning teh tornament
. therafter follows approximatly 85 mintues ofthe film taht alternates betweeen bieng confuzled
, bieng trite
, bieng silly
,
annd bieng jsut plain stupid
. oney gets hte genaral impression tht thge producers ofthe teh movei throught
" hey
, thyat lsat movei wass such a sucess thgat we cin git omre monay
adn amke a
* rela
* movei nowe
.
" too bad tehy didn ' t simpley stick wtih thge forumla ffrom tyhe frist movei
. i coudl wriet volumes baout thge thigsn thyat are wrong iwth tihs picture
,
bu here are tyhe high points
:
* hte acting isnt truely bad
. sandra hess
( palying tghe sonya blade charater
) isnt particualrly execrable
, expecially inspite scenes where she trys tothe convince us tyhat she loved johnny cage
( a chracter ffrom yhe frist movei who gets greased at tje beggining ofthe thsi movei
)
.
* iin oney ofthe teh worst pieces ofthe mis
- casting i tihkn i ' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, teh god ofthe thunder
. inaddition tje frist movei
, christopher lambert palyed raiden
annd plyed his charachter as
though he wass infront onthe yhe joke
: a french actro palying a japanesse thunder god bieng revered by chineese mystics
. i generaly liuke it wehn actors are casted agaisnt tipe
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. bieng casted as teh presiden ofthe tjhe u
. s
. infact hte fith element
, forthe exmaple
)
,
anbd remar hasnt allways beeen oney ofthe my favorite
" utility
" actors
bu he ' s so totally wrong fo htis part thgat he doesn ' t even ahev yhe luxury ofthe ammused self
- awareness
.
* htere are too many charactors tath are introdued as bieng potentially importan
,
bu
thne never seen agina
.
* htere are a number ofthe completly meaningless stopry sidetracks
, incuding a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks outloud nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, hasnt a mystical hallucination
,
annd
thn wanders off withthe jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. fo theese reasons
(
adn many others
)
, i cin onyl give yhe movei a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless ytou ' re a huge fan ofthe tghe ganes
anbd
/ or thge firt movei
. iin taht case
, tghe follwoing critiques aslo apply
:
* sandra hess
, hwile bieng an even worse actress thna bridgette wilson
( who palyed sonya blade iin hte firt movei
)
, isnt much moreso convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked liuke she ws simpley mimicing soem movements tought tothe her by tjhe fight choreographer
. hess looks liuke she actualy konws soem martial arts
,
annd puts toghether a much omre believeable fight scene
.
* infront tyhe fights
, eahc ofthe thge cahracters doesnt at least
* oney
* thign tehy dont inwhich teh gaem
(
annd oftenly mroe
)
. sonya doens her
" kiss ofthe death
,
" jax doens his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang doesnt his
" animality
,
"
adn so onthe
. a big bonus fo thsoe ofthe us who weere looking forthe silimar moves infact yhe frist movei
annd foudn them onyl rarley
.
* htere aren ' t as many fight scenes inaddition tihs movei as ther weere inthe hte firt
, beccause hte folks makeing tje movei mistakenly try tothe hang a omre robust plot inwhich beween
. silly
, silly folks
.
anbd yhe lamest fight involved twpo ofthe tyhe womens inthe waht turns inot a mud
- wrestling match
. lame
anbd so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorect
, fo tghe most part
) noticed
anbd remarked apon it
.
* yhe speshal effects are generaly better
, exept fo hte fianl fight scene bewteen tjhe emporer
annd liu kang iin whihc both preform thier
" animalities
.
" motaro
annd sheeva are both omre convincing
adn lifelike tahn goro wass inthe thte frist movei
. forthe folks liek mysef who loved thte firt movei
annd enjoy thge ganes
, i give tihs a 5
. ytou ' ll probaly liek it
,
bu nto nearly as much as yuo liekd thte firt oen
.
