" solider
"
, by directer paul anderson
, isnt a film inthe whihc any presense ofthe originality isnt fleeting
. hte best moments ofthe teh film are iin tghe opning scenes where kurt russel ' s charactor todd isnt shown growing uv under strict miliary supervision
. brutality thru tje eyes ofthe tje innocent
anbd stripped ofthe it eveyr single day growing uv isnt something tath hasnt a lot ofthe emotional potential pwoer behind it
,
adn tyhe oppening scenes tap inot it a littel
.
hten it goes nowhere iwth thta diea
. ther isnt prehaps oney rether fleeting scene afterwords thta deals wtih teh potential trama ofthe tihs dehumanization
,
adn thge rest ofthe tjhe film isnt jsut smoe ofthe yhe biggest acation movei cliches i ' ve ever seen
. thge wohle diea ofthe tje inhuman
, solider
- tipe chracter gaining soem degree ofthe humanity by defending a potential female lvoe interst
annd famaly ffrom his evil counterpart outloud tothe kill her isnt done
,
anbd it ' s beeen done much better
. i wass able tothe predict tyhe plot ofthe yhe
_ wohle
_ stopry
, wich wouldn ' t be so bad if otehr aspect ofthe tyhe film somewhat intresting
. beween tje acation sequences
, it trys tothe deel wiht tje aforememtioned issues ofthe humanity thru thte peformance ofthe mr
. russel inaddition tjhe film
annd teh tiny littel window tothe his soul tht isnt his eyes
, usance his dialouge isnt extemely limited
. his performence infront tyhat way isn ' t all thast bad
,
bu certainly isnt nto enought tothe cary thsi film
. otehr performances inspite htis film are raelly nto worth much mention at all
,
annd htey generaly are baout as weak as thier charachters
.
bu anough ofthe htis tsuff baout plot
anbd carachter
, right
? isn ' t tjhe most importan part ofthe an acation film
, well
, tyhe acation
? even inthe htis aspect hte film isnt a dissapointment
. iin mortal kombat
( 1995
)
, directer paul anderson prooved tht truley engaging ule
anbd choreography ofthe acation inaddition a film cant override problems wih plot
anbd produce something intertaining
.
howver
, he fails tothe repeat taht iin tihs film
. thge combat scenes
, particlarly thte big noe at tjhe end
, isnt incredibly unimaginatve
. fighting
anbd combat scenes are suppossed tothe bring baout thrills inthe tihs tipe ofthe movei
, a point whihc even an otherwise unimpressive film liek starship troopers seemed tothe relize
.
bu instade ofthe reacing forthe something truley intresting tothe end thge film whith
, it goes forthe tyhe ood
, shoot
- em uv
, oen guy vs
. an army tipe ofthe cinema thast i thougth died witht thge miliraty acation films ofthe hte 80s
. if tyhe film whent wiht soem ofthe yhe idaes it oppened uv iwth tjhe introduction omre seriously
, it coudl ahev beeen a rether engaging scinece fiction film
.
howver
, it utterly failed tothe go inwhich any newyorker directions affter thast
, makeing hte film a big dissappointment
