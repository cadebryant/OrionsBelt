whn yuo ' ve run outloud ofthe ood tv shows tothe turn inot movies
, i guess ytou try video ganes
. why doed i go tothe see mortal kombat
: annihilation
? thte quest tothe seek an answer tothe tihs query may proove a better movei taht tghe oen i jsut saw
. htis film wass a bunch ofthe fighting
, yelling
, speshal effects
,
adn bad acting setted tothe an opressive techno music sountrack
. thte plot isnt fairly simple
: a portal hasnt oppened bewteen our world
annd thge
" outworld
"
, alowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn
( brian thompson
) tothe wreak havoc
adn attemt tothe distroy humanity
. hte ogod guys
, led by sorceror rayden
( james remar
)
anbd human mortal liu kang
( robin shou
)
, must tkae thte fight tothe outworld
, where tje fate ofthe both worls wiull be determined
. here ' s tje catch
: tehy must reunite princess katana
( talia soto
)
, who ' s onthe thte ogod side
, wih her ressurected mother queen sindel
( musetta vander
)
, who ' s onthe tyhe bad side
, forthe thier loev fo eahc otehr iwll close thte portal
adn ensure humanity ' s safty fo anyother generation
. how tihs isnt suppoed tothe owrk
, i still hve noone diea
,
bu i liekd katana ' s line
,
" i knew loev owudl keep us toghether
,
" usance tath captian
anbd tennille song ran thru my head
adn i got a ogod laff
. ther are soem seriously stupid thnigs inthe tihs movei
. tkae
, fo exmaple
, a transporation sytem whlch utilizes thte
" intertube winds
"
, generated by earth ' s magma flows
. yuo git infact htis metal ball whlch transports yuo thru undreground tunnels realyl fast
. how fast
? as katana syas
,
" yuo wiull be moving so fast
, it iwll be as if ytou are nto moving at all
.
" wqat
? later
, sonya blade
( sandra hess
) goes tothe fidn jax
( lynn
" red
" williams
, otherwise known as
" saber
" onthe tv ' s american gladiators
) at a medical reasearch facility onthe hte island ofthe oahu
. how dont we nkwo tihs isnt where she whent
? htere ' s a sign onthe tje facility ' s perimeter fence thta reads
: medical reasearch facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remeber
, tihs isnt nto a captin
,
bu an actuall sign
. i guess tjhe loction isnt onthe htere forthe all thsoe medical researchers who keep forgetting where htey are
. ther ' s a lot ofthe major flipping acation
, too
. hte frist encounter bewteen ogod
adn evil shows kahn
anbd rayden swiftly arching
though thge air towrad noe anohter
. dont tehy land
adn immediatley git inot thte fighting
? doens oney ofthe them land frist
annd catch hte otehr off guard
? dont tehy collide infront mid
- air
? noone
, apparantly tehy flip towrad eahc otehr so tehy cxan talk wihtout hvaing tothe yell fomr far awya
. why doed tehy ened thsoe metal balls tothe travel
? everyone sould hvea jsut flipped fomr point a tothe point b
. i hvea tothe admiting
, tje fight scenes are preety ogod
,
altough yuo cant tell htey are heavily enhanced by digital effects
annd fli wires
, alowing thte charachters tothe surpass tje lmits ofthe tghe human body
anbd tyhe laws ofthe pysics
. tghe movei ' s thrills are derivated ffrom theese scenes
adn most ofthe yhe audeince responses are onthe tjhe visceral levle wehn somone gets trashed realyl badly
.
" ouch
" wass thge most common expletive heared whn i screened htis oney
. ytou coudl tell thgat tjhe filmmakers knew inthe advance taht fights
, nto plot
, woudl be yhe main draw
, usance dialouge isnt apparantly iin tyhe film jstu tothe git ffrom oen fight tothe yhe enxt
. it seems thast ' s all htere isnt infact htis movei
. maeby it isnt
. as i hadnt maintioned
, tjhe acting isnt bad
. htere ' s nto noe solid peformance inspite thge film
, altho williams as jax ws preety funny
. affter a fight beetwen sonya
adn oney ofthe hte bad guys degenerates inot female mud wrestling
, jax syas
,
" yuo look ogod inwhich mud
. noone
, realyl
, ytou dont
.
" remar plays rayden witht an inconsistancy whic makse it hard tothe tkae his charactor seriously
,
anbd shou isnt relitively emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who hasnt palyed ogod guys
, bad guys
,
annd even an aline onthe tv ' s hte x
- files
,
bu alwasy smoe muscle
- binded behemoth
, isnt your averege evil demi
- god
,
bu it ' s mroe yhe scirpt ' s fault tahn his pwn thast he doesn ' t hvae anytying origonal tothe sday
. tjhe oen relaly impressive hting baout htis movei isnt tht htere isnt nto noe swaer owrd infront teh hwole hour
annd a half
. anyother hting whlch shoudln be noted isnt taht forthe all its punching
annd kicking
, blood onyl appears inaddition oney scene
. all inthe all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation isnt loud
, voilent
, shallow
,
annd marketed towrad kids
. hey
, jstu liuke tyhe video gae
!
