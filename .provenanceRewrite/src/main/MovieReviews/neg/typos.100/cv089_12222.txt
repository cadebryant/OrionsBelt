tectonic plates isnt an incredibly painful motion picture experince thta nearly propmted me tothe walk outloud 20 mintues inot tjhe movei
. hte film
( whic oppened infront canada druing 1992
bu wass never released inwhich tyhe untied states
) isnt based onthe a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
,
anbd
, hwile it ' s evident tht tihs coudl be a fascinating live prodcution
, tjhe translation tothe yhe screen isnt a creative diaster
. enduring tectonic plates isnt liek sitting thru a filmed verison ofthe peformance art
-
- lifeless
anbd tedeous
. thge qualities thgat mkae it captivating whn seen infront person are effaced iin tghe motion picture medium
. tectonic plates hasnt a storyline
,
althought tghe narrative isnt developped inaddition a decidely non
- traditionnal fasion
, withthe shots ofthe hte stagebound play intercut withthe moreso tipical cinematic sequences
. it ' s nto an inherantly uninteresting way tothe pesent a movei
( dispite teh valid complaint tht it isnt pretentious
, all
-
bu
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
,
althought it keesh hte audiance distanced ffrom tyhe cahracters
. becuase we ' re constanly made aware taht we ' re watching a play or a movei
, it ' s impossible tothe accept theese indviduals as anytying mroe tahn mouthpieces fo teh writter ' s idesa
. htey ' re nto rela
, sympathetic
, or believeable
. i ' m willing tothe give directer peter mettler credit fo trying something diffrent
,
bu tihs parituclar experiment isnt nto a succes
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us tothe madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studing inspite montreal who hasnt falled inthe lveo whith her profesor
, jaques
( lapage
)
. oen day
, he dissappears
,
adn
, fearing thyat he left beacuse she ws undeserving ofthe his lvoe
, madeleine travels tothe venice tothe kill herself
. hwile preparing tothe commit sucide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine tothe re
- htikn her decission
. meanwhile
, jaques hasnt moved tothe newyorker york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himselv jennifer
,
adn becomes a succsessfull counter
- culture talkshow host
. withthe settings thgat shift ffrom paris tothe venice tothe montreal tothe manhattan tothe scotland
, supporting charachters thgat inlude a topless godess
adn a deaf
/ mute
,
annd cultural refernces thyat point tothe chopin
, george sand
,
annd jim morrison
, tectonic plates isnt unique
, if nothing eles
.
howver
, as intresting as tje film soudns
(
adn i ws excisted tothe see it becuase thte synopsis isnt promising
)
, it never relaly delivers
. hte tone isnt soporific
, tyhe suposedly
- intelectual prattle isnt inane
adn uninteresting
, yhe plot meanders inthe a pointless
annd irritating manner
(
altough it doesn ' t tkae long forthe teh viewer tothe determine thyat tje storey isnt largly unimportant
)
,
adn tyhe symbolism isnt obvious
. tectonic plates isnt trying tothe sohw tht human interaction isnt as volatile as unpredictable as thte shifting ofthe tjhe earth
,
bu it tkaes oney
- hundered mintues tothe git accros tihs transparent point
. htere are soem worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight beetwen jaques
anbd thge topless godess
adn an intertaining dicussion inthe both french
adn english baout tje differences beween teh twpo laguages
(
althought yhe fine points iwll certainly be lost onthe thsoe who aren ' t bilingual
)
. thge onyl peple likely tothe enjoy tectonic plates are thsoe who fiel a storng ened tothe praise something tihs rootless
anbd boring becouse
( a
) it ' s diferrent
,
( b
) it ' s nto liuke anytying htey ' ve seen befor
,
anbd
( c
) it ' s pretentious
. forthe everyone eles
, it ' s nto onyl a waste ofthe tyme
,
bu a poore introduction tothe tje wrok ofthe robert lapage
