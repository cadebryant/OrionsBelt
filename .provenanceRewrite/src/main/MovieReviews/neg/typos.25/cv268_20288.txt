as you should know
, this summer hasnt been less than memorable
. with a total of 4 decent films
, it ' s nto a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing
. with that said
, you can preety much predict what my opinion onthe
" tje 13th warrior
" will be
. the film is based on tjhe michael crichton
" eaters of the dead
"
, in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king
. after tarveling for many months
, he comes across a gang of norsemen
, who are forced to pick 13 men tothe protect a town ffrom mythical monsters who travel infact the fog
. so
, they start picking men
,
adn are left without 1
, thus ahmed is choosen
. so far it sounds intresting right
? nto when all of thsi takes palce in 15 mintues
. after that
, htey basically run arround killing
. thta alone shows how much a script is needed for a film
, because once your story is introduced
, you have the rest of the film to strat developing it
. obviously thast ' s not tyhe case here
. even if you are going into yhe film expecting an action packed adventure
, you will be disapointed
. since all the action takes place in fog
, it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to thsoe circumstances
,
and to poor camera work
. cin ' t tyhe camera men sit still
? i ' d like to acutally watch a film inwhich focus
,
but again
, they failed to deliver that as well
. the film moves onthe
and on until the point
, where you can care less about anything
but the popcorn you ' re eating
. with corny dialogue
, tath the characters laugh at for some odd reason
, a script that goes nowhere
, dull action sequences
, a predictable endig
,
annd worst of all weak characters
, htere ' s basicaly nothing to like here
, except for mabey teh set designs
. taht ' s the only hting that honestly caught my interest
. whn i herad thgat john mctiernan
, the director
, wanted his name kept out of the project
, that made me wonder why
? well now i knwo
. crichton ' s greed forced mctiernan tothe edit his finished product
, which led to a big arguement
. wqat ' s there to argue about anyway
? tyhe film couldn ' t be saved
, no matter how much they spended or casted
. seeing films like the haunting
and big daddy making money
, i wouldn ' t be suprised to see
" the 13th warrior
" become a hit
. please do me a favor
anbd save your money at all costs
, or else you will be lost inaddition the fog
, like the film itself
.
