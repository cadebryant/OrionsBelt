, bebe neuwirth
. rated r
. summer of sam will be remembered as a waste ofthe spike lee ' s abilties
. lee is a grat filmmaker
, oftenly exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma
and martin scorsese
and a storytelling ability comprable to steven spielberg
.
bu here
, he gets hismelf into a bind
. his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he hasnt something to say whn in reality there is little ofthe substace to absorb from his work
. the summer ofthe 1977 was an unusual summer inspite newyorker york city
. it wass the hottest summer onthe record
. to boot
, newyorker york ' s first serial killer was on hte loose
: calling himself the son of sam
, david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area
and frightened the whole city population
. so it wass understandable that when nyc was hit wiht a citywide blackout
, people went berserk
, causing billions of dollars in damage tothe the city
. the movie ' s foucs is onthe a group of twenty
- somethings during tath fateful summer
: vinny
( john leguizamo
)
, a club
- hopping
, adultrous hairdresser
, his benevolent wief dionna
( mira sorvino
, looking young
)
, ritchie
( adrian brody
)
, a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect
, a gang of small tiem mobsters
anbd a few more minor characters
. we folow them through their roller coaster lives
, thrown out ofthe whack even more by the recent killings
. vinny
and dionna hve marital problems becasue vinny cheatta
and dionna tries to please him
, make him stay faithful tothe her
. ritchie gets shunned by his group ofthe firends because he hasnt started tothe become more
and more
" eccentric
,
"
adn has degenerated to tjhe point of dancing in gay night clubs
and making porno films with his girlfriend
. tensions build
and conflicts arise as the anniversary ngiht of son of sam ' s frist murder looms
; the night he promises he wiull strike again
. a local gang wtih too much time on its hands mkaes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects
. at hte top of the list isnt ritchie
. vinny
, an unwilling part of the said gropu
, isnt called upon to set a trap forthe his friend
. as we watch these proceedings
, some of which are painfully graphic
, the dreaded
" so what
?
" question springs to mind
. ffrom the way tihs movei is made
, i ' d have guessed thgat spike lee was trying to tell us something
,
but as i searched deeper it became claer that there isnt very little there to fidn
. lee touches onthe so much
-
- the media
, the 70 ' s punk scene
, the details of the actual killings
, as well as the characters ' very personal dilemmas
-
-
but he doesn ' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement
. all is not lost if a movie turns outloud tothe be hollow
; it can be a saveing grace for the film tothe be enjoyable
. too bad summer of sam doesn ' t get any help here
. frankly
, it ' s a bore
, a redundent
and repetitive two hour
anbd twenty minute film that doesn ' t entertain beyond its first half hour
. there is no suspense becuase the film refuses to be fully about the murders
and little involving drama because tje film is too muddled
and its focus too vague
. leguizamo ' s turn as vinnie is annoying
annd whiny
. the script makes it clear tyhat we ' re suppossed to believe that his character is flawed
,
bu still a ogod guy
. you ' d never guess from his peformance
. adrian brody
and especialy mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching performance in a banal movie
( i ' m tempted to think that i liekd her because nearly everything else around her was inane
)
; her character is affecting
and her emotions true
- to
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective portait ofthe a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for
. summer of sam has soem superficial elements of a good film
: it looks graet
, it hasnt a few notable performances
and i suppose it ' s pretty well directed
, in a purely technical way
.
but it ' s also empty
, pretentious
and boring
. like last year ' s the thin red line
, it ' s a movie by a director who doesn ' t knwo what he wants to say
bu goes ahead
and sasy it anyway
