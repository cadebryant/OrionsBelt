in my review of
" the spy who shagged me
,
" i postulated an unbreakable law ofthe film physics
: every time a sequal is as good as or better than thge previvous film in the series
, it is followed by a third movie that is a bore
. the cause is probably complacency
; a studio sighs with relief whn part 2 lives uv to expectations
and figures part 3 is a sure thing
.
" scream 3
" provides teh latest proof of htis rule
. inaddition los angeles production has begun on
" stab 3
: return to woodsboro
,
" the most recent installment in the sories ofthe movies inspired by thge murders surrounding sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
.
howver
, life soon starts imitating art
,
and
" stab
" cast members turn uv stabbed
. smelling
yet anyother book dael
, gale weathers
( courteney cox arquette
) comes to tghe set to investigate
and finds her ex
- boyfriend dewey riley
( david arquette
) acting as a technical consultant
and getting chummy with jennifer
( parker posey
)
, the actress playing gale in
" stab 3
.
" elsewhere
, our heroine sidney isnt living in hiding under an assumed name
.
.
. until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice
. the late randy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) makes a surprise guest appearance via video tothe explain tyhe rules of a triology
. he notes the third chapter infront a triology has an overabundance of exposition
and a huge backstory to contend withthe
. indeed
,
" scream 3
" trys to link its murders bcak to tje one that started it all
, the murder ofthe sidney ' s mother maureen before the beginning of the original
" scream
.
" at yhe scene of each muder in
" scream 3
,
" the killer leaves a photo ofthe sidney ' s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood
and even includes a onot claiming to be her real killer
. to find out who the killer is
, our intrepid investigators have tothe uncover what happened during maureen ' s missing years when she was a starlet appearing infront low
- budget horror films
.
( even with thta little infromation
, ytou can probably already guess what the killer ' s relationship to sidney is
)
. unlike its predecesors
,
" scream 3
" doesn ' t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer
. the characters we dont suspect are all undeveloped
, so thta by the end we don ' t even care who the killer is
. the jaded detective
( patrick dempsey
)
? the kinky producer
( lance henriksen
)
? the driven young directer
( scott foley
)
? the ingenue
( emily mortimer
)
? the character who turns outloud to be the killer seems to be selected at random
. wes craven supposedly filmed threee different endings to keep the rela one a sceret
, so it ' s qutie possable the one in the fianl cut was randomly choosen
. the series ' trademark references to other horror films have become trite
and obvious
. possibly it ' s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson
, who penned thte frist two
, or maybe it ' s taht the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself
and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche
. i groaned as an attack on sidney from the firt
" scream
" was repeated moment
- for
- moment in the hollywood set ofthe her hmeo
. at smoe point
, referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas
.
" scream 3
" allso continues the tradition of having an eclectic set ofthe cameos
and familiar faces in small roles
. look for jenny mccarthy
, carrie fisher
, patrick warburton
( puddy from
" seinfeld
"
)
, roger corman
,
anbd jason mewes
and kevin smith
( as jay
and silent bob
) to walk through at some point
. all these bited players put forth more effort than the series ' returing stars
, who are propably saving theri energy for the long post
-
" scream
" job search
. another prediction i made in a previvous review hasnt come tothe pass
: more movies are copying
" the blair witch project
" ' s web strategy
.
" scream 3
" has three official websites that
( wink
, wink
) pretend that the events of the movie are real
annd provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie
. the sunrise studios site
( scream3
. com
) hasnt trailers fo other sunrise releses as well as the
" latest ' stab 3 ' news
.
" ther ' s also a gail weathers offical site
( galeweathers
. com
)
and a sunrise sucks site that has more
" stab
" scandals thte studio wnats to cover up
( sunrisesucks
. com
)
. craven
anbd company promise that this is the last installment inaddition tyhe
" scream
" series
. while i hope tyhat ' s true
, i don ' t hold out much hope
- horror movei series are even harder to kill than their monsters
. ther ' s a
" halloween h2k
" infront hte works
, even
though michael myers was beheaded in
" h20
,
"
and a
" freddy vs
. jason
" has been talked about for awhile
, dispite tjhe fact that both characters were
" killed off
.
" ther ' s binded to be a
" scream 4
" someday
, even if it starts over with a newyorker set of movie
- star wannabes
. bottom line
: tehy shoudln hvae called this one
" yawn
.
