` tje bachelor ' is one ofthe the best terrible movies you will ever see
. wading thru this gooey
, detestable sludge isnt quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic
. those hoping to find some genuine charm
and feeling behind this chris o ' donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere
;
` the bachelor ' is a painfully clumsy mess strung toghether with a faw brief moments ofthe surprising poignancy
. awaiting these moments by enduring hte rest ofthe the film is certainly not worth your time or money
.
although he hasnt nto qutie evolved out of the stereotypical pretty
- boy cocoon
, chris o ' donnell has an effortless charm as an ctor
. most iwll recogize him as the high
- flying robin fomr the two latest
` batman ' films
,
but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile
. can o ' donnell cary the weight of a film on his shoulders
? prehaps
, if he found the proper veicle
.
.
.
but
` the bachelor ' falls far short ofthe tyhe requirements
. the actor jstu can ' t register with such a pathetic screenplay as yhe guiding light to success
. a few instances ofthe adorable humor asside
, it becomes apparentt that no one coudl save teh festering mess that is
` the bachelor '
. o ' donnell plays jimmie
, a hopeless romantic inaddition his late twenties who ' s progressing in a serious relatiopnship iwth anne
( renee zellweger
)
. jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the resteraunt specifically used forthe proposals
,
and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage
. the probelm is that his proposal sucks
. big time
. you cant tell things aren ' t going pleasantly
, because jimmie gets the infamous
? deer
- in
- the
- headlights ' look when anne questions his approach
.
adn
thne
, the plot
( allong with the stupidity of thge movie
) thickens
. jimmie ' s granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies suddenly
, leaving a video will behind for his grandson
( who also happens to be his only living realtive
)
. everybody is speechless whn grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in yhe amount of 100 millon dollars to jimmie
. of course
, there ' s a catch
: he must get married befor his 30th birthday
, stay joined wiht his bride for an entire decade
,
anbd produce heathy children withing thge first five years
. the bad news is that jimmie ' s birthday is the following day
. with anne out of town
, he must find a willing bride to share his riches with
.
.
.
adn within a vyer limited tiem frome
. there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of
` tje bachelor '
. for one
, the movie ' s aproach isnt intresting
and nto dripping with clich
?
. another isnt the colorful cast
. o ' donnell
and zellweger are cute together
,
annd thte supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescure the film from drowning in it ' s own mediocrity
. ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure
,
and james cromwell is sincere
and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie ' s marital adventures
.
and now the cons
: the approach may be intresting
,
bu in trying an ood
- fashioned method
, director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel
. the characters are drawn wiht obvious
, broad strokes
,
and the plot is bogged down with everyting humanly imaginable
. yes
,
` the bachelor ' isnt far moreso frustrating than cute
. the screenplay is lamely written
,
anbd the subject matter poorly conceived
. the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted
, along with whatever promise the film initialy contained
. potential goes out thge window early to suit sinyor ' s
` colorful ' approach
,
but nto a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director ' s wishes
.
` the bachelor ' becomes lost wihtout a homing beacon to save it
. ytou ' ve seen thte tv spots
, haven ' t you
? o ' donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street
and the caption reads
` what isnt this man running from
? ' in actuality
, he ' s fleeing from thousands ofthe angry brides who want to marry him
adn inherit his fortune
( it ' s noe of the few enjoyable sequences in the film
)
. after seing the movie
, i believe that the approaching horde could be something eles
. o ' donnell could be runing fomr his angry fans
, who ahev just endured
` the bachler '
,
anbd are hunting him down for revenge
.
