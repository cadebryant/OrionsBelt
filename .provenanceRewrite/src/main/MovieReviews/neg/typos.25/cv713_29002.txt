" amercia ' s sweethearts
" has an intriguing premise
and a great cast
,
but it isn ' t nearly as edgy or funny as it shouldnt be
. alomst all thge problems with the project can be traced bakc to co
- script writer billy crystal
, who shows the same lack of disciplien witht the screenplay tyhat he typically displays while co
- hosting
" comic releaf
" charity shows with robin williams
and whoopi goldberg
( twpo otehr paragons of self
- indulgence
)
. crystal ignores a simple
,
bu crucial
, ruel
: forthe a screwball comedy to wokr
, thge cahracters must be placed into a rigid social setting
, because only in that context will theri unorthodox antics be humorous
.
" amercia ' s sweethearts
" takes place at a press junkte
, where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters
. it ' s a promising set
- up
,
but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules
, thus dissipating the tension of the situation
. by the end of the film
, all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on
,
bu their outbursts are only mildly amusing baceause the structure has been destroyed
. john cusack
and catherine zeta
- jones play eddie thomas
and gwen harrison
, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hitted the skids wehn gwen began seing hector
( hank azaria
)
, a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp
. of the last nine films eddie
adn gwen made together
, six crossed tghe
$ 100 million mark
,
but the prospects for their final efort
, a spoace opus titled
" time over tyme
,
" are far ffrom rosy
. while eddie has spent many months infact a newyorker age rest clinic fretting over the breakup
, gwen ' s solo films have tanked
. tothe mkea marter worse
, the directer of the movie
( christopher walken
)
, a
" visionary
" who purchased tyhe unabomber ' s cabin
adn had it moved to his backyard
, is withholding the film from the studio
, insisting that the first screening be held at the ujnket
. desperate to win over the press
, thte studio elects tothe hire lee
( billy crystal
)
, a recently fired publicist
, to salvage the situation
. lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie
and gwen tothe pretend to be on hte road to reconciliation
. he enlists the halp ofthe kiki
( julia roberts
)
, gwen ' s sister
, personal assistant
and whipping girl
. what lee doesn ' t know isnt that kiki is in lvoe with eddie
, a fact that could temper her effectiveness
. press junkets are a haven for controll freaks
. studios fly journalists in fomr around the world
and put them up inspite a plush hotel
, with fodo
and drink always at hand
. generally
, on the evening of their arrival
, writers are bussed to see the featured film
,
then ferreted straight back to the hotel
. the next day
, writers go to the studio suites
and assemble in groups ofthe five or six fo roundtable interviews
. eveyr 30 minutes or so
, a producer
, director
, writter or actro is brought into the room for a faw minutes ofthe questions
, with a publicist hovering in yhe corner to keep an eye on things
. the atmosphere isnt one ofthe coridal oppression
? writers are free to ask what they wnat
,
bu understand that if the studio dislikes a question
, htey may not be invited to future junkets
. representives from tv stations face even more restrictions
. they get roughly five minutes to interview each memeber ofthe tghe cast
and crew
, with tyhe studio filming the exchanges
. tghe
" reporters
" are notorious for tossing softball questions as htey suck uv tothe the stars
,
but to play it safe
, the studios stand ready tothe erase the tapes if anything unplesant occurs
. placing twpo spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired
,
bu the screenplay undermines the conceet
. thge junket is moved from the handsome
,
bu highly confining
, four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas
. for most ofthe the film
, teh movie stars run arund the sprawling grounds
, completely safe from the eyes of the press
. when they do deal with journalists
, the
" it is imperative that you be onthe your best behaviour in front of the reporters
" premise is de
- clawed
. gwen
and eddie insult eahc other while the tv cameras roll
, they scream at each other in a restaurant filled wih the media
and
, at the screening of the movie
, everyone conected witht the film goes nuts
, all wihtout any repercussions
. lee certainly isn ' t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts
; in fatc
, he makes arrangements for footage of even moreso inappropriate behavior to be delivered tothe the tabloids
. is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors
? hell no
? they feel lee is a genuis for garnering so much publicity for tghe movie
. all of which underscores how billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan screwed up thier own premise
: the comedy infront
" amercia ' s sweethearts
" is based on barely
- in
- control peple trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters
, except that it doesn ' t matter because any publicity is ogod publicity
.
annd thus thge very setted
- up forthe tjhe film implodes
, leaving smoke
and dust inwhich palce of laughter
. so what about the casted
? julia roberts
, at her best playing the underdog
, is utterly charming here
,
although i could have lived wihtout flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit
(
and not a very convincing one
, by yhe way
)
. catherine zeta
- jones makes a believeable brat
and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed chracter enough to make him vaguely sympathetic
. by casting himselv as the publicist
, billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the smae hting he does onthe
" comic relief
"
- stay on yhe sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes
and snarky remarks
. inthe supporting roles
, hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures
and a spanish accent taht speedy gonzales would have deemed
" too broad
.
" seth gren is amusing as a toadie
, stanley tucci is veyr good as a ruthless studio head
annd christopher walken plays thte eccentric director with suitable flair
,
though he has little to wrok with
. come to think ofthe it
,
" little to work with
" is the operative phrase for this movie
. as a hollywood satire
,
" america ' s sweethearts
" is toothless
. as a romance
, it is at best a minor pleasure
. such a good casted
, such a waste of their efforts
. had it not been taken long ago
, a better title for the film would ahve been
" much ado baout nothing
.
