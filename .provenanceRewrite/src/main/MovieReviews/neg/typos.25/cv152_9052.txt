there was probably a good reason taht the warner bros
. studio chose nto to allow critics tothe view htis steven seagal film when it first opened
.
and
, aftter seeing this peice of toxic waste
, i now konw why
. this movie is by far thge worst offering that hasnt hit teh screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago
. fire down below centers its story onthe a little minning town in god ' s ocuntry
, somewhere inthe eastern kentucky
. it ' s beauty
and natural goodness isnt bieng slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate
( kris kristopherson
, who constantly looks liek he whants to kill his agent for getting him this role
)
. it turns out that he ' s filling yhe mines thoughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit
. seagal plays jack taggert
, an aikido
- versed
, fighting machine
, who isnt an agent witht the epa
. no
.
.
. not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa
. it ' s the environmental protection agency
. i had noone idea tath epa agents were trained to be killers
! taggert is sent to find the perpetrators
and tothe bring them tothe justice
. written by somene named jeb
, i could already envision the sterotypes ofthe incestuous relationships
, banjo
- picking preachers
,
and dumb
- as
- nails rednecks
.
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in
. seagal ' s diea of a disguise is a long
- length
$ 1000 leather jacket
.
but to get closer to the kinfolk
, he will fix people ' s porches forthe free
. thta ' s anohter great epa asset
- teaching aggenst how to fix porches
. slow
and plodding
, this project isnt a total mess
. the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber
and outgun him like in under seige
. here
, his bravado basically turns into bullyness
. townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued
. fight scenes are quick
and senseless
and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever
.
annd his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes
. the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony
, gets behind the pulpit
,
and beseeches the townsfolk to tkae control of their lives
annd tothe help clean up the environment
.
but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when thte person responsible for the toxic dumping
, kristopherson
, meets up with seagal
. kristopherson asks seagal how much it iwll take fo him to go away
. seagal gallantly replies
:
" i ' ll leave whn you take the posion from the streams
anbd the earth
.
" i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting
and a sohw of fireworks in the backgorund
. this is truely nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal ' s righteousness
and narcissistic arrogance
. seagal has been vanguard in trying tothe bring a newyorker genre into thge filmplace
, that of tghe enviro
- thriller
( on deadly ground
)
.
however
, the message will never come accross through poorly developed vehicles like this
. still
, i believe in preserving mother earth
, so save your
$ 5
adn please donate it instade tothe smoe worthy enviormentally conscious charity
