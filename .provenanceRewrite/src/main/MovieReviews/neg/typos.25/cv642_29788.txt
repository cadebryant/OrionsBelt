the oen question that eats at me after seeing corky romano isnt why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film
. since june
, i haven ' t been able to turn onthe tjhe tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky
, shrieking outloud a
- ha ' s
" take on me
" in his yellow miata
. why would disney sink so much cash into thte corky hype machine
? honestly
, i was hoping thta all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie
. man
, was i wrong
. corky romano is one of thsoe throwaway
, clich
?
- ridden tv
- star
- to
- film vehicles builded apon yhe most rickety of plots
. fortunatly for chris kattan ' s precariously positioned career
, corky does have some good laughs
, even if most of them are of yhe lowest
- brow variety
. kattan plays teh title character
, the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant forthe sunshiny ' 80s tunes
, bright ties
,
and banal coffee mug slogans
(
" you don ' t have to be crazy to work here
,
but it sure helps
.
"
)
. when his mob boss dad
( peter falk
) is about tothe be put away on murder charges
, his bungling
, lughead brothers
( peter berg
annd chris penn
) rope infact innocent
, black sheep corky tothe inflitrate the fbi as an agent
and steal yhe evidence
. predictably
, hijinks ensue
. if the basic plot sounds bad
, wait until you get into thge inner
- workings of this clunker
. the writers wiull amaze you with the depth of their inanity
. corky ' s fbi agent idenity is named corky pissant
(
" that ' s pronouced pees
- ahn
. it ' s french
.
"
)
. he becomes a first
- rate agent by accidetnally stumbling mr
. magoo
- style onto the proper clues
and talking his way in
and out ofthe situations
, wich plays like something outloud of a sitcom
.
and not a good sitcom
, i mean
. the romano family brothers even insult earch otehr by farting in each otehr ' s face
.
adn in a scene taken straight fomr there ' s something about mary
, corky gives a dachshund mouth
- to
- mouth resuscitation
.
but it ' s not a complete diaster
. tyhe manic kattan doens occasionally rescue some comic moments
, includng a bited featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus
and another involving schoolchildren
, a german shephard
,
and a kilo of cocaine
. plus
, berg
-
- whose career has obviously gone downhill since yhe last seduction
and chicago hope
-
- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie
.
and
, it ' s nice tothe see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work
. unfourtunately for those out there who can ' t truely appreciate animal or fart jokes
, corky won ' t have much to offer yuo
. so the next time one ofthe thsoe pesky ads appears on your tv
, asking
,
" who is corky
?
" you can simply reply
,
" who cares
?
