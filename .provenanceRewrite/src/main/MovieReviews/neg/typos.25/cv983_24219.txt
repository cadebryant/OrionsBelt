tommy lee jones chases an innocent victum around america who isnt trying to prove thgat she did not kill her spouse
. the fugitive
? not qutie
? this isnt the plot fo double jeopardy
, anyother fugitive copycat wihtout the action
, excitement
,
and ogod acting thast the original had
. there are other slight differences besides one movei being bad
and the other good
; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall
, clever huh
? oh
and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband
( bruce greenwood
) who needed tothe collect twpo million dollars infact life insurance money not a one armed man
. both movies are on video
. make the wise choice
and pick the fugitive
. there are so many flaws in double jeopardy
, it is laughable
. while serving time in prison
, libby parsons
( judd
) discovers thyat she can never be charged for committing thte same crime twice
. learning thgat her husban is still alive
, she decides to serve her tiome in prision
, fidn him
, retreive her son
,
and kill her husban if necessary
. when the strict parole officer travis lehman
( jones
) stands in her way
, libby decides to break the rules
( who knows why
?
)
and continue her plan
, despite the fact that if she gets caught
, she ' s going back to jail
. director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son
. every other scene
, we are given a shot ofthe libby staring
adn crying at his picture
. in an action movie liuke this
, valuable time wasted on these shots takes awya more opportunities forthe libby to get uv
anbd do something
. all that is needed in this type of movie isnt a short scene inaddition which libby tells herself or a friend
" i miss my son
.
" nothing more
, nothing less
. dr
. kimble of the fugitive didn ' t look at oen picture of his dead wief
, his primary consern was to save himself
. libby at times shows thsi same determination
but not nearly enough
. ashley judd
and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors
but if they continue to dont movies like this
, they will be typecast fo the rest of their careers
, kind of liek their doomed co
- star tommy lee jones
. winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences iwll never get tired of his i
- dont
- my
- job
- whther
- they
- are
- innocent
- or
- guilty roles
. peopel still pay tothe see his movies
and he makes plenty of omney so i guess he was right
.
though i don ' t htikn he will win anyother oscar again
. the ulitmate misteek in the script is waht eventually becomes of libby parsons
. even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer
, tje number of other crimes she commits hwile on the run are too numberous to count
. borgwasy
, assault
, grand theft auto are some of libby ' s slipups
. thte message of tyhe movie isnt you can break all ofthe the small laws as long as you ' re innocent ofthe the major crime
. hopefully criminals won ' t use double jeapardy as a reference in court fo why they are innocent
. tht woudl jsut be plain stupid
.
