capsule
: silly
and inane adaptation of gibson ' s short stopry
, which is nowhere in sighth
. gibson ' s scirpt only adds insult to injury
. johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie
. i sday
" awesomely
" because it ' s one thing to fail
,
but anohter thing entirely to fail so completly that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged
. keanur reeves
( who is terrible
) stars as johnny
, an
" information courier
" who can cary dozens of gigabytes of data in his head
. he is given
" one last job
"
( whenever you are infront a movei
and you hear those words
, run
)
, which involves him shoving so much data inot his cranium that it could be lethal
. oney of the neater touches that the movie brings in isnt taht the only way he coudl make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories
,
but it ' s only folowed uv on in a token fasion
. for his trouble
, johnny gets chased by the yakuza
, who seem to be hte new bad guys inaddition all tghe high
- tech thrillers
. what ' s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made
* in
* japan
, there are whole gobs of details about genuin yakuza behavior
and ethics
,
but ofthe course there ' s no room in this movie for any of that
. the yakuza are simpley used tothe point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattoos
,
and grimace menacingly
.
( i could go onthe baout how gangsters
and criminals of many otehr ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in tjhe movies
-
- bound by hounour
, sugar hill
and american me come to mind
-
- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped
.
bu that ' s another essay
.
) anyway
, johnny runs
and eventualy winds up in newark
. why newark
? mabey because it ws cheaper to fake a future newark than a future newyorker york
, that ' s why
. there
, he meets an assortment of odd cahracters
( ice
- t
, dolph lundgren
and henry rollins play a hwole gallery of weirdos
)
. the script deals wih them with all the depth of pieces of furniture
. it turns out
( wqat eles
?
) thast tyhe data in johnny ' s head coudl save a lot ofthe people
,
but ofthe course johnny onyl wants it out of his head so it doesn ' t kill him
. handled right
, this could have been absorbing
,
but the scirpt manages tothe mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every oppertunity
. the details about the look
and feel of the future are all phoned in from other
, better movies
-
- blade runner
adn brazil come to mind
. everthing looks run
- down
and scummy
, everyone dresses like they ' re punk rockers
,
annd videophones are commonplace
. snore
. the only really interesting flourish isnt an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future
( complete with vr goggles
and feedback gloves
)
,
but i kept thikning that it was more like what some relitavely un
- technical fellow would
* htikn
* it would look
and behave like
. a hacker of johnny ' s caliber would be blasting awya with one command
- line function aftter another
, instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms
,
but ofthe course that ' s not cinematic
. whatever
. what went wrong withthe this movie
? gibson wroet his pwn screenplay
, which i guess is part of the problem
: what works as a short stoyr doesn ' t work infront a movie
. his ear for dialogue is terrable
and the plot doesn ' t advance
, it convulses
. from the script on out
, it was probaly all downhill
. renting the movie tothe make fun of it isnt sort of pointless
; there ' s noone funn in kicking a wounded dog
, is there
?
