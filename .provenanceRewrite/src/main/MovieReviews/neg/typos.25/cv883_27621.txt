! critique
: completely idiotic
. okay
, so mabey i ' m being a little too nice
. tihs movie starts off dumb
, moves into the ridiculous
and eventualy graduates to idiocy
. there
.
.
. that ' s omre like it
!
annd how
, you may ask
? well
, it ' s simple realyl
. four ofthe thte dumbest stereotypical models in the world
( oh my god
, i just foudn out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life
.
.
. yipes
!
) join monica potter
( in a role wich cxan only be decribed as an obvious cry for help
)
and freddie prinze jr
.
( not the atcor
,
bu hte character better known as freddie prinze jr
.
)
, in a plot so stupid
annd far
- fetched
, that you have tothe wonder once more
, how crap like tihs gets by the hollywood bigwigs
. this thing stinks to high
- heaven
. it ' s just plain embarrassing for everyone involved
. i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humer somehow worked its way into this so
- called rumatic
- comedy
- action movie
? ugh
. what a pile of dung
. hey
, i ' m actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here
,
but i guess i sould see where his frustration comes from time to time
. it ' s sad realy
. a movie which actually had quite a few peple in my audience laughing at its idiocy
, including the over
- used
" folks hiding in teh bathroom while somene eles comes in to take a crap
and fart
" gag
.
and how baout that dumb blonde model who keeps runing into things
. pure hilarity
! or maybe i ' m just too jaded
, too much of a critic
, not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff
- peice
.
.
. uuuhhmmm
.
.
. naaaaah
!
! this movie sucks the big one
. it ' s chockfull of stupid cahracters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot
. this is the kind of movie thta hasnt one character inserting another character inot a car headfirst to the floor only because
.
.
. well
, it ' s supposed to be funny
, see
? you see
, that person
then has their legs swinging in the other person ' s face as tehy drive
and that distracts the driver
, see
,
annd well
, that ' s kinda funny
, no
? harumph
.
.
. yeah
, well
.
.
. you get the picture
! anyhoo

. the rest of the model girls
.
.
. well
, thanks for being ther so i hadnt something to look at
,
bu please apologiz to teh entire modeling community as a hwole
, forthe making them all outloud to be complete imbeciles
!
! so why tyhe three points out of ten
, you may ask
? well
, it ' s simple really
. one point goes tothe the russian model girl
and that cool accent
( don ' t ask me why
,
but it acually turned me on
)
. oen point goes out to all of tjhe model girls for being in the movie
( nice window decoration
.
.
. natch
!
)
.
and one last point goes out to the makers of this film
, who spared us any long sorted story
,
anbd made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving thte theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage
, so that we could run outloud as fast as we can
, grab the next person that we see walking down the street
and warn them ofthe the devil that is
.
.
. freddie prinze jr
.
.
. i mean
, head over heels
. you ' ve been warned
