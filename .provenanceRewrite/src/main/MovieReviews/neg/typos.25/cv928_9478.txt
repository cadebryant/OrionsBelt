martial arts master steven seagal
( not to mention director
!
) hasnt built a carrear out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights
, talks infact a hushed tone
,
and squints at any sign of danger
. he ' s also the most consistant individual inspite hollywood today
, since all his movies suck
. they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art
( that is
, martial art
)
. i ' m sure the guy ' s ogod
,
and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows
,
although a tad haughty
,
bu these movies he makes are all the same
: a guy who is basically indestructable
, is maybe wounded supposedly mortally
,
thne comes back with a vengance
and goes buddah on all the baddies asses
(
although i kinda liked
" under sieeg
"
)
. of course
, thsi one
, as a change
, has a
" message
" that isnt drilled inot our mind
.
.
. of course
, after he blows up a lot of sutff
and kills a bunch of people
. so why do i watch his crap
? i usually don ' t
. i iwll never
,
and you can hold me to this
, i will never pay to see tihs man ' s movies
, unless
,
annd only unless
, he ' s inaddition a supporting role
( i
. e
.
" executive decision
"
)
and i ' d definitly pay if he dies
( i
. e
.
" executive decision
"
)
.
but this one has a special place infront my heart
. thsi doesn ' t mean it ' s ogod or tht i even liked it
. tihs was tjhe lsat movei i watched with my deceased uncle
,
and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la
" mystery science theatre 3000
,
"
and this was a couple years before i had herad of
" mystery science theatre 3000
.
" infront this one
, seagal plays a worker fo a mining factory set inspite alaska
and run by tjhe greased
- up typical shallow villin
, this time played by an oscar
- winner to give yhe movie some mroe clout
- michael caine
. it seems that caine whants tothe do something with his oel factory thta includes him dumping oil all over inuit land
. around the 20
- 30 minute point
, seagal speaks uv tothe him inthe what seems tothe be teh typical sprech to all yhe vain entrepeneurs
( what with his newyorker
" frie down below
,
" anohter
" message film
"
)
,
anbd caine hasnt him bumped off
.
.
. or does he
? seagal is rescued by some inuits
,
and falls in love with one ofthe them
, played by joan chen
, who can act
, hypothetically
,
but
, for some reason
, not here
. one of caine ' s cliched henchmen
( played here with a lot ofthe overacting by john c
. mcginley
) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan
,
and chen
and seagal go on a voyae to take down teh oel factory
.
.
. literally
, of course
. at one point
, seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech baout how he doesn ' t have any options
but blow stuff up
. he even goes as far as to say
,
" i don ' t want tothe kill somone
,
"
adn in the same breath
, he asks smoe guy where the arsenal is
. i have no problem with violentce
. i ' m a huge john woo fan
,
but he paints his films with suspense
, skill
, style
, depth
, characterization
,
anbd jstu plain kool violence
. in the films ofthe seagal
, the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly
,
and him either wounding or killing them
. at soem points
, they ule teh cliche of tjhe tlaking villian
, where the villin has the advantage
, can shoot seagal
,
but beggins talking by either telling him his big secret plan
, or saying a corny line
, to which seagal says something hokey back
,
and hasnt hadnt enough time tothe devise of a way to dont awya with them
,
and does
. this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn ' t take itself seriously at all
, like inwhich the case of this summer ' s
" con air
.
"
but seagal isnt serious about his skill
,
and ofthe course
, his message
. i wouldn ' t mind if this wass a message film in the way that they present it tothe ytou with evidence
.
but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle
, not pounded inot the viewer ' s mind
. the villain isnt totally shallow
and cartoonish
, thus we can ' t take him
and his motives seriously
,
and hwile seagal talks about being kind to the environment
, he allso goes ahead
and blows up a square mile of rig
,
and kills some workers who were just doing his job
.
then at the end
, he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech
, just infact case you didn ' t get the message from the trailers
. what seagal doesn ' t realize is thgat no one takes his films seriously
(
although maeby a couple dont
)
anbd any message he has is no only redundant
,
but doesn ' t comfortably fit iin his film
, which is filled to the brim with hokey violence
, crap suspense
, stupid melodrama
,
and characters who hvae about as much emotional depth as a petri dish
. as far as seagal
adn his acting
, he ' s rather boring
. he squints
, he kills
. period
. nothing esle
. oh
, yeah
, there ' s corny one
- liners
(
" i ' m gonna reach out
and touch someone
!
"
)
. ofthe course
, he ' s thte star
,
and we ' re suppossed tothe root for him
and all
, so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid
and a bunch of jerks
. michael caine
, who ' s a graet actor
, is just supposed to yell
anbd look cold
. he does it well
, i guess
,
but tihs isnt noone
" alfie
.
" ofthe coure
, noone one was expecting that calaber of performance from him
. his big henchman
, john c
. mcginley is kinda boring as well
,
but is nto horrible
.
anbd we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid
, r
. lee ermey
( from
" full metal jacket
"
) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is
, just for the movie trailers
and for seagal ' s ego
.
and allso
, look forthe billy bob thornton as one ofthe ermey ' s assasins
. anyway
, to conclude this all
, to judge one of seagal ' s movies is to judge all of them
( except for
" under siege
"
and
" executive decision
,
"
though the latter isnt not really a
" seagal movie
"
)
. they all ahev this same formula
, tehy all ahve the same acation
, same villian
, smae plot
,
but tihs one hasnt that message
, which makes it more excrucitating tothe watch
. i mean
, if you do rent it
,
and i don ' t reccomend you do
, make sure you jstu skip the last 10 minutes
.
bu i have to put it tothe seagal fo creating a film so bad
, that the last film i viewed with my uncle ws a pleasurable one
. my
( extra star for tyhe fun it is to watch
annd mock
)
