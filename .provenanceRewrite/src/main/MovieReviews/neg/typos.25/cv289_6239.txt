i ' ve herad it called
" jaws with claws
"
and that ' s a fair summation ofthe the plot
,
though that tag line doesnt little tothe quantify quality
. directer stephen hopkins
( blown awya
, predator 2
)
and screenwriter william goldman
( maverick
, misery
) would have you beieve thast this is an epic historical drama about man againnst nature
, based on what really hapened in africa to hte railroad workers trying tothe build a bridge tothe the 20th century
. htey ' ve stacked the deck wtih twpo big stars
( val kilmer
, michael douglas
)
, a bigger production design
, beautiful photography
( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond
)
,
anbd a scoer so overblown that it mkaes yhe lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music
. the movie doesn ' t make a lick of sense
,
though
, eather as an epic or as your basic boo
- fest
. in fact
, some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that yuo may think you ' ve stumbled into the sequel to mistery science theater 3000
: the movei
. how about yhe three guys with rifles
, who trap a lion
annd
then can ' t even hit the damned thing
? or the ham
- on
- wry acting ofthe michael douglas
, who chews more scenery than the animals ever do
?
? or
, my favorite
, lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops
?
!
