who knew that inaddition 16 years eddie murphy
, who made such a brash
, raucous big
- screen splash iin
_ 48
_ hrs
.
_
, would become
.
.
. cuddly
. the disconcerting trend begun inwhich this summer ' s cutesy
, largely laff
- free
_ doctor
_ dolittle
_ continues with tihs earnest
- to
- a
- fault dramedy
.
although he is top
- billed
, here murphy is mearly support for jeff goldblum
, who plays ricky hayman
, the programming director at a hmeo shopping network
. sales are way down
,
and ricky ' s job hangs by a thread unil he meets g
( murphy
)
, a misterious spiritual guru whom a dseperate ricky puts on the air
. while sales skyrocket
annd g becomes an overnight sensation
, teh reinvigorated ricky ' s greed grows
, endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant
( kelly preston
)
. writer tom schulman hasnt smoe promising ideas
, satirizing home shopping
and infomercials
and the nature of instant celebrity
.
but these idaes would have more bite if stephen herek hadnt invested any energy inot the direction ofthe the film
. the sluggishly paced
_ holy
_ man
_ isnt nto only slow
and overlong
( 113 mintues
)
,
but an unfunny bore
,
and murphy can do little to juice up thte procedings
; cleansed of both the atitude
_
and
_ comic sensibility that made him a star
( g is
, for the most part
, a straight man
)
, he is a curiously lifeless presense
. goldblum is actually quite good
,
but it ' s hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his carachter
and spiritual jouney when the directer doesn ' t seem to be much interested
, either
.
