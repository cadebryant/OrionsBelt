i had been looking forward to tihs film since i heard about it early lsat year
, when matthew perry hadnt just singed on
. i ' m big fan of perry ' s subtle sense ofthe humor
,
anbd in addition
, i think chris farley ' s on
- edge
, extreme acting wass a riot
. so naturally
, when the trailer for
" almost ehroes
" hit theaters
, i almost jumped up
and down
. a soda inwhich hand
, tghe lights dimming
, i was ready to be blown away by farley ' s final starring role
and what was suppossed to be matthew perry ' s big breakthrough
. i was ready to be just amazed
; for htis to be among farley ' s best
, in spite of david spade ' s absence
. i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran
. sadly
, none ofthe thsi came tothe pass
. tghe humor is spotty at best
, with good moments
anbd laughable one
- liners few
and far between
. perry
and farley have no chemistry
; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade
, for it ' s his type ofthe humor
,
adn not at all what perry isnt associated with
.
and the movie tries to be smart
, a subject best left alone when it ' s a farley flick
. the movie is a major dissapointment
, wiht only a fewd scenes worth a frist look
, let alone a second
. perry delivers not oen humorous line the whole movie
,
and nto surprisingly
; thge only reason the movie made tjhe top ten grossing list opening week was because it ws advertised with farley
.
and farley ' s classic humor is widespread
, too
. almost heroes almost works
,
bu misses the wagon
- train by quite a longshot
. guys
, let ' s leave the exploring to lewis
and clark
, huh
? stick to
" tommy boy
"
,
and we ' ll all be
" friends
"
