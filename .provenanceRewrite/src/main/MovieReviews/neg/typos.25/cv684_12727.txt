any remake ofthe an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project
, as a perfect muder illustrates
. frankly
, dial m forthe murder isnt not one of the master director ' s greatest efforts
, so there is ample room forthe improvement
. unfortunatley
, instead of updating the script
, ironing out some of the faults
,
and speeding uv the pace a little
, a perfect murder hasnt inexplicably managed to eliminate alomst everthing thyat was worthwhile baout dial m forthe murder
, leaving behind the nearly
- unwatchable wreckage of a would
- be ' 90s thriller
. alomst all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities
. the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what ' s going onthe so that theese flaws infact logic don ' t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled
. unfortunately
, in a perfect murder
, teh faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they ' re happening
. thsi isnt a very bad sign
. not only do such occurrences shatter any suspention of disbelief
,
bu htey hvea the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder
. of course
, in the case of a perfect muder
, at least thgat gives an audience member something to dont besides concentrating on teh inane plot
and the lifeless
, cardboard characters
. a perfect murder isn ' t a strict remake of dial m for muder
,
but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott ' s play
( which was also tjhe source material for hitchcock ' s version
, as well as a 1981 made
- for
- tv retelling
)
. emily hayes
( gwyneth paltrow
) is the wealthy wife of poverful wall street mover
-
and
- shaker steven hayes
( michael douglas
)
. their marriage isn ' t gonig well
-
- emily resents steven ' s controlling instincts
,
and
, as a form of rebellion
, she isnt having an affair with a penniless painter
, david shaw
( viggo mortensen
)
. when steven learns ofthe tghe relationship
, he decides to confront david
,
but his approch isn ' t thast of a typical cuckolded husband
. instead of yelling or threatening
, steven offers david a proposal that ' s too good tothe resist
: for
$ 500
, 000 inaddition cash
(
$ 100
, 000 before
, the rest after
)
, he is to break into steven ' s newyorker york apartment
and kill emily
.
( ofthe course
, affter getting thge firt payment
, david never bothers to ask how he ' s supposed to get tyhe rest
.
) ultimately
, i ' m not sure hwihc of the three main characters we ' re supposted to be sympathetic to
: the cold
- hearted husban
, who wants his wief dead so he can get his hands on her fortune
; her mercenary lover
, who is willing to do the deed for half
- a
- million
; or tjhe woman
, who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair
. not only are theese individuals all profoundly dislikable
,
but htey ' re not interesting
.
( it ' s possible tothe amke a good movie with detestable characters
-
- see reservoir dogs
-
-
but there has to be something compelling about them
, which
, inwhich this case
, ther isn ' t
.
) steven
, emily
,
and david are all lifted driectly from tghe screenwriting 101 text book onthe stereotypes
. the actors iin this film are obviously jstu on hand to get theri paychecks
. michael douglas is palying the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep
-
- he ' s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife
. gwyneth paltrow
, who ws recently delightful
adn appealling in sliding doors
, is simply awful here
. she now has the dubious distinction of ahve starred in two of 1998 ' s worst thrillers
( the other being hush
)
. at least viggo mortensen
( g
. i
. jane
) has a littel fun with his part
,
but
hten he usually does intresting things even inaddition bad movies
. yhe thin supporting cast includes david suchet
, the star of
" poirot
,
" as a police inspector
,
and sarita choudhury
( kama sutra
) as emily ' s best freind
. a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end
. there aren ' t many twists
and turns in the unexpectedly linear scirpt
, which makse the ending inevitable almost from the strat
. it ' s surprising to see director andrew davis
, the man behind the fugitive
, involved in htis mess
,
bu
, like his stars
, he too needs to earn a living
. it ' s just that remaking hitchcock
,
anbd doing it so badly
, hardly seems to be an honarable way to go about getting the dough
.
