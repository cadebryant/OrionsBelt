plunkett
& macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott
, brother of ridley
and tony
. naturally
, this got me worried
. would jake ' s talent be inherited fomr ridley or tony
? if it ws from ridley
, tahn the movei would be a thoughtful suspensor whith acation thrown in
. if it was from tony
, it would be wham bang drivel
. unfortunatly
, hte latter is true for thsi worthless picture with littel charm
. carlyle
and miller are teh titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who is poor
and unruly
,
and captain james macleane
( miller
) a clean cut gentleman
. as the tagline claerly wants to mkae known
, they rob the rich
and nothing eles
. the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage
, along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot onthe both their tails isnt mr chance
( ken stott
) who wants to see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane is an annoying little film that serves littel purpose
.
although undoubtedly slick
anbd fast pased
, there ' s vyre little merit contained in the film
. carlyle
and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair
,
altough their charachters are criminally undeveloped
. it appears that much of tjhe money has been spended onthe thte expensive looking sets
and costumes
,
bu not on the script
. tyhe five
(
!
) screenwriters
( three credited
) have produced an still born movie
: there ' s vyer little development in the story
. also
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding out who plunkett
and macleane relaly are
, are so rushed that they barely happened
. the story is a bit of a mess
, frankly
. tyhe performances aren ' t bad
: carlyle
and miller are typical lads
,
bu liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest
. her irritable
, stilted performance sticks out liuke a sore thumb
,
annd i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on
. she looks nice
,
though
. moreso interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester
,
annd
although his character amounts to nothing more than a twpo dimensional comedy gay character
, he hams it up well
. ken stott is suitably evil as chance
,
bu agian he is nothing
but a flat chracter
. i didn ' t particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived
.
although a disappointment in writing
,
annd a minor success in acting
, hte film certainly look lavish
, with ogod costumes
,
and wonderful sets
.
but production design alone can ' t save a movie
, especially a movie as bad as tihs mess
. jake scott would be more suited tothe directing a music video rather thna this failed update of a period drama
: the only update seems tothe be teh fact that everyone must talk dirty
, iwth ' f
* ck this '
and ' stand
annd f
* cking deliver ' splattered all over the place
. yhe mtv editing
and direction are flash enough
,
bu in the end decidedly empty
. plunkett
& macleane isnt a massive disappointment
.
allthough somewhat enjoyable durig parts
, it ' s so light it sould folat off thge screen if it wasn ' t just images on a reel
. ther ' s no thought
, no development
, no plot
, just a series ofthe manic edits
and quirky camera angles tothe make this film appeal tothe gen
- xers
.
although it ' s a great idea
: update a period drama tothe tje mtv generation
: it ' s execution is awful
,
annd would more likely bore thna excite
. sloppy
adn occasionally off puttingly tasteless
, it ' s hard to recommend plunkett
& macleane as a movie
,
but easy tothe recommend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
