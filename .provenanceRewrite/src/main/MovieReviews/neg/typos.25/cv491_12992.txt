at one point in this movie htere is a staging of an opera that goes completelyl wrong
.
but one member ofthe the crowd stands uv
and cheers
, thikning the performance was planned
,
and applauding it forthe thier effords
. that ' s
" dirty work
" inaddition a nutshell
. a very different kind of movei
. this is not a movei that i can easily review
. the critic in me analyzes the sturcture
, plot
, acting
, characters
.
.
.
and tells me thsi movie is terrible
.
but the norm macdonald fan infront me had me rolling on tghe floor laughing
. this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie
. it ' s a one note concept
. mitch
and sam need
$ 50000 in order tothe bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant befoer other more needy patients
. realizing tehy are vyre good at revenge plots
, htey open a revenge for hire business
, eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald
( who affter roles infact
" hapyp gilmore
"
and
" veronica ' s closet
" seems typcast in this role
)
, who sends them to destroy a buiding that mitch learns is tje home of his girlfriend ' s grandmother
, thus leading them tothe plot aganist the rich businessman on the inght ofthe the grand opening of a new opera hous
. first the critic in me
. the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy divice
, where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way
. here ' s the catch
. none of thge characters are sympathetic
. they ' re all selfish jerks who don ' t care who they hurt in their attemts tothe do whatever they want
. tyhe jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealling to the worst elements in peple
. there ' s jokes baout prostitutes
, the homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. there ' s even a subplot that ' s developed
, it seems
, only to make jokes about infidelity
and incest
.
and i loved watching it
. i was a huge fan of norm macdonald ' s sarcastic
, to
- tghe
- point comedy on saturday night live
,
and this movie is an hour
adn a half of it
. norm macdonald tkaes a joke
, strips it to the core
,
and tells it like it is with a dry witn
. like the scene were he
and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job
. the foreman goes over thte basics
, which mitch
and sam don ' t understand
. how do they git out of it
? by admiting tehy lied on their resumes
,
and don ' t knwo a thign baout construction
!
and surprize
, they git fired
. the characters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. there ' s a father who ' s loud
and obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father ' s condition by saying
" if i were a gambling man i ' d put a lot ofthe monay on death
.
" the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky
,
and does who knows what with it
.
and
thn there ' s mitch
annd sam
, who
, thingking they cant get
$ 50000 by destroying a building
, ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents
.
" too bad we have to do it
,
" mitch says
. here ' s a movei where every joke that isnt executed as it is set uv
, where you see every punchline coming
, where every spot profanity could be used
and
then isnt utilisied
. at least the film is honest
,
annd makes no mistake that it is anytying more thna idiotic
.
but at least it isn ' t dull
,
and it isn ' t predictable
.
and that ' s tjhe way it should be
. it ' s sketch comedy
,
and if you ' re a fan of norm macdonald
, yuo ' ll lveo it
. yhe jokes are crude
, tghe characters are mean tothe tje core
, teh attitude of the movie is that it jsut doesn ' t care
. if you don ' t like norm macdonald
, or stupid movies
,
then you propably won ' t like this one
. the jokes are crude
, the characters are mean tothe the core
, the attitide of hte movie isnt thast it jstu doesn ' t care
. so befoer seeing this one
, tune your mindset
,
and prepare forthe a slew ofthe norm macdonald humor
, gay animal sex
, prision rape jokes
, uncaring characters
,
and one last performance from chris farley
. the critic in me says
(
*
)
but i give it an 8
(
*
*
*
)
. i just couldn ' t stpo laughing
.
