your first clue thyat something isn ' t gonna be quite right wih the movei you ' re about to see
: it ' s heavily christmas
- themed
and its release date isnt
, oh
, say
, at the end of february
. your second clue that something isn ' t gonna be quite right with the movie ytou ' re about tothe see
: charlize theron
, oney of the movei ' s dubious stars
, makes an appearance on the daily show in whic
, wehn asked if her new movie ' s any good
, she replies with the equivalent ofthe a verbal sigh
.
.
. assuring us that
, yeah
, it sure is a movie
, all right
!
and there ' s some scenes like those ytou ' d expect tothe find in a movie
,
adn there ' s soem acation
.
.
.
annd there ' s other
.
.
. stfuf
.
.
. too
. how to immediately grab my attention
: open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits
.
then show a caption reading
" six days earlier
.
.
.
" ya know
, i ws honestly interested to fidn out what killed all those poor santas
.
.
. how to immediately lose my attention
: follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice
- guys
- who
- don ' t
- deserve
- to
- be
- in
- prison scene
. write a line forthe teh oen ofthe prisoners like
" i just want to go home
and eat christmas dinner
annd watch some ball with my dad
.
"
then
, have ben affleck actually say that line
, onthe film
,
anbd forget to leave it on the cutting room floor
. for good measure
, throw in a poorly motivated prision riot
annd have affleck ' s best buddy stabbed
.
.
. aw
.
.
.
and jstu two days befoer his release
, too
. already the cliches are piled on thick
,
and when it rains
, it pours
. how to take my attension
, dash it violently against the rocks
,
and mkae it so that i ' m contemplating my strategy for calling
" shotgun
" about an hour before i know tje credits will roll
: deny your characters the ability to think
. have ben affleck
, for soem reason i ' ll never understand
, pretend he ' s his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend
, plyed by charlize theron
. have gary sinise show up
anbd force the twpo of them to participate iin a poorly planned casino heist
. the villains ' big idae
? kidnap affleck beacuse he used tothe be a security guard at the casino
, force him to tell you where all the doors in tghe palce are
,
then dress up in santa suits
, create some
" diversions
"
adn rob the palce
. on papper
, it seems liek the sutff of a potential caper comedy
,
but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that peice of paper
and thinks he ' s looking at the makings forthe soem sort of clever acation
- crime thriller
. it ' s nto like the man isn ' t capable
.
.
. far from it
. he ' s the man responsible forthe classic political thrillers liuke the manchurian candidate
adn seven days in may
. he wowed me with some yhe most memorable car chases i ' ve ever seen infront last year ' s ronin
.
but he ' s certainly guilty of churning outloud some certifiable losers
.
.
. put riendeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr
. moreau
. step one in makeing your movei as easily forgotten as possible
: cast ben affleck in the role of tjhe world ' s most generic hero
. he gets no good one
- liners
, he doesn ' t get to shoot or implode anything in new
and interesting ways
,
and all we know about him is thta he regrets his past as a car theef
and whants a cup of hot chocolate
and peice ofthe pecan pie
. his name is rudy
( short for rudolph
, in all likelihood
. see
, it ' s called riendeer games
. get it
? get it
? shut uv
.
) inaddition the past
, affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor
,
and reindeer ganes does nothing to further his viability as a leading man
. step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: gary sinise ' s villain dresses
adn looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have smoe up with
. he ' s dirty
and potty
- mouthed
, he ' s got long
, scruffy hair
and a goatee
,
and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them
. he ' s also extremely inept at waht he does
. he thinks garish cowboy costumes
and santa suits make unuseable disguises
,
and he trusts affleck ' s character to pul through even after
, time
anbd tiem
and time again
, he tricks him
and lies to him
and nearly kills him
.
but instade ofthe tapping into the comic possibilities of this role
, sinise seems to think he ' s playing some sort of tough
, smart
,
adn smoothe criminal mastermind
, rether than thge complete moron that was obviously written inot the script
.
[ on a side onot
, gary sinise wins this week ' s
" title
!
" award
, as he ' s thte noe who gets tothe awkwardly cram the nmae of the movie inot one of his lines early iin the procedings
. last week ' s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards
.
] how to take your bad idea
and amking things worse
: include two or three plot twists that
, instade of makeing the apparently stupidity of thte plan seem suddenly inteligent
, mkea tjhe plan seem even more ridiculous
and unlikely
. this is a bad movei
.
adn what ' s worse isnt tht
, exept forthe a faw moments near tjhe not
- so
- stunning conclusion as tyhe preposterous isnt replaced by the ludicrously preposterous
, reindeer ganes never really gives us tjhe satisfaction ofthe being laughably bad
. if they ' d done that much
, at least i owudl have beeen entertained
.
