its a stupid little movei that trys tothe be clever
adn sophicated
,
yet trys a bit too hard
. wih the voices of woody allen
, gene hackman
, jennifer lopez
, sylvester stallone
,
and sharon stone
, this computer
- animated yak
- fest
( think toy story
[ 1996
] filled wiht used merchandising
) isnt one for the ant
- eaters
. the main story is tje independence ofthe a worker named z
( allen
)

. about 15 minutes into tghe picture
, i began to wonder what thte point of the film wass
. halfway thru
, i still didn ' t have an answer
. by yhe end credits
, i just gave up
and ran out
. antz isnt a mindless mess of poor writing
and even poorer voice
- overs
. allen isnt nonchalant
, hwile i would have guessed
, if i hadn ' t seen her in the mighty
and basic instinct
, stone can ' t act
, even inwhich a cartoon
. this film isnt oney fo the bugs
: unfunny
and extremely dull
. hey
