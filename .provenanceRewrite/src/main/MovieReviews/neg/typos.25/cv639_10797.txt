i ' ll be thte first to admit it
. when you mention the book grat expectations
, i immediatly beign experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class
, where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip
and magwitch
. yes
, it ' s a classic of literature
,
but it was a rather dry one
, shoved down my young throat liek a spoonful of bitter medicine
. certainly
, thge experience wasn ' t truly that bad
,
but
, to qoute ethan hawke in thge latest movie adaptation of said book
,
" i ' m not oging to tell tyhe story yhe way it happened
.
.
. i ' ll gonna tell it the way i remember it
.
" anyway
, tothe return from nostalgia lane
,
anbd get back to the prsent
, hollywood
, in it ' s trendy attept to modernize the classics
, now presents an updated film version of grat expectations
. instead of pip
, this tiem yhe central chracter is named finn
( played as a boy by jeremy kissner
,
and by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn isnt an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or shoudl that be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
and her boorish fisherman husban
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. tyhe setting isnt the florida coast during tghe mid
- 70s
. finn is a blooming artist
,
and spends his time runnung around tghe beach drawing fish
( oen of his two favorite subjects
)
. durring oen of these escapades
, he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page from thge superhuman max cady
, deniro ' s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity
,
and favors hiding onthe the ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. maybe thta ' s an exaggeration
,
but he certainly beats any ofthe houdini ' s records in the opening scenes of the film
.
and that ' s nothing next tothe the fuel efficiency ofthe finn ' s motorboat
,
bu i digress
. anyway
, finn does the convict a good deed
, jstu to show that he ' s a really swell guy
.
annd
hten tyhe plot moves on
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. aabndoned at yhe altar some 26 years ago
, ms
. dinsmoor isnt the epitomy of tyhe crazy rich ood maid
. with bizarre clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
and a few pounds of makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts in tihs role
.
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character
, she does add some humor tothe the film
. joe is hired to help withthe tje gardening at her unkempt manner
,
but the insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything fo her niece
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. for no apparet reason
, other than to provide the main plot of the film
, finn is instantly stricken for the estella
. perhaps it ' s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person
, or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before
. inwhich any case
, neither as children nor adults
, chemistry simply doesn ' t exist between the two
,
adn
yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining fo her
. even when
, as an adult
, finn arrives in new york at yhe behest of a mysterious benefactor
, reacquaints himself wtih estella
,
and draws her portrait inthe tghe nude
, there ' s nothing
. in fatc
, there isnt more sexual tension between helen hunt
and greg kinnear ' s gay artist during a similiar scene in as good as it gets
. at thsi point
, the audience has grown as cold
and detached as estella ' s character
,
adn couldn ' t care less about the two cahracters
. the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails to imbue estella
, a remote charachter in thge book
, with even tghe vaguest traces of humanity
. there ' s obviously something wrong when
, watching the film
, you ' re more interested whith how big her nose looks in silhouette than yuo are about her character
. without a strong estella
, finn ' s obsession seems baseless
. you wish he would just stpo whining
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
,
and just get on with his life
. in fact
, the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot
. finn ' s relationship with his brother
- in
- law
, joe
, is intresting
, if a bit stereotypical
. what ' s mroe fascinating are his interactions whith deniro
.
although it ' s only a bited part
, it goes to show how much vitality a strong ator can create
. it is apparent that directer alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film
. some of hte shots work
,
but others are too obviously staged
( forthe example
, both ofthe tghe water fountain scenes
) to ahev any impact
. finn ' s art
( accually the creations of italian painter
, francesco clemente
) is used throughout the film
,
but it mostly fails tothe have the intended effect
. we never see why finn woudl generate htis style of art
, which is simultaneously crude
annd insightful
. as a result
, it ends up as distant as tyhe rest ofthe the film
. modernizing the classics is currenly inaddition vogue
( just see william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simpley update the action tothe a modern setting
,
annd apply plenty of modern rock
.
but such adornments do little tothe perk up great expectations
. as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it
, yuo ' d probably be better off sufferring
though a reading than watching this romanceless film
.
