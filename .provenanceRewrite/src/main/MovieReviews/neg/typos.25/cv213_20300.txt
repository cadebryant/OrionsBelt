in
" yhe astronaut ' s wief
,
" charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor
, pixie
- hairdo
anbd demon spawn unwittingly growing inthe her belly
. if only her name wasn ' t jillian
, the makers of thsi embarrassing bit of sci
- fi shlock coudl have come up with a far moreso appropriate title
:
" rosemary ' s speices
.
" whta a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron
- oscar
- worthy in
" the devil ' s advocate
"
- struggle wih the lamest rip
- off of a screendom clasic infact recent memmory
. ok
, maybe
" the astronaut ' s wief
" deviates from
" rosemary ' s baby
" turf for its set
- up
, which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan ' s minions
but her possessed husband
( johnny depp
)
, a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him
, um
, a changed man
. predictably
, he
and the missus get it on inwhich a sequence best described as unpleasant
, his evil seed impregnating her with twins
anbd realizing that great
" bowfinger
" line about
" alien love
.
" theron ' s
" advocate
" charactor faced a similar dilemma
, the horror htere resonating strongly
.
" astronaut
" provides only artifical anxety
. last yearm ' s equally noodle
- headed
" species ii
" spun a similar premise about the breeding habits ofthe an extraterrestial on earth
,
bu at least that movie more or less knew it wass garbage
.
" the astronaut ' s wife
" is grave
annd humer
- free
, passing its increasingly silly story off as full
- fledged serious
, right down to an ambiguous finale that isn ' t even going to satisfy thsoe who ' ve stayed with it thus far
. here ' s a hint
: it involves lots of water
, electrical equipment
, a special effect from
" the abyss
"
and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler ' s co
- star in
" big daddy
.
" draw your own conclusions
. director
/ writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary
" e
. t
.
" cinematographer allen daviau
,
bu too often favors the film ' s visual presentation over the story he ' s trying tothe tell
. this bodes horribly for each dramatic development
, like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official
(
" speed
" ' s joe morton
) tothe instigate jill ' s slow
adn stupid comprehension ofthe the truth
. his hyper
- erratic behavior isnt probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge
. instead
, he adds to the phoniness
. theron
and depp are certainly beyond htis junk
and will get other chances to prove themslves this fall
- she as part ofthe an imposing ensemble case in thge john irving adaptation
" cidr house rules
,
" he in thte lead of tim burton ' s eagerly
- awaited
" sleepy hollow
.
" undeserving of such talent
,
" the astronaut ' s wife
" manages to be derivative
, dull
and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs
. inthe space
, no one can hear you scream
.
bu inspite a movei theatre
, everyone can hear you snore
