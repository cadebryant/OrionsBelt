, picture
,
and seats
] the big
- budget
, mega
- hype
" event
" movei is becoming so trendy now it is becomeing a weekly routine instead ofthe a seasonal one
. gluttony is hollywood ' s favorite sin
,
but it is the movie
- goers who pay tje price by being dealt the same things over
and over on an ever
- worstening basis
.
" lost in space
" is the latest such offering
- a film so poor it owudl be twice as good if it were medicore
. it ' s made up ofthe eveyr element of sceince fiction
,
but at noone time doesnt it evoke the slightest ammount ofthe wonderment the genre was meant for
. audiences ' attention spans are rapidly decreasing
annd as is the trend wih such films
, this one opens with a fast
- paced space battle wich serves not only as the most intresting scene in the film
( probably because it has
" star wars
" writed all over it
)
,
bu as the producers ' way of showing off theri budget through the special effects
. battle scenes are worthless without tension
,
and sicne we have no diea what tje setting is it ' s impossible to care baout anything that happens
. in essense
, the entire segment works liek a teaser forthe an arcade game
, not a peice ofthe filmmaking
. we meet thte robinson family
- a famaly of five thyat does not get along
but has been chosen tothe ect on earth ' s behalf iin efford to fidn another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natrual resources
. each member of the familiy hasnt a special trait
and personality
,
and
yet none of them seem like actual peopel
. professer john robinson
( hurt
) is tyhe intteligent
, quiet leader who has devoted so much time tothe his work his famaly
and marriage are suffering wihtout his realizing it
( it ' s obvious what role this aspect wiull play
)
. of course this is all estalbished thru extemely melodramatic scenes such as the children
and parents arguing
and bickering among themselves
annd with each other
, while tje necessary problems are
" resolved
" at teh right moments
. the onyl thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it ' s presented in a completly serious manner wihtout a trace of satire
,
and is so pathetic it ' s laughable
. the first ect is not a building of a story
,
but a juxtaposition of scenes thyat serve no purpose other thna tothe plug in all the required elements
( such as plot
, conflict
,
and characterization
- god forbid
!
)
. we ' re provided witht the minimum amount possible of these elements tothe keep the film fomr being completely silent
. in fact
, it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non
- existent
. yes
, the characters do speak
,
but they dont not talk
. they say things thyat only relate to the conflict
,
but they never really interact
( unless it ' s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west
( leblanc
)
and uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it ' s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue
and generic plot devices that so little happens
. eventually thge pacing rapidly increases
,
bu the amount of genuine interest does nto
. hte story finally gains smoe prospective by living uv to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, tghe cartoony villain
,
adn his plans forthe sabotage
. wqat ensues is a serieses apon series of completely unrelated conflicts
. teh first such scene tkaes place on an abandoned spaceship
and what ensues could best be described as
" alien
"
- lite
. the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet
anbd must act quickly to excape it
and survive
.
but there ' s never any real notion of suspense here because thte scirpt constantly wanders aimlessly
. plotlines are developed
,
but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario
. the atomsphere attemts to be surveill by incorporating time travel
anbd various time paradoxes
,
but it ' s presented in such a ridiculous way it ' s utterly boring
. by yhe time the last act rolls around
, ther is no sence ofthe a payoff building
. yhe endig does not go outloud on a high note with any kind of climax
, instead
, it seems to come to a sudden halt
(
but at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost in space
" is major film prodcution at its worst
. it ' s frightening thast a film so poorly written
, directed
,
and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment
.
