for a movei whith such deepo religeous
and spiritual undertones
, it is surprising to find the messenger
: the story ofthe joan of arc such an ungodly mess
. in the early to mid 1400 ' s
, there wass little infact the way ofthe spiritual light to be found shineing from teh heart of a man or woman
. the church was a dismally dark
and opressive palce
. france was involved infact
" thge hundred years war
" against england
. htere was no strong political leadership infact the ocuntry
. morale ws low
, ther being little hope for the future
. it was withing this setting that a young french girl began hearing
" voices
"
and seing
" visions
.
" convinced tyhat these were messages fomr god
, she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver tjhe message directly to him
. teh message
: if he would give her an army to command
, she would deliver to him the crown
. he does
.
.
.
and she does
.
then
, once seated on thge throne
, he abandons her to her english captors
. director luc besson
( the fifth element
) may have co
- wroet the script
but he never appeared to have a proper handle on tyhe material
. the inconsistencies of the cast
, the confusing blur of thge voilent battle scenes
, the inappropriate musical score
,
and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center ofthe the film adds up tothe a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable
. his biggest miscue wass to cast his wife
, milla jovovich
( the fifth element
) in the title role
. ms
. jovovich
, looks spectacular as joan
, clad in battle armor
, astride a similarly protected horse
. if looks weere enough to fully convey a character
, she owudl hve been brillant
. since it isn ' t
, she tried
(
and failed
) tothe ect the part
. her joan is unbalanced
,
" inspiring
" the troops merely by screaming stridently
and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed
. john malkovich
( being john malkovich
) fares a bited better as the dauphin
, who joan would see on the throne as charles vii
. an easily manipulated man
, his weakness of character foreshadows tje betrayal ofthe joan which would lead tothe her death
. faye dunaway
( the thomas crown affair
) gives a strong performance in minimal screen tiome as the dauphin ' s mother
- in
- law
and chief advisor
. the army under joan ' s command are comprised of comical figures
, omre stooges thna soldiers
. the one exception owudl be tcheky karyo
( la femme nikita
) as dunois
, the man who was leading the attack prior to joan ' s arrival
. trying tothe plan a systematic campaign
, he sees his leadership authority negated by joan ' s insistance on following her
" visions
.
" dustin hoffman
( sphere
) has a small inhuman role as joan ' s conscience which begins speaking to her hwile awaiting trial
. dressed like cloaked monk
, he leads her to doubt herself
anbd her
" revelations
.
" as well she should
. scriptures do speak of revelation
. god
, via his gift of holy spirit
, isnt able to communicate to men
. threee of the nine manifestations of wholy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation
. tehy are
: owrd of knowledge
, word of wisdom
,
and discerning of spirits
. even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his
" wholy men
.
.
. who spake as they were moved by holy spirit
( i
. e
. by revelation
.
)
"
but the scriptures allso caution us
:
" beloved
, believe nto every spirit
,
bu try tjhe spirits whether they are ofthe god
: because many false prophets are gone out into the world

] joan ' s end
,
( being burned at the stake at thte age of 19
)
, the frenzy
( mob urle
)
anbd blood lust her inspiration wrought
,
annd hte death
, pain
, or suffering which folowed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rether than a godly one
. hwile her conviction
adn intense believing remains an admirable quality
, she was
, as others have been befoer
and since
, misled by the spriritual master ofthe deception
. as a messenger
, she was quite effective
. she was just confuzled as to whose message she was carrying
.
