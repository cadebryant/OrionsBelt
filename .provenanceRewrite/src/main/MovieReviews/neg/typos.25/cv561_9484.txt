i looked at the
" internet movie database
" ' s awards section for htis film
,
and found that this was nominated for a golden globe fo
" best picture
( drama
)
.
" anyone who ' s seen this film cxan back me up on this
: this is tyhe worst ofthe the
" great
" disaster films
,
anbd that ' s nto relaly saying a lot forthe this film
.
" earthquake
" is basically noteable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured
. on video
, it ' s a bland
and slow
- moving film whitch gives us a bunch of different characters
( the disaster film requisite
)
,
then brings them together in thge struggle against the big disaster
. while this worked in
, say
,
" thge towering inferno
,
" it doesn ' t here for noe single reason
: we don ' t care about any of the characters
. the film gives us charlton heston
( inaddition one ofthe many crap 70s films he made
, including
" skyjacked
"
and that clasic
,
" soylent green
"
) as a rich man married tothe ava gardner
, who isnt having a little affair with a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade police officer on suspension
( george kennedy
, in his least humored performance
)
; in the second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right aftter his
" shaft
" thing
) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track tath goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
;
adn the weirdest subplot
: a military man
/ bag boy at a grocery store who has a littel thing for buxom victoria principal
,
and eventually gets vengence on thsoe guys who made fun of his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. inaddition smaller subplots
, there ' s a pointless bit baout peopel who are flying over l
. a
.
( the city in the film
, by the way
)
, one who ' s palying cards
anbd marryied to a boring non
- acting husband
( you think this one can go nowhere
? guess agina
. he gets interested in the fianl frames
)
; there ' s genieveve bujold ' s moron son
, who has a littel adventure with wires
;
and for some much
- needed comedy
, there ' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- the only laugh in the film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who ' s big moment is a dance he does at a critical time
. as for the actual
" earthquake
,
" it ' s rather a let
- down
. there ' s a full hour of character
- setups
, none of which is interesting
,
then about 10 minutes of shaking
, crumbling
,
and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. htis film needed that hwole theatre
- shaking
: tehy needed to wake everybody up because they were so borde
. there ' s little suspense following the quake
,
altough this film trys for it
. there ' s an adventure in a crumbling high
- rise office building
, the wires with the kid
,
and the movement of people who are all injured
.
but none of these are all
- too suspenseful
. tjhe finale with tjhe heston
/ gardner
/ bujold love triagle is ended in a basic flip
- of
- the
- coin bit
, which brings outloud a big let
- down
.
and there ' s no rela finale
. even
" volcano
" ended nicely
,
adn that movei really sucked
. nto only is it hokey
,
but you don ' t care about any charactor
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
(
although i would have chosen gardner
, mailny onthe the basis that she can atcually act
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if that idiat kid falls to his death on some wires
?
and who cares about that whole plane spiel
? if anytying
,
" earthquake
" is worth a viewing forthe the same reason
" glen or glenda
?
" is
. i mean
, i laughed at this more than i did at
" bio dome
.
"
but that ' s another story
(
and review
)
. in short
,
" earthquake
" gives disaster pics a bad name
.
