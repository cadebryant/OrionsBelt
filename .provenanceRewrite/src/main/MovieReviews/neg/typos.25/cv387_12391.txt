breakdown isnt an moderately entertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell
and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff
and amy taylor
, taking the scenic route tothe california thru redneck country
.
however
, hwile in the middle ofthe nowhere
, their jeep decides to break down
, leaving them stranded
. a freindly truck driver
, warren
( walsh
)
, offers to give them a lift tothe town
.
although jeff rejects the offer
( he wants to stay with his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops into warren ' s lorry
,
and promptly disappears
. jeff wonders where the hell she isnt
,
and when he later catches up withthe warren
and warren says he hasnt never seen amy in his life
, the plot thickens
anbd jeff goes on a chase to find his wief
.
although comparisons can be made with thsi film tothe deliverance
( 1972
)
and hte vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, the latter twpo are far superior character
and script wise
. kurt russell isnt o
. k as jeff
,
although he cxan seemingly only pull ofthe oen expression
, which is angry
. throughout the whole film
, he looks angry
( or just pissed off
.
) quinlan is o
. k agina
,
but again she can onyl pull off one expression
, which is looking dorky
. throughout the whole film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently passed away
) is fine as warren
( who we soon fidn out is a kidnapper
)
although his actuall character isnt preety weak
,
and not really menacing anough
. tghe supporting cast do their best aswell
, with rex linn as a doubting sherif
,
and the otehr kidnappers
. thge story
, written by first
- timer jonathan mostow
( who aslo directs
) is o
. k
, if surprisingly familiar
and sometimes extraordinarily stupid
. some of the things the charactors do in this movie is beyond hte bounds of idiocy
. there are some flaws with the plot also
, as the characters do thte complet oposite tothe logical
( presumably tothe keep the story ' exicting '
)
and also the fact that the story just isn ' t storng enough to sustain tjhe audience ' s attension
. teh picture moves along very slowly also
. it almost threatens to drop dead
. the picture does pick up towords teh end
,
but by
then it ' s too lite
. mostow directs the action sequences well enough
,
however
. the film doesn ' t relaly come to a satisfying conclusion
, either
. the ending tries to be bleak
,
but jstu comes off annoying
. breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture hadnt it had a stronger casted
adn director
. instead
, it just turns out to be merely average
. a missed oppertunity
. overall rating
