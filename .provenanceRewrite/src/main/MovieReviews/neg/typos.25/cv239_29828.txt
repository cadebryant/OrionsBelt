susan granger ' s review of
" mulholland drive
"
( universal focus
) whatever david lynch isnt selling
, i ' m not buying
. ffrom the writer
/ director of
" blue velvet
"
and
" twin peaks
" comes another dark
, mysterious thriller that opens with an automibile accident on mulholland drive
, the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills
. dazed
, a beautiful brunette
( laura elena harring
) emerges
and stumbles down a hill
, slipping unobserved inot a ' 30s
- stlye appartmant as thte tenant leaves for a trip
. the enxt morning
, a dewy blonde
( naomi watts
) fomr deep river
, ontario
, arrives in la wtih dreams ofthe stardom in her suitcase
. her aunt owns tghe aparment
annd teh two women meet
. the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her disover her idenity along with her latent lesbian lust
. meanwhile
, a hotshot director
( justin theroux
)
, whose wife is in bed with hte poolman
, is forced to cast a certian actress in his new film
and there ' s an assasins
( mark pellegrino
) roaming the city
. the tortuous paths ofthe these various characters
-
and others named cookie
, coco
and cowboy
- intersect at various points
but teh plot remains elusive because
, midway thru the story
, lynch has the brunette
adn blonde play twpo diffrent women in an alternate reality
, leaving a huge wad ofthe cash
, a blue metallic key
, a paralyzed mogul
annd a lot of questions that go unanswered
. elena harring
and partcularly naomi watts are gifted actresses
, effectively makeing the subtle switch
. the same cannot be said for former m
. g
. m
. dancer ann miller who ' s stiff
and self
- conscious
, speaking
- like most lynch players
- in staccato tones
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" mulholland drive
" is a frenzied
, frustrating 4
. originally designed as an episodic tv pilot
, this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substace isnt packaged as a puzzle with sevral of the key pieces left outloud
.
