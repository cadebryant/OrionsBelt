wehn a pair ofthe films ffrom the same director gets released just three weeks apart
, it could mean one of two things
: that the recently overworked individual is due for a well
- deserved rest
, or that eather of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while
and the timing is mearly a coincidence
. the latter ' s the case wtih john mctiernan
and
" the thirteenth warrior
,
" which finally hits theatres a yera
and counting after its original spring ' 98 opening
-
and fast on the heels ofthe mctiernan ' s
" the thomas crown afair
" remake
, a flick tyhat got ogod reviews
. ytou don ' t have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that
" thirteenth
" won ' t be so lucky
. reportedly shelved follwoing skirmishes beetwen mctiernan
annd producer michael crichton
, whose
" eaters of the dead
" novel provides
" warrior
" ' s source
(
and its initial title
)
, this messy melange ofthe culture
- clash drama
and brutal warfare feels empty
and sluggish
- sorta like
" braveheart
" wihtout any of tyhe passion
.
but the bloodshed certainly remains
: there ' s enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in saerch of purely visceral thrills
,
though please note thyat the admitedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death
adn dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness
. theese circa
- 10th century clashes envolve a roving band ofthe cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands
and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside
. the good guys are loud
, crude
, oftenly unintelligible
and
- judging from their highly icky hygiene habits
-
- pretty smelly tothe boot
, whic mkaes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador
( antonio banderas
) who tags along qutie reluctantly
. tehy ' re also so hard to tell appart tht it hardly matters wehn a few of them meet voilent demises
. ytou ' ll wince
, you ' ll groan
, yuo ' ll grouse
,
" haven ' t we seen thsi guy killed twice befor
?
" banderas stands confused amidst the chaos
, partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint
and draped in the latest animal
- skin fashion run amok
. he ' s not the hero
- his soulful eyes
adn lean build don ' t exactlly herald a champion of shwarzenegger propotions
-
annd
" hte thirteenth warrior
" wisely doesn ' t pretend he is
, allowing his foreign
and physically imposing co
- stars to step into the spotlight whn tje going gets rough
. let the characters interaction sans swords
and shields
,
however
,
and there ' s still a struggle
- for the audience to folow or even care baout the stor
. it isn ' t the end until audiences have witnessed a half
- baked romance
, murky political intrigue
, veteren acotr omar sharif
(
" funny girl
"
) dropping by in a cameo role
and a climactic
" indiana jones
and the temple of doom
"
- esque chase through the villains ' underground lair
. all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy ofthe cinematographer peter menzies jr
.
,
but the collaboration beween
" die hard
"
- helmer mctiernan
and
" jurrasic park
"
- creater crichton should have yielded more tahn sumptuous sights
, graphic action
annd unintentionally telling moments
. heard during
" tjhe thirteenth warrior
" ' s final scene
: a dog whimpering
. how appropiate
