. for most
, it ' s a time to be wtih your loved ones
and enjoy a good
, home
- cooked meel
. for the makers ofthe body count
,
however
, thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders
, violence
, profanity
, family dysfunction
,
anbd sex
. boy
, do i efel all tjhe more better having sat through this crap
. alyssa milano

?
, matures to made
- for
- video sludge like this movie

- t
, who hasnt since guest
- starred in the made
- fo
- the
- sci
- fi
- channel sories welcome to paradox
. this isn ' t exactly a winning combination
. outside of permenantly ruining a holiday for me
, what else may be said fo this trkey
? well
, it teaches us that beautiful
, attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed
anbd complain about being english teachers
. it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic
, stuck
- up rich white people waited on by black servants
. it shows us thgat ood guys
, try not tothe laugh
, sit around
and talk about
" the appeal of postmodernism
" during their free time
.
and
, it proves that yuo can ahev sex in your parents ' basement wehn htey ahve a dozen or so guests over
,
and no oen will notice
. befor i go any furhter
, if any young male reading this has hopes ofthe seeing alyssa naked
, forget it
. the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you don ' t see any of milano ' s attributes
. they dont
,
however
, inexplicably throw inspite a scene where ice
- t whistles
" jingle bells
" affter killing people
, for whatever that ' s worth
. this film was originally titled below utopia
. perheaps they should have renamed it hell
. avoid this clunker
.
