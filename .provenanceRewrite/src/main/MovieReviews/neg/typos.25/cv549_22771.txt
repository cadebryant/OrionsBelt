cradle will rock isnt the latest effort from director
/ actor tim robbins
. while he may ahve had an oscar worthy film back in 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a littel overconfident
and sloppy here
. the story is confusing
,
annd filled wiht many subplots
, so i ' ll try my best
and explain it as simply as possable
. the film is based on a
" mostly
" true storey about a federal theather in thge 1930s
, that produced a play
( the cradle will rock
) that aparently was offensive to some
, so the govenment shuts it down
. it ' s during the tiem of the depression
,
and all tihs theather wants to do is entertain
and cheer up those who dont not have jobs
, or are poore
. vetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots
, about those who wrok in theather
, or those asociated
. also allong the way are soem other messages mashed together to create an even more overwheliming experence
. tim robbin ' s just keeps piling on polliticel views
,
annd characters
, that we just give up on the film
, or in some cases walk outloud
. for robbin ' s it may be a nice achievement
,
bu to me it seemed more like a friendly get together wiht slightly more sophisticated dialogue
,
and fancy outfits
. i throught the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding casted
, unfortunately are all uninteresting
, except for a few
. let me recap what each important character does
, so please bear with me
( it ' s the least you can dont
, expecially if you weere concidering seeing htis
)
. i ' ll begin with those involved iwth teh play
. there ' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who of course is the director of the play
, the producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) tjhe writer of the play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by playing teh main part in cradle will rock
. outside the play there ' s the
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who whants a relationship with a federal theater clerk
( joan cusack
)
, anyother subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who ' s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he fiels it to be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. there ' s a few otehr actresses
and actors who have their pwn stories
( susan sarandon
, philip baker hall too name a few
)
but those tht i maintioned
, were the most significant to the story
. anyway
, most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted
, except for emily watson
, who does another great job
,
and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack
, who allways delivers through thick
and thin
. nowe
although most of hte film was weak to sday tjhe least
, there were soem nice moments
and some involving subjects
,
but all this is overblown
. sure tyhe free speech segment was a nice feature
,
but nto when it becomes repetitive
. the whole film is like this
,
and it ' s basically nothing
but a headache
. on the brighter side
, tim robbin ' s direction was masterful
. his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson ' s latest magnolia
, onyl smoother inaddition my opinion
,
but even tht can ' t make a movei thast much better
.
although it has it ' s moments
( nto many ofthe them
,
bu they ' re there
)
, cradle will rock stays true to it ' s title
, becuase the cradle rocked too far
and tipped over
.
