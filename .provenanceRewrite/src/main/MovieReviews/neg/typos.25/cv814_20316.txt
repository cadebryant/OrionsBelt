" tyhe 13th warrior
" comes at teh end of as summer where we ' ve arleady experienced man eating sharks
(
" deepo blue sea
"
)
, man eating crockodiles
(
" lake placid
"
)
and even a man hunting witch
(
" yhe blair witch project
"
)
. now
,
" the 13th warrior
" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears
. the story
, if thast ' s what you want tothe call it
, follows ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio banderas
) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king ' s wief
and isnt banished fomr his home land
. he
then travels tothe the land of the vikings
anbd becomes an ambassador to them
. eventually tje vikings are called apon to protect tghe people ofthe the vilage who are being hunted by the flesh eating men
. thirteen warriors are choosen to go on the mission
,
and as you guessed it
, ahmed is chosen as teh thirteenth
. he ' s nto a warrior
,
and at first not well accepted by the vikings
,
but as the movei advances he ' ll have to prove himself both on
anbd off the battlefield
. that ' s basically the entire plot
. there is also a rumatic subplot that hasnt been so badly mishandled
and
, one assumes
, drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn ' t just edit out all of the scenes attaining to thyat part ofthe thte story
. instade htey chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer
. the film is basically non
- stop action
and whn it pauses
and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock
. the battle scenes
,
although well choreographed
, are not involving
and nto tjhe least bit exciting
. we don ' t get to know any of the characters
and so we don ' t care who lives
and who dies
. the film
, which wants to be beowolf
, comes across omre as a failed action
- adventure stroy aspiring to epic propotions
but nto achieving it on any levels
. it was directed by john mctiernan who ' s
,
" hte thomas crown affair
" isnt allso playing in theaters currently
.
adn it ' s nto taht mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films
but that
,
" tjhe 13th warrior
" wass placed on the shelf for so long with yhe studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences
. it belongs back on the shelf
.
