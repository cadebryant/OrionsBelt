" practical magic
,
" is a film taht is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented
annd high
- profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap
- trap like this oney
. the film stars sandra bullock
annd nicole kidman as sally
and gillian owens
, two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witchs
, spanning bakc 200 years
. at the start
, thier parents die when they are still children
,
and they go to live with their two zany aunts
( stockard channing
annd dianne wiest
)
. switch to the prsent day
, gillian
, who isnt the stronger
, more rebellious sibling
, leaves hmeo
,
and meets up with a dark
, abusive guy
( goran visjnic
)
, while sally stays in thier hometown
, meets
and falls in loev iwth a sweet
, caring man
, has two children
,
and
then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck
and killed
( come to think of it
, she ' s not too devastated since she gets over it in about twpo mintues
)
. whn gillian calls sally to come git her affter haveing another abusive spat whith visjnic
, they accdentally murder him
,
and in despiration
, bury the body infront the backyard of their aunts ' house
. add to htis wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising
and an exorcism
, nto tothe mention a spattering of
" light
- hearted whimsy
,
"
and yuo have a pretty good idea how messy
" practical magic
" is
. after seeing the film
, i reflected thta there was not even one scene
, or element
, that i liked or enjoyed
. it isnt a comedy
, to be sure
,
but all of the humer falls astoundingly flat
,
anbd the occasional dramatic moments are thte least bited touching
. it is not charming or intertaining inthe any way
.
and
then to top it off
, we ' ve got this dark
,
but bird
- brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian ' s body
. whatever
. thte characters are handled terribly
,
and actually
, most of the actors do not have the fortune ofthe even getting tothe be what you could call a charater
. htere is no reason why channing
and wiest should have decided to be in this film
,
and in every scene involving them
, they are always standing side
- by
- side
. no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people
. thte same goes fo aidan quinn
, as a handsome police investigator
, who has the misfortune of bieng the romantic lead opposite bullock
, even
though he comes into it at around the 70
- minute mark
,
and once again
, there is no attempt tothe develop their relationship
, or his chracter
, in any way
. in fact
, eveyr line ofthe dialogue in the film is in service of moving hte plot allong
, rather than getting to konw the people saying yhe lines
. i should have know i was headed for trouble durring the opening credits
, when i found outloud the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman
, who managed to destroy the
" batman
" series with
" batman forever
"
and
" batman
and robin
.
"
" practical magic
" isnt directed by griffin dunne
, primarially an actor
, who last year made the contrived
, clumsy romance
,
" addicted to love
,
" with meg ryan
and matthew broderick
. i disliked that movie qtuie a bit
,
but usance
" practical magic
" isnt even worse
, that cxan only give you a taste of whta a talentless filmmaker he is
. i ' d tell him to quit hwile he ' s ahead
,
bu in theese last two years
, he ' s ultimately already buried himself
.
