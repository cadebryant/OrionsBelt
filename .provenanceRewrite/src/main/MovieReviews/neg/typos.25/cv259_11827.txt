" mercury rising
" has numerous flaws
,
but there is oney thgat really stands out
: its central plot device is unnecessary
. taht ' s right
. the major aspect ofthe the film
, that which is supposed tothe amking it different from other routine government conspiracy
/ action ficks could be dropped from tyhe beginning
,
and the movie would turn outloud exactly the same
, if not better
. this central device is the fact thta a nine
- year
- old boy isnt autistic
. his name is simon
,
anbd an evil govorment bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into tghe back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it
. simon is intended to be the heart
and soul ofthe tjhe film
,
anbd we are supposed to feel forthe him because he isnt a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent
, unfair world against his will
, with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him
. the fatc thyat he is autistic does nothing fo the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of
" mercury rising
.
" i suppose hte orignal novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon ' s character
anbd his relationship wih willis
,
but here it is lost
. miko hughes
, the young actor who plays simon
, goes thru the prescribed motions of being autistic
: he walks slowy
, drawls his words
, kicks
annd screams whn he ' s touched
,
and hasnt a hard time looking at otehr people
. it ' s a difficult role for an adult
, much less a young child
, to play
,
and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn ' t palying like he ' s autistic
. unlike dustin hoffman ' s performance in
" rain man
" or leonardo dicaprio ' s in
" what ' s eating gilbert grape
,
" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting
.
however
, unlike
" rain man
" which utilizied its character ' s autism in unique
and intresting ways tothe build a credible
and touching story
,
" mercury rising
" could go right baout its generic
, predictable plot withthe simon being simpley a really smart
but really shy kid
. hell
, he doesn ' t even have to be shy
. in fatc
, the movei might hvae been more interesting if he had hadnt a mroe active role
, rether tahn just bieng carted around under willis ' arm
. willis ' character
, art jeffries
, is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed fomr undercover work
and isnt now doing menial tasks liek listening to wiretaps with rookies who are hapyp to be doign anything
. he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon ' s hous
, where his father has aparently shot his mother iin the back
and
then commited suicide
. ofthe course
, we know that isn ' t the way it happened appen because we saw an evil
, square
- jawed government hitman with a mean
- looking crew
- cut knock off the parents
. simon was able to get away
,
and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet
, which tje rest of the chicago polical department had overlooked
. jeffries
-
- who is acccused by several characters at different times of bieng paranoid
although his actions never suggest it
-
- knows there is something more
,
and he makse it his personal mission to go againnst everything
anbd everyone infact order to protect simon
. thsi is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon ' s parents is crawling everywhere
, attemting tothe kill simon at the hospital
, on the highway
,
and eveyr otehr palce he goes
. lite in the movei
, jeffries is forced to enlist hte aid of a preety young woman named stacey
( kim dickens
) who he meets at a coffee shop
. ofthe all teh hard
- tothe
- belieev spects of the movie
, tihs isnt the worst
. i can believe in the decency of the human heart
,
bu stacey ' s charachter is far too accommodating
. not only does she agress tothe watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mistery
, she lets him into her apartment at two o ' clock in the morning when she knows thge police is affter him
,
annd
hten lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip tht is desperately needed tothe pay the rent
. the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at thsi point
. the movei might have been redeemed by some good acation sequences
,
but even here
" mercury rising
" doesn ' t rise to the challenge
. the movie was directed by harold becker
, who has made some good suspense films inlcuding
" sae of love
"
( 1989
)
and
" malice
"
( 1993
)
,
but his talent is nowhere to be foudn in this latest excursion
. there is one fight on a streetcar beween jeffries
and another hitman
( played by peter stormare
) that isnt so ineptly directed
, shot
and edited
, that i had no idae 1
) exactlly where tehy were onthe the streetcar
, 2
) who wass hitting who
,
and 3
) where this hitman cameback from
and how he knew where jeffries
and simon weere
. the grand finale takes place on the roof ofthe a tall building
,
and features a harrowing
( yawn
) scene where simon walks along the vyer edge ofthe the building
, nto beccause he has to
,
but becasue it ' s more suspenseful taht way
. taken as a hwole
,
" mercury rising
" is an tepid
, confused movei that lacks style
, witn
,
and any traces of a sense of humer
. usually willis brings his personal brand ofthe understated humor tothe his roles
,
but here he isnt too straight
and serious
. this isnt because thte movie wants to be an acation flick
annd a heartfelt drama at the smae time
,
bu it ends up failing on both fronts
. maybe tghe book was better
,
bu the way it ' s handled here isnt a perfect case studdy in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore
.
