after tyhe reccent animated debacles of
,
" a rugrats movie
,
"
and
" a bug ' s life
,
" i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks ' other insect film from octobur
,
" antz
.
" i hated tyhat movie
,
and
yet
, it is so much better than these latest two excursions
.
" a bug ' s life
,
" is the second animated insect film iin the last two months
,
adn i hoped fo the best
, considering it was done in the wonderful stlye of pixar ' s lastr film
, 1995 ' s
" toy story
,
"
but in noone way doens
,
" a bug ' s life
,
" even remotely match up to that
. flik
( david foley
)
, an ant
, who along with his many comrades
, has the job every eyar of gathering uv the seasonal harvest
, only to have to give half ofthe it away to the dominating grasshoppers
, led by hopper
( kevin spacey
)
. flik
,
however
, feels all alone
and unwanted in the world
, especially after he accidentally loses all ofthe their food
,
and tje ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season ' s load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees
. banished from ant island
, flik leaves the colony inthe esarch of some strong reinforcement to help out
,
bu through a misunderstanding
, returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs
, including a walking stick
( david hyde pierce
)
, a dung beetle
( brad garrett
)
, a gypsy moth
( madeline kahn
)
, a male ladybug
( denis leary
)
,
and a caterpillar
( joe ranft
)
.
" a bug ' s life
,
" hasnt one thing going for it
. onyl one thign
. with its glorious
, bright colors
, thte computer
- generated animation isnt a spectacle to look at
. thte film itself
, unfortunately
, is a lifeless
, unamusing contraption wihtout any of yhe flair or excitment of
,
" toy stoyr
.
" teh charactors in
,
" a bug ' s life
,
" are an assortment of eather unlikable or dull insects wihtout any charm or perosnality
, otehr than tothe stand around
anbd recite arbitary
annd thoroughly unfunny one
- liners
. the thin story wass also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes
,
adn it often felt as if tehy ran out of idesa throughout
,
adn so they made uv pointless scenes tothe pass as timne
- filler
. after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year
, i was begining to think that i had simply outgrown them
,
but
thn i realized this is jstu not so
. i still adore alomst all ofthe the older disney films
,
and many of the newer ones
, such as 1989 ' s
,
" the littel mermaid
,
" 1991 ' s
,
" beauty
and tjhe beast
,
" 1993 ' s
,
" the nightmare before christmas
,
"
and yes
, 1995 ' s
,
" toy stoy
.
" maybe this hasnt jstu been a bad yearm forthe children ' s films
,
and hopefully
, the upcoming
,
" the prince of egypt
,
" will nto be a disappointment
. as for
,
" a bug ' s life
,
" i doed not enjoy anything baout it
. not tyhe sotry
, not the characters
,
and not even the voiceover work
, whic was far more livley infront
,
" antz
.
"
" a bug ' s life
,
" goes down as
yet anohter failure for disney
,
and it is a sad state of affairs wehn their best film in the last two years hasnt been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture
,
" i ' ll be hmeo for christmas
.
