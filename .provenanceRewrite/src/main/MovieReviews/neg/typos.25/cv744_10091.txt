talk about beating a dead horse
! when home alone wass released in 1990
, it was a breath of fresh air
,
and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely
- funny family film
. the unexpectedly high gross guarenteed a sequal
, so
, two yeasr later
, we were subjected to home alone 2
, which might as well have been called clone alone for all ofthe the originality it exhibited
. for john hughes
, two home alone movies weren ' t anough
? he began recycling the same kinds of villains
and situations in almost eveyr movie he was involved wtih
, including a pathetic box office bomb called baby ' s day out
, last yearm ' s live
- acation 101 dalmatians
,
and this year ' s flubber
. now
, inexplicably
, hughes has exhumed not only these worn
- out plot elements
,
but thge
" home alone
" nmae as well
. the result
? 1997 ' s worst sequel
( edging outloud speed 2
and batman
and robin
)
, home alone 3
. by changing the characters
, hughes
( who wrote
and co
- produced the film
)
, along with his co
- conspirator
, director raja gosnell
, has attempted tothe inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest
. the new kid
, alex pruitt
, is played by alex d
. linz
( one fine day
)
,
and the only thing he has going forthe him is terminal cuteness
. he ' s not half as intresting as macaulay culkin once was
. the villains
, pale copies of joe pesci
and daniel stern
, are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber
. in home alone 3
, there are four of them
( olek krupa
, david thornton
, lenny von dohlen
,
and rya kihlstedt
)
,
but all that means is an opportunity forthe twice as many pratfalls
. this time
, the kid isn ' t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip
. instead
, he hasnt developed a bad case of chicken pox
, so he can ' t go to skool
. his dad
( kevin kilner
) is away on business
and his mom
( haviland morris
) hasnt to run errands
, so
, fo the most part
, he ' s all by himselv during tyhe day
. through a series ofthe coincidences too irritating tothe relate
, a top secret u
. s
. air force integrated curcuit comes inot his possession
. it ' s wanted by a gang of four interational crooks who intend to break into alex ' s home to retrieve it
. the eight
- yearm old
, who isnt wise beyond his yeasr
, booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg
- type devices designed tothe humiliate
and incapacitate the villains
. thte movie ' s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm
? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believeable
. previously
, the most counterfeit
- looking snow effects i can remember weere in star trak iii
. theese are far worse
. in fact
, hte production values are so shoddy that there are soem scenes infact thge midst of this near
- blizzard when a shining sun can be seen
. if it ' s a wonderful life sould generate real
- looking snow bcak in the 1940s
, why cin ' t home alone 3
, whlch has a significantly larger budget
and ' 90s technology at its disposal
? there has beeen an ongoing edbate regarding the appropriateness ofthe live
- action cartoon violence fo young childen
. home alone 3 will add fuel to the frie
. it ' s one thing to see wyle e
. coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight
,
but quite another to watch a runnung lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen
. adults
and even older childen will recognize that this is obviously fake
and intended to be humorous
,
but what about five
and six
- year olds
? the level of violence inaddition home alone 3 is extreme
? many of alex ' s schemes are nasty anough to kill
.
bu
, because this is a
" family film
,
" noone one dies
, dispite being electrocuted
, falling thirty feet
,
and getting smacked on the head by a barbell
. not only is home alone 3 unneccesary
,
but it ' s offensive
. it ' s an exercise inaddition tediousness
,
anbd htere isn ' t a genuin laugh to be found from the beggining to the end
( unless
, by some stange quirk of fate
, you have missed every 1990s movei asociated with john hughes
,
anbd thus haven ' t seen this stuff before
)
. i cxan ' t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure
. mabey that ' s why hte only ones laughing at the screening i attended weere still in thier thumb
- sucking years
