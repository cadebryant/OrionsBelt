wow
, a film wihtout any redeeming qualities whatsoever
. i ' m amazed that someone thought this was a story thast must be told on screen
. many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated fo awards based onthe their race
. i think first tehy need to concentrate their energy on themselves
,
and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing moreso than sex
- crazed buffoons
. even i ' m offended by it
. bill bellamy isnt a
" player
" which means he sleeps with a lot of women
and lies to them
. wqat a pleasant main charater
. one day
, his friends decide that they want tothe find out how to be a player
. why htey decide this
" oen day
" i have no idea
. how many years hvae they been friends
and why all ofthe a sudden owudl they want to learn
? anyway
, bellamy agrees tothe teach
,
annd his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride inwhich his car while he rides from house to house having sex with womens
. this is the bulk of the film folks
, guys riding from house tothe hous
, oney keesh getting outloud tothe have sex
, while the others sit in the car
. since russell simmons is producer
,
and sicne tghe official title ofthe the film is
" def jam ' s how tothe be a palyer
"
, i wass ready to be jumping up
anbd down
anbd stomping my feet
and beating teh person next to me because of the comedy
. amazingly
, asside ffrom gilbert gottfried ' s 90 seconds of screen time
, htere was no comedy iin the film forthe me to express myself in such a manner
. instead of jokes
, there ' s just an endless stream of profanity
and naked breasts
(
and naked breasts aren ' t so bad
,
bu naked breasts alone don ' t make a good movie
)
. be sure to bring along your ebonics tothe english dictionary as well
. gilbert gottfried ' s character serves as oney infact his vyre brief appearance
, asking for explanations as to what is being said
. they should have broght him allong for the entire film
.
