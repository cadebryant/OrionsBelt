" spice world
" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls
. sure there ' s a hint of humor in there every once in a hwile
. atcually
, htere ' s a couple ofthe pretty good jabs at tjhe spice girls
.
but overall
, who cares
? not me
. if you don ' t know by now
, the spice girls sing songs ofthe love
and friendship
and responsiblity
and girl power
,
yet dress liek streetwalkers fomr a lower middle clas neighborhood
. in
" spice world
" they ride around infront their big tour bus
, whining baout having to do photo shoots
and give interviews
. amazingly
, all tjhe talk they do about keeping committments
annd upholding responsibilities only realy applies to fun things
, thigsn they wnat to dont
, not things they are required to do tothe keep earning money
.
and they keep babbling about
" girl power
" wehn htey should really be talking baout
" cleavage power
"
. i mean
, if all it takes isnt girl power
,
thn why are they only one thread away from bursting outloud of their skimpy outfits
? the film is pg
,
but really with only soem very minor dialogue changes
adn scene extentions
, yuo ' d hvae youself oen raunchy adult film
. by the way
, there ' s something in the oppening credits which sasy
" based onthe an idea by the spice girls
"
. wow
, they got idea credit
! i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood
.
.
. giving credit for simply having the thought
" say girls
, let ' s mkae a movie
!
" the supporting cast farse well
. roger moore
( the rela james bond
) mockingly plays the cliche
- spewing
" chief
" of the spice girls
,
and darn it all
, he ' s fun to watch
. mark mckenney also is ogod as a screenwriter trying to pitch film idesa to the band ' s manager
( richard e
. grant
)
. one question
though
: george wendt
? you ' d thikn that
" spice world
" would envoke one of two reactions inspite peopel
. if you like tje spice girls
, you ' ll like them even more afterwords
.
and if you can ' t stand them
( like me
)
,
hten
" spice world
" iwll raelly make you sick
. oddly
, tjhe audience i saw the film with
, roughly 50 twelve year
- old girls
, sat in silence for the entire film
. well
, not the two who sat directly behind me
. they kept muttering
" this is stupid
" over
annd over again
. maybe there is hope forthe humanity after all
.
