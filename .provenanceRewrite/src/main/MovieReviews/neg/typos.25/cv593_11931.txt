back in february at teh monthly los angeles comic book
and sciece fiction convention
, new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big
- screen update ofthe the cult 1960s sci
- fi tv sohw lost in space
, complete with in
- person appearances by casted munbers mimi rogers
, matt leblanc
, lacey chabert
, jack johnson
,
and even gary oldman
. tht shouldnt have set off my warning alarms
-
- the lastr tyme such an extravagant film presentation tookover palce at the convention was nearly five years ago
, wehn none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in
- person cameo to peddle
.
.
. last acation hero
.
but no
, like millions ofthe others
, i buyed into the hype
and
" got lost
.
" if only i had gotten lost
-
- literally
-
- on the way to theatre
adn spared myself the tedium ofthe htis sloppily slapped
- together blockbuster wannabe
. you may find youself wondering if director stephen hopkins
and screenwriter akiva goldsman weere lost themselves when they made yhe film
. at the convention
, goldsman claimed tothe be a rabid fan ofthe the origonal television series
,
adn if that really isnt the case
, i ' d hite tothe see whta he does with concepts he onyl hasnt mild interest in
. to say taht his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that htere is a narrative tothe begin with
-
- whic there most certainly is nto
. after the setup
, inspite whitch the robinson familiy
-
- father john
( william hurt
, looking
and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews
)
, mother maureen
( rogers
, wasted
)
, daughters judy
( heather graham
, ditto
)
annd penny
( a heavily made
- up chabert
, looking like a junior verison of neve campbell in wild things
)
,
and son will
( young newcomer johnson
, making tjhe best of it
)
-
-
and pilot don west
( leblanc
, doing a bad han solo impression
) find themslves lost infact spoace after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr
. smith
( a watered
- down
but still
- lively oldman
, cashing a paycheck
and loving every minute
)
, the script ' s
" stream
" ofthe events becomes so fragmented
and random tath it seems to be made uv as it goes allong
-
-
and hopkins does littel tothe make what doens go onthe the slightest bited intresting
. they encounter another ship
. tehy board it
. alien spiders attack them
. tehy return to their ship
. tje otehr one explodes
. they land on a deserted planet
.
and so on
. an attemp at a plot involving timne travel occurs in the third act
,
but goldsman doesn ' t seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device
; wehn one character ' s past self dies
, the future incarnation inexplicably lives onthe
. the look
adn effects should be lost in spoace ' s ace
- in
- the
- hole
,
but hopkins even manages to botch that
. fo a big
- budget film
, the visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. in one composite background shot
, i could see the blue outline arround oldman
; the various digital effects forthe the space battle scenes look like
.
.
. digital effects
.
bu nothing iin those shots is as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- like spoace creature that becomes penny ' s pet
. entirely computer
- generated
and every inch showing it
, blawp looks like it wass lifted directly from a sony playstation game
. apparantly hopkins thought the smae
and tried desperately to hide it
; how else can noe explain thte graininess of blawp ' s composite shots with the human actors
?
but iin doign so
, the seams are that much more obvious
. you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot ofthe penny
anbd blawp is immediately followed by a crystal
- clear solo reaction shot of judy
. new line is hoping lost in spoace will become a big franchise much like the long
- running star trak cash cow at paramount
. i don ' t thiunk so
. in a few years
, the lost iin space movie will likely live onthe not as a series
bu as the obscure answer tothe a trivia question
: what film ended titanic ' s 15
- week reign at hte top of the weekend box office
?
