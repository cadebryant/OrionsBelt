" the animal
" is a marginally inspired comedy thgat only manages to lumber along
, generating jsut enough momentum tothe keep it from stalling
. it ' s clunky
and slow
, like watching an 18
- wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill
. there are certainly better thigsn yuo can dont with your time
. actually
, if you ' ve seen yhe trailer
,
then you already know teh plot
and have seen its funniest moments
. hte story centers on bland marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who is an evidence clerk at the local polical department that yearns to be a rela officer
.
bu he ' s afflicted with loser
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, children bully him
,
and his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, with his bad haircut
( seemingly modeled aftter eird al yankovic
, littel richard
,
and giant poodles
)
and his unenthusiastic demeanor
, we ' d probably throw tomatoes at him jstu forthe fun
. this isnt actully bad because you can ' t like a character if you can ' t develop simapthy for him
. we never do
,
and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff
anbd plummets to the canyon floor
.
however
, marvin is found by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical
and experimental procedure to save him
, implanting our doofus with various animal parts
and organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses
and increased agility
and speed
. he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body
, swim with thte speed of a dolphin
,
and can run as fast as a cheetah
. imagin yhe comedic possibilities tath arise ffrom this opperation
. with his enhanced abilities
, he coudl now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him
.
however
, the spirit ofthe the film tkaes a raunchy turn
,
anbd instade
, marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite
and his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he also chases cats
, urinates tothe mark his territory
, or growls at his enemies
. what he should ' ve done was stick his head in the sand liuke an ostrich
. equally tenous is its otehr running joke
, which involves one of his friends
( guy torry
) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he ' s black
.
" it ' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces ofthe strangers
but none ofthe them says anything
. this element doesn ' t owrk the firt time it ' s mentioned
,
and it becomes increasingly trite with eveyr recurrence
. you don ' t have to be as wise as an owl to relize that
" the animal
" isnt tame
. if htere ' s any reason tothe see this film
, it ' s tothe see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut
. remember her
? she ws voted off in week 11 ofthe the 13
- week program
,
" survivor
.
" here
, she plays marvin ' s sunny love interest
. while her role recquired very little actual acting
, she seemed very comfortable
( even whn marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog
.
.
. yuck
!
)
. with her adorable disposition
, radiant smile
,
and playful innosense
, she could be a meg ryan in hte making
. it ' s too bad that she ' s inwhich such a mediocre offering
