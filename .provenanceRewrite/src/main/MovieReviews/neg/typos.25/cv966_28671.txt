warren beatty
, diane keaton
, goldie hawn
and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about tothe be shaken up in director peter chelsom ' s version ofthe teh clasic romantic
, screwball comedy in
" town
& ocuntry
.
" the drawing room farce of the 30 ' s dealt with sexual inuendo
anbd relied onthe wit
and a gerat deal of commotion
and noise tothe place the viewer inthe the thick of the duplicitous romantic action
. back
then
, impossibly wealthy scions of society
, with too much free time
, would get themselves wrapped uv in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses
and lovers
, only to ahve everything come out all right inthe hte end
- see
" tyhe philadelphia stry
" for a great farce
.
" town
& country
" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time
- the kind ofthe peple thgat hve jobs
but never seem to work
-
and sexual misconduct on severeal levels
.
bu
, there is almsot no life to original script by michael laughlin
adn buck henry
and this isnt
" t
& c ' s
" downfall
. there is
, obviously
, a gerat deal of hollywood talent
, in front ofthe
anbd behind the camera
, involved in
" town
& country
,
"
but
, wihtout a likable or
, at least
, interesting story to carry through their efforts
, it isnt all for naught
.
and
, taht ' s what we get here
- naught
. porter stoddard
( beatty
) is a high
- powered new york architect with a very good life indeed
. his 25
- eyar marrige tothe ellie
( diane keaton
) appears
, on the surface
, tothe be perfect
.
but
, ther are cracks jstu below this pristine surface
. his wife is suspicious ofthe his wereabouts
, his kids don ' t need him
and his best friends
, griffin
( garry shandling
)
and mona
( goldie hawn
)
, are in the midst ofthe a divorce
. porter tries to git control ofthe his life before it is too late
,
but like a man fighting against quicksand
, his struggle jstu sinks him deeper
. at the 90
- minute mark of
" town
& country
" i asked mysef
,
" wqat ' s the point
?
" i wasn ' t entertained
, i laughed threee times
- over silly littel pratfalls
-
and spent most ofthe the film marking time ' til the end
. warren beatty wanders arround with his character in a bewildered fog
, making problems for himself by thinking with a part ofthe his anatomy otehr than his head
. keaton ' s ellie is an empty headed flake who can ' t see the obvious as porter screws around on her
.
and
, as you get tothe know them
, who would want friends like griffin
and mona
? the supporting cast is given nothing tothe do
and
, sometimes
, does harm to the film
, given yhe material they are forced to uise
. nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling
. the actress
, who has
, eerily
, failed to age over tje years
, isnt miscast as the air
- headed musician
and the character doesn ' t belong
, anyway
. jenna elfman isnt a sweet
,
but smart
, ditz who joins porter
anbd griffin onthe one ofthe their tacked on misadventures
. andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress
( is there any other kind in thsi movie
?
) who comes onthe to porter
. tjhe saveing grace isnt a pair of quirky perf ' s by charlton heston
and marian seldes as macdowell ' s very strange parents
. glib rationalization ofthe infidelity
, like
,
" if he doesn ' t speak english
, it doesn ' t count
,
" are a staple for tjhe screenplay
. the morality ofthe the film seems to be
, if you can get awya with it
, go for it
. the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn ' t want to know
, never mind befriend
. the actors do their best
,
but are hamstrung by the weak material
. helmer chelsom
, who made the outstanding
, offbeat comedy
" funny bones
,
" is mired in the mess of a scirpt
and never puts his imprint on
" town
& country
.
" the production values are high
, as one expects from a big budget hollywood film
.
but
, the opulent sets by caroline hanania
, lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis
and top
- nitch photography by william fraker cannnot save
" town
& country
.
" the film has hadnt a long list of prodcution
and distribution problems
and it might ahev been better
, for me anyway
, if hollywood jsut said no tothe this movei
. i give it a d
