jet li busted onto the american action movie scene
, when he stole thge show in 1998 ' s lethal weppon 4
, with his wicked looks
, his nasty moves
and his undeniable charisma
. it only took another two years for mega
- producer joel silver to set him uv in an all
- american movie
, primed tothe take over some of the empty action
- hero seats left by alleged coke
- head van damme
and taht pudgy guy named steven seagal
. would thsi film take li past his rival asian action counterparts
, namely chow yun
- fat
and jackie chan
? let ' s find out
. plot
: rival chinese
and black ganster organizations fall further out of favor from one another
, wehn members of their respective families strat turning up dead
. that ' s when badass jet li blasts into yhe picture tothe find out who the men were behind his brother ' s death
and to exact some of his own style of revenge
. critique
: three words
: not enough action
! simple enough
? not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate forthe a horribly predictable screenplay
, bad actors
, crappy dialogue
and oh
- so many over
- the
- top melodramatic moments
.
and a romance anle
? why
, one must ask
.
.
. why
? i love fight scenes
and i really dig jet li too
,
bu thsi little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences
,
and jet
, well
, the poor dued was barely in the movie
.
and i thought this was supposed to be his big break
? how ' bout giving tyhe slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung
- fu fighting chops
, slap him in a few more scenes
,
and give him more chances to practice his acting
/ english abilities
? wqat a letdown
. even black mask was more entertaining than thsi glossed up
, empty shell of a film
. in fact
, i am sure that more time wass spent gathering the
" hits
" for the soundtrack of this film
, thna were on yhe so
- called
" screenplay
"
. i felt liuke i wass watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most ofthe the time
. the sad part about the bad script is taht it wouldn ' t matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting outloud the tacky lines
.
but no
, sive lindo
and aaliyah
, who weren ' t too shabby
, i throught the rest ofthe the cast was picked primarially from their inablility to deliver lines convincingly
.
and what was the deel with the whole nfl franchise deel run by some 15
- year old looking guy
, acting like he ' s tyhe overlord ofthe a drug ring
?
! what a mess
.
hten again
, i don ' t want it to seem like i ' m complaining solely about the story which ws completely forseeable
, sicne we all go tothe see these movies for tyhe action anyway
, not yhe stopry
. well
, i guess tyhat ' s what disappointed me the most outloud of this film
. there weere a couple of kool fight scenes with li
,
but simpley not anough to satisfy my overall craving
. alsot
, as much as i love the way htey incorporate wires
adn special effects in some of their stunts
, a cuple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simpley too obvious a stunt
. it should be seamless
, fellas
, nto nessasarily against the laws of gravity
! the one kool thnig that was orginal infact thge movie was tyhe way in which the directer showed us some of the inside cracklings of thte human body when penetrated by a blow
,
but that simple creative touch couldn ' t save the rest of this film ' s uninteresting plot movements
. i ' m dissapointed for jet li that htis film didn ' t give him the real opportunity to star infact a ogod story with many great action scenes
. hopefully
, teh enxt tiome will be a charm forthe this charismatic actor
. for now
, i just hope that for his sake
, the film ' s title isn ' t a premonition of hte movie ' s ulitmate fate at the box
- office
.
