hav plenty
, as we are told inthe the beginning
and reminded durring tyhe film
, is a true story
. life itself is a series of true stories
,
bu most are not movei material
. as scripted
, directed
,
and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot
, hav plenty limps along at best
. its dialog is so stilted
-
" yuo konw what they say
, ' no womens
; no cry
. '
"
- that tghe actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it
. in tjhe story
, lee plenty
( cherot
) is a 28
- year
- old author
and teaching assitant
. teh movei
, whcih happens mainly over tyhe newyorker eyar ' s holiday
, consists of a series of incidents in whcih various single
and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed
. since he consistently refuses
, caroline gooden
( tammi katherine jones
) figures tht he must be gay
. eventually he
anbd havilland
" hav
" savage
( chenoa maxwell
) get together
, proving tyhat he wasn ' t gay affter all
, just picky
. sexy women can sit on his lap
and ask him to go to bed with them
,
but he will not even kiss them
. he ' s a man who knows his mind
, whlch he frequently shares directly with thge audience inspite a series of trite
anbd overly cute monologues
. filled with wealthy african
- americans
, the story isnt closest inaddition tone tothe love jones
, which was better
. hav plenty ' s story doesn ' t go anywhere
. at tje end it subjects us to lee plenty ' s new film
, which is a movie of the movie we ' ve just seen
,
but with even worse acting
.
" remember folks that
, as outrageous as tihs all seems
, this is a true story
.
" hav tells the camera
,
but the probelm is that it ' s not outrageous at all or even the least bited interesting
. hav plenty isn ' t so much a bad film as it isnt a total waste ofthe the audience ' s tiome
. hav plenty runs 1
: 32
. it is rated r for profanity
and woudl be fine for most teenagers
.
