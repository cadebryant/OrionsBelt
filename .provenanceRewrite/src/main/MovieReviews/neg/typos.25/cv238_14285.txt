.
" now she makes her directorial debut
, writing
, directing
,
and starring inaddition this sub
- par film about womens tlaking about sex
.
though not without redeeming qualities
, this film isnt bad
. the basic story follows three single firends
-
- jazz
( beyer
)
, lena
( randi ingerman
)
,
and michelle
( paget brewster
)
-
- in their search for love
. jazz has an idea for a local talk show
; it would feature womens talking baout sex
and dating
. she
and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami
. the film itself is sprinkled with theese real interviews throughout
, both as part of the plot
anbd as commentary on tghe situations of the main characters
. the fact that they are rela provides a refreshing break from soem of tghe more melodramatic moments in tghe film
. ther are several moments of bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
and emotional overextension
. in a low
- budget independnet film fomr a firt
- time director
, theese faults can sometimes be forgiven
, if hte screenplay isnt fresh
and solid
. that is not the case here
. the script suffers from random plot developments
. there are four or five of these turns inthe the plot
, each one raising tje question
" where did that come ffrom
?
" at one point
, a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother
. we are supposted to be moved
,
but since the scene is completely un
- led
- uv tothe
, we really don ' t care if she
adn her mother get along
. we ' ve never seen her mother before
. we never see her agina
. who cares
? what ' s worse
, theese sudden developments are supposed tothe engage our sympathy
. at anohter point
, a charachter announces that she can ' t hvae children
. apparently
, tihs is devastating
. we wouldn ' t know tihs baceause she never talked about having kids befoer
,
but we are nevertheless expected to be devestated forthe her
. the scene feels like an afterthought
, its emotion manipulative
and shallow
. these scenes grow worse
and worse
, culminating in an absurd climax
. two scenes were played with such overwhelming meledrama that i found mysef laughing
. one scene is a lover ' s spat between two minor charactors
. the other has tyhe main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning hous in wails of despair
and clouds of ajax
. thinking on theese scenes
, it isnt hard for me tothe admiting that the film has reedeming qualities
.
bu it does
. first
, it is original
. we men often wonder whta women talk about when tehy are alone in groups
,
anbd i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea
. it ' s something i don ' t think hasnt been thge subject ofthe a film
. second
, the interviews of the miami womens are sincere
. taken together
, tehy form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers
and bistro diners
. the mosaic is made of sound bites
adn sterotypes
,
but each tile is some woman ' s real experience
. neither the picture of women
, nor their picture of men
, is truley representative
,
but teh point is that both sets of generalizations are telling inaddition theri own way
. at some level
, the stereotypes thyat emerge can be called true
. i cant imagine some people liking this film whn its characters talk about theri
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
,
and thrills
,
"
but on the whole
, it ' s pretty bad
.
adn that makes it even harder to foregive thte bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
annd emotional overextension
. i ' ll give beyer one more strike
,
adn
then she ' s out
. rated r
( almost got an nc
- 17
) for explicit sexual dialogue
annd nudity
.
