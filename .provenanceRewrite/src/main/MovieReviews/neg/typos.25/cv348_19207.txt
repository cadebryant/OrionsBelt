the happy bastard ' s quick movie review wild wild west a better name fo this movie might ' ve been
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, in an attept to get their own men in black style of movie
, had managed to lasso in some big names
( actor will smith
and director barry sonnenfeld
, hte duo behind mib ' s success
) in order tothe git their own fourth ofthe july blockbuster
, a contemporary big
- screen update to the classic western
/ sci
- fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
bu somehow
, htey ran into a problem along tyhe way
. htey were so busy trying to fill spicific roles that they forgot one in general that woudl ' ve made all the diference
- a story writer
. wild wild west ' s story
and script was compiled by six different peopel
, rather than just the one who put the brillant touches on men in black
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. had gotten him
, the movie would ' ve possably beeen five times better than what it is
. heck
, ten times
. as is
,
however
, the story
and screenplay is a mess
, filled with dead laughs
, enough racist
and sex jokes to make even iwll cringe as he ' s perfoming them
,
and a complet lack of chemistry that made hte tv show work so well
. here ' s the story
: us army member james west
( will smith
) teams uv with creative genius artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) to take on a ruthless villain by tyhe name of arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half was blown off druing the civil war
, leaving him tothe roll around iin a steam
- controled wheelchair
. htey catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that cxan basically be considered an 80
- foot tarantula
(
although it looks bigger thna that
)
, hellbent on destroying anything in its path
. as i said
, the way the scirpt unfolds is a complete mess
.
but the acting doesn ' t help either
. kevin kline isnt miserable as gordon
, failing tothe display even a smidgeon of care as he doed in the 1985 western silverado
. smith seems to be haveing a better time as west
,
although he ' s not nearly as charming as he was in mib
. branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain
, perhasp to the point where we can ' t even stand to look at him or his stange beard
.
and salma hayek is along for the ride tothe search forthe her missing father
,
bu mostly she exists just for sexual attension
. her acting is bearly passable
,
but whta a
" breath of fresh ass
"
. director barry sonnenfeld isn ' t of great help eather
. even
though he shows some good creativity at some points
, his overall urgency for directing is lost
. it ' s as if he feels he ' s directing a tv movie
, a big noone
- no when you ' re helming what ' s supposed to be a big
- screen hit
. last
bu not least
, there are huge gaps of logic thgat are just plain unacceptable
. at one point
, smith defies gravity when first boarding kline ' s train
. he jumps onthe the bakc
, gets launched straight up in the air
,
and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train
- while it ' s still in motion
! alsot
, he seems to be strangely comfortable tlaking about racism in front ofthe a lynch mob
, particularly considering the fact that his family wass killed by the likes of such folks
. last
bu not least
, why is he still makeing kissing faces whn he knows he ' s not kissing a woman as he ' s looking thru a peephole at the enemy
?
! the only saveing grace fo wild wild west come mostly in the form of spacial effects
. thge huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel
, very authentic looking
annd considerable tothe the creativity of the show
. there ' s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces
and spinning saw blades
,
bu
, agian
, a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity
. i owudl sday sit back
and have a good tyme with wild wild west
,
but it really isn ' t possible
. if the racist
and sex jokes don ' t bother you
, the performances will
. if the performances don ' t bother yuo
, the story will
. if the story doesn ' t bother you
, the racist
annd sex jokes wiull
. htere ' s no end to the vicious circle
. go rent men in black instead
anbd pretend smith
and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. ytou ' ll have a better time
. if yuo dont go
, keep an eye out forthe robert conrad in a role as president grant
. i bet he wishes he were somewhere else
.
