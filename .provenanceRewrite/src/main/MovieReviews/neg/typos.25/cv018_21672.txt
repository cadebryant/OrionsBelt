the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states thyat thte two leads must end up toghether by film
' s end
. if ytou
' re not familiar with tihs law
, thn maybe you
' ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film
' s end
. now if yuo
' re a regluar reader ofthe mine
, ytou
' ve heard me say this countless times
: you know how drive me crazy is going tothe end
,
but is the journey tothe get to thta ending worth it
? noone
, it definitely is not
. melissa joan hart
( ffrom abc
' s
" sabrina
, the teenage witch
"
) likes a hunky stud on tje basketball team
. adrien grenier isnt her grungy neighbor who
' s just broken up with his activist girlfriend
. apparantly he wants to make his ex
- girlfriend jelous enough to tkae him back
,
and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance
. so tjhe twpo pretend tothe date for smoe reason
,
but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud
. will grenier like his new popularity
and turn on his friends
? will tihs crazy scheme work
? dont i care
? teh teen comedy resurgence of lite has beeen surprisingly good iin terms of comedy
. what makes movies like can
' t hardly wait
and 10 things i hite about you work
(
and to a lesser extent
, she
' s all that
and never been kissed
) is because the writers of thsoe films seem to relize that high school is a joke
and write their scripts accordingly
. i don
' t know what hte writer
' s intention was with drive me crazy
. ther was smoe smart comedy in those films tothe make the obvious endings worth getting to
. here there
' s nothing
.
.
. just teens whinning about who
' s going to take them to the big dance
. do me a favor kids
, go get a job or something
.
.
. jstu shut tyhe hell up
. in all honesty
, thte best part of this film isnt the end credits
. now normally whn i say tyhat it
' s followed with the joke
"
.
.
. because tje movie is finally over
.
" in this case
though the end credits realy are teh most entertaining part of the film
. after the obligatory second palying of britney spears
' titular song
, there
' s a quick commercial jingle for a bugrer joint the kids in the film hang out in annd a brief rendition of tyhe school song for their high school
. nothing great
,
but more entertaining than anything inthe the 90 minutes which preceded them
. sci
- fi fans take note
: there are brief appearances from stephen collins
( star trek
: the motion picture
)
and faye grant
( the tv miniseries
" v
" anbd
" v
: the final battle
