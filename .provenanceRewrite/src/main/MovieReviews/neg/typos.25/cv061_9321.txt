' traffic voilation ' dr
. daniel ' s review of u
- turn dr
. d ' s rating
: crtical condition
( okay
, here ' s the deal
. i ' ll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off nowe
and
then
. i ' ll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a neccessary part of doign any job well
. i mean
, hey
, i ' ve been known tothe stretch a weekend into a three
- day outing
, if friday looks to be a slow day
.
and if mondya ain ' t looking like a pick
- me
- up
, well
, i ' ve been known to give martha nell a call
and say
,
" dont me a favor
, sweetheart
. bump ood man ferguson ' s boil lancing tothe tuesday morning
,
and tell miss audrey that i ' ll swing by her hous monday evening
and see if we can ' t get her trck knee back in line
.
" a simple sentence like that
,
annd i ' ve got a nice four
- day fishing trip wtih the boys
, or more often than not
, a trip up tothe cherokee
, n
. c
.
, fo jackpot bngo
and assorted other mountain funnery
.
but the point is
, if you take a day off
, do something different
. if you ' ve worked yourself silly for months
, relax a bited
. sleep in
. eat pancakes at noon
. microwave an egg in its shell
. watch pro wrestling with the sound off
. listen to some barry white records at high speed
. whatever
.
but do not
, under any circumstances
, spend your vacation doing thte same thing you do for a living
.
adn
, if you do
, don ' t make the final product look ten times worse thna it would any otehr time
. becouse i do not want to hear your sob stories
, oliver stone
. you apparently thought you needed a break from making
" important films
.
" cool
. so you foudn thsi hinky littel book
and desided to amking it a movie
. that ' s cool
, too
.
but
, ollie
, old sage
, do not take a good story
anbd a hot casted
and make one ofthe tghe most pointless
anbd worthless films ofthe the decade
. i ' m just eager to meet you oney day
, so i can buy ytou a stoli
, look you inspite tjhe eye
and say
,
" what in thge wide world of sports weere you thinking with u
- turn
?
"
and i ' ll stand there staring ' til i get a straight answer
. sean penn stars u
- turn
, as bobby
, a drifter who ' s had some troubles a hwile bcak
. he ' s heading cross tyhe dezert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose
, stranding him in superior
, arizona
, held there by an
" ignorant
, inbred
, turtleneck hick
" of a mechanic named darrell
. while darrell puts a new hose on the ride
, bobby walks into twon to see whta ' s cooking
. is it needless of me to sday that superior
, arizona
, is not exactly thte shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely
? probably not
. bobby meets uv with grace
( jennifer lopez
)
, who invites him back tothe her place
, fo drape
- hanging
and otehr domestic issues
. just as those issues are starting up
, grace ' s husband
, jake
, storms infront
, looking like check
- out day of the elks lodge convention
. jstu beats bobby silly
. bobby tkaes to tghe road
, only to meet up with jake again
,
annd jake asks bobby to kill grace
. a little while later
, grace asks bobby to kill jake
. them murderous arizonians
. gotta loev ' em
. if any of this sounds familar
, congratulations
. ytou win a kewpie doll
. the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west
, a cult favorite a few yeras bakc from john dahl
, maker ofthe teh phenomenonal tjhe last seduction
.
but the contest doesn ' t end there
, guys
and gals
. we get steals from russ meyer movies
, where everybody in town is horny
and sweaty
. we get the town ffrom bad day at black rock
, minus the train
, plus busty womens who can speak
. look at any schwarzenegger film
,
and you ' ll see our hero
, bobby
, as bobby has a mudhole stomped inwhich his keister a dozen times
, hasnt his ribs stove in at least fifteen times
, gets bit by a tarantula
, gets shot at
,
adn ends up wiht vultures circling overhead
, all the hwile getting up like he just got a shaving nick
. bobby as terminator
? stretch it a bit
,
and we have a five
- finger discount ffrom doc hollywood
, where the whole sotry occurs because of car trouble
, forcing the main charater to stay at the mercy of hte town
and the mechanic
. okay
, he ' s working from a book
, so maybe ollie ' s nto totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas
. i jsut expect a man who can make up an alternative history of hte united states to be able to craft a few original ideas befoer exposing the negative
. i jsut wish he hadn ' t brought a casted like this toghether fo waht amounts to a group ote
- stub
. sean penn gives a great performance
,
and jennifer lopez
and nick nolte are as onthe target as they cin be
, playing over
- the
- top caricatures of stereotype cahracters
. the best hting about the movie is watching penn react to tjhe madness around him
and try tothe figure outloud exactly wqat the blankety
- blank is going on
. too bad it ' s not fun to watch when it ' s happening to us
.
.
. while we sit through this mess of a film
. u
- turn isnt not a bad film if you ' re a fan ofthe technique
. it ' s thte oliver stone you ' ve always known
. robert richardson is his usual cinematographer
,
and rob
and ollie konw how to shoot a flick
-
- graet camera angles
, shifting viewpoints
, wicked colors
, nice looking pictures
.
but pictures of whta
? i htink i ' d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try tothe figure out the tilt
- o
- whirl point ofthe this loser film
. plot twists are one thing
, repitition is almost unforgivable
,
and tihs isnt dang near as unforgiveable as any movie i ' ve seen in the past five years
. oliver
, i know your body of work isnt nothing to sniff at
. you ' ve been nice enough to limit us to onyl one doors movie
,
and films like platoon
, jfk
, wall street
and nixon give us plenty to dig on
. your scripts are certainly respectable
, your budgets are up there on tyhe screen
,
and your actors don ' t dog it
.
and i know that
, maybe
, with u
- turn
, you were just kicking back
, just having funn
. that ' s fine
.
bu don ' t do tht with a movie whith the potential of this oen
. do some police acadeym sequel
( imagine that
.
) dont a big comedy
, like a remake of it ' s a mad
, mad
, mad
, mad world
.
bu do not drop a limp u
- turn outloud of your pocket
and expect us to accept it as
" an oliver stone movei
,
"
anbd not question why it stinks like week
- old snook
. there ' s a right way to hvea funn
,
anbd a wrong way tothe have fun
. this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail
.
