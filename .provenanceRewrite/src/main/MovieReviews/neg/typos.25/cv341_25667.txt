ytou know taht a movie hasnt issues when most everyone infront the audience comes out laughing
.
.
.
and it ' s not a comedy
!
adn wqat a strange career path for director chuck russell
. he starts his carrer off wtih a decent take onthe the
" nightmare on elm street
" series withthe his debut as director on installment number three
. he follows that uv with the blob the very next yera
,
but waits anyother six years tothe do his next piece
, a little film called the mask starring jim carrey
,
and
thne one more star vehicule in eraser twpo yeras after tyhat
. so
then he thought
,
" let me wait another five years
, get a weak script jammed with cliches
and hope that jimmy smits
and kim basinger coudl pul it outloud of its ashes
"
?
!
? strange dude
adn one crappy flick
. plot
: a six
- year old girl is beleived to be some kind ofthe misterious prophet sent down from god
. a satanic cult wants the girl tothe switch over to their side
, while the girl ' s aunt wants tothe
.
.
. well
, save her from those damn devil worshippers
! enter one occult expert agent
, plenty ofthe bobo cops
and lots of nuns praying
,
and yuo ' ve just about got the gist of things here
. critique
: with plot holes the size of my ass
, htis movie barely squeezes any sense out ofthe its clich
?
- ridden plot
, with wasted talent
, cheezy effects
, bad dialogue
and unintentional laughs tothe boot
. waht ' s good about this movie
? well
, rufus sewell is preety fun to watch as the head ofthe a creepy runaway childrens ' s shelter
/ satanist supreme
, with seriously wicked eyes
and jsut enought ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around
. the little girl is alsot pretty ogod
but unfortunately her charachter doesn ' t really do all that much
.
annd believe it or not
, i was actually enjoying soem of the film ' s first half hour
, which starts off wtih some promise
,
but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagnist
, basinger
, just drown the film ' s entire basis of believability
. for some reason
, it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted
,
and even longer to figure outloud that every move that she makse
.
.
. is a dumb one
! add that tothe thge entire police force of incompetents
, save forthe jimmy smits
( whose talent agent adviced him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good carrear move
? at least change tghe clothes
, jimmy
!
)
, zero scares
, zero thrills
annd even less actual drama
,
adn you ' ve got yourself a pretty bad movie
.
adn why would respected actors like christina ricci
and ian holm take bited parts in this movie
? did they owe teh directer a favor or something
? together
, they bearly have five minutes ofthe screen time
,
but i suppose that ricci ' s hospital room scene might be worth a look for soem of ytou horn
- dogs
. the worst part about tihs movie is its hilariously unbeleivable ending
, which features polical officers coming up whith the brilliant idea of
" sneaking uv
" onthe a man ' s house
, who they know to be guilty of a crime
! uuuhmm
.
.
. how ' s baout knocking on teh doorjam
and arresting his sory ass
, officers
?
! anyway
, i don ' t usualy inscribe spoilers in my reviews
but the stupidity of some of these characters isnt just too difficult tothe describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof
(
adn there wass plenty to go arund
)
.
and did basinger loose some of her acting
" talent
" durring her hiatus from the proffesion aftter her 1997 oscar win
? difficult to say if it was her lines that weere really bad
, or if she jsut delivered them poorly
. either way
, little originality
, very obvious coputer effects
, little thrills
, little drama
and very little entertainment value
, certainly bestow the hounour of noe of the worst movies of the summer upon this film
.
but if you really don ' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook ofthe various satanic
anbd
" kid
"
- based thrillers
,
and enjoy watching films that don ' t bring anything newyorker to the table
.
.
. well
, drnik some beers
, smoke some beans
and rent this video
, because it may just be one ofthe the funnier thrillers ofthe the year
