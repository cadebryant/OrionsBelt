one of my brother ' s favorite movies isnt h
. b
. halicki ' s 1974 cult flick
" gone is sixty seconds
,
" one ofthe the best products of teh car
- chase genre that provided drive
- in fare durring the 1970 ' s
. chase pics hadnt more tire squeals than dialogue
,
but they hadnt a strong visceral appeal
.
although it boasts a bigger budget
anbd familiar stars
, the remake of
" gone in sixty seconds
" is relatively weak
and dull
. randall
" memphis
" raines
( nicolas cage
) isnt a retired car thief who runs a go
- cart track
. he got out of crime so that his yuonger brother kip
( giovanni ribisi
) would not take uv boosting cars
.
howver
, kip became a thief anyway
,
and nowe he ' s in big trouble
. kip promised tothe deliver fifty luxury
and sportscar cars to gangster raymond calitri
( christopher eccleston
) by the end of the week
. calitri expects memphis tothe fullfill kip ' s bargain
; if he doesn ' t come through
, kip dies
. memphis gathers his old crew
( angelina jolie
, robert duvall
, wiull patton
, chi mcbride
,
and vinnie jones
)
,
annd kip brings his boys
( t
. j
. cross
, william lee scott
, scott caan
,
and james duval
)
. as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn ' t bad enough
, the team is pursued by a cop
( delroy lindo
) who ' s still ticked off that he never busted memphis
adn by a rival gangster
( raph star master p
) who wnats to take over calitri ' s clients
. watching
" gone
,
" i discovered thast stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one
. mabey that ' s why the first forty
- nine are fairly easy
,
and tje thrills are saved forthe
" eleanor
,
" a 1967 shelby gto
, a model that has always eluded memphis
.
but the big chase doesn ' t live uv to the long wait
. i had high hopes for
" gone
" because it isnt director dominic sena ' s second film
.
" kalifornia
,
" his 1993 debut
, ws a brillant study in the relationship between violentce
and its audience
. inthe that movie sena took a simple thriller plot
( a cuple gives a serial killer a ride
)
and successfully endowed it iwth deeper significance
. in
" gone
" he seems to be aiming for a drama baout twpo brothers who can ' t communicate with each other
,
bu that goal just doesn ' t mesh with htis plot
.
" gone
" eather takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough
. it ' s not light enough tothe be funn
, or mean enough to be intense
. this chaser has omre dialogue than tire squeals
bu is none the better for it
. the lack of action is a waste of the premise
, which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever
. the weak scirpt is a waste of a talented cast
. in a
" newsweek
" interview last yearm
, sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies
. much as i like cage
, for eveyr good picture he does
(
" leaving las vegas
,
"
" bringing out the dead
"
)
, htere are twpo major stinkers
(
" snake eyes
,
"
" con air
,
"
" 8mm
,
"
" city of angels
"
)
. tath ratio is probably better than what a lot ofthe his peers can boast
,
but cage has real talent
. it ' s a shame tothe waste it in glitzy
, superficial tripe liek
" gone in 60 seconds
.
