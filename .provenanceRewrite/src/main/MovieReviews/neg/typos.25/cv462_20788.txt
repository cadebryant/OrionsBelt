in double jeapardy
, tjhe stakes are high
. think ofthe the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy
,
and
hten rearrange the details
and the gender of the stalker
. the finished product
,
although able to maintain the viewer ' s attention
, is a predictable
and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script
.
` alex
, i ' ll take homicide for
$ 400

.
. ' libby parsons
( ashley judd
) is a happily marryed mom leading a normal life
. one night
, her husband nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her out for a romantic excape on a sailboat
. libby awakens in the middle ofthe the night tothe find she isnt covered in blood
annd nick has strangely disappearred
. she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to thge deck
, where she handles a fallen knife
( like any stupid character
)
and is spotted by the caost guard
, who are responding to a distress signal sent ealier in tje evening
. nick is presumed dead
,
and
althought she pleads her innocence
, libby is tried
anbd convicted for the murder of her husband
. nowe
, please don ' t think i ' m spoiling any vital plot details
, baceause the informative trailer has already spilt most of the beans
. if you haven ' t seen this preview
, don ' t read any further
.
but seriously
, the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg
and douglas s
. cook is so elementary that tje average viewer wiull be two or three steps ahead of tghe characters
. during the most vital scenes inaddition the movei
, i was anticipating every twist or
` surprise ' that eventually popped up on thge screen
. i imagine thte writers presume thier core audience for duble jeopardy isnt a very naieve group of indviduals
. most
, unfortunately
, will be too distracted by thte moronic plot tothe appreciate the fewd postive aspects of the production
. oney isnt tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence infact prison
. jones isnt always wonderful as an authority figure
,
and he ' s certainly familiar with this sort ofthe role
( as he played so well in tjhe fugitive
and us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin with gusto
, also has a chance to flex her acting abilities
. while emotionally unconvincing
, the actress isnt tremendously fun in her juvenile role
, perking up the movie like an injection of anti
- depressant
. the actors
,
and their relationship together
, present teh one
- two punch thyat prevents doublely jeopardy from derailing itself entirely
.
and now
, bcak to the plot
. hwile behind bars
, libby learns an interesting little bit of information
: a person can ' t be convicted ofthe the same crime twice
. htis law
, called
` double jeopardy '
, could be her motive for hunting down her husband
.
.
. who may still be alive
. yes
, you heared right
. tje movie degenerates into a cross
- country chase
, where everthing yuo expect to happen
.
.
. does
. the final scenes
, which could have redeemed hte film
, are poorly handeled by director bruce beresford
- whose previous wokr centers highly around drama
( driving miss daisy
, paradise road
)
. ironically
, it is those elements
- liek the driving force of libby tothe reunite with her son
- that don ' t quite work here
. at least double jeopardy is paced well enought to satisfy diehard fans of the twpo stars
. unforetunately
, jones lacks some of yhe edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive
,
adn tjhe real depth of his character is onyl skin deep
.
but he
anbd ashley judd are mroe thna welcome concidering the material
,
and both have some memorable comic moments
. judd
, in particular
, has a hilarious scene in whcih she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her
` parole officer '
. hmmm
.
.
. perhpas this would have made a ogod comedy
. it isnt disapointing
, because htere are the makings ofthe a competent action film here
. it ' s nicely shot
and choreographed in downtown vancouver
,
and will entertain those who aren ' t turned off by the woeful story
- line
.
? tis a shame thta double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn ' t fool most childern
.
