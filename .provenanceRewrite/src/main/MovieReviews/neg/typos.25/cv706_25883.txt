" nothing more than a high budget masterbation fantasy
" showgirls
( nc
- 17
)
- contains graphic nudity
, profanity
, sexual situations
and violence
. some people
,
however
, keep their clothes on
. you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values
, nor do you write reviews on them
. that ' s why this review will be short
. it seems that tihs film iwll end up inaddition the porn section when it hits the video stores
. there is no story
, script
, point or acting
. onyl naked bodies
, which is exactly the point
. here is the so called plot
: nomi
, the 23
- year
- old witht a dark past as a hooker
, hasnt hitchhiked from somewhere back east tothe perform in a show where a dancer doesn ' t wear much more thna a glight coating of powder
and a big
, fake smile
. no one is twisting nomi ' s arm
. no noe is holding her granmother hostage
. she wants to do this
.
anbd that is whta she isnt doing till the end credits
. so wqat ' s the problem
then
? what ' s the point
? what ' s the film baout
? is there anyone whose aspirations coudl inspire less sympathy
? this film cin be described in one sentence
: obscene levle of incompetance
, excessive stupidity in the story line
, gross negligence ofthe the viewer ' s itnelligence
, a prurient interest in teh quick buck
. believe me
, after an hour witht these characters
, acting
and script
, you ' ll start hoping for someone tothe kill somebody
. elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as tje heroine ofthe this film
, that is bad even forthe eszterhas ' scirpt
. her carachter isnt the only one that isnt at least half written
and she could really have done better
. her character denies hte fact that she isnt a whore for thte industry
, selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public
.
" i am not a whore
! i am a dancer
"
, she screams
,
bu does it in such an over dramatized way thgat yuo ' ll strat laughing
. in fact the acting in
" showgirls
" brings terrable tothe a new
and previously unknown level
. not one single achievement
, besides tjhe conventional cinematography
, is worth mentioning
. it is a total waste of time
and money
. there is not a single moent ofthe what yuo might call intelligence
. the dialogue is stuctured of ancient stereotypes
and cliches lined up one after anohter
. its attemt to even imagine to have half a brain results infront a catastrofy
.
" in my films
,
" writes director paul verhoeven
( ' basic instinct '
, ' total recall '
)
,
" i hold the mirror uv to life
.
" well
, excuse me
? his attempt to go behind tjhe scenes of las vegas
,
annd as he put it
" show the naked truth
"
, is simplified
and unreal
. occasionally
, between his collecton ofthe mistakes
and logical irrationalities
, screenwriter joe eszterhas
( the creator ofthe some of the worst screenplays in hollywood ihstory
) inserts smoe lines ofthe deep morality
, tath sound something liek thsi
:
" hey
, i see you
. i see that you ' re hiding
"
-
" from what
?
"
-
" from you
"
. yes
,
and even the only decent line in this film
:
" nomi isnt what las vegas is all about
" can ' t save ' showgirls ' from gonig under
. it ' s a strange phenomena
. it ' s nto erotic
, because it lacks sensuality
. not dramtic
, because it lacks the acting
.
adn not inteligent becuase it lacks a story
. it is simply verhoven ' s bad excuse fo mkaing pornography
. you want to see naked womens
? bare breasts
? full frontals
? it ' s nothing wrong wih taht
.
but in tath case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video sotre
,
and nto waste tiem surviving thru eszterhas ' pathetic dialogue
. b qualities
, while it ' s only a high budget porn
- film
.
