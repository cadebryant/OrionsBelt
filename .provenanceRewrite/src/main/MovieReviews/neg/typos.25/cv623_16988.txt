what ' s to like baout the world of extremely violent trash pornography
-
- ie
. the garbage known as
" snuff
" films
? nothing
, right
? what ' s to like about a film chronicling teh world of voilent trash pornography
? well
.
.
. nothing
. so
, why make it
, hollywood
? there ' s no reason why the average
, sane movie
- goer will be interseted in such a topic
. noone one isnt going to enrich their life or have a good tiem by watching material such as this
. the lack of quality filmmaking inspite
" 8mm
"
( from technical to acting
) stands out even more when you consider the star
, writer
,
and supporting casted
-
- all reputable
.
but joel schumacher
annd his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again
! like paul schrader
, schumacher hasnt his moments
,
but htey ' re few
and far
( far
!
) between
. basically
, this picture is crap
anbd no oen should pay to see it
. why not walk out
? well
, this wouldn ' t be a thorough review baout a thouroughly bad movei
. here ' s why you should spend your monay on dog food or gum instead of
" 8mm
"
.
.
. first thing
-
- if you don ' t heed my advice
,
then understand wqat yuo ' re about to see before you even think baout paying good money fo thsi crud
. it ' s not eazy to watch
. i didn ' t know the details of hte story beforehand
,
bu at least my ignorace can help others now
. the
( ha
!
) plot revolves around tom welles
( nicolas cage
) as a surveillance expert
anbd private investigator
. a rich ood woman discovers a
" snuff
" film in her lite husband ' s safe
. she calls welles
annd hires him to try
and find outloud if the young girl
( it had tothe be a young girl
, didn ' t it
, schumacher
!
) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead
. she ' s horrified tyhat her husban would have owned such a film
( inaddition 8mm
, ofthe course
)
anbd just whants welles to snoop around wihtout polical interference to see what he can fidn
. family
- man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing
and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque
" muder
"
. let me backtrack forthe a moment
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos with a violent twist
-
- people are tortured in very sick ways
and end up dead
.
however
, the deaths are oftenly staged
and
, in those cases
, special effects
and
" good
" acting make all the diference
. vyre sick people enjoy
and pay top dollar for theese hard
- tothe
- find movies
. tyhe thought of this
" inudstry
" mkaes me whant to throw my coputer outloud the window
annd stpo tihs review
,
but i ' ll swallow my bile
and move on
. welles follows clues to hollywood
and the porn industry
. you ' d htikn he ' s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him
! he comes across smut clerk max
( joaquin pheonix
) who knows everyone
adn everything in the underground business of sleaze
. after a lot ofthe digging
and bribing
, welles finds the men who are responsibile for making this
,
and other
,
" snuff
" films
. skip ahead
, skip ahead
, skip ahead
.
.
. led by dino velvet
( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrable performance
)
and star
- torturer
" machine
"
( christopher bauer
)
, they have a big showdown iwth welles where death
adn mayhem ensue
. thte movie doesn ' t end ther
, unforetunately
, because welles has to dont what all heroes inwhich schumacher films do
-
- become a vigilante
. this film doesn ' t draw you in
. it keeps you about 700 miles away ffrom it
and who in theri right mind would wnat tothe get close
? it isnt possible tothe like a film taht focusses onthe grime
adn sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
but it tkaes a large measure of restraint
( schumacher has none
)
and a larger amount of talent
( schumacher has little
)
. by those jabs
, i ' m not only referring to his stylish distruction of the
" batman
" franchise
,
but
" a time tothe kill
" was an immensely overrated disappointment
. for a guy who gets so much studio mnoey
, his track record of making rather bad movies isnt unparalleled
. a good screenwrighter
and a good director cin amking ytou hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter
. writter andrew kevin walker didn ' t recapture hte smarts ofthe the fascinating script he authored fo ' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. director schumacher doesn ' t have that inate ability to make you watch things you don ' t realyl want tothe see liuke better directors are capable of donig
. he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theery thyat what we don ' t see is mroe frightening than wqat we do
( especialy when it ' s a scene where young girl isnt supposed to be murdered
)
.
however
, gratuitous is joel ' s middle name
. he must think that not flaunting a hard
- core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint
. no
, he doesn ' t go thgat far
,
but we see enought unpleasantness
. he doesn ' t leave much to the imagination
. it ' s manipulating to hurt
( or kill
) young girls just to get the audience on the side ofthe a murderous vigilante
. thte script
and acting should be what gets us to believe in theese charachters
,
yet schumacher hasnt no subtlety in his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case iin point
, a shooted ofthe a christian fellowship bus
( ogod
, right
?
) drives away to reveal one of the villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. no subtlety
. does joel think we ' re stupid or that we need tothe be held by teh hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery
? who dont we root forthe in this mess
? is there anybody out ther
? it ' s not all the director ' s fault
,
though
. why doed the actors sign uv for thsi
? nicolas cage is an oscar
- winner
, for cryin ' out loud
! if he claims tothe do films to challege himselv
and for the artistic merit rather thna the money
, what was he smoking when this script dropped onthe his veranda
? waht is cage supposed to be in this movie
-
- a whispering batman without the charisma
and pointed ears
? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy
.
and what is james gandolfini doing infact this trash
? he was so solid as a concerned father in
" a civil acation
"
. i guess ol ' nic
, pete
,
anbd jim were promised a mountain of money
.
.
. or they ' re suckers
. or they just don ' t care
. there are moments
( albeit breif ones
) where tihs rises above the wasteland
. catherine keener isnt ogod
(
although too quick to threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy isnt obviously cute
and wells ' devout love of his daughter is sweet
. the mother
( amy norton
) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daugter
. this film hasnt an appropriate blue
- toned
, washed
- outloud look liek
" payback
"
( which ws a much better movie
)
. yhe editing is okay in scenes ofthe noone dialogue
,
bu at other times it ' s rough
. during some conversations
, close
- ups
and wide shots are not cut very well
, making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren ' t good
and whose timing was a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed stands out
. speaking of standing out
, don ' t believe teh misleading trailers
. ther ' s not much action here
. occasionally
, yes
,
bu not as oftenly as your tv will have yuo blieve
. aftter seing
" 8mm
"
, i may not be interested infront ever watching any kind of porn agian
. is that a positive
? well
, if making me alomst ill at the thougth of glimpsing a dirty movei again is their motive
, they ' ve done a aswell job here
. it ' ll be a long time befor i give a schumacher film another chance
-
- unless i lose my mind
anbd become seriously depraved
.
bu today i ' m not depraved
, so i ask
, why doesnt this film preach thta thsi garbage is out ther
annd that society shoud be worried about it
? i ' m sure tht somewhere right now ther ' s some pretty sick crap going on
,
but thgat doesn ' t mean i need to know about it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your scirpt tells us that there are smoe screwed
- up folks out there
. yes
, mr
. walker
, the proverbial monster doesn ' t look like we expect him to
. you said all that infact 1995
. move onthe
. this film serves noone purpose
. it doesn ' t entertain
, it doesn ' t teach us anytying
, it doesn ' t amking a statment beyond the obvious
" thsi stuff is bad
" approach
. only if this film awakens the authorities tothe find a way to abolish these types of horrors woudl it ever do someting truly worthwhile
. that ' s nto likely to appen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" is indeed a scummy waste of monye
. orson welles said eyars ago inthe a tribute tothe film
,
" tothe movies
.
.
. to good movies
"
. if only joel schumacher
and the producers had listened
and told andrew kevin walker tothe bury this crud deep infact a hole
. like
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" should never hvae been made
. now
, excuse me while i go try tothe forget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme
. he unsed it iin
" batman forever
"
, in
" batman
& robin
"
, in
" a time to kill
"
, in
" falling down
"
,
and it ' s rumoured thast joel himself will play tje vigilante at his breakfast tbale tomorrow
.
