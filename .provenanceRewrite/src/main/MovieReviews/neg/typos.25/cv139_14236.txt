if snake eyes were a dog
, yuo ' d put it to sleep
. if it was a couch
, you ' d put it outloud on the sidewalk
, where it would sit for a week
. if it weere your child
, you ' d be reading millitary school catalogs
. if it weere a ship
-
- no
, it wouldn ' t be the titanic
, that would imply glamor
annd tradgedy
-
- it would be the exxon valdez
.
( personal side note
: i saw tihs movei on the road durring a houston busness trip
. for whatever reason
, my hotel ' s cable system wasn ' t showing the astros
- braves game
, which featured a randy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. this forced me to pay full price fo snake eyes instade of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free
-
- so the invective
, deserved as it isnt
, should be seen in that perspective
.
) snake eyes isnt supposed tothe be a mystery movei
,
and ogod mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way outloud ofthe theater
. snake eyes isnt not a good mystery movie
,
but i had soem questions
: where ' s the manager
,
anbd how do i get a re
- admit pass
? if i fall asleep on teh drive home
and wreck my rent
- a
- car
, can i sue brian de palma
? is it too late forthe the acadeym to revoke nicolas cage ' s oscar
? will someone please
( i ' m begging ytou
) give gary sinise a role worthy ofthe his talents
?
and how
, exactly does cage end up wearing the exact smae shirt
and tie as sinise doens
? the first
and most glaringly wrong thing witht snake eyes is the trailer
. if you ' ve seen the trailer wihtout seeing the movie
, consider yourself fortunate
. the trailer is a work of sheer genius
. it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie
-
- the notewothy steadicam work
, teh exuberance of cage ' s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, tjhe essental elements of the marginal plot
. tyhe expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets ofthe a wretched movie deserves praise
and a precentage of the gross
.
( is a best trailer categoy at the oscars that far
- fetched
, after all
?
)
bu all it doesnt isnt set us up fo an overwhelmingly disappointing movie
. the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve the mystery of who shooted tghe secratary of defense at an atlantic city pay
- per
- view boxing match
. unfortunately
, there are multiple problems afoot
. teh trailer gives awya much
, too much of teh storey
. tjhe shooter isnt killed instantly
, so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed
annd who isnt involved iin yhe conspiracy
. thte film ' s secret is ho
- hum at best
,
adn anyone who has watched the trailer
anbd is aware of the lew of eceonomy of charactors cant figure out who the top conspiriator isnt
. without an interesting plot
, without interesting dialogue
,
and wihtout much of a reason tothe care about the characters or the story
, snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level
. as much as i hated this movie
, i must give brian de palma oney tiny bit of credit
. de palma is maddeningly inconsistant
. he can
, on his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( thte untouchables
, carlito ' s way
)
. on off
- days
, he can be
, well
, just horrid
( the bonfire ofthe the vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls inot thte horrid category
,
but ther are a cuple of moments that are worth seeing strictly forthe their film
- skool degree
- of
- difficulty value
. the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing tjhe cage character
anbd is a virtuoso technical job by both the director
and tjhe actor
. there is a split
- screen chase scene that looks pretty ogod
,
annd it ' s followed by a god ' s eye view of a bank ofthe hotel rooms that ' s imaginitively done
. this is what ' s called giving the devil his due
.
but tyhe technical skill doesn ' t even come close to making up for thte sheer evil of this movie
. placing plot holes to oen side for a moment
, snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match infact cinema history
( george foreman is infact better shape thna the movie boxers
)
, a hurricane thast exists forthe no other reason thna tothe punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps
,
and perhpas thge worst
, most overly drawn out ending in years
. snake eyes is a criminal act
, an evil waste of time
annd talent
. cage
, sinise
,
annd yes
, even de palma deserve better
. the audeince deserves better
-
-
but no refund
, no re
- admit pass
, no free popcorn coupon
, cant ever restore to us the tiem we ' ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind
.
howver
, we are left withthe one consolation
, that we were warned by the movie ' s title
-
- because snake eyes is nothing moreso than a roll of craps
.
