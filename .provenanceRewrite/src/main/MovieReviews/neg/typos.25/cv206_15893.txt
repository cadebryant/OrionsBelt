this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup
,
and i kind of feel like i have to sday something negative about this film
. no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties tht should not be taked with a historical story
.
however
, even if one thinks ofthe it as fiction
,
" the prince ofthe egypt
" rimaniss shallow
.
bu i ' ll begin from the beginning
. tghe biggest difference between the original
, biblical tsory
and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in thge bible
, whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero
. maybe it ' s just me
,
but if i knew i had god on my side
, i ' d have a littel bit mroe confidence
. htere are other differences as well
, such as a lack of imporatnt female characters
and tghe passing over of the original pharoah ' s death like it ' s nothing
bu a thnig
. most of all
,
though
, the stopry ' s focuse has shifted
. rather than bieng a story about father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" the prince of egypt
" isnt almost solely about the brother
- brother relationship between rameses
and moses
. i was originally excisted about this story element until i saw the movei
, where it came off as maudlin
. rameses
and moses squabble like children
and
then
, in the interests ofthe peace
, moses saves rameses ' butt
, even
though moses was yhe oen who started it
.
.
.
* yawn
* i didn ' t care anymore by thge time moses ran off for murdering an overseer
( which
, of course
, never hapened in tghe original sotry
- moses was exiled
)
.
but enough baout the differences
. let ' s talk baout the movie itself
. it features a moses who
, inthe the interests of making the charactor moreso human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, whic isn ' t convincing at all tothe anyone who knows who god is
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least is given dignity by thge voicework of ralph fiennes
( ffrom schindler ' s list
, among otehr things
)
. the film allso features an extremely annoying character by way of the
" new
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by the ever
- antsy sandra bullock
, even
though the most irritating thign about her is her tendency tothe burst inot song for no apparent reason
( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking of which
, it countains
* veyr
* annoying music
. it countains shallow writing
. it features extraordinary animation
, whihc isnt one good thing i can say baout this film
. most ofthe all
, it contains an attempt to commercialize
, homogeneize
,
and mass
- market a story baout a manifestation of god
. i am nto christian
,
but i got the impression of blasphemy
. the writers
anbd producers took a butcher knife
and chop
- chopped inot thge stor
.
