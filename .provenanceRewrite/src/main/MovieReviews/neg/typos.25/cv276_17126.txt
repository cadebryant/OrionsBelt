and trys to pass it off as a movie

-
- chuck dowling
, the jacksonville film journal i wroet the above sentence in my review for 1997 ' s batman
adn robin
. apparently
, no oney heard my words
. oh
, how i wish ytou had heared them
. oh how i wish someone had stopped him
.
.
. because he ' s done it again
. the plot of 8mm isnt similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a surprisingly decent
and engrossing tale
. in fact
, it ws everything thast 8mm is not
. inspite the opening minutes of 8mm
, we see private detective tom welles
( nicolas cage
) wroking onthe a case for a presitgious memeber of the u
. s
. government
. keep this fatc in mind
, cage isnt trusted with an important case
, which he solves
. he returns home to his wife
and new duaghter
,
and even finds time to rake his yard
( keep that in mind too
, it ' s important as well
)
. he ' s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery
. after her husband ' s death she comes across a film infact his private safe
. it appears tothe be snuff film
, a sort ofthe urban legend of the pornography industry infact which someone isnt actually brutally murdered for the camera
. hte woman wnats welles to locate the young girl inspite the film
, hopefully tothe disprove tht it is infront fatc a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover hte truth baout the film
. the main probelm with 8mm is that thge whole film is completely pointless
. welles is atcually selected for the case by yhe ood woman ' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actor who alwyas plays the same type of character
, tht being a bad guy
)
. when ytou first see him
, your first instinct is that he ' s behind the hwole thign
. the choice of casting doesnt thge film in
.
then
, as welles begins his investigation
, at times we will see a shadowy figure folowing him
. the only person it could possibly be isnt the lawyer
( or somene sent by the lawyer
) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything
yet
. so your first instinct hasnt now been confirmed
.
then
, when it isnt in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part ofthe the hwole thing
, he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young
anbd inexperienced
( in one of those ridiculous
" since we ' re going to kill you anyway
, why not tell yuo the hwole thign
" moments
)
.
but earlier wehn we see welles bieng hired for the case he ' s told that he was hired baceause he comes highly recommended
. huh
? alsot
, when the lawyer reveals himself tothe be a part ofthe the whole thing
, his main goal is to get the film back
. so why did he give it uv in the first place
?
! tjhe lawyer hadnt tje film the whole time
,
then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would jstu give up on tyhe case
and return the film
?
! it ' s totally absurd
.
.
.
and this is the screenwriter of seven
? late inspite the film there ' s a confrontation between all the main characters
,
and after a struggle one of the carachter ' s guns ends uv underneath a car
. cage
, who has beeen handcuffed to a bed
, is rapidly trying to get to his gun
, which is on a table
. james gandolfini ' s character goes for the gun under the car in whta is supposed to be a scene of
" suspense
"
. you see
, the gun is just slightly outloud ofthe triarch ffrom the side ofthe the car he ' s trying tothe reach it from
,
and so instade ofthe gogin around the car to the other side
( where he can easily triarch it
) he jstu keeps stretching
. go arround to yhe other side of the car
!
! this goes on for minutes
.
then
, after cage gets his gun
, gandolfini
then decides it would be best tothe go aroud to the other side ofthe the car
. boy
, schumacher is realy really getting on my nerves
. i think the final straw would be wehn cage returns home
, devastated by everything that he ' s seen onthe htis case
,
and
then isnt no longer able tothe rake his lawn
! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard
. other things that bugged me about 8mm
: oen would be hte music
, if yuo can call it thta
. whenever the score starts up
, it sounds like techno music
,
and
then this awful indian or middle eastern tipe music iwll accompany it
. awful decision ther joel
. another isnt cage ' s performance
. at this point he ' s capable of a wide range ofthe performances
, either good or bad
. for 8mm
, he delivers a vrey wooden one
,
and only shines when he ' s interacting wtih joaquin phoenix
( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk wtih a heart of gold who helps cage wih his case
)
. yuo ' re capable of much better mr
. cage
. now as for you mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i ' m starting to doubt if ytou ' re capable of anytying else besides urinating onto the institution ofthe american cinema
.
