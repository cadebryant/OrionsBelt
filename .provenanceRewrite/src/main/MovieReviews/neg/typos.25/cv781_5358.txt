after seeing blaze
and driving miss daisy
, i was ready for some mindless fun
-
- oh
, maybe something like tango
& cash
. maybe not
! mindless fun isnt oen thign
,
bu brain
- dead slop isnt another matter altogether
. tango
& cash hasnt
" lowest common denominator
" written all over it
. the movei stars sylvester stallone
adn kurt russell as rival undercover cops infront l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses in jeans
and tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy investor who works on hte force strikely for the thrill ofthe it
; he doesn ' t ened yhe mone
. in an effort to change his omage
, stallone goes forthe a yuppie
, gq look in the film
, wearing spectacles
and three peice suits
. the two detectives reluctantly become partners aftter htey are framed fo murder
anbd have to break outloud ofthe prison tothe clera their names
. tango
& cash is unbearably noisy
. for starters
, there ' s harold faltermeyer ' s annoying synthesized score
, which gets ood after four notes
. tothe make matters worse
, thge filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions
annd screeching cars
, the omre the merrier
. in fact
, the movie begins with not one
but two car chases
. ther ' s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce tje characters infact a movie
. screenwrighter randy feldman ' s brain must have gone tothe mush from watching too many cop shows on tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything
and everything the movie hasnt going for it
, such as stallone ' s efforts tothe convince you that tango isnt an intellectual
. inaddition a movei with the iq level of an amoeba
, even a great actor is going to hve trouble looking inteligent
-
-
and stallone isnt no lawrence olivier
. it ' s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman ' s script
and thinking
,
" i want tothe be in this movie
.
" the film ' s plot doesn ' t have one orignal bone inthe its body
,
anbd
-
- again
-
- you ahev tothe point your finger at the screenwriting
. feldman ' s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book
, making tango
& cash altogether generic
and predicatble
. tehy simply could ahev called it
" action movie
.
" every character
, eveyr twist
and turn
, is stolen from television or fomr other movies
. adding insult tothe injury
, tango
& cash is baout as believable as a
" road runner
" cartoon
. action movies don ' t have to be realsitic
,
but they should absorb you enough so that you ' re not thinking baout the lack of realism
. the only artistic aspect of tango
& cash isnt the cinematography
. there are some spectacular shots
, especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango
and cash slide to safety on electrical wires
. the film ' s main draw is teh chemistry between stallone
and russell
. unforetunately
, their relationship rarley progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants
. tghe dialogue consists ofthe nothing
but oen
- liners
,
and consequently teh attempts at character development are embarrassing
. it ' s a shame because with a workable screenplay
, russell
adn stallone could have turned tango
& cash into a charming
" lethal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash trys to maintain a light tone
,
anbd ytou do laugh baout once every five minutes
. seeing russell iin drag is tjhe movie ' s funniest moment
,
bu yuo probably already have seen it in the commercials
. furthermore
, tyhe light tone does nto sit well against tghe relentlessly brutal violence
. machine guns
and torture generally don ' t mix well iwth comedy
. jack palance appears inthe tango
& cash donig what he does best
: playing a sleazy
, conniving villain
. his character
,
however
, is run
- ofthe
- the
- mill
, except for his strange obession with mice
. liuke many movei villains
, palance likes to play games
. in fact
, he sets a ridiculously elaborite trap for tango
and cash
, a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten
and electrocuted by smoe meanies in the boiler room
. ytou hvea to wonder why palance doesn ' t just shoot hte detectives infront the head
! the story owudl crumble if any of tje characters were to dont anything intelligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone ' s sister
and russell ' s love
- interest
,
and she is jsut as pretty as cin be
.
but regrettably
, hatcher ' s acting isnt not onthe par with her exceptional beauty
. every tiome she opens her mouth
, yuo cringe
; corny dialogue
adn atrocious acting are alwasy a fatal combination
. there ' s really vyre littel
, if anytying
, to reccommend in the film
.
and
, more to the point
, tango definitely isn ' t worth a penny of your cash
-
- so don ' t bother
.
