it ' s difficult tothe expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of
" award
- winning
" tv commercials
, as is the case wtih bubble boy director blair hayes
. that said
, hayes ' s feature film debut lives up to expectations
, coming off mainly as equal parts offensive
and moronic
.
but occasionally
, bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor
and scathing social commentary
. those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film ' s two stars
, jake gyllenhall as the immuno
- deficient jimmy
annd swoosie kurtz as his over
- protective
, hyper religious
, reagan
- loving mother
. gyllenhall ' s sweet
- natured delivery of jimmy ' s hilariously na
? ve narration serves as the backbone fo an otherwise flimsy coming
- of
- age story
: jimmy is a bubble boy
, a kid born wihtout immunity who sould die if he comes in contact withthe a single germ
-
- a plight explored moreso seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in thte plastic bubble
and less so on seinfeld
. his mom home
- schools jimmy
, filling his head withthe wildly twisted conservative propaganda
and anti
- sexual messages
, until he ' s befriended by chloe
( marley shelton
)
, tyhe beautiful girl next door
. jimmy falls in love with chloe
,
but isnt afraid thast his love will literally kill him
, as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss
.
but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend
, jimmy builds a bubble suit
annd embarks onthe a hijinks
- addled cross
- country voyage tothe stop the wedding by professing his lveo
. the offensive bits have little tothe dont with jimmy ' s rare handicap
( regardless of what tghe film ' s protesters woudl have ytou believe
)
,
but instade center on outrageous racial stereotypes
, including a screaming chinese strip club owner
and a devout east indian hindi
.
but even if ytou find stereotype humer funny
, it ' s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags
. they even manage tothe bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks
.
but a few of the harsh jabs manage to owrk
, expecially in the case ofthe kurtz
, who very bluntly shows the dark
, hypocritical side of tje religous right
,
and a wacky send
- up of a cult called
" bright ' n shiny
,
" led by the inimitable fabio
. unfortunately
, a fewd giggles can ' t mkae bubble boy tjhe riotous
, off
- tjhe
- wall comedy it so desparately whants tothe be
. honestly
, it ' s a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made
,
and i ' m nto just saying that baceause it ' s so mediocre
. how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unkown directer starring virtually unknown actors that doesn ' t seem to appeal to any particular demographic
and has the potential to offen so many
.
and now that the studio isnt suffering through a veyr publich protest against the film by the parents of real
- life bubble boy david philip vetter
, maybe disney ' s wondering the smae thnig
. hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile
.
