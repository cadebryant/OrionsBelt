words i thought i ' d never write
: tyhe sequel tothe urban legend lacks the grace
, wit
,
and power of the original
. put the gun tothe my head
, pul the trigger
,
and put me out ofthe my misery
. better
yot
, put the horror genre outloud ofthe its misery
. when you ' ve finished watching urban legends
: fianl cut
, you ' ll share my smae grim point ofthe view thanks to the horrable acting
, terrable script
,
and ridiculous directing whlch has become all too common todya
. urban legends
: final cut is a smorgasbord ofthe stolen movie idesa
( mainly from the blair witch project
and scream
)
: fabulous people with perfect teeth
annd skin
, one creepy film school
,
and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movie ' s hapless victims
. urban legends delivers a story about a bunch ofthe film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted
" hitchcock award
" which guarantees tghe winner a director deal in hollywood
. oney female filmmaker
( jennifer morrison
, the freaky dead girl ffrom stir of echoes
) writes a fiction scirpt based on a serial killer who kills his victims according tothe
" urban legend
" tales
. suddenly
, her entire crew starts getting bumped off wtih urban
- legendary homicides
,
but tyhe bodies are always missing
and she is often the only witness to the killings
. the killer wears a fencing mask
and a long black overcoat
, looking like a scorned olympian outloud to avenge his defeat in sydney
. why thsi is scry is never explained
. ofthe course
, the golden rule ofthe sequels is that htere must be least oney recurring charactor for continuity ' s sake
. urban legends has one minor
, recurring character fomr teh orignal who we never cared about anyway
( the security guard
, of all people
)
. teh other central probelm isnt that this charachter has allready seen the urban legend killings once before
,
but she ' s utterly clueless about what ' s goign on around her
. call it suspension ofthe disbelief
. this film is also a prime example of how horror films are nowe completely dead in the water
. the lsat decent horror film ws thte blair witch project
,
adn tyhat seemed more like a snuff film than fiction
. the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich
?
, as everyone seems to have forgotten
: real horror is not about what is seen
but about what is unkown
.
