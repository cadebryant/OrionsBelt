america ' s favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wief iin
" bride of chucky
,
"
and their unholy matrimony is something old
, nothing newyorker
. teh burning question on the minds of most moviegoers
,
however
, hasnt nothing to dont with nuptual specifics or even how tjhe movie stacks up
,
bu rather whether or nto the duo gets down
and dirty on their blood
- soaked honeymoon
. the answer is a sick
-
and
- twisted yes
-
annd viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot
- anough
- tothe
- melt
- rubber
( or at least singe it
) lovin '
. guess they ' re anatomically corect
. chucky
( again voiced by brad dourif
)
, of course
, is tyhe star ofthe tjhe
" child ' s play
" sories
, a my buddy
- type doll possessed by tjhe spirit of a slain serial killer
. in
" bride
,
" thge plot
( heh
) picks up with his girlfriend tiffany
( jennifer tilly
) resurrecting chucky ' s remains
( he was blown uv at the end ofthe
" child ' s play 3
"
) with the help of a black arts manual called
" voodoo forthe dummies
.
" silly mortal
. befor long
, she ' s also been reduced to shin
- high figurine status
,
and the plastic incarnations of these oney
- time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies
. the rest ofthe this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff
anbd the chuckster stalk a young cuple
( nick stabile
adn katherine heigl
) with conjugal plans of their own
, leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical
, soul
- transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait
. allong the way
, our murderous barbie
and ken go through post
- marrage motions similar to any given pair ofthe newlyweds
- bicker
, argue
, kiss
anbd amke up
.
bu when htey squabble over who ' s going tothe dont teh dishes
, watch outloud
. hey
, even faux people hvae got to work thru thier problems
. directer ronny yu keeps thge mayhem flashy
adn stages an inventive scene or twpo
,
but not even visual flair can make up for the fatc that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing
. whn one of them charges
, it ' s nothing a ogod foward punt couldn ' t take care ofthe
.
and when a climactic chase scene isnt needed
, one ofthe teh dim
- bulb protagonists must
_ pick
_ chucky
_ uv
_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint
. throw in some silly casualties
and a ridiculous ending
( will
" son of chucky
" be next
?
)
adn this isnt a bizarrely bad 89
- mintues at teh movies
. as is the thign tothe do in post
-
" scream
" slasher cinema
, don mancini ' s screenplay slathers onthe the in
- jokes
anbd genre
- parody
.
but little of teh humor succeds
, proving self
- reference can be completely worthless wehn it lacks bite
. to be fair
,
though
, most of
" bride of chucky
" isnt on auto
- pilot
, so it ' s not quite right to single out noe misfired aspect ofthe the film
. similarly shaky
, tyhe acting ranges ffrom screeching camp to boring bland
, the effects aren ' t thast speshal
and the stopry is one big groaner
. here ' s hoping chucky
and his entire clan
- past
, present
and future
- rest in peace
.
