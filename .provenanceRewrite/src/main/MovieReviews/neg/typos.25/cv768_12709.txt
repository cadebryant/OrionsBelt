this is one of the worst big
- screen film experiences i ' ve hadnt for a while
. with this film
, plus
` showgirls '
and
` basic instinct '
, paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currenly one of the worst blockbuster directors
. his celebrated film
` total recall ' wass
? i admit
? successfully scripted
,
but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws
. obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven
, the result bieng that much of tyhe special effects in
` starship ' seemed fake
.
but not everything bad in the film was tje director ' s fault
, even
though he was one of the guys who employed tyhe actors
. it is surprising that none ofthe the actors received nominations fo tjhe razzie awards
( i expeced five for the acting catagories
)
. casserole vanity devoid
, dense ribald
, dingy miasma
,
and jackass bushy are in serious ened of acting school
. no
, they have tothe pass primary skool drama classes first
. while
` total ' was written well
,
` starship ' is purely pathetic
. all right
, it is supposed tothe be a fast
- pased enteratinment film
,
and you ' re supposed tothe turn off your intellect
( completly
)
anbd enjoy the action sequences
and special effects
( that is
, guts
and gore
)
. as a matter of fact
, i foudn the activity incredibly boring
, a complete waste of more thna two hours
. half of the film was a bad episode of
` beverly hills 90210 '
( dina meyer was in
" beverly hills
"
)
, while another quarter ws simpley nothing
( thigns liuke presenting irrelavent information in an irritating way onthe the web
)
,
and the rest was a display ofthe humans fighting computer
- generated images
. the battles were all teh smae
? jumping around
, shoot or get stabbed
?
and onthe barren planets that only hadnt giant insects
. there weren ' t even any stunts
, which i consider slightly more exciting thna pictures running aroud
. i wonder waht yhe insects eat
, if htere ' s nothing
but them onthe the planets
? ther is so much laughable treatment in this film
,
annd it is frankly not amusing whn jokes are intended
. this tipe of story is obviously aimed at 10
- year
- olds
, who can ' t see it anyway because of teh violentce
and some sexuality
.
but
then
, there are always 16
- eyar
- olds who hvea thast frame of mind
. the pointless plot begins when johnny ' s
( vanity devoid
) girlfriend carmen
( richards
) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth
. johnny
then signs uv as a trooper also
, after an overacted argument wih his parents
.
but there isnt anyother girl
, dizzy
( meyer
)
, who likes johnny
and
thne there is anyother boy who likes carmen
, which results in a love quadrangle
, which isn ' t better
, because it means augmented worse
- than
- stereotyped soap opera
, increased bitchiness
,
and more bad beverly hills
+ melrose
.
and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is aslo rather stupid
. anyway
, getting back to thte thing you might call plot
, johnny is too stupid to be a pilot
and hasnt to join tghe infanty
, while his girl
and tghe otehr dude are in the same league
. dizzy comes chasing johnny
and joins the infantry alsot
. they
then start training
, which contains what roger ebert calls ips
( idiat plot syndrome
, moments when only an idiot woudl have made such obvious mistakes
)
,
then real combat
.
and guess what
? thyat ' s about as complex as it gets
. oh
,
adn oen of theri friends
, carl
( neil patrick harris a
. k
. a
. doogie howser m
. d
.
)
, becomes involved inspite war intelligence
,
annd his abilities at the end are relaly corny
and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it
. he ' s my fifth nom for a razzie
. the troopers fight
, fall in loev
, dieu
, kill
,
and try to act
. naturaly
, htey win
, or sort ofthe half
- win
. of course
, in between
(
and at the end
) there are soliders chatting
adn smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs
. tjhe bugs also suffer from ips
: why would you release hold of your captive before killing it
? isn ' t it allso amazing that earthlings haven ' t invented better hand
- held weapons by
then
? the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead ofthe zero
. well
, maybe a
- quarter
( of a star
) fo the originality of the co
- sex shower scene
and the
( veyr
) brief moments of suspense
, another quarter for copying
` zulu '
and letting the ogod guys
( the bugs
) win
,
anbd half a star for the sucking
- outloud of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors
(
but there should ahev been more
, the troopers deserved to die
)
