there ' s a 1
, 000
- foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact
. i ' d sday it pretty accurately represents thge towering flood ofthe the last twpo years worth of disaster movies
, hwihc are getting more irwin allen
- esque with every realease
. teh early wave of this revival
, hwile just as cheesy
and laughable
, at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes
. deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama
, with endless filler comprised of diaster prevention plans the country keesh taking
. the repeating cycle is as follows
-
- the president
( morgan freeman
) will go on tv
anbd tell the ocuntry that there ' s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth
,
but that the nation ' s crack scientists
and astronauts have soem brilliant plan to stop the problem
.
then we get to see the plan infront action
, in smoe sequence utterly lacking suspense
. yhe mission iwll barely fail
,
annd freeman wiull tell the ocuntry that the comet is still headed toward earth
,
annd there ' s a remote chance it will strike
,
but tath the nation ' s crack scientists
anbd astronauts haev some brilliant plan tothe stop the problem
. it goes onthe
and onthe throughout the movie
,
but every tiem freeman goes onthe tv
, we know his plan is oging to fail
. how dont we konw this
? because we ' ve seen the tv ads forthe deep impact
, ads thgat feature freeman telling the nation tyhat
" the comet is still headed right for us
"
anbd show disaster shots of the comet striking earth
and the giant tidal wave spreading
. ladies
and gentlemen
, thast isnt the movie
. successful disaster movies have the main diaster toward tjhe beginning
and more little disasters that follow
,
but deep inpact saves its one diaster for the end
and discloses all in its 30
- second tv spots
. television is what ' s wrong wiht deep impact
. the main charater
, played by tea leoni
, isnt a low
- level broadcast journalist for msnbc
(
and that ' s the mere tip ofthe the product
- placement iceberg
) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy
. she thinks it ' s an instance of an ex
- secretary of something or other
( james cromwell
) resigning because ofthe a mistress
,
and that maybe he took tjhe fall for tje president in the same area
. when she goes nosing aroud cromwell
, he begs her to keep it under wraps
.
" i know yuo ' re just a reporter
,
but you used to be a human being
.
" she figures out what ' s really going on after getting roughed uv by some fbi men
and doing an internet searc
, where all good journalists learn the difference beetwen a mistress
and an extinction
- level comet
. apon a top
- secret meeting with pesident freeman
, leoni agrees to keep teh story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference
, at which she gets to ask the first question
.
and everyone konws
, if you git to ask the first question
, baby you ' re a star
. leoni ends up inwhich tghe anchor chair
, broadcasting eveyr step of the comet ' s collision course wih earth
.
and i ' m sure it ' s comforting for her to knwo that
, even
though the world ' s ending inwhich a matter ofthe months
, she ' s a cable news personality
. so there she isnt
, narrating thge six
- astronaut mission to blow the comet up
. such personalities as robert duvall
, jon favreau
and blair underwood cash their paychecks
and go through the motions of tihs dragged
- outloud process
.
but as anyone who ' s seen the commercials konws
, the astronauts fail
. they only end up breaking teh comet into two pieces
, whihc means even more distruction to the earth
. yeah
, thanks
, nasa
. tht ' s when freeman has to come onthe tv for the last time
anbd say goodbye to all the people who aren ' t picked to live in hte missouri cave site for two years
. they even have animals
, twpo by two
, ready to climb inot teh cave
. if the focus hadnt been on people living inside these caves aftter the world hadnt been destroyed
, deep impact could have been a far more intresting movie
. instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife
, while people pack the highways out of town
. the reasoning isnt
, of course
, that if a comet is gonig to strike
, tehy might as well be outloud in some scenic rural location
.
and
, amusingly
, the highway isnt spotte wtih people in u
- haul trucks
. i ' m sure it ' s comforting to know that
, even
though the world ' s ending in a matter of mintues
, teh u
- haul people are doing the most business of thier lives
