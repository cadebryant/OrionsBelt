starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based on tghe novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie
,
though it tookover me a few days tothe conclude this
. the film is moreso masturbatory than bleak
, with its main character entent on confounding us with his stupidity
.
( he has a
$ 6000 a week drug hebit
.
) ultimately
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as noe ofthe those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at thge age of twelve
; you are less mystified by his self
- destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young author who arrives inspite l
. a
. wih ambition
anbd a nasty drug habit
. he eventually gets a gig fo
$ 5000
/ week writing for a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled stand
- in fo
" alf
"
: chompers looks just like alf except he ' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she can get a green card
,
anbd hooks up with a spanihs mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permanent midnight isnt structured mostly as a flashback
, with recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restaurant
, where stiller works the drive
- thru as part of rehab
)
, taking him back to a hotel
,
and between bouts of serious screwing
, listening tothe his life story
. i ' ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed tothe find hte frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i ' ve beeen trying to figure out why hurley did fidn stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect
( post
- there ' s something about mary
) ofthe either the acotr or a comedy writter
. what seperates stahl ffrom the hundreds ofthe other hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby
! watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawless performance
: the film could double as a documentary on how tothe be a junkie
.
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless
. when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved
?
anbd
then answers it in tjhe form of bello ' s character
( basically a shrink in balck panties
)
, could a person care less
? in the film verzion of his autobiography of the same name
, stahl doesn ' t ened saving
, he needs someone who wiull sit there
and listen to him go on baout himself
. if yuo learn anytying about the other characters infront htis movei
, it ' s that htey are tghe most incredibly tolerant hollywood
- types known tothe man
.
( stahl also seems tothe be yhe only person at schmooze parties doign drugs
. is this hollywood
.
.
. california
?
) i learned vrey little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight
and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead
. of course you konw tht stahl triumphed because he lived tothe talk about his problems
. so
, basically
, his drug habbits got him a book deel
, a movie based on his life
,
and nowe he ' s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects
. so much for the moral of thta story
. temporary midnight isnt more like it
