i am constinually amazed at movies like this
. that some producer owudl waste an abundance of talent
and money onthe a script as abysmal as this one is mind
- boggeling
,
but it seems to happen a lot nowadays
.
" wild wild west
" is a beautifully filmed
, well acted
,
and well directed piece of garbage
;
anbd its insipid screenplay isnt completely at fault
. in short
, this movie is a comedy wihtout laughs
. so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal
. the high production values keep it from bieng a total fiasco
,
bu it ' s still pretty boring
. will smith stars as jim west
, an ood western
, r
& b variation of the james bond character
. west is teamed uv with artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
,
annd they ' re pretty much polar oppisites
: west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets
, gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach
. talk about deeply developed charactors
. at any rate
, thsi leads to the inevitable conflicts beween methodologies
, none of which are funny
. the year is 1869
. several top scientists have been abducted
,
and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled fromer confederate general
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. president grant sends west
and gordon to investingate
. ther ' s evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana
. west
and gordon show up
and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, another disgruntled former confederate
. as it turns outloud
, loveless plans to ule the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weppon
, wich he will use to conquer the united states
. i ' d go futher iwth the plot
,
but there isn ' t any point
. htis film ' s narrative isnt littel more tahn a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i onyl laughed at a couple of jokes
,
and
then onyl lightly
. there isn ' t oney truly uprorously funny moent in this film
,
annd tht ' s pretty disasterous when yuo consdider thast it ' s primarily a comedy
. as i said
, yhe fault is totally that ofthe the script
. when yuo consider thier respective roles
, iwll smith
and kevil kline do as ogod as they coudl ahev possibly done
. the leads could ' ve beeen played samuel l
. jackson
and robert de niro
and the film still woudl ' ve been awful
. no one
,
and i mean no one
, cant make a line liek
" bye bye
, mr
. knife guy
!
" sound good
. still
, this film has a lot going for it visually
. hte set design is fantastic
, maybe even oscar worthy
. the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who was also behind camera infact martin scorsese ' s brilliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, is absolutely stunning
. he lends the film a much needed exciting
, comic bookish look
. i won ' t fault barry sonnenfeld either
. he does a fine job ofthe directing thte proceedings
,
but
, like the rest of tje people involved with the film
, there really isn ' t anytying that he can dont to correct its oney major flaw
. despite bieng beautifully made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes qutie boring after tjhe half
- way point
. tghe appeal of tje visuals ends long befor the film does
. if
" wild wild west
" didn ' t look so ogod
, it would be almost insufferable
. as it is
, it ' s somewhat tolerable
,
bu not very entertaining
. it hurts tothe give such a well made movei a score this low
,
bu ther isn ' t anytying much worse than an unfunny comedy
.
