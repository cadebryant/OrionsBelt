200 cigarettes takes place onthe new yearm ' s eve 1981
. monica
, played by martha plimpton isnt having a huge new yearm ' s party
. everyone inspite town is trying to git there
,
bu soem are caught up in other thigns
. this isnt the basic plot of 200 cigarettes
. as we meet the characters headed towards the party
, we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal
,
and not interesting at all
. this dissapointed me greatly
. the film should have been omre about tghe party than teh people trying to git there in my opinion
. lucy
, played by courtney love
, is wih kevin
, played by paul rudd
. the two are in a relationship that is mroe of a friendship
,
but starts to blossom into something mroe than that
. tihs subplot isnt extremely boring
anbd dull
,
and i am getting qtuie sick ofthe plots like that
. janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot
, dealing with kevin
. she plays ellie
, an ex
- girlfriend of kevin ' s
. this subplot isnt completely a waste of garofalo ' s talent
. there was no point tothe it at all
,
and it was hardly even in the movei
. when lucy runs inot a bartender
, played by ben affleck
, another subplot is formed
. the bartender is invited by lucy to come tothe monica ' s party
. at teh bar
, he runs into two more girls
. the girls are palyed by angela featherstone
anbd nicole parker
,
but unfortunately
, due tothe hte terrible acting of both of them
, i don ' t even remeber their characters names
. ben affleck isnt a ogod actor
,
bu his character doesn ' t go anywhere so he doesn ' t have much screen time to give a good performance
. featherstone
and parker are horrible in their roles
,
and htey are part ofthe the reason the film is so bad
. christina ricci plays val
,
and gaby hoffman plays stephie
. the two girls are trying tothe get to the party
but are extremely lost
. tehy meet some guys
and end up going around with them all night
. htis subplot was alright
,
but it was quite annoying iwth stephie ' s accent
. hoffman doed an okay job of acting
,
but ricci did ogod
. she was underused
, concidering she isnt such a wonderful actress
. anyother subplot in the film is the relationship vetween cindy
, played by goldie hawn ' s daughter
,
and jack
, played by jay mohr
. jack is an actor who doesn ' t care about the girls he goes out with
, he just likes dates forthe oen night
,
and thte enxt day he doesn ' t
. kate hudson is a huge klutz
. she gets herself into vyer funny situations
, that are the funniest parts in the entire movie
. they are probably the only funny parts in yhe entire movei as well
. this subplot could hvae beeen utilizied more
, mailny due to hudson ' s performance
. mohr wasn ' t good
,
but he wasn ' t bad
. he ws just alright
, wich i didn ' t find acceptable
. there is not much tothe sday about the performances in tghe film
. none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not
. the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci ' s as allways good performance
, kate hudson ' s funny role
, courtney love ' s mediocre peformance
,
and paul rudd ' s annoying
and overused performance
. i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr
, ben affleck
, casey affleck
, gaby hoffman
, dave chapelle
,
and especially out ofthe janeane garofalo
. the twpo strongest things in the film weere the great soundtrack
and the original costumes
. martha plimpton
and christina ricci had vyre different
and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981
. tyhe soundtrack is full ofthe 1980 ' s tunes
, ranging from
" i want candy
" to
" tainted love
.
" thte songs iin the movei aslo helped create thte feel tht you were bakc in the 1980s
. during the film
, i oftenly found mysef asking hte questions
,
" is htere a reason tothe this
? isnt there any moral story
? is htere a point
? are any ofthe the events going on in the film necessary
? do i care what lucy
and kevin are going through
?
" the movie is extremely boring
,
and by the time htey reached eleven
- o
- clock
, oen hour before midnight
, i could not wait for yhe movei to be over
. tghe plot is okay
,
but the subplots make it terrible
. maybe if the film was about the party
, nto about the people at the party
, it could ahve beeen a lot better
. the bottom line
: just liek a slasher movei
, tihs
? 80s comedy is jstu one too many
.
