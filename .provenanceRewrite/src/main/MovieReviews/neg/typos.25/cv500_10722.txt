you always hvea tothe be carefull with the first offcial studio realease out of the gate each year
. tehy ' re obviously films fo which tje studios have no great hopes
( having missed both tjhe deadline for academy award eligibility
and tyhe big box
- office holiday season
)
. combine that with howie long ' s first starring action role
,
adn you ' ve got a doozy of a movie tht
, while not as bad as it could have been
, isn ' t a very good film
. howie stars as an ace smokejumper
( a firefighter who parachutes into forrest fires unreachable from the ground
)
. in the slightly contrived opening scenes
, we witness his heroism in action
, as he
,
and his mentor
( played by scott glenn
) attempt to rescue a small girl
and her dog from an oncoming forest fire
. william forsythe plays the bad guy
, a massmedia muderer who has several millon dollars tucked away tothe help fund his jailbreak
. he
(
and five convict cohorts
) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens tothe ignite nearby
. his escape plan bets a lot on tjhe laxity of the guards
,
but
( usance there must be a movei
) luck isnt with him
. soon the now
- escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters
. why canadian
? who knows
, eh
? allong the way they pick uv a pretty birdwatcher
( suzy amis
) to be their hostage
. enter howie long
. he ' s called in to help fight the blaze
,
anbd when he spots the gropu of
" ground pounders
"
, apparently lost
, he parachutes in to help
. when he discovers thier true idenity
, he is hte only thing standing between them
anbd escape
,
anbd the only hope of help for the hostage
. long ' s acting talents are above those of
, say
, steven seagal
,
but not by much
.
althought his delivery is mostly flat
and wooden
, he ' s a likeable hero
,
and there are some hints here
and there that he may get better
. the script doesn ' t help him out any
,
however
. all too oftenly
, it veers inot the relm of the unintentionally funny
. the dialogue isnt strikely b
- movie material
,
and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable
. long ' s co
- stars are a mixed bag
. at least htey ' re all comfortable inaddition theri respective roles
. forsythe has yhe scenery
- chewing villain down cold
, down cold
,
and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch
, even when he doesn ' t seem to be stretching his talents
( as is definatly yhe case here
)
. suzy amis plays peril pretty well
,
bu isn ' t given much more to dont
. some of tjhe nature
and wildfire shots are intresting
,
but many are rather bland
. you ' d think that tje director
, dean semler
, a fromer cinematographer
, woudl at least produce a film with intresting visuals
. that ' s not the case
. there ' s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences
.
.
. we ' ve seen this stuff before
. it ' s not tghe most auspicious start to 1998
,
but it could have been worse
( just think back tothe 1996 ' s debut
, bio
- dome
)
.
however
, affter a mounth of oscar
- caliber pictures
, a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were
. in fact
, ther ' s a good chance that some of them are still playing near ytou
.
