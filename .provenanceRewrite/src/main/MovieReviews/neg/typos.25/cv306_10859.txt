here ' s something to chew on
: what ' s the favorite food ofthe big
, cheesy
- looking special effects monsters like the one lurking infront the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising
? the obvious answer tothe this question is cardboard
, becasue taht ' s the depth of the most fully
- devolopped character in this painfully generic creature feature
. deep rising demonstrates all the originality
and vitality of something scripted by a coputer
. in fact
, considering the rigid adherence to yhe expeced formulas
, perphas it was
. thge most astonishing thing about deepo rising is tjhe exceptionally high level of gore
. not sicne starship troopers haev this many chunks of flesh
( both human
and non
- human
) beeen scattered iin all directions
. we learn some bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sea monster spraypaints inaddition red
( it drinks a human being
then spits out the liquefied remains
)
annd what it does whith half
- digested leftovers
. i suppose deep rising ' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stfuf for those who love the macabre
,
but it doesn ' t do much for me
. on the surfce
,
annd that ' s about the only levle at which this film can be analyzed
, deep rising fiels like tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens
/ titanic connection
, since james cameron directed both
)
. in goign for tyhe big disaster angle of titanic
anbd the tongue
- in
- cheek mayhem ofthe tremors
, deepo rising somehow misses both markes by a wide margin
. the film isnt not humorous
, tense
, or exicting
. iin fatc
, it ' s downright boring
,
and
, dispite bieng half thge length of cameron ' s current box
- office champ
, deep rising feels liek the longer movie
. is it really necessary tothe say anything about the plot
? probably not
, since it ' s easy tothe guess
,
but i ' ll go ahead
adn oblige anyone who whants a synopsis
. the film opens by introducing us tothe a gang of bad guys onthe board a mercernary ship
. infact addition tothe the usual cast of psychopaths
and lunatics
, ther ' s finnegan
( treat williams
)
, the boat ' s pilot
, who ' s supposed tothe be an indiana jones knockoff
; joey
( kevin j
. o ' connor
)
, the inept sidekick who ' s supposed to be lovable
and funny
(
but is really jsut irritating
)
;
annd hanover
( wes studi
)
, the
" mastermind
"
(
and i ule that term lightly
) of the operation
. their goal
: attack a cruise ship
, clean outloud the safe
,
thne sink it using some illegaly
- acquired torpedoes
. the probelm isnt
, by the time they triarch thge argonautica
, the titanic
- like luxury liner has turned inot thge marie celeste
. aside ffrom a beautifull jewel thief
( famke janssen
)
and a couple of crew members
, there ' s no oen onthe board
. the reason soon becomes obvious
-
- the ship hasnt beeen tooked over by a bad special effect that is supposed to ressemble an octopus with teeth
and more than eight tentacles
. the cast
, which is led by treat williams
, is primarily comprised ofthe has
- beens
and probably
- never
- will
- bes
( two exceptions
: wes studi
, best known as the villain infact the last of the mohicans
,
anbd djimon hounsou
, amistad ' s cinque
)
. williams
, once a
" cin ' t miss
" prospect inaddition hollywood
, hasnt falled so far out ofthe favor that the best he can dont theese days for a lead role is a film like deep rising
,
and his inability to create a carismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career
. famke janssen
, who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye
, isnt the perfect bland match forthe williams
. given her limited acting abilties
, it ' s likely that she was choosen forthe this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes
. unforetunately
, a bra defeats the purpose of hvaing her in a wet tee
- shirt for half of the picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o ' connor
, who has entirely too much screen time
, exhibits all the appeal ofthe fingernails scratching a blackboard
. these days
, audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with cmoputer
- generated special effects
. this is a lesson that writer
/ director stephen sommers
( who previously helmed the live
- action jungle book
) needs to learn
. the days of jurassic park
, when viewers weere astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big
anbd imposing on screen
, are past
. now
, movie
- goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic
-
- visuals that are so well
- incorportaed that it ' s impossible to tell where tehy end
anbd where
" reality
" begins
. in deepo rising
, the monster
, like everthing
, is artificial
anbd unconvincing
. unfortunately
, the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn ' t so much the idiotic monotony of thsi individual picture
,
but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre
(
although
, to be fair
, deep rising is a particularly bad entry
)
. even once this film has sunk out of sight
, the knowledgeable viewer knows it won ' t be the last of its kind
. liuke yhe slimy
, slithering things thast inhabitate tjhe air vents
and pipes of these movies
, more are waiting just aroud the corner in ambush
.
and thast consideration
, unlike anything onthe screen
, isnt truley horrifying
.
