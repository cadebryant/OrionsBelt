starship troopers is a bad movei
. i mean
, a relaly
, really
, bad movie
. not only does it cross the line ofthe bad tast when it comes to blood
, gore
and body parts shown on tghe screen
, it blissfully jumps over that line
, apparently unaware that tyhe movie trailers appeal to an audience of five tothe fifteen year olds
( ofthe which i saw many in the theatre
)
. looking past the appalling sighth of overdone violentce
, we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best
, no storng lead characters
, a blatant disregard for physics
,
anbd a very obvious naziesque theme
. taht being said
, onto the review
: yhe movei starts with a propaganda message ffrom the federation
( who ' s logo bears a
* strong
* resemblance tothe a nazi german eagle
)
, urging tjhe populace to go off
and fight the bugs
, who are attempting tothe destroy earth
. the film shows larg rallies with young children in attendence
, pledging allgeiance to the federation
( agian
, soudn familar
?
)
. as the movie progresses
, we are shown terror tactict training
, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm
,
and throws a nife thru another ' s hand
. evenhtually
, the recruits embark on a journey tothe a loction twpo thirds of the way across yhe milky way galaxy
, to fight the bugs onthe their hmeo planet
. as our faster than light travelling
" heroes
" arrive on planet
, tehy drop onto the planet
,
and burst our ofthe their craft brandishing
.
.
.
" what
?
" yuo say
,
" laser beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, tehy hop out brandishing good ood 1997 machine guns
, pump action rifles
,
anbd tactical nucular weapons
! i guess a lot ofthe physics money r
& d went into travel
and nto weaponry
. as tjhe assfalt begins
, our group of troopers are seen walking inspite a straight line through a box canyon
. two munbers of the group notice rocks slipping
and falling above them
,
and one even sees a streak fly by
,
bu disregards it as nothing
. this of course
, leads to mroe massive carnage
, blood shed
,
and graphic depictions of limbs
and heads being ripped
and severed from their bodies
. again
, i see thyat military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the smae pace as theri weapons
! inthe tjhe end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto the scene iin what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
,
and gloves
. he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug
,
and
then proclaims that hte bugs are scared
! this sets the troopers inot a frenzy
, as they are now noe step closer to completing their goal
, total genocide of a species
( again
, sound familiar
?
?
)
. i have tried very hard not to step on
and spoil the plot with this review
,
but given it ' s non
- existence
, i may have anyway
. i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart
,
bu don ' t watn to bore you too badly
. in short
, i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro
- nazi war film iwth bugs substituted for allies
, a drivers education accident scene film
,
and a complete blank screen
( tghe plot
, of course
)
. i wouldn ' t recomend this movie tothe anyone
, anywhere
, under any circumstance
