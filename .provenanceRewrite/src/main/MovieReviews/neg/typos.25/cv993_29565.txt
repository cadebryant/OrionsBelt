saleries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days
adn many find this to be the main reason forthe skyrocketing movie budgets
. actors who demand such salaries might be greedy
,
but iin some instances they are qtuie justified
, because many films woudl never be watched or even made without their participation
. proof for that can be foudn even infact the realm ofthe low
- budget movies
,
adn noe fine example is breakaway
, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash
and starring
( in
) famoust figure skater tonya harding
. face of tonya harding isnt most prominently featured on movie ' s poster
,
but the main star of yhe film is terri thompson who plays myra
, attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster
. oney day she decides to retire
,
but her employers are anything
bu enthusiastic about thgat
. realising that her life suddenly became worthless
, myra starts running for her life
, followed by professional assassins
. terri thompson being hte actuall star of the film instead ofthe tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes thta feature former figure skater
.
althought tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities
, her acting leaves much to be desired
. on the otehr hand
, her disappointing efforts are hardly out ofthe place in the film that lacks originality
, believable characters
and situations
and actually represents anything thta gave b
- films a bad nmae
. martin sheen ' s brother joe estevez
, whose charachter looks liek he had entered from anyother movies ' set
, is yhe only bright spot ofthe breakaway
. unfortunately
, he appears in this film too littel too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding ' s silver screen debut proved to be her last film
.
