spoiled rich kid kelley morse
( chris klein
) receives a newyorker mercedes for a graduation presen
. he
and his buddies take it for a joyride tothe a small nearby twon
, where he proceeds tothe torment the locals simply because he ' s rich
and they ' re nto
. he ends uv provoking jasper
( josh hartnett
) into a race
and as a result
, the local gas station
anbd diner are destroyed when htey kresh into it
. kelley isnt sentenced to rebuild the diner
,
and has to live with jasper in a sparce room over his familiy ' s barn
. jasper ' s girlfriend sam
( leelee sobieski
) soon takes a liking to kelley
howver
, despite the fatc that 1
) it was her family ' s diner that was destroyed
and b
) all kelley does is sit around
, sulk
,
and smart off tothe the townspeople
.
bu whn she sees him sweaty
and shirtless
, tath ' s apparantly all she needs tothe lose her feelings for jasper
( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case ofthe hat hair
)
. so sobieski soon falls in loev with kelley
, especially after the day she follows him through the woods
and hears him giving his graduation speech
( which he wass unable to deliver beacuse he caused the distruction of property
and nearly killed dozens of people
)
. inthe the speech
, kelley quotes a poem by robert frost
, which just so happens to be sam ' s favorite poem as well
. awwwww
. soon they ' re frolicking around in the fields
and for some reason waste no timne letting people in town
( especialy jasper ' s best friend
) see them together
. kelley continues tothe make an ass of himself in twon
, especialy when he shows uv at the town dance
, drunk
and steaming because sam went iwth jasper
. kelley runs off
and decides to leave town
. sam catchs up to him at the bus staion
and he asks her to come to boston wih him
. jasper shows up
and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her
,
anbd sam
, wihtout even breaking stride basicly says
" see ya
!
"
adn takes off to boston witht kelley
. here onthe earth goes in so many wrong directions ffrom the start that by the time its fairly decent endig comes around
, its completelyl worthless
. chris klein
and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers
,
and it ' s beccause ofthe their presence that i watched this film in the firt place
.
however
, nto long inot the proceedings i wanted tothe just reach inot the film
anbd strangle them both
. i shouldn ' t haev such feelings towords people i liuke
,
but thier characters are so infuriating that
.
.
. well trust me
, you ' ll feel the smae way
. even
though both of the lead male characters are usually inwhich the wrong
, kelley is hands down the more unlikable of thge two
, simply because his jerkish actions are calculated
. he intends to be a jackass each
and every time he does it
. jasper onthe the other hand
, only reacts tothe kelley ' s provocations
,
and afterwards comes across as being truly sory for his impulsive actions
.
but
, as in life
, nice guys finish last
. for the entire film we watch sam fall in love withthe the guy noone one likes while teh film ' s onyl sympathetic character gets completely crushed
.
then
, a cancer subplot comes into play
( where thigns get even more infuriating
, if you can imagine that
)
. what
, things weren ' t depressing enough for you mr
. screenwriter
? who greenlit this project
? who
" on earth
" thought this would entertain anyone
? perheaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction ofthe property
anbd nearly killed dozens of people
.
but even after he ' s destroyed theese people ' s lives he continues tothe be a snob tothe them
,
and ruins one more for ogod measure
. here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment
. it contains the film in its originnal theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
and isnt enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. extras include jessica simpson ' s music video for
" where you are
"
, a commerical forthe thte film ' s soundtrack
( whcih by tjhe way isnt the only ogod thing about hte film
)
, tghe original theatrical trailer
adn five tv spots
, trailers for other fox releases
( anna
and tghe king
, anywhere
but here
, the beach
, drive me crazy
, ever aftter
, romeo
+ juliet
, simply irresistible
)
, as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy
. the picture
and soudn qulity on teh disc are fine
.
.
. nothing that will challenge anyone ' s audio
/ video systems of course
. fans of thsi movie
( if any exist
) should enjoy the dvd release
. here on earth isnt not intertaining nor is it compelling
. no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film
. it is merely a waste of time
, money
and talent
.
