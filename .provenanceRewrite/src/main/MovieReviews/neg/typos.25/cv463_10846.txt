,
anbd his cat
. comments
: malicious
, i suppose
, is an acecptable moview for what it isnt
: a cheap
, b
- movie thriller which rips off dozens
and dozens of spurned
- psycho
- lover
- who
- wnats
- revenge films
( like fatal attraction
, hand that rocks the cradle
, etc
. etc
.
) that have come before it
. milicous
,
however
, realy doesn ' t provide vyre many particularly suspenseful moments
. the plot starts off energetically enough
, the main characters are intruduced
and the affair between doug
and melissa begins
and ends pretty eary on in the film
. it starts to drag
, unfortunately
, after tihs
. melissa will obviously try to take her revenge onthe doug
( as always seems to happen in movies liek these
)
,
but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other
, better thrillers before
. she drugs somone
. she kills a famaly pet
and leaves it in tghe girlfriend ' s apartment
.
and
, of course
, she stalks
, so we see a number of shots
, whic are supposed to be suspenseful
, where she ' s spying on doug
adn his girlfriend
. i won ' t reveal the ludicrous ending tothe this trkey
,
bu i warn you that it ' s both painfully obvious
and a real yawner
. john vernon doens a remarkably good job at playing the not
- so
- bright baseball jock who initally gets sweeped away by melissa
( noe of the script ' s faults is to try to pass off a character liuke this as a pre
- med student
)
. the same cannot be said
,
though
, for molly ringwald
. at times
, she cant effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine
, especially during her silent
, i ' m
- going
- to
- stare
- you
- down scenes
. at otehr times
,
however
, she just seems somehow goofy
and outloud ofthe place
. in one particular scene which i guess was suppoed to be suspenseful
, she screeches
" f
-
- k ytou
, you b
-
-
-
-
- d
"
and throws a phone
. she delivers hte line so ridiculously tyhat one can ' t halp
but laugh
. milicous certainly isn ' t the worst thriller of its kind outloud in the video racks
( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there
)
,
bu it isn ' t all that good or origonal either
. feel free to treat this film maliciously
, watch something esle
.
