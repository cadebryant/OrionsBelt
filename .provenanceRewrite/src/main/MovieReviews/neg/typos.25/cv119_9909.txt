apparantly money talks
.
.
.
and uses qutie a bit of obscenities doign so
! i ' ve always consdidered myself preety open baout the gratuity a film cant possess
, whether inthe language
, violence
, sex
, or what have ytou
. i find thta this fact gives me a little more leverage tothe complain when a movei goes overboard
,
anbd money talks definitely does
! it ' s not so much thta the movie sweared nearly constantly
(
anbd i mean constanly
!
)
,
but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent
and way too staged
. perhaps if oney character were foul mouthed
,
bu in this film
, everybody swears nearly every otehr word
. money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett
( played less annoyingly tahn expected by chris tucker
)
. franklin is your typical con
- man
anbd ends up with more than one person out tothe get him
. when the plot finally gets underway
, there ' s no less than three people
( or groups
) thast want him
, dead or alive
. the frenchman who ' s somewhat resposible for franklin ' s escape from a prisoner
- packed bus
, a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand
,
and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder
. franklin ' s onyl hope
: james russell
( charlie sheen
)
, an investigative repertwar forthe thte local news who ' s out to prove himself a worthy journalist
. james offers to help claer franklin ' s name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to halp channel 12 conquer sweeps week
. both of these elements are completely lost allong the way
however
,
and never dont reappear
. as expeced
, the odd couple of franklin
and james do wind up friends at the end
, hwihc is anohter wasted element seeing as how they show noone signs ofthe becoming friends at any point along hte way
. there is jstu nothing originnal or intriguing about this film
,
and so many developments are either non
- relevant
, or just plain forgotten about
. monay talks is a paint
- by
- numbers movie that lacks any rela involvment iwth tje audience
. frivilous dialogue
, a predictable
, flat storyline
,
annd two
- dimensional characters amking money talks a reason to save your money
