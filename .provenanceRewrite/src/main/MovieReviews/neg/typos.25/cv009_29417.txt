plot
: a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth
, oops
.
.
. i mean
, an evil man
. he vows revenge on that man
and is taught thge ways of the musketeer by some ood dude who used tothe be one himself
? anyway
, fourteen years go by
and
.
.
. arrgh
, well
, you know the rest
.
.
. swish
- swish
- zzzzzzz
! critique
: this is a preety bad movie
. let ' s see
, where should i start
? okay
, firt of all
, tje stry is just plain boring
. it ' s not original
, is entirely predictable
and lacks energy
. okay
, what ' s enxt
? acting
, yuo sday
. hmmmm
, well
, the main actor
, justin chambers
, is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o ' donnell
bu with less range
( think about that
!
)
,
annd mena suvari
, isnt just plain off
. nto as bad as thora birch was in dungeons
& dragons
,
bu entirely miscast
, with bad deliveries
, awful sequences
and a piss
- poore accent that comes
and goes
. nowe i ' m nto sure if this wass ms
. suvari ' s fault or the directer ' s
,
but i ' ve definitely seen her at a much higer level tahn in this film
. the only semi
- saving grace actor
- wise is tim roth as the irrepressible
" bad guy
"
,
but once agina
, it ' s not something thta we haven ' t seen before
.
.
. a thousand times
.
.
. by tghe same guy
!
! tim
, please
.
.
. for the love of god
, beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day
" american roles
" for you as a
" nice guy
" in a romantic comedy or something
. strech
, dude
.
.
. stretch
!
! we all know that you can do much better than thsi gunk
. alright
, what eles was bad in this film
? oh yeah
, tyhe score
! yikes
, how ' s about taking it down a few notches there
, fellas
? this thnig blares in your ear whenever it feels tyhe need to accentuate a certian scene
,
bu actually doesnt little more than annoy
. i thikn it ' s imporatnt for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn ' t a
" real epic
" by any stretch of the imagination
. it ' s a fluffy rehashed cake
- walk created by some
" shrewd
" studio heads who decided to take advantage ofthe the whole
" kung
- fu
" phenomenon in films
,
annd test it out onthe an old classic
. dudes
.
.
. you failed all around
!
( keep reading
) the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie
, the dialogue banal
and stilted
anbd the plot problems
.
.
. plentiful
!
( why does the guy on top of teh horse carriage just stand there when his opponent tkaes forever scampering his way bcak to thge top
? why don ' t they just cutted the mouseketeer ' s rope at the top of the tower
, instade of jumping down onthe their own chords
anbd fighting him while hanging
? why doesn ' t anybody look a day older
, wehn the sequence says
" 14 years later
"
?
( at least
.
.
. change your shirt
, man
!
) keep in mind that i have never strayed awya ffrom championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a
" fun tiome
"
,
but tihs flick jstu didn ' t cut it for me
. it ws boring for stretches
, the acting was atrocious at times
( tghe
" rumatic
" scene beetwen suvari
and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made yuo cringe
)
, ther was little reason to care fo anyone
annd sicne when were the musketeers fat
? i will give the movei this much
,
and that is that its main reason fo being
( its
" raison
- d ' etre
"
, as tghe french owudl sday
)
, its fight sequences
, do come through dispite tyhe lack ofthe their numbers in tjhe film
. i wass hoping thyat the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promotted in its trailer
,
but what you see there
, are essentially the snippets from the two major
(
and kool
) swashbuckling sequences from yhe film
. the firt comes right at the beginning of the movie
, while the other essentially finishes yhe film off
, hanging fomr thte tower
and juggling off ladders
. the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper
but unfortunately tje rest of tjhe movei isnt just regurgitated crap
.
adn cant anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her nmae placed at the top of this film ' s credits
? hullo
? the film is called the musketeer
and stars a dude name justin chambers
. deneuve is barely in htis movie
! ugh
, just another small hting that anoyed me about this trash
. now say it together
, gang
:
" all for one
,
annd noe forthe all
.
.
. we vow to stay away from it all
!
!
" thank me later
