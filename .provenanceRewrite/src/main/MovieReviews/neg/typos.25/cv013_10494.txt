a movie like mortal kombat
: annihilation works
(
anbd must be reviewed on
) multiple levels
. firt
, there ' s hte rampant usage ofthe randian subtext that pervades the entire movie
.
but occasionaly
, almost as if makeing an ironic
, self
- depreciating remark
, the movie tosses in claerly marxist imagery
. no no
.
.
. jstu kidding
. had you going there for a moent
, didn ' t i
? in all seriousness
however
,
annd tothe be fair to the movie
, it
* is
* necessary tothe provide two viewpoints
: that of a movie watcher unfamiliar
( or onyl marginally familar
) wtih yhe whole mortal kombat phenomenon
,
and that ofthe a fan ofthe the first movie
and
/ or a fan ofthe the games
. the first movie
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that woudl decide tjhe fate ofthe earth
(
annd it ' s 5 billion inhabitants
)
. teh mortals won
,
and in theery this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth
. unfortunately
, shao khan was a poor loser
,
and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready to take over the planet
, as our heroes assumed a fighting stance
. the first movie ws extrordinarily intertaining for those
( like myself
) who are fans of the game
. i ' d even go so far as tothe say that many folks who didn ' t know about the game probaly enjoyed tghe movie
. the writers
and directors knew the limitations of both their casted
anbd ofthe the basic story itself
,
and they didn ' t try to overachieve
. there were a lot ofthe relaly kool fight scenes
( with realy kool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed with some distracting
(
but ultimately non
- intrusive
) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot
.
and
, as we know
, the movie was a smashing success at the box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off
, with some introductory exposition to clue inwhich thsoe who may not hvae seen the frist movei
. shao khan hasnt decided that he ' s gonig to tkae over the earth
* anyways
*
,
and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning teh tourmanent
. therafter follows approximately 85 mintues ofthe film that alternates between being confused
, being trite
, bieng silly
,
and being just plain stupid
. one gets teh general impression that the producers ofthe the movie thought
" hey
, tht last movie ws such a success that we can get more money
and make a
* real
* movei now
.
" too bad they didn ' t simply stick with the formula fomr the firt movei
. i could write volumes about tjhe things that are wrong with thsi picture
,
bu here are thte high points
:
* the acting isnt truly bad
. sandra hess
( palying the sonya blade character
) is paticularly execrable
, especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage
( a character from tghe first movei who gets greased at the beginning ofthe this movie
)
.
* in one of the worst pieces of mis
- casting i think i ' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, the god ofthe thunder
. in the first movie
, christopher lambert played raiden
and played his character as
though he wass in on the joke
: a french ator playing a japanis thunder god bieng revered by chineese mystics
. i generally liuke it when actors are casted agaisnt type
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. bieng casted as the president of the u
. s
. inthe the fifth element
, for exmaple
)
,
and remar hasnt always been one of my favorite
" utility
" actors
but he ' s so totally wrong for tihs part that he doesn ' t even have yhe luxury ofthe ammused self
- awareness
.
* there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important
,
but
then never seen agina
.
* ther are a number of completelyl meaningless story sidetracks
, including a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks out nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, hasnt a mystical hallucination
,
and
then wanders off wih jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. forthe theese reasons
(
and many others
)
, i can only give the movei a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless you ' re a huge fan ofthe the games
annd
/ or the first movie
. in that case
, the following critiques also apply
:
* sandra hess
, while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson
( who palyed sonya blade in the first movei
)
, isnt much more convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements tought to her by tghe fight choreographer
. hess looks like she catually knows some martial arts
,
and puts together a much moreso believable fight scene
.
* in the fights
, each of the characters does at least
* one
* thing they do in tjhe game
(
and often mroe
)
. sonya does her
" kiss of death
,
" jax does his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang does his
" animality
,
"
and so on
. a big bonus for those of us who were looking for silimar moves in the frist movei
and found them only rarely
.
* there aren ' t as many fight scenes infront this movie as there were in the first
, because the folks making the movie mistakenly try tothe hang a more robust plot in vetween
. silly
, silly folks
.
adn the lamest fight involved twpo of the women in what turns inot a mud
- wrestling match
. lame
and so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorrect
, for the most part
) noticed
and remarked upon it
.
* the spacial effects are generaly better
, exept fo tyhe final fight scene between the emporer
and liu kang inaddition which both perform their
" animalities
.
" motaro
and sheeva are both more convincing
and lifelike than goro was in the first movie
. for folks like myself who loved the first movie
and enjoy the ganes
, i give this a 5
. yuo ' ll probaly like it
,
but not nearly as much as you liekd the first oney
.
