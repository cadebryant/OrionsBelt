" wholy man
" boasts a sweet
, gentle
, comic performance from an unusualy subdued eddie murphy
and a few moderately funny skits
. unfortunately
, to git to the ogod tsuff you have tothe sit through a painfully long set
- uv
, loads of tedious filler
, interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering
and twitching
, a superfluous romantic subplot
anbd quite possably the most annoying performance ofthe robert loggia ' s career
. if ever a movie screamed
" wait forthe video so you can fast
- foward through all the dull
and annoying parts
,
" this is it
. eddie murphy plays g
, a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering tyhe land enjoying the moment
anbd spreading his spiritual message
. a chance meeting wtih ricky hayman
( goldblum
)
, a stressed
- out xecutive of a home
- shopping channel
,
and kate newell
( kelly preston
)
, a no
- nonsense media analyst
, results in fysical injury to g
. quicker thna you can say
" tjhe odd couple
,
" g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky
. after soem script gymnastics
, g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network
, wreaking havoc on yhe cheesy product demonstrations
, enraging network owner mr
. mcbainbridge
( loggia
)
,
adn becoming a national media sensation
.
" holy man
" attemts to be several things at once
. it tries to satirize home shopping networks
,
but it ' s difficult to effectively make fun of something thgat is aready a self
- parody
. tghe film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attemp to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts
,
but taht ' s common knowledge already
.
" holy man
" also tries to present a story ofthe redemption
, as ricky hayman trys to decide whether to exploit g ' s good iwll to achieve financial security or do thte right thing at the expense of his career
. anyone want tothe place a wager on his final decision
? the noe genuin asset in
" wholy man
" isnt eddie murphy
, who gives a charming performance
, sharing love
, good wiull
and relevant advice tothe all thsoe around him
, hwile beaming his millon doller smile at just the right moments
. murphy is delightful
and teh film tkaes off whenever he ' s onscreen
. unfortunatley
, he ' s not onscreen enough
. jeff goldblum gets the lion ' s share of screen tiome
and his tired storyline weighs tghe proceedings down
. as his potential lvoe interest
, kelly preston tries tothe brighten thigsn up
,
but she transforms from an all
- business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly
and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance
. the otehr prinicipal actor
, robert loggia
, wastes his talents in a one
- note turn as a ruthless
, screaming monster
. structurally unsound
and way too long
,
" holy man
" is appealing whn murphy is onscreen
and dull when he isn ' t
. instead ofthe droping your monay at the theater forthe this trifle
, wait until it hits video
and fast
- forward past everything except tghe murphy scenes
. g suggests thgat we focus on enjoying hte moment
adn that ' s the best way tothe do so
.
