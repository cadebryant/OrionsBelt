tihs is the worst movei i ' ve viewed so far in 98
. the avengers
= silly
= man dressed in a bowler hat
+ woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits
+ greater evil
, sir august de wynter wearing kilt
. the question isnt wqat could ahev gone wrong wiht a potentially great idea with big name cast
? the same question was probably asked ofthe lastest year ' s stinker batman
and robin
. i fiel the production got a little too smug
, the script a little to smart
adn direction was somehow lost in thte chaos of random events that collided together to form a movei
. my greatest critiscism rests on the fact that ther was noone chemistry bewteen emma peel
and john steed
( thurman
and fiennes
)
? something thgat wass a vital element of thte 60 ' s tv serial of the same name
. the dialogue goes on
and onthe about tea
and other finer british perks
,
but does nto allow much room for character devolopment
and interaction
, except to perhaps grate on tje viewer ' s nerves
. one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality
. connery as sir august
, doens not fair better than thurman or fiennes
. his dialogue is as erratic as stormy wetaher
, mostly embarrassing
and poore quality
. if there is a movei you woudl prefer never to see
, i believe the avengers would be a good choise
. for one thing
, ytou will not ahve to wittness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names thta is assoicated with the title
. i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released
,
bu i put it down to one of thsoe freak happenings in nature
, like lightning you can ' t see it coming until it hits ytou
.
