well lets see
.
.
. i ' m not quite sure how to review this film
, based on its laughter factor
. well yeah i can
, it ' s not funny
. ok so i laughed one tyme which warranted the 1
/ 2 star
,
but other than that i sat infront my seat wondering when this pos would be over
,
( whic at a running time of 107 mintues seemed like forever
!
)
. inaddition fatc
, htis could be the un
- funniest movie i ' ve seen in a long time
, if not the un
- funniest
. let me be thte first to say
" ready to rumble
" is a huge disappointment
. long time wrestling lovers
( david
and scott
) dream of making it to the wcw
,
and watching jimmy king wrestle
. thast is their hero of course
, whom isnt kicked out of the wcw
. well here is where thge plot thickens
( lol
)
: thte two wish to rescure the king
,
adn put him back into the wcw
bu nto thyat easily
, because they are being tampered whith by many people who are out to get them
, hwile david ' s father wants him tothe become a police officer
,
and scott is a loser who hasnt to with the help of david clean outloud johnny on tyhe spots
. what a plot eh
?
" ready to rumble
" is oen of those films that tries to be funny
,
but sadly fails miserably
, everyting iin the film is imcomprehinsable
,
and even the trailer wasn ' t funny
. the actors are dull
, the script awful
,
anbd the plot which there isn ' t much of
.
.
.
. really annoying
. i ' m not quite sure how great actors like theese
,
adn vrey funny actors too
, are given such a lame script
,
and directed in such a childish manner
, that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna amke good films theese dyas
. this review isn ' t going tothe be very long because of the fact that there isn ' t much going for thte film
, if anything at all
. only one big laff is inwhich the film
, wich isn ' t all tath hilarious
. i sat in my chair wondering with this 107
(
!
!
!
!
!
) minute
" comedy
" ws going to be over
,
annd sadly it went on forever
. i ' m not sure if anything could have saved this film ffrom being such a total waste
,
but believe me you
, it is
