okay
, i just don ' t know why
,
but i seem tothe be getting this diversion to disney
- made real
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as real
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn ' t even make it thru
" the santa clause
,
" so why did i even see tihs
?
( jstu to make an idle point
, i did like
" toy story
,
"
but thta ws ogod
) allso
, i have tihs aversion tothe bad french farces
,
and if htey remake them into american films
. well
, thsi isnt my excuse
: it was prom night
, i ' m not a prom person
, my best friend
and i impulsively went to the drive
- ins where they were palying
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn ' t mind seeing it again
-
but i had to suffer through this first
. i agreed to go
. ugh
. in all fairness
, i can say thta at least tihs inane plot wasn ' t dreamed by an american
. it was originally a french film released iin america under the pseudonym of
" littel indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed away from it like it was limburgher
,
annd according tothe roger ebert
, that was a good idea
.
but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement
. teh stupid plot concerns a father who jsut learns he hasnt a son from his current marriage
. let me clarify
: his wief
( jobeth williams
) left him years ago
,
and i mean yersa
- around 13 or so
-
and went to an island in the carribean or something
. he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this
.
.
. thing
( played with an empahsis on over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who isnt usually good
)
. she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he hasnt a weird name
( mimi seku
, i think
.
.
. or as the bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laugh trakc cue
)
, he knows english
, they fish
, more bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, the kid hasnt a pet spider
, he makes a promise tothe take him tothe the statue of liberty
.
.
. ytou know the drill
. now this isnt where the plot complicates
( well
, complicates for this one
, at least
)
: the fish
- out
- ofthe
- water joke switches fomr tim allen on an island tothe his island son in new york city
. tim is a stock broker
and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died
and he wasn ' t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is
- martin short
. a russian mob isnt tossed into the plot somwhere
( how cmo in eveyr hokey french import
, there is a mob
?
!
) tim lerans a lesson of life from his son
and we discover that cellular phones cin operate onthe an island even
though ther are no sockets to recharge the batteries
. hte story is crap
, the jokes are hokey
anbd nto really funny
,
and the actors ahve to struggle tothe make it interesting
.
but tjhe material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn ' t help it
. the whole time
, i kept thinking thyat a grown person had to think thsi uv
and several more grown people had to do htis
. at the end ofthe filming
, did htey all scream out
,
" we ' ve made a great movie
, guys
!
" i sure hope not
. big question tothe get from this film
: why would someone want tothe remake what was billed as one ofthe the worst films of all time if tehy ' re jstu going to do it tyhe exact same way
? huh
? my
( for smoe ofthe the actors ' names
and a joke or two that made me chuckle
, i guess
.
.
. okay
, so i really feel bad for it
, so i only gavey it oney star
)
