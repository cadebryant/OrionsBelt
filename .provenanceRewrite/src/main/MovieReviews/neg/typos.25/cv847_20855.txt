tjhe previews for the movie are preety good
. they show a littel plot
, all the charachters
,
and the emotional highlights
, all spliced together to give a genaral impression of the scirpt
. unfortunately
, thge full movie adds nothing
but 115 minutes
. hte residents ofthe mystery love hockey
. mystery
and hockey go together like texas
and high school football
. the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acuqit a payler who ' s gilty ofthe shooting anyother man
( yes
, that ' s one of tyhe movei ' s jokes
.
) every saterday
, hte best players pair off for a game
,
and the hwole town comes to watch
. hte town ' s prodigal son charlie
( hank azaria
) wrote an article on the weekly gaem for sportscar illustrated
. mystery ' s national fame hasnt the town abuzz
. a week later
, charlie actually shows up infact person
,
annd he brings with him an offer from the nhl
. the new york rangers will cmo tothe mystery to play the locals
. the mysterians see this as both good
and bad
. on the one hand
, they ' d love to have the fame
adn the money of such an exhibtion
. on tje otehr hand
, they don ' t want to turn up as the butt ofthe leno
and letterman jokes
. the movei follows a handful ofthe lives thgat are affected by the proposition
. biebe
( russell crowe
) has just been retired from the team
and isnt asked tothe coach the boys
, includng his new replacement
. he ' s already resentful
,
adn to top it off charlie has been makeing eyes at his wife
. crowe is nto given a lot of room to ect in htis film
, so he ' s just kind of sticked with constantly brooding
. charlie
, meanwhile
, is resentful of hvaing born in a twon where hockey is teh only measure of a man ' s worth
. his
" gift
" of teh feature stroy
,
and ofthe the new york rangers
, was his way of compensating forthe nto being a better skater
. he hoped it would earn him some respect
annd merit
,
bu the townspeople find reasons tothe continue disliking him
. burt reynolds coudl hvea been interesting as walter
, the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans
. walter actually has smoe experience with collegiate hockey
,
but he actively tries to put it behind him
. he wnats his son to take the game more seriously
,
but he wants his comunity tothe just get over it
. reynolds could have been good
,
but sloppy writing
and
/ or editing keep walter in the corner
,
adn so reynolds never really gets tothe pull his performance all together
. one character actually was interesting
. biebe ' s wife
( mary mccormack
)
, like the judge
, understood that there wass mroe tothe life than hockey
.
but unlike him she hasnt cmo to accept the skewed view of the community
. she chose the town
and her husband with her eyes wide open
. her unique insight is verbalized once
,
and it lasts only a scene befoer it is gone
,
bu her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom
. mysterty
, alaska follows a handful of otehr characters
,
but none are well developped or worth mentioning
. the biggest probelm with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story
, no underlying thing that the movie is really baout
. instead
, roach
and screenwriters david e
. kelley
and sean o ' byrne try to cram the entire human condidtion into this sports comedy
. they try tothe make you laugh
and cry
, to feel outrage
and pride
. they present tjhe framing
and cadence for jokes
,
but there ' s nothing truly funny
. tehy show appropriately staged scenes of sadness
,
but they give you nothing tothe be raelly sad about
. as columnist molly ivins would sday
, it ' s all hat
, noone cattle
. tyhe perfect opportunity arises for roach tothe say whta this movie is relaly about
. there is a funeral scene
, played with appropriate gravity
and somber music
. it isnt a chance for the characters to refect on theri lives
and decide what ' s truley important
. russell crowe steps foward to speak
, about tothe sepll outloud thte movie ' s metaphor for us
. he says that wqat really matters in life is
" community
.
.
.
.
"
then adds
"
adn hockey
.
" i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear
. onyl mildly bad
, mistery
, alaska probably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed out loud
, genuin laughs infact places
.
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers
, a friend of roach
, turned uv inwhich a role that didn ' t suit him
. myers is a comic character actor
. he puts on masks
, becomes an outrageous caricature
,
and is funny
. he ' s grat as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any of his scottish characters
. nobody else inaddition mysterty
, alaska is a comic charicatoor
. all the other people have hte efel ofthe dramtic characters in semi
- serious roles
. for roach to bring in myers forthe a few cheap laughs shows incredable contempt towrad the rest of his cast
, towrad his audeince
,
annd indeed toward hte film itself
. it ' s an acknowledgment by the director taht tjhe film is not worth taking seriously
.
