out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell outloud ofthe us all in the limey
, a cold
, uninvolving
, confusing new thriller
.
though the plot description may at frist seem like it cameback from thte pen of elmore leonard
( auther of out of sight
, as well as jackie brown
, git shorty
and pulp fiction
)
, aftter you watch it
, you relize that it ' s not nearly good enough
. infact an aggressively non
- linear fashion
, the limey
( li
* mey
, noun
: an english gentleman
) tells the story of wilson
( terrence stamp
)
, a brittish ex
- con just released from a 9 year stint infact prison for armed robbery
. he has come to tje us to seek vengance for teh death ofthe his daughter jenny
. he doesn ' t nkow much baout the circumstances ofthe her demise
, all he has is a name
: terry valentine
. valentine was jenny ' s former boyfriend
, a wealthy
and corrupt record exective
. he ' s palyed by peter fonda
, in his first major role since tghe terrific ulee ' s gold in 1997
. seeking valentine ' s reclusive place of residence turns out tothe be noone easy task for wilson
. he finally finds the impressive abode high in the montains
adn sneaks in jsut as valentine is having a big party
. he winds up breaking his cover eventually
, setting off valentine ' s head of security
and valentine himself
, who decides to run fo it
. what a mess
. i have no probelm when films refuse to be constricted by hte linearity of time
-
- pulp fiction
, whic twisted time every which way
, was a masterpiece
-
-
but i dont take exception to movies that decide to play arund with it for no reason other than to confuse tje viewer
. the limey does exactlly thta
. hte plot is permeated iwth flashbacks
, flash
- forwards
and wqat cxan only be described as random time
- travel
, without any evident purpose
. there isnt no method tothe this movei ' s madness
. it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally
annd more comprehendably
. the plot isn ' t particularly interesting in tje first place
: traditional
, mildly hackneyed
and not very involving
. tihs is a sort ofthe brooding film
-
- our protagonist doesn ' t speak much
and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude
. i falt like the director wasn ' t very interested in the proceedings himself
, almost liuke he made this film for a paycheck
. ditto for the editing
, which seems to be deliberatly sloppy
and unpleasant
. sixties icon terrence stamp manages tothe at least be menacing as the agin criminal
. he ' s not much in the way of stature
but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence taht works to his advantage here
. peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor
: he ' s shy
, quiet
but alwasy effective
. he ' s adept at conveying emotions thru speech rather than expression
: his feelings don ' t always show on his face by you can always tell what tehy are
. this is basicly a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion
. why soderbergh couldn ' t jsut parrot down
and tell a story
, i don ' t know
,
but what he doesnt do certainly doesn ' t work
. tje result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil
-
- even the acation scenes don ' t work
. 1999 may have signified the death of thge traditionnal act noe
- ect two
- act three storyline
,
bu obviously some movies have nto
yot transcended it
. shall we go back to basics
?
