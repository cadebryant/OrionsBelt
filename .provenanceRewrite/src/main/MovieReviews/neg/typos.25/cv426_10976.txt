" deep rising
" gives you tath sinking feeling both literally
and figuratively
: not only does the movie tkae place onthe a cruise ship slowly being immersed inot the middle of the ocean by a squid
- like menace
,
but the unfolding story is artificial
, silly
and almost completely derivative of countless other
(
and
, fo the most part
, better
) films
. while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures
-
- take
, for exmaple
, the schlocky mountain highs of last spring ' s
" anaconda
"
-
-
" deep rising
" hasnt no tongue to put inaddition its cheek
. folks
, we ' re only a month into the new year
,
and already here ' s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releses
. most ofthe tghe action takes place on the argonautica
, a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage
( uh
- oh
-
- if theese people had seen
" titanic
,
"
then maybe htey ' d hve known tothe stay hmeo
) when it ' s attacked by a giant
, tentacled sea creature
. the only survivers are slinky jewel theef trilian
( famke janssen
)
, argonautica owner canton
( anthony heald
)
and a fewd other crew members
. a mercenary team
, lead by resourceful captian john finnegan
( treat williams
)
, board the argonautica looking for assistance after their pwn boat breaks down nearby
.
but what their sarch ofthe thte ship uncovers is something blood
- soaked
, hungry
adn not very helpfull
. the main problem wih
" deep rising
" is its overt familiarity
; the movie makes absolutely no attempt tothe differentiate itself from most sci
- fi
/ horror films in recent memory
. the consept is
" leviathan
" meets
" titanic
,
" with a dash of
" speed 2
" thrown infact for good
( or is that bad
?
) measure
. this monster is equal parts
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
and
" the relic
,
" knows how to open doors like the raptors from
" jurassic park
"
and even gets to expel a half
- digested victum
( a neat effect
, admittedly
) a la the giant snake in
" anaconda
.
" soem of tghe attack sequences are straight out of
" jaws
"
adn
" alien
.
" a scene where teh remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right outloud of
" alien resurrection
.
" htere ' s even a jet ski chase liek
" hard rain
.
"
and tghe list goes onthe
. watching
" deep rising
" ' s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself
, because none of them have well
- developed characters
, nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear wehn facing their enemy
. williams is affable enough
,
bu his finnegan just isn ' t believeable
. an intresting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted
; preety famke janssen
, best known as
" goldeneye
" ' s killer thighs
, is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams
, hwile kevin j
. o ' connor
, as finnegan ' s mechanic
, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick tht gets ood fast
. djimon honsou
, who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december ' s
" amistad
,
" pops up in a brief part
. he needs to stay awya from the water
. the movie ' s fianl shot isnt a groaner
, as is the 11th
- hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on
- ship saboteur
. as if a cast deserving of thier snack food
- fate isn ' t bad enough
( whn you taunt the monster
, you ' re really asking for it
)
,
" deep rising
" is a slow
, stupid slog thru a story without a single bright spot
.
and since we all know that the higer the casualty rate is
, the closer we are to the end of the movie
, rooting for this overgrown squid tothe swallow the whole ship isn ' t out ofthe tjhe question
.
