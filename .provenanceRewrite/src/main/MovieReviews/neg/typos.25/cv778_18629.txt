david spade has a snide
, sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me
. it allso served as a good showcase for him when he co
- starred
, oposite the late chris farley
, inspite tommy boy
and black sheeps
. lost
annd found marks the comedian ' s first attempt at oging solo in a movie
,
and it also reveals tht when spade doesn ' t haev a reliable bcak
- up system
, his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect
. david spade is not hte problem with lost
and foudn
. he plays dylan ramsey
, the sweet main charachter
, to the best of his abilities
. the story revolves around dylan ' s obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour
, lila dubois
( sophie marceau
, from braveheart
)
,
and her terrier named jack
. dylan believes tyhat the best way to a woman ' s heart is through her dog
.
and so he kidnaps jack
, planning to stage a fake rescue
, in hope tothe win lila over
. htere are three good things about lost
adn found
. tghe firt is spade
. the second isnt sophie marceau
, a lovely actress who ' s been planted into the wrong movie
. lastly
, ther ' s tje dog
, who is unsed here in a similar context tothe puffy from there ' s something about mary
. unfortunately
, director jeff pollack finds mroe humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does iwth simply making him look cute
. this kind of physical humor isnt dead
. pollack does everyting
bu beated the poore pooch with a baseball bat tothe get laughs
,
anbd this proceedure is cheap
, unfunny
and resoundingly cruel
. this isnt where i start to get fuzzy
. also in this unusual blend is
( apparently
) a sweet
- natured love story between dylan
and lila
. given the mean
- spirited comedy tyhat the movei is obviously striving for
, i found this hard to swallow
.
and
, why does dylan even deserve somene liuke lila
, after kidnapping her precious dog
and putting it through such pain
? predictably
, lost
and foudn opts forthe a happy ending
, one that feels so sentimental
, gooey
,
and rings so false that it sets off a siren iin your head that makes you fiel a bit cheated
. david spade
( who also co
- wroet the movie
) tries hard
, so vyer hard
, to make this project amusing
. ther are some choice scenes that are quite funny
,
but the movie is onyl sporadically funny
. patrick bruel plays the stock charater of rene
, teh pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over
, with his good looks
annd money
. jon lovitz
and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles
. dispite a few positive attributes
, lost
and foudn just doesn ' t work
. if you ' re searching for an enjoyable rumatic
- comedy
, you could do far better than tihs obvious
, misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it ' s trying tothe pesent
.
