well
, as i check my score card for what i ' ve done this hoiday weekend
, it reads ogod ideas
: 0
adn dumb ideas
: 1
. i don ' t know whta i was thikning when i desided tothe watch this movie
.
but in my defense
, i can only say that it was somene else who urged me tothe see tihs iwth him
. the film that i ' m talking baout is
` a nihgt at the roxbury
, ' one of those offerings based onthe a saturday niht live skit
. wayne
and garth
, these two are not
. rether
, we meet doug
and steve butabi
( the actors ' names are nto worth mentioning
)
, two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city
, thge roxbury
. driving in their dad ' s bmw
and donning metalic disco suits right out of miami vice
, they try to bribe thge bouncer to get into the club
.
` have you met my freind washington
and his friend roosevelt
, ' they confidently say as they pull outloud sparce pocket change
. their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick
- up lines as is humanly possible inwhich order tothe start a conversation with a girl
(
` let me see that label
. just as i thought
- made in heaven
, ' says one of the brothers
)
.
and
, like tyhe losers that they are
, tehy fail to do either for much of the film
.
however
, as fate would have it
, an accidental meeting with
` what
- ever
- happened
- to ' richard grieco gives them the all
- important ticket to git iin
. theri sad lives take onthe a hwole new direction
. they make an important contact with the club owner who believes thgat these two brothers have uncanny insight inot the club scene
.
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women
.
bu their newfound popularity does not impress their father
, who has otehr plans for them
. the unfortunate thing baout this film is that htis is a one
- joke movie
,
and the brothers are the joke
. actually
, there ' s about 10 mintues worth of tolerable tsuff
. alas
, too long fo tv
and way too short for a feature
- length film
. thus
, there jsut isn ' t enough material to sustain tjhe 83
- minute movie
. htere ' s no plot to be foudn
adn everything that these two do seem to culminate infact an opportunity to excecute their trademark move of snapping their heads infront unison tothe the funky beat ofthe haddaway ' s europop song
, waht is love
. i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash
. to take up more film time
, there is a subplot involving the daugher ofthe the businessman next door who wants to marry doug
. this creates not only friction between the brothers
,
bu their unlikey pairing will also agitate audience munbers as well
. she ' s educated
and a forebearing witch
. meanwhile
, doug isnt a complete loser
. how doed theese two ever get together
? i suppose that if i can ever figure out tyhe answer tothe that question
, i ' ll have figured out why i decided to go
and see this movie
. if you ' re looking for entertainment
, you won ' t find it at the roxbury
.
