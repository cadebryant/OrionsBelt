retrospective
: city of the living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror directer lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
.
and by golly
, just about all otehr words fail me when confronted withthe a dog like city of the living dead
.
although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers inwhich his career
, this is not one of them
. twpo points inwhich the movie ' s favour
- the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati
and occasinoally evocative score by fabio frizzi
- keep thnigs from falling totally into the abyss
,
bu by
and large city of the living dead is a failure
.
and like most cinematic failures
, it comes down to bad writing
, dumb performances
and lousy direction
. the storey starts in new york when
, during a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision of a priest hanging hismelf in the town of dunwich
, massachusetts
. for reasons we won ' t go into here
, this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise
adn walk the earth
. the medium apparently dies of fright during thge seance
,
but awakens in her coffin infact the graveyard the next day
and is rescued by a crusty old journalist
( christopher george
)
. that scene in itself is a howler
: why would you bust open a coffin with a larg pick axe when yuo know somene isnt alive inside
?
and don ' t cadavers hve various things stuffed in them
annd drained out of them before tehy ' re buried
? anyway
, off the two ofthe them go to dunwich to save the world
, where vairous grisly goings
- on are already hapening as all saints day approaches
. fulci ' s graphic gore is in evidence once again
,
but here it onyl serves to furhter highlight the film ' s flimsy script
and plodding direction
. the dialogue
, in all manner ofthe speaking
, isnt unspeakable
. not bad infront the quotable sense
, like an ed wood film
,
but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets explain the plot
" type aproach
. mccoll doesn ' t have a clue who her character is
: deadly serious oen minute
, frivolous the next
, she at times is genuinely hard to watch
.
annd the geezer
( the actor ' s name escapes me
) who plays hte twon psychiatrist becomes even harder tothe stomach than mccoll as the film progresses
. christopher george ' s performance is salvageable
,
but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie
and we don ' t care
. in fatc we don ' t care for anyone in city of yhe living dead
,
though in other fulci films thgat hasn ' t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist
annd an ideas man
, as he ws infact tyhe beyond
. as a directer
, some of fulci ' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly
and annoying here
. he constantly uses extreme close
- ups of peopel ' s eyes
, a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue
and actors aren ' t capable ofthe
.
and despite soem gruesome violence
, he barely manages a single scare in the entire film
. long
- timne collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented
but always erratic
, offers a patchy soundtrack that veers beween eerie
, gothic death marchs
and woefully inappropriate electro
- pop that ' s quite frankly embarrassing
. fulci ' s other films of this period may be flawed
- house by the cemetary
, the beyond
, the balck cat
-
but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration
, athmosphere
and better dialogue than this tukey
. for completists only
.
