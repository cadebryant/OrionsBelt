well
, here ' s a distasteful
, thouroughly amateurish item that
, suprisingly
, ws actually a box
- office hit at the time ofthe its realease
. after just viewing the film for the first time
, my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy thsi movie
? it is cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
,
and nto nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was
. at least some smut owudl hve livened things up a bit
.
" porky ' s
,
" tells the story
( if you can call it that
) of four clueless high skool buddies
, pee wee
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
,
adn mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desperately want to git laid
. women
, for tjhe most part
, are a mistery to them
(
and in this movei
, they are tothe tyhe audience
, as well
, since all of them are writen
and acted as if they are aliens ffrom a different planet
)
. theri plan is sidetracked
,
however
, when they venture out tothe a smarmy strip bar named porky ' s
, which they are able tothe get into using fake id ' s
. after they pay the manager one
- hundred bucks for three hookers
, tehy are played a trick on
and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building
. forthe theese four teenage guys
, this means war on porky ' s
.
" porky ' s
,
" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it isnt not wild or amusing anough
. as a comedy
, all of the jokes are predicatble
adn fall flat
. as a look back at the 1950 ' s
, it is something
, i suspect
, most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave
.
and as a revenge movie
, it is a crushing bore
. one ofthe tghe most offensive thnigs about
,
" porky ' s
,
" is how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers
. teh four main characters are not even attempted to be developped as characters
,
and we learn very little about them
, except that tehy are horny
and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool
. that sure is revealing information
. tjhe female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay
adn direction by bob clark
. the women are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rather than rela peple
. for example
, thge twpo gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
)
and honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, only have noe purpose
,
and thyat is to be made fun of
. mrs
. balbricker is a gruff
, no
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness
,
and
, in one partiularly embarrassing scene for all involved
, honeywell has sex wiht a coach
and barks liuke a dog
. htere is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i have tjhe suspicion htey are nto
)
,
but oen hting is forthe sure
: they are asked to dont thigsn in this film thast are not at all funny
, only humiliating
. to prove how out
- of
- touch this so
- called comedy is
, compare it to other more serious 80 ' s films about teenagers
,
and it looks even worse inwhich comaprison
. any of the john hughes picturesk
, such as 1984 ' s
" sixteen candles
,
" or
, 1985 ' s
" the breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky ' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. thsoe films atcually dealt wih serious teen matters
,
bu remained a great deal funnier
, thanks to their bright
and truthful writing
.
and heck
, if
,
" porky ' s
,
" wnated to be a teenage sex movie
, i ' d take 1982 ' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982 ' s
" the last american virgin
,
" over this any day of the week
. director bob clark isnt not a bad director
. two years after he made
,
" porky ' s
,
" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic
,
" a christmas story
.
" i would forgive him for this misfire
, in fatc
, if it wasn ' t for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay
. just the thought that someone woudl actually sit down tothe write such a piece of garbage
,
and thiunk that it was actually a film worth releasing unto thte unsuspecting world
, is actually a whole lot funnier than anything iin
,
" porky ' s
