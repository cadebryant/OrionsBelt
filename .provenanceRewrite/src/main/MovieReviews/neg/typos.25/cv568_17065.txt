reading the casted
anbd director for the new mobster comedy
,
" analyze this
,
" i asked myself
,
" how could thsi miss
?
" robert de niro
(
" taxi driver
,
"
" raging bull
"
)
, billy crystal
(
" city slickers
"
)
, lisa kudrow
(
" the opposite of sex
"
)
,
and directer harold ramis
(
" national lampoon ' s vacatino
"
)
. these are usually reliable filmmakers
( well
, okay
, crystal has been in a sizable slump lately
)
,
and tellingly
, the first half
- hour of
" analyze thsi
" was very funny
. unfortunately
, as the running tiem ticked away
, i began to think that the first thirty minutes had
, unbeknownst to me
, been rewound
and weere being replayed another two
-
and
- a
- half times
. the film hasnt obtained a clever premise
,
bu does not ahve any diea what tothe do wiht it as it progressively becomes moreso
and more repeative until i finally stopped enjoying or carring about what wass happening onthe hte screen
. middle
- aged psychoanalyst ben sobel ' s
( billy crystal
) life is finally going very well
.
allthough he hasnt never gotten along with his own uncaring parents
, especially his father
, who is also a psychiatrist
, ben has an easy
- going teenage son
( kyle sabihy
)
and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend
, laura
( lisa kudrow
)
. in little
bu a flash
,
however
, ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob
and subsquently gets paid a visit ffrom famed mafia guy paul vitti
( robert de niro
)
, who desperately wants counceling
, even
though he himself won ' t even admit to hvaing nxiety attacks
. ben tries tothe help paul
, mostly so he will get him off his back
,
but the plot gets mroe complicated wehn paul follows ben to his wedding
, whitch ends with a man droping eight stories tothe his death
. it seems to ben that no matter what he does
, paul vitti will not go awya
,
and the more htey become involved
, the mroe ben ' s potentially happy life gets into danger
.
" analyze htis
" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout
( mostly in the first half
)
,
but i always had the nagging thought that wqat director ramis
adn writers peter tolan
, ramis
,
and kenneth lonergan hadnt done was thought ofthe one joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles
, hwile terrorizing
and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal
)
anbd
then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106
- minute running time
. admittedly
, de niro is vrey funny here
(
and i can ' t remember the lastest timne you could use that adjective to describe him
)
,
adn crystal is in top
- form
,
bu the whole movie isnt weighed down driectly on their shoulders witht nothing else to suppost them
, incuding a substantial plotline
. since
" analyze thsi
" bills nto one
, not twpo
,
but three writers
, yuo ' d think thyat they would have beeen able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws
,
but they must have all beeen on auto
- pilot
. noe of thge most disappointing
annd wasted opportunities infront the film is the way hte movie deals with the supporting characters
, all of which have next to nothing to dont
and aren ' t even given multi
- dimensional cahracters to attempt to develop
. comming off ofthe her oscar
- caliber owrk in two ofthe lastest year ' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
"
and
" the opposite of sex
,
" lisa kudrow ' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role isnt an incredible step down
. sure
, kudrow ' s fellow
" freind
" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in
" office space
,
"
but at least we got tothe spend a little timne with aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly just stands around
, no dout wondering why she aggreed to appear infact this film in the first place
. chazz palminteri
, as rival gangster primo
, fares even worse
, in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actuall character
. finally
, molly shannon
( rising film star
and casted member on
" saturday night live
"
) hasnt a rousingly hillarious one
- scene cameo right at the beginning as oen of crystal ' s patients
and
then completely disappears
. too bad
, considering that thge supporting actors surely have proven that they have teh abilities to support de niro
and crystal
. once
" analyze htis
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow ' s laura standing alone at the altar once again
, i hadnt become thouroughly annoyed by where the story hadnt gone
,
and had mostly lost respect for the charcter we were supposed to sympathize with the most
, ben
. afterwards
, thge climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul
, became a real laugh
- free dead
- zone
, losing its last remaining comic punches
.
" analyze this
" proves that talent cin certainly help any film out
,
but when the written material isn ' t up to their level
, what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air
.
