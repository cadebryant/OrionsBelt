dr dolittle
( 20th century fox
) runnung tiome
: 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on tjhe success of tje nutty professor
( 1996
)
, murphy returns in this abysmal comedy
. he plays doctor john dolittle
, who as a child had the abillity to understand animals
.
however
, after being ' exorcised ' he loses this abillity
,
and we fast foward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people
( most noteably dr mark weller
, played by oliver platt
.
)
however
, iwth a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns
,
and ' comedy ' is ready
and waiting tothe happen
. except comedy never does happen
. doctor dolittle
, even with tghe excellant premise
, rarely manages to raise a laugh
. poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughtout the whole movie
,
and his performance suffers
. the manic murphy we saw in the 80 ' s is gone
, his more mature
(
and more boring
) twin appears tothe be getting all the work in tjhe 90 ' s
. hte voices of teh animals
, hwihc include albert brooks
, chris rock
( the ' newyorker ' eddie murphy
)
and norm mcdonald as ' lucky ' the dog are marginally better
,
and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie
. sadly
, most ofthe their lines are pretty dumb
.
adn they ' re nto ' funny ' dumb
, liek dumb
& dumber
( 1994
)
,
but just boring dumb
. the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through
, in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs
. there are a few good jokes in the scirpt
,
but tehy are few
and far between
. if i hadnt to choose a favourite performance
, it would probably be albert brooks tiger
, who has a certian charm baout him
. sadly
, he ' s barely in the movie
,
and rock ' s really annoying hamster isnt given far too much screen time
. joke wise
, we are thankfully
, spred tyhe mocking
and insulting tipe of jokes that featured heavily in thte nutty professor
. the director
, betty thomas
, has
, well
, done better films
. she buyed us private parts
( 1997
)
and the brady bunch movei
( 1995
) wich were
, sadly
, much better tahn this
. the scenes lack any charm
, she just gets the job done
. tjhe animals themselves
, are reasonable realsitic
,
altough most of them are obviously puppets
. htere ' s an impressive looking tiger
,
however
,
adn the lip sync is preety ogod
. you ' d have noone problem guessing tht most of the close uv ' s are puppets
,
however
, with their jilted movement
. i wass hoping jim hensons workshop
, who created the furry friends
, would hvea done a better job
. doctor dolittle
, in the end
, is a disappointment for everyone involved
. murphy has done much better movies
( i
. e trading places
) thte director has seen better days
,
and even the creatures aren ' t that good
. teh target audience
, aged between 7
- 13
, who are undemanding
, will probably like it
however
, thanks to it ' s dumbed down humour
. everyone eles
,
however
, should give doctor dolittle a miss
.
