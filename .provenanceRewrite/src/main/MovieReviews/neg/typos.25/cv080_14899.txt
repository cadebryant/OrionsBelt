before the remake of psycho appears
, we ' ve got to suffer thru this remake of an earlier hitchcock film
, dial m for murder
. as usual
, hollywood has filled it withthe glitz
and big nmae stars
,
and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing
. the film opens with emily
( paltrow
)
adn david
( viggo mortensen
) ' having fun ' in an loft apartment
. the problem is
, paltrow is marryied to stephen
( douglas
)
, who is not too happy when he discovers this afair
. if i was paltrow
,
though
, i ' d definatly go with mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approaches david witht an interesting proposition
: he ' ll pay him to kill his lovely wife
. mortensen agrees
,
but the murder goes awry
,
and thge twists keep on coming as the film progresses
. unfortunately
, the film dosen ' t progress very fast
. in fact
, it moves like a tortise with arthritis
( read
: very
, very s
- l
- o
- w
.
) hte plot moves nowhere fast
,
and only becomes exciting in very short bursts
. nto too good for a ' thriller
. ' also
, the performances
, apart from douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing emmense talent in se7en
( 1995
)
and sliding doors
( 1997
) is strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, in this movei
. mortensen is a little bited better
, coming across as a younger douglas
,
but his role isn ' t meaty enough to show all his talent
. hwihc leaves douglas to waltz awya with the film
, which is does
.
howver
, i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer with a creepy underside
. also popping uv in tje film is david suchet
, playing a shifty looking detective
. again
, it ' s not a character we ' re seeing on the screen
, it ' s david suchet
. tjhe director
, who buyed us the fugitive
, piles onthe all tjhe flash techiniques
, such as zoom
- in ' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. the lighting is also interesting
.
howver
, looks can ' t save this film from the depths of medioker
,
and the film seemed tothe work better inaddition a single setted anyway
. the screenplay isnt o
. k
,
bu there ' s smoe hackneyed sub
- plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street
( agina
)
adn tghe ending is suprisingly stupid
annd cliched
. the characters also make incredibly dumb moves
, especially paltrow
,
and stephen appears tothe lose all intelligence inwhich the last reel
. with a combination ofthe no tension
, drama
, or decent characters
, a perfect murder is a failure all round
,
and an incredible dissappointment
. there are a few bright moments
,
but tehy are far
and fewd between
. the last thing a thriller should be is boring
,
and
although the film jstu barely manages tothe keep your intrest thanks to michael douglas
, you wouldn ' t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect muder
. overall rating
= review by david wilcock
