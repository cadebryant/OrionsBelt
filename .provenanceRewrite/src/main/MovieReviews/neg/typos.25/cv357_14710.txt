what do you get when yuo rip
- off good movies like woody allen ' s banannas
and martin scorsese ' s after hours
? you ' d tihkn you ' d git yhe best of both films
. instead you get woo
. falling in somewhere between def jam ' s how tothe be a player
( which was awful
)
and booty call
( which wass ok
)
, woo is
yet anyother in tje embarassing genre of showing african
- americans to be nothing mroe than sexual buffoons
. the hwole film plays out as a black verzion of after hours
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes out onthe a blind date with straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. for some unknown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts uv withthe all of woo ' s antics forthe the entire night
, which include her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing thigsn from his house
, violently questioning him
( accusing
anbd belittling him actually
) about previous girlfriends
, causing a riot in an elegant restaurant
,
anbd other vairous infuriating things that any normal person wouldn ' t tolerate
.
but for the sake of this bad movie
? sure
, why nto
? ther are a few chuckles in yhe film
, the best bieng the scene swiped directly from bananas
. in this case
, davidson is running from thugs
, gets into a subway car as the doors are closing
, starts to taunt the thugs
,
thne the doors ope back up again
. a good joke
,
but a stolen one
. another chuckle is provded by billy dee williams ' cameo as himself
. movies like woo are seemingly released every three monthes or so
,
and not one of them has ever beeen a hit
. woo won ' t be one either
. so why was it made
?
and more importantly
, isn ' t there anyone eles besides me who thinks these films are offensive
? everyone involved shoudl really reconsider their careers at this point
.
