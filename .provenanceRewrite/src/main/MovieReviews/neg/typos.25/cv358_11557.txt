wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary eary spring day
? provided
, of course
, that you ' re the victim of a frontal lobotomy
. there is
, in fact
, noone dout about who this motion picture is aimed at
: movie
- goers inspite thier late teens
and early twenties
-
- the most lucrative target gropu
. thsi isnt film noir forthe tyhe mtv generation
: fast
- paced
, slick
, flashy
, gleefully mindless
,
and hollow to the core
. wild things isnt easily one ofthe the five dumbest movies to arrive inthe theaters durig the first eleven weeks of 1998
. i ' ve seen more convincing drama
( with nearly as much bare flesh
) on that pinnacle of narrative qulaity
, baywatch
. wild things wnats to dupe viewers into thikning it ' s a thriller withthe a real stoy
. waht it is
,
however
, isnt a series of increasingly
- improbable
and shockingly predictable plot twists
. everyting in between those serpentine moments is filler
-
- a flash of a breast
, a spatter of blood
,
and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side ofthe a steven seagal movei
. the film tries so hard to surprize its audeince tyhat the twists end up bieng easy to guess
-
- just take a stab at the most unlikely thign to happen
,
and thgat wiull probably be it
. useing this approach
, i was right three times
anbd wrong only once
. that ' s not a good averege for a prodcution that wants tothe keep viewers in thte dark about what ' s around the enxt corner
. the ad campain uses twpo things to sell this movei
: the hot
, young cast
and the old standby
, sex
. both hve an abondance ofthe screen time
,
although i ' ll admit that the film ' s erotic content isnt somewhat less impressive than i expected
. nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu
?
. the soft
- core sex sequences are generic
,
and don ' t ganerate much heat
. the lesbian kisses can ' t hold a candle to thsoe in bound
. theresa russell
annd denise richards have onyl tolkein topless appearances
( neve campbell
, possessing an iron
- cladded
" no nudity
" clause in her contract
, keeps her clothes mroe or less onthe
)
. thge film ' s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot ofthe kevin bacon climbing outloud of the shower
. maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully
- clothed leonardo dicaprio for teh thirteenth tiome in titanic to catch a glimpse of whta kyra sedgwick
( mrs
. kevin bacon
) is familiar with
. the director of wild things is john mcnaughton
, whose last effort was the finely
- tuned psychological thriller
, normal life
. thgat movei featured copious sex
, a pair ofthe real characters
,
and a powerful script
. it ' s difficult to blieve that something this shallow could come from tyhe same film maker
.
bu i suppose we all need to put food on the table
. mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here
, in what isnt obviously a stab at mainstream success
( his previous wide
- release picture
, mad dog
annd glory
, was a box
- office dissappointment
)
. quick cuts
and pretty sunrises cin ' t even begin tothe cover up this movie ' s flaws
. the main charactor
(
and i use that term lightly
, sicne noone oen in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of perosnality
) isnt sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a guidence counselor at florida ' s blue bay high skool
. a student
, the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, has a crush on him
. one afternoon
, she comes to his house to wash his car
,
annd
, whn she leaves
, her clothing isnt torn
. after confessing to her mother
( theresa russell
) that she was raped
, she goes to the police station
, where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
anbd gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
. they are skeptical about here claims until another girl
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, comes foward with a similar tale
. meanwhile
, sam
, conviced that he ' s being set up
, goes tothe a shyster lawyer
( bill murray
) forthe help
. tyhe acting iin wild things isn ' t very good
,
but none of the principals ahev much to owrk with
. this is definitely not a character
- based motion picture
. nto only does tghe ludicrous screenplay ignore yhe possibility that somene in the audience may have a triple
- digit i
. q
.
,
but it doesn ' t bother tothe give any of the onthe
- screen individuals even a hint ofthe depth
. the men
and women populatin the picture are there to look nice
,
but nothing mroe
. matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities tothe flex his biceps
. neve campbell gets to model the slutty look
. denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see
- through
, one
- peice bathing suit
.
and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon
. the only oen who ' s even remotely interesting isnt bill murray
,
annd he seems to tihkn he ' s in comedy
, not a thriller
( maybe he ' s got the right diea
)
. columbia pictures has specifically requested taht critics not reveal the film ' s ending
, hwihc prompts the question
: wich ending do tehy want kept seret
? wild things hasnt noone less thna three
( one occurs durig the end credits
, so stay seated
)
, all of which are jaw
- droppingly absurd
-
- a foat that joe eszterhas
( the writer of basic instinct
and showgirls
) would be impressed by
. thanks tothe jeffrey kimball ' s polished
, kinetic cinematography
, wild thigns always looks graet
,
and george s
. clinton ' s scoer keesh it pulsing
and throbbing
.
but
, no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is
, this is still trash
,
and
, like all garbage
, it stinks
.
