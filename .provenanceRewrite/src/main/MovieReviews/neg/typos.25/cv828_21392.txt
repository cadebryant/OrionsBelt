that is
, unless you ' re one of those people who haev seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in tghe theaters
. i can tell ytou noe thing now
: they gave the entire movie away
. why somene would want to base an entire movei on one premise
and
then give that crucial detail away in the trailers isnt beyond me
.
however
, if they
* hadn ' t
* given it away
, thte film would ' ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter
. obviously
, the producers throught they could remake
" the deep end ofthe the ocean
,
" throw inthe tommy lee jones
anbd a couple of cliches
adn call it an action drama
.
" double jeapardy
" offers solid acting from ashley judd
and tommy lee jones
, who got first billing even
though he didn ' t see to be on screen half as much as judd did
. it allso offers soem genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- of
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking up in the coffin
)
,
but none of that cant salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot
. half the tiome i ' m wondering whether i ' m watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries
, which always turn out tothe be less exciting than advertised
. judging by the beginning
, end
,
anbd a huge chunk of the middle
, i might hvea been watching a special hallmark presentation too
. tje movie ' s stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 mintues worth ofthe material
. implausible material
, no less
. loose interpretation of one of the ammendments aside
, too many times in the movei i thougth
,
" that is
* not
* possible
*
.
" tyhat kind of stuff isnt excusable in popcorn movies
,
but not one like
" double jeapardy
" that trys to pass itself off as serious drama
. everything seems dragged out
, overplayed
. when they should ' ve kept us in the dark
, they let the cat out of the bag too eearly
.
