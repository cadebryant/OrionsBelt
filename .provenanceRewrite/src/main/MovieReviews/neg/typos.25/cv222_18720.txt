synopsis
: an aging master art thief
, his supplier
,
and a young
, buxom security consultant are all not who htey firt appear to be
( or are they
?
) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist durig the millennium
. comments
: this movei was boring
. plain
adn simple
. entrapment should not ahev beeen boring
. it stars sean connery
, who can still carry an acation film despite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable anough film presense
,
and ving rhames
, ultra
- cool star of pulp fiction
and mission
: impossible
. it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears
( a current
" hot topic
" in teh news
) in its storyline
, which is setted at the end ofthe 1999
. it has some genuinely well
- staged action sequences
. so
, what went wrong
? plenty
, unfortunatly
. the major problem withthe entrapment isnt its script
. it has a been
- there
, done
- tath feel to it
. nothing seems particularly inventive or original
, so the whole movie lacks suspense
and drags
( it runs nearly two hours
)
. the screenwriters
, forthe example
, periodically ule a countdown tothe the millennium as a means of transition betweeen scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 days to the millennium
"
)
. this device wass unsed much more effectively in yhe overlooked sci
- fi film strange days
. the characters are not who they appear to be at tyhe beginning
, which isnt neat at frist
but the divice wears thin once the umpteenth
" surprise
" revelation is made
. entrapment
, in otehr words
, relies too heavily on the audience not knowing whta earch character ' s true motive is
, resulting inspite a convoluted story whlch leaves many scratching their heads in confusion
. the star pwoer here is qtuie storng
,
bu the viewer can ' t help
bu feel the actors are wasted in this production
. sean connery is given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames ' character seems liek an afterthought
; he ' s nto developed at all
. the camera zooms in frequently
and leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones ' s tight wardrobe
. this
, inaddition
and of itself
, is not bad
,
bu
, after a while
, it has a juvenile feel to it
. at least tyhe speices movies hold no bones about the fact that htey ' re exploiting the female body
. entrapment does the same under the thin disguise ofthe plot development
( sean connery supposedly falls in love withthe tghe girl while watching her
, in tights
, arc
adn pivot around lazer beams
)
. the tagline for this movie reads
" the trap is setted
.
" it sure isnt
, on thsoe who spended money to see thsi movie
. entrapment really isn ' t that bad
; it isnt watchable
. i would suggest
,
however
, one waits untill thsi is on cable or television to see it
.
