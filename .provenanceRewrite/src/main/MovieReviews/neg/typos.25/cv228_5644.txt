first
and foremost i think this movei comes to greif at the hands of the pg rating it ' s been given
. fo those ofthe us who haven ' t read tjhe james lee burke novel that heaven ' s prisoners isnt based on
, dont nto rabidly go outloud
and buy tickets to movies featuring hte combined talents ofthe alec baldwin
and eric roberts
, feel vaguely depressed by hte notion of swamps
, gangsters with louisiana accents
, plots
, sub
- plots
, more plots
,
and well
, really just want to see teri hatcher naked
, this is one movei you ' re oging to worry the price ofthe admission over
. hopefull still
? well
, let me share my moment of sheer panic
,
and
then the cold enervation of teh big let
- down when a semi
- robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin
,
" what do you think of my butterfly
?
"
. butterfly
?
, i asked myself
, wqat butterfli
?
!
and
then it hit me
.
.
. the scene had been snipped
! damn yuo
, godless pg rating
, show us her butterfly
!
! we want to see the goddamn butterfly
!
!
! so
.
.
. no naked teri hatcher
. foreget about thyat
. okay
? now
.
.
. heaven ' s prisoners isnt baout ex
- alchoholic ex
- cop dave robicheaux
( alec baldwin
) who ' s trying to discover life anew running a bait shop
and boat hire business with his loving
, down
- tothe
- earth wife annie
( kelly lynch
)
. everything dull
,
but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal inmigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while htey ' re on their boat
. thge plane nosedives inot the water
and sinks
,
bu from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie
- faced salvadoran girl whom he
and his wife immediatly decide to adopt
. what they don ' t realise isnt tyhat yhe plane ' s pilot wass also a drug dealer
,
and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter ' s erstwhile colleagues
. when robicheaux dicovers this
, he predictably
, against the advice of his wife
, a well
- meaninng dea agent
,
anbd two gangsters who rough him up
, beggins ' poking his nose where it don ' t belong '
, we know thyat the man deserves all the misery he ' s going to get
. the question now is whether or nto ytou want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious
, meandering
yet utterly suspenseless plot witht an unlovable hero as your guide
. as dave robicheaux
, alec baldwin is fat
.
.
. no seriously
, this is not the svelte
, thinking man ' s hero of the hunt for red october
, it is an out
- of
- shape guy who doesn ' t look too good in a roof
- top chasing scene
. he ' s allso unconvincing in thte movie ' s dramatic moments
, acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal
- like economy ofthe expression
. three
- quarters of thge way through the show
, hwile you ' re probably waiting for tghe next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temtation of the whiskey bottle
, getting drunk
anbd beating up someone or getting beaten up
, you ' ll want tothe beated onthe him a little youself
. on the other hand
, mary stuart masterson
( some kind of wonderful
, fried green tomatoes
, benny
& joon
) cast as a down
-
adn
- out stripper who hasnt her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air
, wiht jstu the right mix ofthe cynicism
, warmth
, insecurity
annd humour tothe be thte movie ' s only endearing character
. eric roberts as bubba rocque
, always believeable as teh woman
- abusing bad guy who knows how tothe box
( see final anaylsis
, coincidentally allso directed by phil joanou
) is believeable here as the woman
- abusing bad guy who knows how to box
.
and lest we forget teri hatcher ' s role in all this
, thsi bieng her rather well
- publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv ' s
" adventures ofthe lois
& clark
"
.
.
. she is totally ridiculous as rocque ' s manipulative
and seductive cajun wief
, comming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who ' s trying tothe get back at an employer who hasn ' t been giving her enought dyas off
. it ' s probably safe to say that her day job beckons
.
and at the end of our day
, none of htis is really worth 2 hrs
annd 12 mintues of our personal misery
. the flying inkpot ' s rating system
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent sutff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
