susan granger ' s review of
" tyhe watcher
"
( universal
) just whta we need
: another lurid
, trashy serial killer saga
. this time
, keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking
- clock cat
-
and
- mouse game with james spader
, a burnt
- out fbi agent who has sufferred a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with thte lapd
. to taunt spader
, who has relocated to chicago
, reeves packs up his trusty piano wire
and moves too
. before long
, he starts mailing photographs of the lonely
, unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims
, challenging spader
, along with the chicago police deparment
, to stop him within 24 horus before he strikes again
. in the midst of this murderous frenzy
, there ' s spader ' s psychologist
, palyed by marisa tomei
, who is even less convincing as a medical professional tahn jennifer lopez in
" the cell
.
" writers david elliot
, clay ayers
and darcy meyers
, along with firt
- time director joe charbanic
( helmer of music videos for reeves ' band dogstar
)
, dwell onthe the warped thrill of the methodology
and tjhe chase
, revealing
, eary on
, exactlly whodunit since the killer syas he
and the cop
" ened earch other to give meaning to our lives
.
" plus
, as reeves explains
,
" we ' re all stacked right on top ofthe each other
,
but we don ' t notice each other any more
.
" after thta
, it ' s all sound effects
and tricky camera
- work
, along with a muddled
, discordant soundtrack
. james spader ' s acting technique can be described as ' wooden deadpan ' hwile keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone ' dude ' persona which sometimes works
, somtimes doesn ' t
. chris ellis
, as spader ' s self
- important colleague
, is the onyl cast member who manages to be convincing
. on the granger movei gauge of 1 tothe 10
,
" the watcher
" is an appallingly awful
, amateurish 2
. the rela torture is watching it
.
