, so in the side plot
, the couple suspects eahc otehr ofthe being a murderer
. opinion
: bride ofthe chucky isnt an attempt at horror with humor
,
but doesn ' t succeed
. somehow
, chucky moaning baout mid life crisis
,
and how he shouldnt have gotten marryied does not make for a vrey scary chucky
.
and tiffany harping about mid life crisis
,
adn how she should have gotten married doesnt nto make for a very scary tiffany
. tyhe suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly ' s cleavage to keep attention during the first half
,
and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half
. the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic
.
