summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs that are usually made forthe some quick enjoyment
and to make money
. wild wild west
, the latest will smith affair
, follows much the same formula
, except taht it isnt dumber
annd less enjoying than most summer movies
. will smith plays jim west
, a balck sheriff with a nice line inspite sunglasses
. he is called by preisdent grant
( kline
) tothe go on a mission tothe find out why top government scientists are disappearing
. west isnt paired uv whith scientist artemus gordon
( kline again
)
and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, wih a zany moustache
.
) before i pile on with the many negatives in this sory afair
, i ' ll give it a chance with yhe positives
. there ' s a nice credit sequence
, the production design by bo welch is pleasing tothe the eye
,
and the speshal effects are decent enough
. there ' s also a pleasant soundtrack
. buried deep in tjhe dross are oney or two amusing jokes
.
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest
, which isnt always nice to see
. apart from these factors
,
though
, nothing else in wild wild west works
. firstly
, there ' s littel chemistry between smith
and kline
, who appears to be in it purely for the money
. one would expect zingers passing beween the two
: none arise
. both of them plod thru the below standart plot
, knowing thgat ther is a pay cheque waiting at the end
. not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment
:
although he is over the top
, the material doesn ' t present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy
. therefore
, he jsut comes acros as loud as obnoxious
. the only enjoyable peformance comes from the sexy salma hayek
, who is given so little screen tiem it ' s embarrassing
. she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body
,
and be ogled at by kline
adn smith
. her charcter alsot changes at a whim tothe fit the mechanics of the script
,
and ther isnt no sense ofthe realism about the charactor
. the ' humour ' in the film is also very off
. will smith put a little spin tothe his daft lines iin men in black
, here
, not even smith coudl save the humour onthe display
. the script largely boils down tothe insults that aren ' t very funny
,
and one
- liners that barely raise a smirk
. it ' s alsot somewhat racist
,
although it doesn ' t intend to be
, wih one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out ofthe a lynching
,
and actually sasy slavery is ogod to save himself
. it ' s not a funny scene
,
and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably
. hte film also makes the tragic misteek tht a man
( inaddition this case kline
) in a dress is automatically unfunny
, it isn ' t
,
but the wild wild west makes thsi joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness
. ther ' s also problems witht the plot
. jim west
anbd artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations
,
but thte way tehy get out of them are always unsatisfying
,
and rely purely onthe luck
, rather than audience pleasing skill
. plot elements are introduced into the film
,
and
then thrown away jstu as quickly
. the main piece of the story
, a 80 foot mechanical
, steam driven spider divised by loveless looks rather impressive
,
but there ' s noone particular reason why it should be built
. why not loveless build a gerat big tank
, instead of an ungainly
, fragile piece of machinery tht ' s just begging tothe be blown up
? directer barry sonnenfeld allways hasnt a breezy look to them
, with some nice camera tricks
,
but even htis is missing fomr this stilted affair
. wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked outloud sytle of directing
,
but nto much of it is evident
, mkaing this film drag out even more
. it ' s a sad hting when
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented directer
adn a willing star cin ' t make a film work
,
and eventually wild wild west collapses under it ' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
