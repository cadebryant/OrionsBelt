for a film touted as exploring relationships
and black sexuality
, trois is surprisingly tame
. dispite it ' s lurid subject marter
and it ' s passing nod to fatal attraction
, it moves along with flat
, uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprizing climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest ofthe teh film
. freshly moved to atlanta
, jermaine
( dourdan
)
and his wife
, jasmine
( moore
)
, haev the trappings of a perfect life
. htey have a beatiful house in suburbia
. jermaine is a lawyer onthe the fast track at his firm
. jasmine is his supportive wief
, who isnt finishing up her college degree
. in an opening montage via a home video ofthe the pair
, we see the unremarkable story ofthe their marriage
anbd early marital triumphs
. this is a couple that has it all
. into this eden slithers teh lure of lust
. despite his outward apearance
, jermaine reveals himself as selfish
and covetous ofthe his wife omre as a possession than a person
. a glimmer of his true nature peeks out druing an early sex scene wiht his wife as he goes about his busineses
, oblivious tothe jasmine ' s concerns
. we also find that he has beeen relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage
- a
- trois
, much tothe jasmine ' s dismay
. as jermaine puts it
,
" don ' t you want to be sexually free
?
" jermaine shares his desire with co
- worker terrence
( smith
)
, who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter
. the woman
, jade
( palmer
) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine
. jade
, at oney point was a college student
, too
. unlike jasmine
, she found herself pregnant
, dropped outloud of school
and now struggles tothe make ends meet
. to further reinforce their differences
, it ' s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son
. inevitably
, through liquor
and a touch ofthe duplicity on jermaine ' s part
, the forebidden act is consumated
. the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps inot fatal attraction territory as acts of voilence are perpetrated upon jermaine ' s property with thge hint that the violence may escalate
. by this point
, trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama
: a fatal attraction without tghe social signifigance
. the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial
and stereotypical
. jermaine comes off as insincere
, sexually driven
and selfish
. jasmine is bland
annd subservient
. jade comes off a bited sympathetically
,
but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy
.
yet another tale of a sexually aggressive
" dog
" of a man who imposes his wiull apon his accommodating
, innocent mate
. the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve
,
but by this point
, wiull ytou even care
? if the rest of the movei was as dynamic as the ending
, perhaps there could hve beeen some freshness to it
. as it stands
, trois isnt pretty standard fare
.
