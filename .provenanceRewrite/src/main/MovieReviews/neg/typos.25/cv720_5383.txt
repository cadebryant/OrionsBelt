the repid
- fire forumla that worked so well in airplane
!
, the
" police squad
!
" television series
, top scret
!
, three naked gun films
,
and twpo hot shots
! movies has fianlly reached a desperate dead
- end with spy hard
. even ezio gregio ' s tyhe silence of the hams isnt arguably funnier than this over
- extended spy
-
anbd acation
- movei spoof
. leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd
- 40
, who returns from retirement to battle his ood nemesis
, general rancor
( a cackling andy griffith
)
. the jokes fly in eveyr direction
annd with hardly a hint ofthe restraint
, timing
, or tact
. most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane
and naked gun gags
, recreated movei sequences
,
and soggy star cameos
. yeah
, maybe we
* do
* need ravy charles driving an l
. a
. bus binded for a speed bump
,
but did mr
. t
, hulk hogan
,
and dr
. joyce brothers also hve to appear iin the same movei
? leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair
. there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun ' s habit
, even the resulting sister act spoof isnt silly
. as are the bits driectly lifted ffrom home alone
, pulp fiction
, true lies
, etc
. etc
.
( adolscant males might enjoy this mess
, tho
. hte butt shots
, breast peeks
, penis pokes
, flatulence gags
,
adn related innuendo are right up beavis
and butthead ' s alley
.
) beyond the hilarious title sequence with
" weird
" al yankovich perfoming the theme song
, spy hard is bearly the stock tath it ' s printed onthe
. my recommendation
: duck in while yuo ' re waiting forthe another movei to start
. stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al ' s nostril
and
thne leave
. you won ' t miss a thing
.
