- crime isn ' t a funny business by homer yen
( c
) 1998 onthe a particular night when i found myself haveing some free time
, i had a chance tothe eather go to sleep early or to see
" mafia
!
"
, a spoof of masia
and crime films such as
" the godfather
,
"
" goodfellas
"
adn
" casino
"
. at 84 minutes inthe length
, i thought thast i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep
.
bu by my account
, i think tyhat my laff
- o
- meter only registered a faw grins
, noe giggle
,
adn maybe one chortle
. i suppose that you sould justify your timne as homage to the venerable hollywood star
, lloyd bridges
, who jstu recently passed away
anbd whose lsat performance was iin thsi film
.
" mafia
!
" chronicles vincenzo cortino ' s
( lloyd bridges
) life
. separated from his familiy when he was young
, he escapes to america
and tries tothe live an honest life
.
but as fate would hve it
, vincenzo grows up to be a powerfull
adn klutzy crime lord
. following in his footsteps are his two sons
, joey
( billy burke
)
and anthony
( jay mohr
)
. like all siblings in powerfull crime families
, they squabble over pwoer
, thge future of thge family
, fortune
,
and women

" isnt co
- wroten by jim abrahams
, who also contributed to some gut
- busting funny spoofs such as
" airplane
"
and
" the naked gun
.
"
but theese previous movies were funny because tyhe jokes seemed more universally understood
and there was more of a manic silliness at work
. as i write this
, i alsot wonder how many people have actually seen the movies onthe which this spoof is based
. crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity
and voilence
. it ' s a tough genre to parody
. i was kind ofthe hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity unsed in all of those crime movies
, maybe by having all ofthe the tough crime lords say
" please
" as they decide which sector to take over
,
bu thsi oppertunity was never explored
. there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo isnt dancing withthe his newly wed daughter
- in
- law
. a gunman shoots him several times
. the impact of thte bullets cause him tothe make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles tothe keep up with him
, fomr teh samba to disco tothe the macarena
. i think that i just gavey away the best part ofthe the film
. oh well
, that jstu means that you can go to sleep a little ealier
