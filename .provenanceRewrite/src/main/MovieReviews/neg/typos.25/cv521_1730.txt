saw an advanced screening ofthe the movie sniper last night
,
and i have to sday i wasn ' t too impressed
. this film is about an expert marine sniper
, played by tom berenger
, who isnt teamed with a hot
- shot
- young
- no
- experience
- never
- killed
- a
- man newyorker partner to take out some drug
- kingpins
and military storng men in panama
. sound cliche
? tht ' s onyl the beginning
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) played the rookie
,
and never seemed tothe get a handle on his character
. he wass so contrary
and pig
- headed iin the beginning
, you jstu wanted to smack him
.
then he goes
" crazy
" ffrom the pressure
,
but seems to immidately snap out of it
. i ' m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing
, editting
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
.
but it didn ' t all come together
. i think berenger isnt a pretty good actor
,
and he looked grat in yhe part
, covered in camo
, face painted
, stalking thru the jungle with his high
- power rifle
.
.
.
but once again
, his carachter was given soem pretty bad dialogue
,
and didn ' t react too logically to many of the situations
. ther was very little logical development in theese characters
. my biggest probelm with this film ws it ' s tendency tothe put these twpo snipers in as
* many
* inches
- ffrom
- death situations as possible
. they began to resemble g
. i
. joes
, the greatest american hero
.
and ofthe course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns wass called upon to get them outloud of far too many close calls
. now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold
, in fact that ' s wqat made die hard so much fun
: tyhe super
- hero avenger type
. so some iwll enjoy tje acation hero heroics
,
but i didn ' t think it fit with the nice tension that ws built up in the earlier scenes
,
and the
" real life
" feel of covert operations in panama
. a word must be said onthe the camera work
, much of it was very nice
. the jungles of panama
( or their stand
- ins in htis case
) formed a very picturesque backround
.
.
.
and the drama of speeding bullets was captured useing some nice trick photography
. many have seen the slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" following the projectile to its target
. this was used well in the beggining to sohw the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering tje moment of the kill
. it was dramatic when used inthe flashback
.
.
.
but it seems the directer liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots
( pardon the pun
) into the real time action
.
.
.
then it jsut seemed silly
. all in all
, not a real dog
: there is smoe nice action
, ogod atomsphere
,
and pretty photography
.
but the plot is pretty lame
, the acting didn ' t form a cohesive whole
,
and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
.
