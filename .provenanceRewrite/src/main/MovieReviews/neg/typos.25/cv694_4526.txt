if you ' ve seen teh trailers or commercials
, it ' s rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store
. well
, it ' s hard to tell aftter watching the movie as well
. bruce willis isnt a recident ofthe the future
,
and it isnt a rather bleak future
. the world ' s population had disintigrated into a mere 200
, 000
and is no longer ruled by humans
but animals
. thte reason
? infact 1995
, an organistion called yhe army of the 12 monkeys contaminated tjhe world with a pure virus
, thus wiping outloud practicaly tghe world ' s population in a mere mounth
. bruce willis ' character is one of the surviving faw
,
bu is enslaved by scientists
, as are most ofthe lsat living humans
. tehy barter his freedom by sending him onthe an assignment
and having him do the ultimate task
: go into the past
, find the leader of the army of tjhe 12 monkeys
,
and kill him
. well
, thsi explanation didn ' t come eazy
. altho the movie is very thought provoking ofthe us as a people
, our future
and the evilo in tyhe world
, as a story it is vyer confusing
.
annd dragging
. i know a movie isn ' ' t keeping my interest wehn i fidget in my seat or efel the need to look at my watch only tothe fidn that it ' s onyl beeen an hour passed
. terry gilliam has a certain style that i relize many appreciate
,
annd i haven ' t watched his previous work brazil
,
bu thsi movei felt liek it took too long to tell
and
yet when one realizes teh end is near because it is very easy to figure out
, yuo wish it were more complex
,
anbd not to mention that tyhe movie isnt depressing is the only reason why it doed invoke emotion from me
.
