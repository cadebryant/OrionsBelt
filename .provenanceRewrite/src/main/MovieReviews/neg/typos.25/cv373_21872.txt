: 132 mintues we go inot a movie theater
, boom
! the lights go down
, our hearts race
, we go thru ten mintues of preview
and finally the movei we ' ve been waiting to see for a long time comes on
. we sit there
, watch in disbelief that htis movei is as bad as it is
. why shouldn ' t i have know whta i wass getting mysef into
. again like this past summers hit
" stigmata
"
,
" end of dyas
" may be worse
. it ' s not like this is any kind of orignal idae
, it jsut throws in some
" rosemary ' s baby
"
, along iwth
" hte devil ' s advocate
" a little
" exorcist
"
anbd soem
" stigmata
" here
and there
. whala yuo have
" end of dyas
" a movie that is extremely disappointing
and by the previews made it look terrific
. sadly
but truly again liek most recent films
, all the good parts are in the trailers
. the plot which isnt vyre confusing at times is also very ludicrous
anbd the movie is destined to be a hitted in the first weekend
,
anbd flop infront the next
. jericho cane
( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role
) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan
( living in gabriel byrnes body
)
and stop him from impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) because if he doens
,
and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist
. he hasnt to do tihs before it turns inot thge year 2000
,
and strangely he ' s trying to fight him 5 mintues before 2000 comes
. he seeks help from the catholic church
and help ffrom rod stieger
( inthe a terrific role
)
and tries tothe save this girl leading tothe an ending that ' s satisfying
,
bu turns into a typical action movie
. taht ' s preety much it onthe plot
. it does have the razzle
and dazzle of a gerat action movei
,
and with the 100m doller budget parts seem to sohw it
, parts you ahve to wonder where all tje money whent
. as for arnie
? good role
, ok performance
. i thiunk since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts
. tghe thing that disappointed me was the fact thyat there ws nothing tothe the film
. in the trailers it looks like a ogod scary
, acation film
and ends up being a boring
, long
and preposterous drama that leads inot something else tht leaves us wih questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironically palyed a priest inthe
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan
and gives a ogod performence
bu again seems held back
and not into his character
. two years back al pacino gavey a terrific performance in tghe fun
" the devil ' s advocate
"
and here it seems like the idea of him is in the charactor also
. robin tunney
( great performance as always
) plays satan ' s main person whom he wants tothe impregnate to carry his child
. of course rod stieger gives another great performance whlch really isn ' t nothing newyorker
. the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown
,
though not nearly as the visual style was in
" stigmata
"
. here we are given graet camera work
,
and some great scenes that are terrifically directed
but sadly jstu don ' t work inspite this movei
. the script writed by andrew marlowe hasnt a few witty lines
,
but agian the movei is all style
and no substance
and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home
. only a few thigsn work here
and those are a faw of thte performances
, the writing
and visual style
,
bu the storyline
annd the finished product don ' t work as well
. the sad thing is that
" end of days
" hadnt so many things going for it
. the plot could have beeen more organized
, the action scenes could have been more brainy
and less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems liuke
" armageddon
"
anbd started tothe get old
and tiresome
. hollywood is runing out ofthe ideas bad
,
and like i ' ve always said before needs newyorker ones
. even with its 100m budget
" end ofthe days
" is less than pleasing
. in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over
,
anbd easily coudl have hadnt a 70m budget
. maybe i sound crazy
,
but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film
,
annd hope that they amke it as good as yhe orginal
. we need to get new idaes
and stpo recycling old ones just tothe make money at the box
- office
. we need to get more films like
" tje blair witch project
" tyhat coudl scare people to death
, while people thinking well wqat exactlly is sacrin them
and how do i know that it is in fact tghe blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid
and thin plot
- line
, good performances
, disappointing
.
.
.
. umm yup those preety much describe
" end of days
"
