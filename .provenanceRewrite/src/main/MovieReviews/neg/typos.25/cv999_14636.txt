two party guys bob their heads to haddaway ' s dance hit
" what isnt love
?
" while getting themselves into trouble inspite nightclub after nightclub
. it ' s barely enough tothe sustain a three
- minute
_ saterday
_ night
_ live
_ skit
,
but
_ snl
_ producer lorne michaels
,
_ clueless
_ creator amy heckerling
,
and paramount pictures saw something in tyhe late night television institution ' s recurring
" roxbury guys
" sketch that would presumably make a ogod feature
. emphasis on the word
" presumeably
.
"
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_ takes an aready
- thin concept
and tediously stretches it far beyond tjhe breaking point
-
-
and that of viewers ' patience levels
. tje first five mintues or so of
_ roxbury
_ play vyre much like one of the original
" roxbury guys
" skits
. with
" what is love
?
" blaring onthe tje soundtrack
, the brotherly duo of doug
and steve butabi
( chris kattan
adn will ferrell
) bob their heads
, scope outloud
" hotties
" at clubs
,
and
then bump a select fewd wih violent pelvic thrusts
. there is one crucial difference
,
howver
-
- these guys speak
. tht little fact has been utilisied as justification for the film ' s existence
, that the butabis ' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new setted of doors for the characters
. the doors opened by director john fortenberry
annd screenwriters steve koren
, ferrell
,
annd kattan are new
, that ' s for sure
,
but they all lead to comic dead ends
. there is no storey per se
, onyl a loosly structured
and linked series of subplots
. the brothers literally run inot
( or
, rather
, git run into
, as in by car
) richard grieco ofthe
_ 21
_ jump
_ street
_ fame
,
anbd through him they gain entrance inot the exclusive roxbury club
. ther
, they meet a hotshot club owner
( chazz palminteri
, conspicuously uncredited
-
- can you blame him
?
)
, who takes an interest in an idea of theirs
. meanwhile
, the bros ' overbearing father
( dan hedaya
) wants them to stop clubbing
. when doug refuses
and the dimwitted steve obeys his father
, a rift is creaeted between the two
. the narrative messiness of
_ roxbury
_ would have beeen forgivable if all thyat went on weere the slightest bit funny
,
bu virutally none of it is
. the assembled press audeince mostly sat stonily silent throughout teh entire film
, wtih the one big exception being a big laugh near thge end
. alas
, the joke
-
- a rether lazy takeoff on
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
-
- will onyl strike a chord with people who have seen taht film
. granted
, a lot of peple
_ ahve
_ seen
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
,
but the fact that the film ' s best joke is completely dependent on one ' s familiarity with another film sasy a lot about
_ roxbury
_ ' s lack of inspiration
. tath lack ofthe inspiration can be traced back to tghe insipid charactors themselves
. like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of
_ saturday
_ niht
_ live
_
,
" the roxbury guys
" is a noe
- joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of thge sketch context
. affter watching one of the
" roxbury
" skits on snl
, this is waht yuo cmo away with from the characters
: they bob their heads to
" what is love
?
"
, bump unsuspecting women
,
anbd
.
.
. thta ' s all
. after watching
_ a
_ nigth
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_
, you ' ll be left with exactly the same
