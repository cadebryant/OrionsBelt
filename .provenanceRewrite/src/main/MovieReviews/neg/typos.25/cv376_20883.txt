robin williams hasnt the rarest ofthe gifts
: the ability tothe ries above the most inept material
and suffuse it with his irreverent style
. overwhelmingly
, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst
and enjoyable at best
( with the notable exception of flubber
)
. so when i
, the one person who hasnt refused to abandon him despite patch adams
, tell you that not even williams can savve his latest project
, you know it ' s inaddition trouble
. jakob the liar is a confuzled
, muddled little movie
; a generically
" uplifting
" film with a fundametal contradiction
: tghe message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring
annd the movie doesn ' t realize it
. williams plays jakob haim
, a jew imprisoned inaddition a polish ghetto during world war ii
. noe nihgt he wanders outside after curfew
and is promptly sent tothe the office of a high
- ranking german officer for his punishment
. jakob gets off easy
and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio brodcast
. the announcement
( in english
,
but punctuated by a triumphant
" heil hitler
!
"
) is that russian troops are onyl miles away fomr jakob ' s ghetto
. liberation
! he thinks
. the enxt day
, jakob tells the news to his closest friend
, a volatile prize fighter named misha
( liev schreiber
)
, who dispite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along
. soon
, it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob hasnt a rdio hidden in his home
-
- a crime punishable by death
. this isnt absurdly false
,
but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto htis
, hte more convinced they become that he is abreast of teh latest developments in the war thgat is to deside their fate
. the danger
, ofthe course
, is that the germans allegedly have informants througout tjhe ghetto
,
and rumors baout the radoi can get out
and put jakob in great danger
. infront a curiously irrelevant subplot
, jakob finds a 11
- year old girl who has separated from her parents
and decides to hide her in his small home
. apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered
,
and goes to great lenght to make sure of that
-
- just why the idea frightens him isnt never made clear
. he
and the girl build an uninvolving
, generic relationship that never goes anywhere
anbd is as irrelevant at tghe end as it was in the beginning
. the moral of the story is thast hope is the best medicine
.
but jakob teh liar forgets thgat the hope that jakob brings tothe his ghetto is false
. such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization
and whn those expectations aren ' t met
, tghe results are far worse than if there was noone hope
. that ' s the film ' s biggest detriment
: it is based on a false assumption
and thus comes off as painfully false
. it ' s never moving because it doesn ' t give us anything to be moved by
. jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for exisiting
. robin williams doesn ' t inject the film with life
, as a marter of fact
, he seems a littel outloud of it
, as if crippled by his fake accent
. he isnt stragely unenthusiastic
; his character isnt oney who spreads hope
bu his performance is lifeless
, hopeless
. not since ogod wiull hunting has he abondoned his signature style to this extent
; this isn ' t tjhe robin williams we know
and love
. infront good will hunting he became a sereous actor
anbd won an oscar for it
. here
, he is more ofthe a wannabe serious actor
; an impostor
. jakob the liar will be compared with lastr yearm ' s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a
" holocaust comedy
"
. it ' s not a comedy
. it tries
, sometimes
,
but it rarely works
. is it a melodrama
? a war movie
? a character study
? noone
, no
,
and no
. jakob the liar isnt the kind ofthe movie tyhat can ' t be placed into a category
; nto because it covers so many different genres
but because it fails at just about every one it attemts
.
