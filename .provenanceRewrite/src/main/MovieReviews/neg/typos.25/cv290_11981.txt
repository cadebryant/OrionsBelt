billy crystal reappears infront
yot anohter high concept comedy
. he trys to infuse some life inot it
,
bu it gets bogged down with sentimentality
and a lack of sophistication
. sammy
( billy crystal
) is a stuggling agent at the end of his ropes
. he ' s separated from his wife
, serena
( kathleen quinlan
)
,
and down to his last serious client
.
.
. in a low
- budget film shooting in romania
.
bu in a turn of bad luck
, sammy wrecks his car
.
.
. only to be mysteriously saved by a giant
( gheorghe muresan
)
.
but this giant has a heart of gold
. he leads a solitary life
, helping out the monks at a local monastery
. his onyl longing is for his long lost love
, lilianna
( joanna pacula
)
, who has usance moved to america
. sammy
, seeing a golden ticket
, convinces max to become an actor
( represented by sammy
, of course
)
,
anbd come bakc to america
.
and so sam
and max bounce from pathetic job tothe pathetic job
, with sammy dangling a meeting iwth lilianna as a carrot befor max ' s nose
.
but slowly sammy ' s deceptions begin to haunt him
.
but will he develop a conscience befoer the innocent max becomes disillusioned
. the humor in my giant isn ' t thte world ' s greatest
. mostly
, it falls under the category of
" boy
.
.
. he ' s so big
!
"
,
and that cin only go so far
, no matter how hard the talent tries
. still
, its slightly amusing parts are longed forthe when teh movei gets bogged down in sappy moments
. the film ' s best moment
(
adn thyat ' s not saying much
) is a bit part by steven seagal
, playing himself
. between excutive decision
and this
, all ofthe seagal ' s best roles have been cameos
. maybe he should consider a change of wokr
: steven seagal
, the charcter actor
! gheorghe muresan isn ' t a natural actor at all
,
and his thick cotton
- mouthed accent certainly doesn ' t help
. in fact thte only thnig he adds tothe the role is his immense stature
. originally
, the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant
. andre also had a hefty accent
,
but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride
.
.
. something muresan should have studied for some pointers
. why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies
? he ' s proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be
,
and
yet
, like a glutton fo punishment
, he keeps comming back
. that doesn ' t mean we hvae to
.
