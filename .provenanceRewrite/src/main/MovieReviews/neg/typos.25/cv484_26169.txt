way of the gun is brimming with surprises
, smoe ogod
, most bad
. one of the good ones is ryan phillippe ' s surprizingly halfway decent performance
. after the actor gained much attention by posing
and preening through teen swill like i know what yuo did last summer
, he hinted at a bit growth inspite last year ' s cruel intentions withthe his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance
,
though his acting in that film faltered around the third ect mark
, precisly when the screenplay made his charachter grow a heart
( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans
)
adn start bellyaching baout how he ' d fallen for his
" target
"
. it was a dramtic shift that niether phillippe nor the film ' s director could negotiate
.
but he seems to be trying
and that shouldn ' t be overlooked
( or probably over praised
) seeing as how
, at this point
, he really isn ' t required to do much
but look pretty
. here
, phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard
, his hair askew
and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it ' s tough to bleieve a pretty boy liek phillippe as a hard ass
,
but his performance actually helps with yhe illusion
. unlike ben affleck ' s puppy dog approach in reindeer games
, phillippe is believable
and not too bad at that
. as forthe the plot
, well
, that ' s oen of the bad surprises
; phillippe
and the great benicio del torro play twpo moronic
(
and not even remotely likeable
) criminals
( introduced to us infact the parking lot of a ravey where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people
) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) after overhearing that she ' s carrying teh baby of painter
( scott wilson
)
, a very well connected wealthy man
. the kidnapping devolves inot a labourious shoot out where much dammage is done
and many are killed
.
but the anti
- heroes excape with yhe woman while an agin hit man
( james caan
)
and twpo scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs
adn nicky katt
) remain iin pursuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, teh screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects
, an overrated piece ofthe crime noir in many circles
( this one included
)
, way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that jsut oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn ' t seem tothe be growing at all
; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i ' ve seen befor
and worse
, it fiels liek it
. the film lacks even a fresh approach
( like what soderbergh doed out of sight or the limey
) to its clich
? s
, all of whcih are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desparately tothe be hip
and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is
. it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up inwhich sam peckinpah 101 rether than any thing resembling life
. even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan
and benicio del torro stop in thier tracks tothe hvea a cup of coffee
and pontificate on life
, philosphy
, etc
. i didn ' t like teh bit much whn it first appeared in heat
, here
, it ' s even omre self consciously
" dramtic
"
. usual suspects
, which also featured a bunch ofthe low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies
, worked tothe some degree because of that astonishing twist ending
. nowdays an astonishing twist persay endig is de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all that transpired befoer it completely inconsequential
. thus
, nearly eveyr charater in way comes wtih at least one dirty littel secret
( most amateurishly projected before they apeared
)
adn it too has an ironic little twist at the end
( nothing earth shattering
, like in the usual suspects
)
but i admiting
, i didn ' t see it coming
,
and i smiled
.
howver most ofthe the movei feels exactly like the interrogation scenes vetween palminteri
and spacey in usual suspects
: a lot of faux huffing
and puffing with no rhythm or reason
. or substance
. it ' s just as overplotted as suspects
,
anbd oftenly dull as any overplotted movie without intresting characters
, a disctinctive style
, or a good script would be
. even the ogod stuf
, most of which involves james caan
( donig a fine job
)
, feels odd
and out ofthe place in a movie that thinks lines liuke
" karma is only justice with outloud the satisfaction
" are clever
. at noe point caan laments
" need isnt the ultimate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said
" love is like hippo ass
"
. i ' ve seen porno with better dialogue
.
and some witht better plot lines too
.
but rarley has porn offered up such a talented cast
( i mean
, cin you even compare james caan to ron jeremy
)
. caan slips inot this role wtih seeming ease
, he sould do this kind of soft
- spoken tough guy in a coma
,
but he manages tothe give his character depth
anbd weariness
. benicio del torro is allways welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gavey us in usual suspects
and excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering
. speaking ofthe pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, is a weak link
, either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling about like a silly goose
. nicky katt was brilliant iin a brief role in the limey
, here his role isnt just as breif onyl he seems wasted
; he ' s only kept arund for his cold presence
. taye diggs has a similar funtion
, cool as ever
,
but never a charcter
,
though thte guy has one helluva death scene
. for the most part way is incessantly talky with noone reason tothe give a hippo ' s ass about any thing that transpires usance its characters are never more than simplistic pawns
. it ' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
,
but inwhich a bad truth
and consequences nm way
, with phillippe
, in one scene
, leaping inot a stupid rant about
" faggots
" migrating to los angeles
. you know the routine
. tjhe final shoot out isnt pure bargain basement john woo
( who hismelf seems to be doing bargain basement john woo
) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shooted at
.
but those gun shots sure crack like thunder
. just the otehr day i ws watching an old dirty harry movei on cable
and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt
- like soudn that emanated from harry ' s fetishized smith
annd wesson
. oh how far we ' ve come
.
