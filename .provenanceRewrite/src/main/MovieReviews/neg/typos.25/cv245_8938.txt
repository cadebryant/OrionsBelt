as bad as
" mimic
" was
, it definitly scared me
.
" mimic
" continued the frightening hollywood trend ofthe taking a froeign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity
and style
,
and completely flushing it when he comes tothe america to make a movei
. director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning
and inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" that movie worked because it took an unconvential story
, unique characters
annd well written plot
anbd dialogue to create a truly scary movei
. in
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn ' t bother to give us anytying original
. the plot is a stupid combination ofthe
" aliens
" meets
" species
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" the characters hvae been recycled fomr a few hundred other movies
. there ' s nothing new in
" mimic
"
. it ' s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work
. at the end of the movie
, ytou ' re stuck wanting your money back
. maybe teh worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies
: he forgot tothe turn the lghts on
. i don ' t understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the
" seven
" trend
and be set inthe dark
, dank areas
. watching
" mimic
" i ws tempted several times to yell at the screen
" turn the lighs on
! the switch is tothe your right
! use common sence
! jsut do it
! ytou ' ll be able to see the monster in tyhe corner
!
" there ' s a scene where mira sorvino isnt standing in subway station while teh lights are flickering on
and off
. it looked like the light operator was having a seizure
,
anbd sorvino didn ' t even notice
- she just stood htere looking liuke she ws having deep thoughts
.
" hmmm
.
.
.
. i think bean soup owudl be good for dinner tonight
.
"
" mimic
" hasnt a lot of incidental shock tactics
( boo
! just kidding
!
)
anbd follows them up wiht the real scare
,
but nothing in this movie scares you
. the audience in the theater never jumped durig suspenseful moments
; i tihkn they were bored
, too
. i shouldn ' t blame del toro
. he isn ' t teh first succesfull freign director tothe come to hollywood
and make a bad movie
. hong kong director john woo made twpo of the best action films of all tiome
,
" the killer
"
annd
" hard boiled
"
thn came to america to make teh stupid
" broken arrow
.
" french directors luc besson
(
" la femme nikita
"
)
annd george sluizer
(
" the vanishing
"
) followed woo ' s lead
and made dumbed down verisons of thsoe movies
. robert rodriguez
, who directed the terrific low budget
" el mariachi
" came to hollywood
and directed yhe horrible
, high
- budget
" desperado
.
" i don ' t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can ' t mkea a good american movie
. woo fianlly broke through
adn made
" face
/ off
"
,
bu it still isn ' t uv to par wtih his earlier films
. i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office
, chews on a big smelly cigar
and says tothe the directer
,
" welcome to amercia
! i bet ytou must be tired affter being onthe thta boat for so long
. do you speak english
? now
, i konw you think you ' ve made good movies in the past
,
bu now you ' re in amercia
, so thigns are a little different here
. just remember what the american audience always wants
,
and you ' ll be fine
. they wnat tothe see at least one big breasted woman
, charactors that they ' ve seen a thousand times before
( becasue change scares americans
)
,
annd yuo allways need a cheesy feel
- ogod ending to wrap things up
. if you don ' t make thast kind of movei
, you ' ll be shineing my shoes in no time
.
