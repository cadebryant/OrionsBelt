in a typical cinematic high school
, the football jocks have sex with the girls
adn
then dump them
,
bu not befoer the boys ' scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books
. as the sexual acts take place
, the other guys hang out nearbye
, guzzling beer
and grunting like pigs
. in the rage
: carrie 2
, robert mandel ' s terminally bland sequel tothe carrie
, ther isn ' t a single original moment
. onyl amy irving returns from carrie
,
and the talent of the rest ofthe the sequel ' s casted isnt impossible to determine given yhe stupefying mediocrity ofthe rafael moreu ' s script
. as rachel
, tje horror story ' s lead
, emily bergl gives oney of the least scary performances in receet memory
,
but it isn ' t exactly her fault
. the director asks for little fomr his actors
, which is precisely waht he gets
. sporadically infront this lame
and lifeless movei
, rachel will cause skool lockers
adn windows tothe fly oepn
,
bu generally she just mopes arund looking liek a victim
. her fellow students delight in tormenting her
. ofthe course
, she will get her revenge in the obligatory endig bloodbath infront which she will decapitate
and castrate the boys
and crush the girls whith burning timbers
. as the movei marks tiem until its big finale
, it throws in some repugnant scenes
, hoping to turn audience ' s stomachs
. rachel ' s girlfriend commits a horrible
and realsitic suicide after the boy who made
" love

? about it all
.
" doesn ' t it offend yuo taht some girl offed herself yesterday
,
" asks one of hte few kids with a cnscience
.
" why
?
" responds his nonplussed girlfriend
.
" she wasn ' t anybody
.
" remarkably devoid of any energy
, expecially forthe a horror flick
, the movie makse noe yearn for a fast forward button on tjhe theather ' s armrest
. with material this bad
, the film ' s only hope is to go for parody
,
but it isn ' t smart enought to relize it
. even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless
and predictable as the rest ofthe yhe movei
. the rage
: carrie 2 runs 1
: 45
. it is rated r for graphic violence
, teen alcohol abuse
, sex
, nudity
and profanity
