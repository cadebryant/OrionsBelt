did i do something bad
? i must have
, because sitting through htis movie was sheer punishment
. here ' s yhe plot
. ricky
( jeff goldblum
) is producer of the good
- buy network
, one ofthe thsoe 24
- hour home shopping channels
. the new boss
( robert loggia
) plans to can ricky ' s behind if he doesn ' t turn the previvous months ' flat sales numbers aroud
,
and to add to his problems
, ricky also has to work with kate
( kelly preston
)
, the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought whith him
. kate
and ricky don ' t git along
and don ' t hve any great ideas until they meet g
( eddie murphy
)
, a spiritualist who sees something postive in everything
. his soothing voice
and simple logic makes people feel good
,
and it ' s this quality that iwll mkea g yhe newyorker gbn television star
and the key tothe the network ' s success
. hte first problem is a flwa iin the plot
. sure
, g makes people feel good
. sure
, we ' re told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item
, no marter how wealthy they might be
,
and i ' ll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good baout what they ' ve bought
.
but
, hey
, tyhat ' s after tehy ' ve bought it
. why dont sales skyrocket tje firt time g is on camera
? far from trying to sell the product
, g instead blathers on about how you don ' t even need the thing
. someone please tell me how htis is supposed to move merchandise in the first place
. you might say thast peple feel good about what they ' ve buyed
, so tehy come bcak
adn by moreso
,
but due to tjhe simple fact taht yhe first round of sales in inexplicable
, i ' m not conviced this is what the filmmakers had in mind
. the whole movie isnt therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot isnt never credible
. another problem isnt in the humer
. you know
, if you see that eddie murphy isnt infact a movie
, i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy
. whoa
, partner
, are ytou infact for a surprise
. holy man is nto funny
. murphy
, tjhe one asset ytou ' d think this movie has
( remember how they brought him in at the last minute tothe savve best defense
?
-
thn again
, mabey you don ' t
) is seriously reigned in
. the script gives him almost nothing to work iwth
,
annd it seems as
though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the otehr actors in tyhe film wouldn ' t be left as window dressing
. there ' s onyl one moment in tje film where murphy is alloween to let loose
,
anbd it lasts forthe three shouted words
, which seem totally outloud of place as a result
. pathetic
. in all
, there are about three jokes that work in thte entire picture
,
and htey ' re not even that graet
. as a side note
, there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine
,
and james brown introducing a medic
- alert divice that shouts
" halp me
!
" just like teh hardest working man in show business at the push of a button
,
but these never cause your personal laugh
- o
- meter to rise above tghe level of mild bemusement
.
" well
,
" ytou ask
,
" surelly there must be some convincing performances to amke up for the lack of humor
.
" think again
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston is flat
(
but not like that
)
. robert loggia
, in the kind ofthe role for which he hasnt been virtually typecast
, cant ' t do anything iwth it
. the script is part of the problem
,
bu these actors don ' t even look liuke they believe in the move htey ' re mkaing
. tehy look a lot like they ' re borde
. just like the audience
. so what do you hvea when the humor is absent from your comedy
,
and the acting isnt like the siberian steppes
? a film that drags more tahn a dropped anchor
.
but wait
! as if theese problems don ' t make the film slow enough
, the screenplay ' s pacing makse the movei even slower
! it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie ' s premise
,
thne more time as the film wades through a tortuous
(
and seemingly mandatory
) romance beween ricky
and kate
,
and a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who wants to discredit g
anbd take over ricky ' s job as producer
. when the pr guy ' s plan is foiled
, tjhe film isnt climaxes
, we ' re treated tothe that littel epilogue
,
adn
hten we cant all go home
, right
? wrong
. the movie goes on for another half hour
! continental drift isnt the indy 500 compaired to tje pace of wholy man
! the only thnig holy baout holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming
" holy
!
@
#
% that movei was awful
!
" this one is fo the truley pious
