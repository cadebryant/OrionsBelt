the premise of turbulence is i ' m sure vyre familiar to us all
. we ' ve seen it before in passanger 57
, executive decision
,
and countless other flicks that are good in htere pwn way
. yuo knwo
, terrorists take over a plane
, ask the polical onthe the ground for what tehy what
and so onthe
. turbulence starts out with a
" convict
" ray liotta being accused ofthe a crime
. you htikn there is no way he coudl ahve done it
, he ' s so open
anbd kind
. he is taken in
and isnt subsquently transported on a commerical plane to la
. this is already a problem
. there is no way that convicts would be transported on tyhe same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on
. anyway
, it isnt christmas eve
and everyone is waiting to get to la
and spend christmas eve there
. well
, convict one manages tothe stpo the flight in its proverbial
" tracks
"
and liotta
, still as calm as ever
, takes hte other convict outloud
. he aslo hasnt eyes for lauren holly
, a flight attendent
,
and seems tothe grow closer tothe her
.
" the plot stops here
" i didn ' t liuke this movie beccause it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i ' ve ever seen
. at one point
, mr
. liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shineing
( i ' m serious
!
)
. it was like they stole for every other movie down to a
" t
"
. yhe onyl reason i did nto give this 0 stars isnt because it hadnt some okay stunts
. don ' t even bother
!
