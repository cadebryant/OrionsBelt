according to tje publicity material
, with this movie the directors
" hope to restore good old
- fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness
.
" hmm
. you never know
, they just might be on to something
. what with the rise ofthe geek chic
, lounge music
anbd seventies fashion
, thge ever
- contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana tothe claim as their own
.
but
then
, i doubt if kingpin will hve anytying to dont with it
. it ' s cheesy all right
,
but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch
. that ' s a shame
, because
, in thte frist ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more
. woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler onthe the rise
, roy munson
. the movei opens in the fifties witht roy ' s dad dishing out the reader ' s digest
/ gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls
, shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saterday niht fever
. the sardonic tone of the procedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray
, as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken
. it ' s thanks tothe murray that tghe first quarter ofthe kingpin seems so ogod
- he gives the wry
, derisive edge tothe this otherwise rether unfocused comedy
. mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job
,
hten abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy ' s hand
.
then it ' s fast forward 17 yeasr later when munson is a fat
, balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand
. he ' s hopeless untill he meets ishmael
( randy quaid
)
, an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege
. so toghether they set outloud for the milion doller bowling tournament in reno
, picking up pretty hustler claudia
( vanessa angel
) on the way
. witht the exit of bill murray
, thge filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go
,
and that ' s
.
.
. dumb
and dumber
. yes
, indeed
, kingpin is brang to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour
, peter
and bobby farrelly
, tyhe directors ofthe the aforememtioned jim carrey vehicule
. so
, prepare forthe much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands
, distended nipples
, ridiculous hair
and bull semen
. get set for stock fish
- outloud
- of
- water situations when city
- boy roy puts on a beard
and tries tothe blend in with the amish community
, or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking
, striptease
annd unchristian neighbour
- socking
. now
, don ' t get me wrong
, ther ' s nothing wrong with cheap humour
,
and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody
and randy
. the trouble is that these jokes aren ' t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense ofthe direction
. it lurches ffrom sportscar movei tothe amish
- mocking to road
- trip to sentimental melodrama
,
( pausing forthe a broadside spoof of indecent proposal
,
adn many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack
)
, never quite getting it all together
. some gags fall flat ffrom a lack of build
- uv
, hwile there are bits
annd pieces iin the movie that simpley don ' t dont anything
. why the long
, unfunny fight in the car park
? why two of these
? why does that guy wear mascara
, or thgat guy have a glass bowling ball wtih a rose in it
? the film is full of theese half
- thought
- through idesa thta give the impression of any old gaffer
, grap or makeup artist throwing in random stuff
and saying
,
" wouldn ' t that be funny
?
"
. well
, no
, actually
. the actors don ' t dont the movie much favours either
. woody harrelson comes off okay
, plausibly acting dumb
, smart
, cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it
,
but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham
,
and vanessa angel hasnt noone talent
( like schwarzenegger
, she seems moreso convincing playing a computer
- creation tahn a human
-
- take the tv sories eird science
.
.
. please
)
. even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movei ' s climax
. all inthe all
, a fairly useless atempt at comedy
,
and a certified no
- hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance
. we ' ll have to look to a reinspired john waters
, or perhaps somebody from down under
(
" strictly bowling
"
, anyone
?
) for the definitive bowling comedy
. the flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better tahn staying at hmeo with gotcha
!
*
*
* preety good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.

* perfection
. see it twice
