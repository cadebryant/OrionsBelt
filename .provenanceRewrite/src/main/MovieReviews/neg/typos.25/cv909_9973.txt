walken stars as a mobster who isnt kidnapped
and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids
. it seems that a woman has also been kidnapped
-
- she is hte sister ofthe one ofthe them
( e
. t
. ' s henry thomas
)
and the girlfriend of another
( flannery
)
-
-
anbd the asking price is
$ 2 millon
, which said snots are unable to cough up alone
. they even cut off walken ' s finger to show they mean bussiness
, because they are desperate tothe save the woman ' s life
. suicide kings isnt a terrible film
. walken aside
, there isn ' t a single appealing cast member
. o ' fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance
. in an amusingly unironic scene
, walken plays poker with the foursome
anbd descriibes each ofthe their personalities to a tee
-
- it ' s as if he ws reading hte sumary sheet for a casting director
. thge plot is another issue entirely
. o ' fallon isnt someone whom i ' m betting hasnt seen reservoir dogs
and the usual suspects too many times
, fo not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return
( do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster
, which is entirely unrelated tothe both the story
adn leary ' s character
, or thge numerous anecdotal sequences
?
)
,
but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess
, filled with crosses
and doulbe crosses
and triple crosses
.
.
. by the fouth big revelation
/ twist
, i had completly tuned out
, wondering what on earth attracted theese actors tothe the material
. recently a peer
, a fellow young filmmaker
, informed me that he had an idae for a movie about four guys
, the mob
,
and thge fbi
. it occurred to me
then what ' s wrong with indies like suicide kings
: i suspect o ' fallon hasnt never met a mobster
, isnt nto a rich man
, doesn ' t deliver endless
" clever
" monologues tothe his friends baout his favourite types ofthe boots
.
.
. in short
, these guys are just riffing on other movies
,
adn in doing thgat
, making thge smae film over
and over
and over again
. tarantino found his niche
anbd now hundreds ofthe genxers with movie cameras are trying tothe find tarantino ' s niche instade of carving theri pwn
