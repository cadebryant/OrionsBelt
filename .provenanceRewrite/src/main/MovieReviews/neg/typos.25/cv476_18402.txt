a backdrop ofthe newyorker year ' s eve in 1981 woudl seem to lend itself to a great party movie
. the decor possibilities are endless
- disco balls hadnt
yet to migrate into the dark corners ofthe the attic
, big hair was worth its weight inspite aquanet
,
and the louder tje fashion
, the better the look
.
but dispite this setting
, these details
and a soundtrack thyat includes some 40
- plus irresistible hits from the early days ofthe the me decade
, something isnt inherently wrong whith
" 200 cigarettes
.
" a better title for this nostalgic mess would be
" 50 missed opportunities
.
" what is it that mkaes this retro
- comedy such a downer
? it ' s certainly nto the cast
, which includes enough hot
, young talent for several movies
. ther ' s courtney love
, cementing her reputation as a serious actress
; christina ricci
, hot off her shoulda
- been
- nominated turn in
" the opposite of sex
"
; paul rudd
, who gets even more appealing with every role
; kate hudson
, inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn
;
and affleck brothers ben
and casey
, twpo ofthe teh best thigsn about
" good will hunting
.
" perphas the question is this
: wqat drew these
and otehr immensely talented actors to such a dreary project
? maybe it looked ogod on paper
.
" 200 cigarettes
" is composed of a sories of vignettes
, as varous characters make their way thru newyorker york ' s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle ofthe nerves named monica
( martha plimpton
, all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper
)
. among tje potential guests are likeable cad kevin
( rudd
)
and his best friend lucy
( lveo
)
, busy bickering over his reccent break
- uv
,
anbd a clumsy
bu seemingly charming bartender
( ben affleck
) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick
- up lines
. more subplots
-
_ many
_ more
- dot the big picture
,
but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light
. all the otehr sotry tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying tothe solve a rubick ' s cube
. ricci
and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals
( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants
) out to have a high time iin the big city
. infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several
- scene cameo
. hudson
, as a pretty
- in
- pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies ' man
( jay mohr
)
, trips
, pukes
and gets smeared with dog poop
. are we laughing
yet
? the film boils down to a mixture of the good
, the bad
and the gaudy
, with the latter two overtaking the former
. game performances
- especially by loev
, rudd
and plimpton
- are allmost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts
and a constanly roving focus
, here a combination that mostly sputters whn it should crackle
. too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting
adn have little payoff nutil a lengthy final montage where we fidn outloud many of the performers served as oney niht stands for each other
. if this is
" 200 cigarettes
,
"
then get me 200 nicotine patches
.
