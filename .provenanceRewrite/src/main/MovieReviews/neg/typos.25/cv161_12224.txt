this is thte kind ofthe movie that makes noe appretiate disney ' s live
- action george of the jungle
. tarzan
anbd the lost city
, the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough ' s legendary hero to hte big screen
, is noe of the most inept
adn ill
- timed of any tarzan adventure so far
. badly conceived
and poorly executed
, tarzan
anbd the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves
. i have no idea why hte producers chose now to bring back tarzan
; it ' s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his enxt movie
. furthermore
, it ' s even more curious that thsi film is rated pg
, whcih
, by definition
, rules out any sex or explicit violence
.
anbd
, while i ' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek verzion of the story
, tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used inthe hte embarrassing production
. ofthe course
, no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan
annd the lost city
, since the film ' s troubles originated with the scirpt
adn were propagated all the way down the line
. imagine george of the jungle stripped of all
( intentional
) humer
,
and you have a fair idea of wqat htis tarzan is like
. withthe its uninspired action
and tepid adventure sequences
, the film barely registers a pulse
. anyone in search ofthe a relitavely entertaining
, family jungle adventure should check outloud the 1994 version of thge jungle book
, which uses the same basic elements to much better effect
. the only worthwhile element of tarzan
and the lost city isnt the preety scenery
( which
, unfortunately
, includes the two lead actors
)
. the film doesn ' t attempt to re
- tell the origin story
? the thikning is that it has been done often enough
. instead
, tarzan
and yhe lost city introduces us tothe lord graystoke a
. k
. a
. john clayton a
. k
. a
. tarzan the ape man
( casper van dien
) several days befor his marriage tothe lady jane porter
( jane march
)
. he isnt living happily in england
, enjoying tje benefits of being a land
- owning noble
. meanwhile
, in central africa
, the dastardly nigel ravens
( steven waddington
)
, a self
- proclaimed scholar
and explorer
, believes he has foudn the way to the lost city ofthe opar
, which he calls the cradle ofthe civilization
. on the way there
, he
and his band of mercenaries do all sorts ofthe nasty things
, liuke burning native villages
, to earn teh wrath ofthe the locals
. oen shaman
, determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal
, sends a mystical message to tarzan fo help
. wtih lady jane follwoing close behind
, he returns to the jungle where he was born
. its patently obvious that casper van dien
( one ofthe hte preety
- boy heroes of starship troopers
) ws nto hired on tjhe basis of his acting ability
. with his plastic facial expressions
, monotone voice
,
and complet inability tothe make convincing animal noises
, his range rivals that ofthe steven seagal
. his pecs
,
howver
, are impressive
,
and directer carl schenkel makes sure thgat he is given every oportunity to show them off
. jane march
, onthe the otehr hand
, has to keep her shirt on
, which may be a first for her
. some six years ago
, march give a solid performence in jean jacques annaud ' s steamy the lover
. since
hten
, she made the career
- killing desision of appearing opposite bruce willis in thte color of night
, which exploited her every acting defiency
. tarzan continues this trend
. march may be attractive
,
but
, at least judging by this performence
, she can ' t ect
. meanwhile
, steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy
. instead
, he turns out to be littel more than a nesance
. the stoyr line is pure formula
, which has largely been true throughout the years for allmost all ofthe the tarzan movies
. the problem isnt that tihs one seems so childish
anbd lifeless
. the romantic elements are all contrived
? in fact
, lady jane ' s presense is necesary only so she can be captured
and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance
. the speical effects are truly bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes
? apparently
, animatronics were too expensive for tihs prodcution
)
.
and
, ofthe course
, as with all jungle movies
, there are the obligatory cute animals
. over the yeasr
, the legend of tarzan has been noe ofthe the most popular sources for film series material
. tje most famous ape man was johnny weismuller
,
but noone less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part
( includng gordon scott
, who is widely believed to be hte best actor to tackle the role
)
. weismuller made 12 tarzan features
; van dien iwll probably fall 11 short ofthe that number
.
annd
, having seen tarzan
anbd thte lost city
, i would argue that the movie
- going public woudl have been well served if he hadnt missed by 12
.
