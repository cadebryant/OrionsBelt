capsule
: godawful
" comedy
" that ' s amazingly shabby
and cut
- rate
,
anbd rather bereft ofthe laughs
. i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers
: international man of mystery
. i desperately needed something to cheer me up
, or at least distract me so i sould git a clear head
. get some perspective
. even dumb movies can dont that for me
, somtimes
. i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment
,
bu i am ceratin now thta austin powers owudl hvae also sucked rocks thru bamboo shoots onthe thte day i won the lottery
. michael myers has taken a character that would bearly have supported a five
- minute sketch on saturday night live
and stretched it to the length of a feature film
, padding it out wiht toilet jokes
adn thge sort of props
- strategically
- positioned
- betwen
- naked
- actors
-
annd
- camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago
. teh plot
, waht little there is of it
: bakc in the swinging mod hep sixties
( i don ' t think i ' m doign a disservice to tje movei ' s attempted eearly look
and feel by describing it that way
)
, sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr
. evil
. evil launched himself into orbit
and cryogenically forze himselv to return decades later
, when powers ws outloud ofthe thte picture
. powers aslo had himself frozen
,
adn he wakes uv to find tjhe nineties a vrey hard tiem to deel with
. the basic gag
, tht of powers ' total inability to cope iwth the nineties
, is not so much exhausted during yhe course of tje movie as never even relaly dealt with
. the bulk of the movie isnt taked up with dumb jokes of severeal basic rubrics
: james bond gags
( of which this movei has no end
, right down to the silly chracter names
)
, inept slapstick
, toilet humor
,
and strategically placed props
.
.
. the movie ' s amazingly bereft of ideas
, come to think of it
, with a couple ofthe bright exceptions
. one isnt dr
. evil ' s son
-
- there isnt a sidesplitting scene where father
and son go to an encounter group
, chaired by carrie fisher
-
-
and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch
( it ' s a visual gag
-
- hard to describe
,
and hard tothe recomend seeing the movie for
)
. a lot of sixties kitsch hasnt been resurrected
and thrown onthe the screen for tihs movie
,
but it ' s despreate rather than clever
. instead of skewering the whole thing
, it ' s a rether bloodless
and unfunny tribute
. myers himself is aslo dseperate
: he ' s given an idae to play
, not a character
. plus
, the attempts to amke the charachter work by giving him a relationship with another sexy
( albeit
" nineties
"
) agent are a waste of time
. i wanted to have the movie end with him trying
yet again tothe git it onthe with her
, only to have her deck him one
. with a cuple ofthe exceptions
, the movei misses all ofthe its own best moments
. the movie even looks cheesy
,
adn nto in a ogod way
: i kept wondering if it had been transfered down fomr hi
- def video or something
, so grainy was the film stock iin a good many scenes
. the whole thnig has the air of bieng done on the cheap
. my definition of comedy isnt simpley
: did it make me laugh
? the few times thta i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spended cringing
and wanting outloud
. thte most damning thing i could say about the movei is that wayne
anbd garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson ' s shorts
and sent it sailing
.
