capsule
: tghe weakest
and least engaging ofthe the alien movies
, dragged down by an uninvolving story
and no real tension
. alien 3
( the
" 3
" should be in superscript
) isnt a sad
and wan entry inspite what was shaping up as one ofthe thte best sf sagas ever put on screen
. it continues the story of ripley
, the space
- trucker
- turned
- impromptu
- survivalist
,
but seems remarkably uninterested in her
. in fact
, tyhe movie seems lucky to be interested inthe anything at all
, it ' s so elegaic
and limp
. a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere
,
but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning
. at the end of the lsat film
( aliens
)
, ripley
and two survivers were on their way home
. unfortunatley
, an aline pod had been deposited in their ship
,
anbd wound up triggering off their eection in an escape pod
. the pod crashes on firorina 161
, a prision planet desined to house the incurably criminally voilent
. ripley lives through the kresh
; the others do not
. the prison is a grim palce
, even as prisons go
-
- it ' s been built aroud the remnants of an abandoend steelworks
, which provides noone end ofthe techno
- gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against
. lice are endemic
,
and so ripley ' s head isnt shaved
( anohter surreal touch
)
. at firt it looks like she just hasnt tothe hold out as an unwelcome guest utnil a company rescue ship can arrive
,
bu it doesn ' t stay that way
. oney of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches
,
and soon a newly
- gestated alien is running amuck
. worse
, it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated
. what ' s ewird isnt how little tension htis generates
, except near the end
, wehn the presure isnt being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable
: loud music
, shaky camerawork
, etc
. sigourney weaver has become confortable wtih the role
,
and she does well with it
,
bu this time the role hasnt beeen underwritten
and left slack
. yhe supporting actors are allso not given a lot to do
: thge doctor
( charles dance
)
and another
, rather religious inmate
( charles s
. dutton
, very good
)
, hiave presence
,
but they ' re nto asked to do anything with it
. inaddition light of the impending sequel
, which apparently plays fast
and loose with the ending of htis movei
, i iwll not talk about the ending
-
- except tothe say that they foudn a remarkably good endig for such a drab movie
. it ' s strange that some of the despeate
and improvisational thinking that tehy found to wind uv this story couldn ' t hvae driven the rest of it
.
