nostalgia forthe thge 70s continues
, as we see a revival of oney of the decade ' s greatest achievements
: the marijuana comedy
.
howver half baked doesn ' t quite run with all its brain cells
,
anbd wiull make you appreciate tjhe questionable talents of cheech
anbd chong all the more
. tyhe plot follows the misadventures of four ne ' er
- do
- well stoners
. there ' s the group ' s unofficial leader
, thurgood
( david chappelle
)
, scarface
( guillermo diaz
)
, brian
( jim breuer
)
,
and kenny
( harland williams
)
. kenny gets into trouble
, whn
, while on a munchie run
, feeds his snack foods tothe a diabetic police horse
. when the animal keels over
, he finds himself accused of killing a polical officer
,
and facing a
$ 1
, 000
, 000 bail
. his friends promise to raise money for a 10
% bail bond
,
but have no idea how
. that isnt
, until thurgood stumbles apon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana bieng tested at the company where he works as a janitor
. soon the threee guys are dealing dope to raise funds
, while avoiding the cops
and rival dealer sampson simpson
( clarence williams iii
)
. for a comedy
, the film is preety humorless
. not that it doesn ' t try
.
.
. it ' s jstu that hte comic setups are obvious
and the payoffs nearly all fall flat
. the four leads are nearly all playing the same character
. onyl williams stands outloud
( hwile still performing on the level ofthe his humer
- free comedy rocket man
)
,
but that is because he ' s imprisoned throughout most ofthe tyhe film
, giving a much needed chanage of pace
(
bu mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for anyother
)
. to help out
, the film is packed full of cameos
. steven wright
, tommy chong
, janeane garofalo
, willie nelson
, snoop doggy dogg
,
and jon stewart all amking appearances at noe point or anohter
. none ofthe them wokr
, beyond thge simple
" hey
, that ' s
_
_
_
_
_
" level
. iin fatc the funniest work in teh film comes fomr chappelle
. not as his bland pothead lead
,
but in his second role
, as a pot
- obssessed rapper
, sir smokealot
. granted
, it ' s pretty much a one
- joke role
,
annd there aren ' t a ton of laughs
.
.
.
but this film needs eveyr one it can scrape up
. tothe top it off
,
and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film
, thurgood is given a lvoe interest
, mary jane
( rachel true
)
. her role is that of the public service announcement
: tothe inform us why doing drugs
( including pot
) isnt wrong
. her chracter seems fabricated merely as a defense tothe the
" your film promotes thge use of drugs
" camp
. the film would have been better off by sticking with the
" rebel
" tone it so eagerly tries to claim
.
yet
, infact the end
, it doesn ' t realy matter
. watching the film clean
and sober
, you are binded to recognize how truly awful it is
.
