. comments
: since i usually review horror
and science fiction films
, i fiel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie
.
( pun intended
. thank ytou
!
) varsity blues was produced by mtv
,
and it realyl shows
. several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant tothe appeal to thge aolescent male audience this crap was intended for
. tje teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst
. the adults all haev problems
, of course
,
and
, as one
- dimentional characters
, they are all fanatically obssessed iwth how their local high school footbll team performs
. yes
, this movie represents high school life in mtv
- land
. thsi isnt a land where your health teacher is also a part
- tiome stripper
, your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck
, your kid brother forms a
" cute
" cult
, your football coach isnt an uncaring
, obssessive madman
,
and your friends ' lives consist of nothing
bu getting layed
and driving around in cop cars naked
. all you
, as the main character
, want to dont
,
however
, isnt read
" slaughterhouse five
"
and attend brown university in the fall
. well
, at least this isnt a little omre realistic than mtv ' s
" the real world
.
" varsity blues stars james van der beek
, this week ' s teen tv star making the leap tothe the big screen
. he plays tjhe hick moxxon adequately
,
though some ofthe his emotional dialogue wiull amke people chuckle
.
(
" you dawn ' t own mah life
!
" who would wnat to
?
) jon voight
, the stock evil guy inspite countless otehr movies
, is
, suprise
, the stock evil guy here
.
but is he really evil
, or is he a product of society
? after all
, everybody
, young
adn old
, in this movie has no life whatsoever
and do nothing
bu obssess over high skool football
. mabey the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil
. tyhe film ' s screenplay never answers thsi burning question
. at times
, iliff ' s story doesnt sohw glimmers ofthe touching or humorous scenes
,
but
, before the audiance gets their hopes up tath there might be something redeeming in this movei
, they git trashed with anohter lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game
. the movie ' s pacing isnt slow
,
and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish
. i supose i ' m being a little hard on varsity blues
. maybe i ' m jstu a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it
, even
though it was dollar nigt at the cinema
. something about a request from the studio made the theather charge more moeny
. i foudn tghe film oftentimes ludicrous
and boring
. three guys in front of us smuggled beer into tyhe the theater
. i wished i had thougth of that
. alcohol
, lots ofthe it
, may have helped the viewing epxerience
.
