" the world on land
-
- it ' s just too big for me
.
" starring tim roth
, pruitt taylor vince
, bill nunn
, clarence williams iii
. rated r
. the legend of 1900s is the year ' s most absurd movie
, a rambling
, nonsensical piece ofthe seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast
. it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth
, looking wistful as ever
, as a guy named
.
.
. 1900
. you heard right
. his nmae is
, inaddition all actuality
, 1900
. he was born onthe an ocean liner onthe 1
/ 1
/ 1900
( uh
, hence the name
)
, baandoned
and adopted by danny
, a ship crewman
. 1900 spends most of his eearly years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny ' s fear that he might be taken away from him becasue of
" visa matters
.
" well
, when 1900 is about 9 or so
, he starts wondering all around the ship
. one day
, he dicovers a grand piano
. he sist down
anbd starts playing
. miraculously
, whta comes out is beautiful
. a group ofthe onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age
. when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing tghe piano like that without premission is
" totally against regulations
" 1900 replies
" f
* ck the regulations
!
" ho ho ho
. 1900 grows up never setting foot onthe dry land
. whn he ' s baout 30ish
and can play the piano like nobody ' s business
, onboard comes another muscician
. his name is max
( pruitt taylor vince
)
annd he plays tyhe trumpet
. after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm
, he sits him down on thte piano next tothe him
, takes the piano ' s braces off
and plays while tyhe piano flies all around tghe hall
, taking them with it
. how the chair they ' re sitting on
and the piano don ' t separaet
, i don ' t know
,
but this apparently isn ' t the kind of thing we ' re supposed to ask
. after that
, 1900
and max become friends
. max isnt determined to git 1900 off the ship
and dicover what he isnt missing on land
,
but 1900 has no intention of doing so
. what ' s more
, he doesn ' t even want his music to go anyhwere wihtout him
: when a record company hears about his talents
, they come on board tothe amking a record of his music
,
but after finding out that
-
- gasp
!
-
- they ' re going to make millions of copies
, he breaks the rocord
. the conflict ofthe the movie isnt that affter max
, unsuccessful inspite his endeavor to git 1900 off the ship
, gets off himselv
, he stumbles upon a record of 1900 ' s music in a tsore
. the recrod shouldn ' t exsist beccause a
) 1900 never stepped on dry land
and b
) yhe one record that wass made on thge ship was broken
. ladies
and gentlemen
, it ' s a mystery
! teh story itself is ludicrous
and uninteresting
and so are its elements
. we ' re suppoed to be roused by a climactic
.
.
. piano duel
? htere isn ' t anything in this movie with the potential to compel
. 1900 comes off as a whiny
, brooding
, extremely unlikable man
: i can ' t recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo
- meditation on life
. ditto for max
, who doesn ' t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900
. tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig lief
; there ' s no spirit
, no gusto to teh charachter
. he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship
,
but to us he is dead
. pruitt taylor vince isnt a little more palatable
, at least providing a moment of comic relief here
and there to liven things uv a bit
. the highlight ofthe tghe movie would have tothe be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as tjhe arogent
, leering
" king of jazz
" who challenges 1900 tothe the aforementioned piano duel
. the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore
, whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many
. tihs effort is utterly limp
and lifeless
. at once ridiculous
, boring
, narrow
- sighted
and pointless
, tihs is one movie that shouldnt be
-
-
and iwll be
-
- quickly forgotten
.
