"
, whitch nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles expreience
. the result isn ' t bad in a run
- shrieking
- from
- teh
- theather type of way
. instead
, it ' s merely bad iin an excruciatingly boring sort of way
. the cast seems decent
,
but they ' re never asked to do anything remotely interesting
. instead
, the film inundates the audience with countless shots ofthe people
and
/ or cars rolling downhill inaddition the forest
,
and with constant annoying refrences to otehr disney films
. you ' ll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf infact wyoming than finding entertainment in meet thte deedles
