. htis isnt a teen movei
, all right
, except the main characters aren ' t teens
. drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter
, only it ' s very clear ffrom the onset that she lacks the toughness
and the pushy extravertedness thgat marks the best of reporters
. tghe story she ' s covering is not realyl a stopry
,
but a story in the making
. she is to return to high school as a student
and explain what ' s really going on
. the irony is tyhat drew ' s character
, was such a dweeb firt time arund
, that she is terrified at gogin back
. whn she does
, she sasy the wrong things
, wears the wrong clothes
,
and projects the

" supposed
" to be more beautiful thna her
. what works
: drew ' s geeky old

, big glasses
and braces
. it ' s vyre funny
. what doesn ' t work
: drew ' s geeky new

. come on
. nobody dresses as bad as she doens
. couldn ' t she just go to
_ the gap

. the comedy is suppoed tothe progress whn drew ' s yuonger brother
( plyed with zest by david arquette
) reenlists to jump
- start his baseball career
. now
, how in thge world can somebody as nerdy
(
but infact a funny way
) as he cin be the most popular kid in the school
.
.
. in a day
?
! the dialogue in tyhe film is
, well
, an embarrassment
. her co
- workers
( molly shannon
, john c
. reilly
and gary marshall
) are in terminal hyper
- drive
. her teenage peers
( exept sobieski

, has her hand stamped
,
and over the night associates with some rastafarians with soem delicious
, um
, cake
. she goes wild
, sleeps in late
. when she wakes
, she rushes off to skool

, lieing on her stamped hand all night
, has transferred part of the stamp ' s image to her forehead
, spelling
" loser
"
. funny
, eh
