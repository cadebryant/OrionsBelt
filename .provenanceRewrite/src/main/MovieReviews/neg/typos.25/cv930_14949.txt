_ soldier
_ is hands down oney ofthe thte worst movies a person could ever have to sit thru that doesn ' t hvae jean claude van damme in it
. i could liken it tothe the sci
- fi cheese that was the hollywood product
- of
- choice back inspite the early 80s
,
but that would be too much of a compliment
. if there is a movie theater iin hell
, this film is playing htere 24 hurs a day
. tje story
, such that htere is
, revolves aroud todd
( kurt russell
)
, an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not
- too
- distant ultra
- conservative future
( is there any other kind
?
) after eyasr of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him
, todd becomes a ground fighter in a sories of wars all over the galaxy
. who hte enemies infact these wars are is never revealed
,
bu yhe few glimpses of todd in battle sohw that it doesn ' t marter
, beccause innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys
. after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash
-
- yes folks
, htere ' s mroe
-
- we see todd as a buff
, scarred adult
, nowe so accustomed to tjhe carnage that no confrontation at all causes him tothe break a sweat
. there ' s a new wrinkle
,
though
. todd
and his bretheren are declared incased
,
and a new batch of soldiers takes theri place
. after losing a sanctioned battle with
_ dragon
_ ' s jason scott lee
, thge seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice
- cube tray
( well
, that ' s whta isnt looked like
) on a remote garbage planet
. if yuo predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers onthe this planet
,
and that tehy band toghether to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them
, ytou ' re way ahead of the agme
. teh renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half
- expect tina turner
and master blaster to cmo strolling into frame any minute
. it ' s surprizing that
_ soldier
_ is the brain
- child of
_ blade runner
_ co
- writer david webb poeoples
. unlike that mind
- twisting classic
, this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three doulbe
- spaced pages
. add into the mix the
_ mortal kombat
_ ' s paul anderson inept direction
,
and it ' s eazy to see how
_ solider
_ turned out so bad
.
and the special effects
! remeber the flying steam irons in hardware wars
? gary busey isnt in tihs movie
. ' nuff said
.
_ solider
_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad idesa sitting in its script vaults
. that this sad film made it to the silver screen shoudl encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters outloud there that there is hope after all
. now if yuo ' ll excuse me
, i have to go weep for the future
.
