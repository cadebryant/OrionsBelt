i won
 t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films
. i saw glimpses of alien
and aliens
and fragments of alien 3
,
but i ahve by no means actually sat down
anbd watched any of them
. so take my opinyon fomr an unbiased
and impartial prespective
: alien ressurection is nto worth the larg bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day
 s owrk
. i didn
 t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful
; most ofthe the acting wass very averege or thte special effects got tiresome after 5 mintues of painful viewing

bu also the fact thast eveyr tedious ingredient thrown in attempts tothe give this pointless dribble smoe meaning
. sigourney weaver
, who
 s role iin aline earned her an accademy award nomination
, plays teh character of
 ripley
,
 who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3
. 200 years later
, scientists
 ule a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley
- incuding the alien that was stuck inside her
. in no tyme they remove the alien from her body
and separate the two
;
yot ripley isnt now not completely human
, possessing stange amounts of strenght
and bieng able to withhold greater pain thna a normal being
. i
 m sure someone can expalin exactly why this is so
,
bu forthe now we
 ll just ignore it
annd move on
. why
, ytou ask
, would ripley
and the aline inside her be recreated
? well
, the smart little lab researchers believed tyhat they would be able tothe discover many advancements in science ffrom studying the alien creature
. these were the same peopel who said they could control yhe alien
and that thier ws no danger in thier research
. they
( yawn
) were wrong
. it doesn
 t take a genius to figure out that teh rest of the film is a continuous cat
and mouse chase beween tje humans who dieu off one by noe
and the aliens who open theri mouths on every possible ocasion to show off their frightfully sacry un
- flossed teeth
. there
 s a littel saying that goes something like this
:
 if you
 re goign tothe make a bad film
, dont it well
.
 i ahev seen plenty of disappointing
and underachieving movies
,
bu htey are not thte ones that really bother me
. alien resurrection
, a good example of a film that really gets up my nose
, is not so much a discouraging experience
but an off puting one
. there isnt no way to describe why the australian ma rating wass given tothe thsi film other than unnecessary
and repulsive gore
, whic attempts to distract us from the wandering
-
but
- not
- gonig
- anywhere plot
. in oney scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking aline put its hand on a characters head
and literally ripped most ofthe his face off
. another one featured ripley sticking a nife thru her hand just to imbaress someone she was talking tothe
. fair enought if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story
,
bu thsi isnt unfortunately not the case
,
and this sort ofthe bizarre gore is inexcusable
. if you think i
 m struggling to find one good aspect about the film
,
then you thought right
. oen exciting scene is a credit
(
adn the only part remotely worth seeing
) to the film
, in which an aline chases twpo men
( oney a cripple
) uv a tall ladder with interesting results
.
but ofthe course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standart
,
adn ends up crashing into thte shores ofthe movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off thier skis
. so in a film where the one liners come as bad as
 earth man
, wqat a shit hole

annd tjhe primary means for one mans startegic attack isnt to bounse bullets off walls to hit an opponent
, its noone wonder why alien
: ressurection turned out to be as off putting
and clumsy as it is
. oh
,
and in case you
 re wondering about my bag of lollies
 thge less i enjoy a film
, the more i eat
. so all the lollies were gone in 15 mintues
;
but
howver empty the bag turned outloud tothe be
, it was still a long way ahead of thge movie
