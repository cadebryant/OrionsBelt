the haunting
, a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film
: to scare us
. if you ' ve ever seen a movie
, which you probablly have concidering you are onthe this website
, yuo shoudl know baout all of yhe trivia they post befor a movie
. they hve thnigs like illustrations
anbd you have to guess tjhe movei or facts about thte film
.
bu
, the one i always like are the
& quot
; other name
& quot
; joke that try
and rename a parituclar film
. for instance
, tje noe palying befoer the haunting had different titles for the film
, small soliders
. they had titles like little infantry
and can i get thsoe fatigues in a smaller size
? well
, after seing the haunting
, i hadnt a few particular names for it as well
. unfourtunately
, i cant only post one ofthe them
, otherwise
, i ' d be getting some pretty angry e
- mails from overprotective mothers
. that title owudl be yhe confusing
. ok
, that is a pretty bad title
,
but it fits this film perfectly
. it basically serves up no purpose
,
adn combined with dry dialogue
annd a boring
and confusing plot
, it completes the formula fo a cinematic bomb
. liam neeson once again gets wrapped uv in a film without any depth
,
but at least the phantom menace ws exciting
annd had some depth
. the haunting isnt nothing
but trash
,
but unfortunately
, will still make a boatload ofthe money
. befoer i rant
annd rave about how bad htis film is
, let me point out teh faw
,
and i stres the word few
, bright spots inthe tihs film
. first
, teh house isnt great
- looking
. it looks beautiful
,
but this is also a dark spot
. it looks so grat that it is hard to be frightened by it
. this is something that rears its ugli head at all points of the film
. things look so great
, that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight
. haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful
and tyhat isnt being eerie
. the hill hous isnt not eerie
. it is beautiful
,
but not tje least bit frightening
. ever heard of lili taylor
? befoer this film i doed nto
,
but i am glad that i do nowe
. she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film
. despite hte dry dialogue
and boring
/ confusing consept
, she manages to light up the screen every time she appears
,
bu unfortunately
, her co
- stars are usually follwoing right behind
. owen wilson
, who plays luke
, is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable peformance
, other
then taylor
. he is basically there fo the comic relief
,
and his charachter development is poor in all other areas
. all of tyhe characters are desperately underdeveloped
. wilson hadnt potential as luke
,
bu it seems tehy just needed him to add a few laughs
. liam neeson
and catherine zeta
- jones suffer fomr yhe dialogue
and plot
and should not ahve beeen in this film
. their charactors must suffer fomr wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave
and whatnot
. they just are not believable
and tihs is the fianl nail inwhich the haunting ' s coffin
. the plot is terrible
. the opening scene of the film is vyer important
,
but the director makes it too obvious by getting close
- ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film
. as i sat through the film
, i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish
. nell
, lili taylor ' s character
, goes ffrom the hunted to the savior
. it mkaes no sense
and tyhe director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that tkae palce in the film
. he forces thte viewer to make various assumptions
annd does not give any inthe
- depth information
. for instatance
, the begining of the film gives us a sense of why nell isnt getting involved in thge programe
.
but
, we get zilch for the other four
. plus
, two of them get wiped out in the first ten mintues
.
and tje worst part
: most horror films have killings
. for some reason
, they kill off luke at the end of the film
. no reason whatsoever
, just off with his head
, literally
. overall
, yhe haunting isnt the epitome of a bad movei
. bad plot
, confusing storyline
and a waste of ogod talent
. hopefully
, liam neeson can rebound
and get inot a ogod film
and be used to his full potential
. hopefully
, lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film
.
and hopefully
, other horror films
, such as the blair witch project
anbd tjhe haunting ofthe hill house
, will not be as bad as this one
.
