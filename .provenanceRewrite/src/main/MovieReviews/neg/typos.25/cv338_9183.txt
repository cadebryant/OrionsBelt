wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration ofthe epic propotions
. over black
and white drawings
, we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear excange
, sending thte remnants of humanity through generations ofthe radiation
- induced mutation
. the
" original
" inhabitants of the earth
, fairies
and elves
, return tothe populate tyhe globe
, along with their evil
, mutant counterparts
. one day
(
adn i say
" one day
" not to be trite
,
but becasue that ' s exactly how it happened
- noone advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth to twins
, one good
and one evil
. the twins grow up tothe be powerful wizards
, thte good one embracing magic
,
adn the bad one utilizing technolgy to attempt to expand his evil empire
. we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occurr between the forces of magic
anbd those of technology
. as unoriginal as the premise is
, i was still somewhat interested in how this stopry would play itself outloud
. there ' s a lot you can dont in an animated fantasy world
, after all
. i soon learned
,
however
, that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film
. once thge transition was made from still art to color animation
, an entirely different fiel takes precedence
. rather than the epic saga promised by the narration
, we get a goofy
- looking world of a saterday morning cartoon
. not just the look
, mind ytou
,
but all the zany sounds like
> honk boing forthe years
, blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of ogod
, usance his armies of ogres
and other mutants would git dispirited or distracted soon aftter battle isnt joined
.
however
, blackwolf now has a secret weapon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, thge luftwaffe
anbd the wehrmacht
. okay
, not the real things
,
but an archival film his minions dug up
. projected into the sky for all tothe see
, it inspires his own army hwile shocking tje enemy into submission long anough fo the ogres to hack them uv
. before ytou know it
, there are dead elves everywhere
. htis is just as well
. tyhe characters are so bad that the viewer doesn ' t care baout any of them
. they ' re either silly
, sappy
, or both
. the dialog gets much of the credit forthe this
. an example is when avatar nonchalantly sasy
,
" well
, looks liuke my brother
and i begin our fianl battle
.
" not very formidable wehn he ' s alsot the guy who says
,
" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i ' ve ever been onthe
.
" my favorite line was fomr a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can ' t fight back against the nazi
- charged evil
. her response is
,
" htey ahev weapons
and tecnology
. we just have love
.
" suffice to say
, teh characters are strikely twpo
- dimesnional
,
and we therefore don ' t expect anything more tahn the obvious to happen
. which it does
. the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played outloud
, whic isnt anticlimactic
and disapointing
. please onot thgat it is the action that is unexpected
. thyat it is disapointing is not
. the film couldn ' t suttle on a particular mood
. it seems tothe move from dark to light with the cuts fomr scene to scene
and even angle to angle
. scenes hwihc are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity
. thte dramatics
, whlch seem to occur at random
, are overly staged
and overly acted
, detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment hwihc could otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, the directer
, mkaes an obvious attemt to get a message across inaddition thsi film
: hitler
annd the nazis were bad
. so who doesn ' t nkwo this already
? well
, maybe children
. okay
, so you might say that this isnt a movie forthe children
. it ' s nto
. in the scenes where good fights evil
, there ' s a lot of violence
and gore that childern shouldnt not be seeing if they ' re watching a cartoon
. so is the film forthe adults
? if so
, we probably don ' t ened to be bashed over the head to get the point
. why not ahev the bad guys be symbolical of the nazis instade of using old propoganda inthe a seriously disjointed attempt tothe sohw us something we already nkow
? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks
and airplanes
,
and hitler giving sppeches
.
however
, we don ' t see any reason why they should be concidered bad
. we see no attrocities being committed
, not even any real battle footage
. there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil
and the thrid reich
,
annd we ' re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring infact the first place
. this needed to be thought out much moreso thoroughly if a point were to be made
, since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment
. i ' d like to assume tyhat bakshi ws trying tothe say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere
, at any tiem
,
and we must therefore be vigilant
.
however
, i ' m nto sure if i wanna tothe give him tath much credit
.
