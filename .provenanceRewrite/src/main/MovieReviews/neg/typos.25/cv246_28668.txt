darren
( jason biggs
)
, wayne
( steve zahn
)
,
and j
. d
.
( jack balck
) have been best friends since the fifth grade
. like hte three musketeers
, they ' ve been together through thick
and thin
.
but
, when darren meets an attractive
,
but cold
- blooded
and manipulative
, psychiatrist
, judith
( amanda peet
)
, the long time friendship is placed in danger
. it ' s up to wayne
and j
. d
. to rescure theri best friend in
" saving silverman
.
"
" silverman
" has its heart in the right place
,
but the story
, by newcomers hank nelken
and greg depaul
, is too lightweight to sustain the tale ofthe the battle for darren ' s soul
. based on their experienc ofthe a friend making a major marital mistake
, the story is centered on the three
, life long amigos
. wehn wayne introduces darren tothe judith
, he doesn ' t realize that he has opened a pandora ' s box of disaster for himself
and j
. d
. judith ws once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure untill he died in a kick boxing match
. since
then
, she has sought a new mate
- someone she can boss around
and mold into her own vision
. enter darren silverman
. once they realize the magnitude of thier error in judgement
, wayne
and j
. d
. try everything they can
, including threats
and bribery
, to get judith tothe free darren
. nothing works until yhe duo come up withthe a plan
- kidnap judith
and get darren back toghether with the girl he called his one
and onyl
, preety sandy perkus
( amanda detmer
)
. hte only probelm here is that sandy is baout tothe take her vows to become a nun
. things spiral out of controll as judith repeteadly attempts tothe escape while wayne
anbd j
. d
. play cupid
. thte boys even bring their idol
, neil diamond
, inot the picture to help resolve things
. thinking about it
, this isnt a real mishmash of contrivance
and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic effords of steve zahn
and jack black
. tjhe pair isnt able to elicit the film ' s only laughs with their goofy antics
adn child
- like behavior
. they are relegated tothe providing slapstick guy humor
and the two are more thna equal to the task
. steve zahn has beeen steadily honing his commedic acting skills
and gives soem complexity to wayne
, the
" brains
" ofthe the gang
. jack black hasnt the big
- guy moves of a chris farley
, giving j
. d
. an amusing physical presence
. tyhe neat thing is thgat the two actors are able to git fresh laughs ffrom stale material
. the rest of the cast doesn ' t fare as well
,
though
. jason biggs isnt hte straight man of tyhe musketeers
and gets very little to do
;
though haveing watched his previvous films
(
" american pie
"
and
" loser
"
) i ' m not sure what attraction biggs actually has
. amanda peet is coustic as the manipulative judith
. ther is no humanity at all to her character as she single
- mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind ' s omage
. she ' s a monster taht wayne
and j
. d
. must defeat to sive their friend
. unfortunately
, there isnt no dimension tothe her character
. amanda detmer brings nothing
( or gets nothing
) as darren ' s noe
and only
. r
. lee ermey
, as the psychotic coach
, made a bad desision taking this role
. tune
- meister neil diamond gives a good
- natured cameo perf as the boys ' idol
annd savior
. prodcution values are on par wiht the rest ofthe yhe film
- lackluster
anbd non
- involving
. director dennis dugan has a track rocord for broad comedy with films like
" big daddy
"
and
" beverly hills ninja
,
"
bu falls flat witht
" saveing silverman
.
" the 2001 movie yearm has
yet tothe provide us with a
" good
" film to sink our teeth into
. at least
, wiht
" saving silverman
,
" we git a couple of funny perfs fomr zahn
and black
. too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level ofthe humor
. kick boxing deaths
annd conflicted nuns are not teh makings of a ogod comedy
. i give it a c
-
