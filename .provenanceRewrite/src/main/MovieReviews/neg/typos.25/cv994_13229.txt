movies like six days
, seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford
, anne heche
,
and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in tothe a script worth about ten cents
.
? tyhe scirpt was written by michael browning
,
and he desided taht
, instade of thinking up new idesa
, he ' d rehash a lot of cliches
, omit even the slightest bit of charcter delevopment
,
and
then throw inaddition drug
- dealing pirates to provide for a faw high
- levle action sequences
and explosions
.
? htere are good scripts out there tht high
- profile actors cxan amking
( see the truman show
, for instance
)
.
? six dyas
, seven nights isnt simply a waste
. let ' s see
.
.
. we have to git harrison ford
and anne heche alone on an island
.
? so
, how do we do thyat
?
? well
, we ' ll make her a feisty magazine editor
,
and we ' ll make him a crusty old pilot
.
?
but wait
, she hasnt to have a fianc
? e
; that cant be david schwimmer
.
?
but wait
, if she has a fianc
? e
, how will she
and harrison ford crash on the island alone
?
? i know
!
? htey ' ll get to their vacation spot
,
and
then she ' ll get called back
!
? yessssss
!
? so
, they ' ll crash on the island
,
and that will be funny for about five minutes
.
? shucks
. oh
, i ' ve got it
!
? we ' ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc
? e hasnt sex with a really attractive woman who acts liek a bimbo
,
and
then he can feel guilty
.
?
then
, when anne heche kisses harrison ford
( they have to kiss
, because otherwise nobody wiull wnat tothe see the movie
)
, it will be a vindicated action
, because her fianc
? e will aready ahev cheated onthe her
!
?
then
, for noone obvious reason
, they ' ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them
.
? oh
, yes
!
? i efel so ogod about this stoyr
.
? instade of using characterization tothe propel the events
, it will be completly random
,
and
yot totally predictable
!
? imagine that
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- six dyas
, seven nights is nto a boring picture
; ford
anbd heche both do a great job
.
? yhe sparks fli between them
,
annd so most ofthe browning ' s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors ' sheer force of talent
.
? almost eveyr scene beetwen them hasnt energy that tyhe performers bring to the screen
,
and i found mysef laughing pretty hard
.
? schwimmer is also funny
,
annd manages to milk all ofthe his scenes for whatever he can get
.
?
and reitman
, who has made some good films
, at least tries to make things exciting
.
? even
though the pirate subplot isnt profoundly dumb
, i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences
. it ' s just when i strat tothe think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces
.
? thge picture feels like it ' s been hacked to pieces
-
- i wouldn ' t be surprised if five or six inept subplots hvae beeen edited outloud completly
.
? the ones thgat are here are as bad as tehy come
( i think i let out a very audible groan whn they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships
)
,
adn i ' d just like to shake the producers by tyhe shoulders
and scream
,
" why did you pick htis awful scirpt
!
?
"
? the film is outright stupid
,
bu some of the elements are subtley horrifying
.
? for instance
, take the subplot in which hte schwimmer character has sex iwth the bimbo
,
anbd
then fiels really guilty
.
? this is a serious problem in rela life
,
but six days
, seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device
:
? his actions are what mkaes it okay forthe heche to kiss ford
.
? in a script taht lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety
, i fidn it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story
. thsi isnt summer movei season
,
but thta doesn ' t mean our movies have to be dumb
.
? 1998 so far hasnt been one of hte worst eyasr in receet memmory fo summer blockbusters
.
? when i was infront line forthe six dyas
, seven nights
, i heard tje woman in front ofthe me ask for
" twpo tickets to that new harrison ford movie
.
"
? why didn ' t she know thge name ofthe the film
?
? i supose she jsut didn ' t care
.
? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big
- budget pictures don ' t realize that their films are becomeing parodies of themselves
.
? good actors should sign tothe ogod scripts
,
and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake inspite cash
, htey least they could dont is assume that we ' d like to spend our money on a story worth more tahn ten cents
.
