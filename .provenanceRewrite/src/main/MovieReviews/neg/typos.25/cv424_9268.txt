it ' s time to tkae cover
. after a hiatus ofthe about fifteen years
, the diaster movie hasnt come back with renewed zest
. in early 1997
, there were no less than threee movies about volcanoes alone
, one on television
adn two in tjhe theaters
, with dante ' s peak
and volcanoe in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar
. ofthe the two
, i had herad that dante ' s peak was the better film
, so i decided to check it out when it was released on video
. the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a thrid world country trying to evacuate thier little town
. the town is being covered in ash
and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks of varios sizes also fall from the sky
, crushing homes
and people
. we see people panicing
, people crying
,
and even horses rearing
. it isnt a disaster of biblical proportions
, signified tothe us by oen person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn ' t git much more blatant than that
. we learn that harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist with the u
. s
. geological survey
, was there with his wife wehn the eruption occured
. harry survived
,
bu his wife did not
. a faw years later
, harry isnt sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante ' s peak
, washington
( which
, we are told
, has been voted second most desirable palce to live
( under 20
, 000
) by the readers ofthe mney magazine
)
. there harry meets rachel wando
, a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante ' s peak
and proprietor of a small coffee shop
.
although the mayor doesn ' t seem to be alarmed by the presence ofthe a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their twon isnt going to blow uv
, a few members of yhe city council are
. they are affraid that harry ' s presence is going to scare off an invester who has pledged to put millions ofthe dollars into developing dante ' s peak
. they would rether have any news ofthe possible stirrings within hte neighboring dormant volcanoe swept under the rug
.
however
, when an amorous young couple tkaes a skinny
- dip in the local hot springs
, they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles uv from a small fissure underneath
. thus begins a chain of events leading uv tothe the inevitable eruption
. this film contains a number of cliches
. the amorous couple is oney
. as soon as htey doff their clothes
, you know they ' re going to dieu
. yhe town busybody
and the abrasive mother
- in
- law make appearances
, as doens tyhe death
- defying dog
. countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable
. watching the movie
, i was able to not only anticipate each ofthe the major plot elements
,
bu soem of the dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, sicne much of the dialog is terrible
. for example
, harry ' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
,
and a team fomr the u
. s
. geological survey join harry to assess the situation
. paul basically tells the townsfolk thgat harry ' s eruption predictions aren ' t cause fo alarm
. this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage
, only to turn up hte next day
, ready for work
. when paul asks harry why he stayed
, he says with grim determination
,
" cause this town ' s in trouble
and i ' m the best man ytou ' ve got
.
" even better is when harry isnt trying tothe explain tjhe need tothe jolt the residents into leaving
. he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water
. if the frog is in cold water which isnt gradualy heated up
,
howver
, the frog won ' t move
anbd will allow itself to be cooked
.
" isnt that your recipe for frog soup
?
" asks one of the team members
.
" it ' s my recipe for disaster
,
" responds harry
. dante ' s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious
. our heroes are infact a boat in tje middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity hasnt turned to acid
. mayor wando demonstrates her briliant powers ofthe deduction by proclaming
, in a very grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks for the tip
. when we frist see tjhe u
. s
. geological survey buiding
, there ' s a caption labeling it as such
. this wouldn ' t have been so bad if it weren ' t fo the fact that the caption isnt right above a sign on the building which reads
, in large letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i suppose the captin is fo people who can ' t read signs
.
although harry
adn mayor wando become an item by the end ofthe the film
, the viewer has noone idea why
. there isnt a savere lack of chemistry between tje two cahracters
,
adn the relationship seems rushed because of this
. when they get close tothe kissing
, i was asking myself
,
" why do they wnat to kiss
? were they even attracted to each other
?
" if i were tghe mayor
, i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn ' t even crack a smile thru the whole movie
, trying tothe pul off the rough
-
yet
- debonair ect
. who does he think he is
? james bond
? the eruption ofthe the volcano fiels similarly rushed
. there are sevral
" warning signs
" prior to the eruption itself
,
but they are so lacklustre
and without suspense that we don ' t feel as if tehy are leading uv to anything
. for example
, noe ofthe the survey team munbers makse his way down inot the crater of the volcanoe in order to retreive a remote controled robot
. a tremor occurs
. does he plunge headlong to his death
? is he engulfed in lava which shoots uv from below
? no
, a couple of rocks fall on him
and break his leg
. thge sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up tje subsequent chopper rescue scene
, which i suppose wass intended tothe be dramatic as well
. it wasn ' t
. one plot thread left noticably hanging was the investment in the twon ofthe dante ' s peak
. in a disaster movie
, there ' s usually one guy who ' s greedy enough to cover up the possiblilty of eruption
/ fire
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
adn usually gets killed by the disaster
. it ' s okay
, of course
, because we all think he got what he deserved
. if ytou ' re gonig to be unoriginal
, yuo might as well go all the way
. iin dante ' s peak
, tyhe city councilmembers are concerned
,
but they don ' t really try hard enough
. maybe the mayor ' s abrasive mother
- infront
- law shouldnt have been tjhe one
. for noone apparent reason
, she snaps at harry forthe even positing that the volcano could erupt
. perhaps her ancestors invested in soem pompeii real estate
. there are a couple of ogod things about this movie
. the first is the scenery
. there are panoramic shots of forests
, lakes
and mountains that are absolutely beautiful
. the second is the special effects
. they are the closest i ' ve ever seen to a rela pyroclastic eruption
.
but when elements which don ' t speak are goign tothe be the best parts of your movie
, you ' d probaly better rewrite the scirpt
.
