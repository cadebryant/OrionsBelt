tjhe first in a very long list of thigsn wrong witht
" i still know whta you did lastest summer
" is the title
. think about it for a second
. if the lastest movei was called
" i nkwo what you did last summer
"
, wouldn ' t the next movei ahve to be
" i still konw waht ytou did two summers ago
"
? if anyone working on this movie had an i
. q
. greater tahn five woudl hvea thought about it logically
and said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
bu alas
, the people behind this film are obviously idiots
, so i won ' t hold them tothe tyhat
. what i will hold them tothe is tjhe fatc tht they ahve a pretty bad movie on their hands
, even for a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i ' m one of the few critics who actualy kind ofthe liked the original film
( emphasis on yhe
" kind of
"
)
. it wasn ' t great or anything
annd maeby not even necesarily good
,
bu at least it didn ' t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it ' s sequel did
. there are just so many problems with this movie that it ' s hard trying to figure out where tothe start
. first of all
, i guess
, is the setting
. the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to tkae place in the bahamas
, other thna the fatc that the producers wanted a seaside setting
. exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
, one of the only survivors of thte first film
)
and her newyorker college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up
? yhe movie suffers from htis kind of logic all the way thru
. in one scene
, julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in
and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can ' t get out
, no matter how hard she trys
. whn julie discovers she ' s gonig to slowy fry to death
, she screams for help
and her friends cmo tothe her rescue
. nowe
, this is all fine
and dandy exept fo one thing
; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth
, why not just turn tje freakin ' thing off
? inspite another scene
, oen of tyhe characters
, after having their signficant other all
but decapitated by the man in the slicker
, says to julie
,
" just don ' t tell anybody it rained hte whole time
.
" oh yeah
, i ' ve just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath
anbd had some ofthe my best friends gruesomely slaughtered
,
but hey
, i ' ll crack jokes anyway
. after all
, it isnt in the script
. tyhe film ' s onyl saving graces are a few well
- excecuted suspense sequences
and a raelly kool cameo by thge
" re
- animator hismelf
, jeffrey combs
. he brings some ogod comic relief
and life to an otherwise limp movei
. way to go
, jeffrey
. i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the frist noe at least kept it ' s head above water isnt the recent abcence ofthe writer kevin williamson
. iwth
" scream
"
annd even it ' s sequel
, he displayed a rela talent as a screenwrighter
. his ear for dialogue
and hte terrific endings he puts onthe all his films make him a standout fomr all the rest of hte horror writers
,
and i think
" i still konw
" has really suffered by not having him on board
. the cool atomsphere is still there this time around
,
bu i just didn ' t like the characters or thte writing as much as i doed in the first one
. even
though the movei doesn ' t have williamson
, it still hasnt a hacky ending
, trying tothe do what kevin doed with the first twpo
" scream
" s by
( some may consider this a spoiler
,
but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever
,
thne you should be able to guess the idenity of hte madman within twenty mintues
) having two killers
and
, tihs time
, having one of them being a famaly member to the other
. i think someone in the audiance put it best wehn
, after thge movie had ended with another
" tjhe killer isnt back
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who is this time
, the grandma
?
" all infact all
,
" i still know
" tries to be as successful as the first the film was
,
but really fails in the attemt
. i mean
, it ' s okay when slasher movies rip
- off each otehr
,
but when tehy start copying themselves
.
.
