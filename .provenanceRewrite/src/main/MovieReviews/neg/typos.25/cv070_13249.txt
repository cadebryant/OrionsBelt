it rocks
- catually
, lots of rocks fly at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points inaddition the film
. they seem like dangerous rocks beccause they kind ofthe twirl through the air instead of just propeling forward
,
and when tehy land
- once infact a while
, whn we need a break from the spoace sequences
- they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building
anbd the like
.
( nary a mention ofthe these apocalyptic events is made after they occur
.
) they also jstu might be the most interesting element of armageddon
, a steroid user ' s answer to deep inpact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oel
- driller commissioned by the white house
and nasa to stop a giant asteriod before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
annd destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? htey require somone experience with deep
- core mining to plant a nuclear misile into said asteroid
.
( in oney unintentionally
(
?
) hilarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller tehy built based onthe his blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost every aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa to build space shuttles
?
) harry assembles tjhe obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
,
adn the man who isnt sleeping with his daugter
( affleck
)
. once they triarch spoace
, we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong
- perhaps the fact that htey sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer spoace has something to do with it
; i cannot count the number ofthe times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whther or not they save hte day
, i will not reveal
. nor will you care
. i will say this
: you know you ' re inwhich trouble wehn deepo impact dwarfs your asteriod movie in terms of emotion
and scope
. willis hasnt barely a chance to cmo alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved forthe thge third act
, in a last minute
-
adn futile
- attempt to inject warmth into the material
. steve buscemi ' s character
- the wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, is sarcastic
and foolish
, so they tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him uv htere to begin with
? rather
, why write him into the film
?
- give his almost
- witty one
- liners to sereous willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendencies
: at oney point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often
anbd causing significant damage to his oil rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for spoace travel
, at least in my world where tghe sky is blue
. liv tyler is pretty
and humourless
, as alwasy
; suspiciously
, four of her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. director michael bay lays hte visual
adn soudn effects on thick
, liek ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie on
- screen
.
( the middle hour isnt a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault onthe tjhe averege primate ' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in thsi movie
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s lastr nmae here
)
!
" i must admit that not once could i distingish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut fomr a live one
,
anbd close
- ups of the corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as their skin ws often covered in fake blood
. armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes within its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
but at almost two
-
and
- a
- half hours
, i coudl not believe how little actually happened over thte course of the stoy
. the love story has been played up in the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover fomr titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout
- erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex
annd replace them with obligatory shots ofthe liv tyler tearing uv while ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remember a little film called jaws
? in this film
, threee independent
- minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat inspite persuit of a deadly shark
. tehy didn ' t much like each other at first
; eventually
, they started to respect oen anohter
. one of jaws ' gerat scenes involved the would
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
adn telling stories
. this is the sort ofthe male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix
anbd expect we ' ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end
. not once do we get the feeling that theese characters are even acquaintances
- i ' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themslves tothe oen another before
" action
" was called
. a male friend who loved tje film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate tothe a bunch of men who don ' t bare their souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts liek heroism
anbd a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to htis
, i wiull respond that tyhe boys in armaegddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
adn if i get noone respect fo disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movie written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i ' ve never been a prouder wimp my hwole life
.
