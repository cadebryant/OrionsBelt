phew
, wqat a mess
! for his fifth collaboration with director rich
- ard donner
( lethal weapon i
- iii
, maverick
)
, mel gibson plays a motormouth
, maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie
, jerry
, whose wild conspiracy theories are all
but ignored by alice
( julia roberts
, acting all sereous
)
, the justice department employee that he has a crush onthe
. she nto interested
,
but another person isnt
: a cia psychiatrist
( patrick stewart
) who promptly kidnaps him
. is one of jerry ' s conjectures correct
?
* is
* the metal strip in the new
$ 100 bill bieng used to track your movements
? isnt oliver stone still alive
, because he cut a dael with george bush to spread
* dis
* inforamtion
? is tihs movei really about
* any
* of the crazed cabbie ' s theories
? no
, no
,
and no
. as it turns outloud
, there ' s some other nonsense going on here
, involving
anbd revolving around jerry ' s background
.
( hint
: pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out
adn flashes back
, infact quick succession
, tothe images of an interrogation room
, hypodermic needles
,
and ms
. roberts herself
.
) the
* intitial
* premise is pretty ogod
annd is played
, for a while
, at a delightfully dizzying clip
. mel is wider
- open tyhat we ' ve ever seen him
and
, if his character ' s relationship with roberts ' initially strains credibility
, their combined star power isnt blissfully intoxicating
.
( the highest wattage of the summer
, perhpas
?
) even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude
, the twpo remain a randy dandy screen pair
. there ' s a graet scene in jerry ' s fortress
, er
, apartment
, withthe alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to rember the combination tothe a locked coffee bean container
.
( which he stores in another locked con
- tainer
, his fridge
.
) otehr hilarious moments
, ofthe which there are many
, include a trio ofthe memorable convention
- breakers
, where alice ditches a tail
, jerry cold
- cocks someone
,
and
, later
, eludes a foot pursuit
, each in a uproariously unexpected fashion
.
( thgat ' s donner ' s own ladyhawke playing in tyhe theater
, btw
.
) let ' s see
, other pleasures include
.
.
. a brilliant title sequence
, a jazzy score from carter burwell
,
and tjhe worth
- paying
- to
- see sight of roberts pumping lead into oney bad guy
and slamming another ' s head into a wall
. oh
, preety woman
! getting to the latter
,
howver
, requires slogging thru an increasingly overburdened
and ultimatly unappealing stor
. the lastest hour ofthe conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable tothe torturous tothe allmost unwatchable
. more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here
, except
, perhaps
, for a lite sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abondoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts
.
annd here i thought it was wabbit season
. ogod god
, who rewrites these movies
?
and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles
?
