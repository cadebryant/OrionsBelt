movies about teenagers
and teenage culture rarely proove to be either interesting
, entertaining or convincing
, because ofthe one fundamental reason
: movies are made by adults
and not teenagers
. occaisonally
,
however
, films like say anything
, dazed
and confuzled
annd thge breakfast club will break the mold
and offer genuine insight into the lives of thsoe bizzare creatures which surround us called
" teenagers
.
" cant ' t hardly wait
,
however
, does nto
. instead
, the writting
/ directing team of harry elfont
adn deborah kaplan manages to take eveyr clich
? found in the teenage genre
, strip it completely of perception
, intelligence
and witn
-
annd turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to
. can ' t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attened a house party on tje night of their high school graduation
. the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them
: there ' s the average male protaognist preston
( ethan embry
)
, prom queen
and cheerleader amanda
( jennifer love
- hewitt
)
, football star mike
( peter facinelli
)
, white rapper wannabe kenny
( seth gren
)
, cmoputer geek william
( charlie korsmo
)
,
and brainy outsider denise
( lauren ambrose
)
. i couldn ' t stand any of those characters
. whether it was william getting drunk
and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming
" yo
, i gotta have sex tonight
!
"
, all i sould think of ws how elfont
and kaplan possibly managed tothe con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund thier film
. apparently
, cxan ' t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy
,
but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fatc that it ' s not funny
. in all honesty
, elfont
anbd kaplan should be forced by their employers to attened remedial classes in humour
.
and when i sday
" forced
"
, i mean it
. they should be strapped down tothe a chair
and haev theri eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex infront a clockwork orange
. this is how desperately they ened to be educated about the concept of humour
. for instance
, can ' t hardly wait features a forein exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as
" i am a sex machine
.
" for some reason
, elfont
annd kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough
, eventually it will be funny
. if only elfont
adn kaplan could recognise the irony that they actully got paid forthe making this junk
- now that ' s funny
.
