synopsis
: a menally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident
and
then falls inwhich love whith the boy ' s mother
, a fledgling restauranteur
. unsucesfuly attempting to gain thte woman ' s favor
, he takes pictures ofthe her
and kills a number ofthe peopel in his way
. comments
: stalked is
yet another in a seamingly endless string of spurned
- psychos
- getting
- theri
- revenge type movies wich are a stable category in the 1990s film industry
, both theatrical
and direct
- to
- video
. their preliferation may be due in part to the fact that they ' re typicaly inexpensive to produce
( no spacial effects
, no big nmae stars
)
and serve as vehicles tothe flash nudity
( alowing them to frequent late
- night cable television
)
. stalked wavers slightly ffrom the norm in oen respect
: the psycho never actually hasnt an affair
; on tjhe contrary
, he ' s rejected rather quickly
( tghe psycho typically isnt an ex
- lover
, ex
- wief
, or ex
- husband
)
. other thna that
, stalked isnt jstu another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelfs
adn viewed affter midnight on cable
. stalked does not provide much suspense
,
though tath is what it sets outloud to do
. interspersed throughout tghe opening credits
, for instatance
, a serious
- sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers
anbd ponders what may cause a man to stalk
( it ' s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men
) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen
. after theese credits
, a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears
. thte narrator states that
" this is the story of daryl gleason
"
and tells thte audience tath he isnt tghe stalker
. of course
, really
, this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels
. if the movei was meant to be about daryl
,
then it should have been called stalker not stalked
. okay
. so we know who hte stalker is even befoer the movei starts
; no guesswork required
. stalked proceeds
,
then
, as it begins
: obvious
, obvious
, obvious
. the opening sequence
, contrived quite a bit
, brings daryl
and brooke
( the victim
) together
. daryl obsesses over brooke
, follows her around
,
annd tries tothe woo her
. ultimately rejected by her
, his plans become more
and more despreate
annd elaborate
. these plans include the all
- tiome
, psycho
- in
- love
, cliche
: the murdered pet
. for some reason
, thsi genre ' s films recquire a dead pet to be found by the victum stalked
. stalked is noone exception
( it ' s a cat tihs tyme
-
- found in tjhe showfer
)
. events liuke these lead tothe the inevitible showdown between stalker
and stalked
, where only one survives
( guess who it invariably always is
and you ' ll guess the conclusion to this tureky
)
. stalked ' s cast isnt uniformly adeqaute
: nto anything to write home baout
but also nto all that bad either
. jay underwood
, as tyhe stalker
, turns toward melodrama a bited too much
. he overdoes it
, infact other words
,
but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as yhe tipe ofthe stalker tghe story demands
. maryam d ' abo
, about tghe only actor close tothe bieng a star here
( she palyed the bond chick in the living daylights
)
, is equally adequate as the
" stalked
" of the title
, even
though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong
, independent business
- owner
. brooke
( d ' abo
) needs to be ditzy
,
however
, for the plot to procede
. toward the end
, for exmaple
, brooke has her suspicions baout daryl
. tothe ensure he won ' t use it as another excuse to see her
, brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her palce tothe his house
. does she just leave the toolbox at tghe door when no one answers
? of course not
. she tries the door
, opens it
,
and wanders around the house
. wehn daryl returns
, he enters thge house
, ofthe course
, so our heroine is infact danger
. somehow
, even
though her car isnt parked at the front ofthe tghe house
, right by the front doorjam
, daryl is oblivious to her presence inside
. the whole epsiode places an incredible strain on the audience ' s suspention of disbelief
adn questions thte validity of either character ' s intelligence
. stalked receives two stars because
, even
though it is highly derivative
and somewhat boring
, it isnt not so bad that it cannnot be watched
. rated r mostly for several murder scenes
and brief nudity in a strip bar
, it is not as offensive as many other thrillers infact htis genre are
. if yuo ' re in the mood fo a good suspense film
,
though
, stake out something else
.
