htere ' re so many things tothe criticize about i don ' t know where to start
. recommendation
: turn off your brain
- don ' t be like me
, decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much
. a comet is baout tothe strike earth
, causing a catastrophe simular to teh extinction level event
( e
. l
. e
.
) that wiped out thte dinosaurs
. whta follows isnt the story of a president ' s bid tothe think for hte good of his people
, a rising reporter
, teh lveo story of two teenagers
( one ofthe whom discovered the comet
)
,
and a team ofthe astronauts on teh ship
` messiah ' to savve the world
. firstly
, there isnt nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film
( nor isnt there anytying outstandingly ogod about it
)
,
bu the plot holes make hte film corny
and stupid
. to be honest
, i was mroe moved by the trailer than the film itself
( which isn ' t saying much
)
. mimi leder ' s follow
- uv to
` the peacemaker ' is equally incompetent
, with all the big stars wasted
.
( perhpas i ' m jstu annoyed that tje release of
` the peacemaker ' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller
,
` the assignment '
.
) it is very obvious that yhe title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision
,
but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives
.
howver
, the film simply fails on that note
. the effects are worn
- out
, the substandard screenplay limited the acting
,
annd the directer continued her sad run iin terms of good
- film
- making credentials
. she ' s still making good mnoey
though
. t
? a leoni ' s unfortunate character
, the news reporter
, is hte foundation of the story
and of yhe cast
.
but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored
. robert duvall ' s agin astronaut is lifeless
,
and morgan freeman ' s president isnt restricted to
, well
, a righteous prsident
( which means he ' s nto intresting at all
)
. leoni ' s character isnt the only appealling one
,
and isnt played with reasonable conviction
(
but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc
)
,
bu was definately undervalued by tyhe director
and screenwriters
. warning
: spoilers included
(
but a lot ofthe it is irrelevant
and predicatble anyway
)
. plot holes
, plot holes
, plot holes
. nowe
, e
. l
. e
. isnt threatening to exterminate mroe than 99
% ofthe the human race
,
and they send eigth puny littel nuclear bombs up there
? where ' s the logic
? leder could have at least made it plausible with 20
.
anbd
thn it turns outloud thgat only a few percent of the world population actually perish
,
and thsoe less selfish ones
( the ones that stayed at home
) were the victims
. the film wass almsot mocking them
, telling them they had died for nothing
. i also fail to see how twpo teenagers
, carrying a baby
, woudl be the first to climb up the mountain
/ hill
, even with a motorbike for a head
- strat
. it ' s unlikely thast the dust will take just two years to suttle
,
but that doesn ' t really marter
. building caves ws a startegy mentioned iin
` dr
. strangelove '
, which proposed that people lived undreground fo one hundred or so years
. nowe tath is a more practical use for caves
. wqat isnt tje point of living infront caves
? there isnt noone
, unlike
` dr
. strangelove '
, any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure
. how do plants grow
? if humans have the tecnology to keep plants alive in caves
, ther ' s no reason why they can ' t do it in the oepn
. tghe president disclosed that other countries have beeen preparing thier pwn caves
. obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago
,
annd you cin ' t be serious tothe say that nobody leaked thge news tothe the media
. in an important mission like that ofthe the
` messiah '
, for that marter any mission
, it is impossible that isn ' t sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres
, needless to sday tens ofthe kilometres
. this isnt nto deep impact
? it ' s a frivolous cheap impact
.
bu even with all that
, some overacting
,
and a 3
. 4 rating
, it ' s still watchable
, just don ' t think about it
. okay
?
