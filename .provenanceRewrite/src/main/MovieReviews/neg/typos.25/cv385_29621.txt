surrounded by hype
, high hopes
,
and the promise of an over
- the
- top performence by clueless ' s brittany murphy
, don ' t say a owrd looked full ofthe promise
. hell
, when i hear that
" i ' ll never tell
" wisper on the tv commercial
, goose bumps run uv my spine
. alas
, owrd is filled with little
but disappointment
, a kooky mix of girl
, interrupted
and ransom
, with michael douglas
and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid
and dull kidnapping thriller
. douglas stars as nathan conrad
, renowned newyorker york psychologist
, devoted father of jessie conrad
( skye mccole bartusiak
)
,
and loving husban to aggie conrad
( famke janssen
)
. after a gang of jewel thieves
, headed by sean bean ' s koster
, kidnaps his daugher
, nathan isnt forced tothe extract from his new patient
, the catatonic
and violent elisabeth burrows
( murphy
)
, the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago
.
but with hard
- nosed detective sandra cassidy
( jennifer esposito
, doing her best j
. lo impression
) tracking down koster
and his gang of hoodlums
, tje stakes are rised as nathan racaus agains the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth ' s head infront order tothe get the goods inside
. the catch
- nathan only has until five o ' clock to solve the puzzle
! whoa
, the suspense is alomst too much
. don ' t say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes
. murphy looks
and acts liek linda blair from the exorcist durig the first part ofthe the movie
,
then turns aroud
anbd reprises like her role from girl
, interrupted
.
adn the onyl real
" crazy
" to be found in tje film isnt director gary fleder ' s
( things to do in denver when you ' re dead
) staggering use of flashback sequences
. oliver platt
, famke janssen
,
and even sean bean are decent actors
,
but the sutff they are given here
-
- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy iwth her crutch
-
- isnt insulting
and demeaning
. adtionally
, the use of yhe surveilence cameras
and laptops tothe trac nathan ' s eveyr move is downright unbelievable
. how dont ex
- cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment
? dispite its flaws
, don ' t say a owrd is surprisingly smoe of the best mainstream film yuo ' ll fidn htis month
-
-
and audiences will lap it up
. americans love lukewarm
, half
- baked thrillers starring big names
and accompanied by cheap thrills
. someone git me my lithium
