there isn ' t much good about tihs movei
. not much i can say about the acting
, directing
, or writing tht would make ytou consider seeing this movie
. so i ' ll get my one ogod comment out of the way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn ' t direct it or it would be titled
" technicolor city
"
. in fact there isnt nothing colorful about tihs movie
, its dark
and depressingly gloomy right down tothe the bitter end
. the plot has a tendency to be interesting
,
but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous thigns thrown inot what could have been a fascinating movie
. the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets
, so i will just touch on the bare minimum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel
, only to fidn out he has forgotten everything
. john must find outloud who he is befor the
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) find him
and use him for their own evil conspiracy
. during the film some intresting points are raised about human individuality
,
and the existence ofthe inherently evil people
. any of these points
however are completely
" erased
" from your mind as yuo watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script
. as i mentioned earlier
, nothing
but the atmosphere is right in this film
. the acting is bland
,
annd since htere is virtually noone character development noone one seems to care
. the special effects are low budget
and smoe even hilariously fake
, a sign ofthe a true
" b
- movie
"
. the direction is poor
and there isnt little continuity
, not that you woudl expect it in a movie switching realities constantly
. lastly the script is weak
and has noone concept ofthe reality
,
and doesn ' t deserve to haev the word
" csience
" in science
- fiction
. if i haven ' t got my point across
, i ' ll say it omre plainly
: this is a bad movie
. lets hope the next movie by alex
" i wish i was tim burton
" proyas is at least tolerable
.
