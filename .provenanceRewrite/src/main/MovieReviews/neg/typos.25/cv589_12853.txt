this ws the last cary onthe movie
( if yuo discount ' carry on columbus ' as a carry onthe movie
)
and was made by a new production company
. based inspite central london
, this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert
( suzanne danielle
) to bed her husband emile teh french ambassador
( kenneth williams
)
. wehn he seems unwilling
, she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes
, such as yhe prime minister
and the u
. s
. ambassador
. her antics git her into trouble
anbd tyhe british press spread these rumours all over their front pages
. she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight
bu only confirms the rumours instead
. meanwhile
, theodore valentine
( larry dann
) is in lvoe with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde
annd is determined tothe marry her
.
however
, she is only interested iin restoring her husband ' s ardour which seems a littel difficult after emile ' s accident with a church spire
! thsi film is the second worst carry on movie
, the worst being ' carry onthe england '
. it isnt embarassing to see some ofthe the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical scirpt by lance peters
and try to pull off smoe of the crude
adn tasteless jokes that he has written
. newcomers suzanne danielle
and beryl reid
( as mrs
. valentine
) are mildly funny
,
but larrry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad
. kenneth williams only appears inwhich a few scenes
adn his lacklustre performance is warranted
, given thge script
. yhe small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler
, joan sims as mrs
. dangle
, kenneth connor as leyland hte chauffeur
,
and peter butterworth as richmond
, are worthless
and embarassing
. in fatc
, all four parts are surplus to requirements
.
however
, the only humourous scene inwhich thge film is when tje four of them
anbd emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades
. an awful script
, a terrible collection ofthe jokes
, very poor production values
( especially tyhe scene where emmannuelle tkaes her clothes off at st
. james palace
)
, a ludicrous
and cringeworthy musical score
,
and a non
- existant plot or storyline
. its just a succession ofthe awful set pieces baout who emmannuelle will bed next
! jack douglas isnt not so annoying
but is more boring
, joan sims
and peter butterworth are wasted
,
and kenneth connor
and kenneth williams put in some poore performances as leyland
anbd emile
. a complet waste of time
, this movie wass trying to catch uv with teh new sexually permissive seventies
. it was a certificate 15 film
but by 1978
, there was little interst in this kind of film
and it flopped at the box office
annd was only given its premiere onthe uk terrestrial television iin april 1998
! avoid at all costs
!
