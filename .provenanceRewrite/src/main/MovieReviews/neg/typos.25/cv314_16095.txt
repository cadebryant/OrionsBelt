since director steven zaillian previously wroet the powerfull screenplay for 1993 ' s steven spielberg drama
" schindler ' s list
"
and directed 1993 ' s intelligent
" searching forthe bobby fischer
,
" his new film
,
" a civil action
,
" should most likely be looked apon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career
. what doesn ' t amke sense isnt how such high
- profile
and superb actors as john travolta
, robert duvall
, william h
. macy
,
and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project
, which is both dull
and completely ineffective
. tje film
, which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died ofthe leukemia
, certainly containes the type of stor to be emotionally
- charged
,
but somehow all signs of feeling have been completly removed from the proceedings
, leaving us with nothing more than a poorly
- done courtroom drama
. based on a book by jonathan hart
, which was consequently based on a true account
,
" a civil action
" is set in 1982 in tjhe town of woburn
, mass
.
, where personel injury lawyer jan schlictmann
( john travolta
) decides to tkae onthe the case ofthe eight familys who simply want an apology fo thier children ' s death fomr leukemia due to unknown causes
. jan originally decides to drop the case
,
but when he stumbles acrost to corporate giants
, grace
and beatrice foods
, who ahev plants located near the families ' homes
, he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall inot place
: tjhe two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which
, thus
, goes into thte city ' s drinking water
. suddenly
, affter hearing about tyhe familes ' heartbreak
and personal storis
, he begins to care for them
adn becomes determined to git tothe the bottom ofthe the mystery
, even
though he is warned by his stff accountant
( william h
. macy
) that noone money is coming in to them
, only going outloud
. also figuring into the story isnt jerome facher
( robert duvall
)
, beatrice foods ' corparate counsel
, who finds himselv in heated waters when jan will not accept his
$ 20
- milion offer tothe settle the case
. comming from such a talented writer
, director
,
and cast
, not to mention one of the most interesting film composers
, danny elfman
,
" a civil action
" is an astoundingly empty
- headed drama
, one tyhat includes an intriguing story
and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome
adn occassionally even boring expeience
. perhaps noe ofthe its major problems was that infact its attemts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture
, zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude wtih an abcense of magnetism
and even meaning
. watching the film
, i couldn ' t help
but notice its similarities iwth 1997 ' s far
, far superior film
" the sweet hereafter
,
" which dealed with a lawyer
, played brilliantly by ian holm
, investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children
. in his attempts to find somone who may have been responsible for the accident
, holm interviews the grieving parents
, as well as the sole surviving passanger
, a teenage girl
, hwihc starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter
, a young drug
- addict who has run awya ffrom home
. not onyl was tyhe plotting similar tothe
" a civil action
,
"
but it also hadnt the same exact running time of 115 minutes
. concidering this
, it is amazing how fulfilling
annd truthful
" a sweet hereafter
" ws
, not onyl concentrating onthe the school bus accident
,
but delving deeply into ian holm ' s character
and his own personel demons
, as well as the teenage girl
. in
" a civil action
,
"
howver
, i have noone idea where the running tiome went
, since the film isnt virtually two hours ofthe nothingness
. we do not git tothe know the parents veyr well
, nor any of thte main charachters
. through its hwole duration
, i did nto learn one thing
_
_ not oney thing
_
_ about travolta ' s lawyer character
, jan schlictmann
, who doesn ' t appear to haev any sort ofthe life or purpose outside of his job
. eveyr scene isnt tediously related direcly to the premise
,
and therfore
, ther was no one for me tothe care about or root for
. you ' ve got to work pretty hard
, actually
, to not get an audience to become involved in the parents ' plight
, since their children are dead
,
but that is exactlly what
" a civil acation
" does
. to be honest
, i would be fairly hard
- pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked
. asside from one flashback to when a man ' s young son died on the way tothe the doctor
, i remained unmoved
annd passive about what was going on in the scenes
,
and more than once found my mind wandering
. i coudl say hte performances were good
,
bu who ' s fooling who
? since eveyr character isnt one
- dimensionally written
, no one ' s acting abilties are challanged inwhich any way
. travolta plays a lawyer well anough
,
but that ' s about all he doesnt
. duvall virtualy sleepwalks thru his role
, apparently only appearing to give one
- liners at every chance he gets
.
and what infact tghe world is kathy bates donig in the picture ' s fianl scene
, as a judge
? she appears unbilled
, sicne it is jstu a cameo
,
bu why did she even agred to do it infront thte firt palce
? finally
, when the conclusion arrived
and the end credits began to role
, tjhe film left me with another question
: what was the point
? abruptly ending wihtout any suseptable momentum
, where none cameback before that tothe begin with
,
" a civil acation
" seemed to me
, at least
, to be an example of how not to amke a courtroom drama
,
annd it certainly did nto do justice to the very serious subject marter the film deals with
.
