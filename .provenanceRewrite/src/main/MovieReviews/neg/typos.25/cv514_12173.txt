i didn ' t hate the big hit
, even
though it is a stupefyingly terrible film
. forthe the entirety of its running time
, my eyes were attached to the screen
,
and i never once got bored
. i found the film interesting becuase of its unique awfulness
: htis is such a confused disaster of a film that it ' s entertaining to watch it in teh same way that it ' s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl
. as a narrative
, tjhe big hit is pure garbage
, never truly deciding its genre
and constanly crossing all kinds ofthe boundaries
. it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank
, which isnt a silimar film that fails in a lot ofthe the same ways
. it ' s fine to mix genres
, if thte film makers know what they ' re donig
. unfortunately
, writer ben ramsey
and director kirk wong don ' t seem to know how to handle the material
,
and the result is an action film tyhat wants to be a comedy
. the biggest probelm wtih the amalgamation
, inthe thsi case
, is tht tghe film isnt absurd
and tjhe comedy is out of place
.
but it sure is a fascinating failure
. marky
.
.
. er
, mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley
, a hitman
. he ' s a good hitman
, apparently
,
although his tactics seem a bited rambunctious
( he doesn ' t snipe or make clean kills
-
- he jsut kicks tje door down
annd shoots everyting
)
. he works with a few otehr hitmen
-
- cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
, crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
,
and vinnie
( antonio sabbato
, jr
.
)
. htey ' re a nice bunch of muscular guys
, who stand around in the locker room after working outloud
adn compare masterbation to sex
. they all work forthe a man named paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is rich
, powerful
,
and in constatn need of four sloppy hitmen
. it is very imporatnt that htey never go beyond their boss
annd do work onthe their own
; this
, of course
, isnt where the plot comes in
. they decide tothe kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko
( china chow
)
, who hasnt a rich father
. wehn tehy do thsi
, it turns out she is paris '
.
.
. goddaughter
! it ' s very bad to have paris against yuo
. the stoyr is standard action film stuf
. it ' s nothing new
,
and nothing particularily offensive
(
but certainly nto the slightest bit compelling
)
. claerly the major selling point of hte big hit is tyhat it ' s a john woo
- tipe of action film mixed inwhich witht some really hip comedy
. it ' s true that a lot of the action sequences ressemble recent films thgat go for the same idea
( such as face
/ off
and thte replacement killers
, which are both far superior
)
. there are stunts that are funn to watch
: the opening sequence hasnt melvin
and twpo of his partners gogin in to kill some guy who has nothing to do wtih teh story
. they use night vision goggles
and really poverful handguns
. melvin isnt also vrey good at breakdancing
,
and uses thsi talent to avoid bullets
and knives
. like i said
, it ' s not boring
; most disasters aren ' t
. whta makes it so bad is its genre
- shifting madness
. it seems to strat out as a quirky
-
but
- realistic acation comedy
, as melvin isnt seen transporting bags of human rimaniss
.
then
, as soon as they go tothe their first hit
, it turns inot a music video with bodies
and bullets flying everywhere
.
thn
, somewhere in between
, it turns bakc into comedy
. keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl
; in one amusing scene
, she is forced to read a letter outloud loud
, indicating tht she has beeen kidnapped
,
but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning ofthe yhe words
.
and scenes like this wokr alone
,
but wong applies tihs goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious
, or not be in the film at all
. one of yhe most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office affter he learns tath keiko has been kidnapped
; when cisco gets there
, paris
adn his men are standing around as if they knew cisco doed it
,
but they let him out of there
, telling him to find the perpetrator
. tje scene is played forthe laughs
,
but it isn ' t funny
.
and since it doesn ' t quite work as a comedy
, it trys to fall back on the acation
, which allso fails
. this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shooted with a handgun
. cars land on tree branches
and are supported by them
. characters betray each other wihtout a second thought
. grenades are thrown in tight places
. people jump out ofthe tall buildings
and survive
. people outrun tumbling cars
,
and get outloud of teh way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds
. most frustrating of all
,
though
, is hte film ' s definition of a hit man
: these guys are anything
but subtle
, quiet
,
and skilled individuals
. they ' re more like socially depraved militia men
( melvin has an extensive collecton of firearms in his garage
, inlcuding misile launchers
and hand
- held machineguns
)
. teh characters each haev noe trait that distinguishes them from the rest
; tihs obviously doesn ' t mkae for deep or intresting peopel to watch
. the acting is kind of funn
,
though
-
- wahlberg is a ogod atcor
,
and his innocuous presense in this film is charming inspite a silly sort of way
. phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic charactor
, while christina applegate
, who plays melvin ' s fianc
? e
, is convincingly air
- headed
. the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny
. tje funniest parts are supplied by the actors
,
and nto by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags
annd one
- liners
. it ' s a true disaster
, one that makes me believe that the goofy
anbd unrealistic tone is completely unintentional
. dispite all this
,
though
, i must reiterate the entertainment value here
. you cant cherish the awfulness of a film liek this
. if ytou embrace yhe big hit for the catastrofy that it is
, you jstu might enjoy youself
.
