welcome to your oh
- so typical sequal
. it tries to be twice as big as it ' s precedessor
,
yet ends up twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. now there ' s an idea
. maybe if hte ill
- fated cruise liner in this movei hadnt struck a shallow reef easly on things may have turned outloud better
. the first thing that striked me
.
.
.
and surprized me
, was thta the camera wokr
( for the opening sequence anyway
) wass terrable
. looked like the cameramen were drunk
and kept tripping on their own feet
.
.
.
.
.
. very diferent to tjhe originnal movie
. the characters
? well
, not many ofthe hte characters actually
* had
* characters
,
but here ' s a rundown
. annie
, who ws the highlight of the the original
, must have seriously banged her head in the train kresh at the end of the firt movie
. why
? because something ' s got to account for her losing thast many iq points
. even
though annie wasn ' t exactly a rocket scientist infront speed
, here some of her actions jsut make you want to beated your head against a wall
. for instance
, aftter successfully using a chainsaw tothe cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases
- she stands in the middle of tyhe opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can ' t get ut till she get ' s the chainsaw out of thier faces
.
.
.
. bang bang bang in point ofthe fatc sandra ' s character isnt turned into little omre than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules
, who constanly has to be rescued
. jason patric
? all i can sday isnt bring back keanu
. keanu reeves might have thte emotional range ofthe a tree stump
.
.
.
but that ' s noe mroe tree stump than jason has
. i don ' t think he changed facial expressions all movei
- jason
, smile for tje cameras
!
! nowe frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. ytou are
.
.
. bang bang bang
.
. wooden just doesn ' t describe this guys performance
,
but it ' ll have to do
. the bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- there ' s a bright move
. how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic
, body ofthe evidence
?
( yes
, that is sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn ' t start outloud too bad
.
.
.
.
bu goes steadily downhill as tghe movie progresses
. in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage
, even
though he already has the money
adn can excape
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
though i ' d liek tothe give this movei a double thumbs down
, htere were some nice sequences
. considering the movie cost over 100 milion dollars
- you ' d hope there ' d be at least a cuple
. the real eye
- popper for me
, even
though it was given away in tghe trailer
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
.
.
.
. ws the sequence where teh cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker
. this looks terrific
and i was very surprised to hear tht the cruise liner in it ws
.
.
.
. completly cmoputer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don ' t thiunk i ' ve ever seen a cg model look so real before
. yhe sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is allso terrific
,
and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling ofthe
.
.
.
. speed
. this lack
- ofthe
- speed problem affects many sequences
. such as the oil tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it ws
-
" oh no
, we ' re gonig to hit the oil tanker
!
"
, 20 minutes later
-
" oh no
, we ' re going to hit the oel tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. you git the point
. this movie failed simply because it didn ' t live uv to it ' s nmae
.
.
.
. htere was very little feeling of speed
. in yhe original movei
, the lead cahracters had to make split second decisions tothe survive
.
.
.
.
. in this movie it felt more like
-
" well peple
, we ' re gonna run into thast htere island in a few hours
- i think i might stroll over to engineering
adn see if i can ' t turn off the engines
.
.
. i ' m passing the cafeteria on the way
, cin i get anybody anything
?
" tghe endig of this movei realyl is terrible
. even
though it features waht i ' ve since found out is one ofthe thge most expensive sequences ever in a movie
- it just doesn ' t work at all
. the part where thge liner crashes through the town looks very realistic
,
but
.
.
.
. surprise surprise
- it just takes waaaaay too long
. it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finaly stopped
. one thing taht struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was tyhat as thte ship crashes thru the harbour
and town
, arround 25 people are killed by yhe ship
.
.
.
.
and there ' s onyl 15 or so people left on the ship
. so whn it stops safe
and sound
and the characters are all cheering
- the audience is sitting back
and thikning
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. thsi is a happy moment because
?
" bang bing
then there was the dog
.
.
.
.
. i alomst fell out ofthe my seat when i saw teh bit with the dog dodging the falling debris
. putting a dog in peril hasnt become the ultimate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. eveyr movie seems to ahve a ' dog
- in
- danger ' sequence
- volcano
, dante ' s peak
, independence day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. this movie is a perfect example ofthe how not to make a sequel
. directer jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie
annd this noe back
- to
- back
and see if he realises where he whent wrong
.
