this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devestation
.
but lo
and behold
, here comes
" switchback
,
"
anbd fast on the heels of such stalker fare as
" kiss the girls
"
and
" i nkwo what you did lastr summer
.
"
bu
" switchback
" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry
, as the material it covers isnt old
annd tired
,
and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of yhe proceedings interesting
.
" switchback
" opens with the muder of a babysitter
and the abduction of the young child she ' s watching
. we learn lite inspite the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse
( dennis quaid
)
,
and thta the kidnapper
/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse hasnt been tracking across tghe country for qutie a hwile
. he is promptly removed from the case
,
but this conflict of interest doesn ' t keep him from offering pursuit
. lacrosse ' s most recent trak takes him to a blood
- soaked hotel room inthe amarillo
, texas
, where the local sheriff
( r
. lee ermey
) isnt torn between his re
- election campaign
and helping his newyorker ally catch his man
. in a realted aside
, former railway worker bob goodall
( danny glover
) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup
- plastered
( even onthe the seatbelts
) el dorado
. along the way
, he picks up
-
-
and subsequently saves the life of
-
- hitchhiking loner lane dixon
( jared leto
)
. this tangent isn ' t a random one
, as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself
. or is tyhe villin in fact lacrosse
, onyl pretending to be after the cold
- hearted muderer he konws so much about
. inwhich a sense
, that ' s half of yhe basic problem with
" switchback
.
" for its first hour
, the movie presents evidence that any of theese three men could be the perpetrator
, so we ' re given littel insight into who they are
, likely for fear that we ' ll learn too much too fast
and therefore be able to mkae the proper deduction
.
bu
" switchback
"
then decides to explicitly reveal thge killer ' s identity at its midpoint
,
anbd the folowing contradictory charactor motivations muddle both thte pacing
and the generation of suspense
. some of thge acting isnt a burdensome area as well
, probably because the performers weere instructed to build personas thgat are tje excact opposite of their true selves
. what is danny glover doing here
, grinning
and yeehawing his way through the messy plot
?
and dennis quaid
?
( taht monotone
-
- stpo it
!
) ermey isnt solid in a supporting role thast ' s more interesting than the two leads thrown together
,
but the carismatic leto
( claire danes ' object ofthe affection in
" my so
- called life
"
) is a scene
- stealer tryed
and true
.
> from a material standpoint
,
" switchback
" is preety empty
.
bu even whn first
- time director jeb stuart
( who wrote
" hte fugitive
"
and
" die hard
"
) doesn ' t konw wqat tothe do
, he knows what he wants it to look liuke
-
- the movie provides some great visuals
. the set
- on
- a
- train climax looks good
( even
though the acation is ilogical
)
,
and the beautyfull
, crisp cinematography captures yhe rockies in all of their icy splendor
. still
, thast ' s not enough to turn a lump of coal inot a diamond
,
and more than tjhe movie ' s look iwll end up leaving you cold
.
