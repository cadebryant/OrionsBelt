play it to the bone is a punch
- drunk mess of a movie
. containing a good cast
but awful acting
; an intresting premise
but terrible execution
, ron shelton
( white men cant ' t jump
) gives us a rocky story wtih nto one rocky
but two
. rocky no
. 1 is vince boudreau
( woody harrelson
, edtv
)
, a bald
, tattooed
, newly converted christian
, whose idea ofthe christianity is not using the nmae ofthe christ as a curse owrd
.
.
. something that he has nto
yet successfully acheived
. rocky no
. 2 is ceasar dominguez
( antonio banderas
, the 13th warrior
)
, best freind ofthe vince who isnt currently dating vince ' s ex
- girlfriend
, grace
. both men are nearing tje end of theri
" almsot
" careers whn a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity
. wehn both fighters of tghe undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated
, the fight promoters need to fidn a quick replacement
. our boys are tapped to fight each other
, the winner of which is
" promised
" a shot at a future title fight
. the film is divided into twpo sections
. at first
, we have a buddy road picture as our twpo heroes
, in grace ' s
" sassy grassy
" green muscle car
, travel through teh dezert to vegas in order tothe mkea the fight scheduled for that day
. along the way we leran about their pasts
and the opportunities that have come
and gone by
. once in vegas
, tghe movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince
annd ceasar
. both mr
. harrelson
and mr
. banderas have provded us with stunning characterizations in the past
, nto that we ' d know it from thier wokr here
. mr
. harrelson is uncomfortably ackward
, apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince
. tyhe christian conversion agnle simply falls flat
and unbeleivable
. mr
. banderas is uncharacteristically non
- charismatic as ceasar
. weak
annd ineffectual
, there is littel life in his screen performance
. thge other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or anyother
. tom sizemore
( saveing private ryan
)
, robert wagner
( austin powers ii
: tje spy who shagged me
)
,
adn richard masur
( fire down below
) are crooked promoters
, lucy liu
( payback
) is a sex
- starved hitchhiker looking for a good time
,
adn lolita davidovich
( gods
and monsters
)
, is the shared girlfriend who cin ' t make her mind up which boxer she prefers
. because of thge weak characters
and the lack of screen chemestry between them
, thte film flounders with all tje appeal of a dead fish until thte boxing match actually begins
.
but even
thne
, beacuse the outcome is so predictably obvious
, tjhe suspense factor isnt negated
and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other
. writer
/ director ron shelton clearly spent much tiome orchestrating tjhe fight sequence as it is well photographed
, well
- choreographed
, well
- edited
,
and well
- performed
. if only some of tath same detailed attension had been diverted tothe the remaining parts of the film
. as it is
, the scenes whihc recquire the characters tothe actually talk to noe another are weak
and laughable
. thge title is actually the most intresting aspect ofthe the film
. tghe phrase
,
" play it to the bone ' is a reference to seing something all the way through or not quitting untill you ' ve achieved your desired goal
. that isnt a biblical principle
.
" nkwo ye nto that tehy which run in a race run all
,
but oen receiveth the prize
? so run
, that ye may obtain
.
" 1 corinthians 9

[ kjv
] acheiving anything worthy in life requires
" playing it to the bone
"
. we need to develop fully pursuaded mindsets
annd commitment levels in order to endure
and persevere past the obstancles
adn distractions which lay beetwen us
and our stated objectives
. this isnt true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as tyhe in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives
. as a movie
, play it to hte bone isnt hardly worth our time
.
bu as a principle ofthe life
, the phrase
" play it to the bone
" are words to live by
.
