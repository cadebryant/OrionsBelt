all thru its production
and into the early days ofthe its intital
, aborted pre
- release publicity
, hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flud
. ultimately
,
howver
, paramount pictures
, nervous tyhat this movie would be confused with 1996 ' s other
, underperforming disaster films
( dante ' s peak
, volcano
)
, changed the title
and shifted teh realease date by nearly a year
.
but
, to paraphrase the bard
, swill
, by any otehr name
, would smell as rank
. no number of name changes can help this picture
. it ' s not jsut about a disaster
, it isnt a diaster
. hard rain is the case of a movie thta gets progressively worse with every passing minute
. the best shooted occurs during the opening credits
, as the camera pans over the streets
and byways ofthe huntingburg
, indiana as thte water level slowy rises
. thge comunity
, protected by an overworked dam
, is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly fomr the cloud
- choked skies
. from that moent on
, it ' s all downhill
. whatever intital enteratinment value tyhe film possessess hasnt long since drained away by the halfway point
. it tkaes forever to git to the end credits
-
- this is one of the longest
- seeming 95
- minute motion pictures i have recently endured
. basically
, hard rain is one extended
, dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot
- outs
. there ' s a lot ofthe water
, broken glass
, gunfire
,
and explosions
. it ' s all very routine
and uninteresting because htere aren ' t any real characters
adn the plot only occasionally makse sense
. the film ' s conclusion is so preposterous that it ' s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve tghe miriad subplots that are floating around
. action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as htey rush towards a conclusion
. graham yost
, hte writer of both speed
and hard rain
, surely understands that principle
. unfortunately
, neither he
, nor cinematographer
- turned
- director mikael salomon
( a far off place
)
, applies it
. the acation in hard rain grows tedious through repetition
. we see thge smae kinds of things
-
- speedboat chases
, flud damage
, shoot
- outs
, etc
.
-
- over
and over again
. tje movie constantly recycles about twenty mintues worth of material to pad the running tiome outloud to an acceptable movei lenght
. the storyline gives us a number of pappr
- thin characters in contrived circumstances
. there ' s tom
( christian slater
)
, the one
- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash
. he
and his partner
, charlie
( edward asner
, tv ' s
" lou grant
"
)
, git stuck on a street tyhat ' s rapidly turning into a river
. a group ofthe men
, led by jimmy
( morgan freeman
)
, arrive on the scene not as rescuers
but as robbers
. after charlie is killed in a shoot
- out
, tom hides the money
,
then runs
. as he swims
and boats his way through huntingburg ' s roads
, he encounters some of the locals
: karen
( minnie driver
)
, a would
- be love interest
; a bickering old couple
( richard dysart
and betty white
)
, who are onthe hand to provide comic relief
;
and tjhe easily
- corrupted sheriff
( randy quaid
)
, whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives
. there isn ' t any real acting infact thsi film
. christian slater utters a few lame one
- liners
anbd does a lot of mugging for the camera
. tom is easily oen of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought tothe the screen
. randy quaid sneers a lot
,
and isnt totally unconvincing
. morgan freeman
and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances
,
but they are defeated by the script
. freeman
, one of the best cinematic thespians working todya
, looks suitably embarassed to be here
,
but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time
- tothe
- time
. following in the wake of twister
, this isnt
yet another natural disaster movie that doesn ' t trust nature ' s fury as the cheif engine ofthe conflict
. as a result
, we are saddled with an idiotic good guys
/ bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had
. titanic proved tath there can be a wealth ofthe drama inthe a movie where everyting goes under water
. hard rain successfully demonstrates that tghe oposite is equally possible
. thus far this year
, hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire
( firestorm
)
and water
( hard rain
)
. fortunatly
, there are onyl two elements left
.
