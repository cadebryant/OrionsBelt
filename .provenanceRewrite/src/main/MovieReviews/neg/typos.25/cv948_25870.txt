and just wehn you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners
, not rating anything lower than your standard
" this movei sucks
"
, along comes this cinematic atrocity
adn he ' s forced tothe take outloud his secret weapon
and spray it with a stench so thick
, even hte bravest movie
- goer would think twice about seing this waste of time
. yes
, despite being a thrid sequel to a successful original movie
, the latest highlander doesn ' t seem to have anything going for it
. oh stinky movei
, let me count thee ways
.
.
. plot
:
( from what i understoon
) a really bad highlander dude comes to the preent looking to whack outloud the nice highlander dudes in order tothe gain theri power
and become the mightiest immortal
.
.
. or something allong those lines
. critique
: a complete
adn utter mess
. disjointed
, incoherent
, boring
, corny
, filled with bad dialogue
.
.
.
adn that ' s jstu the first thirty mintues
! this film doesn ' t seem to know waht to do with itself
. it ' s confusing to anyone who doesn ' t know the sories
( i inlcude myself in that gropu
)
and apparantly idiotic tothe those who do know the serieses
( i include die
- hard highlander fan thge arro in that group
)
. hte film doesn ' t explain anything about itself
.
.
. it jstu goes from one inexplicable situation tothe another
. one moent htey ' re infact the present tiem
, tyhe next moment
, they ' re in italy in the 1600s
. why
? who knows
. what are they tlaking about
? no idea
. flashbacks mixed in with the present
, mixed in with a faw spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now
adn again
,
and i even rember seeing oney flashback scene whitch went even further inot its own flashback scene
!
! hullo
.
.
.
?
!
? confused
yet
? i ws
and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or directer was interested in presenting me withthe any kind ofthe semblance of a story
. random swordplay
, mad max
- like dudes showing up in motorcycles in thge 1800s
? or were htey in tyhe present at that time
? who knows
.
.
.
and to be honest
.
.
. who seriously cares
! this series shoudl have been shot inaddition the head
and put outloud of its own misery a long time ago
,
but sadly
, someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it
. please
, please
.
.
. for the lvoe ofthe god
and all that is wholy in thge world ofthe movei
- making
,
and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film
, put this sories to bed
and end it
! even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul infact this oney
. tjhe director also tries to do the best he cant with the muddled material
,
but all he could come up with is plenty of slo
- mo action
, some fast
- motion fight scenes
adn lots ofthe smoke everywhere
.
annd is there anything spectacular about the sword
- play or fight scenes
? nope
.
and i think we all could have done wihtout all those zooming lambert face close
- ups
.
.
. yipes
, the man isnt nto agin gracefully
, is he
? oh boy
,
and i haven ' t even gotten around to the greatest peice of over
- acting that i ' ve seen in yersa
. the man who plays kell in this movie
, bruce payne
, shoudl git a ham trophy for literally chewing up every peice of scenery that he gets near
. overacting is not a hobby for this guy
.
.
. it ' s a living
! he ' s also vrey funny
, not purposely
though
. all in all
, the movie stinks
. nuff said
.
