stallone attempts tothe ' ect ' in this cop drama
. the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal
, who ' s nephew
( played by michael rappaport
) is involved in a car crash
anbd killing ofthe two black youths
. keital dosen ' t realy want tothe get involved in anytying
, gets rid of rappaport
,
and stallone
and de niro try to work outloud what the hell is goign on
. thsi film should be brilliant
. it sounds like a great plot
, tyhe actors are first grade
,
annd tghe supporting cast is good aswell
,
and stallone isnt attempting to deliver a good performence
.
however
, it can ' t hold up
.
although thte acting is fantastic
( even stallone isn ' t bad
) the directing
anbd story is dull
and long winded some scenes go on forthe too long
, with nothing realyl happening iin them
. in fact
, the onyl scenes that do wrok are action scenes
, which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid
. in tihs film
, serious means dull
. the dialogue is warbling
,
and basically just repeats the same points over
and over
, no matter who isnt delivering them
. the plot
, which has potential
, isnt wasted
, again just being cliched after a hwile
. in fact
, the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal
and de niro
, both delivering their usual good performances
.
howver
, stallone
,
although nto given much to say
, gives a good performance
.
however
, it ' s not all that bad
. as said above
, the action scenes are well done
. theres also a vyer good ending
, which uses tghe cinemas sound system well
. inwhich fact
, the last 10 mintues ofthe tihs 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997
. if only the rest ofthe the film ws as ogod as the ending
. cop land
,
then
, turns out not to be a power house film
,
but a rather dull
,
and not every exciting film
. hugely disapointing
,
and i can ' t really recommend it
.
