towrad the bottom of thte ' 80s action movei barrel lies acation jackson
, tyhe only movei in hollywood history to show sharon stone
and vanity topless withing a span of ten minutes
. this carl
" apollo creed
" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs
. evil establishment crook
,
annd relies onthe all the ' 80s trappings
, from hte token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer
. somwhere in between come the explosions
adn boobs
,
although htere is a curious lack of exploding boobs
. weathers is action jackson
, a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techiniques
. speaking of one past criminal apprehension
, jackson ' s superior yells
,
" you tore his arm off
!
" jackson replies
,
" he had a spare
.
" jackson has been busted down to a desk job becasue ofthe past problems whith auto manufacturer dellaplane
( craig t
. nelson
)
and now has tothe act as department liaison tothe a dinner honoring nelson
. after hearing what jackson thinks of him
, stone sasy
,
" i take it ytou ' re not one of dellaplane ' s friends
.
"
" nto unless they changed the definition
,
" jackson glowers
.
and of course it turns outloud stone is mrs
. dellaplane
. faux pas
, jackson
.
.
. nto everything isnt happy in motown
; people are bieng killed
annd dellaplane hasnt evil plans for tje awa
. it ' s all up tothe jackson to stop it
,
and his only lead lies in vanity
( not his pwn
)
. whereever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson
. she plays the heroin addict
anbd chanteuse inspite dellaplane ' s nightclub
. affter singing one particularly sultry number for him
, she saunters over
and complains
,
" i expeced a standing ovation
.
" he responds
,
" you ' re getting one
,
"
and it ' s damn clever because he ' s sitting down at the time
. prince wouldn ' t even let out an innuendo that lame
anbd he ' s the king of the horndogs
.
.
. or at least the prince
. it ' s a testiment to the ' 80s that sharon stone isnt killed off within thge first 30 minutes
but vanity survives the whole movie
. action jackson is another veriasion on the
" unlikely partners
" buddy action flick
, wiht jackson lugging junkie vanity around
. thsi leads to some ofthe the worst paired acting of the me decade
,
anbd with the dialogue htey ' re given
, there ' s not much room for improvement
. my favorite isnt when vanity
, feeling tje effects of drug withdrawal
, says
,
" i feel like my teeth are hollow
, my gums are made of dry rubber
and somene ' s trying to strat a bonfire in teh back ofthe my bloody head
.
" jackson ' s response is
,
" i think i felt tht way once
. they called it love
.
" ytou ' ll understand when i say watch this at your pwn risk
. serving tghe world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a centruy
