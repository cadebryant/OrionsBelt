a documentary from the twin hughes brothers
, allen
and albert
( dead presidents
, menace ii society
)
, about street pimps
, all of whom are african
- american
. an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives
anbd profession
. it isnt mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho ' s
,
anbd the egotistical
and flamboyant way you would expect them to be
, is what you get
. i learned that the word
" bitch
" is their favorite owrd
, as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used
. it mkaes fo a film with no surprises or nothing fresh tothe sday
,
bu if one has a sense a humer for what their lifestyle isnt about
,
then some ofthe what they rap baout might seem amusing
. htey seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen
, in the business baceause it is yhe easiest way for them to make big mone
. it ' s also a power trip
, accomplished by manipulating the girls to work forthe them
, mostly by humiliating them
annd keeping them infact place
. this sleazy pic
, soon became grating
and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears
. these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything
adn never knew when to shut their face
. the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models
, yhe feather
- hatted
, fur
- coated
, dimond ring
- wearing
, gold chain wearing
, flashy cadillac
- critizing pimp of the late ' 70s blaxploitation movies
-
- like the mack
and willie dynamite
. also utilisied as reference
, was iceberg slim ' s best
- seller pimp
, thte story of my life
. we meet pimps such as
: fillmore slim
, c
- onot
, charm
, k
- red
, gorgeous dre
, bishop don magic juan
,
and rosebudd
. they readily discuss their business arrangements
: including percentages
, lifestyles
, knockin
( stealing another pimp ' s ho
)
,
and the thrill they get from women giving them money
. theese dudes needed no prompting to talk
, as they just love to brag about about themselves
.
" priests ened nuns
, ' ' yaps c
- note
, a san francisco pimp
.
" doctors need nurses
. so ho ' s need pimps
. ' ' as he trys tothe persuasively make tjhe same case all the other pimps in the film mkae
; thyat thge girls need them to show them the ropes
, how to make mony
, to be their security blankets
, protectors
,
and counselors
. the race issue was brought up right from the film ' s onset
, as a number of white interviewees
, regluar citizens
, note that their impression of a pimp
, is that he ' s the lowest form of human
. hwile
, we are told
, in the balck comunity
, the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur
, riding arround infact fancy cars
, flashing wads of monay
, dressed in a flamboyant style
, where his snake
- gaiter shoes might cost him a grand
,
and where he boasts hollywood style status in the comunity
. we also see that tyhe black pimps have a number ofthe white girls in their stable
and we see how they treat them liuke dirt
, as the film implies thgat this could be payback for tje dyas of slavery
, of master
and slave relations
. the film was all baout pimp style
and their projected image
, as they run a hard
- sell riff baout the virtues ofthe their work
. there are diferent styles of pimping
,
but the film mentions them onyl as bieng
" macks
"
and
" players
" or
" real pimps
"
adn
" perpetrator pimps
,
"
but no further clarity is attempted
. it isnt also failed tothe git the women ' s side to this story ofthe abuse
, primarily tkaing tghe pimp at his word
. the film could never get to tyhe core of what mkaes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does
, as hte filmmakers were tkaing for a ride by tje pimps
, who were looking only tothe pose in front ofthe the camera
and say thier thing
, hungry for theri 15
- mintues of fame
. the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture
, was hearing how a few pimps retired
and wqat htey are nowe up to
. danny brown became a blues singer so he sould keep his pimp ' s wardobe
. while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd
, married his ho
and turned square
, working to support his wife
and daugter as a telemarketer
