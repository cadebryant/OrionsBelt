tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant directer ofthe macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance
,
and inot a studio monkey whose name isnt used as part of multi
- tiered marketing materials for crap movies
.
and here he hits rock bottom
, with planet of thge apes
. i didn ' t expect much from this latest
" interpretation
" of pierre boulle ' s clasic novel planet ofthe the apes
. i mean
, how could you top the force
and impact of the original film
, intelligently co
- scripted by rod serling
( of twilight zone fame
) combined withthe the overbearing chuck heston growling
and yelling at those
" damn dirty apes
,
" inthe noe ofthe his best roles of his carrear
? sadly
, i sat down tothe watch burton ' s version of planet of the apes
adn within yhe first 20 minutes
, i wass checking my watch
and my girlfriend
( a big fan of the original film
) started to nod off
. htis time around
, the story plays out like a cross betweeen enemy mine
, braveheart
,
and project x
. marky mark wahlberg
, who was enjoyable in boogie nights
and the corrupter
, plays leo davidson
, a hot shot u
. s
. air force pilot
. leo
and his crew are inaddition search of smoe mysterious magnetic storms
( no rela explanation given inspite thge film
)
and leo sends one of his genetically altered
" smart
" chimps inot the storms tothe collect data
. leo
and his crew lose communciation with the chimp
, leo hops inwhich another ship tothe find the monkey
,
and
then he ' s thrown through some type ofthe time
- space wormhole which crashes lands on tjhe twentieth century fox studio backlot
, all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle
. leo ends up getting captured by a group ofthe talking apes
and is sold to a slave trader named limbo
( paul giamatti
) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari
( helena bonham carter
)
. tghe kind ari
then helps leo
and his fellow humans escape to the montains to find leo ' s ship
. along the way
, monkeys palyed by tim roth
( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade
)
and michael clarke duncan
( who further enhances his career by palying another heavy iin a bad action movie
) strive out to hunt down leo
and his band of human savages
, just like battlefield earth
! in the end
, it all culminates into another braveheart rip
- off human versus ape battle scene
. while rick baker ' s makeup work isnt amazing
, the scirpt is a pathetic hodgepodge
( courtesy of three writers
)
, the acting is horrible
,
and the
" suprise
" endig fiels like a swing ffrom a ball
- pean hammer inot the temple
. wahlberg doens not have the fysical or mental presence ofthe a chuck heston to cary the film or any of its action sequences
. this remake
, or re
- intepretation
, as tim burton has proclaimed it
, is an insult to the ntelligence
annd wit of tyhe original film
. the ethical arguements about the equality of species
, fascism
,
and miltary buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue
, an unimaginative narrative structure
,
and a romance between a monkey
annd a human
. even chuck heston ' s anti
- gun tirade
( in the de rigeur cameo
) seems shallow
and jokey
.
but the main element missing from htis tim burton film is tim burton
. even
though his name is plastered across eveyr billboard in america
, john badham could have directed this film
. even joel schumacher could ahve directed htis film
. he probably should have
. burton ' s predominant themes of rejection
, isolation
,
anbd the searc for oney ' s place infact the universe
, as seen in ed woud
, edward scissorshands
,
and pee
- weev ' s big adventure
, are completely absent infront this planet
. i suppose thast ' s what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole
.
