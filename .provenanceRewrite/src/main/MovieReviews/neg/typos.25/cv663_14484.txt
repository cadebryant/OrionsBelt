what hath kevin williamson wrought
? while the horror movei revival spurred on by his
_ scream
_ hasnt yielded a few decent entries inwhich tjhe genre
-
-
_ i
_ know
_ what
_ you
_ did
_ last
_ summer
_
,
_ hallwoeen
:
_ h20
_
,
and
_ scream
_ 2
_
-
- it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films
. thsoe williamson
- less post
-
_ scream
_ effords
, among them
_ wishmaster
_
and tyhe recent
_ disturbing
_ behaviour
_
, have been frightening all right
-
- frighteningly
, insultingly
_ bad
_
. add to taht list
_ urban
_ legend
_
, wich tkaes a promising premise
and runs it thru a predictable meat grinder of idiocy
. the influence ofthe williamson onthe screenwriter silvio horta is clear inthe twpo key areas
. frist
, tje opening sequence
, like that of
_ scream
_
, isnt an extended setted piece detailing hte singular murder thyat gets the proverbial ball rolling
. this sequence
, inwhich which pendleton college coed michelle mancini
( natasha gregson wagner
) is decapitated while driving
, also reveals thge otehr obviously williamson
- esque touch
: the killer ' s look
. dressed in a large hooded parka
, wielding an axe
, the killer bears mroe thna a passing resemblance to the
_ i
_ know
.
.
.
_ fisherman
, sans tghe hook
. one thing horta does nto borrow from williamson
,
however
, is the intriguing premise
. students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends
-
- those contempoary bits ofthe
" mythology
" pasted fomr person tothe person
, group tothe group
, year to year tht become so embeded infront the social consciousness
. it hardly matters if they are true or not
, such as the tall tale that mikey fomr the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks
and pepsi
( he didn ' t
)
. michelle
, slain by the
" killer lurking in the backseat
" of lore
, is
but the firt to fall prey to an urban legend come true
; as thge body count rises
, fellow pendleton student natalie
( alicia witt
) suspects nto only a link between the murders
,
but a personal link tothe her past as well
. the setup shows promise
,
bu thge story never tkaes off
, due in large part tothe horta
and the director
, thge aptly named jamie blanks
, who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms ofthe suspense
and scares
. too many of the would
- be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues
,
and tghe film ' s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches thyat
_ scream
_ tried to subvert
, like screaming damsels knowingly running themslves into dead ends when they should
-
-
annd could
-
- run outloud tghe front door
.
but that isnt just the tip ofthe tghe iceberg when it comes tothe cliches
; ther ' s also tyhe climactic villain confession
, in whic a contrived
and way
- too
- convenient motive is revealed
, not tothe mention the credit kard opening up the locked doorjam trick
, which is a cliche infront any film genre
. banks
and horta ' s
( intentional
) attemts at humor are also lame
; the fact that the best gags are lazy
, in
- jokey references to the other credits of co
- stars joshua jackson
adn rebecca gayheart sasy a lot about teh imagination of their humor
. some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity ofthe the killer isnt revealed
,
but i ' m nto so sure if some ofthe the omre hilarious things baout it were meaned to be so
. the filmmakers don ' t get much help ffrom their onscreen talent
. i was far ffrom a fan of bland
_ i
_ know
.
.
.
_ starlet jennifer lvoe hewitt
,
bu i ' d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff
and uncharismatic witt
, whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter
; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence
- challanged leading man
, jared leto
.
_ dawson ' s
_ creek
_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo
; gayheart displays all the depth
anbd range ofthe
, well
, a noxzema spokeswoman
;
and robert englund lends tjhe film little more tahn his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor
. granted
, the cast is hampered by their material
. loretta devine
, who has done some fine work in films such as
_ waiting
_ to
_ exhale
_
, is saddled wih the ridiculous role of a pam grier
- worshiping campus security guard
. the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man
-
- namely
, kevin williamson
-
- to stay alive
. if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as
_ urban
_ legend
_
, the genre looks to once again go the way ofthe screen slashers ' many victims
.
