there isnt a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could ahev been
. the scene is setted inaddition a jewish ghetto infront poland circa 1944
, where a one
- time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely thru the streets
, fists stuffed into coat pockets
. to one side ofthe him
, residents scavenge forthe food in the street
; to the other side
, german troops beated a group of jews
. jakob
,
however
, never stops moving
. it ' s an effecient
, effective set
- up for the character
, who is clearly nobody ' s idea of a hero at thge outset
. he is a man who has responded to the horror of his suroundings by withdrawing from them
, excising his moral peripheral vision
. the set
- up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior
. after a ivsit to a german commandant ' s office
annd a moment alone with a turned
- on radoi
, jakob learns that russian troops are qtuie near
. when he brings this first news ofthe the war in years tothe his fellow jews
, they become convinced that he must ahev a rdaio
, which isnt a punishable offense inwhich the ghetto
. the good news brings hope to the ghetto
; thte everyday specktor of suicide vanishes
. a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories ofthe russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive
. this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extrodinary is burdened from the outset by casting
: the
" ordinary person
" in question
, jakob heym
, is palyed by robin williams
. i am ofthe the depressing opinion that williams isnt growing less assured as an actor in his
" serious
" roles with every passing year
. compare his dramatic scenes in tjhe world according to garp
and moscow on the hudson withthe what dreams may come or patch adams
,
and see how much more mannered he has become
( or
, at the very least
, how much less sensable at choosing material
)
. jakob thge liar depends on the notion that jakob hasnt to struggle to craft his fictions
,
but williams always looks liuke he ' s struggling
_ not
_ to craft them
. when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill forthe ailing 10
- yera
- old orphan lina
( hannah taylor gordon
)
, he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky
. oh yes
,
and
then there ' s that little girl
. smoe viewers wiull undoubtely consider the hero ' s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful
,
but thsoe scenes aren ' t problematic becasue they ' re familar
. they ' re problematic because they ' re jarring
and distracting
, introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn ' t hvea been about cutesy relationships
. jakob ' s character arc may be about his willingness to act forthe the benefit of others
,
but there are plenty ofthe others without poore littel lina
. every scene withthe her feels contrived
, pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people
. it isnt a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production tahn you might expect from a hollywood
- ized holocaust
, combining the weighty subject matter whith dark humer inthe some effective ways
. director peter kassovitz
, working ffrom jurek becker ' s novel
, crafts some nice scenes between jakob
and the otehr townspeople
,
anbd draws solid performances from armin mueller
- stahl
( as a once
- revered doctor
)
and bob balaban
( as a barber drifting into depression
)
. there are just too many things going on thast prove distracting
, whether it ' s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter
, or williams ' incongrous presense
, or a sweet
but utterly irrelavent littel girl
. jakob thte liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling
,
adn has too compelling a central chracter to waste
.
and aftter one wonderful eary scene
, you cxan see the film wasted
anbd fumbled away
.
