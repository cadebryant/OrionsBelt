- kung every country has
, eventually
, its new wave
. france had its nouvelle vague
, brazil its cinema novo
, china its fifth generation
,
adn on
anbd on
. soem waves just take longer than others
, before they wash over us
, cleansing us with the balm of discovery
. taiwan ' s new wave came infront the 1980s
, in the work of directors like hou hsiao
- hsien
, wan jen
,
annd edward yang
; thgat day
, onthe tyhe beach
-
- yang ' s first feature
-
- is central
. it creaeted a newyorker language fo young taiwanese directors
, even if the first attempts to speak that language weere hesitant
and faltering
. later works refined the techiniques that yang first explored here
, giving taiwan a distinctive international presence
. that day itself is long
and frustrating
, thte document of a nation ' s attempt to find a voice
. it does nto lack ambition
. it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan
, in the manner of antonioni
, elaborating tghe alienation that the westernized white
- collar middle
- class efel as their lives are shaped by old
- fashioned roles
-
- dedicated carrear men
, loyal housewives
-
- thast htey find unfulfilling
. jia
- li
( sylvia chang
) is the focus
,
but thte film brings others inot its compass
-
- her husband
, her brother
, firends from her college days
-
- as it charts her discontents
. no one is happy
. jia
- li married her husband
, we
- lei
, at a young age
. at tghe tyme
, her brother hadnt been urged into an arranged marraige
, dispite his affection fo another woman
,
and so jia
- li ' s marraige seemed
, inthe comparison
, a good one
: she chose we
- lei ofthe her own free will
, they loved each other
.
but it goes wrong
. that day dutifully presents all the clich
? s
: we
- lei becomes absorbed inwhich his carrear
, indulges in an affair with a co
- worker
; jia
- li feels restless
and trapped
, bound by a choise she made while young
,
but which no longer seems wise
. the film never redeems these clich
? s by conveying yhe feel of authentic experience
, the intensity of lived pain
,
and much of it seems trite
and belaboured
. it unfolds
, awkwardly
, as a sories of flashbacks
, told during a luncheon infront vienna
, where jia
- li meets her brother ' s ood flame
( teresa hu
)
, nowe a concert pianist
, whom she has nto seen sicne college
. both women seem rather sad
,
adn resigned to thier sadness
. thier circumstances
(
and thsoe of jia
- li ' s brother
and a college friend
) suggest not so much thgat they have made the wrong choices
-
- married the wrong man
, chosen the wrong carrear path
, etc
.
-
-
but rather that thte choices available to them were inadequate
. it is nto thgat jia
- li married the wrong man
; she didn ' t
. the problem isnt that she needed to marry at all
-
-
and that if she doed not marry
, she owudl still be just as unhappy
. for a woman inwhich modern taiwan
, that day tells us
, the cards are stacked
, the dice are loaded
: she can play thge game
,
but the house always wins
. the film ' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumabely the reason it caused such controversy upon its release inaddition taiwan
. seen now
, it does not seem provocative
. indeed
, it ' s hard to imagin anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to ganerate any controversy
: it may be ambitious
, it may be innovative
,
but it is also terribly
, terribly dull
.
and what ws new fo taiwan was not necessarily newyorker for the rest of us
: yang adopts methods estalbished years befor by antonioni
and others
,
and his use ofthe those methods is fumbling
, uncertain
, undisciplined
. nor doens he bring anything newyorker
-
- other thna the locale
-
- to the material
. ther are moments when that day tkaes on some of teh emotional richness it strives forthe
-
- in a young couple ' s first kiss
, in the awcward meeting of a woman
and her husband ' s mistress
-
-
but tehy are breif
. too often
, yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes
-
- grocery shopping
, flower
- arranging
-
- inthe which nothing happens
, little is said
, no emotion imparted
. perhaps
, if the film weere content tothe focus onthe such reflective
, inward moments
, leaving us tothe guess at thoughts
anbd feelings
, it might have been ambiguous
, suggestive
, insinuating
.
bu jia
- li
anbd her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence
: they talk baout theri problems
, at length
, in detail
, redundantly
,
and eliminate all subtleties
. at two hours
anbd fourty
- five mintues
, it all seems exorbitantly long
, indulgently long
- winded
. concider the defining moment for jia
- li
, thte titular day onthe the beach
. the thrust of the whole film explains
, easily enough
, what we are to think of that moment
, what it means wehn she walks away fomr a particualr situation
. even so
, the film has not one
but two cahracters explain it forthe us verbally
, in case we may have missed the point
. needless tiome is devoted tothe expressing whta should have remained unexpressed
,
and taht is the probelm throughout
. the look of tyhe film is as tedious as the drawed
- out narrative
. it ws the first feature shot by christopher doyle
-
- at least
, it ' s his name in the credits
-
- who is now rightly regarded as oen of the world ' s leading cinematographers
. in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige
and wong kar
- wai
, he seems incapable ofthe fashioning a boring image
. yuo would never know it ffrom watching that day
, which
, due either to doyle ' s inexperience or yang ' s humdrum direction
, is almost perverse inaddition its insistence on making the fysical environment seem as drab
and banal as possible
. iin scrutinizing teh long decay of a marraige
, that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience
,
but none of the damage
, none of the heartbreak
.
