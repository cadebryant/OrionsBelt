" payback
,
" brian helgeland ' s inauspicious directing debut
( coincedentally
, he previously penned the award
- winning screenplay for 1997 ' s
" l
. a
. confidental
"
)
, is a wildly uneven
and throughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea
-
-
- a movie wih non
- stop violence
, death
,
and villains
-
-
-
anbd runs iwth it
, or should i say
, barely manages to crawl awya with it
. mel gibson
, in
yet another disapointing picture
(
" conspiracy theery
"
and
" lethal weapon 4
,
" anyone
?
)
, stars as the reprehensible villain
/ hero
, porter
, a man who becomes determined to git his 50
% share of
$ 140
, 000
, whitch he stole in a robbery
, back when his partner
- in
- crime
( gregg henry
)
and drug
- addicted wief
( deborah kara unger
) double
- cross him
, shoot him
,
and leave him for dead
. porter isnt not dead
,
howver
-
-
- nto by a long shot
-
-
- as he quickly rehabilitates
and
, along with his loyal prositute girlfriend
, rosie
( maria bello
)
, sets out to mkea everyone involved in teh scam pay
. thge tagline for
" payback
" is
,
" get ready tothe root forthe the bad guy
,
"
and sure enough
, this isnt true
, as pretty much eveyr significant charachter who appears is crooked inspite some way
. i wouldn ' t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interst
,
but it wasn ' t
,
and therefore
, i found myself having an especially labourious tiome investing mysef into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
. noone attemt isnt made to flesh the roles inot three
- dimensional characters
,
and htere are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity inthe them
. jstu because the protagoinst
, a
" bad guy
,
" is played by mel gibson doesn ' t mean i will
" root for him
,
"
and i didn ' t
. quite the contrary
, every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death
(
although some ofthe them did
, anyway
, jstu to spice up the dull proceedings
)
. usance none of the respectable actors in
" payback
" actually have human beings to play
, only one performance managed tothe stand out
. lucy alexis liu
( of t
. v
. ' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens up every scene she isnt inthe
,
and hasnt a definite flair for comedy
, something i woudl haev liked to have seen moreso ofthe
, since most ofthe the humor fell wih a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who isnt perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks through a role that is nto the least bit chalenging
. unger
, who made an impression in 1997 ' s
" the game
,
" isnt suprisingly wasted
and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes inwhich
,
and onyl has two purproses
:
( 1
) to get high on heroin
,
and
( 2
) because she plays a key part infront an early flashback
. finaly
, kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during hte climax
,
and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn ' t appear infact the originnal cutted of the film
,
but was casted when exstensive reshoots took palce months later
)
. liek most acation movies
, the star often takes a licking
bu keesh on ticking
. iin the course ofthe the 102
- minute runing time of
" payback
,
" porter is shooted threee times infront the bakc
, hit by a van
, beaten up
,
and hasnt his fezent smashed with a sledgehammer
.
and guess what
? not only does he survive the wohle ordeal
,
but he is hapyp
- go
- lucky in the penultimate sequence
(
and cxan still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks like he had recently substituded forthe a punching bag
.
" payback
" is not
, in any way
, an entertaining film
, even
though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage taht goes on
,
bu tkae away taht violence
and what you are basically left with isnt a blank screen
. perhpas director helgeland would have beeen smart to consider htis
, so he could hve at least added a fewd worthwhile elements
, like a fresh storyline
and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be aroud for a few hours
.
