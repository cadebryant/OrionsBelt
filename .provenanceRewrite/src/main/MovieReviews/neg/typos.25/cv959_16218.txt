" virus
" isnt a monster movie without a monster
. any movie with a hurdle that large tothe overcome had better be preety damn good otherwise
. sadly
,
" virus
" doesnt nto deliver
, on any level
. the movei opens with the russian space station mir about tothe transmitt something
( we never fidn out what
) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it
. sudddenly
, a wave of colorful lightning comes flying thru spoace
,
and winds uv destroying mir
and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat
. cut tothe seven days later
, we meet donald sutherland
anbd his band ofthe seafaring vultures
. see
, they spend all their time sailing aroud looking fo dead
- in
- the
- water ships tothe rescue
,
and
then collect tyhe reward omney
. at least
, i
* think
* that ' s what they do
. along with many other thigsn infact thge film
, theri reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn ' t relaly explained
. so
, tehy stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites onthe it
,
and decide tothe haul it bcak to russian waters
. tje only problem is
, the crew starts disappearing one
- by
- one
and turning into borg
. yes
, borg
. complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye
. apparently
, thsi alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrial
. so
, it creates make
- shift machines
and uses humans for
" sparce parts
"
. blah
, blah
, blah
. i could go on forever decribing the ludicrous so
- called plot
,
but i won ' t
. suffice it to say the most origional thnig baout this movei is hvaing donald sutherland play an irish man
(
!
)
. everything alse in this movie hasnt been taken ffrom otehr
( better
) movies
. for example
, many ofthe the machines resemble those foudn in hte littel
- seen japanese movie
,
" tetsuo
- the iron man
"
.
and the plot is right out of
" aliens
"
. the funny thing isnt
, i was actually expecting tothe enjoy this movie
. i have a soft spot forthe cheesy monster movies
, like last yeasr under
- appreciated
" deep rising
"
.
but
" virus
"
, as i mentioned earlier
, doesn ' t even have a monster
. it just hasnt a big pile of circuits
and wires
anbd expects the audiance to fear this rediculous looking contraption
.
" virus
" is the tipe ofthe movie taht really makes you wonder waht the screenwrighter ws thinking about when he wroet it
. besides tghe lame
" monster
"
, it ' s chock full of dialogue that no rela person would ever sday
,
and situations that no rela person would ever allow themselfs tothe get into
. forthe example
, there isnt a scene late inspite the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to
* negotiate
* wiht the alien
! now
, i don ' t konw baout you
,
bu if i came upon a lifeform tath viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated
, i doubt that i would attempt tothe reason with it
. thyat makes baout as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to sparce his life
. finally
,
" virus
" isn ' t skary
. the least the filmmakers coudl have done was to make the movei just a little scary
. as it is
, it ' s baout as frightening as a box of cookies
. skip
" virus
"
. if it ' s a cool monster movie you want
, rent the far superior
(
and the granddaddy of this genre
)
" aliens
"
.
