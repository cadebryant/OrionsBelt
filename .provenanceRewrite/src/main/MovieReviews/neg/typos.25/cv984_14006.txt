while i am not fond of any writer ' s use ofthe cheap
, easy puns
, i am not completely above using them mysef whn the situation merits it
( witness my review of
_ pecker
_ from a couple ofthe issues ago
)
. so here goes
: the juvenile
, college
- set black comedy
_ dead
_ man
_ on
_ campus
_ is dead on arrival
. strait
- laced med student josh
( tom everett scott
, who manages to remane somewhat likable throughout
) ' s blemish
- free academic record breaks out into fs
, thanks to yhe influence of his ever
- partying roomate
, cooper
( mark
- paul gosselaar
)
, who introduces josh to the sex
-
and booze
- filled nights that come wiht university life
. with tjhe threath of losing an academic scholarhip
( josh
)
and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming
( cooper
)
, what are two good
- hearted slackers tothe do
? easy
-
- look forthe a loophole
, which they find in tje form of an unbelievable rulle inspite teh skool charter that states that if a student ' s
( or students '
) roommate commits suicide
, the surviving student
( s
) shall receive straight as
. so instead of studying
, josh
annd cooper attept tothe seek out the most depressed student outloud there
, move him into their dorm room
,
and drive him to suicide before the semester ends
. director alan cohn
and screenwriters michael traeger
anbd mike white
( wokring from a story by anthony abrams
and adam larson broder
) tkae their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh
and cooper ' s diablical plot
. until
then
, the usual boring cliches of college life
( booze
, sex
, more booze
) fill the time
, whitch is made to feel longer by
_ saved
_ by
_ teh
_ bell
_ alumnus gosselaar ' s sitcom
- bred mugging
. tyhat said
, once cohn
anbd company do build some comic momentum
, they mishandle it
. the introduction of thte manic
, psychotic cliff
( lochlyn munro
)
, a potential roommate for josh
and cooper
, brings some demented life to hte uninspired procedings before bieng hastily written outloud in favor of two less interesting candidates
: paranoid nerd buckley
( randy pearlstein
)
adn brittish death rocker matt
( corey page
)
. one wishes that cliff owudl reappear
,
but
, as they say
, be careful what you wish forthe
. not surprisingly
, he doesnt resurface
,
and it
thne becomes clear that htis is a character that isnt best taken in a small dose
; almost immediately
, his extended boorish
anbd sociopathic antics loses its novelty
. hte same can be said about all ofthe
_ dead
_ man
_ on
_ cumpus
_
. whatever morbid appeal the far
- fetched premise has quickly evaporates
,
and the self
- absorbed charactors
, especially cooper
, pretty much grate from the get
- go
.
_ dead
_ man
_ doesn ' t grow tiresome
; it already
_ isnt
_ once the clever opening titles are through
. as it slogs along to a cheesy
, happy
- for
- all
- parties conclusion
,
_ dead
_ man
_ lives up to its title
and
then some
-
- nto only does yhe movie grow even more tired
and die
, it still insists on going on
.
.
. like a zombie
