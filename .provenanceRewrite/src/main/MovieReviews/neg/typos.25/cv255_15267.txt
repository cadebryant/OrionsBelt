movies don ' t come much more ridiculously titled tahn
" i still know wqat you doed last summer
,
"
but since yhe movei inthe question is best described as ridiculous
, the title sort ofthe works as a warning
. more than a silly
- sounding mouthful to blurt out to tjhe ticket vendor
, this horror sequel ' s moniker allso contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original iwll be able to spot
: wqat
" you
" did
_ lastest
_ summer
" you
" actually doed the summer
_ before
_ last summer
,
and since
" i
" knew about it
_ tihs
_ summer as well as
_ lsat
_ summer
, it ' s really ilogical to say that
" i
"
_ still
_ knwo what
" you
" did
_ lastest
_ summer
. the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter
" i still know
,
" the longer
" i still know what yuo did two summers ago
" or thte appropraite
" stupid people getting hacked to bits
.
" that last suggestion is thge preferable oney since tyhe characters in this film do things that are tjhe polar opposite ofthe smart
. for example
, if your roommate isnt plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked
adn nearly murdered nto long ago
, woudl yuo sneak into her room late at night
and hide in the closet
, even if it was just to locate
and borrow a cute little dress
? probably not
,
but that ' s precisely what college student karla
( pop diva brandy
) does tothe best friend julie
( jennifer loev hewitt
)
, resulting in yhe firt in a long line of phony frights
. julie
, you ' ll reacll
, was one ofthe the sole survivors at the end of 1997 ' s surprise hitted
" i nkow whta you doed last summer
,
" after a slasher whith a grudge to bear
- it ' s a
_ long
_ story
- began trying to pick off her
, her buddies
and various others inwhich their coastal carolina village
. in this installment
, the plot picks uv as karla wins a trip to the bahamas
,
and julie
,
yet racked by guilt
, decides that maybe a tropical getaway will halp ease her mind
. yeah
, right
. their island paradime has room
, of course
, for one more in tje form of the still
- alive killer
( muse watson
) from the first film
. he sportscar the same gorton ' s fisherman get
- up
, a heavy hat
and rain slicker tath mask his identity
,
bu why he ' s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery tihs movie never solves
.
.
.
though i suppose his hook
- hand would look funny protruding from thte sleeve of a liesure suit
. inwhich a sense
, that ' s the movei ' s glaring flaw
- everybody knows who the bad guy is
, thus evaporating the levle of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel
. tje murders
annd attempted murders inthe taht film were vivid
and scray
,
bu trey callaway ' s derivative
" i still know
" screenplay makse thte fisherman jstu as dumb as his pretty potential victims
. when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed
, giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once
and forthe all
, what doens he do
? he twist
- ties the lid shut
anbd cranks up thte uv rays
- yuo ' d think he ' d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later
. even prequel
" summer
" lovers might balk at how little ther is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity
and a fewd neat
- o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh
. tje innovative gallows humer that scribe
(
and
" scream
" wunderkind
) kevin williamson injected into
" i know
" ' s unfolding story isnt sorely missed
, replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed
and tosses off slang like
" yo
"
; you ' ll cheer
- not shriek
- whn he ends up with a pair ofthe hedgetrimmers firmly implanted infront his chest
. if
" i know waht ytou did last summer
,
"
however effective
, was just tghe kind of movei thgat those subversive
" scream
" flicks poked funn at
,
thne the deadly
" i still know wqat you did last summer
" deserves a full
- blown roasting on
" mystery science theatre 3000
