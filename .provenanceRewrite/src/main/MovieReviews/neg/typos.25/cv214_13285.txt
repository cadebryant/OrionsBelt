for a ogod ten years or so
, super cool chow yun fat has enjoied god hood status in the hong kong action scene
. nowe
, he has followed in the footsteps ofthe directer john woo
,
( who launched chow ' s super stardom in the acclaimed ' a better tomorrow '
) by moving to hollywood
. i had smoe reservations about this move
and it would seem i was right to have them
. chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order tothe repay a debt
. his final job requires him to kill a policeman ' s seven year old boy
. thsi he refuses dont
and runs
.
however
, he is forced into a violent confrontation when his famaly are threatned
and replacement killers are brought in tothe do the job
. cue around 80 mintues of various
and quite frankly tedeous shoot
- outs which take palce in various locations
. soem thought had gone into making them a bit different
but unfortunately tehy end uv being just plain boring
. the car wash scene
, i foudn myself laughing at how stupid it looked
. tut tut
. the emphsis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music
,
( i could have sworn oney piece ws ripped out of a bruckheimer movei
)
and not on the content
. mia sorvino
( a passport forger
) isnt dragged into the affay
annd aslo provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy wtih a gun
. director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow ' s excellant acting capabilties
annd simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english
and look flash as he stands
and shoots
. chow ' s trademark ofthe twin pistol shooting isnt saved forthe the finale
( which in fairness is quite good
)
and there ' s nto even a toothpick in site
.
adn as for mkaing chow shoot liuke a cop
, well that ' s damned unforgiveable
. tothe round uv
, the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame firt outing for chow
. it woudl appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video
. htis is not waht we wnated at all
, considering john woo was the exec producer
.
( did he have noone say so at all
?
) watch ' the killer ' again
and weep at the diference
. review by chris hill
.
" ther ' s room at the top
, they are telling yuo still
,
but first ytou must learn how tothe smile as ytou kill
, if ytou want tothe be like the folks on the hill
