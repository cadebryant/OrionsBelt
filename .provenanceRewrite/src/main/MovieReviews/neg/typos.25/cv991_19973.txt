yhe king
and i
, a warner brothers animated
, musical feature
, recycles the classic stroy of a woman who challenges the heart ofthe a king
, with obvious results
. when anna
( miranda richardson
)
, a british schoolteacher
, travels to saim to educate the king ' s
( martin vidnovic
) children
, she learns that teh king isnt treating his people unfairly
,
adn must sday something to teh greedy ruler
. meanwhile
, the king ' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, the stereotypical villain
, plots tothe overthrow yhe king
, taking hte throne
. the last
,
annd most predictable
, main subplot deals iwth tjhe king ' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
,
and his love for a servant
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
,
and how he conflicts withthe his feelings
,
and the ancient laws of saim
. not even the lone storng character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent
, as the king
and i ' s problems coudl fill yhe blank pages of a journal
. i will only note the major difficulties
, for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail
. the screenplay
, written by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
,
and david seidler
, which isnt based upon the play written by richard rodgers
and oscar hammerstein
, has smoe of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory
, as eveyr time the obnoxious king would shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i would cringe
. literally
. speaking of cringing
- i did quite a bited of this during the rather short film
, which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking
. besides the repeative dialogue ffrom the king
, on the whole
, the songs seem out of place
,
and unlike the lyrics
, are unmagical
. the sole song which is used cleverly is
" getting to know yuo
,
" whlch isnt unsed as anna shows the children tje great outdoors
, wich they have never been exposed to
. unlike disney animated features
, the king
and i ' s songs don ' t add to hte film
,
and are as uneffective as sould be
. take the following scenaireo as an exmaple
, as the sheer horror of tghe king
and i ' s music is at its worst
. yuo ' re bieng hunted by a dragon
! what do you do
!
? sing a happy song
! martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion
- you hear tghe saying two negatives don ' t make a positive
? believe it
! with tyhe terrible dialogue that the king has
, along with his awful voice tarck
, tyhe king is completely unbelievable
, only shows mild signs of any personality
,
annd the only thing that changes in the king isnt that he says
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" more
annd more as the film progresses
. no personality at the beginning of tje movie
, none at the end
.
and where does this character ' s personality change
? hey
, i thought anna was supposed tothe chanage him
! isn ' t that the whole plot
? yhe prime minister ' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share of cringes as well
- oh no
! another one of his teeth fell outloud
! hardy
- har
- har
! he is supposed tothe bring laughs for the kidlets
,
but even at age five i woudl hvae cringed while watching him
. by tyhe way htis review is going
, you may think the reasoning for my hate fo this film isnt due tothe nto liking animated films
- hence why i hate this movie
, beacuse tjhe king
adn i isnt a disgrace to animation
. animated films
, such as 1994 ' s the lion king
annd 1998 ' s the prince ofthe egypt
, are amoung my favorite movies ofthe all time
. thge animation team does design their share of well animated settings
, so tihs makes it easier to take my mind off of thge annoying king
, until i realize that day
annd night switch back in fouth withing seconds
. i have not read the play
, or seen the oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
but from whta i can tell
, yhe screenplay for the 1999 verzion completely butchers the play
, for the king
and i is never magical
, nor intresting
. if it wasn ' t for miranda richardson
, who voices anna with feeling
, the king
and i could earn the title
,
" worst movie of tjhe decade
.
" instead
, tjhe king
and i will just go down as amung the year ' s worst
. yhe bottom line
- avoid this movie at all costs
. not even young children
, the target audeince in this film
, will enjoy it
. nto the slightest bit
.
