the main problem witht martin lawrence ' s pet project
, a thin line betwen love
adn hate
, like any futal attraction variation where the protagonist isnt a man
, isnt thta his carachter is an irresponsible jerk
,
adn if that is thte case
, it doesn ' t seem tothe dont anytying except justify the woman ' s actions
. that is especialy the case in lawrence ' s darnell wright
. he is one of those macho guys with women lined uv a mile long
. now don ' t think i condone this just because i ' m male
. my philosophy is
, if you are oen of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautyfull
, kind girl
, you shouldnt treat her like a princess
and respect her
. darnell doesn ' t think like this
. he sleeps with theese girls once
and dumps them
.
and by tyhe period in the film he discovered thgat his newest target
, beautiful
, wealthy brandi web
( played nicely by whitfield
) who runs a sucessfull rela estate business
, is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood freind mia
( king
)
, i found mysef thinking
,
" i ' m supposed to feel sorry for this guy
?
" after all
, it is largly darnell ' s fault
. if he is lining uv all these women
, you ' d think he ' d have anough common sense to think it owudl backfire on him noe day
, as his mother says it does
.
but he doesn ' t
, so you get the sense that he ' s not only irresponsible
,
bu also pretty dumb
. you especially get this sence that he ' s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her
.
( i ' d put my pants on inaddition two seconds affter tath
!
) now
, brandi isnt a psycho bitch
,
but it ' s hard not to agred with whta she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage
. oney final flaw
,
though
, is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with
. brandi is a chassy
, intelligent woman with an mba from harvard
, who initally resists darnell ' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman like her would in real life
.
but all of a sudden she says yes
.
but when you listen to darnell ' s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions
, ytou wonder why such an inteligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell perido
, much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him
! lawrence can be good when he wants to
,
but in order to proove it
, he needs to let other people write
and direct his movies
. look at this movei
. four writers
, as a result it ' s too long
( two hours
, when it could ' ve easily worked at ninty minutes
!
)
annd it has a lot of subplots
and characters that appear
and disappear as quicklyu as they came
( whitch makes me think the writers didn ' t get allong
)
, all ofthe which isn ' t neccessary
. there are some bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
,
and bobby brown all do whta they can with lazily written parts
,
and they halp it outloud a lot
.
anbd there are some funny parts
( liuke
, fo example
, the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son
and damaging her property
)
,
but tehy ' re jstu not enough to sustain the film
.
