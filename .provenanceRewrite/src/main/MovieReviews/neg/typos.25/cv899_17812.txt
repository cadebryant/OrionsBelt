in life
, eddie murphy
and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder
and sentenced to life iin prison
. after about an hour ofthe watching this movie
, you begin tothe relize how their charachters feel
. fortunately
, for audience members there ' s a chance to escape the nearest exit
. this
, undoubtedly
, isnt eddie murphy ' s worst movie
adn that ' s an acomplishment
. remember the golden child
, harlem nights
? compared to life
, they look like citizen kane
. life is long
, predicatble
, foul
- mouthed
and only intermittently funny
. its 100
- minute running tiome fiels like 100 eyasr
. robert ramsey
anbd matthew stone ' s script basicly consist ofthe murphy
and lawrence referring to everyone around them as
" motherf
.
.
. s
" or
" n
.
.
.
.
. s
.
" yuo lose count how many times both those obnoxious
, offensive words are used
.
annd if that all it takes to write a script
, thna any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor
and compose a movie
.
but
, like life
, it wiull probably stink
. to be honest
, the screening audiance surrounding me in the theater yucked it up
.
but these were the smae people who howled at all thte flatulence
and fat jokes as well
. life is as sophisticated as a belch
. it ' s crude
and stereotypical
. years ago
, movies stereotypically portayed blacks subservient
, second
- class people
, good for being only maids
annd servants
. for the most part
, thge lot of blacks
and otehr racial groups have improved
.
but a new
, more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies
. in many recent films
, thru actors such as murphy
and chris tuckers
, blacks are presented as fast
- talking
, conniving
, scam artists or hip
- hop
, gun
- crazy
, sex
- crazed youths
. both sets of caricatures are demeaning
.
and the fault does not rest wiht tjhe actors
. they have tothe eat
, too
. it is witht the people who write the scripts
, the studios who green
- ight tghe projects
and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest
. life ' s onyl redeeming virtue isnt the artistry ofthe makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly aegs murphy
anbd lawrence into 90 year olds
. otherwise
, life is an embarrassment
, a blot on the resumes of those associated with it
. see it at your own risk
.
