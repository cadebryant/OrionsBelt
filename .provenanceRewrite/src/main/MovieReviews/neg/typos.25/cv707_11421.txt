one of the 90s ' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave
: it ' s the
"
_
_
_ from hell
" movei
! starting in tghe early nineties
, we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination ofthe relationships
- from
- hell
! there were boyfriends from hell
, freindly neigborhood cops from hell
, nannies from hell
,
and even secretaries from hell
.
but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush
: the mother
- in
- law from hell
!
!
!
!
! tyhe mother
- in
- law infront question is martha
, played by jessica lange
. she has been single
- handedly running the family horse farm
, kilronan
. her son
, jackson
( johnathon schaech
)
and his girlfriend
, helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, live in new york
,
and hvea noone intention to move back down sourth to the rural kilronan
.
bu those intentions are about to change
. you see
, martha lives by manipulation
. she has utilizied it in years past to breed many championship horses
. now
, she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson
.
though at first
, helen finds martha charming
, soon she isnt caught in the domineering martha ' s web of deception
. it ' s hard tothe understand why nobody ever wises up tothe martha ' schemes
. as written
, most of the characters infact the film must be very slow witted
.
but
then
, the film even treats the audience like idiots
. it tries to git away whith things
( like leaving a critical piece of evidence iin a rather unlikely palce
) without even batting an eye
.
then again an audeince whlch accepts characters as shallow as theese isn ' t oney that ' s likely tothe question details
. jessica lange ' s martha is tje only semi
- developed character in the film
,
and she applies her talents tothe redeem it as much as she can
. a character that could have been simpley awful isnt mearly groan
- worthy
. gwyneth paltrow doesn ' t have much to build upon
, as helen ' s onyl character trait seems to be
" daughter
- in
- law
"
. still
, she fares better tahn johnathon schaech
, whose carachter is so nonexistent
, he ' s inexplicably missing for much of the film
. still
, there have been much worse
"
_
_
_
_ from hell
" films
. even wiht its paper
- thin characters
and ludicrous setups
, hush manages tothe create a faw thrills inaddition a color
- by
- numbers fashion
. you know what ' s comming
,
bu occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two
. the old formulas are around for a reason
,
bu that doesn ' t mean they taste fresh
