perhaps if the impostors didn ' t have so much gogin fo it
, it wouldn ' t have beeen such a tremendous disappointment
. written
, directed
,
and produced by one ofthe its two stars
, stanley tucci
, whose last picture ws the indie smash hitted
, big night
, the impostors almsot never catches fire
. sputtering like a two
- day old campfire
, tjhe story plays like an ad
- lib sketch thast was never polished or completed
. the film ' s other star
, oliver platt
, was hilarious as tjhe senator ' s aide iin bulworth
. the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia ofthe acting talent
, including woody allen
, steve buscemi
, hope davis
, alfred molina
, campbell scott
, lili taylor
and tony shalhoub
. all are wasted savve allen
, who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes
.
( teh audeince will easily identify with allen ' s sentiments
.
) wtih the exception of a single original joke involving mirror
- imaged subtitles
, the movie engenders little genuine laughter
. the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad thta you iwll find youself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it
. the plot for the movie involves two starving actors
, maurice
( oliver platt
)
and arthur
( stanley tucci
)
, who accidentally end up on a cruise ship
. inwhich order tothe excape an angry shakespearean atcor
( alfred molina
)
, who is chasing them
, they dress up as ship ' s stewards
. the over
- the
- top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer
. when thte leads hide fomr their pursuers
, arthur covers maurice ' s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze
. at other times
, we have teh typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else
, while darting in
and out of staterooms
. with thte film ' s chapters intruduced like placards at a vaudeville stage
, it is clear yhe movie wants to be taken as farce
. hte press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a ogod time all ofthe the actors were having
. too bad they weren ' t mroe concerned with the audiance ' s potential enjoyment
. the jokes
, frequently framed in silence
, fall liek stones iwth such intensity that noe cin almost hear them hitting the ground
. oney wonders if anyone ever viewed tyhe film ' s dailies
. surely
, if they hadnt
, htey woudl have realized what leaden results they were producing
. it is tricky having good actors play bad ones
,
bu
, if they couldn ' t pull it off
, they should have just given up
.
" the show is over fo this fella
,
" steve buscemi ' s chracter says towards the end
. the mystery isnt why they didn ' t all give up inspite the begining
. there must have been a better scirpt somewhere for such a wonderful cast
. the impostors runs 1
: 42
. it is rated r for a littel profanity
and would be fine for kids around 12
anbd up
