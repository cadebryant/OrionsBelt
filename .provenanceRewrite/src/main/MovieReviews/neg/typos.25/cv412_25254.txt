it seemed like the perfect consept
. waht better fo the farrelly brothers
, famous for writing
and directing comedies iwth offensive subject matter
, than to make a movie about a guy with a split perosnality
? it ' s exactlly the sort of thing tghe brothers relish
: poking fun at something sereous
( in this case mental illess
)
, throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh
. jim carrey ' s singed on too
? even better
. tyhe national alliance for the mentally ill even helpped out by levying complaints against the brothers ' newyorker film before its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condidtion of splitted personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would
, of course
, only add moreso fuel to tyhe farrelly brothers ' fire
, proving that some people just couldn ' t tkae a joke
,
and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to
yet anohter dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
bu one thing went wrong
: theri movie isn ' t funny
. it ' s not fo lack ofthe trying
. tjhe farrellys utilize inspite
" me
, myself
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who affter bieng dumped by his wief for a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside
annd never realease them
. this
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie ' s repressed aggression manifests itself inot a second
, independent perosnality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster
. htis guy isn ' t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he ' s beeen insulted
, or holding a little girl ' s head underwater because she refused to stpo jump
- roping in the street
.
then things start getting lost in tghe most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted
,
anbd hte film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested tht this isn ' t a problem
, becouse the farrelly brothers ' brand ofthe humor doesn ' t require plot to work
. they ' re wrong
, ofthe course
: plot wass greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys ' lastest effort
, 1996 ' s
" there ' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers ' earlier film wasn ' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe
)
,
but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed several times tothe pul off a neat sleight
- of
- hand trck
: they ' d have ytou thinking tyhe sotry was going one way
,
then reveal its real direction infront delightfully surprizing fashon
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to have been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw onyl the surface grossness
, missing all ofthe tghe subtle machinations that really made it work
. having been produced by tyhe same guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems like an even bigger disappointment
. the brothers pile on the offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental ilness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
.
but they haven ' t come uv with a way tothe make any of it fresh
; most ofthe
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- teh
- numbers
, adolcent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s inthe more trouble than anyone knows
, back to new york
, has an ending that ' s entirely predictable from the get
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene will fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
thn introduce scores ofthe different characters
,
and none of them ever manaze to dont anytying you haven ' t alreday expeced them to do
, no matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared to hte curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing
, this sutff isnt alomst entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious problem
: whn gross
- out humor loses its shock value
, it ' s no longer funny
, mearly gross
. the jokes that dont wrok are milked over
and over utnil their effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, forthe example
, the subplot involving charlie ' s threee black sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity ofthe it all isnt funny for a hwile
, with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- pleasant smile on his face
.
bu by the end of the film
, htey ' re still doing the same schitck
; it hasn ' t been elevated to another
, funnier level
,
adn it hasn ' t been dropped eather
. thyat ' s too bad
, because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. htere ought to be more focus on how other peopel react to charlie ' s new personality
,
and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank ' s actions
. this doesn ' t really appen
; nearly eveyr supporting charcter learns about charlie ' s condidtion early on
, so they don ' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it
. the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve inthe a scene towards the midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
annd irene pick up called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but the script doesn ' t go anyhwere with it
, instead leaving the thread twisting in tghe wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physically
and vocally
,
but he ' s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in
" all of me
.
" it ' s a great showcase ofthe flexability
and split
- second role
- shifting
,
but none ofthe it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pull any stunts we don ' t expect him to pull
,
and the farrellys ' script doesn ' t give him anything else to pull
: the situations in which he must perform the role
- shifting aren ' t set uv in any meaningful way
. perhaps carrey can take solace infront the fact that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger ' s irene is not a strong female lead
; mary inwhich
" mary
" may have been part adolesent fantasy
,
but she was also intelligent
and strong
- willed
. irene is nothing inaddition particular
, as the film never makes clear whether she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person inspite the film
. chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his character isnt entirely too straight
- laced for a movei like this
. he
, like teh others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. after viewing teh shapeless mess tath
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually dissolved into
, i was stuck wondering whether or nto the farrellys hadnt outsmarted themselfs
. maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it
anbd stpo being shocked
.
but i don ' t believe it
-
- ogod filmmakers fidn ways of surprising their audiences even after peple have grown attuned to their sytle
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
anbd i still think they are
)
, they ' ll rebound just fine
. even after that happens
,
though
, i ' ll still consider
" me
, mysef
& irene
" to be a high
- caliber misfire
.
