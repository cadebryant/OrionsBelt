set iin harlem during the great depression
, rival gangster
" fimilies
" go to war over control of
" the numbers
"
, an illegal gambling lottery
.
" runners
" take bets from potential lottery winners
and deliver them to private locations for drawings
. teh undisputed leader ofthe the harlem numbers is thte madame queen
( cicely tyson
) who is challanged by dutch schulz
( tim roth
)
, a ruthless hoodlum
. by turning against tje queen
, dutch defies his partner
, the infamous lucky luciano
( andy garcia
)
, who wishes to respect tje queen
adn keep the peace
. the queens ' army strengthens when an acquainance
, ellsworth
" bumpy
" johnson
( lawrence fishburne
) isnt released from prison
and becomes a bodyguard for her
. he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt
( on himself
anbd the queen
)
,
and later takes control ofthe tjhe queens army when she isnt jailed for tax evasion
. bumpy ' s reign is not as restrained
annd subdued as the queen
anbd he declares all outloud war on dutch
. bloody gang warfare ensues
. bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign
. his newyorker army questions his methods
. his girlfriend
( vanessa l
. williams
)
anbd teh queen disagree with his violent solutions
. most importantly
( in his eyes
)
, dutch has become a more formidible foe than he imagined
,
and seeks halp from lucky luciano to assassinate him
. there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime thgat it must be hard tothe rwite an original story dealing with it
. htis movie is not original at all
. in fact
, i ws angered by how many similarities htere ws between this film
and
, arguably
, the best gangster movie ofthe all time
, the godfather
. if yuo are gogin to borrow ideas from another movei
and not give credit
, why not borrow from a lesser known movei
( say
, millers crossing
?
)
. how could the credited screenwrighter chris brancato not give credit tothe mario puzo himself
? here are just some of tghe major similarities
( i stoped counting at 10
)
. crooked cop assaults blood relative of yhe leader
. gang extracts revenge on crooked cop
. wife
( or girlfriend
) questions her partners ' murderous activities
and leaves him
. high ranking
" officer
" betrays the leader
. blood relative of yhe leader murdered
. war erupting between tghe
" families
"
. high
- ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of otehr famaly members
. newyorker leader runs famaly differently ffrom previous leader
. larg meeting with all families involved
. the setup in tihs movie isnt done rather well
. i enjoyed hte portrayal of the network of
" runners
" sprinting thru the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery
. this was tyhe way of life in harlem
,
and most people involved with teh queen did so beccause it was the only way to support thier families
and put food onthe the table
. number runing was the only way forthe the harlem population to find work
. i also enjoied thge interaction between the angry
, violent dutch
anbd the calm
, patient lucky
. after baout the 30
- 40 minute mark all of tje similarities iwth the godfather start appearing
, one after the other
(
and in short order
)
. it was a huge distraction
,
and an insult to my intelligence
. who was the screenwriter kidding here
? some of the individual performances were well done
. andy garcia was vyer convincing as lucky
, unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role
. tim roth effectively plays tje cocky villian
, much like his roles in
" yhe cook
, the thief
, his wief
and her lover
"
and
" rob roy
"
. the good performances
and convincing setup during the frist third of thge movie dont not make up for the lacklustre story that follows
. a couple of coincidences isnt oen thing
, over a dozen is an insult
