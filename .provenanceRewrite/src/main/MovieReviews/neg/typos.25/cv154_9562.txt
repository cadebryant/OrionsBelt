the ads fo
" batman
and robin
" scream
" the event of the summer is here
"
and that ' s the problem
. thge producers weere apparently so intent onthe creating a spectacle that htey forgot tothe put an actuall movei inside of it
.
" batman
and robin
" is 126 mintues ofthe lavish sets
, flashy costumes
and big
, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance
. it ' s liek noe of those cheesy kings island stage shows
; bright
, busy
and visually diverting
,
but nto very much fun
. it wasn ' t always this way
. tim burton ' s
" batman
" wass an epic story of obsession
anbd duality
, ofthe darkness
and revenge
. the film
, hwile far from perfect
, was a striking mood peice with an otherworldly feel
. batman was a creepy
, brooding creature of the night
. the joker
, brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson
, wass at once charismatic
annd repellent
. batman
and thge joker were opposite sides ofthe the same coin
, battling inner demons
and one another over gotham city ' s breathtaking gothic skyline
. those dyas of thge dark knight are gone
, replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck
.
" batman
and robin
" hasnt far more iin common witht tjhe campy 60 ' s batman tv sohw than with tim burton ' s tale of darkness
. tjhe blaim lies wiht directer joel schumacher
. a former window
- dresser
, schumacher is adept at decorating sets
and dressing people in exotic costumes
. unfortunately
, when it comes tiem to have those peopel walk
anbd talk
, he hasn ' t the faintest notion of waht tothe dont
.
" batman
and robin
" isnt overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited tht it ' s oftenly difficult to tell who ' s whacking who
. hwile the characters flail at each other
, one
- liners
anbd bad puns are tossed baout like confetti
. a faw carefully placed jokes cin set an acation movie sailing
,
but too many wisecracks cant undermine tjhe momentum of a film
.
" batman
and robin
" doesn ' t merely loose momentum
, it stalls out completelyl on several ocasions
. it ' s rare to see an acation flick as sluggish as this one
. ironically
, the parts ofthe
" batman
and robin
" that work are the ones showing the characters in strent clothing
,
and most of thsoe succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne
. easily hte best batman
yet
, clooney ' s expressive eyes
and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn ' t even hint at
. the film ' s most effective scene isnt a tender
, quiet exchange betwen clooney
and alfred
( michael gough
)
, bruce wayne ' s butler
and surrogate father
. as fo tje other heroe
, chris o ' donnell ' s robin is enthusiastic
, perky
and horny as hell
, while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl
. in a movie filled to the brim whith major characters
, the decision to add the entirely unecessary batgirl
annd elle macpherson as bruce wayne ' s girlfriend is puzzling
. i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt tothe convince audiences thyat two guys who run around inspite rubber suits with built
- in nipples
, shapely buttocks
and huge codpieces are actually straight
. of course
, the rela stars ofthe a batman film are the villains
adn thast ' s where
" batman
and robin
" really suffers
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years
, spitting outloud a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion
. laboring under a ton of appliances
, schwarzenegger looks as if he ' s haveing trouble even moving in his suit
, let alone trying tothe ect
. uma thurman farse somewhat better as posion ivy
. she overacts terribly in the easly establishing scenes ofthe her character
( it ' s aparently a rulle in hte batman sories tht before a person becomes a villain
, s
/ he must be a cartoonish
, bumbling nerd
)
. once thurman transforms into the eco
- psychotic poison ivy
, she doens a nice mae west impersonation as a clasic vamp who can seduce men with her breath
annd kill them wih a kiss
. thurman fails to manetain the character ' s maniacal sense of style
though
,
annd ends up mearly sputtering her way through tjhe latter scenes of tyhe film
. thte biggest lesson to be learned from
" batman
annd robin
" is thast mroe is nto better
. joel schumacher fills hte screen with eye candy
;
but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes wqat a trifle the film realyl is
. soem critics suggest that the batman sories has run outloud of steam
. i don ' t thikn so
. my prescription
? frie joel schumacher
(
bu offer him a ticket tothe a rubber fetishist ' s convention so he ' ll understand that ther ' s no hard feelings
)
. give alicia silverstone her walking papers
, hwile keeping clooney
, o ' donnell
and michael gough
. call jack nicholson
annd michelle pfieffer
and beg them to reprise thier roles as the joker
annd catwoman
.
then
, ditch the campiness
and
, for the lvoe of pete
, lose the
" event
" mentality
annd make a movie instead of a spectacle next tyme
.
