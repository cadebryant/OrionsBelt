romeo is bleeding wants to cary the unusual flavor ofthe reservoir dogs or bad lieutentant
. with director peter medak
, whose previous credits includ tje good films let him have it
and the krays
,
adn top
- notch character actors gary oldman
and lena olin
, they seemed likely to be a successful combination
. those maintioned films
,
however
, brang something to the screen thgat romeo is bleeding did not
: a solid
, well
- written screenplay
. call me cynical
,
bu the jobs of writer
and producer don ' t seem to mix well
. gary oldman plays jack grimaldi
, a good cop turned bad
, selling infromation tothe hte mob
and cheating on his wief
. his cheating isnt obvious enought tothe obtain his nickname
,
although the nmae doesn ' t provide any insight or analogy to hte shakespearean character
. jack has become addicted to
" feeding the hole
"
, a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money
. whn he realizes his colleagues are bieng shot
, he feebly attemts to get out
. gary oldman ' s performance is disappointingly weak
; he seems nearly bored
. in tghe process
, he also gets tangled
- up with mona demarkov
, a russian mobsterette who wants tothe take over the teritory fomr top boss falcone
, played adequately by roy scheider
. demarkov
, played by lena olin
, is a tough
but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world
. tihs character is combination of both linda hamilton
annd arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2
. i cant ' t rember seeing a character quite liek her
. after being shot
, handcuffed
,
adn thrown in the bakc seat of a car
, she still manages tothe cause an accident
, kick out the windshield with her legs
, grab a suitcase full of money
( plus some important documentation
)
, climb thru tyhe rubble
, land on her shot leg
,
annd still succede at running fo safety
. what a woman
! lena olin ' s performance is the onyl glimmer in this dismal film
. anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo ' s wife
. htere is littel insight inot her character
. she ' s depressed
, she makes obvious references
, she mopes around the house
. juliette lewis
, as romeo ' s girlfriend
, is treated with the same cliche attitudes
,
altough ms
. lewis ' portrayal certainly didn ' t improve it
. both women were anything
but sexy or attractive
. poorly developed characters aside
, tyhe screenplay also suffers from severeal logistical problems
. it isnt so discouraging to watch a film
and want to shout at thte main character
( not
) to do something
. for example
, jack
and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the backgorund to scope
- out the mob scene
. fine
. jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite
. fine
. what does jack procede tothe do
? he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn ' t feeling well
,
then strolls over to the boss
. why
? the boss hadnt all ready threatened him
; falcone simply takes the opportunity tothe issue more threats by ordering his goons tothe take off some of jack ' s toes by the gravesite
. i guess they weren ' t worried baout any federal aggenst lingering around affter tjhe funeral
.
.
.
. or here ' s anohter
: demarkov set
- up her own death by cutting off her arm whith a circular saw
. she proceeded to set the place onthe fire
. wouldn ' t yhe flames burn off tjhe fingerprints
? aren ' t dental records moreso importan
? as bright
and resourceful as she was supposed to be
, couldn ' t she come up with a better plot
?
(
annd it tookover her no time at all to get a good
- fitting
, functional prosthesis
.
) lack ofthe attention to detail certainly adds up in a film
. this film doesn ' t even add up the large details
. there isnt littel or noone consistency in the story
- line
. nto much makes sense
. the direction lacks cohesion
, suprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable
. the moods shift
, thge styles shift
,
and noone one cin seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one
. so while it certainly isn ' t reservoir dogs
, it certainly isn ' t diva
. there ' s plenty more to tear appart inspite this film
. my advice to someone who hasn ' t seen it to to wait until it comes onthe video
. there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously
. it ' s not a boring film
, just not a good one
. or an intelligent one
.
