one ofthe the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenly
- acclaimed directer sidney lumet ' s
" gloria
,
" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film
, had absolutly no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre
. suddenly
, i realized that usance i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before
, i had not throught once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in
. when a movei is over
, aren ' t we supposed to think about it forthe a while
,
and ahve a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with
? i throught so
,
bu
, for one
, i saw this particular picture by myself
,
and
# 2
, even if i had been with someone there wouldn ' t ahve been anything to talk about in the first place
. to be sure
,
" gloria
" begins with a stiring
, rather poignant prologue in which a seven
- yearm
- old boy ' s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters
, in search of a disc his father hadnt iwth incriminating evidence on it
. right before thte men baroke in
, of course
, his father gave him the disc to escape witht
. eventually
, the boy
, named nicky nunez
( jean
- luke figueroa
)
, is caught by the mobsters
,
annd taked back to their aparment
. meanwhile
, gloria
( sharon stone
) has just gotten outloud ofthe prison for a crime she didn ' t commit
and returns to her ex
- boyfriend
( jeremy northam
) tothe recieve the mnoey he promised her forthe covering up his crime
. whn he refuses to give it to her
,
annd
then hears the group of men tlaking about killing nicky
, she leaves withthe him in order to save his life
,
bu not befoer holding the men at gunpoint
, stealing all ofthe theri money
,
and forcing them tothe strip nude
. gloria is the type of fast
- talking
, smart
- mouthed new yorker who allways seems tothe get involved with tghe wrong peopel
,
anbd she never expected to be stuck with a kid
,
but she has a heart of gold
( don ' t they always infront this type of movie
)
and is only trying tothe protect yhe boy
, whom she quicklyu begins to form a close bond iwth
. the previous incarnation of
" gloria
" by cassavetes
and starring the luminous gena rowlands
, remains unseen by me
,
but was noone doubt superior
, even
though i can ' t really imagine how this considerably dull sotry could be tranformed into an entertaining one
, reguardless of tghe director or stars
. there is noone doubt iin my mind that directer lumet has stuck closley to the original
,
but the film itself is simpley lifeless
, with only an occasional laugh popping up here
and ther so that it isn ' t completly unbearable tothe watch
. i liekd
, for exemple
, a very funny climactic sequence where gloria isnt deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at
,
and keeps turning the car aroud
,
thne driving a little ways
,
then slamming on the brakes
and turning around again
. these bright moments
,
howver
, appear long
and far between
,
and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky
and gloria
, which is both painfully predictable
and by
- the
- numbers
. throughout
, my mind was repeatedly asking the question
,
" who really cares
?
" as gloria
, sharon stone has adopted an over
- the
- top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn ' t soudn realistic at all
. inaddition hte beginning
, in fact
, i wass amazed at how amateurish stone ' s performance was
,
but as the film progressed she got better
.
although not oney of her better turns
, stone does have a comic flare tyhat refuses to be ignored
. jean
- luke figeroa was fine as nicky
and a littel more natural than tghe usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag
. all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted
, none more tahn cathy moriarty
, an intertaining actress in her own right
, who isnt billed fourth
and has all of one scene
, as gloria ' s freind whom she turns tothe for help
. sony
, tjhe studio that released
" gloria
,
" obviously doesnt not have any faith in tje film
,
adn i don ' t blame them
. they declined tothe screen yhe picture forthe critics
, whihc is never a good sign
, particularly iwth the high
- profile people involved
.
although how much mney a movie makes does not determine how good it is
( jsut look at the spectacular
" infact dreasm
,
" whic failed tothe even make tjhe top 10 last week
)
, i have a suspicion
" gloria
" isnt gogin tothe vanish from theaters faster thna
" ishtar
,
" judging ffrom the opening night 7
: 00 p
. m
. showing i saw it at
, where there were baout ten to fifteen peple present
, counting mysef
.
although stone cxan be an impressive actress
( just watch her in 1995 ' s
" casino
" or 1996 ' s
" lastest dance
" if you don ' t believe me
)
and sidney lumet can be a respectable director
, there is no reasoning forthe why htey thougth the cliched story of
" gloria
" ws worth remaking or
, for that matter
, why columbia pictures agreed tothe finance it when tehy coudl hvae been making a picture that actualyl looked liek it might have an inkling of a chance tothe be successful
.
