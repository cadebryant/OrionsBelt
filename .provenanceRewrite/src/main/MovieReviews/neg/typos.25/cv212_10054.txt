capsule
: not as bad a sequel as crowm 2 or batman
& robin
,
bu still horribly putrid
, cheesy
and ill
- conceived
. htis one belongs in saterday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: you know
, baout halfway through this movie
, i realized that if you hacked out everything exept the fight scenes
, you ' d have a damn fine 35 minutes or so ofthe flashy
, hong kong style martial arts
. beautifuly choreographed by robin shou
, who also plays liu kang
, the fight scenes are both mind
- blowing
and graceful
, acrobatic anough to amking olympic gymnasts weep
. tihs is what made the originnal so fun
,
but unforetunately for the sequel
, we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson
. instade
, they got john r
. leonetti
, the cinematographer for tghe original mortal kombat
. not a ogod choice
. while the fight scenes are brutal
and eye
- popping
, the rest ofthe the movie looks liek standard made for tv fare
. the acting is sub
- par
, wich i could endur if it weere not for a
.
) yhe director ' s style
, b
.
) the spacial effects
,
& c
.
) the treatment of the story
and characters
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti should go back to lighting
, in my opinyon
. i could say dozens ofthe bad things about him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he hasnt no eye for action
, he can ' t get even mediocre performances outloud of actors
,
and so onthe
.
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody can now fly
. hell
, i ' m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick
and whatnot
,
but nto when it happens eveyr faw minutes
,
and is done so poorly
. better jumping
and acrobatics has beeen seen in xena
: warrior princess
. in short
, they should have gotten paul anderson bakc
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike the first one
, whose sfx were vibrant
anbd somewhat realistic
, mk
: a ' s special effects are bland
, fake looking
,
and overall just plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times thyat blue
- screening was painfully obvious
. had this movie beeen made in the 80 ' s
, it woudl have beeen ground
- breaking
.
bu inaddition today ' s inudstry
, it doesn ' t even look finished
. c
.
) now for the
_ really
_ bad parts
. i admit
, i ' m an avid fan of the mortal kombat series
. the games are amusing diversions
, an easy way tothe work off stress
and anger
. the first movei was a mindlessly fun thrillride
. thsi could have been a really cool movei
. it isn ' t
. the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower thge target audience from teens to preschoolers
. some ofthe tyhe plot elements are jstu plain stupid
. how stupid
? take
, fo instance
, how our heroes move around
. they ule giants spheres teh roll around undreground
, supposedly at thousands ofthe miles per hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse is the treatment of secondary characters
. blink
and you ' ll miss ' em
. most characters had more depth in the video games
. if ytou thought batman
& robin was bad about this
, you ain ' t seen nothin '
yet
. a ogod 75
% ofthe the characters are introduced
, kick somebody around a bited
,
hten either die or are forgotten baout
. htere ' s no explanation at all for this
.
anbd for the fianl blasphemy
, the fight tyhat all thge fans were waiting rabidly fo
, the fight hyped tothe be the most intricate ofthe thte movie
, lasted about 3 minutes
and
then just sort ofthe
.
.
. ended
. it almost made me weep
. to sum it all up
, rent it onthe video
,
and fast
- foward through everything except thte fight scenes
.
