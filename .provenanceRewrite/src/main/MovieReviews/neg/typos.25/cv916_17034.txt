ah
,
and 1999 was gonig along so well
, too
.
" she ' s all that
" has the dubious distiction ofthe being the worst movei i ' ve seen so far htis year
.
and qutie frankly
, i doubt i ' ll see anything equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don ' t see anything equally bad
)
.
" she ' s all that
" tells the stor of the most popular guy in skool
( plyed by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet tothe tranform the geekiest girl in school
( rachel leigh cook
) into the most populer
. that
, right there
, is problem
# 1
. how many times have we seen thsi storyline
? as cook comments near tghe end of the film
,
" it ' s kind of like
" pretty woman
"
, except without the prostitution
"
. of course
, had thge filmmakers attemted to try something new with this material
, the well
- worn storyline owudl have been a device to propell the movie forward
. as it is
,
though
,
" she ' s all that
" relies
* completely
* on the lame
annd overused forumla to push it ahead
. there ' s not one original or interesting character in the film
, either
,
and if thta wasn ' t bad enough
, there ' s nto one ogod performance featured
. hte star ofthe the movie
, rachel leigh cook
, is simply horrible
. i usually don ' t like tothe git so personal
,
but inaddition this case
, i think it needs to be said
. cook wears the same expression throughout the flick
and looks tothe be haveing as miserable a tyme as i was
. i was never convinced that she wass a
" nerd
"
,
annd her transformation was unconvincing
and unnecessary
. the movie seems to be saying it ' s better to be popular than to be who you are
. as for freddie prinze jr
.
, an actor i ordinarily enjoy
, he too is quite bad here
. he coasts through the film on so
- called charm
,
and never estabishes a real character
. kieren culkin isnt here
, too
, as the brother ofthe cook
.
adn for soem indiscernable reason
, he ' s got hearing aids
. no explanation isnt given
and they ' re never brought up
. weere we supposed to feel
* sorry
* for him jstu because he wore hearing aids
? i don ' t think so
. that single element ofthe the film was one ofthe the most offensive thigsn i ' ve seen in a movie infront a long time
.
" she ' s all thast
" sucks
. thast ' s what it boils down to
. it ' s not entertaining
,
anbd it ' s not even a good time passer
. thge hour
adn a half runnung time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair
- removal system informercial
.
and what ' s worse
, it sends out a bad message to teens
. it appears to be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn ' t matter if ytou ' re happy the way you are
. that ' s unimportant
. if you want to
* truley
* be happy
, dress iin the latest fashions
and act like a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
