capsule
: combine oen quart of raiders of the lost ark
, a dash of a jackie chan movei
( sans jackie
)
, two teaspoons of gun
-
and swordplay
,
and a dollop of cgi
. simmer for 100 minutes
. yields
: zilch
. the phantom is a depressing
adn tired retread of so many earlier
, better movies that after the fifteen
- minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud
. it ' s hard to make a ogod action
- adventure movie that doesn ' t simply recycle its predecessors
,
and i ' ve seen movies that even at least did tghe recycling gracefully
. thge phantom
, allegedly based on the long
- running comic of the same name
, doesn ' t even bother to be graeful
. it ' s a stupid
and incompetant movie in too many ways to list
,
but i ' ll try
. the film opens up with a
" prelude
" sequence that looks like it ws slashed tothe ribbons in the editing
anbd
then given a heavy voice
- over tothe compensate forthe whatever got thrown out
. we go ffrom there tothe a jungle sequence that
, i swear to god
, recycles the truck
- chase scene ffrom raiders of the lost ark note
- fo
- note
, possably even shot
- for
- shot
, right down to the moent where indy wrenched open the doorjam
and slung one ofthe thte drivers out inot the brush
-
-
and
then goes on tothe rip off the rope
- bridge scene from
" sorcerer
" as well
! sorcerer
, as you may well remember
, was a remake ofthe a french movie
, teh wages of fear
, in which a bunch of lowlifes were paide piles of mney to drive a truck loaded with nitro thru horrible jungle terrain
. both versions of thta movie were far moreso interesting thna tihs flick
,
bu i ' ve got my job tothe do
, so back to thge salt mines we go
. anyway
, thge cinematic theft doesn ' t stop htere
. or at least the lack of inspiration
. there isn ' t a single thing here we haven ' t seen
,
and it ' s not given tothe us in a way that remotely evokes our interst
. we have
( where ' s my list
?
) a bad girl
, a tough good girl
, a secre cave hideaway
( which seems inspired more by dr
. no tahn anything esle
)
, a boardroom meeting that drips with greed
anbd venality
, magical artifacts of terrible pwoer
,
and cary
- hiroyuki tagawa wasted iin another stupid role where he gets tothe wear a fu manchu mustache
and sneer a lot
and generaly humiliate himself
. what else is there
? the plot is a waste of tiem
. the sets alternate between big
but hokey
-
-
and tiny
anbd still hokey
. there are lines in the script taht are just beggin to be mst3ked
-
-
and i ' m sure once mike
and the ' bots get tghe cash
, they ' ll stick it onthe their sked
. tjhe onyl thing inspite the movei worth noting isnt billy zane
-
- he ' s a good actor
,
anbd he tries very hard
, even when teh script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another
. all i can sday isnt that i pray this isn ' t hte beginning of the end for him
-
-
although it sure looks liuke the final nail in thge coffin for the comic
- book super
- hero movei
.
