movies can do the two big es very well
: educate
and entertain
. inwhich the best of all possible worlds
, tehy accomplish both
. on thte red planet
, they fail entirely
. inthe the near future
, a manned mission isnt sent to mars tothe observe primitive plant groth
. this film does a remarkable job ofthe demonstrating exactly how exicting watching algae grow would be
. after some mumbo
- jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth
and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet
, the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does
. the ground crew of people you couldn ' t care less about is trapped on the surface without food
, water or air
and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog
. the oney potentially interesting character
( carrie
- anne moss
) spends her time alone in tghe orbiting ship tlaking to a computer
. attemting tothe graft
" 2001
" esque space mysticism with
" terminator
" robot horror
, first tyme director antony hoffman can ' t seem to figure out what ' s gonig on
. neither can we
. didn ' t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting
and make sure there was a coherent story
? couldn ' t he have utilisied the mony saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter
? htere are so many mis
- steps
. eveyr opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes
and lacklustre direction
. why introduce the theme of faith vs
. science if the crewman who could comment on it dissappears early onyl to dieu
_ offscreen
_
? the audience beggins the film waiting forthe something to happen
. two horus later
, they ' re still waiting
. despite our greatest hopes
, there is no life on thge red planet
