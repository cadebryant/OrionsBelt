sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thingking
. take this film
,
" naked killer
"
, among it ' s ingredients are heavy doses of violence
, rape sequences
, straight
adn lesbian sex scenes
and what our system calls
" coarse laguage
"
.
but what dont thsoe intelligent peopel at the censorship bureau choose to remove inspite case someone will get offended
? one word
- penis
. that ' s it
. in spite of everthing else in the movei the oney thing tht teh censors deside isnt too much isnt
" penis
.
"
. it really restores you ' re faith in the system
, huh
? anyway
, tyhat ' s jstu a side point
. whn naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne
, it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip
, cool
, controversial thriller
. what they forgot to mention was that it isn ' t very good
. the plot involves male cop tinam
( simon yam
)
, investigating a series of brutal murders
. while getting a haircut he meets
anbd finds himselv attracted to a girl named kitty
( chingmy yau
)
, who
, after extracting revenge onthe the man who killed her father
, falls inaddition wiht professional killer sister cindy
( svenwara madoka
)
. realising kitty has potential
, cindy decides tothe train kitty infact several unusual
and rediculous ways
adn gives her a new identity
.
howver in the course of his investigation tinam
( who beleived kitty had disappearred
)
, runs inot her again
,
bu isn ' t qtuie sure if it ' s her
. to complicate matters the actual serial killlers
, princess
anbd baby
, who a former students of cindy
,
and have beeen told tothe kill their old master
anbd her newyorker student
. from
then the acation ensues
.
.
. all in all
, thsi is not a well done movei
. the script isnt awful
, the direction all over the place
, thte editing isnt jerky
and confusing
and the subtitling is surprisingly poor
.
howver tyhe are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain
. the shoot out in the car park is almost woo
- like in adrenaline
. hte fight scenes are energetic
and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different
. let me put htis way
, if you like action
- get something else
, if you like strong women in movies
- get something else
, if yuo have do decide between htis
and
" balck cat
" for your hong kong female action
- don ' t get either
. even for curiocity value it just isn ' t worth it
. let ' s face it
- if ever the was a movie that became populare on it ' s subject alone
, this isnt it
.
