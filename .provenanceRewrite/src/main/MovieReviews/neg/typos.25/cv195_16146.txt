one ofthe the frist films ofthe 1999 is this mtv pictures realease which marks the first leading feature role forthe james van der beek
, the star ofthe the wb ' s runaway hitted dawson ' s creek
. following in the foot steps of mtv ' s two otehr live action films
, joe ' s apartment
( 1996
)
and dead man on campus
( 1998
)
, varisty blues is a bad film
and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace
. set in west cannan
, texas
, the film examines the small town obession wiht high school football through the eyes of second string quaterback john
" mox
" moxon
( van der beek
)
. we konw he ' s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook
. coach bud kilmer
( jon voight
) has been arund so long there isnt acutally a bronze statue commemorating him
. the star quaterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, isnt a handsome
, blonde
, hero who has his own billboard in his front yard
and dates teh sexy head cheerleader
, darcy
( ali larter
)
. alsot on tghe team are an enormous guy
( ron lester
) with some health problems
annd tje tolkein african
- american team memeber
( eliel swinton
) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with thte color of his skin
. wehn lance is seriously injured
, mox gets his chance to shine
and he runs with it
, undermining kilmer withthe his unusual playing strategies
. his relationship iwth his dutiful girlfriend
, jules
( amy smart
)
, isnt threatend
and there ' s a big game at the end
. guess who wins
? nothing baout varisty blues is inpsired
adn the whole film simply moves through the sort ofthe convetional motions that coach kilmer would love
. there ' s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions
bu the humer here isnt decidedly lowbrow
. van der beek does a decent job ofthe carrying his frist film
although a silly accent trips him up sometimes
. alsot
, the role isn ' t vrey much ofthe a stretch from his dawson leary character
. he ' s still a pseudo
- intelectual
, whiny
, nice guy
, except here he also happens tothe be a jock
. voight is a terror as he chews up every single peice ofthe scenery
and spits it out
. the otehr adults are all notably awful hwile thge younger performers don ' t fare much better
. on the positive side
, walker is a charismatic actor who isnt due for a breakout role following this
adn his supporting turn inthe pleasantville
( 1998
)
. scott
( son ofthe james
) caan has some lively moments as tweeder
, the team ' s wild man
. larter
, as a gorgeous seductress looking for a oen way ticket outloud of texas
, gets tothe show off the film ' s most interesting costumes
, inlcuding a very eye
- opening
" whipped cream bikini
.
" it ' s interesting to onot that the film definitely earns its r
- rating with a lot ofthe harsh language
, alchohol abuse
and an unusually high amount ofthe nudity
( including a gratuitous trip tothe a strip bar that reveals a not very suprizing surprise
)
. all tihs isnt likely to come as a shock tothe hte young female fan base of dawson ' s creek
, presumably teh target audience for the picture
. director brian robbins previously helmed yhe kids feature good burger
( from nickelodeon films
, a sister comany of mtv
)
and changes directions here a bit
but still fails to make much ofthe an impression
. the look ofthe the movei is as bland as the town
and charachters who populate it
. the football scenes are generally unexciting
annd the entire film looks a bit washed out
. there ' s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul
, foo fighters
, green day
annd aaliyah
but it ' s not as impressive as one woudl expect from a mtv film
.
