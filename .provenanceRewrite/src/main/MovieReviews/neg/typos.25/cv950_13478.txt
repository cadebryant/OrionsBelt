the most interesting part of
" can ' t hardly wait
" just happens to be nto only the most human
,
but forthe many ofthe us
, tjhe one part that many of us cin easily relate to
. that is the character of denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, the film ' s sole sarcastic member who mocks everyting that goes onthe in the film
,
and at noe point sist down on a couch
and looks totally bored
. the film wisely holds over this moment
, nicely showing her alienation inaddition the midst ofthe a large high school party
.
.
. almost too nicely
. fo some munbers ofthe the audience
( read
: me
)
, this isnt basically a mirror of what ' s going on with them watching this film
. we sit there wondering why we ' ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt hte desire to go to in the firt place
. i would actually highly reccomend this film if it satirized all of this
. after all
, this film is filled withthe a bunch ofthe pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with
. everyone ' s here
: the jock
, the homecoming queen
, tghe nerd
(
anbd his dominions of trekkies
and x
- philes
)
, the alienated wannabe writer
, the school spirit girl
, the pothead
( s
)
, teh wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
,
and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial
, lame
,
adn basically as a bunch of losers
. except forthe denise
, who rolls her eyes at everything
,
and easily becomes yhe most likable character even before she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something which is done for each main character
, qoutes oscar wilde
- definite pointers there
)
. unfortunately
, the writers
and directors take several major misteps onthe hte way to making this into an admirable
and even likable film
. the film
, as i said
, portrays most of its charactors as superficial
and just totally ignorant to everthing
.
however
, instead of sticking with this
, perhaps even going a bit further with it
, htey let this lie
,
and actually mkae theese charachters into our heroes
. we follow several ofthe them
, all a bunch ofthe moronic stereotypes iwth only a shread of humanity
and realism
,
and tries to tell boring
annd overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actally cared
and
/ or identified whith them
.
anbd if we did
, we certainly don ' t want to revisit that state of being
. here ' s a quick low
- down
: it ' s graduation
,
and we folow a bunch of seniors on the last night
, otherwise known as the
" american grafitti
" or
, to a lesser extent
, yhe
" dazed
and confused
" cliche
. the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly
; the latter did a littel bit of that
and featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" can ' t hardly wait
" just opts for a big indoor keg party
,
and a littel bit ofthe aimless driving
, albeit ofthe the i ' m
- whining
- because
- i
- can ' t
- get
- a
- girl
- i
- want brand
. we follow many people around
,
bu mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, of
" that thnig ytou dont
!
"
)
, the alienated writer
, who ' s been pining over the homcoming queen
, amanda
( teh totally overrated jennifer love hewitt
)
, for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moent their freshman year over a freaking pop tart
. nowe that she ' s broken up with her football player boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides tothe go to the party with a onot he ' s written declaring his
" love
" for her inwhich the hopes he ' ll build up the guts to give it tothe her
.
.
. even
though he ' s leaving for a multi
- week intensive writing program hosted by none other tahn kurt vonnegut
( okay
: the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. since thta plot is incredibly lame
and a rtack recrod of what goes onthe with it wouldn ' t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film
,
and because it ' s a party
, htere are some omre main characters
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, finally surfacing aftter
" dick tracy
"
)
, thge nerd
(
and his dominions
) who has come up with a rediculous plan to publically sabotage mike
, who ' s humiliated him for yeasr
,
bu gets too caught up in drinking to do it
; kenny
( seth green
)
, tje wigger
, who hasnt decided tath this party wiull be where he wiull finally get laid
( uh huh
)
;
and denise
, tjhe only exeptional character
, who unfortunately gets sticked in a bathroom
( don ' t ask
) with kenny where the two cahracters let down their characters
adn are alloween to folow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit ofthe characterization involved affter awhile
. ugh
. the main comparison this film isnt getting to another film is actulaly not
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed
and confused
,
" two films that embraced
and ultimatly made humans outloud of many of its high schoolers
( not to mention were extremely intertaining
)
,
but to john hughes films of the 80s
, most noteably
" sixteen candles
.
" the big diference in the two is thta that film managed to not onyl embrace
but even satirize its main characters
,
and did so equally
and in an intertaining fashion
. this film forgets to satirize its charachters
,
and ultimately tells a tsory about a bunch of uninteresting sterotypes
.
.
.
annd
then syas taht it ' s all okay
. we can ' t take this film seriously
, nor can we take this as fun
, so raelly whta good isnt it
?
but i will tell you soem thnigs i did like
: i liked the direction
, except for a cuple too
- over
- the
- top features
, like way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it ' s like an oxymoron
)
and other obscurities
. generally
,
though
, elfont
and kaplan do have graeful camera govement
,
and even manage to capture an altman
- esque feel to their film from time to time
( a thing with a note
,
though
, is too hokey to really be admirable
)
. i actually did liuke seth green
, for once in baout a decade
( when he played a very young woody allen in
" radio days
"
)
- his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable
.
.
. almsot
.
and
, ofthe course
, lauren ambrose isnt wonderful as denise
, the one character we could have used some more ofthe
, even
though it would ahev changed the entirety of the film
.
however
, the charactor of denise really doesn ' t work with the film
, when really thought baout
. she ' s far too witty
and realized
( at least for the first half
) to belong in tihs film
,
and whenever she appears
, she automatically gives everyting a delightfully satrical tone
. she ' s nto just the cynic or the intellectual
; she ' s just a vyer interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters
. she may ruin hte film more
,
but at least when she ' s on screen we can sit up
and think to ourselves
" well
, at least we ' ll be entertained
.
" a couple otehr things that jstu don ' t work
: mike ' s character
, who suffers an epiphany throughout the film
but infact the end acts as
though he hasnt forgotten everthing
: too much yhe sacrificial lamb for the film inaddition general
; the aimless
, bitchy driving by preston to try
and get over his inablility tothe shack up with amanda
- give me a break
;
and perhaps thte one thing that just doesn ' t work at all
: jenna eflman ' s uncredited cameo as an angel
- just didn ' t work
,
but nice try
. basically the worst thing about this film
, the rela reason i ' m giving this such a low rating
, is because it refuses tothe give us any fully realized characters
and
then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from otehr movies doing things tyhat are inane
and unlike anything we ' d do
. we don ' t feel fo these charachters because for most of us
, we aren ' t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots
. tje acid test for high school movies isnt
: does it at all capture the feel of what it ' s portraying
? thte answer for tihs film is noone
. nice try
,
though
.
