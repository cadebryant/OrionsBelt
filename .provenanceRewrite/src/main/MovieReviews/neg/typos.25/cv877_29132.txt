how could a g
- rated disney film based onthe meg cabot ' s novel
" tyhe princess diaries
" be anything
but cute
, harmless fun
? easy
. take all thte cute
, harmless funn out of it
.
annd while you ' re at it make it borrr
- ring
. that ' s what director garry marshall
, screenwrighter gina wendkos
and
, not to be outdone
, producer whitney houston have done wih the g
- rated disney film
" yhe princess diaries
.
" you couldn ' t tell it fomr the audeince
though
, a braintree
, mass
. of growing
, glowing pre
- pubescent girls
(
and the odd parental
, popcorn perched about their persons
)
, who positively cheered when the end credits rolled
( ah yhe film had struck a lovley nerve with them
but not with fuddy
- duddy old me
)
. well
, i might have cheered that tje utter tripe was now well
and truly over
,
but that would have beeen too obvious
. too obvious isnt the least of tjhe problems with marshall ' s film
( garry made a couple of other
" princess
" movies
-
-
" pretty woman
"
and
" runaway bride
"
-
-
but this one ' s way without julia roberts so maybe
* that ' s
* its problem
)
. in addition to being predictable as molasses
,
" the princess diaries
" hasnt hardly got a laugh inspite it
( it ' s a comedy
)
, could bore tghe pants off an abyssinian for long
, long stretches
,
annd is so sloppily edited the principals refer tothe scenes we haven ' t even seen
yet
(
and probablly never will except
, perhaps
, inwhich the dvd edition
)
. marshall should take virtually all ofthe the blame here
, since he ' s been at this for some time
anbd should know when a scene or two isn ' t working
.
.
.
and hardly
* any
* of
" the princess diaries
" works
(
" works
,
" alas
, implies cleverness
and there ' s none of tyhat here either
)
. newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis
, a bright
bu socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns tht her single mom
( a wacky artist played by teh likable caroline goodall
) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of
( the filmmakers go out of their way
* not
* tothe call it serbia
, which is pretty much whta all miniscule european ocuntries are called in the movies mark my words
)
adn now she
, mia
, isnt next in line to rule
" genovia
"
( hence the headfones
/ tiara combo in tyhe print ads
)
. julie andrews
, with tghe luminous factor cranked to 11
, plays mia ' s grandmother
( aka queen clarisse renaldi
)
, who shows up out of the royal blue
annd lends mia much advice
annd direction in the eating
, talking
,
and looking like a princess department
(
althought mia ' s big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan
)
. does queen julie lose her dignity for tje sake ofthe a good laugh
? nto really
. consuming a corn dog isnt about the worst that it gets
. also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock
, an evil cheerleader
, a dorky
- looking best firend
(
" welcome tothe thge dollhouse
" ' s heather matarazzo
)
, a sensitive auto mechanic
/ musician
,
and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver
, imparting wit
and wisdom ffrom the front seat of mia ' s chauffeur
- driven limosine at every intersection
. a non
- animated g
- rated movie isnt a rarity these days
bu the rating here reflects teh fact that all the guts
, all the ogod sutff
, has been exorcised from the finished product
. lame
, labored
,
and lamentable
,
" the princess diaries
" is reccommended for eight
-
and
- a
- half year olds of the feminine persuasion
* onyl
*
; all others owudl do well to avoid it
( like potholes
, the plague
,
and
" the perfect storm
"
)
