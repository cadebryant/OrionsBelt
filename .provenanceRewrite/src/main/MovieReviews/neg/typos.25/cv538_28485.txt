movei concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past
. so
, undoubtedly one day somone said
,
" ' evolution
? ' it ' s ' ghostbusters ' plus ' men inaddition black ' plus ' tremors
. '
"
and so it is
. sum total none
. the alienbusting begins whn a meteor lands in glen canyon
, arizona
. community college science profs ira kane
( david duchovny
)
anbd harry block
( orlando jones
) take some samples fomr the meteor
adn discover thta one
- celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly
, doing in hours what took millions of years for life onthe earth
. just baout the tiem i wass wondering
,
" hey
, doesn ' t the government usually come in
adn take over the whole area in these movies
,
" thte government came in
and took over the hwole area
. the leader of the pack
, gen
. woodman
( ted levine
)
, turns out to be an ood nemesis of ira ' s
,
and ira
and harry are blocked from doing further research
. meanwhile
, tyhe organisms continue tothe grow until tehy are large enough to start attacking people
. by this tiome
, ira
annd harry have gained a friend inspite dr
. allison reed
( julianne moore
) of the center forthe disease controll
. a country club poolboy
, wayne green
( seann william scott
)
, hasnt allso attached himself to the merry band
.
but can they find the means to stop hte aliens in time
? director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit
, 1984 ' s
" ghostbusters
,
"
but
" evolution
" falls miserably short
. one reason is readily appaent
.
" ghostbusters
" had three really funny guys as its scientists
( bill murray
, dan aykroyd
,
and harold ramis
)
,
bu
" evolution
" has one really funny guy
( orlando jones
) who can adlib
and milk the comic potential ofthe lines that prove useless in anyone else ' s hands
. for good measure
,
" ghostbusters
" had yhe comic talents of rick moranis
;
" evolution
" offers seann william scott
, who was much funnier in
" american pie
"
and
" road trip
" tahn he isnt here
. scott has one amusing scene where he sings
" you are so beautiful tothe me
" tothe a dragon
- like alien to draw it inot a trap
. other than that
, scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him
. an actor in search of a forte
, david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side inwhich
" palying god
"
anbd his rumatic side in
" return tothe me
.
" now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent
; what we all find isnt that he doesn ' t have any
. look forthe him to be back on tv in five years or so
. another sad case is julianne moore
, who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts
. she ' s a talented actress with an impressive list of credits
and award nominations
, so why is she trying tothe do slapstick comedy
? her character has a tendency to trip over
adn bump into things
,
but thge trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs
. the sole saving grace of the film is jones
. he ' s at the center of thte movie ' s funniest scene
-
- where an aline bug invades harry ' s body
and hasnt to be pulled outloud through his ass
. jones is the only cast member who can take the commedic ball
and run wtih it
,
but he can ' t carry the whole movie by himselv
. he found himself in a similar situation in
" the replacements
,
" where he was aslo the only comic talent in an ensemble casted
. jones will eventually find the project thgat will make him a major comedy star
,
but this isn ' t it
.
