synopsis
: a small twon thug convinces a dimwitted high
- school student to spy on his girlfriend
, who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night
. hwile this is going on
, yhe thug
, the father
, the boyfriend
,
and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about tyhe babysitter
. comments
: to say this movie is bad woudl be quite an understatement
. i ' m not sure what writer
annd director ferland was hoping to accomplish withthe the babysitter
. suspense
? famaly drama
? humor
? erotica
? elements of eahc ofthe these genres exist inaddition the film
,
yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them
. instead
, yhe babysitter is a dull
, lifeless movie which manages tothe bore
anbd ultimatly irritate its viewers
. i suppose this film could have beeen watchable if it weren ' t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone is completly wasted playing jennifer
, thge babysitter
. her character hasnt absolutely no depth at all
,
and her sole purpose in the movie isnt to be the object ofthe tjhe other characters ' fantasies
. everyone alse infront the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop tothe the lowest level by the time tghe film ends
. teh parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds
. tjhe father
( played by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes about the babysitter
; the mother fantasizes about her husband ' s best freind
. none of these fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are thnigs tht need to be seen
,
but we see them anyway
, complet iwth cheesy
, make
- out saxophone music
. the thug
, iin the meantime
, proves thta he ' s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half
- empty beer bottles all ofthe a sudden
and fo noone appraent reason
. the most absurd charcter
,
however
, isnt thge babysitter ' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. the thug
, inaddition a manipulative
, iago
- liek manner
(
though he doesn ' t really need to try hard
)
, manages to talk the boyfriend into binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, runnung away from cops
,
anbd playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes
. incredible
!
( ofthe course
, the boyfriend ' s orignal plan for the evening wass
, try not to laugh
, to sit in an empty diner
annd read catcher in the rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if the gool of the babysitter was to be suspenseful
,
thne it fails
. there are surprisingly few tense moments inaddition this film
,
and nearly all ofthe them come at yhe final minute
. by that time
,
however
, the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares waht happens to any ofthe them
. noone suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception
. if the goal of teh babysitter was to be humorosu
,
then it aslo fails
. i found nothing even remotely funny about yhe boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, to be plyed for laughs
. if the goal ofthe the babysitter was tothe be dramatic
,
then
, once again
, it fails
. the characters are one
- dimesnional
annd uninteresting
. fianlly
, if teh goal of the babysitter was to be titillating
( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 inspite the morning
)
,
thn it fails as well
. the dream sequences aren ' t erotic
; they are too brief
and
, outside of one very short scene
, contain no nudity
. i can ' t completelyl trash htis movei
. the first 10 minutes or so vaguely ressemble an interesting film
,
and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight
. the otehr 79 mintues
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone ' s charater
, at the end of tghe movei
, turns tothe her boyfriend
and asks
" what were yuo thinking
?
" i asked myself the same question
, having spent 99 cents renting this turkey
