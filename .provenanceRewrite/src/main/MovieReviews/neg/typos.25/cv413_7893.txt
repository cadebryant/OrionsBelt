there ' s a scene somwhere in this film where one ofthe the characters reads the book
" screenwriting made easy
.
" this is funny tjhe first tiem jsut ' cause it isnt
,
but funnier as the film goes on since it ' s totally ironical since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it
, outlined it
and
then wrote thsi film
. it ' s like they took the sub
- genre of the disaster pic
, which can be funn
annd hokey at thge same time
,
annd
then forgot one ofthe the greatest parts of them
: tje stupid
, eccentric charactors
. yes
,
" the poseidon adventure
" is crap
,
but it ' s funn ' cause ofthe all the stupid
, eccentric characters
.
anbd
" earthquake
,
" my god
!
" earthquake
" hasnt got to be one of tghe worst movies of all time
,
bu at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold
.
" volcano
" takes a semi
- intriguing
yet stupendously inane plot
( a volcano noone one knew about suddenly errupts oen fine morning
and
then erupts agina later
then stops
.
.
. onyl it ' s in
, dabree i say it
? l
. a
!
!
!
)
anbd
thn puts no stupid
, stereotypical
, eccentric charachters in it
. they ' re just stupid
.
and the actors are all good ones
. tommy lee jones is great
, an oscar winner
,
annd a member of teh men in black
( my vote for what should be the coolest movei of the summer
)
. anne heche is a good indy actress
. don cheadle stole the disappointing
" devil in a blue dress
" from denzel ' s feet
.
and gaby ' s oen of the few ogod teenage actors
.
but they get nothing tothe do
but act dumb
and scream at what ' s goign on
. they dont theri best
, god bless them
,
but they ' re all lost iin the fake magma
( only don cheadle gets an interesting part
and he ' s the greatest part of the film
)
. there ' s no real suspense here ' cause you don ' t care about anyone
. i actually was rooting for gaby ' s character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn ' t hvae to keep saving her
( he doed it like thirty times
!
)
.
and ther are no interesting sites in l
. a
. that we see get destroyed
. part ofthe the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever
. in
" independence day
,
" the best part
( other than judd hirsch
) was watching the white house
and empire state bulding get blown up by the aliens
. that was cool
. watching really fake
- looking magma plow down tghe street is not
. okay
, so thte film ' s nto devoid of merit
. as i already stated
, don cheadle was great
and the cast does their best
.
and there ' s this relaly moronic scene which looks cool
. john carrol lynch
( norm from
" fargo
"
) goes on a subway car to save people
bu yhe lava comes
anbd surrounds it
. he hasnt noe guy who ' s wounded
and sould make it
. he coudl throw the guy
anbd jump
and still survive
.
but no
!
!
! he has to go
anbd inanely jump
anbd land right in the middle ofthe hte lava
. here ' s the cool sight
: he melts
. here ' s the dumb part of it
: he somehow manages to throw the man tothe safety as his legs are melting
. cool sighth
. no logic
.
bu cool sight
. yhe volcano erupts twice
and forthe some reason
, the film ends there
. they aren ' t worried about it eruting again
, they just go hmeo to thier toppled homes
.
but tothe tell yhe truth
, i ws glad they didn ' t go on
. i was hoping yhe film ws over aftter the first eruption ended
. my god
, it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film
. i haven ' t seen
" dante ' s peak
"
but i ' ve heared it ' s a masterpiece compared to this
. if you want to see a cool diaster flick thyat ' s inane
but intresting
, rent
" the towering inferno
" with steve mcqueen
, paul newman
,
and the schweppervescent o
. j
. simpson
( he saves a cat
)
. if you want to waste your time watching a boring
, stupid disaster flick
( literally
, it almost grossed half of its budget
)
, see this
.
but i warned ytou
.
