numberous comparisons can be made witht thsi movie to past sci
- fi
, suspense thrillers
. solider is a multi
? crossbreed between the likes of terminator
, aliens
and offspring
. the probelm with such mixed genes is that hte fianl product is a rela mongrel
? not well made
and should have been put down before production got off the ground
. besides this
, the action is mediocre when compared to the standard acation flicks of this day
adn age
. yhe fight scenes vetween jason scott lee
and kurt russell seem laboured
, slow
and sluggish
,
and could have done with better choreography
. russell who is usually a good actor in b
- grade acation ficks is unusually hampered by his character
? sereant todd
, who seems more like a sergeant toad
. besides having almost noone dialogue
, his charactor appears stunted
, zombie
- liek which is in line with his screen persona
,
but scores littel points of empathy with tyhe audience
. this movie has not made me change my opinion about directer paul anderson
, whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth
.
although tihs movie does not come anywhere close tothe yhe strangeness of former
, it is still a long way from anything considered desireable
