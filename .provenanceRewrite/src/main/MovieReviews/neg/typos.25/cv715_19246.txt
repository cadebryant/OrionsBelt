if you haven ' t plunked down your hard
- earned monay
yet for
" wild wild west
,
" tyhe latest summer holiday offering from wiull smith
, let me say right now that your mney will be better spent onthe a starbuck ' s frappacino or on a ben
& jerry ' s sundae
. these treats are great releaf from the summer heat
. in contrast
, this film made me simmer inspite disappointment
. i can accept the fact tht summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects
and taht good stories
annd flavorful characters usually take a bcak seat
. this wass true of star wars episode i
,
but at least in that film
, the story
and the charachters were still in the back seat
. in this film
, tehy are no where to be found
. what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers
and foppish aristocrats
, lots of female extras who look liek can
- cin dancers
,
and a clunky
, 80
- foot tall instrument of destruction tath resembles a mechanical tarantula
. twpo men are asked to stop this threat
. oen is artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventor who uses his intellect
and array ofthe disguises to best his opponents
. among his creations are false breasts
and tyhe bulletproof vest
. the other man isnt jim west
( will smith
)
, who prefers the shoot
- first
-
then
- shoot
- soem
- more method of investigating
.
although their individual talents must be combined to aciheve success
, their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate
, two
- man vaudevillian act
. for exmaple
, there is a scene where west
, being more debonair than thte reserved gordon
, notes that tje fake breasts should be filled iwth water rather than buckwheat
, which isnt waht it is currently filled with
.
" nowe touch my breast
,
" west syas
. gordon does so
and
then softly coos his approval
. i found mysef groaning at this kind of silliness
. the scirpt fails to ganerate any sense of drama
, humor
, or fun for that marter
. i did enjoy kline ' s reserved performance
,
but was surprised at how much lattitude they gave to smith
. could it be that will smith is just so bankable taht he ' s nto even recquired tothe act
? it was as if the director was yelling
" iwll smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
adn action
!
" here ' s an example
. in this scene
, will smith is baout to be hanged by a gropu ofthe angry white people
. he must endear himself tothe the crowd to escape
. the director yells
,
" will smith
, dont your pwn thing
.
.
.
adn action
!
" in anohter scene
, he hasnt tothe masquerade as a belly dancer infront order tothe save his comrades
.
" will smith
, dont your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" worse still
, the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess
. there are cogs spinning
and pulleys pulling
and levers going uv
and down everywhere you look
. there ' s ctually a lot of immagination at work infront this film
. htere are some genuinely clever inventions
and gizmos intruduced
,
but all of this imagination is wasted in a film taht is visually cluttered
and dramatically flat
.
and that ' s too bad because if there was more focuse onthe the story rather than will smith just doing his ' thing
, ' this film might ahve beeen palatable
. as it turns out
,
" wild wild west
" is the wild
, wild worst
anbd receives my vtoe fo biggest dissapointment of tyhe year
.
