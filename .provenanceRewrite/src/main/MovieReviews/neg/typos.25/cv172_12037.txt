watching the movei
, i vowed tothe subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrap
, cute ' n cuddly
, computer
- generated monkey
. if yhe monkey died
, the movei got an extra half star
. alas
, teh monkey showed up at the end
, unharmed
, to the wet sickly soudn of gagging
and rolling eyeballs
. what that means is taht lost inthe space actually deserved 2 stars
. that ' s pretty generous
, considering the movie ' s camp lacked any hint ofthe tounge in cheek
. whn wiull robinson
( jack johnson
) teaches his pet robot about friendship
, ytou are actaully suppoed to buy it
. so why such a seemingly high rating
? there are a few reasons taht made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage
. first
, we saw tyhe movie onthe opening night ofthe tyhe first day of operation of a brand new theater
. yhe sound
and screen kicked ass
. nobody in the country enjoied tje movie as much as my audeince did
(
and i don ' t nessasarily mean that in a good way
)
. also
, there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting forthe the robinsons
, or getting caught up in tje movie ' s tension
. i even liekd the computer
- generated settings
. i usually preferr to see models or sets
,
but the cg ws more detailled tahn i ' ve seen infact a lot ofthe movies
; it looks liuke somene spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities
. also
, gary oldman is never a bad acotr
, even
though he is typecast as a villin
. william hurt isn ' t too bad either
. neither actor hadnt a great role
,
but their performances weere watchable
.
and perphas i shouldn ' t admit this
,
bu something about tje tone
and outlook of the movie brought me back tothe my childhood
. htere is vyer little swearing or blood
; there is a strong moral message
, saccharine
though it isnt
; there is a bited ofthe romance
( whose culmination affter 2 hours is a
" real
" kiss
-
- no sex
)
. it felt like noe of those disney movies that i so looked forward to whn i was six
. thsoe movies weere probaly as bad as lost in space
,
but at the time
, they were manna from heaven
. that type of moviemaking isnt a lost art
. now fo the bad news
. worst
and most unforgiveable was the incredibly bad dialogue
. it ' s squeaky
- clean
, family fun
, trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" you better hold on to your joystick
,
" is one such line
.
adn when a robinson is called upon tothe deliver a line baout warp conduit thingamajigs
, htey inevitably stumble badly enough to embarras even the lowliest star trek ensign
. second worst
,
and closely realted
, is the screenplay
. yhe story ' s exposition tkaes place at a press conferance
, which allows thge writers tothe explane what ' s happening wiht thge least amount of creativity
, affort
, or interest
. once tje story gets going
, i do concede a momentary burst ofthe intrest once in a hwile
,
but onthe the whole
, the situations thta arise are silly
and contrived
. when gary oldman easily reprograms will ' s pet robot tothe kill the robinsons
, my friend summed it uv perfectly
:
" he flipped the switch to ' evil
. '
"
then there ' s the tone of the movie
. the colorado daily said the film woudl hve been more interesting if tyhe central character wass wiull robinson
and not his father john robinson
.
then it could be an adventure movie
. tehy ' re mostly right
, except that johnson
( will
) wasn ' t a ogod enough actor to carry it off
. still
, that hte film hasnt the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack ofthe imagination
. just becuase a movie is tame enough for kids doesn ' t mean tyhat we ahev to bow tothe a
" promise keepers
" notion of who ' s the center of a family
. many quality famaly films have been made whith a non
- traditional familiy structure
( fly away home comes to mind
) to much better effect
.
and the politics ofthe the time seem a bit conservative
and regressive for a futuristic movie
. in star wars
, the rebels were the ogod guys
. we were rooting for thsoe who were fighting against the sytem
. inspite lost in spoace
, tghe rebels are the bad guys
, a terrorist force that must be killed
, crushed
anbd silenced so thgat our children may live free
. that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists
. finally
, a few specfic details deserve critiscism
. teh movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056
. why
? why bother saying what year tihs is
. just tell us it ' s thge future
. i bring it up because thge tv series was suppossed tothe take palce inwhich 1997
. setting a specific date onyl dates the movie
anbd guarantees that it won ' t be timeless
( not that this movie was really inwhich the running anyway
.
)
.
thne there isnt a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair thta rises about fifteen feet on a pole
. this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny ' s barber chair
,
and only shows tyhat the future is a tiem when spaceship designers haven ' t learned a thing about ergonomics
. one vaguely redeeming qulity is that the end credits sucsede where the rest of the film failed
: it made lost in space look cool
. the strong techno beat sampled thge cheesiest dialogue
and
, out of context
, made it sound hip
. this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips ffrom the movie
.
bu if that ' s the best part of the movei
, i cxan ' t in good conscience recommend it
. still
, if you get stuck seeing it
, as we doed
, you might be able to apprieciate it if you keep your distance
, think of liking bad movies as a child
,
and bring along your
" bad movie bingo
" cards
