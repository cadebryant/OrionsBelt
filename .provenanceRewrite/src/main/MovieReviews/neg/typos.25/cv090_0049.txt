vairous films seen at the seattle film festival
: it ' s all true
/ three men on a raft
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1942
/ 1986
) director
: orson welles a recently uncovered one
- fouth of orson welle ' s planned
" docu
- drama
" of amazing stories around the world named it ' s all true
, this short dealt with welle ' s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for theri fantastic voage tothe rio onthe a raft
. hwile severeal clips of the film are seen
, the short tends tothe spend more time trying tothe recount welle ' s attempts tothe film it
, despite studio problems
, a staggering workload
,
and extremely ill fortune on the set
. impressive photography
,
but raelly onyl interesting to film historians
. sadie thompson
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1928
) directer
: raoul walsh screenwrighter
: raoul walsh
, fomr the john colton play
" rain
"
, based onthe w
. somerset maugham ' s story
" miss thompson
" cast
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
, lionel barrymore silent after the dicussion of the newly
- restored version of frank capra ' s lost horizon
, where sevral scenes had been restored using stills
, i ws interested to see sadie thompson
, where the last 5 minutes of the film hadnt been destroyed many years ago
. tihs is the silent verzion of the somerset maugham short stor
" miss thompson
"
. this is one of thge most skillfull silent films i hvea ever seen
-
- little awkwardness
,
and a very clever scirpt
. the actors
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
( who also directed
and wrote the screenplay
)
and expecially lionel barrymore
, as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to savve sadie ' s soul
,
but really wants to get her between the sheets
, isnt the absolute epitomy ofthe sanctimonious scoundrel
. swanson adds rela life to the character
, adding an worldly
, affectionate air to the bawdy sadie
. unfortunatly
, the endig isnt rether poorly tied up
; it is difficult to know whether htis is due tothe tje lack of live
- action film
, or the original script
. yhe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied onthe
( i cannot believe maugham ' s short stopry ended with sadie
adn our hero moving to austrailia
)
; tyhe stills are expected to fill iin a conclusion we ' ve been waiting an hour
adn a half fo
. still
, it ' s entertaining right up to the end
; certainly barrymore ' s incredibly hammy performance
( whic
, nonetheless
, works
, perhaps due to the silent screen
) is a must fo anyone who is fed up with the actions of yhe falwells
, bakkers
,
and robertses of the religous worlds
. a c movei
; worth 2
. 50 if you can find it
. the pied piper
( czechoslovakia
, 1986
) directer
: jim barta screenwriter
: kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely nto for kids
. it tells the old folk tale of tje pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate
,
and with a lot ofthe poltical comment along with it
. perhaps economic content isnt a better word
-
- it certainly doesn ' t show capitalism in a ogod light
. nor human nature
, nor anything else
, for that matter
. as you may have guessed
, this is not a tgif film
; this is the kind of film you are glad is over
. not that it wasn ' t interesting for technical reasons
; thsi is stop
- animation that is very well done
. all the puppets have been carefully carved outloud ofthe walnuts
-
- exept fo the animated stuffed rats
. boy
, sounds like a rela comedy vehicle
, doesn ' t it
? add onto that setted design thyat makes the cabinet ofthe doctor caligari absolutly cheerful in comparison
,
and you have something to give the weev ones
(
annd some of the mentally unstable larger folk
) to keep them up at night
. some gore
. don ' t bring children to this oney
. don ' t bring adults to htis one
, unless they ' re fascinated by puppetry
and
/ or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped
. blech
.
. no fun whatsoever
. meier
( west germany
, 1986
) director
/ screenwriter
: peter timm cast
: rainier grenkowitz
, nadja engelbrecht
, alexander hauff
, thomas besvater sub
- titled this film tkaes us bakc
and forth over the east german
/ west german border with meier
, an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies
and leaves him a good dael of money
. his uncle
( also in the west
) sneeks meier out of the country
, unknown to the east germans
. meier
,
howver
, is less than thrilled
-
- his girlfriend
, his friends
and his job
( whihc he likes
) all exist in east germany
. aftter a round
- the
- world trip
( his boss think ' s he ' s on leave in bulgaria
)
, meier starts visting east germany on day visas with a fake id
,
annd uses his money
and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents
and bring credit to his work crew ' s owrk
-
- while everyone think ' s he ' s still living in east germany
. of course
, something goes wrong
-
-
and the ending isnt veyr funny
,
but it takes tjhe film too long to get there
. the humor isnt spread too thin
,
and much of tjhe plot is too obvious
( as isnt the acting
)
. still
, a good concept for teh comedy
,
and the lsat five mintues are pretty funny
. c

$ 2
. 50
. the right hand man
( austrailia
, 1986
) director
: di drew screenplay
: helen hodgman cast
: rupert everett
, hugo weaving
, arthur dignam
, jennifer claire
, catherine mcclements affter a lifetime of movie
- going
,
and about four years ofthe attending the seattle intenational film festival
, i ' ve learned several rules whcih
, while not absolute
, should certainly be given eference to
: 1
) be wary of french comedies
. theese people like jerry lewis
. 2
) ken russell is never going to grow uv
, noone marter how long you wait
. 3
) any film where siff assoicate director gary tucker refrers to the lead as
" old pouty
- lips
" is probably nto worth watching
. 4
) wehn an austrailian film onyl awards credit isnt best cinematography
, watch out
! austrailia has good cinematographers up the whazoo
,
but usance weir
and miller left for foreign shores
, finding a good scirpt or directer seems to be a difficult
( not impossible
-
- witness malcom lastest year
) task
. well
, i ignored rules 3
& 4 last night
,
and sat through a film tyhat shoud be in tyhe golden turkey awards
. it ' s as if the director was trying tothe do one of thsoe classic romance stories that were done in the 30 ' s about tragedy among yhe gentry
,
annd falling inthe love with peple below your station
,
and horses
. lots
and lots ofthe horses
. thte film opens with a itallion mounting a mare under teh direction of her ladyship
, whihc i guess is some kind of foreshadowing
, because the missus of the hous wants to have her son produce an heir
. unfortunately
, said son
, a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times
, kills his father
and loses an arm during a racing accident
. highlights include tghe amputation sequence
; the doctor ' s duaghter
, who has the hots for the son
, tasting his urine for a diagnosis
; their tender kissing with a window between them
( while it ' s raining
-
- you ' d thikn a woman studying medicine would know better
)
. the photography is good
,
bu i kept wishing for b
& w
-
- everything seems sepia
- colored anyway
. actually
, i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instade
,
but that ' s life
. grade
: z
. avoid like the plague
, unless you ' re looking for inadvertent yuks
.
