mr
. nice guy is the latest jackie chan film
, so you shouldnt nkwo what to expect
. a weak plot
, terrible dialogue
, vyer little acting ability
,
but some jaw
- dropping action sequences taht nearly make the rest of it worthwhile
.
however
, mr
. nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie ' s best efforts
,
and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever
. jackie chan plays
, who else
, jackie
. this tiome out
, he ' s a famous chef who hosts an austrailian cooking show
. not that it ever makse a difference in tjhe plot
. there are only twpo scenes of him cooking
. for the rest of the film
, somehow he mutates into jackie chan
, supercop
. it never does explain why his character hasnt such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perhaps he ws in the smae cooking class as steven seagal in under siege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
)
and a local gang ofthe toughs
, the demons
.
although she only has oney camcorder
, somehow the result is full of close
- ups
and mutiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades of broadcast news
?
?
? anyway
, the goons discover diana
,
and will do anything tothe recover the tape
. here lies another crucial flaw in the story
: doesn ' t anyone relize you can copy a tape
? oh well
, no one ever said jackie chan movies hadnt to make sense
. as luck would have it
, diana runs across jackie
,
and
, wouldn ' t you nkwo it
, jackie accidentally ends uv with the tape
. tihs leads to countless chase
and
/ or fight scenes which look like htey could have been lifted from rumble iin the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie
. in a move apparently designed to woo american
(
adn other english
- speaking
) audiences
, the film uses english as its primary laguage
.
howver
, thast doesn ' t mean an end tothe the atrocious dubbing that hasnt afflicted jackie ' s recent americanized releases
. strangely
, many ofthe the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english
,
anbd poorly too
. whether this is just a very bad case ofthe looping
, an effort to minimize accents
, or a simple case of nostalgia
, it does cahieve tyhe same level of distraction presnet in all ofthe jackie ' s dubbed films
. the plot in mr
. nice guy is negligible
, merely an excuse tothe have jackie on the run from various goons
.
bu even
though plots have allways beeen second tothe tyhe acation inthe jackie ' s films
, it seems odd that the filmmakers have sticked us with this tired retread
. look
, if you have jackie chan playing a chef
, why nto use that tothe your advantage
? watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen
, beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds liek the perfect setup fo innumerable comic stunts
. the acation is a mixed bag here
. ther ' s realyl only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie ' s films
. it tkaes place infact the arbitrary loction ofthe a construction site
, apparently for the sole reason that there are lots ofthe nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan
. tjhe action in the film is neither jackie ' s best nor worst
,
bu you long for smoe moreso inspiration in the scenes
. the film ' s gratuitous uise of slow motion is distracting
. once or twice
, it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence
.
but to slo
- mo jackie running
? either tihs isnt a nod to the six
- million dollar man
, or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact thgat jackie may be slowing down
. if you ' ve seen all ofthe jackie ' s films
and are in need of another fix
, go ahead
and see mr
. nice guy
.
however
, if you ' re just inspite the mood for some good acation
, ytou ' d be better off hitting the video store for soem of his better work
, such as supercop
.
