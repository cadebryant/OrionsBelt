i guess that if a veyr wild bachelor party had gone really bad
, there would be broken furniture
, traces ofthe smack
and cocaine on the floor
,
adn a dead prostitute iin the bathroom
. i guess that if a movei had also gone really bad
, there might be tghe same elements pesent
. coincidence
? poor kyle
( a meek looking jon favreau
)
.
.
. he is baout to marry his radiant fiancee
, laura
( cameron diaz
)
.
but before he exchanges his vows
, he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one lsat blowout
.
but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get
. the prostitute has met a horrable
,
though accidental death
,
adn drugs are everywhere
. teh five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time
. a surprisingly calm robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, who looks like he ws groomed to make nefarious decisions
, ponders their dilemma forthe a few minutes before deciding tht the best thing to do is tothe bury the body infact the desert where she ' ll never be found
.
althought tehy stomach the gruesome deed ofthe getting rid ofthe the body
( which alsot disturbingly involves dismantling the body using pwoer saws in order to stfuf it inot suitcases
)
, wehn they return fomr their trip
, guilt
and paranoia beggins tothe set in which slowly consumes smoe ofthe the five firends
. one is adam
( daniel stern
) he grows increasingly agitated
. whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way
, his blood pressure increases
. or taht just may be because of his dysfunctional family
. another is michael
, who wass actully responsible forthe her death
. he tries to bury his feelings
,
but hte burden of guilt begins to affect his judgement as well
. boyd is the
? doer ' of the group
. seamingly sufferring from a long psychosis
, when he fiels as if his secret isnt baout to be exposed
, he is apt to take extreme measures tothe cover uv his tracks
. kyle just hopes tyhat his wedding will live up tothe laura ' s demanding expectations
.
then
, there ' s moore
( leland orser
) who speaks 5 lines
and walks arround with a puzzled look onthe his face
. the problem with this reprehensible movie isnt that it wants to be a cruel comedy
,
but it presents things inwhich a manner that just aren ' t funny
. drugs
, mutilation
,
anbd killing your pwn friends isn ' t something to be laughed at
. as a straight psychological drama
, i sould see how it might have worked
, as each one tried to maneuver
and overcome the weight of their own guilt in theri pwn sometimes
- sick ways
.
but this movei insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values fo 2 hurs
. if you do like this movie
, i don ' t think that i watn to know ytou
. i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his firends tothe choose not the right thing
but yhe
? smart play
. '
and diaz adds smoe brightness to this film as a wedding
- needing fiancee
.
but her talents are essentially wasted here
. it ' s obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certian tone
.
but tghe way that he chooses tothe do it is tasteless
. do not make a very bad decision by seing this film
.
