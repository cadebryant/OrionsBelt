1989 ' s
" major league
" was a delightful suprise
. i didn ' t expect much ofthe it when i desided to watch it onthe cable
,
but it proved to be fresh
and funny
.
however
, when hte appeal of a movie isnt its freshness
, the sequels are virutally guaranteed to be stale
. that ' s certainly true of
" major league ii
"
and the most recent entry
,
" major league
: back to the minors
.
" the title is
, ofthe course
, a contradiction
. shouldn ' t it be
" minor league
?
" that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer
/ director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie
. orginal stars charlie sheen
anbd tom berenger
( who returned for
" major leage ii
"
) are not around
, leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the thrid movei
. the other veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inspired batter cerrano
and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who was introduced in
" league ii
"
) seem to be around just tothe lend legitimacy to tje enterprise
. the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadcasting tjhe games ofthe a minor leage team far from his home turf
. tyhe protagonist this tiome arround isnt retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) to manage the twins ' aaa team
, the buzz
. yuo can rwite hte movie from here
: he finds a group of misfits who need tothe learn how to play together as a team in order to win
. there ' s a future superstar whose ego keesh him ffrom growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down ood timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( the difilippo triplets
)
,
and a couple pitchers with throwing problems
( judson mills
and peter mackenzie
)
. allong the way
, gus picks up cerrano
and tanaka
( gus is supposedly an ood teammate ofthe theirs
, even
though he wasn ' t in eather of the preceding films
)
. sum total
: none
. the entire enterprise is artificial
,
and the cast is not ready fo the hollywood majors
. gus ' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard is a slimy
, sniveling littel egotist
,
and the twins are lazy
, spoiled
,
annd full of themselfs
.
( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real
- life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner
)
. gus challenges leonard tothe a match
, the buzz vs
. the twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" bakc tothe the minors
" is a movie that hasnt no reason tothe exist
. there ' s hardly a laugh in it
, the cast is weak
,
and the first movei left no room for even one sequel
.
