htere are some pretty impressive stars inwhich lost in space
- it ' s just thyat none of them happen to be actors
. the stars i ' m referring to are the computer generated ones thyat make up the movie ' s
" outer space
"
; tyhe stars thta the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find theri way home
. yes
, in terms ofthe acting
, the star power is
.
.
. well
, moreso liuke a falling star
. kinda pretty
, short
- lived
,
adn pretty much dead
. lost inspite space
, as if you really didn ' t know
, is based on the 60 ' s sci
- fi television series of the same name
. it ' s the yearm 2058
,
and earth ' s prescious resources are quickly bieng usurped by tjhe needs of its massive population
. john robinson
( william hurt
) is thge scientist leading a mission program tothe colonize a foreign planet
. earth ' s entire existance isnt contingent upon a successful mission
,
but nobody
, whther it be john ' s famaly or hired battle pilot don west
( matt leblanc
)
, seems too enthuseastic about leaving their home planet fo several years
. john ' s family consists ofthe his wife maureen
( mimi rogers
)
, his atypical teenage daugter penny
( lacey chabert
)
, his ingenious son will
( jack johnson
)
,
anbd his beautifull scientist daughter judy
( heather graham
)
. despite everyone ' s reluctance
, the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth
adn makes its way inot the vast eternity of spoace
. unknown tothe anyone
but tje audience
, there isnt an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage hte entire mission
. dr
. smith
( gary oldman
) hasnt beeen hired by a group ofthe rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour
,
and dr
. smith hasnt re
- programmed a talking robot to
" destroy robinson family
"
! when everyting that could go wrong doens go wrong for both sides
, the spaceship isnt warped to an unknown destination
,
and now the premise of bieng lost inthe space isnt complete
. as for tjhe audiance
, you will likely be lost in boredom by this point
, wondering if the plot
, like tjhe jupiter 2
, will ever git off the ground
. it ' s hard to tell who deserves the most blame
- the incredibly bland
and corny characters or the horrifically lame script
? chabert is basically the only one to overdo it
, sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium
. if you
, liek me
, were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort ofthe plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens
, ytou ' re wrong
! that ' s jstu her normal voice
! inwhich
yet another example of a
" friend
" faltering on the big screen
, leblanc is so incredibly dull
and
yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming
( make sense
?
)
, it makes you wnat tothe shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod
. graham is a babe
- thank goodness there ws something for me to think about during this film
. hurt
, the balck hole of excitement
, sucks uv any energy that might have been left
. if hurt were available in tablet form
, he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill
. johnson isn ' t dull
, he ' s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody ' s ass all the time
. want an example of how cool this kid can be
? how about when he convinces tyhe robot to think with its heart
and reconsider killing tghe family
? hey
, don ' t laugh
- tje thign actually listened to the mr
. rogers
- would
- be
- proud sentiment
.
but alas
, if you thougth a character couldn ' t be much worse
, htere was rogers as tje epitomy of generic
( or
, mother as she was known
)
. why hire an actress
? htey could ' ve had a white cardboard cutout with thge owrd mom printed on it
. now taht woudl ' ve had smoe pizzazz
! lost in spoace luckily doesn ' t suffer in every single category that it could have
. yhe special effects are crisp
, clera
,
and at least mildly captivating
, unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman
, who plays his evil character with a great deel of funn
and finesse
. unfortunately
, oldman is locked away fo most ofthe teh film
, giving us nothing
but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy
. while hte special effects are pleasing tothe the eye
, htey are nothing you couldn ' t fidn infront most modern sci
- fi films
. contact
, forthe example
, far exceeds this film iin terms of imagery
and imagination
. lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work ofthe cinematic art
, with numerous contradictions
( the timne travel aspect was horribly flawed
!
)
, wooden
annd corny acting
, worse dialogue
,
and an endig so disappointing
, you ' d be happier to have seen tghe entire robinson family get blown to smithereens
.
then again
, with an ending like this film has
, it ' s obvious a sequel is already being considered
. what an awful note tothe end onthe
, knowing there could be more of this infront a year or two
. the attempt to be family oriented is commendable
,
bu lost in space is lost with the illusion that speshal effects
and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enought to satisfy all age groups
. well
, danger potential movei goers
! danger
! thsi movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity
.
