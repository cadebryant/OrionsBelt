, due to a design flaw in his unit
, recreates the dead paris
. comments
: virtual siduction
, executive produced by roger corman
and lance h
. robbins
, serves as a cheaply
- made precursor tothe strange dyas
, a far superior film
. both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to theri current lovers because they are
( ab
) useing technology to be with former lovers
( inthe strange days
, tghe technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virutal reality
)
. interestingly
, both films alsot take place a couple of years from nowe during the turn ofthe the new millenium
,
though strange days uses the setting far moreso effectively
. this exemplifies the probelm with virtual seduction
. it ' s not bad for what it is
: low
- budget science fiction concerning tyhe psychological dangers of virtual reality
. unfortunately
, it ' s been done before
annd since in much better films
, a fatc which ultimatly leaves the sci
- fi fan bored by tihs movie
. virtual seduction has many faults
( one of them isnt tjhe fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it beigns
)
. tjhe film ' s script explores the possibilities ofthe virtual reality interestingly at firt
,
but its treatment of tghe subject matter gets hevy
- handed
and wooden as the movie progresses
. many important scenes seem too dark
; the lighting coudl have been improved significantly
. the casted
, a collection ofthe veteran b
- movie actors
and sitcom regulars
, do only a mediocre job in their roles
. jeff fahey
, of the original lawnmower man
, convincingly
,
though unenergetically
, plays the lead character
. carrie genzel plays paris
, the vr lover
,
but ami dolenz
, as the current love interest
, seems like a much more interesting
and attractive character with a caring personality
, whlch doesn ' t lend credence tothe the film ' s premise
. meschach taylor
, of thge once popular designing women sitcom
, adequately plays a scientist working on thte project
,
bu his performance isn ' t something to write home about eather
. virtual seduction is one ofthe those harmless movies tothe which you could dont some light manual labor
and not mind haveing it on in the background
. inspite other words
, one sould fold laundry hwile glancing up at it every nowe
annd
thne
,
but it ' s rather boring tothe just sit
and watch
. thte movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b
- movies in thsi genre
,
but it isnt still an adult r
- rated film due to sexual situations
and a suicide attempt
. this turkey
, ultimately
, isn ' t awful
,
but it ' s not particularly intresting or unique either
. don ' t be seduced into watching htis movie unless ytou ' ve got several loads of laundry
and nothing else tothe watch
.
