whta would inspire someone who cannnot rwite or act to pen
and star in a movie
? a better question
, what woudl inspire a studio to produce said movei
? if you hvae an answer
, let me know
. foolish
, the new movie wroten by
and starring master p is a jaw
- droppingly horrible film
, one with noone redeeming value socially
, cinematically or otherwise
. comedically it has some potential
,
but onyl inaddition its stand
- up comedy moments
, which i can turn on comedy central for
. master p stars as fifty dollah '
( beated that
!
) as a mobster
( i thikn
) who is trying to strat a comedy club
/ act with his littel brother foolish
( eddie griffin
)
.
but the twpo of them have to deal with an angry mob boss
( plyed by andrew dice clay
, for the very first tyme entertaining
)
, a stubborn club owner
and family problems
( tje latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert ' s
" idiot plot
,
" if everyone here wasn ' t an idiot
, there would be no problem
) so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names
? not a hell ofthe a lot
. as i ahev mentioned
, master p cannot ect or write
. he acts liek the rapper that he isnt
. the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced
, as are his warm
and fuzzy scenes with his little bro
. as forthe his script
-
- well
, i suppose he delivers what one woudl expect from a musical artist witht no previous screenwriting experience
. if you haven ' t
yet figured it outloud
, that is not saying much
. co
- star eddie griffin
( really the star of tjhe show
) isnt quite a different story
. thge fact ofthe tjhe marter isnt tht griffin
, whose most signifigant screen outing to date isnt probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm
and eddie on the fledgling upn network
, is an extrememly talented comedian
, stand
- uv
and otherwise
. he has much in common iwth chris tucker
( rush hour
, money talks
) in how quickly
and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips
. he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity
( to the extent which that can be done
)
,
and hwile i hope that doesnt nto become his trademark it works in a few scenes in tihs movei
.
and indeed
, i laughed at a few stand
- up scenes here
,
bu from a feature
- length movie i expect omre
. foolish provded me withthe no reason tothe care for theese characters
. every scene whitch has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by eather a stupid joke
( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers
, foolish blurts out towards his jewerly
- sporting sibling
" ytou lay oney hand on me
and htis cemetary is going to be a gold rush
"
) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car
( tothe which i said
, a bit too loudly fo the occasion
" huh
?
"
) affter getting slightly upset wiht his wife
. believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard
- earned
$ 8
. yuo ' ll get mroe laughs ffrom watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virutally any sitcom if you don ' t have cable
. eddie griffin fans may enjoy tihs derivitive
(
allthough offensive
) yarn
,
but everyone else should stay the hell away
