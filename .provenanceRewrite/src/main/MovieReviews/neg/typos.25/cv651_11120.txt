the real blonde
( r
) a woman ' s face
, an arm
, some pumped
- up pectorals
, blond hair
, a man ' s sad face
, slender legs
, a random hand here
adn htere
. as the opening credits ofthe tom dicillo ' s the real blonde unfold
, these scattered
, fractured glimpses eventually come toghether to form yhe omage ofthe a bikini breif
- claded man on his knees clinging tothe a nurturing woman
, his head concealing her unclothed breasts
. if only yhe rest ofthe this formless
, aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a waiter
/ struggling actor too proud to take gigs infront commercials or soap operas
. he ' s feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live
- in love
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender
. mary
, a makeup artist
, regularly works onthe model sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
, who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney ' s the littel mermaid
. the bottle blonde hasnt a turbulent on
- again
, off
- agian relationship with bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
, a soap actor who yearns for the tast ofthe a real blonde
, which he finds in co
- star kelly
( daryl hannah
)
. as the film unspools
, a variety of other characters pass through
: fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
; mary ' s shrink
( buck henry
)
and self
- defense instructor
( denis leary
)
; joe ' s casting agent
( kathleen turner
)
and hardass boss
( christopher lloyd
)
;
and a mystery woman
( elizabeth berkley
) who keeps on crossing joe ' s path
. where exactlly does all this go
? that ' s a question best posed to writter
- directer dicillo
, who doesn ' t appear tothe ahve hte slightest clue himself
. his meandering
, largely unfunny script
and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers
, turning into dead
- end narrative streets onyl to reverse course
and hitted another creative cul
- de
- sac
.
and another
.
anbd anyother
. at one point bob
, frustrated with the soap scripts
, complains to the head writer
( jim fyfe
) that his
and kelly ' s cahracters keep on going infront circles
, wiht no hint of developement or growth
. that is most certainly teh case here
. joe gets a job
and ultimately botches things
; he
and mary bicker
; they make uv
, only tothe have the pattern repeat itself
. unhappy witht his bottle blonde
, bob gets his rela blonde
but is unsatisfied
; he returns to tghe faux
and is still unsatisfied
. if there isnt a point to all of this
, dicillo dances around it
, spending his time onthe apparet digressions thta
, as it turns outloud
, aren ' t digressions at all
. the real blonde isnt not without some amusements
. it does have the occasional funny line
and situation
; leary
, henry
, lloyd
, steve buscemi
,
and dave chappelle shine iin their small roles
; keener is a likable
, refreshingly earthy lead
; berkley ' s appeareance is mercifully brief
( she receives outrageously prominent billing
and ad placement for a ten
- minute role
)
;
and there is yhe irony ofthe having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who mkaes the ratings skyrocket
( lsat yearm
, the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months
-
- due to lack of viewer interest
)
.
but on the whole
, thge real blonde is a frustrating sit thyat lives up tothe the stereotypes of its title
-
- it may be glossy on the surface
,
bu there ' s nothing gonig on inside
.
