htere is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom
, surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong
- worded attack on a gropu of stoic doctors
. when i noticed thast yhe audience with whom i saw tihs film was reacting tje same way
, i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees witht me baout the quality of hte picture
. you see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries
. i hated this movei for eveyr second that i sat watching it
,
and i actively hate it now
, days later
, with the simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hate every element ofthe the film
, begining wih tom shadyac ' s shameless direction
,
adn all the way up tothe the misguided
and mishandled themes that teh screenplay wants so desparately tothe convey
. the badness of patch adams isnt stupefying
. it ' s confounding
. i can ' t believe a film can be this bad
.
and
yet
, it ' s based onthe a real man who probably has a ogod point tothe amke
. in the film
, patch is played by the undefeatable
and indefatigable robin williams
, in a performance ofthe such insulting pathos
and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he isnt even human
. in the beginning ofthe the film
, patch commits himself tothe a mental institution beccause he doesn ' t watn to kill himself
. hwile there
, he notices that thge doctors don ' t care baout the patients
,
and taht the best way to get through to tghe patients is to treat them like human beings
. so
, patch goes onthe a crusade to be a great doctor who accually talks tothe his patients
. he goes to medical skool
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
)
adn convinces him thyat it ' s good to help people
. he alsot meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, the anti
- male med student who jstu wants to go through the motions
anbd be a successful doctor
. naturally
, the dean of thte medical school
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
and wants to thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets the higest scores on all of his exams
. so patch decides that he ' s going to build a free clinic inthe the middle of nowhere to help peple with any problem they may have
.
and thast
, my firends
, is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture ofthe 1998
. on a superficial levle
, yhe film is nto particularly bad
: i wouldn ' t say the cinematography bothered me
,
and most of the performances seem tothe be exactly what shadyac was aiming for
( i actually liekd potter ' s performance
, even if she is wasted
)
.
but the film fails fundamentally in excecution
. every scene swells with grand
,
" emotional
" music
, played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard
. take
, fo instance
, the first scene
, which shows patch sitting on a bus
. we don ' t know patch
yot
,
but there ' s sad music
,
adn it ' s suppoed to mkea us really sad that he ' s sad
. later on
, patch makes a lot of progress
: he helps a dying patient
( peter coyote
) to enjoy the last days of his life
,
annd the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly thru the halls of the hospital is very lively
.
and when thyat patient finally dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, the music is very very sad
.
bu thte probelm with all of thsi is thgat the music should not be the center of the emotions
. rela drama is character
- based
. you grow to like someone
,
and
then something bad happens
,
and you feel it
. we don ' t ever grow to know the dieing patient
; he ' s simpley a vehicle for patch ' s greatness
. real drama doesn ' t seem forced
, or present just to amking thge audience cry
. that ' s why patch adams is not real drama
. it goes for every cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene
. even scenes taht have very little inpact onthe the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman ' s sickening muscial score
. sentimentality like this isnt indeed bad
.
but it ' s not as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. you see
, patch isnt a really great student
. he aces his tests wihtout studying
,
adn does it so effectively thgat people think he ' s cheating
.
bu patch doesn ' t think tht memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor
.
" why don ' t we see patients util the thrid year
?
" he bursts out every three seconds
. well
, patch
, that might have something to dont with yhe fatc that you ened tothe leran something before you go treating patients
. not everyone hasnt the capability of memorizing facts whith no effort
. most ofthe us have tothe study
.
annd a doctor who really wants to halp
,
but doesn ' t know a ote from a finger
, probably won ' t be too successful in preventing death
. oh wait
, i almost forgot
: the point of doctors isnt not just to
" prevent death
,
"
bu to
" improve the quality of life
!
" yes
! thgat is true
!
and you can nto do tyhat wihtout studing
. you can not dont that without going tothe medical school
. what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe
, just maybee
, it isnt a good idea to studdy first
and talk to patients later
. follow tje rules
? bah
! who needs the rules
! only uptight doctors follow the rules
. the rela saviors are the ones runnung around tyhe hospitals iwth big red spheres on their faces
annd sporting baggy yellow pants
.
annd
then there ' s tje free clinic issue
, which i find shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. in the middle of the forest
. where patients can be taken to be helped
. for free
. how will patients be transported to hte free clinic
? will it have an emergency room
? or isnt it just fo mental patients
?
and who
, may i ask
, will pay for it
? the film does give soem tolkein attempts to question patch ' s motives
( i think anohter charcter asks him how he ' s going to pay for it
, in addition tothe a little bited ofthe meaningless blather about hmos
and medical insurance
)
,
but they certainly don ' t explore or challenge patch ' s ideas tothe any meaningful extent
. reader
, please understand this
: i am nto making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams
. i knwo nothing about him
. if his beliefs mirror those ofthe this film character
,
hten i might like to haev an intteligent discussion with him baout them
.
but reguardless of what tyhe rela patch adams believes
, teh themes put forth in htis film are simplistic
and phony
.
and in tje last scene
, the big
, obligatory courtroom scene thta forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus
, patch does a lot ofthe shouting
. catually
, robin williams does a lot ofthe shouting
. he shouts a lot about helping people
,
and a lot of people cry beccause they are moved by his words
. i won ' t tell you thast you cin ' t be moved by his words
, because i
, too
, was moved by his words
. i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded ofthe how cheap
and phony a cinematic experience can be
. patch adams is tyhe cheapest of them all
.
