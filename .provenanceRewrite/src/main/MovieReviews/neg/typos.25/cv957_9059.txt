recently one nght a young director named baz luhrmann couldn ' t sleep
. he tumbled outloud of bed
and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour
.
thn he moved to his kichen where he spended the same amount of tyme eating spoiled food
.
then he tookover down a volumne of shakespeare ' s work
and read it cover to cover
- never really paying attension tothe hte words or plot
.
and
then
, as a climax
, he took outloud his video camera
and pressed the
" on
" button
. tghe result
? william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
- the worst film ever made
and a complete failure
.
though
, tothe be fair
, an interesting complet failure
. the idea at the film ' s core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds
. this is done by moving the camera around at a repid rate so that we can ' t see what isnt going on
.
adn filming the dialogue in voice over
.
and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model
.
and making the frome go still while flashing the character ' s nmae at the bottom
.
and filming long tedeous action sequences iin slow motion
. i mean
, man
, this isnt yhe 90s
, dude
.
howver i ' ve seen terrible films thyat are fun to watch
.
( examples are batman
and robin
and tyhe island of doctor moreau
.
) that rule doesn ' t apply here
. this is a film that takes itself seriously
. that is it ' s major fault
. another problem was pointed out by my friend
, alex
( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout
.
)
; the original play is a powerful piece ofthe work because the author remained nutral
and didn ' t take sides
. here it ' s claer thyat we are supposed tothe side with romeo
.
( just look at the way tehy film him
.
) from yhe begining he ' s our hero
and this doesn ' t wrok
.
annd dicaprio ' s awful performance doesn ' t help
. luhrmann never decides if he whants to entertain us or enlighten us
. the result is a mess
. you can feel him striving tothe be something he isn ' t
. he tries tothe pull of a mix inthe which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles
. he tries very hard
. key owrd
: tries
.
" oh look
, he ' s filming above water action from below
. pretty
. what does it represent
?
" why do peopel dont ugly things
? i scrambled awya fomr my tv setted feeling guilty as if i could never read hte play again
and keep a straight face
.
