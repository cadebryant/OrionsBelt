if onyl austin powers
: the spy who shagged me hadnt been just half as original
, zany
, silly
and totally enjoyable as its precedessor
, it woudl have easily beeen one of this summer ' s biggest pleasures
. if only
. inthe fatc
, the spy who shagged me isnt the excact opposite of tjhe original
; instead ofthe refreshing the audience whith noe clever parody aftter another
, the filmmakers bombard us with used
- up
, tired jokes taken directly from the frist one
. take the scene where austin powers
( again played by mike myers
,
but with only a fraction of tje giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously
) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff
. after being pushed off the ravine
, tjhe bad guy is of course assumed dead
.
bu suddenly
, we hear a pleading voice coming from down below
; he ' s only injured
. a simular scene played very well in the original interational man ofthe mystery
,
bu here i was insulted by it
. did teh filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip
- off
? aparently i overestimated the intelligence of the averege movie
- goer
, considering that the film hasnt pulled in over
$ 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone
. do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way
? having said that
,
though
, i still cannot deny the film its merits
. tghe basic plot was delightfully silly enough tothe sustain my interest somewhat
; dr
. evil
( mike myers
, inaddition tjhe second of his three roles
)
, having constructed a tiome machine
, goes back tothe the eyar 1969 in an attept to snatch austin power ' s
" mojo
"
( don ' t you just lvoe that owrd
?
) whilst he is cryogenically frozen
. when austin gets wind ofthe thsi
( aftter a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley ' s vanessa kensington
)
, he too travels back in time to re
- claim his sexual drive
, accompanied by teh hot
- to
- trot felicity shagwell
, plyed by heather graham
. this sounds stupid
, i know
,
but in the movie it starts to make some kind ofthe weird
, off
- the
- wall sence
,
anbd it worked for me
.
then there ' s mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a
.
.
. petite clone of myer ' s dr
. evil
, exactly 1
/ 8 in size
. troyer ' s persona alone gains the film an extra half
- star
, contributing tothe one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble onthe his own mini
- mr
. bigglesworth
. just try to ignore the fact that
, at 2 ' 8 ' '
, he owudl make dr
. evil ' s height rise to jsut over 21 foots
. no matter
.
howver
, there are only baout four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour
and a half
( the most noteable being yhe now infamous tent scene
)
,
annd that just isn ' t enough to warrant even a minor recommendation
. if there is in fact an
" austin powers 3
"
, they shouldnt just kill off secret agent powers
and put the emphasis on dr
. evil
and mini
- me
. unconventional
, yes
,
but htere ' s noone denying that it ' d amking forthe a better movie
.
