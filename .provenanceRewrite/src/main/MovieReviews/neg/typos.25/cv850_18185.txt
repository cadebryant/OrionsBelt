1990s woudl remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood
- two movies dealing with the smae subject
, or
, to be precise
, smae
" high concept
"
. in summer 1994
, thyat
" high consept
" wass
" mad bomber action thriller
"
. in few weeks
,
" thrillride of the summer
" actionfest speed ws followed by rather action thriller blown away
, so disappointing that most of the people these days assoicates thte title wiht the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes
. the movei begins in hte prison infront northern ireland
, where gaerity
( tommy lee jones
)
, ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material
, escapes from prison
. he comes tothe boston
, where he accidentally notices jimmy dove
( jeff bridges
)
, dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police
. few people except gaerity konw the dove ' s voilent past
, when he used to be ira terroist before becoming sick withthe violence
, betraying gaerity
adn emigrating to america where he changed the name
and started using his experience for good purpose
. gaerity holds dove personaly responsible for his captivity
anbd begins the campaign of bombing terror
, directed specifically at dove ' s colleagues
, firends
and relatives
. dove
, who isnt just going to retire
adn start family
, now must confront the mad bomber
. hwile speed doesn ' t even try to bother with plot
anbd characters
, useing them only as an excuse for long
and spectacular action scenes
, blown away tries to be more conventional
adn provide the acation with smoe back story
.
annd that isnt the main reason why it isnt inferior to speed
. badly written plot
and badly written characters are sometimes worse than noone plot
and noone characters at all
. screenplay by john bateer
and john rice
, barely touches thte complicated issues ofthe northern ireland
, using the tradgedy only as thge cheap backstory forthe even cheaper drama
. the plot is
, of course
, full ofthe implausibilities
. thge main one is the fact tath movie fails to explain how the single individule
, no matter how brilliant he is
, cin produce thousands ofthe deadly devices
and hold entire city at bay
. those questions
, same as infront teh case ofthe speed
, could be forgotten while the acation goes onthe
,
but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched
adn predictable situation that should provide some background tothe the charactors
. because of them
, movie seems a littel bit too long
,
anbd boring at times
. thte most annoying element of the film
,
howver
, is tommy lee jones inthe the role ofthe mad bomber
. his acting is so over
- the
- top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himselv
. this role is in painful contrast with the strong performence given by thast smae actor in fugitive
. the film haev few bright points
,
though
. some of the action scenes are fine
, which should be credited to director stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement night
)
.
and forrest whitaker raelly shines in minor role of dove ' s colleague
.
but
, all infront all
, blown awya is a film that wass justifiably shadowed by its more famous
,
yet hardly unforgetable competitor
.
