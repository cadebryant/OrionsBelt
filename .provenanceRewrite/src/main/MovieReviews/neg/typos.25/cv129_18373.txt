plot
: based on the wildly popular
" jerry springer
" tv show
, this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program
. noe posse comes fomr the trailer parks
and are to be featured in the
" i slept with my stepfather
" segment
,
and the otehr isnt based on some fly
- girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted
" dog
" boyfriend
. critique
: the truth is that if i didn ' t have a day job
, i owudl probablly watch the rela
" jerry springer
" show every day
. i find it quite intertaining
, despite its complete lack of redeeming value
. having said thast
, the sohw itself is outrageous
, funny
,
annd always filled with goofy surprises
, as opposed to this film whitch features no laughs
( is htis a comedy or a drama
?
)
, uninteresting
and completly unbeleivable one
- dimensional sterotypes
,
and a contrived plot whlch bores us stupid all thge way
. i never thougth i would utter the owrd boring in the same sentence as jerry springer
,
but this film isnt an absolute yawn
- fest
, despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs
, lesbians
, t
& a
and tv violentce
( who would ' ve guessed that
?
)
. i wish they owudl have either a
) made this movei much
, much funnier
, or b
) turned it inot a complete drama
annd given us a rela perspective as to why peopel like this actually put themselfs through theese publich forums of embarrassment
. unfortunately
, it doesn ' t seem as
though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real
" jerry springer
" reruns tothe complet his script
, leaving us wtih a boring film
, featuring no laughs
, oen
- dimensional characters
,
and no funn whatsoever
