the origional
_ babe
_ was my favorite movie ofthe 1995
, a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience
. being a surprise commercial
and critical success
, it hadnt no marketing tie
- ins
, which limited its fianl take
. thus
, babe 2 arrives
, with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1
. plush dolls
, vending machines hawking t
- shirts
,
and macy ' s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holida omney
- grubbing
. too late
. this isnt a sad review to write
, becuase babe 2 not onyl doens
_ nto
_ live uv to the original
,
but it doesn ' t even come to a fraction ofthe it
. i shouldn ' t expect taht sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecesors ' magic
,
but this film tries too hard
,
and loses its charm
. consider a driver applying tje accelerator with great intensity
, unaware that his car is inspite neutral
. imagine with me
, if you will
,
_ scream
_ ' s jamie kennedy
, explaining the
" rules
" for sequels like babe 2
.
( 1
) there must be
_ more
_ talking animals
.
( 2
) there must be
_ more
_ slapstick comedy
.
( 3
) htere must be
_ more
_ songs for those mice to sing
: tht ' s cute
.
( 4
) keep teh story cards to break up the acation
: that ' s cute too
, even
though
" the pig gets wise
" made noone sence
, given the context of that story partition
.
( 5
) there must be action
,
however illogical
, that will conjure up pivotal scenes ffrom the orginal
: tyhe trademark song that nobody remembers thge words to
, the baa
- ram
- ewe secret code
, the
" that ' ll dont
, pig
. that ' ll do
.
" now throw in the limitations
:
( a
) james cromwell
, now a hot commodity
, hasnt limited time on tje set
( or mabey he didn ' t approve of the script
)
.
( b
) christine cavanaugh
, the voice of teh original babe
, demands more money
(
$ 200
, 000
-
- paltry considering the
$ 80 million budget
)
. outloud
. e
. g
. daily comes infront with noticable results
.
( c
) george miller
, the director
, is more well
- known forthe his dark futuristic mad max films
and his twilight zone segment
, not for kiddie fare
(
anbd no
, he didn ' t direct that
_ andre
_ film in ' 94
)
.
( d
) the special effects are impressive
,
_
but limited
_
. babe talks
,
but most of the time from a single shooted
, repeated over
and over agian
.
( babe is center screen
, looking straight inot the camera
, with a happy smirk
-
- regardless of whther he ' s happy
, or scared
, or tired
)
. season now with thte
" original
" elements
, which
, as we iwll fidn out
, are straight fomr the screenwriting
- is
- hell bin
.
( i
) change the venue into
" tje big city
"
. this hasnt been praised as wildly original
. excuse me
: didn ' t
_ home alone
_ do this several years ago
? how about the muppets
? even
_ the bad news bears
_ travelled to tokyo
. sorry
. no dice
. side note
: to give the city a fairy
- tale look
, george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world ' s great cities
,
and yes
, it
_ is
_ impressive
.
but this too is over
- unsed
, repeating hte same veiw over
and agian on multiple occassions
.
anbd
, for the most part
, babe
_ remains in the hotel
_
.
( ii
) given thge limitations of cromwell
, the human element isnt taken over by
" the boss ' wife
" played by magda szubanski
. s
- t
- r
- e
- t
- c
- h
. she ' s not a lead actress
- type
, she ' s not funny enought in her physical comedy
,
and she ' s simpley embarrassing in soem ofthe her pratfalls
.
( have her arrested falsely on drug charges
! ahev her accidentally incite a riot whith biker dudes
and scantily clad babes
! have her bounce around onthe a bungee cord at a prestigious benifit dinner
!
) i was hoping for a little smirk during theese scenes
,
but i felt sorry for tyhe embarrassment that she put herself in
. i am restraining myself ffrom talking about the dark nature of the film
, the violence
, tjhe scene where a pit bull dangles from hte bridge
, head submerged underwater
. even the best fairy tales have a bited of the macabre inaddition it
, as the brothers grimm have demonstrated
. no
.
.
. my probelm is with the story
, or lack thereof
.
_ babe
_ is sent outloud to save the hoggett farm
,
but once infront the city
, that story is forgotten
. being a good
- natured pig inspite tyhe midst ofthe tje cynicism of his environs is nice
,
but
, other than rescue that aforememtioned pit bull
, what did babe actually
_ dont
_
? without giving thte ending awya
, the farm is saved from a left
- field quirk that had nothing tothe do wiht the pig
. speaking of
" pig
"
, or
,
" pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
!
"
. the owrd
" pig
" is so overused
, hadnt htey changed it to an expletive
,
and had the pig be al pacino
, i could have been watching
_ scarface
_
. this is screenwriting
? further
, i cannnot explane the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents hppen tothe ogod peple iin fantastically elaborate setups
. had it beeen a ctaroon
,
and the victum be an equivalent of elmer fudd
, maybe my reaction would have been softened
.
bu to farmer hoggett
? his wife
? an elderly mickey rooney
? much too irreverent
.
(
" quick
! splice those singing mice into thsoe scenes
!
"
)
. the film isn ' t a colossal failure
. i did like glenne headley ' s schmoozy chimpanzee
. i liked the pink poodle
. teh dog on tyhe cart
, who momentarily thinks he ' s in dog heaven
.
and a weidr looking guy who may have beeen doubly
- cast as an airport employee
adn a judge
.
but most of tjhe time
, i was looking down
, inwhich boredom
, or in embarrassment over hte hacked
- uv script
. them singing mice
, thsoe chapter partitions
, the proficient acting of the animals
-
- none of theese can compensate forthe a stopry
. let me spoil the final scene
: farmer hoggett looks at pig
, proud
, says
" that ' ll do
, pig
. that ' ll do
.
" that ' s it
. hope i didn ' t ruin it for you
.
but tell me this
: whta the heck did tyhat pig
_ do
_
?
