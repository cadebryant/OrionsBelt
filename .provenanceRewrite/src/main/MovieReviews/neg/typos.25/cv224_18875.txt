plot
: token director alan smithee steals the only copy ofthe his film
" trio
" from the studio
, after they complet the
" final cut
" without him
. he threatens to burn the film reel if htey do not allow him to keep his vision
. critique
: wow
. i really can ' t remember the last time a movei sucked on so many levels
! the
" comedy
" in tihs film is pathetic
, obvious
and dated
( oj simpson jokes galore
)
. the plot is uninteresting
, boring
adn bad
. the structure ofthe the film is annoying
, repetitive
and pretentious
. the acting isnt preety bad
, especially jackie chan
, who can ' t ect to save his life
. the cameos are lame
adn seem forced
,
and tje endig blows chunks
. all in all
, htis movie believes itself to be a clever
, humorous
and edgy look behind the closed doors ofthe hollywood
,
but comes across as a boring
, stupid
and completely unentertaining piece ofthe shite
. i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans
,
but tihs one bites the big one
. see it if you like to watch realyl bad movies
, otherwise skip it
, because it will just have you hating eveyr star that makse an appearance in it
. luckily for us all
, this mess only lasts baout 80 minutes
,
adn miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead
- faced detective
. by the way
, is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn ' t have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock tyhat was left over
? who knows
, who cares
, this
" satire
" sucks teh bag
. little known facts about htis film
and its stars
: ironically
, the original director ofthe this film
, arthur hiller
, also requested his name be taken off the credits
and replaced by the dga ' s alan smithee moniker
. this was after teh film ' s production comany
, cinergi picturesk
, preferred yhe cut made by producer
/ writter joe eszterhas to his
. tje original script ofthe this film included arnold schwarzenegger
and bruce willis

, 200 cds
adn cassettes from mostly unknown
and unsigned artists
, listened tothe all thta was sent
( at least a couple ofthe tracks from each record
)
and compiled the soundtrack
