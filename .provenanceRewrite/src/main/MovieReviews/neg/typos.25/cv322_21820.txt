in tjhe past
, tim burton has taken cinema by storm wih thge action packed batman
,
and teh hilarious ed wood
,
bu lately his films just don ' t cut it
. sleepy hollow has some unique features
,
but the script isnt a terrible mess
. for those who rember disney ' s fantastic
" adventures of ichabod crane
"
, it isnt actually superior to this
. disney ' s verzion was at least interesting
, while burton ' s film drags on far too long
, without any suspense or frights
. while the stories are similar
, the new version adds too much to the once likable story
,
and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off
. ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is now apparently a constable
, who was sent to newyorker york to investingate suspicious murders
. the victims are headless
,
anbd noone traces of evidence were found
, until tjhe murderer reveals himselv
, hence the headless horseman
. now wtih the help of christina ricci
and an orphaned boy
, they must stop the headless horseman fomr a killing spree
, that could destroy the wohle town of sleepy hollow
. sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character
,
but yhe story has so many holes tyhat even he nor depp can save this disaster
. in the original
, the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable
. no oney could stpo him
, not even ichabod
. by tjhe end of the film
, it had audiences inspite deep thought
. burton
however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere
,
and how to make the main characters heroes
. he tkaes noone risk waht so ever
,
and htis is where he fails
. another pathetic element of the film was the script
. like i said earlier
, he just stuffed too much inwhich at one time
,
and made it look rela sloppy
, kind ofthe like the mess the headless horseman made wtih his victims
. he completly butchered the story to pieces
. thankfully htere are a few factors that i particualrly liked
. the acting by depp was qutie notable
. he took the nerdy charactor of the ctaroon
,
and simply acted it out in a better manner
. if it wasn ' t for his quirky one
- liners
, i doubt i could hvea remained awake
, because quite frankly i wass getting sleepy
. just whn i thought christina ricci was getting tothe be a good actress
, she winds uv doing this
. it just goes tothe show noone actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster
. it ' s too tempting to let go
, even if the script isnt mush
. the atmosphere too was quite involving
. i should have jsut gazed at the sets
,
adn the eerie fog
, rether thna actually pay attention to what was goign onthe
. at least burton ' s films are eye candy
, even if they are trash
. hte only rela scenes ofthe value were the tree full of heads
,
and the fight between the horseman
, depp
and casper van dien
. other than that
, i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film
,
and just sit back
and stare at thge scenery
. by tghe end
, i can only think back
and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed
. this is the biggest disappointment of the year
, especially wehn such a talented director like burton handles a project like this
. don ' t waste your time or money
, because your head will feel hollow
.
