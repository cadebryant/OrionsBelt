thsi isnt not a simple plan about finding a plane load ofthe money
and getting away with the cash
. this is more about a parable of greed
,
and how money can become thte bane of your life
. yes
, there are elements ofthe
? fargo ' here
( the snow
and cold
)
,
allthough not as vivid inspite the blood
and gore deparment
. it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death
adn tjhe destruction of lives
.
and how at the end of the day
, the thigns that matter most are love
, truth
and honesty
.
although in one sense it may seem tedeous
, making a movie about the ugliness ofthe greed
( not box office material
)
, it does become tedious
, nto because of the morale ending
,
but because oen expects the movie to end that way
. this becomes apparent affter the first murder to cover uv teh crime
, the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there
. the characters in this drama are a mixture ofthe simple
adn intellectual folk
, brothers
anbd friends
, who all fall prey to the avarice of money
. they shoudl have perhaps thrown in someone sensible
, level headed
and not affected by greed to give the party moreso balance
. commendable is tyhe exceptional performance of billy bob thornton
, whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful
. bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier yuonger brother
, whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wief
, who indirectly causes the most problems
. fill a room full of greedy people
and several millon dollars
,
and you will end up iwth a simple recipe for a blood bath
. it ' s not a simple plan
, wehn ytou shoot everyone you love for money
, unless you ' re teh menendez brothers
.
