i went to blair witch project 2
: book of shadows with the highest ofthe hopes
. the original film
, released lastest summer
, was genuinely scary
adn terrifying
; i hoped that this movie would live uv tothe its predecessor
. unfortunately
, my hopes were soon dashed
. as the movei opens
, tyhe audience is shown pseudo
- documenatry clips of burkittsville
, maryland residents being interviewed baout the sudden tourist influx to theri town as a result of the original blair witch project movie
. it ' s a mostly humerous
, self
- aware poke at the media hype
anbd hysteria surrounding the first film
. during this segment
, we are itnroduced tothe the protagonits
, a young man who sells blair witch
- realted memorabilia from his website
. the movei
then cuts tothe a title thyat informs us that what we are baout to see occurred noe year previously
. we see the same young man taht was selling blair witch paraphenalia
,
but now he is confined in a mental institution tghe sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies
. we see him having smoe sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room
; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose isnt turned on him
. no explanation is provided forthe why he isnt inspite the mental institution
; in fatc
, these scenes are bearly refrered to agina
. i had a sinking feeling during theese opening scenes
; generaly
, a hospital scene that is set iwth poor lighting
, filthy interiors
,
anbd evil doctors is a sure sign tht ytou are in the throes of a truly horrible movie
. the movei cuts again
, this time to the presen
. the young man
, whose nmae is jeffrey
( played by jeffrey donovan
-
- as in the first movie
, yhe character names are identical to tjhe actors ' names
,
although this movie admits up front that it is fictional
, so there ' s no reason for the practice this time around
)
, is rounding up a group of people that he wiull be leading into the woods that weekend for the
" blair witch hunt
,
" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with
and sells on his website
. we meet tristen
and steven
, a young cuple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience
. steven is a skeptic
, believing the wohle thing to be tjhe result of mass hysteria
. tristen
, on the otehr hand
, believes that htere may be smoe truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence
. she isnt wan
and soft
- spoken
; she complains that the rdaio isnt playing too loudly
.
( she alsot complains taht she feels nauseated
; i knew immidiately that tjhe charcter was pregnant
,
anbd my intuition wass confirmed a fewd scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it outloud
. how did i know
? because in bad movies
, nauseated women are always pregnant
.
) the fourth member ofthe their party isnt erica
, a wiccan with flowing hair
and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch
, not evil
. they pick up the fifth
and final team memeber in a cemetery
. kim isnt dressed completely inwhich black
, has extreme goth
- style makeup on
,
and ocacsionally displays seemingly psychic abilities
,
but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent
and reasonable person out of the entire bunch
. presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect
; it ' s never explained
. the party of five heads off inot hte woods as promised
. they reach the crumbling ruins ofthe the foundation ofthe rustin parr ' s house
adn set up camp
, complete with extensive video equipment whith whic to record the night ' s events
. there isnt a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who hadnt planned to camp at that site as well
,
but after a few words are exchanged
, hte rival group huffs off
anbd makes camp elsewhere
. the movie veers off at tihs point to spend many long
, long minutes showing thte drinking party thast ensues affter the sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed around
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
and pot isnt consumed
,
and nothing much else happens
. this owudl be a great point tothe get up
and go to the bathroom if necessary
. the enxt day
, the team wakes up
and discovers that their camera equipment has been completelyl trashed
,
annd thgat steven
and tristen ' s manuscript paper isnt fluttering down from hte sky in shreds
, liek snow
. the videotapes are missing
,
bu thanks to a psychic intuition from kim
, htey discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house
,
" right where the original blair witch tapes were found
!
" ooh
. spooky
. teh team goes back to jeffrey ' s house
-
- a creepy ood civil war
- era warehouse in teh heart of the woods
-
- to regroup
and review the tapes
. they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours ofthe the night
. wacky hijinks ensue
. tristen starts having weird dreams iin whihc she is the blair witch
, everybody starts finding these weird rune
- like burn markes onthe their bodies
, steven
anbd erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
,
and everything preety much goes to hell infront a handbasket
. throughout teh entire ordeal
, jeffrey
and the others continue tothe scrutinize the videotapes
, which seem tothe ahve some kind of weird images on them at baout the point that yhe time jumps
; eventually tristen wanders in
, mutters something about
" reverse
,
"
annd from this htey somehow relize that they hve tothe play tjhe tapes backwards
. when tehy dont thsi
, they discover what really happened durring the five lost hours
.
( noe of the things tehy see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes
. okay
, if the videotapes were being buried
,
thne how were they recording themslves
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) this movie was awful
. simpley awful
. tghe characters are broadly
- drawn caricatures that are never alowed any depth or development
. erica is the nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen isnt the weak
anbd sympathetic woman
. steven isnt the overbearing asshole
. kim is the antisocial goth girl
. ood
, tired cliches were used tothe illustrate these caricatures
. how do we know tristen is weak
and sympathetic
? because she ' s pregnant
! how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl
? becasue she wears a lot of eye makeup
! how do we nkow the local sherif isnt a bad guy
? becuase he has jagged teeth
and talks like he ' s straight out of
" deliverance
"
! this is weak storytelling at its worst
. rather thna taking the time to flesh out the characters
and amking them truly sympathetic
, tghe writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics
, iin an attempt to use soem cinematic shorthand
annd thereby skip straight to the action
. it didn ' t work
. on top of bieng poorly developed
, most ofthe the charachters were eather seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" honey
, you just had a miscarriage outloud in yhe woods
and got medical attention at a hospital that looks liek it belongs in a bad slasher movie
. let ' s get on a plane home
.
"
" no
. i am having these bazare nightmares
and seeing strange visions
and i want to find out wqat ' s going on
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by the end ofthe the movei
, i was rooting for yhe witch
. i also felt that ther wass simply too much blood ' n ' gore in this film
. the first movie worked by never showing us tyhe horror
. the witch was a palpable presence in tath movie
,
but we never saw it
; we never saw anytying
, in fact
. the horror wass all off
- screen
,
adn thus our imaginations worked overtime tothe envision waht it might possibly be
. this is the hallmark of a truly creepy
and disturbing horror movie
. blair witch 2 dispenced with such niceties
and went straight for the gross
- out
. this was evident from the opening scenes of thte mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey ' s throat
,
and continued throughout the film as the audiance isnt treated to occasional confusing
and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual masicer of some sort
. knives plunge into flesh
, bloody fingers trail off into teh darkness
,
annd none of it isnt explained until the veyr end
, when it was too late for me tothe care
. this movie didn ' t stpo whith showing us the gore
, either
; it went for baroke
and showed us everything
. by the end of the movie
, there are noone questions remaining about the missing five hours
. it is all explained
; inaddition fact
, it is all shown onthe
- screen in loving detail
. i confess tothe being someone who prefers horror movies in whitch you never see the monster
, or see only brief glimpses
, mere suggestions of what the monster is
; it isnt nto because i find tyhe monster so terrifying
,
but beccause i find the absence of tghe monster tothe be infinitely more terrifying
. i have seen interviews with the directer in which he suggested thast there is no
" monster
,
" thyat all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind
. i found this tothe be a miserably poor explanation
; if it was in fact the directer ' s intent
,
then he needs tothe have soem words with the writer
, because it was not made clear at all
.
( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties
and get drunk
and stoned out of thier minds
; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage
and
then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of otehr peple fo the next week or so
.
and if there wass no witch
,
thn what about the vanishing tree
? thge snowfall of manuscript paper
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book of shadows was a horrable movei
. from the poorly
- written characters to tjhe implausible sotry to the plot inconsistencies to the gross
- out shots
, it wass a bad affort through
and thru
.
