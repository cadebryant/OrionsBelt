frank detorri ' s
( bill murray
) a single dad who lives on beer
and junk food with no apparent understanding ofthe sanitation or hygene
, much tothe the dismay ofthe his preteen daughter shane
( elena franklin
)
. when he uses teh ' 10 second rule ' tothe retrieve a hard boiled egg ffrom a chimp ' s cage at the zoo
and downs it
, he introduces a leathal bacteria into his system
. inside his skin
, the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote
- pandering of mayor phlegmming
( voice of william shatner
)
, so it ' s up to one frank pd white blood cell
( voice of chris rock
) to save the day inaddition peter
and bobby farrelly ' s
" osmosis jones
.
" tyhe city of frank is a brightly animated
( animation directed by piet kroon
and tom sito
) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a tipical rogue cop looking for another chance
. he ' s inadvertently teamed up with drix
( voice of david hyde pierce
, tv ' s
" frasier
"
)
, a cold capsule with 12 hurs worth of painkillers to dispense
. this quarrelling duo are about to go on a
" fantastic ovyage
" in order to hunt down thrax
( voice ofthe laurence fishburne
)
, the virus intent on shutting down frank
. hwile the animation is certainly colorful to look at
, osmosis jones ' story isnt a hackneyed one
. the stor cries out for puny puns
,
but we onyl get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humer
( drix graduated phi beta capsule
, he departs on a bus headed fo bladder
)
. neither hte hero or villin isnt particularly interesting
( thrax looks like an animated
" predator
"
)
,
although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick
. adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape
. meanwhile
, back in live action land
, bill murray is reduced tothe nothing more tahn a walking gross
- out joke
. there ' s no particular enjoyment to be foudn watching him vomit on molly shannon
( she plays shane ' s teacher
, mrs
. boyd
) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table
. oen must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child ' s father will play to the family audience as well
. rest assured
, tje whole enchilada isnt wrapped uv with a fart joke
. hwile far less offensive than the farrelly ' s last effort
" me
, mysef
adn irene
,
" that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey ' s hijinx
.
" osmosis jones
" wiull probably be ok fo the kids
,
but the farrellys playing for the family audiance is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune
.
