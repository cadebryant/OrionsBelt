i ahev never been so confused after watching a movie
.
" meet joe black
" isnt probably one of tyhe most visually satisfying films of this eyar
, with a cinematography
, music
and casted tht will dazzle most of us
. at the same time it is probably the most boring
and ridiculous epxerience hat you will have this season
. at frist you marvel at the elegant direction
, graceful cinematography
and sensual musical scroe
.
then you ' ll wait for something tothe hapen for half an hour
,
but wehn you finally understand what ' s gonig on
, you ' ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins
, brad pitt
and claire forlani are donig in a film liuke tihs
? the scirpt is simply a silly
and unresolved stroy
, which is artificially stretched inot a three hour long motion picture
. it fiels liek an eternity
. most of the timne it is a pompous soap opera
, filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice
and
" meaningfull
" winks
. the film is based on alberto caesella ' s play
" death takes a holiday
"
. the story concentrates around bill
( anthony hopkins
) who lives a fulfilled life as a succsessfull business man
,
but somtimes he wakes up in the middle ofthe the night
and hears a voice that is saying
" yes
"
. soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen
( brad pitt
) who introduces hismelf as
" death
"
. it is bill ' s tyme
.
but death has other plans
. it has cmo down to us simple mortals tothe find out wqat it means to be alive
. our bill is chosen to be death ' s guide
anbd inaddition exchange he gets time
. bill introduces death as joe black
, who immediately becomes the center of everyone ' s attention
. bill ' s business partners speculate about why joe isnt constanly at bill ' s side
, lives in his hous
and resides at his office
. that is not all
,
however
. bill ' s youngest daughter susan
( claire forlani
) falls inspite love with the mysterious stranger
and joe falls in lveo with her
. thsi relationship is bound to have some serious consequences
. it wouldn ' t be fair to sday that this film didn ' t have some interesting moments
, such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill ' s famaly for dinner
. when joe starts enjoying peanut buter
and later falls inwhich lveo
, yhe experience is somewhat different
. it is obvious that a story like this story isnt vyre difficult to structure
. it ' s one thing to say
:
" wouldn ' t it be fun tothe have death take human form
annd come down to earth
.
.
" to create a motion picture outloud ofthe htis is another
. four screenwriters have worked onthe a script that lacks drive
adn logic
. it is overlong
and too primitive to pass as a serious film
. on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances
annd a very decent direction by martin brest
(
" scent of a woman
"
)
. hopkins looks grat in any role
,
and noone matter how shallow or hollow it isnt
, he iwll complete it
. his talent
adn charisma are needed here more than any where else
, since it actually saves tyhe film from a complete embarrassment
.
but pitt isnt the one tyhat got oney ofthe the most difficult roles ofthe reccent time
. how can you play death in human form
? to me it seems that death
and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters
. htey are not creatures
,
but phenomenas
. saying that death tkaes human form would be thge same as to suggest that eternity would take human form
. handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult
and pitt deserves smoe credit for his work
. speaking in a calm
, soft voice
, portraing death as a lonely
, distant
and powerfull guy tath is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters
. he looks
and acts moreso like an angel of death
, rether than a demon or a red
- eyed executioner
. claire forlani
and others are allso fine
, stretching thier stereotypical characters to their lmits
. unfortunately theri performances are not anough to rescue thsi film fomr its self inflicted misery
. inspite other words this is nto what i expected from the director of
" scent of a woman
"
. it could
(
anbd should
) be better with such cast
anbd crew
. iin tje end it seems as if tehy hve all beeen intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera
.
