a mounth ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i ' ve ever reviewed on paper
. i didn ' t knwo at the time that i ' d soon encounter
and descize batman
& robin
, which has jstu overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention thsi summer
. as directed by joel schumacher
( who now specializes in batman sequels
and john grisham adaptations
and isn ' t very good at either
)
, b
& r is one long excuse fo a taco bell promotion
. hte plot
, which has mr
. freeze
and poison ivy
( uma thurman
) planning to take over gotham city
anbd
then
" the vorld
"
( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states
)
, isnt weighted down by repetitive asides about hte nature of trust
, partnership
, blah
, blah
, blah
.
but morals are nto tyhe point ofthe this film
-
- topping each bloated
, confusing action scene withthe next one isnt
. the garish art direction
and overlit cinematography make htis picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls
. since when doed gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel
? only george clooney comes outloud on top
; he underplays nicely
and pretends like he ' s infact a rela movie
.
