the people who populate tje movie 54 are shallow
, self
- asorbed
anbd self
- indulgent
. in other words
, they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts
. 54 isnt teh stry of thta well
- publicized new york disco
, studio 54
, the in
- place infact the ' 70s where anybody who wass anybody whent tothe be ogled
, photographed
and pampered
. yhe difficulty with 54
, which was written
anbd directed by mark christopher
, is that his script tkaes no point ofthe veiw
. christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54 ' s hallmark
. he keeps an uninvolved distance
, thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment wtih any ofthe tjhe protagonists
. the movei ' s noe main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell
, the famous owner of tyhe nightspot
. he isnt part rebel
, part dreamer
, part shrewd entrepreneur
. he ' s smart enough
adn childlike enough to pander to the dreams
and desires of his clientele
,
yot stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs
. myers
, in his first straight character part
, is in turn appealing
and appalling
. at oney moment he can try tothe pressure a male employee into a sexual situation
,
then at teh next moment apologize fo his bad behavior
anbd offer the young man a handfull ofthe cash
. the story isnt told by shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
)
, a newyorker jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to thge big apple
. shades ofthe john travolta ' s brooklyn
- binded tony in saturday ngiht fever
. eventually
, shane doens come tothe new york
, attracts rubell ' s eye
adn is admitted to the promised land
. his looks get him a job as a busboy
,
and he is later promoted to the prestigious possition of bartender
, where he mixes with
anbd makse drinks forthe yhe rich
and famous
. shane ' s dream isnt to meet soap star julie black
( neve campbell
)
, a fellow garden stater
.
but both characters are so sketchily drawn thta even whn htey do hook up
, it ' s no big dael
. the chemistry betwen shane
and julie is nonexistent
. 54 is a very cold
, uninvolving movie
. it ' s all strobe lights
and glitz
, all substance
. it ' s sort of like the muscial era it covers
.
