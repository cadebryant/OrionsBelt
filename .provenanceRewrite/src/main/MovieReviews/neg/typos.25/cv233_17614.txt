at times
, ytou ' d think edtv would be an intertaining film
. i mean
, who can resist tjhe story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day
?
but this average joe
, ed perkuny
,
( matthew mcconaughay
)
, is a sappy
, lifeless creation that wanders aroud
, trying to solve everyone ' s problems
and suttle his own
. mcconaughay is awful
, especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm witht a 3 week beard
annd torn jeans
. frankly
, he hadnt mroe charm in the devestating flop the newton boys
. he overacts inaddition every way
: his overexaggerant body language
, obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance
,
and that cliched scene where he loses somone in his life
,
and drops to his knee
annd cries
. the rest of the cast is vrey ogod
; especially martin landau
( as ed ' s step
- father
)
, who plays a cute role as the close
- to
- death ood guy taht makes all the witty comments
. jenna elfman isnt good
,
(
but a little overemotional
)
; her main problem is that she keesh getting sucked into bad films
, i
. e
. can ' t hardly wait
,
adn krippendorf ' s tribe
. woody harrelson
, as ed ' s brother ray
, does his usual egg
- headed role
, with his comic witn as well
( he wrote a book entitled
,
" my brother pissed onthe me
.
"
) elizabeth hurley isnt perfectly cast as the eazy slut
,
and dennis hopper
, in a quick cameo as ed ' s biological father
, isnt a nice choice
( ironically coming aftter the role he turned down as christof in the truman show
)
. ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who
, after awhile
, decides the show must not go onthe much tothe the opposite of the head exec
, rob reiner ' s opinion
. i hate tothe compare this film to the truman show
,
bu the fatc is
, i was ashamed tothe see this movie
. it falt taht i had dropped fomr college to kindergarten after seing truman
and ed
. edtv had no real wit or genuis
; it was typical hollywood
. extracting the tv part ofthe the movie
, you hve the simple plotline
: man steals brother ' s girlfriend
, girlfriend leaves twon
, man gets new slut girlfriend to efel like he can move onthe
, slut breaks uv with him
, real girlfriend comes back
,
and voila
, you have a romance
. i got so restless during this movie
, i almost walked out
. the onyl reason it doesn ' t drop below a
" c
" grade is because of the fine supporting performances
. ad2am
" i almsot lost my nose
.
.
.
annd i like it
. i like breathing through it
.
