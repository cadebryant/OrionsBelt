" saveing silverman
" is a good example of a good comedy gone bad
. as a love story it is good
,
however as a comedy it falls flat on it ' s face
. i thiunk throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times
.
.
.
adn those were just chuckles at the most
! tje movie doesn ' t have the oomph to make it a great movie
,
and doesn ' t have thte script to make it a funny movie
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack black
)
,
and darren silverman
( jason biggs
) have grown up all theri lives together
, they hvae been best friends forever
and vow to stay close till the end
. hwile in a bar after donig a show withthe their band
, based on their love of neil diamond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( amanda peet
) whom he instantly falls forthe
. wayne
adn j
. d
.
however think differently
and when judith tells darren thgat he can never see his firends again
, it ' s uv to wayne
and j
. d
. to try
and begin saving silverman
. tyhe performances are topnotch
and surprizingly
, they are what keep thge movie afloat
. jason biggs right off the flop
" loser
" does an ok job playing silverman
,
bu he is stale
and flat at times
. steve zahn isnt perfect in the role of wayne lefessier
,
anbd even
though the movei isnt baout silverman
, lefessier is really the main character
and the narrator of the movie itself
. jack black is well jack black
,
anbd he does an all right job as j
. d
.
bu he isn ' t as funny as he has been in the past
. amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith
,
and neil diamond plays neil diamond
( he ' s better at singing than acting
)
. anyway the performances in the film are good
,
but it ' s too bad the scirpt isn ' t
. speaking of script
, hank nelkan ' s choppy script isnt not only badly written
,
but not funny enough even fo an episode of sesame street
. the trailer for the movie
, as with most movies gives away everything that happens inthe the movei
, especially the funniest parts
. somewhere
" saving silverman
" was meant to be a good movie
,
and it sould ahve been
,
but alas in the end it wasn ' t
. dennis dugan ' s direction is all right
, he adds a few directorial touches here
and there
, nothing spacial being a simple comedy
.
" saving silverman
" is a perfectly bad movei in more ways than oen
. it has a great cast
, a good director
and a sweet story
.
.
. it ' s just too bad it has a bad script
and is all together a bad movei
.
