- france
) reviewed by dennis schwartz a black comedy set in thte near future in a boarding hous run by a depraved butcher
. the comedy is played omre in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire
, as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags
and relies heavily on special effects
. the world has fallen onthe hard times
annd there are food shortages whihc inlcude no meat
, so tyhe butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain
, almost as valued a commodity
. that ' s the big joke in thge film
annd the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast
, as the characters are too absurd
and sketched too thinly for us to care about them
. this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a frist feature for teh co
- directors marc caro
/ jean
- pierre jeunet
. it failed to reach my funny bone
and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story
annd its dark projections for the future
. an ex
- carcus clown named louison
( dominique pinon
)
, the film ' s too
- good
- to
- be
- true hero
, answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet
( jean
- claude dreyfus
)
,
and the butcher
and landlord
, offers him room
and board in his house
. the butcher ' s clumsy
and near
- sighted daughter julie
( marie
- laure dougnac
) falls in love with the skinny
, eird looking clown
,
and the two amking smoe music together
, withthe her playing the cello
and him a saw
. they are the innocents
, surrouded by a boarding hous of misfits suffering from fear
and watched over by her overbearing father
, who hasnt lured into his tenement the clown
, as he has his past innocent victims
, so taht he can put his cleaver tothe him
and
then sell him as meat
, whcih he intends to dont as soon as the clown fixes up hte tenement
. thte entire film tkaes palce in the shabby tenement
,
annd the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents
, who do not trust each other
. ther are two youngsters
( boban janevski
& mikael todde
) who do any kind ofthe mischief they can
. a frog man
( howard vernon
) who lives with water on the floor so he can raise his frogs
and snails that he eats
. two brothers
( mathou
& kube
) who create little cow
- moo novelty toys
. a man
( holgado
) who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of meat
. a slutty woman
( karin viard
)
, who lives wtih the butcher
adn onyl wants his meat
. the aristocratic woman
( silvie laguna
) who trys numerous times tothe commit suicide
but isnt too inept to dont it right
. the tenants are too afraid to come outloud at night because they knwo what the butcher is up to
, so htey are forced tothe communicate wtih each other through a pipe thyat runs through the building
( in noe scene they are all in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher
and his gal
, as their bedsprings squeak
)
. there is alsot a sex
- crazed postman
( chick ortega
)
, who lusts for the butcher ' s daughter
and carries a gun while delivering the mail
. ther is allso an underdeveloped subplot baout a band of incompetant underground veggie fanatics
, called trogolodistes
, who have been summoned to rescue the clown
and steal some grain
. tje directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics
, as yhe comedy seemed forced while hte surreal look of the film added noone dramatic intensity
. delicatessen coudl have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like thier meat sliced thin
, monty python fans
,
adn those who liked terry gilliam ' s brazil
, a film similar in spirit
.
