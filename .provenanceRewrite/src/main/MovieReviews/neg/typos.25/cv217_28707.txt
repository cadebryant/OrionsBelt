yhe swirling sick feeling hit me jsut a few minutes inot
" heartbreakers
.
" ray liotta ' s character ws making out with his secretary whn his newyorker wife knocked on the door ofthe his office
. hwile scrambling to collect himselv
, he frantically shouted to her
,
" just wait a sex
? er
, i mean sec
!
" i was struck by a wave ofthe revulsion
, thinking
,
" geez
, didn ' t lines liek that die when ' three ' s company ' was canceled
?
" over the enxt few minutes
, as the barely double entendres
and lingering cleavage shots growed more numerous
, i realized that the mindset behind
" heartbreakers
" predated
" three ' s comapany
.
" suddenly
, i had an out
- of
- body experience as my internal way
- back machine swept me to the mid
- 1960s
. all accros america
, the counter
- culture was growing like wildfire
,
bu there was scant evidence of it on tv
. hwile young people were challenging traditional values onthe the streets
, frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home
, sulking hwile our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special
. women in skimpy bathing suits owudl prance onscreen while hope made growling noises
and leered at their breasts
. on another channel
, dean martin made wisecracks baout
" booze
and broads
"
and peter lawford
, decked out inthe love beads
and a nehru jacket
, purred suggestive noe
- liners as he ogled thte go
- go dancers
. the adults laughed
and laughed
.
" heartbreakers
" reeks ofthe that stagnant mentality
, from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt ' s vah
- vah
- voom breasts tothe its leaden screenplay
, which paints women as haughty schemers
and men as drooling buffoons too sex
- obsessed to realize they are bieng manipulated
. infact addition to liotta
anbd hewitt
, the cast includes sigourney weaver
, gene hackman
, jason lee
, nora dunn
and anne bancroft
. i cant ' t imagin what drew performers of their caliber to this project
. perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the ' 60s
. if so
, tehy were sadly mistaken
. the story revolves arround a mother
- daughter con
- team
. it opens with the marriage of max
( weaver
) tothe dean
( liotta
)
, a new jersey chop shop operator
. having withheld sex untli thge honeymoon
, max pretends to pass out on their wedding night
. the next morning
, she feigns illness
, sending a very horny dean off to tghe office
, where he ends up inaddition tje arms ofthe his new secretary
. just as yhe two are about to get overtly physical
, max bursts inot hte room
and catches them
. the
" horrified
" bride dissolves the union
, garnering a healthy cash settlement along thte way
. of course
, the secretary wass raelly her daughter page
( hewitt
)
and tjhe whole thing ws a set
- uv
. the women move on
,
but an irs agent
( bancroft
) catches up with them
and demands a huge ammount of money to cover unpaid taxes
. in despreate ened of funds
, max
and page head for palm beach to replay the scam
. their mark this time is william b
. tensy
( hackman
, in hideous amking
- uv
)
, a decrepit tobbaco tycoon obssessed iwth the joys ofthe smoking
. max starts to put hte game into action
,
bu page is so repelled by hte ood man
(
and angry with her mom
) taht she slips off to enact her own score
, targeting jack
, a layed back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune
. complications arise when page realizes that ogod
- natured jack isnt stirring actual emotions in her steely littel heart
. as if that wasn ' t enough
, dean reappears on tje scene with revenge on his mind
. the attemp to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior
" a fish called wanda
.
" i won ' t bother to compare the twpo
. suffice to sday that everything done right in
" wanda
" is done wrong here
.
" heartbreakers
" is soulless
, inept
adn
, at 123 mintues
, at least a half
- hour too long
. sigourney weaver
and jennifer lveo hewitt throw themselves into their parts
,
bu have nowhere to go with the metallic cahracters
. gene hackman is utterly wasted infront a one
- onot
, oney
- joke part thgat hasnt him doign nothing
bu smoking
, coughing
and waxing rhapsodic baout smoking
adn sex
. poore jason lee isnt stuck in the ingenue role
and the normaly charismatic actor comes off as merely bland
. ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bited of humanity
and humor inot his walking clich
?
,
bu only a bit
. the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad anough to make boris
and natasha wince
, while donig half
- assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue
. bear in mind
,
though
, thgat this is merely hte worst segment ofthe a movei made uv ofthe nothing
but low points
. if you remember bob hope specials with fondness
, thsi might be your cup of tea
. as for me
, i ' m goign to watch
" a fish called wanda
" nowe
and try to foreget i ever saw
" heartbreakers
.
