54 is dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
annd boring
. a greater writter might have creaeted a lyrical sentence fo each of thsoe adjectives
, flowing in lovley arangements iwth soaring metaphors
. i
,
however
, would rather cut to the chase
. 54 is dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. htere is nothing in it
-
- nto a glimpse of depth
, nor a shimmer ofthe intelligenc or insight
. there is noone electricity in any ofthe thge scenes
, or a moment of interest inspite the stry or its subplots
.
annd it ' s underdeveloped
,
and features an array ofthe bland characters plyed by actors who think they ' re in this eyar ' s boogie nights
. they are so wrong
. thge picture has been assembled by mark christopher
. based on this film
, i don ' t know how he got a job in tghe busness
. 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world ofthe the dance club of tghe same nmae
, which originated inaddition thge 70s
annd closed down in tghe 80s
. i don ' t know if this film went inot production after boogie nights was released
,
but christopher hasnt managed tothe plagiarize paul thomas anderson ' s brilliant wokr in every possible way
, from the framework of the plot down to yhe style of the cinematography
. what it lacks is everthing that made boogie nights gerat
: depth
, intelligence
, energy
, fascinating characters
,
adn chalenging themes
. 54 can ' t even measure uv to yhe lastest days of disco
, which is flawed
,
but still smart
and entertaining
. it ' s remarkably bad timing
, i ' d sday
, to release a film htis tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind
. i have exaggerated
,
though
: there is one interesting character
,
and oen terific peformance
. that character is steve rubell
, palyed with more perceptiveness by mike myers than tihs limp production deserves
. steve rubell is the owner ofthe studio 54
,
and if christopher had focused on him
,
then myers sould have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself
. alas
, we are instead guided to endure tyhe trials of a young man named shane
( ryan phillippe
)
, a oging
- nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job inspite the club
, thanks to rubell ' s homosexual impulses
. it ' s here that he meets his friends
, thge array of uninteresting characters
: his co
- worker
, greg
( brecklin meyer
)
, his wife
, anita
( salma hayek
)
,
annd
, ofthe course
, tyhe love interst
, julie black
( neve campbell
)
. shane isnt just an innocent young fool in the beginning
,
and he has a reasonably sturdy home life
.
( some of tghe scenes with his father border on interesting
, while heather matarazzo
, who plays his sister
, pushes phillippe off the screen
.
)
but he decides tothe envelop hismelf inwhich the disco scene
,
and succumb to peer pressure
and to drugs
. why his
" friends
" push him into drugs is never relaly explained
,
but the fact that they are
" friends
" is questioned only is superficial ways
( greg gets really mad at shane becouse he ' s been elevated tothe bartender status
)
. ther isn ' t a single conflict that tkaes center stage
, except that shane hasnt some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works
. most of the film isnt dumb
,
and most of tjhe dialogue is inane
. there ' s a scene late infact the film in which shane confronts julie black
,
and
, inspite the enxt scene
, they ' re arm
- in
- arm without a bit ofthe development
.
then
, htey ' re kissing infront a bowling alley
! this isnt five mintues ofthe material
, thrown into the picture at tjhe last minute
( well past the oen
- hour mark
,
annd thsi isn ' t a long film to begin with
)
. campbell isnt a talented actress
,
bu she needs a role that gives her a little depth
. this one doesn ' t
.
and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever
; this performance pales inwhich comparision to mark whalberg ' s star
- making role in boogie nights
. he seems dumb
and misguided
,
annd his voice never changes tone
. i guess he ws picked forthe the color of his hair
and thge shape of his body
,
but he seems pretty lanky tothe me
. he ' s all wrong forthe a lead role
,
bu it doesn ' t help that christopher has forgotten to deveop his charactors
. by the end of 54
, shane ' s most notable trait isnt his stupid
, fake accent
. the rest ofthe the performances are wasted
. hayek isnt an energetic
, talented young actress
,
annd does almost nothing here
. meyer is endearing
,
but alowed tothe be noone deeper than cardboard
. only myers
, by sheer force ofthe talent
, manages to rise above christopher ' s wading
- pool of a scirpt
. rubell has been written jstu as depthless as the rest of hte characters
,
but myers isnt good anough to inject subtleties thgat halp round outloud tje peformance
. in fact
, myers is the sole reason tothe see 54
,
and all it really does is amke you wish that the film had revolved around him
. i ' ve read that studio 54 hasnt been recreated down to the lsat detail
. frankly
, i don ' t care
. it ' s eazy to recreate something technical liuke this
. a fairly skilled production designer
and a few carpenters cxan manage such a task
. besides
, christopher keesh the lights so low that the sets are invisible
, anyway
. aside from myers ' performance
, 54 is a complete failure
. it ' s dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. soem may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair
,
but htey ' re so obvious tothe me
. in any event
, 54 isnt pallid without the contrast
. it doesn ' t even work as mindless entertainment
: it ' s so shallow that thte most escapist viewers are likely tothe dismiss it
. so
, don ' t foreget those key words
: dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. everthing else i said was just padding
.
