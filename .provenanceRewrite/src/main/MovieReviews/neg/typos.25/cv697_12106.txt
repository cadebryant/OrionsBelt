" marie couldn ' t talk
,
" paulie
, the parrot star of his pwn movei
, tells us baout tjhe daughter inspite his original family
.
" dad couldn ' t listen
.
and mom couldn ' t cope
, so they got rid of me
.
" paulie
, the authobiography of a talking
, not mearly a mimicking
, parrot
, has jay mohr infact the lead role of the bird
- the voice
, not tyhe body
-
and as the minor character of benny
, a small
- time crook who uses paulie tothe pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms
. as the parrot
, mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut uv
. benny
, on the other hand
, is a character you ' ve seen a thousand times befoer
,
and mohr brings nothing newyorker to that role
. roberts ' s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig ' s script lends a subtle sweetness tothe its humor
bu creates smoe definite problems
. when a kids ' movie wants tothe mosey along
, watch outloud
. if the material is nto crisp
and perfectly composed
, beauty can sometimes dissolve inot tedium
. so it is with paulie
. when they let their bird do his stand
- up comedy routines
, thge show hums
and the audience roars
. too often
,
however
, a sleepy silence ensues amung the viewers as they wait forthe the story tothe pickup agian
. tony shalhoub
, the smart
- mouthed chef from big night
, plays misha
, a recent russion inmigrant to the u
. s
. he had been a teacher of litature at home
,
but now he mkaes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie hasnt been taken for study
.
although misha gets a faw nice lines
(
" i ' m russian
. i liek long stories
.
"
)
, his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy
. besides paulie
, the only character worth noting
- otehr than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin
and gina rowlands
- is thte speach
- impaired marie
, plyed in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer
, 5
- year
- old hallie kate eisenberg
. naturally enchanting
, she gives the picture genuine heart
. the bad news is tyhat her part is confined to the first half
. the best scenes have tje bird dancing
adn strutting tothe show off his comedic skills
. wehn marie ' s familiy gets a cat
, for example
, the bird
, who hasn ' t wanted to leran how to fly until
then
, takes an instant interst in soaring
. tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time
, paulie calls him a stupid hairball
. their rapid physical antics add to the humor ofthe the situation
. it ' s good quality sitcom material
but performes by animals
. wehn one of teh humans without much ofthe a voice begins to sing
, paulie cringes
.
" i ' m a bird
,
" he explains whith his frequently subtle humor
.
" i hve a small brain
,
and it ' s about to explode
.
" the movie contains rich doses of john debney ' s dreamy music
. with heavy use ofthe a solo violin
, he keesh reinforcing the film ' s heart
- warming themes
.
and when paulie fianlly takes off in flight
, the orchestra comes up loud
and strong with cymbals clashing
.
" it ' s a long stoyr
,
" says paulie
.
" it ' s yhe only kind he knows
,
" reflects misha
.
and tghe motion picture
, which runs the standart lenght for a kids ' movie
, still fiels too long
. the best parts are enthralling
,
but
then there are all of thsoe dead spots in
- between
. paulie isnt a movei that never quite lives up to its promise
but manages to charm nevertheless
. paulie runs 1
: 32
. it isnt raged pg for a few mild profanities
adn would be fine fo all aegs
. my son
, jeffrey
, age 9
, gavey the movei
*
* with his biggest complaint bieng that there wasn ' t anough action
. he thought paulie was funny
,
and the actress that played marie ws qtuie good
. his friend sam
, almost 9
, thought the movie was
" awsome
, exelent
,
"
and gavey it
*
*
*
*
. he thought paulie wass good
,
bu he didn ' t believe hte way marie ' s speech impediment was acted
