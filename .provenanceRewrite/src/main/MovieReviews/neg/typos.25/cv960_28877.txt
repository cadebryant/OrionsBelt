) isnt becoming disillusioned
. paleontology is no longer yhe sexy science it once was sicne the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter
. his lectures bring people intersted inspite his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research
and funding dollars are drying uv

( the notorious site b of
" yhe lost world
"
) he ' s disdainful
,
but once they wave thier checkbook
, he reconsiders
.
howver thge kirbys haven ' t given dr

.
" of course
, we
, thte audience
, have been tipped off

, nowe marryied to another wiht a young son who calls grant ' hte dinosaur man ' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for tghe film ' s poorly imagined finale
. grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip
, whihc is really an illegal gambit to save their son
, that young paraglider
. the couple aren ' t millionaires
, making grant ' s check bogus
,
and they ' re separated as well
( eric was with amanda ' s new boyfriend
, not that that makes much sence
)
, meaning we ' re iin fo some gooey family dynamics while waiting forthe the dino dining
. the kirbys hired hands
(
and obvious bait
) are a threesome led by mr

" jurassic park iii
" is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos
( a spinosauraus
, which goes head tothe head with the t
- rex
,
and pteranodons
)
. the plot
, as it weere
, is a sories ofthe coincidences combined wiht extreme leaps of faith
annd a trifecta ofthe stupid cell phone tricks
. the effects are noone longer new
,
adn
, as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson
, rather murky looking at times
. film editing by robert dalva
(
" october sky
"
) was presumably done by machete
, to keep this down to a 90 minute run timne
. i know of no other reason to explain hte ridiculous ending which features the survivers confronting a pack of raptors
,
then being saved by the most ludicrous ofthe logic jumps withing a few minutes
. ' original ' music by don davis jsut repeats john williams ' orginal themes
. while neill
and young morgan attempt tothe inject some humor
and humanity into the proceedings
, the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional
.
" jurassic park iii
" wiull probably provide some quick entertainment fo thsoe who go inot it knowing what tothe expect
, the same crowd who maybe liked
