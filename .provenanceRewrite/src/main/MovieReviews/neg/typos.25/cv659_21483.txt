i cameback to an epiphany hwile watching the bachelor
, an innocuous
- enough
- on
- teh
- surface romantic comedy
. it ' s not the sort of film in wich one owudl expect tothe achivee any moment of clarity
,
bu there it ws nontheless
. i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire rumatic comedy genre circa 1999
. iin a owrd
, it ' s the same thnig tht ' s wrong with so many movies circa 1999
: writing
. mroe to the point
, it ' s hte refusla to acknowledge tyhat characterizations matter whn you ' re telling a story about a relationship
. the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we ' re expected to get dewy
- eyed over any pairing ofthe attractive
, pleasnat people just beccause they ' re attractive
and pleasant
. in htis particular case
, attractive
and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon
( chris o ' donnell
)
, a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly
but surelly sucked into marriage
. it ' s a csary notion for jimmy
, even
though he dearly loves attractive
and pleasent exibit b anne
( renee zellweger
)
, his girlfriend of three years
. convinced dispite his reservations that it ' s time tothe
" sh
* t or get off the pot
,
" jimmy proposes to anne
-
- vrey badly
. anne refuses
, which leaves jimmy in a vyre odd position when his eccentric granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies
and leaves a very specific video will
. jimmy stands to inhereit
$ 100 million if he is marryed by 6
: 05 p
. m
. on his 30th birthday
, stays married for 10 years
adn produces a child
. there are only a couple of minor problems
: 1
) jimmy ' s 30th birthday is the enxt day
; 2
) anne is nowhere to be foudn
, meaning jimmy has tothe fidn another willing bride from among his many ex
- girlfriends
. it ' s a wacky
, brewster ' s millions
- esque premise
( acknowldeged as such in oney of yhe film ' s better
, more self
- aware lines of dialogue
)
, the kind where a shallow
and materialistic guy lerans what really matters
. at least that would be the case if jimmy weren ' t already a world
- class altruist
. screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition inaddition the wiull
: if jimmy doesn ' t get married
, not onyl will he loose all the money
,
but yhe family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him
, costing hudreds of jobs
. from the outset
, jimmy ' s motivation isn ' t cash
; it ' s the livelihoods of his devoted employees
. it ' s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor ' s plot development
. by any human standard
, thge guy is impossibly selfless
.
and that ' s the esence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachler
-
- the fear of giving tyhe characters flaws to overcome on thier way tothe happiness
. there ' s never any tension between the two star
- crossed lovers
, because ther ' s no sence thgat anything remotely significant is at stake
. thge blandly nice o ' donnell couldn ' t pull off a randy cad if he tried
, so the filmmakers don ' t even let him
; zellweger ' s anne may have issues iwth her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to
,
but no one dares make her anything
bu the woman
( lightly
) wronged
.
adn forget about seeing enough ofthe jimmy
and anne together tothe feel invested in theri potential reconciliation
. the parade of sit
- com set pieces had better be damned funny
, sicne they ' re all that stands between us
adn a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion
. i ' ll admit a cuple of those set pieces are amusing
, including ustinov ' s rantings baout procreation
and a restaurant full
- to
- bursting with men popping questions
and champagne corks
. far more of them are eather tedious or downright ghastly
, like the shudder
- inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune
- hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather infront a church
. you ' re never oging to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachler
,
bu that ' s not the real problem
. nor is it the rela problem that you nkow exactly hte kind of warm
- n
- fuzzy conclusion it ' s leading uv tothe
. tghe problem are a beginning
and middle tath are equally warm
- n
- fuzzy
-
- there ' s no spark
, noone energy
, no humanity
. it ' s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offen any consumer ' s digestions
. we ' ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don ' t even hvae a pulse
. the bachler isnt love among thge mannequins
.
