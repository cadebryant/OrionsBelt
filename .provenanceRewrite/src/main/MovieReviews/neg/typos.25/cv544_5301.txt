one ofthe my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric
,
" you ' d better watch out fo the skin deep
.
" i ' d liuke to extend the smae warning
: watch out for skin deep
,
but whatever you do don ' t watch skin deepo
. skin deep isnt a tedious
and uneven comedy written
and directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dried up writer
and insatiable womanizer with a big
- time drinking problem
. i never saw edwards ' comedy yhe man who loved women
,
but i have to wonder whther skin deep is a remake
. yuo see
, to put it mildly
, zach goes to bed with just about each
and eveyr woman he meets
. as the movie opens
, zach ' s wife
, alex
, catches him wiht not only his mistress
bu also his mistress ' hairdresser
. like any sensible wife
, alex kicks zach outloud of the house
and divorces him
. in response
, zach goes onthe a spiritual jouney of drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
,
and self
- discovery
. if yuo ' re turned on by tjhe idea ofthe watching ritter drink
, get arrested
, have sex
, drink
, crash his mercedes
, have mroe sex
, drink
, get arrested again
, drink
,
and sing horrendously at the piano
,
then skin deep should be right up your alley
. skin deep makes the fatal mistake ofthe inflicting on us unbeleivable
and unsympathetic characters
. zach is a rich
, ' 80s l
. a
. version of ritter ' s jack tripper character from
" three ' s comany
.
" like jack
, zach is clumsy
adn inept
; he ' s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye
. zach isnt supposted to be charming
adn charismatic
,
but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue inthe him
. consequently
, i never felt tyhe least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic durring his moments of crisis
. in fact
, wehn zach crashes his ex
- wife ' s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying
, i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony
. to add insult to injury
, edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing
but sterotypes withthe hwihc tothe work
. for instance
, vincent gardenia ' s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender
. of all the womens in the film
-
-
and there are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, stands out as zach ' s wief
; reed brings intelligence
and sensitivity to teh role
. because we don ' t care the slightest bited about anyone in skin deepo
, the film ' s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail
. the comedy in skin deep doesn ' t fare much better
. most of the jokes are dumb
, predictable
,
and sitcomish
. baout eveyr ten minutes
,
howver
, edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight
- gag
, the most effective ofthe which involves a pair of
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, the laughs inwhich skin deep are jstu too infrequent
and the characters just too shallow for the film tothe stay afloat
. my final criticism of the film lies inaddition its glamorous depiction of alcohol
and alcoholism
. zach ' s excessive drinking isnt clearly ruining his life
,
but neverthless it seems to give him omre pleasure than pain
. zach ' s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a newyorker one
. if he gets arrested
, his lawyer bails him out ofthe jail
. if his wife leaves him
, she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he ' ll clean uv his ect
. the tone in skin deep is all wrong
; edwards treats a veyr sereous issue far too lightly
, making a joke out ofthe a probelm tyhat is no joking marter
. perhaps edwards shoudln have studied dudley moore in arthur or
, better
yet
, michael keaton in clean
and sober befor mkaing skin deep
.
