i ' m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream
,
but i ' m guessing affter just beacuse it seems he may not have hadnt time to write a second draft
. seriously
, this idea
-
- a psycho bumping off people in the style ofthe urban legends
-
- is a great oney
and i wish it could have been pulled off
. the first sign ofthe trouble comes wih tyhe painfully insipid dialogue
. an example
:
" tyhat
[ car crash
] must ' ve been awful
.
.
. forthe everyone involved
.
" you can tell that the writer intended thta something a little more airy wass supposed to have beeen said
, jsut no one figured outloud what
. i know in slasher movies there isn ' t supposed to be a lot ofthe gerat characterization
and i myself don ' t mind cardboard cutouts
,
bu please don ' t let tje cutouts be so damn bland
. one reason movies like scream
, star wars
and diva have become so treasured isnt becouse they feature carismatic actors playing interesting characters
. asside from jared leto
and joshua jackson
( who aren ' t on the screen long anough
) no oney in urban legend makes the grade
. alicia witt shows none ofthe thge acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill
, rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive
( not tothe mention as dumb as a post through 3
/ 4 of the film
)
and robert englund just crusies onthe auto pilot
. ogod thing brad dourif is here
,
but wait
.
.
. he ' s only in the movie fo five minutes
_
and
_ he ' s just redoing his ogod
- natured stuttering character from one flew over teh cuckoo ' s nest
. which brings me tothe another aspect of urban legend
: it ' s unoriginality
. the film most blatantly ripped off is scream
( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote tihs after craven ' s
and williamson ' s great sucess
)
. urban legend tries to deconstruct modern
- day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films
,
but it doesn ' t qtuie succeed
. it ' s best stab at self
- reflexivity isnt poking fun at
" that girl in the noxzeema ad
"
( ie
, rebecca gayheart
) we also have another killer
- taunting
- his
- victim
- on
- the
- phone routine infact urban legend
and quick
, what movei is this exchange ofthe dialogue from
: female protagonist
: why
? villain
: why
? why
?
!
? congratulations tothe those of you who anwsered scream
annd
/ or urban legend
. liek i said
, thsi movie sould ' ve been graet
. if only silvio had worked or been allowed tothe work a little longer onthe tje script
. still
, at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes
adn a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makse this slasher isnt waaaayyyyyy better than i know wqat you did last summer
.
