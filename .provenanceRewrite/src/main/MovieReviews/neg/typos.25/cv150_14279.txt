- claude van damme movies tend to be
, if nothing else
, a lot of mindless fun
. his latest film
,
" knock off
,
" skips on the funn part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise thgat isnt
, well
, simply mindless
. yuo can ' t really blame van damme
. no one
, i suspect
, hasnt ever expeced
" the muscles from brussels
" to contribute a heartfelt performence brimming whith introspection
anbd delicate shades ofthe gray
.
and even his sidekick co
- star
,
" saturday night live
" alumnus rob
" makin ' copies
" schneider
, does what ' s expected of him
,
although neither appear to wnat the role of straight man
. no
, the probelm with the film is its direction
. the first five minutes ofthe the film are incomprehensible
.
.
.
and it goes downhill from htere
! five hundred characters
, it seems
, are introduced within the first fifteen minutes
. van damme doesn ' t land his first kick until after thirty
-
- too late for most action fans
-
-
and by the time thte hour mark hasnt rolled around
, your jaw will be on your cup holder
and you ' ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on thsi mess
. directer hark tsui
, whose previous film ws the van damme
/ dennis rodman teamed
" double team
,
" films at such a frenetic pace thgat it ' s hard tothe nkwo what ' s going on
, who ' s on whose side
,
anbd what hte point of all thsi is
. faster than you can yell
" fruit stand
!
" we ' re watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider bieng bounced allong by an energetic van damme
. wehn schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four
- foot eel while enthusing
" move your beautiful big ass
,
" the movie takes an unprecidented turn to the bizarre
. eveyr nowe
and again
" knock off
" will deliver soem truley ingenious directorial flourishes
-
- inventive camera shots
and angles
, wild rides down gun silencers
and from the tops of buildings tothe the sprawling street below
, revealing cutted
- ins withing tjhe frome
-
-
bu they all happen too quicklyu
,
and withing such a furious frome of reference
, that they ' re wasted
. if onyl hark coudl ahve slowed thigsn down jstu for a minute
. if you ' re interested inspite the plot
, you ' re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from teh on
- screen shenanigans
:
" jean
- claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russina masia plot to terrorize the world with
" nanobombs
" hidden infront cabbage patch knock
- offs
. maybe
. with paul sorvino
.
" a more accurate summary would be
" jean
- claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large
, blatent coca
- cola product placements
.
" the fact thta the film is staged during hong kong ' s last days under british rule gets some lip service
but doesn ' t figure in at all
. perheaps
" knock off
" ' s most intriguing credit is that ron
and russell mael composed tje frenzied music score
. smoe of yuo might remember thte mael brothers as the ' 80s synth pop duo sparks
; their contributions here are as confuzled as the accompanying action
-
-
" kimono my house
" indeed
! liek the cheap jeans
and
" pumma
" sneakers manufactured in hong kong
, van damme ' s latest is a real phony
.
