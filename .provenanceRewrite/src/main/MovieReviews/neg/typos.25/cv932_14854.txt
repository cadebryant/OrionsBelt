( murphy
)
. g wanders onto the televsion set
anbd connects withthe the viewers by telling them that they don ' t really want all that commerical crap
. in soem unexplained manner
, tihs causes sales to sour
. ricky is saved
. the movie tries tothe be too much at once
and fails at it all
. it ' s not an over
- the
- top comedy or a heart
- warming message of humanity
. it
_ is
_ a mish
- mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialouge
. i am willing tothe put uv with preaching from a film
,
but tyhe messages here are ood hat
. you should take time to smell the roses

. goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career
,
bu here he seems to have beeen replaced with a lifeless pod fomr his
" invasion of tghe body snatchers
"
. his relationship with kate makes no sense
. they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen
. preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be
. somwhere hidden deep inside ofthe this film is about ten minutes of value
. an attempt to satirize stupid television
, we get a self
- parody instade
