an 80
- year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch
, wearing tight
- fitting leather
, as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a
` pump
- bitch '
. two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them
.
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch
. welcome to
` ready to rumble '
. judging from the fact thast potty
- mouth adam sandler is the reigining box
- office comedy champion
, you realize
-
- albeit hwile shaking your head
-
- that yes
, htere is an audeince for thsi sort of thing
. ladies
annd gentlemen
, i weep for society
. mind you
, wehn executed with style
and comic ingenuity
, jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel
(
` there ' s something baout mary '
)
and a laxative
- induced attack of explosive diarrhea
(
` dumb
and dumber '
) can be extrememly funny
. unfortunately
,
` ready to rumble ' is not bieng helmed by the farrelly brothers
, nor is it bolstered by a scirpt that accomadates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inpsired
.
` ready to rumble ' is built around tjhe dedicated fan
- base of professional wrestling
.
.
.
. which
, in fact
, sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy
.
bu director brian robbins
and screenwrighter steven brill handcuff themslves
,
and limited to a stampede of asinine
, humdrum bathroom humer
, basically the only thing they manaze is tothe evoke memories ofthe pauly shore
and
` bio dome '
. gordie boggs
( david arquette
)
adn sean dawkins
( scott caan
) take prade in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics
. by day
, they transport raw sewage
. by night
( particularly on
? nitro ' monday
)
, they pay homage tothe their personal hero
anbd savior
- jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
, yhe undisputed leader of the proffesional wrestling comunity
. with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance
, gordie
and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first
- hand
.
bu unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair
( joe pantoliano
, sporting long hair
and cowboy boots
) has other plans
. sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page
( playing himself
) pummel the king into the tarp
, thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler
and embarrassing him in front ofthe a bewildered autotorium full of fans
. gordie
and sean are shocked
, rioting madly hwile arguing
` this isn ' t even a pay
- persay view event
!
! ' they take it upon themslves to track the king down
and suply tyhe encouragement essential for their fallen idol to amke a come
- back attempt
. along the way
, you can expect a lot ofthe sh
-
- jokes as well
. you may fidn something to like in
` ready tothe rumble ' if a
) ytou are a rasslin ' aficionado yourself
, or b
) you are a dedicated fan ofthe the lowest of low
- brow comedies
. i welcome low
- brow humor with open arms
- tyhat is
, if its fresh
adn resourceful
.
` rumble ' is nothing
but a sloppy
, frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation
. tje first half
- hour is the ultimate test of patience
. luckily
, the simple
- minded events pick up steam
, particularly with the well
- choreographed wrestling action
. director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality
and excitement of football inaddition
` varsity blues '
,
and when in the ring
, he does professional owrk
.
bu the violence is too excessive
. having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart ' s tragic accident just last year
, especially with one character ' s dive during a cage match
. tihs is not something you watn a comedy to be reminescent of
. outside tjhe wrestling action
, tjhe lewd jokes
and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to thge term
? scattershot '
, hwile the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10
, with brill ' s exstensive vocabulary ranging from
` diddly ' to
` boob '
and so onthe
. the final tally
: i chuckled a few times
, groaned a lot
,
adn indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105
. casting
- wise
,
` ready to rumble ' isnt an odd duck
. oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure
? he ' s perhaps a bited chunky
,
bu fellow wrestlers acknowledge htis in the ring by calling him
` fatty '
, which dampens the blow i supose
. rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader
(
` the nirto
- est ofthe the nitro girls
, ' proclaims gordie
)
,
bu extra pep isnt added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg
,
` macho man ' randy savage
and sting
( among others
)
. wcw fans are sure to appreciate theese
. others
.
.
. well
, won ' t
. i foudn merit in david arquette ' s bountiful energy as gordie
, whihc brings me to my finishing
.
.
.
. ahhh
.
.
.
.
` praise ' for thge film
: in
` ready to rumble '
, i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette ' s
` at
& t ' televsion commercials
. now there ' s a low blow for you
