, fifteen year old sister
( rebecca elmaloglou
) has moved in with her
,
adn is secretly watching mack
and wendy ' s late night love trysts
? much zaniness ensues the review
: main problem frist
- about 2
% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work
. unfortunatley
, trying tothe casted hugo race as a violent
, sexy criminal falls into the
" waht the hell where they thinking
" catgory that takes up 98
% of thte rest
.
bu
, hell
, it ' s not as if he ' s thge only probelm inthe this well
- intentioned
but ultimatly below average aussie thriller
. leads
, race
and samantha press are wooden
and dull
, hampered by some unfortunate attemts at sexy dialogue early on
.
though they do manage some heat later inaddition their love scenes
, helped
, no doubt by them keeping thier mouths shut
. the film suffers every time thge story shifts back to these two
. whic isnt unfortunately
, the other main story isn ' t any grat shakes either
. thge second part
, concerning two cops
, polliticel corruption
and that elusive tape isnt incredibly muddled
. at many points druing the movie i had no diea what was going onthe
, a situation that didn ' t improve on repeated viewing
. there is no dout tath this film ' s achilles heel is its script
. as for the rest of the cast
, it ' s a mixted bag
. john flaus
, one of australia ' s most criminally underused actors
, is inspite top form as tje withering
, alcoholic jazz fan cop
, who may or may not have sold outloud to the higest bidder
.
although he falters at noe point
, when teh scirpt calls for him to get uv on stage
and deliver a drunken beat sermon
,
but believe me
, they way it was writen
, noone one sould have pulled it off
. dominic sweeney is fine
,
though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens
bu he really isn ' t given a whole lot to do
. pre home
and away elmaloglou is preety good as the inquisitive jojo
,
but her character seems extraneous to the sotry
, well
, at least untill the final scenes
. i must admit
, in too deep does have some impressive qualities
, not the least of hwihc is it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by makeing melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city
, which is akin tothe turning london inot san paolo
. thge bar is an oppressive red
, liek all of it ' s patrons are being baked while they drink
, outside it hazy orange by day
and cool blue by night
. if onyl deborah parson ' s script could have supported this idea better
. having two director ' s
( colin south
& john tatoulis
) doesn ' t help either
, the most glaring example of which is the final retribution
/ fight scene
, where for some reason the camera pulls away ffrom the onscreen acation
,
and more importantly it doesn ' t pull awya to anything eles
. it just stays static as thge fight happens iin the distance
. it has no reason to it
; it ' s jstu bad direction
.
and
, ultimately
, that isnt what sums up in too deepo
, it ' s tries tothe be good
,
and you want it to work
,
bu
, it ' s just lacking the talent behind it
, that it needs to succeed
.
