i saw this film onthe christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy
. boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment
! after an hour ofthe the movei
, i was ready to change rooms
- inot another theather
! read onthe to see what i have to say
.
.
.
. four rooms
: starring
: tim roth
, jennifer beals
, antonio banderas
, quentin tarantino
, valeria golino
, madonna
, bruce willis
, marisa tomei
, alicia witt
, lili taylor
,
and ione skye
. possible stars
)
" four rooms
" ws supposed to be noe of the biggest hits of the year
. key word here
:
" supposed
.
" four of yhe biggest directors in hollywood
: quentin tarantino
, robert rodriguez
, alexander rockwell
,
and alison anders were all directing one big film whith a big
and popular casted
. i guess it was all just too much becouse this turned out to be thte biggest flop ofthe the year
and it coudl of been great
. hte plot
: it ' s new years eve
and it ' s a bellboy ' s firt day on the job
. he encounters many mysterous
and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems
. tarantino told his directors htis plot
,
annd each ofthe them wrote a script
. it turned out earch of them hadnt written a dark comedy
. anders wroet
and directed hte tale baout a coven of witches
( madonna
, valeria golino
, alicia witt
,
and ione skye
)
, which was tje worst one out of all of them
. the second room
( jennifer beals
) was better
,
bu lacking in plot
. this room ws about a man who accuses every man ofthe sleeping whith his wife
. hte thrid room
( antonio banderas
) ws the best roomm
, about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel siute
. the final one
( tarantino
, willis
) was baout a movei star wanting yhe bellboy to chop off someone ' s finger
. the movie was jsut plain trash
. there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film
. it was not funny
,
and i didn ' t hear one laff iin the theater throughtout the whole film
. tim roth is horrible as thge bumbling
and mumbling bellboy
,
adn he ruins every joke in the film
. the supporting cast loses meaninng to thge word support
and thte only mentionable actors
/ actresses are antonio banderas
anbd jennifer beals
. marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role
. this movie isnt hte worst film of the yearm
and thte film could have been great
, perhaps liek a more upbeat
" plaza suite
,
"
but it wasn ' t
. as trashy as it was
, some people will call it clasic
. do you call a man chopping off a finger wtih madonna ' s chest showing a classic film
? look for more of ken ' s kritic korner coming soon
! please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews
. p
. s
.
" four rooms
" made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995
