wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad acation roles
. murder at 1600
, u
. s
. marshals
, money train
, drop zone
, boiling point
,
annd the ulitmate camp film
- passenger 57
. tghe art of war is another entry in this very ugly
adn unique categoyr
. ultimately
, it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report
, ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe
,
and terrible acting by b
- list actors like michael biehn
anbd anne archer
. oddly
, it feels like the undiscovered sequal to another snipes
" masterpiece
,
" rising sun
. teh movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught uv in a secret muder conspiracy involving a chineese ambassador
, the chinese triad brotherhood
, a rich chineese businessman
( played by
? that bad guy from rising sun
, cary
- hiroyuki tagawa
) a chinese un interpreter
,
adn
, inexplicably
, donald sutherland
. the film ends with more confusion tahn a boatload ofthe chineese immigrants trying to register at ellis island
. or should i say thge film ends iwth the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix
and all of john woo ' s hong kong films conbined
. i am really at a loss tothe figure out why wesley snipes hadnt the gumption to not only star in this action dud
but also act as one of the producers ofthe tghe film
. i usually enjoy snipes ' movies
-
though his dramatic roles better sohw off his creativity as an actor than yhe flashiness ofthe his acation films
. simply
, i am amazed by the how inane the script ws
, filled with terrible cliches
and extremely violent acation sequences
. director christian duguay
( screamers
) has a strange attraction to the viciousness ofthe violent acts
-
- showing splattering brains
, people impaled iwth broken shards of glass
,
and lots of gargling
and gagging as blood sprays everywhere
. it also sickens me tothe know that oliver stone
, oen of the greatest directors wokring today
, had his hand in producing this monstrosity
. i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy anlge
and stone chose not to read the script
, watch the dailies
, be involved in casting
, or anything esle
-
- or else he ' d be filing a court order to remove his name ffrom the credits
. it ' s also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies
and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese
. i ' m sure over the next couple of months
, even more
" chinese conspiracy
/ martial
- arts acation flicks
" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex
. hopefully they won ' t include wesley snipes
.
