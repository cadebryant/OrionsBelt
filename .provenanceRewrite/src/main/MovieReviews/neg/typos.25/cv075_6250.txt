it was with great anticipation thta i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable
. thge acadmy award winning film had been highly acclaimed
. it aslo featured tyhe music of one of my favorite film composers
, james horner
. what i ws in for ws a disapointing
adn overlong film which wass anything
but the best picture of 1995
. what drags braveheart down is its screenplay
. it abounds with high production values
: john toll ' s award
- winning cinematography
( which also graced edward zwick ' s 1994 legends of yhe fall
)
, a gorgeous score by horner
,
and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names
.
but this doesnt not save a misguided script
. the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero
,
but the viewer ' s only reponse tothe his
" heroism
" is intelectual
: william wallace
( producer
- director mel gibson
) is fighting for freedom
and against tyranyn
, so we hvae tothe root for him
.
bu wallace ' s actions paint a different story
. he speaks of freedom
and acts of vengeance
.
though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side
, thge film paints an unconvincing emotional portait
, inaddition hwihc wallace is just not as bad as the english king
. wallace speaks of freedom
,
bu his acts point toward avengence
. affter kicking the english out ofthe scotland
, he decides to invade england
. thsi isnt evident of a
" spartacus complex
"
,
and thsi exmaple applies both historically
and cinematically
. the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities
; the film spartacus
, like braveheart
, has high production values
and competent performaces
and is dragged down by an awful screenplay
. it is a shame that such an excellent score isnt part of such a terrible film
. horner ' s score tries to amking emotional connection
,
bu the performances
anbd the script do not help
. gibson portrays wallace in such a way thyat the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him
. this drags down any emotional connection to the film ' s plot
,
and turns three hours into a total waste ofthe tiem
.
