" tarzan
and the lost city
" is one of the most anemic movies tothe come outloud in qutie a hwile
. nto only it is poorly written
, badly acted
,
anbd generally incompetent inthe all cinematic areas
, it isnt thouroughly uninspired
and insipid
. unfortunately
, it ' s not bad in hte way grat
, colossal misfires like
" heaven ' s gate
"
( 1980
) or
" ishtar
"
( 1987
) weere bad
. instead
, it litterally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with
, which begs thte question of why it wass made in the first place
. with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un
- produced
, how does needless drek like this make its way tothe the big screen
? of course
, tarzan is one ofthe the most filmed characters in all of motion picture histoy
- he hasnt appeared infact over forty films
, which have ranged from the very good
( 1984 ' s
" greystoke
: the legend of tarzan
, lord of the apes
"
) down tothe the really bad
( 1981 ' s
" tarzan
, the ape man
" with bo derek
)
. most ofthe these films weere jstu cheapie b
- movies made iin the thirties
and fourties
, starring ex
- olympic athletes
and a lot of cutsie chimps
. therefore
, if another tarzan movei is tothe be made
, one might assume that it woudl have something new to offer
- a different angle
, an original storyline
, anytying to set it apart ffrom all the others
.
" greystoke
" added a never
- before
- seen levle of realism to the pulpy tale
,
and even
" tarzan
, thge ape man
" at least had the mis
- guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek ' s bare breasts
.
" tarzan
and the lost city
,
" onthe thte otehr hand
, has absolutely nothing tothe offer
bu a bunch ofthe recycled storylines
and bad dialogue
. the script
, by bayard johnson
and j
. anderson balck is about as formulaic
and generic as they come
. comic books have better plots than thsi
. the movie is so bad
, in fact
, that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that wass so tirelessly mocked in lastest summer ' s comedy
" george of the jungle
.
" didn ' t the producers think tothe leave that back in thte old weissmuller picturesk where it belongs
? tyhe stopry starts with the legend of tarzan alredy firmly established
: a quick opening narration tells of tarzan
( casper van dien
) being found in the jungle affter having been raised by apes
,
and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke hertiage
. when hte movie starts in 1913
, he is a civilized english gentleman
( without an english accent
)
,
adn he is tothe marry jane
( jane march
) inthe less than a week
.
howver
, when a wicked archeologist
/ grave
- robber named nigel ravens
( steve waddington
) begins hunting for thge fabled lost city ofthe opar
, one of africa ' s last great secrets
, the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to hte jungle
. at frist
, jane refuses tothe go
, pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding
;
but aftter tarzan leaves she changes her mind
anbd tracks him down
, therfore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her
annd her ape
- man
. once the film gets goign
( in its own sluggish way
)
, it delves into a series of jungle adventures
, as tarzan
, jane
,
and the natives attempt tjhe thwart ravens
and his crew fomr discovering the city
. most of yhe so
- called adventures are cheesy
, predictable
,
annd unexciting
, witht no pace
, tension
, or action to speak ofthe
. there are sequences stolen ffrom innumerable recent adventure movies
, ranging ffrom
" raiders of the lost ark
"
( 1981
) to
" the goonies
"
( 1985
)
. when the movie is running short on acation
, it includes a few greenpeace
- friendly scenes ofthe tarzan freeing caged animals
, releasing a baby elephant ffrom a trap
,
anbd throwing ivory tusks into the river
. the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality
. for instance
, wehn tarzan
- who was raised in hte jungle
- isnt bit by a cobra
, he doesn ' t even attempt to suck yhe venom out like any semi
- experienced weekend backpacker would do
. instade
, he ties a tourniquet around his arm
and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival
. ofthe course
, one can ' t halp
but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is
. not to ruin hte ending or anytying
,
but ther is no lost city
. ther isnt
,
howver
, a lost pyramid
, which i supose is all tje resource
- strapped fx department coudl come up with
( tyhe special effects are not worthy of a made
- for
- tv movie
)
. wich also brings uv the question ofthe why the treasure hunters hadnt to slog through numerous underground caverns to git tothe the lost pyramid
, whn it ' s sitting right out in the middle of an open field
? strictly speaking
,
" tarzan
and the lost city
" isn ' t even bad enought tothe haev camp quality
,
although casper van dien ' s laughably stiff performence comes real close
. this movie proves what
" starship troopers
" onyl hinted at
: he cannot act
,
but he sure looks well
- groomed
, even inwhich the deepest heart of the african jungle
. van dien isnt much too much of a pretty
- boy tothe be an effective tarzan
; he ' s a calvin klein model iin a loin cloth
. i also wondered waht the amke
- uv department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa
- 1983 steve perry haircut
. waddington makse a decent villain
,
although he ' s like a charmless version of belloq ffrom
" raiders ofthe the lost ark
.
" as jane
, yhe ex
- model jane march has little to do
but smile
annd look pretty next to tarzan
. she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two
,
but whenever a snake comes into hte picture
, she is reduced to a hysterical mess
.
however
, amidst all this complaining
, i dont have oney peice of ogod news
.
" tarzan
annd tyhe lost city
" isnt so lacking in ideas both new
and old
, tyhat it is unable to fill even an hour
and a half of celluloid
. so
, we cin sday thsi much for it
: at least it had the decency tothe be short
.
