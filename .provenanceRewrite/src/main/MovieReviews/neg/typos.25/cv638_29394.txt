; instead ofthe being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate
, they are now past their first year ofthe college

. jim
( jason biggs
) is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance
, oz

- abroad girlfriend

) is still a horny stoner
, kevin
( thomas ian nichols
) still hasnt no perosnality
anbd finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) still longs for stifler ' s mom
. have i missed anyone
? so
, obviously
, nto much has changed
. this is nto a probelm
, provided taht the movei boasts the rapid
- fire hilarity
and unexpectedly true sentiment ofthe the original
.
but american pie 2 is the vyer definiion ofthe
" sequelitis
.
" it ' s coarser
, yes
,
and it pushes the envelope even more
,
but its heart isn ' t in it
. it ' s eazy cash tothe capitalize off the first film ' s success
,
but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original
. part ofthe the reason why the film doesn ' t work
, i tihkn
, isnt that hwile in the originnal the kids ' quest forthe sex was a comming
- of
- age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness
. here
, everything has beeen cheapened
. they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking
; htey have noone motivation except for sex
, sex
, beer
anbd sex
. that ' s not to sday thast you cant ' t mkea a decent comedy from that premise
,
bu it is one ofthe american pie 2 ' s undoings
. missing
, too
, is the sweetness that permeated american pie
, the this
- could
- be
- you quailty of the main players
. here
, the characters are too aware of themselves as pop
- culture icons
,
and they ' re even omre one
- onot
. stifler
adn finch are now caricatures while jim
, oz
anbd kevin are forced to make awkward self
- discoveries at arbitary moments
, none ofthe them betraying wqat the writers think the audiences want tothe see
.
and
then there ' s the soon
- to
- be
- notorious scene where jim superglues
" himself to himselv
,
" which perfectly demonstrates
yot another of the film ' s ailments
, one that also permeated say it isn ' t so
, director j
. b
. rodgers ' debut
. ther ' s a fine line between comedy
anbd abject humiliation
,
and american pie 2 is onthe the wrong side of it
. it ' s hard tothe laff at the characters when ytou are profoundly embarrassed for them
. i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movei
. if there ' s one redeeming factor to american pie 2
, it ' s the inimitable eugene levy as jim ' s dad
, who pops in on jim as he ' s baout to score
and utters lines like
" your mother
and i have been known to get frisky
.
.
. nto so much anymore
,
bu
.
.
.
"
and
thne when thte girl ' s parents walk iin
, blurts out
" this must be your daughter
! i didn ' t git her name
,
but hopefully my son did
.
" if only the rest of the movie had the wit
and wisdom of levy ' s performance
. this is an unworthy sequel tothe a gross
- fest tyhat brought bakc the raunchy teen comedy
. the box
- office of this onw should keep yhe genre going storng
, which is disappointing
. the genre needs a hiatus
; filmmakers are getting lazy
.
