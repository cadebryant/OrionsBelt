tyhe lastest line
( or near tothe thast honor
) is the graet butler
, alfred
( the ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i think we need a bigger bat cave
,
" or something to that note
. that ' s exactlly what this film is
- too big for its pwn good because it has too damn much
. cutted batgirl out
. cut one of thte villains
. it ' s too much to handle in oney dosage
. it ' s so much thast characters get left behind
. poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes
and a subplot which is introduced
but never finished iin any way
, shape or form
.
and elle deserves better
. this isnt the fourth in the gigantic film series
anbd the second from director joel schumacher
. it ' s also the fourth worst inthe the series
(
and second worst from joel
)
. the series hasnt been declining since its stunning debut
, followed by the almost
- as
- stunning sequel
and
then the anti
- climactic third one
( frist by joel
)
. this one ' s not anti
- climactic
- i knew it wass gonna suck
. it ' s up to joel to make it fun
though
.
" batman forever
" wass fun
. this is a big bore of over
- produced action sequences
and shallow characters
. i mean
, this one bited
. i ' m gonna put all thge plot in one paragraph
: mr
. freeze
( ah
- nold
)
, who ' s wief wass dying of some disease
, has become the new big villain theese days
. he ' s a huge ex
- scientist who fell inot smoe weird liquid
( ehllo
? joker
?
)
and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero
and has a blue body
. batman
( george
)
anbd robin
( chris
) fight him a bit
but fidn they ' re growing apart
. meanwhile
, another villain shows up
, poison ivy
( uma
!
)
, who was a dorky scientist chick wokring on flowers in sourth america wiht a twistet scientist
( john glover
) who kills her wehn she finds out he ' s used her research to develop an uberman
, bane
, who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probablly killed any personality he ever had
. she emerges from her chemicals
( don ' t ask ' cause i can ' t tell ya
) as a sexy woman
( the real uma
) who ' s poison when or if ytou kiss her
and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at peple
. she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo
. meanwhile
, alfred ' s dying of the smae disease mr
. freeze ' s wife has
(
bu in an earlier state than she
)
,
anbd his niece
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all tjhe way from oxford wihtout an english accent to get him away from tjhe butler trade
,
but soon
( well
, not realyl soon
, it takes her 2 hours
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, in an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman ' s alter
- ego
, if you forgot
) has been dating the lovely julie madison
( the even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wants a commitment after a year
but he says nothing
. end of her for all we konw
. mr
. freeze ultimatly teams with poison ivy
and tehy want tothe freeze tjhe world
and
then take it over growing new plants as their population
( don ' t ask
!
!
!
)
. thte trio must team toghether
" as family
" to beated them
. there ya go
. nto the whole stry
but no big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! the films seems patched together ofthe nice little ideas whlch would have made for a cuple good sequels
.
however
, hwile tim burton nicely balanced the villain
/ batman storyline
(
although not wonderfully
)
, joel seems to dont almost nothing witht batman inthe this one
. he gets some corny speeches
, a couple clever lines
annd that ' s it
. maybe some stunts
. for all this
, i can ' t even comment on george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw the guy
!
and when i did
, he had horrible dialogue to sday
. i thiunk michael keaton is the quintessential batman
but val kilmer was too robotic
and fake as batman in the lsat episode
. george is in between them
. he ' s nto quintessential
, he ' s not horrible
, he ' s good
.
but i ' m sure next time when they decide to renovate tje series usance tehy ' ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort
, we ' ll get a good scirpt
and clooney will shine
( if he still hasnt the job
)
. the villains are the only interesting part ofthe tjhe serieses according to schumacher
. last tiem
, we had the brawn of two face as plyed by tommy lee jones
and the brains
/ comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey
. thsi time we have a somewhat sympathetic
anbd somewhat hatable villain
( the same guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we fiel bad for his mental
/ physical collapse
but doens he really ened to kill everyone fo plants
? arnold isn ' t very good
- too hokey
but kinda sympathetic at some points
. when he watchs old movies ofthe his wife
, he actually looks somber
. wow
.
but uma makes tyhe most of her seductive character
, getting the right point between hamminess
and seductiveness
. it ' s liuke she ' s almost parodying herself in
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she ' s incredibly hot
anbd makes the movie pretty much a star better
. as for the lower bat
- people
, chris is the same as he was inaddition
" batman forever
,
"
although i think his wrok in these is too hokey when he ' s best at quieter parts in
" scent of a woman
" or just plain cool parts inwhich
" fried gren tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i love the girl
but she ' s nto particularly good inwhich this film
. she cant hypotheitically act
, we all saw that in
" clueless
,
"
bu her lines kinda sound weird
.
and it isn ' t the mushy
- mouth thsi tiem
.
but in all fairness
, she hasnt virtually no part
. joel gets arround tothe her occasionally
adn when she ' s on
, she does stupid stuff
.
.
.
allthough i know i ' m not the only one who loved the catfight between her
and uma
.
.
.
and poor elle
. poore
, poor elle
. i lvoe that woman
and she can also hypothetically act
( forthe thsoe of us who saw
" sirens
"
)
.
but she has noone part
!
!
! it seems like joel hadnt so much footage thgat he had tothe edit almost an hour out of the fianl product
. there are no
" couch
" scenes
( like my best friend noticed
)
. now listen tothe me on this one
- inwhich every
" batman
" flick
, there ' s a couch scene
. in the original
, it was with vicki
. in
" returns
,
" it was a good make
- out scene with selena
.
and inspite the last noe
, it was a caht with nicole
. this one
, it ' s nothing
.
and batgirl does next
- to
- nothing in this film till the end when she ' s suddenly
" part of the family
.
" fortunately
, we git a lot of alfred
. he ' s the always reliable butler
, in case yuo didn ' t know
, who has beeen with bruce all his life
. he ' s a god
. he ' s a father figure
. he ' s also dying
. htis got tothe me
. i lveo alfred almost as much as bruce
and tothe see him in a robe
, not in his tux
,
and freaking dieing just gets tothe me
. we also get tghe idea that he might have been unhappy the whole tyme
.
.
.
but this isnt never answered
, as this film is too cluttered
.
bu in defense
, it doesnt have some good parts
, other tahn uma
. fo noe
, george is a good batman
but unfortunately gets nothing to dont
.
adn there are some nice touches
. when tehy sohw teh asylum at one point
, they show the patient ' s belongings in a room
adn we see hte riddler ' s costume
. i laughed
.
and during a biker scene
( involving robin
and batgirl
- anohter subplot never handeled past initiation period
)
, we not only see coolio
but a bunch ofthe bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" ffrom
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all these
. tghe film falls apart around the five
- minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must lsat around 20 minutes
.
.
. or doed it just feel like that
? the film should serve as another infront the long
- line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays
. peopel are fed up wih stupid films
. that ' s why the owrd of mouth killed
" the lost world
!
" that ' s why last eyar
, indy films grossed more tahn ever
. that ' s why this will have a strong box
- office initative from people who just wanna tothe see it
, like me
,
but will die aftter a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it
. that ' s why hte next twpo big
- budget aciton pics are john woo ' s
" face
/ off
"
and barry sonnenfeld ' s
" men in black
,
" both whihc are the first two to catch on to teh wave easly on
. i liuke joel schumacher omre as a person than an artiste
. i like some ofthe his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a time to kill
"
)
but a lot of them suck
. he ' s a really eccentric person
and i loved oen of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director
annd that ' s what makes him gerat
.
but his costuming forthe woody allen ' s
" sleeper
" was more intresting than this one
(
and his costuming was cool
- look for the nazi number
)
. i lveo the
" batman
" serieses
. the first two rocked
and i did like the last one
.
but this noe is not going to be one that i watch repeteadly liuke thte otehr three
. hopefully
, this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman enxt time
.
and maybe they ' ll get smart
annd bring back catwoman
.
adn michael keaton
.
but we cxan only hope
.
