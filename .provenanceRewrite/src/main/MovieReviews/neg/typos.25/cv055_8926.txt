funny how your expectations cin be defeated
,
and not in ogod ways
. the ghost
annd thge darkness promised
( at least
, it seemed to me to promise
) a hemingwayesque showdown between men
and nature
. what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000
- level material
-
- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters
.
" get new jobs
!
" was oney line
, if i rember correctly
. at tghe end of the 19th century
, col
. patterson
( val kilmer
, whose irish accent comes
annd goes like an african zephyr
) is an engineeer who has been hired to build a brittish railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda
. he isnt having immensley stereotypical problems
: the natives are restless
, his boss is a jerk
,
adn now two man
- eating lions are stalking the work camp
and killing people off
. patterson tries tothe handle the situation hismelf
, incompetently
,
and
hten turns to charles remington
( michael douglas
)
, a hunter of world reknown
( or something like that
)
. tje movei stacks the deck so heavily in favor of thge lions
, they should have gotten top billing
and co
- starred wih siegfried
and roy
. they are nigh
- invulnerable
, as oney comic book put it
,
and this isnt of course just the excuse the movie needs tothe hvae one native after another stepping forth tothe solmenly recite lines baout the power ofthe nature
. give me a break
. the movei hasn ' t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas
; it ' s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us
. even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic
. git htis
: remington ' s big plan is to build a larg scaffold
- liuke structer inaddition the middle of tjhe savannah
, sit on it
,
and wait forthe the lion tothe show up
. he doesnt this
,
and
then gets knocked off by a bird
. by the end of the movei
, the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forhead with my hand
. the acting is forgettable
. douglas doens a good job of portraing a relatively cracked fellow
,
but it ' s nothing he hasn ' t done before
. kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else
, somwhere else
,
and the rest vanish into thte cinematography
. the camera
, by the way
, sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most ofthe thge lion attacks are incoherent
. what doed i expect from htis movie
? i dunno
. smoe real excitment
, i suppose
. a sense that ther weere formidable forces on both sides of this equation
. noone such luck
. i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway ' s
" thge short happy life of francis macomber
"
and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind
.
