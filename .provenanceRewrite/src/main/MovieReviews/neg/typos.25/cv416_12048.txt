despite its exeedingly well
- done visual effects
, 1995 ' s original speices was one big hunk ofthe sci
- fi cheese
, from the wirting to the feeble performances
. so
, coming from such b
- grade roots
, its sequel ' s stunning ineptitude isnt nto terribly surprizing
,
yet at the smae time it is
. it would not have beeen difficult at all for the people behind species ii tothe top the hokey original
,
yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad
, if not even worse
. something is clearly amiss when hte back door left open for a sequel in species
-
- a sewer rat becomes not qutie of this earth after eating a body part ffrom the exploded alien
/ human hybrid sil
-
- is never entered inot
( perhaps thgat was left for species iii
-
-
though i ' m not giving away anything when i sday taht this installment has an open back doorjam of its pwn
)
. the alien fun
and games begin this timne when a three
- person astronaut crew returning ffrom mars inadvertantly carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna thast eventually infects the mission captain
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
, lite of cbs ' s short
- lived soap ofthe a few eyars back
, central park west
/ cpw
)
. tihs alien dna is not identicial to that which created the original film ' s sil
,
but it ' s close enough
,
and apon arrival on earth patrick isnt mating like crazy
, engaging in bloody sex whith just about every woman he cin find
. meanwhile
, scientist dr
. laura baker
( the returning marg helgenberger
) has created a clone of sil named eve
( natasha henstridge again
) for research purposes
. it doesn ' t tkae long fo eve tothe sense another alien presence
, which send her libido inot hyperdrive
. it ' s up tothe laura
and her former partner
, bounty hunter press lennox
( michael madsen
, another returnee
)
;
and patrick ' s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
) to fidn patrick before tghe iin
- heat eve does
.
" this isn ' t the x
- files
, goddammit
!
" exclaims one charachter in tje early going
. in terms of quality
, he ' s absolutely right
,
but he ' s alsot wrong
. the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick ' s pupils to dilate once he ' s infected
. looks
and sounds an awful lot like the x
- files ' s
" black cancer
" tothe me
.
bu that ' s not the only source director peter medak
adn writer chris brancato steal from
. species wass already a ripoff of alien
,
but medak makse thte cribbing much more blatant than the original ' s director
, roger donaldson
, did
. human patrick is given a tongue that allso has a tongue within itself
,
and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve ' s alien body
( which ironically ws designed by alien designer h
. r
. giger
)
. a larg aline hive that our heros douse with a substance fired fomr larg guns
? aliens sans flamethrowers
. the visual effects were by far the best thing about species
,
annd the sequel ' s effects crew at steve johnson ' s xfx inc
. keesh that high
- qualiy tradition alive
; no cheap
- looking lost in space cgi here
. after hte effects
, the orignal ' s best asset was the fresh presence ofthe henstridge
.
however
, medak
and brancato hvae no idea what exactly to do with her for thsi installment
. at one point she ' s called on tothe play alien
" empath
"
? la forest whitaker in the original
,
but forthe most of the duration she ' s holed up in a glass cell
. by the time tghe big breakout so prominently featured infact the trailer actually tkaes palce
, the film is well into its home stretch
. so the rest of thte tiome we are treated to patrick
, palyed with little zest by lazard
. one problem with the first film was that the deadly
, horny
,
but innocent
- at
- heart sil was too sympathetic
; noone such problem with patrick
, who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the aline tkaes control
. the rest ofthe the cast also fails to add much
,
but the writing can be faulted for that
. helgenberger
and madsen go through thge motions
,
bu they are already hampered by tjhe clich
? d develpment that somewhere between the two films
, thge once
- linked laura
and press stopped getting along
. williamson suffers tyhe worst indignity
. he tries his best to enliven the token african
- american role
,
but how can anyone recite insulting
, derivitive lines such as
" i ' m gonna get african on somone ' s ass
"
and nto appear ridiculous
?
but species ii ' s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of wrok
. at least the original featured plenty to laugh at
-
- unaccountably awful performances by tghe otherwise fine actors ben kingsley
and whitaker
,
and the sight ofthe helgenberger ' s carachter performing fellatio on madsen ' s
, for a strat
.
but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all
, let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level
. for all the blood
and gore
, nudity
,
adn sex thrown in
, speices ii is
, qutie simpley
, a vapid bore
.
