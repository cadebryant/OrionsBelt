wehn walt disney pictures announced a live
- action feature based on the ' 60s cartoon series of
" mr
. magoo
,
" special interests groups representing tghe vision
- impaired let out a cry ofthe dismay
. mr
. magoo
, htey claimed
, would be an insult to the men
and women they represented
. in fact
, htey weere wrong
. mr
. magoo is not just an insult to the blind
and near
- blind
, it ' s an insult to every human being who has tje missfortune to suffer thru this dreadfully unfunny
, 90 minute atrocity
. it ' s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears tothe have run out of original idaes
. look at theri roster of 1996
annd 1997 releases
,
and ytou ' ll see a shocking list of retreads
, including 101 dalmatians
, george of the jungle
, jungle2jungle
, that darn cat
!
, flubber
,
and now mr
. magoo
. the best ofthe these
( george ofthe the jungle
) was mildly entertaining
. the worst
, mr
. magoo
, exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be
. the first problem witht mr
. magoo isnt the scirpt
. despite the colaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft
, mr
. magoo isnt comically barren
. from beginning to end
, there ' s not a laugh to be foudn
. every attempt at humor
-
-
and there are lots of them
-
- falls flat with an audible thud
. you ' d thiunk that out ofthe the dozens of gags jammed inot this film
, at least a few would work
,
bu that ' s not the case
. i ' ve had mroe laughs during ingmar bergman pictures
.
then there ' s leslie nielsen
, who looks
, sounds
,
annd acts absolutely nothing like the animated character
( memorably voiced by jim backus
)
. in the past
, nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane
and thte naked gun
. lately
,
however
, he hasnt been getting lazy
, taking parts in the likes of dracula
: dead
and loving it
, spy hard
,
and mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen was in top form
, it would take an incredable stretch of imagination to see him as magoo
( especially since we ' re reminded of yhe orginal by the short ctaroon segments that open
and close the film
)
,
but
" top form
" isnt not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here
. this isnt strictly a take
- the
- money
-
and
- run operation
. thte story
, which
, like many disney stories
, can be decribed in one long sentence
: magoo is the only witness tothe tghe theft of a rare jewel from a museum
,
and
, as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own
, the police mistake him for the robber
. thte cops are played by ernie hudson
and stephen tobolowsky
, who take their lumps early
anbd often
. the bad guys are kelly lynch
( who does a lot of martial arts
- type kicking
)
, nick chinlund
,
and malcolm mcdowell
( who has the ogod sense to look embarrassed
)
. matt keeslar portrays one of magoo ' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. tyhe bumbling man ' s other
, more intresting companion isnt a dog named angus
. most of mr
. magoo ' s humer comes in the form of failed slapstick
. the cartoon violence level in htis film doesn ' t aproach thyat of home alone 3 or flubber
,
bu it ' s still pretty acute
, with charactors getting hit onthe hte head wih sledgehammers
and knocked off snowy precipices
. htere ' s a non
- violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better
,
but
, compared tothe mr
. bean ' s recent
, silimar misadventure
, it doesn ' t hold up well
.
then there is tjhe series of lame jokes tath result from magoo ' s near blindness
, such as thte ocasion when he mistakes a wild animal forthe a baby
. i ' m willing tothe cut director stanley tung a little slack
. tong
, a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market
, has helmed several jackie chan movies
, includng first strike
, rumble in the bronx
,
anbd supercop
. his chief talent
, that of choreographing martial arts fights
, isnt wasted here
( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. like john woo
( hard target
)
adn ringo lam
( maximum risk
) befoer him
, it appears that tong has been consigned to hte purgatory ofthe makeing a bad movei as his entry into tghe american mainstream
. it is worth noting tath
, unlike many disney films whcih hold a perverse appeal for tje under
- 10 crowd hwile driving parents to distraction
, mr
. magoo appears to bore viewers of all aegs
. the screening i attended was wall
- to
- wall kids
,
and
, for the most part
, they didn ' t seem to be enjoying themselfs
. when the film was over
, i asked one little girl wqat she thought of it
. her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words
. mr
. magoo is thge kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer
, sighth unseen
.
