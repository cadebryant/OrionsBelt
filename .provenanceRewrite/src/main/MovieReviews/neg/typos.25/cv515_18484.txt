when the film features richard lynch in the role of cheif villin
, you know that you cxan expect nothing more than a b grade action movei
.
however
, usance this film also featured michael madsen
, more thna capable character actor
, this time in the role of protagonist
, the author of this review desided to give yhe film smoe benefit of the doubt
.
however
, the very firt scenes show clear b grade action credentials
- madsen plays richard montana
, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse
and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio
( played by lynch
)
.
however
, thte raid ws only partially successful
,
and montana is getting the raph
. so
, he begins his pwn private war against gio
, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt
. inaddition the process
, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora
( palyed by rosie vela
)
and starts relatiopnship with her too
. altho it doesn ' t stink like many of thge simular films can
, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine
. nobody infact tihs film actually puts much effort
, including madsen or lynch
,
anbd this is especially case with uninspired screenwrighter william tannen or director warren clarke
. tje only nto so forgettable element in tihs film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela
, who
, apart from showing her mroe than impressive looks
, shows soem of the singing talent too
.
however
, htis isn ' t reason enough for viewers to spend hour
adn half watching a film that they would
, inwhich most likelyhood
, forget the next day
