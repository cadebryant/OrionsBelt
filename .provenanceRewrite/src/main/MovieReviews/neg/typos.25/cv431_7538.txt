" adorn the 1
/ 4 page ad for htis movie tabbed as
" the
# 1 comedy in america
" as ofthe may 8th
. did we attened the same movie
?
! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong
, like a snl skit on steroids
,
and at any lenght it seemed unfunny
. yes
, the sets
and costumes weere an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills
,
and yes
, the concept
, dealing with a 60s secet agent
/ pop icon
( played by myers
) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy
( dr
. evil
, also played by myers
) in the persent day
, hadnt a great deal of potential
. funn costumes
and scenery
and potential do not a movie amking so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor
. don ' t git me wrong
, i liek a good
" bubbles in the bathtub joke
" as much as the next person
,
but to hvae this type of humor be teh funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent
and my money
.
but
, the way things wrok these dyas in the movie business
, all a film hasnt to dont isnt call itself hte funniest
and peopel will believe it
. i do give this film stars because ofthe thge sets
, costumes
,
and sadly
, unmet potential
.
