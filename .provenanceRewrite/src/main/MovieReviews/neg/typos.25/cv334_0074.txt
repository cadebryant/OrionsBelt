i ' m not sure i shoud be writing a review of the witches of eastwick
, beccause i ' m not sure just what the hell
( pardon teh expression
) was goign on in it
.
however
, i can express the most important observation i made of it
, i
. e
. i didn ' t like it
. if i had to summarize this film
, i think i ' d conclude it was an updating of one of those ood newyorker england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch
and how they try to git out of the deal
. that ' s tyhe kernel of it
, anyway
. tossed into thsi are little bits
adn pieces that ocacsionally seem to be saying something baout men
annd women
, feminism
, the role of teh devil
, modern reformers
,
and friendship
. unforetunately
, little or no effort is ever made to follow up
and elucidate onthe these concepts
; they ' re simpley thrown out
and
then left tothe rot while the film goes on apace
. catually
, i htink that most of hte audiance was even omre confused tahn i was
. tehy cameback in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy
, on tjhe level of ghostbusters
,
and weere a bit confused to be getting a folk tale witht philosophical overtones
. they laughed
, or tried to laugh
, at moments thgat weere eather barely funny
, or much more horrible than funny
, as if that sould bend tje film awya fomr it ' s rether frightening direction
. three women
( cher
, susan sarandon
,
and michelle pfieffer
) live infront eastwick
, a small midwestern twon
. one night
, while drinking late inot the evening
, htey begin wishing fo the ideal man to drop into their lives
. in seeming answer to their idle daydreams
, a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion onthe the hill
and seduces each one by attempting to be everthing they want him to be
. he soon shows evidence ofthe mystical
-
- perhaps demonic
-
- pwoer
,
and his devotion tothe tyhe women ' s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones
. even worse
, wehn ignored his moods become ugly
,
and he mistreats the womens for spurning him
. anyway
, the problems
: all three female characters are fairly uninteresting
,
and several are cardboard stereotypes
, especially sarandon ' s character
. we never git inside them
, never feel sympathetic to them
, becouse their dialogue
adn personalities seem pretty bland
. as for nicholson
, well
, even the devil needs a direction to go in
,
annd hwile darryl van horne is the most intresting character in thte movie
( due tothe tjhe grace of the screenwriter
anbd
, more importantly
, nicholson ' s acting
)
, he still can ' t be yanked in one direction
annd
then another without making him a little vague
.
and
then htere ' s the special effects
. not in themselves
-
- they weren ' t that good
-
-
but their overuse
. i was almost positive
, untl i saw the credits
, that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind
( who has turned out the slop named superman ii
and iii
anbd supergirl
)
, becuase of tghe big name actors in dopy stunts
, or stephen spielberg
, affter the 18th vomit scene
annd the nicholson
- blown
- down
- the
- street stunt
. nope
, it ' s another bunch of guys
,
and directed by george miller
, who has shown great skill with stunts
/ special effects befoer
( thte road warrior
,
" nightmare at 20
, 00 feet
" episode of twilight zone
: the movie
)
bu aparently doesn ' t knwo when to turn off the wind machine
and let his peple act
. f ' gawds sake
, guys
, this is jack nicholson
! let him loose
! let him grin demonically
! skip thte splitting earth
and fake ilghtning
! watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out ofthe the car by the voodoo doll
, all i could thiunk of ws
,
" whta a waste
"
. if you ' re going to use slapstick liuke that
, use it up on pee weev herman
. nicholson does waht he can wih tghe role
,
and wehn he cant fidn his bearings
, can be extremely good
( the scene in hte church
, forthe instance
)
,
but most of the tyme
, he seems a bit stiff
, as if he ' s not sure what he should be doing next
.
and no wonder
. this scirpt goes all over the map
, giving you the feeling that it ' d jsut love to be allagory
,
but it ' s nto sure about what
-
- maybe if yuo give it time it ' ll thikn ofthe something
. so what is the witchs of eastwick
? a horror movei
? a folk tale
? a comedy
? a statement about women
? an examination of tyhe religious right or comparitive morality
? i tend to think of the omage that seems tothe dominate the movie for me
.
.
. watching someone regurgitate half
- digested bits of food
and cherry pits all over rooms
, peple
, the screen
,
and ultimately
, thte audience
. in other words
, a mess
.
(
$ 2
. 00
) if ytou like nicholson enough tothe watch him here
; maybe 25
% of his charm is able to make it through teh logjams ofthe others
.
