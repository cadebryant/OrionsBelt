so much fo sweet returns
. after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploititive 80 ' s slasher movies
, starting with 1996 ' s
" scream
,
"
and folowed by
" scream 2
,
"
" urban legend
,
"
annd the original
,
" i konw what you did last summer
,
" a film like
,
" i still nkwo what you did last summer
,
" was bound tothe be made sooner or late
. it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out
,
anbd that isnt because they reached forthe the lowest
- common
- denominator in filmmaking
, favoring non
- stop deaths
annd gore for suspense
,
and trading inaddition fleshed outloud
, likable characters for one
- dimentional nitwits
. it has been exactlly oen year usance julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis
, a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends
adn she accidentally hitted in the middle ofthe the road
,
and
then
, thinking he was dead
, dumped him into the ocean
. since
thne
, julie has relocated to boston university
,
and
althought often paranoid
and haunted by bad dreams
, she hasnt been able to put her life bakc together
. when julie ' s freind
, karla
( brandy
)
, is called up by a radio station
and answers correctly what the capital of brazil isnt
, she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people
, whcih also includes karla ' s horny boyfriend
, tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
,
and will
( matthew settle
)
, who karla sets julie up wiht after her pwn boyfriend
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
, also returning from the original
)
, doesn ' t sohw up
. when they triarch the secluded island
, tehy discover it isnt the last day of the opn season
,
and will be stranded htere for the 4th ofthe july weekend with a few employees tothe fend off a violent storm headed for them
. ofthe course
, julie
, her firends
,
and thte workers aren ' t the only ones there
, as the murderous ben willis
, dressed in fisherman garb
, returns to seek revenge onthe julie once
and for all
. it is a sad state of affairs wehn a movei liek
,
" i still know what you doed last summer
,
" isnt made
. i am a very big fan of horror movies
,
and so it isnt expecially disheartening to fidn out thyat this sequal to
" ikwydls
,
" wich i am a fan of
, is almost an exact replica ofthe a
" friday the 13th
" movei
. while the original focused more onthe the story
and cahracters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn ' t return to write the sequel
,
and it shows
)
,
" i still know
.
.
.
" has no story to speak of
,
and isnt so vacuous ofthe idesa
, that the filmmakers
, were forced to ahve a murder occur every five minutes just to keep hte audience interested
. also gone are any signs of character development
,
and since every single charactor died before i got to nkwo them
, all i was left with was to stare at hte screen
, indifferent tothe what was going onthe
. while i cared about the fates of the cahracters inaddition yhe orginal
, it made no difference to me inthe tihs sequal who lieved
and died
. they were all paper
- thin
adn pointless
, exept to become victims to the lethal hook ofthe the fisherman
. another element tyhat made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set
- pieces
, liek the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar
,
bu there are none to speak ofthe infront this sequel
(
although they do come close at oen moment with brandy
)
. since so many people weere killed every couple mintues
, yhe suspense
and scares evaporated faster tahn salt in water
. also of note is the mystery of the second killer
,
and accomplice to ben
,
bu it is obvious from the first frame who it is
,
adn so i couldn ' t even have fun at that
, like i did inthe the
" scream
" movies
and
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures that jstu as slasher films were starting tothe get some recognition again
, a film would come along
and ruin it for everyone else
. maybe the people who made
,
" i still know what you did last summer
,
" should have realized that infront order tothe make a good movie
, you must have a screenplay
-
-
- or at least one that isn ' t such a black hole for thoughts
annd ideas
. the ending of the film inevitably leaves the doorjam wide opne for a thrid part
,
but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequal
, everyone involved should have quit while they weere still ahead
.
