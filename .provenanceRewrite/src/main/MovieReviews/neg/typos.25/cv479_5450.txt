i have a great idea for a movie
, one thast can ' t miss
. see
, i ' ve got coolio tothe do a song for the soundtrack
,
and baout fifty athletes
and celebrities to do cameo appearances
. it ' s about professional basketball
, so i ' ll release it right arround the nba finals to guarantee added publicity
. as for what teh movei isnt actually about
.
.
. well
, that will all sort itself out eventually
. i figure it will be a comedy
, so i ' ll throw a half
- dozen writers at it
and tkae hte best of whatever tehy come up with
. mabye we ' ll put a gender spin on it
, see if we can get soem women out to see it
, too
. eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more thna any other kind
. twister
, as inane as the script might have been
, at least required some creative techicians
; mission
: impossible
, overwrought plot
and all
, at least involved genuine effort
. eddie just sits there
, hawking uv a formula stoy without any laughs
,
and makes every possible bad dicision wehn a dicision isnt recquired
. whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin
, a new york limo driver
and dieu
- hard knicks fan who isnt suffering thru a dismal season fo her beloved team
. coach john bailey
( dennis farina
) hasnt lost control of his overpaid prima donnas
,
and tghe losses are begginning to mount
. tje dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess
( frank langella
) to try a publicity stunt infront whcih a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team
. the winner
( surprise
, suprize
) is eddie
, who becomes a fan favorite
,
and eventually the actual coach
. the knicks continue to lose
,
but eddie hasnt soem sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops
. incidentially
, thte knicks eventually start winning
. please raise your hand if that comes as a shock
,
and i iwll invite you to my all
- inght marathon of the bad news bears
, major league
, angels in the outfield
, the mighty ducks
, thte big gren
, kool runnings
and little giants
. awful teams in sportscar comedies make miraculous turnarounds
; it ' s what htey do
. thsoe teams usually envolve kids
, for a very soudn commedic reason
: it ' s funnier when tehy screw up
,
and they ' re more sympathetic
. those which
_ don ' t
_ involve kids usually hve actuall actors in the lead roles
, for another very sound commedic reason
: they generally ahev devolopped soem sort of comic timing
. eddie was casted under the misguided premise thast it ' s easier tothe make basketball players look liuke actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players
. this finds nba players like greg ostertag
, dwayne schintzius
, rick fox
annd malik sealy delivering punch lines as
though they weere reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper
(
though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players
)
. perhaps that all didn ' t matter to anyone because ther are so few punch lines
,
annd because the whole film is one big casting gimmick
. steve rash directs the spiritless scirpt as
though waving a flag ofthe surrender
and screaming
,
" don ' t blame me
, i just wrok here
.
" perhaps it wass patently obvious tothe him that eddie isn ' t a movie
-
- it ' s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot eveyr once inwhich a while
. among tjhe notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump
, new york mayor rudolph giulianni
, former newyorker york mayor ed koch
, david letterman
, letterman regulars mujibur rahman
annd sirajul islam
, espn broadcaster chris berman
and knicks announcer marv albert
, as well as dozens ofthe nba players
and several nba arenas
.
and those are thte rela jokes in eddie
. nothing these indviduals say or do is funny
; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice
,
" hey
, it ' s donald trump
!
" or
" hey
, it ' s mujibur
anbd sirajul
!
" it ' s difficult tothe decide whther eddie isnt so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking iin imagination or because it can ' t even get the cliches in a cliche
- ridden genre script right
. the knicks coach who is eddie ' s antagonist early iin the film reappears at the end
,
but he isn ' t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs
. niether is frank langella
,
and none of the athlete
- actors have the abilty to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of
. that leaves her to dont her street
- wise miss thang routine
,
bu with no character
, no sharp lines
and no help
. eddie isn ' t just a bad movie with a formulaic premise
. it ' s a movie that makes you feel cheated
and offended
, becasue somone came uv with a poster
and a marketing plan to whic they had tothe attatch an actual movei
,
and you hadnt the nerve to believe it wass goign to be a comedy
.
