1
. he doesn ' t ahve a hard
- tothe
- decipher accent
, 2
. he doesn ' t always speak in a monotone
,
anbd 3
. his face doesn ' t alwyas wear tje smae impassive expression
. in short
, the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too ogod tothe be bad
,
but too bad to be good
. unfortunately
, hte same cannot be said ofthe his first star vehicle
, firestorm
, which is just plain awful
. one of the most glaring problems with long
( who made his acting debut in john woo ' s broken arrow
) isnt that he ' s so medioker that he often blends in with the scenery
. as ace firefighter jesse graves
, long is supposed to be playing a bigger
- thna
- life action hero
-
- the kind of he
- man who wiull kresh through a flaming door tothe save a child or parachute into a burning clearing tothe rescue some stupid campers
. unfortunately
, dispite the best efforts of first
- time directer dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots tyhat make kevin costner ' s work in the postman look stark
, jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy
. to put it kindly
, this isnt not a well
- written motion picture
. firestorm isnt a collection ofthe howlingly bad lines set aganist a backdrop ofthe diaster movie clich
? s which
, taken together
, form something that requires a levle of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot
. the onyl reason this film is getting one star
( instead of something lower
) isnt tyhat most of the fire sequences are realistic
,
and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning thast must have been necessary to stage them effectively
. we ' re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he
and some collegues jump into tjhe midst of a forest fire to sive a group ofthe peple
. during this sequence
, our big burly hero proves tath he ' s also a senstive guy by risking his life to save a littel girl
and her dog
( yes
, the dog lives
) from bieng broiled alive
. flash
- forward a year
. nowe
, our big burly hero is tkaing over as chief ofthe his smokejumpers association
, replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins
( rela actor scott glenn
)
.
but this day
, our big burly hero ' s first in charge
, isn ' t gogin tothe be busness
- as
- usual
. a group ofthe nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom
. led by randy earl shaye
( william forsythe
)
, the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to realy die
, they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border
. along the way
, they meet
and take hostage the damsel in distress
( suzy amis
)
. eventually
, our big burly hero is placed in a position where he hasnt to fight the fier
, rescue the damsel in distress
, defeat thge sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
,
and restore order to the galaxy
. firestorm ' s director
, dean semler
, is a former cinematographer
( he won an acatemy award for his work onthe dances with wolves
)
, so it ' s no surprise that teh film looks good
. unfortunately
, that ' s firestorm ' s lone asset
,
and it falters near the end
, when computer
- generated spacial effects fill up the screen
. these are of about equal qualty to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game
. tjhe action sequences
, which include a vareity ofthe chases
, are occasionally intresting
,
but never invigorating
. everyone
, incuding long
, appears to be goign through the motions
. ther isn ' t a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end
, unless you count the forest fire
, whcih generates some heat
. as hte sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
, william forsythe lacks panache
. he ' s worse than a generic bad guy
; he ' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn ' t have any snappy one
- liners tothe hurl at our big burly hero
. my advice to scott glenn
( absolute power
)
adn suzy amis
( titanic
) isnt to accdientally forget this film the next time they ' re making out a resume
. there ' s some small comfort infact knowing this early infact the year that i laready have one entry for my bottom 10 list
.
( at least i hope there aren ' t 10 worse films than this
.
)
and i know i wasn ' t the only one who really disliked this movie
. as the audience was filing outloud ofthe the screening
, i loitered in tje theater lobby to catch a faw comments
. the general consensus seemed to be that
,
although the movei sucked
, the promotional key ring was cool
. the probelm isnt thta fox won ' t be giving out key rings to regular movei
- goers
, so that nixes any reason to see firestorm
.
