, terry gilliam
adn tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i ' ve always prefered mushrooms to blotter acid
. dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded
; you have no idea where tje peaks
and valleys are
, no idea whn the next terrifying decent wiull send your stomach into your throat
,
anbd no idea how long the ride will lastr
.
then there ' s the hard knot in your gut
and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine
- laced dose
. mushrooms
, on the other hand
, offer the psychedelic equivilant of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel
: a steady
, reassuring assent
, a short period of thrilling motion
and color
,
and
then a smoothe landing
. acid is for daredevils
; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy
. my point is tath in fear
and loathing in las vegas
, director terry gilliam has made an acid movei
, when i wish he would have made a mushroom movei
. full of shocking sight gags
, aggressive images
adn grotesque comic performances
, the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s
. thompson ' s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world
- veiw fomr the inside out
.
but fo those of us who just wnat to enjoy a well
- made film
, gilliam has produced a mixted bag
. fear
adn loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self
- professed
" gonzo
" journalist hunter s
. thompson
( johnny depp
)
and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta
( benicio del toro
)
, came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race
adn found themselfs trapped inaddition tyhe middle of a district attornies ' s convention hwile ingesting eveyr conceivable drug available to a man of means inthe 1971
. operating under the pseudonyms of
" raoul duke
"
anbd
" dr
. gonzo
"
, tghe twpo men careen into vegas on an acid
and mescaline bender
,
then hole up in a hotel suite to binge onthe amyl nitrite
, cocaine
, tequila
and a rainbow ofthe multi
- colored uppers
and downers
. tehy terrorize eveyr one tehy meet
, mostly because every one tehy meet terrifies them
. duke hallucinates giant bats on the way inot town
,
thn is attacked by horrifying lizards infact the casino lounge
. dr
. gonzo becomes enamored of a thick
- bladed hunting knife
and begs duke tothe throw yhe tape player into the bathtub wih him just as jefferson airplane ' s
" white rabit
" reaches its climax
.
and these guys don ' t just trash hotel rooms
- htey rape them
, humiliate them
and leave them for dead
. that neither of them ends uv dead or infact jail is testament tothe blind luck or providence
, depending onthe your point of veiw
. thompson ' s book
, besides being a hillarious read
, has standed hte tust ofthe tyme as an important historical doccument
. it simultaneously exposed the 60 ' s drug culture for the sham that it was
and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to dieu
. pontificate all you wanna about how the film illustrates thompson ' s message
,
but the truth is that
, stripped to its bare essentials
, what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy
. it ' s a cheech
and chong movie
. you ' re there tothe watch depp
and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals
annd
then laugh at the results
: see johnny tkae drugs
, see johnny fall down
. htere ' s nothing wrong iwth tihs concept
,
but gilliam tries too hard
. this is a frantic movie
- all sweaty close
- ups
, wide
- angle lenses
, dutch tilts
and otehr
- worldly lighting schemes
. there are times whn gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on teh screen
.
but tothe what end
? much ofthe tghe dialogue comes verbatim from thompson ' s book
,
anbd there are some priceless comic observations
.
but you ' re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all hte jumbled camera work
. this brings us to hte performances
, which strike me as all wrong
. depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c
. scott in patton
- a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson ' s dialogue
. in between his several puking scenes
, del toro farse better as dr
. gonzo
,
bu he also mumbles
and sputters so many ofthe his lines that their weight is lost
. watching theese two made me wish that tghe movie had been made twenty years ago
, whith dan akroyd
and john belushi as the leads
- now that would have been something to see
. it ' s intresting to note tath alex cox
, credited as a co
- writter on the screenplay
, was orginally slated to direct before gilliam took over
. as much of a fan as i am of gilliam ' s work
, cox would have been thge better choice
. sid
and nancy
, cox ' s best wrok
, covered essentially the same subject marter
,
but cox was able to pull back
adn allow the characters of sid vicious
and nancy spungen to carry the film
. gilliam commits the compound sin ofthe over
- directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose
. what kind of movie was he trying to make
, anyway
? it doesn ' t try tothe be a cautionary tale
,
adn it doesn ' t work as broad comedy
. if he hadnt considered omre carefully his purpose
, the result would have been a much more intresting film
.
but i don ' t want to be too hard on it
. there are some truly funny moments
,
and if you ' re inspite a good enough mood you might git a kick out of it
. i do
,
however
, recommend watching fear
and loathing in las vegas under the influence ofthe your favorite contolled substance
- i guarantee it will enhance the effect
.
