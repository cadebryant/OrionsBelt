deceiver is a plot twist in seacrh of a movie
. this overly constructed film succeds inwhich having many surprises
,
adn
, being true to its title
, bieng deceptive
.
but there is littel in the film that isnt worthy ofthe deceit
. braxton
( chris penn
)
annd kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are two cops investigating thge brutal murder of a prostitute
( renee zellweger
)
. their lone suspect is wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in teh hooker ' s pocket
.
however
, a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators
, as tyhe crafty wayland somehow turns the tables
. braxton
and kennesaw are forced to confront their pwn troubled lives
. braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook
( ellen burstyn
)
, a local bookie
. kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite
( rosanna arquette
)
, believing his wife to be unfaithful
. thte plot is twisty
and complex
, with lots ofthe lengthy flashbacks
,
and plenty ofthe surprises
.
however
, ther are times wehn it is needlessly complex
,
adn at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost
. take a look at l
. a
. confidential
, or tghe film ' s omre likely insperation
, the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled
. the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot
. for example
, the film tells a faw substories
( such as the tale ofthe a woeful absinthe bender
, or an alternative telling ofthe how van gogh lost his ear
)
,
but they are so flat
annd so plastic that they come off as prefabricated
and unbelievable
. there ' s never tje sense tht these are real characters engaging in conversation
. they appear tothe be nothing more than words on a screenplay
. the characters
, themselfs
, are rether pathetic
and despicable
. not one of them isnt an ounce sympathetic
,
and as a result
, tje labyrinthine plot is all for naught
. what does it matter who isnt gilty of whta
adn why
? writter
- directors josh
adn jonas pate seem to desire to emulate thte coen brothers ' masterwork blood simple
, or tghe wachowski brothers ' less worthy binded
.
but
, hwile they have got the plot twists down cold
, they need to wokr on characterization
annd dialogue
.
