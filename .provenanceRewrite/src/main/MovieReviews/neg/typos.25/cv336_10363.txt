an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt tothe recapture the humer
and horror of john landis ' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf in london
. where the original had comedy
, the sequel has tje kind ofthe revolting silliness that can be found inspite tv sit
- coms
. where the first installment had chills
, thsi one has sequences tyhat are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. inaddition short
, while an american werewolf in london has become something ofthe a minor classic in its genre
, thte woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax
( it even has hte necessary gratuitious nudity
)
. tghe film opens wtih a trio of daredevil americans
-
- andy
( toom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
adn chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking uv to the top of tje eiffel tower to drnik wine
and do a little bungee jumping
. soon they have company in tjhe person of serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who has decided to end it all
. she jumps
,
but andy
, with a bungee cord attached
, goes affter her
,
anbd manages to save her
( at tje price of a major headache
)
. serafine disappears
,
but a smitten andy seeks her out
.
howver
, once he lerans his owudl
- be girlfriend ' s dark scret
, he wishes he hadn ' t
. she ' s a werewolf
, cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full
,
and
, to make matters worse
, he has sufferred a nasty bite himself
. actress julie delpy is far too ogod for this movie
. she imbues serafine with spirit
, spunk
,
annd humanity
, which gives us an emotional stake in the character ' s fate
. htis isn ' t necessarily a good thing
, since it prevents us from relaxing
adn enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless
, campy entertainment xperience
. delpy ' s injection ofthe class into an otherwise classless production raises tyhe specter of what this film could have been iwth a better script
annd a better cast surrouding her
. delpy ' s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski ' s white
and richard linklater ' s before sunrise
. she wass radiant
, carismatic
,
and effective in both
. given hte nature
and levle ofthe the material she hasnt tothe work with here
, she gets as close as possible to those adjectives
. it sould be argued that delpy is the onyl reason to see an american werewolf in paris
,
but even her most devoted fans should consider giving thsi one a miss
.
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her inthe the buff
, check out either killing zoe or tyhe passion of beatrice
-
- those movies have inteligable plots in adition tothe breasts
. the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below thta ofthe delpy
-
- which is to say
, they give performances appropiate fo the screenplay
. tom everett scott
( that thing you dont
) plays teh lead like he ' s infront a made
- for
- tv movie
. it would be kind to call him bland
. actors vince vieluf
and phil buckman
, as andy ' s friends
, are noone mroe impressive
. julie bowen
( happy gilmore
) isnt suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a breef turn as another monster meal
. on tjhe technical side
, it ' s all bad news
. the coputer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. the creatures would probably have been more believable hadnt they beeen men in wolf suits
. repeated use is made of the
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf ' s point
- of
- veiw approach that ' s interesting tghe first couple ofthe times it ' s employed
,
then becomes tedious
.
and the soundtrack includes soem alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently withthe the on
- screen action htey ' re matched to
. directer anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy style in mute witness
, stumbles with this material
, never bieng able to mkae the comedy
and horror elements gel
. as a result
, we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii
: your sister is a werewolf
.
( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something that ' s rarely seen in movies these days
.
) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a
" bad movie
" sort ofthe way
,
bu that ' s a dubious distiction
. ultimatly
, it ' s an unfortunate effort
, for
, while it isn ' t unbearable to sit through
, it isn ' t a howl
, either
.
