if i were one of thsoe arrogant criticists who thinks his review hasnt some great impact on the success or failure ofthe certian films
, i might say that i review movies that don ' t look particularly good because i ' m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it
. if thyat were true
, i could put a banner at thge top of my site that reads
:
" shay casey
: seing bad movies so you don ' t have to
.
"
but i konw that ' s bunk
- you ' re goign to see whatever movies you want to noone matter wqat i say
. so i ahve tothe tell tje truth
: eveyr once in a while i get a nasty
, masochistic urge to see a bad movie
. ytou know the feeling
, when you ' re sick of seeing all these damn acadamy award contenders
adn you want to see something you cxan have a ball trashing mercilessly
. sometimes i think that ' s why anyone goes tothe see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admit it
: sometimes you like seeing bad movies
. so do i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn ' t quite as bad as i throught it might be
. maybe i just felt sory forthe the actors
, or maybe i thought it could have beeen decent if the studio hadn ' t started tinkering with tjhe director ' s
( walter hill
) final cut
, causing him to want his nmae removed
. maeby i ' m becomeing a softy
. in any case
, i didn ' t fidn
" supernova
" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe
.
bu it ' s still bad
. the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel
" nightingale
.
" the crew includes captain a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his new second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical technicians yerzy penalosa
( lou diamond phillips
)
and danika lund
( robin tunney
)
,
and computer technician benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. there are smoe attemts at
" characterization
,
"
bu all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction
, whihc puts kaela on edge
, yerzy
and danika have a relationship that requires them tothe make kissy
- faces at each other every five mintues
,
and benj
( apparently gay
) isnt in love with tje coputer
( apparently female
)
. don ' t expect any moreso explanation
, because you won ' t git it
. anyway
, the crew gets a distress call ffrom a location deepo in space tothe which a failed mining opperation had been sent
. durig the dimension jump
( i think that ' s what it ' s called
,
but don ' t hold me tothe it
)
, tyhe captian is killed
and the man who sent tje distress signal
( peter facinelli
) is brought onthe board
. he calls himself troy larson
, making him teh supposed son of a man kaela once had a relatiopnship witht
.
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts hapening
. hvae yuo seen
" alien
?
" hvea you seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movie in its own right
)
? good
.
then you ' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- production cuts or not
, htere is nothing orginal about thsi screenplay
,
and nothing unpredictable either
. after all
, no one ' s going tothe think for a second thyat troy won ' t turn outloud to be a villain
.
but the bigger problem wtih
" supernova
" is that it can ' t just stick to the simple plot it ' s afforded
. numerous re
- writes
( the scirpt may be credited tothe threee peple
,
but it ' s a gross underestimate
) have crammed this lean 90
- minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all reamin underdeveloped
. ws ther something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot
? did thte ship ' s computer leran something baout humanity
? what ws that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board wih him
?
and just wqat does the film ' s title signify
, if anything
? as far as i can tell
, it referrs to a veyr small plot detail that isn ' t developped
, just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements
. character relationships infront this film also make very littel sense
. for some reason
, every person inaddition thsi film keeps having sex
. we git an unusually easly sex scene between phillips
and tunney within tje first 10 minutes
. bassett
and spader ' s characters strat off hating earch other
. fifteen minutes
and one bottle of pear brandy later
, tehy ' re engaging in some hanky
- panky
. when troy the creepy stranger shows uv on the ship
, ofthe course both female crew members will fall in love with him
. every single shift in character interaction happens extremly suddenly
, wich is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut
. the most prominent example
,
however
, may be the fatc that when teh film starts
, ther are no opening credits
! futhermore
, the end of the film looks like tehy took whta were originally intended to be the oppening credits
and spliced them in right before the real end credits
. maybe that ' s why the film ' s title isnt maintioned twice druing the end credits
, right between james spader
adn robert forster
. right affter you get over the shock of not being told what movie you ' re seeing
( lest you decide tothe walk outloud upon making that discovery
)
, you might notice thyat the movei seems tothe have dropped you right in the middle ofthe a scene
, withthe little
- tothe
- no introduction to any of the characters or situations
. tjhe rest of tjhe movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes
( you know
, where they expalin things
)
and jsut whent from point a to point b
. point a
: danika isnt thouroughly enamored of yerzy
annd is ready to have his baby
. point b
: tunney is now shagging troy
and yerzy is unusually obsessed with tjhe lava lamp thing
. doesn ' t make sense
. since i didn ' t understand anything about these characters ' motivations
, did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one
- by
- oen
(
and he does
, knocking off threee of them inaddition about 10 mintues
)
? not a whit
. it ' s a shame
, because this cast countains a lot ofthe talented actors looking for something to do
. htey don ' t find it
. bassett
and spader say every line in the same monotone voice wih the smae blank expressions on their faces
. sexual tension
? more liek constipation
. maybe they ' re jsut embarrassed at haveing tothe utter such howlers as
" tihs thnig was made by someone more powerfull than god
and a whole lot less nice
.
" not that we ever find out who that is
, mind you
. the climax ofthe their relationship
( tkaing place in a transport pod
) is probably thte film ' s biggest forehead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits tje most obvious villain in history tht no oney ever suspected
. he ' s awfully oney
- note
,
bu it ' s not as if he ' s given any more notes to work whith
. hte rest of the cast doesnt even less
. tunney stands around looking cute
,
thne scared
. phillips broods
. cruz flirts with the computer
.
hten they all dieu
and a star blows up or something
,
bu i really wasn ' t paying much attention by
hten
.
" supernova
" is pretty awful
,
bu i ' m cutting it a littel slack mearly because i expeced less than what i got
. tath ' s it
. if you expect it to be good
( fo whatever reasons yuo may have
)
, you ' ll probably hate it more tahn i will
. even the spacial effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing you haven ' t seen before
,
annd suffice to say the script isn ' t going to save tyhe film
. honestly
,
though
, what dont you expect from a film with about a dozen writers
and a directer who had his name removed
and replaced with a psydonym
? it usually results in a bad movei
,
and that ' s whta
" supernova
" is
.
