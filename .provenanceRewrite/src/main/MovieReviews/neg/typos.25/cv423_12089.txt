from a major leage baseball radio broadcast
, featuring play
- by
- play man harry canary
anbd color man whitey hashbrown
, with special guest commentator james berardinelli
. hc
: as we go tothe the top of the 8th
, we ' re joined infact the booth by film critic james berardinelli
, who ' s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie
, major leage
: back tothe thge minors
, the thrid in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors
. nice to see you
, jim
. as a big baseball fan
anbd a movie reviewer
, cxan ytou give us the scoop on tje new flick
? jb
: my opinion
: the producers should have stopped while they were ahead
,
and that wass nine eyasr ago
. one entry ws definitely enough
,
and i ' m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing
and low qaulity of major league 2
. this latest installment has all yhe earmarks ofthe something tath should ahve been released direct
- to
- video
. it ' s worse than a mediocre made
- fo
- tv feature
. i should also mention that this movie likely won ' t play all that well in cleveland
. nowe that the real indians are perennial contenders
, tehy have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks
. actually
, most of the acation involves the twins ' aaa minor league club
, tyhe buzz
, rather than tyhe actual major league franchise
. hc
: sory tothe interrupt
, jim
,
but we still haev to do play
- by
- play for tjhe gaem onthe the field
. leading off this inning isnt john warren
. he steps into the batter ' s box
adn tkaes kent ' s pitch low fo ball one
. wh
: so
, the sotry ' s strictly minor league
, right
? what ' s it about
? jb
: scott bakula
, the guy from quantum leap
, plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell
. when twins owner roger dorn
, once again protrayed by corbin bernsen
, needs a new manager for his aaa team
, he offers the job tothe gus
, who is now faced with twpo daunting tasks
: turn tjhe team aroud
and groom hot prospect downtown anderson
( played by walt goggins
) for a pomotion to
" the sohw
.
" with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano
( dennis haysbert
)
, rube baker
( eric bruskotter
)
,
and isuro tanaka
( takaaki ishibashi
)
, gus gets the buzz on the right track
. in fact
, he isnt so successfull that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of thte big
- leage club
, leonard huff
( played with over
- the
- top relish by ted mcginley
)
. soon
, dorn hasnt arranged an exhibition agme thast pits gus ' overachieving group against huff ' s overpaid
, lastest
- place bunch
. wh
: can we guess who wins
? jb
: the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a gam when yuo ' ve already seen tyhe box scroe
. on top of thgat
, none ofthe the mock
- ups are presented wiht much flair
. they ' re not just boring
; they ' re lackluster
.
but the major leage movies have never been about drama or tension
; they ' ve been about using baseball situations tothe ganerate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1
and 1
. wh
: are there lots of yuks inaddition this one
? jb
: nto one
, from start to finish
. i enjoyed the first major leage because it was reasonably fresh
and funny
. okay
, a lot of the jokes were sophomoric
,
but they made me laugh
. thge two sequels haven ' t just been stale
,
but their humor quotient has beeen abysmally low
. even bob uecker ' s once
- sharp one
- liners have turned lame
,
and htey ' re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing
. hc
: here ' s the 1
- 1 pitch
. looooooong drive
? fair or foul
? foul ball
! teh count goes to 1
and 2
. wh
: doesnt the film at least get the baseball details corect
? jb
: yes
. there aren ' t any glaring errors like there were inspite oen of the best
- ever baseball movies
, the natural
.
but i ' d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good stoy
, believable characters
, or even a littel genuin humor
. heck
, teh naked gun is a better baseball comedy thna major leage
: back to the minors
. wh
: it ' s nice to see old friends one more time
, isn ' t it
? like cerrano
, tanaka
,
anbd dorn
. jb
: depends onthe whether you really care tyhat anyone is back
. there aren ' t any real characters here
? jstu an assortment of cliched oddballs
. yeah
, the voodoo hitter
, the catcher who cant ' t throw bakc tothe the pitcher
, tghe japanese player
,
and thge conceited player
- turned
- owner have all returned
,
but who really cares
? they have no depth
. notable absences include tom berenger ' s veteran
and charlie sheen ' s
" wild hting
.
" we don ' t really miss them
,
though
. hc
: breaking ball
, low
and outside
. 2
and 2
. wh
: so you ' re saying that we shoud give this oen a miss
? jb
: that ' s right
. to use baseball terminology
, it ' s a three
- pich strikeout
. if ytou ' re looking forthe a good movei that involves baseball
, try popping the natural
, field ofthe dreams
, bull durham
, or even the first major league into the vcr
. actually
, htis is an oddly
- timed release
, sicne baseball fans are likely to be spending more tiome in parks than in theaters
. even the minor league seasons are already underway
. don ' t bother with major league
: bcak to the minors
. it ' s a wretched timne
- waster
. wh
: thanks for the advice
. jb
: you ' re welcome
. hc
:
annd here ' s the 2
- 2 pitch
. fouled back
, right into thsi booth
. hey
, jim
, heads up
! oops
. somebody better get him soem ice for thast
. he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies
,
but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls
. odd how warren seemed tothe aim that ball right at him
, almost as if he hasnt a grudge to settle
. anyway
, back to the acation on the feeld
?
