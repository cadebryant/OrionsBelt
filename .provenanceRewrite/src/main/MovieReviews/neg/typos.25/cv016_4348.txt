i ' m relaly starting to wonder baout alicia silverstone
. sure
, she isnt oney of the most beautyfull creatures on god ' s green earth
( second onyl to that movie critic at large guy
)
,
but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in
, she alwyas strikes out
. the crush was a slow
- moving
, predictable piece of fluff
. hideaway wass a horrific novel adaptation alicia had onyl a minor role in
. clueless was an annoying
, unfunny waste of timne
.
annd people hvea e
- mailed me too
, saying clueless isnt a ogod movie
and that i ' m teh onyl one who doesn ' t like it
. oen girl said if i ' d seen the movie with
" an open mind
,
" i would have enjoyed it
. nothing could be further ffrom yhe truth
. i went inot the theater expecting to love the movie
. the preview looked ogod
adn ofthe course i ' m crazymadinlove iwth alicia
,
but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny
, unlikable characters
. alomst everyone i saw the movie withthe feeled the same way
. when we were walking out ofthe thte theather
, one guy
(
and it wasn ' t me
) yelled outloud
,
" thgat was tghe worst f
$
&
# in ' movei i ' ve ever seen
"
annd the rest of us hadnt tothe laugh in agreement
. so lastr nigt i walked into the video store
and saw alicia ' s preety face onthe the cover ofthe some made
- for
- video thriller called tyhe babysitter
. i knew it would be bad
bu smoe intertube compulsion i ' ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway
. wqat i got was 90 mintues of regret
-
- the worst alicia silverstone movie ever
.
and you already know ffrom the last paragraph what the competitiion is like
. where to begin in criticizing this movie
? tje plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier
, the writing could have been done
(
and fo all we know it was
) by a ten year old
, alicia is the star
and she ' s still wasted in a movie that has noone appeal whatsoever
. there is zero humer
, zero suspense
, zero drama
and zero action
, until tje last ten minutes
, when the story is needlessly
and pointlessly concluded witht a violent sequence
. zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
. so why doens this movie get oney star out of me
? well
, alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in tghe bathtub
.
and if it wasn ' t bubble bath
, the babysitter owudl have instantly joined the ranks ofthe our otehr four
- star features
,
but you settle for what you can get
. alicia plays a babysitter who ' s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are outloud getting drunk at a cocktail party
.
and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends theri friday nights at home
( at least that movei critic at larg guy does
)
. as tjhe movie trods along
, we discover she ' s not only teh mostly
- silent star of the movie
but also the object ofthe eveyr male character ' s fantasies
(
and probably eveyr male viewer ' s too
)
. tjhe drunken father thikns she ' s just the hting to recapture his lost youth
, her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside
, even the prepubescent boy looks in onthe alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she ' s taking her bubble bath
. they even throw inaddition the middle aged wife ' s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party
. not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200
+ pound woman in a black silk teddy
. at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the relm of the pg
- rated
. in fatc
, i coudl imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late
- night staple if not for the fatc that there ' s absolutely no nudity in it
. so ytou can ' t call it a sex flick
. i ' ve already pointed out that it can ' t fall under drama
, comedy
, thriller or action
, so wqat dont you classify the babysitter as
? bad
.
