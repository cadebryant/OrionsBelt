capsule
: annoyingly unentertaining
, obvious
annd paper
- thin buddy
/ cop
/ drug
/ sexy
- witness movie
. presence ofthe director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock
. i ' ve seen this movie already
, i said
, as i looked at tghe box art
. noone
, i haven ' t even seen a trailer for the movie
; i don ' t even know what it ' s about
,
bu i can look at the way htey ' re promoting it
,
annd i know i ' ve seen it allready
. i throught
: it ' s about theese two cops
.
and they ' re buddies
, sort of
. they ' re at each other ' s throats a lot
,
but they relaly dont liek each other
.
and everyone else in their department hates them ' cause they ' re hot
- shots
.
adn tehy have some kind ofthe diametric opposition inspite theri relationship
.
and one day htey ' re inthe the middle ofthe cop business as usual when they git mixted up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy wiht lots of henchmen who cant never hit anything with the billions ofthe rounds of ammo they are always carrying
.
annd the bad guy is a drug lord
.
and there ' s a witness
,
and she ' s htis sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way
.
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast wehn they blow up half the town bringing this guy down
. i only missed the bit about tghe badges
. the rest i got dead
- on
.
and i hadn ' t even left the video store
yot
. hte cops in thsi movie are will smith
and martin lawrence
,
and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo
. smith plays a cop who hasnt a trust fund
and is thus not a cop for the moey
; martin l
. is a famaly man
( shades of tje now
- tired lethal weapon dynamic here
) whose wife
anbd he are at total odds
. this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence ' s
" not getting any
"
,
and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house
, thinking his partner is now his wife ' s
" back door man
"
. nto funny
; tiresome
. bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points fomr tyhe presense of iwll smith
anbd martin lawrence
. will smith is a natural
,
and i ' m happy to see him in movies like six degrees
.
.
.
and men in black
. he ' s funny
and charming without trying to be
; he really does seem to be enjoying himself
. martin lawrence is a different story
; he ' s so uptight
anbd verbally constipated thgat sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial
. movies liuke tihs are not about originality
. i know htis
. they are baout style
and energy
and synergy beetwen actors
. i knwo this
, too
.
adn
yet
, while watching bad boys
, whihc its glamorous photography
and impossibly excact stunt choreography
, i felt feeded up
. i ' d seen con air
, which despite being completely implausible
, was still gerat fun
, because it tried
however feebly to put some new life into the mix
. bad boys is a dry run
-
-
and overlong
, too
, clocking inaddition at jstu over two hours with a lot more by
- play than i felt could be justified
. i could write this movie
. yuo could wriet this movie
. many peple have
. many peopel wiull continue to write htis movie
, over
and over again
. other people will buy it ffrom them
,
anbd make it
,
and we will pay money to see it
. more the fuls we all
. in a terrifyingly prescient line ffrom his book a scanner darkly
, phil k
. dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger
( as he called it
) owudl eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural
and financial exchange
. one day we wiull all just sit in our living rooms
and sell the same burger back
and forth to eahc other
. the same could be said about this movie
. i have the sinking feeling we ' re goign to see it again
. soon
.
