please don ' t mind this windbag letting off a bited of steam
.
.
. i just whant tothe warn all of y ' all nto to waste your hard
- earned
$
$
$ on anaconda
. it ' s not even worth a 99
- cent video rental
. don ' t listen tothe ebert on this one
( he has no clue what he ' s talking about
!
) btw i accompanied my friend to this noe becouse she was
* required
* to watch it on assignment
( she reviews movies for a local paper
)
. now i ' ll actualy bcak up my huffing
and puffing
. here goes
: movei
: anaconda rydain ' s bottom line
: wait for it to come on usa up all night
. even
then
, i doubt it ' s worth the price of jolt
( tothe halp yuo stay up that lite
!
) why do i hite anaconda
? let me count the ways
.
.
. first of all
, thsi movie gets way too many snake facts wrong
. as an ophiophile
( snake lover
)
, i can tell you taht a
) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet
, b
) tehy ' re scared ofthe people
, c
) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare beacuse human shoulders are too wide to ift in a snake ' s mouth
,
and constrictor snakes don ' t kill what they can ' t eat
, d
) people cant outrun snakes wiht no trouble
, especialy heavy ones like anacondas
, e
) if an anaconda did eat a human
, it would need at least 6 months of sitting onthe its butt to digest the huge meal
, therefore it couldn ' t run arund gobbling uv everybody else in the cast
,
and f
) snakes have noone vocal cords
, so they can ' t make funny squealing noises
. wiew
. i wass prepared to suspend reality if the movei woudl have been worth it
. unfortunately
, anaconda was about as suspenseful
anbd exciting as watching paint peel
. my friend
and i even successfully predicted who would live at hte end
. anybody can tell the bad guy isnt going to die eventually
. that was a pity because his character was one ofthe tje few reasons my firend
and i didn ' t give up
adn fall asleep
. he was hte most likable character in thge movie
. who wouldn ' t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman
? anaconda did hvae its cute moments
: arguments between ice cube ' s character
and the british guy
, for instatance
.
however
, those small flashes ofthe witn were not worth the other hour
and twenty
- eight mintues ofthe boring schlock
. the writers had
-
and blew
- a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines
. i wass qutie disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady thast the jungle makse him horny
. did she retort with a clever
, ego
- withering comeback
? of course not
!
" i ' m trying to work
!
" gee
, that ' s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with
. she could have told him tothe go find a knothole or something
.
.
.
; p
but i will admit
, ther was just noe scene where i ws suprized at the outcome
( hint
: it involves thte evil guy
and miss crap comebacks
)
. as for the plot
, i ' m still trying to find one
. this movie was basicly an excuse to get a boatload of peopel into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by rediculous
, computer
- generated anacondas with the eyes
annd fangs of vipers
and the faster
- tahn
- gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet
.
( harrier snake
?
) not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims
. tyhe writers tryed to throw in some sort of plot twist
( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense
?
) in whitch the sick guy ' s g
- friend kisses the evil dude
anbd suddenly everybody hates said evil dued
anbd starts trying to kill him
. that was about as claer
anbd understandable as mission
: impossible
.
( if someone could explane that movie to me
, i ' d be most grateful
! all the old
- guy double agents looked thte same
!
!
) i wasn ' t inspired by the acting
, save for hte evil dude
. i cin ' t blaim the actors
,
though
. it ' s nto their fault they had a cruddy script to wrok with
. this concludes rydain ' s diatribe on a shameless exploitation
(
and perpetuation
!
) ofthe public fear ofthe snakes
. comments
, flames
, anyone
?
- rydain the atomic cheese
, fresh from chernobyl dairies
