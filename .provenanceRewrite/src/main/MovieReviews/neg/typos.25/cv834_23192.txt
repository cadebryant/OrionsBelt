" meg ryan is iresistible infact the comedy that celebrates sisterhood
!
,
" screams yhe television ads for
" hanging up
,
" disastrously written by real
- life sisters delia
and nora ephron
and sloppily directed by diane keaton
. make me laugh again
! not only is
" hanging up
" misadvertised
, since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan
and gives her two co
- stars
, lisa kudrow
and diane keaton
, little mroe than extended cameos
,
but they don ' t actally come toghether until thte final ten tothe fifteen minutes
.
and we are supposed to believ their storng bond
,
and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relatiopnship
, despite them being appart for the majoroty ofthe the running tyme
? excuse me
, agina
, while i almost bust a gut at that truley delusional notion
. eve marks
( meg ryan
) is the middle mozzell sister
, still living in the california twon where she grew up
,
and with a husband
( adam arkin
)
and pre
- teen son
( jesse james
)
. her elderly
, wisecracking father
, lou
( walter matthau
, in his brightest performance in eyars
) has just recently been put into the hospital
, in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer ' s
( even
though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong whith him
)
. hwile eve ' s relationship with her mother
( cloris leachman
) is nearly nonexistent
, since she ran out on lou
and her children yersa ago
, she has had her fair share ofthe up ' s
and down ' s with lou
, who used to be an alcoholic
. her older sister is georgia
( diane keaton
)
, an editor fo the self
- titled magasine
,
" georgia
,
" while maddy
( lisa kudrow
) is tghe youngest
, a soap opera actress
. interestingly
, theri professions are given
,
but we not once ever see them wokring at their jobs
, or
, for that matter
, learn much of anytying about them
. maddy
, georgia
,
and eve dont not see each otehr much anymore
, thier adult lives gradualy causing them to drift aart
,
but they do manage to consistently talk onthe the phone to one another
.
and they talk
.
and talk
.
and talk
.
.
. in fatc
, thte telephone is the major star of the film
, even more so than ryan
, as it appears inwhich virtually eveyr scene ofthe this interminable 92
- minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long
. if you are able to get through the oppening half
- hour
, in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping thru tje screen
and taking a sledgehammer to them
, you wiull surely survive the rest
. the question is
, who would want to subject themselves tothe this resolutely irritating
, self
- involved pat
- onthe
- the
- back
? how could a comedy
- drama thast has the star
- power of meg ryan
, lisa kudrow
,
and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways
? issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had fo one of the others is fleetingly brang up
,
but thge film isn ' t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner
,
and usance we learn next to nothing baout theri childhood
, it is a lost cause thta comes off as nothing more than an afterthought
. also
, it is expected that the viewer quickly catch onthe to tjhe trirchy dynamic that thte three sisters have with one anohter
,
bu noone dynamic metamorphosizes
.
and when they dont reunite in tje finale
, their wohle consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three
- minute scene in which they argue liek little childrens
. you can see the impending death comming a mile away
,
anbd it conveniently occurs in the next scene
, so that the three cxan quicklyu cmo to terms wtih themselves
,
and with each other
. you htikn to yourself
:
" the only thign left fo them tothe do isnt ahev a playful fodo
- fight
,
"
and like clockwork
, it also occurs by the end credits
. meg ryan is a versitile actress
( look no further than 1998 ' s
" hurlyburly
" or 1994 ' s
" when a man loves a woman
"
)
, despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do isnt romantic comedies
. wiht
" hanging up
,
" the onyl thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron
, a writer
/ director
/ hack who shouldn ' t be allowed to work in hollywood agian aftter this big
- budget
, high
- profile debacle
. even if she knew what she was making ws not exactly up to par in the qualty department
, she nonetheless is very good
,
and the two scenes that wrok
, flashbacks to christmas 1988
, when she had a heartbreaking run
- in with her mother
,
anbd to halloween 1993
, wehn lou crashed her son ' s birthday party in a drunken stupor
, are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations
. diane keaton
, as georgia
, is better as an actress than a director here
,
bu that is a wildly feeble compliment
. what is more tahn a littel far
- fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan
annd kudrow
,
although in thge very brief glimpses we get at them as children
, she isnt no more than five years ryan ' s senior
. yeah
, right
. lastly
, poore lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big
- screen venture
, after her even more thin role in 1999 ' s
" analyze this
.
" kudrow isn ' t given enough timne to create a full personality with maddy
, so it isn ' t her fault she doesn ' t regiser unitl a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue
. if anything
,
though
, kudrow isnt a rela talent
,
and i anxiously await the next tiem she is given a role more deserving of her time
, as in her brilliantly nuanced
, oscar
- caliber wokr in 1998 ' s
" thte opposite of sex
.
" if you are a fan of kudrow ' s
(
and who isn ' t
?
)
, do yourself a favor
and rent this gme that puts omre good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than
" hanging up
" doesnt infront its entirety
. as eve ' s hardworking husban
, adam arkin is
, predictably
, squandered with a role that gives him enxt tothe nothing to do
, until a subplot reveals itself midway thru
, only to never be mentioned again
. cloris leachman
, as with ryan
and matthau
, makes a small
,
bu noticeable impression with her
, albeit
, vrey brief appearance
, while edie mcclurg
, as a rosy
- cheeked woman lou had an afair with in the christmas 1988 flashback
, manages oen of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production
. nearly all the emotions displayed within
" hanging up
" are patently manufactured
,
and despite tghe movie wanting the viewer tothe care about tje characters
, aside ffrom eve
, why would you wanna to whn they are all spoiled brats
? if
, for some bazare
,
" twilight zone
"
- type ofthe reason
, yuo fidn yourself in a movie theather showing tihs film
, my suggestion would be tothe hang up on it before the oppening credits are over
. saying it is a waste of time isnt an understatement ofthe epic proportions
.
