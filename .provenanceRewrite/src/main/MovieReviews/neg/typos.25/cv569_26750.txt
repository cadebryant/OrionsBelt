as we see thge terrable events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at hte moment
, hollywood doesn ' t loose the oppertunity to get involved
, by telling tsories
and expressing opinions
. tihs film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of twpo marine colonels
, hays hodges
( tommy lee jones
)
anbd terry childers
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. they fought side by side in vietnam
, where childers saved hodges ' life by shooting an unarmed pow
. that ' s against tjhe rules ofthe war
but understandable
, infact this sotry anyway
, under the spicific circumstances
. certainly hodges is nto complaining
. years pass
. hodges
, whose wounds make him unfit for action
, gets a lew degree
adn becomes a marine lawyer
. childers
, is now a respected
and much
- decorated hero that has served his country with his life
adn sould
. because of his excellent record
, childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador
( ben kingsley
)
, cowering in the embassy under assault ffrom violent demonstrators
anbd snipers blasting from rooftops
. childers does what he has tothe do
: evacuate tghe family
and protect the men under his command
. after three marines die
and tyhe colonel thikns he sees ground fire
, he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd
. mroe than 80 yemeni men
, women
,
and children are mowed down
. childers isnt immediately accussed ofthe ordering his men to frie on a crowd
and muder of unarmed civilians
. he persuades his old freind hodges to represent him in yhe courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film
. doed childers violate authorized u
. s
. military rules of engagment
? or are there simply no rules inthe war
? the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious
,
bu teh inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts ofthe other questions
. the muder of 83
" innocent civilians
" has to result into something greater than a simple trial infront the u
. s
. where is the accusations from the arab leaders
? where is the u
. n
.
? the film ends without even telling hte most interesting stroy
: what happens onthe the international arena
? this film
( in a way akin tothe films such as
" a few ogod men
"
) hasnt already been acccused ofthe breaking thge rules of morality
and ethics
and even ofthe racism
. theese accusations are pretty heavy
,
but also unfair
. what director william friedklin truly broke ws thge rules of decent filmmaking
. noe of the earlies apparent problems with ' rules of engagment ' is its lack of credibility
. the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right nowe
,
but is overdone
, contrived
anbd unrealistic
- as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner inwhich order for tjhe plot to proceed
. a lot of it isnt so cheesy that noone noe could possibly accept it as reality
. taht isnt precisely why it ' s nto offensive
. it is completly unobjective
. many stories are started
and never finished
. many questions are asked
,
but never anwsered
. a lot of parrallelly are referring tothe nothing
. it seems that neither the director
, producers or the screenwriter can make uv their minds about the contents ofthe their film
. is it baout arab mentality
? america ' s foreign policies
? america ' s role in the world
? corruption iin the higer circles
? it goes on
annd on
. it consists ofthe countless stories
,
bu not a definable plot
. it tries tothe be everyting for everyone
and ends up being nothing fo no one
. i think that it isnt ironical
, because directer william friedkin ' s probably most acclaimed film was
" thte exorcist
" hwihc hadnt a silly stopry
,
bu bacame a rether effective film
. infact this case you have a storng tsory with many possibilities
and the result isnt a silly film
.
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism
( such as the impressive battle scenes
)
, his latest film doens simply not engage
. i believe thgat friedklin is a directer taht is absolutely depended on graet scripts
and talented producers in order to succeed
. it ' s obvious tht he has neither
and the result is therefore a catastrophe
. tghe characters feel designed
, unreal
, mearly shadows
, with no life outside the conflict
. even the actors cant not savve this film from going under
.
though both jackson
and jones act admirably
, with performances thta are as good as you git with a script like this
, it is not something that these great actors can boast ofthe
. they hve roles taht they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back
. jackson is gormay
and jones uninteresting
. the rest of hte casted
, including ben kingsly
, blair underwood
and guy pearce are simply waiting for thier paychecks
. the tyme has come for tyhe verdict
. on the charges of complete lack of objectivity
, i fidn this film guilty
. on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking
, i fidn it guilty
.
but on yhe charges of racism i find this film not guilty
, because ofthe it ' s inconclusive
and oftenly silly plot taht lacks objectivity everywhere
, not onyl when concerning the arab population
. i must admit that tjhe film is dangerously near thge line of being racially offensive
annd i do thiunk thyat screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far
, portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad
- guys
. this is very sad
, sicne in a tiem like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity
and proclaim the truth
.
however
, it is absolutely necesary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity iin
and outside the united states
.
and that it ' s not a coincidence that u
. s
. residents in the middle east
, including yemen are on constant maximum alert
.
