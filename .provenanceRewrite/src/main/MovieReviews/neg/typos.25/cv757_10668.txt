one niht
, during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets
, we whent to see
-
- what else
-
- hard rain
.
" so
, are we all gonig to die
?
" the sheriff
( randy quaid
) asks in the story ' s opening line as he evacuates his flooded twon
. the answer is pretty much yes
,
but not nearly soon enough
.
anbd to add insult to injury
, the supposedly dead
, regretfully
, often turn out not to be so
. populating htis bad tv
- movie
- of
- the
- week material are a host ofthe talented actors
. one cin only hope tehy were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture
. besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling inaddition teh water
, htey will all recieve black marks onthe theri records for appearing infact this dismal movie
. graham yost ' s scirpt serves uv noe cliche after another for the actors
, who thankfully managed tothe mumble qtuie a faw ofthe the lines
. director mikael salomon ' s staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening
. the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies
, jr
. ' s dark
and ugli cinematography
. the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck infact hte raging water
. onboard are guards tom
adn his uncle charlie
. christian slater
, who is much better infront his tender roles as in untamed heart
, plays tom
. edward asner drops by briefly to tkae on the role of tjhe soon tothe be dead charlie
. comming tothe thier
" rescue
" is a gang headed by jim
, played onthe autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman
. he views the loot
, threee million dollars worth
, as his retirement plan
. hte entire movei is noe big watery chase with the sherif
anbd his posse tracking jim
anbd his gang
, who are inwhich turn after tom
. along the way
, tom picks up a love interst in the person of a crucifix
- weapon wielding woman named karen
, played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver
. the action sequences are repetitive
anbd without much interst
. they dont feature lots of explosions
and gunfire to keep yuo awake
. christopher young ' s emotionless score for the film hasnt a single trait
, ear
- shattering loudness
. the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks
, submerging the town
. the characters hvae an infinite number ofthe bullets
adn rarely do htey hve to bother reloading theri guns
. the weapons
and the ammunition spend most ofthe thge time under water or being rained on
but always fire perfectly
. when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water
, it stays in the same palce untli much later wehn tom swims tothe get it
, even
though yhe swift water is so strong it is uprooting larg trees
. counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your timne as you wait for the charactors to kill each other
. the show hasnt a single
,
but unprintable
, good line
. betty white plays an incessantly bossy wief
,
annd
, when her hen
- pecked husband finaly told her off
, our audeince roared with laughter
. the show concludes with a sickening setted of twists
. the best that cant be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed tothe laughably bad
. hard rain runs 1
: 37
. it isnt rated r for violentce
and owudl be fine for teenagers
.
( the two fimilies behind us shockingly had a half
- dozen preschoolers among them
.
