it ' s actually nto so bad that dreamworks decided to release the loev letter at about thte same time as star wars episode i
: the phantom menace
, becasue this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful littel comedy
.
anbd no
, i really don ' t feel guilty about wishing this movie death at tyhe box
- office
. raelly
, i don ' t
. not at all
. the plot has been done before
-
- a mysterious
, unaddressed love letter shows uv in a small town
, causing confusion for everyone who reads it
. the center of the ensuing disaster isnt bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
and by the way
, what isnt it wtih bookstore owner main characters
? inthe teh past year
adn a half we ' ve seen them in life is beautiful
, you ' ve got mial
, this movie
,
and the upcomming notting hill
)
, who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore
. she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be ffrom
,
and comes to the
( incorrect
) conclusion that hte author of the onot is a young employee played by tom everett scott
. he
, reading yhe letter himself
, assumes thast she wrote it for him
. after a while
, they fall in love
( well
, duh
)
. kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship withthe someone more than twenty yeras yuonger tahn her
,
and she also feels guilty because at the smae time she isnt also involved with the town fireman
( tom selleck
)
. to add to her turmoil
, her mother shows up
( blythe danner
, who apparently must have had her daugher when she was about 9
)
adn her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting characters aren ' t called supporting for nothing
. their purpose isn ' t jstu to move the plot along
, htey ' re alsot supposed to give the storyline a backbone
. to do this
, they must exhibit at least marginal depth
and must allso be interesting
. rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist infact the middle
and surounds her with hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondary characters
, especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist ' s various interactions with them
. this is the love letter ' s damning error
. capshaw ' s character is as good as i ahev seen present inaddition recent romantic comedies
,
but the people that suround her are all either underwritten or purely one
- dimensional
. because of that
, the love letter is awcward
and insincere
. even worse
-
- it ' s a bore
. i liked capshaw
and her helen
,
but everyone eles is painfully fake
, undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has tjhe potential to exist
. there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either
-
-
and besides degeneres ' wisecracks
, there ' s littel that is even a little amusing
. this is nto a completely thoughtless film
and director peter ho
- sun chan does a good job of portraying helen ' s yearnings
and vairous subtle complexities
.
but it ' s far from profound
. ther isn ' t a common theme running through thte proceedings
, thus the movei seems thoughtfully pointless
. really
, this is a harmless little movei
; it ' s far from an abomination
annd it ' s not torturous to sit through
.
but bad
, it is
. awful
, it aslo is
. the love letter is a failure
,
and an inane failure at that
