first impressions
: critically
, a close
- tothe
- awful film
,
bu money
- wise
, it hasnt beeen doing
(
adn will continue tothe do
) graet
. a sometimes
- funny film that sags
and lags
and oftentimes gets boring
. an orginal plot that grows ood real fast
. one of the only 90 minute films that i ' ve gotten bored through
. men inwhich balck has defied tghe odds
. when i first saw that tyhe flick was 89 minutes long
, i thougth maybe that tihs was a poor attempt at an independence day tipe film that just ran out of gas
.
howver
, i nowe realize tyhat not only did men in balck run out ofthe gas
,
but the film in 90 mintues manages tothe show off a very original idae
( which summer audiences have embraced
) tath becomes ood about 25 minutes into thge movie
. tommy lee jones
and will smith play twpo
" govenment
" agents who are reponsible for keeping order iin alien society
. the ridiculous plot begins when an alien
" bug
"
, played weirdly by vincent d ' onofrio
, who was so graet in full metal jacket
, lands on earth to retreive a galaxy that ' s somewhere on
" orion ' s bilt
.
" anyway
, tghe basic plot revolves aroud jones
and smith tothe stop this bug from getting tje galaxy
, or a higher pwoer will blow uv the earth
. the premise is ridulous
,
but that is nto why i didn ' t like this film
. i lvoe original plots
. this noe had an original one
.
bu director barry sonnenfeld did something tothe this film tath ruined its plot
: he made the film drag
anbd also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films
. whenever i saw d ' onofrio ' s bug stomp
and eat people in the film
, it got terribly boring after a while
. while smith ' s wise
- cracks did fill in the gaps
, it wasn ' t enought
.
and also
, i cannot believe hte screenwriters ellected tothe hve a sub
- plot where tommy lee jones missed his fromer lover becuase as an alien agent
, they can ' t have contact with any humans realy
.
and here i see jones
, at a satellite coputer
, watching his lover plant tjhe gardai
? a sentimental moment in an alien movie
? nice try
,
but i don ' t think so
. it doesn ' t wokr here
. it jsut makse the movie even more ridiculous
and even more boring
: we don ' t only have aliens to worry about
,
bu now we ahev jones ' s conscience
. i cameback into tjhe movie not wanting to see jones ' s conscienec
,
bu wanting to see a rela action movie that had lots of aliens in it
. maybe it ' s unfair tht i partly judged this movei onthe what my expectations were
. nevertheless
, even
though smoe parts are indeed funny
, the plot in thsi movei growed old
and boring
-
- quick
