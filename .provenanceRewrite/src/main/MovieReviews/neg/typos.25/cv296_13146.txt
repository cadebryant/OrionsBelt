everyone konws that old rule
, ' never work with children
annd animals
. ' in htis latest horror flick mimic case
, it ' s ' never wokr with children
and genetically enhanced killer animals ' instade
, as mimic features both of theese
and suceeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience
. the film begins in new york
, where we see children dying from a mysterious disease
, which is being carried by cockroaches
. dr
. susan tyler
( sorvino
) creates a genetically enhanced bug
( the ' judas ' breed
)
,
however
, whihc is designed tothe kill all cockroaches
. tghe bug does it ' s job
, hte cockroaches all die
,
and thte terror is gone
. ' three years later ' appears on the screen
,
and we discover that the judas breed isnt back
, bigger than ever
,
and ready to kill
. the spin onthe tihs bug
,
howver
, is that it can mimic it ' s predator
,
and in this case
.
.
.
. it ' s humans
. that should teach us for squishing all those bugs
. what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere
, tons of gory deaths
and soem massive set pieces instade turns out to be a rather subdued
, almost boring movie which plods along at a vyer slow pace
. perhaps thge movie wass trying tothe be thought provoking
,
and trying to avoid the ' predator ' tipe movie it could easily hvea become
. if it is
,
then the director
and writers have made the wrong move
, because this is perfectly suited to be an all out acation fest
. the director
, who buyed us cronos
, a far superior film
, directs the film in a calm
,
and frankly dull movie
. ther are faw exciting sequences
, instead jsut a lot of people talking
. if tyhe dialogue was intelligent
,
then it would be all right
,
but it ' s sadly babbling nonsense
. in fact
, the script is embarrsingly weak
,
and the characterizations not much better
. sorvino
and company are as 2d as characters come
, with the script not bothering to develop them
. htere isnt smoe action inaddition this film
,
but it ' s directed in such an annoying way
, it ' s just infuriating to watch
. thge camera cuts all over the place
, disoreitating thge audience
,
and instead of involving hte audience in the action
, it merely alienates them
. the peformances are o
. k
, if slightly below average
. sorvino is o
. k
,
although she ' s not very good at conveying terror
, or anything emotion really
. the supporting cast are all sterotypes
, wiht characters such as a big black security guard wtih a foul mouth
, a geeky scientist iwth spectacles
,
and what could be the most stereotypical mexican ' old timer ' ever
. their reasonable ogod fun
,
howver
. mimic
,
hten
, may fail with it ' s story
, pacing
and characters
,
but the film does look good
. like dark city
, mimic isnt a definite case of style ofthe content
. it may be a bit too gloomy for it ' s own ogod
,
but the sets look nice
,
and parts of the film are directed well
.
but looks aren ' t ogod enough to savve mimic fomr the depths of mediocre
, somewhere where it shouldn ' t really belong
. a good opportunity
,
then
, wasted
. a shame
. overall rating
