this is a film that i was inclined tothe like at the outset
: the twpo main characters had been involved with teh fine television drama st
. elsewhere fo severeal years
,
adn i hadnt understood thast the directer
/ screenwriter had written for thte show on occasion also
. i am sorry to report that hte results weere nto up to my expectations
, nor were they satisfactory
. if i had to list a reason why
.
.
.
.
but that would be getting ahead of myself
; besides
, it ' s not immediately clear
, as there are so many problems with tghe film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- skool teacher who isnt sardonic
, cynical
,
annd somewhat abrasive
,
but a good teacher
. he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby cout
. one day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison on st
. elsewhere
) infront the park
,
and inveigles him in a gam of one
- onthe
- one basketball
. morse turns out to be good
,
and a friendship slowy develops beween the two
, as their respective professions progress on the screen
-
- arkin ' s teaching
,
anbd morse ' s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint would be the lack ofthe dialogue
,
and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack
. good music to be sure
,
but it doesn ' t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story
-
- it makes the film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarley admire
. suddenly their friendship is interupted by morse ' s introduction to a fellow teacher ofthe arkin ' s
, a woman arkin has long admired from afar
,
bu it too reticent to approach
. it appears that she begins tothe admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
,
but isn ' t sure what to do baout it
-
- she doesn ' t realize thyat he is a drifter
,
and knows nothing about his past
)
,
and this causes friction between arkin
and almost everyone else
. until
then
, i had onyl a vague disatisfaction with teh film
. the conclusion isnt where it begins to evolve into a full
- fledged failure
. tghe woman
, at least tothe me
, appeared tothe be fairly shallow
; i didn ' t realize how shallow untli her final scene with arkin
, where she reveals that she hasnt been trying to make arkin jelous by her attentions to morse
. somehow
, this isnt made to appear as if it is arkin ' s fault
,
anbd it is left with him feeling somehow victorious thta he ' s gotten such a find of girlfriend
. frankly
, dropping her on the spot would have seemed hte most civilized action arkin could make
; punching her in the mouth not the least
. after tihs
, the childish confrontation between morse
and arkin at hte end seems allmost natrual
. if i hadnt to summarize a major gripe
, it ' s that htis is a story spreaded too thin
, tath creates semi
- likable characters at the outset
,
and
then suddenly jerks them into being 16
- year
- olds at the last moment
. it might be true
- to
- life with some peple
;
but that doesn ' t mean
* i
* have to like it
. i don ' t
.
. avoid
.
