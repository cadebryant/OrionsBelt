at first glance
, i thought taht thte sword
and the sorceror had promise
. its plotline goes liek this
: the evil king cromwell
, desiring to take over the world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia for power
. he attacks thge kingdom ofthe eh
- dan
adn kills young prince talon ' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( which can shoot bad guys
, like a gun
) by his dieing father
, talon vows fo revenge
. eleven yeasr later
, wehn he ' s established his pwn army
, tyhe mercaneries
, he vows to take back his kingdom
. along thge way
, he meets up with alana
, whose vilage is attacked by drunken guards
and her brother isnt kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows tothe help
,
and
, after a series of minor escapades
, eventually ends up rescuing alana ' s brother
(
and several other prisoners
)
, only to be captured himself
( in otehr words
, put onthe a cross to be crucified
!
)
. fortunately he frees himself
, rescues alana fomr marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
,
and
then cromwell
, all with his triple bladed sword
( during the fianl battle
, the blade breaks
,
bu talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade
)
.
then
, everything ends happily
. unfortunately
, the sword
and thte sorcerer is nto even half as good as it sounds
. waht would have beeen a gerat film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
,
and gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once doesnt the story seem to connect together
, it jsut jumps aroud repeteadly
. this problem is extrememly noticeable inspite the oppening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. after telling him thgat he needs his help
, he leads the warlock outloud inot daylight
,
but
then stabs him
and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards
. wait a minute
, didn ' t the plotline say that he needs the halp ofthe xusia in order tothe invade eh
- dan
, wich he cannot do by military force
? if that is the case
, why does he dispose of xusia aftter resurrecting him
?
and why does he manage tothe take over eh
- dan anyway
? theese questions are just never
- no
, never
- answered in tyhe film
. anohter example is that one moent we see talon fighting for his life
, another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana ' s wedding to cromwell
(
!
)
,
adn fianlly at tyhe end
, instead of settling down with alana
, he just tells her tothe
" wait
"
,
and
hten he just rides off
! in addition to hte extremely bloody scenes
, this uneven plot jumping completely destroys whta woudl have beeen a gerat fantasy adventure
. even smoe attempts to make it exciting
, a few fier scenes
, battle scenes
, don ' t work
. it just completely fails altogether miserably
. the only good thnig baout this film is its musical csore
, contributed by david whittaker
, who had an
( extremly
) short music composing career
. the score is boomy
and adventurous
, powerful
,
and a billion times better than this film is
. my suggestion
: steer tjhe hell away from this bloody mess
and buy the sountrack album instead
( if you can find it
)
. ironically
,
though
, before the film ' s credits roll
, there is a message indicating tath a sequel
, tales ofthe the ancient empire
, would follow
. to my releaf
(
and delight
)
, it never got inot production
, because the sword
and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office
, grossing onyl
$ 39 millon
. critics weere right on in slamming the sword
anbd tyhe sorceror
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate in scripting
,
annd acting
"
and at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally agre wtih these reviews
, all right
,
adn i hope that this peice of
#
$
%
! will be forgotten about
. ther are far better fantasy movies thna the sword
and the sorcerer
. i hope you git a good laugh outloud of tihs review
,
bu i am not laughing
. inaddition fatc
, my insults don ' t even come close tothe the gruesome sickness tyhat this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time
.
