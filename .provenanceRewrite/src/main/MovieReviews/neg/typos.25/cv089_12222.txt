tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 mintues into the movie
. thte film
( which opened in canada during 1992
but was never released in the united states
) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
,
and
, while it ' s evident thgat htis could be a fascinating live production
, the translation to the screen is a creative disaster
. enduring tectonic plates is liek sitting thru a filmed verzion of performence art
-
- lifeless
and tedeous
. tje qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium
. tectonic plates has a storyline
,
although the narrative is developed inthe a decidedly non
- traditionnal fashion
, with shots of the stagebound play intercut wiht more tipical cinematic sequences
. it ' s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie
( despite tyhe valid complaint that it is pretentious
, all
-
bu
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
,
altough it keeps the audiance distanced from the characters
. because we ' re constantly made aware that we ' re watching a play or a movie
, it ' s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writter ' s idaes
. they ' re not real
, sympathetic
, or believeable
. i ' m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something differnt
,
bu this particular experiment is not a success
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studying infront montreal who has falled in love with her professor
, jacques
( lapage
)
. one day
, he disappears
,
and
, fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his loev
, madeleine travels to venice to kill herself
. hwile preparing to commit suicide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine to re
- thikn her decission
. meanwhile
, jacques has moved to new york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himself jennifer
,
and becomes a successful counter
- culture talkshow host
. withthe settings thyat shift from paris tothe venice to montreal tothe manhattan to scotland
, supporting characters that include a topless goddess
anbd a deaf
/ mute
,
and cultural references tyhat point to chopin
, george sand
,
and jim morrison
, tectonic plates is unique
, if nothing else
.
however
, as interesting as the film soudns
(
anbd i was excited to see it beccause the synopsis is promising
)
, it never really delivers
. the tone is soporific
, the supposedly
- intellectual prattle is inane
and uninteresting
, the plot meanders iin a pointless
and irritating manner
(
altough it doesn ' t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant
)
,
and the symbolism isnt obvious
. tectonic plates isnt trying tothe show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth
,
but it takes oen
- hundered minutes to get across this transparent point
. htere are smoe worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight between jacques
and thge topless goddess
and an entertaining discussion in both french
adn english baout the differences between the twpo laguages
(
although hte fine points iwll certainly be lost on those who aren ' t bilingual
)
. the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who efel a strong need to praise something this rootless
adn boring because
( a
) it ' s different
,
( b
) it ' s not like anything they ' ve seen before
,
and
( c
) it ' s pretentious
. for everyone esle
, it ' s not only a waste of time
,
but a poore introduction to the work of robert lapage
.
