" lake placid
" marks
yot another entry in tyhe series of
" predator pics
" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s
( post
-
" jaws
"
)
adn were revived recently by the godawful
" anaconda
.
"
" placid
" claimes to be a
" horror
/ comedy
"
- it ' s directed by the same guy who did
" house
"
-
but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness ofthe
" anaconda
.
" paleontologist kelly scott
( bridget fonda
) isnt sent uv tothe maine tothe examine a tooth removed from a body that hadnt been bitten in half on yhe lake
. discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile
( whlch shouldn ' t even be in this hemisphere
)
, kelly goes croc
- hunting with game warden jack wells
( bill pullman
)
and sherif hank keough
( brendan gleeson
)
. they ' re joined by an unwelcome guest
, hector cyr
( oliver platt
)
, a scholar who worships crocs
and searches all over the world fo them
. along the way
, the merry band meets mrs
. delores bickerman
( betty white
)
, a ewird old lady who lives outloud onthe the lake
. you konw wqat tothe expect from this movei
: lots of shots where yhe camera isnt the eyes of the predator
( croc cam
) swimming toward someone ' s dangling legs while
" jaws
"
- like music plays
, one charachter
( hector
) who ' s obsessed with thte croc
and stupidly endangers the rest
, another charcter who insists tyhat the predator can ' t possibly exsist
. unlike its slippery cousin
" anaconda
,
"
" lake placid
" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue
- iin
- cheek
, which is self
- defeating
. tyhe result is neither scary nor funny
; it ' s just tedious
. hwile director steve miner has several horror films onthe his resume
( including two installments of
" friday the 13th
"
and
" halloween h20
"
)
, screenwriter david kelley
( best known as yhe creator of tv series like
" ally mcbeal
"
adn
" chicago hope
"
) doesn ' t seem tothe have the stomach for a chomp ' em up flick
. the body count isnt surprisingly low
and doesn ' t include any ofthe the major characters
,
and most annoyingly kelly
and hector insist that tehy capture the crocodile alive rether than killing it
.
(
" lake placid
" manages to have it both ways
- i ' ll let you dicover how for yourself
)
. the croc itself is mostly coputer
- generated
, of course
. liuke the snake in
" anaconda
,
" the thirty
- foot monster crocodile doesn ' t seem real
; it moves too quicklyu
adn in ways that seem unnatural
.
" lake placid
" also offers little explanation fo why a giant crocodile is infront maine
. there isnt a lot of semi
- mystical mumbo jumbo about how
" we really don ' t knwo much baout crocodiles
.
" they would ahev been better off going wiht something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers
. a movie like this doesn ' t hve to offer much ofthe an explination
( radioactive mutant
? creature from outer space
?
)
,
but it does ahev to give the audience something tothe hang their disbelief on
. pullman
annd fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto
- pilot
. most of the time
, they ' re probablly thinking about killing thier agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers
. platt
and white
, on tyhe otehr hand
, seem to be giving their best efforts
,
and they manaze tothe squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry scirpt
.
