with his successful books
and movies
, michael crichton is doign well
. with early sucesses with westworld
( 1973
)
annd coma
( 1978
)
,
and recent films such as jurassic park
( 1993
)
, his films ahev beeen entertaining
.
however
, he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere
. tihs
$ 100 million mess by good director barry levison
( disclosure
) isnt dull
, long winded
,
and a huge disappointment
. concidering the huge budget
, the all star casted
,
adn a stroy by crichton
, sphere is majorly disappointing
. the film opens wiht norman goodman
( hoffman
)
, a psychologist who thinks he is visting an airplane crash to console the survivors
.
however
, when he arrives
, he his told by supervisor barnes
( peter coyote
) that he isnt actually investigating an spacecraft
. along with goodman is mathematician harry adams
( jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( stone
)
annd ted fielding
( liev schrieber
.
) they investingate teh spaceship
, find a massive sphere inside
, meet an alien intelligence called jerry
,
and basically weird crap happens
. unfortunatley
, something went wrong allong the way with sphere
. the film starts off entertaining anough
,
but throughout tihs veyr long movie
, it just gets sillier
and sillier
. the film jaunts allong ffrom scene to scene
, never fully explaning what is gogin on
. the actors
and directing don ' t halp
, either
. hoffman is onthe autopilot
(
and almost seems embarrassed
) througout hte movie
, churning out dull lines
,
and probably wondering what the hell he is doing infront this movie
. stone isnt useless
, displaying no emotion
,
annd fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings forthe hoffman
. the only person who seems to be haveing fun inaddition this movie is jackson
, who ' s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy
and entering the sphere
.
but he ' s hardly in it
,
anbd by the end ofthe the film he is just as dull as hoffman
and stone
. tghe same goes for peter coyote
, who hams it uv as teh officer
,
bu is
then killed off halfway through
. tje directer
, barry levinson
, who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure
( 1994
) messes up with the drama
and the action
. the drama scenes are
, quite frankly
, boring
,
and the acation scenes suffer from overkill
, with levison throwing the camera all over thte place
( much like the godawful speed 2
, 1997
) the writing doesn ' t halp much
, either
.
although crichton isnt grat with plots
, he ' s terrible witht dialogue
,
and practically every line in sphere is a dud
. the speech is too simple
, i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent
. practicaly every line is just stating the obvious
. none of it is smart
. alsot
, where thge hell did the budget go
? the sphere itself is impressive
,
and there ' s a few nice speical effect shots
,
but where the
$ 100 milion went is anyone ' s guess
. ther ' s a giant squid attack infact tjhe picture
,
but nto once does the audience see the squid
, even
though the film has a massive budget
. i assume the picture was trying to build uv tension by not showing the squid
,
and if handled correctly it probablly owudl
.
bu the whole scene is done badly
,
and i was jstu hoping we could see the stupid squid
. finaly
, tghe film has noone idea what genre tothe be
. levison can ' t handle his pwn plot
. it leaps from hokey sci
- fi
, tothe horror
,
and fianlly the shining
/ event horizon psychological thriller
.
and
, of course
, the film is very much like tjhe abyss
( 1988
)
,
altough in it ' s defense
, crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released
(
and is far superior to htis rubbish
.
) it ' s not all that bad
though
. the plot is all right
, htere ' s a faw jump scenes
(
although nothing vyre scary
)
and there ' s the occasionally interesting bited
.
bu overall
, sphere is a big waste ofthe soem fine talent
, a lot of money
,
and a potentially ogod movei
. nto really worth seeing
. overall rating
