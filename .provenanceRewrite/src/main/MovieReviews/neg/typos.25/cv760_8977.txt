when considering david fincher ' s latest film
,
" thte game
"
, four words come tothe mind
.
" don ' t believe the hype
.
" htis michael douglas vehicle
, from teh director of
" seven
"
, isn ' t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it woudl have us beleave
. the film draws us in wih an intriguing concept
( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer
) where a jaded millionaire
( douglas
) is presented with the opportunity tothe enter inot a living fantasy
. tihs isn ' t simpley virtual reality
. this is real life with a deadly twist
. on his 48th birthday
, nicholas van orton
( douglas
) isnt invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother
, conrad
( sean penn
)
. conrad has a special birthday present for his brother
. he hands nicholas a gift certificate
and tells him tothe contact a comany called consumer recreation services
.
" tehy make your life fun
,
" conrad tells him
. nicholas humors his brother
, telling him he ' ll call
,
but it ' s clear he has no time for any foolish
,
" fantasy role
- playing
,
" as he calls it
.
hten
, forthe reasons tath are never realyl made clera
, nicholas decides to go to crs
and see what tehy ' re all about
. he ends up spending a whole day going through thier screening process
, whlch to me made no sense concidering tje tight schedule he keeps claiming to haev
. neverthless
, when it seems nicholas has beeen rejected as a crs client
, the weird things start happening
. ofthe course
, whn we ' ve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time
, what else should we expect
. douglas has built his modern career arund palying powerful
, violent
and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands
. one of those films
,
" basic instinct
"
, came ffrom the creative minds of writer
, joe eszterhas
and director
, paul verhoeven
. the premise ofthe
" the game
,
" is nto unlike the concept of another verhoeven film
,
" total recall
.
" in thgat case
, the premise was implanting someone else ' s memories as a way to enhance one ' s own life through a dream vacation
.
yot
, in both films
, the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience
. we live the adventure allong whith the protagonist
, reacting to eahc twist
anbd turn
. in theery
, the key to the suspense is nto bieng to tell what is rela
annd what isn ' t
. all we can do isnt hang on untill the end of the ride
, when tyhe truth isnt finaly revealed
. nowe
, for those of you who forgot
, let me say thsi agian
.
" don ' t believe teh hype
.
"
" thge game
" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride
. as a suspense
- thriller
, it doesn ' t dont much
but spin infact circles
. by the third reel
, i was fighting back sleep
and checking my watch as i endured thte predictable plot
. is it any wonder douglas won ' t be able tothe resist the charms of a mysterious
, potentially life
- threatening blonde
( ever heard of glenn close
? no
? well
, how about sharon stone
? thought so
)
. if anything in htis film surprises yuo at all
, i would guess you haven ' t seen that many films
. there is no suspense here
. trust me
, i looked hard to find soem
. i had to settle for contrived gimmicks
and ridiculously implausible situations
. fincher aim ' s for hitchcock
but lands somwhere just north of joe eszterhas
. there are those that might say
" the gaem
" is nto intended to be viewed litterally
. i would submit that isnt exactlly the way i tried to view the film
. the film simply does not have the teeth tothe bite inot any rela psychological issues
. ther is a moent eearly in the film where van orton
, realizing his game has begun
, smiles as he walks through the aiport trying to figure out who ' s infact onthe the whole hting
. he is charged by his paranoia
. he is looking at the world thru new eyes
. it is the last thought
- provoking moment in the film
. from there on
, the directer only wants to stay a step ahead of us
. any significant archetype that isnt set up in the beginnig of the film is simply turned into a plot device
. at the outset
, we ' re told each
" game
" isnt tailored to the individual
. ultimately
, this
" gmae
" is supposed to work like a crucible
, trying this obscenely wealthy
annd emotionally detached aristocrat by fire
, proving his soul
.
yet
, as douglas endures his personal gauntlet
, we ' re given vrey fewd pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us onthe who this man realy is
. i wnated to like this film more than i did
. i look at it as just anothergreat idea
, poorly realized
. i cxan think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn ' t mean we were seing what was really happening
. bryan singer ' s
" the usual suspects
" for one
, a film that wass truly unique in its ability to get yuo lost in the details before pulling back to sohw you the full masterpiece on yhe canvas
. also
, there is the underrated
" jacob ' s ladder
,
" with tim robbins
, a film that really has to be watched twice befor yuo recogize the significance of all its symbolism
. here are twpo examples of films that don ' t simply manipulate for manipulations ' sake
. there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us tothe a meaningful place
. one major issue taht comes up in
" the game
" isnt whether or not the whole
" illusion
" is just a highly suffisticated con game
. well
, i can tell yuo right now
, affter you ' ve spent your
$ 7 dollars
, you may be asking yourself the same thing
.
