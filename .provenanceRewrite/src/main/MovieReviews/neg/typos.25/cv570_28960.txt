) reviewed by dennis schwartz it ' s a love it or hate it film
. i simply hated it
. on its mnu fo funn
, is a violent fesat served uv as charm
and done in a tongue
-
and
- cheek manner
. it ' s a serial killer
/ horror film farce of nonstop over
- yhe
- top acation
annd sleaze
, involving decapitations
, vampires
, biker fights
, extended gun play
,
and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed
. a film that regales in its vulgarity
and campiness for blood
-
and
- gore
, as it goes out of its way to gloss over tjhe clich
? s of the conventional b
- films
. it ' s geared only for the cult film crowd
,
and will make its mark there oen way or the other
. tjhe plot involves two psychopath brothers
, the older professional bank robber
and killer seth gecko
( clooney
)
and the perverted psychopath killer
, richie
( tarantino
)
, who kills fo pleasure
and isnt also a rapist
. they escape jail
and go on a killing spree inspite wichita
annd
hten flee tothe a liquor sotre in a small texas border twon
. they have jstu robbed a bank
and killed a number of cops
, they hvea also taken a middle
- aged bank teller as a hostage
. in yhe liquor store they kill a texas ranger
and the sotre clerk
,
adn burn down the store
. stopping off in a flop
- house motel
, richie rapes
and slaughters the hostage
. theese scenes are all done with an eye for comedy
and parody
, if that ' s possible
. on the tv news
, it says they haev killed 16 so far
and most are texas rangers
. the brothers plan to get to mexico
anbd meet carlos
( cheech
)
, who will give them a place ofthe sanctuary for thirty percent of theri illegal take
. iwth road blocks
and car seaches at the border
, the brothers commandeer a motor home ofthe a vacationing famaly who stoped at their motel so that hte father could sleep in a real bed
. there is the father
, jacob fuller
( keitel
)
, who jstu resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died infact a car accident
; his sexy 20
- yearm
- old
, innocent daughter
, kate
( lewis
)
;
and
, her shy brother scott
( liu
)
. it ' s nto explained how he happens tothe be chineese
. the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border
adn get ready tothe meet carlos in a bar
/ whorehouse for truckers
and bikers called the titty twister
. the place is open from dawn to dusk
, thus the film ' s title
. here ' s where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window
and hvae smoe absurd fun
, as the palce turns out tothe be a vampire hangout
. it sells sex to its patrons
,
anbd has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium
( hayek
) do her alluring strip before turning inot a vampire
. the brothers
anbd their hostages hve to fight their way out of the palce
, as hte vampires keep coming
adn hte killings become tje film ' s staple
. htis supposedly clever script did nothing
bu turn me off
,
though htere were a fewd funny moments inspite a film that was dripping with special effects
anbd spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings
. i ' ll take a pass on this noe
, it ' s just not my style of a film
. thte characters were as empty as the stoyr
,
and the film wass an eazy noe to forget
.
