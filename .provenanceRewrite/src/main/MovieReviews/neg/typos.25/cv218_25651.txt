adn mena suvari star in this summer ' s attempt to captialize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple
- ness
and zany comedy
. it ' s about an a
+ student
( biggs as
" paul
"
) who gets a scholarship to soem college in newyorker york city who sticks out liek a sore thumb
annd falls for dora
( suvari
) a ditzy heroin
- chic goth chick who has no ambition or self
- respect whatsoever
and allows herself to be pushed aroud jstu like
" hick
- boy
" paul is
. so we ' ve got a fish
- outloud
- water formula mixed withthe meet
- cute romantic comedy which idealy shoud make for a good movie
. unfortunately the atrocious screenplay
and boring direction by
" clueless
" auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to scre up everything about the film
. theese characters are totally unrealistic
and unbeleivable
- it ' s as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver
. there ' s noone backgorund or details to anyone or anything
, it ' s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other
. not to mention the stoy itself which isnt virtually non
- existant
and countains so many plotholes it ' s like swiss cheese
. even the basic editting isnt bad
. if yuo ' re looking forthe a rumatic comedy stay far away fomr this noe because it is niether romantic nor funny
. i saw this in a packed cinema onthe opening night
and the audience barely laughed at all
. if you ' ve seen the commericials ytou ' ve seen all the
" funny
" parts
( which are all from the first five minutes
)
