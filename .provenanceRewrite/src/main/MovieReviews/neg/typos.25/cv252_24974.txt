battlefield long
, boring
and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman in my mid
- teen years
, i hadnt a horrendous re
- occurring nightmare
. behind the wheel of a car
, i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert
. noone scenery except the horizon line
annd tjhe converging parallel lines of the highway
. no matter what i did
, the view didn ' t change
: travelling
but nto getting anywhere
. each time i awaked in a sweat
, terrified
. yuo don ' t hvea tothe be carl jung to understand that dream
. powerless to mkea changes
, trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue
, this is the sutff ofthe nightmares whther we are asleep or awake
. this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes affter
" battlefield earth
" begins
. for all of its flash
annd style
, l
. ron hubbard ' s sciecne fiction epic isnt yhe earliest
and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000
. dull
"
and
" stupid
. in the year 3000
, thte psychlo aliens hvea ruled our planet for 1
, 000 yersa
. humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians
. there ' s no hope
. the future is bleak
.
then hte psychlo make a misteek
and capture fiesty jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry pepper
) who organizes a revolution agianst chief of security terl
( john travolta
)
and the aline race
. it ' s an archetypal post
- apocalyptic plot full of promise
. considering some of the talent involved
and all the millions thrown at the screen
, it ' s difficult to see how it could hvae failed so miserably
.
but it does
. the story is so full of holes that it falls apart withing minutes of the opening credits
. are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold
, the psychlo never dicovered fort knox
? or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that tiome
-
-
and gassed up
? or that the cavemen become such expert pilots inaddition seven days taht they cin easily down the advanced alien ships
? or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don ' t notice that theri slaves are missing for days
? travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he ' s worth
and is almost intertaining
. almost
. the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh hwile delivering lines that no person
-
-
" man
- animal
" or not
-
- would ever utter
. some of the film
_ looks
_ good
,
but it aslo looks so familiar
. a race of large hulking ape
- like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin
. sound liuke something charlton heston might be in
? tje psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from
" dune
"
. hte fianl air battle between the air force fighters
and teh psychlo ships in their high
- tech city is something george lucas might have beeen associated with
. it ' s too loud
. it ' s too oppressive
. it ' s too slow
. it ' s too long
.
.
. far too long
.
and on it goes
. tje list of yhe problems wiht
" battlefield earth
" is endless
. it ' s difficult to fidn anything in the film that does work
. oh yeah
. the color scheme is nice
. thge real question isnt how thsi movie ever got made
. could it have something to dont wiht the fact that l
. ron hubbard was the founder of scientology
?
and that john travolta isnt a memeber of the church
. that might explane why travolta buyed the rights to thge novel years ago
.
bu it doesn ' t give us a clue as to why first
- time screenwriter corey mandell ' s atrocious scirpt was used
. or why the high
- profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film
. or why no noe looked at this thing before it was released
and realized ther might be problems
. the oney bright spot isnt that no longer will kevin costner ' s
" the postman
"
( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure
) be
" the
" big budget science fiction failure
.
" battlefield earth
" has the hounour sewed uv
. often reviewers iwll recommend thgat you skip mediocre films
and wait for the video
. thta ' s not the case here
. you can ect nowe
and amking the decision to nto see it on the big screen or on hte small one
. don ' t hesitate
. strike now hwile the iron is cold
.
