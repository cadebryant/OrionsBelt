" my name is jack carter
,
and you don ' t want to know me
" says our brooding anti
- hero
( sylvester stallone
)
. take his advice
! to know this guy isnt as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace
.
and tothe watch htis film isnt alomst as painful
.
" get carter
" is a gloomy looking
, unimaginative film that offers no joy
. jack carter isnt as tough as tough guys come
. he works outloud of vegas as a self
- described ' finacial adjuster '
. explaining his duties
, he syas
,
" people make promises
and break them
. i help them remember
.
" he has a chiseled body full of tattoos
. he has the weathered look indicative of a man who hasnt seen his share of hard times
. he speaks in a hushed
but menacing tone of voice
. in other words
, this is sylvester stallone acting like
.
.
. sylvester stallone
.
and like most ofthe his previvous roles
, his character isnt a shallow
, one
- dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough
, hassle a fewd hapless people
, fidn out what he needs to know
,
and
thne dispence his own kind of justice
. wih the charisma of a pit bull
, being tough is all thta jack carter knwos
.
yet
, even tough guys know when to put family first
. as tghe tsory begins
, we learn tyhat jack ' s little brother has died in a car accident
. the polical attribute it to heavy drinking
.
however
, jack isnt suspicious
, believing that he was ' taken outloud '
. he takes a break from his vegas duties
adn trys to see if he cxan find the truth
. as he pokes arund
, he runs into several lowlife characters
. they inlcude a shady business partner
, a prostitute
, a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates
,
and an oily owner ofthe a porn website
. any one ofthe them may know something about his brother ' s death
. all of them have the means ofthe carrying out the ded
.
but don ' t expect an exercise in sleuthing where well
- placed clues lead carter tothe the truth
. he ' s all brawn
and noone brains
, so there are no epiphanies during his investigation
. instead
, he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward
, cycling thru tihs circle of suspects
. flustered with his lack of progress
, he cycles through them again
and agian
. this all gets tiring fairly quickly
. by the time the film launches into its final act
, we ' re numb from its pedestrian pace
. oddly
, as a tough
- guy thriller
, it starves us forthe action
. admittedly
, there is one nifty chase sequence
,
but this is related to a tangential
and needless plot
( carter ' s vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him
)
. the stry also fails to generate any kind of emotion
. stallone hasnt thte personality of a slab of stone
.
and the look
and feel of the film is perpetually downcast
. thte weater is constanly overcast or rainy
. meanwhile
, most shots take place at night
, in dimly lit rooms
, or in dark alleys
. it ' s just impossible to get stirred baout that kind ofthe atmosphere
. as a result
,
" get carter
" amounts to nothing omre than a flat thriller
, bereft of clever moments
and devoid of any excitement
. you ' re better off leaving this guy alone
.
