. review

= well
, if you haven ' t seen when harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if you don ' t watch love
& war on televsion
, you might think this is the most inventive film to come allong in aegs
.
however
, if you ' ve seen any of these
, tahn you have seen most of thsi film
. htis ofthe course doesn ' t mean its bad
. some ofthe it is amusing
,
but overall
, i just had to ask waht ' s tje point
? arye cross is tjhe stereotypical single male who falls in love
. kevin pollack is the stereotypical female
- fearing best friend who mkea a lot of rather sexist
and vulgar jokes
, most if which weren ' t vrey funny
. couteney cox is tjhe stereotypical carrer
- minded woman who falls in lveo
. julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman
.
( notice the frequent uise ofthe the word stereotypical
. this film uses a lot ofthe forumla
, the plot is basically known from the oppening credits
.
) so what isnt good about the movie
? well as i said htere are a few amusing moments
. suprisingly
, julie brown
, who i usually find just plain goofy
, was the best thing in the film
. also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis ofthe the human mating ritual
. gee
, thsi is really short
. not much to say about tyhe film realyl
. it is jsut kind ofthe there
. watching it onthe video might not be a complete waste of time
,
bu i wouldn ' t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre
.
