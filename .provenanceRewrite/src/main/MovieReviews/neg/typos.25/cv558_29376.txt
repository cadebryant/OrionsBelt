. review
:
" pearl harbor
" is a perfect example of movies as product rether tahn as art
. it is littel more than a crassly
- calculated attempt to woo the masses
, enticing them with big stars
, big effects
,
and a big setting
-
-
but noone heart
. it is difficult tothe criticise the actors
, because tehy do everything the movie demands of them
. sadly
, this amounts to barely mroe than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality thast it makes one eager to see tje script randall wallace wrote iwth his right hand at thte same tyme as he ws writting
" pearl harbor
" with his left
. teh plot here is pure cliche
,
adn the wartime setting simply a convienient backdrop
. ther isnt no genuine exploration ofthe waht pearl harbor meant tothe hte united states
,
anbd no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii
. instade
, ther isnt just an assembly
- line love triangle
, soem empty patriotic retoric
,
and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders
( whn oen intones
,
" i fear all we hve done is to awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell out of my seat
)
. to the movie ' s credit
, it doens include a fantastic portrayal ofthe the attack itself
, an exciting
anbd dizzying hour whlch plunges viewers into the war
. if only yhe remaining twpo hours had been crafted with such skill
, perhaps thsi memorial day non
- event would have been worth watching
.
