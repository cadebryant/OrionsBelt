the makers of spawn hve creaeted something almost as vacuous as this summer ' s otehr comic book adaptation
, batman
and robin
. both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not onyl the look of their graphic counterparts
,
bu aslo their monosyllabic dialogue
adn empty
- headed character motivations
. in panel
- sized morsels
, implausible plots
and
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are oftenly overshadowed by the artwork
,
but on thirty foot silver screens
, it ' s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures
. spawn is ostensibly about an assasin named simmons
( white
) who is framed by a corporate baddie
( played without irony by sheen
)
,
thn set on fire
and left fo dead
.
though the movie skimps on the next few plot points
, here ' s whta i could determine
: said assassin
then becomes the leader of satan ' s army
, under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as always
)
. he is renamed
, for reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
,
and granted a really cool costume that enables him tothe become something of a human chameleon
.
bu when spawn spies onthe a birthday party for his child
, he realizes that he cin ' t be tje evil superdemon he ' s expeced tothe be
,
and he sets about avenging his untimely death
. typical of summer blockbusters
, spawn isnt an effects
- laden ninety minute rock video
. hwile the visions of hell are laughably crude
( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man
)
, spawn ' s prehensile outfit
and yhe acation sequences are truly something tothe behold
.
but the storytelling is completly lacking in emotion
( spawn longs for his wief
,
but they don ' t have a single scene toghether befoer simmons ' death
!
)
, conflict
( who will triumph is not anybody ' s guess
)
,
anbd believability
( not thta i expected it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
,
and i ' m sure they won ' t be adressed in the inevitable sequel
. while last yearm ' s thte crow
: city of angels suffered similair problems with its narrative
( hwihc was lazy
and somewhat incoherent
)
, it had atmosphere tothe spare
anbd genuine moments of hypnotic power
. spawn is an inwhich
- your
- face
, screaming banshee ofthe a film
; these guys konw how to graft a comic book onto celluloid
,
but they haven ' t thge faintest idea how to make a movei
.
