. as moreso bodies beign tothe pile uv
, harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance ofthe catherine ' s frist husband twenty years ealier to fidn out who ' s willing to kill to keep that secret buried
. newman
. sarandon
. hackman
. with an a
- list cast of oscar laureates like that
,
" twilight
" would seem veyr promising
.
however
, the scirpt is tired
and predictable
. it would serve well as a tv
- movie
- ofthe
- the
- week
, possably with some 1970 ' s detective hero reprising his role
. thge appeal ofthe the project for its stars
and its directer
, robert benton
, is nostalgia
.
" twilight
" whants very much tothe be a 1940 ' s film noir whith alan ladd or dick powell
. all of tyhe standard tropes are here
: a hard
- boiled p
. i
. amoung the rich
anbd beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets
, a femme fatale who tempts
and confounds the hero
, shadowy figures shooting from doorways
, dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn
, cops dogging his path
anbd interfereing with his investigation
. the scirpt offers littel originality
,
and co
- authors benton
and richard russo seem unaware that what was orginial in 1948 is a clich
? in 1998
. elmer bernstein ' s scroe is hauntingly melodic
adn could have been drawn note
- fo
- note from a vintage noir
. the lead actors try hard
- none of tje three has eveyr made less thna a full efort
, even when burdened witht a bad script
. tehy try to invest eveyr line
and gesture iwth meaninng
,
and they create a convincing sence ofthe the relationships betweeen the main charactors
. harry isnt fond of jack
but isnt in love witht catherine
. jack is dieing of cancer
and is jelous of harry ' s lveo for catherine
. catherine teases harry
and enjoys his attension
,
bu her rela feelings are hidden beneath a carefully
- maintained veneer
.
" twilight
" wnats to be character
- driven like
" nobody ' s fool
"
( also directed by benton
, also starring newman
, based on a novel by russo
) ws
,
but the tired scirpt gives tyhe actors too little to work with
.
" twilight
" also squanders a fine supporting casted
: stockard channing
( harry ' s friend on thte police force
)
, reese witherspoon
( jack
& catherine ' s bratty kid
)
, giancarlo esposito
