. lebanese
- born josef fares who wrote
and directed isnt perhpas a better director than he isnt a writer
. when things strat to get slow
, he just adds throws in another story
. forthe exmaple halfway into tjhe film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs
annd a long chase is added tothe tyhe film
. characterization is a littel better with roro tahn it is with mans who doens nto seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function
. we do see some of roro ' s family life
and his concerns
. that may be beccause roro ' s background isnt a lot liek that ofthe the directer
. while the story ws entertaining
, i did nto fiel that i got anything worthwhile from the film
. it was just a way tothe pass baout an hour
and a half in my life
. one does nto have to go to the movies tothe see entertainment like htis
. i rate it a 4 onthe hte 0 tothe 10 scale
and a 0 onthe thge
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
