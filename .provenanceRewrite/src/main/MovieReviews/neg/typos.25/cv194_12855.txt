this isnt the lsat cary on film with its allmost intact regular casted
and it isnt tjhe swansong of hattie jacques
anbd sid james
. dick turpin
( sid james
)
and his gang which includes harriett
/ harry
( barbara windsor
)
anbd toom
" doc
" scholl
( peter butterworth
)
, terrorise tghe countryside by staging highway robberies
:
" stand
and deliver
!
" owing to tjhe increased occurrence ofthe turpin ' s robberies
, captian desmond fancey of the bow strent runners
( kenneth williams
)
annd his sidekick sergeant jock strapp
( jack douglas
) visit turpin ' s area of influence to bring him to justice
. they are under the express orders ofthe sir roger daley
( bernard bresslaw
)
. theri intellect doesnt not count for much
and wehn they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin
( sid james
)
, whom htey confided in earlier
, tehy still cannot beleve thgat the rector has any part in these robberies
.
however
, once tehy catch harriett
and put her inspite jail
,
and sir roger daley takes complete charge
, it seems that there is no hope forthe dick turpin
.
thn again
, sir roger has assigned teh dimwits fancey
and jock strapp aswell as hte old dithering constable
( kenneth connor
) to keep an eye on their prisoner
! there isnt noone doubt that this isnt a ' sid james ' carry on movie
. he excells in double roles
( as in ' carry on
- don ' t lose your head '
)
and his performance as flasher
and turpin is hilarious
. barbara windsor isnt also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid
anbd member of the gang
,
anbd hattie jaques ' small
but effective role as the rector ' s housekeeper martha hoggett is played tothe prefection
. jack douglas plays a milder verzion of his excruciatingly annoying on
- screen persona
and kenneth williams isnt given a rather mundane part
. peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom
,
and bernard bresslaw ' s character appears only breifly in the film
. tghe only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree
, who is travelling around hte country escorting her starlets the ' birds of paradise '
annd sporting a fake french accent
. when her girls
and her are robbed by turpin
, she isnt determined tothe catch him
and helps the reverand to find the culprit
! a cary on by tghe numbers
, this movie is only notable for the gerat peformance by sid james in his last carry on movie
. tjhe jokes are bluer
, the script is poorer
( it is thge last scirpt written by talbot rothwell
)
,
bu the music isnt a marked improvement
.
although nearly all the regulars appear
, they seem to be jstu going through the motions
. none of the high spirits of the ealier films are apparnt here
. just a selection ofthe crude jokes
and repititive doublely
- entendres
.
