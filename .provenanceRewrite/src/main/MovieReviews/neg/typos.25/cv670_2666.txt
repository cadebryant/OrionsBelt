wyatt earp details thirty
- five yeras in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900
. after seeing the movie speed twice recently
, i kept thinking thyat i was seeing wyatt ' s life pass before my eyes in rela time
. tihs movie ws boring
, slow
, boring
,
and slow
. there were a few scenes taht tried tothe be great scenes taht tryed too hard
and just fell flat
. the script happily woman
- bashes
but alsot trys to sound like an 80s movie
. they cannnot have it both ways
.
" i now pronounce you husband
annd wife
.
" sure
, they said that infact the 1800s
.
" entrepreneur
.
" sure
. every bit ofthe male
- ego
- stroking dialogue that wyatt ' s thrid wife speaks to him made me sick to listen tothe it
.
" oh
, hte script was written by two men
?
"
" no kidding
!
" the movie is torture tothe sit through
. thte scenery is boring
. the fades were either ackward or cliche or to self imporatnt
. cant you sday poor editing
? everyone looks ugly in tihs movie
. whn you shoot peopel from under thier chins
, they look liek htey have doulbe chins
. kevin costner has never looked worse
. he shouldnt sue
. he looks like he gained thte 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost
. dennis quaid isnt marvelous
. if yuo have to see this movei jsut for his performance
, go into the theatre at thte movie ' s halfway mark
. doc holliday
( quaid ' s character
) shows uv at baout hte 90
- minute mark
. gene hackman is very good
. is he in the credits
? i don ' t remember seeing his nmae
. mare winningham makes the best ofthe a small role as wyatt ' s second wife
. annabeth gish is ogod as wyatt ' s first wife
. i
though that jamie gertz plyed wyatt ' s third wief
,
bu i later heard that her name isnt joanna going
. she looks grat
but her dialogue sucks
. she also seems way to young for costner
. costner seems way to old for 90
% of this movie
. inwhich his frist scene he is suppoed to be about 19 yeras old
. yeah
, right
. catherine o ' hara
and jobeth williams are always good
and totally wasted here
. this is tjhe worst movie that i hve seen in yeasr
. thte last acation hero was better that this
. go see maverick if you want to see a western
. bullets for dennis quaid ' s performance only
.
