( named hansel
) loves tyhe american music
. one day
, he gets hte opprotunity to meet

. i
.
,
but first
, he must get a sex change
( enter hedwig
)
. once marryied
, the two move to the states
,
but quickly thereafter
, get a divorce
. at tht point
, hedwig starts writing music
and meets another confused boy
, who soon turns into a star
. that boy also turns his back on hedwig
,
and it isn ' t long before hedwig puts toghether his
/ her own band
and tours the states via seafood restarants
. this is yhe story of his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks
adn musical numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy musical with great songs
and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell
, doesn ' t realyl come together as a whole
, witht over
- thte
- top symbolism
, incoherence
and too much pretension tothe retain my interest all the whole way through
. in fact
, this isn ' t so much of a realistic
, articulate
, behind
- tghe
- scenes look at the ries of a rock ' n roll star
, as it is an ambiguous
, overly poetic
and incomprehensible struggle of a man
, his sexuality
annd his identity as a wohle person on this planet
. i guess that i wass expecting tyhe former going in
. the film isnt somewhat intresting to a point
,
but i was personaly never able to envolve myself too much
, as the basic symbolic
and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold
anbd distant
.
but it is definitely tuned tothe a certain type of audience
. chances are that if ytou are a fan of the wall
, tghe rocky horror picture show or even priscilla
, queen ofthe the desert
, the elements tangled infact this movie wiull likely strike your fancy
( smoe of the charactors in thsi film even ask tyhe audience to sing along at some point
,
and provide the lyrics of their song
, on
- screen
)
. well
, i personally don ' t care for those films
,
and didn ' t really get into thge whole
" show
" atmosphere of this movie either
. i guess i might ' ve looked at it all too literally
,
but liuke i said earlier
, i jstu didn ' t care enough about tjhe characters to delve into the
" so the butterfly represents his freedom
?
" side of thigns
. all i know is that the film left me iwth many questions unanswered
and didn ' t make me feel any more fufilled
. what wass hedwig ' s relationship with that other member of his band
( with the beard
)
? what happened with hedwig
and tommy gnosis at the end of tghe movie
?
( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy
?
) what ever happened to the lawsuit
?
and more
.
.
. all of which were part of the film
and interseted me somewhat
. if the only idea behind the film ws forthe hte main character to uncover his
/ her sexuality
,
then that ' s one thign
,
bu as many of the relationships
and situations presented themselves in this movie
, i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well
. i didn ' t get it
. hte film ' s humor also didn ' t tickle my funny bone either
.
then agina
, i ' ve seen many a film in these art
- hous theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter
, hwile all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen
. some of these films are also better enjoyed with yhe added
" atmosphere
" of a plant called marijuana
,
and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains withing itself some nifty visual elements
, inspite order to jazz up that experience
.
but being sober as i was
anbd expecting a coherent
, funny
, muscial with a transsexual twist
, i didn ' t leave tjhe theather very satisfied
. i came out hvaing watched an existential story ofthe a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle
, wrapped in metaphors
, dramatics
and more questions than answers
. i iwll
, on the other hand
, definitely hand some props out to the lead infact htis film
, john cameron mitchell
, who is aslo yhe man who wrote
, directed
and created tje play onthe which this movie is based
,
and the tunes
, which will likely be enjoied by anyone who digs the sex pistols
, david bowie
annd hte hwole 70s glam
- rock scene
. note
: btw
, it seems as
though preety much every single
" mainstream
" critic in tje united states loved this movei from top to bottom
(
anbd thought thast it was raelly funny tothe boot
!
)
, so yuo might watn to tkae that inot consideration yourself
.
but having said that
, the main reason tht i started this dinky website inspite tjhe first place was because films like thsi would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the
" official
" critics
, while i
, a regular
" joblo
" in the audience
, just wouldn ' t git what all hte fuss was about
. this movie is a perfect example ofthe why i continue to write movie reviews
