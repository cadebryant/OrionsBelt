" mission tothe mars
" is one of those annoying movies where
, in tje middle of the movie
, you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because tehy showcased all the best parts ofthe the movie
: all five mintues of it
.
" mission
"
* does
* give you payoff
;
but wehn it doens come
, it ' s too little
, too late
.
" mission
" has some good ideas
,
but htey get lost in the unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
,
and spate ofthe good actors wasted infront cardboard
- cutout roles
. i ' m sure the director
and writers were very proud ofthe each hallmark moent tehy came up iwth
, so tehy stretch earch dramtic moment out liek silly putty until it loses all its charm
. glances don ' t communicate any deeper emotions just becuase you draw them out for five hours on end
. the film spends an hour on thsi kind of stuff
, building to its climax
. a lot of it is a cliched glorification of famaly relationships
, marriage
, friendship
, unite we stand divided we fall kind ofthe crap
. there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film
,
anbd i give it points for trying to stay true to thge science i know
( trying is the key owrd here
)
. the sequence iwth the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautyfull
anbd touching
,
but as mentioned by
then we ' re so sick ofthe tjhe goddamn thing we want the movie tothe be over
. great design
, good intentions
,
but no cigar
. if you ' re nto a die hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o ' connell fan
( his character is yhe only one who has some semblance ofthe charater
)
, don ' t waste your eight bucks on this
.
and what yhe hell
, tim robbins died halfway through the movie
, infact a stupid way too
. that ' s just unforgiveable
.
