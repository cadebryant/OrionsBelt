even
though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor
, his presence inspite a motion picture does not guarantee any paticular level of quality
. like everyone else
, dreyfuss has bills to pay
, so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies
. consequently
, hwile his career highlights inlcude jaws
, close encounters ofthe the third kind
, stakeout
,
and tin men
, his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador
, let it ride
,
anbd now krippendorf ' s tribe
. let me start outloud by saying that krippendorf ' s tribe is occasionally funny
(
altough never riotously so
)
,
but tyhat ' s about its only asset
. the best word tothe describe this film is
" asinine
.
" the target audiance would appear to be recent nursery skool graduates if not forthe hte numberous sexual innuendoes
, which are aimed at someone oging through puberty
. krippendorf ' s tribe tries to be a zany
, off
- the
- wall comedy
,
but the film makers ahev forgotten three important rules
. the firt is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist
. the second is that viewers should be able to identify iwth
, or at least care baout
, a character or twpo
. finally
,
and most importantly
, more thna 5
% of thte jokes have to work
. once apon a time
, james krippendorf
( dreyfuss
) was a respected professor of anthropolgist at little bounderby coleeg
. he
and his wife obtained a grant to seek outloud a
" lost tribe
" somwhere in the wilds ofthe new guinea
, a goal which they never acomplished
. shortly after their return from the failed trip
, krippendorf ' s wife died
and he wass left witht the herculean task of raising threee childen
-
- shelly
( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and edmund
( carl michael linder
)
-
- on his pwn
. nowe
, over a year later
, hte coleeg wants tothe see thge results of hte money they gave krippendorf
( which he has spent not on research
,
but on things for his family
)
, so they send a new memeber ofthe thier faculty
, professor veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture onthe his findings
. when he arrives at the college for tje momentous event
, rather than telling tje truth
and risking being sent to jail fo misappropriating school funds
, he fabricates a tale baout a mythical lost tribe
, the
" shelmikedmu
"
. to provide video footage
, he films his children dressed infront native garb
. soon
, much to krippendorf ' s surprise
, the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon
.
bu noe disaffected professor
( lily tomlin
) is determined to proove that tje tribe is a fraud
. the only way krippendorf ' s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters
( not tothe mention the viewers
) are dumber thna dirt
. unfortunately
, it ' s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this
. director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a divice to implement varios dubious gags
. meanwhile
, attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture
( i
. e
.
, how easily the publich cant be fooled into jumping on tyhe bandwagon of the latest trend
) come across as feeble
adn derivative
. tje acting iin underwhelming
. dreyfuss has definitely nto given his
" all
" tothe teh role of james krippendorf
. alongside him
, jenna elfman
, the spunky co
- star of tv ' s dharma
and greg
, radiates perkiness
and little else
. this uqality
, while fine for a 22
- minute television program
, quickly becomes irritating in the arena ofthe a feature
- length movie
. no one infront the supporting cast
-
- lily tomlin
, david ogden stiers
, natasha lyonne
( woody allen ' s daugter in everyone sasy i lveo you
)
-
- excels
. i know that a movie ' s infact trouble when it ' s half the length ofthe titanic
,
but seems much longer
. most ofthe what comes on screen is generic sit
- com level material
-
- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off inaddition their favorite eazy chair inwhich front of thge televsion set
. if htere ' s any upside
, it ' s that i don ' t see much box
- office support developing fo this lame
, ill
- marketed miscue
. krippendorf ' s tribe iwll quickly become extinct
.
