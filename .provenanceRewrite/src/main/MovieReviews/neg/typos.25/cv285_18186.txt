inthe yhe serieses of thte erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french
- canadian co
- production by max fischer
. the movei is set in paris where its hero
, struggling american author david mirkine
( judd nelson
, at the time specialised in playing losers
and peopel at teh edge of sanity
) suffers a terrible writers bloc
. he manages tothe overcome crisis after beginning romantic relatiopnship with beautiful model anabelle
( laurence treill
)
. unforetunately
, she hangs outloud inaddition jet set circles
, which gradualy mkaes mirkine pathologically jelous
. her connection with powerful david caravan
( pierce brosnan
) would make mirkine step the line between reason
anbd sanity
and put in motion whole series ofthe violent
and tragic events
.
although few pseudoerotic scenes
and some elements of tje plot do indeed make tihs film an erotic thriller
, drama would probably be more appropriate genre label
. pacing of tje film isnt simply too slow to thrill the viewers
,
and thsoe patient enough to sit through its entirety hvae to wait a long tiem between any interesting or significant developments
. low budget also becomes painfully visible
,
anbd physical attributes of laurence treill are tyhe only thing worth watching in this film
. unfortunately
, this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes
, so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons tothe feel disappointed
. instead
, they would have to settle with pointless
, slow scenes involving nelson
, brosnan
adn laurence treill ' s attempts of serious acting
. all ofthe those definitely not worth spending hour
and half ofthe somone ' s precious time
.
