we coudl paraphrase michelle pfieffer ' s character in dangerous minds
and say that beyond rangoon starts with an
" a
.
" that ' s fair enough
. all movies
, liek all school children
, shoud be given the benefit of the doubt
. tghe chance to succeed
. after all
, we like to think that the right combination of talent
anbd effort cin do wonders
. montains cxan be moved
,
and good movies can be made
. yeah right
. children fail
, as dont films
. as does directer john boorman ' s latest
. the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette
( ed wood
, true romance
) as tje busty westerner
- in
- peril wandering baout 1988 burma without a passport
.
though we can stomach tjhe mild plot contrivances that get her there
, it ' s a tougher task to overlook tyhe actress
. she ' s a lightweight
. as the frist scene
( with narration
!
) demonstrates
, she doesn ' t hvea
* nearly
* enough range fo tjhe emotions that her carachter
-
- a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband
annd son
-
- is supposed to show
. she may give a stronger performance than
, say
, keanu reeves in a walk in yhe clouds
, by nto by much
. beyond rangoon isnt a very physically appealing film
, thanks to the practiced craftsmanship ofthe john boorman
( deliverance
, excalibur
, hope
and glory
)
. he keeps the narrative moving
, no matter how muddy the stopry
-
- or the heroine
-
- gets
. why he chose arquette remains a mistery
,
though
. maybe he was thinking tyhat hte dramtic weight of the story woudl overcome any casting deficiencies
.
but even after an hour ofthe half
- stated political statememts
anbd murky massmedia killings
, we
* still
* don ' t know enough of whta ' s happening in this country to fiel distressed forthe the charachters or their situations
. empty exoticism
. the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix
, combining lush jungle photography with bad blue
- screen work
. also odd isnt the obvious dubbing
. done to amke some of the foreign cahracters sound less foreign
?
annd
, isnt it my misteek
, or dont the same extras keep reappearing as differant soldiers
?
? doo doo doo doo
.
