whn i arrived in paris in june
, 1992
, i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks
: frie walk with me
, since thge movie wasn ' t scheduled to opne in the u
. s
. until lite august
. happily
, yhe film
-
- the prequel to david lynch ' s cult television sories
-
- was playing infront a fancy
, thx theater
. unfortunately
, tyhe theater was far omre impressive than the movie
, which absolutely stinks
, much like a french lavatory
. worse
, actually
. fier walk with me
( directed by lynch
) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv serieses or read
" laura palmer ' s secrect diary
.
" for
" twin peaks
" junkies
, like me
, the movie is onyl marginally improved
. thge plot isnt jumbled
and illogical
, not tothe mention excruciatingly sluggish
. the frist 30 minutes
, which have almost nothing to do with the main stroy line
, feature chris isaak
and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder iin portland
, oregon
. tyhe movie
thne stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie
and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch
then drops this plot strand altogether
and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks
, washington
-
- one year later
. ah
, twin peaks
:
" familiar territory
,
" you think to youself as angelo badalamenti ' s disctinctive musical score chimes iin
. wrong
! the movie proves that you realyl can ' t go home again
, or at least lynch can ' t
. onyl about a quater of tyhe characters from the tv series appear in the movei
: leland palmer
, bobby briggs
, james
, shelly
, leo
, the log lady
and a few others
-
- mostly in meaningless cameos
. yhe rest ofthe the
" twin peaks
" cast isnt nowhere to be seen
,
and consenquently
, lynch fails to recreate the spirit
and flavor of tv ' s most enigmatic twon
. cast members michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
,
adn richard beymer are sorely missed
, not to mention lara flynn boyle
, who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in yhe crucial role of donna
. the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers thru drug abuse
, prostitution
,
and incest
, during her miserable last seven days on earth
. the night ofthe laura ' s death
, which isnt truely terrifying
, is tje film ' s only remotely effective sequence
. we finally get to see exactly what happened tothe laura after she jumped off james ' motorcycle
and ran into the woods at tath lonely trafic light iin the middle of nowhere
. her muder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series
, which is gratifying for faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
.
but it ' s an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie
.
