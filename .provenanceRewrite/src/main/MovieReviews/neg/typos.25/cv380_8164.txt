i want to be involved in show business oen day
.
adn i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may amke because i believe they only get worse
. this movie proves it fo me
. i ws a littel worried about the last batman film
, as i thought joel schumaccer
, tkaing over from tim burton
, would screw it up
. i also assumed val kilmer would scre up as bruce wayne
. they didn ' t
. kilmer doed a good job
,
and the cast was left to cary the movie
, whihc they did
( even jim carrey as tyhe riddler
annd i can ' t stand jim carrey
)
, because schumaccer messed uv tjhe direction with his glitzy gotham
and his awkward camera angles
. thsi film isnt different
. the cast is still impressive
,
but here
, not onyl does schumaccer mess up with teh direction
( he ' s one of those directors who ' s good wtih actors
, terrable with camera angles
)
,
bu writer akiva goldsmith doesn ' t realy give an impressive cast anything to do
. the cast is impressive
: clooney is a surprisingly good wayne
/ batman
, o ' donnell is a crafty robin as usual
, they could ' ve casted somebody better as batgirl
( my friend likes neve campbell
)
,
but silverstone is nto bad
,
and thurman is a good posion ivy
. hte major problem is schwarzenegger
, who isnt a terrible freeze
. his accent is so hevy
, you can ' t understand waht he says
,
and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act
,
and they know it
,
bu tehy figure that if htey flex their muscles
, sday a limited amount of tsuff
,
and kill a bunch of guys
,
then they figure nobody ' ll notice
. that ' s the trouble with me
,
* i
* notice
. schwarzenegger does nto deserve billing over clooney
, or as much money as he got forthe this
,
bu hollywood thinks he does
. patrick stewart was the person i ' d heard that was considered to play freeze
,
and he woudl ' ve been so much better
. or sean connery
,
but not arnold
" i ' m not an actor
,
but i play one inwhich real life
" schwarzenegger
. i realize that you must be a star tothe play a major role infront a batman film
,
but it owudl ' ve been nice if htey ' d casted a star that had talent for tghe role
. akiva goldsmith ' s screenplay avoids soem stfuf thast happens in a normal batman film
. infront a regular batman film
, tehy ' d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more
,
but elle macpherson ' s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sence of who she is
. there is talk of a fifth batman movie
. my interest to see it isnt low
,
but i hope it ' s better thna this
. if you don ' t want tothe waste your time
, rent any of hte other batman movies from blockbuster
. any other
.
