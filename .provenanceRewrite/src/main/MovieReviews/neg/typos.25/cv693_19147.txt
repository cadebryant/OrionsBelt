i ahve nothing agains unabashedly romantic films
. when done right
, with at least slightly evident restraint
, they can be engaging
, sweeping
, appealing
.
but it ' s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle
, a hollow
, boring romance thast should appeal onyl to the most gullible ofthe viewers
; tghe ones willing tothe buy inot ephron ' s whiny views of life
and romance
. tom hanks
and meg ryan
, twpo of hollywood ' s most likeable stars play sam baldwin
annd annie reed
, repectively
. baldwin ' s wife recently died
and he moved to seattle wiht his son
, jonah
, seeking to get awya ffrom the familiar surroundings which remind him of his lite spouse
. jonah senses tension
adn calls a talk radio sohw to tell the world about their problems
. sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show
,
but when he gets onthe the phone he begins pouring his heart outloud
. ephron has him do this so that annie reed
( meg ryan
) can hear it
. annie is a happy woman
. she is engaged to walter
, an allergy
- prone wroking man
anbd seems tothe be perfectly content
.
but after hearing sam the widower on the raido show
, she becomes convinced that he is her destiny
and is willing tothe risk her engagment for it
. five yeasr after this movie hit theaters
, hanks
, ryan
and ephron would team up agina in the far better
,
altough still sub
- par romantic comedy yuo ' ve got mail
, which is about people who hate each other inspite real life falling in love onthe thte internet
. at least tht movie hadnt a sense ofthe spontaneity
. here it seems that the first one hundered minutes exsist solely to set up forthe the last five
. the fact that sam
and annie iwll finally meet isnt so excruciatingly obvious that everthing else is perfunctory
. sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers
; ffrom its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman
and rosie o ' donnell
.
but none ofthe them can savve teh film from being a bore
. its charachters are dull
and empty
, its scirpt isn ' t funny or particularly charming
. hte script has a fundametal probelm
: annie gives uv
, for littel reason
, her life wtih walter to pursue
" sleepless in seattle
,
" whom she has never even seen
. it ' s the kind of life decision that real people don ' t make
,
adn its a major
, unforgivable plausibility sacrifice
. in essence
, this movei ' s purpose isnt to head towords a gool that shouldn ' t even exist
. it ' s a ten minute short film with ninety
- five mintues of filler
. if yuo were to show me sleepless in seattle
anbd i didn ' t have to review it
, you could just call me
" asleep in philadelphia
.
