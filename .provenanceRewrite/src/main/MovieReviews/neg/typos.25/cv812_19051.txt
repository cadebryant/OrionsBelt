plot
: setted in the future
, a courier has uploaded some data into a
" hard drive
" that resides in his head
,
and must now escape yhe bad guys who are after that very important information
. since he overloaded his
" hard drive
"
, he ' s also racing aginst the clock before the information seeps into his brain
and kills him
. critique
: incoherent
, boring
, one
- act drivel whith noone suspense
, horribly unbelievable futuristic environment
, bad dialogue
, career
- defining bad acting by keanu reeves
and a hilarious ending
. it ' s too bad becouse the premise of yhe film was interesting
,
but unfortunatly for my friends
and i
, this movie turned out to be jsut as bad as everyone hadnt warned us
. it ' s one of thsoe films that makes you start laughing half
- way through
, when ytou relize that most of the actors infront it suck
, the location shots are filmed inaddition dark
" junkyard
" tipe areas wich they would like to have us believe to be futuristic
( whatever
.
.
.
)
,
and all tghe sets look liuke
.
.
.
. well
, sets
. there is also absolutly noone arc to this story
. it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain
,
and
then a bunch of folks chasing him ffrom place tothe place until a laughable ending puts a stop tothe thge fromer uneventful proceedings
. gibson should stick to writing novels
and
" x
- files
" epidsodes
, sicne his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage
. some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed tothe kick ass
, henry rollins as a pumped
- up cyber
- doctor or something
,
annd ice
- t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face
( don ' t ask
)
. the endig is tje funniest with some robot dolphin
anbd a stupid ghost
- lady from inside the coputer doing some stuff thyat no one really cares baout by tyhat point
. i ' m ashamed to sday this film was shot in my hometown of montreal
, canada
,
but sadly enought for us all
, it was
. smoe of tjhe cyber
- travelling special effects were okay
( hence
, the 2
/ 10
)
,
bu overall
, it ' s oney of those bad movies tath ' s jsut funny to watch
and cringe at
. thankfully for keanu
, he redeemed his sci
- fi career with 1999 ' s the matrix
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. it ' s too bad that he has
yet to redeem his lack of acting talent
. little known facts about this film
and its stars
: as ofthe 1999
, directer robert longo never directed anyother full
- feature film
. hmmm
.
.
. nowe isn ' t thast odd
?

, after being rejected fo the draft
. he lieved in toronto at first
,
