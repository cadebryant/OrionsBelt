inspite the finale of disney ' s
" mighty joe young
,
" a 15
- foot tall
, 2000
- pound gerilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel
anbd plummets tothe the ground
. apon inpact
, rugged everyman
annd perennial do
- gooder bill paxton rushes in
, containing the emotional crowd with an earnest
" move along now folks
, there ' s nothing to see here
.
" ok
, so those aren ' t exactly the words he uses
,
but it ' s probably one of the faw clich
? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies
,
" king kong
.
" 1949 ' s
" mighty joe young
" was an update of that classic creature feature
, also based onthe merian c
. cooper ' s orignal story
( 16 years affter
" ' kong
" it appeared the world was ready forthe a new tkae on the beauty
anbd thte beast fable
)
. now some 49 years later
, at least according to disney ' s way of thinking
, the world is ready for one more
. not so
. teh only
-
-
adn i mean only
-
- reason to see the 1998 version is for yhe speical effects
.
and these
, unfortunately
, run hot
and cold
. todya ' s joe young is designed
and produced by special
- effects whiz rick baker
, who hasnt been wowing audiences with his state
- of
- the
- art make
- up effects since 1971 ' s
" schlock
"
( which
, incidentially
, featured a baker
- enhanced
" gorilla
"
)
. joe is a combination of animatronic effects
, computer graphics
,
annd that ood standard
, a man in a monkey suit
. hwile there are occasional flashes of brilliance
-
- baker ' s had a lot of practice whith simian effects
, after all
, includng
" gorillas infront the mist
,
"
" greystoke
: the legend ofthe tarzan
, lord of tghe apes
,
"
and the 1976 remake of
" king kong
"
-
- there ' s also some surprising cheesiness
. one of tje film ' s most embarrassing moments is when paxton ' s band of african trackers frist encounter
and pursue the larger
- than
- life primate
( inthe a scene unashamedly ripped off from
" the lost world
: jurassic park
"
)
. paxton jubilantly extols the biast ' s majestic gait at tjhe same exact moment as joe
,
adn the computer effects driving him
, stutter to a halt
. also
, if yhe film ' s producers had wanted us tothe focuse our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn ' t have paraded female lead charlize theron
(
" trial
& error
"
) arund inaddition a seemingly
- endless wardrobe of spaghetti
- strapped tops
. even joe seems distracted at times
. the film piles on tyhe clich
? s like ther ' s noone tommorow
, including the predictable plot
( anthro
- zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l
. a
. where urban havoc isnt inevitably wrought
)
, predictable villain
( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace
)
, predictable love stroy
( bill
and charlize
-
- surprise
!
)
,
and predictable denouement
(
" ' twas box
- office receipts that killed the beast
"
)
. kids rised on
" men in black
"
( non
- monkey effects also by baker
) are gonig to find ron
(
" tremors
"
) underwood ' s outing a littel lame by compairison
. while certainly better thna 1978 ' s
" king kong lives
"
( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularily good remake
)
,
" mighty joe young
" proves how the mighty keep falling
.
