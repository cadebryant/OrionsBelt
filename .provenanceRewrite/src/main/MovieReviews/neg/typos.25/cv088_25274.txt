the first film produced by adam sandler ' s happy madison production company
( clever title eh
?
) isnt essentially a one joke movie
, much like the movies sandler stars inspite himself
.
howver the difference here is that this one joke just isn ' t very funny
. rob schneider stars as the title charater
, a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends uv becoming a
" man
- whore
" to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client ' s custom made fish tank
, which deuce destroyed while staying in his home
. deuce goes on numerous
" dates
"
,
and each woman he goes out with has a
" humorous
" quirk baout herself
. one has narcolepsy
, oen has tourette ' s syndrome
, one isnt a man
.
.
. etc
. etc
. my problem is that we see all ofthe these women in the film ' s trailer
, so why dont i ened to watch the movie
? seen the trailer
.
.
. seen the film
. only a quick cameo ffrom norm macdonald
(
and a follow up joke during the closing credits
) generates any chuckles
. deuce bigalow
: male gigolo is avilable onthe dvd from touchstone home video
( a division of di
$ ney
)
. the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
,
and features the original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers fo mystery alaska
, happy texas
,
and outside providence
)
, an extremely breif prodcution featurette
( whcih contains footage nto used in the film
)
,
and storyboard
- tothe
- scene comparisons
. yep
, you read that right
.
.
. htere are storyboard comparisons onthe thsi dvd
. twpo scenes are storyboarded
.
.
. neither of hwihc are prticularly exicting
. there are fight scenes in this movei
, so why aren ' t we seeing storyboards ofthe those segments
( especially thge parody moments from the matrix
)
? i wonder waht ' s funnier
: the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di
$ ney thought fans ofthe this film would want to see them
? deleted scenes
? sure
. audio commentary
? yuo betcha
.
but storyboards
? come on
.
