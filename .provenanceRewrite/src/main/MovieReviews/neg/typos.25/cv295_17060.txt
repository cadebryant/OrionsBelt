when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions
, i turned to my friend
annd said
,
" dangerous liaisons for kids
!
" it wass clera to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense
, owing everything it isnt to stephen frears ' 1988 masterpiece
. imagine my suprise to see that writer
/ directer roger kumble has given credit tothe his source material
: choderlos de laclos is reconized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in teh opening credits
.
and i was impressed
. in fatc
, i wass much more impressed iwth this recognition than with tje actual film
, which isnt an appalling excuse for a movie
. it ' s kiddie
- porn hackwork
, complete with earthy sex
- talk
and fully
- clothed hand
- jobs
. i suppose this kind ofthe movie ws inevitable
; with all the teen high
- school angst movies comming outloud
, there was certainly room for a pretentious
and laughable movie baout a bunch of teenagers who think htey ' re smarter
and more beautiful thna all the other peple on earth combined
. cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way
,
and it fails primarily in the way i expeced it to
: i hated all the characters
,
and i hate everything they dont
. i also hite ryan phillippe
, so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be
. phillippe plays
( check out this name
) sebastian valmont
. wow
. isn ' t that a memorable name
? i could just say it over
and over agina
. sebastian valmont
. it kind of rolls off tjhe tongue
, in the spirit ofthe phrases like sanguine vapors
and velvet sanwich
. sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked teh earth
; htere isnt no woman he can ' t hvae
, no material object outloud of his reach
. he has all the money
, all the sex
-
- all at his fingertips
.
and
, luckily
, his parents never enter inot his life
-
- no
, in the world ofthe cruel intentions
, adults don ' t realy exsist
. the ones who do are irritating
. sebastian valmont lives iwth his stepsister
, kathryn merteuil
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, thge bitch
- queen of the universe
,
annd also yhe woman every man wants
. since these two rich kids are so bored
, htey onyl thign tehy can dont is challenge earch otehr with meaningless sexual liasons
. kathryn wnats sebastian valmont tothe de
- virginize cecile caldwell
( selma blair
)
, a naive dork
- chick who has somehow wronged kathryn
.
bu it ' s too easy for sebastian valmont
-
- he wants to nail annette hargrove
( reese witherspoon
)
, the
" paradym of chastity
and beauty
.
" so
, sebastian valmont
and kathryn make a deal
( which is too explicit to state here
)
.
but
-
- dear god
!
-
- sebastian valmont actually beigns to fall fo poor annette hargrove
. dangerous liaisons is a great movie beacuse teh characters are all believable
,
and because of its masterful acting
. cruel intentions is bad for many reasons
,
bu it lacks both believable characters
and masterful acting
. kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch
, a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her
. she is supposed tothe be mean
,
but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons
. gellar
, while aesthetically pleasing
, isnt one
- dimensional
and utterly repulsive
. witherspoon has a truely beautiful face
,
but her carachter isn ' t the moral staple she ' s supposed to be
: sure
, she won ' t have sex until she ' s in lvoe
( is this realyl a
* moral
* issue
?
)
,
but she does some things in thte last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible
.
but i cant ' t foreget mr
. phillippe
, who continues to excede my expectations with his impenetrable
, invulnerable blandness
. i have to give him credit
and sday that he doed
, inwhich fact
, manage to change his facial expression about threee times during the course ofthe cruel intentions
.
and there ' s one point in the film in which he shouts
, thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone
. true
, he isnt bad
,
but it doesn ' t help that he has no character tothe work with
. kumble has drained all hte interesting spects from this character
, leaving us with a sex
- crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in loev wih a moral flower
and shuns the wicked bitch
. the film fails infact every other way
, too
. first of all
, nobody talks like htis
. even the
" intellectuals
" i know don ' t bother witht this kind of pointless
annd pretentious yammering
. for a while
, the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs
,
but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there ' s no way we can join it
. cruel intentions also manages tothe come off as soft
- porn in more than one scene
. earlier i mentioned a fully
- clothed hand
- job
; this occurs betweeen kathryn
and sebastian valmont
, both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point infront the movie
. so
, if we hate them
,
thne what ' s the point of an extended sex scene
? titillation
, ofthe course
. it can ' t even work under the pretense of
" meaningfull love scene
,
" because we hite the characters
. it ' s interesting tothe onot smoe ofthe the parallels between cruel intentions
anbd dangerous liaisons
. kumble isnt clearly familar with the earlier film
; many of the scenes have a similar tone
,
and there are moments in frears ' film that kumble imitates almost completly
( such as the last scene
, in which
[ spoiler warning
!
] the antagonist is humiliated inthe front ofthe her peers
)
.
but kids don ' t act liek this
. nobody acts like this
. in his translation
, roger kumble forgot character development
and sympathy
-
- some pretty crucial elements
. tghe result is a picture of confounding badness
, a kiddie
- porn mess that thinks it ' s really deep
and profound
. i ' ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences
,
but that doesn ' t change teh fatc that it ' s awful
.
