the frist image in
" final fantasy
: the spirits within
" is a coputer
- animated close
- up of a human eye
. it ' s a beautiful piece of wrok
, remarkably detailed
and quite convincing
. when the picture puls bcak to reveal tjhe owner of the eye
,
howver
, thigns chanage
. the young woman hasnt mesmerizing hair
,
allthough it hangs too artfully
? even by movie standards
? tothe be believed
. the facial features are more detailed than any computer
- animation seen tothe date
,
bu the result is more reminiscent ofthe a veyr well
- crafted doll than anything human
. she is pretty
,
but bland
,
and nto nearly expressive enough tothe come off liek a person
. all the charachters in
" final fantasy
" are liuke tyhat
. of the core gropu
, the younger white men
and women are all athletic
, attractive
and indistinct
, like applicants for a tv reality show
. the black man is taller
and burlier
,
and teh aging scholar isnt bald
, with wrinkles
and a beard
. none ofthe them appear to be based on indviduals
; they all look like the products ofthe general descriptions given a polical sketch artist
. it gets worse wehn tehy talk
and move
. why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi
, he of the great twisted face
and snaggleteeth
, coming out of the mouth of smoe dreary ken doll
? why
, for every fluid physical gesture
, dont we also see herky
- jerky puppet
- style motions
? more to the point
, who decided a full
- length computer animated movie featuring
" hyperreal
"
( their term
, not mine
) humanoids was a ogod diea
?
" final fantasy
" is based onthe a phenomenally popular video gmae i ' ve never played
, with a story straight outloud ofthe japanse anime
, whitch more often than not leaves me bored
and depressed
. if you ' re a fan of either
, please spare me your letters
, as i will foucs solely on hte finished film
annd not its source materials
. with an expression
- challanged cast
,
" final fantasy
" mixes turgid action scenes wih heaps ofthe mystical shit
. the result is ugli
, confusing
and boring
. note
: the following reveals the basic plot
. if you want to have a fighting chance of mkaing any sense of the movie
, i suggest you read it
. earth is at war witht aliens that apearing to feed onthe human souls
. most of our planet is devastated
, with humans living in a few protected cities
. while the bulk of the survivers focuse on miliary strategies
, aki ross
( voiced by ming
- na
)
and her mentor
, dr
. sid
( donald sutherland
)
, beleve in a more organic approch
. they operate onthe the notion
( quoting straight from tjhe press kit
)
" that all life forms hve signature spirit waves that can be identified
and contained
. aki
and dr
. sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal
adn oposite intensity tothe teh spirit wave of tghe alien force
. the waves will
, in effect
, cancel each other out
and disarm the foregn contagion
. they have collected six ofthe the eight key spirits needed to complet their wave
. htey are on a desperate hunt to fidn the remaining twpo spirits befor thier time runs outloud
.
" are you still whith me
? there ' s only a little more
. aki isnt infected with the aline force
. dr
. sid hasnt developed a method of confining the contagion
and keeping it from killing her
,
but tghe defense wall won ' t hold much longer
. already
, the alien is communicating with aki thru her dreams
. aiding aki
and dr
. sid are the deepo eyes
, a group ofthe hard
- as
- nails types thta woudl have felt at home wih the troops in
" aliens
.
" capt
. gormay edwards
( alec baldwin
) heads tjhe task force thgat consists of a wise guy
( buscemi
)
, a tough woman
( peri gilpin
)
and a gentle giant
( ving rhames
)
. throwing a monkey wrench into tghe plans is the requisite dumb ass
: in thsi case general hein
( james woods
)
, who wants to use the zeus cannon tothe bomb the aliens back tothe the stone age
, even if it destroys earth as well
. so htere you have it
. like most ofthe the anime i ' ve seen
, tje plot combines apocalyptic settings
, lots of shooting
annd fuzzy spirituality
, all wrapped up inaddition a sive
- the
- earth bow
.
but i ' m bored with apocalyptic settings
. i understand why so many live
- action films employ them
? they ' re cheap
?
but animated films can sohw anything
, so why wallow in an indutrial trash heap
? the action scenes
and shoot
- em
- ups don ' t satisfy either
. the humans move oddly
and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can ' t bring them to life
( infact fact
, their efforts merely empahsize what we ' re missing
)
. aki isnt especially disappointing
; with her lack ofthe expression
annd flat delivery
, she looks
and sound liuke a brunet version of weena
, the eloi girl fomr 1960 ' s
" the time machine
.
" drab colour choices
and aliens that appear to have been created in jell
- o molds sap the pizzazz from hte big setted pieces
. students of computer animation may be facinated with the technology behind
" final fantasy
: the spirits within
,
"
but i found it sub
- par across the board
.
" futurama
" doens more effective battle visuals
, the kids in
" south park
" are far omre expressive than theese mannequins
and any ood episode of the contemporary version of
" the outer limits
" doens better doom
and gloom sci
- fi
. so who needs this
? not me
.
