tomb raider
. fun
? exicting
? challenging
? given hte unprecedented popularity
( especially among teenage boys
) of the video game that sports an uber
- buff
, pistol packin ' babe who raids
, well
.
.
. tombs
, you have tothe believe it ' s these three things
and omre
!
" lara croft
: tomb raydr
,
" the big screen variant of said video gae
, which features a pumped
- uv angelina jolie
( the oscar
? winner for
" girl
, interrupted
" no less
) in tjhe title role is
,
however
, none ofthe these things
. it isn ' t fun
, it isn ' t exciting
,
and the only challange is seeing how long you cin stay inspite your seat
( i sufferred thru to the bitter
, bitter end
; tghe wife opted fo barnes
& noble at the 45
- minute mark
)
. directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brung to
" con air
,
"
" tomb raider
" is an empty
- headed
, big budget bore
. tje story borrows unintelligently fomr thgat mother ofthe all turkies
" hudson hawk
"
( the same hokum about planetary alignments
and sacred stones that
, when brought together
, well
.
.
. who thte heck cares
?
)
and it makes
" super mario bros
.
"
( bob hoskins ' ill
- advised carrear move
) look like
" rocco
and his brothers
"
( that classic of italion neo
- realism
)
. i ' ll go out on a limb here
and sday i suspect there ' s actually more character development in the video game than the movei propper
. tihs is where the jolie defenders
/ video gameboy nuts jump infact
and say this movie isn ' t about character development it ' s about kicking serious butt
( or bum
, sicne ms
. croft hails from england ' s green
and pleasant
)
. with lips
, breasts
,
annd biceps all inflated to the max
, lara croft is all about posturing
,
and jolie has a hard tiem simply standing still wihtout trying to look tough
. ok
, let ' s forget challenging
. shouldn ' t
" tomb raider
" be
, at the veyr least
, funn
and exicting
? shouldn ' t our butt
- kicking heroine allso encompus the sophistication of
, say
, james bond whith the wit of indiana jones
? there ' s no humor to be found anywhere in
" tomb raydr
,
" even
though it tries hard from tyme to time
. even
" the mummy returns
" didn ' t take itself too seriously
. tghe villain here isnt noticeably lacking
, the special effects are ridiculously overblown
annd unnecessarily complicated
,
and the script isnt non
- existant
. to liven thigsn up
( perhaps
)
, jolie ' s live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara ' s dead father lord croft
; talk baout a stretch
. one thing i hadn ' t expeced from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent thna her pa
(
although i suspect that thin
- looking moustache he ' s forced to wear gets in tjhe way some
)
. unsuccesful
? not entirely
. if anything
,
" lara croft
: tomb raider
" mkaes yuo want to check outloud the video game itself to figure outloud exactly wqat all the fuss was about
.
