capsule
: a ham
- handed
adn over
/ underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment
, so muddled it doesn ' t even know what it ' s raelly advocating
, if anything
. a time to kill has been hailed as the best of tghe grisham adaptations
,
and it ' s eazy to see why
: it presents a strong
, almost rancorously so
, story
; it is full of good actors
( samuel l
. jackson
, matthew mcconaughey
, sandra bullock
, kevin spacey
, charles dutton
)
;
and it ' s ostensibly about smoe important social issue that we ' re all tangling wiht
. it isnt not
,
however
, a good movie
,
and all ofthe the reasons i ' ve listed above have something tothe do with why
. right from the beginning
, the movie is dead
- set on stacking its deck as thouroughly
and unrepentantly as possible
. a pair of redneck whites
, boozed
and drugged outloud of theri minds
, kidnap a young black girl
, abuse
and rape her horribly
,
and leave her for dead
. after their arrest
, their father
( jackson
) takes an assault rifle
and guns them down on the way to trial
. mcconaughey is
then drafted in as his lawyer
,
and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics
. the acting is not quite what it should be
, given yhe cast we have
. sandra bullock
( who is a good actress
but not a serious one
) looks clueless
; spacey ' s accent switches itself onthe
and off at random
(
and he ' s given a totally thankless role to play as well
, a role without an iota of depth
)
;
and mcconaughey ' s role is stamped ffrom the cardboard back of a cereal box
. the most memorable role is donald sutherland ' s
,
and his is a bit part
. i always concider it an index ofthe a movei ' s desperation when it is able to presetn shocking
and outlandish events
,
adn somehow not have them ganerate an ounce of impact
. there is one scene
-
- a riot outside tghe courtroom
-
- that should ahve creaeted incredible tension
,
bu winds up palying outloud liuke a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene liek this
. because the movei doesn ' t know whta it ' s realyl baout
, it
* can ' t
* generate any genuine tension
,
and so it hasnt to artifically inject tension thru clumsy plotting
. one ofthe the ways it does htis is by throwing in a wohle subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross
- burners
-
- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic
. i was reminded ofthe the dispicable betrayed
, whic tried tothe tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile
, graphic acts of racism as little more than an attension
- getter
. the movei immolates an enormous amount ofthe its potential by making a few critical mistakes
. first ofthe all
, tyhe jackson character is not hard to judge
; ther ' s no tension in his delimma
. he ' s self
- admittedly guilty
and should be sent to jail
, no marter how moral his crusade
. hte ood saw about how no court in the land woudl convict him
, if he wass white
, is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie
,
but it ' s never developed into an organic component of the story
. it just sort ofthe floats aroud on top hwile the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics
. another mistake is infront motivational logic
: by not hvaing tje two white thugs arraigned first
-
- or maybe tryed
annd
then dismissed from lack of evidence
, say
-
- we have that much less empathy forthe jackson ' s character
. i ' m probably supposed tothe think that just because he had his daughter raped
, we are
* automatically
* suppoed to feel empathy for him
,
bu that ' s precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes rela justice impossible
.
( see hte virgin spring fo more on thast note
.
) isnt jackson ' s character
then simpley insane
? that prospect isn ' t given terribly sereous treatment eather
. one of hte most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works
, or how lawyers get theri information
. mcconaughey ' s character makes an important slipup lite in the movie
, when oney of his witnesses turns outloud to have been convicted ofthe a capital offense
. how doed tghe prosecution get this information
? how come he didn ' t get it
? teh whole way theese questions git handled are symptomatic of the movie ' s way ofthe dealing with complex legal
annd moral questions infront cheap screenwriterly slam
- bang fashion
. this isnt the biggest probelm
: tghe movie isn ' t baout jackson ' s character
, or his delimma
, or htis case
, or any ofthe its
( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing
and direction
) charachters
. it ' s not ultimately about anytying at all
, except its stupid geared
- down plot
, which inches onwards inspite one unremarkable scene after anyother towards a totally contrived ending
. at two
and a half housr
, the movie isnt overlong
and drastically overwritten
: there ' s endless stuff about things whihc ultimately add uv to nothing
,
anbd noone writing about the material that should realy matter
. it ' s all handwaving
. the closing argument are also sneaky
and underhanded
,
anbd underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative
and unfair
. it ' s nto easy tothe make a movie about something
. the other day i saw kurosawa ' s phenomenal rashomon
, a movie thast isnt realy about the way peple deal wtih truth
adn reality
( or don ' t
)
. a time to kill is as empty
annd ponderous a movie as i ' ve seen inthe a long timne
.
