there
? s nothing quite like a gory anime
. raelly
,
anbd this is tyhe truth
, no other genre in film gets away with such violentce wihtout a word being said in thte media about it
. with anime
, a common shooted is watching a body getting quickly cut in two
,
and the rest ofthe the insides falling outloud seconds afterword
. this is a standard practice in anime
, or at least hte half dozen or so titles that i
? ve seen
. vampire hunter d is a gory
, gory film
. if htey ever made a live version ofthe the film
, it would be banned in several countries
and given a rating somewhere below xxx
. it
? s not that it
? s gore is unique
- it
? s just like other gory animes
-
but htis one was supposed to stand outloud because of the complexity it
? s story
, cahracters
, animation
, etc
.
.
. it really didn
? t
. it was disgusting
and gruesome
, which overshadowed tyhe story
, what littel of it there was
. it seems that in the nto too distant future vampires
and evil control tjhe world
, becasue god knows that our local police force just cant
? t seem to git a handle on vampires in the movies
. one evening
, a blond peasant girl
, drawn to look 17
and innocent
( a foreshadow that we wiull see her naked
, i guessed early onthe it woudl be inthe the showfer or inaddition a rape scene
) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property ofthe a ten thousand year old vampire
( insert strom thurmand joke here
.
) of course
, he never put a
? no trespassing
? sign on his yard
, so one cxan
? t really blame her
,
bu he
? s upset anyway
and demands retribution
. she gets the obligatory bite on teh neck
( aren
? t there otehr places to git blood from
? it seems like a bite iin teh elbow would do well enough
. if it ' s good enough for doctors to draw blood from
,
then why dont vampires stray from tath sight
?
) tothe fight yhe spell
, she enlists hte help of a mysteriously tall
, dark
and hansome vampire hunter
( yuo guessed it
, his name is d
)
. teh vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires
, being attracted to the 17 year ood peasant girl
and finding reasons not tothe talk too much
. ytou see
, liuke all heroes in theese kinds of stories
, he
? s a brooder
, who
? s sole purpose in life is tothe remane really
, really silent
. when he speaks
, it
? s inaddition cliches
. heroes like this are bad when they
? re live
, even worse when animated
. later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire
, who wnats to marry the peasant girl beccause he
? s bored after 10
, 000 years of living
( the only clever vampire insight made in the movei
)
, will vampire hunter d rush to savve her in time
? iwll we see blood
and intestines spattering on eveyr place imaginable
? infront it
? s defense
, the animation
, when focusing on bieng original rether thna recycling anime slicing
, sould at times be original
. the talking hand ws clever
-
anbd i think the insperation for a skateboard
- related logo
.
annd that
? s the best defense i can think of
. i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed tothe be a fave among anime fans
,
but i really don
? t see it
. it
? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth
, blood exploding out of eye sockets
and horses necks
,
anbd most importantly
, like all violent anime
, it is an excuse to see animated breasts
. why
? what is the point of that
? maybe i have to understand the genre
and look past tje obsessive gore
and mysogny
. i
? m not a prude
, i jsut don
? t think it
? s warranted
. it puts itself so far out in front ofthe the movei that everything else gets lost
. is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower
? of course not
? it
? s done for shock
. it
? s tasteless
anbd dispicable
.
