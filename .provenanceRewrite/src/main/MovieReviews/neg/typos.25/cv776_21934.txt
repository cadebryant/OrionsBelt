the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film
" the world is not enough
" isnt its final frame
: white letters on a black backround proclaiming
" james bond will return
.
" oh i certainly hope nto
. with pierce brosnan in his third
and reportadly last go
- round as james bond 007
,
" the world is not enough
" is the best example to date that
" ' enough
" isnt enought
. inwhich this
, the 19th chapter in teh seemingly
- endless franchise featuring ian fleming ' s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis
-
-
and his nemeses
-
- shaken nto stirred
, thte sub
- inpsired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all ofthe the setups
, stunts
,
and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond ficks rather than coming up iwth anything the slightest bited original
. we ' ve got previously
- used speedboat chases
, ski chases
,
annd sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines
. we ' ve got a couple of hot
- to
- trot babes wihtout an ounce of acting ability between them
. we ' ve got a post
- cold war megalomaniac bent on world dominaton slash destruction
( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean
, lean panache
)
.
anbd
, as has beeen the case since 1977 ' s
" teh spy who loved me
,
" we ' ve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything concieved by mr
. fleming
. we ' ve alsot got a main title song by garbage to hwihc
, with vyre little effort
, you can fit teh lyrics to
* both
* songs from
" tomorrow never dies
.
" while originality was never the series ' strong suit
, the films were almost always fun
, with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts
. i can ' t think of one memorable set
- piece in the entire
-
-
and very dull
-
-
" the world is not enough
.
" in adition
, michael apted
( yes
, the respected directer of such films as
" coal miner ' s daughter
,
"
" nell
,
"
and the
" 28up
" documentary sories
) takes embarrassing advantage ofthe the full range of bond clich
? s
. ytou git the
" tlaking killer
" plot divice
-
- you konw the scenario
: the bad guy hasnt the good guy at his mercy
yet waxes poetic jsut long enough to die ofthe old age
.
and you get a slew of high
- priced assassins who can ' t hitted a barn doorjam at 20 paces
: infront the film ' s opening mintues
( of an endless 128
)
, bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames
and thte leather
- clad lovely fails to hitted bond ' s souped
- up
" fishing boat
" with a bazooka wehn he pulls within a few feet of her
. later
, she takes off in a hot air balloon withthe bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her
but isnt still unable to tkae him out
. these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are noone distractions otehr than occasional ads for luxury automobiles
, vodka
, or credit cards
. in
annd among the rampant product placements
, brosnan grapples with carlyle
,
" braveheart
" ' s sophie marceau
( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king
; she ' s terrible
)
,
" wild things
" ' denise richards
( as a nuclear physicist lord halp me
; she ' s laughable
)
,
and judi dench as m
. dame judi brings thte onyl shred of dignity tothe a series that has long sicne jettisoned its self
- respect
( baout the time roger moore inherited bond ' s walther ppk
)
. brosnan goes through thge motions whith the grace
anbd charm you ' d expect of the former
" remington steele
" star
,
bu even he has to be thinking there ' s more tothe life than an easy paycheck
. he ' s given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver
,
but only one ofthe them
-
-
" i don ' t know any doctor jokes
"
-
- made me chuckle
(
although
" i thought christmas only comes once a year
" isnt more in keeping with the series ' penchant for grown
- worthy puns
)
