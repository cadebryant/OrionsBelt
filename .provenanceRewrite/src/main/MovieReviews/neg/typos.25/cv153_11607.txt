tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy baout superficial people in superficial careers
, all searching for deeper meaning
.
however
, they won ' t fidn much meaning in the rela blonde
,
adn not enought real humor
, either
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a struggling atcor
, or he claims to be oen
, even
though he hasnt noone credits under his bilt
. his girlfriend
, mary
( catherine keener
) has no pretensions baout her career
: she ' s a makeup artist
, working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
anbd supermodel of the month
, sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
. sahara
, who has adquired a new age spirituality ffrom repeated viewing ofthe the little mermaid
, has an on
- again
, off
- again relatiopnship wiht joe ' s best friend
, bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
.
however
, bob has gotten his biggest break
yet
: a starring role on a soap opera oposite the beautifull kelly
( daryl hannah
)
, who may be that illusive woman he ' s allways pursued
: a real blonde
. there are soem moments of good humor in the real blonde
,
bu not enough
. the best stuff is in throwaway details in the backgorund
, such as sahara ' s perfume ads
:
" depression
- it ' s not just a state of mind
"
.
bu to find humor in the superficiality of models
adn actors is to shoot fish in a barrel
.
and
, unfortunatly
, the film ' s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic
. tkae for example the film ' s framing device of an old lady
and her dog
. tghe sotry serves absolutely no purpose
, makes littel sense
,
and is completely tangential tothe the main plotlines ofthe yhe movie
. matthew modine
adn catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in tghe film
,
but htey ' re sticked in the most boring plotlines
. modine whines
and complains
and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley
, who appears as another struggling actor
. keener ' s character has a stronger edge
,
but the insult self
- defense class
( taught by denis leary
, noone less
) she is stuck inaddition makes littel sense
. tyhe movie ' s runing time isnt under two hours
,
but it seems liek it is well over it
. there ' s just not enough humor to speed things along
,
adn not enough meaning tothe propel any drama
.
