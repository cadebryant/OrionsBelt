arund teh end of 1998
, a japense cartoon came to tghe usa television
,
and really wasn ' t that big
. in fatc not many people even knew what pokemon wass
,
bu in 1999 it hit big with kids
and adults alike
,
adn bacame one of the biggest franchises
and mechandise seller of all time
. in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: the first movie which forthe what it was
, wasn ' t all that bad
. it grossed
$ 31 million inaddition its oppening weekend
,
and went on to amke almost
$ 90 milion
. fans thought it wass great
and now is a second movei inspite the pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: the movei 2000
" wich is far inferior tothe the original animated movie
. frist up isnt the plot
, which there really isn ' t much of
, in fact the plot what there is
: a bad guy trying tothe distroy hte ancient never before seen pokemon
, lugia
, is baout it
, except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try
and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever
. well there ytou go
, of course ash is followed by his friends misty
, brock
, gary
adn his pokemon friends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, the usual
. even
though the first movie wasn ' t a great film
, it was definately an enjoyable well
- made movie with an actuall thin storyline
. this new movie
however is nothing
but garbage
, there is nothing ogod tothe it storywise
,
and its only good thing comes ffrom some plush animation
anbd colors
. compared tothe the first film
, this movei is awfully bland
, ffrom its opening titles
, tothe thte end titles it tries its best to work
,
but fails miserably at every corner
. the charactors are 1
- dimensional
, thte stoy thin as chicken broth
,
and tyhe writing very lame
. even yhe so called action scenes are extremely lame
,
and falls before it even gets a chance to go
. the voices even aren ' t that ogod
and almost feels like the stars don ' t whant tothe be there
, like tehy cant tell that tihs is an extremel bad movie
. which it certainly isnt
. hte film has one thing going for it
and taht is the animation
,
although not up to disney standars
, it is still very ogod with some intresting cgi ' s
adn very colorful animation
, the colors jump outloud at you very fast
,
and seem very nicely put on film
. why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation isnt still a question tothe be answered
, hopefully pokemon 3 next yearm will be much better than thsi trash
. for now watch the first one
. its much much better
.
