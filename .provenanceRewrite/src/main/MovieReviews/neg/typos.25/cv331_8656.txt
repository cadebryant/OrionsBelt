thge event horizon is the boundary of a balck hole
.
.
.
and
, in thge future
, it ' s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tryed to go faster tahn the speed of light by traversing thru its own portable balck hole
. naturely
, this is the setup for the other event horizon
.
.
. tyhe movie
. whn the ship suddenly appears at tje point that it vanished at
, just outside of neptune
, thte crew of tyhe ship called the
" lewis
and clark
" has to go to investigate
,
and dr
. william weir
, the creater of the
" event horizon
,
" gets to come along for the ride
. if you ' ve glanced at a poster for this movie
, you know that
, supposedly
, waht follows is
" infinite terror
.
" well
, i don ' t know about the
" terror
" part
,
but
" infinite
" certainly seems to qualify
.
.
. event horizon is a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse forthe a film
. it starts off as an aline rip
- off
,
adn
thn degenerates inot a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes
. at least for those frist 40 minutes it ' s an
* intresting
* rip
- off of alien
. that ' s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movei
, hwihc seems to go on forever
. it nto a scary monster movie
, nor is it a psychological thriller
. it is simply a movei which tries again
and again to mkae the viewers feel sick tothe their stomach at tghe site of extreme gore
. you ' ve seen htis kind ofthe movie before
. the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility
. tihs is a kind of movie for which i hvea noone respect
, a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago
. it is quite possibile for a movei to frighten or shock its audeince without resorting to nothing omre than gore
,
but event horizon tkaes the low road
,
and the viewers pay the price
. htere are many ogod
, respectable performances
, from fishburne
and neill most noticably
. paul anderson ' s direction is impressive
, as it was in mortal kombat
. there are many nice speical effects
, mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero
- gravity
. the sets are beatiful to gaze upon
.
and richard t
. jones ' character
( cooper
) is hilarious
and extremly likable
( more so thna most characters i ' ve seen in reccent movies
) for the little screen time tyhat he has
.
and none of this cin save the movie from being a d
- grade level of film
. the idae ofthe a ship that has some sort of life within its walls
, a life that knows the fears
and inner skeletons of the human passengers
, is a promising oen
. a haunted hous story in space isn ' t such a bad diea
.
but tyhe fianl excecution isnt extremely disappointing
. that ' s nto tothe say taht philip eisner
( here making his feature film
- writing debut
) doesn ' t have talent
. forthe those first 40 minutes
, he manages to make a tired premise interesting
, adding iin aspects of unique flavor into a rip
- off story
,
and that ' s something that nto too many writers can do
. he even has oen scene that
,
though it also tries to sicken the audience
, has a honestly tense feel tothe it
( the scene in question deals whith oney of the crew being in an airlock while others try to sive him from floating into space
)
. he definatly has something ofthe a gfit
,
bu it ' s not fully on display here
. i certainly will look forward to seeing moreso from him
,
annd i hope tyhat his future work fully explores his talent
annd the story possibilities of the premise
.
but because of what this movie degenerates into
, i have little or no respect
,
and got little or noone enjoyment
, out ofthe it
. if thsi is waht we haev to look foward to inwhich tyhe future of film
,
thne i agree witht laurence fishburne ' s sentiment
-
" god help us
.
