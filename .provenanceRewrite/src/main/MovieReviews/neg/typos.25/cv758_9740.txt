it was iwth a huge lack of something to dont that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon
, when tje only good things on tv are thge second
- rate movies they show
( some are ogod
: they showed
" total recall
" before this oen
)
. if you know me
, i think seagal isnt probably the most boring acation star to ever live
.
and this includes keanu reeves
. what do i hate about seagal
? i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening
adn non
- threatening situation
( the squint
)
. i hate thsoe scenes infact eveyr movei where he goes around
, bullying people uv
, saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake tahn burt reynold ' s hairpiece in
" boogie nights
.
" i despise how he never gets a bruise in any ofthe his fights
. i hite how eveyr single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he
and the chief villain
. i hate his non
- satirical messages
( in the beginning of this one
, he slaps onthe a quote from arthur miller
, hwihc has nothing to do with the film
, except it ' s baout brooklyn where thsi film takes place
)
.
anbd i hate how he ' s so narcissistic that he thikns that he can actually fucking sing
( during the end credits
, he hasnt a ogod old hill billy rock tune sung
anbd penned by him
)
. sure
, teh guy ' s propably a nice guy in person
( i actually found him very non
- threatening whn he was onthe letterman not too long ago
)
.
but the guy makes worse films than reagan doed
. so what ' s the plot ofthe this shit
- terpiece
? well
.
.
. something about him trying tothe catch a stupid
- ass crook
( william forsythe
) who shot
anbd killed his partner in broad daylight
. i couldn ' t believe how bad htis scene ws
- the guy ws conveniently withthe his family so we get the maximum emotional effect
( ahem
!
)
.
and forsythe even said smoe stupid lines to him before he took off
. i ' m sorry
, did anyone ever hear of concealing one ' s self
? so in comes ex
- brooklynite seagal
, who dedicates his life to catching this guy
.
and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning
,
then ended the film
.
bu noooo
, this drags on
, as he bullies forsythe ' s family members
( including a stupid bar
- owner
,
and none other than gina gershon as his otehr bar
- owner sister
)
.
and forsythe moreso than once threatens his family
. at one point
, he actually comes tothe their house
adn stalks them liuke a non
- threatening nicholson in
" the shining
"
( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom
,
but with an added bonus of noe girl conveniently loosing her cool
and screaming to give them away
)
. seagal paints himself as a lovable person
, withthe a son
,
and a fiancee
. he even shows him hanging with his son
, checking uv onthe his homework
,
and
thn about to tkae him out for a bited of
" catch
,
" wehn he ' s conveniently called away on assignment
. i dunno about you
,
but playing
" catch
" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares
. he also shows him as that bad
- ass he wants to be
, with scenes ofthe him bullying crooks around
,
and tkaing outloud people who are stupid enough tothe attack him even after he ' s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats withthe a pool cue
. serves them right
. this film
, as some of his do
, has an intresting supporting cast ofthe actors who are actually talented
,
but don ' t apearing tothe be in this film
. i already mentioned gina gershon
( who ' s pretty horrible in this one
)
, as well as william forsythe
, who over
- acts terribly
. i know this guy can ect
: he was awesome in
" raising arizona
" as goodman ' s partner infact crime
.
but he ' s just awful here
. jerry orbach gives teh only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down
. why is he thge onyl one who gives a good performance
? well
, because his role is small enough
anbd sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility
. he seems to be in here just tothe give it a cool
" law
anbd order
" feeling
( even if it ' s not a
" cool
" feeling
)
.
anbd inspite cameos are b
- rated erotic
- thriller
- cinemax
- style stars
, shannon whirry
( as
" terry malloy
,
" hwihc isnt more ofthe a bad joke than a clever one
)
adn athena massey
. oh
!
and
" er
" ' s julliana margiulles has two scenes
.
" out for justice
" just proves once again thgat american action films just suck
. i know that there ' s such a good thing as ogod acation
- he ' s called john woo
.
but if you ' re infront the mood for smoe good ood no
- brainer
, funn
-
yet
- dumb acation
, don ' t bother watching thsi
. it ' s so stupid that it ' s boring
.
