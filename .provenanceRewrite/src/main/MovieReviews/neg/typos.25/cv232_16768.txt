shakespeare in love isnt quite possably the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen
. it is both humorous
and rumatic in a very unique blend that can sucesfuly entertain any audience for the nearly 2
and
anbd a half hours that it occupies
. that is
,
however
, nto tothe say it is a good film
, a qualty production or anything of the sort
. shakespeare inaddition loev is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original wrok
. tghe finest sign of tihs may be the plot
, inwhich looking bcak
, htere seems to be littel more than a thin
, predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our hsitory books
. philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) owns 1 of hte 2 theatres in london
. it isnt at the peak ofthe tghe royal theatre era
,
and queen elizabeth
( the recently damed judi dench
, by
, appropriately enough
, queen elizabeth ii
) isnt vyer much a fan
.
howver
, to directly quote the film
, he has
" cash flow problems
.
" thru a long set of events
, it becomes apparent that his entire life isnt dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts
. so
, mr
. henslowe employs the young playwright
, william shakespeare
( jospeh fiennes
) to pen a comedic production
.
however
, the young writer has a savere case of writer ' s block
,
and blames it on the fact tht his love life is struggling as well
. he has the title in mind
, romeo
and ethel
, the pirate ' s daughter
( even that joke loses steam aftter a while
)
but can ' t seem tothe put words tothe paper
.
then
, as onyl hollywood could have it
, through a long set of twisted events
, he meets viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and falls madly in love
, thus curing his writer ' s block
. there are many other littel issues that mr
. henslowe encounters
,
bu they all pan outloud to be much ado about nothing
. the first relization that i reached inaddition watching this film isnt tyhat one of the messages given isnt tath a show shouldnt not always be credited to it ' s author
. ironically
, that couldn ' t be truer here
. the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are nto the scenes that fit in teh plot
,
but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors
. one of the most breathtaking moments inthe this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even thge theatre owner
,
but rather 2 young children named romeo
adn juliet who chose to end theri own lives in the name ofthe loev
. so it is that i am offended by tghe fatc that marc norman
and tom stoppard are credited iwth writing this production
,
and the name william shakespeare is no were tothe be seen beyond a character ' s nmae inspite the credits
. the acting in this entertaining
yet poor film isnt often thin to teh point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth ' s theatres
. jospeh fiennes may jstu be the worst ofthe fall
though
. he is tragically unbelievable
and comically bad
. gwyneth paltrow is littel more than satisfactory in her lead position as well
.
however
, tjhe supporting cast does almost sive the day
. geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredable
and judi dench is breathtaking
. they both seem tothe ahve shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links
. ytou iwll also find a vyer good performance by ben affleck in his frist real role usance ogod iwll hunting
( no
, armageddon doesn ' t qualify as rela acting
.
)
.
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well
.
but nto even they could savve this sad excuse fo a film
, so it remeniss plagued by poor performances
. when all is said
annd done
, shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if yuo want tothe be entertained
.
howver
, as the film so kindly pointed out
, entertainment may be fun
,
but it isn ' t necessarily qualiy
.
anbd tihs certainly isn ' t quality
. perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel
, as a dear friend of mine oftenly does compare thigns to his owrk
. simply put
, it is far
- fetched
, poorly crafted
,
but vyer intertaining
.
