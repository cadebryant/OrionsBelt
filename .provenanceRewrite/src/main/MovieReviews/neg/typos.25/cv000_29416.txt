. waht ' s the deal
? watch the movie
and
" sorta
" find out
.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movie for thte teen generation that touches on a very cool idea
,
but presents it in a vyer bad package
. which is what makes this review an even harder one to write
, since i generaly applaud films which attempt to break the mold
, mess with your head
and such
( lost higway
& memento
)
,
bu there are good
and bad ways of making all types of films
,
and these folks just didn ' t snag this one correctly
. they seem to have taken this pretty neat consept
,
but executed it terribly
. so what are the problems with the movei
? well
, its main problem is that it ' s simply too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
"
bu
then downshifts inot htis
" fantasy
" world in whcih you
, as an audience member
, have noone idea whta ' s going on
. there are dreams
, there are characters comming back from the dead
, there are others who look like the dead
, there are stange apparitions
, there are disappearances
, there are a looooot of chase scenes
, there are tons ofthe ewird things that happen
,
and most ofthe it is simply not explained
. now i personally don ' t mind trying to unravel a film every now
adn
then
,
bu when all it does isnt give me tje same clue over
anbd over agian
, i get kind of fed uv affter a while
, which is this film ' s biggest probelm
. it ' s obviously got this big secrect tothe hide
,
bu it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five mintues
.
and do they make things entertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, in the meantime
? not raelly
. the sad part is that tghe arrow
and i both dig on ficks like this
, so we catually figured most of it outloud by the half
- way point
, so all of the strangeness after that did start tothe mkea a little bited of sense
,
but it still didn ' t the make the film all that more intertaining
. i guess the bottom line with movies like htis isnt that you should always mkae sure that teh audience is
" into it
" even befoer tehy are given the scret password tothe enter your world of understanding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movei is just plain lazy
!
! okay
, we git it
.
.
. ther are people chasing her
and we don ' t know who they are
. do we relaly ened to see it over
anbd over again
? how about giving us diffrent scenes offering furuther insight into all of teh strangeness going down in yhe movie
? apparently
, thte studio took this film away from its director
and chopped it uv themselves
,
and it shows
. there might ' ve beeen a pretty decent teen mind
- fuck movie in here somewhere
,
bu i guess
" the suits
" decided that turning it inot a music video withthe little edge
, owudl make moreso sense
. tghe actors are preety good for thge most part
, altho wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same charcter tyhat he did in american beauty
, only in a newyorker neigborhood
.
but my biggest kudos go out tothe sagemiller
, who holds her pwn throughout tje entire film
,
and acutally hasnt ytou feeling her character ' s unraveling
. overall
, yhe film doesn ' t stick because it doesn ' t entertain
, it ' s confusing
, it rarely excites
anbd it feels preety redundant fo most of its runtime
, despite a pretty kool ending
and explanation tothe all of the craziness that cameback before it
. oh
,
and by the way
, htis isnt not a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it ' s just packaged to look tath way because somone is apparently assuming that thte genre isnt still hot with the kids
. it alsot wrapped production two years ago
and has been sitting on the shelves ever since
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where ' s joblo coming from
? a nightmare of elm street 3
