" snake eyes
" is the most aggravating kind ofthe movei
: the kind that shows so much potential
then becomes unbelievably disappointing
. it ' s not just because this isnt a brian depalma film
,
and sicne he ' s a great director
and one who ' s films are alwasy greeted wih at least some fanfare
.
adn it ' s not even because thsi was a film starring nicolas cage
and since he gives a brauvara performance
, this film is hardly worth his talents
. it ' s worse tahn that
. it ' s aggravating fo the sole reason that its story could be so much more
, coudl be totally intelligent
,
adn it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly
and intensely
.
.
.
hten at oney point in the movie makes on wrong turn tyhat leads it tothe the hall ofthe fame ofthe half
- assedness
. or more deservedly
, the hall ofthe fame of the eighth
- assedness
. in ceratin circles
,
" snake eyes
" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version ofthe kurosawa ' s classic
" rashomon
,
" where a crime is told from the four different
(
and i mean differant
) perspectives
,
and it looks as
though it may actually be just like thsi whith the opening
, which
, i might add
, is superb
. inthe one very very very long steadicam shot
, we meet the protagonist
, crooked atlantic city detective
, rick santoro
( cage
)
,
adn follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wief
, interupts a pay
- per
- view event on tv
, chases down a gambler
, enters the arena all pumped up for the fight
, sits down
and talks with his bud
, kevin dunne
( gary sinise
, who ' s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn
, who ' s allso in this
)
,
adn watches as it happens
. there ' s a big name in the crowd
,
and that ' s thte secratary of defense
, charles kirkland
( joel fabiani
)
, who ' s sitting behind rick
,
and who gets shot a second aftter the heavyweight champion
, lincoln tyler
( stan shaw
)
, is knocked out
. tihs all happens in the oppening shooted
,
and it creates so many red herrings
anbd possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination
and total deconstruction
. what really happened
, this film asks
,
and it sets this film uv extremely well forthe when rick begins tothe question peple
and get diferent perspectives on the scene
.
.
.
and discovers there ' s a vyre good possiblilty it was a conspiracy
. as we follow rick trying tothe learn of more information
, we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland befor he was shooted
( carla gugino
)
,
and who flees the scene in a panic
,
and tries to hide from the cops inaddition the arena
and the adjacent casino
/ hotel since the cops have blocked off tyhe doors so they can get witness ' takes on what happened
. this isnt all goign pretty fine
and dandy
,
anbd it ' s extremely interesting to watch
.
.
.
thn it takes one wrong step
. we follow tyhe wrong charactor
,
annd we learn of tje answer to the mystery too early on
,
and way before rick cant find it out
.
but that ' s nto the worst part ofthe it
: it ' s that it ' s teh oen person yuo didn ' t htink it would be becuase he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring
, tjhe one you didn ' t think did it beccause it would be stupid
adn cliched ofthe taht person to be behind it
. it only gets worse
: the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film
,
adn since we already know what happened
, we cin ' t rely on rick ' s investigation to be all that intresting
. it ' s as if the film ran out ofthe the guts tothe be really complex
and original baout a third of teh way inwhich
,
and decided tothe just fall bakc on an eazy way out
,
annd that just happens to mean thgat it has to become less
and less credible
. events become more
and more proposterous
,
and by tjhe end
, the film has decided to rely on tje worst offender in mysteries like htis
: the deux ex machina
. that ' s where soem outside intereference brings the film tothe a sudden conclusion
and makes everything okay
. thsi tiem
, it ' s a hurricane
, an out
- of
- control police car
,
and a big round ball that adorned the arena
. what went wrong
? depalma
and the screenwrighter
, david koepp
, are extremely credible people in their respective fields
,
and have been known for bringing life
and complexity to mysteries such as this
. depalma
, who idolizes hitchcock to death
, hasnt done many a film like this
, such as his masterpiece
,
" blow outloud
,
" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece
.
bu granted
, depalma at least makes it intriguing tothe watch
, what wih his over
- the
- top shot setted
- ups
, notably the beginning
and a sequence where the camera pans over top ofthe a bunch of rooms iin hte hotel
, forgetting anything about boundaries
. at least his direction makes up partly for it
.
then there ' s koepp
, who showed such great abilty at making a character ' s flaws come to life like he doed in depalma ' s ealier
" carlito ' s way
,
" a film thgat dove right into the life
and past of its character
and examined him extremely well
. he can write a flawed character
,
but his rick santoro seems to be jstu a half
- assed effort
. he ' s flawed
,
and we can see redemption if the story wasn ' t so formulaic
. a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup
. he may as well have said the opposite of wqat he says
; it woudl have at least gone with what thte charachter wass like
. this is thge most disapointing kind of film because it promises intelligence
and complexity
, because it promises disection ofthe a flawed character
adn perheaps even redemption
,
then pulls the rug from under us just as we weere baout to be convinced it would be able to go all thge way
. as i was watching the first half hour
, i couldn ' t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed
, how many different perspectives he ' d be given
,
annd perhaps he ' d have to make a choice between who ' s he hasnt to believe
. nowe there ' s a film
. unfortunately
, the film has two major deux ex machinas
: one in the disasterous ending
; teh other
, about a half hour in wehn the film goes inot autopilot
annd becomes a stale
and recycled piece ofthe crap we ' ve seen all too much before
,
but never from someone like depalma
.
