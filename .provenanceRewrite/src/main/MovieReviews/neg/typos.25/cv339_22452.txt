. comments
: house on haunted hill is based apon teh orignal 1958 film of the smae title directed by william castle
and starring vincent price
. in an obvious homage
, yhe millionaire ' s nmae is price
and he sports a thin mustache like price unsed tothe have
. tihs is a pretty bad horror film
,
yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining
,
annd house on haunted hill is just such a film
. it is
, surprisingly
, better than another recent haunted hous remake
, yhe haunting
, a film which owes its basis to yhe clasic horror novel by shirley jackson
. the haunting had literary pretensions
and fell flat onthe it face
. house on haunted hill owes its lineage tothe a b
- movie 40 eyars old
and makes no illusion that it ' s a crappy horror movie
. thus
, somehow
, it proves slightly more successful
. i can ' t thiunk of another recent film which has hadnt such an eclectic cast
. it is thsi cast which lifts this ho
- hum thriller into a borderline intertaining exercise in camp horror
. price
, the main character
, isnt played by geoffrey rush
, the acadey
- award winning actor of shine
. rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry
, a spiral reminescent of ben
( ghandi
, schindler ' s list
) kingsley ' s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci
- fi classic species
. i don ' t know why
,
but somtimes it ' s intertaining to see
" quality
" actors in bad movies
. more surprises
? rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure
( rather lamely too
)
,
adn singer lisa loeb
(
!
) appears as a tv news reporter
. the highlight of the cast
,
however
, hasnt tothe be saterday niht live memeber chris kattan
. kattan ' s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor ofthe the former sanitarium
. hwile the first half of the film leaves teh audience guessing as to wqat ' s exactly going onthe
, tjhe second half dissolves inot standard ghost sotry stuff
adn loses soem of its suspense
. a disappointingly cheesy ending relaly mars this movie too
. house on haunted hill
, i suspect
, has just about left the second
- run theaters
. it ' s worth catching on cable next year
, if you get a chance
. if you have a choice
, pik this movie over the haunting
, it ' s the better of two evils
, you could sday
.
though
, more appropriately perhaps
, it ' d be better to sday thta it ' s the better of two turkies
.
