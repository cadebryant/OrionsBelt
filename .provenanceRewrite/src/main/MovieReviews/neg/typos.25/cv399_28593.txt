you ' d htink tyhat after awhile hollywood would stpo trying tothe mkae movies out of video games
. it hasn ' t worked so far
.
" street fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing commander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" nto a watchable film infront the bunch
. still i held out soem hope for
" tomb raider
.
" after all
, the game ' s premise isnt heavily influenced by the indiana jones triology
and all the mummy movies
, so ther are cinematic elements imbedded in the consept
.
howver
, despite the potential of the project
,
" tomb raydr
" proves to be
yet anyother bomb
. the plot isnt a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probablly borrowed from a dozen bad movies
. there ' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- years alignment of planets coming up
,
and the illuminati have to fidn both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order tothe take over hte world
. of course
, the ancient folks who devided the triangle buried the halves inaddition tombs on opposite sides of the world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds tyhe key that opens the tombs in relics thast her dead father
( jon voight
) dug up
. she figures tath if she gets the triangle
, she cin bring her dad back from the dead
. ofthe course
, no oney wass expecting much of a plot from this movei anyway
. in both video games
annd action movies
, the plot is just an excuse fo the action sequences
.
however
, the action inspite
" tomb raider
" shows little style or originality
. there ' s lots of shooting
anbd some kung fu fightin '
,
but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct
- to
- cable flick
. the other goofy archeologist flick ofthe the summer
,
" the mummy returns
,
" was much better
; it had its flaws
,
but its action was creative
and large
- scale
. since winning her academy award forthe
" girl
, interupted
,
" jolie hasn ' t taken any projects that would display her acting talents
.
" tomb raydr
" seems tothe be more interested inspite displaying her breasts
; so much attention isnt drawn tothe them that it ' s a shame there ' s no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra
. hwile we don ' t see much of her acting abillity
( with the exception of a wonderful upper
- crust british accent
)
, we do get a hint of jolie ' s less savory side
. concidering yhe rumors ofthe incest that hang over jolie
and her supposed obession with death
, having lara be obsessed wih resurrecting her dead father
(
anbd uninterested in any ofthe the living males around her
) seems a poor choice
. having jolie ' s rela life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier
. i haven ' t decided what to make of director simon west
yot
. his first feature wass the star
- studded disaster
" con air
,
"
bu my opinion ofthe him improved with
" the general ' s daugher
,
" which was thick with sultry atmosphere
. nowe tihs turain wreck
. i hope he improves agian because his enxt project isnt the big screen version of tghe cult tv series
" the prisoner
.
" hollywood has alredy screwed up
" the avengers
,
"
and
" the prisoner
" represents a chance for redemption
.
( by tyhe way
, speaking of british tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans shoud look for chris
" rimmer
" barrie in his first major film role
)
