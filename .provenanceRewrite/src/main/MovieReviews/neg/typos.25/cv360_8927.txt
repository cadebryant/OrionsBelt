capsule
: dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes
,
adn now something ofthe a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones
. basic instinct ' s worst crime is that it ' s not just a bad movie
,
but in many ways
, an incompetent one as well
. it ' s stupid in itself
,
and stupid to think its audiance isnt as stupid as it is
. it ' s supposed tothe be a thriller
,
bu the plot isnt dead on its feet
,
and ultimately arbitrary
; it ' s only put into the movei to jerk us arund
. it ' s also supposed to be sexy
,
bu it ' s instade got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures
. it ' s a ripoff
. hte story opens with a rock star being murdered while inaddition the throes of orgasm
. the biggest suspect is an authoress
, catherine tramell
( sharon stone
)
, who wrote a novel in whcih the murder was eerily presaged
. or maybe it ' s the work of a copycat
? these
and other plot threads get fed to the detective who ' s onthe the case
( michael douglas
)
, who hasnt a few problems himself
. like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor
. we can measure with a stopwatch the tyme from them setting eyes on each other to the moment tehy are doing the mattress dance
. joe eszterhas has written thte screenplay
,
and he uses a device thgat he used before in the much better jagged edge
: the killer ' s idenity is kept a secrt until the movei ' s final shot
. htis isn ' t inthe itself a problem
-
- the problem is that up until that point
, we ' ve been given nothing to work with
. every clue in the movie
-
- every clue
-
- is ambiguous
. the whole thriller aspect ofthe the movei is a shill
. red herrings
, dead plot threads
, violence
,
annd kinky sexuality litter tghe movie liuke potholes in manhattan streets
. htey add up to zip
, because they ' re nto happening to people we care baout
. douglas ' s charactor is foulmouthed
adn bitter
anbd that ' s it
; stone ' s charater hasnt an iron
- onthe smile that never changes
; tyhe rest are forgettable
. wehn we don ' t even have tjhe luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie
, who cares what happens in it
? especially wiht an endig that is not onyl unsatisfying
,
but in many ways inexplicable
?
( a firend of mine once came uv with a rule of thumb about movie characters
:
" if no oen in the movei behaves like anyone you know
, or would
* care
* to know
, jsut leave
!
"
) oney of the nastier things about the movie is teh way it treats lesbianism nto as an integral part ofthe someone ' s life
,
but as a kind of kink
-
- something tothe thrill men whith
. i despair whenever i encounter htis kind of stupidity in mainstream enteratinment
; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way tothe include something like that in a big
- budget hollywood film isnt as a hefnerism
?
