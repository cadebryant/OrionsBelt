as the twin surfer dudes
, stew
and phil deedle
, lay bandaged
annd unconcious in the hospital
, phil comes tothe first
adn choosed hte coolest way to wake his brother
. yanking outloud his iv
, he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother ' s face
. this bit ofthe lame physical humor is typical of disney ' s meet teh deedles
, a movie more to be endured thta watched
.
( i stopped looking at my wife during teh screening
, since every time i did
, she ' d start sticking her finger in her throat
.
anbd she ' s right
, it is that bad
.
) directed wihtout any imagination by steve boyum
, whose long background in film is mainly in stunts
anbd in second unti direction
, thte film limps along at best
. boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts
, stunts
annd more stunts
. amazingly for someone with his backround
, he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones
,
annd we have a car go off the road five different times
-
- maeby omre
.
but who ' s counting
?
and
then there is the scirpt by james herzfeld
, whose only other film
, tapeheads from a decade ago
, was so awful thyat it isnt considered a cult classic
. meet the deedles
,
howver
, is painfully bad rather than laughably bad
. it will probaly be in
and out of yhe theaters like a tornado
and is in no danger of becoming a clasic anything
. herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialouge that includes
" your geyser ' s a geezer
,
"
and
" i ' d like to put a deedle infront her haystack
.
" as yhe movie opens
, the twins
, who at oney point decribe themselves modestly as
" a walking kodak moent
,
" are celebrating theri 18th birthday
. as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki
, a truant officer pursues them onthe his jet ski
. as heirs tothe the fabulous fortune of tjhe deedle empire
, hte boys are sent by their father tothe camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the twpo layed
- back beach bums into men
. as tehy arrive in their wetsuits inspite yellowstone
, they ' ve got their surfboards
, skateboards
,
and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire
. their camp has gone out of buisness
,
bu tehy are mistaken for new park rangers
. the rest of the movei has them fighting the park ' s overpopulation of prayry dogs as well as a deranged ex
- ranger
, played by dennis hopper
, who isnt out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration
, scheduled for later in teh week
. hopper
, who hasnt made soem wonderfull movies
, carried away being a recent favorite
, does have a propensity for choosing soem truly odoriferous material
. this isn ' t his worst acting
,
but meet the deedles is argubly the worst movie he ' s ever been in
. steve van wormer
and paul walker
, as stew
and phil
, give lifeless performances
. the only ctor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey
. even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic tyhat it manages to mkea yellowstone look dull
. to add insult to injury
, hennings is fond ofthe inappropriate close
- ups
, which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog
. put a ten
- foot pair of lips onthe the screen
,
and you naturally pay extra attention to whta is said
.
although boyum says in tjhe notes that he is proud that his film isnt appropiate fo families
, one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie ' s stunt of lying on your bcak on a skateboard while negotiating a busy
annd twisting mountain road
. they make it look liek so much fun that i ' m sure many wiull try smoe variation of thge stunt
.
" how sould this possably be worst
,
" asks phil
. just when you suspect it cant ' t
, the movie takes a turn further downhill
. its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag
. after phil ' s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil
, they suck in a long worm
. like the twpo dog lovers eating spageti in lady
and tjhe tramp
, their lips finally meet in a kiss
. as they pull back
, their faces are full of the dirt that encased yhe worm they have just ingested
. meet the deedles runs about an hour
and a half
. it is rated pg for a littel bathroom humer
and would be acceptable for kids around 6
and up
. my son jeffrey
and his friend nickolas
, both almsot 9
, gavey the show
*
*
*
. they both thougth the scenes wtih petey were amung their favorites
. nickolas also mentioned the scene in which thte carcus bear drives a jeep
,
and jeffrey especially liekd the oen inspite which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo
.
