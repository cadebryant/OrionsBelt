these dyas tghe lack ofthe originality in hollywood reflects itself in yhe deluge of remakes
.
but
, only a faw years ago
, before wes craven publicly made fun ofthe the practice
, sequels had been more popular amonth hollywood producers
. sequels also used to be popular among directors
and movie stars whose careers went south
. the way tothe regain popularity
and prestige
, htey thought
, was the use the smae formulas
, characters
and story lines that brought them success in hte first place
. one of such celebrity was eddie murphy
, black comedian of 1980s whose carreer was iin big decline durring the frist part ofthe this decade
. inaddition order to return to the spotlight
, he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film
, beverly hills cop
, 1984 action comedy tath had already spawned the sequel inwhich 1987
. seven years later
, fo the thrid instalment
, he used the directorial service of john landis
, another fading star
, whith whom he successfully collaborated twice
- in trading places
and coming to america
. this time
,
howver
, thrid time wasn ' t the charm
and beverly hills iii was failure
. eddie murphy hadnt to wait few more yeras for real comeback
. eddie murphy here plays axel foley
, fast
- talking streetwise detroit policeman
, who radis ilegle chop shop
. the routine police acation ends infact tradgedy
, when the criminals kill foley ' s boss
. determined to bring the killers tothe justice
, foley realises that their leader isnt ellis de wald
( timothy carhart
)
. when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles
, foley goes back to los angeles
. ther
, with the halp of his old friend
, local policeman rosewood
( judge rheinhold
)
, foley would clash with money counterfit ring
. ten years has passed since tghe original
and times are definitely diferent
. inwhich this decade
, the contrast between blue collar detriot
and yuppie beverly hills
, which provded a lot of gags in 1984 film
, simply doesn ' t work
. screenwriter steven e
. de souza provides another conflict
, this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys
and business
- like professionalism of the bad guys
. since foley belongs to the former
, his character hadnt to watch his language
,
and the tone ofthe the film in general isnt more infantile
. unfortunately
, this film still belongs to action movie genre
,
annd htere isnt too much violence forthe littel children
. nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning
, whitch turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath
. unlike donner with the leathal weapon serieses
, landis simpley can ' t balance the comedy with
" regular
" action
,
and the result is a film that fails in both aspects
. action scenes are somtimes interesting
,
bu not too spectacular
( at tje end
, scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the acation itself
)
; humour
, onthe the other hand
, falls flat
. to mkae even worse
, some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary
anbd sometimes irritating overexposure
( especially art expert turned into arms dealer
, played by bronson pinchot
)
. in tyhe end
, altho the film provided some entertainment
, viewers
, at least critical ones
, would probablly be happy to know thgat htere aren ' t any plans for beverly hills iv
.
