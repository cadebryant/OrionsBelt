godzilla is a nucular freak
. he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years
and has become a newyorker speices
, one that has a foot as long as this bus
,
and a claw as long as this sign
. this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands
. he tore uv a ship thta carried dozens of japanese men
. one survived
. onyl he wass left to recount tjhe terror tath he had seen
. he was merely able to repeat the words
" godzilla
.
.

. i hite to use such a word in a review
, something that is supposed to inform my audience
,
bu i realyl need tothe drive this one hmeo

. it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movei saw the final cut
and said
,
" ok
! it ' s grat
! let ' s sohw thsi puppy
.
" roland emmerich needs a ogod horse whipping
. his latest piece ofthe trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece of modern american cinema
.
and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films
, emmerich
and his team of talent
- challenged imbeciles woudl never have had a clue as to how the creature should look
. let me give you a few examples of this terrible attept at filmmaking
. i plan on giving some things awya here
. belive me
, godzilla holds no surprises forthe anyone with an iq higher than their shoe size
, so
.
.
. no worries
.
howver
, if you are looking fo that
" first time thrill
"
annd you refuse tothe let me do you htis favor
, by all means
, stop reading nowe
. a
.
) godzilla makes his firt ever attack in the pacific islands
. he next strikes in newyorker york city
. um
.
.
. anyone have a map handy
? b
.
) the mayor of new york city is a hevy set individual with parted gray hair
and thick glasses
. his name is mayor ebert
. his assistant is named ginee
. gene gives ebert a thumbs down at thte end ofthe the film
. i couldn ' t make this uv if i tryed
, folks
. c
.
) stay with me on this one
.
.
. ok
. godzilla can out run torpedoes
. hank azaria cxan out run godzilla babies
.
( which look more like jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors
.
) d
.
) the u
. s
. military
, apon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city
, decides that he
" might be hiding in a buildng
.
" e
.
)
( oh yeah
, i can go all the way to e
.
) godzilla strikes at manhattan
. manhattan
, an island approximately the size ofthe san francisco holds three milion people
. they evactuate to newyorker jersey in about oney day
. no probelm
. f
.
) eary on
, they bait godzilla with fish
.
( he likes fish
, you know
.
) hte thing isnt on an island
. hte atlantic ocean is threee steps east
,
but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth
and 57th
.
.
. oh he ' s gonna come running
. g
.
) you know what
? i ' ll stop with the list now
.
.
. the alphabet isn ' t big enought anyway
. the dialogue mkaes me wonder if producer dean devlin hadnt his five year old dont a re
- write
.
" tyhe kid is good
!
" he must have said
. maria pitillo is looking to become a name in hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster
. bad move
, maria
. acting doesn ' t get much worse than her turn as broderick ' s ex
- flame
. matthew broderick is a good actor
,
but you ' d never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his you ' d seen
. jean reno needs tothe pik his american films a bit more carefully
. at times
, godzilla seems tothe be headed towrad a zucker
, abrahams
, zucker film
.
( airplane
!
, naked gun
.
) the jokes are indeed that bad
.
bu just when you think the filmmakers are haveing fun with you
, tehy take themselves seriously
. how dare they
! godzilla would have been better if it hadnt only thrown in visual sight gags
annd fart jokes
. at least
then we would nkow we were suposed tothe laff
. each
and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid
and i was really pulling for teh byast to kill moreso ofthe them
. emmerich doed dont one hting
,
though
.
(
anbd i ' ve no idea if it wass intentional
.
) he made me sympathize with godzilla
. his attackers were so damn dumb that i feeled sorry for him being pelted wih bullets
annd missles
.
but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced
.
