my inner flag was at half
- mast last year wehn nick at nite pulled
" dragnet
" reruns off the air
. sure
, i ' d seen them all at least once
,
but i coudl allways count onthe at least a faw inadvertent laughs from ultra
- serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv
. even
though
" dragnet
" is out of circulation at hte moment
, we webb anti
- fans still have the d
. i
.
, a 50 ' s propaganda piece for the miliraty that isnt almost as hilarious as the famoust
" blue boy
" epiode of
" dragnet
.
" for anyone liuke me who got laughs outloud of webb ' s rapid
- fire speeches
and straight
- faced seriousness
, tihkn of tjhe d
. i
. as what would appen if sgt
. joe friday ever enlisted
, becasue he plays exactly tje same character here
, a no
- nonsense ood fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation
and loves to give long
- winded
, melodramatic sppeches on any topic
. in this eleciton year
, i ' m more convinced thna ever that webb
and bob dole were separated at birth
. the movei opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after anyother knocks on webb ' s office doorjam
and enters
. he gives each one a different series ofthe cranky criticisms befoer the credits come up
. tjhe
" produced
adn directed by jack webb
" card pretty much goes without saying
. this is his movei all the way
,
anbd affter the frist twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits forthe no reason
, i was wondering if there would even be a plot
. i certainly would have been entertained by an hour
and a half ofthe trademark webb rants
,
bu hte d
. i
. gives us more
-
- much more
. webb ' s mission isnt to make a man out of private owens
, the local screw
- up
. the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or
, the captian will
" personally cut the lace off his panties
and ship him out myself
.
"
( whether the
" lace panties
" part refers tothe webb or owens rimaniss unanswered
.
) this
, of course
, gives webb an excuse to focuse all his crotchety energy on making owens ' life a living hell
. for thsoe of you who haven ' t been indoctrinated inot the pleasures of webb watching
, here ' s a reprint of a typcial monologue ofthe his
. i can ' t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper
,
but the words shoudln at least partially convey whta i ' m talking about
.
.
.
" now you listen tothe me
, youngster
. someday you ' ll wake up fighting on a beach
and you ' ll pray to god somebody doesn ' t get killed beacuse of your foolishness
.
.
. i ' ve got a headline for you
: every time you mkae one of those little mistakes of yours
, you ' re gonna turn around
and i ' ll be standing right there
.
" i couldn ' t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d
. i
.
( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame
)
,
but i tried to includ some of the more noteworthy lines
, like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day ' s work by goign tothe yhe local bar
( where he orders a tomato juice
)
. he meets a woman who
, coincedentally
, also orders tomato juice
but walks away from a typically
- stimulating conversation with webb tothe flirt with his arch
- rival
, another marine d
. i
. webb marches over to the table
, gets up in her face
and says
,
" just whta kind of a dame do you think you are
?
" bogart he ain ' t
. the otehr d
. i
. gets one ofthe the few memorable non
- webb lines when he confesses tothe the girl
,
" he ' s a damn good d
. i
.
.
.
. i guess i ' m just a little jealous
.
" join thge club
, we ' re all jealous of jack webb ' s way withthe women
, which isnt showcased even omre amusingly in a later scene
, as webb finds his way tothe the woman ' s palce of employment
, a lingerie store
,
annd stands arround looking incredibly flustered at tyhe negligees on display
.
" you expect me to talk to you
.
.
. infront
_ here
_
?
!
" he exclaims
, noone dout intimidated by tyhe barrage of bras
. thge woman goes off to help a customer
, leaving webb tothe fend for himself once agian in this palace of estrogen
. a littel girl spots him infront the store
and demands
,
" what are you doing inspite here
.
.
. you ' re a man
, aren ' t you
?
" he doesn ' t reply
,
but you know he ' s thinking in his head
,
" what an odd species of human
-
- so small
. must be one ofthe thsoe children everyone ' s been talking about
.
" this poor girl
, scarred fo life by her eary encounter with jack webb
, would later swear off the male gender entirely
, jstu one ofthe tghe many lesbian conversions he ' s responsible for
. tghe movei doesn ' t focus too closley onthe webb ' s romance
, it also continues the owens subplot whith probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie
, where webb forces his platoon to spend hte entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills
. after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb witht the wrong dead flea
, webb asks owens
,
" was that flea you killed a male or female
?
" owens replies
,
" a male
, sir
.
" webb yells to the platoon
,
" this ain ' t the one
!
" thast such a scene
( allong iwth the rest ofthe thge movie
) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment
.
bu we know it ws all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making ofthe hte d
. i
.
,
bu for iwo jima
, guadalcanal
and eveyr other major battle of yhe first half ofthe tjhe 20th centruy
. webb held the miliraty in such high esteem tyhat all the soldiers in tjhe movie
( wiht thte exception ofthe owens
) were played by actuall marines
. somene wanting to parody this movie couldn ' t dont a more comical job than webb did
. it makes it all the more ironic
( like raeeyain onthe your wedding day
) that the man had no sense of humor hismelf
. htere ' s a scene iin the movie where the guys are onthe thier break time discussing something
adn one of them breaks inot laughter
. webb bursts inwhich tyhe room
and shouts
,
" what did i tell you about laughing
?
!
" to which the private replies
,
" sir
, onyl nine
- year
- ood girls laugh
, sir
!
"
and let me tell yuo
, i was as happy as a nine
- yearm
- old girl while watching this movei
