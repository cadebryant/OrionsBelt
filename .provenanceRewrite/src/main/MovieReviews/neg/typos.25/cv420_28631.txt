plot
: something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted hous
and playing out parodies of other horror
and non
- horror movies
. oh yeah
, there ' s also something about a ghost posessing the mansion
and shit
,
but trust me
, you won ' t care much about the
" plot
" in thsi film
.
.
. critique
: parody movies either work or they don ' t
and this one jsut doesn ' t work
! the laughs aren ' t as pronounced this time around
, hte energy level
, thge gags
anbd all of thte characters just seem to be gonig through the motions here
. it ' s liuke they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something
( wink
, wink
)
.
and the scariest part of it all
? check out thte number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy
: seven
! i say again
, it took seven people tothe write 82
- mintues worth of fart jokes
, half
- assed stunts
adn spoofs ofthe films otehr than horror
. now i ' m nto exactly sure if each of tghe writers wrote their pwn parts seperately or jsut tossed
" funny sketch
" idaes out there while smoking the chronic themselves
,
but the end result is a film that basically plays outloud like an extended skit on
" saturday night live
"
. there are a couple of funny one
- liners
,
but mostly jsut rehashed one
- joke scenes
, a lot of dead silence
and lame gags
. add to that the very unoriginal title
and movei poster
and you gotta start asking youself if anybody was even trying here
( the film ' s website isn ' t even uv
yot
!
!
! wqat the f

?
!

)
. i do
howver hvae to give it up tothe james woods
, thge man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody ofthe them all
( the exorcist take
- off
-
- miss this
and you ' ve missed any reason to see the flick
)
. i especially liked his one
- liner as he walked in to see tjhe possessed woman ' s head turning
. vrey funny
! unfortunately
, the film plummets straight down after that
, with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to dont iwth horror such as savve the last dance
and dude
, where ' s my car
,
anbd otehr acation movies like charlie ' s angels
and mission impossible 2
. nowe help me figure thsi oney out
, will you
? isn ' t htis supposed tothe be a parody film of horror movies
?
!
?
( or maybe that ' s just the title ofthe tyhe film f
- ing wiht my head
)
. well
, i ' m sorry to have to say this
but tghe only horror in this film is its lame
- ass script
! the wayans brothers should hvea known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers
( mnoey
) instade ofthe the zucker brothers
( comedy
) for this sequel
. unfortunately for us
, all we ' re left wih here is a skeleton of a film which might ' ve beeen funny
, hadnt it been worked over a few more times
, tightened up here
annd there
,
and been injected with more solid laughs
.
but as things stand nowe
, htere is noone dout in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year ' s film has led everyone down this path
, so scre them forthe not trying as hard
( critically speaking
, of course
)
. you shoud all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough
" real
" effort inot this chop
- job
and forthe not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents
. pooh onthe ytou
!
( that ' s telling ' em
, joblo
! sheesh
) btw
, i ' m allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson
, whose massive breasts
adn skanky g
- string had me chompin ' at the bited
