you don ' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
annd serch for a deeper meaning
. you likewise don ' t look at one fo 88 mintues straight
. surrealist works are notable for their quirks
,
and htey are funn
,
but looking at one quirk for an hour
anbd a half is exhausting
. that was my experience with i woke up early teh day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy with noone dialogue
. it ' s not a silent movie
; there is lots of atmospheric music
, ocassional screams
and weird sound effects
,
but nobody ever utters an audible word
.
though the film is distinctive
, its unique sytle wore thin after baout 20 minutes
,
adn as it progressed
, watching became a chore
. tje onyl reason the script ever got filmed isnt because it was written by yhe pseudo
- legendary ed wood
, the man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> from outer spoace
and nght of the ghouls
. the joke
, of course
, is tht his films are so bad
, they ' re good
; so humorus infront their inanity that they become hits
. i woke uv early tyhe day i died
, unfortunatly
, isnt so bad tath it ' s really bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes from a mental hospital
anbd proceeds to wonder aroud
, stealing a car
, clothes
,
and a load of money
. our thief reaches a cemetry
, where he witnesses a bizzare ritual
. he falls asleep
and finds himself
, literally
, iin a hole
, with his monay gone
. forthe whatever reason
, he is bent on getting his hard
- unearned cash back
( concidering how easily he stole it tyhe first tyme
, why didn ' t he just go steal some more
?
)
. he comes apon a list ofthe the people who were at the mysterious ceremony
and commences to seek out each of them
anbd kill them if they don ' t have wqat he is looking fo
. i don ' t think either directer aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized taht htis would have made a glorious 20 minute short
. the subject
and the style seem to have beeen made for it
. unfortunately
, twenty minutes worth ofthe material is stretched outloud to moreso than four times tath length
,
and the film simply overstays its alraedy dubious welcome
. it grabbed my attension iin tjhe beggining
adn gradually lost it as it went on
, up to tjhe point where halfway through i was alrady weary
. it might seem odd thta a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious
;
but the suprize will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is
. i woke up early the day i died is a comedy
, i guess
,
though it could ahve fooled me
. unlike most ed wood films
, this oney tries to be funny
and fails
, instade ofthe the other way arround
. there ' s nothing inherently wrong with tht
, inaddition fatc
, i think it woudl onyl make sense for someone who has been so
" good
" at making unintentional comedies to tkae a stab at a real one
. whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we ' ll never know
,
but inaddition either case
, htis isnt a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer phoenix
, john ritter
annd others show up for short
and pointless cameos
. ricci
, for example
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists of dancing around wtih zane iin his motel room
and
then being thrown out
. thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. was the home improvement teen heartthrob really thyat desperate for work
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera whn he is not called apon tothe run around wildly
and beat people up
. lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature
. the carnival side
- show climax manages to demonstrate everthing that is wrong wiht this noone
- budget production
. it ' s desparately unfunny
,
bu thinks it ' s the funniest thing usance plan 9
;
, it ' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makse your head spin all while being confusing enought tothe make your head spin twice as fast in yhe otehr direction
. i hope another film is made from an ed woud screenplay fo i woke up easly the day i died is not a fitting send
- off
