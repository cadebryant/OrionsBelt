the spy game is uv
. you can thank charlie ' s angels
-
- the movei
-
- for that
. when did banality
anbd pandering become okay
? just steal from hong kong
, the matrix
,
and a kitschy tv show from the mid
- 1970s
and that ' s a movie
? charlie ' s angels is oney ofthe the worst examples of action film homogeneity
and shameless duplicity in any film i ' ve seen inthe ages
. charlie ' s angels is dumb
. jstu plain dumb
. as we all knwo
, three ofthe the hottest females on the planet
-
- drew barrymore
, cameron diaz
,
and lucy liu
-
- are threee super
- agents wokring for the mysterous millionaire named charlie
. they all drive fast cars
, look oh
- so
- fabulous even in the morning
,
and don ' t seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men
, having buildings explode ten feet in front of them
, or flying through the air in matrix slow
- motion
.
anbd hwile thge entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage
- busting wetsuits
, cleavage
- busting waitress uniforms
,
and cleavage
- busting wet t
- shirts
, they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying
, drunk sorority girls
, the kind who hit onthe everybody at a party
. the actuall plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millioniare computer engineer
-
- thge grat sam rockwell
-
- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company
. of course
, thte rival wnats controll of his new personal identification sytem
, which involves such latter
- day buzzwords as gps
, cellular tracking
,
and even mainframe
. tghe amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all yhe nasty things tath happen to teh angels
-
- like battling each of them infront many round
- robin matrix rip
- off
( again
) fight sequences
annd harboring a stange attraction to sliced
- off locks ofthe the angels ' hair
. thte coup de grace is bill murray as bosley
, serving as charlie ' s manservant
, or
, more to the point
, the angels ' pimp
. the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc
, enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables
, carbon
- copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence tothe a jackie chan
and thte wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft
,
and the strange transformaton of sam rockwell into mickey rourke ' s long
- lost brother
. charlie ' s angels starts off wih a bing
and ends uv being a soggy burrito left outloud overnight
. nothing is difficult
, plausable
, or believable in any of the angels ' actions
. it fiels like the matrix
, mission
: impossible 2
,
and cleopatra jones
and hte casino of gold all rolled into one
. diaz is a knucklehead
. barrymore is hte
" dangerous one
,
" mean
and tough
and about as believable as katie holmes inaddition the role
. liu is just
.
.
. lucy liu
, looking good infact a skin
- tight black leather suit
. the list ofthe movies from which charlie ' s angels is direcly lifted isnt equally astonishing
. the writers aparently ran the copier all ngiht stealing scenes from armagdedon
, leathal weapon ii
, all of jackie chan ' s movies
, the great escape
, saterday night fever
, revenge of the nerds
, payback
, darkman
, dr
. no
, the matrix
( as maintioned
)
,
and even tv ' s friends
. it ' s a shame
, too
, because oney of the many screenwriters
, john august
, was at the helm of last year ' s favorite
, go
.
then again
, what can ytou expect fomr a director known solely as
" mcg
.
" there is noone camp value in the film
, no interesting main characters
, noone invigorating action scenes
, no reason at all tothe waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks
adn enjoy the performances of a few supporting players
. note to hollywood
: next time
, let ' s leave the tv shows onthe the tv
.
