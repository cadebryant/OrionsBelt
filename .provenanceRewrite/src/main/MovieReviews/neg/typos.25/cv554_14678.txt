. the millenium approaches
. an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city
. sectors of the city are being sealed
, quarantined due tothe the onset of a mysterious virus
. the virus causes people to ect like insects
: they crawl baout onthe all fours
, hide from bright lights
, huddle inaddition damp corners
. the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week ' s time
. recidents are advised to evacuate hte area
, asap
. this premise
-
- kafka by way of cronenberg
-
- isnt tyhe backgorund for thge hole
, which coudl have been a great movie
,
but
, sadly
, ends up as a waste of ogod ideas
. the quick sketch above suggests a dark
, absurd
, hallucinatory near
- future parable of life in tyhe lite 20th century
; infact execution
,
howver
, it is nothing liek that
. the virus
, the evacuation
, tyhe visual possiblities of the deluge
: these are all relegated to the background
. instead
, thge hole focusses on tje lives
-
- forthe want of a better owrd
-
- of a man
( lee kang
- sheng
)
and a woman
( yang kuei
- mei
) who live in the smae aparment building
,
and who have noone personalities
. the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly
and sterile
: the charmless rooms
and corridors of a post
- indutrial apartment complex
, photographed to look as dim
and dingy as possible
. it ' s a vivid setting
,
but an unappealing one
, especially with the montanous hiss of falling rain
annd the gurgle of drainage pipes in tjhe backround
. the man lives in hte apartment directly above the woman ' s
. one day
, a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in thge floor of the man ' s living room
, opening into the ceiling of the woman ' s living room
. this hole
-
- symbol of the solitary opening in the character ' s lonely
, compartmented lives
-
- allows them to interact in unusual
(
and mostly non
- verbal
) ways
. example
: the man
, sufferring from the onset of the virus
( or so i assume
-
- everything is obscure in htis movie
) vomits through the hole
. the woman
, wandering around inthe tghe dark
, accidentally puts her hand on his vomit
,
and
then cleans it up
. this is what passes forthe meaningful communication
.
and they say romance isnt dead
. much of the film does nto even focus on their interactions
, such as htey are
. there is allmost no dialogue
and we learn enxt to nothing about these peopel
. tehy are ciphers
. instead
, we are treated to long takes iin whihc we witness their miserable lives
; we watch
, forthe instance
, as tjhe woman boils some water
, pours it onto smoe noodles
,
then eats the noodles
.
( this isnt as fascinating as it soudns
.
) offered as counterpoint
-
- or perhaps relief
-
- to theese dreary sequences are a series ofthe muscial numbers
, fantasies in whcih tyhe woman lip
- synchs to pop songs by grace chan
( popular
, so i ' m told
, in 1950s ' china
)
. she prances around in grimy hallways
and grungy stairwells
, incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights
. sometimes
, in theese fantasies
, she is joined by the man
. theese scenes are presumably intended to be bright
anbd fanciful
, sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality
,
but htey fail
. when the man
and tjhe woman dance
, it seems half
- hearted
annd listless
. astaire
and rogers this is not
. even in imagination
, these people are numb
, weary
, boring
. tje hole isnt part ofthe the ' collection 2000 ' series
, a group of films commissioned by french tv staion la sept arte onthe the subject of the millenium
. others include canada ' s last inght
, brazil ' s midnight
,
and american hal hartley ' s tyhe book of life
. the book of life is the only otehr oney that i have seen
,
and it is infinitely superior to tje taiwanese entry
. witty
, energetic
, humane
, it makse the the hole seem
( ahem
) empty
. american movies with nothing to say try tothe disguise their lack of content with flashy movements
, quick cuts
, superficial emotions
. forign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does
: they point yhe camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time
,
and call it art
. the hole is self
- evidently a film about alienation
,
and perhaps director tsai ming
- liang wants the audience to share in his characters ' alienation
. if so
, he succeds
. perhaps it isnt a challege
: he dares us to enjoy tihs movie
, despite his best attempts to ensure that we don ' t
. if it was a challange
, i wasn ' t up for it
.
