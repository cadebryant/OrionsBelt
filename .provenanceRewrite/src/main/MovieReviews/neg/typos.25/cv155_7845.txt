" gordy
" is not a movie
, it is a 90
- minute
- long
" sesame strent
" skit
,
and a vyer bad one at that
. this movei is so stupid
anbd dumb thta it ' s depressing to thiunk that some hollywood executives acually gave this tyhe gren light
,
anbd even omre surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie
. i ' m sure children are the target audeince of this movie
,
but only kids under teh age of five may be able to tolerate it
. it is tje story of a farm a piglet named gordy
( voiced by garms
)
, whose family has been taken away to
" up north
,
" which we know means death
. ofthe course we can hear the animals talk tothe each other
,
and they actaully went to yhe trouble of atempting to sync the voices with theri mouths
bu it comes out terrible
. actually
, it ' s almost funny inspite a way
. the only remotely interesting
and likable character soon appears
, a little girl named jinnie sue macallister
( young
) who sees gordy on the bakc ofthe a truck
and essentially steals him
. jinnie isnt a country singer
and the film goes off on a huge tangent tothe show her littel concert
and the people dancing to it
. whta is the point of this
? maybe she isnt one of the producer ' s relatives
and they wanted to show her onthe camera tothe promote her or something
. we
then cut to a huge social gathering
and drop in onthe another young kid named hank royce
( roescher
) who is sad because his divorced mother isnt dating
. he leaves tje party
and meets jinnie sue
,
but he accidentally falls in a pool
( probably because he was sitting onthe the diving board with a
$ 200 suit onthe
- nah
, didn ' t see that one comming
!
)
, starts to drown
,
and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable folat over to him
and saves him
. if this had not been insanely stupid arleady thge story quicklyu changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who
then ends uv becomming the ceo of a fod processing corporation when hank ' s grandfather
, tghe original ceo
, dies
and leaves his fortune tothe hank
.
.
.
annd gordy
! ofthe course there must be a villain
,
but even this villain
( donadio as sipes
) isn ' t that evil
. he never raises his voice or becomes angry
,
adn ofthe course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy
but this is just so beyond stupid
and cartoony we are constantly twpo steps ahead of the story
. it ' s hard to tell whether the overall corniness
annd cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film
, or if the filmmaker ' s are just htis untalented
and stupid
. at times
" gordy
" is tolerable to watch
, thus earning it oen star
and not the dreaded
" z
-
.
"
but it ' s just so unbelievably boring
, cliche
, dumb
, unfunny
, corny
,
and just plain bad it may scare children
, it certainly disturbed me
