perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday nigt live who alwasy started the segment iwth
"
.
.
. this isnt the fake news
,
" norm macdonald
, at times
, could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi
- offensive phrases in his raspy voice
, coated with a condescending attitude
. his shtick was marked by crassness
. in this movei
, for example
, when his girlfriend says that she ' s kicking him out because he ' s been fired from 14 differant jobs over the last 3 monthes
, he tries to calm the situation by saying
,
" maybe you ' ll efel better after we hvea smoe dirty sex
.
" this kind of humor can only go so far
,
but certainly cant ' t go the distance in a full
- lenght feature
.
" dirty owrk
"
, is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about twpo best friends who grow up onyl physically
. emotionally
, htey ' ve never outgrown their pubescent years
, whcih is somewhat amusingly explored in a begining flashback
. altho hvaing noone apprent real world skills
, the noe thing that these twpo ahve always been adept at is getting bcak at people
. if thge meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket
,
then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels ofthe corn onto the engine block
and watch the car burst apart
. mitch
( norm macdonald
)
and sam
( artie lange
) need to come up with
$ 50
, 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam ' s dad
( jack warden
) cxan have a heart operation
. their idea isnt to start a revenge
- for
- hire business where tehy ' ll do your dirty work
. inspite thge funniest scene
(
anbd possibly tyhe only funny scene
) ofthe the movie
, htey take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby unsed car lot
. their presence isnt established
,
but when a less
- than
- honarable real estate developer hires them
and
thne reneges on the payment
, the two go to work tothe excact their sordid brand of revenge
. by default
, dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots
,
but it delivers jerky boys level material
. except for the bit at the used car lot
(
and possibly another episode thta involves frat brothers
)
, tghe dirty owrk isnt uninspired
and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call
. already weak on material
, it furuther spirals itself towords the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido
and needs ' broads '
and also includes a vrey unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction
.
but what ' s relaly painfully evident is tath norm macdonald has noone versatility as an atcor
. relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder
annd saying
" note to self
"
(
" note to self
: learn to fight
,
" he says after getting beated up
;
" note to self
: there ' s always beer
,
" he sasy after hitting rock bottom
; etc
.
)
, we feel like we ' re just watching an elongated rehash of his not
- so
- glorious days on saturday night live
. much liuke the televsion show
, for 90 mintues we get oney or two funny bits
. the rest of the story is just dead space
.
