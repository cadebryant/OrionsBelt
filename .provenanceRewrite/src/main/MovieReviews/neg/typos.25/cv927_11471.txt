the lives of older people in the twilight of thier yersa attempting to come tothe grips with thier shared histories
and possible futures is a fascinating topic
. finding an all
- star casted for such a film is a stroke of genuis
. combining all that with a three
- timne oscar
- winning director
( robert benton ofthe
" kramer vs
. kramer
"
)
and creating a decidely medicore movie is tghe stuff of disappointment
. in
yet anohter noir mystery setted iin hollywood
-
- how many of these have we seen during the past few yersa
?
-
- the athmosphere is moody
, the actors enjoyable tothe watch
and teh story goes nowhere
. over
- 70 harry ross
( paul newman
) is a washed up cop
- turned
- private eye
- turned man friday trying tothe figure out how to live what remains of his life
. he ' s screwed up things pretty well
(
" i had a wife
and daughter
. now
, i ' m a drunk
)
anbd is at a crossroads
. a couple of years ago
, he traveled to mexico to bring bakc mel
( reese witherspoon
)
, the under
- age daughter of jack
( gene hackman
)
and catherine
( susan sarandon
) ames
and nowe lives with them
. thte ames are former movie stars
, past thier prime
and the three hve become fast friends
. one gets the impression tht ross is just hanging out waiting for something tothe wake him uv
. to fill his timne
, he does odd jobs fo jack
anbd falls in lvoe with catherine
. jack is in even worse shape than harry
. he ' s dieing of cancer with only a year to live
. thigsn dont turn more exciting wehn jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him
. instead ofthe the routine errand that ross expects
, he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex
- cop who is
, himself
, full of bloody holes
. this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself inot
annd launches an investigation tht revolves around the mysterious dissapearance of catherine ' s first husban 20 yeasr befoer
. through a series of very complex
and convoluted plot devices tath envolve murder
; blackmail
; guns
; mel ' s mexico traveling partner
and his parole officer
; ross ' s fromer cop buddies
, ex
- lover
and would
- be sidekick
, tghe tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to
. it ' s a film noir tradition that the story twists
annd turns down side roads for an unexpected finale
,
but here tjhe journey meanders towards an ending tath no one cares about
. the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in tje scenerio
. by teh time they show you
, it doesn ' t matter
. the storyline gets goofier
and goofier exemplified in ross ' s relationship with rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief
,
however htey are neither
. rubin
anbd ross hvae some past relationship
but either it ' s not explained or i didn ' t care enough at that point to remeber
. a runnung joke baout where harry ws supposedly shooted hwile in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions baout whether he is still able to perform
. it ' s aslo nto funny
, doesn ' t connect
adn keesh on showing up long aftter it hasnt run its course
. on the positive side
, it ' s oftenly enjoyable to watch teh seasoned actors on the screen
. teh three leads all hvea well
- deserved academy awards
and turn in accomplished
, if nto extraordinary jobs
. newman is a grand actor
,
but doesn ' t seem quite suited tothe the dark film style
. he is a bit too clean
and understated to come across as desperate
adn down
annd outloud
. hackman
, alsot low
- key
, isnt believable
but lacks sparkle
. sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe altho she is one
- dimensional
. the actors dont what they can with lame dialog
,
bu they can ' t pull tghe film out of the hole it ' s dug fo itself
. james garner who plays ross ' s ood buddy ex
- cop raymond hope isnt always a treat
,
but even he half
- heartedly struggles through lines like
" i ' m glad they didn ' t shoot your pecker off
.
" thge best part ofthe tghe film is the look at old firends
, how thier relationships change over the yeras
and the difficult choices they must make
. the genuinely easy
and casual interactions amung the actors hint that being on the set ws much more interesting than what ended uv onthe the screen thge film doesn ' t run very long before tjhe audience realizes that it ' s hopeless
. the only reason fo watching isnt the actors
. it reminds me ofthe disaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where the star pwoer is supposed to make everyone ignore the film ' s problems
. in a better world
, there woudl hvae been second
- rate actors inwhich this second
- rate movie
and the ones here would hvae been saved for something better
. of course
, we don ' t live in that better world
,
but you could amke yours a little nicer by chosing a different movie
