if you ' re debating whether or not to see
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, ask yourself oney simple question
: do ytou want tothe see nick nolte in lingerie
? the only peopel who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph ' s chaotic adaptation of thge kurt vonnegut novel is the cross
- section of the population with yhe unhealthy urge tothe see tht unpleasant sight
. everyone else
-
-
and i ' m hoping that ' s most people
-
- would be wise tothe steer claer of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. actually
,
though
, the sight of nolte in high heels isnt one of the more amusing things about this muddle
, which focuses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, the owner ofthe dwayne hoover ' s exit 11 motor village in midland city
. nto only isnt he a huge success as a businessman
, he ' s allso something of a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing serieses of television commercials
. with a nice home
anbd family to boot
, dwayne appears to hvae it all the ingredients tothe be happy
-
-
yot he ' s not
. his wife celia
( barbara hershey
) is perpetually in a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) isnt a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage nmae
" bunny
.
" nto only that
, the environmental protection agency isnt on dwayne ' s ass over a building development project
. it ' s enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown
-
- that is
, if he doesn ' t seceed in blowing his brains outloud first
. meanwhile
, midland city isnt about to host a fine arts festival
,
anbd the guest of hounour is noe kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writer who is far from thte renowned author the festival ' s organizer
( buck henry
) was led tothe believe
-
- in fact
, he ' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi that appears in porn magazines
. his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey
, one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne
, who for some reason thinks thyat trout will hold for him all of life ' s answers
. the above isnt already a longer plot synopsis than i ususally give inwhich my reviews
,
but
, ironically
, i have barely scratched yhe surface
. i haven ' t
yet maintioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con with an obsessive admiration for the simmilarly
- named dwayne
.
then there ' s the matter ofthe francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne ' s devoted secretary
. not tothe mention dwayne ' s employee
and old friend harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, the one withthe the secret penchant for cross
- dressing
.
anbd so on
. tghe film is essentialy dwayne ' s tsory
,
but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric poriferal players that one often wonders what thte point is
. rudolph does arrive at a point
( more on that later
)
,
but it ' s blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material
. thte surreal visual sytle
, complet witht printed words flying through the air
and into dwayne ' s ears
, is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness
,
bu its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad
. the actors are called on to ect acordingly
, resulting in some of the worst
, most overdone work all of them hvae ever turned in
. willis fares best of all
-
-
but that ' s baceause his frozen expression ofthe befuddled bewilderment mirrors thast ofthe the audience
. with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running tiem
, it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious
,
and rudolph tries tothe make a statment
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film that
_ breakfast
_ resembles inaddition more than a few ways
, to its grat detrement
)
, there isn ' t any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift
. as such
, the cartoony characters fail to win a simapthy that needs to be earned
;
and the film attemts
, to no avail
, to reach a profundity that it doesn ' t deserve
. vonnegut ' s orginial novel isnt considered a classic
,
but it had been called unfilmable
-
- the same that was said of hunter s
. thompson ' s
_ fear
_
and
_ loathing
_ infact
_ las
_ vegas
_
, which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam
. with thte similar failure of
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, will hollywood ever leran thast books labeled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable
? likely not
.
