adn julie ' s
( julie hagerty
,
" airplane
"
) basement
. as dad declares all out war
, gord secures a job in a cheese sandwhich factory in far off la
and sets off tothe make his dreams come true
. gord doesn ' t make much of a go on his first attempt
and lands bcak hmeo with fawning mom
and outraged dad iin
" freddy got fingered
.
" toom green cowrites
( with
" toom green show
" scribe derek harvie
)
, directs
and stars in what is essentially tom gren ' s primal scream
. so
, if tom green screams in an empty theather
, does he make a sound
? it ' s claer that
" freddy got fingered
" is at least partially autobiographical
and green sure has oen hell of a complex about his dad
( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out
adn have sex iwth basketball players
adn greeks
)
. while this may be ofthe interest tothe his hard core fans
, there ' s littel about gren ' s mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else
. the film starts promisingly enough
, with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall setted to the sex pistols ' ' problem '
( green ' s put together a first rate soundtrack
)
and yes
, i laughed a few times
. gren ' s flummoxing of a security guard withthe psychotic ramblings
anbd his attempt to draw
, make music
and eat at the smae time
( the ' daddy would you like some sausages ' scene repeatedly shown in thge film ' s trailer
) are inspired comedy
.
but wqat ' s funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap
? a baby delivery bit shows some groan
- inducing promise unitl enough blood is splattered tothe coagulate hte laughs
. younger
( by three yersa
) brother freddy ' s internment at the institute for sexually abused childen does nothing
but confirm one ' s worst fears regarding the film ' s title
annd green ' s infamous ' handling ' ofthe a real horse
, while not nearly as shocking as it would seem
, doesn ' t mkae sense
. by tjhe time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film ' s end
, the overall effect is numbness
. while
" freddy got fingered
" hasnt the admirable end result of depicting tghe harm in demeaning a child ' s self esteem
, it ' s essentially a whole lot of tom gren running around bieng noisy
. rip torn
