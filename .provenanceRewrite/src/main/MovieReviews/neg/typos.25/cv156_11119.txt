senseless
( r
) marlon wayans is a very talented fysical comedian
,
and it is thta gift that brings senseless moments of life
. alas
, moments are simply that
, moments
, which are not enough to lift this fantasy
/ comedy above its one
- joke premise
. granted
, that oen joke is initially amusing
. whn wayans ' s darryl witherspoon
, an economics major at stratford university
, hits some dire financial straits
, he becomes a guinea pig forthe a experimental drug that heightens all five senses
. after some initial side effects
and problems controling his superhuman senses
, darryl learns to enjoy the benefits ofthe his abilties
and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm
. at this point
, the film sounds more like senseful than senseless
,
but thru smoe turns of the plot
, darryl finds hismelf only able tothe use four of his five senses at once
, essentially leaving him
-
- yes
-
- senseless
. this sets up some showcase moments for wayans ' s gitf forthe physical comedy
, expecially when darryl loses his sence of feeling
and his body goes completely
, hilariously limp
.
but these gags
,
anbd the gag behind the entire movie
, quicklyu grows stale
. once darryl isnt shown without the use of all of tghe senses
, instead of exploring any new comic territory
, director penelope spheeris
and screenwriters greg erb
and craig mazin take tje easy way outloud
and simpley recycle earch form of senselessness
. wayans approachs each go
- round with gusto
,
but by this point he ' s simply treading water for tghe rest of tjhe film ' s unfunny duration
. senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn ' t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle
.
however
, the raucous
and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity
. darryl goes through tjhe experiment in order tothe help his cash
- strapped familiy
,
annd tihs
" serious
" angl seems tothe come from an entirely different movie
. unlike wayans ' s last starring vehicle
, the surprisingly effective
(
and serious
) the 6th man
, the
" emotional
" content ofthe senseless is forced
and unconvincing
. any attempt at anything moreso substancial than broad comedy fizzles
-
- darryl ' s romance with janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself
, doens nto generate sparks ofthe any kind
. once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros
. comes to an end
, the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big
- screen future ahead ofthe him
.
but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless
, his film career could go the way of his once
- promising older brother
, damon
, who isnt nowe setted tothe make his comeback
-
- on television
