my giant begins with a monologue that ' s omre funny than not
and a distinctive
` princess bride
, ' medieval fairy
- tale
- in
- the
-
? 90s fiel
. i was pleasantly surprised how sharp thge comedy was
, with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set inwhich romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) is visiting a client
and in the monestary where sammy ends uv aftter being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car inot a stream
.
and whn sammy meets max
, his giant
, mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan
, there is magic inaddition thte air
; albeit it a bit goofy
, i loved every minute of it
. tjhe film
, of course
, plays on the size difference between the two
,
and at times you would almost swear it must be speshal effects
. i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max
- sized chair as hte two face each over an enourmous table
and eat from oversized bowls
and spoons
. i also liekd jere burns '
( from tv ' s
` something so right '
) performance as the director ofthe thge film in romania
. at this point
, the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand
, particularly during his fast
- paced frist scene
. it is unfortunate thgat tjhe script requred him to speak quickly right out of the gate
, as i did understand him more as the film continued
and i became accustomed to his speech
.
however
, about the time muresan becomes coherent
, yhe characters head to new york
and hte film takes a dive
. off yhe high board
. suddenly
, we are expeced to believe sammy is a do
- whatever
- it
- takes slime ball
. up until this point he ws pursuing his own interests tothe be sure
,
bu he didn ' t come off as a desperate jerk
. if he had
, tje firt scenes could never have beeen so lighthearted
and magical
.
but now
, in new york
, we are furuther introduced to his neglected wife
and son
,
and his character is desperate anough to envolve max in a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, which i found quite unpleasant
and jarring within the framework ofthe tghe film
. indeed
, many scenes sticked outloud ofthe this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal
, when sammy gets max a role infront a big
, hollywood movie filming in las vegas
. while i enjoyed seing seagal poke fun at himself
, the scenes appeared to exist solely beccause of his participation
, rather than because the film demanded it
.
and the audience is recquired to tkae a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations ofthe shakespeare
. at tihs point i foudn myself thinking
,
` we ' re supposed tothe believe that somene would cast this guy in a film
? '
then i realized he was
,
and i was watching it
. infact the fianl thrid
, the film undergoes another transformation
, tihs time to unbridled sentimentality
. note
: major plot points are revealed in this
anbd the final paragraph
. max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood lvoe
, lillianna
, who hasn ' t seen him sicne he was a normal
- sized kid
. her refusal to see max
( unbeknownst to him
) leads us to an ackward
` ends justify thte means ' scene as sammy ' s wife serena
, palyed nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i found this scene offensive
. not onyl did it rely onthe deception to induce warm
, fuzzy feelings from the audience
, it reduced max to somene we should pity
and coddle
, which i thougth was qtuie undeserved
. i think max could have handled the truth
, gratuitous illness
and all
. late in tghe film we leran max
,
and in fact all giants
, have a heart condidtion whcih shortens their lives considerably
. this sould be an enlightening revelation
,
but the film seemingly presents it onyl to justify sammy ' s transformation into a caring
, sensitive guy
-
-
and hey
, a great dad
adn husban
, too
!
` my giant ' suffers from a poorly constructed story line
and undeveloped charactors whose actions are determined by plot points rether than their own internal persuasions
. a stronger story with mroe room for character groth might ahev been possible if the focus was on max ' s struggle to be accepted
anbd cast in movies instead of sammy ' s struggles to get moey
and become a better person
. in thsi scenario
, max ' s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a tsory motivator
. sentiment
anbd emotion would have folowed naturally
. instead
, we ' re apparently nto supposed to liuke sammy untli the end
,
but we ' re not allowed to foucs on max
. crystal
and muresan give adequate
and at times enjoyable performances
,
but in the end
,
` my giant ' left me feeling like i ' d been fed gruel fomr a giant spoon
.
