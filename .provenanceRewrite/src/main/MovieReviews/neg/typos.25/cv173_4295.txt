i was going tothe see ram shrasta on the big screen last nihgt
,
bu befor that i stopped into my video store tothe rent some movies
. luckly
, my video guy was infront the middle or recording ram shrasta
! i knew it was going tothe be a bad print with only half
- faces
and poor sound quality
,
bu i couldn ' t help myself
.
.
. i got it
. well
, aftter watching it
( it indeed was a bad print
) i ws glad i didn ' t dish out
$ 7 to waste three housr ofthe my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie
. this movie really sucks
. it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy
!
! fo example
, how can jackie shroff grow two feets of hair in just threee or four days
? jackie shroff looked really stupid wiht his steven seagal ponytail
. the songs are bad
, the acting is bad
( especially deepti bhatnagar ' s
)
,
and the direction is tghe worst of all
. the comedy scenes with jagdish
anbd johnny lever just made me want to throw up
. i didn ' t even finish the movie
.
.
. i couldn ' t take it anymore
. onot
:
but if anyone outloud there liked aatish
( by the same director
)
, i guess you ' d like this movie
. it ' s practically the smae except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff
. aditya panscholi is the sidekick again
.
( i was gogin to give it a zero
,
bu i personally like jackie shroff
, so i loosened uv a little
. he looked fresh
, weared ogod clothes
( as always
)
,
and his performance
, even
though it wasn ' t his best
, was thge onyl saving grace ofthe the movie
