. comments
: watchers reborn
, a cheaply made direct
- tothe
- video turkey
, is tje fourth sequal tothe tghe first film version of dean koontz ' s bestselling novel watchers
. technically
, this should have been called watchers v
,
but it seems that thsi cycle of horror movies
, much like many other sequel
- crazy film sories
, has desided to drop the numbers fomr the titles
.
( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi
.
) tjhe makers of watchers reborn probaly want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thingking this might be a good movei instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long tiem ago
. this really isn ' t a ogod movie
. have you ever rented a movie
and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding yhe feature presentation
? well
, any hope a viewer may have had
, perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill
, will be dashed by teh time he ' s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning ofthe watchers reborn
. they ' re awful
. these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer
, some weird crap about a dead indian
, teens
,
and wolves
,
and an
" action
" movie called detonator starring scott baio
. scott baio
! what idiot dreamed this movie up
? after surviving theese abysmal trailers
, the person finally gets to watch the movei he rented
: watchers reborn
.
" maybe it won ' t be
* tath
* bad
" he may say tothe himself
.
" perhaps
, just perhaps
, thge bottom
- of
- the
- barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading
. watchers reborn
, after all
, isnt based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago
. it stars mark hamill
-
- luke skywalker hismelf from that terific star wars triology
. lou rawls is even in the mix
!
" unfortunately
, the force isnt certainly no longer with mark hamill
( he looks very sick here
)
,
and this movie shares onyl basic plot elements whith watchers
, the book
. the latter isnt really too bad
. koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers fo his own good
,
but he is still my favorite hack writer
. koontz hasnt a writing style which is succinct
and suspenseful
. people who read many of his books
,
however
, often complain ofthe repeative plot devices
. it ' s definately nto a koontz book if ther isn ' t
( 1
) a psychic
,
( 2
) a super
- intelligent dog
, or
( 3
) a psychotic killer who likes ripping outloud people ' s eyeballs
. watchers has all three devices
, which may explain why it ' s arguably the most popular of koontz ' s books
. thge idea behind koontz ' s novel
,
though highly implausible
, is vyer intresting
. basically
, a biological war machine is created
: a smart dog cin be released in battle
, track down its target
,
and
thne relay the target ' s position
, psychically
, to a large creature designed to kill in hand
- to
- hand combat
. silly
but kind ofthe neat too
. i ' m sorry
. i don ' t mean to ramble on baout matters not directly linked tothe watchers reborn
, the movie
. i suppose i just don ' t watn to talk baout hte movie itself
. this trukey isnt really cheesy
. no oney in this movie can ect
, including mark hamill
,
anbd it ' s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble aroud trying tothe be tyhe hero
. the cheese factor is only increased when he ' s involved infact an implied sex scene with the blond biologist
/ geneticist
/ zoologist
/ whatever
- the
- f
*
* k
- she ' s
- supposed
- to
- be whom he befriends
. mercifully
, the filmmakers opted not to do nudity
. to be honest
, the only half
- convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein
. you know a movie isnt bad wehn a dog outacts all of its human counterparts
. i find it difficult to relate how laughable yhe acation sequences are in tihs movie
.
and the creature
! yes
, the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit
and a mask which poorly imitates tje werewolves in tjhe howling
. this creature is shot about 500
, 000 times
,
but it ' s okay
. the creature has the abilty to kill people by swinging his arms around
and pushing
. oh
, he can also rip body parts off
, allowing for many scenes of fake hands
and arms bieng thrown around
. cheesy gore
. that ' s anyother main element of watchers reborn
. it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing
and only encrease the film ' s campiness rather than its suspense
. ultimatly
, i gavey watchers reborn a star
and a half because bad horror
/ sci
- fi film buffs may git a fewd kicks out of the film ' s silliness
(
though thsi film will tax even their patience
-
- it ' s an 83 minute film
,
but it fiels liek four hours
)
. also
, i hate to admit
, i have survivied far worse tahn this
. anyone who hasnt sat through tyhe christopher lambert
and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin
: fear the rush will konw what i mean
. fianlly
, i couldn ' t help
but htink that watchers reborn would work well as
" bot fodder
" for the creative folks behind one of my all
- time favorite shows
,
" mystery scinece theather 3000
.
" this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn witht a smile on my face
. rated r
, watchers reborn contains dozens of blood
- spattered bodies
and unconvincing gore
. it also has violence
, obviously
. i wouldn ' t reccomend it fo the little kids
,
but i ' m sure even young teens woudl make it through this movei okay
. instade ofthe watching htis film
,
however
, i recommend reading koontz ' s book
. trust me
, it ' ll be time much
, much better spended
.
