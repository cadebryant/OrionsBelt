the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes
, with everything ranging from
" l
. a
. confidential
" to
" palmetto
" tothe
" the big lebowski
,
" has prooved to be an artistic commodity for veteran
, talented directors
. with thsi parituclar genre
, directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower
- clas
and the glamorous
, opulent upper
- clas
, while maintaining the noirish
, ambiguous ambience
, yhe staple of film noir
.
" wild things
" could be classified as a black comedy
, a sultry film noir or a plain ol ' erotic thriller
,
bu teh one category it doesn ' t qualify for is that ofthe a quality motion picture
. overacted
, overwrought
and overlong
,
" wild thigns
" is a confused mess
, a movie tht wnats to haev its cake
and eat it too
. witht its incalculable twists
, turns
, mroe twists
and more turns
, it soon becomes a tedious exercise inspite pointlessness
. in spite of gaem effords by kevin bacon
and matt dillon
, who manage to sustain straight faces thoughout the ordeal
,
" wild thigns
" not once jells in its eroticism
, unpredictability
, charater motivation
, sense ofthe the world
, plot
, etc
. there ' s not oen redeeming qualty inaddition the picture thta is not technical
. directed by john mcnaughton
(
" henry
: potrait of a serial killer
"
)
,
" wild thigns
" follows sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a hunkish
, suburban florida high skool teacher who ' s the dream of eveyr spruced up female in the community
. particularly one
. kelly van ryan
( denise richards
) adores him tothe such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner
. soon
, her tiny shorts are soaked
and tells the other girl to take a hike
, enabling her tothe come into his house
. next thing
, she cries rape
.
and the so
- called
" roller
- coaster ride
" ensues
. a second accuser comes front
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, a booze
- drinkin '
, tattooed peice of trailer trash that charges lombardo ofthe sexually molesting her
, virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions
, asinine occurrences
and laughable courtroom procedures are binded to happen
. even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo ' s zany lawyer
. he wears a fake neck
- brace
, waves the finger at the otehr client
annd infuses the script with soem billy murray
. you can tell mcnaughton knew he hadnt nothing to lose assigning murray to thsi role
. as ridiculous as it sounds
, he ' s the most sane character in the movie
. the community is astonished
. reporters flee tothe the scene
. htere ' s an 8
. 5
- milion settlement for a libel suit against kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
. ther ' s the ambiguous cop
( kevin bacon
, who also execuitve produced
) who sniffs something iffy in tihs concoction ofthe deceit
, muder
and lust
. we
, the audience
, sniff something not so lustful
. like so many thrillers these days
, incuding
" thge usual suspects
"
and
" the game
,
"
" wild things
" eschews character for plot
. mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera
,
and he keeps tyhe campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease
, as if he knows the territory he ' s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany
" henry
,
" a furious
, unsettling film directorial tour
- de
- force
. george clinton ' s score isnt a delight to behold
.
but it ' s the humans
. hte cahracters are mere devices for the
" nasty
" twists
. what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving
, almost unbearable
, if those who inhibit htis twisted world are not intresting
, don ' t feel real or we don ' t care for them
. not even the unintentionally funny moments work
. the people inthe
" wild thnigs
" are not so much people as they are caricatures
.
then there ' s the erotic content
, whlch nearly earned hte film an nc
- 17
, for a sexless
, badly edited
, poorly lit menage
- a
- trois
.
and in waht has tothe be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that hasnt graced htis country
, kevin bacon ' s member makes a cameo appearance with ten mintues tothe go
. ironically
, the wildest elements of
" wild thigsn
" are not wild at all
.
