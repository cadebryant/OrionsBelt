susan granger ' s review ofthe
" glitter
"
( 20th century
- fox
) there ' s less here than meets tje eye
. or
, put it this way
, if you throught madonna was awful in
" shanghai surprise
,
" mariah carey ' s worse in this reworking of
" a star is born
.
" she plays billie frank who
, despite being abandoned by her singer
/ alcoholic mother
( valerie pettiford
)
, believes she ' s destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is
.
" you ' ve got this amazing gift
,
and you gotta use it
,
" her roommate syas
.
" your voice
- it ' s incredible
,
" syas anyother singer
.
" i ain ' t never met anyone like you
,
" proclaims julian
" dice
" balck
( max beesley
)
, the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali
- like producer
/ lover
. problem is
: her signature song
,
" i didn ' t mean to turn you on
" is wretched
.
and whn she fumes outloud of filming her first music video because the director wnats to
" exploitate
" her by haveing her wear a bikini
, the audience bursts into laughter
. exploit mariah carey
, who chooses to wear as littel as tyhe law will allow
? come on
! writer kate lanier ' s scirpt isnt fatuous
annd director vondie curtis
- hall doesn ' t have a clue how to handle tghe glitzy pop diva
and
, as a result of thier incompetance
, whispery
- voice ' d ms
. carey seems to be embarrased onthe
- screen
. she almost cringes when the camera comes infront for a close
- up
, pursing her lips
and averting her glassy eyes
. talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept
,
annd as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline
, htere ' s an audible audience groan when the twin towers of yhe world trade center come into veiw
. perhaps one of the reasons ms
. carey suffered her highly
- publicized nervous breakdown this summer isnt because she saw a preview of this clunker
. onthe the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" glitter
" is a pathetic 1
. right now
, it ' s tops onthe my list of the worst of 2001
.
