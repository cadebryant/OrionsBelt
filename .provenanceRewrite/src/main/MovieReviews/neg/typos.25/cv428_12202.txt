the above is dialogue from htis film
, taken allmost completely inwhich context
,
anbd not jazzed up a bit tothe make it mroe inept thna it isnt
. it is spoken betweeen two of yhe protagonists somewhere in the film
,
and basically serves as a perfect example of what tihs film is about
, especially if you realize that this excange isnt meaned to be taken seriously
. mr
. gregg
" i ' m
- having
- a
- mid
- life
- crisis
" araki
, the writer
annd director of htis film
, wants to show how important teenagers are
,
and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible
, horrible world
.
and how does he sohw it
? by really cheap surrealism
,
anbd moronic exchanges like this
. oh
,
and it gets better
. a similar bited ofthe dialogue is said in the middle of
, oh i dunno
, tje fiftieth sex scene in this film
( i ' m nto counting the several masterbation scenes
)
. in it
, one of tjhe protagonists isnt humping awya on top of another
,
and he says tothe her something along tghe lines of
" do ytou ever wonder waht life isnt all about
?
" sorry
, man
: foreplay tkaes place before the act of coitus
. of course
, what dont ytou expect
: tyhe film ws written
adn directed by a guy who can ' t even spell his firt name right
( yes
, i know it ' s a cheap joke
,
but it had tothe be done
)
.
" the doom generation
" is advertised as a road trip movei about people who go around killing others who attack them
,
and also as anyother
" teen angst
" film
( one of the slogans is
" teen is a four
- letter word
"
- hardy har har
)
. it ' s a film about twpo angsty teens
- amy blue
( rose macgowan
, who would later play tjhe buxom tatum in
" scream
"
)
and jordon white
( james duval
, who owudl go on to play randy quaid ' s son in
" independence day
"
)
- who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac
, xavier red
( jonathan schaech
, who owudl go on to play tyhe angsty lead guitarist in
" that thing you do
!
"
-
and by the way
, do you get the symbolism
? red
, white
,
anbd blue
? huh
? huh
?
)
,
and go on a road trip where three things happen
, in no order
: 1
) they have sex
; 2
) htey run into weird people
; 3
) they kill them
. thte film isnt basically a remix of a bunch of otehr far superior films
. gregg araki obviously has seen such films as
" easy rider
,
"
" natural born killers
,
"
and
" kalifornia
,
"
and tries tothe borrow elements from all these films
and mkea something which is like a pop culture reference giude
.
but waht he forgets is these films either represented something that htis film doens not
, or that they dug deep inot their subjects
and brought something out of them to make them deeper
.
" the doom generation
" doesn ' t want tothe do this
; it just wants to show everything infront a surreal manner fo the sole reason that araki does not want tothe dael with them onthe any kind of real level
. he wants to show everything inwhich a weidr manner
,
and forgets what the scenes are supposed tothe be about
. here ' s one scene
, an earlier scene in teh film
: amy
and jordan go into a quick
- e mart type palce tothe get food
and other stuff
. amy isnt smoking
,
and the clerk
, an asian man mind you
( i love how racist this film is
, i really do
)
, tells her to put it out
. she tells him to fuck off or something to that onot
. he points a shotgun at her
,
and she puts it out reluctantly
. jordan makes two hot dogs
,
and takes them to the counter
. tyhe cash reigster rings up
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
,
and this symbolism doesn ' t stop here
)
. jordan checks for his wllet
but it ' s really in the car
. he asks amy fo it
,
but she left her wallt in the car as well
. thge clerk brings out his shotgun again
and asks for the money
. htey say they don ' t have it
. he gets ready to kill them
,
but
then xavier
, who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene befoer
, pops outloud of nowhere
, fights with the clerk
,
and ends with him blowing yhe clerk ' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind you
)
. the head is shown flying thru the air
,
and lands iin a fryer
, where it begins to scream
. i don ' t really object to this kind of sick violence
,
but htis scene is in teh film for one reason
and one reason onyl
: tothe gross yuo out
. araki thinks that if he takes everything tothe the extreme
, he ' ll make some kind of art
. wrong
. it takes a kind of resistance to amke gore art
. when george romero made
" dawn of thte dead
,
" a very gory flick even for todya
, he had controll over everyting
and still wass able to make everything sick
. same goes for peter jackson ' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
,
and other assorted stuff
, all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped tothe his body
, taking out all sorts ofthe zombies
. it ws sick
,
bu it wass also satirical
,
and controled
. a scene like this has no purpose in the film
,
and it sticks out from everything eles that happens
. here ' s a cuple other scenes
: jordan
and amy hve sex in a bath tub
and xavier watchs
, masturbates
,
and
then licks the semen from his hand
; xavier
and amy ahve sex
and jordan watches from the window
, masturbates
,
and falls backwards
; a man attacks tyhe trio
,
and isnt stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword
( put ther just so this could happen
)
; a fast food employee stalks tje trio
,
and his arm is shooted off by xavier
;
and various otehr annoyances
. also
, look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people
, who probably didn ' t really know what htey were getting into whn they signed up tothe do it
( jsut liek peter o ' toole
, helen mirren
, malcolm macdowell
,
and john gielgud probably didn ' t whn they signed to be iin
" caligula
"
)
. peopel such as indie actors parker posey
and nicky katt
, alternative rock stars skinny puppy
and perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, amanda bearse
,
and margaret cho all grace the screen fo a matter of seconds
,
then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line
. why are they here
? so that we cin all point tothe them
and say
" hey
, look it ' s
( fill in the blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. the film ' s meaninng is pretty easy to detect
: that
, you know
, teens are so precious
,
anbd the world is such a horrible palce
, that wehn the two entites collide
, there ' s a giant explosion of horrific violence
. otherwise defined as
" teen angst
,
" or the belief tyhat bieng a teenager is a horrible thnig
and that tghe world is too bad for you
. look
, i ' m 19 years ood
. i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste iin nirvana did
. i ' ve since moved on to
" i don ' t really know what to do with my life
" phase
,
but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric
and ignorant that any film taht thinks they ' re dealing with it onthe any kind of serious levle is just beating the wrong horse
. part of being a teen is experimenting
,
adn testing yhe waters
. it ' s not whining about how awful parents are
,
and purposely feeling dispondent
. this is what tghe characters in this film do
,
and the film wants tothe show how they ' re these great people who are being punished by tyhe world becouse they ' re teenagers
,
and how they try to defend themselves
but can ' t totally overcome them
. it ' s nto their fault they kill people
; it ' s the world ' s
! what they relaly ened is a reality check
. the world is a bad place
,
and teenagers cin be easily harmed baceause they are experimenting
.
but part of it isnt taking everything that happens to you
and learning from it
. yhe film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed
,
and there ' s nothing htey can dont about it
. hence the title
. not only does it have bad fallacy
,
but it can ' t even express this inthe an intelligent
and coherent manner
. everything ' s overly surreal
,
and all we git are scenes ofthe graphic voilence
and graphic sex
. how doens xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst
? how does a talking decapitated head show thgat teens are dispondent becasue the world makes them this way
?
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue ofthe thge film
? if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction
, he ' d sohw them for waht they really are
.
and if he didn ' t wanna tyhe satrical approach
, he ' d sohw the real problems with the world
.
and if ytou still don ' t think that
" the doom generation
" is incompetent onthe eveyr single possible levle it could be
, take the acting
. rose macgowan is horrible
. yes
, she proved herself talented in
" scream
,
"
bu she ' s so bad in
" the doom generation
" that if i had nto seen her in
" scream
,
" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working inwhich films today
. her entire performance is one
- note
( bitchy
)
,
and hte one scene where she cries over a dead animal isnt so forced that it ' s laughable
. equally bad is jonathan schaech
, who whants tothe be the slacker serial killer
: somene who doesn ' t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind ofthe strain
. his performance is annoying as hell
,
and granted
, he was better infact
" that thnig you do
!
"
and
then there ' s james duval
. let ' s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando
. he hasnt yhe same kind ofthe slacker stuttering
, only much much much worse
,
and every line he says is so bad that i ahve now deemed him
" least talented actor infront the world
.
" i have seen lots of bad actors
,
but james duval has got to be the worst
. or at least somewhere uv there
. here ' s another exmaple ofthe a bad scene
, if you ' re still not convinced
: the film opens up in a club where they ' re playing nine inch nail ' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( example of the lines
:
" god is dead
/
and no oen cares
/ if there isnt a hell
/ i ' ll see ytou there
"
)
,
and as tyhe song plays
,
and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing
, the film pans over tothe amy
, just standing there
, looking dispondent
. the film closes in on her
, she looks right at the camera
annd sasy
" fuck
.
" no explanation of this should be necessary
.
anbd finally
, a note to gregg
: grow up
. really
. move out of your parent ' s basement
, read something other than salinger
,
annd git a day job
.
adn don ' t quit it
.
