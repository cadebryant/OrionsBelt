. review
: there is oney reason why
" jurassic park iii
" is better thna its immediate precedessor
,
" tghe lost world
: jurassic park
"
. the latter wasted 129 mintues of my life
; the former
, only 94
. the frist
" park
" was a marvellous film
, full of awe
- inspiring sights
, interesting charachters
,
and genuine thrills
. its twpo successors have been pale imitations
, amounting tothe hundred
- million
- dollar b
- grade horror movies
. at least this third entry realises it
; whereas
" tghe lost world
" tried to justify its existnece with a ludicrous
and overextended plot
,
" jurassic park iii
" simply sticks its cahracters on an island with a bunch ofthe dinosaurs
and lets the mayhem begin
. htere is a desperate sense ofthe deja vu presiding over this movie
; the computer
- animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting
,
annd even teh first
- time presence ofthe aerial lizards scarcely improves yhe situation
. rember tht wondrous frist trolley ride thru the park in teh orginial movei
? nothing inthe this rehash even comes close
. add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman
, payne
and taylor
,
annd phoned
- inspite performances by the normally capible macy
and leoni
,
and it is difficult tothe recommend hte film to anyone
but dino enthusiasts
. at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity ofthe his chracter
,
and there is much less gore tahn inwhich
" the lost world
"
, mkaing this installment more suitable for children
.
