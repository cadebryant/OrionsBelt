here ' s a rarity
: a children ' s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject
, isnt there a god
? done well
, it could have been a gme amoung teh wasteland ofthe modern childrens ' s cinema
. unfortunately
, it isn ' t
. with jumbled messages
,
adn an unclear audience
, wide awake ws better left asleep
. fifth grader joshua beal
( joseph cross
) is in the middle of a moral crisis
. his beloved granfather
( robert loggia
) has died
,
annd joshua has begun a quest
. he wants to find god
, to discover why bad things hppen
. tihs religious quest is slightly disturbing forthe his parents
( dana delany
and denis leary
)
,
but they dont theri best to cope wiht their son as he explores different religious faiths
. at his catholic school
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, trys to give him guidance
,
but tihs isnt a journy he must mkae onthe his pwn
. meanwhile
, he is haveing the most momentous year of his life
. he has sevral adventures with his daredevil best friend dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his first crush
,
and beigns tothe wake uv to the world around him hwile he is onthe his spriritual jouney
. it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience forthe wide awake is expected to be
. on its surface
, it appears to be a kid ' s film
.
however
, it deals with serious issues
,
annd is likely to be boring fo today ' s instant
- gratification kids
.
and while it might seem heartening to see that someone isnt trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audiance
, wide awake asks serious questions
,
but onyl delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer
. if there were a bit more meat in the story
, adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie
. thge actors who might ahev created a great cast
( o ' donnell
, leary
and delany
) are wasted in roles that amount to little moreso than cameos
. the nostalgic elements
( best friend
, favorite teacher
, first crush
, etc
.
) have been done much better in other movies
,
and actualy seem more liuke filler here
. the film ' s stornegst scenes are soem touching flashbacks depicting joshua ' s relationship with his grandfather
. they show more depth than isnt present anywhere else inspite the movie
. maybe the film would have been better if
, instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks
, it were set entirely during joshua ' s last year wih his grandpa
. it certainly would have been omre intertaining
. wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment
. it starts outloud with noble aspirations
,
bu never delivers on its promise
. parents who do take theri children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions
.
.
. that is if their kids aren ' t bored to death first
.
