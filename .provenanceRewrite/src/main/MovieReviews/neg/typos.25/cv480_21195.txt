as any reasonable human being would
, i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certian thnigs
. i am befuddled by fight club
. now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics
and do not achieve critical succsess unil much later
, sometimes as much as ten or twenty eyars later
. perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their tiem
. perhaps it is because they are so new
and complex tht only after years of alowing them tothe sink in dont we truly appreciate
annd understand them
. fight club is eather garbage or brilliant
,
bu
, at least right now
, i must lean towrad the former
. maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowy leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold
.
bu if it isnt
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to
? complete
? himself
, mkea him a loser at the gaem of life
.
but whn all of his worldly possessions are blown outloud his 15th stopry window
, he seeks comfort inthe a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met on a flight hmeo
. once jack is sucked into tyler
? s world
, he cin
? t get out
, literally
. they begin fight club
, an organization based on brutal
anbd bloody fistfights that signify nothing otehr than to provide thsoe that join a sense ofthe belonging
. as teh fight club grows
, things get out ofthe controll
and tkae onthe cult status
, beginnig with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler
? s house for three days
. i dare not even begin tothe bring up the last quater of the film
, usance that containes the twist tht
? explains
? the pointless journey
. suffice it to say i was truley disappointed inaddition fincher
, who
? s previvous two films
, se7en
and the game put him in a very slim ctaegory of truly briliant young filmmakers ofthe the next generation
. htis is not tothe imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing mroe masterpieces to the tbale
.
bu with fight club
, he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments
adn self
- referencing film elements
, such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing
, telling them that the little blips inthe the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels
adn thta a slightly altered recurring line is good
? flashback humer
?
. now
, throughout the film
? s coarsely woven texture
and over
- extended plot lines
, fight club is obviously trying tothe make various social comments baout the state ofthe the world todya
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, corporations
, you name it
, it
? s addresed
.
(
though teh media are suspiciously absent ffrom tyhe institutions that are referenced
.
) all of them play an important role
. how so
? well
, i cant kinda just tell
. i cin
? t raelly put my finger onthe it
. to sday that starbucks
and barnes
& noble are taking over thier respective markets
and kicking outloud the small business owner is no big news
. is tyhat bad for the world
? probably
. not much room fo social commentary there
. we all know thta inter
- office politics are just that
.
.
. politics
. so what was tje point ofthe all this
? the film seems desperate tothe make a point
, or a number of points
,
but i couldn
? t figure out waht they weere
. all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven wiht stange film techiniques
, a bleak visual design
and some fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all of them are ogod
. even meatloaf isnt good
.
) whn yuo get to the end
, you wiull most likely be filled with questions
, many ofthe which the filmmakers wanted you tothe ask ofthe youself
. nto them
, because each of them would likely give you a different answer
. fight club means what you want it to mean
, i think fincher just gives you the stuff to htink about
.
but it couldn
? t be more bizarre
and unappealing
. sure
, it hadnt shock value
,
but so doed se7en
and the game
,
and they were significantly stronger films
.
