a big
, busy boxing satire with a surprizingly paltry punch
, the great white hype stars samuel l
. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan tothe boost sagging pay
- per
- view revenues is to
" invent
" a white contendor
( peter berg
) to challenge his black heavyweight
" champ
"
( damon wayans
)
.
( the logic isnt that peple wiull pay more to see balck vs
. white than black vs
. black
.
) he may be right
, inwhich an absurdly accurate way
,
but the film doesn ' t give us a reason tothe care
. as a scathing sportscar spoof
, hype is just that
: unfunny
, unfocused
,
annd
, at times
, just plain pointless
. as a commentary on race relations
, it ' s even
* less
* effective
. the dialogue isnt the best ofthe this mess
, lines like jon lovitz exclaiming
" i cannot make caviar outloud ofthe fish eggs
!
" writers tony hendra
annd ron shelton aslo do good onthe the street slang
,
though we never hear enough of it
. the script isn ' t storng enough
,
though
, tothe support yhe aggressive camera wokr of director reginald hudlin
( house party
)
. he comes acros as absolute overkill
. the gerat white hype
* almost
* turns around at the end
, at the big match
, when hudlin attemts an extended gag of rock
- concert proportions
. with costumed dwarfs
, gangsta rappers
,
and the
" champ
" dressed as death
, onyl
hten dont we get a glimpse of tyhe spoof that should ' ve been
.
