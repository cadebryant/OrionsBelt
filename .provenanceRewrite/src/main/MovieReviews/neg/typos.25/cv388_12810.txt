ugh
. that about sums this movei uv
. jstu
, ugh
. thge orginal godzilla movies are somewhat ofthe a cult classic
,
and when reviewing the previvous films
, each film hadnt a certain degree ofthe intelligence
.
and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following
; inthe spite of bad speshal effects
, horrible dubbing
,
and a man in a lizard suit
, they maintained a certian degree of
.
.
. how to put this
?
.
.
. dignity
? not quite the word i ' m looking for
. you understand
, right
?
and in 50 years
, godzilla has maintained that degree ofthe ' whatever '
. leave it tothe amercia to screw the hwole thing up
.
> from the ' geniuses ' thta broght us
" independece day
"
, arguably teh worst sci
- fi movie of all tiome
, tothe ruin whatever reputation godzilla had
. while tehy do bring us eye
- popping special effects that will amaze you
, htey lost what was at tyhe center ofthe all the original godzilla movies
-
- a storyline
. summing up hte movie is simple
. heck
, i cxan do it in one sentence
: giant lizard attacks a giant city
annd a bunch of nobodies stop it
. simple as thta
. matthew broderick stumbles over his lines
,
and it ' s hard to picture hank azaria infact any role besides his classic dog
- walking character on the televsion show
" mad about ytou
"
. the dialogue seems tothe be improvized
, almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all
. i cant see the scene on the set right now
.
" all right
! we spent all ofthe this money making big special effects
,
and we ' ve gotta git this movie outloud by summer or it ' s going to bomb in our faces
. so
, you actors just sday whta ever comes to the top ofthe your head
, all right
? make up something
, m ' kay
? good
. roll film
!
!
" the special effects are enought to keep you interested through oney viewing
,
anbd some ofthe the cinemtography is well
- done
( the scene with tjhe black umbrellas comes to mind
)
. still
, an hour inot it
, you will become antsy
, wondering how long they can drag it outloud
.
and drag it out tehy dont
!
! i hvea to laff
. the slogan for tghe film is
,
" size does matter
"
. i think they cut this too short
. it should read
,
" size does marter
. acting does not
.
