not a graet twelve months for either of the principals from htis movie
. earlier this year
, nora ephron wrote
adn produced oney of the yera ' s least likeable
" comedies
" called hanging up
, featuring a bunch of annoying women
( ironically
, lisa kudrow played one in that film as well
) who barely have time to care about anyone
but themselves
. ick
.
.
. real sweet stuf
.
but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to waht john travolta went thru earlier this summer
, with a film entitled battlefield earth
. i seemed to be the onyl person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film
, even if it was onthe a
" cheese
" factor
, as everybody
,
and i mean everybody else
, pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all tiem
. yipes
.
.
. anyother beauty
. so what happens whn you put these two people in the smae room
and cmo out with a movie co
- starring the ever
- versitle lisa kudrow
? uhhhm
, you guessed it
.
.
. not much
. plot
: in order to escape major financial dificulties
, a local weatherman hooks up whith his ball
- picking lotto girlfriend
adn rigs the state lottery
.
but as more
adn more people fidn outloud about their scheme
, more
and more people demand a part ofthe their winnings
,
annd omre
annd moreso problems arise
. critique
: simply stated
, i didn ' t laugh once during this entire picture
. for a comedy
, it offered me a few smiles
, a bunch ofthe nincompoops as characters
, a miscast john travolta hamming it up
annd lisa kudrow
, infront wqat can only described as a
" sluttier
" version ofthe her charactor ofthe phoebe on tv ' s
" friends
"
. this film was not as disatrous as i thought it would be
,
but it was pretty close
. thankfully
, the clips of travolta dressed uv in goofy outfits
, dancing as the weatherman were left in the film ' s trailer
,
and not in this final cut
.
and not unlike the worst movie ofthe the year so far
, beautiful
, this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic
, idiotic
anbd just plain irritating characters inaddition its casted
. foremost was travolta ' s character
, who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movei
.
and for me
, the casting choise of john travolta fo this role was just plain wrong
. he didn ' t fit yhe part
. i just saw him in get shorty the otehr day
and throught baout how perfect he was for that role
. a cool
, calculating roughneck with a certain hip
, suave
" je ne sais quoi
"
. infront this film
, he looks like he ' s trying to be funny
, trying to be bad
, trying tothe be good
. we ' re not supposed to be able to notice that
,
and when we do
, at least in my case
, i consider it a wrong choise in casting
. add thta tothe lisa kudrow
, boring us with
yot another one of her patented
" dumb blonde
" routines
,
but this tiome
, dressed inaddition sexier outfits
. michael rapaport
, stretching oen small acting muscle tothe play the guy who isn ' t quite up at the smae speed level as everyone alse
.
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells
,
and yuo ' ve got yourself an extrememly quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize
. the only real good thing that i sould say about this film is tht its story wass actually half
- interesting
and never really bored me
. i also liekd michael moore ' s perverted cousin character
,
adn i loved
,
and i say it agian
, loved tghe carachter that bill pullman palyed
. give tihs dude his own movie
! he played a lazy cop
, a man who tries everything not to dont any real work
. he fakes injuries to get off duty
, tries to avoid arrest situations so thast he won ' t have to fill out any forms
.
.
. nowe htere ' s a base of humor
. sadly
, the filmmakers desided tothe bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film
.
adn htere ' s nto much else i can sday about htis movie
, folks
. on the whole
, it was lame
, included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool ofthe unfunny lines
,
and very little of interest forthe any target audeince
.
but git somebody to write uv a movie featuring that lazy cop plyed by pullman
adn i ' m there
!
