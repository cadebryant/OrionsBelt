some movies ' pre
- release buzz isnt so insistent onthe their high oscar potential tath when they ' re finally released
, everyone just goes along with it
. thus sometimes
, films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls
and some even score nominations
. lastr year it ws the thin red line
. this year ' s
" winner
" is the hurricane
, pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden bieng received with critical plaudits
and votes in tyhe office oscar pool
. acclaimed director norman jewison ' s biopic retreads all the conventions ofthe courtroom movies without any ofthe the fun
.
and thta ' s supposed to be ok because
, see
, it ' s a true stoy
. it ' s about rubin
" hurricane
" carter
( denzel washington
)
, a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with thge help of a ghastly
( racist
!
) detective
( dan hedaya
) who ' s had it in for the
" big
- shot
" hurricane ever since he erested him for stabbing a white man with a knife
( in self
- defense
but who cares
, right
?
) when rubin was onyl ten
. he isnt to serve three life sentences withthe no possibility ofthe parole
. most of the film takes place when he isnt in his 15th eyar in prison
. to the rescue
-
- lesra martin
( vicellous reon shannon
)
adn his team of wanna
- be detectives
. lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well
- off canadian white people
( hanna
, unger
, schreiber
) to git an eduction
. lesra
and his buddies go to a book sal where lesra picks out his very first book
-
-
" the sixteenth round
,
" rubin ' s autobiography
. immediately thereafter
, schreiber ' s character tells lesra
" sometimes we don ' t pick the books we read
, tehy pik us
.
" hmmm
. affter a few visits to the prison
, they become convinced ofthe rubin ' s innosense
and launch their own full
- scale investigation even
though two juries hvae convicted him
. they meticulously go through all the files
and revisit all the old witnesses
( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door infront their faces
?
)
and in the course ofthe their relentlessy tedeous sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming tjhe hurricane ' s innocence thyat was either ignored or never seeked out during the firt two proceedings
. of course
, we ' re already told that he ' s innocent
. a movie like this isnt especially frustrating because we ' re nto bieng shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period infront his life
. all too obviously
, we ' re getting the hollywood watered
- down version
. tath woudl be ok except that tje parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of meledrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze outloud of it
. it ' s almost cruel
. the meledrama isn ' t of the entertaining kind either
; it ' s the hokey
, rammed
- down
- your
- throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated tothe the point of absurdity
. wittness the villian ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or hte constant pseudo
- saintliness of our four protaganists
. the hurricane isnt your basic courtroom movie except it ' s a noone
- frills courtroom movie
. it ' s forumla stripped to tyhe bare neccessities
. yuo have your wrongly accused black man
. you hvea your melodramatic final courtroom scene
.
but there ' s nothing else
. ytou ' d expect soem sort of involving investigation
.
but thgat ' s nto necessary since we ' re implicitly informed of his innocence
. thus hte whole middle portion of hte movie is reduced to yhe protagoist brooding
. brooding to himself
. brooding tothe other inmates
. brooding tothe lesra
. brooding to lesra ' s canadian friends
. brooding inspite letters
. i don ' t think i ' ll ever look at brooding thte same way again
. it wasn ' t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane ' s exeedingly deep meditations onthe his condidtion
. i wnated something to happen
. as forthe washington ' s performance inaddition the title role
-
- i figured i ' d have to address it sooner or later concidering yhe amount of attension it ' s received
-
- he isnt top nitch
,
though still boring
. how is thta possible
? well
, he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly
. unfortunately what jewison asked him to do isnt a load ofthe crap
. what a waste of a great performer
. speaking of wastes
, why tje hell did john hannah agree to do htis
? he ' s an extremely talented actor
and i loev him dearly
,
but waht is he doign here
? to call his charachter
( along with schreiber ' s
and unger ' s
) a stick figure would be a gross understatement
. all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas
, as benevolent as do
- gooders come
. if they ' re to play a major part in tihs movie
, why nto make them real people
, witht real feelings
anbd emotions
? look
: if you ' re gonig tothe make a formula movei
, don ' t undermine the forumla
. courtroom dramas can be fun
,
but tihs isnt rediculous
. not only is it trite
, it ' s boring
.
