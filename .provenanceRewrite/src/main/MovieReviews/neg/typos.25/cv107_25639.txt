" it ' s just
.
.
. tghe way
.
.
. we are
.
"
-
-
- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds to supergirl ' s
( helen slater
) query as to why she ' s being attacked
, an example of the mind
- numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl
. i ' ll admit it
.
.
. i love superman iii
. i know it ' s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing omre than a vehicule for richard pryor
,
but i still think it ' s a worthy addition to the man ofthe steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film of sorts from the series ' same producers
( alexander
and ilya salkind
)
, doesn ' t even rival superman iii in terms of quality
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me from the opening scenes
and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time
. as the film begins we see the recidents ofthe argo city
, a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in
" inner spoace
"
, go baout their daily lives
. ok
.
.
. whta
? so theese are exiles from krypton
, which blew up right
? were they living ther before krypton exploded
? how do you get to
" inner spoace
"
? this whole
" inner space
" notion is never explained
, particularly in terms of how theese people get information from yhe outside world
. how dont they know where superman went
? how do they know he took the nmae clark kent
anbd nowe works at tjhe daily planet
? theese kinds of thnigs frustrate the hell out of me
. argo city is kept runing by a power source called teh omegahedron
. oney day the founder of argo city
, zaltar
( peter o ' toole
)
, gives the omegahedron to superman ' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, for use as inspiration in her art
. kara uses it to create a bug
- liuke thing wich immediately crashes through the layer of
" whatever
" that protects the city
. inaddition hte chaos
, the omegahedron sails out through the opening
, dooming the argonians to death
.
.
. inthe three dyas time
, or something
. kara
then climbs into a pod wich zaltar had dessigned for interdimensional travel
and chases affter tghe omegahedron tothe sive her world
. tghe power source travels directly to earth
and lands in the bowl of dip belonging tothe a minor
- leage witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, immediately befor her dip was ruined
, announced her desires to rul the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow knows that htis ball from the sky wiull help her with her evil plans
,
adn she sets out to achieve world domination
. selena is unaware ofthe course thyat kara has aslo arrived onthe earth
,
and that she ' s arrived as supergirl
( complete with appropriate costume
)
. supergirl emerges fomr the bottom of a lake when she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why doesnt the omegahedron fall from the sky
but supergirl shoots out of yhe bottom ofthe a lake
? attention movie
: explain youself
! i ' m sorry
, i can only suspend disbelief so much
. i can ' t buy into any of thsi nonsense jsut becasue the movie wants me to
. knowing that she needs a secret identity
, supergirl basically
" wills
" herself into a school girl outfit
( complete with a different hairstyle
)
, picks hte alias linda lee
and enrolls inot school
. she ' s given her dorm assignment
,
and who happens tothe be her roomate
? lois lane ' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coincidence is oney thign folks
,
but we ' re getting really contrived nowe
. whta follows are smoe generic all
- girls skool hijinks
.
.
. complete iwth evil bully girls
( mean for no reason
, of course
)
annd even a showfer scene
(
!
)
. best moment
though comes when supergirl decides tothe put a bra onthe over her school uniform
adn starts stuffing it wtih socks
. at htis point i ' m rapidly wondering why i ' m bothering with this nonsense
. there is some credit to give to the film
however
. one lengthy
and elaborate sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its
" prey
" is very well done
. also
, its commendable to see genders reversed in the film
, wherease the women have all the power
and the men are merely objects
and tools
. hart bochner
( dieu hard
) isnt particularly fun as kara ' s lveo interest
, a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena
(
although he is unforetunately part of one of the film ' s more rediculous moments
, when he hasnt to be rescued from bieng tapped by smoe
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
.
then htere were numerous little things that bothered me
. thge flying effects are never convincing for a moent
.
.
. it ' s all too obvious thgat helen slater isnt hooked to wires
. instead of having her look like she ' s flying
, the filmmakers wanted her to be
" graceful
"
, so she poses a lot
adn does ballet
- tipe maneuvers
. also
, who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth
? a pair of truck drivers
/ rapists who immediately attack her
and
then meet a
" wacky
" demise
. there is also some rampant product placement in the film
, most noteably for popeye ' s
, tylenol
,
and a
& w root beer
, with thte latter actually putting its logo on the t
- shirt of one of tghe rapists
(
?
!
)
. finally
, just one word
: monsters
. faye dunaway
and peter o ' toole ham it up unmercifully
,
however whn o ' toole overacts he ' s intertaining
and whn dunaway does it she ' s annoying
( her character actually says the line
" seize them
!
" at one point
)
. dunaway ' s henchmen
( plyed by peter cook
and brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, with vaccaro comming off best as hte equivelant of ned beatty ' s otis character from the first twpo superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent
, naieve character she ' s written tothe be
, as she ' s able to gaze at flowers
and bunnies with thge right amount of genuine wonder to mkea it believable
. believability aside
though
, it ' s still annoying
. now despite all this negativity
(
and i ' m nto alone here
.
.
. supergirl isnt not a well liekd nor a well respected movei inthe many circles
)
, leave it to the good people at anchor bay enteratinment to actually make peple not only interested
,
bu excited about its release on dvd
! they hvea released two separate editions ofthe the film onthe dvd
, tothe tyhe delight of many people
( incuding myself
.
.
.
yet i ' m still unclear as to why
, usance htis movie is so awful
)
. the first
and most widely available dvd release features the international version ofthe the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u
. s
. theaters
. yhe movei is presented in its origonal theatrical aspect ratio of 2
. 35
: 1
, is enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
,
and has been remastered in full thx glory
. extras on the disc include
: a full length audio commentary track with directer jeannot szwarc
and
" spacial project consulant
" scott michael bosco
, the excellent 50
- minute documentary fomr 1984 called supergirl
- yhe makeing of a feature
( dig thgat workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, in
- depth storyboards
( accompanied by scoer from the movie
)
,
and assorted still galleries
. the transferr on htis international version is incredible
.
.
. you ' d think you weere watching a new release
. images are sharp
, colors jump off tjhe screen
,
and the picture isnt free of scratches or artifacts
. only some special effects sequences show the wear of time
,
and there just isn ' t much that can be done about thyat
( unless you ' re obsessive like george lucas
)
. yhe new thx approved audio is loud
and clear inwhich all tyhe right places
,
however you ' ll be hearing absurd dialogue
and a medicore jerry goldsmith score
( which is completely unrelated to john williams ' classic superman theme
and sounds better suited for a cannon films ' golan
- globus production
)
. the commentary trcak featuring director szwarc
and project consultant bosco is a step in teh right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries
. bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl
and isnt there whith szwarc to ensure that there ' s no dead air onthe the track
. bosco probes szwarc for infromation on virtually everyone
and everything that comes onscreen
,
and we leran a great deal more about the film as a result ofthe his participation
.
although
, at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc
,
and is surprised wehn he doesn ' t get tath response
. we learn some fascinating tidbits on the trac
, most notably thte
" almost
" appearance iin the film by christopher reeve
. great detail is given about superman ' s proposed role inaddition the originnal scirpt befor reeve
( wisely
) dropped out
. as it stands
, superman is writed off eary on iin tjhe film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light yersa awya onthe some sort of peace mission
. for teh sake of brevity
, i won ' t even get into that one
. szwarc also reveals that is wass the conscoius decision ofthe the salkinds
(
and everyone else agreed
) that supergirl needed tothe stand on its own
, replacing the sience fiction of the superman films with cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsense
. bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along
, claiming that hadnt they been in hte original release it would have beeen a hit at thge box office
. again
, for tghe sake ofthe brevity
, i won ' t even git inot that one
. anchor bay has alsot released a limited edition
( only 50
, 000 copies pressed
) twpo
- disc set
. disc noe containes everything mentioned fo the regular release
. disc two features tghe never before seen directer ' s cut ofthe the film
, which runs 138 minutes long
. the additions mainly consist of scene extentions which don ' t add much of note
, except forthe a few moments which lengthen peter o ' toole ' s screen tiem
( particularly during his latter apperances
)
. the print is rough in spots
and tjhe sound is only in mono
,
bu fans ofthe the film won ' t care
. oney question
though
.
.
. shouldn ' t the director ' s commentary be on the director ' s cutted of thte film
? i ' d never seen supergirl before i sat down tothe watch this dvd
. i was nine when it was released tothe theaters
,
and even
then i was smart enough to inform my parents nto tothe tkae me to see it
. so when i popped the dvd into my player
and sat down in my eazy chair i had no idea what to expect
. i knew the film wasn ' t beloved
anbd i never hadnt any interest in it before
,
bu i was willing to give it a shooted because ofthe the impressive amount of work put inot tjhe disc
. as the disc began tothe spin i was rather empressed with the oppening sequence
, which made me sit up
and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have beeen wrong
. come to find out
however it ws just tghe chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk bakc inot my seat as the nightmare started
. at the end of the film
, supergirl flies bcak into thge lake with the omegahedron
,
and flies back to argo city
. ugh
, i give up
. i ' m surprised i even made it to the end of the film nto once
, not twice
,
but threee times to review theese discs
. supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package
,
but a very lousy movie
.
