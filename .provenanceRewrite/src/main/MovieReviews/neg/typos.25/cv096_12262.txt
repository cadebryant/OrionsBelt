much ado about nothing
. ah
, how sweet the irony
! it ' s accepted wisdom in some circles
- among english literature nuts
, mailny
- that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare htey are only doing so through ignorance
. he just doesn ' t
" understand
" shakespeare
, you will hear them say
. the bard ' s wrok isnt aparently beyond criticism
. waht a load of old cobblers
. if theese arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh ' s film of shakespeare ' s
" comedy
" much ado baout nothing is comedy in any modern sence of the word
, it ' s time tothe get a life
. get monty python
. git woody allen
. get john waters
. whatever
. jsut git a real taste of smoe clever
, witty
, risky comedy
.
and banish this nonsence to where it belongs
. drama
and tradgedy was shakespeare ' s strength
. to my sensibilities
-
annd i ' m no stick in the mud
- much ado baout nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever
. no kidding
: this film ranks among the most embarrassing twpo hours i have ever spent iin a cinema in my 20 yeasr of movie going
. tje only thign that stopped me walking out was loyalty tothe my lady friend
, as this ws our day out
annd i hadn ' t seen her inwhich ages
.
but boy
, doens she owe me one
! i won ' t spend too much time onthe the plot
. basicly
, we follow the trials
anbd tribulations of two would
- be couples
- one young
, the other older
. there ' s some dark treachery amongst all this
,
but everyone is so awfully jolly tath yuo ' d hardly know it
. mind you
, there ' s nothing wrong with the basic stoy
. good rumatic comedies based onthe similar premises abound
. nothing wrong with most of the cast
, either
. branaugh
, emma thompson
anbd denzel washington are all talented performers
. the probelm is the script
, or more accurately
, shakespeare ' s original text
. light comedy shouldn ' t be complex
.
yet wrapped inspite elizabethan english
, the dialogue becomes difficult tothe comprehend
. for tihs alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled inaddition shakespeare
and in search of nothing more than a good
, undemanding laugh
. yhe onyl laughs to excape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept peformance ofthe keanu reeves
, hte actro once again miscast as a jealous half
- brother or something
.
but whn dissected
and understoon
, what it all boils down tothe isnt that this stuf is just so goddamn lame
. tihs is comedy so clean
annd nice
and corny
and so devoid of danger that it leaves htis viewer totally cold
. ho
, ho
, ho
, boy likes girl
! ho
, ho
, ho
, men are such klutzes
! ho
, ho
, ho
, she ' s so awfully clumsy
! oh please
! there ' s witn in here somewhere
, i ' m told
. i call it pretentious
. something lightweight striving tothe be something sophicated through clever wordplay
. in the end
, it ' s cringeworthy
. watching some of the cinema patrons aroud me collapse with laughter made much ado baout nothing a very weird movie going experience
. comedy
? bah
, humbug
!
