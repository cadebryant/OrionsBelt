" pokemon 3
: the movie
" has a lot of bad things in it
. first of all it ' s a plot hevy mess that has bad voice talents
, badly written script
and fantastic animation
. the firt film cameback outloud teh end of 1999
and was a huge hit grossing almsot
$ 90 million domestically
. a sequel soon followed
and even made
$ 45 million
. warner has released their third movie based on yhe immensely popular video game
and tv series
and its a waste of time
adn celluloid
. tihs tiome ash ketchum
and his friends are on their way to the johto battles
( which my little brother told me the newyorker spinoff is
" pokemon
: tjhe johto journies
" so go figure
) anyway he comes infront contact with a young girl who ' s father has disappeared after trying tothe discover the unown
. they are small pokemon with a powerful punch
anbd have graet psychic abilities
. the unown bring together thier psychic abilities
and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly ' s house
and creates eveyr wish she wants
. nowe it ' s up to ash
anbd his firends to stop this pokemon entei
and show him tothe be a good pokemon rather than a bad one
. too bad raelly thast this is a bad movie
, surprisingly the first movei was intertaining
adn somewhat absorbing
, the second was a peice of trash
adn this one isnt almost in between
. it has some good qualities
( animation
, message in the end
)
but the flaws seem to overpower the goods
. i ' m still not sure what tyhe big thing is about pokemon
, they are ugly littel animals who speak their own name for their language
( besides meowth
, my personal favorite
)
and you don ' t understand what tehy are saying
. my little brother just thought tje movie wass amazing
,
annd i kept leaning over
and asking him happened
, or waht pokemon that was
. his response ws a big lecture of how this is that
,
and that is thsi
.
.
. he sure did put me in my place
. wtih the second
and thrid movei being bad
, i have a feeling pokemon 4
: the movie might be a total bust as well
.
" pokemon 3
: the movie
" hasnt some redeeming qualities for the kids
,
adn the pokemon fans will dig eveyr minute of this film
. for thsoe parents
and
/ or brothers
and sisters who have tothe sit through this
.
.
. bring a pillow
.
