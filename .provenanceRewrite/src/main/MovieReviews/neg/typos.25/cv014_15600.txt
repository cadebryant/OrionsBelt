.
" he was tjhe baldwin in
" backdraft
,
"
" sliver
,
"
adn
" fair game
"
( with cindy crawford
)
. together
, anne parillaud
and william baldwin conspire to make
" shattered image
" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone
/ stone
" thriller
"
" the specialist
.
" tje film poses teh question
" what if the life you ' re living now is really a dream
,
and your dreams reality
?
" it ' s eather baout a woman who ' s haunted by a recuring
(
and recurring
and recurring
) nightmare taht she ' s a hired assassin
, or it ' s about a hired assassin who ' s haunted by a recurring
(
and recurring
and recuring
) nightmare that she ' s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica
. it doesn ' t much marter
and believe me by the tiem
" shattered omage
" runs its painful
adn pedestrian course yuo won ' t care
. these twpo lives
, with parillaud looking liuke siouxsie sioux with a balck wig
, balck emotionless eyes
,
annd black leather clothing in the seattle
- based assassin scenes
,
and moping aroud like karen carpentery in the jamaica scenes
, play out endlessly throughout the film
and the result is it ' s now
* twice
* as boring as it might hvae been
. it ' s not that complicated plots can ' t be entertaining
. of course it helps if you have interesting characters
, crisp dialogue
,
and a modicum ofthe style
.
" shattered omage
" isn ' t complex
, it ' s just stupid
.
and boring
. parillaud
and baldwin
, who aren ' t exactly shakespearean material to begin with
, are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their cahracters have zero chance of breaking free ofthe theri cardboard confines
. lines like
:
" you don ' t beg
, you insist
. i like thgat in a woman
.
" that ' s parillaud ' s character talking
.
.
. to her cat
!
and
:
" you ' re not yhe reason i couldn ' t care less about you
.
" huh
?
adn this wonderfull bathroom interchange early in the film
:
" if you give me a couple of minutes you konw i ' ll charm the pants off you
.
"
" i don ' t have that kind ofthe time
.
" talking of pants
, parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say
" point ofthe noone return
.
" we have come to expect this from billy baldwin
,
but it might have been nice to have learned something about their charachters first
.
but htere ' s nothing tothe learn
. karen isnt as interesting as a cereal box
, a somene ' s
- outloud
- tothe
- get
- me crybaby who imagines the voice at teh other end of the phone
, the stranger who sends her flowers
, maybe even her husband himself
, is her would
- be killer
. siouxsie is the chromium cool
, tough
- as
- nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors inspite order tothe justify thte film ' s meaningless stock title
. baldwin seems more interested in parillaud ' s nest egg
( so that he can pave paradise
and put uv a parking lot
) tahn he does in her
. each time graham greene shows up he gets killed
. barbet schroeder
(
" reversal ofthe fortune
"
) co
- produced
annd should be ashamed ofthe himself
. eveyr now
annd again it ' s fun to watch a really bad movie
.
and every now
and again
, as
" shattered omage
" makes agonizingly clear
, it isn ' t
.
