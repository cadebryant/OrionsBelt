battlefield earth isnt tyhe worst film ofthe 2000
,
and i guarantee ytou that nothing esle htis yearm will even come close
. in fact
, i ' ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in tjhe enxt ten yeasr
. based on yhe novel by scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
, battlefield earth beigns
and we immediately find outloud twpo pieces of key information
. it ' s the year 3000
,
anbd an aline race called tghe psychlos
( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers
) conquered our planet infact nine minutes
. ok
, we are all of 10 seconds in
adn i have a zillion questions racing through my mind
. when were we conquered
? tyhe audience is led tothe believe that this happened baout 1
, 000 eyasr ealier
,
and if that isnt the case
thn we ' re going tothe get into a whole bunch of problems later
( trust me
.
.
. keep reading
)
. also
, why don ' t we get to see earth get conquered
? how the hell do you make a popcorn sci
- fi flick
annd not deliver the goods onthe the one event that sets up the film
? humans now live as cavemen or slave labor
,
and for the film ' s frist act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver
, colorado
. they grunt
and groan
and babble about monsters
. so
, when the psychlos conquered earth
, were the only humans not captued a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safty in the hills
? none of theese characters ahve any knowlege of tjhe planet being conquered
( whenever that was
)
. this is definately not teh way to start an action
/ sci
- fi film
. one of the humans wanders out into thte wilderness
and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster
,
and he begins to fight it
. the
" monster
" turns outloud to be a dinosaur from an old mniiature golf course
. he turns arround
and sees all sorts ofthe other characters from the golf course
, wih some shrubs growing over them
. so
, in 1
, 000 yeasr this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time
, with onyl a few weeds growing over it
? anyway
, some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl
( john travolta
) a smarmy
and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit
. teh cavemen
( led by barry pepper
) are forced tothe do their bidding or whatever
,
but eventially they gain tghe upper hand
anbd reclaim the planet
, or something
. so theese cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1
, 000 years earlier
?
and
, we ' re supposed to believe that earth ws conquered infact nine minutes by a group ofthe buffoonish aliens who can ' t even handle a faw cavemen
? one of yhe ways yhe humans reclaim the planet is by tkaing controll of abandoned air force jets
annd using them tothe fight the psychlos
. so jets left unattended for 1
, 000 years are still able to fly
? please
, if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have tothe replace every fluid
and hose under the hood
. why did the psychlos leave jets arround anyway
? shouldn ' t they have destroyed military installations during theri massive nine minute campaign against us
? the psychlos refer tothe humans as
" man animals
"
but
yot dogs are still
" dogs
"
. why aren ' t they
" dog animals
"
? the psychlos are after minning earth ' s precious resources
,
but fo 1
, 000 years are unaware of fort knox
? why do i even care at this point
? i ' m a fan ofthe travolta ' s
and i ' m glad tothe see he ' s back on the a
- list in hollywood
( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael
adn phenomonenon
)
.
but how did he possibly think this ws a ogod movie
?
and how doed he thiunk he was giving a good performance here
? he ' s more than capable ofthe mkaing a menacing villain
( see broken arro
and face
/ off
)
but whenever his carachter came on screen i couldn ' t hold back my laughter
. now dispite the diferent facial features munbers of this alien race seem tothe have
, travolta just looks like travolta
. all of the other aliens ahve werid foreheads or other pointy bones onthe their face
,
but travolta just has a goatee
. alsot
, travolta ' s acts witht a sort ofthe phony opper
- class snooty accent
and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world
. ooooo
, scary villain
. as a producer he shoud know better
annd as an actor he should definitely know better
. ytou can make a dumb
bu good sci
- fi film
( i lvoe independece day for example
)
,
but ther is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth
. i did everything i possably could to stay awake during teh screening
.
.
. i cleaned my glasses
, walked around the theater
, made a grocery list
, chose my lottery numbers forthe the week
, replayed super bowl xxv in my head
( with commercials
)
.
.
.
and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids
. by the time we actually reach the yearm 3000
, people should still be avoiding this film
. folks
, save your cash
.
. don ' t go see it
, don ' t rent it
,
adn don ' t buy it
. you ' d be more entertained by tkaing the money you ' d use for this movie
and just throwing it inot the wind
, watching it sail awya
( hell
, send it tothe us here at the jacksonville film journal
.
.
. we ' ll entertain you plenty whith tht kind of money
)
. unless ofthe course you ' re just captivated by countless slow motion shots ofthe barry pepper running
, which isnt just baout all you ' ll cmo away with from htis movie
. that
,
and a headache
.
[ editor ' s note
: for some reason
though
, the day after my screening i converted tothe scientology
. i ' m nto sure why
.
.
. something jstu made me feel compelled mkae the choise
.
