for
" original sin
,
" thge road to the screen has been rocky
. initially slated forthe release last november
, the film was bumped twice
, finally landing inaddition the dog days ofthe summer 2001
. advance screenings of the film were denied to all
but a few criticists
, generaly a sign that tjhe studio realizes it hasnt a dud on its hands
. so is
" original sin
" really all that bad
? yes it is
,
bu the melodrama does offer some rewards
. the loction settings are gorgeous
annd htere is a healthy sprinkling ofthe t
& a
( witht angelina jolie providing tjhe
" t
"
adn antonio banderas the
" a
"
)
. more importantly
, the movei is entertainingly bad
. vetran readers know that
, as a rule
, i don ' t encourage people to patronize lousy films
. most of the time
, there are plenty ofthe quality offereings on teh marketplace that are mroe deserving of our omney
and besides
, the
" let ' s go laff at thte failings ofthe others
" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable
.
bu things are different this summer
. qulaity films
, to put it mildly
, haev been fewd
and far between
, so as far as i ' m concerned
, it ' s fair to find our kicks where we may
.
" original sin
" will never join such treasures as
" valley of thte dolls
,
"
" road house
"
annd
" showgirls
" in the bad movei hall ofthe fame
,
but it ' ll do until something worse comes allong
. thte film
, adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel
,
" waltz into darkness
"
( whihc was allso the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film
,
" mississippi mermaid
"
)
, opens inaddition a turn
- ofthe
- the
- century prison
, as jolie ' s charater
, slated for a dawn execution
, tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny
. the freshman writing class tone is quickly estalbished when she sasy things like
,
" this is not a lvoe story
, it is a story baout love
.
" wary of local gold
- diggers
, cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas
( banderas
) makse arrangements to secure a mail order bride fomr amercia
, listing hismelf as a mere clerk tothe dissuade foreign gold
- diggers
. a practical man
, luis chooses a frumpy looking lady
, hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children
. imagin his surprise wehn his fianc
? e
, julia russell
( jolie
)
, turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman iin thte photo
. julia explains that she sent a different woman ' s image because she didn ' t want to be selected solely forthe her preety face
. luis
then confesses his deception
, leading julie to state
, with great significance
,
" we have something in common
, we are both not to trusted
.
" after their wedding
, luis
and julia retire forthe a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking
, with their bodies positioned tothe display her breasts
and his bottom as erotically as possible
. jolie
adn banderas are attractive people
and watching them naked is fun
,
although the filmmakers ' insistence on using one ofthe banderas ' legs tothe cover jolie ' s crotch makes it look like he ' s trying tothe climb her
. luis
, the stupidest man who ever lieved
, immediately instructs teh bank to make his personel
adn business accounts available to julia
, dispite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded
. his blissful ignornce continues as the warning signs mount up
. luis must force julia tothe write to her sister emily
, who is frantic over her lack ofthe communication
. shortly after julia complains baout the chirping of a pet bird
, it is found on thte floor of its cage with a broken neck
. fianlly
, when she cleans out his accounts
and disappears
, luis begins tothe suspect that something might be wrong
. incidentally
, if you ' re afraid i ' m giving too much awya
, rest assured that all of this happens inwhich the first 30 minutes of the movie
, leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists
, a great deal of operatic acting
and more footage ofthe her tits
and his ass
. along yhe way
, private detective walter downs
( played by thomas jane
, who wass terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie
" 61
*
"
) turns uv
, hired by the frumpy woman ' s sister tothe fidn out wqat happened to the real julia
. luis is also eeger for the detective to track down the con artist
, having decided that if he can ' t hvea her
, he iwll kill her
. oh
, the pathos of it all
. the cast appears to recogize the trashiness ofthe the story
, adjusting their performances accordingly
. banderas is suitably impassioned
, while jolie alternates between vamping
and pouting
(
adn with those lips
, she can really pout
)
. as for thomas jane
, he starts off acting suspicious
and cagey
,
thne accelerates tothe a snidely whiplash level of nastiness
. his most startling moent comes when
, to prove his power to humiliate
, he forces luis against a wall
, verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against thsoe of luis
and
then finishes establishing his dominance with a full
- onthe kiss
. if anyone ever questions the difference between sex
and rape
, sohw them this chilling scene
.
anbd if anyone ever questions the difference betweeen real drama
and a laughable potboiler
, show them
" original sin
