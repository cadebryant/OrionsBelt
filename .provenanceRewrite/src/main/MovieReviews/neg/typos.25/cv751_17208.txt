a few monthes befoer the release of star wars episode 1
, hte phantom menace
, 20th century fox decides to release another space film
, that is a complete rip off ofthe star wars
. what is the point of this
? i do nto know
,
bu i wish it hadn ' t beeen done
, concidering wing commander is definitely the year ' s worst film so far
. to attract people to this horrible movie
, they attached thte full trailer forthe the phantom menace
. wing commander wiull draw large crowds
, because this is the only film where you cant find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time
. hte trailer fo the phantom menace was certainly the best part ofthe the movie experience i hadnt tongiht
. many peopel do nto nkwo that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game
. i found tihs very interesting
, concidering this fact almost syas that wing commander is a star wars movie
. it is nowhere near the level of tghe star wars films
though
. freddie prinze jr
. stars in the film as christopher blair
. wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie
. this was definitely his worst performance to date
. after january ' s she ' s all that
, i actually saw a ogod actor in freddie
,
bu now all those visions have been crushed
.
( for now anyway
.
) christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stpo the kilrathi
, a gropu that is trying to destroy the earth
. blair ' s parents also fougth infront the space battles
,
and allso died there
. his parents were pilgrims
, so many people disrespect him becuase ofthe this
. blair isnt under tjhe command of
" angel
"
, played by saffron burrows
,
and he is firends with another pilot
, todd
" maniac marshall
"
, plyed by matthew lillard
. matthew lillard seems to play tjhe same role in every movei
,
and he does inspite this one too
. his carachter as stu iin 1996 ' s scream
( a
+
)
, was a great one
,
bu now
, it seems like that same role is being played agina
, only in a space movie
. the threee are just a small part of a larg group trying to stpo the kilrathi befor htey take over earth
. thsi plot isnt very flimsy
,
and doesn ' t give a whole lot tothe work with at all
. htis explains why wing commander drags on
, seeming like ther is no point to any of teh events that are going onthe
. thge acting is horrible iin wing commander
. many lines seem out of palce
,
anbd are completely meaningless
. the acting
and dialogue ws so terrable
, i even foudn myself laughing at it
. the other things which are vyer bad about wing commander are yhe speshal effects
and thte music
. the speical effects are very unrealistic
. when looking at two ships flying side by side
, it is simple to tell they are hanging
and a blue screen is behind them
. tjhe explosions look very unrealistic as well
. a ship will be blown up
,
but there iwll onyl be fire present four about one half of a second
. this is very unrealistic
. music preety much accompanies the film the entire time
. the music also felt like video gaem music
,
and it was very corny
and annoying sounding
. after we are given the plot
, the film repeats itself for another hour
, without any plot twists
, interesting scenes
, or anytying important to tghe film
. blair isnt forced tothe make jumps over other planets
,
and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircaft
. for the entire lenght ofthe tje movie
, it takes palce in space
. it isnt truly like you are in a video game
, becuase you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long
, extended period of time
. it ' s not much funn to watch at all
. if i wanted to watch peopel shoot at each other in ships
, i owudl go watch star wars at home
. at least star wars pays attension tothe people
, myth
, feelings
,
and has some real plot to it
. tghe bottom line
- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox
!
