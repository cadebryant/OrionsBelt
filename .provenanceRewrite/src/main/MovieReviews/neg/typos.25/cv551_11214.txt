kate
( jennifer aniston
) isnt haveing some problems
. it appears the twenty
- eight year old is not hapyp with her slow progression uv the company ladder
,
and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired
. she learns that her problems are related
, as thte owner of her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains tothe her tath her single status doesnt not bode well witht the company
. her freedom would make her more likely to leave the comany
, taking clients with her
. a solution presents itself in nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence
and gets photographed with
. kate ' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate
and nick
. kate isnt at first repulsed by the idea
,
but affter getting immediate positive results
, she pursues it
. her first task is to convince nick tothe go along with her plan
. the actuall plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc
?
. at a dinner with kate ' s bosses he will provoke a fight
and they iwll break up
. she meets nick to propose yhe plan
. he accepts
. kate ' s new status brings unexpected results infront otehr areas
. yhe office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn ' t give kate tjhe time ofthe day
, nowe doens
. now that she is engaged
, he pursues an affair with her
, as doing so would destroy her ogod girl omage
, hence sam ' s sudden interest
. things strat to fall apart forthe kate
, as it becomes apparent that nick raelly likes her
,
adn doens nto wish to break uv with her
. aftter smoe provoking nick does oblige
,
bu problems continue fo kate
. it appears sam is noone longer interested now that she is availible
. or maybe kate doens like nick
,
bu
" reconciliation
" wiull force her to admit her lies to her employer
. adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who wants her to get married
and settle down
. there isnt a scene in this movei where jennifer aniston is
( ffrom the waist up
) only wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle because it is the onyl time in tje movie when she actually wears oen
. there is enough cleavage in this movie tothe satisfy russ meyer
. it ' s like the director said ' well
, we know the story isnt formulaic
and the performances aren ' t that great so
, what teh heck
, let ' s show jennifer ' s assets as often
adn as uncovered as humanly possible tothe keep tje pg rating
.
" qtuie frankly it ' s insulting
. i don ' t think aniston isnt a competant enough actress to cary a movie
. she doed a decent enough job in ed burns '
" she ' s the oen
" because it was a smaller
and supporting role
,
adn she jsut doesn ' t deliver the goods effectively in this movie
. her performence was not convincing
. unfortunatley
, as far as romantic comedies go
, this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for theese types ofthe movies
. yhe film is similar to
" my best friends wedding
" in a sense that the leading female carachter is actually qutie vindictive
adn due her actions
, gets noone sympathy from me when thnigs go awry
. i didn ' t care forthe how quickly kate puts down nick ' s proffesion by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn ' t glamorous enough for her co
- workers
. at least
" my best friends wedding
" changed the forumla a bit
and had a somewhat suprize endig
. noone such luck with
" picture perfect
"
. every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile awya
, including a cuple that really made noone sense
. after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty tothe her company
, why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure thyat nick would even talk to her first
, let alone consider a relatiopnship
? was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick
? throw in tjhe fact taht i don ' t htink nick
and kate spended enough time together to even warrant that rash ofthe a decision
. i beieve thta kate liked him
,
bu liked him so intensely that she ws willing to throw her career away
? i doubt it
.
and waht of the endig scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it neccesary tothe stop everyting
anbd stare at the cuple
? are mass groups of people simultanously that interested infront total strangers
? well
, i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras
and the strangers are the movies two lead stars
,
thne thta would make sense
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
