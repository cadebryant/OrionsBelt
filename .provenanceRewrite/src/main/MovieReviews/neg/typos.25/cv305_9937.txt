walt disney studios may hve finally met its match whith the lush animation in twentieth centruy fox ' s anastasia
.
bu judging by the latest effords from the don bluth studios
, the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about
. disney ' s receet classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas
, the hunchback of notre dame
,
and to a lesser extent
, hercules
. withthe anastasia
, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window
. some may say
- so what
? it ' s just a kid ' s movie
. well
.
.
. if you have young kids
, beware
, as they may be noticeably frightened by tjhe visuals of a corpse
- rotting rasputin zombie
, whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way
. consider yourselves warned
. nethertheless
, the animation is quite stunning at times
. don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughtout
, occasionally rivalling photographic quality
.
and
yet in other scenes
, the hand
- drawn material seems of the saturday
- morning tv crowd
, which leads me tothe wonder
.
.
. ws this rushed to market tothe combat disney
? yhe plot
, as anyone who had read history befoer konws
, concerns tjhe attempt tothe return anastasia tothe her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow ofthe the romanovs in 1916
. not that anastasia is much concerned with whta relaly happened
. as for the plot
-
-
- go rent disney ' s candleshoe
. you ' ll see 60
% ofthe anastasia there
