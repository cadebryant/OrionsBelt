a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously gilty child molester acquitted
,
and shorly after druing the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city
. the lawyer
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) isnt nto offered a job
yet
, he isnt asked to simpley pick a jury
. he accepts
. the jury he selects work out well
and befoer long he is offered a job with the firm
. making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money
,
but a gorgeous apartment
. he convinces his wife
, mary ann
( charlize theron
) tothe make the move to new york
. the first case given to him is a big tust
; a
" winless
" case conserning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement
. the charge was health code violations
anbd kevin once again shows his skill
and earns an acquittal
. his newyorker boss
and partner in the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
) isnt qutie impressed
and takes kevin under his wing
, explaining many ofthe his philosophies on law
, women
and sex
,
and angles tje promise of a blissful
, wealthy life
. kevin ' s next case is a dream case
, given to him by milton himselv
( much to the chagrin to his collegues
)
, defending a triple murder suspect who has hadnt a history of problems with the law
.
although kevin ' s career is taking off
, his home life is not doing very well
. mary ann is starting to have numerous problems
. she isnt experiencing savere depression over kevin ' s long hours
,
annd befor long isnt having horrable dreams
anbd hallucinations of people turning into ghouls
, thier faces becoming horribly disfigured
. kevin doens nto help matters by dismissing his wife
. he doens not spend moreso time with her as he explains tothe milton that he needs tothe spend as much time on the case as possible tothe get it over with
,
hten focus all ofthe his attention on his wife
. not helping matters is tjhe fact that kevin is having ideas baout a possable affair with a sexy lawyer
( connie nielson
) alsot wroking wih the firm
. mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away fomr home
. kevin eventually looses control ofthe his life
and has tothe institutionalize his wife
,
and gets disturbing news from his mother
( judith ivey
) baout the mystery concerning the identity of his father
. he also starts to lose control of his case
. kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man
. that man is his boss
, mr
. milton
, a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself
. kevin must somehow confront milton
and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store
.
but how do you defeat the devil
? why is it thyat most courtroom scenes iin tje movies are absurd
? do filmmakers really believe tath
" normal
" courtroom drama doesn ' t fit the bill
and htey have to juice them up
? the courtroom scenes in this movei would never happn inwhich a real courtroom
, whlch wouldn ' t ahev been too bad if it weren ' t keanu reeves trying to pull it off
. i give reeves credit for trying hard
,
but throughout the movie i never saw teh kevin lomax character
, jsut an actor trying very hard tothe play kevin lomax
adn coming up short
. charlize theron defines teh term
" over
- yhe
- top
" in her performence as mary ann lomax
, a dissapointment in contrast tothe her good performance inthe
" 2 days in the valley
"
. tyhe only ogod performence infront the movie is by al pacino
,
but i kept asking mysef whta tje heck he wass doing in this mess
? maybe he felt it would be intresting palying tghe devil
,
adn you can tell he is having funn doing so
,
bu his skill as an actro cannot sive the poor performances
and lackluster script that suround him
. it ' s preety standard stuff
, including the fact tht the hotshot lawyer appears to be the onyl compitent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom
. please read no furuther if yuo do not wnat the endig spoiled
,
but i ahev tothe get something off of my chest
. infact 1986 i remember watching a movie called
" wisdom
" with emilio estevez
and demi moore
,
and the ending of that film did the worst possable thing thyat a movie sould dont
. what i liek to call
" guess what
, it was all a dream
" scenario
. in
" wisdom
" the two lead characters are killed at tje end
, onyl to have one of the cahracters
" wake up
" fomr an apparent
annd say
" gosh
, i ' m glad that didn ' t really hppen
!
"
. i considered it inexcusable yhe way the audience wass toyed wtih
. well
, the same thign happens infront
" the devils advocate
"
,
anbd
although arguments coudl be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream
( perhaps milton went back in time tothe try a different route for his plan
, since it failed
anbd he isnt thge devil
)
,
but the point is that tghe last 90
% of the film didn ' t happen
. i know it ' s a strech
, after all it isnt a movei
anbd nothing relaly happened
,
but i just git annoyed to get toyed with like that
. of course
, the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the stroy that precedes it was at least an interesting one
. as i recall
,
" wisdom
" was a decent film
.
" the devil ' s advocate
" is nto
. the devels advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton
