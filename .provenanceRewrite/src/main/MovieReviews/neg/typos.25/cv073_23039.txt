late in down to you
, the lead female character
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear is having an
" artifical conversation
" with her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. the irony of this statement wiull not be lost on audience munbers who have not
yot walked outloud
, fallen asleep
, or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy
. the film is a multi
- million dollar testament to everything artificial
. filled with characters
, motivation
, plot
and dialogue that ring fake
and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster
. prinze plays a college student intent onthe playing the field until he falls for stiles ' freshman co
- ed
. at frist tje movie seems tothe be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose ofthe out
- doing the previous infact how
" cute
" it cin be
. the happy couple
" psychoanalyze
" each other
; tehy pick out a song becuase
, as prinze ' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, every couple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest inaddition teh morning to let him know she wants to amke love
.
hten
, inwhich standard romantic comedy style
, things fall apart
. why
? well
, because they have tothe
. otherwise tjhe couple can ' t make up
anbd live
( presumably
) happily ever after
. down tothe you exists outside the realm of normal logic
. scenes do not connect to eahc other
and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism
,
bu tihs is handeled so poorly that everything comes off random
anbd stupid instead
. a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bazare
, not only for yhe stretched logic of these people hanging out toghether
, or even knowing each otehr
,
but mostly because an unusual ammount ofthe screen tyme is dedicated to a goat
. the supporting characters are remarkably flat
,
and insultingly ridiculous as well
. stiles ' best friend
( rosario dawson
) is a pot head
, prinze ' s roomate
( shawn hatosy
) is a girl crazy fool who can ' t meet womens
,
and
then there are yhe porn stars
( zak orth
and selma blair
)
. he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television
, does tje coleeg lecture circut
,
and stars in high budget costume epic porns thgat are shooted onthe film
. yuo know
, the average porn star
. thte costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he ' s on screen
, the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes
. she is a porn star mostly so we know she ' s slutty
, so her very existence wiull make stiles jelous
and prinze tempted
. attempts at drama
( which means julia is goign to cry
) inlcude a pregnancy scare
and the big break uv
. these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer woudl be manipulated by theese weak scenes
. what happened here
? the cast is full of likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles especially seems tothe be gogin places
)
. writer
/ director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros coudl pul it off
. in fact the whole film fiels like a reworking ofthe last year ' s extremly unpleasant the stor of us
, for teen audiences
. the direction is film
- school
- grad obvious
. it ' s stylish in a hugely self cnoscious way which throws in split screen
, a pointless parody of
" cops
,
" characters walking into tghe flashbacks ofthe other charactors
,
and a hilariously cheesy airporta meeting betweeen prinze
and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion hwile the couple moves inspite extreme slow motion
. plus
, the whole story is told flashback style
, narrated by prinze
and stiles directly addressing hte camera
. this is the second film in a row
( following wing commander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. which should ahev premiered onthe the aisles of the local blockbuster
bu wass likely saved fomr that fate due to the fluke success of she ' s all that
. if he doesn ' t start makeing better choices fast his future films won ' t be so lucky
.
