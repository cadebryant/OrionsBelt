. as voiced by sean connery
,
" draco
" is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well
- deserving of his 23 minutes ofthe screen time
. he walks
, talks
, flies
, fries
,
and even fakes his own death
, all with teh help of 96 computer
- aided animators
. too bad taht ilm
( indutrial light

. a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be
. he ' s a near
- total loss as he growls glumly thru his role ofthe a disillusioned knight
. david thewlis ' evil king has a high hiss factor
( hf
)
,
though he ' s more of a mumbling oddity tahn anything esle
. oh
,
and ther ' s some redhead iin a ' 90 ' s wig
, who runs around eather screaming or scowling
, depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman infact peril or tjhe put upon peasant
. the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk iwth literary ambitions
, julie christie
(
!
) as the good queen mother
, a band of mercenaries that appear dressed fo ye olde heavy
- metal concert
,
and
, believe or it not
, the speaking spirit of king arthur
. bring out your dead
! unfortunatley
, when we add it all toghether
( draco
+ fringe bits
- quaid
- thewlis
)
, the sum total amounts to zero
. dragonheart isnt
, well
, too much of too little
. director rob cohen
( dragon
: tje bruce lee story
) has made a big
, expensive movie that
, while ambitiously plotted
, is both murky
annd predictable
.
and overscored
.
anbd self
- important
.
and the list goes onthe
.
( i must ask
: did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that
* every
* character be stabbed
, lanced
, or sliced at least once
? keep that man awya from the knife drawer
!
) the last five minutes ofthe this movie are the worst
, with some silly celestial nonsense tyhat owudl be laughed out of any planetarium light show
, much less a summer movie
