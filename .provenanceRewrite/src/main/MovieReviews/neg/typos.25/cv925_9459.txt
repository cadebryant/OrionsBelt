everybody in htis film ' s thinking of alicia
. noone
, this is not a documentary on thsoe ofthe us after we first saw the
" cryin '
" video
. this is one ofthe those erotic thrillers
,
but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed
. firt off
, there ' s zero sex
, allmost no nudity
,
and it ' s nto as well
- plotted as oney of those tweed ficks
. well
, anyway
. the
" plot
.
" alicia plays
, well
, the babysitter
, who is taking care of smoe kids one night while tjhe parents
( j
. t
. walsh
and lee garlington
) go outloud to a party
. the film
, trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers
, shows every characters ' thoughts
, exept alicia ' s
. the hting is alicia ' s inthe most ofthe them in most cases
,
anbd the thoughts aren ' t too kosher
. firt off
, there ' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gave one of the all
- timne lousy performances in
" mallrats
,
"
and is only a notch better here
)
, who ' s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully
, played by nicky katt from
" suburbia
"
( who shows he ' s got that quiet creepiness down pat once agina
)
. they decide they want to crash her babysitting job
, looking for the typical babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine liek that
. the film intercuts beetwen the subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky
annd jeremy
, the party
)
anbd eahc characters ' thoughts
. we get to see jeremy
and nicky ' s dreams of doing a littel threeway with alicia
, j
. t
. thinking of comming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub
( she has it all covered up
, tje littel tease
)
,
and
, worst of all
, lee garlington dreaming of tath hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them infact bed together
. yea
. i so wnated to see george
and lee garlington inthe bed
,
though i guess i ' m used to george after seeing her
and mary tyler moore fooling around in
" flirting wih diaster
.
" the ending is soem kind of big tragedy thing
,
but come on
. like we care about any of the characters
. the only interesting oen is alicia
, mainly because she ' s alicia
,
and we mostly see her in tyhe fantasies
. so i guess she ' s some kind of mystery or something
.
but she is never explored further
. so
, basically
, htis film is just a series ofthe mastabatory images
, sometimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once again
, sadly
)
, somtimes featuring a scantily
- claded george segal
( once agian
, sadly
)
. i watched htis on one ofthe those free previews ofthe showtime or cinemax one night
,
adn let me tell you
, it is the only way tothe watch this film
. i mean
, there ' s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night
: tehy ' re jsut as ogod as sleeping pills
.
and this one is one big fat waste of time
, even fo an alicia film
.
