it ' s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james '
( jennifer love hewitt
) best firends
. still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man resposible fo it all
, she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown
. she cant ' t concentrate on her schoolwork
, can ' t get a good night ' s sleep
,
anbd isnt even frightened by the shadows
and tyhe blinking strobe ights at a local dance club
. everywhere she looks
, she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand
. in the first movie
,
` i know waht you did last summer '
, julie
and threee of her firends accidentally kill a man
, runnung him down while driving down a dark mountain higway
. to cover their misdeed
, they dump the body into the ocean
.
however
, he never quite died
and returned to hunt down julie
and her friends
. julie
and one other
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, survived only to make htis dismal sequal
. needing some desparate rest
and relaxation
, she is elated to learn that her college roommate
, karla
( brandy
)
, hasnt won a trip for four tothe a secluded tropical island
. accompanying these twpo girls are karla ' s overbearing boyfriend
, tyrell
( mehki phifer
)
and a potential beau for julie
.
but was this contest too good to be true
? the resort is filled iwth a skeleton staff that seemed liek love boat rejects
. meanwhile
, tghe hotel isnt practically deserted as teh storm season is baout to begin
. this presumeably creates a venue where htey wiull be secluded
and will have noone possable means off the island
. eventally
, they will be hunted down during pwoer outages
and chased around during intense lightnnig storms
. as you might have guessed
, somewhere iin the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that isnt wearing a rubber slicker
and wielding a hook
. julie tries tothe convince her friends that the killer is onthe the island
( an eerie touch is wehn she is singing
" i will survive
" at the karaoke bar
and the words scroll
" i still know
.
.
.
"
)
,
but her firends chalk it uv tothe paranoya
.
but teh body count soon starts to rise
,
and for julie
, it ' s going tothe be the worst vacation ofthe her life
. the funny
( yes
, i used the owrd ' funny '
) hting baout this movie is that i herad more chortling
and giggling
( maybe it was my giggling
) than i herad screaming
. this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest tath never conjures up any ammount ofthe wry wit or even a quirky campiness
. there isn ' t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths
. here ' s an appropiate example
. knock
- knock
.
" housekeeping
"
, says the diminuitive cleaning lady
. tje door suddenly opens up
. slash
. next victim
! is htere any reason to go
and see thsi movie
? not unless you want tothe see four uninteresting college kids run around infact circles fo about 90 minutes
.
but i do want tothe say one hting about this movie that satisfied me
. i ws thoroughly irritated wtih tyrell
, who incessantly ranted
and raved about his sexual libido
. i secretly wished for him tothe get filleted
. did he get ' hooked '
? well
, let ' s just say that if he didn ' t
, i would give this film a grade of
" d
"
