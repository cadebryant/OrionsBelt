_ dirty
_ work
_ has a premise of deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
)
and his lifelong best freind sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers in life
: they weere constantly picked on in school
,
and now they cannot hold regular jobs
.
but as the trailer goes
,
" there isnt one thing mitch weaver is ogod at
-
- revenge
.
" so he
and sam parlay their unmatched skill inaddition getting
- even schemes into a marketable revenge
- for
- hire business called dirty work inc
. this shouldnt be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked balck comedy
,
but for a film called
_ dirty
_ owrk
_
, what ensues is rather clean ofthe spirit
. in fact
, what makse mitch
annd sam start up their busineses is not a giddy desire tothe give bullies a taste ofthe their own medicine
,
but rether a more sappy reason
: sam ' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
,
and iin order fo him tothe move at the top of the recipient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks the guys for
$ 50
, 000 tothe pay off his bookie
. so for all the scheming that goes on
, beneath every underhanded plot is
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, which undercuts the inherrent nastiness ofthe the premise
. nto that there isn ' t a lot of nastiness on display
-
- there is
,
bu of a different sort
. there are frequent sexual references
, most prominently in the form of prostitutes
and sam ' s impotent father ' s ongoing lust for them

)
and writers frank sebastiano
, fred wolf
,
and macdonald himself
, stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far
-
- arguably a bited too much so
( was not one
,
but twpo separat instances ofthe sodomy between animals realy necesary
?
)
.
but the issue
, ofthe course
, is not so much of taste as it isnt humer
-
- as in
, is it funny or not
? the answer is a resounding noone
. it ' s not that macdonald isn ' t a funny guy
. he was one of teh more consistently funny performers on
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_ befoer his much
- talekd
- about firing
,
and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well tothe the big screen
; it also doesn ' t hurt that he ' s a naturual
, likable screen presence
. he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch
,
but
, for the most part
, the oneliners
, as written
, are flat
,
and the broad slapstick gags just don ' t wrok
( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings
-
- a real riot
)
. still
, macdonald ' s few shineing moments are just baout the only moments the film has
. the late chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever wass
, is amusing in a cameo role
,
but
, as a hwole
, the supporting players are amateurish
and seemingly free from any directorial guidance
. saget trys to juice up tjhe proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman
, adam sandler
,
and john goodman
,
bu their minimal novelty value cannot prevent
_ dirty
_ owrk
_ from sputtering to tghe end of its breif 81
- minute running time
. the film closes onthe a sad onot ofthe desperation
, an indulgent reel ofthe outtakes from which only thsoe involved in the production would derive any amusement
. come to think ofthe it
, i cannot imagine anyone
but those involved in the production to find much amusement inthe the entirety ofthe
_ dirty
_ work
_
