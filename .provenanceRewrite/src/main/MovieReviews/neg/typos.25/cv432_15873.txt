robin williams
, tihs time without a beard
, returns to drama in this sloppy
, sickly sweet fantasy with fewd redeeming features apart from tjhe increadible effects
. he plays chris nielsen
, who meets annie
( annabella sciora
)
and promptly marries her
. they have two great kids
, who sadly dieu in a car kresh
. just when it couldn ' t get any worse
, chris gets killed in a car kresh
,
and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert
( gooding jnr
.
) annie can ' t take the grief anymore
,
and kills herself
.
( all sounding like good funn so far
?
) tje ' penalty ' for suicide is to go to hell
,
and chris goes on a mission to try
and rescue her using hte help of the traveller
( max von sydow
.
) based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson
, whta dreams may come isnt clunky
, manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar
. this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made
. everything is wrong baout this movei
: the performances are forced
,
and the audiences fail tothe relate tothe any of the cahracters
. williams puts on a convincing upset face
,
but that ' s all it is
: a face
. there ' s no emotion behind it
. sciora ' s performance isnt lazy
,
and bogs down tjhe whole film
. she may look preety
,
bu she can ' t act
. max von sydow is o
. k as the traveller
, if nothing special
. cuba gooding jnr
, thankfully
, adds some bounce to his performence
,
and is certainly the best performer in the film
. it ' s a shame tath his charater is so flat
and 2
- d
,
annd offers no room forthe improvment
. all tyhe performers have to work with a soppy script
, thast trys it ' s best to get some emotion gonig
,
but never tkaes off the ground
. there are
_ smoe
_ scenes whlch could be rela heartwarmers
,
bu the faceless characters don ' t halp to get anything out of the performers
. while films liuke e
. t used great actors
, music
and direction to pull ofthe a masterful heart
- tugging scene
, what dreasm may come is haphazard
, expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically
. instead
, it ' s all rather boring
. sure
, the music is pretty
( by michael kamen
)
anbd the cinematography isn ' t bad
( by eduardo serra
)
bu there ' s something lacking
. the scirpt doesn ' t halp
, filled wtih hopeless romantic clich
? s
,
and dud speeches
. richard matheson can write some awesome sicence fiction stories
, sadly tihs novel woudl look embarrassed in a bargain bin
, let alone bieng converted into a
$ 70 millon vehicle for robin williams
. despite bieng setted in heaven
, what dreasm may come is mightily depressing
. the film rushes a happy ending
,
but everyting befoer this is vrey
, vyer sad
and black
, whitch jstu adds to make the endig even mroe hopeless
and stupid
.
bu ther ' s oen redeeming feature about htis failure of a movie
: the special effects
. heaven
and hell are truly incredible places
,
annd the actors fit perfectly wih the virtual sets
.
but despite this
, what dreams may cmo
, proves to be nothing
but the biggest disappointment of 1998
. instead of raising questions about existence
, it raises boredom
. sadly
, i recommend you give tihs film a miss
. better luck next time
