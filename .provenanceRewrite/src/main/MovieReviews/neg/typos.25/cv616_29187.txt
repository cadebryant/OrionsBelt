susan granger ' s review ofthe
" session 9
"
( usa films
) sometimes you jsut get more tahn your bargained fo
.
.
. like when boston
- based hazmat elimination
, run by scottish actor peter mullan
and his trusty assistant
, david caruso
, assures a town engineer
( paul guilifoyle
) thast they cxan remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility inthe a week
. erected in 1871
, deserted
and decomposing since 1985
, yhe danvers mental hospital
, isnt one of the most malevolent
" locations
" ever chosen forthe a film
. the structure is so massive
- with its labyrinth of rubble
- strewn corridoors
, collapsing floors
, stagnant pools ofthe water
, isolation cells
,
and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre
- frontal lobotomies were performed
- that theri task seems impossible within that time frame
.
and each member of their inexperienced crew
( stephan gevedon
, brandon sexton iii
,
and josh lucas
) isnt coping whith his own peronal demons as
, one by one
, their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in whitch they ' re working
. the film ' s title is derived from salvaged reel
- to
- reel audio
- recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities
. by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters
. filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw
- masicer
- tipe ghost stoyr
but the scirpt lacks structure
and isn ' t prticularly scary
. the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" session 9
" is a dark
, gloomy 4
. silly me
.
.
. at first
, i thought that the original nmae ofthe the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference tothe mrs
. danvers
, the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock ' s truely terrifying
" rebecca
" that allso involved a cavernous mension called manderley
