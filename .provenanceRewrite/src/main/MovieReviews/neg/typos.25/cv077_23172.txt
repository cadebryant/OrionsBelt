` down tothe you ' doesn ' t have yhe
? unlikely scenario ' mentioned above
. it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance

- back story
. the plot is conveniently assembled tothe suit yhe requirements ofthe tghe main characters
, who are frequently taking part inthe activities taht
.
.
.
. well
, onyl happen in tghe movies
. fortunately
, the cast of
` down to you ' has a certian appeal
. freddie prinze jr
.
and julia stiles are an adorable couple
,
and when on screen together
, they radiate the sort ofthe warmth
and charisma that the movei should haev centered around
. zak orth
, as the newly realized porn star monk
, shows an unmistakable flair wih handling all ofthe the film ' s intelligent dialogue
. rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy
(
` the faculty '
)
, selma blair
(
` cruel intentions '
)

. maybe the consept of
` down to you ' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd
. as a feature film
,
however
, the finished product is bland
annd tasteless fluff whith onyl an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely
. perheaps worst ofthe all
,
` down to yuo ' is not funny
. the jokes are drawn fomr obvious sources
and the resulting humor is banal
anbd uninspired
. the characters on screen
, often laughing at eahc other ' s goofy
/ embarassing antics
, seemed far omre amused thna tjhe audiance
. even tje giggly 12
- year old girls had grown restless toward the end as tehy waited impatiently for the formula to run it ' s course
. the one mildly clever segment featured winkler
anbd prinze jr
. in a fantasy sequence called
` cooks '
, a
` cops ' take
- off in which the father
anbd son would storm houses
and cook a decent meel for

. in order to mkea a teen comedy work
, you ' ve got to have charachters thyat show something by way of depth
annd identity
.
` 10 things i hate baout yuo ' acutally featured characters who were more tahn walking flashcards

. it ' s just a textbook romance where
, dispite absurd circumstances
, everything is binded to work outloud in tje end
.
and at the end of the whole clich
