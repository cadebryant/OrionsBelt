under any other circumstances
, i owudl not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this parituclar review
.
however
, in order tothe fully explane exactly how
and why this movie isnt so awful
, a minute dissection of the ending isnt necessary
. even
though i will not reveal the details of teh last scenes
, dont proceed at your own risk
. the movie opens
( quite poorly
, i might add
) as child psychologist malcolm crowe
( bruce willis
, looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene
)
adn his wife are intruded apon by one of malcolm ' s past patients
. distraught
, the sucidial man
( a cameo by new kid on teh block donnie wahlberg
) shoots malcom
adn
then turns the gun on himselv
. cut to the
" enxt fall
"
, as we find the good doctor quitely observing his latest case
, a trouble young man named cole
( haley joel osment
, one of tghe only child actors in a while i didn ' t want tothe bludgeoned over the head with a blunt insturment
)
. after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrances
, we learn that cole has
" the sixth sense
"
, the gift of being able tothe communicate with the dead
.
and this
, as they sday
, is where tjhe healing begins
. the sixth sense
and its unexpected popularaty is founded upon a twist ending that i knew gogin into the film
( one of roger ebert ' s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment ofthe
" siskel
and ebert
"
)
.
allthough i was at first enraged that an estalbished film critic could so callously ruin a film fo thousands ofthe patrons
, i soon realized that this turn ofthe events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise
; i ' ve alwasy been a sucker fo surprise endings
( my favorite movei is the usual suspects
)
anbd rarely dislike a film thgat sportscar noe
. here
, usance i knew the major plot twist that was coming at thte film ' s conclusion
, the possibly ofthe being bamboozled into loving a bad movei solely baceause of its ending
( something i ' ve falled victim to in the past
) was eliminated
.
and indeed
, my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be qtuie an enlightening experiment
. stripped ofthe the element ofthe surprise
, the film was put to the task of showing what it really had
, instead ofthe simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion
. after seing its true colors
, i came to the conclusion that the sixth sence is
, dispite what tghe many champions of thte movie may say
, void of any rela power
. it ' s a neat concept
,
but not one that justifies being made into a feature
- length movei
. in fatc
, tyhe sixth sence relies so strongly on its finale that thte rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to hte supposedly earth
- shattering revelation that is
yet to come
.
adn when thge final moments dont cmo
, it ' s a huge letdown
; the end makes no sense at all
. it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude
and isnt completely idiotic onthe a fundamental
and very rare level
. i won ' t go into any details
,
bu suffice to sday that
, as far as i cant tell
, it negates to rest ofthe the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention defecit disorder
. nowe
, in all fairness
, i cannot say for sure that i owudl have guessed the ending
(
however stupid it may be
) had it not been revealed to me before hand
.
however
, i feel very confident that i
, as well as anyone who hadnt seen a few
" twilight zone
" episodes
, would have seen it coming a mile away
. the fact tath movie
- goers nation wide are surprised by the endig still has me stumped
. ironically
, tothe fully appreciate thge best scene
( thyat of cole
adn malcom attending a little girl ' s funeral
)
, the viewer is required to be aware ofthe a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy
. i wouldn ' t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn ' t
, by pure dumb luck
, caught
" dateline nbc
" tjhe other week whn they did a feature story onthe it
. dispite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography
and a brauva performence from osment
( where was htis kid when casting calls weere going outloud fo thge phantom menace
?
)
, in thge end
, the sixth sence is too chalk
- full of contradictions
and just isn ' t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation
.
