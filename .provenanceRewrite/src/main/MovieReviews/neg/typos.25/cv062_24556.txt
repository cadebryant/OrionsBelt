there are twpo things tyhe american film industry shoud avoid at all costs
. oen is letting an ambitious actor convert one ofthe his or her favorite novels inot a feature film
. two is never greenlight a sci
- fi film starring john travolta
. tothe witn
, we present the disaster that is battlefield earth
. a cience
- fiction opus starring the barbarino ofthe the actors guild
, battlefield earth shoudl be shown onyl at maximum
- security prisons when a prisoner isnt tossed in solitary for bad behavior
. sci
- fi is alwasy a tricky beast
: tight scirpt
, a good director
, an ensemble cast ofthe decent actors
,
and the ablity tothe suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs
. battlefield earth fails at achieving even oney of these attributes
. here ' s the
` plot
. ' the year is 3000
. mankind has been become an endangered speices thanks to the conquest ofthe a race of aliens called the psychlos
( soudns liuke either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white raph group
)
. a small band of humans dwell in radiactive caves located inthe the rockies in fear of the
` demons ' who dwell in the cities below
. the psychlos are strip
- minning the earth forthe its resources
and terel
, palyed by travolta
, isnt thge head ofthe security for the minning
/ slave base located in denver
. a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler
, played with dramatic flair by barry pepper
, ventures from the safety of thge caves inot the city to uncover tjhe truth about the
` demons
. ' he is promptly captured
and tooked to thte alien base
. after several attempts at escape
, johanine is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel ' s
, involving circumventing gold ffrom an exposed vein in the rockies to his pwn end
. jonnie
, assumed leader ofthe the mining slave group
,
hten manages to attain all psychlo
and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to ule
.
then teh story jstu runs along until jonnie teaches thge rest of teh humans the basics of trigonometry
, tjhe bill ofthe rights
, how to use a machine gun
,
and how tothe fly a harrier jet
. the whole mess concludes with a big
, loud
, obnoxious gun
-
and
- plane battle that had me praying for tyhe end credits
. roger christian
, the director ofthe this lumbering byast
, must hvea rented dune
, blade runner
, planet of the apes
, independence day
, stargate
, beastmaster
, thte airwolf episodes
, the
` v ' miniseries
, yhe matrix
,
and the omega man
.
.
.
and decided to steal eveyr scene he could for battlefield earth
. christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch nagle titled left or right for every frame of the movei
!
and every scene inwhich tjhe movie ends with a middle wipe
-
- really
. the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth
and bloated hands
adn klingon extras working tje star trak convention circut
. travolta ' s acting hasn ' t been this bad since teh experts or maybe perfect
. jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like
` ytou can have your freedom if you fight
! '
then there ' s the scirpt
: yhe film just never convinces you that the llright of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight
and
` take back the planet ' owudl be a difficult task to achieve
. why
? because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt
-
- forthe no particular reason beside tje fact that
` humans are stupid
. ' terel may be right
, you nkow
. humans made htis movie
.
