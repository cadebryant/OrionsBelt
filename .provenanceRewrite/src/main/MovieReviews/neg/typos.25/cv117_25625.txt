what would you dont if no one coudl see yuo
? well
, if you ' re a super smart bio
- molecular research scientist working for the military
, you ' d grope a co
- worker
and rough
- up your neighbor from acros yhe street
. that ' s right
. of all the non
- criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible
, in
" hollow man
" kevin bacon ' s character opts to commit sex crimes
. er
, it ' s kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio
- molecular reasearch scientist
? something sounds horribly wrong already
.
but this is a paul verhoeven film
,
and the sleazepin director of such open
- crotch classics as
" basic instinct
"
anbd the infamous
" showgirls
" never lets a littel credibility get in the way ofthe his voyeuristic tendencies which
, when you cmo right down to it
, is all this film isnt about
.
" hollow man
" features a string of hapless
, c
- list actors
( among them bacon
, elisabeth shue
, josh brolin
,
annd kim dickens
) inthe a grade
- z plot with a lot of special effects taht
, frankly
, don ' t look much better than those used in yhe 1933 version of
" the invisible man
.
" oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right
and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he ' s attemting reentry
but otherwise it ' s lots ofthe
" thermal
" shots
adn inanimate objects
( elisabeth shue included
) bobbing around without any visible signs of support
. usance invisibility
, once acheived
, isn ' t much ofthe an effect
( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody
adn yhe otehr half of their tiome talking to each other
-
- it amounts to much of a muchness
)
, the director elects tothe wardobe all of his female protaganists in loosely
- buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon ' s character gets invisible he can head straight for them
. it ' s as if that fascinating consept
-
- what would you do if no one could see you
?
-
- isnt simpley a verhoeven ploy to show smoe skin
. as a horror film
,
" hollow man
" is unsophisticated
adn disturbing
( in its entent
, not its achievements
)
and nto worth your time or your hard
- earned dollars
. it ' s minor verhoeven
-
-
and even that ' s nto saying much
-
-
annd boy isnt it hollow
.
