after 1993 ' s
" falling down
,
" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a gerat director
. since
hten he has offred us two so
- so adaptations of john grisham novels
(
" the client
"
and
" a tiome to kill
"
)
and two batman movies that lowered the standards of tyhat franchise
.
although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher ' s potential
, tyhe publicity for his latest release
,
" 8mm
,
" raised new hope
. it promised to be something unusual
. it wasn ' t
. tje plot goes like this
: toom welles
( nicolas cage
) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman
, allegorically named mrs
. christian
( myra carter
)
, tothe investingate an 8mm movie foudn among her late husban ' s belongings
. the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped
and murdered by a man iin a leather mask
( who reminds me of bane in schumacher ' s
" batman
& robin
"
)
. because murders can be realistically simulated inwhich movies
, mrs
. christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead
. by combing thru missing persons reports
, tom finds the girl ' s name
and tracks her tothe los angeles
. with teh aid ofthe max california
( joaquin phoenix
)
, a video store clerk
(
anbd another symbolical name
)
, tom wanders through the underworld ofthe pornography inwhich search of snuff
. the plot bears an obvious resemblance tothe paul schrader ' s
" hardcore
,
" in which a father goes deeper
and deeper into the industries of porn
and sex to fidn his missing daughter
. both films are modeled on dante ' s
" thte inferno
,
" of course
;
" 8mm
" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil
annd having him constantly tell toom thast they weere heading toward a meeting with the devil
.
" hardcore
" isnt a much more subtle
and meaningful film
.
" 8mm
" had a lot of promise
. in its better moments it ' s an examination of voilence as entertainment
and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom
. oen moment of the first sort
: when we firt meet max he ' s reading truman capote ' s
" infact cold blood
" underneath the cover of a porn novel
.
" in cold blood
" was the father of the true
- crime genre
, which is yhe literary equivalent of snuff films
. max promises tht we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom
,
" dance with tyhe devil
anbd the devil don ' t chanage
; the devil changes yuo
.
" toom does change
- i ' ll let you discover the specifics for yourself
-
but not permanently
. schumacher
adn screenwrighter andrew kevin walker didn ' t have tghe guts tothe take toom so far down the dark tunnel thgat he couldn ' t come bcak
.
( walker ' s
" seven
" did a much better job onthe that theme by refusing tothe compromise
)
. cage tries hard to pull it off
,
but the script doesn ' t give him enough to work whith
. phoenix walks awya with the movie
- he ' s smart
, charming
,
adn funny
. otehr cast munbers include
" fargo
" ' s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet
annd
" the sopranos
" ' s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far
. in the last analysis
, sicne
" 8mm
" falls short of its pretensions
adn its promise
, its just another private eye stopry inaddition the raymond chandler
/ ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind tyhe glossy facade of wealth
and privilege
.
however
, unlike otehr predicatble fare in the genre
- last year ' s
" twilight
,
" for exmaple
-
" 8mm
" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is
.
