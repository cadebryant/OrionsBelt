be warned
.
. brit lveo story in the offing
. effeminate
, mild
- mannered karl isnt about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower
, his genitals tucked beween his legs in tghe manner of a posing transvestite
. he isnt onyl just saved by prentice
, who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street
- wise punk
- in
- the
- makeing
. tje ensuing scene ends up withthe both boys bieng ridiculed
and
then unfairly expelled from the school
. they dont not see each other for another eighteen yeas
. in that tiome
, prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable
, if brash
and bull
- heaed goon who screws uv his jobs
and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets
, motorcycles
and punk rock music
. karl
, on the otehr hand
, has grown up to become kim
, a drabby
, insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company
. chance brings the twpo together
,
and love
, such as will inevitably blossem in your quirky british rumatic comedy
, is what this skewed little story is largly about
. if at this point ytou think yuo ' re going to get any cheap laughs with that gender
- bending theme
( see thte birdcage
, tothe wong foo
.
.
.
, priscilla queen ofthe tyhe desert
)
, you can just go hmeo
and brood onthe your own maladjusted sexuality you low
- life deadbeat
. kim is a post
- operative transsexual
, thank you very much
.
.
. a new
- born woman for all purposes
, with confusions
and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy
. personaly
, give me those cheap laughs any day
. i ' d rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft
- hearted transsexual love story
. different for girls comes up with a promising enough propostion
,
but does nothing that surpasses the mearly workmanlike with it
. by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim
and prentice ' s relation
- ship
, or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them
( prentice for example
, doesn ' t seem to give hiself all taht much grief when he becomes attracted tothe kim despite being a fight
- picking
, beer
- drinking
, macho kind of guy
,
and kim
, for all her insecurities
and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film
)
,
and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love stroy
, the film manages to lobotomise itself
. lightweight comedy as it ' s doomed tothe be
, it could ' ve still haev hacked it wtih the requisitive endearing couple
.
but this doesn ' t eather
, sicne even mrs doubtfire isnt sexier than steven mackintosh ' s kim foyle
,
and as eather sex
, he ' s just plainly a simpering wanker nobody shoud like
. prentice does
though
,
and that ' s never explained
.
but
then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice
, the guy who never grew up
(
anbd if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal ofthe a rabid fan at a buzzcocks ' concert
, he shoud win thyat too
) thyat i guess ther ' s no reason tothe explain why he ' s so screwed uv
. if oddly enough you grow tothe like thsi show
, ytou ' ll be wanting your happy endig
,
annd the film won ' t fail you there either
. snide underling at kim ' s office gets her come
- uppance
. misogynistic police officer who beats uv prentice gets his come
- uppance
. the couple prevail against a disagreeable society
and come together inthe kim ' s appartment
. kim ' s sister
and her impotent sarge
- type husband kiss
adn make uv after a tiff
( tv movie sub
- plot with incidental juxtaposition
)
.
and best ofthe all
, kim sheds her insecurities
and learns how to ride hte motorcycle
anbd wear leathers
, making prentice ride pilion
. awwww
. terrific closure
. happy ending
.
but jstu what is it thast ' s differnt for girls anyway
? if ytou figure that oney outloud
, let me know
. tghe flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait fo the tv2 brodcast

* a little creaky

but still better than staying at home wih gotcha
