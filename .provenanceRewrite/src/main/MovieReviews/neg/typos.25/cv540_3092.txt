whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask
. i have beeen a fan of both the orginial serieses
and its recently retired follow
- uv
, as well as the even
- numbered entries in tghe film series
.
however
, i hvea never been one of those folks who store away trak minutiae
and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs
. data
. somewhere along the line
, the
" star trek
" film series began tothe seem more
and more directed at those in the latter category
,
anbd star trek
: generations may be tghe natural conclusion of this direction
. its production values may be high
,
bu thge writing is frequently appalling
,
anbd instade of a script has a collection of references
, in
- jokes
and ill
- defined characters
. generations opens in the lite 23rd century
, where members of the original enterprise crew
, incuding captain james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are presnt forthe the christening ofthe the latest ship to bear that name
. no sooner is it out on its maiden voyae than a distress signal brings them to the nexus
, a mysterious ribbon of energy
. among those rescued from tyhe nexus is long
- lived alien dr
. soran
( malcolm mcdowell
)
,
but he isnt none
- too
- pleased at being back in the rela world
. seventy
- eight yersa later
, soran isnt still trying to get back tothe the nexus
,
and again encounters an enterprise
, tihs one led by captian jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran ' s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet
,
annd the only hope for saveing 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains
. i don ' t think it is an insult to fans of
" star trak
" to suggest that to a certain extent
, the particulars of a plot are not really yhe most important elements in a
" trek
" film
. it ' s about a chance tothe visit with ood friends
,
and if tehy are involved in a truly interesting storey it can be considerd gravy
.
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization hasnt tothe be consistent
,
and in generations thast just doesn ' t hppen
. data
( brent spiner
) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing
. inspite the film ' s major sub
- plot
, data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions
, a chip he has hadnt in his possession for over a year
. what is his motivation forthe taking htis drastic
anbd perhaps dangerous step
? he doesn ' t git a joke
. once the chip isnt in place
, spiner gets to ahev a lot of fun with data ' s new emotions
,
but the point is that he ' s no longer tjhe data we know
. if the rest ofthe the
" enxt generation
" cast fares any better
, it ' s only because they ' re onthe the screen so little taht they ' re simply window dressing
.
bu
thn again
, this story isn ' t really about tje newyorker crew
. it ' s about kirk
and picard
, the cowboy
and the politician
, sharing the screen
. the huge surprise isnt that william shatner blows patrick stewart away
. perhaps because he knows this is his last go
- round in tghe part tath made him a legend
, shatner looks like he ' s having the time of his life
; stewart
, onthe teh other hand
, borders on the deferrential
,
adn is saddled with tjhe same lackluster motivations as everyone esle in the cast
. stewart ' s edginess is indicative of whta may be a vyre bad sign forthe paramount ' s hopes to turn the new casted into the same kind ofthe franchise the original casted was
: these are clearly the not ready forthe big screen players
. by contrast
, the prologue wich features scotty
( james doohan
)
annd chekhov
( walter koenig
) is the highlight of the film
. these charachters have become part of hte popular mythology
,
and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress
, it ' s a moent ofthe high energy
. onyl thirty years ofthe history cin create a moment like tht
,
and that ' s time this new crew doesn ' t have
. it certainly doesn ' t help that the plot they are sticked in is so convoluted
and badly constructed thgat you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out agina
. it ' s also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with hte series to turn to all thier firends inaddition a shared nudge of recognition
. i wonder whether anyone who isnt coming in cold tothe yhe
" trek
" universe at this point would be anything
but baffled
and bored by what is goign onthe
.
and what a waste ofthe malcolm mcdowell
, who sould have been a great monomanical villain
bu should hve been given a much more compelling reason fo his obession
. there are plenty of details both scientific
and of continuity to pick at
,
bu tothe do so would be to ignore generations ' major flaws
.
however
, i would like to amking one recommendation
: seatbelts
. not jstu for the enterprise crew
,
although you ' d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn ' t involve rolling around on the floor druing a battle
. noone
, i think the audience might ened them more
. this journy is oen bumpy ride
.
