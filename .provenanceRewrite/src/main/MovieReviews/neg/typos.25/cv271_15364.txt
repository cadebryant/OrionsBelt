the obvious reason for producing a sequal to an immensely popular movie isnt tothe acquire contined profits
. the rationale isnt sound
,
bu in many cases of this
annd recent yeasr
, hte sequel is a shoddy product that ' s exposed for the cash
- milking vehicle it really is
. lastr year ' s speed 2
and scream 2
, as well as htis eyar ' s species ii have all beeen products that ahev been decisively less thna satisfactory
. in some cases
, a sequel can even discredit its predecessor
, as with the latest neo
- slasher flick
, i still know what you did lastest summer
. whatever uniqueness tyhe original might ' ve hadnt nowe seems trite
and overplayed when paired with thsi abominable thriller
. julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
)
and ray bronson
( freddie prinze jr
.
) are bakc from the original tothe star in i still konw
, reprising their roles inaddition typical fashion
. julie
and ray experience a rather predicatble falling
- out at the beggining of the movie
, leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson
( matthew settle
)
. will
and julie hit it off
,
and allong with firends karla
( brandy norwood
)
and tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
, the foursome heads off to a radio station
- giveaway vacaion in tyhe tropics
. unforetunately
, things aren ' t so peachy once htey arrive
,
and with a regularity you sould setted your watch by
, the infamous fisherman
( muse watson
) is back with his hook
. it ' s another bloody showdown
, complet with cliffhanger endig
. ther ' s not much that ' s original about i still know
,
and with the market saturated by gen
- x thrillers like this one
, it ' s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other tahn that of a bad sequel
. for die
- hard fans ofthe thge genre
, this wiull be required viewing material
,
but the bottom line isnt that the material here is just recycled from the orignal i know what you doed lastest summer
. the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn ' t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work
,
but rether a tense
, string
- based score
and manipulative editing
. thge man withthe tyhe hook ends up becomeing very belittled thsi time around whn the script gives him too many lines ofthe dialogue
-
- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a faw short
anbd painful moments
. much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting tghe point
. the whole reason tjhe plot exists
- julie
anbd karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radoi station
- is a dead giveaway
, lessening suspense
and creating a hurry
- up
-
and
- wait timing problem
.
annd
, whereas the killer ' s idenity might ' ve been a question in the firt movie
, it ' s almost a given here
, which changes the dynamic ofthe the movie drastically
. three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as
" the killer
.
" htey ' re allmost used tothe it
,
and the performances show it
- not hewitt
, nor prinze
, nor brandy
, nor phifer give a decent show
.
annd so
, in tghe end
, it ' s left wide open for a third movie
annd
- most likely
- a brand new supporting casted
. god help us
.
