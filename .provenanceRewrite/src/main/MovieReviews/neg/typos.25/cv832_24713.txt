pre
- review note
: seeing as the only concern of body shots is
" sex
"
, i will be forced tothe refer to that particular act innumerable times througout the duration ofthe this review
. because of this
, i will try tothe vary owrd descriptions of
" sex
"
( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms
,
adn
\ or your name isnt jerry falwell
, you are kindly invited to hit the x up onthe the left corner ofthe your screen
)
, so if ther happens to be a word you come across
and cannnot comprehend
, fret nto
, it ' s most likely jsut another way of referring tothe
" sex
"
. i thikn we ' d all agred tath any owrd unsed incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appretiate my attept tothe liven uv wqat could potentially be a vrey boring review
.
though not as boring as the movei whlch makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as livley as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god konws what
. body shots isnt a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously
, in the way you ' d normally expect tothe see a violent attack
. it ' s about people who thiunk about screwing
, seek it out
,
and talk about it
. these are things we all dont
, somtimes
. the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering tje simplicities of sexual acts
. their lives center around the next sexual encounter
,
but they seemed depressed
. it ' s as if fucking isnt all they hvea to look forward to aftter a busy workweek
. at its core body shots is a message movie
, the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers iin order tothe turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) isnt a moralist with nothing new to say
. his characters don ' t communicate anytying of interest tothe each other
, so cristoffer gives them an oportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera
. htey voice simplistic platitudes like
" i liuke to come
" or
" sex wihtout love equals violence
"
. huh
?
and yes that isnt as complex as this movei ' s observations get
. the charachters are stupid
anbd shallow
, wtih not noe registering as anytying more
. hte plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal blessure
,
hten the aftter math
( the morning after
) of such events
. we meet the charachters as they speak driectly to us
, confiding infact us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy
. i owudl normally go into the characters
and the actors who play them
, giving you the pros
and cons
,
but for this film i cannot
. i ' m not trying tothe be clever or witty
,
but i honestly hardly remember anything tyhat would set them apart fomr thte others
. with the exception of trent
( plyed by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, the rest fade into each other
-
- a patchwork of fake breasts
, defined abs
, pearly white teeth
,
and creamy
, flawess skin
. i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one
, only beacuse his character gets thte worst lines
(
" sex without love equals violence
"
)
. infact between all the confessionals
, cristoffer films everyting like a headache commercial
, with blurry slo mos
and dramatic head turning
. the fact that thsi directer at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me
. this film is made without one iota ofthe intelligence or insight inot the generation that its tag line claims tothe be defining
. if body shots is meant tothe sday tht all twentysometyhings are idiotic
anbd f
*
* k
- obsessed
, fine
, i don ' t have any problem with a film thyat tries tothe persuade me to htink a certain way
,
bu cristoffer only gives us one side
. additinally that noe side isn ' t even intertaining
; yhe characters indulgue in buggery without an ounce of sexiness
. or realism
. one sexual encounter tkaes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive charachters
. they suddenly have vigourous intercourse with each other for no appraent reason
( otehr than thyat they both happen tothe be standing next tothe each otehr
?
?
? alas
, if it could only be that eazy
?
?
? kidding of course
)
,
then
, not only isn ' t it erotic
, it isn ' t real
. it doesn ' t feel liuke an authentic sexual encounter
. eveyr f
*
* k scene in this film
(
anbd there are many
) is treated in the smae unsexy manner
. body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film
. it shows us none of the blessure thast shoud go along with it
,
and most of all
, it fails to sohw us why its characters love mkaing it so much if htey seem to hate the act ofthe actually doing it
. the resulting search for nookie
(
and yuo can take that cookie
?
?
?
) over one night leaves us witht several tedeous plot lines tothe follow
. the main concern is much ado over a rape taht may or may not haev occurred
. the film shows us twpo separate versions of thte possible rape
( oney where it is consensual the other where it is not
)
and in both versions the young actress playing tyhe possible victim gets her shirt torn off
. this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently
,
adn if memory serves me i can ' t think of one film that hasnt done so
,
and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 ' s next to wall strent
. unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care
, not hte writter
, the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to hvae wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here
,
though boogie nights succeeded
. it was similarly moralistic
,
but it gave us two different viewpoints
; it showed us how hte lifestyle of porn enticed its characters
,
and it showed us the possible fall
- out of such a decission
. the characters infront boogie nights were as idiotic as the charachters are here
,
but anderson seemed to care baout them
. he gave them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing
bu raging hormones
. he preaches to us
, by using his cahracters to preach tothe us
. this is not thge way tothe get any message across
. why not jsut direct a public sevice announcement on the perils ofthe hittin ' skins
? cristofer kind of does that
,
though without an ounce ofthe insight
,
and witht a helping of leering exploitation
.
