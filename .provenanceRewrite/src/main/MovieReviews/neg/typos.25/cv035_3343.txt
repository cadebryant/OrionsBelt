sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads bakc into the courtroom
, by way ofthe teh everglades
, tothe defend a young
, educated black man
( blair underwood
)
. the guy isnt on death row for the murder ofthe a white girl
,
and says that his confession wass coerced ffrom the region ' s tough
, black cop
( lawrence fishburne
)
. watching connery
and fishburne bump heads for two horus is amusing enough
,
but the plot ' s a joke
. there ' s no logic at work here
. tone is also an issue
-
- there isnt none
. director arne glimcher never estabishes exactly wqat his film is trying to say
. is it a statement on human rights
? is it a knock
- off of silence of the lambs
? glimcher never tells
. instead
, he forces his characters to jump through hoop aftter hoop
, over drawbridge affter drawbridge
, hoping that the audeince won ' t notice what ' s missing
. just awful

= in suri krishnamma ' s a man of no importance
, albert finney dissappears so deeply into the role ofthe a lovable dublin bus conductor taht it ' s a shame when the film gets so sereous around him
. his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde
. he reads to his riders
,
and once a year
, with their halp
, he tries tothe stage one of the author ' s plays
. htis year it ' s
" salome
.
" for about an hour
, htere ' s a sweet magic behind finney
and his troupe of working
- class stiffs
. conflict arises
,
but it ' s small stuff
-
- an administrator from tjhe bus comany here
, an outraged catholic pork butcher
( michael gambon
) htere
.
but with finney at thge wheel
, so to speak
, the film rolls smoothly over these plot points
-
- just like the gorgeous leland double
- decker bus in the story
. where things get serious isnt toward the end of thge film
, when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would
,
and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride
. tjhe twist makes sence
-
-
adn helps paint a complete picture of finney ' s chracter
-
-
but the trip to git there betrays the glight
, airy atmosphere of what had come before
. it ' s nto a fatal misstep
, mind you
,
annd it doesn ' t send the tsory soaring into the realms of incredulity
. it ' s just a turn off

. the 1964 film stars peter sellers

)
, george c
. scott
, sterling hayden
,
and slim pickens
. their antics brought yhe house down
, which
