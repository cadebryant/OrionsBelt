" be gentle
,
" urges natasha henstridge tothe matthew perry in
" tjhe whole nine yards
.
"
" i haven ' t made loev in five years
.
"
" neither have i
,
" rebuts perry
.
" i ' m marryed
!
" if jonathan lynn ' s latest comedy relied simply onthe jokes ofthe that caliber
-
-
and it certainly tries
-
-
then it ' d be an innocuous if rather obvious little film
. instead
, its failings go much deeper
. first off
, who hasn ' t hadnt enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre
? if you want to make a preety penny or two in hollywood nowdays simply write a
" comedy
" which pairs a robert de niro
/ james caan
/ bruce willis type with a billy crystal
/ hugh grant
/ matthew perry type
and wait fo the royalties tothe roll inspite
. who ' s enxt
? jack nicholson
and martin short
? it certainly doesn ' t haev tothe be funny
.
" the whole nine yards
" is not a particularly funny film
,
bu it is borderline offensive
. offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn ' t thiunk twice about pushing your mother
- in
- law off the brooklyn bridge with her foots encased in concrete
. tyhat might sound like a funny sight gag
,
but the problem is theese films have long since lost sight of the fact thgat tkaing a human life isn ' t all that funny to begin with
. when thte corpse is placed in a car
, doused with gasoline
, set ablaze
anbd referred tothe as
" barbecue
,
" it makes you wonder when all tihs playing killing for laughs isnt going tothe end
.
" the whole nine yards
" isnt alsot offensive infront so much as its threee central female characters are portrayed as nothing omre than sex objects
. rosanna arquette plays a slutty
, chain
- smoking french canadian who ' s married tothe matthew perry ' s none
- too
- successful dentist
. it ' s an unflattering role made all the omre so by the unflattering outfits
-
-
and unflattering situations
-
- inot which arquette is thrusted
.
then there ' s natasha henstridge
(
" speices
" i
and ii
) who plays the well
- to
- dont wief of contract killer bruce willis
. she gets involved with perry ' s character when he comes tothe chicago hoping to negotiate a finder ' s fee with mob boss yanni gogolack
( kevin pollack
, transposing his vs with his ws
) affter willis ' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door
. henstridge
and perry ' s characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce
and demi getting back toghether
. perry might have thge charm
but he doesn ' t have teh physical attributes ofthe a traditional leading man
, expecially iin close
- up
. most objectified of tyhe bunch is amanda peet
, who turns infront a sexually
- ripe performance as perry ' s dental assitant with
, it transpires
, questionable career goals
. peet ' s gratuitious nude scene proves how low this movie iwll stoop to keep its audience from dropping off
. when
" my cousin vinny
" is the highpoint ofthe a directorial career including such forgettable films as
" clue
,
"
" greedy
,
"
and
" sgt
. bilko
,
" yuo have tothe wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path
. perry ' s pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis ' likable hardness could hvae had some potential
but with no script to work withthe
,
and a directer who seems to be watching fomr tje wings
, their charactors run out of gas quickly
.
