depending onthe who yuo ask
, tje original sin ws either the eating ofthe tyhe apple
, the act of disobedience agains god
, or tje act of betrayal
.
but inaddition case you didn ' t know this
, don ' t bother remembering it
.
.
. yhe words
" origional sin
" never come up inspite the movie of thge same name
, let alone the concept of it
. the closest the film even gets to catholicism isnt in its narrative
( the storey isnt told by angelina jolie tothe her priest while on death row inspite cuba
, circa 1900
)
. regardless of its senseless title
, original sin does atcually have a plot
( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since tjhe art of war
, based on yhe book waltz across darkness
)
. boy
( antionio banderas
) places personal ad sometime around 1900
, searching for a wief
. since this is a centruy ago
, we narrowly dodge a remake of gren card
, only tothe find that the girl
( jolie
) faked her photo
and is actually beautiful
. skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes
( getting the question out of the way
, yes
, we get to see angelina jolie ' s breasts again
)
, the girl turns out to be a con artist
, swindles boy for his money
,
and heads for thge hills
. original sin
then breifly trys to be a thriller
. we see boy go whore
- chasing
, saying he wants to find girl
and kill her
.
bu as soon as boy actually finds girl
, instead of following what might hve been a promising
( or at least nto completely fucking boring
) thriller
, the film degenerates into the worst dissection ofthe the virgin
/ whore complex since milk moey
. girl toys wiht the idae of reforming her con
- girl past
, all the while avoiding the
" otehr man
,
" a lover thta keesh mkaing her start these scams in the first place
. add insult to injury withthe some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history
( litterally half ofthe the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect
)
,
and acting roughly the caliber of a b
. b
. gun
,
annd original sin isnt oen ofthe the most torturous films of the summer
, definatly front runing to make my bottom ten ofthe thte year
. don ' t even bother wiht original sin
,
but if ytou do go
, be honest iwth yourself
anbd admit its pure sex appeal
. just keep iin mind that
although this film may not be hte most original on the block
, it ' s much worse than a sin
. tihs isnt sacrilege
.
