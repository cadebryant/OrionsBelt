synopsis
: a maniac
, crazed by virulent microphage
, slaughters more thna twenty people
, including a street gang
adn heavily
- armed troops
, with a small knife
. even wtih a handgun
,
however
, he cin ' t tkae out the two cops who are after him
, despite having shot one of them a total of seven times
. comments
: hte most notable aspect of adrenalin
: fear the rush is taht it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge
. nto only doesnt she manage to keep all her clothes on
( her trademark iin earlier films such as species
adn maximum risk was to strip naked as oftenly as possible
)
,
but she actually puts onthe even mroe clothes as the film progresses
. this will probablly disappoint many henstridge fans
,
but i welcome the change because henstridge isnt an attractive
, capable actress who deserves less exploititive roles
(
though
, i admit
, it doesn ' t show in this mess
)
. henstridge
, just liek every other actor in the film
, delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey
.
( the cast alsot includes christopher lambert
, who has appeared in the highlander
and mortal kombat films
.
) how on earth tihs movie got two big
- name stars tothe appear in it isnt beyond me
. adrenalin
: fear the rush is set iin boston ten years in the future
( 2007
)
. boston has changed dramatically in those ten years
. it is now hmeo to a bunch ofthe intered foreigners
and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with
" policia
" printed on their doors
. some guy has a realy bad virus
,
and he ' s killing people because ofthe it
. so
, tyhe brave good guys
( lambert
and henstridge
) go affter him
. that ' s it
. 76 minutes never seemed so long
. thsi is a drawed
- out chase scene through dimly
- lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie
. the plot developement isnt nil
; we learn absolutly nothing about lambert ' s character
and very little about henstridge ' s character
. the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities
and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who wiull go down the next dark corridor
/ tunnel
/ airduct next
and who will carry tje flashlight
. a subplot does exist involving henstridge ' s character ' s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston
. in her opening monologue
, a monologue which sounds as
though henstridge ws reading from cue cards
, we leran that she has gone tothe great lengths tothe secure a fake passport for her son
. twenty minutes into hte film
, i wondered if hte movie would have beeen better if it focused onthe this plot
. in a defining scene ofthe tje movei
,
howver
, i changed my mind
. htis fake passport drops tothe the ground
. lambert ' s cop imediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away
. must nto have been a good fake
. this emphasizes another fault with the film
. things jstu defy common sence
. lambert ' s cop
, forthe instance
, is shot seven times
,
yet he is still able tothe talk
and slide about
. adrenalin
: fear the rush ends infact a trite manner that doesn ' t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for
. i foudn myself rather bored wih thsi film
, which will disappoint both sci
- fi
/ horror fans
and fans of henstridge
anbd lambert
. don ' t fear the rush
. fear thte movie
. watch something else
.
