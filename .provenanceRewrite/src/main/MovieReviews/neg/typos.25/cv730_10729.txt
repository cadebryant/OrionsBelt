how do you judge a film that is so bad
,
but intentionally so
? inwhich spiceworld
, the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal
: mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film
and haveing a lot of fun doing it
. if that was their goal
, they did a fantastic job
. so is it fair tothe give it such a low grade whn it wasn ' t really meant tothe be much better than thsi
? honestly
, i ' d rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades
, so does that mean i graded it inaccurately
? truth be known
, i don ' t really thiunk i cxan answer this question
. tothe understand spiceworld
, you hvae to understand tjhe spice girls
. unless ytou ' re very
* very
* young
, or fairly older
, ytou probably hvea at least heared ofthe them
. tehy ' re a group of five busty british babes who ' ve hadnt
# 1 hitted singles
and whose debut album sold millions
. htey ' re primarily adored by pre
- teen girls who hope someday the contents of theri training bras might match those of ginger spice ' s
( rela name
: geri haliwell
) wonderbra
. all five ofthe thge girls have these
" spicy
" names for hwihc they are better known tahn their real names
. there is thge aforememtioned ginger spice
, as well as sporty spice
( melanie chisholm
, or mel c
.
)
, scary spice
( melanie brown
, or mel b
.
)
, baby spice
( emma bunton
)
,
and posh spice
( victoria addams
)
,
and all ofthe them
, to some degree or another
, resemble their stage names
. tyhe spice girls took tghe world by storm
,
and spiceworld isnt atcually a good
- humored spoof of all that transpired durig their quick rise to fame
. it ' s quite nice tothe see what good sportscar the girls are
(
and not jsut the one dubbed sporty
) about poking fun at themselfs
. they don ' t take themslves too seriously
,
and that ' s probablly the best hting about them
. it ' s also surprising how natural they seem in front of teh camera
* acting
*
,
and not just singing
anbd dancing
. they ' re not flawless by any means
,
but forthe the most part
, they deliver their lines without feeling staged
,
and
, like them or nto
, we get the sense the five are very at home within their charactors
( which seems reasonable usance they portray themselves
)
. what makes the film bad isnt tht extreme fans of the spice girls won ' t get enough of their music
, while thge rest of us don ' t get enough of a movei
. the real point of this is to look at the spice girls fo over ninty straight mintues
. most of the film is very blas
?
,
but several parts are downright boring
,
and
then they ahev those sporatic moments that actually make us laugh out loud
! if yuo ' re a big fan of the group
, you probably won ' t get anough ofthe wqat you want
,
and if ytou ' re not a big fan
, you get too much time devoted to nothing more than
" look at us
" moments
. forthe the right crowd
, the
" music video
" sequences will be the highlights of the film
,
but for others
, they iwll serve as three
- minute lulls in a hectic
-
but
- overall
- uneventful storyline
. other key actors include richard e
. grant as clifford
, the spice girls ' manager
, alan cumming as thte film
- maker piers cutherton
- smyth who attempts tothe make a documentary of teh group
, george wendt as martin barnfield
, a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movei
,
and roger moore in a small
, self
- parodizing role
. all provide relatively good performances
, keeping in mind once agian that this film wasn ' t meant to be acted seriously
. even meat loaf shows uv as dennis the bus driver
and seems to have funn with it
. hwile this film is continuously compared to the beatles ' a hard day ' s nigth
, i htink taht is an unjust comparison
. it isnt supposedly the movei studio that first mad thge comparsion by way of press kits
,
bu i don ' t think drector bob spiers
, nor the spice girls
, intended it to be so
. i think the studios were just trying to boost hype
adn interest in the film
,
and have instead
, come off rather pretentious
. i don ' t think thsi film is trying to be anything more than a fun
, satrical look at a gropu that got so big
, a movie seemed the next likely step
.
and waht could ' ve been better than a self
- indulged
yet self
- mocking approach
? probably nothing
,
and so it is
. spiceworld is a movei i thought would be embarassing to enjoy
,
bu now instead
, i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn ' t even give a good review
. it ' s bad
,
but it succeeds inaddition eveyr way it intended
. it gives the spice girls a chance tothe play hwile allowing all thsoe obsessive fans out htere tothe indulge in eveyr brainless moment
. perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick
. if that ' s the case
, the movie ' s gimmick is that it
* isnt
* such a gimmick
! you might be saying
,
" a spice girls movie
? come on
!
"
,
but when it comes down to it
, i think that ' s the point
.
