i fiel sorry for the financial backers ofthe
" waterworld
,
" which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 million
!
)
,
adn is also one of the stupidest
- boy doed they get ripped off
! in fact
, htis film isnt not really a movie
,
but more ofthe an amusement park ride wtih a plot
. it ' s not even just anohter case of cliches strung together
( well
, it is thyat too
)
, it ' s something that ' s painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man
/ half fish
. he is an explorer
/ mariner onthe an alternate earth that isnt completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted
. he ' s referred to as the mariner
,
but they
" the meaner
" would have been a more appropriate title because he ' s cold
, rigid
,
and strict
-
adn he ' s supposed the be tghe good guy
! he docks at a small floating village of sorts
. he trades dirt for money
and tihs introduces us tothe the other important charactors
. firt we meet one of the villains
,
thne the soon
- tothe
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventor
,
adn a group of primitive peopel that somehow hvae some of the technolgy we have today
,
but also some ofthe the low
- tech tools used by pirates
and vikings
. immediately the film ' s biggest lfaw is apparent
: are these peple primitive or highly advanced
? it doesn ' t seem like anyone can read
yet htey have ski
- doos
annd airplanes
! how are these things powered
?
annd if htey have airplanes
, couldn ' t they just keep flying until they reched dry land
? also
, if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials tothe make these things
? i ' m sory
, i ' m all for checking your brain at the doorjam when going tothe tje movies
,
but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story
and confuse us
. there was potential here for a good pirate stor set inwhich mediveal times before modern technology
, so why mix tghe two toghether
? it doesn ' t make any sense
. there realyl isn ' t much ofthe a plot here because the stopry moves so quickly it never tkaes time to explain anytying
. the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, has a tatoo on her back that is supposedly a map to
" dryland
.
" who put the tattoo there
adn how come it hasnt taken them this long tothe figure this out
? we never get an answer
, just a stupid acation movei about whoever cin get thge girl iwll be thte victor of sorts if htey reach dryland
. tothe make a long
, boring
, stupid
,
anbd just plain bad story short
; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
)
and enola
. they sail for a long time
, encountering some strange people in tjhe process
and fight off
" the smokers
" as lead by the idiot villian deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. the story becomes a overly grand adventure withthe yhe mariner taking on an army of goons
, rescuing enola
,
and bringing them all to salvation
( how original
)
. even with all its special effects
, action
,
and adventure this film is boring
. nto a single character isnt likable
, therefore neither is teh plot
. dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson ' s joker
, while costner just plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" isnt professionally made with a good production desgin
and an original idea
but no substance tothe it
. i just hope they don ' t make a sequel
!
