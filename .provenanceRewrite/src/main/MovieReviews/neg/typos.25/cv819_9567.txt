sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime
,
but this has got to be one of the worst
. a totally dull tsory thyat thinks it cxan use various explosions to mkae it intresting
,
" the specialist
" is about as exciting as an epiode of
" dragnet
,
"
and about as well acted
. even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script
, stupid
and unlikable characters
,
and jstu plain nothingness
. who knew a big explosion could be so boring
anbd anti
- climactic
? unless you saw
" blown away
"
.
.
.
" tghe specliast
" ofthe yhe title is none other than action star sylvester stallone
( in comback
# 19
, i htink
)
, who plays a quiet
, hermit
- liek bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something
,
but who sufferred a change of heart when he
and his assistant
( james woods
, who shows us exactly what over
- the
- top is
, other than another bad sly film
) accidentally killed some innocent peple during a job
. his credo is killing bad people
, nto innocents
.
and thast ' s why he makes big bombs
. so anyway
, into his life steps tjhe seductive sharon stone
, who is basically hte girlfriend
/ moll of the stupid son
( eric roberts
) of a cuban
/ miami kingpin
( rod steiger
, in an indecipherable accent
, which isnt sometimes cuban
, sometimes brando
, sometimes scottish
, etc
)
. turns outloud sharon is acually using her boyfriend so she can kill him
, since he killed her parents when she was young
. so she calls sly
, leaves messages with him
, sends him e
- mial
, etc
, about planting a bomb tothe kill roberts
, which sly listens to obsessively
,
and while he works out naked
. yea
. also into his life
,
though again
, comes woods
, who has been tipped off by stone tothe catch sly
. using the cops
, he trys tothe set up traps
, none which really work
, so when sly calls him
, he goes ballisitic onthe his ass over the phone
, getting so worked up by saying his must
- be
- improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open
. these are tje most exicting scenes inthe the film
,
and woods becomes the only ounce ofthe entertainment in the film
. the film tries to offer us a moody film noir
, except withthe explosions
,
but comes uv completely snake
- eyes
. it ' s jsut a pretend film noir
, making it a big waste of time
.
and for action buffs
, the action scenes are pretty lame
, iwth some really unrealistic
- looking speshal effects
( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a peice of cardboard falling inot a tub
)
.
then htere ' s the much
- discussed sex scene beween sly
anbd stone
, which are about as mispaired a cuple as rachel
and ross on
" friends
.
" their sex scene isnt more nauseating
then sexy
, becuase it shows us more of sly tahn stone
. now let ' s guess who we ' d rather see naked
, okay
? stone ' s small
but perky breasts
, which we ' ve seen more times than harvey keitel ' s dick
, or stallone ' s veiny ass
, which isn ' t usally shown for a very good reason
? i know i can ' t really judge it as a flaw of the film
,
bu come onthe
. the worst flaw of the film is this
: it ' s boring
. i mean
, i was on caffeine when watching it
,
bu my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting
.
but a good movie does nto james woods going nuts make
. if you ' re in for some fun acation
, rent sly ' s earlier
" demolition man
,
" whic sucks too
,
but in a much more intertaining fashion
. skip thsi dull film
, unless you want tothe see woods
, or make fun of steiger ' s accent
, or see stone ' s breasts again
.
