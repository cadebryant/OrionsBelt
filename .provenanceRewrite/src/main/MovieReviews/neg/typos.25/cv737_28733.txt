" saving silverman
.
" writed by hank nelken
and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman
,
" saveing silverman
" is directed by ' hit comedy director ' dennis dugan ofthe such films as
" big daddy
,
"
" brain donors
"
and
" problem child
.
" it ' s a dismal
, thrid
- rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren ' s love interest come from a family of circus freaks
and be about tothe become a nun
. gross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants
.
" saving silverman
" is almsot saved by stars zahn
and balck
. these two are so comically talented tehy can take bad material
and still deliver thte goods
. they ' re in
" animal house
" mode while tje rest of the film trawls along
and comes up empty
. jason biggs can attribute his entire career to the luck of having been casted in thge smash hitted
" american pie
.
" peet shows some physical moves
but noone flair fo comedy here while detmer slaps a brave
, sweet smile onto her face
and soldiers through
