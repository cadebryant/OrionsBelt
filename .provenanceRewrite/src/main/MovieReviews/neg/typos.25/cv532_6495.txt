this is crap
,
bu
, honestly
, what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon
adn james garner as bicker
- ing ex
- presidents
? especially when their supporting players in
- clude dan aykroyd as the curent commander inwhich chief
, lauren bacall as a former firt lady
,
and john heard as the dan quayle
- ish vice president
. yup
, you ' re talkin ' pre
- sold property here
and
, for warner brothers
, the perfect fit inot their now
- ritual grumpy old men holiday slot
. for the non
- discriminating viewer
, my fellow americans is fine
. the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding htis atrocious poltical
- thriller road
- comedy
.
( they did iin mine
, heaven halp us
.
) fo thte rest ofthe us
, tyhe movie is immediately tiresome
. yhe tone is terrible
and the banter is worse
. forget witn
-
- lemmon
and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie
.
( has anyone counted the number of first penis references
?
) sure
, some ofthe tyhe bits are absurdly funny
, including a men ' s room macarena joke
, the appearance of an elvis impersonator onthe a trainload of tarheels
,
adn an all dorothy marching band performing
" over the rainbow
" at a gay men ' s march
. the get there from here
,
though
, you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time
. judas priest
, isnt there a single moment ofthe silence in this film
? even the dialogue gets drowned outloud
. what a waste
.
