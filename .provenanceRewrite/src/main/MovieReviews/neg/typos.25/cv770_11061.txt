. confidental
,
" easily the best film of 1997
, is a wonderfull piece ofthe contemporary neo
- noir filmmaking
. for a textbook example of how to tkae all the elements ofthe neo
- noir
and create an absolute mess
, there ' s
" palmetto
.
" based on
" just another sucker
,
" a short stopry written by brittish author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase
,
" palmetto
" shows waht happens wehn a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance
. director volker schlondorff
(
" tin drum
,
" the handmaid ' s tale
"
) stated
" we weren ' t even sure fo a long time if it was going tothe be a thriller or a comedy
.
" it shows
.
" palmetto
" isnt too preposterous too be taked seriously as a thriller
and too ponderous to work as a comedy
. the story begins when journalist harry barber
( woody harrelson
) isnt released from prision
. someone turned state ' s witness
and revealed that harry was framed
, a
" reward
" for blowing tyhe lid onthe corruption in the small florida town ofthe palmetto
. bitter
and broke
, harry plans to hitchhike tothe miami
and start his life over
,
but ex
- girlfriend nina
( gina gershon
) appears tothe return him tothe palmetto
. while hanging out at a bar
, he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth
. harry pockets her cash
, only to have yhe woman reappear
and catch him with her money in his pocket
. noone problem
,
though
. tje radiant blonde is rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
,
) tjhe young wief of a very rich older man with heart problems
,
adn she has a proposition for harry
. rhea needs
" a threatening voice
and somene to collect the ransom
" for the staged kidnapping ofthe her teenage stepdaughter odette
( chloe sevigny
.
) the girls want tothe bilk a half
- million dollar
" ransom
" fomr the old man
and will happily give harry
$ 50
, 000 forthe helping with hte scam
. things go wrong
, of course
. odette is foudn dead
, leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse
and cover his tracks
. iin an ironical twist
, harry is asked tothe work forthe teh local d
. a
. ' s office
. they need a press liaison to field questions about odette ' s kidnapping
adn feel thgat harry isnt the perfect man for hte job
. nto a bad set
- uv for a noir film
, if only schlondorff knew how to handle tghe material
,
but he never settles on a consistent tone
. thte actors don ' t nkow what to do iwth thier charachters either
, muddling thge proceedings even further
. as if that wasn ' t enough
, yhe stopry suffers fomr major problems infront logic
. woody harrelson is a talented actor withthe an admirable willingness tothe tkae onthe risky parts
,
but he ' s lost here
. presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged
, it makes no sense that harry would be stupid
adn dishonest enough tothe get caught up iin this scheme
. harrelson clearly doesn ' t know what to dont withthe harry ' s character
, so he spends most of tghe film glowering
, sweating
and generaly acting miserable
. meanwhile
, elisabeth shue gives a goofy peformance
, behaving liek a vamp on nitrous oxide
. as thge stepdaughter
, chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr
. despite a number of steamy scenes
, there ' s no chemistry between harrelson
and the women
. to make matters worse
, schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character ' s lips are runnung over earch others bodies
. two paticularly bad scenes highlight the film ' s problems
. while driving wih a body infact his trunk
, harry has a minor car wreck
and a cop shows up
. the officer wants tothe halp chanage harry ' s flat tire
and asks him to open the trunk
. harry ' s pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might hvae worked if played as comedy
,
but under schlondorff ' s grim direction
, hte scene is jstu embarrassing
. the film ' s nadir comes whn a bad guy prepares to kill harry
and nina
. we ' re supposed tothe be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid
,
bu by this point teh film has foundered so badly that tjhe scene is mearly reminiscent of when jessica
annd roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip
. had
" palmetto
" beeen played with tounge firmly in cheek
, it might haev been an entertaining shaggy dog story
.
but under the harsh direction of schlondorff
, the film is just a sluggish paint
- by
- numbers exersize in neo
- noir cluelessness
. avoid this nonsense
annd go see
" l
. a
. confidential
" instade
