,
annd the police are hot on harry ' s trail
. harry suddenly realizes he hasnt beeen framed while others ahve taken the ransom money
. can he get outloud ofthe htis mess
? opinion
: palmetto is a long
, uninteresting film with all the wrong fiel
. hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up oftenly
and consistently overestimates his own itnelligence
. htis farcical kind of character works best inspite an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof
.
but palmetto is played like a dark
, serious
, detective noir drama
,
and watching harry ' s bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction
. there ' s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts
, buttocks
, short skirts
, colored painted nails
,
and women ' s legs
. even when the focus is supposably on harry
and his dilema
, ytou can always notice tyhe side of elizabeth shue ' s breast forming a prominent foreground
. towords the end
, palmetto re
- focusses on plot for the grand finale
-
- a confusing explanation involving impersonators
, with woody harrelson handcuffed
and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals ' confession
. if you cxan imagine ' shemp ' from the threee stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo ' lingerie suspense ' thriller
, that ' s how outloud of synch tihs movie fiels
.
