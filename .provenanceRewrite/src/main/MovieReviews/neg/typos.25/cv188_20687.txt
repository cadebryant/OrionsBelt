an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects onthe an average moviegoer
. you may be scarred forthe life after seeing this petrified peice of garbage
, which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause ytou to ponder it ' s hollywood existence
. when i think of the screenwriters behind tihs film
, i picture a room full ofthe monkeys
. yhe monkeys are pounding on theri typewriters hwile scratching themslves
. all of the monkeys combine their efforts
, hop inaddition a cab
adn take the finished product downtown to director bob clark ' s office
. the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up
anbd down on clark ' s desk while flailing his arms
and shrieking
. the director appears to be deep inaddition thought
, until he slams his fist down onthe the desktop
and exclaims
` i love it
!
!
! ' the writing behind thsi project isnt embarrassing
. for your amusement
, i iwll explain thge plot
. dr
. kinder
( kathleen turner
)
and dr
. heep
( christopher lloyd
) are two ofthe the cold
- hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute
, where peculiar studies are gogin on
. as the stoyr goes
, there is an ancient myth explaining that babies
( ages 2
and under
) konw all hte secrets of the world from previous life experiences
. when they move past this phase
, htey become like any other drooling toddler
. kinder
and heep whant to unlock the secrets using their tust babies
, namely little sylvester
( sly forthe short
)
, who can break in or out of any given situation so effeciently that he would be right at home onthe the mission
: impossible team
. htere is so much crap drived from this premise
, despite the fatc it ' s virutally identical to the plot in look who ' s talking
!
( a far superior film in any league
)
. you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the oppening scene
. sylvester has broken out
and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect
and kung
- fu tactics
. question
: it ' s obvious the babies are super
- smart
,
but why are they able tothe fight liek jackie chan
?
? the adults in htis film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers
. it ' s a shock wehn writers will stoop htis low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes ' familiar home alone formula
. i also found it disturbing that the babies in thsi film have attitude
and endless 90 ' s noledge
, quoting numerous movies
and insulting their adult captors
. tyhe effects in baby geniuses
( similar tothe tje tlaking animals infront babe
) are pathetic
, the editing isnt a disaster
,
and the jokes are never funny
. the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting isnt the argument that the babies are
` cute '
. i suppose htey are
. i can admit tothe smiling a few times because the babys were cute
. other instances
,
though
, i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the scirpt
. ther are supporting charachters who hvae noone perosnality whatsoever
; theri entire existence is based on punch lines
. peter macnicol
and kim cattrall
, as an unwilling cuple who have adopted sylvester ' s twin
, are both miscast
.
then again
, i don ' t suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid
. meanwhile
, dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit inwhich the crotch iwth a monkey wrench
( hahaha
)
. i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs
. instead of watching this
, i woudl recommended filling your bathtub with cement
annd going snorkeling
. or perhaps you woudl consider going diving infact shark
- infested waters
. anything to avoid this painful movei
. the final line in the film
, spoken by the bratty sylvester
, is
` if they thikn i ' m donig the sequal for less tahn
$ 20 mill
, they ' re nuts '
. sequel
? please have mercy
.
