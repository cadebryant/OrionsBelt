. review by
: geoff berkshire i ' m not an overly cynical guy
. there ahev been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over tje years
.
however
, i hvea my limits
and i also have standards
. htis brings us to the subject at hand
: message in a bottle
, the big ticket romance that warner brothers ' unleashed apon the movie oging public jsut in tyme for valentine ' s day
. the story
, what little of it thyat there isnt
, involves boring chicago tribune repertwar theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing with her recent divorce
and trying tothe raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. during a brief stay somewhere in newyorker england she finds yhe titular message inthe a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean
. the letter
, written tothe a mystery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. upon her return
, theresa shares it with her best freind lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
and the entire city ofthe chicago
( thge newspaper publishes an artical baout it
)
. it turns out tath the message was written by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
)
and so theresa travels to north carolina
and tracks him down
. he turns out to have a colorful father
( paul newman
)
but is otherwise perfectly dull
and overly obsessed with sailing
. this is somehow attractive tothe theresa
and yhe two begin their awkward courtship
. ofthe course she doesn ' t tell him that she found his letter
, she wants to
but yhe rules ofthe tihs type ofthe film recquire him tothe fidn outloud later
( preferrably right aftter they first make love
)
. this way garret cxan get very angry
annd teh relationship cin be threatened
. the discovery ofthe tghe message
and garret ' s discovery that theresa discovered the message are realy the onyl two notewothy events that appen during the nearly twpo
anbd a quarter hour running time of htis film
. there ' s a truly lame subplot about garret ' s relationship with his dead wife ' s family
( he gets into a bar fight whith her brother
, played by john savage
)
anbd
hten the necessary tear
- jerking ending
. a funn way to pass the time is to tkae bets onthe exactly who will die
,
although it becomes pretty clear by tjhe second reel
. the actual death sequence is one ofthe the most ridiculously forced
,
and unintentionally humorous
, sequences filmed since
.
.
. well
, since costner ' s thte postman
( 1997
)
. message in a bottle is oney slow moving film
. last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer
annd meet joe balck
but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions enxt to this
. tehy also had reedeming qualities in tghe form of quality performances
and some stand outloud technical work
. message in a bottle hasnt a decent anough cast
but they ' re fighting tjhe material all the way
,
and losing badly
. costner
and
, especially
, wright
- penn are both likable
and attractive enough to cheer for
but their characters are simpley too boring
. they allso fail to ganerate any kind of rela romantic chemestry
. the supporting players are given very little to do
. the reliable douglas isnt particularly wasted
. old pro newman gives his all
and occasionally threatens tothe kick soem life inot this dead horse ofthe a film
. a confrontational scene he hasnt with costner near the end isnt especially well played
.
howver
, too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are
. the film is very polished on thte technical side tothe be sure
but it only works to undercut the tsory
. gabriel yared
, who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient
( 1996
)
and city ofthe angels
( 1998
) whith his scores
, overdoes it a bit here
. caleb deschanel ' s camera makes everything look a littel too beautiful
. do the offices of yhe chicago tribune relaly need tothe look heavenly
? the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only concidering all taht coudl hve been cut out
bu isnt also simply messy at times
. the real offender here isnt screenwriter gerald di pego
. working from a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( which i have not read
but hvae been told isnt on the same literary level as the bridges ofthe madison county
)
, di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts ofthe receet times
. its strict adherence to clich
? s brings to mind such disasters as i still knwo whta you doed lsat summer
( 1998
)
. there simply isn ' t an orginial scene in thsi film
. teh dialogue isnt rarley better than laughable
and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking
. this is directer mandoki ' s first film since when a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, the solid meg ryan
/ andy garcia romance
. he ' s simply going thru tjhe motions with this
. message in a bottle is easily yhe worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment
and vies with what dreams may come
( 1998
) as oen of the most misguided romances ofthe the decade
.
