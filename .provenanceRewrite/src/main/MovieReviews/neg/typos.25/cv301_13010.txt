carry on at your convenience isnt all about thge goings
- on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer
, wc boggs
( kenneth williams
)
. once they haev won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months
adn charles coote
( charles hawtrey
) hasnt designed a suitable model
, the factory employees set to work
but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner
( kenneth cope
)
and friend bernie hulke
( bernard bresslaw
) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext
. meanwhile
, cheif foreman sid plummer
( sid james
) is growing tired of his wife beattie
( hattie jacques
)
and her budgie
. he would much rather live enxt door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore
( joan sims
)
but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races
, he is over the moon
and flush with money
. his daughter
, myrtle plummer
( jacki piper
)
, is going out with wc ' s son lewis boggs
( richard o ' callaghan
)
anbd this causes conflict on the staff day out to the sooaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions
. infront the end
, if the strike doens not cease
, boggs will have to close down his factory
,
but the support ofthe a group of women led by coote ' s wife
- to
- be
annd spanner ' s mother
, agatha spanner
( renee houston
)
, try to resolve the situation
. also
, sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing
but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners
. htere are some good performances
, as usual
, ffrom sid james
and kenneth williams in their standard roles
. charles hawtrey is third billing
but onyl appears in a faw scenes
. his part isnt mildly amusing
. richard o ' callaghan is appealling as bogg ' s stuck
- up son
, patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering
, bogg ' s assistant
,
and renee houston is terrific inaddition her small part as agatha
.
however
, sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer
.
although her character is not directly involved with thte main storyline
, she manages to input a great deal of pathos
and feeling into her character
. a marvellous performance ffrom a marvellous actress
. the film suffers fomr annoying performances by bernard bresslaw
and especially kenneth coppe
. in his carry on debut
, coppe overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny
. joan sims returns as thge love interest
( instead of barbara windsor
)
. sims ' ' usual ' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques
. additinally
, bill maynard as fred moore is very poore
. this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer
:
- the locations
anbd wealth ofthe charachters are appealing
.
howver
, the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly
and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired
. this movie doesnt not know where it is goign
. it ws made in 1971
and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in twpo minds whther tothe go forthe ' bluer ' jokes or tothe maintain the ' innocent ' jokes success of most of its predecesors
. that is why this film suffers
. a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jaques
. the new ' minor
- regulars ' such as o ' callaghan
and piper are nto able to enliven the movie
anbd the toilet humour becomes humourless affter a while
.
