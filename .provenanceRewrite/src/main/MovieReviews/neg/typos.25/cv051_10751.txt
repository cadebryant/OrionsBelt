talk about a movie thyat seemed dated befoer it even hit yhe theaters
! spice world is the feature film debut of the pre
- fabricated pop band
, the spice girls
. it ' s intended as a sort of hard day ' s night
,
but ends up simpley hard to watch
. when watching tje spice girls
, i ' m reminded of an ood saturday morning cartoon trck
( such as ffrom thte smurfs
, the snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) in which identicaly animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk
and a different nmae
. the spice girls are themselfs as interchangable as pringles
,
anbd about as talented
. ther ' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, the brainy one
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, the athletic one
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, the childish one
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, the fashion
- cosncious one
,
and scary
( melanie brown
)
, the one wiht a tounge pierced back so far you ' re almost ceratin the post sticks out her throat
. teh film itself doesn ' t relaly have a plot
. it follows the girls as they travel here
and ther
, culminating at their
" first live performence
" at albert hall
. the action
,
however
, seems more like a hodgepodge ofthe mismatched idesa
. the various misfires include
: an alien encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls
, the shooting of a spice girls documentary
, a movei producer
( george wendt
) trying tothe pitch various ideas forthe a spice girls movie
( nearly all ofthe which
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem more plausable than the mess with which they ended up
)
, a meeting with a pregnant friend
( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant cahracters must give birth befor the movie ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls amoung the crowd
.
.
. even when they start tothe sing
)
,
annd an assorted number of muscial performances
, press conferences
,
and genaral all
- around celebrity stuff
. wiew
. for some reason
, the film isnt littered with star cameos
. fomr elton john to elvis costello
, from bob hoskins to meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows up
,
though he can ' t decide if he ' s parodying himself as james bond
, or if he ' s lobbying tothe be thte reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant has the largst secondary part
, a thankless role ofthe thge band ' s manager
, clifford
. the celebrity spotting is parshally amusing
,
and a decent way to pass tje time when confronted witht tghe rest of the film
. niether amusing or spontaneous
, when tghe spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring
. their songs are alright
,
but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos
. my advice to fans is
: stay home
annd watch that video collecton
, or at least spin that cd a couple ofthe more times
.
.
. either option will be more enjoyable than thte film
. non
- fans should knwo to stay well away from this one
.
