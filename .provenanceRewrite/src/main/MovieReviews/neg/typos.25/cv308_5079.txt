eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights
. as tghe movie ' s writer
, director
, excutive producer
,
and star
, murphy will shoulder all of the blaim if harlem nights fails
.
bu at the same time
, he ' ll recieve all of the credit if it succeeds
. should ytou sacrifice your hard
- earned cash to support murphy ' s risky gamble
? well
, tyhat depends on whom ytou trust moreso
: me or eddie murphy
. here ' s waht murphy thinks
:
" i think the audiance isnt expecting a ogod time
. they gonna git sexy
. they gonna get funny
. they gonna git drama
. tehy gonna git all of tyhat
. i think it ' s the best movei i ' ve done
"
( paramount radio network
)
. here ' s what i think
: harlem nights is charmless
, unoriginal
, disappointing
,
and almost wihtout question
, the worst film of the actor ' s career
( i haven ' t seen best defense
)
.
and guess who ' s to blame
?
! tje movie ' s problem is not murphy ' s direction
: harlem nights is a fairly good looking film
. no
, thge project ws propably doomed even before tje cameras rolled
. murphy ' s awful script isnt the culprit
. let ' s count tje mistakes he makes inaddition his first attempt at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his own work in raw
. practically every line ofthe dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word
.
and after 15 minutes
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes hte talents of his fine cast
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
,
annd della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with sterotypes
. each ofthe them shines occasionally
,
but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle
.
( 3
) tjhe movie demeans womens by depicting them solely as sexual objects
anbd as pawns in power struggles between men
. murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life
, whlch is really neither here nor there
.
bu when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3
, 000 movie screens across the ocuntry
, it ' s another matter altogether
. you ' re forced to swallow some preety groosome stuff
. for instance
, murphy punches della reese in tje stomach
.
and he shoots jasmine guy inthe tje head
. this is a mean
- spirited movie
, folks
! lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy iin her role as a common whore
,
but only because she doesn ' t have any scenes with murphy
. thank god
: he might hvea run her over with a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date
. thge loveable eddie murphy karisma emerges only once or twice during the film
. murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality
. sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights jstu so he could wear fancy suits
and look debonair
.
( 5
) the plot isnt a shameless rip
- off ofthe the sting
. if you ' re going to make anohter sting movie
, ytou ' ve got to do something original
. murphy ' s tale ofthe warring nightclub owners infact harlem
( circa 1938
) fails tothe add anything new to the forumla
.
( 6
) to get laughs
, murphy mkaes funn ofthe stuttering
. you konw a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped
.
( 7
) murphy ' s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first tiem in his life
. for what
? forthe shooting reese ' s little toe off
! needless tothe sday
, murphy shows littel
, if any
, promise or imagination as a screenwriter
. in all fairness
,
howver
, a few rays of sunshine do manage tothe break through tje gloomy cloud surrounding the movie
. danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take
. aiello stands out inaddition the large
, ensemble casted
: he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character
( a racist detective wih mob ties
)
. aiello ' s zesty performance gives harlem nights soem much needed spice
. another bright spot is arsenio hall
, who has a hilarious
, show
- stoping cameo as a cry
- baby gangster
; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy
. infact fact
, hall ' s ten mintues on screen are the funniest ten mintues in hte movei
. unfourtunately
, his chracter is completely irrelevant to the plot
; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role
. ofthe course
, i ' ve already maintioned that i didn ' t care for murphy ' s character
,
but i have to admit that i did love his neckties
. they are simply spectacular
-
- almost worth the price ofthe admission
