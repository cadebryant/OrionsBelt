. now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western
.
and thast record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws

( the best part of schumacher ' s tigerland
) as hte bad
- ass jesse james
. alas
, any sense of his charcter hasnt been left onthe tghe ranch
, leaving us with onyl cute chicks like ali larter
( minus thte whipped cream
) to watch
. the spin this time around
: fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war
, jesse james
( farrell

- 13 rating
) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome
adn boring
. the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton
and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming tath everyone should be hanged
, sucking out any energy left in tje film
. not tothe mention
: the real stopry ofthe jesse james
and his gang bears no ressemblance to the plot ofthe american outlaws
. instead
, teh movie is full of old
, outrageous tales about the wild west
-
- tales which went out ofthe style in 5
- cent magazines about a century ago
