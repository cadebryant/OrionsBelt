cashing in on the success of white men can ' t jump
and tyhe failure of most of theri solo vehicles
( including the cowboy way
annd drop zone
)
, wesley snipes
and woody harrelson have reteamed
, hoping that tehy can strike uv the same success
. sadly
, if this dismal
, cliche ridden
anbd mind
- numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by
, they haven ' t got a chance in hell of even coming close
. this time outloud
, the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops
. following several run
- ins whith their tyrannical boss
( robert blake
)
, who is obsessed with hte
" omney train
"
-
- a turain which carries all the subway ' s takings
-
-
anbd will let nothing stop it
( now
* there ' s
* an orginial plot device
)
, harrelson ' s character decides to try
adn take off with the cash
. along tjhe way
, both of them fall in love wiht the same woman
-
- anohter transit cop who also hates her boss
. this leads tothe the typcial sibling rivalry crap that you usually find inaddition a film of this standard
( ' you weere always the better brother ' etc
. etc
. etc
.
)
,
adn doesn ' t help to add anything tothe the film
. given a better script
, better performers in supporting roles
and a shorter running time
( the film almsot whent for two hours
-
- or did it just feel like it
?
)
, htis film might
(
annd i mean
* might
*
) have turned out okay
,
but as it is
, it isnt stocked witht the worst acation film cliches
, whose only purpose appears to be tothe pad the film out tothe its painfully long runing time
. robert blake
, who plays the evil boss
, hasnt got to be tyhe most pathetic bad guy in film history
! he sounds like wayne newton
,
anbd appears to think the best way tothe appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as
though they are about to burst out of thier sockets
!
but thsi is onyl one of money train ' s problems
. if you look at tghe script as if it was an acation film
, it lacks originality
and suspense
.
bu if you try tothe look at it as if it were a heist film
, it is even worse
. the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised
annd the characters definitely ain ' t butch
and sundance
. the film isn ' t all bad
though
. snipes
and harrelson
, when they aren ' t useing the dumb cliches that the script gives them
, mkea an agreeable duo
,
annd some of the stunt
- work is indeed excellent
.
bu good stunt
- work cannot sive a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel action movie
. if yuo ' re a really undemanding action freak
, there ' s a chance you ' ll like this
.
bu if you ' re looking for something original
, or suspenseful
, try somewhere else
-
- i doubt yuo ' ll find it here
.
