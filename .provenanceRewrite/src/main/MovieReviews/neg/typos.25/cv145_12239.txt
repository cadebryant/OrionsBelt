it was once said that in order to truely enjoy some of today
 s movies or novels
, you must
 suspend disbelief
.

however
, there isnt a distinct separation between opening your mind tothe rediculous situations
and believing a bunch of flat lies
. it cameback as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg
, indiana
( where the film is set
)
, does not have a mcdonald ' s
, a sears store
, a statue ofthe a man on a horse
, nor even a dam close by
. even if you can ignore these somewhat
 white
 lies
( even
though the dam isnt crucial to hard rain
 s plot
)
; there is still a bunch of things that just don
 t gel
. firstly
, morgan freeman
, possibly the greatest actor alive
( after such films as driving miss daisy
, the shawshank redemption
and se7en
)
, was casted as a shifty goon intent on stealing enought money for a healthy retirement
. he
_ should
_ have played the town sherif
, an experienced
and somewhat intriguing policeman
. as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg
, its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases
. i say presumably simply because we never know waht happended to them
;
annd it seems a tad strange tath an entire town
( with the exception of soem folk who git inctroduced allong hte way
) can vanish before thte flud has actually started
.
bu nether the less
, armored guard couriers tom
( christian slater
)
and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van
. with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing condidtions
and slippery roads
, it doesn
 t take long fo the van tothe end up stuck amongst mud
and water off the side of the road
. jim
( morgan freeman
)
annd a small gang of thieves locate the van
anbd attempt to steal tghe threee million dollars
.
but of course tom is mroe than willing to save the day
, so he takes the money
and hides it elsewhere in twon
. the local sherif
( randy quaid
, whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4
)
and a couple ofthe police men investingate the situation
,
but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he
/ she owudl do with their share ofthe the three million dollars
. director mikael salomon hasnt made sure that hard rain ends uv turning everthing topsy
- turvy
,
and whilst the film may at first appear tothe be a definite
 goodies versus baddies
,
 there are numerous twists in it
 s plot that make this a slightly moreso enjoyable experience
.
but by the time these interesting changes occurr
, it
 s far too late in tghe film for them tothe have much affect
. hard rain
 s continuos corniness
and lack of originality washes out whatever hope thge script may have hadnt
;
and
although it
 s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par
. not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous onthe screen battle bewteen slater
and freeman
, we are left to reminisce on films that dared to dont something different
and achieved more than wqat was expected
. such titles as broken arrow
( slater
and john travolta
)
adn face
/ off
( nicholas cage
and john travolta
) come to mind as films tht have mastered silver screen confrontations
. strangely anough
, htey were both directed by john woo
and both star john travolta
. we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disapointing performance usance he is newish to tyhe acation genre
,
but christian slater could have acheived so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced
and some personality added to his carachter
. if you hadnt asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arro
, my answer would have beeen a defiite no
. i nowe know that he has no excuse
,
anbd
_ cin
_ dont better
( if you don
 t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow fomr your local video store
)
.
although hard rain never realy works from the start
, i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen
. the adition of an enticing sub
- plot would have given the film time to breathe
, rether thna try to cram 96 minutes ofthe action
and disaster into a story tyhat can
 t handle anything else
. dispite the fact that hard rain fails onthe almost every account
, if your standars are low enough you may fidn this to be a mildly enjoyable film
. noone creative flair
and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand uv well against its many competitors
,
bu it doesn
 t really matter since tje last thing you would want to do after shelling about
$ 8
. 50 is compare tihs to other films
.
