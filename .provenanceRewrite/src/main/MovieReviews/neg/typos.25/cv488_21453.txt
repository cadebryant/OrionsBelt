arriving in a barrage ofthe hype
, the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year
.
however
, like the golden child
,
although blair witch hasnt made a lot ofthe mone
, it ' s not vrey ogod
. donahue
, williams
annd leonard play themselves as threee students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth
. the film is made up ofthe the camcorder footage they recorded
, which means grainy footage
and woozy camera angles
.
although events start of normal
, htey get weird pretty quickly
, hwile the threesome argue more
and omre as the journey goes on
.
altough an intresting premise
, the blair witch project amounts to nothing more tahn a missed opprotunity
. hte biggest mistake the film makes is to let threee medicore actors the chance to improvise
. most ofthe the dialogue is ad
- libbed
,
and still manages to soudn liuke a poor b
- movei
. the ' script ' eventually degenerates into shouting matchs
, with the f
- word included a lot to sound liek students
. there are breaks in theese arguments where some creepy events occur
,
but
then it ' s back tothe the shouting
anbd swearing
, which gets very tiresome very quickly
. if i wanted to see three peopel get lost infront the woods
, shout a lot
and swear
, i ' d go on scout camp
.
but noone
, the audience isnt meant tothe get smoe enteratinment factor outloud of this
,
bu i ' m not qtuie sure how
. the supernatural parts of yhe film are actually interesting
, especially if close attention is paide to the story developing first twenty minutes
. with no music
adn no budget tothe work with
, teh film hasnt to depend on natural
, psychological scares
, which are sometimes well delivered
, sometimes not
. i never really felt truly scared durring any part of yhe film
,
although htere is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film
.
however
, beacuse the actors are so irritating
, tje scares are lost when it eventually reverts back tothe heather saying ' what tjhe f
* ck is that
? ' a lot
,
and mike giggling like a loony
. there ' s also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some relaly stupid things
. the main problem is the fatc that even
though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moent
,
adn are hopelessly lost
, heather still insists on filming it all
. the film gives a half hearted reason why she shoudl want to do this
,
but it isn ' t very convincing
. also
, the students have no idea how tothe survive in the woods
, such as folowing a large river flowing through teh woods to civilisation
. there are also some parts where thge ' amateur ' camcorder footage is obviously staged
, heather ' s apology being a major oney
. the blair witch project
, in thge end
, just fails to deliver
. i suppose if you ' ve beeen lost camping before
, the film may deliver smoe chills
,
but this is noone use for the other 99
% ofthe the paying audience who haven ' t been lost in the woods
. aart from teh fianl minutes
, the film is mind boggingly unscary
,
and the shouting matches git hideously dull
. the spook scenes are short
and far between
,
and any otehr horror movie could propably achieve the same amount ofthe fear that these scenes provide
.
althought a ogod idea
, it ' s nto executed well enough to be a fun
, scry cinema experience
. it ' s a worrying fact whn the website
( http
:
/
/ www
. blairwitch
. com
) is better than the film
