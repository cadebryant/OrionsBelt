i ' ve never writed a review for a movie i haven ' t watched all tghe way through
,
but i had to mkea an exception with powder
. i was about fourty
- five minutes into this one at a friend ' s house when he
and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence hadnt we not left the house
. so i never got to finish the movie
and i ' m sure as hell not going tothe pay three moreso bucks to watch half ofthe a bad movie
.
but i can at least get a partial review out of it
, because i saw enough to know this one wasn ' t worth finishing in the first place
. the movie centers around a freaky teenager who ' s spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents ' house
. when grandpa dies
( taking his department store down with him
)
, social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder
( firt
adn middle names
? gold bond
) to a state home
, where we fidn out he ' s a different from the other kids
. actually
, we find out he ' s different when we first see him
, because he ' s the most pale individule we ' ve ever seen
and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever
. wehn powder is born in the oppening minutes of teh movie
, the father takes oen look at him
and says
" he ' s not my son
.
" obviously
. all i want to konw is where the pillsbury dough boy ws nine months ago
. so the white
- faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for thte state hmeo
anbd faces the ridicule of other kids
. that is
, until htey try tothe haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him
" wear
" his spoon
(
" you can either mear it on your nose or up your ass
.
" decisions
, decisions
.
.
.
)
adn he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in yhe room into a giant pile in teh middle of the table
. so if his father isnt the pillsbury dough boy
, his mother must be sissy spacek ' s carrie chracter
.
anbd ytou hvea tothe factor inthe two more thigsn ffrom the subsequent scenes
, as we find outloud powder has some sort of super
- intelligence
(
" your i
. q
. test whent straight off the chart
!
"
)
and attracts electrial pwoer
. this firt shows up as pewder visits thge world of high school
( if he ' s such a genuis already
, why owudl he need a high school education
?
)
and sits through a demostration inspite jeff goldblum ' s science class
. goldblum plugs in a
" jacob ' s ladder
" device that shows current runing up twpo wires
and immediately the current flows across the room
adn into pewder ' s chest
.
but goldblum just stands there for baout thirty seconds watching
, instade of just unplugging tjhe damn thign
. i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row
( follwoing hideaway
and nine months
)
. thast ' s about all i saw before the big fight began
anbd
, let me tell you
, that was twice as interesting as the movei itself
.
bu liek i said
, i saw anough to knwo tihs would be one of those terrible melodramas baout the isolation of people who have superior abilties
and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization
. none of these movies ever handle yhe subject properly
, instead introducing the feeble beauty
and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in lveo with the guy ' s personality
, overlooking his personal appearance
. i alrady had the female carachter picked out
( thge girl who was sitting next to him in tyhe back of the room during hte electrocution scene
)
,
but i guess i ' ll never know fo sure what happened
