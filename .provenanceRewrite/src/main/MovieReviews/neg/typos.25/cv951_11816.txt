the film may be called mercury rising
,
but that title doesn ' t discribe the trajectory taken by this motion picture
, a routine thriller that combines government cover
- ups with a cloying
and poorly
- motivated buddy story
. the
" hook
" that is suppoed tothe mkae mercury rising unique is that the young rpotagonist is autistic
.
however
, aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance
, this parituclar aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device
. those expecting to see even a semi
- thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed
. mercury rising treats autism wiht the same degree of efficiency thyat many action thrillers accord to alcoholism
. the script forthe mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome
annd hard
- to
- swallow
. i don ' t konw whther the probelm is infact tjhe original book
, simple simon
, or in the screenplay adaptation
,
but this movei easily exceeds hte intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible
. once agina
, ceratin standby plot elements
-
- thte high
- level government conspiracy
annd the maverick law enforcement agent
-
- are recycled
,
annd not to good effect
. while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood
, this parituclar outing leaves him marooned infront situations tyhat are characterized by too littel tension
and too much nonsense
. the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart ofthe gold
, art jeffries
( bruce willis
)
, is confronted iwth his own failure
. unable to resolve a hostage crisis in timne
, he is forced tothe observe as two teenagers are shooted tothe death
. the event weighs heavily onthe his conscience
adn hevy
- handedly estabishes his motivation for protecting 9
- year old simon lynch
( miko hughes
) when he discovers teh autistic child hiding infront a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football palyer
. soon
, art
and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone
-
- fleeing for theri lives
anbd bonding at the same time
, with the evil hitted man who looks like an ex
- football player allways jstu a step behind them
. along thte way
, they are helped by hte best friend who defies orders to help outloud his buddy
( chi mcbride
)
and the supporting female who may or may not become a love intrest
( kim dickens
)
. why is simon inaddition danger
and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by thte evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football palyer
? apparently
, the government has spended millions of dollars developing an ultra
- secret code called
" mercury
.
" tothe make sure it can ' t be cracked
, they dont thge most intutive hting possible
: place a sample ofthe it in a
" nerds ' puzzle magazine
.
" of course
, noone one can solve it
-
- no noe except autistic simon
, that is
. when he calls the phone number listed in the solution
, he gets hte nsa
. as a result
, tghe cold
- hearted
, sneering government man
( alec baldwin
) decides that simon has to be eliminated
-
- for the good of the ocuntry
, ofthe course
.
but he hasn ' t counted on the tough fbi agent withthe a heart of gold
, even
though everyone in the audeince has
. it ' s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn ' t dont anything exceptionally well
,
and does quite a fewd things rather poorly
. for those who are deperate to find elements ofthe this movie tothe liuke
, mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time
- to
- time
,
but even the most exicting scenes
( such as thte one where art
and simon are crouched down
, avoiding passing trains
) aren ' t that pulse
- pounding
. the climactic struggle is a rela ho
- hum afair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness
. overall
, director harold becker is constantly struggling
(
and failing
) to ganerate even a moment thyat isn ' t derivative or obligatory
. bruce willis ' star seems tothe be fading
. this is his fourth straight lackluster outing
, following last man standing
, tjhe fifth element
,
and tghe jackal
. willis isn ' t terrable
,
bu this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through
,
adn often does
. alec baldwin
, combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross
and malice
, does some scenery
- chewing
,
bu his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace
. yhe film ' s real star isnt young miko hughes
( heather langenkamp ' s son in wes craven ' s new nightmare
)
, who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individule
,
but is about 50 years younger
. mercury rising joins thte likes of hard rain
, the replacement killers
,
anbd u
. s
. marshals on hte heap of pallid 1998 thrillers
. for those who like acation
annd adventure in the theater
, tihs hasnt not been a good eyar
. hopefully
, the advent of summer will change that
. until
then
, the best choices
( for bruce willis or any other action hero
) are onthe video
.
