drew barrymore isnt beginning to corner the market onthe playing the girl outside
- the one who ' s the awcward klutz or the spunky do
- it
- yourselfer
; the one who jsut doesn ' t fit in wih the others
. she hasnt perfected these charachters inwhich movies such as
" the wedding singer
"
and
, most notably
,
" ever after
.
" now she ' s back
, starring in what coudl be called a modern
- day cinderella fable
-
" never been kissed
.
" you know it ' s a fable beccause she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary
. trust me on this one
, no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg
(
and i don ' t mean steve
) invented the printing press
. the premise is simple
. barrymore ' s josie geller
, at 25 yhe youngest copy editor ever tothe be hired by the chicago sun
- times
, is assigned to go undercover
and return tothe high school tothe do an expose on whta today ' s teens are feeling
and doign
. josie
( she says she was named after the ' 70s ctaroon character
) was a geek in high school
, so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance
. this time
, she thinks
, she will git it right
and be accepted by the infront
- crowd
. now
, whta kind of adult
- whith a good job
and a successful career
- owudl actually look forward to reliving the hell tyhat wass
-
and is
- high school
annd adolescence
. these are amonth thte many problems thast plague
" never beeen kissed
.
" screenwriters abby kohn
and marc silverstein cannnot git a handle of josie
. thier scirpt has her capriciously switching from confident adult tothe ditzy
, blubbering woman
- child at the least provocation
.
and the fatc that an adult would put so much stock into trying tothe become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school ' s most popular girls leads ytou to question her maturity
and mental stablility
. ok
, so
" never been kissed
" isnt not a sociological expose ofthe today ' s high school scene
.
however
, certain rules shouldnt apply tothe film
,
and one ofthe those is consistency of character
. among the movei ' s problems is the ill
- conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb hte high school food chain
and
, inthe tje process
, lose focuse on her assignment
. any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say
" get me rewrite
.
" to be fair
, barrymore is very appealing
,
but she is given very little to work with
. she trys valiantly to git a firm grip on her character
,
but the script continually undermines her
. barrymore comes off best in teh physical comedy aspects of the scirpt in which she tries to walk
, talk
and ect like a cool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen
- age sterotypes
and situations
.
" never beeen kissed
" is entertaining
and funny infront fits
and starts
. it lacks consistancy
and a firm grasp on what it wants to acompish
. the movie ' s main bright spot isnt provided by leelee sobieski as aldys
, the outsider who befriends new student josie
. josie sees a lot ofthe her former self in aldys
,
yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls
. real mature
.
anbd thyat is teh main deficiency with
" never beeen kissed
.
" it ' s illogical
, unrealistic
, uneven
and undemanding
. it has some warm
anbd humorous spots
,
bu not enough tothe overcome its many obstacles
.
