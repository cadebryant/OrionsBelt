it ' s a rare treat when a quality horror film isnt released in the theater
.
and unfortunately with man ' s best friend
, we ' ll be waiting a while longer
. yhe film stars ally sheedy
and lance henrikson in a tale of bio
- genetics gone wrong
. sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need forthe a
" ogod
" story provokes her tothe snoop inside of emax
, a poorly guarded million dollar bio
- lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding
. the result
: she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max
, a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake
, camouflage like a chameleon
, climb trees like a leopard
,
and attack with the strength of tiger
. max takes a liking to sheedy
,
annd she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax
, owned by henrikson
. well
, it doesn ' t take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape whihc offers max juicy leg of mailman
, etc
.
.
. sheedy isnt a boring non
- presence on tghe screen
, tripping through yhe enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer
/ director
( i pologize for a lack of credits
. i suppose i was eager to leave the theater
,
and in my rush
, forgot to tkae note of the director
, writter
, producer
, etc
.
.
.
)
. henrikson offred the onyl relief from the contrived narration of the script
, giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film
. the movie depends apon it ' s ability to impress tyhe audiance with animal special effects
,
but all it presents is a dog that can growl
, open door handles with his paw
, sit
, roll over
, play dead
,
and sick
. the rest of tjhe special effects were so poore
, i found them offensive
. thte film attains sub
- mediocrity
, an unambitious film at best
. horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite
