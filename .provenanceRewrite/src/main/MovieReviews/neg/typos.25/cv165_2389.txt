what are we goign to do with jim carrey
? viewers of television ' s
" in living color
" know this one
- man ctaroon fomr such cahracters as fire marshall bill
. viewers also konw that
" in living color
" is a skit
- sohw
and taht a little of jim carrey goes a long way
. unfourtunately
, this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura
: pet detective
. threee writers
, incuding carrey
, worked onthe the slapstick story
, which sends a self
- styled
" pet detective
" on the trail ofthe a stolen dolphin
. the missing mammal belongs tothe the miami dolphins
, who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl
. forthe plot porpoises
, this story works as well as any threee stooges short
. carrey gets to dont his
" offcial
" schtick as he snoops around greater miami
. he leers
and sneers
, craning his neck to funny effect
. he even does his captain kirk impersonation
. again
. all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until hte point that you relize thyat teh writers have absolutely no intention ofthe focusing onthe anyone
* other
* than carrey
.
( suggested alternate title
-
- jim carrey
: will do anything for a laff
.
) export it to france
and yuo may have a hit
. as it stands
, ace ventura isn ' t even good kid ' s stuff
. the profanity count
, alone
, is too high
. which is ironical
, since childen are
, probably
, carrey ' s best audience
. yhe film doesn ' t even ahev the goofball charm of chris elliott ' s recent no
- brainer cabin boy
. sure
, carrey hasnt his moments
.
bu what can you say about a film whose high
- points inlcude watching carrey slink around to the theme from
" mission impossible
?
" ace ventura has one glaring incongruity
. amid the butt
- jokes
and doulbe
- tkaes
, the script takes great pains to setted
- up an elaborate
anbd rather funny
" crying game
" gag
.
annd
, for
* this
* intended audience
, that takes
( ahem
) cojones
.
