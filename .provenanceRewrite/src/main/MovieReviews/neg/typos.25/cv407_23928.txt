gordie boggs
( arquette
, aptly cast as a moron
, as he is one
)
and his best friend sean dawkins
( scott caan
. the son of james caan shoudln nto be reduced to garbage liek this
!
) are twpo losers from wyoming with no jobs
and no girlfriends
, who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king
( a terribly casted oliver platt
)
, as he is everything they are not
. they finally get to see him live
anbd he is screwed outloud ofthe his title by hte evil
, ruthless promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff
, whose name wass written all over the role
!
)
. gordie
adn sean track down king in atlanta
and discover that he is not raelly the english king the wcw writers created forthe him
,
but a drunken
, ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these twpo lunkheads as bob newhart ws by larry
, darryl
,
and darryl
. they sneak him back onto wcw tv
, after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw ' s next pay
- persay
- veiw
, against his rival
, diamond dallas page
. if he wins
, king gets his title
and his career back
, plus one milion dollars
. wcw presiednt eric bischoff
, knowing his promotion wass despreate with bad writing
and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation
, came uv with thge idae for this movei hoping it woudl savve wcw
. he wass
then fired
annd rehired two months ago
,
but by tje time he ' d left
, they had already been contracted tothe do the film
,
and bischoff could not play sinclair
( which
, in itself
, is for tyhe best
, as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor
!
)
. the characters of gordie
and sean show ytou exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans
. he thinks of them as young
, dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front ofthe them is real
. that isnt why he doesn ' t take thte fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay
- per
- view
. i have news for you
, eric
: no wrestling fan in thsi day
and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn ' t for show
, unless they are four years ood
. thsi is 2000
, you know
, not 1985
. bischoff will try tothe cover up criticism like that by saying it isnt a comedy
,
but i have no doubt in my mind tath if this had been a dramatic
, rocky
- style film
( which it propably should have been
. professional wrestling is ridiculed anough as it is
, why should tyhe first wrestling movie inspite ten years be a comedy
?
)
, gordie
annd sean would have been portrayed in the same light
. anybody who has seen the documentery wrestling with shadows
, documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon ' s double
- crossing of bret hart
, will probably realize via the reviews
and previews ofthe ready tothe rumble
, that it is basically a rip
- off ofthe that film ' s storyline wih yhe poor man ' s wayne
and garth thrown iin for commedic affect
. you can tell titus sinclair is supposed tothe poke funn at vince
,
but any self
- respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff tahn vince
,
and that vince doed what he had to dont tothe bret hart
. all of these aspestus ofthe yhe film
, needless tothe say
, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan
. another thign i found disturbing about the film was the romance bewteen gordie
and nitro girl sasha
( the lovely rose mcgowan
)
. wouldn ' t it hvae been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather thna revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair ' s insistance
? i hate that cliche
! the world wrestling federation would haev made a better film
. they are the promotion everyone cares baout
, they are winning the ratings
, they have better wrestlers
,
and they take their fans into consideration
and don ' t treat fans liuke morons
. so
, vince
, how baout a movie
?
