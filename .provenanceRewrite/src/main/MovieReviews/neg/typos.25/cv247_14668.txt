_
. i ' m nto really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance tothe yhe slow
, completly uninvolving bore i saw
-
- at least
, it certainly does not describe what goes onthe for most of the film
. alessandro nivola plays robin fleming
, a troubled
, directionless 21
- yearm
- old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town
. police sergeant phil quinn
( william sadler
) takes him in
,
and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious sories ofthe sneak
- outs
and sneak
- ins where robin slips out of his jail cell
, breaks a window
,
then returns
, all without quinn ever noticeing
. also added to tyhe pointless proceedings isnt some would
- be humorous shenanigans involving quinn ' s dimwitted deputy ernie attempting tothe engage in clandestine patrol car sex whith his girlfriend donna
( karen sillas
)
. with a half hour
( if even that long
) remaining

) finally approach something close tothe a point
. turns outloud robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise

)
, who hasnt long gone on with her life
,
adn hughes ' s main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired
" live in the presnt
and fo the future
" message
. most moviegoers
,
however
, will likely be asleep by that time
. wide awake
,
however
, is tjhe cast
, who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes whith energy
annd skill
-
- thus revealing the
_ real
_ purpose behind this listless enterprise
: to serve as a series ofthe acting exercises
. such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors
,
but it leaves audiences with a booby prize
