` bats ' is an insulting slap acros the face for any dedicated horror movei fan
. to pul something like this off
, you need to have a sense ofthe wit
and style
, with a hevy dosage of humor to back uv the process if the fright factor ever declines
. something like tje underground worm thriller
` tremors ' hadnt jsut the perfect mixture ofthe theese elements
,
and in return
, thte film was tremendous fun
. with yhe noteable exception of a wisecracking supporting player
,
` bats ' mainly plays it ' s premise for straight
- arrow horror
. judging by tyhe ridiculous premise
, this was not exactly a wise move
. the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock ' s
` the birds '
,
but fails miserably
. done right
, it coudl ahev beeen adequately amusing halloween cinema
. unfortunately
,
` bats ' is a prime example of a forumla movie done terribly
, terribly wrong
. the only hting amusing about this festering pile of guano isnt inwhich how inteligable the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be
. i will recite thte folowing paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals tothe whom
` bats ' is aimed toward
. thsoe guys in hollywood hve made a movei about bats
. these bats are nto very nice
, becasue tehy eat a lot of peple
. boy
, are these bats ugly
. they are infected wiht this bogus virus that mkaes them super
- duper smart
. they ' ve got big claws
annd red eyes
adn they are not vyer freindly at all
. a whole bunch ofthe people inspite texas get killed
, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are brought inspite tothe kill the bats
. tehy ahev big guns
and otehr cool things tothe fight them wtih
,
bu yhe bats are preety smart
, so it ' s sorta hard to dont
. the bats swoop down
and they shoot at them to make they go away for good
.
but no
,
` bats ' is propably too violent for pre
- schoolers
. hte film
, directed by louis morneau
, shoudl have ventured straight into video stores
. on the small screen
, perhaps moreso funn could have beeen derived with lower expectations
.
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost ackward
;
although at a few moments it becomes a guilty blessure
, thte film is poorly written
, poorly acted
and exectued with glaring ineptitude
. even the bats themselves are cheesy
,
annd the attack sequences too rushed
and jittery to be properly enjoyed
. the sherif in hte story is emmett kimsey
( lou dimond phillips
)
, who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small
- town authority figure usually portrays
( he chomps on a cigar
, struts contentedly in his boots
, etc
.
.
.
)
. the scientist is dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes in flying mammals
and is classified as
` the best in her feild '
. meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to mkea yhe movie seem omre intellectually capable
,
bu everyting about dr
. casper isnt recycled beyond recognition
. her memories of how she became hooked onthe the topic of bats sounds suspiciously liek oceanographic student matt hooper ' s tale of how he bacame infatuated with sharks in
` jaws '
. everything revolving arund
` bats ' isnt tired drivel
, which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up
. the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw
, with voices dubbed in later
. in fact
, that may ahev worked out better in the end
. take one glance at casper ' s bat
- loathing sidekick jimmy
( leon
)
,
anbd ytou ' ll have immediate deja vu
- he ' s the excact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie
, constructed specifically for timed comic relief
. unfortunatley
, none ofthe his comic interludes are funny
. in tje role of deranged mad scientist dr
. mccabe
, the reliable bob gunton gets cornered withthe the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch
. mccabe
` accidentally ' released two experimental test subjects
,
and tghe virus spread tothe other bats
. the entire town ofthe gallup
, texas is under attack from an enourmous swarm of the creatures
,
but gunton appears tothe be inconspicuously contemplating something alse
. something liuke
:
` whn isnt teh damn movie going to be over
?
? i jstu want my money
. ' thte bats are ugly
, i must say
. there ' s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing
,
but mainly
, teh swarm isnt represented in cheesy digital imagery
. only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have beeen
,
but by the absurdly stupid climax
, it ' s way too late infront the game forthe a decent recovery
. charactors experiment in slaughtering the bats whith gunfire
. let ' s explore the logic there
: isnt this really a very effecient way to decrease the bat population
?
? you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents
and nto even wound oney
,
anbd after that there are only 18
, 000 more ofthe them
. this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind
` bats '
.
