. comments
: allow me to state for the record that i fidn daryl hannah an appealing presence inthe movies
. she proved qtuie charming as the intelligent astronomer inthe the rumatic comedy roxanne
and equally creepy as pris in the sci
- fi classic blade runner
. the clan of the cave bear clearly trys tothe captialize on hannah as a selling point
: hte poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint
and the video box prominantly features her name in lettering the same size as the title
. not even her starring role in this turkey
, unfortunately
, cin save it from being an unbeleivable exerciese in cheese
. it ' s so uniquely bad
( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actualyl tries
,
and miserably fails
, tothe be serious
) that it ' s oddly fascinating
. the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves thge audience somehow transfixed
, wanting to see how this dud plays out
. the clan of the cave bear is based apon a populare novel by jean m
. auel
. to this day
, the book possesses a loyal cult folowing
. i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog
- eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so
- called dirty parts blacked outloud wiht marker by her grandmother
. i have never read htis book
,
but i sure hope it ' s 10
, 000 times better than its film adaptation
. if nto
,
then i ' m at a complete loss tothe explain its popularity
. the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene
. a young ayla
, looking much like drew barrymore in e
. t
.
, tramps about in the woods
. with her cute little ponytails
and fur wrapped about her
, the audeince ' s expectations ofthe a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immidately shattered
. what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in hwihc an earthquake swallows up ayla ' s mother
( a blonde iwth fur pants
.
.
. er
, leggings
)
. tearful ayla looks onthe as the cameraman shakes tje camera
.
.
. well
, as tghe earthquake slowly recedes
. a hungry lion becomes interseted in her for lunch
,
bu the screaming six
- year
- old manages tothe outrun tyhe king ofthe the wild
anbd fidn a safe haven
. i won ' t detail the story any further
; thsi seems enough to illustrate my point
. this movie isnt really stupid
. it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend theri disbelief
. aslo
, the obvious comparsion vetween the appearance of cro
- magnon man in prehistory
and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front ofthe charlton heston
. the movie doesn ' t just suggest this message
; it whacks the message inot thte audience with a twpo
- by
- four
. a blond
, gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch ofthe people in gaudy brown wigs
. she ' s ofthe thge
" newyorker peple
"
; tehy ' re of teh
" old people
" with
" the memories
.
" yep
. we get it
. we get it
. the clan of the cave bear apparently received an caademy award nomination for best make
- up
, which surprises me
. the movie depends upon a lot ofthe make
- up obviously
,
bu much of it isnt unconvincing
. as stated before
, daryl hannah is daryl hannah here
; she looks like she just stepped outloud of the showfer all the timne
. the rest of the characters hvea dark amke
- up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt
. the face
- painting that ' s occasionally seen isnt perhaps the onyl noteable work here in my mind
. this movie also suffers ffrom its new age trappings
. maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985
,
but nowe it sounds dated
anbd cliched
, like poorly conceived elevator music
. add tothe this the film ' s faux
- mysticism
, including spirit animals
anbd dream visions
,
and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you ' d expect to hear on a 1
- 900 number
,
and ytou get a movie thyat hasnt serious problems bieng serious
. the clan of the cave bear is rated r
,
though it ' s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i ' ve seen in quite a while
. it contains severeal scenes of sex sans nudity
. tyhe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes
. the funniest moent of hte movei occurs when a neanderthal in lvoe with ayla attempts to rescure her from a ferocious bear
. the bear bites his head off
and the audience sees it rolling about
.
although this may sound gratuitous
, i ' m sure
, it ' s so cheesy that it probably won ' t bother most people
. the clan ofthe the cave bear is a bad movei
.
however
, as i wrote at hte begining of this review
, it does have the distinction of originality
. typically when i think of bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel films dealing with early man
, fantasy movies involving dinosaurs
( who did nto exist at hte same time as man
)
and raquel welch cmo to mind
. tjhe clan of tghe cave bear tries so hard tothe be sereous thyat
,
though it ' s so bad
, the audience is still interested by the unique setting
adn characters of the movei
( whihc is why i awarded this turkey twpo stars
)
. i have to tihkn that fans of tyhe book owudl be disappointed with this film version
;
however
, i ' m only basing this observation on the fact that tyhe book is alomst inevititably better than tje movei
. i shudder to think that it coudl be otherwise
.
