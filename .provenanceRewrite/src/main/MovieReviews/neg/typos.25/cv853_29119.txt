it ' s a shame the execution ofthe this consept falls very short ofthe its premise
. yhe movie isnt lacking
and most unsatisfying
. osmosis jones is crude
, gross
, disgusting
,
and was directed by teh farrelly brothers
- the twisted siblings behind there ' s something about mary
, me
, myself
and irene
and a couple of other movies infact which teh humor is mostly targeted below the belt
. not that there ' s anytying wrong with scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor
- such as it was
. it ' s merely that with osmosis jones
, the farrellys humer isnt too juvenile
, too predicatble
. you cant almsot foresee the puns jstu by viewing the part of the intertube anatomy a sequence isnt drawn
. osmosis jones looks like oney of those old health clas movies gone pyscho
. the trouble is
, the animation may please the very young
,
but the jokes may be over their heads
, while the teen
- age audiance may find it too tame for their tastes
. adults
? well
, let ' s just say most will find it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays liek a 100
- minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby
. the live action sequences revolve around frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems to be the grungiest human bieng in the universe
. he continually looks as if he needs a shave
and a shower
. frank
, much to the constarnation of his daughter
, is a fast
- food addict
, eating anytying
-
and everything
- that can kill you
. he works at a zoo where tghe animals look cleaner
-
and presumably smell better
- thna he does
. frank ' s body is invaded by thrax
, a lethal virus
, after frank eats a hard
- boiled egg taht had fallen to the ground
. it ' s nto gross enough that frank picks yhe egg uv from the dirt
and plops it into his mouth
. nope
, the farrellys pile it on by first hvaing frank wrestle a chimp for the egg
, wresting it fomr the primate ' s mouth
. like i said
, the gross meter tips the scales onthe this one
. after ingesting the egg
, the movei begins its animated sequences
. here
, osmosis jones
( voiced by chris rock
)
, a renegade white blood cell isnt teamed with drix
( voiced by frasier ' s david hyde pierce
)
, a 12
- hour
, painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax
( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne
)
. basically
, what we ahve is a cliched cop
- buddy movei
, rife with all the clich
? s of that genre
.
and this is why osmosis jones doesn ' t click
. it merely falls back onthe tired
, familliar conventions instead of creating newyorker
and exciting situations
. thte jokes
anbd puns are lame
: osmosis searches out a snitch
, a fromer flu virus
. after pumping him for information
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn ' t look fluish
.
"
and the jokes don ' t rise above that level
. the live action scenes are noone better
. frank is such a slob
, so unappealing that it is difficult tothe fathom how he ever married or even sired a child
. he ' s almost a bigger cartoon tahn the animated characters
. osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns
and dissolves blood cells right
and left
. tjhe animation is rather two
- dimensional
and flat
. it lacks scope
and depth
. it is an unappealing movie that wiull leave you scratching your head
,
and maybe leaning towrad a shower after ytou walk out ofthe the theater
.
