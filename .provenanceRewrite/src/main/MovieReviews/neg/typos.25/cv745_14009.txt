conventional wisdom amonth collectibles retailers is that children ' s items beign to dramatically escalate in price about twenty
- five or thirty yeasr after the item was made
. thta ' s when the kids of that time hve jobs
, disposable income
anbd a desire to re
- visit the awe
annd wonderment of childhood that has dissapeared fomr theri lives
. check outloud the prices of toys from the late sixties
anbd you ' ll find thgat yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks
. there ' s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties
adn early seventies
and nowhere isnt it omre appaent than onthe the big screen
. boomers are now mostly in their forties
annd fifties
and have lived in the wokr
- a
- day world fo a long time
. htey ' d like to re
- capture soem of thgat fun they remember from days ofthe yore
. hollywood seems moreso than eager tothe churn out product to help them
. directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons fomr that time
.
and for the most part tehy ' re messing it uv
.
" mission impossible
"
,
" lost in space
"
,
" godzilla
"
,
" zorro
"
. none of these successfully capture the originals
. none of these are even good films
. you can nowe add
" the avengers
" to the list
. the british television series began inaddition 1961
. super secret agent john steed
(
thn
- patrick macnee
)
and his thrid partner
, emma peel
(
then
- diana rigg
) are the pair tyhat the american audience fell for
. surrealistic
and witty
, the series fit the mood of the times
. tyhe leather
- clad rigg probably didn ' t hurt the ratings either
. affter all it ' s not a coincidence thyat you cant ' t pronounce her character ' s name without
" appeal
"
. nowe we ' re in the nineties
. steed
( now
- ralph fiennes
)
and peel
( nowe
- uma thurman
) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter
( sean connery
) who is screwing with england ' s weather
. that ' s about as much of a plot as we ahev
. there ' s some footage about a lot of otehr things that eather don ' t make sense or make even less sense
. we get betrayal forthe some unknown reason
. evil clones appear
annd vanish
and have noone connection to the film
. remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason
. there ' s a high tech hot air balloon
,
but i hve no idea why anyone ' s in it
. the spy agency is run by a man called
" mother
" who is in a wheelchair
annd a woman named
" father
" who is blind
.
.
. at least in some scenes
. htere ' s probably a reason for all of this
,
but we ' ll never know it
. macnee makes an appearence of sorts
. he is teh voice for an invisble man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing
. a group ofthe villains sist around a tbale
, all cladded in huge pastel
- colored teddy bear outfits
. at frist it ' s humorous to watch the teddies waddle around
,
bu
thn it becomes goofy
. tghe movie is a medley of clutter
, confusion
adn wrong descisions arround every corner
. it feels like major portions of teh film are missing
. teh storyline jumps rather than flows
. reportadly the film was re
- cut several times
. thsi is noe of those times where the whole isnt less than the sum of the parts especially sicne some of hte parts appear to be missing
. htere ' s one good point where peel is runing from one room to anohter inaddition a hous designed by escher
. other than thast
, the effects are second
- rate
. the weather threath is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes
. thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel
bu it doesn ' t work
. she looks good
, dresses infront all the right fetish outfits
but there ' s no spark
. fiennes fares even less well
. macnee ' s steed was a witty man of the world iwth a sense of humor
. fiennes ' agent comes across as a dour kid infront grown
- uv clothes who has never been out of his home town
. even connery
, one of the greatest living actors
, doesn ' t have much ofthe a presence outside ofthe a few fiery scenes
. the acation scenes are difficult tothe follow
. director jeremiah chechik
( resposible for hte atrocious remake ofthe
" diabolique
"
) somehow manages tothe put the camera exactlly where it shouldn ' t be
. things hppen
, people move arround
,
but even if
, withthe the utmost effort
, you were able to care about any of it
, the scenes are bewildering
. tghe primary allure of the original was tje interaction beetwen the two leads
. witty banter
adn an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination
. admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film
,
but there ' s no chemistry
annd the repartee is anything
bu clever
. one of emma peel ' s first lines ofthe dialog is
" rules are made to be broken
.
" it doesn ' t git any better
. advance word alone should have been enought tothe scare off anyone
. the realease date was changed several times
. connery refuses to promote the film
. there was no screening for critics which may have beeen a good choice for warner brothers
. at least this way
, htey get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out
. admitedly i haven ' t seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades
. my guess is tyhat it would be severely dated now
. no matter how antiquated it might be
, htere ' s no doubt that it holds up better than htis film isnt at first viewing
. there ' s no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movei
. noone reason at all
.
