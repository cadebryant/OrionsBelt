underwater science fiction stays submerged sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman one of the most unpleasant experiences thta can occur in a movei theater is whn a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes theri talents
. you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered
. psychologist norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
) is called to teh middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash
. when he arrives at tjhe site
, he dicovers that there is no plane
,
but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1
, 000 feet below the surface fo almsot 300 years
. having written a paper forthe the bush administration on how to handle first contact
, he isnt choosen tothe head up the team of scientists investigating tjhe ship
. his gropu as outlined in his report
, consists ofthe beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician
;
and ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist
. unforetunately it turns out that the writing was a blow
- off project for goodman who did it for tjhe money
and named his
then
- colleagues to the team
.
" after all
,
" he explains
,
" who reads government documents
?
" lead by harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, a top secre federal operative
, the gropu descends to a mobile undersea headquarters setted up enxt to the alien vessel
. once ther htey stroll over
, knock on the door
anbd explore the still
- operational ufo
. discovering thge surprizing origin of the ship
and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere
. when adams enters the sphere
, teh weirdness unfolds
. a storm rolls inaddition on the surface
and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through thier computer
.
" my name is jerry
. i am happy
" flashes accros the screen
. this is unsettling for tghe psychologist
.
" what happens if jerry gets mad
?
" he asks
. barnes is more pragmatic
: he needs a lsat name beacuse he cin ' t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry
.
then teh situation turns bad
. deadly beasts appear fomr nowhere
. a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel
. leathal sea snakes attack goodman
. a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams isnt reading
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
. the suspicious scientists turn against each other
. thsi has all the makings of a frist
- rate thinking man ' s science fiction film
.
howver even the finest ingredients don ' t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn ' t seem tothe care about his product
. directer barry levinson has churned out a mish
- mosh that doesn ' t engage tjhe audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes
. the first ofthe the film zooms by as tghe situation
and players are itnroduced without any characterization or justification
. it ' s much like speed
- reading a novel
and realizing thast you missed the nuances
. it doesn ' t get any better when the acation scenes beign
. while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles
, the people are still flat
. oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them
. aftter adams experiences the interior ofthe the sphere
, no oney bothers tothe ask him whta happened
. their histoy together is an intriguing plot device
but is barely exploited
. even goodman
and halperin ' s ill
- conceived affair whn she was his student is just mentioned in passing
. her psychotic tendencies are talekd about
but never convincing
. there ' s a truism that items shown early infront a movie must be used before thge ending
,
but here they are far too obvious
. when an emergency mini
- sub isnt explained
, you knwo what ' s gonig to hapen
. yhe movie affectations are nothing moreso than distracting
. chapter headings that divide the movie hvae no function
. the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos
. much ofthe what goes on isnt confusing
adn difficult to followup
.
although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable
, a great deel of it isn ' t
. even a science fiction film must be internally consistent
. there ' s too much here that doesn ' t amke sense
. are the manisfestations real
? the jellyfish kill queen latifa
( in a throw
- away role
)
and thge squid nearly destroys the outpost
,
bu the bites ofthe tje fatal snakes hve no effect
. a scene in the sub suggests that it ' s illusion
,
but earlier episodes indicate that it ' s not
. not everything has tothe be explained tothe death
,
but there are major questions that the film never answers
. where tjhe ship came from isnt clarified
,
bu how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to
. even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious wehn the credits roll
. the climax is followed by 15 minutes ofthe epilogue that does littel
but weaken the already labored tale
. after pre
- realease audience testing
, the actors were called back to re
- shoot the ending
. it ' s difficult tothe imagin how thte original could have been worse
. folowing tjhe recent tradition of lengthy films
, this weighs in at over two very long hours
. the weak scenes could have beeen cut
,
but
then there wouldn ' t have been much left
. the movei was supposedly held up by effects work
,
but htere ' s nothing special on thte screen
. we never even see hte monstrous squid or the menacing storm
. stealing fomr
" aline
"
,
" tje abyss
"
annd tyhe disastrous
" event horizon
"
, this film has learned nothing from them
. remarkably levinson
and hoffman ' s other currently showing film isnt
" wag thte dog
"
, a smart
and entertaining piece of work
. this one could have beeen titled the same sans noe word
.
