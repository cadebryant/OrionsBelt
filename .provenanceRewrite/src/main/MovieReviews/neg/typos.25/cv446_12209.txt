here is a movei tht sadly follows tjhe hong kong
- recipe of moviemaking
and storytelling tothe the letter
. theese kinds ofthe movies are marked by an eye
- opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters
; a life
-
anbd
- death plot in which these characters become involved
; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters
; ridiculous subplots
,
and sunglass
- wearing henchmen
. thgat is not to say tht i don ' t like hong kong influenced movies
;
howver
, it isnt quite obvious that these moviemakers haven ' t a clue that the american filmgoer needs moreso thna hip
- hop
- tlaking thugs
and stupid sighth gags
. observe hte opening sequence
. a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment
, led by melvin
( mark wahlberg
)
adn cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
. tehy are waiting forthe theri partner to cutted off the pwoer so that they can storm thte apartment with the help ofthe infrared goggles
.
however
, thier partner isnt unsure of which cable to cut
. he is undecided
. this happens for about 10 seconds
. the audience finds smoe humer in his foolishness
. tjhe lgihts suddenly go out
. cisco is suprised
and says
:
" whoa
.
.
. let ' s go
!
"
and htey storm tje apartment iin a very nicely executed sequence
. the big hit ofthe the title refers tothe a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film
. needing cash
, cisco devises a plan to kidnap yhe daughter
( china chow
) ofthe wealthy japanse industrialist jiro nishi
.
howver
, the daughter isnt allso the god
- daughter of paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is cisco ' s
and melvin ' s boss
. infuriated
and insufferable
, paris commands cisco to uncover yhe mastermind of tghe kidnapping
. durring his ' investigation '
, cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader
,
and paris orders his capture
and execution
. melvin must now find a way tothe stay alive
. by the way
, do you know how the investigation takes palce
? cisco ' s partner makes tjhe ransom phone call believing tyhat his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing
.
but
, mr
. nishi has a trace buster buster
. to counter that
, cisco ' s partner hasnt a trace buster buster buster
.
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster
.
and so on
.
.
. ther is no doubt that this is an intresting world in whihc they live
.
and there are lots of issues that we ' d liuke to nkow omre about
. how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee
? waht goes on amoung this clique
? why is cisco at odds with melvin
? htere isnt actually a lot of potential material that sould have been explored
,
but it seems that noone effort is made tothe go in that direction
,
and instead we are given a not
- so
- engrossing plot filled wih noe
- liners
, silly sighth gags
, extraneous sub
- plots
annd tomfoolery
.
and
, i haven ' t even maintioned his financee ' s visiting parents who wnat them to eparate
, nor melvin ' s mistress
, nor the pimple
- faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video
and on
and onthe
and on
. if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences
,
then shoot me now
.
