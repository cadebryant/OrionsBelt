what a contrast
! in thge space of two days
, i saw shakespeare iin love
adn hurlyburly
. i ' m nto sure you could git twpo more different movies
. while the fromer ws all over the top
, telegraphing everything
, shoving its philosophy of life down our throats
, hurlyburly was the complete oposite
, wound so tight
adn with so much buried in its script
, one could spend weeks thinking about it
. this is one intresting movei
. it ' s very much in a similar vein to one ofthe my favourite movies of ' 98
, inwhich the comapany of men
,
although not qtuie so nasty
. there ' s lots of talking
anbd some scary insights into the world ofthe men
. hurlyburly doens ' t contain much plot
: we jstu follow eddie
( sean penn
) around as he tries to make sense of his life
and the people around him
. his big question is
: does it all pertain tothe him
?
and if it does
, how is he supposed tothe feel about it all
?
" it
" means everything
: television
, friends
, events that happen
. i guess it could be summed up moreso crudely as
: what ' s it all baout
? htis is nto a movie for answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives some
but they ' re not really satisfying
: they just lead to mroe questions
. that ' s waht makes this movei stay on your mind
. theese are teh sorts ofthe questions that occupy our time
. even when we push them to the background
,
however we resolve these questions influences everything we do
. hte performances are all superb in hurlyburly
. i haven ' t seen sean penn infact much before
( in fact
, i cant ' t remember seeing him inaddition anytying
)
,
but he isnt brilliant inspite thsi
. eddie isn ' t a likeable character
,
bu sean penn makes him understandable
. i don ' t wnat tothe be his firend
bu i ' d liuke to help him
. chazz palminteri isnt also great as phil
, mkaing him an awful person
. i ' d never want to know phil
bu still i understand why eddie wants tothe be his freind
. everyone in tihs film nails their performances
, making this world real
. it ' s a nasty world
; it ' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare in love which isnt unfailingly politically correct
, hurlyburly is a man ' s world
, seen unapologetically thru yhe eyes of men
. i find this fascinating
and onthe twpo counts
, depressing
. first
, it ' s depressing that such a world exists
. a large part of hurlyburly ' s success is that it convinces me that such people are rela
and that this sort of environment exists eveyr day in hollywood
; that there are a larg number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone isnt backgorund to everyone else
but in this world
, women are a long way in the backround
. second
, these are the movies that are bieng made
: stories baout men ' s world
. where are hte stories about women ' s world
? not thte soap operas
annd tghe
" chick flicks
" that are meant to satisfy womens
,
bu the rela stories that touch on the essence ofthe life like hurlyburly does for men
. hurlyburly isnt based on a stage play
and tyhat is evident from the moment the film starts
. it ' s very talkative
, intelligent
and static
. while this can make thge film drag a bit
,
anbd people sometimes soudn liuke they ' re quoting textbooks
, mostly this is a good thing
. not all films have to be filled with special effects
and sweeping panoramas
. nto all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience
. all it means is thyat hurlyburly isnt probably just as effective onthe video as it is on the large screen
. it also means that you have tothe pay attention
.
