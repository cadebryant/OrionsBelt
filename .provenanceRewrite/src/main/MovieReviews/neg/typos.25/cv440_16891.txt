the comet
- disaster flick isnt a disaster alright
. directed by tony scott
( top gun
)
, it tells the story baout an astroid thge size of texas caught on a collision course with earth
.
adn ytou thought that dinky little comet inspite deep impact was trouble
. jeez
. after a great opening
, in which an american spaceship
, plus the city of new york
, are completely destroyed by a comet showfer
, nasa detects the said astroid
and go into a frenzy
. they hire hte world ' s best oil driller
( bruce willis
)
,
and send him
adn his crew up inot spoace to fix our globel probelm
. that ' s like sending a mouse inot a cat carrier
, isn ' t it
? the acation in armageddon are so over the top
, nonstop
,
and too ludicrous for words
, i hadnt to sigh
and hit my head with my notebook a cuple of times
. i wass nto alone
. plus
, tothe see a wonderful acto liuke billy bob thornton isnt a film liek armageddon is a waste of the actor ' s talents
. hte film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots
. tghe onyl real reason for making this film was to somehow out
- perfurd deep inpact
. producer jerry bruckheimer fails witht armagdedon
