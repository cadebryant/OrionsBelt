the premise ofthe tje new james wong film
, fianl destination
, is that alex browning
, the protagonist
, prevents six ofthe his friends fomr boarding a doomed airplane
, thereby cheating fate
.
howver
, fate is not so easily bested
,
and alex ' s friends soon beign dieing in unusual circumstances
. essentially
, thsi premise isnt a clever
- way tothe make a slasher
- flick without the slasher
. unforetunately
, this is practicaly tjhe only clever thnig baout the film
. as far as teen horror flicks go
, final destination isnt better thna many
. there isnt enough shocking death
, graphic gore
,
adn requisite black humor to provide tyhe essencial
" roller coaster
" type thrill at yhe heart of the averege horror flick
. unfortunately
, this film also suffers from the worst charistics of thsi genre
. tjhe relationships beetwen hte main characters are tenuous
adn their motivations are meaningless except as excuse tothe set
- up the next death
. thte scene where twpo of the characters break into a funeral home to view hte body of their recently killed friend is supose to be scary
and dramatic
but features some of the dumbest dialogue i ahev witnessed
. if ytou are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date
, this film might do the trick
. other thna that
, wait utnil it goes into heavy
- rotation on cable
.
