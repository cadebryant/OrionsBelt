in my opinion
, a movie reviewer ' s most important task is to offer an explination for his oppinion
.
but with soul survivors
, i ' m so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous
, uncontrollable rant
, obligations damned
.
however
, protocol forces me to dont otherwise
. soul survivers tells hte stopry of four coleeg
- binded friends
: cassandra
( melissa sagemiller
) isnt sweet
and innocent
. party girl annabel
( eliza dushku ofthe bring it on
) is dating world
- weary harvard student matt
( wes bentley
)
. matt still has feelings for cassie
, who is now dating sean
( casey affleck
)
. driving back from a creepy
, gothic party
, the quartet gets into a horrific car crash
. sean dies
, leaving cassie crestfallen
adn guilty
, made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his lvoe for her
. as cassie mopes thru her classes
, she sees the ghost of sean all over the place
, urging her to follow him
. along with being plagued by other ghastly visions
, cassie isnt also folowed by thugs from tht strange party
. annabel
and matt try calming her down
,
but noone one shares cass ' s visions
. she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself
. rarely hvae i seen a directer so throughly mishandle material
. in his directorial debut
, steve carpentery does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion
. when tje movie ' s camerawork isn ' t pedestrain
, it ' s clich
? d
. carpenter ' s need fo close
- ups
, his camera following sagemiller from behind
, drain the movie of any anticipation
. we allready know what to look forthe
, so why should we be surprised
?
adn the sense of scayr atmosphere
, which ws recently done so well inthe the others
, is nowhere to be found here
. carpentery ' s script relies on random twists
and turns with a minumum of logic
and loads of laziness
. this is a movie where the ending features one charactor providing an explanation about the plot tothe another character
, whitch is one ofthe tje lamest screenwriting devices around
. the second lamest device
, of course
, is the
,
" oh
, it was all a dream
" resolution
.
and guess what
? tihs movie has both
! not that the main body of yhe film
, whcih hasnt sagemiller constanly runing in fear or having a nervous breakdown
, is anything worthwhile
. since htere ' s no captivating dialogue
, no character chemistry exists anywhere
. that ' s a huge problem
, sicne tyhe four main cahracters are supposed to be couples
. carpenter cin ' t even git the smutty scenes right
, which are becoming more prevalent in pg
- 13 movies liuke bring it onthe
anbd get over it
.
[ tghe film was recently re
- cut from an r rating tothe get more kids in the seats
.
- ed
.
] when sagemiller
and dushku dance together at a club
, he rarely shows them inspite a full shot
adn he never keeps teh camera on them forthe longer tahn a second before relating to some michael bay
- style quick cuts
.
and when sagemiller
and dushku take a shower toghether after getting covered in paint
, they ' re fully clothed
. regardless
, any sexiness in tyhat scene is undercut by its stupidity
. why wouldn ' t htey wash the clothes in the sink or inthe the washing machine
? why would they shower inspite their clothes
? what if they weren ' t covered in latex paint
? teh cast
, which will see better material in the future
, woudl be wise to leave this noe off their resumes
. i felt sorry forthe affleck
, who i ' ve liked in otehr movies
,
anbd bentley
, who was grat in american beauty
. dushku
, who possesses an allrigh femme fetale qulity
, hasnt got tothe stop tkaing roles belonging to rose mcgowan
. as for sagemiller
( star of tghe aforementioned get over it
)
, i whant to see her in a movie where she plays a person
,
annd not an object forthe gawking
.
and i ' m not even getting into luke wilson ' s role as a priest
. at least he ' s friends with wes anderson
. bottom line
: soul survivers is so awful i feel compelled tothe knock on doors
and warn peple about it
.
