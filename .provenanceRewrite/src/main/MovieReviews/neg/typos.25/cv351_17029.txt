htere ' s a scene early onthe inaddition
" jawbreaker
" where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line
,
" that is
* so
* not funny
"
. how right she was
. this pathetic tale of threee high
- schoolers who accidentaily kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny
. or fun
. or orignal
. not content wiht the too
- obvious
" heathers
" heisting
, the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources
, including
" carrie
"
,
" bride ofthe frankenstein
"
,
" blue velvet
"
,
and even shaw ' s pygmalion
, itself recently remade as
" she ' s all tht
"
.
" jawbreaker
" is a pastiche
,
and not even an enjoyable oen
. i find it extremly telling taht the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence
, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt ' s
" volcano girls
"
; serving as a blueprint fo the rest of the film
, the song has absolutely nothing tothe dont with the footage we ' re watching
. just close your eyes
and pretend you ' re listening to an alt
- rock staion
; you won ' t be missing anytying
. the blame for a mess this big has to be spreaded aroud among the principals
. rebecca gayheart
, following roles in
" scream 2
"
and
" urban legend
"
, should have known better than to take
yet anyother role in
yet another teen body count movei
. pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might ahev gotten from her role inspite quentin tarantino ' s
" jackie brown
"
.
and rose mcgowan should jstu quit acting
. she has no charizma
, no presence
,
and no acting skills otehr than rolling her eyes
adn looking disaffected
. mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real
- life boyfriend
, rocker marilyn manson
, whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anytying any ofthe the
" real
" actors are doing
. manson
, sans trademark makeup
& contact lenses
,
and with an obviously fake moustache
, looks eerily like nicholas cage
; who woulda thunk it
? that crack about direction by committee wasn ' t mearly a pithy soudn
- bite
. stylistically
, thematically
& narratively
,
" jawbreaker
" is all over the map
, varying wildly in tone
& content from scene to scene
.
though credited solely to writer
/ director darren stein
, one gets yhe feeling that noone two scenes here weere actually guided by the same hands
. if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity
, someone needs tothe get the man smoe drugs
, pronto
. prozac
, lithium
, kava
, ritalin
, something
, anytying
. he ' s qutie obviously inwhich desperate need of chemical help
.
" jawbreaker
" is a monumental waste of efford
and resources
,
and quite likely oen of the single worst films i ' ve ever seen
. to call
" jawbreaker
" garbage would be tothe insult garbage
. bad flicks for hte rest of yhe year are safe
; i ' ve already got my pik for worst film of ' 99
.
" jawbreaker
" runs approximately 90 minutes
,
though it feels longer tahn
" titanic
"
,
and isnt rated r for language
, sexual situations
and graphic voilence
. not reccomended fo kids
, teens
, or anyone else
.
