that ' s exactly how long the movie falt to me
. there weren ' t even nine laughs in nine months
. it ' s a terrable mess of a movei starring a terrable mess ofthe a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it ' s not thte whole oral
- sex
/ prostitution thign
( referring to grant
, nto me
) that bugs me
, it ' s the fact that grant isnt annoying
. not just adam sandler
- annoying
, we ' re talking jim carrey
- annoying
. usance when dont eye flutters
anbd nervous smiles pass for acting
?
but
, on the other hand
, since wehn do relaly bad slapstick
( a fistfight inwhich yhe delivery room culminating inwhich grant ' s head iin joan cusack ' s lap
-
- a scene he paid
$ 60 to hvae included infront the movie
)
and obscene double entendres
( robin williams
, the obstetrician
, tells grant ' s pregnant girlfriend she has
" a big pussy
,
" referring of course tothe the size of the cat hairs on her coat
,
but nonetheless
, grant paid
$ 60 tothe have the exchange included in the movie
) pass fo comedy
? nine months is a predictable cookie
- cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot
. hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so the scriptwriters coudl inject the following unfunny exchange
: kid
: my dad ' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
,
then responds in his annoying english accent
and i
- think
- i
- atually
- have
- talent attitude
)
: could you possibly elaborate on tath
? kid
: my dad ' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. omre like a hugh asshole
,
bu tht ' s beside the point
, whlch is
: nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that git laughs ffrom thte ten year olds in the audiance while everyone alse shakes his or her head infront disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant
and does his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. this paves the way for eveyr possible pregnancy
/ child birth gag infact tyhe book
, especially since grant ' s equally annoying friend ' s wife is also pregnant
. the annoying friend isnt played by tom arnold
, who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick
, none of which is funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed
" arnie the dinosaur
"
( you draw your own parellels on that one
) in a toy stroe
. the only interesting character in the movie isnt played by jeff goldblum
, who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway
, as an artist with a fear of
(
annd simultanous longing for
) commitment
. not even robin williams
, who plays a russion doctor who has recently decided tothe switch fomr veterinary medacine to obstetrics
, has much humer
. his is a one
- joke character
-
- the old freign
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( did someone sday yakov smirnov
? that ' s my favorite vodka
, by the way
)
, hence the line
" now it ' s timne to take a look at your volvo
,
" anyother nasty
but unamusing joke
, except this one goes right over the ten year olds ' heads
, while the adults simultaneously groan
. nine monthes is a complet failure
, low onthe laughs
and intelligence
and high on loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes
and other uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant ' s sunset boulevard arrest
( please
, noone caught
- with
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring more people into the theaters
,
but they certainly won ' t leave with a smile onthe their faces
, nto after 90 minutes of grant ' s nervous smiles
. everything iin tghe movie isnt so forced
, so unauthentic tath anyone with an i
. q
. over 80
( sorry
, hugh
) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire
.
but at least they didn ' t spend 60 bucks for it
.
