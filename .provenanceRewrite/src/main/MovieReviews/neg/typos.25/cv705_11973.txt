i thiunk ofthe i know what you did last summer as the movei that scream
and scream 2 coudl have been
. mind you
,
though
, i mean this in the worst possible way
. i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without hte smarts of the scream ' s
. as a result
, it ' s even worse than soem of your better campy horror pictures
( see nightmare on elm street
) because it thinks it ' s about thirty times smarter than it is
. based on a teen book of the smae nmae
and
, disappointingly
, adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson
, i know what you did lsat summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff allong tyhe ocean
and an angsty sort sitting at tghe top
. the appropraite mood being set
( tihs is angst
- horror forthe the 90 ' s
)
, we cutted over to thge july 4th parade inaddition a small north carolina town
. from there
, we see tjhe blond
, female protagonist
, helen shivers
( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller
)
, getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male
" hero
,
" barry cox
( woodenly played by ryan phillipe
)
,
and matched brunette pair of protagonists
, julie james
and ray bronson
( woodenly played by party of five ' s jennifer love hewitt
and freddie prinze jr
.
, repsectively
) cheer her on
. after getting drunk at a party
, going tothe a beach to wittily discuss urban legend
annd indulgue in some foreshadowing
,
and having some meaningfull sex
( if you believe waht the characters say
)
, hte four run down smoe guy crossing the windy cliff road at night
. his face is mangled so they can ' t tell who it is
,
annd they come tothe the decision to dump him in tyhe ocean so as tothe nto ruin any of their future chances for success in thte world
. cut to one year later
. the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad
. main brunette female
, the bright oney of the bunch
, has beeen plagued with guilt
and almsot failed out of college
. blond female hasnt forfeited her dreasm ofthe starring on guiding light
,
and now works at the familiy store in town
. brunette male isnt a fisherman
, living off thge land
. blond male hasnt become a complete jerk
and quaterback onthe some college football team
.
hten
, predictably
, their past comes back to haunt them
. it all beigns wiht an irrational murder
, folowed by soem taunting of protaganists by the misteryous killer
, bad acting by a good actress
( anne heche
)
, an improbable plot
, bad acting by the main bad actors
, some more killing
, concluding in a climactic scene
, mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie
. all the while
, the actors
annd actresses spout off bad lines
,
and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation
. not that the movie was without blessure
. count the illogical plot twists
and bad lines for soem fun
. mostly
,
though
, note the costumes of main females
annd how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye
- catching pair look
.
