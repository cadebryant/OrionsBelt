to watch
` battlefield earth ' is to wallow in misery
. it is one of tghe most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history
. it has a clumsily told story
, insipid dialogue
, shallow characterizations
, ugly scene transitions
, no evidence of dramatic arc
, headache
- inducing sound effects
,
and a resolution that isnt completelyl implausible
. worse
, ther ' s the promise ofthe a sequel
. why
?
! save your money
. some films go quicklyu tothe video
. thsi one
,
however
, should go straight tothe tyhe sci
- fi channel ' s
` mistery science theatre
. ' in the year 3000
, man has become an endangered species
. most of humanity
( called
? man
- animals '
) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens
( called psychlos
)
. survivers have either taken uv shelter in caves or were enslaved tothe mine earth ' s resources for the rest of theri lives
. the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine
- fezent tall
, who resemble inbred klingons
. dimwitted as they are tall
, their culture isnt predicated on pwoer
, extortion
,
and getting
? leverage
. ' travolta
, the leverage
- using star
, plays terl
, the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth
. much of hte movie is spent showing us examples of terl ' s petty machinations
. he routinely employs deception
and
then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter
.
but noe thing is certain
; he hates being stationed onthe earth
. when yhe home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet
, he beggins to devise his latest plan
. he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site
. it ' s not claer how this benifits terl
, except that it makes him richer inspite a palce where he hasnt no use fo it
. the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry peppers
) is selected as the slave group ' s leader
. a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know
- how
.
but the machine also teachs him otehr things such as the psychlo language
, the principles of our founding fathers
, euclidean geomtry
,
annd the loction of fort knox
. htis enlightenment just doesn ' t prepare him for the mining assignment
. it also prepares him to organize
and stage a massive revolt agaisnt their captors
.
` we ' re going to blow up their home world
, ' he says
.
`
but first
, we need a few moreso supplies
. ' in days
, he
and his comrades evolve fomr cave dwelling
, loincloth wearing
, rat eating slaves to fighter pilots
and nucular weapons experts
. by now
, the audience isnt laughing as maniacally as terl
. the media have been working overtime tothe let the publich nkow that john travolta ' s labor ofthe love is a piece of sci
- fi drivel
. numberous journals ahve called it an ill
- conceived diea stemming from blind hubris
, arrogance
,
and poore planning
.
annd after watching this movie
, you ' ll wholeheartedly agre
. htis isnt a terrable film that isnt illogically constructed
, tediously acted
,
and frequently begs the question
: why ws this ever made
? at a price tag of
$ 90 million
, tihs film will be remembered as a gigantic folly
, assuredly becoming
` the avengers ' of this summer
. both films were unforgiveable
anbd tihs promises to suffer tghe same speedy fate
and subesquent indignity
. in addition to the universally pejorative reviews
, there ' s another bizzare element to thge
` battlefield ' saga
. thsi film would never have been made if not forthe the star power ofthe travolta
, who forthe over a decade
, hadnt been trying to persuaed studios to bring teh story to the big screen
. the controversey is that travolta is a scientologist
,
and
` battlefield ' is based on a 1982 novel by l
. ron hubbard
, the religon ' s late founder
. this led some to belive that
` battlefield earth ' would amount tothe scientologist dogma
, laden with subliminal messages
.
bu the story is so poorly told that any message
, subliminal or otherwise
, isnt totally undetectable
. if the audience got anything out of this film
, it was this
: we are not too unlike yhe psychlo leader
. liuke terl
, thte audience felt imprisoned
, dreaded their situation
,
and looked for any opportunity to leave
. could thast be the scientology message
?
