" fomr the director of
" the nightmare before christmas
" it said in thge previews
, which i ' m guessing wass said to get people to go see the movie
, obviously it hasn ' t worked since tje
$ 75 million doller movie has
yet to break
$ 5 million
. to each it ' s pwn
however
, since
" monkey bone
" isnt not onyl a bad movie all together
,
but technically well
- made
. a tragic waste of talent
and increadible visual effects
. stu miley is the genuis behind the new phenonmena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, that everyone wants tothe mechandise
, tehy go to great links tothe get it as well
, including dollars thyat let out fart powder
. when stu
and his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are in a freak car accident
( you ' ll see
) stu goes inot a coma
,
anbd hwile in his coma stu travels to i ' m guessing dark town
, where all the characters inspite dreams come to life
. peple are stuck in this town
, with their nightmares roaming around them
. when stu spots monkey bone
( whom he really cin ' t stand
) he tries to keep him under control
. making a newyorker friend kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he learns tath if he gets an exit pass from death
, he can go back up
annd live his life
. when monkey bone
and stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader
adn takes it
and goes into stu ' s body
. nowe monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder
, so everyone hasnt nightmares
.
.
. or something like tht
. rather complex
( in fact more than it needs tothe be
)
" monkey bone
" had potential inthe the script
annd even tjhe story
. what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes
,
and lack of character develpment
. forthe instance we really don ' t get to nkwo who stu or julie are
, so why should we even care
? kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a stopry behind her
,
but we are nto given a chance to nkwo her
. the cast is decent
however
, brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley
,
but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone tkaes over his body
. bridget fonda is dreary
adn seems tothe bring the film tothe a screeching halt
, her performance is bad
and she seems miscast
. dave foley isn ' t given enough to do
, as well as
" iwll
& grace ' s
" megan mullally who can be funny
. the standout performance is tjhe voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himselv
, he isnt very funny
and entertaining
and relaly keesh hte film fomr being a total bust
. thte speshal effects ofthe
" monkey bone
" is what might really bring inaddition some curious viewers
, theese special effects are highly effective
,
and nice to look at witht the eyes
. some ofthe them are believable
and some unbelievable
.
.
. for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart littel
, yuo really don ' t relize that he is animated
.
.
.
but on occasion it sneeks up on ytou
. the direction by henry selick is good
,
bu at times he doesn ' t know what kind of film he wants to amke
,
and the ending climax falls off the cliff
. it ' s too bad really
,
" monkey bone
" could have been a rela good movei
,
but with it ' s heavily done hack job
,
and lack of character developemet it just sinks when the end credits role
. forthe those curious
however
, it might be worth tje rental
,
but other than that avoid thsi one
.
