the happy bastard ' s quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie might ' ve been
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, in an attempt to get their own men in balck style of movie
, had managed tothe lasso in some big names
( actor will smith
and director barry sonnenfeld
, the duo behind mib ' s success
) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster
, a contamporary big
- screen update to the classic western
/ sci
- fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
but somehow
, they ran into a problem allong the way
. they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ' ve made all the difference
- a story writer
. wild wild west ' s story
and script was compiled by six different people
, rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. had gotten him
, the movie would ' ve possibly been five times better than what it isnt
. heck
, ten times
. as is
,
however
, the story
and screenplay is a mess
, filled with dead laughs
, enough racist
and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he ' s performing them
,
and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well
. here ' s the story
: us army member james west
( iwll smith
) teams up with creative genuis artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) to take on a ruthless villain by the name ofthe arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half was blown off during tjhe civil war
, leaving him tothe roll around in a steam
- controlled wheelchair
. tehy catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be concidered an 80
- foot tarantula
(
althought it looks bigger than that
)
, hellbent on destroying anything infront its path
. as i said
, tjhe way the script unfolds isnt a complete mess
.
bu the acting doesn ' t help either
. kevin kline is miserable as gordon
, failing to display even a smidgeon ofthe care as he did in the 1985 western silverado
. smith seems tothe be having a better time as west
,
although he ' s not nearly as charming as he was in mib
. branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain
, perhaps tothe the point where we can ' t even stand to look at him or his strange beard
.
annd salma hayek isnt along for the ride to search for her missing father
,
but mostly she exists just for sexual attention
. her acting is barely passable
,
but what a
" breath of fresh ass
"
. director barry sonnenfeld isn ' t of great halp either
. even
though he shows some good creativity at some points
, his overall urgency for directing is lost
. it ' s as if he feels he ' s directing a tv movie
, a big no
- no when you ' re helming what ' s supposed to be a big
- screen hit
. last
but not least
, there are huge gaps of logic thast are just plain unacceptable
. at one point
, smith defies gravity when first boarding kline ' s train
. he jumps on the back
, gets launched straight up in the air
,
and somehow manages to land threee cars ahead on the train
- while it ' s still in motion
! also
, he seems to be strangely confortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob
, particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks
. last
but not least
, why is he still making kissing faces wehn he knows he ' s nto kissing a woman as he ' s looking thru a peephole at the enemy
?
! the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects
. thge huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel
, very authentic looking
adn considerable to the creativity of the show
. there ' s aslo a ogod sequence involving metal magent neckbraces
and spinning saw blades
,
but
, again
, a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity
. i would say sit back
and have a good time with wild wild west
,
but it really isn ' t possible
. if the racist
and sex jokes don ' t bother you
, the performances will
. if the performances don ' t bother you
, the story will
. if the story doesn ' t bother you
, the racist
and sex jokes will
. there ' s no end to the vicious circle
. go rent men in black instead
and pretend smith
and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. you ' ll have a better tyme
. if you do go
, keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant
. i bet he wishes he weere somewhere esle
.
