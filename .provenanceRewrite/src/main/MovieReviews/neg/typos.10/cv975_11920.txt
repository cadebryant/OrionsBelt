/ review
: in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane ' s 1947 novel
" i
, the jury
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer isnt a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses like don johnson in
" miami vice
" with less pastels
,
and has sworn off alcohol
.
however
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms of authorithy
,
and kills at a whim
. beyond that
, the updated film retains little or no resemblance to teh original pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probably the most infamous
and often reviled of all mystery writers
. the movie starts off wtih a bang
: a howler of an oppening credits sequence that is a cheap steal fomr the james bond series
, complete with cheesy graphics
and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. after that
, the movie
and the book begin the same
, with the muder of jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a one
- armed detective
and hammer ' s best friend
. hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack ' s death
,
and with the help of his devoted secretary
, the blond
and shapely velda
( laurene landon
)
,
and the alternately friendly
/ antagonistic police chief pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he is immediately on the killer ' s trail
. here the movie splits completelyl from teh book
,
and dives into a convoluted
and improbable tale of government conspiracy
and mind control tactics involving the mafia
, the cia
, oen of hammer ' s vietnam vet buddies
,
and a kinky sex clinic
. many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie
,
but they take on slightly different roles
. fo instance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner
and narcotics dealer in the book
, turns into a suave mob boss
.
and
, more importantly
, hammer ' s suspicious love interest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs from a run
- of
- the
- mill psychiatrist into the coordinator
and founder of the sex clinic
.
" i
, the jury
" is one ofthe several cinematic renditions of spillane ' s books
( including a 1953 version which was made in 3
- d
)
,
but this film differs from those earlier versions inaddition one major way
: it includes all of the sex
and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood ' s production code
.
allthough this takes the 1982 version of
" i
, the jury
" closer to the core of the orginial subject matter
, it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism
, because it took this new license to extremes thta many argued surpassed wqat was in the book
. rest assured
, thge movie not only includes a great deal of nudity
,
but it is thoroughly violent
, especially toward women
. it features one woman having her neck slashed
, a set of twins forced tothe strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia
( judson scott
)
,
adn another woman shot point
- blank inspite the belly by hammer himself
. no one would deny that spillane ' s writing hasnt a dfinite misogynistic nature
,
bu the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constant equation of sex
and violence
, much of which is palyed wih the intention of being erotic
, is quite unsettling
. it ' s no surprise that the movie
, liuke the book
, fades to black with a dead woman on the floor
.
" i
, the jurny
" had a troubled production
adn was not well
- supported by the studio that made it
, hwihc is oney explanation why it didn ' t dont well in theaters
and many peopel have forgotten that it was ever made
. the script wass wroten by larry cohen
, who is best known for his creatively cheesy
but nonetheless effective monster movies
, like
" it ' s alive
"
( 1974
)
annd its twpo sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
,
and
" the stuff
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well
,
but he was yanked from the director ' s chair after only a week ' s worth of shooting because he was already
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he was quickly replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies
and dozens of television projects
. heffron was obviously brought in nto for his talent
,
but because he sould make the movie rapidly
and efficiently
. it shows in the final product
. cohen had personal interest inspite the updated version of hammer
,
bu heffron has none
. he shot the movie quickly
and clumsily
,
and
although some scenes ring true
, most of them are flat
, trite
,
and invariably dull
. the movie features numerous car chases
, shoot
- outs
,
and stunts
,
but heffron ' s background in television is the dominant tone
; despite the graphic violence
anbd full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, the jury
,
" takes on the air of a made
- for
- tv quickie
, withthe no real punch or depth
.
but the problems iin
" i
, the jury
" run deeper than the technical
. the central fault in this updating is mike hammer
, whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties
. because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries inspite the first person
, hammer ' s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona
. we never really get that impression in the movie
-
- there is no first
- person voice
- over narration
and some scenes don ' t have hammer in them at all
. consequently
, a great deal of the texture of spillane ' s storytelling is lost
. the period updating turns out tothe be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer ' s moral code isnt thrown to teh wind
. despite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, violent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer always stuck fervently tothe his pwn moral code
. the title itself
,
" i
, the jurny
,
" refers to his anti
- establishment notion of being his own law
. unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys
and
then turn them over the police
, hammer both pursues the criminal
and exacts the punishment
. in this way
, he can be seen as
" above the law
,
"
but he still adheres strictly tothe her own peronal code ofthe conduct
, his own morality
. the movie forgoes that aspect of his charcter
,
and hammer comes off not only as amoral inthe society ' s terms
,
but in any terms
, especially his pwn
. if anything
, hammer always had his professionalism
,
but the movie does away with that in yhe first three minutes by showing him rolling inwhich the sack with the wief of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife ws being unfaithful
. maybe the scene was intended for laughs
,
but it only cheapens hammer ' s character
and is
, by all accounts
, a lousy way to start the movie
. the blame for hammer ' s character can ' t be layed on assante ' s shoulders
, baceause dispite some unnecessary marlon brandon
- like mumbling
, he delivers a fine performance
. spillane never once described hammer ' s physical attributes inspite any of the dozen books in which he appeared
, so any actor could conceivably portray him
. of course
, because of the lack of written description
, those who have read spillane ' s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like
,
and therefore alomst any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations
( spillane
, who played the character himself in 1963 ' s
" the girl hunters
,
" isnt generally considered the best of teh film hammers
)
. the rest of actors are most un
- noteworthy
. with the exceptions of alan king
and paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared in
" i
, the jury
" were up
-
and
- comers who basically went nowhere
. many of them ended up working in television
( like carrera
, who had a short stint on
" dallas
" infact the mid
- eighties
)
, which only adds tothe the made
- for
- tv atmosphere of the film
. maybe someday
, someone will manage to get the right elements together
and amke an effective film rendition of a spillane book
,
but tihs is certainly not it
.
