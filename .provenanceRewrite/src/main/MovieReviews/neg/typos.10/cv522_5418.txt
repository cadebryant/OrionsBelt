- long dragon is the computer
- generated co
- star of thsi strictly
- by
- the
- numbers sword ' n ' sorcery flick
. as voiced by sean connery
,
" draco
" is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well
- deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time
. he walks
, talks
, flies
, fries
,
and even fakes his own death
, all with the help of 96 computer
- aided animators
. too bad tht ilm
( industrial light
and magic
) couldn ' t spare some special effects for dragonheart ' s
* human
* co
- stars
. a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be
. he ' s a near
- total loss as he growls glumly through his role ofthe a disillusioned knight
. david thewlis ' evil king has a high hiss factor
( hf
)
,
though he ' s more of a mumbling oddity than anything else
. oh
,
and htere ' s some redhead in a ' 90 ' s wig
, who runs around either screaming or scowling
, depending upon if the parituclar scene has her playing the woman inwhich peril or the put upon peasant
. the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions
, julie christie
(
!
) as the good queen mother
, a band of mercenaries that apeared dressed forthe ye olde heavy
- metal concert
,
and
, believe or it not
, the speaking spirit of king arthur
. bring out your dead
! unfortunately
, when we add it all together
( draco
+ fringe bits
- quaid
- thewlis
)
, the sum total amounts to zero
. dragonheart is
, well
, too much of too littel
. director rob cohen
( dragon
: the bruce lee story
) has made a big
, expensive movie that
, hwile ambitiously plotted
, isnt both murky
and predictable
.
and overscored
.
and self
- important
.
anbd the list goes on
.
( i must ask
: did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that
* every
* character be stabbed
, lanced
, or sliced at least once
? keep taht man awya from yhe knife drawer
!
) thge last five minutes of this movie are the worst
, with soem silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show
, much less a summer movie
. save your monye
.
