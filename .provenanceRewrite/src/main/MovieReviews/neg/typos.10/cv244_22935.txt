i should have known
, damn it
, i should have known
. ewan mcgregor
- codename
:
" eye
"
- is pointing a high
- tech rifle
- ly gadget at a fat
, bald bussines
- oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street
. we get the requisite electro
- green through
- the
- sight view
. we the audience
, seeing a high tech rifle
- ly gadget
, ofthe course think that eye is going to assassinate the target
,
but instead
, he pulls the trigger
and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy
, low
- quality photographs
, whitch eye
then proceeds to fax
and e
- mail to everyone in his target ' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds in
, i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle
/ camera
,
but i was still open minded
.
.
. maybe there ' s a really good reason for it
. i ' ve got reason to believe
, ytou see
- i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor ' s previous work
.
.
.
and he ' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi for god ' s sake
.
anbd director stephan elliot ' s last movie priscilla
, queen of the dezert wass a quirky little delight
. there ' s some genuine talent involved here
. i think at the twenty minute mark
, there was still a spark of hope in my heart
. eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization ' s son
( i still have no idae what this organization was
- british intelligence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who is apparently stealing from his trust fund
. he has received his assignment from k
. d
. lang
, through an elaborate
annd expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. when eye tracks his target to an expensive
- looking secluded house
, he witnesses a mysterious
and beautiful woman
( ashley judd
) tkae a knife out
and proceed to stab the poor bastard
. ok
, that ' s odd
, i think to myself
, this coudl be interesting
.
then she starts to cry
,
and through her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" for the frist time
. so begins our tale of obsession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. teh rest ofthe teh movie involves ewan mcgregor ' s eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states
, totally
and completely obsessed by this woman from afar
. throughout his entire professional life
, he has been a voyeur
; so when he falls for someone
, the only way he can handle it is to watch
and drool through telescopes
and cameras
. fine
, that ' s a lovely premise
, i suppose
.
but gosh darn it
, if yuo ' re going to go there
, you better have some sort of explanation
.
and tyhat ' s precisely where this film fails
. this is the kind of movie that pisses me off
. it ' s an abortion
, a collection of half
- formed
and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing infact the end
. it pretends it is something that it is nto
- a surreal
and deepo psychological character studdy wrapped in a high
- tech thriller
. here
, the filmmakers have confused
" surveill
"
and
" deep
" with
" vaguely unclear
"
and
" crammed full ofthe insultingly obvious methaphors
.
" i never
, even for an instant
, had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in
" love
" with this woman who changes wigs
annd kills people
. the movei offers only two explanations
, neither of whcih make a lick of sense
. explanation number one
: the obnoxious presence of eye ' s imaginary daugher
, who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago
, tells him he shouldn ' t leave ms
. judd
. explaination two
, wich by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery
and dialog
and even the title of the movie
:
" beauty is infact the eye of the beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, tath helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. that ' s as deep as it gets
, folks
. ther is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes
, which
, instead of tying everything toghether
, ends up being as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. there are secondry characters that move inspite
and out of the picture
and serve little or noone purpose except tothe make the audience wonder wqat the hell the point was
. my personal favorites include
: the prison
- matron modeled aftter austin powers ' frau farbissina
, who apparently taught ms
. judd everything she knows about wearing wigs
; jason priestley ' s awfully played dirty desert vagrant
# 1
, who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
,
but fails miserably
;
and the cop
- who
- sees
- ashley
- fleeing
- an
- accident
- scene
-
and
-
then
- wants
- to
- pay
- for
- sex
-
but
- is
- shot
. each one in this sad little parade is a littel more pointless than the last
. the script pays no attention to tjhe laws of time
and space
. any time one of the frequent location changes occurs
, the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe
,
and minutes
, weeks
, or years coudl have passed
. bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair
- one character passes a glass of cognac to another infront a slow
- motion close
- up awash in a lot of bass
. ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he coudl be repeatedly awakened
and deafened by the giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks
,
then laughs maniacally
.
.
. cutted to random guy with eye patch
.
.
. iguana out of focus
.
.
. iguana comes into focus
. wow
, man
. when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel
, it came as no surprise to me
. there are plenty of elements here that
, if extended
and fleshed out more
, would have made for a decent story
.
and i wouldn ' t be surprised if i found out there was an hour
and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere
, or waiting in the wings for tghe dvd special directer ' s cut
.
.
. not that anything would ever possess me tothe purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing
. the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye
and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition
. some guy in the back ofthe the theater was talking on his cell phone
,
and this time i didn ' t particularly care all that much because what wass happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap
; the audience around me chuckled
and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking
. someone near cell
- phone
- guy did eventually yell
,
" shut the hell up
!
"
,
but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen
.
