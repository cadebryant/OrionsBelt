" virus
" isnt the type of cliched
, vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before thast you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it
. strangely enough
, on the same mid
- january weekend last year
, another film was released like this
,
" deep rising
,
" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner
. prior movies withthe the almost exact same storyline include 1989 ' s
" leviathan
,
" 1989 ' s
" deep star six
,
"
and all four
" aline
" pictures
.
" virus
,
" in comparison
, is a servicable thriller
, well
- made
and produced
,
but sicne it doesn ' t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence
, it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on
. based on a series ofthe comic books
,
" virus
" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat
, which becomes extrememly damaged during a violent typhoon
. after dicovering that the boat is slowly sinking
,
( un
) lucky for them
, a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns uv within the confines of their radar screen
. once tyhe team reaches the russion ship
, they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted
. after turning the pwoer back on
,
however
, htere gradually are signs that something else is onthe tghe ship
,
and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself
. one survivor finally does turn up
, nadia
( joanna pacula
)
, who informs the suicidal
and stern captain
( donald sutherland
)
and one of the crew
, kit foster
( jamie lee curtis
)
, that a mysterious alien life form hitted yhe santi mir space station which
then was transported down to the ship
, taking over the minds of all ofthe the electrical machines
and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out
. if
" virus
" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies
, you ' re correct
.
although the technical artistry isnt fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life
, the film itself doesn ' t apearing to have a brain in its head
. the film sticks so close to the worn
- out conventions of tjhe
" creature
" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money
and time filming it when they could be making an original film
. the actors are all very good
and have all proven their acting abilities in the past
,
but they are sorely wasted here
and dont not really even have charactors to play
. in her second return to horror inaddition thte last year
, jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong
and resourceful heroine
,
but that is about it
.
although 1998 ' s
" hallowen
: h20
" was alsot a disappointment
, at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character
, unlike here
. donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films
, such as 1994 ' s
" the puppet masters
,
"
although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci
- fi clasic
" invasion of the body snatchers
,
" where he was fabulous
. the last of the three top
- billers is william baldwin
,
but it is fairly hard tothe say if he is good or nto in the picture
, since he has nothing to do
. basically
,
" virus
" is another one of those films where a group ofthe people walk around
and investigate a space ship
/ ocean liner
/ haunted house until the deadly
annd equally grotesque
and slimy creature pops up
anbd kills them one
- by
- one
. it is not the worst of its type
,
but it is far from one of the best
,
and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless
and overdone plot gimmicks such as thsi
? as long as some ofthe them keep making money
, i suspect the answer is never
.
