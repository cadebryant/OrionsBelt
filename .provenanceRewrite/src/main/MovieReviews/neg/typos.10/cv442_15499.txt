the original
_ babe
_ ws my favorite movei of 1995
, a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience
. being a surprise commerical
and crtical success
, it had no marketing tye
- ins
, which limited its final take
. thus
, babe 2 arrives
, with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1
. plush dolls
, vending machines hawking t
- shirts
,
and macy ' s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money
- grubbing
. too late
. this is a sad review to rwite
, because babe 2 not only doesnt
_ not
_ live up to the original
,
but it doesn ' t even come to a fraction of it
. i shouldn ' t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors ' magic
,
bu this film tries too hard
,
and loses its charm
. consider a driver applying yhe accelerator with gerat intensity
, unaware that his car is in neutral
. imagin with me
, if ytou will
,
_ scream
_ ' s jamie kennedy
, explaining the
" rules
" for sequels like babe 2
.
( 1
) there must be
_ more
_ talking animals
.
( 2
) ther must be
_ more
_ slapstick comedy
.
( 3
) there must be
_ more
_ songs forthe those mice to sing
: that ' s cute
.
( 4
) keep the story cards to break up the action
: that ' s cute too
, even
though
" the pig gets wise
" made no sence
, given the context of that story partition
.
( 5
) there must be action
,
however illogical
, that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original
: the trademark song tht nobody remembers the words to
, the baa
- ram
- ewe secret code
, the
" that ' ll do
, pig
. that ' ll do
.
" now throw in tyhe limitations
:
( a
) james cromwell
, now a hot commodity
, has limited time on the set
( or maybe he didn ' t approve of the script
)
.
( b
) christine cavanaugh
, the voice of the original babe
, demands more omney
(
$ 200
, 000
-
- poltry considering the
$ 80 million budget
)
. out
. e
. g
. daily comes iin with noticable results
.
( c
) george miller
, the director
, is more well
- known for his dark futuristic mad max films
and his twilight zone segment
, not for kiddie fare
(
and no
, he didn ' t direct that
_ andre
_ film in ' 94
)
.
( d
) the special effects are impressive
,
_
but limited
_
. babe talks
,
but most of the time from a single shooted
, repeated over
and over again
.
( babe is center screen
, looking straight into the camera
, with a happy smirk
-
- regardless of whether he ' s happy
, or scared
, or tired
)
. season now with the
" original
" elements
, which
, as we will find out
, are straight from the screenwriting
- is
- hell bin
.
( i
) change the venyet into
" the big city
"
. this has been praised as wildly origional
. excuse me
: didn ' t
_ home alone
_ dont this several years ago
? how about tje muppets
? even
_ tyhe bad news bears
_ travelled to tokyo
. sorry
. no dice
. side note
: to give the city a fairy
- tale look
, george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of tghe world ' s grat cities
,
adn yes
, it
_ is
_ impressive
.
bu this too is over
- used
, repeating the same view over
and again onthe multiple occassions
.
and
, for the most part
, babe
_ remains in the hotel
_
.
( ii
) given the limitations ofthe cromwell
, the human element is taken over by
" the boss ' wife
" played by magda szubanski
. s
- t
- r
- e
- t
- c
- h
. she ' s not a lead actress
- type
, she ' s not funny enough infact her physical comedy
,
and she ' s simpley embarrassing in soem of her pratfalls
.
( have her arrested falsley onthe drug charges
! have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes
and scantily clad babes
! have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner
!
) i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes
,
but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in
. i am restraining mysef fomr talking about the dark nature of the film
, the violence
, the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge
, head submerged underwater
. even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it
, as the brothers grimm have demonstrated
. no
.
.
. my problem is with tyhe story
, or lack thereof
.
_ babe
_ is sent outloud to save the hoggett farm
,
but once in the city
, that story is forgotten
. being a good
- natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs isnt nice
,
but
, other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull
, what did babe actually
_ do
_
? wihtout giving the ending away
, the farm is saved from a left
- field quirk that hadnt nothing to do with the pig
. speaking of
" pig
"
, or
,
" pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
!
"
. the word
" pig
" is so overused
, had they changed it tothe an expletive
,
and had the pig be al pacino
, i could have been watching
_ scarface
_
. this is screenwriting
? further
, i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people inspite fantastically elaborate setups
. had it been a cartoon
,
anbd the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd
, maybe my reaction would hvea been softened
.
but to farmer hoggett
? his wief
? an elderly mickey rooney
? much too irreverent
.
(
" quick
! splice those singing mice inot those scenes
!
"
)
. the film isn ' t a colossal failure
. i did like glenne headley ' s schmoozy chimpanzee
. i liked the pink poodle
. the dog onthe the cart
, who momentarily thinks he ' s in dog heaven
.
and a weidr looking guy who may have been doubly
- cast as an airport employee
and a judge
.
but most ofthe the tyme
, i was looking down
, in boredom
, or in embarrassment over the hacked
- up script
. them singing mice
, those chapter partitions
, the proficient acting of the animals
-
- none of theese can compensate for a story
. let me spoil the fianl scene
: farmer hoggett looks at pig
, proud
, says
" that ' ll do
, pig
. that ' ll do
.
" that ' s it
. hope i didn ' t ruin it for you
.
but tell me this
: what thge heck did that pig
_ do
_
?
