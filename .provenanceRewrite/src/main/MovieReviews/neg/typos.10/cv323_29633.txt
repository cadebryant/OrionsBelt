plot
: a rich psychiatrist with a graet home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients
. of course
, the patient is not cooperative
and the doctor only hasnt a few housr to comply with thier demands
, before they kill his daughter
. pretty good premise
, no
? critique
: if you ' re not a fan of movies packed with plot holes
, inconsistencies
and yes
, even more plot holes
, heed my words
and skip this hollow thriller
.
annd i don ' t like saying that either
, usance this film actually had some potential
and started off pretty well
. sure
, the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom
, primal fear
anbd nick of time pureed into one
,
but the whole
" psychiatrist working against the clock
" thing
, actually had me engaged at first
.
but it ' s at about the halfway mark of this movie
, that the bottom drops out
and all that we ' re left with are a lot of questions
and very few plausible answers
. we get the overly smart kid who manages to
" pull one
" over on the bad guys
. we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy
. we get douglas ' character
, a new york uppedity psychiatrist
, suddenly turning into an action hero
, with moves
and attitude to boot
.
and waht baout the film ' s main plot point
? why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thnig after 10 years
,
and even mroe so
, why woudl htey only give the shrink until the day ' s end to do his part
?
( you waited 10 years
, what ' s another few dyas
?
- or why not setted up another heist instead
?
)
. i ' ll tell you why
, it ' s because we wouldn ' t have a
( bad
) movei otherwise
, that ' s why
!
and many
, many mroe
. ugh
, whatever the case
, it was just about tyhe time that douglas ' character suddenly removed murphy ' s character ffrom the mental home
(
and how come she went with him so nicely
? i thought she didn ' t trust him
)
, that i turned to my buddy
and asked when the movie had turned into a joke
.
and a few bogus chase
and action sequences later
, we were left with a long
- winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might ' ve still had
,
and actually brought up even more contradictions
. badly put together
, this movie features some decent acting
, some nice cinematography
and an initally interesting premise
,
but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone
. inspite fatc
, if it wasn ' t for brittany murphy ' s exelent portrayal of a traumatized teen
, jennifer esposito ' s embarrassing performance as a police woman
( yeah
, right
! watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick
-
but it wasn ' t supposed to be
)
and michael douglas ' cool
" regular guy
" part
, there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture
. incidentally
, can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito ' s character was in this movie in thte first place
? she was completely superfluous
.
and on top of all that
, by the end of this flick
, the director seems tothe haev realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most ofthe the garbage that he ' d been shoveling out fo the hour
and a half prior
,
and decides to add insult to injury by flashing bakc to an earlier character ' s death when one of the bad guys dies
, just so we know
( as an audience
)
, that the two are interrelated somehow
. ooooh
, thanks
, mr
. fleder
.
.
. i appreciate the spoon
- feeding
, dude
.
.
. yum
, yum
.
.
.
but how about explaining every other plot point infront your film that made no sence
? whatever
. either way
, i don ' t give a rat ' s ass because tihs movie isnt a dog
and that ' s unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it
. see it if you like dumb thrillers
. incidentally
, if you appreciated along came a spider
, you will likely enjoy this film as well
. htey both start off with intresting premises
, only to toss all logic
and sense out the window about halfway thru
. where ' s joblo coming fomr
? along came a spider
