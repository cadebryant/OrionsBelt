warner brothers hasnt scored another marketing coup
. the one
- two punch ws started in yhe summer
, with the release of batman forever
. trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat
, ensuring that every jim carrey fan inwhich the free world would know about the impending sequel
. carrey went on to win raves as the riddler
and the ever
- wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video
(
$ 11
. 99 at wal
- mart
)
; a mere two weeks before carrey ' s return in this marketwise
,
but misfired comedy
. ace ventura
: when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating tje rubber
- faced comic can be wehn allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment
. he may have been brilliant under hte direction of joel schumacher
, in batman forever
,
but
, here
, left to his own devices
, carrey quickly wears outloud his welcome
. the oppening sequence is by far the best
-
- an amusing spoof of cliffhanger
, with ace perfoming a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon
.
( you can guess what happens to mr
. paws
. hint
: it sounds like splat
.
) the plot quicklyu shifts to a temple in the himalayas
,
and
then to not
- so
- darkest africa
, where ace isnt on the case ofthe a missing white bat
. with his hair
and limbs both wildly askew
, carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes
. the rest of the film is just more ofthe tyhe same
. sure
, the plot ' s linear
,
anbd the prodcution values solid
,
but where is the scripted humor to support carrey ' s sloppy slathering
? writer
adn director steve oderkerk provides precious few set
- ups
. instade
, carrey just mugs away
, playing for the camera even when most of it isn ' t funny
. the better gags ahev been shown in the ads
,
though a bited with ace emerging buck
- naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino isnt something to see
.
though an arguable improvement over the original
, ace ventura
: when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over yhe age of ten
. thge script is virtually devoid of wit
. tribal mask jokes
? jerry lewis cameos
? foreget it
. if anything
, the inexplicable presence of simon callow
( four weddings
and a funeral
)
and bob gunton
( the shawshank redemption
) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor ' s ultimate challenge
. just how long
* can
* they keep a straight face
?
