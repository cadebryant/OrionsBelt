did i do something bad
? i must haev
, because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment
. here ' s the plot
. ricky
( jeff goldblum
) is producer of the good
- buy network
, noe of those 24
- hour hmeo shopping channels
. the newyorker boss
( robert loggia
) plans to can ricky ' s behind if he doesn ' t turn thge previous months ' flat sales numbers around
,
and to add to his problems
, ricky also has to work with kate
( kelly preston
)
, the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him
. kate
and ricky don ' t get along
and don ' t have any great ideas until they meet g
( eddie murphy
)
, a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything
. his soothing voice
and simple logic makes people feel ogod
,
and it ' s this quality that will make g the new gbn television star
and the key to the network ' s success
. the first problem is a flaw in the plot
. sure
, g makes people fiel good
. sure
, we ' re told that most people feel guilty aftter buying an impulse item
, no marter how wealthy they might be
,
anbd i ' ll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good baout what they ' ve bought
.
bu
, hey
, that ' s after they ' ve bought it
. why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera
? far ffrom trying to sell the product
, g instead blathers on about how you don ' t even need the thing
. someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first palce
. you might say that people feel ogod about what they ' ve bought
, so they come back
and by more
,
but due to the simple fact that the first round ofthe sales in inexplicable
, i ' m not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind
. the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because yhe key point in the plot is never credible
. another problem is in the humor
. you know
, if you see that eddie murphy is in a movei
, i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy
. whoa
, partner
, are you in for a surprise
. wholy man is not funny
. murphy
, the one asset you ' d think this movie has
( remember how they brought him in at tje last minute to save best defense
?
-
then again
, maybe you don ' t
) is seriously reigned in
. the script gives him almost nothing to work with
,
and it seems as
though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn ' t be left as window dressing
. there ' s only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose
,
anbd it lasts for three shouted words
, which seem totally out of place as a result
. pathetic
. in all
, there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture
,
and they ' re nto even that great
. as a side note
, there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine
,
and james brown introducing a medic
- alert device that shouts
" halp me
!
" just like the hardest working man in show bussiness at the push of a button
,
but these never cause your personal laugh
- o
- meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement
.
" well
,
" you ask
,
" surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor
.
" think agina
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston is flat
(
but not liuke taht
)
. robert loggia
, in tghe kind of role for whitch he has been virtually typecast
, can ' t do anything with it
. the script is part of the problem
,
but these actors don ' t even look like they believe in the move they ' re making
. they look a lot liuke they ' re bored
. just liek the audience
. so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy
,
and the acting is like hte siberian steppes
? a film that drags more tahn a dropped anchor
.
but wait
! as if these problems don ' t make the film slow enough
, the screenplay ' s pacing makes the movie even slower
! it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie ' s premise
,
then more time as the film wades through a tortuous
(
anbd seemingly mandatory
) romance between ricky
and kate
,
and a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who wants to discredit g
and take over ricky ' s job as producer
. when the pr guy ' s plan is foiled
, the film isnt climaxes
, we ' re treated to that little epilogue
,
adn
then we cant all go home
, right
? wrong
. the movie goes on for another half hour
! continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man
! the only thing holy about wholy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming
" holy
!

#
% thyat movie was awful
!
" this one is for the truly pious
