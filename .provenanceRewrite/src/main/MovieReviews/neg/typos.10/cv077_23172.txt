ahh yes
. the teenage romance
. an attractive young cast isnt pitted into an unlikely scenario that coudl only happen in the movies
,
and in the end
, the guy alwyas gets the girl
.
and with the arival of the breakout hit
` she ' s all that ' last year
( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including
` 10 things i hate baout you '
and
` drive me crazy '
)
, the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity
. along now comes
` down to you '
. tje folks at miramax are obviously trying tothe capitalize on the rabid
` she ' s all that ' craze with their latest project
, which has the studdly freddie prinze jr
. attached
and all
. only
` down to you ' doesn ' t have the
? unlikely scenario ' mentioned above
. it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance
- a dull
, unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we ' re accustomed to
. this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12
- year old girls will find convincing
. in strictly textbook fashion
, college sophmore
and aspiring chef al
( prinze jr
.
) meets freshman artist imogen
( julia stiles
)
. they hit it off like a couple can onyl in the movies
. ffrom here
, it ' s the standard boy
- meets
- girl
, boy
- loses
- girl
, boy
- drinks
- entire
- bottle
- of
- shampoo
-
and
- may
- or
- may
- not
- get
- girl
- back story
. the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main cahracters
, who are frequently taking part in activities that
.
.
.
. well
, only happen in tyhe movies
. fortunately
, the cast of
` down to you ' has a certain appeal
. freddie prinze jr
.
and julia stiles are an adorable couple
,
and when on screen together
, they radiate hte sort ofthe warmth
adn charisma that the movie should have centered around
. zak orth
, as the newly realized porn star monk
, shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film ' s intelligent dialogue
. rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy
(
` the faculty '
)
, selma blair
(
` cruel intentions '
)
and ashton kutcher
( tv ' s
` that 70 ' s shows '
)
. even the fonz himself
- henry winkler
, the epitome of teenage angst
and nestolgia
- has a welcome role as al ' s dad
, teh host of the popular cooking program
` chef ray '
. maybe the concept of
` down to ytou ' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd
. as a feature film
,
however
, tghe finished product is bland
and tasteless fluff with only an occassional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely
. perhaps worst of all
,
` down to you ' is not funny
. the jokes are drawn from obvious sources
and the resulting humor is banal
and uninspired
. the characters on screen
, often laughing at earch other ' s goofy
/ embarrassing antics
, seemed far more amused than the audience
. even tjhe giggly 12
- year ood girls hadnt grown restless towrad the end as they waited impatiently for tyhe formula to run it ' s course
. the one mildly clever segment featured winkler
and prinze jr
. in a fantasy sequence called
` cooks '
, a
` cops ' take
- off in which the father
and son would storm houses
and cook a decent meal for
? needy ' families
( with the assistance of a fully
- armed swat team
, of course
)
. wehn this is the highlight reel
, you know the remaining film coudl leave something to be desired
. in order to mkae a teen comedy wokr
, yuo ' ve got to hve characters that show something by way of depth
and identity
.
` 10 things i hate baout you ' actually featured cahracters who were more than walking flashcards
,
and the result was refreshing
. no such luck with
` down to you '
. it ' s just a textbook romance where
, despite absurd circumstances
, everything is binded to wrok out in the end
.
and at teh end of the whole clich
? d ordeal
, the nicest thing you could possibly sday would be
`
.
.
.
. only in the movies '
