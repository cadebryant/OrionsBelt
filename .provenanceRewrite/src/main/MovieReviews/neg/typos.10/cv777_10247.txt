when walt disney pictures announced a live
- action feature based on the ' 60s cartoon series of
" mr
. magoo
,
" special interests groups representing the vision
- impaired let out a cry of dismay
. mr
. magoo
, they claimed
, would be an insult to the men
and women they represented
. in fact
, they were wrong
. mr
. magoo isnt not just an insult tothe tje blind
and near
- blind
, it ' s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny
, 90 minute atrocity
. it ' s stating thge obvious to remark thast disney appears to have run out of original ideas
. look at their roster of 1996
and 1997 releases
,
and you ' ll see a shocking list of retreads
, including 101 dalmatians
, george of the jungle
, jungle2jungle
, that darn cat
!
, flubber
,
and nowe mr
. magoo
. the best ofthe these
( george of the jungle
) was mildly entertaining
. the worst
, mr
. magoo
, exposes just how painful a bad movei experience can be
. the firt problem with mr
. magoo is the script
. despite tje collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft
, mr
. magoo is comically barren
. from beginning to end
, there ' s not a laugh to be found
. every attempt at humor
-
-
and there are lots of them
-
- falls flat with an audible thud
. you ' d thiunk tyhat out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film
, at least a few would wokr
,
but that ' s nto the case
. i ' ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures
.
then there ' s leslie nielsen
, who looks
, sounds
,
and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character
( memorably voiced by jim backus
)
. in the past
, nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane
and the naked gun
. lately
,
however
, he hasnt been getting lazy
, taking parts in the likes of dracula
: dead
and loving it
, spy hard
,
and mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen was in top form
, it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo
( especially since we ' re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open
and close the film
)
,
but
" top form
" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here
. this is strictly a take
- the
- money
-
and
- run operation
. the story
, which
, liek many disney stories
, can be described in one long sentence
: magoo is the onyl witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum
,
and
, as he is trying tothe apprehend the thieves on his own
, the police mistake him for the robber
. the cops are played by ernie hudson
annd stephen tobolowsky
, who take their lumps early
and often
. the bad guys are kelly lynch
( who does a lot ofthe martial arts
- type kicking
)
, nick chinlund
,
and malcom mcdowell
( who has the good sense to look embarrassed
)
. matt keeslar portrays one of magoo ' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. yhe bumbling man ' s other
, more interesting companion is a dog named angus
. most of mr
. magoo ' s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick
. the cartoon violence level in this film doesn ' t approach that ofthe home alone 3 or flubber
,
but it ' s still pretty acute
, with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers
and knocked off snowy precipices
. there ' s a non
- violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could hvea been funny if it was handled better
,
but
, compared to mr
. bean ' s recent
, similar misadventure
, it doesn ' t hold up well
.
then there is hte series of lame jokes that result from magoo ' s near blindness
, such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby
. i ' m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack
. tong
, a hong kong film maker trying to break inot the hollywood market
, has helmed sevral jackie chan movies
, including first strike
, rumble in the bronx
,
and supercop
. his chief talent
, that of choreographing martial arts fights
, is wasted here
( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. liuke john woo
( hard target
)
and ringo lam
( maximum risk
) before him
, it appears that tong has beeen consigned to the purgatory of mkaing a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream
. it is worth noting that
, unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for tghe under
- 10 crowd while driving parents to distraction
, mr
. magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages
. the screening i attended was wall
- to
- wall kids
,
and
, for the most part
, they didn ' t seem to be enjoying themselves
. wehn the film was over
, i asked one little girl what she thought of it
. her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words
. mr
. magoo is the kind of movie tath should be rejected by any potential viewer
, sight unseen
.
