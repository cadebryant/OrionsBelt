to put it bluntly
, ed wood would have been proud of this
. a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor
, hokey drama
, zero logic
and a crap screenplay
. also
, a beautifully anti
- climactic ending
. not to say it didn ' t look intriguing when i saw the previews
. so much for truth in advertising
. roland emmerich
, who ' s later
" independence day
" would look like
" the 400 blows
" compared to this
, co
- writed
and directed this inane sci
- fi film which uses teh cliche of there being some connection between eqypt
and aliens
. iin a useless opening sequence
, men find a stone in 1914 wiht hieroglyphics on it
. it wouldn ' t be till pesent day
( ' 94
) till they would actually figure it out
. they ' re decipherer
? a slightly
- neurotic scientist
( nice twist
)
, dr
. dan jackson
( james spader
, doing his best outside of erotic thrillers
and some indy fare
) who ' s life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures aftter the third word
. why do they use him to decipher what no one else could
? so there is a hokey ending
! duh
! he figures it out in about a minute
. yea
.
and
then they get a sucidial colonel or something
,
" jack
" o ' neill
( kurt russel
, with his wyat earp locks in the beginning
thn a flat
- top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position
)
. why a sucidial colonel
? fo the ending
! you ' ll get tjhe hang of this
. they open the stargate
, a bunch of them go thru it with a bomb to blow it uv if they find anytying bad
. after an overdone special effects thing
, tehy ' re
.
.
. inside a goddam pyramid
. so they went to egypt
, right
? wrong
. they ' re on another planet that was filmed in egypt
. htey discover a cilvilization ruled by ra
, the sun god
( the androginous jaye davidson
, with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma
)
,
and there are fights
, explosions
and a kiss between two people
. yea
. also melodrama
, stupidity
, hokey scenes
and a bizarre language
. an anti
- climactic ending ends with stupid lines
(
" say hello to king tut
, asswhole
!
"
- the quintessential line
, lemme tell ya
)
anbd some convenient pesudo
- pseudo
- psuedo
- character development
. by the end
, you just wanna go home
and watch
, i don ' t know
, the
" outer limits
" or something
. yhe script ' s terrible
. the special effects are okay
,
but nothing great
. thge stroy ' s so weak that it ' s almost opaque
. the wohle experience just isn ' t worth it unless you ' re so bored that you ' d consdider watching a
" full house
" marathon
.
.
. or this
. i ' d pick this
, obviously
,
bu still
, it ' s just not fun at all
.
and i can ' t wait for it to premier on mst3k
.
