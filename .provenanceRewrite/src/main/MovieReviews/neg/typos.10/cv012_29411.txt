and now the high
- flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics
,
and it isn ' t pretty
. this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland
adn lukewarm production of the musketeer
, a version of dumas ' s the three musketeers
. by bringing in popular asian actor
/ stunt coordinator xing xing xiong
-
- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have beeen the laughable van damme vehicle double team
and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez
-
- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting
. hte end result is a tepid
and dull action
/ adventure rip
- off that stinks of indiana jones
and bad aisian kung fu
. the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay
. d ' artagnan
( justin chambers
) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer
. he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers
and find the man that killed his parents
. in paris
, he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu
( stephen rea
)
, who is trying to overthrow the king
,
and richelieu ' s man
- in
- black associate febre
( tim roth
)
, the killer of his folks
. he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded
and drunk
, so he rounds up aramis
( nick moran
)
, athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
and porthos
( steven spiers
) to free the musketeer ' s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king ' s prison
. d ' artagnan
adn his new frisky love interest
/ chambermaid francesca
( mena suvari
) play footsy
and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until fianlly the queen
( catherine deneuve
) ends up being captured by the menancing febre
, forcing the musketeers to regroup
, with d ' artagnan leading the charge
,
and save the day
. director peter hyams
( end of days
) obviously wanted to blend eastern
and western filmmaking styles
,
but here it ' s a disaster
. one problem is that
, in reality
, most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones
. jet li ' s high risk is a rip
- off of die hard
-
- not the other way around
. ironically
, there is awfully littel swordplay or acation in the film at all
-
- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes
. most aisian action films carry the bulk of their prodcution with 20
- to 30
- minute action sequences
, because they know the scenes have tothe carry the picture
. the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable
and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano
( sudden death
)
, horrible acting by stephen rea
and tim roth
,
and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers
( the wedding planner
) to deliver his mousy self as a leader
. chambers ' d ' artangnan isn ' t a musketeer
-
- he ' s a mouseketeer
!
and hyam ' s use of candles
and torches to light the grime
and filth ofthe 17th century paris are well
- noted
,
but that ' s the only standout in an overall flat production
.
