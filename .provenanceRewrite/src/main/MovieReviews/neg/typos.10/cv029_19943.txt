one
- sided
" doom
and gloom
" documentary about hte possible annihilation ofthe the human race as foretold by thge bible
. orson welles narrates
and appears in the film in which he
, along with best
- selling author hal lindsey
, discusses various prophecies from the bible
and relates them to recent
( well fo 1976 anyway
) events
. the film is dated badly
, as many thigns that are supposed tothe happen inaddition tjhe
" future
" never dont
. for example
, the planets of the solar system were supposed to line uv in the year 1982
and cause chaos here on earth
. we ' re still here
. the arms race bewteen the soviets
and america wass supposed to kick
- off the apocalypse
. we ' re still here
. some of the omre ludicrous moments come when it ' s alluded to that people like jimmy carter
and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist
(
!
)
. also
, there ' s ten minutes ofthe stock footage at the end of the film meaned to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like
. if it ' s anything like it ' s depicted as here
then it ' s going to be incredibly boring
. the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video
. it contains the film in standard form
( aspect ratio of 1
. 33
: 1
)
,
although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed
. also included are brief bios on orson welles
and hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release
, chariots of the gods
. audio is mono dolby digital
,
and teh video is fair to good for a film like this
. i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me
. certainly i never expected a remastered print
. curiously
, the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case
.
but they ' re menu screens
.
.
. so who really cares
?
