like a good action film should
,
" metro
" has action that keeps you involved
. some action films have action sequences that are so conventional
, our attention is detracted
and diverted by other thoughts
.
" the ghost in the darkness
,
" which opened a few months ago
, is a film that s action was so bland
and uninvolving
, it not only invited my thoughts to divert me
, it nearly put me asleep
.
but
" metro
" is oen of the best action films in a while
. it is hip
, sharp
, nifty
,
and has nice little pieces of suspense
and comedy
. eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while
.
and this invites me to mention last year s
" the nutty professor
,
" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be
.
" metro
" happens to be a lot better than any film inwhich tyhe
" beverly hills cop
" series
. that is becuase
" metro
" takes itself seriously
,
but doesn t prevent itself from having a littel fun
. eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of reponsible
,
and controlled people
. the
" beverly hills cop
" movies all featured eddie as a reckless
, wild cop
, always crossing the line by just an inch
. in
" metro
" he plays a hostage negotiator
, so negotiation is his job
, not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble
. his character in
" metro
" takes himself seriously
. eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be foudn in
" metro
,
"
and perphas it is quite better off that way
. murphy plays scott roper
,
and as i previously mentioned
, he is a san francisco hostage negotiator
. in the first tense situation in the film
, we are introduced tothe roper s kind of work
, as he tries to calm down a confused
, unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up
. murphy handles the scene seriously
, without his usual happy
- go
- lucky
, misfit humor
. the film develops when its villain is established
,
and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda
, a jewel thief
,
and murderer who likes tothe let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim
.
" metro
" takes differnt twists
and slight turns
,
and there isnt one great
, virtuoso chase scene
, involving the a cable car
. cars flip
. cars kresh
. cars turn over
.
and it is done so good in this film
, i was reminded of
" speed
,
"
and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons
. there are also some other good scenes in
" metro
" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have
. scenes like the one with roper
and his new partner are at the horse track roper isnt a gambler who konws all tghe tricks
and roper teachs his partner a few little methods of betting
and winning
. of course
, the writers tryed to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parrallelly between hostage negotation
and gambling
. the scenes between roper
and his girlfriend are nice
, too
. those are the scenes that make up
" metro
,
" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality
. the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in
" metro
" was michael rapaport
, who plays roper s new partner
, a lip
- reading
, book
- skimming genius
,
anbd a master of obervation
. it wass not the actor s presence thyat pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius
. rapaport is an actor who i usally see in the role of tjhe dimwit the really
, really dopey dimwit
. i hardly recognized him in
" metro
,
"
and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel thast i respect him more
. there are twpo main types of villains in movies like this
: the ones tht are part of tje story
,
and the ones tath are devices
. the villain inaddition
" metro
" is no more than a device
,
but he is a darn good villain nonetheless
. he isnt played by michael wincott
, whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp
, as if he smokes a cigarette between every take
. wincott makes his villain
, korda
, as mean as coudl be
, the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks
, like richard widmark in
" kiss of death
.
"
annd
, in addtion
, wincott s physical appearance
and mannerisms
, inthe the film
, actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have
, who is no longer on my good list
. i liked
" metro
,
"
and i do not think would hve worked with any other actor
but eddie murphy
. his past roles were the great ones
but they were also a precursor to tghe maturing that would later take place
, possably from murphy s growing as a person
, now having a family
.
" metro
" is a no
- nonsense movie
. it works as a buddy movie
, which it does not overplay
. it works as a dry comedy
, which it does not overplay
. it works as a suspense film
, whcih it does not overplay
.
and it works as an action film
, where it doens have a tendency to occasionally go all
- out
.
bu who cares
? it still remains serious
,
and it does not overdo itself
. oh
,
and there were plenty of explosions in
" metro
,
" as well
. how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those
. if there is one major objection i had tothe
" metro
"
, it was the length
, an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes
.
" metro
" is a film tht lasted a little too long
,
but it was still entertaining
,
and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end
