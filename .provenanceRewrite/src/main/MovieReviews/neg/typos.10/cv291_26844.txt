movies can do the two big es very well
: educate
and entertain
. in the best of all possible worlds
, they accomplish both
. on the red planet
, they fail entirely
. in the near future
, a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth
. this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow owudl be
. after some mumbo
- jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth
and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet
, the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does
. the ground crew of people you couldn ' t care less about is trapped on the surface without food
, water or air
and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog
. tyhe oen potentially interesting charater
( carrie
- anne moss
) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a coputer
. attempting to graft
" 2001
" esque space mysticism with
" terminator
" robot horror
, first time director antony hoffman can ' t seem to figure out what ' s going on
. neither can we
. didn ' t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting
and make sure there was a coherent story
? couldn ' t he have used the money saved by onyl having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter
? there are so many mis
- steps
. every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes
and lackluster direction
. why introduce the theme ofthe faith vs
. science if the crewman who coudl comment on it disappears early only to die
_ offscreen
_
? the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen
. two hurs later
, tehy ' re still waiting
. despite our greatest hopes
, there is no life on the red planet
