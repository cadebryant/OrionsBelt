ironically
, oen of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of eveyr moent in life
. unfortunatley i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life tothe the fullest
, because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes
, watching this sad excuse for a movie
. actualyl smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn ' t be any worse for you than it is tothe watch the movie
. nto only is it a pathetically bad film overall
,
bu 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
. the plot is scattered
, thin
and predictable
; the acting is monumentally bad
;
and the style of film making resembles a home video
. it is december 31
, 1981
and the big party is at monica ' s
( martha plimpton
) house
.
but no one has arrived
yet
. her 8 invited guests
and several people that they have picked thoughout the evening are wandering the streets of newyorker york city in various groups
. some of them know each other through their common bond ofthe having slept with monica
,
and some are total strangers
.
but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night ' s end
. those who are invited are the ones that have the issues
. it isnt up to those who aren ' t to help them come to terms
. first there is eric
( brian mccardie
) who is a former boyfriend of monica ' s
and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance
, or lack thereof
. he is one of thge most bland characters
, in a film full ofthe dullness
, because he is so utterly predictable
and stereotypical
, a common trait ofthe this poor production
. bridget
( nicole parker
)
and caitlyn
( angela featherstone
) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year ' s eve
and tag along to the party with them
. they stumble across a nameless bartender
( ben affleck
) who is the one truly perfect character inspite a film of imperfections
. he is nether sexually deprived
, nor uncertain about his future
, as he is in law school
. his lack of flaws is both boring
, unrealistic
and painful to watch
. as bridget
and caitlyn mkae passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by teh sub
- standard comedy
. moving on
, there is val
( christina ricci
)
and stephie
,
( gabby hoffman
) 2 teenage girls with fake identification
and very different thoughts
. val isnt monica ' s cousin
and a true fan of the new york scene
. on the other hand
, stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can ' t find
. paradoxically
, it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar
( actually they attempt to flee from their presence
,
but aren ' t successful
) who guide them through their fears
and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds
. of all the insanely dull
and uninteresting couples
, onyl one approaches a level of decency in both acting
and plot
. wisely
, the movie ' s creators have put heavy emphasis onthe lucy
( courtney love
)
and kevin
( paul rudd
) who are best friends
and share the common bond of being dateless
. paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie
( janeane garofalo
)
and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping arround during their relationship
.
however
, the only complexity tothe these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends
,
annd that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening
. finally
, there are the two worst performances
and worst sub
- plot of tjhe film
. jack
( jay mohr
)
and cindy
( kate hudson
) have been going out for a short period of timne
and jack just learned that he took cindy ' s virginity the night before
. while she attempts to play this down
and be her usual self
, he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy
. very often
, when a film is as putrid as this production
, there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment ofthe glory
.
however
, this film has neither the quality ofthe cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted
. instade
, waht you get is a collection of rough
annd inconsistent cuts
, bad continuity
and inaccuracies
. first
,
and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another
, htere is no apparent order that it follows
,
and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene
and shot to shot
. at other times
, objects seem tothe get up
and move
anbd hairstyles
and costumes change from shooted to shot
. there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish
. not in a single one of them does anybody pay tyhe driver
.
and
yet
, no matter how miserable this film may be
,
and no matter how poor the acting is all around
, there was a ravy of a hope for these many bad plots
. perhaps
, if the makers had jsut decided to concentrate on oen or twpo or
, perhaps
, even three
, htere might have been the time
and oportunity for some character development
, or quality acting
, or even a decent plot payoff at the end
.
bu it didn ' t happen tht way
. the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert inot a mediocre performance
,
annd eveyr story line crashed
and burned quicker than it takes for thte ball to drop at midnight
.
