" nothing more thna a high budget masturbation fantasy
" showgirls
( nc
- 17
)
- contains graphic nudity
, profanity
, sexual situations
and violence
. some people
,
however
, keep their clothes on
. you do not watch porn films for thier intellectual values
, nor do you write reviews on them
. that ' s why this review will be short
. it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores
. there is no story
, script
, point or acting
. onyl naked bodies
, whlch is exactly the point
. here is the so called plot
: nomi
, the 23
- eyar
- ood with a dark past as a hooker
, has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform inthe a show where a dancer doesn ' t wear much more than a light coating of powder
and a big
, fake smile
. noone one is twisting nomi ' s arm
. no oney is holding her grandmother hostage
. she wants to do this
.
anbd that is whta she is doing till yhe end credits
. so what ' s the problem
then
? what ' s the point
? what ' s the film about
? is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy
? this film can be described in one sentence
: obscene level ofthe incompetence
, excessive stupidity in the story line
, gross negligence of the viewer ' s intelligence
, a prurient interest in the quick buck
. believe me
, after an hour with these characters
, acting
and script
, you ' ll start hoping for someone to kill somebody
. elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film
, that is bad even for eszterhas ' script
. her character isnt the only one that is at least half written
and she could relaly have done better
. her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry
, selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public
.
" i am not a whore
! i am a dancer
"
, she screams
,
but doesnt it in such an over dramatized way that you ' ll start laughing
. in fact the acting in
" showgirls
" brings terrible to a newyorker
and previously unkown level
. not one single achievement
, besides the conventional cinematography
, is worth mentioning
. it is a total waste of tyme
and money
. there isnt not a single moment of what you might call intelligence
. the dialogue is structured ofthe ancient stereotypes
and cliches lined up one after another
. its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe
.
" infront my films
,
" writes director paul verhoeven
( ' basic instinct '
, ' total recall '
)
,
" i hold the mirror up to life
.
" well
, excuse me
? his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas
,
and as he put it
" show the naked truth
"
, is simplified
and unreal
. occasionally
, between his collecton of mistakes
and logical irrationalities
, screenwriter joe eszterhas
( teh creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history
) inserts some lines of deep morality
, taht sound something like this
:
" hey
, i see you
. i see that you ' re hiding
"
-
" from what
?
"
-
" ffrom ytou
"
. yes
,
and even the only decent line in this film
:
" nomi is what las vegas is all baout
" can ' t save ' showgirls ' from gonig under
. it ' s a strange phenomena
. it ' s not erotic
, because it lacks sensuality
. not dramatic
, because it lacks thte acting
.
and not intelligent because it lacks a story
. it isnt simply verhoven ' s bad excuse for making pornography
. yuo want to see naked women
? bare breasts
? full frontals
? it ' s nothing wrong with that
.
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store
,
and not waste time surviving through eszterhas ' pathetic dialogue
. b qualities
, while it ' s only a high budget porn
- film
.
