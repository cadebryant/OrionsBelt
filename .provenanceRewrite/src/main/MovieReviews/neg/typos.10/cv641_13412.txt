. same old attitude
. don ' t forget to recommend a film
, read the journal
, or send me some of that nasty hate mail
.
) starring bruce willis
, billy bob thornton
, liv tyler
, ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh
and j
. j
. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actually
, lots ofthe rocks fly at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points in the film
. they seem like dangerous rocks beacuse they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward
,
and when they land
- once in a while
, whn we need a break from the space sequences
- they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building
and the like
.
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events isnt made after tehy occur
.
) they also just might be the most interesting element ofthe armageddon
, a steroid user ' s answer to deep impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commissioned by the white house
adn nasa to stop a giant asteroid befoer it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? they require someone experienced with deep
- core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid
.
( in one unintentionally
(
?
) hilarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deepo
- core driller they built based on his own blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes alomst every aspect of it
. we trust nasa to build spoace shuttles taht can land onthe twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a black guy
, a wiseass
,
and hte man who isnt sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they reach space
, we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong
- perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it
; i cannot count the number of times they alomst fail thge mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whether or not they save the day
, i will not reveal
. nor will yuo care
. i will say tihs
: you know you ' re iin trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion
and scope
. willis has barely a chance to come alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third ect
, in a last minute
-
and futile
- attempt to inject warmth into the material
. steve buscemi ' s character
- the wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, isnt sarcastic
and foolish
, so they tape him to a chair
, where he spends most ofthe the film
. so why doed they bring him up there to begin with
? rather
, why rwite him into the film
?
- give his almost
- witty one
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendencies
: at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun forthe screwing his daughter
, firing often
and causing significant damage tothe his oil rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel
, at least in my world where yhe sky isnt blue
. liv tyler is preety
and humourless
, as always
; suspiciously
, four of her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. director michael bay lays the visual
and sound effects on thick
, like ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie on
- screen
.
( the middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on tjhe average primate ' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movie
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s last name here
)
!
" i must admit thgat nto once could i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as their skin was often covered inwhich fake blood
. armageddon is not as terrible movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes within its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
but at almost two
-
annd
- a
- half hours
, i could not believe how littel actually hapened over the course of the stroy
. the love story hasnt been played uv in the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch people befoer they recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout
- erase all thoughts ofthe nude sketching or car
- sex
and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remember a little film called jaws
? in this film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark
. they didn ' t much like each other at first
; eventually
, they started to respect noe another
. one of jaws ' great scenes involved the would
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stories
. this is teh sort ofthe male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix
and expect we ' ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end
. not once do we get tyhe feeling that these characters are even acquaintances
- i ' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before
" action
" was called
. a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch ofthe men who don ' t bare their souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts liek heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
anbd if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movie written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i ' ve never been a prouder wimp my wohle life
.
