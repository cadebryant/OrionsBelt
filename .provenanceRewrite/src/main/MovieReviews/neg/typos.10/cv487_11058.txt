adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy
, thge wedding singer
. unfortunately
, that also has the effect of softening his edge
. he ' s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore
, not that it wass much of one
. he ' s certainly nto helped here by a rather frail plot
. the year is 1985
, letting the hwole film obsess with 80s nostalgia
. adam sandler is nice guy robbie
, the titular wedding singer
, who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits
. robbie ' s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at the altar
.
however
, things are looking up when he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at the hall
. she ' s the perfect woman
,
but for one small flaw
: she ' s engaged tothe be married to a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he
and julia are in love
,
and his attempts tothe stop the wedding
. as far as plots go
, it ' s a pretty thin
and tired one
. to fill the gaps
, the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia
. ffrom boy george tothe michael jackson
, from miami vice to dallas
, from the first cds to the lastr rubik ' s cubes
, this film revels in all the minutiae
.
and
then there ' s the music
.
.
. learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank
,
and romy
and michele ' s high school reunion
, this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running tiome will allow
. as a result
, most songs get maybe a lyric or a half
,
bu yuo can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives ' eyes
: the wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
,
and 4
! while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring
, at least they distract you from the plot
. at least last yera ' s my best friend ' s wedding stirred up the standard
" keep your true love from marrying someone eles
" plot by making the rival a nice person
. here
, glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him
. barrymore
, on the other hand
, is simpley charming as julia
. which leaves us with adam sandler
. he ' s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little
( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception
)
. when he ' s in full nice
- guy mode
, he ' s more pathetic tahn endearing
. the film boasts several cameos
( most notably by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
)
.
but none of them work well at all
. buscemi ' s role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous
. lovitz
, on the other hand
, as a rival wedding singer
, makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live
, where he was actualyl funny
. the only cameo which has soem appeal is a guest appearance by a clasic 80s rocker druing the film ' s finale
( surprisingly
, one of the only plot
- realted scenes which actually works
.
) adam sandler still hasnt some wokr to do before he cant become a dependable leading man
. while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer
, the end result is no net gain
.
