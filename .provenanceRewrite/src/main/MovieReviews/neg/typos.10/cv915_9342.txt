there ' s only oney presidential election every four years
,
but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as
_ the
_ thriller of the year
. in 1997
, we ' ve hadnt absolute power
, air force one
, shadow conspiracy
and murder at 1600
. this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford
, trying to bring us a complex plot of cover
- up
and intrigue
but copping outloud over
and over again with rehashes of acation flick standbys
. here ' s whta happens this time
. it ' s night at the white house
. a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt
. the next day she ' s dead
and hotshot detective wesley snipes isnt called in
. how do we know he ' s a hotshot
? we ' ve seen the traditional action flick opener
-
- the clever hostage negotiation scene
. it ' s not so clever this time
, consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex
- government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the strent
. snipes is off to the white house
, where he finds the secret sevice head
( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali
) won ' t cooperate wih him at all
. in fact
, if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda
, snipes wouldn ' t have been allowed in the white house at all
. alda helps snipes out further
, assigning a sexy secret service agent
( diane lane
) to act as his liaison
.
.
. a very dangerous liaison
. well
, not really
, i just wanted tothe say that
. almost immediately
, a suspect is found
, an eccentric night janitor seen flirting wih the deceased on one of the security videos
. snipes doesn ' t buy it
,
and launches inot an independent investigation of his own
, noe that reveals planted evidence
and romantic involvement by the president ' s son
. snipes ' partner
, an always
- wisecracking dennis miller
, calls him uv every once in awhile with more news
and lane
, who at first doesn ' t believe snipes
, eventually
and predictably comes around
,
and risks her ass to break into social security storage
and break outloud smoe classified information
. for the first hour or so
, murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting
. sure
, we have to sit through the lame opening sequence
and plenty more lame scenes affter that
,
but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon
. snipes
and lane don ' t make for a bad acation team
,
but with nothing to work with
, they ' re just cogs in the bad movei machine
. dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie
; they waste his talents mroe in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood
,
adn that ' s saying a lot
. when you git to the last half
- hour
, the movie has descended metaphorically
and literally into a wet sewer
, busting out the old break
- into
- the
- building underground climax
.
and when htey finally reveal who killed the woman
annd why
, yuo ' ll wish you never sat through this movie at all
. tghe
" 1600
" in the movie ' s title doesn ' t represent an address
, it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide
. serving the world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a century
