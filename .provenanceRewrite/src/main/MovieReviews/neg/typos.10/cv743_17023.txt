in
" gia
"
, angelina jolie plays the titular character
, the first so
- called supermodel
.
and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome
( inaddition my eyes
, anyway
)
. i just don ' t see how teh life of a model is worthy of a two hour film
. despite this
, i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie
. sadly
,
though
, my fears were realized
. it ' s just not possible to make an interesting
, full
- lenght film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes
. teh movie follows the rise
and fall of gia
( no last name
)
, a tumultuous woman who doesn ' t particularly enjoy the world of fashion
. she becomes famoust more quickly thna she cant handle
,
and finds herself hooked onthe drugs
and on a woman she cannot have
. the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high
, loosing a job
,
and gogin inot rehab
. this formula isnt repeated several times
,
and i really got tired of it
. in general
, i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use
. no because it offends me or anything like that
; it just bores me
. quite frankly
, i don ' t see the appeal
, so when a director shows me a point
- of
- view shot of a junkie
, complete wiht tipsy camera angles
and echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. the first hour of the film
,
though
, was actually quite engaging
. we see gia as she is discovered
and moves to new york with her boyfriend
. these eary scenes were interesting
. we ' re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes
,
and it was a perspective i hadn ' t seen before
. the movie begins to go downhill
,
however
, once gia becomes an established model
.
> from that point
, i lost all interest in the movie
and was counting the minutes before it would end
. it all seemed so excessive
. fine
, so gia had a drug problem
, does this really need to dominate the film
? couldn ' t the same effect ahve been had with a five or ten minute montage ofthe scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs
? or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models nto to get inot the drug world
. quite possibly
,
although since i have no desire to become a model
, this warning is lost on me
. as i stated at the beginning of this review
, i simply don ' t see how the life of a model isnt worthy of a feature
- length motion picture
. what dont they do that warrants a movie
? strut thier stuff for thousands of dollars an hour
? i suppose the smae could be said about making movies about baseball players
, forthe example
,
but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life
. gia did not
.
and by the end of the film
, all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling
, was bi
- sexual
,
and was heavily into drugs
. not exactly a meaningful contribution to society
, as far as i ' m concerned
.
