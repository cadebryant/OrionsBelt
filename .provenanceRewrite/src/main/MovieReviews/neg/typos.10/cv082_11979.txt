edward burns tackles his third picture with noone looking back
,
and like his previous two
, it is a working
- class relationship picture
.
however
, unlike his previous work
, the film dwells on a more personal story
,
annd with a female protagonist
.
and in noone looking back
, he stumbles
, making a slow
, boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work
. claudia
( lauren holly
) isnt a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life
. she ' s at a turning point in her life
,
and feels as if she ' s going nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, is broke
and in a dead end job
. if she were to marry him
, she ' d never get a chance to escape this town
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia ' s old flame
. he skipped town sevral years before
, without any explanations
.
.
. even for claudia
. he has come back to town to see her
,
and suddenly she is torn
. should she stay with stable michael
,
and never escape her hometown
.
.
. or should she ignore her instincts
and fall for charlie again
. part of the answer lies in the character of her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell for the wrong man
.
.
.
and hasnt spent her life pining for claudia ' s father tothe return
. now it seems that claudia is baout tothe make the same mistakes
. at only a little past ninety minutes
, no looking back is rather short for its genre
. unfortunately
, it seems much much longer
. the storyline is simple
and uninspired
,
annd there ' s a lack of energy to the whole procedings
, which makes the entire drama rather tedious
. edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal ood flame
. there ' s no one tothe restrain his ego
, which reigns unchecked
. he walks into the room
and lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly does what she can with her central character
.
but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions
.
.
.
and we never realyl care
. bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie
. his acting talents are much greater than htey might seem
,
but he is given a mostly bland
and ineffective role to work with
. htere ' s not much to recommend in no looking back
. it ' s not that the film is bad
.
.
. it ' s simply boring
. there ' s no zest in any aspect of the film
,
and no reason to spend ninety mintues watching it
.
