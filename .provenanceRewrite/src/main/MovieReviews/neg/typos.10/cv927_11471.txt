teh lives of older peopel in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories
and possible futures is a fascinating topic
. finding an all
- star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius
. combining all that with a three
- time oscar
- winning director
( robert benton of
" kramer vs
. kramer
"
)
and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment
. in
yet another noir mystery set in hollywood
-
- how many of these have we seen during the past few years
?
-
- the atmosphere is moody
, yhe actors enjoyable to watch
and tyhe stry goes nowhere
. over
- 70 harry ross
( paul newman
) is a washed up cop
- turned
- private eye
- turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life
. he ' s screwed up things pretty well
(
" i had a wife
and daughter
. now
, i ' m a drunk
)
and is at a crossroads
. a couple of years ago
, he traveled to mexico to bring bakc mel
( reese witherspoon
)
, the under
- age daughter of jack
( gene hackman
)
and catherine
( susan sarandon
) ames
and now lives with them
. thge ames are former movie stars
, past their prime
annd the three ahve become fast friends
. one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up
. tothe fill his time
, he does odd jobs for jack
and falls in love with catherine
. jack is in even worse shape than harry
. he ' s dying of cancer with only a year to live
. things do turn more exicting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him
. instead of the routine errand that ross expects
, he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex
- cop who is
, himself
, full of bloody holes
. this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself inot
and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine ' s first husband 20 years before
. through a series of very complex
and convoluted plot devices that envolve murder
; blackmail
; guns
; mel ' s mexico traveling partner
and his parole officer
; ross ' s former cop buddies
, ex
- lover
and would
- be sidekick
, the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to
. it ' s a film noir tradition that the story twists
and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale
,
but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about
. the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role inaddition the scenario
. by yhe time they show you
, it doesn ' t marter
. the storyline gets goofier
and goofier exemplified in ross ' s relationship with rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. these scenes are obviously desined to be comic relief
,
howver they are neither
. rubin
anbd ross have some past relationship
but either it ' s not explained or i didn ' t care enought at that point to remember
. a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probablly meaned to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform
. it ' s also not funny
, doesn ' t connect
annd keeps on showing up long after it has run its course
. on the positive side
, it ' s oftenly enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors onthe the screen
. the three leads all have well
- deserved academy awards
and turn in accomplished
, if not extraordinary jobs
. newman is a grand actor
,
but doesn ' t seem quite suited to the dark film style
. he is a bit too clean
and understated to come across as desperate
and down
and out
. hackman
, also low
- key
, is believable
bu lacks sparkle
. sarandon comes accros well as an sultry older babe
although she is one
- dimensional
. the actors do what they cxan with lame dialog
,
bu they can ' t pull the film out of the hole it ' s dug for itself
. james garner who plays ross ' s old buddy ex
- cop raymond hope is always a treat
,
but even he half
- heartedly struggles through lines like
" i ' m glad they didn ' t shoot your pecker off
.
" the best part of the film is the look at ood friends
, how their relationships change over yhe years
and the difficult choices tehy must make
. teh genuinely easy
and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than whta ended up on the screen the film doesn ' t run very long befor the audience realizes that it ' s hopeless
. the only reason for watching is the actors
. it reminds me of diaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where the star power is supposed tothe make everyone ignore the film ' s problems
. in a better world
, there would have beeen second
- rate actors infront this second
- rate movie
annd the ones here would have been saved for something better
. of course
, we don ' t live in taht better world
,
but you could make yours a littel nicer by choosing a different movie
.
