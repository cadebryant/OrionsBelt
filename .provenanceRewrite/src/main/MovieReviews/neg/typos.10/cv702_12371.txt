in 1990
, thte surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above
- the
- title stars
, patrick swayze
, demi moore
,
and whoopi goldberg
. eight yersa later
, moore
and goldberg ' s careers aren ' t exactlly thriving
,
but they ahve had their share ofthe screen successes since
; yhe smae can ' t be said of swayze
, who has just added
yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog
. forget teh mortal kombat movies
-
- this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games
. good truck driver jack crews
( swayze
) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey
. along the way
, jack
and his crew of three run inot a number of obstancles
-
- such as a highway weigh station
, evil truckers
,
and deadly uzi
- firing motorcyclists
. eveyr so often
, like at the end of a video game
" level
" or
" stage
,
" the main baddie pops up
: red
( meat loaf
, fresh from the triumph of spice world
)
, who wants to steal the cache of guns
. just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who ' s driving what
, all of red ' s vehicles
, be it a pickup or a big rig
, are painted
-
- you guessed it
-
- red
. i could go into more of the plot specifics
( such as jack ' s dream of having a nice hmeo with his family
, the past trauma that sent him to prison
and cost him his trucking license
, the fbi
/ atf crew tracking the cargo
)
,
but tehy are of little importance
. all that matters to director kevin hooks
and writers william mickelberry
and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b
.
but tehy fail at even this modest goal
, fo none of the higway chaos
, as credibly staged as it isnt
, is terribly interesting
, let alone exciting
. once you ' ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time
, you ' ve seen it every time
. as dreary as balck dog isnt as an entertainment
, tje saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen
; it ' s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work
. while far from the best of actors
, he is certainly not horrible
,
and he is a charismatic presence
. i don ' t know if it ' s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog
. regardless
, if he continues on this career track
, coudl a tv series be far behind
?
