starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie
,
though it took me a few dyas to conclude this
. the film isnt more masturbatory than bleak
, with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity
.
( he has a
$ 6000 a week drug habit
.
) ultimately
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age ofthe twelve
; you are less mystified by his self
- destructive nature than bored into a stupor youself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young author who arrives in l
. a
. with ambition
anbd a nasty drug habit
. he eventually gets a gig for
$ 5000
/ week writing for a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled stand
- in for
" alf
"
: chompers looks just like alf except he ' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she can get a green card
,
and hooks up with a spanish mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permenant midnight is structured mostly as a flashback
, with recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restaurant
, where stiller works the drive
- thru as part of rehab
)
, tkaing him back to a hotel
,
and bewteen bouts of sereous screwing
, listening to his life story
. i ' ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i ' ve been trying to figure out why hurley did fidn stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect
( post
- there ' s something about mary
) of either the actor or a comedy writer
. what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby
! watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawless performance
: the film coudl double as a documentary on how to be a junkie
.
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless
. whn the movie poses hte question will stahl be saved
?
annd
hten answers it in the form of bello ' s character
( basically a shrink in black panties
)
, could a person care less
? in the film version of his authobiography of hte same name
, stahl doesn ' t need saving
, he needs someone who will sit there
and listen to him go on about himself
. if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie
, it ' s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood
- types known to man
.
( stahl also seems tothe be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs
. is this hollywood
.
.
. california
?
) i learned very little baout yhe entertainment business from permanent midnight
and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead
. of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems
. so
, basically
, his drug habet got him a book deal
, a movie based on his life
,
annd now he ' s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects
. so much for the moral of that story
. temporary midnight isnt more like it
