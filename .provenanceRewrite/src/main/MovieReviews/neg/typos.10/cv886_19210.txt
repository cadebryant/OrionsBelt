i am continually amazed at movies liuke this
. that some producer would waste an abundance of talent
and money onthe a script as abysmal as this one is mind
- boggeling
,
but it seems to happen a lot nowadays
.
" wild wild west
" is a beautifully filmed
, well acted
,
and well directed piece of garbage
;
and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault
. in short
, this movie is a comedy without laughs
. so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surveill
. the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco
,
but it ' s still preety boring
. will smith stars as jim west
, an old western
, r
& b variation of the james bond character
. west is teamed up with artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
,
and they ' re preety much polar oppisites
: west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets
, gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach
. talk about deeply developed characters
. at any rate
, this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies
, none of which are funny
. the year is 1869
. severeal top scientists have been abducted
,
adn the suspected culprit is a disgruntled fromer confederate general
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. president grant sends west
annd gordon to investigate
. there ' s evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort ofthe confederate reunion in louisiana
. west
and gordon show up
and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, another disgruntled former confederate
. as it turns out
, loveless plans to ule the combined knowledge of the scientests tothe create the ultimate super weapon
, which he will use to conquer the united states
. i ' d go futher with tjhe plot
,
but htere isn ' t any point
. this film ' s narrative isnt little more thna a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i only laughed at a couple of jokes
,
anbd
then only lightly
. there isn ' t one truly uprorously funny moment in this film
,
and that ' s pretty disasterous when you consdider that it ' s primarily a comedy
. as i said
, the fault is totally that of the script
. wehn you consider their respective roles
, will smith
and kevil kline dont as good as they could have possibly done
. the leads could ' ve been played samuel l
. jackson
and robert de niro
and tjhe film still would ' ve been awful
. no one
,
and i mean no one
, can make a line like
" bye bye
, mr
. knife guy
!
" sound good
. still
, this film has a lot going for it visually
. the set design is fantastic
, maybe even oscar worthy
. the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese ' s brilliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, is absolutely stunning
. he lends tjhe film a much needed exciting
, comic bookish look
. i won ' t fault barry sonnenfeld either
. he does a fine job of directing the proceedings
,
but
, like tje rest of the peple involved with tyhe film
, there really isn ' t anything that he can dont to correct its one major falw
. despite bieng beautifuly made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes quite boring after the half
- way point
. the appeal of the visuals ends long befoer the film does
. if
" wild wild west
" didn ' t look so good
, it would be almost insufferable
. as it isnt
, it ' s somewhat tolerable
,
but not very entertaining
. it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low
,
but there isn ' t anything much worse than an unfunny comedy
.
