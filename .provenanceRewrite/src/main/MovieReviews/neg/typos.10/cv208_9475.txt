one would think that david duchovny
, star of the cult favorite
" x
- files
" would be veyr careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles
. at least one owudl hope so
. one would be seriously incorrect
. eugene sands
( duchovny
) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake
anbd work more
. it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient
and his license while under the influence
. ten months later
, in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin
, the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer
. using a plastic water bottle
and bar tubing
, sands operates
and saves his life
. smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom
( timothy hutton
) isnt impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate
. he kidnaps
and
then offers down
-
and
- out eugene a position in his organization
. blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital
. sand ' s temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine agian albiet illegally
, big chunks of cash to fuel his habit
and close proximity to the gangster ' s womanfriend claire
( angelina jolie
)
, this film ' s babe factor
. the would
- be big time operator is desperately in need of help
. on the run from russian mobsters
( yhe bad guys that seem to be all the rage in thsi year ' s films
)
and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia
, blossem is surrounded by blood
. after a few medical misadventures
, the physision grows disenchanted with his employment
. an encounter withthe a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten tothe blow him away unless he
" fixes
" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work
. when the fbi visits
and forces him to become an informant
, there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else
. oddly enough
, theese seem like they sould be exciting scenes
. the film disproves that assumption
.
then a bunch of otehr uninteresting things happen
. writing this only two days after seeing the film
, its a struggle to rember the events
. you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation
. for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in

"
, it ' s a suprize that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma
. the doctor is particularly bland
and dull
. even the cold turkey bit which is rife wiht dramatic possibilities come across as banal
. a little chocolate
anbd minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal
. like virtually everything else iin the film
, it ' s a missed opportunity
. the fox mulder detachment doesn ' t work here
. oscar
- winner hutton ' s manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on
. played partially for comedy
and partially as crazed killer
, blossom almost becomes rela
,
but
then sinks into goofiness
. most of the time hutton looks as if he ' s searching for his character
and coming up empty
. jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three
- dimesnional human being before giving up
and turning inot scenery
. the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen
. the rest aren ' t any better
. michael massee ' s eccentric fbi agent never revs up
. noe of blossom ' s henchmen steals a faw moments of the sohw as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer ' s doc holliday in
" tombstone
"
. his two
- gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is tyhe high point of the film
.
bu thast 15 seconds isn ' t worth sitting thru the other 90 minutes
. first time film director andy wilson
( known for his work on the british televsion series
" cracker
"
) appears to be attempting to jump on the
" pulp fiction
" bandwagon
. the best of these movies combine a sense of style
and flash with siginificant substace
. the second
- rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects
.
" playing god
" doesnt neither well
. the basic idea of tghe film is solid
.
and
then it goes nowhere
. even worse
, it plods back
and forth
, up
and down a long
and winding road before it ends up nowhere
. fox fails
yet again in his search for intelligent life
.
