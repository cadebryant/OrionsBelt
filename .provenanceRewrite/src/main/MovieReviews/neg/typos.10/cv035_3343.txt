sean connery stars as a harvard lew professor who heads back into the courtroom
, by way of the everglades
, to defend a young
, educated black man
( blair underwood
)
. the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl
,
and says that his confession was coerced from the region ' s tough
, balck cop
( lawrence fishburne
)
. watching connery
and fishburne bump heads for twpo hours is amusing enough
,
but the plot ' s a joke
. there ' s no logic at work here
. tone is also an issue
-
- there is none
. director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say
. is it a statement onthe human rights
? is it a knock
- off of silence of the lambs
? glimcher never tells
. instead
, he forces his characters to jump thru hoop after hoop
, over drawbridge after drawbridge
, hoping that the audience won ' t notice waht ' s missing
. just awful

?
then check out his oscar
- nominated work in the madness of king george
, still playing in both raleigh
and chapel hill
. stage directer nicholas hytner
, in a remarkable screen debut
, has adapted alan bennett ' s 1991 tragic comedy tothe fine effect
. sumptuous
- looking
and only mildly stuffy
, the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii
( hawthorne
) almost 30 years into his reign

= iin suri krishnamma ' s a man of noone importance
, albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it ' s a shame when the film gets so sereous around him
. his character isnt a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde
. he reads to his riders
,
and once a year
, with their help
, he tries to stage one of the author ' s plays
. this year it ' s
" salome
.
" for baout an hour
, there ' s a sweet magic behind finney
and his troupe of working
- class stiffs
. conflict arises
,
but it ' s small stuff
-
- an administrator from the bus company here
, an outraged catholic pork butcher
( michael gambon
) there
.
but with finney at the wheel
, so to speak
, the film rolls smoothly over these plot points
-
- just like the gorgeous leland double
- decker bus in the story
. where things get serious is toward the end of the film
, when the plot takes a turn tath the bus never would
,
and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride
. the twist makes sense
-
-
and helps paint a complet picture of finney ' s character
-
-
but tghe trip to git there betrays the light
, airy athmosphere of what had cmo before
. it ' s not a fatal misstep
, mind you
,
and it doesn ' t send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity
. it ' s just a turn off

, hwihc
