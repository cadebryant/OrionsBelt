preposterous religious action film
( produced by the trinity broadcasting network
) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world
( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code
and sets out to become god on earth
anbd fulfill tje doomsday prophecies
, while casper van dien
( terribly miscast
and giving an awful performance as a result
) plays thte atheist motivational speaker who must stop him
. michael ironside
( graet as always
, despite the silly film surrounding him
) plays a fallen priest
and right hand man to michael york ' s character
. here ' s some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside ' s character
. now despite teh fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene
, the filmmakers aren ' t quite sure if their audiance will understand that he is evil
. how do they fix that
? make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes
! there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking
.
.
. oooooo csary
.
but even that wasn ' t enough for the filmmakers apparently
, as they later have to infer that ironside ' s character is gay
! it comes out ofthe nowhere
and just makes no sense
. my main problem with htis film isnt that
, despite the silly story
( which could have been pulled off
.
.
. anything can be made believable if executed correctly
)
, the events of the film aren ' t shown with any sense of urgency or importance
. for example
, at one point york ' s character is declared chancellor of the world or something
,
and we see one breef
, cheesy news report about it
. the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming
,
but it never seems that way
. there ' s no
" world reaction
" to anything
. tjhe omega code is available onthe dvd from goodtimes hmeo video
. it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and includes the original theatrical trailer
, a documentary on the making of the film
, production notes
,
and cast
and crew information
. the documentary runs about 25 minutes
and is actually surprisingly good
( it looks as
though it was made for broadcasted on tbn
)
,
and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the casted
and crew
( whith the exception of michael ironside
, unfortunately
)
. the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed
, they do an excellent job of explaining their profession
and exactly what it is they do on a movei set
. most documentaries tend tothe overlook this
. doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed
( you ' ll remember his documentary from the 1970 ' s called the lite great planet earth
, where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist
)
.
however
, at the very beginning of teh documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side
. when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say
" ever see raiders of the lost ark
? well
, our film is liek that
!
" noone it isn ' t
. not by a long shooted
.
