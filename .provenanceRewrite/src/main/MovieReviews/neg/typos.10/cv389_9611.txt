ripe with explosions
, mass death
and really weird hairdos
, tsui hark ' s
" double team
" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean
- claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie
- bedpost
and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career
. actually
, in
" double team
,
" neither ' s performance is all that bad
. i ' ve always been thge one critic to defend van damme
-
- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars
( namely steven seagal
) never aim for
; it ' s just that he ' s never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 ' s
" timecop
.
"
adn rodman
.
.
. well
, he ' s pretty much rodman
. he ' s extremely colorful
,
and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t
, even if the role isnt that of an ex
- cia weapons expert
. it ' s the story that needs some major work
. van damme plays counter
- terrorist operative jack quinn
, who teams up with arms dealer yaz
( rodman
) to rub out deadly gangster stavros
( mickey rourke
, all beefy
and weird
- looking
) in an antwerp amusement park
. the job is botched when stavros ' son gets killed in the gunfire
,
and quinn isnt taken off tothe an island known as
" the colony
"
-
- a think tank for soldiers
" too valuble to kill
"
bu
" too dangerous tothe setted free
.
" quinn escapes
and tries to make it back home tothe his pregnant wief
( natacha lindinger
)
,
bu stavros is out for revenge
and kidnaps her
. so
, what ' s a kickboxing mercenary to do
? quinn looks uv yaz
and the two travel to rome so htey can rescure yhe woman
, kill stavros
, save yhe world
and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do
. with crazy
, often eye
- popping camera work by peter pau
and rodman ' s lite brite locks
,
" double team
" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure
.
but too much tries tothe happen in each frame
,
adn the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated
. the numerous action scenes are loud
and headache
- inducing
and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about wqat ' s going on in the movie
.
and much of what ' s going on is just wacky
. there ' s a wohle segment devoted to net
- surfing monks thast i have
yet to figure out
.
and yhe climax finds quinn going head
- to
- head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle
, trying to avoid running over land mines
and hold on to quinn ' s baby boy
( who ' s in a bomb equipped basket
)
-
- all thsi while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers
. did i mention
" double team
" is strange
? when it all comes down
, this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon
, albeit one that feels noone need to indulge in gratuitous profanity
. rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona
,
though
, leading up to a stunt where he kicks an oponent between the legs
.
but we didn ' t need
" double team
" to tell us he could do that
, did we
?
