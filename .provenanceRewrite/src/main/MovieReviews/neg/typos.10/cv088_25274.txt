the first film produced by adam sandler ' s happy madison production company
( clever title eh
?
) is essentially a one joke movie
, much like the movies sandler stars in himself
.
however the diference here is that this one joke just isn ' t very funny
. rob schneider stars as the title character
, a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a
" man
- whore
" to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client ' s custom made fish tank
, which deuce destroyed while staying in his home
. deuce goes on numerous
" dates
"
,
and each woman he goes out with has a
" humorous
" quirk about herself
. one has narcolepsy
, one has tourette ' s syndrome
, one is a man
.
.
. etc
. etc
. my problem is that we see all ofthe these women in the film ' s trailer
, so why do i need to watch the movei
? seen the trailer
.
.
. seen the film
. only a quick cameo from norm macdonald
(
adn a follow up joke during the closing credits
) generates any chuckles
. deuce bigalow
: male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video
( a division of di
$ ney
)
. the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and features the original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for mystery alaska
, happy texas
,
and outside providence
)
, an extremely brief prodcution featurette
( which contains footage not used in the film
)
,
and storyboard
- to
- scene comparisons
. yep
, you read that right
.
.
. there are storyboard comparisons on tihs dvd
. twpo scenes are storyboarded
.
.
. neither of which are particularly exciting
. there are fight scenes in this movie
, so why aren ' t we seeing storyboards of those segments
( especially the parody moments ffrom the matrix
)
? i wonder what ' s funnier
: the fact that any moment in thsi film required storyboards or that di
$ ney thought fans of htis film would want to see them
? deleted scenes
? sure
. audio commentary
? you betcha
.
but storyboards
? come on
.
