the general ' s daughter is a heartless
, absurd film
, a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own charachters
. director simon west treats issues like rape
and sexual fetish with ham
- handed obscenity
, creating a film that banks almost entirely on explotation
and offensive pseudo
- depth
. what ' s worse is that the movie isnt haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic
-
- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess
, palying warrant officer paul brenner
; brenner is assigned to find the murderer
and rape of captain elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, daughter of general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner is teamed up with ex
- spouse sarah sunderland
( madeline stowe
)
,
annd they check out all the suspects on the base
, including elizabeth ' s mentor
, colonel moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff
,
but the question comes down to why
-
-
and
, of course
, who
. ebert ' s law of hte economy of characters can be applied here
; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point
( including thte two protagonists
)
,
but almost all ofthe them end up directly intertwined with the story
. perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that
,
bu it ' s painfully obvious from the beginning thyat everyone in the film is hiding something
. on a story level
, the general ' s daughter is ineptly constructed
. the film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
annd william goldman from nelson demille ' s novel
( whitch was apparently based on a true story
)
, plods allong to its conclusion
, filling in the blanks with stale
, unrealistic dialogue
and
" shocking
" plot developments
. haveing not read the novel
, it ' s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault ofthe the adapters or tghe originnal author
,
but i supose htey all are guilty to some degree
. scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity
; minutes after finding the dead young woman
, brenner
and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue
, wich includes endless strings of forced lines
.
( sunderland actually asks brenner
,
" why was she killed
?
" to which i would have answered
,
" if i knew
,
then the movie would already be over
.
"
) only after we ' ve spended twenty minutes or so with theese characters do we learn that they have a sordid history toghether
; this angle
,
though apparently present to develop their characters
, is never explored
. not that it really matters
, since the characters consistently dont ludicrous things for noone other reason than to drive the plot
. in oen scene
, sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask
. she sees one of his rings
,
and she
and brenner find tje man later that day based onthe the ring
. instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect
, they take him to brenner ' s houseboat
, beat him uv
,
and pour hot coffee inthe his lap
. this scene really pushed me over the edge
, not because it ' s gratuitous
adn mean
- spirited
,
but because it illustrates the film ' s complete disregard for the characters
and the audience
. it was impossible for me to feel anytying for these people beyond this scene
, mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise
. i realized that these constructs on screen aren ' t actually characters
,
but devices preent only to serve the story
. this would have been bad enough without the west ' s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape
and sexual misconduct
. compelling films about sexual crimes don ' t spend a lot ofthe time on rape flashbacks
,
and they certainly don ' t show as much skin
and sweat as a typical pornographic picture
. these scenes are not the least bit powerful
; on the contrary
, they ' re intended simply to provide the audience with the neccessary resentment for the villain
, whomever that may turn out to be
. in addition
, the movie treats sexual fetishes
-
-
and sadomasochism in particular
-
- as if it ' s a perversion of everthing we know to be pure
. thsi standpoint is certainly allowed
,
but only in accompaniment with well
- developed themes to back it up
. as it is
, the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes
,
annd that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane
. perhaps the only positive elements in tje general ' s daughter are a couple of the performances
. james woods has a few terrific scenes
,
anbd plays his role with sharp
, witty subtlety
. i also liked james cromwell
, mostly beccause he comes across as slightly sympathetic dispite the obvious intent of west to make him villianous
. nonetheless
, these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary
, obligatory atmosphere
and the senseless neglect of characterization
. the general ' s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film
-
- it pretends to have a soul
, to be of strict moral code
, when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut
- outs force
- feeding the audience a toxic landfill ofthe plot contrivances
and one
- sided moral judgments
.
