as bad as
" mimic
" ws
, it definitly scared me
.
" mimic
" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity
and style
,
and completelyl flushing it when he comes to amercia to mkae a movie
. director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning
and inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" that movie worked because it took an unconventional stroy
, unique characters
adn well written plot
annd dialogue to create a truely scary movie
. in
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn ' t bother to give us anything original
. teh plot is a stupid combination of
" aliens
" meets
" species
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" tyhe charachters have been recycled from a fewd hundred other movies
. there ' s nothing new in
" mimic
"
. it ' s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work
. at the end of the movie
, you ' re stuck wanting your money back
. maybe thte worst hting about the movei isnt thyat del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies
: he forgot to turn the lights on
. i don ' t understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the
" seven
" trend
and be setted in dark
, dank areas
. watching
" mimic
" i was tempted sevral times to yell at tyhe screen
" turn the lights on
! the switch is to your right
! use common sense
! just dont it
! you ' ll be able to see the monster in the corner
!
" there ' s a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on
annd off
. it looked like the light operator was having a seizure
,
and sorvino didn ' t even notice
- she just stood ther looking like she was having deep thoughts
.
" hmmm
.
.
.
. i think bean soup would be ogod for dinner tonight
.
"
" mimic
" has a lot ofthe incidental shock tatics
( boo
! just kidding
!
)
and follows them up with the real scare
,
but nothing in this movie scares you
. the audiance in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments
; i think they were bored
, too
. i shouldn ' t blame del toro
. he isn ' t the first successfull foreign director to come to hollywood
and make a bad movie
. hong kong director john woo made twpo of the best action films ofthe all timne
,
" the killer
"
and
" hard boiled
"
then came to america to make the stupid
" broken arrow
.
" french directors luc besson
(
" la femme nikita
"
)
adn george sluizer
(
" the vanishing
"
) followed woo ' s lead
and made dumbed down versions of those movies
. robert rodriguez
, who directed the terrific low budget
" el mariachi
" came to hollywood
and directed thge horrible
, high
- budget
" desperado
.
" i don ' t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his ocuntry can ' t make a good american movie
. woo finally broke through
and made
" face
/ off
"
,
but it still isn ' t up to par with his earlier films
. i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office
, chews on a big smelly cigar
and says to the director
,
" welcome to america
! i bet you must be tired after bieng on that boat for so long
. do you speak english
? nowe
, i know you thikn you ' ve made good movies in the past
,
but now you ' re in america
, so things are a little different here
. just remember what the american audeince always wants
,
and you ' ll be fine
. they want to see at least one big breasted woman
, characters that they ' ve seen a thousand times before
( because change scares americans
)
,
and you always need a cheesy feel
- ogod ending to wrap things up
. if you don ' t make that kind of movie
, you ' ll be shining my shoes infact no time
.
