i ' ll be the first to admitt it
. when you mention the book great expectations
, i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class
, where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip
and magwitch
. yes
, it ' s a classic of literature
,
bu it was a rather dry one
, shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine
. certainly
, the experience wasn ' t truly that bad
,
but
, to quote ethan hawke inaddition the latest movei adaptation of said book
,
" i ' m not going to tell the story the way it happened
.
.
. i ' ll gonna tell it the way i remember it
.
" anyway
, to return from nostalgia lane
,
and get back to the present
, hollywood
, in it ' s trendy attempt to modernize the classics
, now presents an updated film version of great expectations
. instead of pip
, this time the central charactor is named finn
( played as a boy by jeremy kissner
,
and by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or should that be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
and her boorish fisherman husban
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. the setting is the florida coast during the mid
- 70s
. finn is a blooming artist
,
and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish
( one of his twpo favorite subjects
)
. during one of these escapades
, he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page from tyhe superhuman max cady
, deniro ' s criminal has a seamingly limitless lung capacity
,
and favors hiding on the ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. maybe thta ' s an exaggeration
,
but he certainly beats any ofthe houdini ' s records in the opening scenes of the film
.
and that ' s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn ' s motorboat
,
but i digress
. anyway
, finn does the convict a good deed
, just tothe show that he ' s a really swell guy
.
and
then the plot moves on
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago
, ms
. dinsmoor is the epitome ofthe hte crazy rich old maid
. with bizarre clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
and a few pounds of makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role
.
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character
, she does add some humor tothe the film
. joe isnt hired tothe help with the gardening at her unkempt manner
,
bu the insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. for no apparent reason
, other than to provide the main plot of the film
, finn is instantly stricken for the estella
. perhaps it ' s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person
, or maybe finn has simpley never met a girl before
. in any case
, neither as childrens nor adults
, chemestry simply doesn ' t exist between the two
,
and
yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her
. even when
, as an adult
, finn arrives in new york at the behest ofthe a mysterious benefactor
, reacquaints hismelf with estella
,
annd draws her portrail in the nude
, there ' s nothing
. in fact
, there is more sexual tension between helen hunt
and greg kinnear ' s gay artist during a similar scene in as ogod as it gets
. at this point
, the audience has grown as cold
and detached as estella ' s character
,
and couldn ' t care less about the two characters
. the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails to imbue estella
, a remote character in the book
, with even the vaguest traces of humanity
. there ' s obviously something wrong when
, watching the film
, you ' re more interseted with how big her nose looks in silhouette thna ytou are about her character
. without a strong estella
, finn ' s obsession seems baseless
. you wish he would jstu stop whining
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
,
and just get on with his life
. in fact
, the two relationships that wrok in the film are purely tangential tothe the main plot
. finn ' s relationship witht his brother
- in
- law
, joe
, is intresting
, if a bit stereotypical
. what ' s more fascinating are his interactions whith deniro
.
although it ' s only a bit part
, it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create
. it isnt apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of thte film
. smoe of the shots work
,
but others are too obviously staged
( for example
, both of the water fountain scenes
) to have any impact
. finn ' s art
( actually the creations of italian painter
, francesco clemente
) isnt used throughout the film
,
but it mostly fails to ahev the intended effect
. we never see why finn would ganerate this style of art
, which is simultaneously crude
and insightful
. as a result
, it ends up as distant as the rest of the film
. modernizing the classics is currently inthe vogue
( just see william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simply update tghe action tothe a modern setting
,
and apply plenty of modern rock
.
bu such adornments do little tothe perk up great expectations
. as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it
, you ' d probably be better off suffering
though a reading tahn watching tihs romanceless film
.
