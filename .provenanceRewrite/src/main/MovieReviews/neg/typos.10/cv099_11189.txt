whether you like the beatles or not
, nobody wants to see the bee gee ' s tkae on some of the fab four ' s best known songs
. well
, maybee that ' s not true
.
.
. maybe you ' re curious
, the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose
. you just have to know how bad bad can be
. if that ' s the case
, rejoice
, because it was twenty years ago today
( or so
) tyhat sgt
. pepper ' s lonely hearts club band was released
( unleashed
?
) to the world
,
and thanks to our modern technological advances
, you can find this retched piece of filmmaking onthe vhs
. derivated from the lyrics of various beatles ' songs
, sgt
. pepper ' s tells the story of teh fictitious band made popular from the song
(
and album
) ofthe hte same name
, released in 1967
. of course
, the movie was made eleven years later
, the gibbs three have become tyhe lonely hearts
, peter frampton is the one
and only billy shears
,
and aside from being about a rock band
, tje sotry doesn ' t correlate to hte song at all
.
and oh
, what joy
- we ' re yhe lovley audience they ' d like to take home with them
. i don ' t think so
.
but at least these characters are actually
* people
* in a beatles ' song
, whereas other characters such as strawberry fields
( sandy farina
) gets her name from a song about a
* place
* called strawberry fields
. the edbate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it
, because all the film really has to offer is a faest ofthe horrid cover tunes
, embarrassing cameo appearances
( george burns
?
! steve martin
?
!
? alice cooper
?
!
?
!
)
,
and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 ' s fashion
and faces
. check please
! the plot is a bit unclear
. peopel with bad 70 ' s hair run around in leisure suits engaging infront music video sequences that look like a sick
and twisted world of make
- believe from an overly demented mr
. rogers
. mean mr
. mustard
( frankie howerd
) somehow gets hold of all billy
& co
. ' s instuments
, calling dr
. maxwell edison
( steve martin with a silver hammer
and an out
- of
- key singing voice
)
, the sun king
, marvin sunk
( alice cooper
!
)
,
annd a couple ofthe creepy robots tothe his aid
. supposedly this is a horrible thing
? i guess in heartland
, the talent is pretty non
- existent
. meanwhile
, the lonely hearts are off doing the classic
" sex
, drugs
,
and rock n ' roll
" thing
, leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love
, billy
. she sets out to find him
, leaving her poor dad
adn mom
( mrs
. fields
! hey
, wanna cookie
?
) all alone to sing a horrible rendition of
" she ' s leaving home
"
, accompanied by those same creepy robots
.
but is billy getting it on with lucy
( dianne steinberg
)
? ya know
, thte diamond possessing girl who hangs out infront the sky
? well
, there ' s some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building enxt to a bus stop
,
and i assume that ' s who it was
. it ' s movies like tihs that make ya sit back
adn ask the unanswerable question
,
" what the hell were they thinking
?
?
?
" nobody will ever know
,
but as a novelty
, sgt
. pepper ' s is one to examine
. carol channing
, robert palmer
, keith carradine
- they ' re all here
.
but why
?
?
?
? who knows
. it ' s irrelevant
. there ' s as much meaning to be foudn here as there is to be found in your belly
- button lint
,
although the latter may be more interesting
. with the recent onslaught of 70 ' s nostalgia in the movie world
( the ice storm
, boogie nights
, reissues of the star wars triology
, etc
.
)
, let ' s pray this doesn ' t git a special 20th anniversary
, second
- chance in theaters
. in tjhe words of paul mccartney
, live
and let die
. in fact
, bury this oney while you still can
.
