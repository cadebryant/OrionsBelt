one ofthe the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o ' donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton ' s 1925 silent film seven chances
. nowe i ' ve never seen seven chances
, as i ' m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan
,
but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this
. o ' donnell plays jimmie shannon
, the manager of a pool table manufacturing company
. he also fears commitment
,
and despite dating anne
( renee zellweger
) for over three years
, he ' s unwilling to marry her
. his reasons
? well he ' s a guy you see
,
and well
, guys are like stallions
,
and they aparently don ' t like to be roped or something
( hey
, that ' s the movie ' s explanation
.
.
. i ' d marry renee zellweger in a second
)
. eventually it comes timne for jimmie to propose
,
and when he does
, it ' s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever
. he essentially says to her
,
" you win
"
and hands her a ring
. the audeince should now hate this character
. i did
.
then the meat of the plot presents itself
. jimmie ' s grandfather
( peter ustinov
, completly wasted
) dies
and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership ofthe the pool table business
.
however
, in order to get the money
and save the jobs of the factory workers
, jimmie must be married before his next birthday
( which is just over 24 hours away
)
. having blown his chances with anne
, jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends
and suggest a
" business proposition
"
. the movie wasn ' t half bad by this tiem
, surprisingly
. it wasn ' t boring me
,
and even managed to read my thoughts at one point
. ustinov ' s character left a video will
,
and while he ' s reading the ridiculous clause iin it
, i thought to myself
" what is this
, brewster ' s millions
?
"
. as soon as i throught it
, hal holbrook ' s charactor actually says
" what is this
, brewster ' s millions
?
" it was quite surreal
. something happens
though during the film ' s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was goign to receive
. up to that point
, all of jimmie ' s prior girlfriends hadnt turned down his
" business proposition
" which i felt wass good
. at least the film wasn ' t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers
. wehn jimmie has no other options
, his goofy friend
( played by artie lange
, making a carrer out of playing the goofy friend
) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story
. at tihs point
, 100
, 000 women don wedding gowns
and head off to persuade jimmie to pik them to be his bride
. these women arrive at jimmie ' s location
and imediately start bullying him baout what he ' s looking for in a woman
. when he ' s had enough of their unjustified attacks
, he tells the angry mob that there ' s been a mistake
and he won ' t be marrying any of them
. as a result
, the women proceed to chase him around the city
, in hopes of catching him
and tearing his limbs off
. this goes on for the rest of the film
. it ' s just chris o ' donnell running fomr 100
, 000 obnoxious
, greedy
, angry
and stupid women
. my groans of disgust could be heard for miles
. the film finally ended
( thankfully
)
,
but to thsi day i ' m still groaning
. the bachelor is available on dvd ffrom new line home video
. it contains the film in both full frame
and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, cast
and crew info
,
and special dvd
- rom features
. the orignal theatrical trailer is also on the disc
, which contains scenes not infront the film
. apparantly there wass even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o ' donnell around the city
,
and at one point o ' donnell is leaping from the tops of buses
. so that was bad enough to be cut
,
but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good
? ugh
.
