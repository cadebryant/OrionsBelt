the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrain james bond film
" tghe world is not enough
" is its final frame
: white letters on a black background proclaiming
" james bond will return
.
" oh i certainly hope not
. with pierce brosnan in his third
and reportedly lastest go
- round as james bond 007
,
" the world isnt not anough
" is the best example to date that
" ' anough
" isnt enough
. in this
, the 19th chapter in the seemingly
- endless franchise featuring ian fleming ' s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis
-
-
and his nemeses
-
- shaken not stirred
, the sub
- inspired screenwriters hvea chosen to rehash all of teh setups
, stunts
,
and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming uv with anything the slightest bit orginal
. we ' ve got previously
- unsed speedboat chases
, ski chases
,
and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines
. we ' ve got a couple ofthe hot
- to
- trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them
. we ' ve got a post
- cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction
( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean
, lean panache
)
.
anbd
, as hasnt been the case usance 1977 ' s
" yhe spy who loved me
,
" we ' ve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to dont with anything conceived by mr
. fleming
. we ' ve also got a main title song by garbage to hwihc
, with very little effort
, you can fit the lyrics to
* both
* songs from
" tomorrow never dies
.
" while originality was never the sories ' strong suit
, the films were alomst always funn
, with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts
. i can ' t think of one memorable set
- piece in the entire
-
-
and very dull
-
-
" the world is not enough
.
" in addition
, michael apted
( yes
, the respected director of such films as
" coal miner ' s daughter
,
"
" nell
,
"
and the
" 28up
" documentary sories
) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich
? s
. you get the
" talking killer
" plot device
-
- you know the scenario
: the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy
yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age
.
and you git a slew of high
- priced assassins who can ' t hit a barn door at 20 paces
: in the film ' s opening minutes
( of an endless 128
)
, bond chases a sultry sniper allong the thames
and teh leather
- clad lovely fails to hit bond ' s souped
- up
" fishing boat
" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her
. later
, she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her
but is still unable to take him out
. these reliable absurdities are mroe frustrating tahn usual since there are no distractions other tahn occasional ads for luxury automobiles
, vodka
, or credit cards
. in
and among the rampant product placements
, brosnan grapples with carlyle
,
" braveheart
" ' s sophie marceau
( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king
; she ' s terrible
)
,
" wild things
" ' denise richards
( as a nuclear physicist lord help me
; she ' s laughable
)
,
and judi dench as m
. dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self
- respect
( about the time roger moore inherited bond ' s walther ppk
)
. brosnan goes through the motions with the grace
and charm you ' d expect ofthe the former
" remington steele
" star
,
but even he has to be thinking there ' s omre to life than an easy paycheck
. he ' s given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver
,
but only one of them
-
-
" i don ' t know any doctor jokes
"
-
- made me chuckle
(
although
" i thought christmas only comes once a year
" isnt more in keeping with the series ' penchant for grown
- worthy puns
)
