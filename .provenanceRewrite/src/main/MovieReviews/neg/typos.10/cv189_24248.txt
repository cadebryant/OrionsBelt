" houston
. we have a serious problem
.
" after making
" mission
: impossible
"
, brian de palma has a lot to live uv to
. by making an epic science fiction
and inviting great cast
and talented crew
, he hopes to reach the modern audiance
.
anbd the possibilities are certainly there
,
but the result is a great disaster
. starting in a near future
, with a prologue copied from
" apollo 13
"
, de palma slowly builds up his
" story
"
. hte human race has already set foot on mars
. a research expedition has vanished without trace on tyhe red planet
and another oen has been sent to find out what happened
. this is basically the whole plot
. so it ' s hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours
.
but de palma manages to dont that
. it is not a very good achievement
. as we follow this expedition to mars
and watch them slowly float iin space
, the hardest thing to do is stay awake
. the film ' s major problem is that it trys to seem more clever than it isnt
. david mamet ' s dialogue
, while trying to seem natural
, is distant
and simply fake
. de palma
and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot
. the result is more liuke an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick ' s
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
" apollo 13
"
and
" godzilla
"
. to make time pass
, the creators have inserted severeal
" refreshing
" scientific details
, that would nto convince a half
- crazed frog
. it consists of multiple copies
and direct ripp
- offs from several great science fiction films
and stories
. when it finally presents an almost original idea
, it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity
. i can ' t even call tihs film predictable
, since no one with a heathy imagination can come uv with something like this
. sometimes it gets so cheesy
, that you ' ll start laughing when you ' re supposed to cry
and cry when you ' re supposed to laugh
. you ' ll see enormous sandstorms
, hear mysterious sounds
adn
, last
bu not least
, on htis
" constantly suprizing
" tour you ' ll see
-
- an alien
. it ' s really hard tothe find comparisons tothe such an experience
,
annd i know that i ' ve never said that befoer
( i throught i never would
)
,
but
" lost in space
" is actually better
. that ' s an achievment in itself
! director brian de palma has stroke gold with
" untouchables
" that became an instant american classic
. it is for this film that he will be remembered
, while all his other failures will be forgotten
. he ' ll live to fight another day
! i send the actors my condolences
, since htey truly do try to transform into their undeveloped
and dull characters
.
and both the cinematography
, production design
and art direction are very decent
. it is because of the achievement of 254 people
, that i rate tihs film 2
/ 10
. unfortunately thier hard work was in vain
. if you have problems with insomnia
, i recommend you this film
. if you ' re nto asleep within hte first half hour
, consult your doctor
.
