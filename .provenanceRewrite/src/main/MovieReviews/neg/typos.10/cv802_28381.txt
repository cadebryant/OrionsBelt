if you ' ve beeen folowing william fichtner ' s career
(
and ther ' s absolutely no reason why you should have
)
, you might have noticed that he ' s played smoe rather similar roles over the years
. like sully in
" the perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and a little bit scary
. or law in
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and little bit scarier
. or colonel william sharp in
" armageddon
,
" or dwayne engelman inaddition
" strange days
,
" or even his brief appearence towards the beginning of
" pearl harbor
,
" as the abusive father of danny
-
- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough
, gruff
, hard
- hitting roles
. which is why his performance in
" what ' s the worst that could happen
?
" is such a shock
, such a delight
. in the film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner ' s performance borders on caricature
bu goes beyond it
. it borders onthe offensive
but doesn ' t really manage it
.
and it borders on clich
? d stereotype
bu doesn ' t quite succumb to thast definition either
. in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming
, fichtner isn ' t perfect
-
- you can see him struggling a littel at times
, concentrating a little too hard on teh look as he swishes his hand through the air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close
and personal
-
-
bu he ' s pretty damned good
,
and silly
,
and without question the best thing in the film
. in fact
, hadnt it nto been for fitchner ' s sudden
and bizarre appearance
,
adn his jarring screen presence thereafter
, i woudl have walked out
, for
" what ' s the worst that could happen
?
" is mesmerizing in its awfulness
, a poorly written
, haphazardly edited
,
and totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence
and danny devito so how could that be possible
?
) moviegoing experience
. fichtner ' s performance doesn ' t exactly save teh film
,
and it ' s not like i ' m recommending
" what ' s the worst that could happen
?
" solely on the strength of the ctor ' s dramatic turnaround
,
but his contributions do raise the film ' s rating from no stars tothe one
-
and
- a
- half
. thumbs uv to fichtner
then
,
and thumbs down
-
- way
, way
, down
-
- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess
, a movie so dull
and pedestrian
and nonsensical it doesn ' t even warrant discussion
.
