affter the huge success of
" the exorcist
" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable
,
and sadly like most horror fims that make mone
, the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel
, that makes absolutely no sense at all
,
and to me was extremely pointless
, wasting linda blair
and max von sydow completely
. needless
, dumb sequel flopped in the box office
,
and never gained much success
though it is voted as one ofthe the worst sequels ofthe all time
, to which i agree with
. to start the
" story
" it is four yersa later
,
and regan is being tormented by memories of what used tothe be
, now a priest played by richard burton
, isnt trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan
,
and now the demon somehow wnats tothe possess her again
( maybe she was good or something
)
. now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan ' s body
, befor it is too late
. some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is
: linda blair
, she had no need to revive her character
,
and she is really terrible inthe this film
, she brings it down to a lull
,
and in places it seems like it just stops in its place
,
and doesn ' t go anyhwere
. louise fletcher is alright for what it ' s worth
,
but she could have done a lot better than tihs
. the direction by john boorman
, is that of a confused
, stylish nature that i relaly couldn ' t figure out
. in fatc
, i had no idea what was going on in this film
, the script was jumbled
, the plot was jumbled
,
and hte ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad
. for those exorcist fans who haven ' t seen this one
, i recommend renting it
. i actually gave this one a high rating
, if it were any worse it would hvae deserved zero pumpkins
, i went easy on it
however because of hte fact that it has a bit of good direction
,
but nothing else
! im not saying i like yhe film now
, so dont start going anyhwere
. bad
, bad
, bad movei
.
