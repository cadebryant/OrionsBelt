i ' m guessing
-
-
and from the available evidence
, it ' s not a great guess
-
- thyat burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire ofthe hollywood excess
, stupidity
, ego
and power
- mongering
. if so
, the film that ended up on tyhe screen ranks as one ofthe the most spectacularly ironical unintentional jokes infact film history
. it has already been well
- documented that the original title
, an alan smithee film
, became a problem whn miserable test screenings forced re
- cuts agains the will of director arthur hiller
, prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors ' guild
- mandated pseudonym of alan smithee
. tyhat left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas
, as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor
.
and you could just smell the disaster brewing
. if you ' re unfortunate enough to sit thru burn hollywood burn
, you ' ll still be smelling that disaster long aftter the lights cmo up
. ostensibly
, it ' s a pseudo
- documentary account of a director named alan smithee
( eric idle
) who loses control ofthe a big
- budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone
, whoopi goldberg
and jackie chan
( all of whom appear as themselves
)
. when the only recourse available tothe him is abandoning the project to be called
" an alan smithee film
"
-
- which
, of course
, it already is
-
- smithee steals tje negitive of the film
and threatens to destroy it
. among the parties interviewed are the film ' s producer james edmunds
( ryan o ' neal
)
and studio boss jerry glover
( richard jeni
)
, who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them
. it ' s bad enough that burn hollywood burn has
-
- literally
-
- not a single laugh forthe its entire
, blissfully brief 84 minutes
. what mkaes it even worse is eszterhas ' insistence apon telling every bad joke not once
,
but twice or even three times
. michael ovitz references
, showgirls refrences
, oral sex references
, whoopi goldberg
/ ted danson references
-
- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that isnt eszterhas ' stock
- in
- trade
. the reduncancy even manages tothe turn actively offensive with some frequency
, notably with the hilarious use ofthe the word
" feminist
" as an identifing caption fo eveyr single female charater in the film
. by the time coolio
and chuck d show up as black independent film
- makers the brothers brothers
( cleverly identified as
" bad a
-
-
"
and
" badder a
-
-
"
, among other unprintable things
)
, yuo may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head tothe avoid being identified
. thsoe documentary captions
, fo all their leaden obviousness
, allow the best insight into what ' s so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn
. not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit
, eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears
. the producer is a
" liar
" who
" slept in the white house
;
" the media are
" maggots
"
and
" leeches
" working for publications like
" the new york slimes
"
and
" newsleak
"
( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don ' t miss the joke
)
. it doesn ' t even matter that eszterhas tags
" penile implant
" after his own name whn he makse a cameo
, because it seems like such a desperate attempt tothe feign self
- deprecation
. this is a petulant schoolboy ' s idea of satire
-
- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas hasnt taken a pen to draw little moustaches
and black out the teeth
. the last stomach
- churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outloud
- takes over the closing credits
, the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour
and a half of your life away
. perhaps it was just a final
, desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind tje film
, or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career
. pity everyone involved with this excessive
, ego
- driven
" satire
" of excess
annd ego
. it ' s too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this
. otherwise
, you might have seen credits fo burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees
.
