bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review
: the odd couple ii grumpy old men
, it ain ' t
. hell
, my fellow americans
, it ain ' t
. walter matthau
and jack lemmon team up again for an even moreso worn out vehicle than any of their films over yhe past few yersa
. odd couple ii fiels terribly generic
, where in the firt movie
, made thirty oen years ago
, feels like a wonderful tale
. that ' s like repackaging campbell ' s soup in a generic food can
, really
. how writer neil simon could ' ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me
. throughout tjhe movie
, i really didn ' t laff once
. honestly
. i mean
, htere were dumb situations
, yeah
, like the cropduster who let these ood geezers have it wihtout any notice
,
but tehy just really didn ' t seem funny to me
.
and thyat car rolling off the cliff
? the only way i woudl ' ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it
.
and the ending gets all super
- mushy
, too
. infact the final twenty minutes or so
, lemmon meets a girl he thikns is the one
,
then loses her
; matthau talks to his son
( a wasted jonathan silverman
) about his amrriage to lemmon ' s daughter
;
and
, of course
, lemmon
and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands
. ooh
, i really gave a lot awya there
, i ' m sure
. consider it a hospitable gester
, yuo won ' t waste your time renting this muck
.
