aspiring broadway composer robert
( aaron williams
) secretly carries a torch for his best friend
, struggling acotr marc
( michael shawn lucas
)
. the problem is
, marc onyl has eyes for
" perfect 10s
,
" which the geeky
, insecure robert certainly is nto
. meanwhile
, marc ' s spoiled
( hetero
) female roommate
, cynthia
( mara hobel
)
, spends her days lying about their apartment
and harrassing magazine editor tina brown
. writer
- director victor mignatti ' s
" very romantic comedy
"
( as the ad campaign states
) is supposed to be
( pardon hte pun
) a gay ol ' romp
,
but it ' s hard to have much fun wiht these annoying
, self
- absorbed characters
and their shallow personal problems
: marc
and cynthia have sitcom
- level domestic
" crises
"
( such as trying to kill bugs
-
- how hilarious
)
; robert
and marc go to acting class
( how riveting
)
; the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges
( how original
)
.
but more than anything else
, the three whine
. constantly
. marc whines about his turbulent romance wtih an apparent
" 10
,
" david
( hugh panaro
)
, the hunky musician from across the way
; robert whines about not being able tothe find the right guy
; cynthia whines about having to find a job
( horrors
)
. the terrible trio whine their way to a happy endig that is wholly undeserved
. add in overly broad performances
and some laughable lipsynching by panaro
,
and you ' re left with one astonishing peice ofthe cinematic damage
.
