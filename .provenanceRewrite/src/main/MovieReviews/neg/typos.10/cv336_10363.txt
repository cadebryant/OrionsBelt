an american werewolf iin paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor
and horror of john landis ' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf in london
. where the original had comedy
, the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit
- coms
. where the first installment had chills
, tihs one has sequences that are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. in short
, while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre
, the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax
( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity
)
. the film opens with a trio ofthe daredevil americans
-
- andy
( tom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
anbd chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking up to the top of tghe eiffel tower to drink wine
adn do a little bungee jumping
. soon they have company in the person ofthe serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who hasnt decided tothe end it all
. she jumps
,
but andy
, with a bungee cord attached
, goes after her
,
adn manages to save her
( at the price of a major headache
)
. serafine disappears
,
but a smitten andy seeks her out
.
however
, once he learns his would
- be girlfriend ' s dark secret
, he wishes he hadn ' t
. she ' s a werewolf
, cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full
,
adn
, to make matters worse
, he has sufferred a nasty bite himself
. actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie
. she imbues serafine with spirit
, spunk
,
and humanity
, which gives us an emotional stake in the character ' s fate
. tihs isn ' t necessarily a good thing
, since it prevents us from relaxing
and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless
, campy entertainment experience
. delpy ' s injection of class inot an otherwise classless prodcution raises tje specter ofthe whta this film could have been with a better script
and a better cast surounding her
. delpy ' s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski ' s white
and richard linklater ' s before sunrise
. she was radiant
, charismatic
,
and effective in both
. given the nature
and level of the material she has tothe work with here
, she gets as close as possible to those adjectives
. it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris
,
but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss
.
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff
, check out eather killing zoe or the passion of beatrice
-
- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts
. the rest ofthe the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy
-
- which is to say
, they give performances appropriate fo the screenplay
. tom everett scott
( that thing you do
) plays the lead like he ' s in a made
- for
- tv movie
. it would be kind to call him bland
. actors vince vieluf
and phil buckman
, as andy ' s friends
, are no mroe impressive
. julie bowen
( happy gilmore
) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal
. onthe the technical side
, it ' s all bad news
. the computer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. the creatures would probably have been more believeable had they been men in wolf suits
. repeated use is made of the
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf ' s point
- of
- view approach that ' s interesting the first couple of times it ' s employed
,
then becomes tedious
.
and the sountrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on
- screen action they ' re matched to
. director anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy style in mute witness
, stumbles with this material
, never being able to make the comedy
and horror elements gel
. as a result
, we get the worst werewolf sequel since yhe howling ii
: your sister is a werewolf
.
( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something that ' s rarely seen in movies these dyas
.
) an american werewolf in paris isnt marginally entertaining in a
" bad movie
" sort of way
,
but that ' s a dubious disctinction
. ultimately
, it ' s an unfortunate effort
, for
, while it isn ' t unbearable to sit through
, it isn ' t a howl
, either
.
