this well
- conceived
but ultra sugary coming
- of
- age film is not for everyone
,
and i include myself as one of those who foudn it too sappy for my digestion
. joseph cross
( joshua beal
) is a 10
- year
- ood who is saddened by thge recent loss of his grandfather
( loggia
) to bone marrow cancer
. loggia is wonderful in relating to yhe child in such a wholesome manner
, it almost saves this film from drowning in syrap
. the beals are like a sitcom idyllic familiy
, where everyone is jsut so nice
and affluent
,
and properly religious without bieng fanatical
. the beals
, tjhe father
( denis leary
)
and his wife
( dana delany
)
, are both successful doctors
; julia stiles plays joshua ' s older sister
, needling her younger brother
but also showing that she really cares about him
. this is a familiy seemingly conceived in heaven
,
but living in south philadelphia
, sending their children tothe a well
- run cathlic school
. joshua
, the protagonist
and teh narrator of this yarn
, is a handsome
, sweet
, intelligent
, friendly
,
and endearing child
, who does well in school
, relates to the nuns
and priests
,
and talks politely to his well
- meaning parents
. all htis mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch
. the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather
, who promised to be with him forever
. his answer is to search for god
, pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do
,
but that ' s just the way it is
, sometimes
. this search for god takes us nowhere because
, as his friend david
( reifsnyder
) says
, where can you look for him if he doesn ' t exist
. now
, that ' s a smart kid
.
but joseph looks for him in the usual places
,
and what better palce than to start in the parochial school he attends
. one of his teachers is the kind
- hearted sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, who wears a philly baseball hat
adn equates the jesus stories with baseball
, making him tje clean
- up hitter
,
and in my opinion
, if she wasn ' t a big tv star
, would have a vocation as a parochial skool teacher
, she is that convincing
. throughout tje film
, she is saved from answering any tough
( sic
!
) question about god by the bell
, as it rings to end the class
. nothing much happens in the search forthe god
, there is no parody ofthe tje catholic school
;
though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god
,
but htis is gentle stuff
, noone rela criticism or search for god is attempted
. what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum
, which is designed not to upset anyone
, as joseph has a reassuring encounter wtih a real
, live angel
, a blond little boy his own age
adn dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody
- goody
. the film ends as this angel
(
!
!
!
) tells him his grandfather is all right
. his quest is ended
, as apparently angels don ' t have wings
adn are approachable
;
and god
, well
,
.
.
. maybe that ' s for another film down the road
. this part ofthe the film was the final straw for me
, i couldn ' t swallow any more goo
. as this film flopped commercially
, his next oney
, the sixth sense
, pared down the schmaltz
and came up smelling like a rose
.
though if yuo look through the cleverness of both scripts
, this director is loaded with hokum
, all he has learned how tothe do
, is hide the hokum better
. well
, god bless him
, if he can dont that
. this is a nice family picture
and there is room for it in hollywood
. it ' s just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death
, childern in a parochial elementary school
, or for taht matter
, about god
.
and that family ofthe his
, they ' re too good for words
.
yet the film meant well
and its benign message had its heart in the right place
. for those who want to see something soft
, without a bite to it
, htis is the one
.
