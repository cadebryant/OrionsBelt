plot
: a separated
, glamorous
, hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together
. kewl
.
.
. now i onyl wish thast i could pretend never tothe have seen this movie
.
.
. critique
: trite
, unfunny
, boring
and a waste of everyone ' s talent
. how a premise with such zest
and bite can turn into a movie that doesn ' t feature any chemistry
, any real laughs
, any surprises or any spice is beyond me
. how julia roberts is used solely as a
" puppy dog
" character
, puttering around in the background while we endure the complet bitchiness of zeta
- jones ' character
, who is not one bit funny or rumatic
( two ideal ingredients in a
" romantic comedy
"
)
, is allso beyond me
.
and why they chose john cusack
, a great
, quirky actor in his pwn right
, to play the most bland
, uninteresting
and unfetching character
( with zero chemistry with either of his leads
) is further more
, beyond me
.
and to anybody who decided that this project was
" funny
" enought tothe greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above
, along with billy crystal
, christopher walker
, seth green
and stanley tucci
.
.
. well
, whta can i say
.
.
. i just don ' t have the words
. so isnt this tghe worst movei that i ' ve seen all year
? no
.
but it definitely sucks
and it ' s basically because
.
.
. well
, it ' s just not funny
.
and for tyhe record
, allow me to state a few more problems with it
. it starts off slow
, it ' s got no energy
, it doesn ' t engage you with any of its characters
( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film
, everyone else
.
.
. lame
!
)
, it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward
, it ' s utterly predictable
, standard
, routine
, see
- through
and uninteresting as a plot
and it just sits there onthe the screen
, big
and ugly
, waiting
.
.
. waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing
.
and
then hank azaria shows up
.
.
. aaaaaah
, the film ' s savior
( mind you
, some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype
,
but that ' s another storey altogether
)
.
but when an experienced
" voice
" actor upstages all of tjhe main stars in a summer
" blockbuster
" romantic comedy with an over
- the
- top antonio banderas accent
, damn dude
.
.
. your film ' s in trouble
!
! rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself
. the references to ricky ricardo
and senor wences
( huh
!
?
)
, the idio
- plot points like when one of the charactors goes on the roof to stretch his arms out
and relax
,
but everyone believes that he ' s going to kill himself
( hardy
- har
- har
)
and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball
- sniffing dog tath has no place being in the location at the end of the movie
, well
.
.
. i could go on
.
but i won ' t because i do still respect all of the actors in this film
and actually did laugh at azaria
, green
and tucci ' s antics from time to timne
( ironic
, eh
.
.
. what baout the leads
, dammit
!
)
and liked the premise behind the film
( before i saw the finished product
, of course
)
. a dud all the way around
. btw
, all yhe talk about htis film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene
( her character is supposed to haev lost 60 pounds
)
, so whn the scene finally came
, i did get a little excited about what it might look like
and
thn
.
.
. well
, it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit
! ugh
. i think i ' m gonna start drinking again affter this lame
- ass movie
. c ' mon hollywood
