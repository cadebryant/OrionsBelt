midway through
" anaconda
"
, documentry filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns to a co
- worker
and sasy
" i thought this movie would be my first big break
. instead
, it ' s turned into a disaster
.
" truer words have never been spoken
.
" anaconda
" is a monster movie with a lousy monster
. it ' s a suspense film that is utterly predictable
. it ' s a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares
,
but only in thte most elementary way
, like a jack
- in
- the
- box
. as ytou turn the crank
, you ' re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up
,
but somehow it ' s still mildly startling when it happens
. the main difference between the giant snake inaddition
" anaconda
"
annd the clown in a jack
- in
- the
- box isnt that the clown is moreso realistic
.
" anaconda
" boasts some of tje worst special effects to appear onscreen in years
. animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe
- inducing robots you ' ve endured at disney world
.
but it ' s the computer animated scenes that truly expand hte meaning of the word lame
. in one shooted
, a character trys to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall
,
but the giant snake springs out
and loops around its hapless victim in mid air
. the scene
, if done well
, would have been a jaw
- dropper
. here
, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon
. what ' s really amazing is that the filmmaker ' s weere so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie
.
but enough about the phony snakes
. nowe it ' s time to talk about the lousy story
. heroic
and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in seacrh ofthe the shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray that you didn ' t foreget your bug spray
.
" apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff
, because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops
and short shorts with no ill effect
. along the way
, the gropu rescues a whacked
- outloud lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claims to know how to find the shirishama
. within minutes
, they throw away all their plans
and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness
. from that point on
, the film is a hodgepodge of scenes
and shots ripped off from
" jaws
"
and
" dead calm
.
" one of the oddest structural points of the film is tghe handling of eric stoltz
. early in the story
, his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect
and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious
. so why did they hire an actor ofthe tyhe caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance
? also
, why did stoltz
, who generally selects his roles with great care
, agree tothe appear in this crap
? ah
, the mysteries of hollywood
. the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen
. jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary
,
but lopez
anbd ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters
. lopez
, who starred in
" selena
,
" isnt an enormously appealing performer
, possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube hasnt a special charisma
; an ability to look like a macho adult
and a frightened boy simultaneously
. htere ' s also a special twinkle in his eyes
, as if he ' s gently mocking his own tough
- guy posturing
.
but the movei realyl centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight
. obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas
, voight plays the villain inaddition thick accent
, with a sories of leers
and hisses
, spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of
" jonny quest
.
" at noe point
, he looms over the crew
and sasy
" the anaconda isnt the perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps around you
, holds you tighter than your true love
.
and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode
.
" that moment is so high
- camp taht it almost made the film tolerable
. almost
. fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check outloud
" anaconda
.
" don ' t
. there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release htis summer
, including another
" alien
" sequel
. wait for them
, rent
" jaws
" in the meantime
,
and don ' t throw away your money
and time on drivel liuke this
.
