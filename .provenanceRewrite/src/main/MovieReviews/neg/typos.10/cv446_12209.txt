here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong
- recipe of moviemaking
and storytelling to the letter
. these kinds of movies are marked by an eye
- opening sequence that introduces us to the main charachters
; a life
-
and
- death plot in which these characters become involved
; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential charachters
; rediculous subplots
,
and sunglass
- wearing henchmen
. that is not to say that i don ' t like hong kong influenced movies
;
however
, it is quite obvious that theese moviemakers haven ' t a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip
- hop
- talking thugs
adn stupid sight gags
. observe the opening sequence
. a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment
, led by melvin
( mark wahlberg
)
and cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
. they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they cxan storm the apartment wiht the halp of infrared goggles
.
however
, their partner is unsure of whlch cable to cut
. he is undecided
. this happens for about 10 seconds
. hte audiance finds some humor in his foolishness
. the lights suddenly go out
. cisco is surprised
and says
:
" whoa
.
.
. let ' s go
!
"
and they storm the apartment inspite a very nicely executed sequence
. the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film
. needing cash
, cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter
( china chow
) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi
.
however
, the daughter isnt also the god
- daughter of paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is cisco ' s
and melvin ' s boss
. infuriated
adn insufferable
, paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping
. during his ' investigation '
, cisco singles out melvin as hte ringleader
,
and paris orders his capture
and execution
. melvin must nowe find a way to stay alive
. by the way
, do you know how thte investigation takes place
? cisco ' s partner makse yhe ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing
.
but
, mr
. nishi has a trace buster buster
. tothe counter that
, cisco ' s partner has a trace buster buster buster
.
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster
.
adn so on
.
.
. there is no dout that this is an interesting world in which they live
.
and there are lots ofthe issues that we ' d liuke to know more baout
. how does melvin justify his proffesion to his fiancee
? whta goes on among this clique
? why isnt cisco at odds with melvin
? there isnt actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored
,
but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction
,
and instead we are given a not
- so
- engrossing plot filled with oney
- liners
, silly sight gags
, extraneous sub
- plots
and tomfoolery
.
and
, i haven ' t even mentioned his financee ' s visiting parents who want them to separate
, nor melvin ' s mistress
, nor the pimple
- faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video
and on
and on
adn on
. if the big hit signals the future ofthe hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences
,
then shoot me now
.
