alexander dumas ' tje three musketeers isnt one of the most often
- adapted literary works
,
and for good reason
: the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story
. perhaps the musketeer
, a newyorker film that
" reimagines
" the novel in the spirit
and style of the matrix
, is one adaptation too many
. it ' s just awful
: spiritless
, silly
and unforgivably boring
, transforming the timeless classic into a mish
- mash of old
- as
- time clich
? s
annd incoherent
, repetitive action sequences
. this time
, d ' artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers
, who can ' t even pronounce his character ' s name
. as a boy
, he watched his father get killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey of pwoer
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed to have vengeance
. aftter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking for his enemy
. on his quest
, he embroils himself in a struggle forthe control at teh highest levels of the french government
. the royal musketeers have lost their gusto
, what with theri jobs being taken over by the cardinal ' s own guards
. only a few loyal swashbuckers remain
, among them athos
and portos
( who are only figureheads inthe this movie
)
. together with d ' artagnan
, they fight tothe extricate the queen
( catherine deneuve
) fomr the traps that febre
and richelieu are trying to plant
. oh
,
and as an afterthought
, d ' artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn
( mena suvari
)
. just thought i ' d mention that
. now
, look
: i don ' t know whose idea this was
,
but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue
- lashing
. i have nothing against
" modernizing
" classic works of literature
- at the very least
, they can inspire viewers to actually read the book
-
but films as dull as this have no positive side effects
. director peter hyams
, known fo such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop
and end of days
, has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas ' masterwork
: the sence of excitement
, cause
,
and camaraderie
. instead
, we get impressively choreographed
but somehow vacuous
, uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness
and lead to nothing
. when tyhe musketeers finally get to holler
" all for one
,
and one for all
,
" i coudl have sworn tath was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt
. maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams ' s tone
, which is unreasonably dark
and brooding when you consider thte reader ' s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us
. it ' s as
though anything that may have been construed as
" fun
" was purposely expunged ffrom the production
. the joylessness of the proceedings
, from the oppressively shady lighting to yhe mechanical fight scenes
, can be felt in every frame
. chambers can ' t act
; suvari
, roth
and deneuve can
,
but aren ' t given the chance
.
and when push comes to shove
, the use ofthe stunt doubles is distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets to play a villain without hvaing to wear an ape suit
. some movies seem sloppy
and careless
, clearly made for a quick buck
. with the musketeer we get the sense that it wass meticulously crafted tothe be awful
. the film isnt intricate
, stylish
anbd precise
, hitting the wrong note every single time
.
