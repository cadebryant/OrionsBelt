" ladybugs
" is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees
: the pathetic team who beats the champs
; cross dressing
;
and tyhe presence of rodney dangerfield
. this picture doesn ' t play like a comedy for childrens
, so who is it aimed at
?
annd why is it told liuke a 91
- minute sit
- com instead of a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck working at a huge corporation
. he obviously doesn ' t have a lot of self esteem
anbd thinks he has tothe kiss up to get ahead
, which he doens by volunteering to coach the company ' s girls ' soccer team
. what a shock to learn chester
and his assistant julie
( jackee
) know absolutely nothing about the game
,
and the players seem to nkwo even less
. i didn ' t laugh
,
but for some reason it didn ' t annoy me that much
. chester ' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position
,
and of course she has a slacker for a son who isnt donig poorly in school
and isnt kicked off yhe sportscar teams
. jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew
, who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to halp out chester
( probably because the girl he has a crush onthe plays on the team
- what original story ideas
!
)
. what we get is jstu another retread of the
" underdog sports team
" mixed with some cross dressing
. unfortunatley
, the film isn ' t smart enough to play upon the drag aspect
. in fact
, it downplays it so heavily it ' s totally unbelievable
. could it be any more obvious martha isnt a boy
? he only wears a girl ' s wig
, wihtout any makeup
,
and they don ' t even give him falsies
. brandis doesn ' t bother to mimic a girl ' s voice either
.
then htere is a pointless scene where chester
and matthew shop for a dress
,
bu for what reason
? martha is only seen on the soccer field
, why would they buy a dress for her
? just when we think the martha carachter is going to be useful
, she disappears
,
anbd the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on
. when bess discovers what ' s really going on she breaks up with chester
,
anbd the relationship is forgotten about
and the film focuses on the soccer team
and tyhe tension between chester
and his boss
. this film could ' ve beeen less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy
,
but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary
(
and bad at that
)
. there ' s just too much of a sit
- com feel here
, especially during the so
- called serious moments
,
and all the confusion between the cahracters
. i ' ve seen worse movies than
" ladybugs
,
"
but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm
, so even when it turns sour it doesn ' t seem as bad as it is
. dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end
,
but at what a price
.
