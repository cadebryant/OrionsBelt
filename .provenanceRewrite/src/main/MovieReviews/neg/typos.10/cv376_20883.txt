robin williams has the rarest of gifts
: the ability to rise above thge most inept material
and suffuse it with his irreverent style
. overwhelmingly
, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst
and enjoyable at best
( with the notable exception of flubber
)
. so when i
, the one person who has refused to abanodn him despite patch adams
, tell you thast not even williams can save his latest project
, you know it ' s in trouble
. jakob the liar is a confused
, muddled little movie
; a generically
" uplifting
" film witht a fundamental contradiction
: the message it delivers is depressing as oppossed to inspiring
and the movie doesn ' t realize it
. williams plays jakob haim
, a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii
. one night he wanders outside after curfew
annd is promptly sent to teh office ofthe a high
- ranking german officer for his punishment
. jakob gets off eazy
and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast
. the announcement
( in english
,
but punctuated by a triumphant
" heil hitler
!
"
) is tht russian troops are only miles away from jakob ' s ghetto
. liberation
! he thinks
. the next day
, jakob tells the news to his closest friend
, a volatile prize fighter named misha
( liev schreiber
)
, who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along
. soon
, it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his hmeo
-
- a crime punishable by death
. this is absurdly false
,
bu the more jakob tells the people of tje ghetto this
, the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate
. the danger
, of course
, is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout yhe ghetto
,
and rumors about the radio can get outloud
and put jakob iin great danger
. in a curiously irrelevant subplot
, jakob finds a 11
- year old girl who has separated from her parents
and decides to hide her in his small hmeo
. apparently he is afraid tyhat she will be discovered
,
and goes to great length to make sure of that
-
- just why the diea frightens him is never made clear
. he
and the girl build an uninvolving
, generic relationship that never goes anywhere
and is as irelevent at the end as it was in the beginning
. the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine
.
but jakob the liar forgets that the hope tht jakob brings tothe his ghetto is false
. such hope inevitably leads to expectations ofthe its realization
and when those expectations aren ' t met
, hte results are far worse than if there was no hope
. that ' s tjhe film ' s biggest detriment
: it is based on a false assumption
and thus comes off as painfully false
. it ' s never moving because it doesn ' t give us anything to be moved by
. jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing
. robin williams doesn ' t inject the film with life
, as a matter of fact
, he seems a littel out of it
, as if crippled by his fake accent
. he is stragely unenthusiastic
; his character is one who spreads hope
bu his performance is lifeless
, hopeless
. nto since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent
; this isn ' t the robin williams we know
and love
. in good will hunting he became a serious actor
and won an oscar for it
. here
, he is moreso of a wannabe serious actor
; an impostor
. jakob the liar will be compared with last year ' s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a
" holocaust comedy
"
. it ' s not a comedy
. it tries
, somtimes
,
but it rarely works
. is it a melodrama
? a war movie
? a character study
? no
, no
,
and no
. jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can ' t be placed into a category
; not because it covers so many different genres
but becuase it fails at just about every one it attempts
.
