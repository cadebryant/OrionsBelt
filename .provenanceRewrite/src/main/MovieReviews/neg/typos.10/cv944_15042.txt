" it was not scary
.
" these are the first words that came to mind after it was over
. when a movie is called
_ vampires
_
,
" not scary
" aren ' t words that should be associated with it
.
but that wasn ' t my only gripe
. john carpenter is a name assoicated with cutting
- edge cinema
, as inwhich the intense scares of
_ halloween
_
,
_ the thnig
_
and
_ the prince of darkness
_
, or the offbeat action of
_ they live
_
annd
_ escape from new york
_
. unfortunately
, the onyl thing that is cutting edge about
_ vampires
_ is the level of boredom the movei is able to reach
. with an anemic plot
annd not
- qutie
- kosher special effects
,
_ john carpenter ' s vampires
_ has barely anough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan
. the film is at first concerned with a group ofthe roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, of all people
. liek some sort ofthe holy a
- team
( they even have their own souped
- up van
)
, the bunch invade
anbd wipe outloud a nest of vampires iin a new mexico shack
. their method is amusingly innovative
: the blood
- suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks
. to commemorate their victory
, the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers
and parties the night away
. their celebration is short
- lived
,
however
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes
and single
- handedly destroys most of the team
. woods ' jack crow
and buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) escape whith their lives
, allong whith a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
.
although the woman has beeen bitten
, montoya
and crow decide to keep katrina forthe her psychic link to the master vampire
. the rest of the movie is conserned with the boys ' hunt for valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- type who ' s on a mission that dates back 600 years
. along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a character who serves preety much the same purpose as the jittery cpl
. upham inaddition
_ saveing private ryan
_
. some stuff happens in teh middle of the movie
,
but i can ' t remember most of it
, because i oftenly found a twitching hair infront the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen
.
_ vampires
_ finally starts to pik up about 90 minutes into the mix
, as crow
, guiteau
,
and montoya assault an abandoned prison
- turned vampire nest
. only
thn does the film begin to even ressemble a carpenter flick
.
but it ' s too little too late
. we get the inevitable fianl confrontation
,
but it seems tacked on
and rather anti
- climactic
( come on
, we ' re dealing with
_ the
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, last summer ' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ was derived from a comic book
,
and
_ vampires
_ from a novel
,
yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former
, a more deliberate superhero flick
. woods ' jack crow spouts glib off
- the
- cuff one
- liners
and strolls away from exploding buildings with thast oh
- so
- cool stride
.
and his motive for killing vampires
? take a wild guess
.
( hint
: a
_
_
_
_
_
_ killed his
_
_
_
_
_ when he wass just a
_
_
_
_
_
.
) at least
_ blade
_ had decent action
and slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. to amking uv for thsi
, the movie resorts to other
" shocks
,
" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women
( crow slaps them around for the fun of it
)
and an overplayed contempt for religion
( crowm teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to
" getting woodies
.
"
) it can be argued that maybe i wnated too much from this movie
. if not scary
and gory
, i wanted tense
, relentless
,
and exhausting
.
_ john carpenter ' s vampires
_ is none of these
. i can only reccommended it fo the hardcore carpenter fan
. for the rest of you looking for a good scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ is a film with no teeth
.
