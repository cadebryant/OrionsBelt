disconnect tyhe phone line
. don ' t accept the charges
. do anything you can to avoid the wretched
, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy
` hanging up '
. i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side
,
anbd
` hanging up ' seemed liek an ideal opportunity to do so
. the film features an incredible palate of female talent
,
and the caperbility behind the camera broght to mind such sparkling gems as
` sleepless in seattle '
and
` unsung heroes '
. meg ryan
, diane keaton
and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who
, once separated by career judgments over family ties
, must reunite when their father
( walter matthau
) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer ' s disease
. while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship
and reflect with poignancy on the past
, the script by sisters delia
and nora ephron is exasperating
, shapeless dreck teeming wih emotional fakery
.
` hanging up ' has the overall effect of a tele
- marketer pestering you for two hours
, while you don ' t have hte option of doing as thte title suggests
. for the first half
- hour
, the ephron sisters uise telephone conversations forthe a basis of character development
. this is an annoying
and ineffective device
. cell
- phones ring every five mintues
,
and everyone hurriedly rushes along
, leaving marginal time fo the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters ' issues
and problems
. if
` hanging up ' was an apple pie
,
thne i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story
. granted
, there are a few genuine
and sincere moments in the film
.
but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing
but inferior dramatic muck
. the most outrageous strategy in
` hanging up ' is that
, after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development
, we are expected to exhibit compassion
and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale
. we are able to identify with eve
( ryan
)
, the most open
and caring daughter
, because she is the one who stayed by her father ' s side as everyone else moved forward tothe pursue a impending career
. georgia
( keaton
)
, the eldest daughter
, is celebrating the fifth yera annievrsary of her magazine called
.
.
.
.
` georgia '
. maddy
( kudrow
)
, the soap opera actress
, spends time either contemplating her possable path tothe stardom or nursing her dog
. ryan ' s convincing performance
adn diverting cuteness are two of tghe more agreeable aspects of
` hanging up '
. kudrow
, so delightfully eccentric as the off
- kilter airhead phoebe in
` friends '
, is totally wasted
. ditto fo keaton
, who is serving a double shift as co
- star
and director
- a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle
. her frenzy is apparent
. for a chick flick
, there is a distressing lack of chuckles
. the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that
, given his character ' s situation
, seems more depressing than amusing
. even so
, tghe peak form of humor in
` hanging up ' is represented by some of matthau ' s nasty quips
and ryan ' s eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill
. that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film
. my curiocity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising
and star
- studded approach could turn so viciously sour
.
but really
, it ' s no mystery
. the predictable
, melodramatic filth that is
` hanging up ' is certainly not the fault of these actresses
. pin it on the screenplay
, which attemts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes
, while spending the rest of the running tyme in an annoying flurry of phone conversations
. it ' s certainly a far cry from what one owudl label as a rewarding experience
,
but
` hanging up ' should hvae at least been enjoyable
. uh
- uh
. it ' s a wrong number from the beginning
.
