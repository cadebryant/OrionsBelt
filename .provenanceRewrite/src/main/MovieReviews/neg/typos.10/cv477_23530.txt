the premise ofthe the new james wong film
, final destination
, is thgat alex browning
, the protagonist
, prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane
, thereby cheating fate
.
however
, fate is nto so easily bested
,
and alex ' s friends soon begin dying inthe unusual circumstances
. essentially
, this premise is a clever
- way to make a slasher
- flick without tjhe slasher
. unfortunatley
, htis is practically the only clever thing about the film
. as far as teen horror flicks go
, fianl destination is better tahn many
. there is enough shocking death
, graphic gore
,
and requisite black humer to provide the essential
" roller coaster
" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick
. unfortunately
, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre
. the relationships between the main characters are tenuous
and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse tothe set
- up the next death
. the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary
and dramatic
but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed
. if you are looking forthe a saturday inght thriller to scare your date
, this film might do the trick
. other than that
, wait until it goes into hevy
- rotation on cable
.
