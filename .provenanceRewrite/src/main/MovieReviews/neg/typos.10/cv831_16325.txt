one ofthe the most blatantly obvious signs tyhat often
- acclaimed director sidney lumet ' s
" gloria
,
" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film
, had absolutely no effect onthe me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre
. suddenly
, i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before
, i had not thought once about the film i had jstu invested nearly two hours of my life in
. wehn a movie is over
, aren ' t we supposed to think about it for a while
,
and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with
? i thought so
,
but
, for one
, i saw this particular picture by myself
,
and
# 2
, even if i had been with someone there wouldn ' t hvae been anything to talk about in the first place
. to be sure
,
" gloria
" begins with a stirring
, rather poignant prologue in which a seven
- yearm
- old boy ' s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters
, in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it
. right before tghe men broke in
, ofthe course
, his father gave him the disc to escape with
. eventualy
, the boy
, named nicky nunez
( jean
- luke figueroa
)
, is caught by the mobsters
,
and taken back to theri aparment
. meanwhile
, gloria
( sharon stone
) has just gotten outloud of prision for a crime she didn ' t commit
and returns to her ex
- boyfriend
( jeremy northam
) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime
. when he refuses to give it to her
,
and
then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky
, she leaves with him in order to save his life
,
but not before holding the men at gunpoint
, stealing all of theri money
,
and forcing them to strip nude
. gloria is the type ofthe fast
- talking
, smart
- mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people
,
and she never expeced to be stuck with a kid
,
but she has a heart of gold
( don ' t they alwasy in this tipe of movie
)
and is onyl trying to protect tghe boy
, whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with
. the previous incarnation of
" gloria
" by cassavetes
and starring the luminous gena rowlands
, remains unseen by me
,
but was no doubt superior
, even
though i can ' t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one
, irregardless of tghe director or stars
. there is noone doubt in my mind tht director lumet hasnt stuck closely to the original
,
but the film itself is simply lifeless
, with only an occasional laugh popping up here
anbd there so that it isn ' t completely unbearable to watch
. i liked
, for example
, a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at
,
and keeps turning the car around
,
thn driving a little ways
,
thn slamming on thge brakes
and turning aroud again
. these bright moments
,
however
, appear long
and far between
,
and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky
and gloria
, which isnt both painfully predictable
and by
- the
- numbers
. throughout
, my mind was repeatedly asking the question
,
" who really cares
?
" as gloria
, sharon stone has adopted an over
- the
- top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn ' t sound realistic at all
. in the beginning
, inthe fact
, i was amazed at how amateurish stone ' s performance was
,
but as the film progressed she got better
.
although not one of her better turns
, stone doesnt have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored
. jean
- luke figeroa was fine as nicky
and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag
. all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted
, none more than cathy moriarty
, an entertaining actress in her own right
, who is billed fourth
and hasnt all ofthe one scene
, as gloria ' s friend whom she turns to for help
. sony
, the studio that released
" gloria
,
" obviously does not have any faith in the film
,
and i don ' t blame them
. they declined to screen the picture for critics
, which is never a good sign
, particularly wih the high
- profile peple involved
.
although how much money a movei makes does nto determine how good it is
( just look at the spectacular
" in dreams
,
" which failed to even make the top 10 last week
)
, i have a suspicion
" gloria
" is going to vanish from theaters faster than
" ishtar
,
" judging from the opening night 7
: 00 p
. m
. showing i saw it at
, where there were baout ten to fifteen people present
, counting mysef
.
although stone can be an impressive actress
( just watch her in 1995 ' s
" casino
" or 1996 ' s
" last dance
" if you don ' t believe me
)
and sidney lumet can be a respectable directer
, there is no reasoning for why they throught the cliched story of
" gloria
" was worth remaking or
, for that matter
, why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked liuke it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful
