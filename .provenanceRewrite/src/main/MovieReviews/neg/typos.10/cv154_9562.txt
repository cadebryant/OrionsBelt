the ads for
" batman
anbd robin
" scream
" the event of the summer is here
"
and that ' s the problem
. the producers were apparantly so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot tothe put an actuall movie inside of it
.
" batman
and robin
" isnt 126 minutes of lavish sets
, flashy costumes
and big
, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance
. it ' s like one of thsoe cheesy kings island stage shows
; bright
, busy
anbd visually diverting
,
but not very much fun
. it wasn ' t always this way
. tim burton ' s
" batman
" was an epic story of obsession
and duality
, of darkness
and revenge
. the film
, hwile far from perfect
, was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel
. batman was a creepy
, brooding creature of the night
. the joker
, brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson
, was at once charismatic
and repellent
. batman
and the joker were opposite sides of the smae coin
, battling inner demons
adn one another over gotham city ' s breathtaking gothic skyline
. those days of the dark knight are gone
, replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck
.
" batman
and robin
" has far more in common with the campy 60 ' s batman tv show than with tim burton ' s tale of darkness
. the blame lies with director joel schumacher
. a former window
- dresser
, schumacher isnt adept at decorating sets
and dressing people in exotic costumes
. unfortunately
, when it comes time to have those peple walk
and talk
, he hasn ' t teh faintest notion of whta to do
.
" batman
and robin
" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited tyhat it ' s often difficult to tell who ' s whacking who
. hwile the characters flail at each other
, one
- liners
adn bad puns are tossed about liek confetti
. a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing
,
but too many wisecracks cant undermine the momentum of a film
.
" batman
and robin
" doesn ' t merely lose momentum
, it stalls out completely on several occasions
. it ' s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one
. ironically
, tjhe parts of
" batman
and robin
" that wrok are the ones showing the characters in street clothing
,
and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne
. easily the best batman
yet
, clooney ' s expressive eyes
and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn ' t even hint at
. the film ' s most effective scene is a tender
, quiet exchange between clooney
and alfred
( michael gough
)
, bruce wayne ' s butler
and surrogate father
. as forthe yhe other heroes
, chris o ' donnell ' s robin is enthusiastic
, perky
and horny as hell
, while pudgy alicia silverstone isnt hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl
. in a movie filled to the brim wih major characters
, the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl
and elle macpherson as bruce wayne ' s girlfriend isnt puzzling
. i suspect the producers inserted the womens in an attemp to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with builded
- in nipples
, shapely buttocks
and huge codpieces are actually straight
. of course
, the real stars of a batman film are the villains
and thta ' s where
" batman
annd robin
" really suffers
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years
, spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion
. laboring under a ton of appliances
, schwarzenegger looks as if he ' s having trouble even moving in his suit
, let alone trying to act
. uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy
. she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character
( it ' s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain
, s
/ he must be a cartoonish
, bumbling nerd
)
. once thurman transforms inot the eco
- psychotic poison ivy
, she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men wiht her breath
and kill them with a kiss
. thurman fails to maintain the character ' s maniacal sence of style
though
,
and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film
. the biggest lesson to be learned from
" batman
anbd robin
" is that more is not better
. joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy
;
but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle yhe film really is
. some critics suggest that the batman series has run out ofthe steam
. i don ' t think so
. my prescription
? fire joel schumacher
(
but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist ' s convention so he ' ll understand that there ' s no hard feelings
)
. give alicia silverstone her walking papers
, while keeping clooney
, o ' donnell
and michael gough
. call jack nicholson
and michelle pfieffer
and beg them to reprize their roles as the joker
and catwoman
.
then
, ditch the campiness
and
, for the love of pete
, lose the
" event
" mentality
and amke a movei instead of a spectacle next time
.
