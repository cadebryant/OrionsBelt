" there will be anyother
,
" the ads for this sequel proclaimed
,
and why not
? true
, brandon lee is dead
,
bu there owudl be noone reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 ' s the crow
, anyway
. the idea of spinning artist james o ' barr ' s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie
, taking its own righteous avengence against the world
. given that basic framework
, the story could move inaddition any number of directions
. of course
, it doesn ' t
. stubbornly
, the crow
: city of angels backtracks tothe the beginning of the previvous film
, when lee ' s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave tothe do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him
and his girlfriend to death
. i remember the frist film primarily as a harrowing excercise in brutality
. in flashback
, we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric
and his lover
,
and
then we watch in rela
- time as eric pays each perpetrator back infront kind
. it ' s loud
and repetitive
, true
, a sadist ' s delight
-
-
but it ' s also horrifing
and fascinating
. city ofthe angels gives us more of hte same
,
but less skillfully
. there ' s an audiance guaranteed for a film like this
,
although bad reviews
and poor word
- of
- mouth will likely ensure that it won ' t be much of a success
. in fact
, miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings
.
( i ' ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic
, since good notices have never been key tothe the success of movies like the crow
.
) so much for any confidence inspite the worthiness of thier followup
. this tyme
, ashe
( french
- accented actor vincent perez
) is retrieved from his watery death
( he
and his young son were shackled together
, shot
,
and
then thrown off a pier
) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living
and the dead
. perez might have some screen presence if he ' s given something tothe dont with himself
,
but here he ' s simply thrown in front of thte camera as a pretty face
. at first
, he ' s shivery
and frightened
,
but he quicklyu recovers from the shock of his own death
and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave
. he ' s befriended by sarah
( mia kirshner
)
, presumably an older version of thge child who narrated the first film
. kirshner
, so beguiling in exotica
, is here an exquisitely photographed blank
. tattooed with angels ' wings
, sarah is just about as lovely as women come
,
but she serves no purpose
, not even as seductress
. the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah
( richard brooks
)
,
but a far more interesting choise as leader would have been iggy pop
, who plays a gaunt fellow named curve
. iggy
, all bones
, veins
,
and drawl
, is the only oen who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film
. like all good things here
, he ' s dispatched too soon
and wihtout much imagination
. in the meantime
, we ' re subjected tothe tedious glimpses ofthe judah ' s compound
, where bondage is the order of the day
and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s
& m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren ' t distinctly secondhand
. even the soundtrack is tired
. mroe than anything i ' ve seen from hollywood latley
, city ofthe angels smacks baldly of product
-
- it ' s a movei with a lousy script
but a great look
. criticists have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope
,
but his work isn ' t that bad per se
. he ' s got a good eye
,
and some intriguing visual idesa
-
- if anything
, this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery
. his major stylistic failing is that he can ' t seem to direct an action scene
,
and the quick
, nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie
.
but as director
, he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn ' t
, the performers who couldn ' t
,
and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts ofthe everyone involved
. who bought david s
. goyer ' s anemic scirpt
, anyway
? the producers of this crow weere either too dim tothe realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash
, or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference
.
