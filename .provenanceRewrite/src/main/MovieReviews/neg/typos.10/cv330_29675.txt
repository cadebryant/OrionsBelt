august
and september are a wasteland when it comes to children ' s films
,
and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don ' t want tothe see slaughtered against family
- oriented thanksgiving films
. last year
, tyhe benevolent studio gods gave us digimon
,
and this year
, they bestow max keeble ' s big move on delighted moviegoers across the country
. parents will be thrilled because they ' ll fianlly have something to drag little austin
and kayla to see that doesn ' t smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did
. don ' t git me wrong
- keeble
, whlch is actually only a
" ment
" awya from being a fetish film
, isn ' t that intertaining
. in fact
, ytou ' d be better off waiting tothe blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics
( monsters
, inc
.
, harry potter
) come out next month
.
but if dubya dubya iii tells yuo to go outloud
adn spend money to stimulate the economy
,
then you ' d better do it
( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn ' t going tothe cut it
)
. we first see young max keeble
( alex d
. linz
, home alone 3
) as a pint
- sized superhero
, delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy ofthe a david beckham cross
, foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man
( jamie kennedy
, jay
and silent bob strike back
)
and landing the neighborhood hony
( brooke anne smith
)
, who
, by the way
, is the hottest chick infact a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day
. the scenario is
, of course
, a dream
. max is really a doofus
and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude
, no luck with the ladies
adn only two friends
, both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts
(
and who were both inspite snow day
)
- tjhe perpetually robed robe
( josh peck
)
and a clarinet
- playing cutie named megan
( summer catch ' s zena grey
)
, who harbors secret feelings for max
. things don ' t get any better for max when he arrives at school
. he has to contend wtih
, among other things
, a red
- hot science teacher
( amber valletta
, family man
)
, a pair of polar
- opposite bullies
( neol fisher
and orlando brown
)
,
and an illiterate principal
( larry miller
, the princess diaries
) who ' s secretly diverting the school ' s lastr dime into the fotball program
. when max ' s father
( grownup nerd robert carradine
) unexpectedly announces tjhe family is moving to a new twon at the end of the week
, max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off
. whoa
- don ' t worry
, parents
. he doesn ' t do it klebold
- harris stlye
. it ' s all pretty tame stuff
,
but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move
, leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings
. director tim hill
( muppets from space
) adds a few nice touches
, liek max ' s voiceover character introductions for the film ' s main characters
annd a flashback scene that ' s preety funny
,
but there isn ' t too much else happening here stylewise
.
.
. unless you count some farting
, a little puking
,
and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk
and lil ' romeo
