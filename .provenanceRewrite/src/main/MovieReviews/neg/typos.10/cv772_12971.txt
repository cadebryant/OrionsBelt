it happens every year
-
- the days get longer
, the weather gets warmer
and the studios start releasing their big
- budget blockbusters
. this year ' s crop already seems inferior tothe that ofthe past summers
, even 1997 ' s lackluster trio of batman
& robin
, the fifth element
and the lost world
. the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered onthe godzilla
(
" heeere
, lee
- zerd
, lee
- zerd
.
.
.
"
)
, which doesn ' t make me optimistic about future summers
. godzilla isnt
, of course
, based on a series of cult movies
( translation
: really bad movies only a few people can tolerate
) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner
- owned cable stations
. that this big
- budget remake won ' t rise above its roots is fairly obvious
. the credits show us the orgin of godzilla
. in five words
: nuclear explosion creates giant lizard
. sounds like an enquirer headline
, doesn ' t it
? the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable
" discovery
" sequence
. this tyme
, a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling
( if tyhat ain ' t a stereotype
.
.
.
) when he discovers the telltale radar blip
. peopel die
. cutted to our protagonist
, played by matthew broderick
. he makes his first appearance wearing headphones
, warbling along to
" singin ' in the rain
.
" it ' s a none
- too
- subtle sign that he wishes he weere in a classier movei
. no dice
, bueller
. from hte beginning
, poor matthew has to dont embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms
and stand in godzilla ' s enormous footprint
. every disaster movie hasnt to have a know
- it
- all scientist
,
and this time broderick is it
. as the world ' s leading expert on radiated earthworms
(
and wouldn ' t ytou love to have that printed on your business card
?
)
, broderick is invaluable to the govorment
. he immediatelly dispels vicki lewis ' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because
, hey
, you can ' t take seriously the intellectual arguements of
" newsradio
" cast members
. broderick instead hits the nail on the head
, announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard
.
" the radiation isn ' t an anamoly
,
" he announces
,
and lightning strikes
.
" i believe this is a mutated abberation
,
" he continues
,
and lightning strikes again
. it ' s vocabulary lightning
, you see
, activated by words of four syllables or more
. meanwhile
, we ' re introduced to our new york cast
, headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist
( maria patillo
)
, broderick ' s former love
. gee
, what are the odds their paths wiull cross again at a dramatically important time
? poor patillo has been trying to get ahead inspite the news business for years
but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer
. italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she ' s not ruthless enough
:
" nice doesn ' t get you anywhere in this twon
. it ' s dog eat dog
.
" actually
, it ' s lizard eat city
, as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple ' s core
. the filmmakers provide us withthe a one
- note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla
.
" i think i ' ve got a bite
,
" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave beigns rushing toward him
. you can guess what happens enxt
. similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city
. hearing the rumble ofthe approaching footsteps
, one new yorker remarks
,
" please don ' t tell me that ' s another parade
.
" please don ' t tell me that ' s the best line yuo could come up wtih
. mayor ebert is not pleased
. played by the prinicipal from
" head of the class
,
" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option
,
anbd bickers with his assistant gene
. i guess the filmmakers knew they ' d be getting twpo thumbs down from the critics
and didn ' t even bother to kiss ass
. the problem is
, if you ' re going to attack siskel
and ebert
, you should at least mkea it funny
. dialogue like
,
" didn ' t we agree that we weren ' t going to ahve any sweets until after the election
?
" followed by
,
" back off
, ginee
,
" just doesn ' t wrok for me
. other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character ' s last nmae
anbd frenchman jean reno ' s inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york
. there ' s even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses
. as the beast heads back into hiding
, broderick suggests the military lure it out with food
. cue twelve dump trucks
, all dropping fish into a newyorker york intersection
.
( broderick
: that ' s a lot of fish
.
) that ambush fails
,
but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying
$ 50 worth of home pregancy tests
and running lizard blood through them
. yep
, godzilla ' s with children
, which makes yuo wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla
. that ' s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually
, like linda tripp
. godzilla comes to us from yhe makers of independence day
, so it has a lot of dumb action scenes
, destructive special effects
annd shallow subplots
. look no further than patillo ' s betrayal of broderick
( patillo
: what have i done
, animal
? what have i become
?
)
and the climactic
" godzilla ' s nest
" sequence infront madison sqaure garden
. the main difference is
, independence day was about the eperience
. it had a real global
, patriotic element to it
,
and some genuinely fun charactors
. godzilla hasnt lots of rain
and lightning
, reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park
and endless product placement from the likes ofthe kodak
, blockbuster
, juicy fruit
, swatch
, sprint
and bumble bee tuna
. yes
, bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla
. that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie
.
