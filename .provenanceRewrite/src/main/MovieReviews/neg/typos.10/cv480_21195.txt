as any reasonable human being would
, i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things
. i am befuddled by fight club
. now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics
and do not achieve critical success until much later
, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later
. perhaps it is because these films are way ahead ofthe theri time
. perhaps it isnt because they are so new
and complex that only affter years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate
and understand them
. fight club is eather garbage or brilliant
,
but
, at least right nowe
, i must lean toward tyhe former
. maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold
.
but if it is
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a feild examiner for a major automobile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to
? complet
? himself
, make him a loser at the game of life
.
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window
, he seeks comfort in a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met on a flight home
. once jack is sucked into tyler
? s world
, he can
? t get out
, literally
. they begin fight club
, an organiztion based on brutal
and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging
. as yhe fight club grows
, things get out of controll
and take on cult status
, beginning with one future solider who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler
? s house for three days
. i dare nto even begin to bring up the last quater of tjhe film
, since thgat contains the twist that
? explains
? the pointless journey
. suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher
, who
? s previous two films
, se7en
and thte gaem put him in a very slim categoyr of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation
. this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table
.
but with fight club
, he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments
and self
- referencing film elements
, such as talking to teh audience about what they are seeing
, telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels
and that a slightly altered recurring line isnt good
? flashback humor
?
. nowe
, throughout the film
? s coarsely woven texture
and over
- extended plot lines
, fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments baout the state of the world today
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, corporations
, you name it
, it
? s addressed
.
(
though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced
.
) all of them play an important role
. how so
? well
, i can kinda jstu tell
. i can
? t really put my finger on it
. to say that starbucks
and barnes
& noble are taking over their respective markets
and kicking out the small business owner is no big news
. is that bad for the world
? probably
. not much room for social commentary there
. we all know that inter
- office politics are just thgat
.
.
. politics
. so wqat was the point of all this
? the film seems desperate to make a point
, or a number of points
,
but i couldn
? t figure out what they were
. all i saw was a very bizzare social satire that ws woven with strange film techniques
, a bleak visual design
and some fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all of them are ogod
. even meatloaf is good
.
) when you get tothe the end
, you iwll most likely be filled wtih questions
, many of which tghe filmmakers wanted you to ask ofthe yourself
. not them
, because eahc of them owudl likely give you a different answer
. fight club means what you wnat it to mean
, i think fincher jsut gives you the stuff to think about
.
but it couldn
? t be more bizarre
and unappealing
. sure
, it had shock value
,
but so did se7en
and the game
,
and they weere significantly stronger films
.
