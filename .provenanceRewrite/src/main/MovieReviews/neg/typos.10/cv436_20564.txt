chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception
: instead of a speeding bus
, we now have an ice cream truck
. the truck is driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
)
anbd mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder
. this particular weapon
( nicknamed
` elvis '
) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees
, or else the shockwave will goo
- iffy everything in a mile radius
. that would be pretty nasty
. the power of elvis is revealed infact the opening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island
. long accidentally melts 18 soldiers
and defoliates virtually the entire island
, due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance
. the commanding officer
, general brynner
( peter firth
)
, isnt sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops
. upon his release
, the general isnt intent on tracking the ogod doctor down
, snatching elvis
,
and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder
. protecting tyhe fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
)
annd a feisty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner ' s men
and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder
. all the while
, of course
, they must keep the weppon below 50 degrees
. this proves tothe be tricky
. among the wild adventures arlo
and mason partake in is a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside in a boat
,
adn a fist fight onthe top of a moving veicle
. they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are suppossed to find amusing
. to put it simply
, i ' ll use a clever pun
: chill factor should be put on ice
. director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed
, broken arrow
and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland coctail of a chase movie
. when there is some occasional acation
, tje audience seems oddly detatched from it
. perhaps that ' s because we ' ve already waded thru a pool of clich
? s
and boring dialogue
; all material that ' s been used before
,
and with a lot more spice
. take the villains
, for example
. they are typical sterotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen
. they speak lines that ahev been recycled profusely from one movie to thge next
, divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint
,
and act in very predictable ways
. the tag
- team of gooding jr
.
and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is
. frankly
, i ' m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it ' s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner
. gooding displays one single emotion inaddition this movie
, which is frequentily onthe display in lines like
` i ' m gonna get onthe yo ass like last year ' s underwear
! '
and the incessant sputtering of
` oh
, sh
* t
! ' this is virtually the same character he plyed in jerry maguire
and as good as it gets
.
but where gooding ws once an exicting actor
, he now seems dull
and endlessly monotonous
. at least he ' s a bit more captivating than ulrich
, who has all thte film ' s worst dialogue
,
but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character
. tghe supporting cast
, which includes every personality you expect to pop up
, isnt also wasted
. to be fair
, there are a few brief moments of serviceable action
.
and i did chuckle a few times
. one example is when ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene ' s diner '
) is at tjhe counter when brynner walks through the door
.
` you own this place
? ' the general asks
.
` yeah
, ' ulrich says
.
` they call me darlene
. ' these little tidbits ofthe humor are
( mainly
) welcome in this weak
, disappointing wreckage of an action film
. as a speed clone
, it could have benefited from a lot moreso suspense
and perhaps
( god forbid
) even some decent writing
. sadly
, i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been
.
