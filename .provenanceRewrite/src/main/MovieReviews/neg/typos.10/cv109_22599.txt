nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre

" frankenweenie

" beetlejuice

" batman
,
"
" edward scissorhands

yet none of them have beeen horror films
.
" sleepy hollow
" is his first attempt to actually scare people
. i greeted the prospect with high anticipation
; burton ' s whole career seemed to be leading uv to this
. i left dissappointed
. andrew kevin walker ' s screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story
" the legend of sleepy hollow
.
" in the movie ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is a new york city police constable who is trying to inctroduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors
. ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders
. several of the town ' s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman
.
although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him
, ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning
. he also discovers that the killings are not random
, that the victims are tied together by a secret
. along the way ichabod gets halp from a bewitching
( literally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
and the son of one ofthe the murder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to mkea it interesting
. that in itself is forgivable
; hollywood constantly tries tothe sell us used products in new packages
.
however
, burton ' s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy
. it might be his background
-
- in his previous movies
, goofy wass the goal
. allong the same lines
, it doesn ' t help that creature designer
(
and producer
) kevin yagher hasnt done his best work for the tongue
- in
- cheek tales fomr the crypt tv series
. a witch ' s eyes
and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit ' s
, a tree spurts blood like it ' s in a monty python sketch
,
and the headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he ' s a guy wihtout a head
.
.
. on a horse
( boo
!
)
. yhe performances are also awful
.
although he ' s empressed me with his work in other films
, depp doesn ' t seem to know what to do witht ichabod
,
and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that ' s supposed to pass for an 18th century accent
. ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic
, which gaurentees that we won ' t sympathize with her character
. the actor who is revealed at tje end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. the only blessure generated by tje cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee
, martin landau
,
and christopher walken
. i wonder if this movei was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola ' s projected series of gothic adaptations
, a series that produced only
" bram stoker ' s dracula
"
annd
" mary shelley ' s frankenstein
.
" coppola isnt an executive producer for
" sleepy hollow
,
"
and the scirpt reflects his interest in early forms of
" moving picturesk
,
" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion
.
( there ' s a bird on one side of the card
, a cage on the other
. when the card is flipped rapidly
, the bird appears to be caged
.
) bottom line
: the hollow isn ' t the only hting that ' s sleepy
.
