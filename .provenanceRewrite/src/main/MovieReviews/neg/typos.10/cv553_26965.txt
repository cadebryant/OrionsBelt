" have you ever heared the noe about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of tyhe theatre screaming
?
" obviously tghe producers at columbia tristar doed not think that we suffered enough from the first installment
,
and so to finish us utterly
, they have now released
" urban legends
: fianl cut
"
. this is another
" scream
"
- like feature
, consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip
- offs from the most pointless movies of all time
. amy
( jennifer morrison
) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to dont
.
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigeous university ' s film program
-
- where each year ' s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize
, a virtual one
- way ticket to hollywood success
-
- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese
( loretta devine
)
, whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines
. soon enough
, fake
-
-
adn real
-
- blood starts tothe flow
,
and amy is being chased around by scary killer
, while her cast
and crew get slain
, one by one
. is the culprit the original urban legends murderer
, just some random psycho
,
! a member of tghe faculty
, one of her competitors for the hitchcock
, or is there something even more stupid going on
? this is another one of those tiring
, pointless teen slasher flicks
: neither scary
, funny
, or interesting
. it simply lacks teh ability
and the story to entertain
. the body counts
and screams continue to grow
, as hte weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly
. in fact watching films liek that after having watched
" scary movie
" isnt impossible keeping a serious face
. several times i tried tothe prevent myself from laughing
, without succeeding
.
and
then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing
. it ' s the same thing that has been told
and told
and told over
and over again as if it was the revelation of the centruy
. how many times must we tolerate the same clich
? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth
? it has been so many films about masked killers that most ofthe us have developed an allergy forthe them
. they are the most stupid
, meaningless
, predictable
annd soulless films in existence
.
however
, director john ottman manages to make
" urban legends
: fianl cut
" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre
. what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures
annd irony in
" scream
"
, ottman takes seriously
. for that reason alone
, it is worth a look
, just to realize how bad a movie can be
. it ' s tough to find comparisons for such an achievment
,
and we have to dig inthe ancient history to fidn a movie that would match its intellect
. even movies like
" lost inaddition space
"
adn
" mission to mars
" seem spectacular in its shadow
. we have nto seen such waste of t
! ime
and resources since
" showgirls
"
( 1995
)
. no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production
, i came up witht nothing
, except the way the killer was dressed
. here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker
and marie
- sylvie deveu
, taht have wisely replaced the well known scream
- mask with a very elegant fencing mask
. jennifer morrison
(
" stir of echoes
"
) is all right
,
and the other actors ' best achivement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script
. inthe fact teh onyl thnig that is terrifying about this film
( with the exception of its screenplay
) is its portray of film schools
. if these graduates will be tyhe directors of the future
,
then hollywood ' s golden days are over
. rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment
. let ' s just hope
and pray that it ' s just an urban legend
.
