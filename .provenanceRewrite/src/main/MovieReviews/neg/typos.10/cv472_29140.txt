it ' s almost amusing to watch 21
- year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter ' s followup
- up to 1997 ' s the tango lesson
, the man who cried
. tghe gen
- y actress
, with her cold stare
and big
, black eyes
, has appeared in an impressive range of films
;
but she doesn ' t even come close to being the bold heroine the film
, set against the historical backdrop ofthe world war 2
, requires her to be
. ricci
, whose character is shockingly silent
and blank
, showing only the occassional smile or hint of concern
, shares most ofthe her scenes witht the astounding cate blanchett
: quite an amusing sighth to behold
. blanchett ' s lola
, a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie
, is bold
, interesting
and layered
? everything our heroine lacks
. co
- star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy
, blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci
, sports twice the makeup
and dons a flashy wardrobe
. the actress inhabits the role
? as she always so remarkably does
? with a fervor
and life that makes you wanna her to hold the screen as the film ' s lead rather than her dull companion
. important historical events involving hitler
and his nazis scatter themselfs across the film
; these landmarks serve as the film ' s little conflict
. obviously
, the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events
, whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian collegues
. the man who cried hasnt many aspirations
, none of which come full circle by the film ' s close
. there are forced messages here
and there
:
" go forward
; always go forward
,
" lola preaches to suzie
; there ' s romance between suzie
and a fellow target ofthe hitler ' s nazis
, the gypsy cesar
( johnny depp
, who
, like ricci
, barely gets to speak
)
; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth
and men who have it
;
and at the core ofthe all these devices lies suzie ' s desire to travel to america
, where her father journeyed affter leaving her
and her mother years ago
. the film ' s main problem is that potter isn ' t skilled enough to tell the epic
- sized story of suzie
. the time period ' s instability
, the conflicting social classes
, the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life
: serving as both writer
annd director
, potter throws in some of each
,
but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any
. by the time the sigh
- inducing climax hits
, tjhe believability
and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater
. the film ' s falling acation is weirdly unsatisfying
and unlikely
; are we really meant to beleave any of this could happen
? contrastingly
, in its moving final scene
, tje man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film
.
although it ' s apparent that potter cxan ' t grasp wqat she reaches
, i ' m puzzled as tothe why she reaches for so much in the first palce
. ricci ' s suzie is meant to be the film ' s core
: from tyhe extended flashback at the film ' s begginning to the quickly drawn ending
, everything seen in the film
, in smoe way
, relates to her
. so why
then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving otehr individuals
? teh charachter of suzie is too present for tyhe man who cried to work as an ansamble
,
but not present enough for the film to be ricci ' s
. the almost constant lack of flow
and one
- note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny ' s beautiful cinematography that renders the film ' s varios locations wonderfully
. also worthy of note are lindy hemming ' s costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely
.
and
thne there ' s the music
. from minute one to minute ninety
- seven
, there ' s hardly a moment when the wavering
, skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don ' t undercut the action
; the notes stricken both overwhelm
( particularly john turturro
, portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio
, whose money
and reputation catch lola ' s interest
)
and accompany
( oftentimes
, the perfect chords are captued to undermine the state of the film ' s characters
and reinforce thyat state
)
. potter obviously cares much about each
and eveyr musical note
; unfortunately
, the same effort isn ' t given towards
( almost
) everything else
.
