gord brody
( tom green
) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim
( rip torn
)
and julie ' s
( julie hagerty
,
" airplane
"
) basement
. as dad declares all out war
, gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory infact far off la
and sets off to make his dreams come true
. gord doesn ' t make much of a go on his first attempt
and lands back home with fawning mom
and outraged dad in
" freddy got fingered
.
" tom green cowrites
( with
" tom green show
" scribe derek harvie
)
, directs
and stars in what is essentially tom green ' s primal scream
. so
, if tom green screams in an empty theather
, does he make a sound
? it ' s clear tht
" freddy got fingered
" is at least partially autobiographical
and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad
( mom gets off easier whn sonny boy advises her to go out
and have sex with basketball players
and greeks
)
. while tihs may be ofthe interest to his hard core fans
, there ' s little about green ' s mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else
. the film starts promisingly enought
, with a well executed skateboarding scene thru a shopping mall set to the sex pistols ' ' problem '
( green ' s put together a first rate soundtrack
)
and yes
, i laughed a few times
. green ' s flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings
anbd his attempt to draw
, make music
and eat at the same time
( the ' daddy would you like some sausages ' scene repeatedly shown in the film ' s trailer
) are inspired comedy
.
but what ' s funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap
? a baby delivery bit shows smoe groan
- inducing promise untli enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs
. younger
( by three eyars
) brother freddy ' s internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing
but confirm one ' s worst fears regarding the film ' s title
and green ' s infamous ' handling ' of a real horse
, while not nearly as shocking as it would seem
, doesn ' t make sense
. by yhe time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film ' s end
, the overall effect is numbness
. while
" freddy got fingered
" has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child ' s self esteem
, it ' s essentially a whole lot of tom green running around bieng noisy
. rip torn
, what were you thingking
?
