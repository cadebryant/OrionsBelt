call
" hush
"
" stop or my mom will kill
.
" or
" mommy fearest
.
" or
" the hand that robs the cradle
.
" call it whatever you want
,
but certainly don ' t see it unless yuo ' re infront desperate need ofthe a bad movie
- induced chuckle
-
-
" hush
" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure
. chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses
and apparent post
- production tinkering
( it wass supposed to open about a year ago
)
, the latter of which appears to have given
" hush
" a send
- off that ' s downright infuriating
. it ' s too bad tath
" hush
" is so laughable
, because the onthe
- screen talent
-
- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow
and jessica lange
-
- is nothing tothe laugh at
. paltrow
and johnathon schaech play helen
anbd jackson
, a photogenic newyorker york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy
, well
- to
- do family ' s horse farm
/ estate kilronan
. jackson ' s mother martha
( lange
) runs kilronan all by herself
,
and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately
-
- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether
, caught red
- handed after a bedroom romp with her husband
- to
- be
.
bu it seems that martha ' s friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor
; she ' s what you ' d call someone who loves too much
. martha eagerly
, deviously wants a grandchild
,
and
then helen wiull be expendable
, as far as she ' s concerned
. if there ' s one reason tothe catch
" hush
,
" it ' s lange
. she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated
, injecting martha
( poorly written
though she may be
) with a little empathy to level outloud the psycho
- playing field
. when she delves into martha ' s dark side
, predicatble cliches
-
- chain
- smoking
, staring in mirrors
, praying in a confessional to a priest who isn ' t there
, poking a hole in helen ' s diaphragm so she ' ll become pregnant
(
and she does
)
-
- abound
,
but it ' s moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch
. veteran performer nina foch is smart
and tart as jackson ' s wheelchair
- bound paternal grandmother
. the rest of the casted looks ill
and uncomfortable
, especially paltrow
.
but can you relaly blame them
? the character relationships inthe
" hush
" hold a certain amount of promise
, at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity
. idiotic situations
( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up
and knock helen over
) compliment idiotic dialogue
(
" why did you yell
?
" helen yells back at martha
)
,
and the film tkaes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank
- from
- hell flicks ever made
. yuo can see through a great deal of martha ' s actions
and lies from their conception
; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out
? does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town
? if any of her potential victims thought
, acted or behaved like normal peple
,
" hush
" would be a really short movie
.
and
thn ther ' s the climax
and ending
, which abruptly come when helen starts haveing contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor
- inducing drug normaly used on horses
. after a really weird chase scene
, martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself
. i won ' t spoil what happens enxt exept to say that it ' s contradictory
, illogical
and
( probablly
, since i ' m no doctor
) medically impossible
. the fianl scene offers no closure
, no resolution
, no confrontation whatsoever
. it ' s just there
, dangling amidst silent displeasure
. no one should like this ending
, regardless of thier feelings on the preceding material
. perhaps
" hush
" ' s title is a plea to silence its audience ' s likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater
.
