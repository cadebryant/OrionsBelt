ther ' s a good
,
and timely
, story trapped deep within the excess ofthe muder in the first
, a new movie about the abuses of our prision system
. with a country wrapped up in feverish debte over the crime issue
and the rights of the accused
and the incarcerated in jeopardy
, this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies
-
- a point ofthe view
.
but director marc rocco makes it clear fomr the beginning that pretentious
, often nauseating
, camera movements
and slick
, mtv
- style lighting
and editing are far more important
. there ' s not a moment iin the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling
.
adn everything suffers
. christian slater
and kevin bacon star as defense attorney
and alcatraz inmate
, respectively
. after spending an unprecedented amount ofthe time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape
, bacon murders another prisoner
and faces trial
. his young lawyer
( slater
) is fresh out of law school
but determined to
" put alcatraz on trial
" for the abuses of it warden
( gary oldman
)
. the result is the usual courtroom theatrics
- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students
. there ' s very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon ' s earnest overacting
and the appropriate story
. there ' s a lot of overacting from everyone
-
- you know you ' re in trouble right away when r
. lee ermey
( the drill sregeant in full metal jacket
) is cast as a judge
, the center of reason
and moderation
. slater has never beeen convincing
and certainly isn ' t here
adn oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances
.
but the worst feeling ytou get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind tghe camera could care less about telling a ogod story
. there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters
, let alone with them
. how frustrating it must be for actors to work under theese conditions
. if there ' s anything that has alway distingquished american films over the rest of the world
, it is our ability to tell a good story
. have we forgotten
?
