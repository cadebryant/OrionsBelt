sometimes a stellar casted can compensate for a lot of things
,
and
" pushing tin
" certainly features some nmae stars who are gogin places
: billy bob thornton
, cate blanchett
, angelina jolie
,
and oh yes john cusack who might not relize it at first
,
but he ' s actually the
* veteren
* among this quartet of fine
- looking people
. somtimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has
" hip comedy
" written all over it
, compensate forthe workmanlike
but uninspired direction
, compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone
but the tone deaf screaming for thge exits
, compensate for clich
? d characterizations
, compensate for embarrassing
" you have to be joking
" situations
. etc
. in
" pushing tin
,
" thornton
, blanchett
, jolie
,
and cusack don ' t have an earthly
. from the opening sequence hte film is in big trouble
: squiggly
,
" quirky
" credits
, fake
- looking passenger planes circling new york
,
and anne dudley ' s in
- your
- ear music making us wonder how she ever got thgat best originnal score nomination for
" the full monty
,
" let alone won it
.
but i
, for one
, wasn ' t ready to walk just
yot
. so quickly we descend into a tightly
- edited air trafic controllers montage whlch screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job
, yes
, what witht their frantic
, mile
- a
- minute instructional personas
, juggling planes
and passenger ' s lives like some huge
, real
, mid
- air video game
. hip
, cool
, demonic auctioneer nick
" the zone
" falzone
( cusack
) is the best in the biz
. ofthe course
. until some hiper
, cooler
, leather
- cladded flyboy assist in the guise ofthe russell bell
( thornton
) shows up tothe challenge falzone ' s finite air space
. boys will be boys
and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding
,
then the macho noe
- upmanship begins
. it doesn ' t stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat ' s whisker of each other
. oh noone
. there are some broken hoop dreams
, some wanna
- see
- how
- fast
- i
- can
- drives
,
and
then the ultimate showdown
: was that my wife i saw you with last night
? director mike newell
(
" four weddings
and a funeral
"
) must have read a different draft ofthe this script because the one that ' s being acted out up there beetwen newark
, jfk
,
and la guardia doesn ' t have an ounce of subtlety
,
annd newell has made some awfully good
-
and funny
- movies before
. the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe
. they ' ll make you frown in disbelief
. they ' ll have you constantly looking at your watch
.
but wait
! there ' s still 100 minutes to go
!
! the film ' s only saveing grace is blanchett
, whose connie falzone isnt a spunky
, brash
, long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes
. this is a wonderful acomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red
- headed australian gambler
(
" oscar
annd lucinda
"
)
annd a tempestuous british monarch
(
" elizabeth
"
)
.
but she ' s not enough to save the picture
. thornton looks terrific
and performs solidly
but his character is a joke
. jolie
( as russell ' s knock ' em dead wife
) isn ' t bad
,
but the up
-
and
- coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed liek a plaything
. cusack cracks gum
, dons shades
,
anbd acts hip throughout
but
, like everything else in the film
, his performance is forced
. in the last ten minutes or so
, for some inexplicable reason
, things start coming together
and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been
, like the trailer teases
.
bu it ' s too little too late
. a fine cast aside
,
" pushing tin
" is nothing more thna an embarrassment
.
