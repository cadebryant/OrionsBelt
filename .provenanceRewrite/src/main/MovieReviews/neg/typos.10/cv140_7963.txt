the last line
( or near to that honor
) is the great butler
, alfred
( hte ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i think we need a bigger bat cave
,
" or something to that note
. that ' s exactlly what this film is
- too big for its own ogod becouse it has too damn much
. cut batgirl out
. cut one of tyhe villains
. it ' s too much tothe handle in one dosage
. it ' s so much taht cahracters get left behind
. poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes
and a subplot which is introduced
but never finished inspite any way
, shape or form
.
adn elle deserves better
. this isnt the fourth in the gigantic film series
and the second from director joel schumacher
. it ' s also the fourth worst in tghe series
(
and second worst from joel
)
. the series has been declining since its stunning debut
, followed by the almost
- as
- stunning sequel
and
thne the anti
- climactic third one
( firt by joel
)
. this one ' s not anti
- climactic
- i knew it was gonna suck
. it ' s up to joel to amking it fun
though
.
" batman forever
" was funn
. this is a big bore of over
- produced action sequences
adn shallow charachters
. i mean
, this one bit
. i ' m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph
: mr
. freeze
( ah
- nold
)
, who ' s wife was dying of some disease
, has become the new big villain these days
. he ' s a huge ex
- scientist who fell into some weird liquid
( hello
? joker
?
)
and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero
and has a blue body
. batman
( george
)
and robin
( chris
) fight him a bit
but find they ' re growing appart
. meanwhile
, another villain shows uv
, poison ivy
( uma
!
)
, who was a dorky scientist chick wokring on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist
( john glover
) who kills her when she finds outloud he ' s used her research to develop an uberman
, bane
, who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had
. she emerges from her chemicals
( don ' t ask ' cause i can ' t tell ya
) as a sexy woman
( the real uma
) who ' s poisin when or if you kiss her
and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people
. she starts to tear awya at the dynamic duo
. meanwhile
, alfred ' s dieing of the same disease mr
. freeze ' s wife has
(
bu in an earlier state than she
)
,
and his niece
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all the way from oxford wihtout an english accent to get him away from the butler trade
,
but soon
( well
, not really soon
, it takes her 2 hours
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, in an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman ' s alter
- ego
, if you forgot
) hasnt been dating tghe lovely julie madison
( the even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wants a commitment after a year
but he says nothing
. end ofthe her for all we know
. mr
. freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy
and they want to freeze the world
and
then take it over growing newyorker plants as their population
( don ' t ask
!
!
!
)
. thge trio must team toghether
" as family
" to beat them
. there ya go
. not the whole story
but no big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels
.
however
, while tim burton nicely balanced the villin
/ batman storyline
(
although not wonderfully
)
, joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one
. he gets some corny speeches
, a couple clever lines
and that ' s it
. maybe some stunts
. for all this
, i can ' t even comment on george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw the guy
!
and when i doed
, he had horrible dialogue to say
. i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman
bu val kilmer wass too robotic
and fake as batman in the last episode
. george is inwhich between them
. he ' s not quintessential
, he ' s not horrible
, he ' s good
.
but i ' m sure next time wehn they deside to renovate the series since they ' ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort
, we ' ll get a good script
and clooney wiull shine
( if he still has the job
)
. the villains are the only intresting part of the series according to schumacher
. last time
, we hadnt the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones
and the brains
/ comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey
. thsi time we have a somewhat sympathetic
and somewhat hatable villain
( the same guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we feel bad for his mental
/ physical collapse
bu does he raelly need to kill everyone for plants
? arnold isn ' t very good
- too hokey
but kinda sympathetic at soem points
. when he watches old movies of his wife
, he actually looks somber
. wow
.
but uma mkaes the most ofthe her seductive character
, getting the right point between hamminess
and seductiveness
. it ' s like she ' s almost parodying herself in
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she ' s incredibly hot
and makes the movie pretty much a star better
. as forthe the lower bat
- people
, chris is the same as he was in
" batman forever
,
"
allthough i think his work in these is too hokey when he ' s best at quieter parts in
" scent ofthe a woman
" or just plain cool parts in
" fried green tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i love the girl
but she ' s not particularly good in this film
. she can hypotheitically act
, we all saw that in
" clueless
,
"
but her lines kinda sound weird
.
and it isn ' t the mushy
- mouth this time
.
but in all fairness
, she has virtually no part
. joel gets around to her occasionally
adn when she ' s on
, she does stupid sutff
.
.
.
although i know i ' m not the only one who loved tjhe catfight between her
and uma
.
.
.
and poor elle
. poor
, poor elle
. i love that woman
and she can also hypothetically ect
( for those of us who saw
" sirens
"
)
.
but she hasnt no part
!
!
! it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product
. there are noone
" couch
" scenes
( like my best friend noticed
)
. now listen to me on this one
- in every
" batman
" flick
, there ' s a couch scene
. in thge origonal
, it was with vicki
. in
" returns
,
" it was a good make
- out scene with selena
.
and in the last one
, it was a chat with nicole
. this one
, it ' s nothing
.
and batgirl does next
- to
- nothing inthe this film till the end when she ' s suddenly
" part of the family
.
" fortunately
, we get a lot of alfred
. he ' s the always reliable butler
, in case ytou didn ' t know
, who has been with bruce all his life
. he ' s a god
. he ' s a father figure
. he ' s also dieing
. this got to me
. i love alfred almost as much as bruce
and to see him inaddition a robe
, not in his tux
,
and freaking dying just gets to me
. we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the hwole time
.
.
.
but this is never answered
, as this film is too cluttered
.
but in defense
, it does have some good parts
, other thna uma
. for one
, george is a good batman
but unfortunately gets nothing to do
.
and there are some nice touches
. when they show the asylum at one point
, they show the patient ' s belongings in a room
and we see the riddler ' s costume
. i laughed
.
and during a biker scene
( involving robin
and batgirl
- another subplot never handled past initation period
)
, we not only see coolio
but a bunch of bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" from
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all theese
. the film falls apart around thge five
- minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes
.
.
. or doed it just feel like that
? the film should serve as anohter in the long
- line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays
. people are fed up with stupid films
. that ' s why the word of mouth killed
" the lost world
!
" that ' s why last year
, indy films grossed more than ever
. tyhat ' s why this will have a storng box
- office initative from people who just want to see it
, like me
,
bu will die affter a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it
. that ' s why the next two big
- budget aciton pics are john woo ' s
" face
/ off
"
and barry sonnenfeld ' s
" men in black
,
" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on
. i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste
. i like some of his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a time to kill
"
)
but a lot of them suck
. he ' s a really eccentric person
and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director
and that ' s what makes him great
.
but his costuming for woody allen ' s
" sleeper
" was more interesting than this one
(
and his costuming wass cool
- look forthe the nazi number
)
. i love the
" batman
" series
. the first two rocked
and i doed like thte last one
.
but this one is nto going tothe be one that i watch repeatedly like thte other three
. hopefully
, this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time
.
and maybe they ' ll get smart
and bring back catwoman
.
and michael keaton
.
but we can only hope
.
