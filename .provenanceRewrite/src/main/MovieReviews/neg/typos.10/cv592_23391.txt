the realm of science fiction has always beeen an allegory ofthe political
and or moral sensibilities
. the best tales of the genre deal with mankind ' s struggle for survival or knowledge
. such popular
and noteworthy tomes as
" stranger in a strange land
" by robert heinlein
,
" childhood ' s end
" by arthur c
. clarke
and
" man in the high castle
"
and
" do androids dream of electric sheeps
" by philip k
. dick all deal with man ' s need for identity
and struggle for self worth
. hollywood has regularly adapted thte milieu
( if not the message
) ofthe science fiction since it ' s begginings
. most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that tghe escapism they achieved
. it really wasn ' t until producer george pal
, took charge of robert heinlein ' s novel
" rocketship galileo
"
and crafted the film
" destination moon
"
, that ' sci
- fi '
( as it is commonly referred to
)
, came into it ' s own
. from there
, such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick
, have sought to express ideas thru yhe medium of the genre
. with the release of touchstone pictures
" mission to mars
"
, we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci
- fi film for thsoe who read the national enquirer
adn the globe
. the film opens onthe a summer barbecue
, as phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
) woos a young female wiht his tales of space glory
and the upcoming mission
. woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and his wife terri
( connie nielsen
) commit to his coming authority on the mission
,
and luc goddard
( don cheadle
) consoles his son
. entering the party isnt jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, who gave up command of hte mission due to thge untimely death of his wief
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
. luc consoles jim with woody ' s assistance
. the three men are friends
and carry a fine bond ofthe trust
and carring between them
.
but jim still longs to set foot onthe the red planet
. the mission is infront earnest as luc
and his team land in the cydonia region of mars
. they send out tyhe rover to investigate the area
and discover what seems tothe be water or ice under the surface
. going out to investigate
, luc
and his team approach the famed ' face onthe mars '
. a strange noise emanates from the rock
. as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar
, a violent wind storm erupts
, creating a vortex that kills all members of the team
, save forthe luc
. back onthe the space station orbiting earth
, woody
and jim recieve tjhe information that the mars landing team is missing
. luc ' s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to teh red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team
. the second journey tothe the martian world is fraught with danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet ' s surface
. the big question is
, is there now or has htere ever been intelligent life on mars
.
and if so
, what is its relationship with us
? now for the bad news
. the entire plot of
" mission tothe mars
" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated
and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe
. the famed ' face on mars ' becomes the centerpiece of the film
, revealing some of the most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum the screen has witnessed
. borrowing ideas from such films as
" robinson crusoe on mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass
and the pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
annd even mario bava ' s
" planet of the vampires
"
( ' terrore nello spazio '
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission to mars
" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don ' t add up to a satisfying whole
. while some sequences are wonderfully handled
and executed
, the film remeniss flat
annd un
- involving
. so much time is giving to establising the lead characters in the film
,
but to no good use
. the performances are all workmen like
, with only don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort of real chemistry
. gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation
.
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o ' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part for comic relief is jsut too painful to excuse
.
annd the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better
. he ' s just hvaing too much fun here to give a damn
. the script has a few lapses
, namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower
, noone one thikns of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage
. thsi of course leads to our heroes having to abandn their rescue ship
. also
, when oen character sacrifices himself
, the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation
.
but the biggest offence in teh film is thge horrid
, intrusive score by ennio morricone
. subtlety is non
- existent here
. in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out
. the only sequence in which teh score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower
. the pacing of the film is very leisurely
. after the opening introduction ofthe the characters
( which lasts a full 22 minutes
)
, we are finally dropped onto the martian surface
.
then
, there is another long pause in the plot for more character development
, including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity
. the film could lose about 30 minutes
and actually gain some momentum
. there are so many scenes ofthe talking heads
, discussing what we laready know is going to happen
, that it drags the film tothe a dead stop
. the good news isnt that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at
. the vistas ofthe the planet mars are majestic
and awe inspiring
. thge design of the numerous spacecraft
and suits are all expertly drafted
, with a level of realism that hasn ' t been seen since
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
. the visual effects are just stunning
, from the space walk sequences
, to the visualization of evolution on earth
. the only fault come with tyhe martians themselves
, which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world
. director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through outloud the film
. the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un
- interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes
( an homage ' to hitchcock ' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introduced to all of the characters
. scenes in the rescue ship
, with its rotating centrifuge
, are just amazing inwhich theri execution
.
but the nagging question
, is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang
. sadly it is not
. director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production
. the set design
and visual effects are all arresting
.
but it ' s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous
, thought provoking science fiction
. a disappointing film
,
but one that might still entertain if ytou can settle forthe the visuals
.
