saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night
,
and i have to say i wasn ' t too impressed
. thsi film is baout an expert marine sniper
, played by tom berenger
, who is teamed whith a hot
- shot
- young
- no
- experience
- never
- killed
- a
- man new partner to take out some drug
- kingpins
and millitary strong men in panama
. sound cliche
? that ' s only the beginning
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) played the rookie
,
and never seemed to get a handle on his character
. he was so contrary
and pig
- headed in the beginning
, you just wanted to smack him
.
then he goes
" crazy
" from the pressure
,
but seems to immediately snap out ofthe it
. i ' m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing
, editting
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
.
but it didn ' t all come together
. i think berenger is a pretty good actor
,
and he looked great in the part
, covered in camo
, face painted
, stalking through the jungle with his high
- power rifle
.
.
.
but once again
, his character was given some pretty bad dialogue
,
adn didn ' t react too logically to many of the situations
. there was very little logical development in these characters
. my biggest problem with this film was it ' s tendency to put theese two snipers in as
* many
* inches
- fomr
- death situations as possible
. they began to resemble g
. i
. joes
, the greatest american hero
.
and of course their allmost supernatural accracy with thier guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls
. now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold
, inwhich fact that ' s what made die hard so much funn
: the super
- hero avenger type
. so some will enjoy the action hero heroics
,
bu i didn ' t think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes
,
anbd the
" real life
" fiel of covert operations iin panama
. a word must be said on the camera work
, much of it was very nice
. the jungles of panama
( or their stand
- ins in this case
) fromed a very picturesque background
.
.
.
and tghe drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography
. many have seen the slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" following the projectile to its target
. this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering thte moment ofthe tje kill
. it wass dramatic when used in flashback
.
.
.
but it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots
( pardon thte pun
) into the real time action
.
.
.
then it just seemed silly
. all in all
, not a real dog
: there is some nice action
, good atmosphere
,
and pretty photography
.
bu the plot is pretty lame
, the acting didn ' t form a cohesive wohle
,
and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
.
