despite its exceedingly well
- done visual effects
, 1995 ' s original speices was one big hunk ofthe sci
- fi cheese
, from the writting to tje feeble performances
. so
, coming ffrom such b
- grade roots
, its sequal ' s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising
,
yot at the same time it is
. it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original
,
yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad
, if not even worse
. something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species
-
- a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien
/ human hybrid sil
-
- isnt never entered into
( perhaps that ws left for species iii
-
-
though i ' m not giving away anytying wehn i say that this installment has an open bcak door ofthe its own
)
. the alien fun
and games begin this time when a three
- person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly aline dna that eventually infects tyhe mission captian
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
, lite of cbs ' s short
- lived soap of a few years back
, central park west
/ cpw
)
. this alien dna isnt not identical to that which created the original film ' s sil
,
but it ' s close enough
,
and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy
, engaging in bloody sex with jsut about eveyr woman he can find
. meanwhile
, scientist dr
. laura baker
( the returning marg helgenberger
) has created a clone of sil named eve
( natasha henstridge agian
) for research purposes
. it doesn ' t take long for eve to sense another alien presence
, which send her libido inot hyperdrive
. it ' s up to laura
and her former partner
, bounty hunter press lennox
( michael madsen
, another returnee
)
;
and patrick ' s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
) to find patrick before the in
- heat eve doens
.
" this isn ' t the x
- files
, goddammit
!
" exclaims one character in the early going
. in terms of quality
, he ' s absolutely right
,
but he ' s also wrong
. the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick ' s pupils to dialate once he ' s infected
. looks
and sounds an awful lot like the x
- files ' s
" black cancer
" to me
.
but that ' s not the only source director peter medak
and writer chris brancato steal from
. species was already a ripoff of alien
,
but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original ' s director
, roger donaldson
, did
. human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue withing itself
,
and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve ' s alien body
( which ironically was designed by alien designer h
. r
. giger
)
. a large aline hive that our heros douse with a substance fired ffrom large guns
? aliens sans flamethrowers
. the visual effects were by far the best thing about species
,
and the sequel ' s effects crew at steve johnson ' s xfx inc
. keeps that high
- quality tradition alive
; no cheap
- looking lost in space cgi here
. after the effects
, the original ' s best asset was the fresh presence ofthe henstridge
.
however
, medak
annd brancato have noone idea what exactly to do with her for this installment
. at one point she ' s called on to play alien
" empath
"
? la forest whitaker in the original
,
but for most of the duration she ' s holed up in a glass cell
. by the tiem tjhe big breakout so prominantly featured in the trailer actually takes palce
, the film is well into its home strech
. so yhe rest of the time we are treated to patrick
, played with littel zest by lazard
. one problem with tjhe first film was thyat the deadly
, horny
,
but innocent
- at
- heart sil was too sympathetic
; no such problem with patrick
, who comes off as a cocky pretty boy befor the alien takes control
. the rest ofthe the cast alsot fails to add much
,
but the writing cant be faulted for that
. helgenberger
and madsen go through the motions
,
but they are already hampered by the clich
? d development that somewhere between thte two films
, the once
- linked laura
and press stopped getting along
. williamson suffers the worst indignity
. he tries his best to enliven the tolkein african
- american role
,
but how can anyone recite insulting
, derivative lines such as
" i ' m gonna get african onthe someone ' s ass
"
anbd nto appear ridiculous
?
bu species ii ' s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work
. at least the original featured plenty to laugh at
-
- unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley
and whitaker
,
and the sight of helgenberger ' s character performing fellatio on madsen ' s
, for a start
.
bu the filmmakers dont not display any discernable effort at all
, let alone the misguided effort thyat is required for something to reach the camp levle
. for all the blood
and gore
, nudity
,
and sex thrown infront
, speices ii is
, quite simply
, a vapid bore
.
