for a movie with such deep religious
and spiritual undertones
, it is surprising to find the messenger
: the story of joan ofthe arc such an ungodly mess
. in the early to mid 1400 ' s
, there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman
. the church wass a dismally dark
and oppressive place
. france was involved in
" the hundred yeasr war
" against england
. there was no strong political leadership in the country
. morale was low
, there being little hope for the future
. it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing
" voices
"
and seing
" visions
.
" convinced that these were messages fomr god
, she brazenly demanded tothe see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him
. the message
: if he would give her an army to command
, she would deliver to him the crown
. he does
.
.
.
and she does
.
then
, once seated on the throne
, he abandons her to her english captors
. director luc besson
( tje fifth element
) may have co
- wrote the script
but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material
. the inconsistencies of the cast
, the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes
, the inappropiate musical score
,
and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable
. his biggest miscue was to cast his wife
, milla jovovich
( the fifth element
) inthe the title role
. ms
. jovovich
, looks spectacular as joan
, clad in battle armor
, astride a similarly protected horse
. if looks weere enough to fully convey a character
, she would have been brilliant
. since it isn ' t
, she tried
(
and failed
) to ect the part
. her joan is unbalanced
,
" inspiring
" the troops merely by screaming stridently
and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed
. john malkovich
( being john malkovich
) fares a bit better as the dauphin
, who joan woudl see on the throne as charles vii
. an easily manipulated man
, his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death
. faye dunaway
( the thomas crown affair
) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin ' s mother
- in
- law
and chief advisor
. the army under joan ' s command are comprised ofthe comical figures
, more stooges than soldiers
. the one exception would be tcheky karyo
( la femme nikita
) as dunois
, the man who was leading the attack prior to joan ' s arrival
. trying tothe plan a systematic campaign
, he sees his leadership authority negated by joan ' s insistence on following her
" visions
.
" dustin hoffman
( sphere
) has a small inhuman role as joan ' s conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial
. dressed like cloaked monk
, he leads her to doubt herself
and her
" revelations
.
" as well she should
. scriptures dont speak of revelation
. god
, via his gift of holy spirit
, is able tothe communicate to men
. three of the nine manifestations of wholy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation
. they are
: word of knowledge
, word of wisdom
,
and discerning of spirits
. even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his
" holy men
.
.
. who spake as they were moved by holy spirit
( i
. e
. by revelation
.
)
"
but the scriptures also caution us
:
" beloved
, believe not every spirit
,
but try hte spirits whther they are of god
: because many false prophets are gone out inot the world

] joan ' s end
,
( bieng burned at the stake at the age of 19
)
, the frenzy
( mob rule
)
adn blood lust her inspiration wrought
,
and tjhe death
, pain
, or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one
. while her conviction
and intense believing remains an admirable quality
, she was
, as others have been before
and since
, misled by the spriritual master of deception
. as a messenger
, she was quite effective
. she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying
.
