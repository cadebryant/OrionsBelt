perheaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with
"
.
.
. this is the fake news
,
" norm macdonald
, at times
, sould elicit some laughter by blurting out semi
- offensive phrases inwhich his raspy voice
, coated with a condescending attitude
. his shtick was marked by crassness
. in this movei
, for example
, when his girlfriend says that she ' s kicking him out because he ' s been fired from 14 different jobs over the lastr 3 months
, he tries to calm thge situation by saying
,
" maybe you ' ll feel better after we have some dirty sex
.
" this kind of humor can only go so far
,
but certainly can ' t go the distance in a full
- length feature
.
" dirty work
"
, is nothing omre than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically
. emotionally
, they ' ve never outgrown their pubescent years
, hwihc is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback
.
although having noone apparent real world skills
, the one thnig that theese two have always been adept at isnt getting back at peopel
. if the meter maid was unjust inaddition giving you a ticket
,
then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block
and watch the car burst aart
. mitch
( norm macdonald
)
and sam
( artie lange
) need to come up with
$ 50
, 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam ' s dad
( jack warden
) can have a heart operation
. their idea is tothe start a revenge
- for
- hire busineses where they ' ll do your dirty owrk
. in the funniest scene
(
and possibly the only funny scene
) of the movie
, they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot
. their presence is estalbished
,
but when a less
- than
- honorable real estate developer hires them
and
then reneges on the payment
, the twpo go to work tothe exact their sordid brand of revenge
. by default
, dirty work should treat us to smoe outrageous revenge plots
,
but it delivers jerky boys level material
. except for the bit at the used car lot
(
and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers
)
, the dirty work is uninspired
and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call
. already weak on material
, it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he hasnt an unsatisfied libido
and needs ' broads '
and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction
.
but what ' s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor
. relying on his trademark of speaking into his peronal recorder
and saying
" note to self
"
(
" note tothe self
: leran to fight
,
" he says after getting beated uv
;
" note to self
: htere ' s allways beer
,
" he sasy after hitting rock bottom
; etc
.
)
, we feel like we ' re just watching an elongated rehash of his not
- so
- glorious days on saturday night live
. much like the television show
, for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits
. the rest of the story is just dead space
