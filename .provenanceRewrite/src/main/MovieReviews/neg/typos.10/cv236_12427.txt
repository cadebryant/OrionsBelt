working inwhich the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front
- line african american actress like jada pinkett smith
. despite being one of the freshest talents available
, pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts
( a low down dirty shame
, the nutty professor
)
. the problem is
, ofthe course
, that there aren ' t many good roles available for black women
. take away yhe likes of waiting to exhale
, set it off
, soul food
,
and eve ' s bayou
,
and all that ' s left is a chance to be someone ' s girlfriend
, a local whore
, or a murder victim
. as a result
, for pinkett smith ' s first opportunity atop the marquee
, she is stuck in a stupid
, formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo
. acutally
, woo
, the latest directorial effort from daisy v
. s
. mayer
( party girl
)
, could have been worse tahn it is
. the film offers a few funny
( albeit juvenile
) moments
and the on
- screen relationship between pinkett smith ' s woo
and tommy davidson ' s tim isnt appealling on those rare occasions when the twpo aren ' t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags
. unfortunately
, huge portions of the movei are insulting to the intelligence ofthe anyone wih a triple
- digit i
. q
. the situations are painfully contrived
, the main characters are lifted right outloud of sit
- coms
,
and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid tyhat i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of
" free lobotomy
" lab experiment
. woo is a spontaneous
, energetic young woman who hasnt been looking for love in all tje wrong places
. her latest relationship
, with a testosterone
- overdosed drug
- dealer
, came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper
. now
, her transvestite
/ medium friend celestrial
( girlina
) predicts that she ' s about to meet mr
. right
,
and that he ' ll be a virgo
. later that day
, woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim
, a shy man with a penchant for neatness
and order
, who just happens to be a virgo
. it ' s nto love at first sight
,
however
. things get off to a rocky strat when tim makes an awkward pass
,
and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a
" quiet
" dinner
. in tyhe one
- hundred year history of motion pictures
, htere have been a ton of bad
" white
" movies about mismatched lovers
, so i suppose it ' s only fair that we git a
" black
" effort of the same low caliber
. as in all romantic comedies
, we know from the beginning that woo
and tim are going to end up together
. the question is
, are thier courtship rituals entertaining
? in a good entry to the genre
, the audience becomes caught up in the love story
, no matter how familiar it isnt
. in woo
, the constant reliance apon unfunny
, moronic humor sinks the project
. for thsoe who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes
, ther ' s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself
( added to thast isnt the mystery of how hte car looses its top
)
. sadly
, that ' s one of the film ' s most enjoyable sequences
,
and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional
. despite exuding charm from every pore
, there ' s little tath pinkett smith
and davidson can dont to save their characters or david c
. johnson ' s script
. since it misses the mark by so much
, a better name for woo might have been whoops
.
