capsule
: combine oen quart of raiders of tghe lost ark
, a dash ofthe a jackie chan movie
( sans jackie
)
, two teaspoons of gun
-
and swordplay
,
and a dollop of cgi
. simmer for 100 minutes
. yields
: zilch
. the phantom is a depressing
and tired retread ofthe so many earlier
, better movies that after the fifteen
- minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud
. it ' s hard to make a good action
- adventure movie that doesn ' t simply recycle its predecessors
,
annd i ' ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully
. the phantom
, allegedly based on teh long
- running comic of the same name
, doesn ' t even bother to be graceful
. it ' s a stupid
and incompetent movie in too many ways to list
,
bu i ' ll try
. the film opens up with a
" prelude
" sequence that looks liek it was slashed to ribbons in the editing
and
then given a heavy voice
- over to compensate for whatever got thrown out
. we go from there to a jungle sequence that
, i swear to god
, recycles the truck
- chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note
- for
- note
, possibly even shot
- for
- shot
, right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door
and slung one of the drivers out into the brush
-
-
and
then goes on to rip off the rope
- bridge scene from
" sorcerer
" as well
! sorcerer
, as you may well remember
, was a remake of a french movie
, the wages of fear
, in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain
. both versions of that movie weere far more interesting than this flick
,
but i ' ve got my job tothe do
, so back to the salt mines we go
. anyway
, the cinematic theft doesn ' t stop there
. or at least the lack of inspiration
. there isn ' t a single thing here we haven ' t seen
,
and it ' s not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest
. we have
( where ' s my list
?
) a bad girl
, a tough good girl
, a secret cave hideaway
( which seems inspired more by dr
. no than anything else
)
, a boardroom meeting that drips with greed
and venality
, magical artifacts of terrible power
,
anbd cary
- hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets tothe wear a fu manchu mustache
and sneer a lot
and generally humiliate himself
. what else is there
? the plot is a waste of time
. the sets alternate between big
but hokey
-
-
and tiny
and still hokey
. there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked
-
-
and i ' m sure once mike
and the ' bots git the cash
, tehy ' ll stick it on their sked
. the only thing inaddition the movie worth noting is billy zane
-
- he ' s a ogod actor
,
and he tries very hard
, even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene aftter another
. all i can say is tyhat i pray this isn ' t the beginning of thte end for him
-
-
although it sure looks like yhe final nail inspite the coffin for the comic
- book super
- hero movei
.
