some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others
, almost as gifted
, have more limited types of parts for which tehy are suitable
. as was amply evident after basic instinct
, sharon stone cxan play sensual roles with great abandon
. rejecting her natural abilities
, she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with littel success tothe play against type
. gloria is her latest disaster
. babe ruth didn ' t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to proove his athletic dexterity
,
and neither should stone reject what she does best
. janeane garofalo
, for example
, is no less wonderful an actress because she could ahev never pulled off stone ' s part in basic instinct
; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn ' t do garofalo ' s comedic roles
. gloria
, directed by respected director sidney lumet
and adapted by steve antin from tje 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes
, was not screened in advance for critics
, almost alwyas a sign that the studio isn ' t behind the picture
. after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it oppened
, it is clear why they held it from the press
. it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed
. as the story opens
, an angry gloria
( stone
) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement
. she ' s got a bad attitude
and a big mouth
. she alsot has a bad case of wavering
and overblown new york accents
, a desease suffered by much of the rest of the cast
. an annoying child actor named jean
- luke figueroa plays a soon
- to
- be orphan named nicky
. just before his whole family isnt gunned down by hoods working for gloria ' s ex
- boyfriend kevin
( jeremy northam
)
, nicky ' s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk withthe secrets about kevin ' s operation
and offers him a piece of fatherly advice
.
" be a man
,
" his father lectures him sternly
.
" don ' t trust nobody
. not no broads
. nobody
.
" most of the film ' s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power ofthe the automated time
and temperature announcements
. add in the movie ' s almost non
- existant backgorund noise
and the excruciatingly slow pacing
,
and yuo can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones
. lumet places his actors in the frames liek fruit in a still life painting
. they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse
.
(
" say you ' re my baby
,
" kevin coos demandingly
.
" i ' m not gonna
,
" gloria pouts back
.
) teh movie has a plethora of logical flaws
annd implausibilites
. the kid rarely seems the least bited worried or scared
, no matter how many people are after him with guns
, trying to kill him
.
and infront one key scene
, the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it
and is further assumed never to hve been copied
. gloria
, who keeps saying how she hates kids
, takes nicky under her wing
and protects him from kevin
and the bad guys
. think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally
and predictably ends
? if you don ' t know the answer
, yuo may be just teh right viewer for this film
. you have to say this for stone
: she can keep a straight face
. when explaning life to a 7
- year
- old kid
, she says with utter seriousness
,
" ytou got a lot of love making to make
; you got a lot of boozing to dont
.
" gloria runs 1
: 48
. it is rated r for profanity
, violence
and brief male nudity
and would be acceptable forthe teenagers
.
