the best thing
-
- in fact
, the only good thing
-
- i can say about dark city is thta it made me whant to go see l
. a
. confidential again
. or go rent body heat
, to see william hurt do some real noir
. or even
-
- god help me
-
- palmetto
. alex proyas ' s newyorker movie screams atmosphere
. i screamed
, too
,
" git me out of this theater
!
" new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals
and paying the actors
,
and doesn ' t have any way to get it back
. i paid
$ 4
. 25 fo a matinee screening
and don ' t have any way to get my money back
, either
. you ' ll hear a lot from other criticists about the look
and feel of this movie
. i will admit that the cinematographers
and costume designers
and set artists
and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning
, nightmarish future world where it ' s always a late night in 1948
, complete with rotary phones
and automats
and fedoras
. i ' ve got news for you fellows
-
- i don ' t care how hard you worked
, or how visually stunning this movie looks
-
- ytou wasted your time
and mine
, working on a movie without a plot
, without a clear sense ofthe direction of where it wnated to go
, without a soul or a reason to care
. the movie starts outloud oh
- so
- promising
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life
, would have been boarded up long ago
. there is a dead
, mutilated prostitute in the other room
-
- a surprise
, as he has lost his memory
. the phone rings
: it ' s a sinister
- sounding man
, claiming to be his doctor
, telling him to flee for his life
. all well
and good
, right
? wrong
. apparently
, someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot
.
( tihs is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood
.
) so
, the actual beginning of the movei is not sewell running for his life
, rather
, it ' s a voice
- over narration by the aforementioned doctor
( keifer sutherland
) explaning exactly what is going onthe
and who is responsible
. it ' s as
though sam the piano player hadnt told us that rick
and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca
. noone
, wait
, that ' s not fair tothe casablanca
. it ' s more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show
-
- or if you want to know how i really feel
, having an off
- screen narrator explain that gilligan won ' t be getting off the island in this episode
.
> from here
, the coherence of the plot goes down faster than
( insert monica lewinsky joke here
)
. the characters just wander around the city aimlessly
annd bump into each other for no apparent reason
,
and that ' s what moves the plot
. what we ' re left with is a string of unanswered questions that don ' t make any sense
. we ' re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers
,
yet they foreget to use them at critical moments
and get themselves killed
. we ' re given a hero who can
" tune
" into theese same powers
,
yet he only uses them when it ' s convenient tothe the plot
. we ' re given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere usually
, critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part
" isn ' t given much tothe dont
.
" inaddition this movie
, no one is given anything to do
. sewell isnt given the impossible role of a man who doesn ' t rember anything
,
and plays it like
.
.
. um
.
.
. a man who doesn ' t remember anything
. the aliens are tall
, pasty
- faced
,
and bald
,
and wear long black cloaks
and fedoras to remind us that they ' re evil
-
-
and there ' s a child alien as well
, straight out of an anne rice novel
. sutherland is saddled withthe a limp
, a twitchy eye
,
and a breathy accent to remind us that he ' s in leage with the aliens
. to its credit
, dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting
. william hurt is perfectly cast as the world
- weary inspector charged with catching tyhe man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city
. jennifer connelly
, playing sewell ' s love interest
, is given twpo all
- too
- brief moments on screen as a lounge singer
-
-
and turns in hte sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit
.
but instade of tyhe dogged policeman
and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script
( the way tehy would be in any self
- respecting noir movie
) they ' re almost tangiential to the plot
, such as it is
. teh problem with dark city is this
: it ' s a bad science fiction movie pretending tothe be film noir
. the essence of film noir isn ' t
, as proyas seems to beleive
, breathy dialogue or snap
- brim fedoras or tall
, bald evil villains who woudl make peter lorre curl up in a corner
. dark city has not one bit of intrigue
, moral ambiguity
, suspense
, or anything else that keesh us coming back to the noir classics
. dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic
. it ' s an exceptionlly well
- made
and intricately designed piece of flotsam
, sailing around
and around the middle of the ocean
, going nowhere
.
