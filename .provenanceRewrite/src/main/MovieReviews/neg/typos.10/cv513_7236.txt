capsule
: silly
and inane adaption of gibson ' s short story
, which is nowhere in sight
. gibson ' s script only adds insult to injury
. johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie
. i sday
" awesomely
" beccause it ' s one thing to fail
,
but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged
. keanur reeves
( who is terrible
) stars as johnny
, an
" information courrier
" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head
. he isnt given
" one last job
"
( whenever you are in a movie
and you hear thsoe words
, run
)
, which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it sould be lethal
. one ofthe tghe neater touches that hte movie brings in is that the only way he coudl make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories
,
but it ' s only followed up onthe in a token fashion
. for his trouble
, johnny gets chased by the yakuza
, who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high
- tech thrillers
. what ' s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made
* in
* japan
, there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior
and ethics
,
but of course htere ' s no room in this movie for any of that
. the yakuza are simply used tothe point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattoos
,
and grimace menacingly
.
( i could go on about how gangsters
and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies
-
- bound by hounour
, sugar hill
and american me come to mind
-
- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped
.
bu that ' s another essay
.
) anyway
, johnny runs
and eventually winds up in newark
. why newark
? maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future newyorker york
, that ' s why
. there
, he meets an assortment ofthe odd charachters
( ice
- t
, dolph lundgren
and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos
)
. the script deals with them with all thge depth of pieces of furniture
. it turns outloud
( what else
?
) that the data in johnny ' s head could save a lot of people
,
bu ofthe course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn ' t kill him
. handled right
, this could have been absorbing
,
but the script manages tothe mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity
. the details about the look
and fiel of the future are all phoned in from other
, better movies
-
- blade runner
and brazil come to mind
. everything looks run
- down
and scummy
, everyone dresses like they ' re punk rockers
,
and videophones are commonplace
. snore
. the only realyl interesting fluorish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future
( complet with vr goggles
and feedback gloves
)
,
but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un
- technical fellow would
* think
* it woudl look
and behave like
. a hacker of johnny ' s caliber would be blasting away with one command
- line function after another
, instead of wasting all this tyme twiddling with holograms
,
but of course that ' s not cinematic
. whatever
. what went wrong iwth this movie
? gibson wrote his own screenplay
, which i guess is part of the problem
: what works as a short story doesn ' t work in a movie
. his ear for dialogue is terrible
adn the plot doesn ' t advance
, it convulses
. from the script on out
, it was probaly all downhill
. renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless
; htere ' s no fun in kicking a wounded dog
, is there
?
