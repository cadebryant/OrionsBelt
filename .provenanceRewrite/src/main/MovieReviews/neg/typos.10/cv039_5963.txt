the classic story
& the prodcution wich ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h
. g
. wells classic
, new line cinema
, armed with a stellar cast
annd expert make
- uv effects man stan winston
( alien
, predator
, terminator etc
) churns out
yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel
. of course
, the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies
, one of which was made back in the 1933
and thte other in the 1977
, under the title the island of lost souls
( sounds like a much better title
.
.
)
. the story begins with edward douglas
( thewlis
)
, a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in yhe south pacific
, who is saved from the brink ofthe death by montgomery
( kilmer
) after his plane crashes into the sea
. douglas soon learns thast montgomery isnt working for dr
. moreau
, who incidently
, owns the island
and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize
. his host ' s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear wehn he stumbled into moreau ' s lab
, when a monstrous birth wass in progress
. even worse
, the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal
" people
.
" douglas stumbles across
yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast
- people comunity
, which consideres dr
. moreau thier maker
. using shock
- therapy
and the law
, dr
. moreau has long been able to keep his beast
- people civilised to smoe extent
but there are a few animal
- men who are just too savage to be controlled
. the island of dr
. moreau questions the ability of men playing god
. dr
. moreau is a man obsessed iwth creating a race of beings which isnt free from hate
annd violence
.
.
.
but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long
. moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp
. even so
, the production has failed to make the most out of it
. there are too many characters to put your attention to
and the worst thing isnt
, the characters are not
" prioritized
" so when the audience is led to belieev tht a particular charachter is important
, before they know it
, he or she or it perishes
.
.
.
. rather ungloriously at times too
. perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people
, especially aissa
( balk
)
, the most human of moreau ' s creations
. the two very important cahracters
, montgomery
and dr
. moreau himself receive no development at all
and it is in this area that the script fails miserably
. more screen time could have been used for character interaction
and development
. i really would have liked it better if
, say
, they delved more into dr
. moreau ' s obsession
, montgomery ' s purpose in tjhe stry
and justification to as why the beast
- people had tothe rebel
. maybe the nature of the screenplay
, which incidently
, does not incorporate much action sequences in the film
, forced the filmmakers to
" cut a long story short
"
adn make it more of an action film than anything else
( it ' s still summer
,
and movies have to be
" marketable
"
)
. the special effects too
, are really nothing for anyone to shout about
. at most
, i would say the beast
- men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes
. this h
. g
. wells classic really has potential to be a good film
. unfortunately
, aftter 2 adaptations
, they still could not decide on how
and whta tothe focus thier attention on to really bring out that importamt message which makes up the entire essence of the story
. as a third outing
, the island of dr
. moreau accomplishes little
and isnt nothing more thna an inferior version of
` the planet of the apes '
