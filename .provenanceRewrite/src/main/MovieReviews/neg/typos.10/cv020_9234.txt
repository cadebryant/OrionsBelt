" spawn
" features good guys
, bad guys
, lots of fighting
, bloody violence
, a leather
- clad machine gun chick
, gooey
, self
- healing bullet holes
, scatological humor
and a man
- eating monster
. it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12
-
and 13
- year
- ood boys
, it appears tothe have been made by them
. in a classic example of telling
and not showing
,
" spawn
" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness
, forces of light
anbd how
" men are the ones who create evil on earth
.
" so much for a message
. the movie
then lurches foward into the plight of al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government assassin
/ operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn
( martin sheen
, who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip
) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant
. simmons goes to hell
and back
, after making a deal with satan himself
-
- if he agrees to command the devil ' s army tothe overtake the world
, he ' ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda
( underused theresa randle
)
and little girl cyan
( sydni beaudoin
)
. of course
, seeing as how five yeasr has passed
, wanda has fallen for
-
-
and married
-
- simmons ' partner
( d
. b
. sweeney
)
. his
, uh
, shoulder tothe cry on comes infront the form of clown
( john leguizamo
)
, a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan ' s
. clown manipulates simmons
, now in superhuman spawn form
, into a stand off with wynn
. wynn
, who thinks he is in league with the double
- dealing clown
, recognizes spawn as a threat
and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart
-
- wehn it stops beating
, major cities arround the world will detonate
, causing the leak of a disease that
" makes the ebola virus look liek a skin rash
.
" phew
. got all that
? it would be easy to dismiss
" spawn
" as just another one of those heavy
- on
- fx
, short
- on
- substance action pics
,
but it doesn ' t even work on thta level
. the computer
- generated sequences are often
and plenty
,
and the problem is that they look too computer
- generated
. yhe sevral scenes set in hell presnet a devil thta looks
and acts like a video game graphic
-
- withthe the movie ' s healthy budget you ' d tihkn they could hvea afforded to make his mouth move when he talks
. other elements ofthe the movie are so
- so
; spawn ' s enormous red
, flowing cape is a wonderful sight
,
but it ' s too obvious when he ' s being played by a costumed actor or an image
. in movies like
" contact
,
" the special effects serve the story
. in
" spawn
,
" they are the story
.
and spawn himself isn ' t even an interesting character
. the film ' s reliance on razzle
- dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for
,
but both simmons
anbd his funky alter
- ego are completely underdeveloped
. what we need is a batman
, a luke skywalker
. even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn
. poor leguizamo
. he starred in february ' s
" teh pest
,
" a movie that i still think isnt the eyar ' s worst so far
,
although this one does give it a run for its money
. as clown
, he overacts to the extreme
, never missing an opportunity for a poor
- taste punchline
. leguizamo farts green mist
, munches a pizza slice covered with maggots
and even dons a mini
- skirt
and performs a cheerleader routine
, all before turning into a giant grey demon
. the guy was brilliant in
" to wong foo
, thanks for everything
! julie newmar
.
" what is he doing wasting his talent in this
anbd
" the pest
"
? i ' m one of tje few people that liked
" batman
& robin
,
" htis summer ' s other big
- budget comic book film
.
yet after catching this movie
adn making the inevitable comparison
, i can only hope people will change their minds
and think of
" batman
" as the superior adaptation
. there ' s a compelling stroy somewhere infront
" spawn
"
-
- including strong religious overtones
and the debut of the first african
- american superhero ever
-
-
but it ' s just nto foudn anywhere near here
. as it is
,
" spawn
" is jstu awful
-
- it stinks worse than a dead trout
.
