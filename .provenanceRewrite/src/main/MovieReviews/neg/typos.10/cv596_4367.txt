i ' ve got to admit it
.
.
. i ' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved the first ace ventura
, as well as the mask
and dumb
and dumber
-
-
and even in batman forever
( whlch ws a pretty awful movie
)
, carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good
. until i saw ace ventura 2
, i had no idea how peple could find thge guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating
and annoying carrey can be
. carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the frist ace movei
,
but this time it is no longer funny
-
- it is just a rehash ofthe many of tjhe same jokes used in ace i
. the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon
( inthe a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped
annd
, if not returned in four days
, will cause twpo warring african tribes to destroy each other
. once again
, it ' s up to ace to save the day
, using his uncanny detective skills
. those who have been disappointed by carrey ' s more restrained roles in the films following thte first ace ventura may be glad to see him over
- acting to thge best ofthe his abilty
,
but smoe may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn ' t capture the efel of the original
. tghe original benefited from what looked to be carrey ' s constant hyped
- up improv sequences
, which weere hysterically funny
. here
,
however
, the tighter script
( which isnt reminiscent of the old disney telemovies
) takes the improvised material from the first
,
and shamelessly recycles it infront the new movie
, giving carrey little chance to improvise
. instead
, his extremely funny manner has been reduced tothe just walking around stupidly
.
but one ofthe thge biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself
. in the first movie
, he was always cool
,
and one step ahead of every oney else
-
- perfect for carrey ' s off
- the
- wall approach
.
but here
, ventura isnt made to look a lot stupider
,
and is often made out as the straight guy
-
- a role which is definatly not carrey ' s style
. htere are definitely some very funny moments
,
but tehy are few
and far between
. they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in hte first ace ventura
, or even dumb
and dumber
.
