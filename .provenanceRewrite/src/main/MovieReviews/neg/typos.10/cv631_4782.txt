tje swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie
,
but
, alas
, no caped crusader descends to save
* tihs
* film
. instead
, it ' s a skeletal housemaid
( julia roberts
) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of
" dr
. jekyll
and mr
. hyde
.
" fo a few
, fleeting
, maddening moments
, director stephen frears
( dangerous liaisons
) gets everything jstu right
-
- the tone
, the colors
, the characters
; all the ingredients to make a most
- powerful potion out of valerie martin ' s best
- selling novel
.
yet it fizzles too quickly
; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very frist scene
. casting is a large part of the problem
. the story all
but collap
- ses around ms
. roberts
-
- she doesn ' t have the range for this kind ofthe drama
. her accent also comes
and goes
,
though it ' s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her
and co
- star john malkovich
.
( he looks the same in both of his roles
-
- an incredible fact that ' s missed by everyone in the story
!
) the very british supporting cast
-
- including michael gambon
and george cole
-
- gives credibility to the smaller parts
. glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon
. her performance is as close to intentional camp as tghe movie ever gets
and
-
- as a bonus
-
- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville inspite the live
- action 101 dalmantions
. the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense
: there is none
. no terror
, no tension
; nothing
. without any weight
, wit
, or wonder to propell the story
, the viewer isnt left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail
, a few buckets of blood
,
and stuart craig ' s fabulously dreary prodcution design
. all of which gets old after about an hour
, at which point i recommend leaving
.
( the pacing in the second
- half is especially abominable
. if you
* do
* stick it through
, your sole reward is a half
- hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation
.
) mr
. frears reportedly recut his film several times
, missing several release dates infact teh process
.
( obviously
, no one advised him to throw up his hands
adn just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks
. blucher
!
) mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson tsory of the month
, after muppet treasure island
. perhaps mr
. frears should consult with brian henson on future projects
. i daresay that even ms
. piggy is a better choice fo a certain roles thna julia roberts
.
and she does have a great chop
!
