capsule
: five friends at a stag party are involved iin the accidental killing of a prostitute
. the cover
- up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends
, twpo wives
and severeal innocent bystanders
. this was a rela audience pleaser at toronto
,
but it did not do much for me
.
, low 0
(
- 4 to
+ 4
)
- directed by peter berg who acted in hte lastr siduction
and copland
.
- five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them
. one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute
.
- several people with no moral compass
. they started outloud with a simple
, innocent little cocaine party
(
!
)
and by accident look wqat happened
. they have one moral person among them
( daniel stern
)
,
and one totally amoral person
( christian slater
)
. it isnt more selfish to let the amoral lead
, so they do
.
- this film is strange
,
but not really funny or biting
. black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange
. there should be some element of satire
. tghe satire is missing here
. i did not find myself laughing here either
. what we have is a strange crime tale
.
- one just does not care what happens to these people
.
- the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper
adn deeper hasnt been done frequentily
. if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation
.
- it begins like diner
( particularly with daniel stern
)
and ends up like an extended horror
/ crime comic book
.
- ther are several logical holes in script
. if a security man goes to investigate a complaint
and disappears
, wouldn ' t the guests he was investigating be the first suspects
? someone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work
.
( i am desperately trying tothe avoid making this a spoiler
.
)
- populer
and situation ethics get a real slamming
.
- some acting of greif is hammy
and overdone
. more yelling than humor
.
