tyhe first image in
" final fantasy
: the spirits within
" is a coputer
- animated close
- up of a human eye
. it ' s a beatiful piece of work
, remarkably detailled
and quite convincing
. when the picture pulls bakc to reveal thge owner ofthe the eye
,
however
, things change
. the young woman has mesmerizing hair
,
although it hangs too artfully
? even by movei standards
? to be believed
. the facial features are more detailled than any computer
- animation seen to date
,
but the result is mroe reminscent of a very well
- crafted doll than anything human
. she is pretty
,
but bland
,
and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person
. all thge charactors in
" final fantasy
" are like that
. of the core group
, the younger white men
annd women are all atheletic
, attractive
and indistinct
, like applicants for a tv reality show
. the black man is taller
and burlier
,
and the aging scholar is bald
, with wrinkles
and a beard
. none of them appear to be based on individuals
; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist
. it gets worse when they talk
and move
. why is tje sarcastic voice of steve buscemi
, he of the great twisted face
and snaggleteeth
, coming out of thte mouth of some dreary ken doll
? why
, for every fluid physical gesture
, do we alsot see herky
- jerky puppet
- style motions
? more to the point
, who decided a full
- length cmoputer animated movie featuring
" hyperreal
"
( their term
, not mine
) humanoids was a good idea
?
" final fantasy
" is based on a phenomenonly popular video game i ' ve never played
, with a story straight outloud of japanese anime
, which more often than not leaves me bored
and depressed
. if you ' re a fan of either
, please spare me your letters
, as i will focus solely on the finished film
anbd not its source materials
. with an expression
- challenged cast
,
" final fantasy
" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit
. tghe result is ugli
, confusing
and boring
. onot
: the following reveals the basic plot
. if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie
, i suggest you read it
. earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls
. most of our planet is devastated
, with humans living in a few protected cities
. while the bulk of thge survivors focus on military strategies
, aki ross
( voiced by ming
- na
)
and her mentor
, dr
. sid
( donald sutherland
)
, believe in a more organic approach
. they operate onthe the notion
( quoting straight from the press kit
)
" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified
and contained
. aki
and dr
. sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures conbined will form a wave of equal
and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force
. the waves will
, in effect
, cancel eahc other out
adn disarm the foreign contagen
. they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave
. they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaing two spirits before their time runs out
.
" are you still with me
? there ' s only a little more
. aki is infected with the alien force
. dr
. sid has devolopped a method of confining the contagion
and keeping it from killing her
,
but the defense wall won ' t hold much longer
. already
, the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams
. aiding aki
and dr
. sid are hte deepo eyes
, a group of hard
- as
- nails types that would haev felt at home with the troops in
" aliens
.
" capt
. gray edwards
( alec baldwin
) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy
( buscemi
)
, a tough woman
( peri gilpin
)
annd a gentle giant
( ving rhames
)
. throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass
: in this case general hein
( james woods
)
, who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens bcak to the stone age
, even if it destroys earth as well
. so there you have it
. like most of the anime i ' ve seen
, the plot combines apocalyptic settings
, lots of shooting
and fuzzy spirituality
, all wrapped up in a save
- the
- earth bow
.
but i ' m bored with apocalyptic settings
. i understand why so many live
- action films employ them
? they ' re cheap
?
but animated films can show anything
, so why wallow in an indutrial trash heap
? the acation scenes
anbd shoot
- em
- ups don ' t satisfy either
. the humans move oddly
and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can ' t bring them to life
( in fact
, their efforts merely empahsize what we ' re missing
)
. aki is especially disappointing
; with her lack ofthe expression
and flat delivery
, she looks
and sound like a brunet version of weena
, hte eloi girl from 1960 ' s
" the time machine
.
" drab color choices
adn aliens that appear to have beeen created in jell
- o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces
. students of cmoputer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind
" final fantasy
: the spirits within
,
"
but i found it sub
- par across tyhe board
.
" futurama
" does more effective battle visuals
, the kids in
" south park
" are far mroe expressive than these mannequins
and any old epiode of the contemporary verzion of
" the outer limits
" does better doom
and gloom sci
- fi
. so who needs this
? nto me
.
