that ' s exactly how long the movie felt tothe me
. there weren ' t even nine laughs in nine months
. it ' s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it ' s not the whole oral
- sex
/ prostitution thing
( referring to grant
, not me
) thta bugs me
, it ' s the fact taht grant is annoying
. not just adam sandler
- annoying
, we ' re talking jim carrey
- annoying
. since when do eye flutters
and nervous smiles pass for acting
?
but
, on the other hand
, since when do really bad slapstick
( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant ' s head in joan cusack ' s lap
-
- a scene he paid
$ 60 to have included in the movie
)
and obscene double entendres
( robin williams
, the obstetrician
, tells grant ' s pregnant girlfriend she has
" a big pussy
,
" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat
,
but nontheless
, grant paid
$ 60 to have the exchange included in tyhe movie
) pass for comedy
? nine months is a predictable cookie
- cutter movie with no originality in humer or plot
. hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so the scriptwriters could inject the folowing unfunny exchange
: kid
: my dad ' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
,
thn responds in his annoying english accent
anbd i
- think
- i
- actually
- have
- talent attitude
)
: could you possibly elaborite on that
? kid
: my dad ' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. more like a hugh asshole
,
but that ' s beside the point
, which is
: nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs ffrom the ten year olds iin the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds outloud his girlfriend is pregnant
and does his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. this paves the way forthe every possible pregnancy
/ child birth gag in the book
, especially since grant ' s equally annoying friend ' s wife is also pregnant
. the annoying firend is played by tom arnold
, who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick
, none of which is funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed
" arnie the dinosaur
"
( you draw your own parallels on that one
) in a toy store
. the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum
, who should ahve hid himselv away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway
, as an artist with a fear of
(
and simultaneous longing for
) commitment
. nto even robin williams
, who plays a russion doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics
, has much humor
. his is a oney
- joke character
-
- teh old foreign
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( did someone say yakov smirnov
? thast ' s my favorite vodka
, by the way
)
, hence the line
" now it ' s time to take a look at your volvo
,
" anohter nasty
but unamusing joke
, exept this one goes right over the ten year olds ' heads
, while the adults simultanously groan
. nine months is a complete failure
, low on laughs
and intelligence
and high on loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes
and other uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant ' s sunset boulevard arrest
( please
, noone caught
- with
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring more peple into the theaters
,
but they certainly won ' t leave with a smile on their faces
, not after 90 minutes of grant ' s nervous smiles
. everything in the movie is so forced
, so unauthentic that anyone with an i
. q
. over 80
( sorry
, hugh
) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire
.
but at least they didn ' t spend 60 bucks for it
.
