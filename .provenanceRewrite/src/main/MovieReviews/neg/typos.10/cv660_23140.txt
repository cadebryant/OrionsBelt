are you like me
? do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places
, shouting out loud
, nto giving a ratt ' s ass about anyone arround them
,
and basically jsut wallowing in their own self
- importance
? well if you are
, than ytou will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour
and a half
.
.
. only to make up
and hug in the end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: three grown
- up sisters living their pwn separate lives
, begin to re
- establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill
. critique
: htis would be a ogod movie if it wasn ' t for the fact that it ' s got very little to say
, features uncaring peopel sharing annoying phone conversations
, is chockfull of bad acting moments
and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third
- rate after
- skool special
.
and i ' m being nice
! how junk like this gets made is beyond me
,
but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow
, concidering the regurgitation levle of their material had jstu about reached its limit
. the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan ' s character
and her dad in this film is when he hugs her
and swings her around at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deep
. of course
, tjhe same christmas tune that ' s played in every ephron flick chimes out inthe the background
, hwile characters continue to build
" bonds
" among one another by making reference to old
, quaint movies or movie stars
. stop me
.
.
. i ' m gonna cry again
! this film is a mess
. the characters are boring
and irritating to watch
, the plot has something to do wtih three selfish sisters tlaking on the phone a wohle lot
, kind of liking their father
(
but not really
)
and
then finally realizing thge error of their ways
, while sharing an
" emotional
" moment about movie stars from the 50s
. admittedly
, i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds
and a big dog rolling its eyes
,
but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth inwhich this film
. meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent hmeo of limited range
, cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie
/ tv show that she ' s in
. enough already
!
and diane keaton must ' ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one
, cause her acting was amateurish at best
. neither one convinced in
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film
and that ' s probaly where my rating of three points comes from
. all in all
, this movie is not funny
( unless you ' re one to chuckle at train wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutely no emotion
(
although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine
)
annd ends on a perfectly pretentious note
(
" oh no
, please don ' t get any flour on my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest that all ladies take their husbands
/ boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something
! that ' ll teach ' em to mess with you
! oh
and incidentally
, mrs
. joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in teh wind
, so there
!
then again
.
.
. maybe ytou ' ll like it
.
