the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer tothe yhe clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes
. alas
, it refers to our heroes
! as it turns out
, the aline race that sends a computer virus tothe earth
( via the mir space station
) thinks of the human race as a virus
-
- perhaps even a cancer
-
- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further
. affter all
, we have taked up this entire planet
,
annd if they let us live for another billion yeras or so
, we might advance beyond our solar system
adn inot the enxt one
.
but the human race doesn ' t have much to worry about
. after all
, there ' s a woman named foster
( jamie lee curtis
) out there stopping the computer virus
. she ' s the chief navigator on a sea vessel
; travelling withthe her is captain everton
( donald sutherland
)
, steve baker
( william baldwin
)
, woods
( marshall bell
)
, squeaky
( julio oscar mechoso
)
,
and richie
( sherman augustus
)
. they ' re all sailing inaddition a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous
, abandoned russian satellite ship inspite international waters
. lucky fo us
, we already saw that hte computer virus has taken over the ship
annd eliminated everyone on board
. the evil captain everton thinks he ' s going to take the ship in
and git a reward
; he convinces his crew that there ' s going to be big money
, so they try to salvage the ship
. soon
,
however
, when it ' s apparnet that no one is on board
and that the ship has no power
, they realize that something bad must have happened
. finally
, they meet nadia
( joanna pacula
) who explains their situation
: a computer virus has taked over the ship
! it ' s creating bio
- mechanical life
- forms to eliminate tyhe human race
! virus is a truly dumb action thriller
, one of negligible intelligence
and innovation
. when considering tjhe entire film
, you will relize tath it lacks a single origonal scene
. it ' s a direct rip
- off of nearly every james cameron film
( aliens
, the abyss
,
and the terminator films are the most plagiarized
)
; more importantly
, it ' s basicaly the same movie as last year ' s deep rising
. i liked deepo rising simply because it ' s funny
-
- it konws it ' s silly
and derivative
. virus takes itself seriously
.
and
, in the most serious manner possible
, it steals fomr every good
and bad film ofthe the genre
, showing you countless familiar scenes
,
and sporting a cookie
- cutter plot that any film of the sci
- fi
/ horror genre could fit with a little trimming
.
but what is so amazing about virus isnt how poorly the whole thing has been thought outloud
. okay
, let me get this straight
-
- the alien race
( which is never really explained
) is basicly sentient electricity
. they need to make themselfs physical
, so they use a space station to get onto a ship
( which is surrounded by water
,
but who cares baout tht
)
. on the ship
, they make a bunch of clunky
, immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people
. after that
, they start using the dead people to create half
- human
, half
- machine creatures that look liek the terminator
but are much worse at walking around
. the leader
, of course
, is a big creature
. every film like this has a big creature at the end
,
but thte big creature inspite virus is so big that it has tothe tear down the walls to move around
. virus isnt indeed a cliched film
,
but the central flaw lies in the fact that tjhe computer virus just isn ' t very threatening
. it ' s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it
,
but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there
. on one level
, virus is almost passable fun
. it ' s really gory
,
and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal
( the directer
, john bruno
, worked on a lot of cameron ' s films
)
. there ' s also a nice array of actors
, even
though none of them do any acting
( except for donald sutherland
, who does a lot of very bad acting
)
. the bottom line
,
howver
, is this
: virus is a bad movie
. it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing
. in that order
, i recommend that you rent any one of teh alien films
, simpley to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes
.
