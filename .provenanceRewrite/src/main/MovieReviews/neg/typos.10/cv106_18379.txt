in the line of duty isnt the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real
- life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa
. the twilight murders
, another one from the series
, is dealing with the case ofthe gordon kahl
( played by rod steiger
)
, old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u
. s
. government
. affter being released
, he still refuses to pay taxes
and the warrant is issued for his arrest
. when the u
. s
. marshals come tothe arrest him
, it turns out that kahl isn ' t alone
. many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti
- governement beliefs
,
and the routine opperation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that
. that brings fbi on the scene
,
and agent mayberly
( michael gross
) is supervising the manhunt
.
however
, his efforts seem fruitless
, sicne kahl still has many supporters
, some of them even in the local law enforcement
. affter betrayed
, 1988 thriller by costa gavras
, hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right
- wing extremism in tyhe american northwest
,
and that remained so untill oklahoma city bombing
, when media hype brought right
- wingers back into spotlight
. until that tyme
, only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon
. unfortunately
, the twilight murders is still routine
and formulaic television film
, that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script
. sometimes
, like many american tv movies
, it creates drama where drama shouldn ' t be
. on the other hand
, film is steadily directed by dick lowry
,
and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl
. on the other hand
, michael gross as his pursuer is qutie wooden
and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible
.
however
, film does deal with potentially thougth
- provoking social
and political issues
, so hour
and half spent inaddition front of the screen shouldn ' t be teh total waste of time
