everyone knows that old rule
, ' never work with children
and animals
. ' in this latest horror flick mimic case
, it ' s ' never work with children
and genetically enhanced killer animals ' instead
, as mimic features both of these
and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience
. the film beigns in new york
, where we see children dying from a misteryous disease
, which is being carried by cockroaches
. dr
. susan tyler
( sorvino
) creates a genetically enhanced bug
( the ' judas ' breed
)
,
however
, which is designed to kill all cockroaches
. the bug does it ' s job
, the cockroaches all die
,
and the terror is gone
. ' three years later ' appears on the screen
,
and we discover that the judas breed is back
, bigger than ever
,
and ready to kill
. the spin on this bug
,
however
, is that it can mimic it ' s predator
,
annd in this case
.
.
.
. it ' s humans
. taht should teach us for squishing all those bugs
. what should be a roller coaster ride withthe bugs everywhere
, tons of gory deaths
and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued
, almost boring movie which plods along at a vyre slow pace
. perphas the movie was trying to be thought provoking
,
and trying to avoid tyhe ' predator ' tipe movie it could easily have become
. if it is
,
then hte director
and writers have made the wrong move
, because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest
. the director
, who bought us cronos
, a far superior film
, directs the film in a calm
,
and frankly dull movie
. there are few exciting sequences
, instead just a lot of people talking
. if the dialogue ws intelligent
,
then it would be all right
,
but it ' s sadly babbling nonsence
. in fact
, the script is embarrsingly weak
,
and the characterizations not much better
. sorvino
and company are as 2d as characters come
, with the script not bothering to develop them
. ther is some action in this film
,
but it ' s directed in such an annoying way
, it ' s just infuriating to watch
. the camera cuts all over the place
, disoreitating the audience
,
annd instead of involving the audeince in the action
, it merely alienates them
. the peformances are o
. k
, if slightly below average
. sorvino is o
. k
,
although she ' s not very good at conveying terror
, or anything emotion really
. the supporting cast are all sterotypes
, with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth
, a geeky scientist with spectacles
,
and what could be tghe most stereotypical mexican ' old timer ' ever
. their reasonable good fun
,
however
. mimic
,
then
, may fail with it ' s stor
, pacing
and charactors
,
but the film does look good
. like dark city
, mimic is a definite case ofthe style of content
. it may be a bit too gloomy for it ' s own good
,
but the sets look nice
,
and parts of the film are directed well
.
but looks aren ' t good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre
, somewhere where it shouldn ' t really belong
. a good opportunity
,
then
, wasted
. a shame
. overall rating
