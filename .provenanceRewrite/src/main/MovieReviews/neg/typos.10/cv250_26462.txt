a sensuous romantic comedy
, about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom
. there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished outloud
, its the kind of stuff i ' ve seen before
and was made nauseous by its silly idae of love
and what it thinks is funny
. the film plans to exploit tyhe beauty
and sweetness of its delicious star pen
? lope cruz
, who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out thge spices in her preparations
, the aromas just sensually waft ffrom her cooking pot
,
but who can ' t get by on looks alone in thsi transparently predictable story
. pen
? lope was wonderful in pedro almod
? var ' s
" all about my mother
,
"
but here she isnt so visible in such a stale stoyr
, where she cxan only smile
annd tease the audience by haveing us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking
, that she somehow looks ridiculous
, as if she got egg all over her face
. the best you can say about her
, is that she ' s not to blame for this picture being so off
. this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex
, is in my opinion
, worst than a raunchy film thyat delivers what it says it will
. thte story is all about thte love
, motion sickness
,
annd cooking ability of isabella
( cruz
)
, who isnt born in bahia
, brazil
and learns to cook at an early age from her parents ' cook
. to cure her motion sickness
, her parents tried every remedy
, until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to hte goddess of the sea for her cure
. she is able to control it now as long as she doesn ' t drive a car
, ride elevators
, follow in dancing
,
and is the woman on top when making love
. in other words
, she has to be inwhich controll of things
. in her small fishing town she falls in love with a hansome macho latin waiter
, toninho oliveira
( murilo ben
? cio
)
and marries him
. they open up a successful restaurant
, where she slaves away in the kitchen
but he gets all the credit for it
, even
though he ' s a loafer
. one night she catches him inaddition bed with another girl
and decides to leave for san francisco
. we don ' t see her in flight
, so i can ' t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem
-
- unless she flew the plane
. she visits her friend ' s apartment monica
( harold perrineau jr
.
)
, who is a cross
- dresser
, blending right into the san francisco scene
. to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho
, she calls her spiritualist friend
and gets her to cast an irreversible spell
, freeing her from ever loving him again
. her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff
( mark feurerstein
) gets a whiff ofthe her cooking
and storms into her cooking class as if weere in a spell
and presents her with her own live tv cooking sohw
. you can relaly write the script from here onthe by yourself
.
.
. as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had
,
but things continue to go bad for him
: there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village
, there is noone chef to replace his wife
, as the restaurant is about to close for good
. so he comes to san francisco
, figuring he can charm her again
. he brings along with him his guitar playing muscicians
, the ones he used when courting her
, when he serenaded her under her window
. he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick
, the yuppie tv producer chasing after her
,
and sees that she is no longer charmed by him
. when he sneaks on her tv show set
and tries to woo her with his musical group
and him singing corny love songs to her
, the ratings go up
and he ' s hired as a regular on the show
. the show gets so big
, that the network honchos come onboard
, taking it national
.
but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show
, get rid ofthe monica because he ' s a freak
, have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brasillian peppers she uses
,
and htey change her ethnic dresses to low
- cut vanna white type of sexy dresses
. cliff
, her would
- be boyfriend
, acts creepy
and sides with the network big
- shots
, even
though he loved everything she did
. these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes ofthe tv honchos
, they were revolting
. it was an insult to one ' s intelligence
. i ' m sure thast i ' m not spoiling the ending for anyone
, when i tell you tyhat toninho reforms his macho ways
and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again
. if the film wasn ' t terrible enough
, monica
annd cliff act on their attraction for each other
and become lovers
. it was so awkwardly done
, that it had no sense of truth or humor to it
. this film might as well have beeen made by the same network guys featured in this film
, because it doesn ' t look or feel like an almod
? var film
, tyhe type of film it aspired tothe be
,
but more like a film that was interferred with from above
. its more like a futile commericial film that isnt more annoying than charming
and more dull than chic
, as it searches for box office heaven
.
