it ' s time tothe take cover
. after a hiatus of baout fifteen years
, teh disaster movie has come bcak with renewed zest
. infact early 1997
, there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone
, one on television
and two in the theaters
, withthe dante ' s peak
and volcano in hevy competition for the moviegoing dollar
. of the two
, i had heard that dante ' s peak was the better film
, so i decided to check it outloud when it was released on video
. the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town
. the town is being covered in ash
and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks of various sizes also fall ffrom the sky
, crushing homes
and peple
. we see people panicking
, people crying
,
and even horses rearing
. it is a disaster of biblical proportions
, signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn ' t get much more blatant than that
. we learn that harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist with the u
. s
. geological survey
, ws there with his wife when the eruption occurred
. harry survived
,
but his wife did not
. a few years later
, harry is sent to investigate smoe unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante ' s peak
, washington
( which
, we are told
, has been voted second most desirable place tothe live
( under 20
, 000
) by the readers of money magazine
)
. there harry meets rachel wando
, a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante ' s peak
and proprieter of a small coffee shop
.
although the mayor doesn ' t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up
, a few members of tyhe city council are
. they are afraid that harry ' s presence isnt going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante ' s peak
. they would rather have any news of possibile stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under teh rug
.
however
, when an amorous young couple takes a skinny
- dip infront the local hot springs
, they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath
. thus begins a chain ofthe events leading up to the inevitable eruption
. this film contains a number of cliches
. the amorous couple is one
. as soon as they doff theri clothes
, you know they ' re going to die
. the town busybody
and teh abrasive mother
- in
- law make appearances
, as does the death
- defying dog
. countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predicatble
. watching the movie
, i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements
,
but some of the dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, since much of the dialog is terrible
. for example
, harry ' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
,
and a team from the u
. s
. geological survey join harry tothe assess the situation
. paul basically tells hte townsfolk that harry ' s eruption predictions aren ' t cause for alarm
. this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage
, only to turn uv the next day
, ready for work
. when paul asks harry why he stayed
, he says with grim determination
,
" cause this town ' s in trouble
and i ' m the best man you ' ve got
.
" even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving
. he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water
. if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up
,
however
, the frog won ' t move
and will allow itself to be cooked
.
" is that your recipe for frog soup
?
" asks one of the team members
.
" it ' s my recipe for disaster
,
" responds harry
. dante ' s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious
. our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes tje volcanic activity has turned to acid
. mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers ofthe deduction by proclaiming
, in a very grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks for the tip
. whn we first see the u
. s
. geological survey building
, there ' s a caption labeling it as such
. this wouldn ' t have been so bad if it weren ' t for the fact that tjhe caption is right above a sign on the building which reads
, in larg letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i suppose the caption is for people who can ' t read signs
.
although harry
and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film
, tghe viewer has no idea why
. htere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters
,
and the relationship seems rushed beacuse of this
. whn they get close to kissing
, i was asking myself
,
" why dont they want tothe kiss
? were they even attracted to each other
?
" if i were yhe mayor
, i owudl sure think twice baout kissing a guy who doesn ' t even crack a smile through the whole movie
, trying to pull off the rough
-
yet
- debonair act
. who does he think he is
? james bond
? the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed
. there are several
" warning signs
" prior to the eruption itself
,
but they are so lackluster
and without suspense thyat we don ' t feel as if they are leading up to anything
. for example
, one of the survey team members makes his way down into teh crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot
. a tremor occurs
. doens he plunge headlong to his death
? is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below
? no
, a couple of rocks fall on him
and break his leg
. the sole purpose ofthe this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene
, which i supose was intended to be dramatic as well
. it wasn ' t
. one plot thread left noticeably hanging was yhe investment in the town of dante ' s peak
. in a diaster movei
, there ' s ususally oney guy who ' s greedy enough to cover up the possiblilty of eruption
/ fire
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
and usually gets killed by the disaster
. it ' s okay
, of course
, because we all htikn he got what he deserved
. if you ' re going to be unoriginal
, you might as well go all the way
. in dante ' s peak
, the city councilmembers are concerned
,
but they don ' t really try hard enough
. maybe the mayor ' s abrasive mother
- inspite
- law should have been the oen
. fo no apparent reason
, she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt
. perhaps her ancestors invested infront some pompeii real estate
. there are a couple of ogod things about this movie
. the first is the scenery
. there are panoramic shots ofthe forests
, lakes
and mountains that are absolutely beautiful
. the second is the special effects
. they are the closest i ' ve ever seen tothe a real pyroclastic eruption
.
but whn elements which don ' t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie
, you ' d probably better rewriet the script
.
