1
. he doesn ' t have a hard
- to
- decipher accent
, 2
. he doesn ' t alwasy speak in a monotone
,
and 3
. his face doesn ' t always wear the same impassive expression
. in short
, the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad
,
bu too bad to be good
. unfortunatly
, the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle
, firestorm
, which is just plain awful
. one of hte most glaring problems with long
( who made his acting debut in john woo ' s broken arrow
) is that he ' s so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery
. as ace firefighter jesse graves
, long is suposed to be playing a bigger
- than
- life acation hero
-
- the kind of he
- man who wiull crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers
. unfourtunately
, despite the best efforts of first
- time director dean semler to photograph long useing heroic shots that make kevin costner ' s work in the postman look stark
, jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy
. to put it kindly
, this is not a well
- writen motion picture
. firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movei clich
? s which
, taken together
, form something that requires a levle of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot
. the only reason this film is getting one star
( instead of something lower
) is thast most of the fire sequences are realistic
,
and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively
. we ' re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he
and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people
. during this sequence
, our big burly hero proves tyhat he ' s also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl
and her dog
( yes
, the dog lives
) from being broiled alive
. flash
- forward a eyar
. now
, our big burly hero is taking over as chief ofthe his smokejumpers association
, replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins
( real actor scott glenn
)
.
but tihs day
, our big burly hero ' s first in charge
, isn ' t goign to be business
- as
- usual
. a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forrest alight to aid their flight to freedom
. led by randy earl shaye
( william forsythe
)
, the sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe really dieu
, they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border
. along the way
, they meet
and take hostage the damsel in distress
( suzy amis
)
. eventually
, our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire
, rescue the damsel in distress
, defeat yhe sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
,
and restore order to the galaxy
. firestorm ' s director
, dean semler
, is a former cinematographer
( he won an academy award forthe his work on dances with wolves
)
, so it ' s no surprise that the film looks good
. unfortunately
, that ' s firestorm ' s lone asset
,
and it falters near the end
, when cmoputer
- generated special effects fill up the screen
. these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game
. the action sequences
, which include a variety of chases
, are occasionally interesting
,
but never invigorating
. everyone
, including long
, appears to be going through the motions
. there isn ' t a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end
, unless you count the forest fire
, which generates some heat
. as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really dieu
, william forsythe lacks panache
. he ' s worse than a generic bad guy
; he ' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn ' t have any snappy oen
- liners to hurl at our big burly hero
. my advice to scott glenn
( absolute power
)
and suzy amis
( titanic
) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they ' re making out a resume
. there ' s some small comfort in knowing this early in thge year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list
.
( at least i hope there aren ' t 10 worse films thna this
.
)
and i know i wasn ' t the only one who really disliked this movie
. as the audience was filing outloud ofthe the screening
, i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments
. the general consensus seemed to be that
,
although the movie sucked
, the promotional key ring was cool
. the problem is that fox won ' t be giving outloud key rings to regular movie
- goers
, so that nixes any reason to see firestorm
.
