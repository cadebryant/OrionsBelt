take a look at the following equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged is the odd mixture ofthe sentiment
, comedy
and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether
. scrooged isnt alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
and
then sickly suppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v executive with a horrible perosnality
. he ' s evil to secretery
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, except the t
. v ' s staion ' s boss
, of course
( played by the late robert mitchum
)
however
, he is
then visited by a vyre dead exec
, who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts
, past
, presnet
and future
( who is called the ghost ofthe
yet tothe come
, for some reason
) sure enough
, they arrive
, show cross how much of a s
. o
. b he is
,
and he changes his way
.
however
, throughout this simple plot
, we ' ve got to suffer outlandish special effects
, poor comedy
,
and an vyre
, very mean performance from bill murray
. frank cross isn ' t ' funny ' mean
, he ' s just mean
. he also isn ' t very good at emotional scenes
,
and totally destroys the last ten minutes of tjhe film
, wiht an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas isnt
,
and how he hasnt changed
.
howver
, the supporting cast are ok
, with good performances from mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
)
and john glover
( who plays cross ' s ' partner '
) tghe ghost of christmas past isn ' t that bad either
. sadly
,
though
, the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of ' home alone ' style violence from the ghost of christmas present
, played by carol kane
. whoever thought smacking tyhat kane smacking murray in thge head with a toaster was funny
, should be fired straight away
.
and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait
( the guy iwth the annoying voice in police academy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen ' t say much
. the scirpt is horrendous
. michael o ' donaghue churns out terrible
, bad taste jokes
( which i guess is the whole point really
)
then changes direction completely tothe emotional scenes
.
and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes
, which are awful
. the special effects look nice
,
but dont nothing for hte film
. there ' s some impressive make up effects also
. the music is also good
, which is scored by danny elfman
.
but graet effects
and mkea up don ' t make a great film
. scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience
, seing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway
,
and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech
. why didn ' t cross just look out his exec window
,
and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him
? overall
,
then
, you ' d have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided
( perhaps a plague
)
