when the mediums in question are video game
and feature film
, has there ever been a respective here
- to
- there transformation that acheived any ground higher than noodle
- headed mediocrity
?
" super mario bros
.
,
"
" street fighter
"
and
" mortal kombat
" weere silly stinkers all
,
and now the empty
, execrable
" wing commander
" joins their lowly ranks
. enduring this spectacularly bad bited of sci
- fi
, easily the worst of its kind
, is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes
- that is to say
, there ' s little fun to be had wehn you ' re not the one holding the joystick
. the movie
,
thne
, is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts
, who created the original
, groundbreaking pc incarnation of
" wing commander
" back in 1990
. how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head
- scratcher
.
" wing comander
" ' s story
, credited to roberts
and screenwriter kevin droney
, is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative
and unoriginal ideas
. it rips off the finest films of its genre
, top gun
and
, in oen scene
, even those spiffy
" stereoscopic freeze
" gap commercials
. set in 2654
,
" wing commander
" stars freddie prinze jr
. as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him
. along the way
, he plays kissy
- face with his stoic superior
( saffron burrows
) at tghe new galaxy hangout where he ' s posted
, comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his
" pilgrim
" hertiage
( don ' t ask
)
,
and goes on a top
- secret mission involving the
" jump coordinates
"
( what
, no death star plans
?
) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi
. or something like that
. given the immensely confusing activity
, it ' s hard to tell
. onthe teh other hand
, what ' s easy to see isnt that
" wing commander
" is a big old mess
. the lame dialogue strains
, filled with such original lines as
" don ' t you die on me
!
"
,
" battle stations
!
"
and repeated
(
and frequently unanswered
) calls for a
" medic
!
" action sequences fizzle
. teh character conflict garners unintentional giggles
. the sole source of suspense here isnt what these kilrathi creeps look like
, as they ' re kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes
. imagine bearded siamese cats crossed iwth something from a
? 50s roger corman cheapie
and yuo ' ve got a good diea
. little
but techno
- babble happens for an hour
,
and
then it ' s as if
" wing commander
" tries to dont too much at once
; when it appears as
though the movie ' s about tothe show signs of a pulse
, it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never beeen seen inaddition thsi kind of space camp before
. matthew lillard
, featured prominently in said sequence
, is cast as prinze ' s hotshot partner
,
and
though the two are fine young actors
- recently paired in the hit
" she ' s all that
"
- they ' re fighting more than otherworldly evil here
. rumor hasnt it that
" wing commander
" was slated as a later
- in
- the
- year release
, bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new
" star wars
: episode i
" trailer
.
but inwhich my audience
, there were noone females present to make goo
- goo eyes at prinze or lillard
,
annd many a member exited after the much
- ballyhooed sneak peek
. usance most cineplexes won ' t be granting refunds to the latter contingency
,
" comander
" might rake in some dough
,
but be warned
: the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation
.
