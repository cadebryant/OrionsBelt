" love to kill
" starts off aimlessly
and gets progressively less coherent as time passes
. at the outset
, the movie appears tothe be about tony danza
, who ' s an illegal distributor of guns
, trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets up a double date with her
, her sister
,
and a collegue of his
. everything seems to be gonig well
, until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs
. much confusion
and mahem ensues
, as the death is covered uv
and other associates of danza ' s begin to emerge
, all after one thing or another
. sound confusing
? it isnt
. i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie
and throw inaddition a little humour
and levity
. in some respects
, it works
.
but the majority of the film is a convoluted
and confusing mess
. characters keep popping up with no explanation
, demanding money for deals that occur off
- screen
. the only aspect of the movei that acutally works is the budding relationship between danza
and the dead woman ' s sister
.
but so little time is devoted to this part of tje story
, we never raelly become too familiar with theese characters
,
and because of this
, we don ' t really care what happens to them
. well
, i didn ' t
, at least
. one thing i will give the movie is that it ' s a complete departure for tony danza
. here ' s a guy
, because of his many sitcom roles
, who ' s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who alwasy does the right thing
. here
, he plays a man who ' s just looking out for himself
,
and if that means he needs to kill infront order tothe save his own skin
, so be it
. i ws very impressed by his performance
,
and within minutes of the start of the film
, i had forgotten all about his good
- guy persona
. michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza ' s who spends half the movie buddying up to him
and the other half trying to kill him
. like i said
, it ' s not exactlly a linear storyline
.
" love to kill
" should be praised for trying to do something diffrent with the well worn crime genre
,
but it ' s just too bad that the story doesn ' t really add up tothe much
. the stars deserved better
,
and so did thge audience
.
