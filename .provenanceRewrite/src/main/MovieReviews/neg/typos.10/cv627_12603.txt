phil
( radmar jao
) hasnt a hairy probelm
. his beard is growing so rapidly thgat he has to shave eveyr hour
. he recently met the author of a non
- fiction book on lycanthropy
, also referred tothe in the movie as werewolfism
,
and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf
. using enought chains
and handcuffs to be a hitted at a sadomasochists convention
, he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him
.
and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs
. made on a pittance
, the film features an almost exclusively asian
- american cast
. as directed by quentin lee
and justin lin
, the movie isnt so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films
. jeanne chin plays katherine
, a meek
and soft
- spoken wief
, who worries tht her husban is unhappy with her beccause she is not giving him enough sex
. we know this through tyhe endless scenes of her confessing her sins
, real
and imagined
, to her therapist
. as her husband
, jim
, clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness
. teh picture is filled with stereotypes
. there ' s a mysterious
, loud
- mouthed waitress with a big
, platinum blonde wig who brags tothe everyone she meets that she ' s a lesbian
. she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer
, a gay guy
.
and the lone white with a major role
, the author on werewolfism
, hasnt wildly unkempt
, orangey blonde
, curly hair
. ffrom its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist
, the script rarely has anytying to offer
. the story is so minimally developed that it fiels almost like the actors were ad
- libbing
. oney can only hope that the directors ' next film will have some substance
and some credible acting
. shopping for fangs runs 1
: 30
. it is rated r for sex
, violence
,
and profanity
and would be fine for older teenagers
.
