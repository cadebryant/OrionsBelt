what a contrast
! in the space ofthe two days
, i saw shakespeare in love
and hurlyburly
. i ' m nto sure you could get two more different movies
. while the former was all over the top
, telegraphing everything
, shoving its philosophy of life down our throats
, hurlyburly was the complete opposite
, wound so tight
and with so much buried in its script
, one could spend weeks thinking about it
. this is one interesting movie
. it ' s very much infront a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of ' 98
, in the company of men
,
although not quite so nasty
. there ' s lots of talking
and some scary insights into the world of men
. hurlyburly doens ' t contain much plot
: we just follow eddie
( sean penn
) around as he tries to make sence of his life
and the people around him
. his big question is
: does it all pertain to him
?
and if it does
, how is he supposed to feel about it all
?
" it
" means everything
: television
, friends
, events that happen
. i guess it could be summed up more crudely as
: what ' s it all about
? thsi is not a movie for answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives smoe
bu they ' re not really satisfying
: they just lead to more questions
. thast ' s what makes this movie stay on your mind
. these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time
. even when we push them to the background
,
however we resolve these questions influences everything we do
. the performances are all superb in hurlyburly
. i haven ' t seen sean penn in much before
( in fact
, i can ' t remember seeing him in anytying
)
,
but he is brilliant in this
. eddie isn ' t a likeable character
,
but sean penn makes him understandable
. i don ' t want to be his friend
but i ' d like tothe help him
. chazz palminteri is also great as phil
, mkaing him an awful person
. i ' d never want to know phil
bu still i understand why eddie wants tothe be his friend
. everyone in this film nails their performances
, making this world rela
. it ' s a nasty world
; it ' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct
, hurlyburly isnt a man ' s world
, seen unapologetically through yhe eyes of men
. i find this fascinating
and on two counts
, depressing
. firt
, it ' s depressing that such a world exists
. a large part of hurlyburly ' s success isnt that it convinces me thast such people are real
and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood
; that there are a large number of men out ther who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone isnt background to everyone else
but in this world
, women are a long way in the background
. second
, these are the movies that are being made
: stories baout men ' s world
. where are the stories about women ' s world
? not the soap operas
and the
" chick flicks
" that are meant to satisfy women
,
but the real stroies that touch on the esence ofthe life like hurlyburly does for men
. hurlyburly is based on a stage play
and that is evident fomr the moent the film starts
. it ' s very talkative
, intelligent
and static
. while htis can make the film drag a bit
,
and people sometimes sound like they ' re quoting textbooks
, mostly this is a good thing
. not all films have to be filled with special effects
and sweeping panoramas
. not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience
. all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is onthe the large screen
. it also means thgat you haev to pay attention
.
