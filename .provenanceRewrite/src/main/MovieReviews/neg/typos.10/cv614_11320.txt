" flubber
" is the second best exemple ofthe how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaption
,
and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney
. it ' s the kind ofthe film tht may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids
,
but anyone else will feel left out as it ' s boring
, slow
,
and incredibly lifeless
. what could be a film with cinematic magic is instade dead in tje water
,
and it ' s a shame because it could have been a great film
. hypothetically
, i mean
.
" flubber
,
" as you probably know
, is a remake of the disney classic i never saw
,
" the absent minded professor
,
" where a
, well
, absent minded professor palyed by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as
" flubber
,
" you know
, flying rubber
? the new one keeps the basic plot
,
but appears tothe have added a lot else
, like mroe absent
- mindedness on hte part of the proffessor
, some more villains
,
and several
" show
- stopping
" moments
, like a big rumba with the flubber
,
adn smoe more elaborate setups
, none hwihc really make it any better
,
but instade make it worse
. the basic plot revolves around a coleeg professer
, philip brainerd
( robin williams
)
, who creates lots
and lots of inventions
,
but is sadly absent minded
. in fact
, he ' s forgotten his wedding to yhe coleeg ' s president
, sara jean reynolds
( indie actress marcia gay harden
)
, two times before he forgets it again at the beginning
. doesn ' t this warrent some kind of mental treatment
? anyway
, on his wedding day
( the third one
)
, he invents the flubber
, which not onyl bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed
,
but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in
" the abyss
.
" philip believes that this invention
, once fully realized
, will savve his college
, which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon
/ villain
, chester hoenicker
( raymond j
. barry
)
, which is ironically enough the same college his brat son
( will wheaton
- thought he was dead
) goes to
. through a plot twist
, hoenicker ' s goons
, named smith
and wesson
( ha ha
- what a great sense of humor this film has
) who are played by clancy brown
anbd ted levine
( both who needed the pay check
)
, discover it the hard way
,
and try to steal for hoenicker
, who whants it just ' cause he ' s evil enough
. a sub
- plot involves philip ' s attempts to win back sara
, who ' s angry at him
(
and with good reason
)
,
but who is being seduced by who is basically philip ' s belloq
, wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
, playing the hysterically suave
-
yet
- unsuave asswhole once again
)
.
and in another subplot
, philip ' s day
- timer robot
, weebo
( voiced by the one
-
and
- only jodi benson
)
, falls in love with him
. yuckity
- yuck
. what ' s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is
. you don ' t need to be a cynical college student to be able tothe see right through this film
, which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney
, who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) for distribution tothe the general public
, who sadly eats it all up
. ealier in ' 97
, tehy released
" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaptation of a really awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" which
, yeah
, improved over the origional
,
but not by much
. disney ' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now
, only creatively
. in yhe rush to ship out a film fo distribution
, disney hasnt forgotten tothe give this film a littel thing called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks tothe some carefully placed flubber
,
and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze
, delight
, or even cause people to laugh
. i sat there the entire film stone faced
, chuckling perhaps twice
,
and shaking my head at all the bad jokes
. who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom
and starts teaching chemistry
? didn ' t think so
. it doesn ' t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable
. philip is not a lovable absent minded professory
, just a really dumb man being played by robin williams
. williams is a brilliant comic actor
.
.
. okay
, a brilliant ctor iin general
,
but here he ' s given vyer little to do
but occasionally get hyper over something
,
and other times act sad
. thsoe times
, he ' s not bad
.
but whta are we supposed to think of a man who ' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? mabey it was funny
and
/ or respectable in the 60s
.
.
. i like disney
,
and i usually enjoy their films
, not onyl animated
but live action
,
and their recent films
( save for
" hercules
,
" which was good
,
but not great
) have been worse than lackluster
, tehy ' ve been pathetic
.
" jungle 2 jungle
" is probablly the worst film i saw last year
.
" flubber
" ' s probably second
. what do htey need to do
? perheaps create something new
. get writers who can write something that ' s universally entertaining
. films like
" the parent trap
"
and
" mary poppins
" are films that are live action
( or in the latter case a mix of both
)
,
but even i can still watch them because they ' re not only written to be magical to children
,
but to be fun to adults
. what ' s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you
and annoys you at every turn
?
and my god
, couldn ' t they have done something else with edie mcclurg
?
