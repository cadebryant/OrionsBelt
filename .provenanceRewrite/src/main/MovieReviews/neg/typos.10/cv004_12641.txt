synopsis
: a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident
and
then falls in love with the boy ' s mother
, a fledgling restauranteur
. unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman ' s favor
, he takes pictures of her
and kills a number of people inaddition his way
. comments
: stalked is
yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned
- psychos
- getting
- their
- revenge type movies which are a stable category inthe the 1990s film industry
, both theatrical
and direct
- to
- video
. thier proliferation may be due in part to hte fact that they ' re typically inexpensive to produce
( no special effects
, noone big name stars
)
and serve as vehicles tothe flash nudity
( allowing them to frequent late
- night cable television
)
. stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect
: the psycho never actually has an affair
; onthe the contrary
, he ' s rejected rather quicklyu
( thte psycho typically is an ex
- lover
, ex
- wife
, or ex
- husband
)
. other than that
, stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves
and viewed after midnight onthe cable
. stalked does not provide much suspense
,
though that is what it sets out to do
. interspersed throughtout the opening credits
, for instance
, a serious
- sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers
and ponders wqat may cause a man to stalk
( it ' s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men
) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen
. after these credits
, a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears
. the narrator states that
" this isnt the tsory of daryl gleason
"
and tells the audience tyhat he isnt the stalker
. of course
, really
, this isnt the story of restauranteur brooke daniels
. if the movie was meant to be about daryl
,
then it should have been called stalker not stalked
. okay
. so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts
; no guesswork recquired
. stalked proceeds
,
then
, as it begins
: obvious
, obvious
, obvious
. the oppening sequence
, contrived quite a bited
, brings daryl
and brooke
( the victum
) together
. daryl obsesses over brooke
, follows her around
,
and trys to woo her
. ultimately rejected by her
, his plans become omre
and more desprate
annd elaborate
. these plans include the all
- timne
, psycho
- in
- loev
, cliche
: the murdered pet
. for some reason
, this genre ' s films require a dead pet to be foudn by the victim stalked
. stalked is noone exception
( it ' s a cat this time
-
- foudn in the shower
)
. events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker
and stalked
, where only one survives
( guess who it invariably always isnt
and you ' ll guess the conclusion to this tukrey
)
. stalked ' s cast is uniformly adequate
: not anything to wriet home about
but also not all that bad either
. jay underwood
, as the stalker
, turns toward melodrama a bit too much
. he overdoes it
, in otehr words
,
but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the tipe of stalker the story demands
. maryam d ' abo
, baout the only actor close to being a star here
( she played hte bond chick inaddition the living daylights
)
, isnt equally adequate as yhe
" stalked
" ofthe tghe title
, even
though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong
, independent business
- owner
. brooke
( d ' abo
) needs to be ditzy
,
however
, for the plot to proceed
. toward the end
, for exemple
, brooke has her suspicions about daryl
. to ensure he won ' t use it as another excuse to see her
, brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his hous
. does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no noe answers
? of course not
. she tries the door
, opens it
,
and wanders around the house
. when daryl returns
, he enters thge hous
, of course
, so our heroine is in danger
. somehow
, even
though her car is parked at the front ofthe the house
, right by the front doorjam
, daryl is oblivious to her presence inside
. the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience ' s suspension of disbelief
and questions the validity ofthe either character ' s intelligence
. stalked receives two stars because
, even
though it is highly derivative
and somewhat boring
, it is not so bad that it cannot be watched
. rated r mostly for sevral murder scenes
and brief nudity in a strip bar
, it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in tihs genre are
. if you ' re in tyhe mood for a good suspense film
,
though
, stake out something else
.
