there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is inspite the center of a courtroom
, surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong
- worded attack on a gropu of stoic doctors
. when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way
, i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees whith me about the quality ofthe the picture
. you see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries
. i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it
,
and i actively hate it now
, days later
, with the simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hate every element of the film
, beginning with tom shadyac ' s shameless direction
,
and all the way up to the misguided
and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately tothe convey
. the badness of patch adams isnt stupefying
. it ' s confounding
. i can ' t believe a film can be this bad
.
and
yet
, it ' s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make
. in the film
, patch is played by the undefeatable
and indefatigable robin williams
, in a performance of such insulting pathos
and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human
. in the beginning of the film
, patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn ' t want to kill himself
. while there
, he notices that the doctors don ' t care about the patients
,
and that the best way to get thru tothe the patients is to treat them like human beings
. so
, patch goes onthe a crusade tothe be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients
. he goes to medical school
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
)
and convinces him that it ' s good to halp people
. he also meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, the anti
- male med student who just wants to go thru the motions
and be a successful doctor
. naturely
, the dean of the medical school
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
and wants to thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams
. so patch decides that he ' s going to build a free clinic infact teh middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have
.
and that
, my friends
, is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998
. on a superficial level
, the film is not particularly bad
: i wouldn ' t say the cinematography bothered me
,
and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for
( i actually liked potter ' s performance
, even if she is wasted
)
.
but the film fails fundamentally in execution
. every scene swells with grand
,
" emotional
" music
, played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard
. take
, for instance
, the first scene
, which shows patch sitting on a bus
. we don ' t know patch
yet
,
bu there ' s sad music
,
and it ' s supposed tothe make us really sad that he ' s sad
. later on
, patch makse a lot of progress
: he helps a dying patient
( peter coyote
) to enjoy the last days of his life
,
and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively
.
and when that patient finally dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, the music is very very sad
.
but teh problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions
. real drama is character
- based
. you grow to like someone
,
and
then something bad happens
,
anbd you feel it
. we don ' t ever grow to know the dying patient
; he ' s simply a vehicle for patch ' s greatness
. real drama doesn ' t seem forced
, or present just to amke the audience cry
. thta ' s why patch adams isnt not rela drama
. it goes forthe every cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene
. even scenes that have vrey little impact on hte overall film are drowning in marc shaiman ' s sickening musical score
. sentimentality like this is indeed bad
.
but it ' s not as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. you see
, patch is a really great student
. he aces his tests without studying
,
and does it so effectively that people think he ' s cheating
.
but patch doesn ' t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a ogod doctor
.
" why don ' t we see patients until the third year
?
" he bursts out every three seconds
. well
, patch
, that might have something to do with the fact taht you need to leran something before you go treating patients
. not everyone has the caperbility of memorizing facts with noone affort
. most of us have to studdy
.
and a doctor who really wants to help
,
but doesn ' t know a toe from a finger
, probably won ' t be too successful infact preventing death
. oh wait
, i almost forgot
: the point of doctors is not just to
" prevent death
,
"
but to
" improve the qualiyt of life
!
" yes
! that is true
!
and you can not do that without studying
. you can not do tyhat without going to medical school
. what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe
, just maybe
, it is a good idea tothe study firt
and talk to patients later
. follow the rules
? bah
! who needs the rules
! only uptight doctors follow the rules
. the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces
and sporting baggy yellow pants
.
and
then there ' s the free clinic issue
, which i find shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. in the middle of the forest
. where patients can be taken tothe be helped
. for free
. how will patients be transported tothe tyhe free clinic
? wiull it have an emergency room
? or is it just for mental patients
?
and who
, may i ask
, will pay for it
? the film does give smoe token attempts to question patch ' s motives
( i think another character asks him how he ' s gonig to pay for it
, in addition to a little bited ofthe meaningless blather about hmos
and medical insurance
)
,
but they certainly don ' t explore or challenge patch ' s ideas to any meaningful extent
. reader
, please understand this
: i am not mkaing any kind of judgment on the real patch adams
. i know nothing about him
. if his beliefs mirror those of thsi film character
,
then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them
.
but irregardless of what yhe real patch adams believes
, the themes put forth in this film are simplistic
and phony
.
and in the last scene
, the big
, obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus
, patch does a lot of shouting
. actually
, robin williams does a lot of shouting
. he shouts a lot about helping people
,
and a lot of people cry beacuse they are moved by his words
. i won ' t tell ytou that you cxan ' t be moved by his words
, because i
, too
, was moved by his words
. i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap
and phony a cinematic experience cxan be
. patch adams is the cheapest of them all
.
