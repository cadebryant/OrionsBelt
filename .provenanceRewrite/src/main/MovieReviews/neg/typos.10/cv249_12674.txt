synopsis
: blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs
. infront the meantime
, someone sends sarah rotting flowers
, puts her nmae in the newspaper ' s obituary column
,
and kills her cat
. comments
: never talk to strangers
, a colossal waste of time
, moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious tothe the audiance 20 minutes into the film
. one wouldn ' t think thgat two genuine movei stars
, antonio banderas
( evita
)
and rebecca de mornay
( hand that rocks tghe cradle
)
,
and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller
(
" saturday night live
"
) would be involved inthe such a celluloid backfire as this turkey
. not only are they in it
,
however
,
but de mornay executive produced it
. what was she thinking
? never talk to strangers centers upon sarah
, a psychologist examining the ill
- tempered max
, a murderer soon to stand trial
. she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks ofthe some tragedy inaddition her early childhood
. two men woo her
; tony the
" security consultant
" wins her over
( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music
)
. a lot of psychobabble is thrown arround about multiple personality disorder
,
bu the movei asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd
anbd sarah
,
and instead offers several male characters as red herrings
. 86 minutes
, the running tiome of this cinematic mess
, thus
, seem like 86 hours
. a ogod chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah
and tony
. why owudl the career
- minded
, professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a balck hat called tony
? that ' s one ofthe the film ' s mysteries which are never answered
. regardless ofthe motive
, de mornay
and banderas strip down
and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism
. they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally
-
- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film
, tony takes sarah to a carnival that ' s
* right outside
* his dingy apartment
( that way
, they can hurry back
and have sex quickly
)
. also
, apparently
, the weather changes quickly in theri locale
: they ' re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex
; hte next day
, they ' re out playing in the snow before hvaing sex
. the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed iwth tony
and sarah ' s
" character development
.
" someone is outloud to get poor sarah
(
though most of the audience should have figured out who before any ofthe this starts
)
. rotting flowers
, a writeup in tjhe obituary
,
and a beaten naybor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her
. suspense cliche number one also occurs
: whenever someone is stalked in thrillers
, by any means
, if the stalked has a pet
, that pet will die
. oftentimes
, to even further the cliche
, the murdered pet is a cat
( suspense filmmakers
, for some reason
, just don ' t like cats
)
. sarah
, in never talk to strangers
, receives a package
and
, lo
and behold
, discovers her mutilated cat within
. suspense at its very derivative
! as stated before
, never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas
and de mornay ' s bodies as often as possible
. comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here
( he ' s not given lines that are suitable for his persona
)
and doesn ' t even appear all that much
. maybe
, inaddition a way
, he ' s lucky for that
. early on in the movie
, sarah tells tony
, after meeting him in a supermarket
, that she had been advised to never talk to strangers
. allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker
.
