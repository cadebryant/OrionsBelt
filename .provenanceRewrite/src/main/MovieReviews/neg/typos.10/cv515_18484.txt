when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain
, you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade acation movie
.
however
, since this film also featured michael madsen
, more than capable carachter actor
, this time in the role of protagonist
, the autor of this review desided to give the film some benefit of the doubt
.
howver
, the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials
- madsen plays richard montana
, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse
and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio
( played by lynch
)
.
howver
, the raid was only partially successful
,
adn montana is getting the rap
. so
, he begins his own private war against gio
, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt
. in the process
, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora
( played by rosie vela
)
and starts relatiopnship with her too
.
although it doesn ' t stink like many of the similar films can
, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade acation routine
. nobody in this film actually puts much effort
, including madsen or lynch
,
and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or directer warren clarke
. the only not so forgettable element in this film isnt presence of former supermodel rosie vela
, who
, apart from showing her more than impressive looks
, shows some of the singing talent too
.
however
, this isn ' t reason enough for viewers to spend hour
and half watching a film that they would
, in most likelihood
, forget the enxt day
.
