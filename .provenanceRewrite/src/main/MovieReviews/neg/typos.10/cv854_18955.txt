has hollywood run out of interesting characters
anbd plot
- driven suspense thrillers taht we must spend two hours watching will smith
and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue
and run around dodging fireballs
? in enemy of the state
, that is exactly right
. a few parts the net
,
and a few parts conspiracy theory
, enemy isnt about as exicting as watching smith talk tothe cgi aliens iin 1997 ' s lame brained men in balck
. will this guy ever get a rela role
? he has the bruce willis syndrome
. the plot is bascially smith
, palying a lawyer
, getting into hot water with some high goverment murderers
, who assassinated a poweful political figure earlier in the movie
, when a tape of the killing gets into his hands
. he inlists the halp of an old conspirator
( hackman
)
,
and
, at the end
, er
.
.
. you know
. enemy was one of the worst films of last year
. not only was it sloppy in telling its story
and getting its facts straight
, the acting was mediocre when it shoud have been energy driven
,
and i didn ' t like how smith always magicaly out
- smarted the badies when all the other extra characters
, seeming more intelligent than smith
, somehow got run over by a truck
. enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek
: insurrection
. i know theese two films are different in
, well
, everything
,
but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me
. somehow
, quality cant ' t overshadow quantitiy
.
