everybody inaddition this film ' s thikning of alicia
. no
, this is not a documentary on those of us after we frist saw the
" cryin '
" video
. thsi is one of thsoe erotic thrillers
,
but nto like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed
. first off
, ther ' s zero sex
, almost no nudity
,
anbd it ' s not as well
- plotted as one of those tweed flicks
. well
, anyway
. the
" plot
.
" alicia plays
, well
, the babysitter
, who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents
( j
. t
. walsh
and lee garlington
) go out to a party
. tje film
, trying tothe be like one ofthe those introspective erotic thrillers
, shows every characters ' thoughts
, except alicia ' s
. tghe thing is alicia ' s in most of them in most cases
,
adn the thoughts aren ' t too kosher
. first off
, there ' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gave one of the all
- time lousy performances in
" mallrats
,
"
and is only a notch better here
)
, who ' s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully
, played by nicky katt from
" suburbia
"
( who shows he ' s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again
)
. they decide they want to crash her babysitting job
, looking for the typical babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine liuke that
. tghe film intercuts between the subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky
and jeremy
, thge party
)
and each characters ' thoughts
. we get to see jeremy
and nicky ' s dreams ofthe doing a little threeway with alicia
, j
. t
. thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub
( she has it all covered uv
, the little tease
)
,
and
, worst of all
, lee garlington dreaming of that hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them in bed together
. yea
. i so wanted to see george
and lee garlington in bed
,
though i guess i ' m used to george aftter seeing her
and mary tyler moore fooling around in
" flirting with disaster
.
" the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing
,
but come on
. like we care about any of the characters
. the only intresting one is alicia
, mainly because she ' s alicia
,
and we mostly see her inspite teh fantasies
. so i guess she ' s some kind of mystery or something
.
but she is never explored further
. so
, basically
, this film is just a series of mastabatory images
, sometimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once again
, sadly
)
, sometimes featuring a scantily
- clad george segal
( once again
, sadly
)
. i watched this onthe one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night
,
and let me tell you
, it isnt the only way to watch this film
. i mean
, there ' s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night
: they ' re just as good as sleeping pills
.
adn this oen is one big fat waste of time
, even for an alicia film
.
