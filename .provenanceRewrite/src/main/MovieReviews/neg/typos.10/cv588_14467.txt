perhaps if the impostors didn ' t have so much going forthe it
, it wouldn ' t have been such a tremendous disappointment
. written
, directed
,
and produced by one of its two stars
, stanley tucci
, whose last picture was the indie smash hit
, big night
, the impostors almost never catchs fire
. sputtering like a two
- day old campfire
, the story plays like an ad
- lib sketch that was never polished or completed
. the film ' s other star
, oliver platt
, was hilarious as thte senator ' s aide iin bulworth
. the bloated supporting casted is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent
, includng woody allen
, steve buscemi
, hope davis
, alfred molina
, campbell scott
, lili taylor
anbd tony shalhoub
. all are wasted savve allen
, who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes
.
( the audience will easily idenify with allen ' s sentiments
.
) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror
- imaged subtitles
, the movie engenders little genuine laughter
. the stale humer is so embarrassingly bad that you will fidn yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it
. the plot for the movie involves two starving actors
, maurice
( oliver platt
)
adn arthur
( stanley tucci
)
, who accidentally end up on a cruise ship
. inwhich order tothe escape an angry shakespearean actor
( alfred molina
)
, who is chasing them
, they dress uv as ship ' s stewards
. the over
- the
- top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer
. when the leads hide from their pursuers
, arthur covers maurice ' s mouth as he suffers an unending snese
. at other times
, we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else
, while darting in
anbd out of staterooms
. whith the film ' s chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage
, it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce
. the press notes describes how everyone tyhat came on the set remarked at what a good time all ofthe teh actors were having
. too bad they weren ' t more concerned with the audience ' s potential enjoyment
. the jokes
, frequently framed iin silence
, fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground
. one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film ' s dailies
. surely
, if they had
, they would have realized what leaden results they were producing
. it is tricky hvaing good actors play bad ones
,
but
, if they couldn ' t pull it off
, they should have just given up
.
" the show is over for this fella
,
" steve buscemi ' s character says towards the end
. the mystery is why they didn ' t all give up in the beginning
. there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast
. the impostors runs 1
: 42
. it is rated r for a little profanity
and would be fine for kids around 12
anbd up
.
