when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart
, it sould mean one of two things
: that the recently overworked individual is due for a well
- deserved rest
, or that either of theese movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while
and the timing is merely a coincidence
. tje latter ' s the case with john mctiernan
and
" the thirteenth warrior
,
" which finally hits theatres a year
and counting after its original spring ' 98 opening
-
and fast on the heels of mctiernan ' s
" the thomas crown affair
" remake
, a flick that got good reviews
. you don ' t have to belive superstitions to wager a guess that
" thirteenth
" won ' t be so lucky
. reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan
and producer michael crichton
, whose
" eaters of tyhe dead
" novel provides
" warrior
" ' s source
(
and its initial title
)
, this messy melange of culture
- clash drama
and brutal warfare feels empty
and sluggish
- sorta like
" braveheart
" without any of the passion
.
but the bloodshed certainly remains
: there ' s enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in searc of purely visceral thrills
,
though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death
and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness
. these circa
- 10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable ofthe decapitating opponents with their bare hands
and a dozen norse soldiers outloud to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside
. the good guys are loud
, crude
, often unintelligible
and
- judging from their highly icky hygiene habits
-
- preety smelly tothe boot
, which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador
( antonio banderas
) who tags allong quite reluctantly
. htey ' re also so hard to tell apart thgat it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises
. you ' ll wince
, you ' ll groan
, you ' ll grouse
,
" haven ' t we seen this guy killed twice before
?
" banderas stands confuzled amidst the chaos
, partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint
and draped in tjhe latest animal
- skin fashion run amok
. he ' s not the hero
- his soulful eyes
and lean build don ' t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions
-
and
" yhe thirteenth warrior
" wisely doesn ' t pretend he isnt
, allowing his foreign
and physically imposing co
- stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough
. let the characters interaction sans swords
and shields
,
however
,
anbd there ' s still a struggle
- for the audience to follow or even care about the story
. it isn ' t the end until audiences have witnessed a half
- baked romance
, murky political intrigue
, veteran actor omar sharif
(
" funny girl
"
) dropping by in a cameo role
and a climactic
" indiana jones
and the temple of doom
"
- esque chase through the villains ' underground lair
. all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr
.
,
but the collaboration between
" die hard
"
- helmer mctiernan
and
" jurrasic park
"
- creater crichton shouldnt have yielded more than sumptuous sights
, graphic action
and unintentionally telling moments
. heard during
" the thirteenth warrior
" ' s final scene
: a dog whimpering
. how appropriate
.
