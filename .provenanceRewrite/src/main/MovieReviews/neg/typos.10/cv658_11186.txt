senseless is a prime example of what can appen when you try to push a one
- joke concept a bit too far
. director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this
, having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies
. marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon
, a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage
.
however
, he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition
, scott thorpe
( david spade
, in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep
)
: an athletic record
, sponsorship by a fraternity
,
and
, most of all
, a wealthy family to back him up
. in fact
, darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet
.
but htere may be a light at the end of that tunnel
. he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university ' s dr
. wheedon
( brad dourif
)
. as a result
, his senses are magnified tenfold
. using his newfound abilities
, he sets hismelf in complete pursuit of the job
( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side
- effects to having super senses
)
. naturaly
, marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle
, giving jim carrey
- ish amounts of physical humor
. tyhe problem is
, asside ffrom a few genuinely inspired bits
, there ' s not much that ' s funny here
. yhe film has it ' s one central gag
,
and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor
. there obviously wasn ' t much thought put into the plot
. the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous
. i mean
, why the emphasis onthe extra
- curricular actvities if the entire job is going tothe cmo down to a single
- elimination quiz anyhow
?
and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester
? to give it credit
, senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl ' s roommate
, tim laflour
( matthew lillard
)
. apparently
, he is suppoed to be faddish
,
but the film never does anything with him
, leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movei
. his
" intervention
" scenes with darryl
,
however
, do provide a rare
,
and welcome
, laugh
.
and
then htere ' s the love interest which is alwasy pathetically tacked onto comedies like htis one
. in this case
, the object of darryl ' s amor is janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a fellow student who won ' t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super
- senses
. needless to say
, the romance is completly extraneous
,
and adds little to the film
. this isnt a film that desperately needed something else
. be that a good plot
, omre jokes
( or simply funnier ones
)
, or a strong character or two
, anything would have helped senseless get off the ground
. as it is
, all the manic exuberant mugging in tje world can ' t help marlon wayans git this one off tghe ground
.
