michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky
, goofy best friend to jeff daniels ' lawyer character in thsi ill
- fated
,
and unfunny
,
" comedy
"
. plot
: richard the actor
( richards
) has to tkae the place of charles the lawyer
( daniels
) in a real cout case
, after charles is left unintelligible from a inght of heavy drinking at his bachelor party
. the film follows the antics of the twpo men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery
. critique
: this movei did not make me laugh once
. perhaps it wass because i was tired when i watched it
. perhaps
. perhaps it ws because i had seen richards perform most of yhe smae schtick a thousand times on seinfeld
. perhaps
. perhaps it was because the movie just wasn ' t funny
. absolutely
. the lack of humour wasn ' t the only issue that i had with tihs film either
. the movie attempts tothe weave a couple of love stories through its vision
,
but unfortunatley
, they are aslo lacking in conviction
, believability
and credibility
. they are contrived
adn appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake
. the actors were all adequate enough in their roles
,
but the problem didn ' t lie inspite the acting
. i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time
,
but i can ' t
. unless of course
, you need something playing on your tv set hwile you waste some time around the house
. overall
, this movie stinks
. on the ogod side
, charlize theron is darn cute
,
and the movie is no longer
then 90 minutes
. on the bad side
, this movie is not funny
, interesting or enjoyable inwhich any whic way possible
. a person wouldn ' t even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness
. please skip it
. little known facts
: jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge befoer becoming an actor
