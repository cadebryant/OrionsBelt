a follow
- up to disney ' s live
- action
" 101 dalmatians
" that ' s better
, more entertaining than the first
? jsut as unlikely
. with
" 102 dalmatians
,
" tyhe disney studios ahev proven that when it comes to going tothe tjhe dogs
, more is definitely
* not
* the merrier
. 1996 ' s
" 101 dalmatians
" certainly wasn ' t the greatest movie
- going experience of all time
,
but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous
, larger
- than
- life performance
. in addition
, we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels
and joely richardson
,
and lots
and lots of adorable spotted puppies
. this tiome around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen
,
and close ' s facial
and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53
- year
- old actress under that startling black
and white wig of hers
.
but that ' s only half the probelm with kevin lima ' s labourious film
. waht makes
" 102 dalmatians
" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humer
( here almost single
- handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he ' s a dog
, voiced by eric idle
)
, its rabid plotlessness
( cruella goes affter puppies again
; winds up in goo again
)
and most of all
, the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic
" heroes
" of the piece
, a welshman named ioan gruffudd
and the blander
- than
- bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo
?
. gruffudd is cute
and harmless
, perhaps
,
but evans can ' t even aspire to tyhat
. tghe dogs upstage them both
, of course
,
but in the case of evans
, even close ' s split ends are more animated
. bad acting
,
however
, seems to be a requirement for htis sequel
, since g
? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro ' s in
" men of honor
.
" jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs
and depardieu ' s over
- the
- top antics mimic thsoe of the campy close flail fo flail
,
and wail for wail
. france ' s most popular export besides brie has long usance turned inot a caricature of himself
,
and in
" 102 dalmatians
" the producers milk that realization for all it ' s worth
-
- le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as
" poopies
,
" par example
(
and ad nauseum
)
. the finesses of the script
( attributed to four screenwriters no less
,
and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up
) are quickly dispensed with
, since all it tkaes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben
(
?
)
. that done
, it ' s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off
- limits sables
and minks
and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown
. the dogs are pretty cute
-
- try making a puppy look otherwise
-
-
but that ' s pretty much all they are
. ther ' s always the feeling that htere ' s a trainer off in the wings
, coaxing the dogs to open doors
, or pick up their foo bowls in unison
, or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder
. savvy hoiday goers should skip
" 102 dalmatians
"
and pop the original 1961 animated classic into
* their
* vcrs instead
. it ' s noe dalmatian less
,
but 101
% more satisfying
.
