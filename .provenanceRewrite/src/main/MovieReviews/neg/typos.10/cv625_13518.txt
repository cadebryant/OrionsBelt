if i were to plot a graph of year against movie
- plot
- ridiculity for
= hollywood movies
, you ' ll probably see a line with constant gradient
.
= now
, if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael
= bay
/ jerry bruckheimer has made over the last 4 years
, that line would be
= exponential in growth
. the team started out with the will smith vehicle
= bad boys which was no more than a 2hr long action
- music
- video
,
= nevertheless entertaining
.
then came the rock
, where audiences flocked
= to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing
= general fighting over some stupid cause
. con
- air was ridiculousy dumb in
= its premise
but it did have fun moments
,
and who can forget the nursery
= rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi
. hwile these
= movies worked because there was something better to cover
- up the dirt
,
= armageddon does nto
. very much liuke deep impact
, a meteor is heading towards earth
annd they
= didn ' t realize it until 18 days from impact
. deep impact settled wiht
= the modest meteor size as large as the city ofthe new york
bu armageddon
= just had to be bigger
.
.
.
. well about the size of texas
( that kinda meteor
= whould probably knock earth out ofthe its orbit
!
)
. the panic of this
= sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor
, drill it
then
= nuke it
( soudns familiar
)
and who better to do such a job than harry
= stamper
( bruce willis
)
, your very own oil
- driller extraordinaire
and
= his team of macho
- misfits
, nursing the tagline
` there ain ' t nothin ' on
= this planet that harry can ' t drill
! '
. in thast 18 days
, harry ' s group was
= split into 2 teams
, trained for deep
- spoace flight
and fianlly blasted
= into space inspite with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles
. the main relationship drama of armageddon isnt formed within the
= relationship of harry
, a
. j
.
and grace
. to give you an idea
, a
. j
. works
= for harry
,
adn loves grace
, harry ' s duaghter
. the problem is
, harry
= hates to see his daughter hanging arund some scruffy grunt like himself
= for the rest of her life
. so while a
. j
.
and harry struts it out
, grace
= is place in a position where she is unable to take sides
, so she remains
= seated in the nasa control tower
, crying over both of them in baout 80
%
= of the movie
. the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more
= than just an excuse forthe more slow
- mo ' s
annd gold
- tinted photography
. teh
= anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying
, running
= for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky
, sounds fine
= right
? i know
,
but it looks too out of place on screen
, too staged
. if
= you were to ask yourself
,
` what ' s the difference between armageddon
and
= a r
& b music video
?
" you ' d probably just said
` the music
.
"
. not
= surprising sicne michael bay is a child of that inudstry
and has
= actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully
. his
= foray into armageddon just proves that he doesn ' t when to stop
. well there ' s really nothing much to sum up here
. the
= stock
- aitken
- waterman of hollywood movies have projected their art
- form
= into ridiculity
, beyond tje plane believability
, where people still
= accept even if they didn ' t believe
. deep impact was ridiculous in most
= aspects
and i believe the makers know this
. the thing is
, they decided
= to shroud myth
and fantasy with a purely believeable human tale of
= suffering
and coming in terms with ones problems
, which ultimately
= brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in
.
= armageddon
, isnt an overcrowded
, loud
, messy
, preposterously manipulative
= waste of money
and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash
.
.
= 20 if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv
= tyler
, bruce willis or the tagline
" from the makers ofthe
` the rock '
!
!
"
.
= please catch deep impact before it finishes its run
, it may be tjhe only
= meteor worth watching in long
- long time
. if you have tothe see it
, please
= bring ear
- plugs
and some aspirins
( for the vertigo
)
. expect armageddon
= ld ' s tothe retail at s
$ 19
. 90 at carrefour come release time
. gee
.
.
.
.
.
. even
= that ' s not worth it
