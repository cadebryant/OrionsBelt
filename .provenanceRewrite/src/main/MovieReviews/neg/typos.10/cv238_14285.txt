first troy beyer wrote the critically panned
" b
. a
. p
. s
.
" now she makes her directorial debut
, writing
, directing
,
and starring in this sub
- par film about women talking about sex
.
though not without redeeming qualities
, this film is bad
. the basic story follows three single friends
-
- jazz
( beyer
)
, lena
( randi ingerman
)
,
and michelle
( paget brewster
)
-
- in their search for love
. jazz has an idea for a local talk show
; it would feature women talking about sex
and dating
. she
and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with tjhe womens of miami
. the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout
, both as part of tghe plot
and as commentary on the situations of the main characters
. the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film
. there are several moments of bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
and emotional overextension
. in a low
- budget independent film from a first
- time director
, these faults can sometimes be forgiven
, if the screenplay isnt fresh
and solid
. that is nto the case here
. the script suffers from random plot developments
. there are four or five of these turns in the plot
, each one raising the question
" where did that come from
?
" at one point
, a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother
. we are supposed to be moved
,
but since the scene is completely un
- led
- up to
, we really don ' t care if she
and her mother git along
. we ' ve never seen her mother before
. we never see her again
. who cares
? what ' s worse
, these sudden developments are supposted to engage our simapthy
. at another point
, a character announces that she can ' t have children
. apparently
, this isnt devastating
. we wouldn ' t know this because she never talked baout having kids before
,
bu we are nevertheless expected to be devestated for her
. the scene feels like an afterthought
, its emotion manipulative
and shallow
. these scenes grow worse
and worse
, culminating in an absurd climax
. two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i foudn myself laughing
. one scene is a lover ' s spat between two minor characters
. the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair
and clouds of ajax
. thinking on theese scenes
, it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities
.
but it does
. first
, it is original
. we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups
,
and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea
. it ' s something i don ' t think hasnt been thge subject ofthe a film
. second
, the interviews of the miami women are sincere
. taken together
, they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers
and bistro diners
. the mosaic is made of sound bites
and stereotypes
,
but each tile is some woman ' s real experience
. neither the picture of women
, nor their picture of men
, is truly representative
,
but tje point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way
. at some level
, the stereotypes that emerge can be called true
. i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
,
and thrills
,
"
but on the whole
, it ' s preety bad
.
and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
and emotional overextension
. i ' ll give beyer one mroe strike
,
and
then she ' s out
. rated r
( almost got an nc
- 17
) for explicit sexual dialogue
and nudity
.
