it rocks
- ctually
, lots of rocks fly at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points in the film
. they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward
,
and when they land
- once in a while
, when we ened a break from the space sequences
- they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building
and the like
.
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur
.
) they also just might be the most interesting element of amageddon
, a steroid user ' s answer to deepo impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commissioned by the white house
and nasa to stop a giant asteroid befoer it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
adn destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? they require someone experience with deep
- core mining to plant a nuculear missile into said asteroid
.
( in one unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller they built based on his blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost eveyr aspect of it
. we trust nasa to build space shuttles
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
,
and the man who isnt sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they reach space
, we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong
- perhaps the fatc that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it
; i cannot count the number of times they almsot fail the mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whether or not they savve tjhe day
, i will not reveal
. nor will you care
. i will say this
: you know you ' re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteriod movie in terms of emotion
and scope
. willis has barely a chance to come alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act
, in a last minute
-
and futile
- attempt tothe inject warmth into the material
. steve buscemi ' s character
- the wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, isnt sarcastic
and foolish
, so they tape him to a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him up there to begin with
? rather
, why write him into the film
?
- give his almost
- witty one
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
anbd mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendencies
: at one point he chases aftter affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often
and causing significant damage to his oil rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as somene unfit for space travel
, at least in my world where the sky is blue
. liv tyler is pretty
and humourless
, as always
; suspiciously
, four of her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. director michael bay lays the visual
and sound effects on thick
, like ketchup
, eventually drowning the movei on
- screen
.
( the middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on the average primate ' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movie
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s lsat name here
)
!
" i must admit tath not once could i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as theri skin wass often covered in fake blood
. armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes within its equally ludicrous framework
. it has a vivid soundmix
.
but at almsot two
-
adn
- a
- half hours
, i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story
. the love story has been played up in the ads
, perhaps hoping tothe catch people before they recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in the film are miles aart throughout
- erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex
and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remember a little film called jaws
? in thsi film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly found themslves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark
. they didn ' t much like each other at first
; eventually
, they started tothe respect one another
. oney of jaws ' great scenes involved thte would
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stories
. this is the sort of male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into thte mix
and expect we ' ll care about them on teh grounds that hte world is about to end
. not once do we get the feeling that theese characters are even acquaintances
- i ' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before
" action
" was called
. a male friend who loved the film suggested to me tyhat perhaps i cannot relate tothe a bunch of men who don ' t bare their souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i will respond taht the boys in armageddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling ofthe a trailer
- a trailer forthe a movie written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i ' ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life
.
