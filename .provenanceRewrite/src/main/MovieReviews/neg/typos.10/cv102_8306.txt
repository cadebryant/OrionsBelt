ever since wargames
, the first real computer hacking movie
, hollywood has attempted to produce more
and more films about hacking
. these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible
and is usually ridiculous
. if it ' s not this
, the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater thna you would expect
. hackers is guilty of all of these crimes
. to anyone familiar withthe computers
and
/ or the internet
, most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that yuo can ' t take it anymore
. those of you who frequent noe of the greatest sites on the world wide web
, the internet movie database
, are probably aware of the section for movies entitled
" goofs
"
. this is thte section for mistakes in the movies
. well
, imdb sums up hackers extrememly well with the first goof listed
:
" generally ill
- informed
and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers
and technology
"
.
and truthfully
, this is one
- hundred percent correct
. the plot
, obviously
, centers around cmoputer hacking
. more specifically
, it follows the exploits of dade murphy
, a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller
. miller shouldnt be extremely thankful for hte film trainspotting
, because if it were not for that
, who knows where his career would be now after hackers
. the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems
. he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old
. the film
then picks up at that point
, an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer
. dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn
( angelina jolie
)
, cereal killer
( matthew lillard
)
, lord nikon
( laurence mason
)
,
and the phantom phreak
( renoly santiago
)
, who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible
: hack hte gibson coputer
anbd nto get caught by the fbi
. oh
,
and as a little sub
- plot
, dade also trys to woo acid burn
, the only female hacker in the film
. really
, i cin ' t thiunk of much more tothe say about the film ' s plot aside from what i ' ve said
. it ' s just a bunch ofthe computer geeks
( no
, obsessive compulsive cmoputer geeks a littel too advanced for reality
) running around hacking computers
and staying away from the fbi
. thanks to this movie
, the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers
adn wqat they can do
. this movie makes computers look a little bit too adavanced for their time
,
and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list
. to sum it up
, hackers is a terrable coputer film
. if you ' re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world
, i suggest sneakers
.
although at times it too may seem a little far fetched
, it should be much more believable than hackers tothe regular computer users
. hopefully
, this film didn ' t influence too many young computer users out to tihkn they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time
.
