and i thought
" stigmata
" would be the worst religiously
- oriented thriller released this year
. turns out i was wrong
, because while
" stigmata
" was mearly boring
and self
- important
,
" end of days
" is completely inept on all fronts
. it ' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it ' s extremely disconcerting tothe see where teh big man has ended uv
. for the first time in recent memory
, an arnold action movie
(
and
" batman
& robin
" doesn ' t count
) is no fun at all
.
" end of days
" is a major stinker
. the movie opens in vatican city
, 1979
. smoe catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy
, which says that a girl will be born on that nihgt that satan will ahve targeted for impregnation
. if he impregnates her beetwen 11
and midnight onthe december 31
, 1999
, the world iwll be destroyed
. the pope orders protection of this girl
,
though some priests believe she ought to be killed
. iin newyorker york
, that vrey night
, a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy
. twenty years later
, we meet jericho cane
( schwarzenegger
)
, a sucidial ex
- cop with a drinking problem
. now working as a security guard fo hire
, he is protecting a local businessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who is actually possessed by the devil
. an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is affter
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine
( including ownership of the same music box
, apparently
)
, jericho swears to protect her against the devil
and the faction of priests looking to kill her
. there are so many problems with this film it ' s hard to know where to begin
,
but how about starting with the concept
? casting arnold in a role liek this was a mistake to beign with
. schwarzenegger is a persona
, not an actor
, so puting him infact a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad diea
. arnold has neither the dramtic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions
. in otehr words
, trying to give him dimension was a mistake
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis could have played this role
( they ' ve all played noble
and flawed heroes
)
,
but not schwarzenegger
. there are several scenes that attempt tothe establish jericho ' s character
; one hasnt him contemplating suicide
, anohter crying over the loss of his wife
and daughter
,
and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine ' s location by offering him his ood life bcak
. none of these scenes really wokr
, because arnie isn ' t up to the task
. the filmmakers would hvea been better off making jericho a strong
, confident character
( like thte terminator
, for example
)
, the likes ofthe which schwarzenegger has excelled in before
. this one isn ' t at all believable the way arnold plays him
. the supporting cast trys their hardest
,
and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all
. as the prince of darkness
, he ' s suave
and confident
. he acts liuke one would expect the devil to act
. the probelm is that the script has him donig things that mkae no sence
( more on that later
)
and that undermines him as a powerful villain
. byrne out
- performs arnold in every scene they have together
( inlcuding the aforementioned temptation bit
)
,
but this is problematic when it causes tje audience to start donig the unthinkable
: root for the devil
. byrne ' s speech about the bible being
" overrated
" actually starts to make sence
, mainly because arnold ' s attempts at refuting it
( mostly of the
" ' tis nto
!
" variety
) are feeble at best
. the only problem is
, arnold has to win
, so in tje end
, nobody really cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho ' s security guard sidekick
and tries to liven thigsn up with some comic asides
,
but liek most bad action movie sidekicks
, he disappears after about an hour
. robin tunney isn ' t given much to do except look scared
. in fact
, all of the supporting players are good actors
,
but none
, save for byrne
, is given anything interesting to dont
. performances aside
, it would be really hard tothe enjoy this film no matter who starred in it
. this being an action blockbuster
, it ' s no surprize that the worst thing about it is the scirpt
, which starts off totally confusing
,
and wehn some of it is explained
(
and not much of it is
)
, it ' s utterly ridiculous
. why is the devil coming on new year ' s eve
, 1999
? because it ' s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil
, which isn ' t 666
, it turns out
. some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down
, so the real year is 999
, so jstu add a 1 tothe the beginning
,
and you ' ve got 1999
! if you don ' t buy thsi explanation
, ytou ' re not alone
. it ' s convoluted
and silly at the same time
. the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous
( she ' s christine
, see
,
and she lives in new york
, see
.
.
.
)
,
and if that weren ' t bad anough
, there ' s plenty ofthe bothersome stuff in this film that isn ' t explained at all
. why cant satan kill everyone he passes on the street
,
but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex
- cop
, he ' s powerless
? is he impervious to only one kind of bullet
? how come he can ' t control jericho or christine
?
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies
? a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this
,
but it ' s never actually explained
. usually
, this sort of thing wouldn ' t marter in a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don ' t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies
)
,
but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting
. there are several predictable horror film clich
? s present in
" end of days
,
" complete with the old
" black cat hiding in a cabinet
" bit
, nto that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there
. it gets so formulaic that it ' s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close theri eyes at the precise moment a
" boo
" will come
. their predictions will rarley be wrong
. the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless
, partially because we don ' t care about these characters
( due to the script ' s pathetic attempts at characterization
and setup
)
,
and also because they
, too
, don ' t make any sense
. there ' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady
. it ' s good for a few chuckles
,
but not much esle
. supposedly we ' re to believe she now has super strength by virtue ofthe being controlled by satan
,
but the script never sets that up
, so the scene is merely silly
. none ofthe this is terribly exciting
, because all thge action sequences are so badly framed that it ' s often hard to tell why it ' s happening in the first place
, not to mention that they ' re edited in full
- on incomprehensible mtv quick
- cut style
. most of them had me scratching my head
, rather than saying
,
" wow
, cool
!
"
" end of days
" is not only silly
and confusing
,
bu it ' s also distinctly unpleasant to watch
. the devil apparently doesn ' t operate in the more subtle
, i ' ll
- convince
- people
- to
- kill
- eahc
- other fashion outlined in the bible
,
but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely inwhich broad daylight
. this doesn ' t only make him an awfully predictable sort
,
but it also means tyhat not a single scene in
" end of days
" goes by without unnecessarily graphic voilence
, or the odd kinky sexual encounter
(
yet anyother bit that had me scratching my head
)
. if violence is supposed tothe be shocking
, it ' s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb
. scenes aren ' t connected through any reasonable means
, so a lot of the time
, stuff gets blown up
, or people get killed
,
and i had no idea why
. reasons
? to hell with reasons
! let ' s just blow stuf up
! isn ' t it kool
? nope
, not by a long shot
. this film is thoroughly unwatchable
. it ' s dull
, interminable
,
and unrelenting in its stupidity
. perhaps arnold needs to make smoe movies with james cameron to revive his career
, because it ' s not happening with hack peter hyams here
.
" end of days
" might hve had camp value
, if onyl it didn ' t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody ' s going to buy
. if the movie is going to be serious
, the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script
. if it ' s going to be campy
, arnold shouldn ' t be taking himself so damn seriously
( i didn ' t actually see him put up on a cross
, did i
?
)
,
and his character shouldn ' t be such a sad sack
. as it stands
,
" end of days
" is just a bad movie
,
and an awfully gloomy one at that
.
