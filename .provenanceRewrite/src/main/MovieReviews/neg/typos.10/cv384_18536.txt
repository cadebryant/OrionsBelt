it ' s actually not so bad that dreamworks desided tothe release the loev letter at about the same time as star wars episode i
: the phantom menace
, because this way less people wiull have to sit thru this dreadful little comedy
.
and noone
, i really don ' t feel guilty baout wishing this movie death at the box
- office
. really
, i don ' t
. nto at all
. the plot has been done before
-
- a mysterious
, unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town
, causing confusion for everyone who reads it
. the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
and by the way
, what is it with bookstore owner main charachters
? in teh past yearm
and a half we ' ve seen them inthe life isnt beautiful
, you ' ve got mail
, this movie
,
and the upcoming notting hill
)
, who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore
. she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from
,
and comes to the
( incorect
) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott
. he
, reading the letter himself
, assumes that she wrote it for him
. after a while
, they fall in love
( well
, duh
)
. kate fiels guilty about getting in a relationship iwth someone more than twenty years younger tahn her
,
annd she also fiels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman
( tom selleck
)
. to add to her turmoil
, her mother shows up
( blythe danner
, who apparently must have had her daughter when she was baout 9
)
and her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting characters aren ' t called supporting for nothing
. their purpose isn ' t just to move the plot allong
, they ' re also supposed to give the storyline a backbone
. to do this
, they must exhibit at least marginal depth
and must also be interesting
. rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting rotagonist inwhich the middle
and surrounds her with hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondary cahracters
, expecially when at the core of the movie is teh protaonist ' s various interactions with them
. this is the love letter ' s damning error
. capshaw ' s character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies
,
but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one
- dimensional
. because of that
, the lvoe letter is awkward
and insincere
. even worse
-
- it ' s a bore
. i liked capshaw
and her helen
,
but everyone else is painfully fake
, undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist
. there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either
-
-
and besides degeneres ' wisecracks
, there ' s little that is even a little amusing
. this is not a completelyl thoughtless film
and director peter ho
- sun chan does a good job of portraying helen ' s yearnings
and various subtle complexities
.
but it ' s far from profound
. there isn ' t a common theme running through the proceedings
, thus the movei seems thoughtfully pointless
. really
, this is a harmless little movei
; it ' s far from an abomination
and it ' s nto torturous to sit through
.
but bad
, it is
. awful
, it alsot is
. the love letter is a failure
,
and an inane failure at that
