from a major leage baseball radio broadcast
, featuring play
- by
- play man harry canary
and color man whitey hashbrown
, with special guest commentator james berardinelli
. hc
: as we go to the top of thte 8th
, we ' re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli
, who ' s here fresh from seing the new baseball movie
, major league
: back to the minors
, the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors
. nice to see you
, jim
. as a big baseball fan
and a movie reviewer
, can you give us the scoop on the new flick
? jb
: my opinion
: the producers should have stopped hwile they were ahead
,
and that was nine years ago
. one entry was definitely enough
,
and i ' m surprised there was a third after tyhe anemic showing
and low quality of major league 2
. this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct
- to
- video
. it ' s worse than a mediocre made
- for
- tv feature
. i should also mention that this movie likely won ' t play all that well in cleveland
. now that tjhe rela indians are perennial contenders
, they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks
. actually
, most of the action involves the twins ' aaa minor league club
, the buzz
, rather than the actual major league franchise
. hc
: sorry to interrupt
, jim
,
but we still have to dont play
- by
- play for the game on the field
. leading off this inning is john warren
. he steps into the batter ' s box
and takes kent ' s pitch low for ball one
. wh
: so
, the story ' s strictly minor league
, right
? what ' s it about
? jb
: scott bakula
, the guy from quantum leap
, plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell
. when twins owner roger dorn
, once again portrayed by corbin bernsen
, needs a newyorker manager for his aaa team
, he offers the job to gus
, who is now faced with two daunting tasks
: turn the team around
and groom hot prospect downtown anderson
( played by walt goggins
) for a promotion to
" the show
.
" with the help of fromer major leaguers pedro cerrano
( dennis haysbert
)
, rube baker
( eric bruskotter
)
,
and isuro tanaka
( takaaki ishibashi
)
, gus gets the buzz on the right track
. in fact
, he is so succsessfull taht he earns the enmity ofthe the jealous manager of the big
- league club
, leonard huff
( played with over
- the
- top relish by ted mcginley
)
. soon
, dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus ' overachieving group against huff ' s overpaid
, last
- place bunch
. wh
: can we guess who wins
? jb
: the results have all the suspense ofthe watching the videotape ofthe a game when you ' ve already seen the box score
. on top of that
, none of the mock
- ups are presented with much flair
. they ' re not just boring
; they ' re lackluster
.
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension
; htey ' ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1
annd 1
. wh
: are there lots of yuks inthe this one
? jb
: not noe
, from start to finish
. i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh
and funny
. okay
, a lot of the jokes were sophomoric
,
but they made me laugh
. the two sequels haven ' t just been stale
,
but their humor quotient hasnt been abysmally low
. even bob uecker ' s once
- sharp one
- liners haev turned lame
,
and they ' re tyhe closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing
. hc
: here ' s the 1
- 1 pitch
. looooooong drive
? fair or foul
? foul ball
! thge count goes to 1
and 2
. wh
: does the film at least get the baseball details correct
? jb
: yes
. there aren ' t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best
- ever baseball movies
, the natrual
.
but i ' d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story
, believable characters
, or even a littel genuine humor
. heck
, the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major leage
: back to the minors
. wh
: it ' s nice to see old firends oen more tyme
, isn ' t it
? like cerrano
, tanaka
,
and dorn
. jb
: depends on whether you really care that anyone is back
. there aren ' t any rela characters here
? just an assortment of cliched oddballs
. yeah
, the voodoo hitter
, the catcher who can ' t throw back to the pitcher
, the japanese player
,
and the conceited player
- turned
- owner have all returned
,
but who really cares
? they have no depth
. noteable absences include tom berenger ' s veteran
annd charlie sheen ' s
" wild thing
.
" we don ' t raelly miss them
,
though
. hc
: breaking ball
, low
and outside
. 2
and 2
. wh
: so you ' re saying that we should give this one a miss
? jb
: taht ' s right
. to use baseball terminology
, it ' s a three
- pitch strikeout
. if you ' re looking for a good movie that involves baseball
, try popping the natural
, field ofthe dreams
, bull durham
, or even the first major leage into the vcr
. actually
, this is an oddly
- timed release
, since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters
. even the minor league seasons are already underway
. don ' t bother with major league
: back to the minors
. it ' s a wretched time
- waster
. wh
: thanks for the advice
. jb
: you ' re welcome
. hc
:
and here ' s the 2
- 2 pitch
. fouled back
, right into htis booth
. hey
, jim
, heads up
! oops
. somebody better get him some ice for that
. he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies
,
but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls
. odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him
, almost as if he has a grudge to settle
. anyway
, back tothe the action on the field
?
