say
, tell me if you ' ve seen htis before
: a crisis on
- board a commericial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly
anbd land the plane herself
. airporta ' 97 anyone
? ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to califronia on christmas eve
. amazingly
, on what would seemingly be a busy day ofthe travel on one of the most flown routes
, only about six other passengers are on the flight
. anyway
, they tkae off
, liotta escapes
and kills all the police
and the pilots
,
anbd stewardess lauren holly locks herself in the cockpit to fly the plane
. teh story is beyond routine
, the script is embarrassing
( at one point
, this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down
)
, the characters are worthless
,
and the performances are annoying
. surprisingly
, co
- writter steven e
. de souza actually wrote the first two
" die hard
" movies
!
" turbulence
" takes place at christmas time
,
yot the film wass released a faw dyas after the holidays
. brilliant marketing
, as no one cares about anything having to do wiht christmas after december 26th
. the studio knew they had a bomb
,
and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would see it
.
