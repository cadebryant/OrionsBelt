capsule
: godawful
" comedy
" that ' s amazingly shabby
and cut
- rate
,
and rather bereft of laughs
. i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers
: international man of mystery
. i desperately needed something to cheer me up
, or at least distract me so i could get a clear head
. get some perspective
. even dumb movies cant do that for me
, sometimes
. i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment
,
bu i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery
. michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five
- minute sketch on saturday night live
and stretched it to the length of a feature film
, padding it out with toilet jokes
annd the sort of props
- strategically
- positioned
- between
- naked
- actors
-
and
- camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago
. the plot
, what little there is of it
: back in the swinging mod hep sixties
( i don ' t think i ' m doing a disservice to the movie ' s attempted early look
and feel by describing it that way
)
, sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr
. evil
. evil launched himself inot orbit
and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later
, when powers was out of teh picture
. powers also had himselv frozen
,
annd he wakes up to find the ninties a very hard time to deal with
. the basic gag
, that of powers ' total inability to cope with the nineties
, is not so much exhausted druing the course ofthe tje movie as never even realy dealt with
. the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics
: james bond gags
( of which this movie has no end
, right down to teh silly character names
)
, inept slapstick
, toilet humor
,
adn stratagically placed props
.
.
. the movie ' s amazingly bereft of ideas
, come to think of it
, with a couple of bright exceptions
. one is dr
. evil ' s son
-
- ther is a sidesplitting scene where father
anbd son go to an encounter group
, chaired by carrie fisher
-
-
and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics varios forms of transportation from behind a couch
( it ' s a visual gag
-
- hard to describe
,
and hard to recommend seeing the movei forthe
)
. a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected
annd thrown on the screen for this movie
,
but it ' s desperate rather thna clever
. instead of skewering the whole thing
, it ' s a rather bloodless
and unfunny tribute
. myers himself is also desperate
: he ' s given an idea to play
, not a character
. plus
, the attempts tothe make teh character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy
( albeit
" nineties
"
) agent are a waste of time
. i wanted to have thte movie end with him trying
yet again to git it on with her
, only tothe have her deck him one
. with a couple of exceptions
, the movie misses all of its own best moments
. the movei even looks cheesy
,
annd not in a good way
: i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi
- def video or something
, so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes
. the whole thing has the air of bieng done on the cheap
. my definition of comedy is simply
: did it make me laugh
? the few times that i laughed in austin powers weere completely offset by the time i spent cringing
and wanting outloud
. the most damning thign i could sday about the movie is that wayne
and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson ' s shorts
and sent it sailing
.
