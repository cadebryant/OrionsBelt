" tarzan
and the lost city
" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in qutie a while
. not onyl it is poorly writen
, badly acted
,
and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas
, it is thoroughly uninspired
and insipid
. unfortunately
, it ' s not bad in the way great
, colossal misfires like
" heaven ' s getoe
"
( 1980
) or
" ishtar
"
( 1987
) were bad
. instead
, it litterally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with
, which begs the question of why it was made in the first place
. with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un
- produced
, how does needless drek like tihs make its way to the big screen
? of course
, tarzan is noe of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history
- he has appeared in over forty films
, hwihc have ranged from the very good
( 1984 ' s
" greystoke
: the legend of tarzan
, lord of the apes
"
) down to the really bad
( 1981 ' s
" tarzan
, the ape man
" with bo derek
)
. most of these films were just cheapie b
- movies made in the thirties
and forties
, starring ex
- olympic athletes
and a lot of cutsie chimps
. therefore
, if another tarzan movie is to be made
, one might assume that it would ahev something new to offer
- a different angle
, an orginial storyline
, anything to set it apart from all the others
.
" greystoke
" added a never
- before
- seen level of realism to the pulpy tale
,
and even
" tarzan
, the ape man
" at least had the mis
- guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek ' s bare breasts
.
" tarzan
and the lost city
,
" on the other hand
, has absolutely nothing to offer
but a bunch ofthe recycled storylines
and bad dialogue
. the script
, by bayard johnson
and j
. anderson black is about as formulaic
and generic as they come
. comic books haev better plots than this
. the movie is so bad
, in fact
, that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call tyhat was so tirelessly mocked in last summer ' s comedy
" george of tghe jungle
.
" didn ' t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs
? the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established
: a quick opening narration tells of tarzan
( casper van dien
) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes
,
and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke inheritage
. when the movie starts in 1913
, he is a civilized english gentleman
( without an english accent
)
,
and he is to marry jane
( jane march
) in less than a week
.
however
, when a wicked archeologist
/ grave
- robber named nigel ravens
( steve waddington
) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar
, one ofthe africa ' s last great secrets
, the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back tothe the jungle
. at first
, jane refuses to go
, pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding
;
but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind
and tracks him down
, therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her
annd her ape
- man
. once the film gets gogin
( in its own sluggish way
)
, it delves into a series of jungle adventures
, as tarzan
, jane
,
and thge natives attempt the thwart ravens
and his crew from discovering the city
. most of the so
- called adventures are cheesy
, predictable
,
and unexciting
, with no pace
, tension
, or acation tothe speak of
. there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies
, ranging from
" raiders ofthe the lost ark
"
( 1981
) to
" the goonies
"
( 1985
)
. when the movie is running short on action
, it includes a few greenpeace
- friendly scenes ofthe tarzan freeing caged animals
, releasing a baby elephant from a trap
,
annd throwing ivory tusks into the river
. the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality
. for instance
, when tarzan
- who was raised in the jungle
- is bit by a cobra
, he doesn ' t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi
- experienced weekend backpacker would do
. instead
, he ties a tourniquet around his arm
and stumbles off into the jungle whith no plan for survival
. of course
, one cxan ' t help
but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is
. not to ruin the ending or anything
,
but there is no lost city
. there is
,
however
, a lost pyramid
, hwihc i suppose is all tyhe resource
- strapped fx deparment coudl come up with
( the special effects are not worthy of a made
- fo
- tv movei
)
. which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numberous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid
, when it ' s sitting right out in the middle of an open field
? strictly speaking
,
" tarzan
and the lost city
" isn ' t even bad enough to have camp quality
,
altough casper van dien ' s laughably stiff performance comes real close
. this movie proves what
" starship troopers
" only hinted at
: he cannot ect
,
but he sure looks well
- groomed
, even in the deepest heart of the african jungle
. van dien is much too much of a pretty
- boy to be an effective tarzan
; he ' s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth
. i also wondered what the make
- uv department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa
- 1983 steve perry haircut
. waddington makes a decent villain
,
although he ' s like a charmless version of belloq from
" raiders ofthe the lost ark
.
" as jane
, tyhe ex
- modle jane march has little to do
but smile
and look pretty next to tarzan
. she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two
,
but whenever a snake comes into the picture
, she is reduced to a hysterical mess
.
however
, amidst all this complaining
, i do have one piece of good news
.
" tarzan
and the lost city
" is so lacking in ideas both newyorker
and old
, that it is unable to fill even an hour
and a half of celluloid
. so
, we can say this much forthe it
: at least it had the decency to be short
.
