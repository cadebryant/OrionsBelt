steve martin is one ofthe the funniest men alive
. if you can tkae that as a true statement
,
then your dissappointment at this film iwll equal mine
. martin can be hilarious
, creating some ofthe the best laugh
- out
- loud experiences that have ever taken palce in movie theaters
. yuo won ' t find any of them here
. the old television series that thsi is based on has its moments of humor
and wit
. bilko
(
adn the name isn ' t an accident
) is the head of an army motor pool group
,
but his passion is his schemes
. every episode involves the sergeant
and his men in one or another hair
- brained plan to git rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base
.
" mchale ' s navy
" ' s granddaddy
. that ' s thge idea behind this movie too
,
but thte difference is that
, as far
- fetched
and usually goofy as the television series was
, it was funny
. htere is not oney laugh in the film
. the re
- amking retains the goofiness
,
bu not hte entertainment
. everything is just too clean
. it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot
and looks every bit liek it
. it all looks brand newyorker
, even the old beat
- up stuff
. martin is remarkably small in whta should have been a bigger tahn life role
. in the original
, phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold
and more than a touch of sleaziness
. martin ' s bilko is a pale imitation
. the only semi
- bright spot is phil hartman as bilko ' s arch
- enemy
. it ' s not saying much
, considering martin ' s lackluster character
,
but hartman leaves him in the dust
