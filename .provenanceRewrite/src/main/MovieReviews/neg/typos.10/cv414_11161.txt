the
yet
- to
- be
- released krippendorf ' s tribe is bieng marketed as a family comedy
,
but buyer beware
. this movie can ' t make up its mind
. is it a family comedy with vulgar refernces to both the male
and female bodies
, menstruation
, circumcision
,
adn sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them
? or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort
? either way
,
" unbalanced
" is the owrd to stamp on this hit
anbd miss
and miss
and miss effort
. yhe premise is catchy
- widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
) has spent the past two years
" getting over
" the death of his wife
, neglecting key research
and squandering grant money on personal living expenses
. now it ' s time to show what he ' s achieved in those two years
,
and he has absolutely nothing to show fo it
. whith a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea
, krippendorf petitions fo new funds while hiding tyhe fact that the previous
$ 100
, 000 grant was spent on trips tothe mcdonald ' s
.
but when his
" discovery
" becomes the latest craze among colleagues
, thge professor finds he must do more than talk about thge tribe
- he must create it
. with the aid of his three children
, the headstrong teen shelly
( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you
)
, the slightly yuonger mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and the nine
- year
- old edmund
( carl michael lindner
)
, the
" shelmikedmu
" tribe
( named from the first half of each child ' s nmae
) is born
,
and videos quickly produced in krippendorf ' s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of thge newely found new guinea tribe
. despite the professor ' s wishes
, the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows
, due iin greatest part to veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, an overly vivacious
(
and voluptuous
) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery
and basicly deems herself krippendorf ' s main assitant
. hungry for recognition
, micelli sets up interviews
, lectures
, etc
. inthe an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history
, a sure fire way tothe go down in the history books
. krippendorf
, on the other hand
, is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor
, not in history books
,
and with each new lecture
, he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe
- mating habits
, domestic structure
, etc
. thru fumbling improvisation
,
and oftenly smoe quick thinking from his oldest son
, krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture
,
but only creates more
and more interest in the highly unique tribe
. on the opposing end is krippendorf ' s arch rival
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
, an arogent professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non
- existent tribe
. it ' s a cute idea
,
and approached with a mroe subtle
(
and mature
) style
, krippendorf ' s tribe could ' ve beeen a real winner
. sadly
, the mostly
- misfired toilet humor
, overly comical musical score
( by bruce broughton
)
,
and sugar coated sentiments
( all the key ingredients of a
" family comedy
"
) just aren ' t the right tone for this film
. cut that crap out
, add some razor sharp dialogue
and witty sociological perceptions
and you ' ve got a good start
. at the state it ' s in now
, you ' ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs
. doubtfire meets dumb
& dumber
,
and that ' s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious tothe try
. tje overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of
" average
"
, with a few laugh
- outloud
- loud moments
adn a great big gap in between them
. most of the charactors are surprisingly two
- dimensional
,
and the only noe who seems to exhibit any real acting effort
( lyonne
) seems to go greatly unappreciated
. director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways
. it ' s stuck in limbo between disney family fare
( jungle 2 jungle
)
and potentially hilarious adult comedy
( a fish called wanda
)
. it ' s this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade
,
and it ' s a brutal drop
. a strong warning to parents
: forget tjhe impression given by advertisements
, do you want to take your kids to a film that hasnt a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely becasue she ' s holding his penis
? yes
, it ' s put that bluntly
! just be warned
- this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film
,
and others might nto be as tame
.
