among multitude of erotic thrillers
, thgat hadnt been released in the early 1990s
, woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty
, star of the b
- grade action films of the previous decade
. those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason inspite the type ofthe movies that made ginty the star
. as director
, ginty did very little to improve that impression
. the protagonist of the movie is jack
( played by jeff fahey
)
, yacht skipper thta falls madly in love with christina ford
( played by bo derek
)
.
however
, she hasnt relationship with rich
anbd powerful jonathan ashby
( steven bauer
)
. one stormy night
, the tragedy occurs
and jack is accused of rape
and murder
.
however
, his good friend walter j
. hill
( robert mitchum
) happens tothe be very good lawyer
, so jack might even proove his innocence inthe the end
. belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama tahn erotic thriller
, woman ofthe desire distinguishes itself from similar films by hvaing almost all characters behaving like total idiots
. unfortunately
, this film isn ' t comedy
and any laff is unintentional
. the characters are totally antipathetic
and irritating
and soon we stop carring what owudl happen tothe them
. the actors taht play them don ' t help either
. that is especially the case with jeff fahey
, whose jack isnt so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison
. his partner bo derek
, on the other hand
, shows that she didn ' t age enough to cease being the sex goddess
,
but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents
. ginty
, on the other hand
, tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks
and strange angles of shooting
,
but infront the end it gets only irritating to the already bored
and dissatisfied viewer
.
