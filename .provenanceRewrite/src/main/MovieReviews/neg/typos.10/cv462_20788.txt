in double jeopardy
, the stakes are high
. think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy
,
and
then rearrange the details
and the gender of the stalker
. the finished product
,
altough able to maintain the viewer ' s attention
, is a predictable
and unexciting thriller wtih an idiotic script
.

.
. ' libby parsons
( ashley judd
) is a happily married mom leading a normal life
. one nihgt
, her husband nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat
. libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood
and nick hasnt strangely disappeared
. she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck
, where she handles a falled knife
( like any stupid character
)
and is spotted by the coast guard
, who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening
. nick is presumed dead
,
and
although she pleads her innocence
, libby is tried
and convicted for the murder of her husband
. now
, please don ' t thikn i ' m spoiling any vital plot details
, because the informative trailer has already spilt most of the beans
. if you haven ' t seen thsi preview
, don ' t read any further
.
but seriously
, the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg
and douglas s
. cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters
. during the most vital scenes in the movie
, i ws anticipating every twist or
` surprize ' that eventually popped up on the screen
. i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy isnt a vyre naive group of individuals
. most
, unfortunately
, will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production
. one is tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison
. jones isnt always wonderful as an authority figure
,
and he ' s certainly familiar with this sort of role
( as he played so well in the fugitive
and us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin with gusto
, also has a chance to flex her acting abilities
. while emotionally unconvincing
, tghe actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role
, perking up the movie like an injection of anti
- depressant
. the actors
,
and their relationship together
, present the one
- twpo punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely
.
and now
, back to teh plot
. while behind bars
, libby learns an interesting little bit of information
: a person can ' t be convicted of the same crime twice
. this law
, called
` double jeopardy '
, could be her motive for hunting down her husband
.
.
. who may still be alive
. yes
, you heard right
. the movie degenerates into a cross
- country chase
, where everything yuo expect to happen
.
.
. does
. the fianl scenes
, which could ahve redeemed the film
, are poorly handled by director bruce beresford
- whose previous owrk centers highly around drama
( driving miss daisy
, paradise road
)
. ironically
, it is those elements
- liek the driving force of libby to reunite with her son
- that don ' t quite work here
. at least duble jeopardy is paced well enough tothe satisfy diehard fans of the two stars
. unfortunately
, jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard infact the fugitive
,
and the real depth of his character is only skin deep
.
bu he
and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material
,
adn both have some memorable comic moments
. judd
, in particular
, has a hilarious scene iin which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her
` parole officer '
. hmmm
.
.
. perhaps this would have made a good comedy
. it is disappointing
, becuase there are the makings of a compitent action film here
. it ' s nicely shot
and choreographed in downtown vancouver
,
and will entertain those who aren ' t turned off by the woeful story
- line
.
? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn ' t fool most children
.
