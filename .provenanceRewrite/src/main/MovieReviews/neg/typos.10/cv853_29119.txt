it ' s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise
. the movei is lacking
and most unsatisfying
. osmosis jones is crude
, gross
, disgusting
,
and wass directed by the farrelly brothers
- the twisted siblings behind there ' s something about mary
, me
, myself
and irene
and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt
. not that there ' s anything wrong with scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor
- such as it ws
. it ' s merely that with osmosis jones
, tyhe farrellys humor isnt too juvenile
, too predictable
. you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn
. osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho
. thte trouble is
, the animation may please the very young
,
bu tje jokes may be over their heads
, while the teen
- age audeince may find it too tame for thier tastes
. adults
? well
, let ' s just sday most will find it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays like a 100
- minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby
. the live action sequences revolve around frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe
. he continually looks as if he needs a shave
and a showfer
. frank
, much to the consternation of his daughter
, is a fast
- food addict
, eating anything
-
and everything
- that can kill you
. he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner
-
and presumably smell better
- tahn he does
. frank ' s body is invaded by thrax
, a leathal virus
, after frank eats a hard
- boiled egg that had fallen to the ground
. it ' s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt
and plops it into his mouth
. nope
, the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg
, wresting it from the primate ' s mouth
. like i said
, the gross meter tips the scales on this one
. aftter ingesting the egg
, the movie beggins its animated sequences
. here
, osmosis jones
( voiced by chris rock
)
, a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix
( voiced by frasier ' s david hyde pierce
)
, a 12
- hour
, painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax
( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne
)
. basically
, what we have is a cliched cop
- buddy movie
, rife with all the clich
? s of that genre
.
and this is why osmosis jones doesn ' t click
. it merely falls back on tired
, familiar conventions instead of creating newyorker
and exciting situations
. the jokes
annd puns are lame
: osmosis searches out a snitch
, a former flu virus
. after pumping him for information
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn ' t look fluish
.
"
annd the jokes don ' t rise above that level
. the live action scenes are no better
. frank is such a slob
, so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child
. he ' s almost a bigger cartoon tahn the animated characters
. osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns
and dissolves blood cells right
and left
. the animation is rather two
- dimesnional
and flat
. it lacks scope
and depth
. it isnt an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head
,
and mabye leaning toward a shower after you walk outloud of the theater
.
