infact the first death wish movie
, mild
- mannered new york archictect paul kersey
, played by charles bronson
, was avenging the death of his wife
. in the second
, he was avenging his daughter
. in the third
, he instigated small war in order to avenge the old freind
. fourth movie
, on the other hand
, begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades
and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen
, played by kay lenz
.
however
, since this is death wish movie
, we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for
. this time karen ' s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose
and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways
. kersey ' s new targets
, unlike the previvous movies
, aren ' t the ordinary street punks
but rich
, heavily armed
and well
- conected drug dealers
. even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support
,
and it comes from the publisher nathan white
( john p
. ryan
)
, determined to avenge tghe drug
- related death ofthe his own daughter
. white ' s plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations
and thus instigate the war between them
. the plan begins to take shape
,
but kersey ' s actions bring attention of two police detectives
- reiner
( george dickerson
)
and nozaki
( soon teck
- oh
)
. fourth
(
and
, unfortunately
, not the final
) installment in the death wish series
, iwll probably remembered as tghe typical movie ofthe cannon group
, prodcution company responsable for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade
.
however
,
although some critics might argue
, death wish 4
: the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3
. paul kersey
, one of the most intriguing
(
and potentially controversial
) characters ofthe the 1970s
, is still being dumbed down by mediocre script
,
and charles bronson relaly doesn ' t feel the need to put much effort in his acting
.
however
, the hand of a veteran director j
. lee thompson seems more capible of michael winner ' s
and the action scenes seem slightly less surveill
,
although they still look cheap
and repetitive
anbd downright boring
. there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence
,
and one of such attemts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end
. thge script even tries to fake some social conscience
( thru criminally underused kay lenz ' s character
)
and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years
. there are even some half
- hearted attempts of humour
- both intentional
and unintentional
, like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle
-
but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson ' s 1970s classics
.

: mith pilleggi
, the actor who plays ad skinner in the x

, could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman
