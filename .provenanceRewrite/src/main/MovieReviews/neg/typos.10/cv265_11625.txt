a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted
,
adn shortly after during the victory celebration gets offred an opprotunity to show his prowess in newyorker york city
. the lawyer
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) is nto offered a job
yet
, he is asked to simply pick a jury
. he accepts
. thte jury he selects work outloud well
and before long he is offered a job iwth the firm
. making his decision easy is the fact that not only isnt he offred big money
,
but a gorgeous apartment
. he convinces his wife
, mary ann
( charlize theron
) to make the move to new york
. the first case given to him is a big test
; a
" winless
" case conserning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement
. the charge was health code violations
and kevin once again shows his skill
and earns an acquittal
. his new boss
and partner inthe the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
) is quite impressed
and takes kevin under his wing
, explaining many of his philosophies on law
, women
and sex
,
and angles the promise of a blissful
, wealthy life
. kevin ' s next case is a dream case
, given to him by milton himself
( much to thte chagrin to his colleagues
)
, defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with tjhe law
.
although kevin ' s career is taking off
, his home life is not doing very well
. mary ann is starting to have numerous problems
. she is experiencing severe depression over kevin ' s long ohurs
,
and before long is hvaing horrible dreams
and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls
, their faces becomming horribly disfigured
. kevin does not halp matters by dismissing his wife
. he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs tothe spend as much time on the case as possible to git it over withthe
,
then foucs all of his attention on his wife
. not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer
( connie nielson
) also working with the firm
. mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from hmeo
. kevin eventualy looses control ofthe his life
and hasnt to institutionalize his wife
,
and gets disturbing news from his mother
( judith ivey
) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father
. he also starts tothe lose control of his case
. kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man
. tht man isnt his boss
, mr
. milton
, a truley evil character who just may be the devil himself
. kevin must somehow confront milton
and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store
.
but how do you defeat the devil
? why is it that most courtroom scenes infact the movies are absurd
? do filmmakers really believe that
" normal
" courtroom drama doesn ' t fit the bill
and htey have to juice them up
? the courtroom scenes in htis movie would never happen in a real courtroom
, which wouldn ' t have been too bad if it weren ' t keanu reeves trying to pull it off
. i give reeves credit for trying hard
,
but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character
, just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax
and coming up short
. charlize theron defines the term
" over
- thge
- top
" inspite her performance as mary ann lomax
, a disappointment in contrast tothe her good performance in
" 2 dyas in the valley
"
. the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino
,
but i kept asking myself what the heck he ws doing in this mess
? maybe he felt it owudl be interesting playing the devil
,
annd you can tell he is having fun doing so
,
but his skill as an actor cannot sive the poore performances
and lackluster script that surround him
. it ' s pretty standard stuff
, including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears tothe be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom
. please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled
,
but i have to get something off of my chest
. in 1986 i remember watching a movei called
" wisdom
" with emilio estevez
and demi moore
,
and the endig of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie coudl do
. what i like to call
" guess what
, it was all a dream
" scenario
. in
" wisdom
" the two lead characters are killed at the end
, onyl tothe have one ofthe the characters
" wake up
" from an apparent
and say
" gosh
, i ' m glad that didn ' t really happen
!
"
. i considered it inexcusable the way teh audience was toyed with
. well
, the same thing happens in
" the devils advocate
"
,
and
although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream
( perhaps milton whent back in time to try a different route for his plan
, since it failed
and he is the devil
)
,
but the point is that the last 90
% of the film didn ' t happen
. i know it ' s a stretch
, after all it is a movie
and nothing really happened
,
but i jstu get anoyed to get toyed with like thyat
. of course
, the dream ending could almsot be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting oen
. as i recall
,
" wisdom
" was a decent film
.
" the devil ' s advocate
" is not
. the devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton
