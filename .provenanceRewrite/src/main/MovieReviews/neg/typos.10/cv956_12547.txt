godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the
" who cares about plot
" summer movie
. a loose remake of the 1954
" classic
" japanese monster movie
, godzilla
, king of the monsters
( which is itself pretty thin in the story department
)
, roland emmerich
and dean devlin ' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan disaster flick hasnt been written with the brain dead in mind
. the script isn ' t just
" dumbed down
,
" it ' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives
and dies on special effects alone
. presumably
, the primary target group for this film is teenage boys
, the demographic most likely to shell out
$ 7 repeteadly to see the same images of monster
- instigated carnage
. that ' s nto to say that females
and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction
; they ' re just nto as readily susceptible
. this is tyhe third straight movie in a row where emmerich
and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer
- generated visuals is far more importamt for making money than the ability to write
and direct for actors
. stargate was a financial success
. independence day was a runaway hit
.
and
, wih godzilla already drowning in hype
and merchandising tie
- ins before it even opens
, it ' s virtually guaranteed at least
$ 100 million
. nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not
- too
- precocious grade school kid
. godzilla isn ' t completely without merit
,
although it is close
. there ' s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan
,
but it wears off quickly
. frankly
, while the special effects are compitent
, they ' re not all that stunning
. there ' s nothing new here
; it ' s jurassic park meets aliens
, with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure
. maybe it iwll recquire george lucas
and his new star wars movie to take computer
- generated visuals to the next level
. godzilla never really pushes thge envelope
, preferring to remain within a comfort zone
. the immagination ofthe monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass
, formulaic approach which disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been choosen to close the 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst of all
, godzilla isn ' t even exciting
. witht the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end
, there isn ' t a sequence in this film that raises yhe pulse
. even the scenes with dozens of aircaft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension
and suspense that tehy are yawn
- provoking
. independence day may have been dumb
,
but it was full of
" adrenaline moments
" capable of getting the audience involved in the action
. in this aspect of its prodcution
, as in so many others
, godzilla is lacking
. actually
, part of tje probelm is that we ' re never sure who we ' re supposed to be rooting for
: the green monster with an attitude or the paper
- thin humans trying to stop him
. the plot
, such as it is
, can be summed uv rather simply
. after sinking a few ships
and leaving some footprints on tropical islands
, godzilla shows up in the big apple
. he does some of the usual tourist things
: stops by madison square garden
, visits the chrysler building
, goes on a walk through central park
,
and takes the subway
. in the proccess
, he knocks over a few buildings
and steps onthe countless cabs
,
but he never has trouble with trafic jams
. on hand to stop him is an elite u
. s
. army unit
, led by a slightly less
- arrogant
- than
- usual military man
( kevin dunn
)
and a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who has a theory about godzilla
. inthe his opinion
, the big guy isnt actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific
. in nick ' s words
, godzilla is
" a mutated aberration
? an incipient creature
? the first of its kind
.
" as luck would have it
, nick ' s old girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, is a reporter based at a new york tv station
. along with her cameraman friend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides to follow nick arund as he trails godzilla
.
then
, jsut when the military hasnt rejected nick ' s theory about why godzilla is in new york
, a memeber of the french secret sevice
( jean reno
) recruits him for a special assignment
. instead of stomping around tokyo this time
, godzilla has chosen new york city
. unfortunately
, manhattan has been destroyed so many times in receet disaster movies
( independence day
, deep inpact
, armageddon
) that it ' s becoming boring
. the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong
,
bu the big ape was only about 30 feet tall
. he could climb the empire state building
. at ten times that heihgt
, godzilla would be more likely to knock it over
. godzilla contains a few lame attemts at humor
. there ' s an ongoing feud between animal
and his wife that plays like sit
- com material
, an unfunny
and repetitive gag about how noone one can pronounce nick ' s last name properly
,
and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert
and gene siskel
. both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film
:
" ebert
,
" the mayor of new york
, is plyed by michael lerner
,
and
" gene
"
( lorry goldman
) is his campaign manager
. ebert ' s re
- election slogan is
, not surprisingly
,
" thumbs up forthe new york
.
" yhe siskel
/ ebert stuff is amusing the first time it ' s used
,
but
, after a while
, it grows tiresome
.
and
,
although the
" characters
" don ' t serve any real purpose
, they keep popping up
. godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast
. this is largely because emmerich doesn ' t wnat to risk a human peformance upstaging his lizard
. thgat ' s not to say that matthew broderick
and jean reno aren ' t capable of good performances
( both have done their share of solid acting in the past
)
,
but they aren ' t a
- list names
.
then again
, considering the quality ofthe the writting
, even pacino
and deniro would have been hard
- pressed to shine
. maria pitillo
( dear god
) plays the love interest
and hank azaria
( great expectations
) is on hand tothe presnt what is supposed tothe be comic relief
. ultimately
, it doesn ' t really matter what i
( or any other critic
, for that matter
) have to say about the movie
. tristar has assumed that godzilla
, liek all self
- proclaimed summer event motion pictures
, is pretty much critic
- proof
. it may allso be word
- ofthe
- mouth
- proof
. those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say
. so
, when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one ofthe the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time
, it ' s like spitting inot the wind
. emmerich
and devlin are master illusionists
, waving their wands
and mesmerizing audiences withthe thier smoke
and mirrors
. it ' s probably too much to hope that soem day
, movie
- goers will wake up
and realize that they ' ve been had
.
