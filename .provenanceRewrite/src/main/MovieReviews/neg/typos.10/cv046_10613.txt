all through its production
and into the early days of its initial
, aborted pre
- release publicity
, hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood
. ultimately
,
however
, paramount pictures
, nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 ' s other
, underperforming disaster films
( dante ' s peak
, volcano
)
, changed thte title
and shifted the release date by nearly a year
.
but
, to paraphrase the bard
, swill
, by any other name
, woudl smell as rank
. no number of name changes can help this picture
. it ' s not just about a disaster
, it is a disaster
. hard rain is thge case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute
. the best shot occurs during the opening credits
, as the camera pans over the streets
and byways of huntingburg
, indiana as the water level slowly rises
. the community
, protected by an overworked dam
, is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud
- choked skies
. from that moment on
, it ' s all downhill
. whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point
. it takes forever tothe get to the end credits
-
- this is one of tghe longest
- seeming 95
- minute motion pictures i have recently endured
. basically
, hard rain is one extended
, dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot
- outs
. there ' s a lot of water
, broken glass
, gunfire
,
and explosions
. it ' s all vyre routine
and uninteresting because there aren ' t any real characters
anbd the plot only occasionally makes sence
. the film ' s conclusion is so preposterous that it ' s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around
. acation films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion
. graham yost
, tghe writer ofthe both speed
and hard rain
, surely understands that principle
. unfortunately
, neither he
, nor cinematographer
- turned
- director mikael salomon
( a far off place
)
, applies it
. the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition
. we see the smae kinds of things
-
- speedboat chases
, flood damage
, shoot
- outs
, etc
.
-
- over
adn over agian
. the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length
. the storyline gives us a number of paper
- thin characters in contrived circumstances
. there ' s tom
( christian slater
)
, the one
- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash
. he
and his partner
, charlie
( edward asner
, tv ' s
" lou grant
"
)
, get stuck on a street that ' s rapidly turning into a river
. a group of men
, led by jimmy
( morgan freeman
)
, arrive on the scene not as rescuers
but as robbers
. after charlie is killed in a shoot
- out
, tom hides the money
,
then runs
. as he swims
and boats his way through huntingburg ' s roads
, he encounters some ofthe the locals
: karen
( minnie driver
)
, a would
- be love interest
; a bickering old couple
( richard dysart
and betty white
)
, who are on hand to provide comic relief
;
adn the easily
- corrupted sheriff
( randy quaid
)
, whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives
. there isn ' t any real acting in this film
. christian slater utters a few lame one
- liners
and does a lot of mugging for the camera
. tom is easily one ofthe the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen
. randy quaid sneers a lot
,
and is totally unconvincing
. morgan freeman
and minnie driver both attempt tothe give ligitamate performances
,
but they are defeated by the script
. freeman
, one of the best cinematic thespians working todya
, looks suitably embarrassed to be here
,
but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck ffrom time
- to
- time
. following in the wake of twister
, this is
yet another natural disaster movie thyat doesn ' t trust nature ' s fury as hte chief engine of conflict
. as a result
, we are saddled with an idiotic good guys
/ bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could haev had
. titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water
. hard rain successfully demonstrates thta the opposite is equally possible
. thus far this year
, hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire
( firestorm
)
and water
( hard rain
)
. fortunately
, there are only twpo elements left
.
