what dont you get when you rip
- off good movies like woody allen ' s bananas
and martin scorsese ' s after hours
? you ' d think you ' d get the best of both films
. instead you get woo
. falling in somewhere between def jam ' s how to be a player
( which was awful
)
and booty call
( which was ok
)
, woo is
yet another inspite the embarassing genre of showing african
- americans to be nothing omre than sexual buffoons
. the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes out on a blind date with straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. for some unkown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts up with all of woo ' s antics fo the entire night
, which include her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing things from his house
, violently questioning him
( accusing
and belittling him actually
) about previous girlfriends
, causing a riot in an elegant restuarant
,
and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn ' t tolerate
.
but for the sake of thsi bad movei
? sure
, why not
? there are a few chuckles in the film
, the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas
. in this case
, davidson is running from thugs
, gets into a subway car as the doors are closing
, starts to taunt the thugs
,
thn the doors open back up again
. a good joke
,
but a stolen one
. another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams ' cameo as himself
. movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so
,
and not one of them has ever been a hit
. woo won ' t be one either
. so why ws it made
?
and more importantly
, isn ' t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive
? everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point
.
