a movie laced with a good blend of action
, comedy
,
and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet
,
but even the best ingredients cant be thrown together in the wrong way
, creating a dismal
and unsatisfactory product
. eighteen yeras after the blues brothers hit theaters
, blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed
, minus half of its original duo
( the lite john belushi
)
and nearly all of its original charm
. dan aykroyd reprises his role
( as well as his co
- writing credit
) as elwood blues
, the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self
- proclaimed
" mission ffrom god
" along wiht his brother jake
and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago
. as we begin
, elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother ' s death in prison eyars ago
. completely on his pwn
, elwood decides tothe trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood
, onyl to dicover that everyone he hasnt ever known has passed away
.
but elwood isn ' t completelyl without family
. it seems he has a half
- brother of sorts
- not a real brother mind ytou
, just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo
- father curtis
( cab calloway from the first film
)
, who has also passed on
. despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
) to do otherwise
, elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an affort to start up an all new blues brothers band
. working as a police commander
, cabel chamberlain
( joe morton
)
, has an immdiate disliking for elwood
, who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother ' s affair years ago
and
then goes on to steal his awllet
. folowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, who quickly learns to become a mini
- elwood
. when bartender mighty mack mcteer
( john goodman
) joins teh group
, the blues brothers band is complete
,
and once again
, the group travels the country
, crashing cars
, blowing thigsn up
,
and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock
. meanwhile
, cab ' s personal vendetta aganist elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next
- to
- next
- of
- kin
.
> from this point
, the movei turns into a series ofthe music videos with a few bits of acting in beetwen
. those hoping for an interesting
adn
/ or funny yern are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story
. only the extemely avid blues fans shouldnt attept getting thru theese two housr
. for those people
, it may be worth it
, for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting
,
but when the story doens intrude upon the festivities
, the film is heavily bogged down witht unfunny jokes
, musicians turned stiff actors
,
and the pointless 10
- year
- ood buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing
. appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin
, james brown
, eric clapton
,
and a whole slew ofthe others are the high points of the film
,
but they also confirm why these people are musicians
and not actors
. blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really
, really love this kind of music
, you might kind of
, sort of like this movie
. many
, many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny
,
and if you don ' t have a passion fo vrey deep blues
/ rock
, yuo ' ll be bored out of your skull
. much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd ' s self
- serving vanity project
,
but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with thsi
, none of the excitement is passed on to the audiance
.
anbd seeing three guys in three
- piece suits goofily dancing arround with poker faces can only be funny forthe so long
. unfortunately
, those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes inot the film
.
