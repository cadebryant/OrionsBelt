talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters
! spice world is the feature film debut of the pre
- fabricated pop band
, the spice girls
. it ' s intended as a sort of hard day ' s night
,
but ends up simply hard to watch
. when watching the spice girls
, i ' m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick
( such as from the smurfs
, the snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) infront which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk
and a different name
. the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles
,
and about as talented
. there ' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, the brainy one
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, the athletic one
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, the childish one
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, the fashion
- conscious one
,
and sacry
( melanie brown
)
, the noe with a tongue pierced back so far you ' re almost certain the post sticks out her throat
. the film itself doesn ' t realy have a plot
. it follows the girls as they travel here
and ther
, culminating at their
" frist live performance
" at albert hall
. the action
,
howver
, seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas
. teh various misfires include
: an alien encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck tjhe spice girls
, the shooting ofthe a spice girls documentary
, a movie producer
( george wendt
) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie
( nearly all of wich
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up
)
, a meeting with a pregnant friend
( whose sole purpose seems tothe be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd
.
.
. even whn they start to sing
)
,
and an assorted number ofthe musical performances
, press conferences
,
annd general all
- around celebrity stuff
. whew
. for some reason
, the film is littered with star cameos
. from elton john to elvis costello
, from bob hoskins tothe meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows up
,
though he can ' t deside if he ' s parodying himself as james bond
, or if he ' s lobbying to be the reincarnation ofthe ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant has the largest secondary part
, a thankless role of hte band ' s manager
, clifford
. the celebrity spotting isnt partially amusing
,
and a decent way to pass the time wehn confronted with the rest of the film
. neither amusing or spontaneous
, when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring
. their songs are alright
,
but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos
. my advice to fans is
: stay home
and watch that video collection
, or at least spin that cd a cuple of mroe times
.
.
. eather option iwll be more enjoyable than the film
. non
- fans shoudl know to stay well away fomr this one
