synopsis
: a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high
- school student tothe spy on his girlfriend
, who is babysitting threee unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night
. while this is going on
, the thug
, the father
, the boyfriend
,
and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies baout the babysitter
. comments
: to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement
. i ' m not sure wqat writer
and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter
. suspense
? family drama
? humor
? erotica
? elements of each of theese genres exist in the film
,
yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them
. instead
, the babysitter is a dull
, lifeless movei which manages to bore
and ultimately iritate its viewers
. i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren ' t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer
, the babysitter
. her character has absolutely no depth at all
,
and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters ' fantasies
. everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends
. tjhe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds
. the father
( played by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes about hte babysitter
; the mother fantasizes about her husband ' s best friend
. none ofthe theese fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are things that need to be seen
,
but we see them anyway
, complete with cheesy
, make
- out saxophone music
. the thug
, in the meantime
, proves that he ' s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half
- empty beer bottles all of a sudden
and for no apparent reason
. the most absurd character
,
however
, is the babysitter ' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. the thug
, in a manipulative
, iago
- like manner
(
though he doesn ' t really need to try hard
)
, manages to talk the boyfriend into binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, running away from cops
,
and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend inwhich a matter of minutes
. incredible
!
( of course
, tjhe boyfriend ' s original plan fo the evening was
, try not to laugh
, to sit in an empty diner
adn read catcher in the rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful
,
then it fails
. there are suprizingly few tense moments in this film
,
and nearly all of them come at the final minute
. by that time
,
however
, the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them
. no suspense occurs in hte dream sequences either becouse eveyr single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception
. if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous
,
then it also fails
. i found nothing even remotely funny baout the boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, to be played for laughs
. if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic
,
then
, once again
, it fails
. the characters are one
- dimensional
and uninteresting
. finally
, if yhe goal of the babysitter was to be titillating
( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning
)
,
then it fails as well
. the dream sequences aren ' t erotic
; htey are too brief
adn
, outside of one very short scene
, contain no nudity
. i can ' t completely trash this movie
. the first 10 mintues or so vaguely resemble an interesting film
,
and the conclusion sportscar a halfway decent fistfight
. the other 79 minutes
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone ' s character
, at yhe end of the movie
, turns to her boyfriend
and asks
" what were you thinking
?
" i asked myself the same question
, having spent 99 cents renting this turkey
.
