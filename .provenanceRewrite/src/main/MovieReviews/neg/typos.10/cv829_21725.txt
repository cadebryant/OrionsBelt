i had an epiphany todya
. it occurred to me while i was watching
" house on haunted hill
.
" it is as follows
: if a trailer makes the film it ' s advertising look like a trashy
, stupid movie
, well guess what
? chances are
, there
* is
* truth in advertising
. too bad i didn ' t trust my own instincts when something
- or
- the
- otehr possessed me to see this movie
. i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare
annd my anticipation of
" sleepy hollow
.
" that
annd
" dogma
" started too late in the afternoon forthe my scedule
. an hour of
" angel
" or
" buffy
" is scarier than this doosy that tries to be scary
and shtick
but falls flat on its face
. i wish i ' d seen it when it was halloween
. at least i owudl have been forgiving
. hey
, tis tyhe season
. the movei was scary
( albeit very confusing
, dizzying
,
and nauseating
) at first
,
bu soon the horror got repetitive
and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn ' t going anywhere
. nowe i truly appreciate films like
" scream
,
"
" halloween
,
" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems ffrom situations that are at least somewhat realistic
. tht ' s what spooks people out
, the fact that it could happn tothe them or someone they know
. there has to be a logical precedent for tje situations they want to scare us with
. sure
, utterly unpredictable is good
, too
,
but that ' s different from utterly nonsensical
. hohh
( house on haunted hill
)
, on the other hand
.
.
. well let ' s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when tehy oh
- so
- cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago
. riiiiight
. y ' know
, that just sends chills down my spine
. yeah
. just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil
. ooooooo
. hint
: blood
and guts only work a few times
. sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it ' s just ketchup
and props
and you ' ve got to come uv with something better than that
. there were just too many things in this movie that we ' ve all seen before
; from the inevitable
" plot developments
" ofthe strangers unwittingly trapped together
; strangers turning against each other
; the evil manifesting itself
; the dead coming back for a last scare
. eahc was more predictable than the last
. why didn ' t these fools just stay together inthe one place anyways
? sheesh
. was i grossed out
? yes
. did i get spooked a few times
? yes
.
but why
? i get really disturbed when there is no why
. when there weren ' t random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect
( which wasn ' t taht good either
, trust me
)
and the scare
, the film was filled with drab
, laughable dialogue
. the characters were incredibly flat
and cliched
. not to mention downright annoying
. you ' ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives
; of course htey ' re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night
. jeez
, i thought no one fell for those
" you may already be a winner
" thigns anymore
.
and of course
, all three gals are babes
. i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush ofthe
" shine
" ended up in this movei
. keep that up
, geoff
,
and you ' ll qualify for tghe next batman venture
. the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because
, well
, he just cracks me up
.
and famke jansen
( sp
?
) because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan
. pierce brosnan
( hey
, i willingly endured
" dante ' s peak
" three times for him
:
)
. all right
, i concede
. there were a couple of things i enjoyed
. that perverted little amusement park at the beginnig
. i probably won ' t ride a rollercoaster for a while
.
and the machine they used to drive geoffrey ' s character mad
( see
, i don ' t even remember their names
)
. the machine
, not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin inaddition it
. i kept waiting
and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end ofthe the movie
. it wouldn ' t have redeemed the film
,
but at least it woudl have made me feel better
.
but noone
, they opted for the beatiful sunrise ending
. thank god they didn ' t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked
. god
, there is noone hope
.
