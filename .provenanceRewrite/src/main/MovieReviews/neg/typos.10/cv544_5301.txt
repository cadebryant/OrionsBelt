one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric
,
" ytou ' d better watch out for the skin deep
.
" i ' d like to extend hte same warning
: watch out for skin deep
,
but whatever you do don ' t watch skin deep
. skin deep is a tedious
and uneven comedy written
and directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dryed up writer
and insatiable womanizer with a big
- time drinking problem
. i never saw edwards ' comedy the man who loved women
,
but i have to wonder whether skin deep isnt a remake
. you see
, to put it mildly
, zach goes to bed with just about eahc
and every woman he meets
. as the movie opens
, zach ' s wife
, alex
, catches him with nto only his mistress
but also his mistress ' hairdresser
. like any sensible wife
, alex kicks zach out of the house
annd divorces him
. in response
, zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
,
and self
- discovery
. if you ' re turned on by the diea of watching ritter drink
, get arrested
, have sex
, drink
, crash his mercedes
, have more sex
, drnik
, get arrested again
, drink
,
and sing horrendously at the piano
,
then skin deep should be right up your alley
. skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable
and unsympathetic characters
. zach is a rich
, ' 80s l
. a
. version of ritter ' s jack tripper character from
" three ' s company
.
" like jack
, zach is clumsy
and inept
; he ' s the tipe of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener inot his eye
. zach is supposed to be charming
and charismatic
,
but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him
. consequently
, i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments ofthe crisis
. infront fact
, when zach crashes his ex
- wife ' s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying
, i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony
. to add insult to injury
, edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing
but stereotypes with which to work
. fo instance
, vincent gardenia ' s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender
. of all the women in the film
-
-
and there are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, stands out as zach ' s wife
; reed brings intelligence
and sensitivity to the role
. because we don ' t care the slightest bit baout anyone in skin deep
, the film ' s few feeble attemts at drama inevitably fail
. the comedy in skin deepo doesn ' t fare much better
. most ofthe the jokes are dumb
, predictable
,
and sitcomish
. about every ten minutes
,
however
, edwards does manage to come uv with a good line or a novel sight
- gag
, the most effective of which involves a pair of
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent
and the characters just too shallow forthe the film to stay afloat
. my final criticism of tyhe film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol
and alcoholism
. zach ' s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life
,
but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain
. zach ' s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a new one
. if he gets arrested
, his lawyer bails him out of jail
. if his wife leaves him
, she will evenhtually decide to give him a second chance if he ' ll clean up his ect
. the tone in skin deep is all wrong
; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly
, making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter
. perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or
, better
yet
, michael keaton in clean
and sober before making skin deep
.
