kate
( jennifer aniston
) is having some problems
. it appears the twenty
- eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder
,
and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired
. she learns that her problems are related
, as the owner of her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company
. her freedom would make her more likely tothe leave the comany
, taking clients with her
. a solution presents itself in nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence
and gets photographed with
. kate ' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate
and nick
. kate is at first repulsed by the idea
,
but after getting immediate positive results
, she pursues it
. her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan
. the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc
?
. at a dinner with kate ' s bosses he wiull provoke a fight
anbd they will break up
. she meets nick to propose the plan
. he accepts
. kate ' s new status brings unexpected results in other areas
. the office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn ' t give kate the time ofthe day
, now does
. now that she is engaged
, he pursues an affair with her
, as doing so would destroy her good girl image
, hence sam ' s sudden interest
. things start to fall apart for kate
, as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her
,
anbd does not wish to break up with her
. after some provoking nick doens oblige
,
but problems continue for kate
. it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available
. or maeby kate does like nick
,
but
" reconciliation
" will force her to admit her lies to her employer
. adding tothe her mess is the constant prying of her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who wants her tothe get married
and settle down
. htere is a scene iin this movie where jennifer aniston is
( from the waist uv
) onyl wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movei when she actually wears one
. there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer
. it ' s like the directer said ' well
, we know the stoyr is formulaic
and the performances aren ' t that great so
, what the heck
, let ' s show jennifer ' s assets as often
and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating
.
" quite frankly it ' s insulting
. i don ' t think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie
. she did a decent enough job in ed burns '
" she ' s tjhe one
" becouse it was a smaller
and supporting role
,
and she just doesn ' t deliver tyhe goods effectively in this movie
. her performance was not convincing
. unfortunately
, as far as romantic comedies go
, this movie adds nothing new to the standard forumla for these types of movies
. the film is similar to
" my best friends wedding
" in a sense that the leading female character is acually quite vindictive
and due her actions
, gets no sympathy from me when thigns go awry
. i didn ' t care forthe how quickly kate puts down nick ' s proffesion by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn ' t glamorous enough for her co
- workers
. at least
" my best firends wedding
" changed the formula a bit
and had a somewhat surprise ending
. no such luck with
" picture perfect
"
. every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away
, including a cuple that really made no sense
. after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company
, why would she blindly throw it all away when she should haev made sure that nick would even talk to her first
, let alone consider a relationship
? was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick
? throw in the fact that i don ' t think nick
and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision
. i believ that kate liekd him
,
but liked him so intensely that she ws willing tothe throw her career away
? i doubt it
.
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it nessecary to stop everything
and stare at the couple
? are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers
? well
, i guess of thte congregation consists of movei extras
and the strangers are yhe movies two lead stars
,
then that would make sense
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
