" practical magic
,
" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented
and high
- profile actors would even get involved in an embarassing clap
- trap like this one
. the film stars sandra bullock
and nicole kidman as sally
and gillian owens
, two sisters whose family comes ffrom a long line of witches
, spanning back 200 years
. at tyhe strat
, their parents die when they are still children
,
and they go to live with their two zany aunts
( stockard channing
and dianne wiest
)
. switch to the present day
, gillian
, who is the stronger
, more rebellious sibling
, leaves home
,
and meets up with a dark
, abusive guy
( goran visjnic
)
, while sally stays infact their hometown
, meets
and falls in love with a sweet
, caring man
, has two children
,
and
then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck
and killed
( come to think of it
, she ' s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes
)
. when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic
, they accidentally murder him
,
and in desperation
, bury tyhe body in the backyard of their aunts ' house
. add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising
and an exorcism
, not to mention a spattering of
" light
- hearted whimsy
,
"
and you have a pretty good idea how messy
" practical magic
" is
. after seeing the film
, i reflected thta there was not even one scene
, or element
, that i liked or enjoyed
. it is a comedy
, to be sure
,
but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat
,
and the ocasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching
. it is not charming or entertaining inspite any way
.
and
then to top it off
, we ' ve got this dark
,
bu bird
- brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian ' s body
. whatever
. the cahracters are handled terribly
,
and actually
, most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be whta you could call a character
. htere isnt no reason why channing
and wiest should have decided tothe be in this film
,
and in every scene involving them
, they are always standing side
- by
- side
. no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people
. tje same goes for aidan quinn
, as a handsome police investigator
, who has the misfortune of being tyhe romantic lead oposite bullock
, even
though he comes into it at arround the 70
- minute mark
,
anbd once again
, there is noone attempt to develope their relationship
, or his character
, in any way
. in fact
, every line ofthe dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along
, rather tahn getting to know the peple saying the lines
. i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits
, when i found out the screenplay was written by hte deeply hated akiva goldsman
, who managed to destroy hte
" batman
" series with
" batman forever
"
and
" batman
and robin
.
"
" practial magic
" is directed by griffin dunne
, primarily an actor
, who last year made hte contrived
, clumsy romance
,
" addicted to love
,
" with meg ryan
and matthew broderick
. i disliked that movie quite a bited
,
but since
" practial magic
" is even worse
, that can only give yuo a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is
. i ' d tell him to quit while he ' s ahead
,
but in theese last two years
, he ' s ultimately already buried himself
.
