the tagline for this film is
:
" some houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn ' t expect too much from this
.
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre
. i thougth
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
adn jan de bont
. i thought
, mabe it will be fun
?
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing
.
but by the end of it i thought
: why liam neeson
and cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality
. here is the sotry
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill house
, visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor
( liam neeson
) into bieng guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise ofthe an insomnia investigation
. among them is a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
and a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. acutally
, tyhe doctor is researching the
" primordial fear reaction
"
and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects
and watch wqat happens
.
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes liuke a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains
.
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real
, placing an emotional wall between audience
and screen
. the second half of the film is basically baout the main heroine running back
and forth from tje sinister lamps
and evil furniture
. is that exciting or what
? the worst thnig about it is that it didn ' t have to be bad
. it ' s based on a great book
,
`
` the haunting of hill house
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptions of the book was scary
and intelligent
. it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, that cost less than an old car
, managed to shock
and terrify the audiences from their senses
.
and with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror
. de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line witht the material that it is
, in itself
, frightening
. he is the master of the extravagant special effect
and thte big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a more serious material
? in the end
" haunting
" will only haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont ' s career as a director
.
yot it wouldn ' t be fair to say that everything is bad
. the effects are truly impressive
and the house is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautiful
, mysterious
, magical
and spooky
.
but this is where the good things end
. the music is blaring
, the floors moving
, the ceiling morphing
and thge pictures on the walls screaming
-
-
and all of this
, every second
, every moment of screen time
, is absolutely without life
. it ' s nothing more than a special effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn ' t engage
. at firt you do not know what ' s going on
. is thsi part of the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoia
?
but in tyhe end it shows out that this is actually happening
. the house is acutally possessed
. it is at that point whn all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out ofthe the window
. for ever
, i sat in anticipation for a decent climax
and that ' s what i got
? i believe hichock once said that
" it ' s better to wait for a climax
, thna to see one
"
. this may be true
,
and it might actually work
,
but there is only one problem
-
- jan de bont is not hichock
and tghe things that he shows are not scry
, only stupid
. they are impossible tothe take seriously
. any paralells that you might have heard before
, linking this picture to kubrick ' s
" the shineing
"
, are absolutely baseless
.
" shining
" had class
, style
, story
, acting
,
but most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" has only special effects
and art direction to boast of
.
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film
. casting ogod actors for small
, pale parts onyl makes things worse
.
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write
, most of you will see this film anyway
, even if the tagline would say
:
" some films are just born stupid
"
.
