actually
, i ' m fairly sure the experience of hvaing my flesh torn
and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie
.
" baywatch
" babe pamela anderson lee proves once
and for all that she should keep her double
- d ' s on the small screen
. at least there you don ' t have to pay to see her cleavage
.
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money forthe this movie in hopes ofthe seeing pam topless
, hate to burst your bubble
,
but there are no full
- fledged nude scenes in barb wire
. you wouldn ' t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in
. i can ' t go back in time
and reverse my mistake
,
but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there
. they do tease us a few times with scenes where ytou almost see her topless
bu if she is nude
, it ' s so quick you cin ' t even tell for sure whether you ' re seeing her andersons or nto
. a nipple hallucination sort of thign
. barb wire was adapted from a comic book
, interesting because pamela is probablly the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life
, even wearing low
- cut leather to do office work
( businesswoman bondage wear
)
and having unreal body proportions
. yes
, like the mona lisa
, pamela anderson is a man
- made beauty
, probably in more senses than one
. she is a definite beauty
,
though
,
and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience
. you ' d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn ' t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie
, because it ' s obvious she wasn ' t pulling a sharon stone
and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills
. i mean
, she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler ' s convention
. the movie is set in the year 2017
,
" the worst year of my life
,
" pam says
.
(
" the worst movie of the yera
,
" i say
.
) america is going through a second civil war
and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation
( silicone valley
, i think
)
. she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right
, posing as first a stripper
anbd later as a prostitute
.
but don ' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates that
,
and reminds us of that fact way too many times
. imagine
, a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn ' t have tothe hear words like
" babe
" during a strip tease
, especially since that movie baout tjhe talking pig was such a success
. the plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves arund a pair of contact lenses that allow theri wearer to pass through the congressional directorate ' s retina scanners
. in thte words of one of the characters
, they ' re
" mroe than meets tje eye
.
" reminds me of the
" transformers
" cartoon
,
and i sure wished the movie could somehow be tranformed into something decent
,
but that never happened
. no
, the movie just continued on its path ofthe lame action scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
,
and her resistance accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
)
annd cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god they didn ' t name her cora reef
. one bad charactor name is mroe tahn enough
. pamela originally doesn ' t take sides
, giving some speech about she ' s only loyal to the money they pay her
,
but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy of bon jovi
" always
" video fame
. i still don ' t knwo if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy
,
but he definitely is nose worthy
( even if he isn ' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi
- automatic weapons
and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest
. it ' s not rambo
.
.
. it ' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire iwll be all over the cinemax network in a year
. it ' s got all the elements of the direct
- to
- video releases featured on hbo ' s bastard cousin
, the cable channel i ' d never watch if it didn ' t somehow come free
. it ' s got the non
- titillating scenes of voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue
and action cliches out the wazzoo
. there ' s even a narrator at tjhe beginning setting uv thge movie ' s premise while the words scroll up tyhe screen
. someone needs to tell pamela the wookie tihs ain ' t star wars
. if you ' ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years
, you ' ll recognize plenty of lifted elements
. barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
and slow
- motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feets to their death
. tihs is one of those automatic
- pilot movies anyone sould rwite or direct
. barb wire has only two things going for it
.
.
.
and i think you know what thsoe two things are
.
