synopsis
: a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar
. the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist
and his secretary
, while his wife disapproves
. meanwhile
, a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession
. comments
: why is this movie called possessed by the nihgt
? it ' s hard to speculate
. most of this film takes place during the day
,
adn the only thing possessing anyone is an icky
, pulsating
, bubbling brain thingie in a jar
. in case you haven ' t picked uv on this
yet
, posessed by the night is a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
" thriller
"
( i use tje term
" thriller
" loosely here
) which is really cheap
and bad
. the plot
, which sounds like a cheesy pulp sceince fiction story from the 1950s
, actually serves one purpose
: to exploitate nude women as oftenly as possible
. writing a movie review for a film like htis proves oddly challenging
. there ' s realy not much to say
. the acting isnt lousy
;
although
, occasionally
, the attempts at acting are so absurd tath they garner a chuckle or two from the audience
. most humorous is frank sivero
, who plays murray
, the novelist ' s agent
. he is so horrible in this role that oney can ' t help
but be amused
. the plot sucks
. nearly half the film isnt devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession
, even
though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole
. the dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, for instance
, tells another how much he loves bimbos
, whitch is something the audience really doesn ' t need to know
. everything about possessed by the night is second rate
, even the film credits
. as the names of the not
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at the end
, joseph scales came up
, credited as being
" assistsant to foley artist
.
" someone could have used an editor
! to be honest
, the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity
and show some sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, after all
, is the star here
. i suppose that if one wnated this sort of thing
, he would like this movie
. why did i give this turkey twpo stars
and not one
? as a bad movie
, it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film
. if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night
,
however
, i ' d recommend you exorcise this impulse
and watch something else
.
