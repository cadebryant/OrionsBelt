if you ' re into watching near on two hurs ofthe bored
, foul
- mouthed florida teens having sex
, doing drugs
, having sex
, listening to eminem
, having sex
, playing video games
, hvaing sex
,
and killing one of their peers
,
then
" bully
" ' s for you
. based on jim schutze ' s novelization of a true
- life event
,
" bully
" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who
, in 1993
, murdered their high school bully in cold
, calculated blood
. the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned theese aimless kids into premeditated killers
. in the hands of controversial director larry clark
(
" kids
"
)
,
however
, it has less to say about its subject matter
annd mroe to say about the filmmaker ' s pornographic proclivities
. in terms of the incident
and what provoked it
,
" bully
" stirs up nothing new
. the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot
-
- borde with life
, not much ambition
, promiscuous
, profane
. the bully in question
, bobby kent
( nick stahl
)
, is certainly an unpleasant piece of work
but he doesn ' t exactly tower over his colleagues in thge pathological department
. he hounds
and harries
and humiliates his
" best friend
" marty
( played by brad renfro
)
and marty ' s girlfriend lisa
( rachel miner
) doesn ' t care for it at all
and comes up with the idea of killing bobby
. simply remove him from the equation
. marty
and lisa
and a handful of their promiscuous
, profane
,
adn stoner friends
, plus a recruited hitted man
(
?
)
, lure bobby tothe a swamp one night
, stab him
, beat him over the head with a baseball bat
,
and dum him into thte canal where the sand crabs
and the gators
, presumably
, finish him off
. there ' s no remorse
-
- the next day they ' re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment
. they did it beccause they wanted to
,
and because htey could
. wqat ' s most troubling about the film
,
however
, isn ' t the unsettling subject matter
adn the matter
- ofthe
- fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own
but yhe way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material
. not only is the nudity plentiful
and graphic in
" bully
"
bu there ' s also an uneasy
, exploitative efel to it
. gratuitous crotch shots abound
( one of which makes the zipper cut
- away in
" there ' s something about mary
" look like the height of subtlety
!
)
. clark is so pre
- occupied wih his female
( predominantly
) leads that ytou forget
, at times
, what this movie is suposed to be about
. the stripping bare
, literally
and figuratively
, of these actors
( who are
, after all
, playing underage teenagers
) becomes harder tothe watch over time
, as you begin to feel for them
and question the motives of the man behind tje camera
. hte conclusion of
" bully
" offers uv literal snapshots ofthe information about the sentences imposed on each of tyhe protagonists for thier involvement in the crime
. it ' s a short sequence of stills
-
- heather
: 7 years
; ali
: 40 years
; lisa
: life imprisonment
, for example
-
-
but it ' s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes ofthe rampant unpleasantness tath precedes it
.
" bully
" aims for truth
, exploits it shamelessly
,
then bludgeons it to death
.
