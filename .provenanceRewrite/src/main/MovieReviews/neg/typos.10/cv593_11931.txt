back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book
and cience fiction convention
, new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big
- screen update of the cult 1960s sci
- fi tv show lost in space
, complete with in
- person appearances by cast members mimi rogers
, matt leblanc
, lacey chabert
, jack johnson
,
and even gary oldman
. that should have set off my warning alarms
-
- the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago
, when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in
- person cameo to peddle
.
.
. last action hero
.
bu no
, like millions of others
, i bought into the hype
and
" got lost
.
" if only i had gotten lost
-
- literally
-
- on the way to theatre
annd spared mysef the tedium of this sloppily slapped
- together blockbuster wannabe
. you may find yourself wondering if directer stephen hopkins
and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when tehy made the film
. at the convention
, goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television sories
,
annd if that really is the case
, i ' d hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in
. to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with
-
- which there most certainly is not
. after the setup
, in which the robinson family
-
- father john
( william hurt
, looking
and sounding as spaced outloud as he does in interviews
)
, mother maureen
( rogers
, wasted
)
, daughters judy
( heather graham
, ditto
)
and penny
( a heavily made
- uv chabert
, looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things
)
,
and son will
( young newcomer johnson
, making the best of it
)
-
-
and pilot don west
( leblanc
, doing a bad han solo impression
) fidn themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr
. smith
( a watered
- down
but still
- lively oldman
, cashing a paycheck
adn loving every minute
)
, the script ' s
" stream
" ofthe events becomes so fragmented
and random that it seems tothe be made up as it goes along
-
-
and hopkins doens little to mkea what does go on the slightest bit interesting
. they encounter anyother ship
. htey board it
. aline spiders attack them
. they return to their ship
. the other one explodes
. they land on a deserted planet
.
and so on
. an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act
,
but goldsman doesn ' t seem to understand the rules that come wtih using such a story device
; when one character ' s past self dies
, thge future incarnation inexplicably lives on
. the look
and effects should be lost in spoace ' s ace
- in
- the
- hole
,
but hopkins even manages to botch that
. for a big
- budget film
, the visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. in one composite background shooted
, i could see the blue outline arround oldman
; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like
.
.
. digital effects
.
but nothing in those shots is as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- like space creature that becomes penny ' s pet
. entirely computer
- generated
and every inch showing it
, blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game
. apparently hopkins thought the same
and tried desperately to hide it
; how else cant one explain the graininess of blawp ' s composite shots with the human actors
?
but in doing so
, the seams are that much more obvious
. you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny
and blawp is immediately folowed by a crystal
- clera solo reaction shot of judy
. new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long
- running star trek cash cow at paramount
. i don ' t think so
. in a few years
, the lost in space movie will likely live on nto as a series
bu as tghe obscure answer to a trivia question
: what film ended titanic ' s 15
- week reign at the top of the weekend box office
?
