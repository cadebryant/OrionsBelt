based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard ofthe before this movie
( be hapyp
, i won ' t bore you with any lame
and unnecessary comparisons
)
, this film allows will smith to tkae a third stab at the independence day weekend box
- office
, after scoring huge succcesses with men in black
( 7
/ 10
)
, directed by the same man who controlled thsi oney
,
and independence day
( 6
/ 10
)
. can you say
.
.
. the third times not a charm
? plot
: james west
and artemus gordon are chosen by tyhe president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping ofthe the nation ' s top scientists
,
and threatening to take over the untied states withing a week
. critique
: i did not laugh once during this entire picture
. when you consider thgat this film is a part
- comedy
, tht ' s not a very good sign
. i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more thna a few minutes time to think bakc tothe tje lovely salma hayek scenes
. when you consider that the other
" part
" of this film is geared as an action
/ adventure
, i would say that this another negitive sign
.
and when yuo consider that yhe first hour of the film was boring
and a little slow
, the story
- line tired
, riminicent of swiss cheese
and uninvolving
,
and the speshal effects interesting
but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one
- liners
, weak characterizations
and an anti
- climactic end
, you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this
" big
" summer blockbuster
. it blows
. or as they sday in french
,
" eet blows
"
. could it be that the script was crappy because it took four peopel to wriet it
? maybe
. could it be that most of the special effects don ' t show uv until the last half hour
,
and even
then
, we don ' t see anything that its trailers hadn ' t already given away
? perhaps
. or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith
and hollywood big
- budget movies
, that we cannot help
but evaluate them on a scale onto their own
? naaaaaaah
! a bad movie is a bad movie
. on a positive note
, i coudl honestly say that i did vyer much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek
, who seemed underused
( in my humble opinion
)
,
and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in
. branagh was also fun as the scenery
- munching
, over
- the
- top bad guy
,
but that ' s pretty much where the entertainment
- buck stopped
. smith
and kline were static at best
, the plot full of holes
,
and the scroe insignificant
and derivative of a dozen others
. i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie
.
then again
, there is that one scene with tghe lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage
.
.
. huh
.
.
. oh yeah
,
but the rest ofthe the movie sucked
. little known facts about this film
