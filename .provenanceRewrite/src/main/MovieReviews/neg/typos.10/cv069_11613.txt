the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped uv in multiplexes
, with everything ranging fomr
" l
. a
. confidential
" to
" palmetto
" to
" the big lebowski
,
" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran
, talented directors
. with this particular genre
, directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower
- class
adn tyhe glamorous
, opulent upper
- class
, hwile maintaining the noirish
, ambiguous ambience
, the staple of film noir
.
" wild things
" could be classified as a black comedy
, a sultry film noir or a plain ol ' erotic thriller
,
but the one category it doesn ' t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture
. overacted
, overwrought
and overlong
,
" wild things
" is a confused mess
, a movie that wants to have its cake
and eat it too
. with its incalculable twists
, turns
, more twists
and more turns
, it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness
. inspite spite of game efforts by kevin bacon
and matt dillon
, who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal
,
" wild things
" not once jells in its eroticism
, unpredictability
, character motivation
, sense of the world
, plot
, etc
. there ' s not one redeeming quality in the picture that isnt not technical
. directed by john mcnaughton
(
" henry
: portrait of a serial killer
"
)
,
" wild thigsn
" follows sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a hunkish
, suburban florida high school teacher who ' s the dream of every spruced up female in the community
. particularly one
. kelly van ryan
( denise richards
) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner
. soon
, her tiny shorts are soaked
and tells the otehr girl to take a hike
, enabling her to come into his house
. next thing
, she cries rape
.
and the so
- called
" roller
- coaster ride
" ensues
. a second accuser comes front
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, a booze
- drinkin '
, tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo ofthe sexually molesting her
, virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions
, asinine occurrences
and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen
. even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo ' s zany lawyer
. he wears a fake neck
- brace
, waves the finger at the other client
and infuses the script with soem billy murray
. you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role
. as ridiculous as it sounds
, he ' s the most sane charactor in the movie
. the comunity is astonished
. reporters flee to the scene
. htere ' s an 8
. 5
- million settlement for a libel suit against kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
. there ' s the ambiguous cop
( kevin bacon
, who also exectuive produced
) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit
, muder
and lust
. we
, the audience
, sniff something nto so lustful
. like so many thrillers these days
, including
" the usual suspects
"
and
" the game
,
"
" wild things
" eschews character for plot
. mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera
,
and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease
, as if he knows the territory he ' s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany
" henry
,
" a furious
, unsettling film directorial tour
- de
- force
. george clinton ' s score is a delight to behold
.
but it ' s the humans
. the characters are mere devices for the
" nasty
" twists
. what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving
, almost unbearable
, if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting
, don ' t fiel real or we don ' t care for them
. not even the unintentionally funny moments work
. the people in
" wild things
" are not so much people as they are caricatures
.
thn there ' s the erotic content
, which nearly earned the film an nc
- 17
, for a sexless
, badly edited
, poorly lit menage
- a
- trois
.
adn in what has to be one ofthe thte most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country
, kevin bacon ' s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go
. ironically
, the wildest elements ofthe
" wild things
" are not wild at all
.
