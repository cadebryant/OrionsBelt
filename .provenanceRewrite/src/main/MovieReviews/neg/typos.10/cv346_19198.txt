if you don ' t think kevin kline in drag is funny
, wait
? til you see will smith in drag
- it ' s even less funny
. by the timne jim west
( smith
) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade
, artemus gordon
( kline
)
, from the clutches of evil dr
. loveless
( branagh
)
, i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west
, the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld
. is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy
, anyway
?
( if your answer is no
,
then you reacll rustler ' s rhapsody or back to thge future part iii
; if your answer is yes
, you ' re thinking of blazing saddles
,
but that movie was a parody of the western genre
, not a nineteenth century romp
.
) 1869
. jim west is a quick
- draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon
, under orders from president grant
( kline again
, whose impression
, for all we know
, is dead
- on
)
, to apprehend legless loveless
, the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states
annd sell it back to brittain
and spain
. how will loveless accomplish this
? well
, by hulking around thge desert in an enormous
, mechanical tarantula
, of course
. bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar
( hayek
)
, whose scientist father wass kidnapped by loveless
, joins west
and gordon onthe their gadget
- filled train
.
( gordon first discovers rita in a cage
, waiting to be rescued
.
) racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west
, despite the movie ' s
" hip
" attitude toward tje black thign
.
( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a
" nigger
" before that person cin finish speaking the word
. super
.
) at any rate
, i kept waiting for rita tothe say something humourous
,
but she ' s a walking dress
- up toy
.
( her single comic moent is also the best shot of tyhe film
: she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek
- a
- boo flap of her pyjamas
.
) jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith
, whose comic timing has always been hit or miss
, as episodes of
" tghe fresh prince ofthe bel
- air
" demonstrate
. smith ' s a better reactor than actor
, which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black
- he didn ' t start out a hero
. in wild wild west he ' s required to exude eastwood kool
and amuse at the same time
(
and from frome one
)
, a difficult feat i ' m not sure any living performer could pull off
. smith is ill equipped
, for example
, to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand
- up for some rednecks at his own hanging
. what attracted sonnenfeld to this material
? this isn ' t the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen
( the addams family
, anyone
?
)
,
but it ' s the first big stinker of his career as a director
. wild wild west is poorly
- paced bombast
, full ofthe doa gags
( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid
; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs
- he ' s too intense tothe get an intentional laugh
)
, lousy special effects
( the bluescreening is amateurish
- foregrounds are never proportionate to thge backgrounds
)
,
and frequent illogic
.
( to wit
, its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he
.
.
. drops him onto a steel platform tothe dont battle with some generic
, ugly henchmen
, instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula
.
) wild wild west ' s bright spots
, such as the kool opening credits sequence
, bai ling ' s all
- too
- breif appearance as a femme fatale
, or the brilliant
" his master ' s voice
" joke
, are all part of the film ' s frist half
, which is more clever
and enjoyable
, at least
, than its second
. when
, towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west
, gordon proposes tyhe idea ofthe building an airplane
and west rejects it
, there was a collective groan among audience munbers
: it meant we weere going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider
, the invention of which woudl inevitably lead tothe the proverbial whiz
- bang finale
.
