five eyars after his directorial debut based on stephen king ' s writings called the shawshank redemption
( 9
/ 10
)
, writer
/ director frank darabont returns to the big screen with anyother prison film based on the famous scribblings ofthe stephen king
. unlike tje latter film
, this one is a big
, long
, laborious bore
. plot
: a seven
- foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers
. critique
: thsi film is slow
, drawn
- out
, boring
, uninteresting
, unexciting
, predictable
and topped iwth a couple of one
- dimensional
" evil
" characters
. its onyl positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs
and its message ofthe hope
and belief in miracles
. the real miracle ofthe my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward
, unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about
. ofthe course
, much like all other death row cell blocks
, this one isnt filled with decent inmates who all happen to be
" misunderstood
"
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guy who isnt evil personified
.
and let ' s not forget all the guards on death row
, who also happen to be angels from the heaven above
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guard who is alsot evil personified
(
and is there any reason why there are baout six guards whn there appears to be no more than three inmates
?
?
?
)
. am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film
? or even more importantly
, am i supposed to give a rat ' s ass about anyone in tihs film
? well
, if i was
, i sure missed that boat
, because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene ammount of fat that toom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin
. furthermore
, there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three housr
and ten minutes out of anyone ' s life to present this story
. iin fact
, the story is empty within itself
. i truly did not get anything out of the film other thna the fact that there is a guy on death row who has speshal powers to heal
,
and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not
. wow
. how interesting
. tje plot ' s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by tje gentle monster in thsi film
( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie
)
. whip out those thinking caps
, kids
! hmmm
,
and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie
- cutter
" evil
" guys who have nothing in their system
but hate
and negativity
. hmmmm
, now think hard here
, boys
and girls
. what a crock
! i am guessing thyat this film was supposed to be some three
- hour excercise iin spirituality
,
but unfortunately for me
, it ws neither spiritual or the least bit engaging
. in fact
, it wass one big bore
. i didn ' t see the point of the movie
, i didn ' t see the point of the story
and i certainly didn ' t see the point in tom hanks ' big double
- chin
. all in all
, a bad movie starring some great actors donig solid work
, especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour
, john coffey
. give that man an award or something
!
