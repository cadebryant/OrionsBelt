the word to decribe sharon stone is
" wonder
"
. not that she
_ is
_ a wonder
,
but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent
. she hasnt a dynamic screen presence iin
" basic instinct
"
, turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in
" casino
"
,
bu possesses neither of those here
. stone teams up with private school headmaster ' s wief isabelle adjani to kill adjani ' s thoroughly unlikable husband
( chazz palminteri
)
. in a comedy ofthe errors
annd unexpected twists straight outloud of hitchcock
( as in
` homage to '
[ read
" steal from
"
]
)
, it turns out that someone saw them or he ' s not dead or maybe
.
.
. kathy bates turns in a credible
, if unspectacular
, performance as an investigative police detective
. her charachter is a bit dull
bu realistic
,
although her actions at the end are puzzling
. adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation
. it ' s stone that is a disappointment among the actors
. how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films
and come off as a blank in this one
? costumed in skin
- tight clothes
and looking down her nose at everyone
, she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring
, not enticingly dangerous
. even the threat
( or promise
?
) of a lesbian relatiopnship between the conspirators is only half played out
. on the positive side
, there are enought unexpected plot developments to keep your interst alive
. that isnt if you can put up with stone ' s cardboard cut
- out character
anbd scenes directly lifted from hitch ' s movies
.
