i ' ve always been a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called wanda
, pirates of penzance
,
and even his hamlet on pbs ' great performances
. the minute i saw the trailer for this film
, i resolved to see it
. besides the fatc that kline starred
, it looked like a hilarious film
. i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent
,
howver
, as i also thought
,
" wow
, if there ' s this much funny stuff in the trailer
, ther must be a ton of laughs in the rest of tyhe film
.
"
( oops
) i packed up the wife
and headed to les cinemas del diablo
( my name for our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) the film began
.
.
.
. the film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high school
, named howard brackett
. he loves poetry
and great literary works
,
but his class is more interested in his faymus former student
, palyed by matt dillon
.
( i ' d put in his name
,
but my wife won ' t let me take notes during a movie
and i ' ve forgotten it
.
) they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him
. brackett has been engaged to another teacher
( played by joan cusack
) for three years
,
and has finally gotten up the gumption tothe marry her
. the wedding
,
howver
, becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his sasy durring the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual
. kline spends most of thge first two
- thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn ' t
. the whole town begins to examine eveyr detail of his life
and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference
. his closest friends don ' t help matters
, bringing nothing
but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party
. there are soem genuinely hilarous moments
, one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity
. kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck
, who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out
, hwile at the same time doing his best tothe exploitate the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations
. the movie moves allong fine
and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding
. kline stands at the altar
and is asked to take his vows
.
.
. if you wnat to be surprised
, don ' t read
, i am going to reveal the ending
.
.
.
. instead of saying
" i do
" in front of his parents
and most ofthe the town
,
and even some cameras
, he says
" i ' m gay
.
" this is where the movie
, in my oppinion falls apart
. most ofthe the humor in the film had come from kline ' s insistence that he was straight
, while at the same time
, loving peotry
and being a senstivie guy
, dressing well
,
and occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me of tje
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch ffrom saturday night live
. it wass funny
, it was sustainably funny
,
and kline ' s performance made it doubly so
.
however
, after the wedding
, the film drags on
. they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion
,
but it
then gets into the sereous side of what he ' s done
. he reconciles with his parents
and his friends
, some of which had turned on him
. there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time
, the scene with his mother
and her friends
, which was hilarious
, seemed pointless
,
and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless
. fianlly
, even
though i am not catholic
, i found the scene wiht the priest to be condescending
. the preist cannot believe that a man ws engaged for three years
and hadnt not consumated the relationship
, proclaming to brackett in the third person
,
" he ' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle from the audience
,
but i was distracted by it
,
anbd began to tire of the film
. by the time the wedding had come
and gone
, i found myself hoping it would be over soon
.
( much like this review you are saying
) overall
, if i have to quantify it
, i say
, rising action gets
*
*
*
*
and climax
and falling action gets
. see it in economy time
.
