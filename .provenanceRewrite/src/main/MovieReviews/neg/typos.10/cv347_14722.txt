if yuo have ever seen fox tv ' s special car chase programs
, you ' ll have a good idea about the content of ronin
, the new action
" thriller
" from director john frankenheimer
. tyhe film involves a mysterious briefcase
, that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands onthe
. an irish women
, dierdre
( played by the truman show ' s natascha mcelhone
)
, hires a group of mercenaries tothe assist her in getting the briefcase
. among the people she hires are sam
( robert de niro
)
, vincent
( jean reno
)
,
and gregor
( stellan skarsg
? rd from good will hunting
)
. dierdre ' s groups assignment is too seize the briefcase hwile the current owners are transporting it
. they acompish this task
,
but a traitor is in the bunch
and the briefcase is soon onthe the run again
. the briefcase stays on the run
, as the movie leads tje viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed
. the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie
,
but failed to understand that just because there are surprises
, it doesn ' t add too the credibility of a senseless script
. the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on
, after tje apparent climax of the film
.
bu to add to the excitement
, as i mentioned earlier
, there are endless car chase scenes
. they are unrealistic
and fail to add anything to the story
. don ' t get me wrong
, i love car chases
,
but they were overdone
and too long here
. we never do find out what ' s in the briefcase
,
but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting thru this two hour long attempted thriller
.
