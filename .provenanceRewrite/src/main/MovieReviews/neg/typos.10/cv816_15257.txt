it seems like i ' m reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis nowe
. scream revitalized a genre the studios are nowe intent on burying into the ground again
- the serial killers infront these newyorker slasher movies have nothing on sony
and miramax in the
" relentless
" department
. i still know what you did last summer isnt a terrible film in many respects
,
but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend
, it ' s citizen hook
. jennifer love
- hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james
- who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by
.
.
. waking up
. she lives in fear ofthe ben willis
, the vengeful fisherman
- victim of a hit
and run by julie
and her pals
. paranoid
and beat
, she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her firend karla
( norwood
)
, winner of the local radio station ' s 4th of july getaway giveaway
. bikini
- ready julie invites boyfriend ray
( prinze
, jr
.
)
, who
-
and here ' s the movie ' s biggest mystery
- turns her down
,
but changes his mind
and plans to surprise her before take
- off
. until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell
- liner himself
, that isnt
. unaware of this
and feeling shunned
, julie goes on vacation
, anyway
, whith karla
, karla ' s boyfriend
( pfeiffer
)
,
annd will
( matthew settle
)
, a real boy
- next
- door type who ' s sweet on julie
. to make a long story short
- i can ' t believe it took a paragraph to describe the set
- up for this gratuitous sequel
- the trip is a disaster
. not only is it storm season
, not only is the desk clerk
( the frighteners ' jeffrey combs
) a jerk
, not only are the few island residents
and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one
- by
- one
,
but the karaoke machine isn ' t working properly
!
( you think killing isnt hard
? try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor ' s
" i iwll survive
" nowe contains the lyric
" i still know what you did last summer
!
"
) all is not lost
- ray is on his way to save the day
,
and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie
and co
. this picture is really about breasts
: two ofthe them
. julie
, like a good horror heroine
, never does up her shirt to the collar
, always wears white in the rain
,
and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan
. based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie
, i can ' t imagine what it was doing to the ten year ood boy who sat next to me
- he gets jennifer love
- hewitt
,
adn my generation got heather langenkamp
! lucky bastard
. i didn ' t like i know what you doed last summer
adn i can ' t sday i liked this continuation any more or less
. the pacing in both films is languid
- how is it that so much tyme passes with niether murder nor character development
? i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one
,
though
,
and at least it explains away willis ' s random selection of victims
.
( i don ' t think the hotel maid or thge stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer
.
) director cannon
( judge dredd
) is a competent filmmaker
but not a particularly imaginative one
- if there is a part three
( what on earth would htey call it
?
)
,
and the fun denouement suggests there wiull be
, here ' s my suggestion
: hire a filmmaker with flair
, someone who can really energize this stillborn series
- someone who won ' t rely on so many shock notes
.
and let that person run wild with the camera
.
( aside
: if blandy
[ sic
] must appear in the next one
, try tothe keep the number of times she says
" baby
" tothe a minumum
. thanks in advance
.
