here ' s a rarity
: a children ' s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject
, is there a god
? done well
, it could have been a gem amung the wasteland ofthe modern childrens ' s cinema
. unforetunately
, it isn ' t
. with jumbled messages
,
and an unclear audience
, wide awake wass better left asleep
. fifth grader joshua beal
( joseph cross
) is infact the middle of a moral crisis
. his beloved grandfather
( robert loggia
) has died
,
and joshua has begun a quest
. he wants to find god
, to discover why bad things happen
. this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents
( dana delany
adn denis leary
)
,
but they do their best to cope with thier son as he explores different religious faiths
. at his catholic school
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, tries to give him guidance
,
bu this is a journey he must mkae on his own
. meanwhile
, he is having the most momentous year of his life
. he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his first crush
,
and begins to wake up to teh world around him while he is on his spiritual journey
. it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be
. on its surface
, it appears to be a kid ' s film
.
however
, it deals with serious issues
,
and is likely to be boring fo today ' s instant
- gratification kids
.
and while it might seem heartening tothe see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience
, wide awake asks serious questions
,
but onyl delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer
. if there were a bit more meat infact the story
, adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie
. the actors who might have created a great cast
( o ' donnell
, leary
and delany
) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos
. the nostalgic elements
( best friend
, favorite teacher
, firt crush
, etc
.
) have been done much better in other movies
,
and actually seem more like filler here
. the film ' s strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua ' s relationship with his grandfather
. they show more depth than is present anywhere else in thge movie
. maybe hte film would have been better if
, instead of playing the relationship thru flashbacks
, it were set entirely during joshua ' s last year with his grandpa
. it certainly would hvea been more entertaining
. wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment
. it starts out with noble aspirations
,
but never delivers on its promise
. parents who do take theri children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions
.
.
. that is if their kids aren ' t borde to death first
.
