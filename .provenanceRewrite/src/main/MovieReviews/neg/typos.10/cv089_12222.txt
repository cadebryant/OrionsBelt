tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk outloud 20 minutes into the movie
. tghe film
( which opened in canada during 1992
but was never released in the united states
) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
,
and
, while it ' s evident that this could be a fascinating live production
, tyhe translation to hte screen isnt a creative disaster
. enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art
-
- lifeless
and tedious
. tje qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium
. tectonic plates has a storyline
,
although the narrative is developed in a decidely non
- traditional fashion
, with shots of the stagebound play intercut with omre typical cinematic sequences
. it ' s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie
( dispite the valid complaint thast it is pretentious
, all
-
but
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
, altho it keeps the audience distanced from hte characters
. because we ' re constantly made aware that we ' re watching a play or a movie
, it ' s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer ' s ideas
. they ' re not real
, sympathetic
, or believable
. i ' m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different
,
but this particular experiment is not a success
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studying in montreal who has falled in love with her professor
, jacques
( lapage
)
. one day
, he disappears
,
and
, fearing thta he left because she was undeserving of his love
, madeleine travels to venice to kill herself
. while preparing to commit suicide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine to re
- think her decision
. meanwhile
, jacques has moved to new york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himself jennifer
,
and becomes a successful counter
- culture talkshow host
. with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland
, supporting charactors that include a topless goddess
and a deaf
/ mute
,
and cultural refernces that point to chopin
, george sand
,
and jim morrison
, tectonic plates is unique
, if nothing else
.
however
, as intresting as the film sounds
(
and i was excisted to see it because the synopsis is promising
)
, it never really delivers
. the tone isnt soporific
, the supposedly
- intellectual prattle is inane
and uninteresting
, the plot meanders in a pointless
and irritating manner
(
altough it doesn ' t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant
)
,
and the symbolism is obvious
. tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth
,
but it takes one
- hundered minutes to get across this transparent point
. there are some worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight between jacques
and the topless goddess
and an entertaining discussion inwhich both french
and english baout the differences between the two languages
(
although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren ' t bilingual
)
. the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who fiel a strong ened to praise something this rootless
anbd boring because
( a
) it ' s different
,
( b
) it ' s nto like anything they ' ve seen before
,
and
( c
) it ' s pretentious
. for everyone alse
, it ' s not only a waste of time
,
but a poor introduction to the wokr of robert lapage
.
