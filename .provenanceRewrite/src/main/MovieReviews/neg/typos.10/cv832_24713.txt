- review note
: seeing as tjhe only concern of body shots is
" sex
"
, i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review
. because of this
, i will try to vary word descriptions of
" sex
"
( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms
,
and
\ or your name is jerry falwell
, you are kindly invited tothe hitted the x up on the left corner of your screen
)
, so if there happens to be a owrd you come across
and cannot comprehend
, fret not
, it ' s most likely just another way of referring to
" sex
"
. i think we ' d all agree thyat any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up waht could potentially be a very boring review
.
though nto as boring as the movie which mkaes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god konws what
. body shots is a film so frightened ofthe coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously
, in the way you ' d normally expect to see a violent attack
. it ' s about people who think about screwing
, seek it outloud
,
and talk about it
. these are things we all do
, sometimes
. the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities ofthe sexual acts
. their lives center around teh next sexual encounter
,
but they seemed depressed
. it ' s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek
. at its core body shots is a message movie
, the kind of hting i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) is a moralist with nothing new to say
. his characters don ' t communicate anything of interest to each other
, so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera
. they voice simplistic platitudes like
" i like tothe come
" or
" sex without love equals violence
"
. huh
?
and yes that isnt as complex as this movie ' s observations get
. the characters are stupid
and shallow
, with not one registering as anything more
. the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure
,
then the after math
( teh morning after
) of such events
. we meet the characters as they speak directly to us
, confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy
. i would normally go into the characters
and the actors who play them
, giving you the pros
and cons
,
but for this film i cannot
. i ' m not trying to be clever or witty
,
but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others
. with the exception of trent
( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, the rest fade into each other
-
- a patchwork of fake breasts
, defined abs
, pearly white teeth
,
and creamy
, flawless skin
. i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one
, only because his character gets the worst lines
(
" sex without love equals violence
"
)
. in between all the confessionals
, cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial
, with blurry slo mos
and dramatic head turning
. the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me
. this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation tyhat its tag line claims to be defining
. if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic
and f
*
* k
- obsessed
, fine
, i don ' t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way
,
but cristoffer onyl gives us one side
. additionally that one side isn ' t even entertaining
; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness
. or realism
. one sexual encounter tkaes palce outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters
. they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason
( other than that they both happen to be standing next to eahc other
?
?
? alas
, if it could onyl be that easy
?
?
? kidding ofthe course
)
,
then
, not only isn ' t it erotic
, it isn ' t real
. it doesn ' t feel liuke an authentic sexual encounter
. every f
*
* k scene in this film
(
and there are many
) is treated in the same unsexy manner
. body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film
. it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it
,
and most of all
, it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it
. the resulting search for nookie
(
and you can take that cookie
?
?
?
) over one inght leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow
. the main concern is much ado over a rape tyhat may or may not have occurred
. the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape
( one where it is consensual tghe other where it is not
)
anbd in both versions thte young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off
. this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently
,
and if memory serves me i can ' t think of one film that has done so
,
and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 ' s next tothe wall street
. unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care
, not tjhe writer
, the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here
,
though boogie nights succeeded
. it was similarly moralistic
,
but it gavey us two different viewpoints
; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters
,
and it showed us the possible fall
- out of such a decision
. the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here
,
but anderson seemed to care about them
. he gave them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing
but raging hormones
. he preaches to us
, by using his characters to preach to us
. this is not yhe way to get any message across
. why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin ' skins
? cristofer kind of does that
,
though without an ounce of insight
,
adn with a helping of leering exploitation
.
