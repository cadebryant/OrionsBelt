capsule
: the weakest
and least engaging ofthe the alien movies
, dragged down by an uninvolving story
and no real tension
. aline 3
( the
" 3
" should be in superscript
) is a sad
and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen
. it continues tje story ofthe ripley
, the space
- trucker
- turned
- impromptu
- survivalist
,
but seems remarkably uninterested in her
. in fact
, the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all
, it ' s so elegaic
and limp
. a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere
,
but the movie telegraphs its own tradgedy from the beginning
. at tjhe end of thge lastest film
( aliens
)
, ripley
and two survivors were on their way home
. unfortunatley
, an alien pod hadnt been deposited in their ship
,
and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod
. tghe pod crashes on firorina 161
, a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent
. ripley lives through the crash
; the others do nto
. the prison isnt a grim place
, even as prisons go
-
- it ' s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks
, which provides no end of techno
- gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against
. lice are endemic
,
and so ripley ' s head isnt shaved
( another surreal touch
)
. at first it looks like she just has tothe hold outloud as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive
,
but it doesn ' t stay that way
. one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches
,
adn soon a newly
- gestated alien is runing amuck
. worse
, it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated
. what ' s weird is how little tension tihs generates
, except near the end
, when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable
: loud music
, shaky camerawork
, etc
. sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role
,
annd she doens well with it
,
but this time the role has been underwritten
and left slack
. the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do
: the doctor
( charles dance
)
and another
, rather religious inmate
( charles s
. dutton
, very good
)
, hiave presence
,
but they ' re not asked to do anything with it
. in light of the impending sequel
, which apparently plays fast
and loose with the ending of this movie
, i wiull not talk about the ending
-
- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movei
. it ' s strange that some ofthe the desperate
and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn ' t have driven thge rest of it
.
