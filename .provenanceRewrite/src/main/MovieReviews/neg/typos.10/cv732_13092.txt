i think that saying that the x
- files is one ofthe this summer ' s most anticipated films isnt safe
. for five years
,
" the x
- files
" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture
, whose rabid devotion tothe the series rivals that of
" star trak
" fans
. the premise of both the movie
and tje television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal
; fox mulder
( david duchovny
) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid
,
and dana scully
( gillian anderson
) isnt the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder ' s flights of fancy
. outlining the plot of the x
- files movie is virtually impossible
, sicne to be general would result in confusion
,
yet to be specfic would give too much away
. nevertheless
, i will try
.
" the black ooze
,
"
and extraterrestrial
, virus
- like substance isnt threatening earth
. a
" shadow government
" is aware of this
,
but trys to cover
- up the alien existence
. mulder
and scully know
" the truth is out there
,
"
and so try to expose both the invasion
annd the cover
- up
. there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie
: 1
. will those who don ' t watch thte series be able to understand the movie
? yes
. isolated as an individual text
, the x
- files can stand alone
. they have given enough backround for anyone
, familiar with the show or not
, to understand the movie
.
although some of the secondary characters ' histories may confuse the uninitiated
, those characters are not essential to the film
. this is a major problem
: they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance
and
then disappear just as quickly
. why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place
,
and
then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee
? why bring in
" the lone gunmen
,
" three computer geek conspiracy theorists
, for an even briefer appearance
? these characters are recurrent on the serieses
,
and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience
( suggesting their popularity among fans
- actually most of the audience could pass fo
" the lone gunmen
"
)
. still
,
then they vanish just as quickly
. 2
. the television show never gives us any answers
. will the movie actually explane some things
? yes
. in the x
- files we get a fairly complet history of
" the black ooze
,
" what it is
and what it wants
. we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the
" shadow government
.
" there are even some subtle tye
- ins with contemporary ufo
- ology
, includng the
" greys
"
and the roswell crash of 1947
. 3
. is the movie any good
? no
. the x
- files is a dreadful movie
and shows some fundamental problems with writter
/ creator chris carter ' s talents
and the relationship between cinema
and television
. first off
, thge screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy
and cliched
. after approximately forty
- five minutes
( hte length of a television episode minus tyhe commercials
)
, the pace drops to a snail ' s crawl
. not long after that point
, when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series
, we wish he hadnt not
. the explanations are so trite
and ridiculous thta one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much
. i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit
,
but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much
. breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie
-
and listening to other fans leave the cinema
, maybe the series too
. the explanations are not onyl absurd
, they are tired
and unoriginal
. the extraterrestrials breed
and gestate like those from the alien series
,
and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day
. note that the alien movies
, id4
,
and the x
- files are all from 20thcentury fox
- a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i htink
. the x
- files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a televsion series tothe be produced while the series was still running
. in comparing the movie
and television series certian aspects ofthe the respective media emerge
. the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it rised annoyed
and frustrated many people
.
howver
, i rather liked that about the series
. television allows you to impose as much
, or as littel
, meaning on a show as ytou want
. it is the proverbial
" blank screen
" which we project our minds on
. meaning on television is open
and ambiguous
; it isnt the nature of the medium
. cinema
, on the other hand
, isnt the opposite
. it projects onto us the filmmakers mind
. we can
, in some films
, fill the textual gaps ourselves
,
but tyhat allmost never happens in an american film
. meaning
, in cinema
, needs to be self
- contained
and determined
. so
, when the x
- files made taht jump from small to big screen
, carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well
. he did not
. by making explicit
, what teh television show left implicit
, carter reveals the limits of his creativity
and skill
. when they say that
" fans
" make a tv sohw
, it is not far from tjhe truth
. on television
, fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because ther isnt nothing there
. how true that is when we see the
" explicit
" x
- files
- there is nothing there
