welcome to your oh
- so typical sequel
. it tries to be twice as big as it ' s predecessor
,
yot ends up twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. now there ' s an idea
. maybe if the ill
- fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early onthe things may have turned out better
. thte first thing that struck me
.
.
.
and suprised me
, was that the camera work
( for the opening sequence anyway
) was terrible
. looked like teh cameramen were drunk
and kept tripping on thier own feet
.
.
.
.
.
. very different to the original movie
. the characters
? well
, not many of the characters actually
* had
* characters
,
but here ' s a rundown
. annie
, who was the highlight of the the original
, must hve seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie
. why
? because something ' s got to account for her loosing that many iq points
. even
though annie wasn ' t exactly a rocket scientist in speed
, here some of her actions just amke you want tothe beat your head agianst a wall
. for instance
, after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a doorjam so that a group of people can escape noxious gases
- she stands in the middle of the oppening for baout five minutes till someone reminds her that the people cant ' t get ut till she git ' s the chainsaw out of their faces
.
.
.
. bang bang bang in point of fact sandra ' s character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules
, who constantly has tothe be rescued
. jason patric
? all i cin say is bring back keanu
. keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump
.
.
.
but that ' s one more tree stump than jason hasnt
. i don ' t think he changed facial expressions all movie
- jason
, smile for the cameras
!
! now frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. you are
.
.
. bang bang bang
.
. wooden jsut doesn ' t describe this guys performance
,
but it ' ll have to do
. the bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- there ' s a bright move
. how can you go wrong with the star ffrom that acknowledged classic
, body of evidence
?
( yes
, that is sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn ' t start out too bad
.
.
.
.
but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses
. in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage
, even
though he already has the money
and can excape
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
though i ' d like to give this movie a double thumbs down
, there were some nice sequences
. considering the movei cost over 100 million dollars
- yuo ' d hope there ' d be at least a cuple
. the rela eye
- popper for me
, even
though it was given away infront the trailer
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
.
.
.
. was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oel tanker
. this looks terific
and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was
.
.
.
. completely computer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don ' t think i ' ve ever seen a cg model look so real before
. the sequence where jason patric in trying tothe disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific
,
and the only tyme during the entire movei where you get that feeling of
.
.
.
. speed
. this lack
- of
- speed problem affects many sequences
. such as the oil tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it was
-
" oh no
, we ' re going to hit the oil tanker
!
"
, 20 minutes later
-
" oh no
, we ' re goign tothe hitted the oil tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. you get the point
. this movie failed simply because it didn ' t live up to it ' s nmae
.
.
.
. there was very littel feeling of speed
. iin hte original movie
, the lead characters had to make split second decisions tothe survive
.
.
.
.
. in this movei it felt more like
-
" well people
, we ' re gonna run into that there island in a few hours
- i tihkn i might stroll over to engineering
and see if i cin ' t turn off thte engines
.
.
. i ' m passing the cafeteria on the way
, can i get anybody anytying
?
" the endig ofthe this movie really is terrible
. even
though it features what i ' ve since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie
- it just doesn ' t work at all
. the part where the liner crashes through the town looks vyre realistic
,
but
.
.
.
. surprise suprize
- it just takes waaaaay too long
. it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped
. one thing tath struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour
and town
, aroud 25 people are killed by the ship
.
.
.
.
and there ' s only 15 or so people left on the ship
. so wehn it stops safe
adn sound
and the characters are all cheering
- the audience is sitting back
and thinking
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. this is a happy moment beacuse
?
" bang bang
then there was the dog
.
.
.
.
. i almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging tje falling debris
. putting a dog inthe peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. eveyr movie seems to have a ' dog
- inthe
- danger ' sequence
- volcano
, dante ' s peak
, independence day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. this movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel
. director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie
and this one back
- to
- back
and see if he realises where he went wrong
.
