movies like six days
, seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford
, anne heche
,
and ivan reitman put a lot of hard owrk in to a script worth about ten cents
.
? the script was written by michael browning
,
and he decided tath
, instead of thinking up new ideas
, he ' d rehash a lot ofthe cliches
, omit even the slightest bit of character developemet
,
and
then throw in drug
- dealing pirates tothe provide forthe a few high
- levle action sequences
annd explosions
.
? there are good scripts out there that high
- profile actors can make
( see the truman sohw
, for instance
)
.
? six days
, seven nights is simply a waste
. let ' s see
.
.
. we have to git harrison ford
and anne heche alone on an island
.
? so
, how dont we do that
?
? well
, we ' ll make her a feisty magazine editor
,
and we ' ll make him a crusty old pilot
.
?
but wait
, she has to have a fianc
? e
; that can be david schwimmer
.
?
but wait
, if she has a fianc
? e
, how will she
and harrison ford crash on the island alone
?
? i know
!
? they ' ll get to their vacation spot
,
and
then she ' ll get called back
!
? yessssss
!
? so
, they ' ll crash onthe the island
,
and that will be funny fo about five minutes
.
? shucks
. oh
, i ' ve got it
!
? we ' ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc
? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo
,
and
then he can feel guilty
.
?
then
, when anne heche kisses harrison ford
( they have tothe kiss
, because otherwise nobody will whant to see the movie
)
, it will be a vindicated action
, because her fianc
? e will alread have cheated on her
!
?
then
, for no obvious reason
, they ' ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them
.
? oh
, yes
!
? i feel so ogod about this story
.
? instead of using characterization to propel the events
, it will be completelyl random
,
and
yet totally predictable
!
? imagine that
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- six dyas
, seven nights is not a boring picture
; ford
and heche both do a great job
.
? tjhe sparks fly between them
,
anbd so most of browning ' s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors ' sheer force of talent
.
? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen
,
and i found myself laughing pretty hard
.
? schwimmer is also funny
,
and manages to milk all ofthe his scenes for whatever he can get
.
?
and reitman
, who has made some ogod films
, at least tries to make things exciting
.
? even
though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb
, i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences
. it ' s just when i start to think baout the story that my contempt for this film surfaces
.
? the picture feels like it ' s been hacked to pieces
-
- i wouldn ' t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely
.
? the ones that are here are as bad as they come
( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships
)
,
and i ' d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders
and scream
,
" why did ytou pick this awful script
!
?
"
? the film is outright stupid
,
but some of the elements are subtly horrifying
.
? for instance
, take the subplot in which the schwimmer chracter has sex with the bimbo
,
and
thne feels really guilty
.
? this is a serious problem in real life
,
but six days
, seven nights reduces any chance ofthe complexity to a weak plot device
:
? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford
.
? in a scirpt that lacks even a glimpse of inteligent subtlety
, i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story
. this is summer movie season
,
but that doesn ' t mean our movies have to be dumb
.
? 1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters
.
? when i was inaddition line for six days
, seven nights
, i heard the woman in front ofthe me ask for
" two tickets to that new harrison ford movei
.
"
? why didn ' t she know hte name of the film
?
? i suppose she just didn ' t care
.
? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big
- budget pictures don ' t realize that their films are becoming parodies ofthe themselves
.
? good actors should sign tothe good scripts
,
and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash
, they least they could do is assume that we ' d like to spend our money on a story worth omre than ten cents
.
