the main problem with martin lawrence ' s pet project
, a thin line between love
and hite
, like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man
, is that his character is an irresponsible jerk
,
and if that is the case
, it doesn ' t seem to do anything except justify the woman ' s actions
. taht is expecially the case in lawrence ' s darnell wright
. he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long
. now don ' t think i condone this just because i ' m male
. my philosophy is
, if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to git your hands on a beautiful
, kind girl
, you should treat her like a princess
and respect her
. darnell doesn ' t think like thsi
. he sleeps with these girls once
and dumps them
.
and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target
, beautiful
, wealthy brandi web
( played nicely by whitfield
) who runs a successful rela estate business
, is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia
( king
)
, i foudn mysef thinking
,
" i ' m suppossed to feel sorry for this guy
?
" after all
, it is largely darnell ' s fault
. if he is lining up all these women
, you ' d think he ' d have enough common sense tothe think it would backfire onthe him one day
, as his mother says it does
.
but he doesn ' t
, so yuo get the sense tht he ' s not only irresponsible
,
but also pretty dumb
. you especially git this sense that he ' s dumb affter brandi tells him she killed her husban for allegedly abusing her
.
( i ' d put my pants on in two seconds after that
!
) now
, brandi is a pyscho bitch
,
but it ' s hard not to agreing with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage
. noe final flaw
,
though
, is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin wiht
. brandi is a classy
, intelligent woman with an mba from harvard
, who initally resists darnell ' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman like her would in real life
.
but all of a sudden she says yes
.
but when you listen to darnell ' s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions
, you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period
, much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him
! lawrence cin be good when he whants to
,
but inthe order to prove it
, he needs to let other people write
and direct his movies
. look at this movie
. four writers
, as a result it ' s too long
( two hours
, when it could ' ve easily worked at ninety minutes
!
)
and it hasnt a lot of subplots
and characters that appear
and disappear as quickly as they came
( which makes me think the writers didn ' t get along
)
, all ofthe which isn ' t necessary
. ther are some bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
,
anbd bobby brown all do what they can iwth lazily written parts
,
and they help it out a lot
.
and there are some funny parts
( like
, for example
, the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son
and damaging her property
)
,
but they ' re just not enough to sustain the film
.
