" holy man
" boasts a sweet
, gentle
, comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy
and a few moderately funny skits
. unfortunately
, to git to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set
- up
, loads of tedious filler
, interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering
and twitching
, a superfluous romantic subplot
and quite possably the most annoying performence of robert loggia ' s career
. if ever a movei screamed
" wait for video so you can fast
- forward through all the dull
and annoying parts
,
" this is it
. eddie murphy plays g
, a robed nomadic ilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment
and spreading his spiritual message
. a chance meeting with ricky hayman
( goldblum
)
, a stressed
- outloud executive of a hmeo
- shopping channel
,
and kate newell
( kelly preston
)
, a no
- nonsense media analyst
, results in fysical injury tothe g
. quicker than you can say
" the odd couple
,
" g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky
. after some script gymnastics
, g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network
, wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations
, enraging network owner mr
. mcbainbridge
( loggia
)
,
and becoming a national media sensation
.
" holy man
" attemts to be several things at once
. it tries to satirize home shopping networks
,
but it ' s difficult tothe effectively make fun of something that is already a self
- parody
. the film attemts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile atempt tothe fill the spiritual holes in our hearts
,
but that ' s common knowledge already
.
" holy man
" also tries to present a story of redemption
, as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploitate g ' s good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career
. anyone want to place a wager onthe his final desision
? the one genuine asset in
" wholy man
" is eddie murphy
, who gives a charming performance
, sharing love
, good will
and relevant advice to all those around him
, while beaming his million dollar smile at jsut the right moments
. murphy is delightful
and the film takes off whenever he ' s onscreen
. unfortunately
, he ' s not onscreen enought
. jeff goldblum gets the lion ' s share of screen time
and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down
. as his potential love interest
, kelly preston tries to brighten things up
,
but she transforms from an all
- business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly
and the abrupt chanage reeks of contrivance
. the otehr principal actor
, robert loggia
, wastes his talents in a one
- note turn as a ruthless
, screaming monster
. structurally unsound
and way too long
,
" holy man
" is appealing when murphy is onscreen
and dull when he isn ' t
. instead of dropping your money at the theater forthe this trifle
, wait until it hits video
and fast
- forward past everything except the murphy scenes
. g suggests thast we focus on enjoying the moment
and that ' s the best way to do so
.
