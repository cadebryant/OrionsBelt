the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie
( if you don ' t count neil simon ' s biloxi blues
)
. year after year
, more predictably cliched military movies come out
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
-
and none of them ever manaze to be anything more than a rehash of the lastest
. i thought stripes would be different
. with ivan reitman as director
, bill murray as star
and harold ramis as co
- star
and co
- screenwriter
, it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army
. instead
, it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army
. murray
, about as funny
and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs
, plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his onyl chance for success
,
and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him
. so he does
,
and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell
, head
- shaving
and marching
/ singing sequences
, more mind
- numbingly stale here thna ever
. the characters are even less original
, ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette
. all teh big name stars in stripes
(
and even larroquette
) fall victim to the lame
, rehashed material
and are never really likeable
, murray in particular
. he only gets a few decent lines in
,
although those barely
- funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman charachter he played three years later in ghostbusters
. he wass even better inaddition caddyshack
, for crying outloud loud
. as with a lot of the late 70 ' s
/ early 80 ' s comedies
, stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like
but is so sex
- obssessed no child should be able to watch it
. i ' m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over
$ 400 to mud wressel five beautiful women
,
but while watching it all that was coming outloud of my mouth was the admonition
" dear god
!
" every few seconds
. stripes isn ' t the playful kind of sex comedy
, either
. most of the time it seems downright misogynistic
, as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women ' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto the stove
and
, with an i
- know
- what
- yuo
- like look on his face
, says he ' s going to give her the
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly
. you don ' t want to stick around as the scene progresses
and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region
.
" i ' m nto enjoying this
,
" tyhe woman protests
. my sentiments exactly
.
