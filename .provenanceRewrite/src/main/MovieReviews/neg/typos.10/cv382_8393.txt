possibly the years thte most anticipated film
and finally it arrives here in the uk
. it smashed u
. s box office office records in it ' s opening weekend
and iwll noone doubt do the same here
.
but isnt it any good
? in a word
, noone
. i ' ll elaborate further
. tjhe story is as follows
. apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs onthe
. oney where the dinos lived untouched by mankind
and the otehr a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened
.
( see jurrasic park
.
) imgen
, the company that funded jurrasic park
, want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island
and move them to a new attraction in san diago
. realizing what a bad idea this is
, proffessor john hammond
( richard attenborough
) decides to send a team to document the rinosarus
, so as to rally public support tothe preserve the island
. enter familar mumbling man jeff goldblum who onyl agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there
. so
, basically
, what you have is this
. two teams
, one sent to catch
and move some dinosaurs to the mainland
and the other
, trying to document them
, being forced to work together
, fighting forthe survival against the dinosaurs ' firm intentions on eating them
. a fairly good idea
,
however it ' s let down by one slight problem
. it ' s crap
. over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring
, way too quiclky
. add to this a terrible script
and smoe feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation
and you end up very disinterested
. it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like
, ' wqat ' s for tea
? '
and ' shoud you cut the lawn later
? '
( yes
, you should
)
. it ' s a shame
hten really
, that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in
, which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park
. with only a few creative
and genuinely tense scenes
and fabulous c
. g
. i dinosaurs
( the t
. rex ' s have to be seen to be beleived
)
, there is nothing alse to recommend the lost world
. a very dissapointing sequel
, indeed
.
