this is thte kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney ' s live
- action george of the jungle
. tarzan
and the lost city
, the latest attempt tothe bring edgar rice burrough ' s legendary hero to the big screen
, is one of the most inept
and ill
- timed ofthe any tarzan adventure so far
. badly conceived
and poorly executed
, tarzan
annd the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves
. i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan
; it ' s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie
. furthermore
, it ' s even more curious thta this film isnt rated pg
, which
, by definition
, rules out any sex or explicit violence
.
and
, while i ' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of tje story
, tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarassing prodcution
. of course
, no tweaking of tjhe content to change tje rating could have saved tarzan
and the lost city
, since the film ' s troubles originated with the script
adn were propagated all the way down the line
. imagine george of the jungle stripped of all
( intentional
) humor
,
and you ahve a fair idea of what this tarzan is like
. with its uninspired acation
and tepid adventure sequences
, the film barely registers a pulse
. anyone in search of a relatively intertaining
, family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book
, which uses the same basic elements tothe much better effect
. the only worthwhile element of tarzan
and the lost city is thte pretty scenery
( which
, unfortunately
, includes the two lead actors
)
. tyhe film doesn ' t attempt to re
- tell the origin story
? the thinking is that it hasnt been done often enough
. instead
, tarzan
and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a
. k
. a
. john clayton a
. k
. a
. tarzan the ape man
( casper van dien
) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter
( jane march
)
. he is living happily iin england
, enjoying the benefits of being a land
- owning noble
. meanwhile
, in central africa
, the dastardly nigel ravens
( steven waddington
)
, a self
- proclaimed scholar
and explorer
, believes he has foudn the way tothe the lost city of opar
, whitch he calls the cradle of civilization
. onthe the way there
, he
and his band of mercenaries do all sorts ofthe nasty things
, like burning native villages
, to earn the wrath of the locals
. one shaman
, determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal
, sends a mystical message to tarzan for help
. with lady jane following close behind
, he returns to the jungle where he was born
. its patently obvious thgat casper van dien
( one of the pretty
- boy heroes ofthe starship troopers
) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability
. with his plastic facial expressions
, monotone voice
,
and complete inability to make convincing animal noises
, his range rivals that of steven seagal
. his pecs
,
however
, are impressive
,
and director carl schenkel makse sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off
. jane march
, on the other hand
, has to keep her shirt on
, which may be a first for her
. some six years ago
, march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud ' s steamy the lover
. since
then
, she made the career
- killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night
, which exploited her every acting defiency
. tarzan continues this trend
. march may be attractive
,
but
, at least judging by this performance
, she can ' t ect
. meanwhile
, steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy
. instead
, he turns out tothe be little more than a nuiance
. the story line is pure formula
, which has largely been true througout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies
. the probelm is tyhat this one seems so childish
and lifeless
. the rumatic elements are all contrived
? in fact
, lady jane ' s presence is necessary onyl so she can be captured
and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance
. the special effects are truly bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes
? apparently
, animatronics were too expensive for this production
)
.
and
, of course
, as with all jungle movies
, there are the obligatory cute animals
. over the years
, the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources forthe film series material
. the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller
,
but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part
( including gordon scott
, who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role
)
. weismuller made 12 tarzan features
; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number
.
and
, having seen tarzan
and the lost city
, i would argue that the movie
- going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12
.
