billy crystal reappears in
yet another high concept comedy
. he tries to infuse some life into it
,
but it gets bogged down with sentimentality
and a lack of sophistication
. sammy
( billy crystal
) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes
. he ' s seperated from his wife
, serena
( kathleen quinlan
)
,
and down to his last serious client
.
.
. in a low
- budget film shooting in romania
.
bu in a turn ofthe bad luck
, sammy wrecks his car
.
.
. only to be mysteriously saved by a giant
( gheorghe muresan
)
.
but this giant has a heart of gold
. he leads a solitary life
, helping out the monks at a local monastery
. his only longing is fo his long lost love
, lilianna
( joanna pacula
)
, who has since moved to amercia
. sammy
, seeing a golden ticket
, convinces max to become an actor
( represented by sammy
, ofthe course
)
,
and come back to america
.
and so sam
and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job
, with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max ' s nose
.
but slowly sammy ' s deceptions begin to haunt him
.
but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned
. the humor in my giant isn ' t the world ' s greatest
. mostly
, it falls under the category of
" boy
.
.
. he ' s so big
!
"
,
and tht can only go so far
, no matter how hard the talent tries
. still
, its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments
. the film ' s best moment
(
and that ' s not saying much
) is a bit part by steven seagal
, playing himself
. between executive desision
and this
, all of seagal ' s best roles have been cameos
. maybe he should consider a change of work
: steven seagal
, the character actor
! gheorghe muresan isn ' t a natural actor at all
,
and his thick cotton
- mouthed accent certainly doesn ' t help
. in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature
. originaly
, the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant
. andre also hadnt a hefty accent
,
but he displayed a knack for comedy inspite the princess bride
.
.
. something muresan should have studied fo some pointers
. why does billy crystal continually get caught in theese pathetic comedies
? he ' s proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be
,
and
yot
, like a glutton for punishment
, he keeps coming back
. that doesn ' t mean we have to
.
