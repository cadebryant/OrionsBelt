the scene at the end of 1989 ' s
` dead poets society
, ' when robin williams ' english students stand up onthe their desk
and say
,
` captain
, my captain
, ' gets me every time
. unfortunately
, the cout room scene near the end ofthe robin ' s newest film
,
` patch adams
, ' doesn ' t have anywhere near the same impact
. from the surface
` patch adams ' looks very promising
. it ' s a story about a not so young man
, patch adams
( robin williams
)
, who finds meaninng in his life thru helping sick people
. when tjhe film opens
, we find patch
, depressed
and suicidal
, checking himself into a mental hospital
. in a fewd scenes
, strongly reminiscent of
` one flew over the cuckoo ' s nest
, ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems
;
and it ' s here that he finds how much he loves working with people
. so he checks himself out of the hospital
,
annd heads straight to medical school
. right from the start
, patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable
. he continuously breaks medical tradition
and makes the dean of the school angry
. shorly after joining medical school
, he meets
and falls in love with carin
( monica potter
)
. they
, along with patch ' s dork friend
, truman
( daniel london
)
, start a medical clinic for uninsured people
. once the dean catches wind ofthe the clinic
, he tells patch he cin ' t graduate
and kicks him out of school
. patch
, like what any true american would do
, takes the school to court
. it ' s here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place
, over whether or not patch can become a real doctor
. i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it
. it seems more like a series of short sketches
, rather than a full
- length movie
. considering it runs almost two hours
, much too long for such a glight film
, it could have flowed much smoother
. nto to mention the fact of how serious the film tkaes itself
,
anbd manages to cover all yhe cliches ofthe bad melodrama
. robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining
and worthwhile levels
.
but those moments are rare
and in the end
` patch adams ' is barely average
.
