" it ' s just
.
.
. the way
.
.
. we are
.
"
-
-
- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds tothe supergirl ' s
( helen slater
) query as to why she ' s being attacked
, an example of hte mind
- numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl
. i ' ll admit it
.
.
. i love superman iii
. i konw it ' s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor
,
but i still think it ' s a worthy addition to hte man of steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film of sorts from the series ' same producers
( alexander
and ilya salkind
)
, doesn ' t even rival superman iii in terms of quality
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me from thte opening scenes
and went steadily downhill for the rest ofthe its two hour plus running time
. as the film begins we see the residents of argo city
, a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in
" inner space
"
, go about their daily lives
. ok
.
.
. what
? so theese are exiles from krypton
, which blew uv right
? were they living there before krypton exploded
? how dont you get to
" inner space
"
? this whole
" intertube space
" notion is never explained
, particularly in terms of how these people git information from the outside world
. how dont they know where superman went
? how do tehy know he took the name clark kent
and now works at thge daily planet
? these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me
. argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron
. oen day the founder of argo city
, zaltar
( peter o ' toole
)
, gives the omegahedron to superman ' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, for use as inspiration in her art
. kara uses it to create a bug
- like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of
" whatever
" that protects hte city
. in the chaos
, the omegahedron sails out through thge opening
, dooming the argonians to death
.
.
. inspite three days time
, or something
. kara
then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel
and chases after the omegahedron to save her world
. the power source travels directly to earth
and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor
- league witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, immediately before her dip was ruined
, announced her desires tothe rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans
,
and she sets out to achieve world dominaton
. selena is unaware ofthe course that kara has also arrived on earth
,
annd that she ' s arrived as supergirl
( complete with appropriate costume
)
. supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake wehn she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why does the omegahedron fall from the sky
but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake
? attention movie
: explain yourself
! i ' m sorry
, i can only suspend disbelief so much
. i can ' t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie whants me to
. knowing that she needs a secret identity
, supergirl basically
" wills
" herself into a school girl outfit
( complete with a different hairstyle
)
, picks the alias linda lee
and enrolls into school
. she ' s given her dorm assignment
,
and who happens to be her roommate
? lois lane ' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coincidence is one thnig folks
,
but we ' re getting really contrived nowe
. what follows are some generic all
- girls school hijinks
.
.
. complete with evil bully girls
( mean for no reason
, of course
)
and even a shower scene
(
!
)
. best moment
though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra onthe over her school uniform
and starts stuffing it with socks
. at this point i ' m rapidly wondering why i ' m bothering with this nonsense
. there is some credit to give to the film
however
. one lengthy
adn elaborite sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small town in search ofthe its
" prey
" is very well done
. aslo
, its commendable to see genders reversed in the film
, whereas tghe women have all the power
and the men are merely objects
and tools
. hart bochner
( die hard
) is particularly fun as kara ' s love intrest
, a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell casted by selena
(
although he is unfortunately part of one of the film ' s mroe ridiculous moments
, when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
.
then there were numberous little things that bothered me
. the flying effects are never convincing for a moment
.
.
. it ' s all too obvious that helen slater isnt hooked to wires
. instead of having her look liuke she ' s flying
, the filmmakers wanted her to be
" graceful
"
, so she poses a lot
and does ballet
- type maneuvers
. also
, who are thge first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth
? a pair of truck drivers
/ rapists who immediately attack her
and
then meet a
" wacky
" demise
. there isnt also smoe rampant product placement iin the film
, most notably for popeye ' s
, tylenol
,
and a
& w root beer
, with tghe latter actually puting its logo on the t
- shirt of one of the rapists
(
?
!
)
. finally
, just one word
: monsters
. faye dunaway
and peter o ' toole ham it up unmercifully
,
however when o ' toole overacts he ' s entertaining
and when dunaway does it she ' s annoying
( her character actually says the line
" seize them
!
" at one point
)
. dunaway ' s henchmen
( played by peter cook
and brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, with vaccaro comming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty ' s otis character ffrom the firt two superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent
, naieve character she ' s written to be
, as she ' s able to gaze at flowers
and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder tothe make it believable
. believability aside
though
, it ' s still annoying
. now despite all this negativity
(
and i ' m not alone here
.
.
. supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles
)
, leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested
,
bu excisted about its release on dvd
! they have released two separate editions of thte film on dvd
, tothe the delight of many peple
( including myself
.
.
.
yet i ' m still unclear as to why
, since this movie is so awful
)
. the first
and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u
. s
. theaters
. the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2
. 35
: 1
, is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
,
and has been remastered in full thx glory
. extras on the disc include
: a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc
and
" special project consultant
" scott michael bosco
, the excellent 50
- minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl
- the making of a feature
( dig that workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, in
- depth storyboards
( accompanied by score from the movie
)
,
and assorted still galleries
. the transfer on this international version is incredible
.
.
. you ' d think you were watching a new release
. images are sharp
, colors jump off thge screen
,
and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts
. only some special effects sequences show tyhe wear of time
,
and there jstu isn ' t much that can be done about that
( unless you ' re obsessive like george lucas
)
. the new thx approved audio is loud
and clear inspite all tje right places
,
however you ' ll be hearing absurd dialogue
annd a mediocre jerry goldsmith scroe
( whitch is completely unrelated to john williams ' classic superman theme
and sounds better suited for a cannon films ' golan
- globus production
)
. the commentary track featuring director szwarc
and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries
. bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl
and is there with szwarc to ensure that there ' s no dead air on the track
. bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone
and everything that comes onscreen
,
and we learn a great deal moreso baout the film as a result of his participation
.
although
, at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific responce from szwarc
,
and is surprised when he doesn ' t get that response
. we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track
, most notably the
" alomst
" appearance in the film by christopher reeve
. great detail is given about superman ' s proposed role in tjhe original script before reeve
( wisely
) dropped out
. as it stands
, superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away onthe some sort of peace mission
. for the sake of brevity
, i won ' t even get into that one
. szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds
(
and everyone else agreed
) that supergirl needed to stand on its own
, replacing the science fiction ofthe the superman films with cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsense
. bosco also points out scenes not in tjhe american release as they come along
, claiming that had tehy been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office
. again
, for the sake of brevity
, i won ' t even get into that one
. anchor bay has also released a limited edition
( only 50
, 000 copies pressed
) two
- disc set
. disc one contains everything mentioned forthe the regular release
. disc two features the never before seen directer ' s cutted of the film
, whihc runs 138 minutes long
. the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don ' t add much ofthe note
, except for a few moments which lengthen peter o ' toole ' s screen time
( particularly during his latter appearances
)
. the print is rough in spots
anbd the sound is only in mono
,
but fans ofthe the film won ' t care
. one question
though
.
.
. shouldn ' t the director ' s commentary be on the director ' s cut of the film
? i ' d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd
. i was nine when it was released to theaters
,
and even
then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it
. so when i popped the dvd into my player
and sat down in my eazy chair i hadnt no idea what tothe expect
. i knew the film wasn ' t beloved
and i never had any interest in it before
,
bu i was willing to give it a shot because ofthe the impressive amount of work put into the disc
. as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed witht the opening sequence
, which made me sit up
anbd wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong
. come to fidn out
however it was just the chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started
. at the end of the film
, supergirl flies back into the lake with teh omegahedron
,
and flies back to argo city
. ugh
, i give up
. i ' m surprised i even made it tothe the end of the film not once
, not twice
,
but threee times to review these discs
. supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package
,
but a vyre lousy movie
.
