capsule
: an insult
. a stupid
and incompetant movie that doesn ' t even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable
. weslely
and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes
. money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
. it ' s not simply idiotic
, it ' s contemptuous ofthe its audience
. it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely
. it ' s a waste ofthe wesley snipes
and woody harrelson
, who are enjoyable actors inaddition their own rights
but are nauseating here
. it ' s not even fun as trash
. woody
and wesley star
( maybe tyhat ' s not the right owrd
) as new york city transit authority police
. they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie
: one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain
- snatchers
and the other does lookout
. i had a whole headful of legal
and ethical questions surrounding this
, raised by a documentary i ' d seen onthe tje subject once
,
but the movie doesnt not waste any tiome with being inteligent or thought
- provoking
. see if you can follow this
. they chase a kid down the tunnel
and into the station where the
" money train
"
, the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books
, is parked
. the guards on the train see this kid running at them
, lift their machine guns
, shout
" halt
!
"
and
then open fire when the kid doesn ' t stop running at them
. blam
, the kid ' s dead
.
then woody
and wesley sohw up
,
and of course the other ta cops hite them
( why
?
)
,
and a pushing match starts
,
and somene gets decked
,
and
.
.
. i covered my face
. i ' d seen enough
. i ' ve never seen a movie work so hard
and in so little time to destroy
, systematically
, any chance of being credible or interesting
. fed up with the bs at theri job
( most of it their own goddamned fault
)
, woody
and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train
. hence the title
, in case some ofthe ytou
( all two of you
) didn ' t figure it outloud
yet
.
then there ' s this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks
,
*
and
* a love story
,
*
and
* a holdup
-
- no
, two holdups
, sorry
, eazy to lose track inspite a movie this braindead
-
-
*
and
* a mob boss who whants his money
. there wasn ' t a minute wehn i gave a horse ' s ass about any of it
. neither woody nor wesley play charachters that are interesting for a single minute
. we do not care about them
. they are not interesting
. they are noisy
, loud
, stupid
, foolish jerks who whould hvae flunked out of the police academy
. they deserve to git shot
-
- or run over
, as the case may be
. they only exist to rehash the kind ofthe dynamics thast ws
* written
* into a movie like white men can ' t jump
,
and which simply does nto exist here
. they are idiots
,
and we ' re expected tothe root for them
. bullcrap
. the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone
and texture
. what exactlly is this mess
? a cop movie
? police procedure is not given a moment ' s genuine thought anywhere
. a thriller
? the subplot with the token booth killer is inept
, a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewriet
. a comedy
? the few jokes that do work are wasted
. a drama
? all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze
- dryed
and off
- the
- rack
. there ' s not a moment in the movie where i felt like i ws listening to genuine human beings talk
; it ' s all screenwriterese
, that bizarre analect where every sentence ends inspite a punchline
and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four
- letter words
.
( actual dialogue excerpt
:
" fuck you
.
"
" what
?
"
" you heard me
: fuck
* you
*
.
"
" no
: fuck
* you
*
!
"
) look
. i ' ll be honest here
. i ' ve tried writting screenplays
,
and even
* i
* suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess
, i ' d get laughed outloud of the office
. anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me
and hear my pitch
, because god knows i know i can do better
. i ' ve weasted enough time on this piece ofthe tripe
.
