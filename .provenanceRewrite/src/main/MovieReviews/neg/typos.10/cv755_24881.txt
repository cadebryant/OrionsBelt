battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000
,
and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close
. in fact
, i ' ll be surprised if i see anything thsi bad in the enxt ten years
. based on the novel by scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
, battlefield earth begins
and we immediately find out two pieces of key information
. it ' s the year 3000
,
and an alien race called the psychlos
( which sounds like a tag team ofthe mexican wrestlers
) conquered our planet in nine minutes
. ok
, we are all of 10 seconds in
and i have a zillion questions racing thru my mind
. when were we conquered
? the audience is led to believe that this happened baout 1
, 000 years earlier
,
and if that is the case
then we ' re going to git inot a whole bunch of problems later
( trust me
.
.
. keep reading
)
. also
, why don ' t we get to see earth get conquered
? how the hell dont yuo make a popcorn sci
- fi flick
and not deliver the goods onthe the one event that sets up the film
? humans now live as cavemen or slave labor
,
and for the film ' s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver
, colorado
. they grunt
and groan
anbd babble about monsters
. so
, wehn the psychlos conquered earth
, were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills
? none of these characters have any knowledge ofthe the planet being conquered
( whenever that was
)
. this isnt definitely not the way to start an action
/ sci
- fi film
. one of tyhe humans wanders out into the wilderness
and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster
,
and he begins to fight it
. the
" monster
" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course
. he turns around
and sees all sorts of other characters ffrom the golf course
, with some shrubs growing over them
. so
, in 1
, 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time
, with only a few weeds growing over it
? anyway
, some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl
( john travolta
) a smarmy
adn opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit
. the cavemen
( led by barry pepper
) are forced to do their bidding or whatever
,
but eventually they gain tyhe upper hand
and reclaim the planet
, or something
. so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to dont 1
, 000 years earlier
?
and
, we ' re supposed to believe that earth was conqured in nine minutes by a group ofthe buffoonish aliens who can ' t even handle a few cavemen
? one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets
and using them tothe fight the psychlos
. so jets left unattended for 1
, 000 years are still able to fly
? please
, if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid
and hose under the hood
. why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway
? shouldn ' t they hve destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us
? the psychlos refer to humans as
" man animals
"
but
yet dogs are still
" dogs
"
. why aren ' t they
" dog animals
"
? the psychlos are after mining earth ' s precious resources
,
but for 1
, 000 years are unaware of fort knox
? why do i even care at this point
? i ' m a fan ofthe travolta ' s
adn i ' m glad to see he ' s back on the a
- list in hollywood
( despite the fact tath he occasionlly puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael
and phenomonenon
)
.
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie
?
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here
? he ' s more than capable of making a menacing villain
( see broken arrow
and face
/ off
)
but whenever his character came on screen i couldn ' t hold back my laughter
. now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have
, travolta just looks like travolta
. all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face
,
but travolta just has a goatee
. also
, travolta ' s acts with a sort of phony upper
- clas snooty accent
and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsence back on his home world
. ooooo
, scary villain
. as a producer he should know better
and as an actor he should definitely know better
. you cin make a dumb
but good sci
- fi film
( i love independendet day for example
)
,
but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth
. i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening
.
.
. i cleaned my glasses
, walked around the theather
, made a grocery list
, chose my lottery numbers for the week
, replayed super bowl xxv in my head
( with commercials
)
.
.
.
anbd still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids
. by the time we actually reach tjhe year 3000
, people should still be avoiding this film
. folks
, save your cash
.
. don ' t go see it
, don ' t rent it
,
and don ' t buy it
. you ' d be more entertained by taking the money you ' d use for this movie
and just throwing it into the wind
, watching it sail away
( hell
, send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal
.
.
. we ' ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money
)
. unless of course you ' re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running
, which is just about all you ' ll come away with from this movie
. that
,
and a headache
.
[ editor ' s note
: fo some reason
though
, the day after my screening i converted to scientology
. i ' m not sure why
.
.
. something just made me feel compelled make the choice
.
