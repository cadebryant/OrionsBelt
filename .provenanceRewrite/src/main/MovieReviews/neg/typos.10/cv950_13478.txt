the most interesting part of
" can ' t hardly wait
" just happens to be not onyl the most human
,
but for many of us
, the one part that many of us can easily relate to
. that isnt the character of denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, the film ' s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film
,
and at oney point sits down on a couch
and looks totally bored
. the film wisely holds over htis moment
, nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party
.
.
. almost too nicely
. fo some members of the audience
( read
: me
)
, this is basically a mirror of what ' s going on with them watching this film
. we sit there wondering why we ' ve even bothered to see a film about a long high skool party we probably never feeled the desire to go to in the frist place
. i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this
. after all
, this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with
. everyone ' s here
: the jock
, tjhe homecoming queen
, the nerd
(
and his dominions ofthe trekkies
and x
- philes
)
, the alienated wannabe writer
, the school spirit girl
, the pothead
( s
)
, the wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
,
and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial
, lame
,
and basically as a bunch of losers
. except for denise
, who rolls her eyes at everything
,
annd easily becomes the most likable charcter even before she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something which is done for each main character
, qoutes oscar wilde
- definite pointers there
)
. unfortunately
, the writers
and directors take several major misteps on the way to mkaing this into an admirable
and even likable film
. the film
, as i said
, portrays most of its charactors as superficial
and just totally ignorant to everything
.
however
, instead of sticking with this
, perhpas even going a bit further withthe it
, they let this lie
,
and actually make these characters into our heroes
. we follow several of them
, all a bunch ofthe moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity
and realism
,
and tries to tell boring
anbd overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared
and
/ or identified with them
.
and if we did
, we certainly don ' t want tothe revisit that state of being
. here ' s a quick low
- down
: it ' s graduation
,
and we follow a bunch of seniors onthe the last night
, otherwise known as the
" american grafitti
" or
, to a lesser extent
, the
" dazed
annd confused
" cliche
. the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly
; the latter did a little bit of that
and featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" can ' t hardly wait
" just opts for a big indoor keg party
,
and a little bit of aimless driving
, albeit of the i ' m
- whining
- because
- i
- can ' t
- get
- a
- girl
- i
- wanna brand
. we follow many people around
,
but mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, of
" that thing you do
!
"
)
, the alienated writer
, who ' s been pining over the homcoming queen
, amanda
( the totally overrated jennifer lvoe hewitt
)
, forthe the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment thier freshman year over a freaking pop tart
. now that she ' s broken up with her football player boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides to go to the party with a note he ' s written declaring his
" love
" for her in thte hopes he ' ll build up the guts to give it to her
.
.
. even
though he ' s leaving for a multi
- week intensive writing program hosted by none other thna kurt vonnegut
( okay
: the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. usance that plot is incredibly lame
and a tarck record of what goes on with it wouldn ' t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film
,
and because it ' s a party
, there are some moreso main charactors
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, finally surfacing after
" dick tracy
"
)
, the nerd
(
and his dominions
) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike
, who ' s humiliated him for years
,
but gets too caught up in drinking to dont it
; kenny
( seth green
)
, the wigger
, who has decided taht this party will be where he will fianlly get laid
( uh huh
)
;
and denise
, hte only exeptional character
, who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom
( don ' t ask
) wih kenny where the two characters let down thier characters
and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile
. ugh
. the main comparison this film is getting to anyother film is actually not
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed
and confused
,
" two films that embraced
and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers
( not to mention were extremely entertaining
)
,
but to john hughes films of the 80s
, most notably
" sixteen candles
.
" the big difference in the two isnt that that film managed to not only embrace
but even satirize its main characters
,
and did so equally
and in an entertaining fashion
. this film forgets tothe satirize its characters
,
and ultimately tells a story baout a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes
.
.
.
and
then says that it ' s all okay
. we cxan ' t take this film seriously
, nor can we take this as fun
, so really what good is it
?
bu i will tell you some things i did like
: i liked the direction
, exept for a couple too
- over
- the
- top features
, like way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it ' s liuke an oxymoron
)
and other obscurities
. generally
,
though
, elfont
and kaplan do have graceful camera movement
,
and even manage to capture an altman
- esque feel tothe their film from time to time
( a thing with a note
,
though
, is too hokey to really be admirable
)
. i actually doed like seth gren
, for once in about a decade
( when he played a very young woody allen inthe
" radio days
"
)
- his desintegration of his wigger charachter was almost believable
.
.
. almost
.
and
, ofthe course
, lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise
, the one charactor we could have used some omre of
, even
though it would have changed yhe entirety ofthe the film
.
however
, the character of denise really doesn ' t work with the film
, when really thought about
. she ' s far too witty
and realized
( at least for the first half
) to belong in this film
,
and whenever she appears
, she automaticly gives everything a delightfully satirical tone
. she ' s not jsut the cynic or tjhe intellectual
; she ' s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters
. she may ruin thte film more
,
but at least when she ' s on screen we can sit up
adn think to ourselves
" well
, at least we ' ll be entertained
.
" a couple other things that just don ' t work
: mike ' s character
, who suffers an epiphany throughout teh film
but in the end acts as
though he has forgotten everything
: too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general
; the aimless
, bitchy driving by preston to try
and get over his inability to shack up with amanda
- give me a break
;
and perhaps the one thing that just doesn ' t work at all
: jenna eflman ' s uncredited cameo as an angel
- just didn ' t work
,
but nice try
. basically tghe worst thing about this film
, the real reason i ' m giving this such a low rating
, is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters
and
then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane
and unlike anything we ' d do
. we don ' t feel fo these characters because for most of us
, we aren ' t sterotypes going through teh motions to worn subplots
. the acid test for high school movies is
: does it at all capture the feel of what it ' s portraying
? the answer for this film is no
. nice try
,
though
.
