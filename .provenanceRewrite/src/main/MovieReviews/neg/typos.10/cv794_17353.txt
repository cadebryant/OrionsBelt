. comments
: naked souls opens with a naked woman
,
and the movie makes no illusion that it ' s a sci
- fi vehicle desined to show pamela anderson ' s
, um
, talents
. if you are really interested in seeing anderson ' s talents
,
however
, i suggest you skip over thsi dud
and watch the infamous pam
and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape
, now available onthe home video
. at least with that
" movie
,
" you don ' t have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like
" eclectic
.
" a premise does exist in the movie
. basically
, while anderson wears skimpy clothes which bearly contain her talents
, she practices her art
-
- brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women
. her boyfriend
, meanwhile
, spends 20 housr a day in a morgue trying to veiw tjhe memories of dead prison inmates because this will
" make a difference to humanity
.
" whatever
. the movei fails to explain how these two hooked up
. be grateful
. after we meet the evil everett longstreet
, lots of technobabble
and mystical mumbo
- jumbo git tossed about
, pammy has sex replete with cheesy make
- out music
,
and minds get transferred
. never fear
,
though
, pammy uses her sharp mental abilities
( ahem
) to savve her boyfriend in the end
. unfortunately
, no one saves the movie
. avoid this would
- be sci
- fi thriller
, unless you ' re in for a ogod laugh or two
.
