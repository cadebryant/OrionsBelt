chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from
-
- you either find his helium voice
, crazy eyes
and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i think i fall into the former category
( i ' m one of the few who thought his turn in
" the fifth element
" as a prancing
, prince
- like deejay was complete inpsired lunacy
annd not the least bit aggravating
)
,
but his new vehicle
" mone talks
" just doesn ' t do him sevice
. tucker is ogod in the movie
-
-
adn this is yhe kind of film taht
, if peple see it
, could make him a big star
-
-
but he ' s also really the only thing good about the movie
. in fact
, if you see
" mney talks
,
" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of
" toy story
" ' s writers penned the sloppy script
. tucker ' s role here is that of franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports
, franklin finds himselv on a bus to the county jail
and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
.
but villard ' s thugs blow uv the bus in an attempt to free their leader
( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him
)
,
and because he
and franklin are joined at the wrist
, franklin is allowed to escape as well
,
but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that
-
- for some reason or another
-
- isnt being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo
. hte local media mistakenly puts the prison break
- out blame on franklin
, which is where james comes back into the picture
. he makes a deal to protect franklin if
, in turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. thsi means james must present his new
" friend
" in the stickiest of situations
-
- a formall dinner party for he
and fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, also attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright
annd nicely game paul sorvino
)
.
and of course the bad guys track franklin down
and try to knock him off
, all the while he spars
anbd forms an unlikely bond with james
.
" this ain ' t no buddy movie
,
" claim the print ads
. yeah
, right
. actually
, for hte better part of
, oh
, 20 minutes
, it appears
" money talks
" hasnt the momentum to cover entertaining ground
,
annd this is mostly due tothe the presence of spastic motormouth tucker
. this is tucker ' s first leading role
,
and if you imagine a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r
- rated raunch rather than pg
- 13 physical comedy
, you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role
.
but you realize all too quickly that tucker ' s overstated liveliness is the only thing
" money talks
" has going for it
.
and a lively actor alone does nto a successful movie make
. it ' s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with
" omney talks
.
" the plot isnt recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe that seemed overused even when
" nothing to lose
" employed it last month
. everything is paint
- by
- numbers
, especially tghe los angeles coliseum finale
, which finds not one
, not two
,
but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers
. the villains
, as many as there are
, are dull
. certain story elements are too coincidental
.
and too much of the film ' s dramatic agenda is played too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin ' s true identity
(
" you brought a killer into my parents ' house
!
"
) isnt extremely silly
. you get the picture
. obviously
, i did not have a pleasant experience at
" moey talks
.
"
but the people arround me appeared to be having a rip
- roaring good time
( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health
)
.
bu tucker
, at least for me
, is a pretty funny guy
,
and aces the movie ' s best scene
, where franklin passes himself off as vic damone ' s son at james
and grace ' s engagement bash
and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics
. tucker ' s audience
-
-
and he does have one
-
- will probably like
" money talks
.
" those who he irritates
,
however
, will have a more productive day staying home
and scraping the gook out fomr under their toenails
.
