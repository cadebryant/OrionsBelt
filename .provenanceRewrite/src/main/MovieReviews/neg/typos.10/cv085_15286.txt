it ' s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james '
( jennifer love hewitt
) best friends
. still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all
, she seems to be onthe the verge of a nervous breakdown
. she can ' t concentrate on her schoolwork
, can ' t get a good night ' s sleep
,
annd is even frightened by the shadows
and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club
. everywhere she looks
, she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand
. in the first movie
,
` i know what you did last summer '
, julie
annd three ofthe her friends accidentally kill a man
, runnung him down while driving down a dark mountain highway
. to cover their misdeed
, they dump the body into yhe ocean
.
however
, he never quite died
and returned to hunt down julie
and her friends
. julie
and one other
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, survived only to make this dismal sequal
. needing some desparate rest
and relaxation
, she is elated to learn that her college roommate
, karla
( brandy
)
, has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island
. accompanying theese twpo girls are karla ' s overbearing boyfriend
, tyrell
( mehki phifer
)
and a potential beau for julie
.
but was this contest too ogod to be true
? the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like loev boat rejects
. meanwhile
, the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin
. this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded
and will have no possible means off the island
. eventally
, they will be hunted down during power outages
annd chased around during intense lightning storms
. as you might have guessed
, somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously stange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker
annd wielding a hook
. julie tries to convince her friends thast the killer is onthe the island
( an eerie touch is when she is singing
" i will survive
" at the karaoke bar
and the words scroll
" i still know
.
.
.
"
)
,
but her friends chalk it up to paranoia
.
but the body count soon starts to rise
,
and for julie
, it ' s gonig to be the worst vaation of her life
. the funny
( yes
, i used the word ' funny '
) thing about this movie isnt that i heard more chortling
adn giggling
( maybe it was my giggling
) than i heard screaming
. this movei boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry witn or even a quirky campiness
. htere isn ' t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths
. here ' s an appropriate example
. knock
- knock
.
" housekeeping
"
, says the diminuitive cleaning lady
. the door suddenly opens up
. slash
. next victim
! is there any reason to go
and see this movie
? not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes
.
but i do want tothe say one thing about this movei that satisfied me
. i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell
, who incessantly ranted
and raved about his sexual libido
. i secretly wished for him to get filleted
. did he get ' hooked '
? well
, let ' s just say that if he didn ' t
, i would give this film a grade of
" d
"
.
