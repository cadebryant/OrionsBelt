the best thing about
,
" lake placid
" is that it ' s only 80 minutes long
and when it ' s over you ' re glad that you didn ' t waste more than an hour
and a half ofthe your time
. it ' s nothing more than a bad rip
- off of
,
" jaws
"
(
and i think that ' s being kind
.
) it was writed by david e
. kelly
(
" ally mcbeal
"
) as a horror
- comedy
but fails at both
, miserably
. i was never scared
and i think that i only laughed once
. the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in
,
" anaconda
.
" the plot beggins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile inspite black lake in maine
. that brings the local sheriff
( brendan gleeson
)
and a fish
-
and
- game warden
( bill pulman
) to investigate
. also
, a paleontologist
( bridget fonda
) from new york is sent to look at a tooth
and an eccentric millionaire
/ crocodile lover
( oliver platt
) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast
. soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc
and the other half want to save it
. there ' s alsot an eccentric old lady
( betty white
) who lives by the lake
and hasnt a few secrets
. as i mentioned before kelley
and director steve minor
( h20
) don ' t go for a sereous approach towards the material
but they also don ' t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either
. the betty white charater is completely unfunny
adn none of the other characters are really that interesting
, they ' re all basically idiots
. if they had any brains hte croc wouldn ' t have been that much ofthe a challenge to catch
and they wouldn ' t have put themselves inwhich half of tghe situations that they did
.
but
then again
, if they weere smart ther wouldn ' t be a movie
. basically
,
" lake placid
" is best undiscovered
.
