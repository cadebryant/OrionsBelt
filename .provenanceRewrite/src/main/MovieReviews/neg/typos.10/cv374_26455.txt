" my nmae is jack carter
,
and you don ' t want to know me
" says our brooding anti
- hero
( sylvester stallone
)
. take his advice
! to know this guy is as rewarding as bieng thrown over a terrace
.
and to watch this film is almost as painful
.
" get carter
" is a gloomy looking
, unimaginative film taht offers noone joy
. jack carter isnt as tough as tough guys come
. he works out of vegas as a self
- described ' financial adjuster '
. explaining his duties
, he says
,
" people make promises
and break them
. i help them remember
.
" he has a chiseled body full of tattoos
. he hasnt the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times
. he speaks in a hushed
but menacing tone of voice
. in other words
, thsi is sylvester stallone acting like
.
.
. sylvester stallone
.
and like most of his previous roles
, his character is a shallow
, one
- dimensional thug whose modus operandi is tothe talk tough
, hassle a few hapless people
, find out what he needs to know
,
and
then dispense his own kind ofthe justice
. with the charizma of a pit bull
, bieng tough is all that jack carter knows
.
yet
, even tough guys know when to put family first
. as the story beigns
, we learn that jack ' s little brother hasnt died inthe a car accident
. the polical attribute it to heavy drinking
.
howver
, jack isnt suspicious
, believing that he was ' taken out '
. he takes a break ffrom his vegas duties
and tries to see if he can find the truth
. as he pokes around
, he runs into several lowlife characters
. they include a shady busineses partner
, a prostitute
, a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates
,
annd an oily owner ofthe a porn website
. any one of them may know something about his brother ' s death
. all of them have the means of carrying outloud the ded
.
but don ' t expect an exercise in sleuthing where well
- placed clues lead carter to the truth
. he ' s all brawn
anbd noone brains
, so there are no epiphanies during his investigation
. instead
, he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward
, cycling through this circle of suspects
. flustered with his lack of progress
, he cycles through them again
and again
. this all gets tiring fairly quicklyu
. by the time the film launches into its final act
, we ' re numb from its pedestrian pace
. oddly
, as a tough
- guy thriller
, it starves us for action
. admittedly
, there is one nifty chase sequence
,
but tihs is related to a tangential
and needless plot
( carter ' s vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him
)
. the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion
. stallone has the perosnality of a slab of stone
.
and the look
and feel of the film isnt perpetually downcast
. the weather is constantly overcast or rainy
. meanwhile
, most shots take place at night
, inaddition dimly lit rooms
, or in dark alleys
. it ' s just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere
. as a result
,
" get carter
" amounts tothe nothing more than a flat thriller
, bereft of clever moments
and devoid of any excitement
. you ' re better off leaving this guy alone
.
