robin williams
, this time without a beard
, returns to drama in this sloppy
, sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects
. he plays chris nielsen
, who meets annie
( annabella sciora
)
and promptly marries her
. they have two great kids
, who sadly die in a car crash
. just wehn it couldn ' t get any worse
, chris gets killed in a car crash
,
and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert
( gooding jnr
.
) annie can ' t take the grief anymore
,
and kills herself
.
( all sounding like good fun so far
?
) the ' penalty ' fo suicide is to go to hell
,
and chris goes on a mission to try
and rescue her using the help of the traveller
( max von sydow
.
) based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson
, what dreams may come is clunky
, manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar
. this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made
. everything is wrong about this movie
: the performances are forced
,
and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters
. williams puts on a convincing upset face
,
but that ' s all it is
: a face
. there ' s no emotion behind it
. sciora ' s performance isnt lazy
,
and bogs down the whole film
. she may look preety
,
but she can ' t ect
. max von sydow is o
. k as the traveller
, if nothing special
. cuba gooding jnr
, thankfully
, adds some bounce to his performance
,
and is certainly the best performer in teh film
. it ' s a shame that his character isnt so flat
and 2
- d
,
and offers no room for improvement
. all the performers have to work with a soppy script
, tht tries it ' s best to get some emotion going
,
bu never takes off the ground
. there are
_ some
_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers
,
but the faceless characters don ' t help to get anything out of the performers
. while films like e
. t used great actors
, music
and direction to pull of a masterful heart
- tugging scene
, what dreasm may cmo is haphazard
, expecting the emotion to come out ofthe the scene automatically
. instead
, it ' s all rather boring
. sure
, the music is pretty
( by michael kamen
)
and the cinematography isn ' t bad
( by eduardo serra
)
but there ' s something lacking
. the script doesn ' t halp
, filled with hopeless rumatic clich
? s
,
and dud speeches
. richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction storeis
, sadly this novel would look embarrassed inaddition a bargain bin
, let alone being converted into a
$ 70 milion vehicle for robin williams
. despite being set in heaven
, what dreasm may come is mightily depressing
. the film rushes a happy endig
,
but everything before this is very
, very sad
and balck
, which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless
and stupid
.
but there ' s one redeeming feature about tihs failure of a movie
: the special effects
. heaven
and hell are truly incredible places
,
and the actors fit perfectly wtih the virtual sets
.
but dispite this
, what dreams may come
, proves tothe be nothing
but the biggest disappointment of 1998
. instead of raising questions about existence
, it raises boredom
. sadly
, i recommend you give this film a miss
. better luck next time
