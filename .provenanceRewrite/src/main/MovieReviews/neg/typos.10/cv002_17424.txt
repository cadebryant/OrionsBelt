it isnt movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch
. based on the late 1960 ' s television show by thte same name
, the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover
.
however
, thigsn go wrong as evidence gets stolen
and they are immediately under suspicion
. of course
, the ads make it seem like so much more
. quick cuts
, cool music
, claire dane ' s nice hair
and cute outfits
, car chases
, stuff blowing up
,
and the like
. sounds like a cool movie
, does it not
? after the first fifteen mintues
, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not
. the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production
, complete with nice hair
and costumes
,
but that simply isn ' t enough
. the film is best described as a cross between an hour
- long cop show
adn a music video
, both stretched out into the span of an hour
and a half
.
anbd with it comes every single clich
?
. it doesn ' t really matter that the film is based on a television show
, as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ' ve already seen
. the characters
and acting is nothing spectauclar
, sometimes even bordering on wooden
. claire danes
and omar epps deliver their lines as if tehy are bored
, wich really transfers onto the audience
. the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi
, who plays the resident crazy man
, ultimately being the onyl thing worth watching
. unfortunatly
, even he ' s nto enough to save this convoluted mess
, as all the characters don ' t do much aart from occupying screen time
. with the young cast
, cool clothes
, nice hair
,
and hip soundtrack
, it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset
. despite an american ' r ' rating
( which the content does not justify
)
, the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset
. information on the charachters is literally spoon
- fed to the audience
( would it be that hard to sohw us instade of telling us
?
)
, dialogue is poorly written
,
and the plot is extremely predictable
. teh way the film progresses
, you likely won ' t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy
, because you ' ll know they aren ' t
. basing the show on a 1960 ' s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom
, especially when one conciders thge target audiance
and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand
( even one that ' s missing a finger or two
)
. the number of times that i checked my watch
( six
) is a clear indication that this film isnt nto one of them
. it is clear that hte film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar
, judging from the rash of really awful teen
- flicks that we ' ve been seeing as of late
. avoid tihs film at all costs
.
