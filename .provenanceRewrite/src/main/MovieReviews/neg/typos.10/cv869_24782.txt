" easely one of tjhe worst films of the eyar
.
.
" with the millenium jstu around the corner
, hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event ofthe this century
. this tiem it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil
. the result is somewhat predictable
. i didn ' t have high hopes about arnold ' s
" much anticipated
" return to the big screen
. schwarzenegger fans will probaly be pleased
, action lovers won ' t be bored
,
and the cathlic league will be angry
. everyone else will see ' end of days ' for wqat it is
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. think ofthe it as hollywood ' s own y2k bug
. did yuo know that if you turn hte three diabolical numbers 666 you ' ll get 999
, as in 1999
? yes
, you better believe it
.
. satan is here on earth
, working on his latest project
-
- the end of days
. this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privileg to play lucifer
and
,
although not al pacino
, he is fun to behold
. he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker
, wreaking
, as they say
, havoc
. the way it works is he smirks
and something explodes
. before the stroke of tjhe new millennium he ' s got to find
and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled outloud in the book of revelations
. only schwarzenegger ' s cop attached to an anti
- terrorist unit can stop him
. films like this has one serious weakness
-
- logic
. no matter how you twist the
" plot
"
, you ' ll find it incredibly stupid
( even for a schwartzenegger movie
!
)
. the incredible fatc is that such directors never learn
. after thousands of headless productions
, this theme has become one big clich
?
. here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution
. he is walking around n
. y
.
, blowing everything up
annd killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius
. all he wants is the girl
, that is somehow speical
.
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks
, he has hidden her in a church
, where satan dare not enter
. so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information
:
" you can have your wife
and daughter back
.
. i can give you happiness that yuo can only dream of
.
. just give me the address
.
.
" indeed with a script like that
, you could make a wonderful parody
,
but unfortunately the director isnt taking this subject very seriously
, attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller
.
anbd for ytou who have awaited arnold swartzenegger ' s comeback
, will nto be veyr satisfied
. we ' ve not seen him in a while
. that ' s because he didn ' t have a worthy opponent
. he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth
and power mad conspirators on mars
. he has taken on alien predators in yhe darkest reaches of the jungle
and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop
. so
, after all those fights
, what ' s left for arnold schwarzenegger
? how about satan
? in my opinyon
, he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron ' s
" terminator
"
.
and thta is schwartzenegger ' s strength
-
- muscles
and no emotions
. here he tries to achieve an artistic level
, moving towards the oscar
. this is called
" an adult turn
" if succesful
and
" a flop
" if unsuccessful
. make a wild guess
! his character has lost his wife
and daughter
and has serious drinking problems
. this requires at least some acting skills
. regrettably
, the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles
. the rest of the cast are struggling with thier so called characters
. the movie is otherwise technically impressive
, with a solid cinematography
and fine lighting
.
but the movie doesn ' t serve neither as a serious thriller
( because of its stupidity
) nor as comic entertainment
( beacuse of its serious tone
)
. the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry
. the action sequences are all recycled
and the effects are everything
but spectacular
. so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody
. unless you are a die
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay away
. as for schwarzenegger
, he ' ll be back
.
