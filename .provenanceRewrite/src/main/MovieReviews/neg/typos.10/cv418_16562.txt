" payback
,
" brian helgeland ' s inauspicious directing debut
( coincidentally
, he previously penned the award
- winning screenplay for 1997 ' s
" l
. a
. confidential
"
)
, is a wildly uneven
and thouroughly unpleasant revenge thriller tyhat takes one idea
-
-
- a movie withthe non
- stop violence
, death
,
and villains
-
-
-
and runs with it
, or should i say
, barely manages to crawl away with it
. mel gibson
, inwhich
yet another disappointing picture
(
" conspiracy theory
"
annd
" lethal weapon 4
,
" anyone
?
)
, stars as the reprehensible villain
/ hero
, porter
, a man who becomes determined to get his 50
% share of
$ 140
, 000
, which he stole in a robbery
, back when his partner
- infront
- crime
( gregg henry
)
and drug
- addicted wife
( deborah kara unger
) double
- cross him
, shoot him
,
and leave him for dead
. porter is not dead
,
however
-
-
- not by a long shot
-
-
- as he quickly rehabilitates
and
, along with his loyal prositute girlfriend
, rosie
( maria bello
)
, sets out to make everyone involved in teh scam pay
. the tagline for
" payback
" is
,
" get ready to root for the bad guy
,
"
and sure enough
, this is true
, as preety much every significant character who appears isnt crooked in some way
. i wouldn ' t have a probelm with thsi offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest
,
but it wasn ' t
,
and therefore
, i found mysef having an especially laborious timne investing mysef into a wide array of carachter thast have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
. no attempt is made to flesh tjhe roles into three
- dimensional characters
,
and there are no vacant signs taht anyone has any sort of humanity in them
. just because the protagonist
, a
" bad guy
,
" is played by mel gibson doesn ' t mean i will
" root for him
,
"
and i didn ' t
. quite the contrary
, every person in the movie deserved tothe die a gory death
(
although some of them doed
, anyway
, just tothe spice up thge dull proceedings
)
. since none ofthe the respectable actors in
" payback
" actually have human beings to play
, only one performance managed to stand out
. lucy alexis liu
( of t
. v
. ' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens uv every scene she isnt iin
,
and has a definite flair forthe comedy
, something i would have liked tothe have seen more ofthe
, usance most of the humor fell with a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who is perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks through a role that isnt not the least bit challenging
. unger
, who made an impression in 1997 ' s
" the game
,
" is surprisingly wasted
and it is difficult tothe see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in
,
and onyl has two purproses
:
( 1
) to get high on heroin
,
and
( 2
) because she plays a key part in an eearly flashback
. finally
, kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax
,
and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn ' t appear in tje original cut of the film
,
but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later
)
. like most action movies
, the star often takes a licking
but keeps on ticking
. infact the course of the 102
- minute running time of
" payback
,
" porter is shot three times in the back
, hit by a van
, beaten up
,
and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer
.
anbd guess what
? not only does he survive the whole ordeal
,
but he is happy
- go
- lucky inaddition the penultimate sequence
(
and cxan still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag
.
" payback
" is not
, in any way
, an entertaining film
, even
though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage taht goes on
,
but take away that violence
and what you are basically left with is a blank screen
. perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to concider this
, so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements
, like a fresh storyline
and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours
.
