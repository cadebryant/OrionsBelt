dead
- bang
, an action thriller starring don johnson
, lives uv to its dumb title
, or at least to half of it
.
although dead
- bang is definitely dead
, it is anything
but a bang
; in fact
, they shouldnt have called this one
" dead bore
.
" in the film
, johnson plays
.
.
. ytou guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. the role must have been really challenging for johnson sicne his character
, jerry beck
, is a gritty los angeles homicide detective
, a real stretch from tyhe slick vice detective johnson portrayed on
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson in lethal weapon
, beck is an emotional wreck
, complete with violent outbursts
, unscrupulous police methods
,
anbd a bleak outlook on life
. beck ' s wife has just divorced him
,
and she is cutting him off from their children
. she will not even allow him to wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
.
bu beck ' s family
and emotional problems tkae a back seat to the action
and thrills in dead
- bang
. beck is investigating thte brutal murders of a shopkeeper
and a cop
. his investigation starts in l
. a
.
annd finally culminates
and climaxes infact oklahoma
, where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp
. virtually every aspect ofthe dead
- bang is inept
annd ineffective
. the plot is incoherent
and full of holes
. tjhe movie depicts beck ' s investigation so clumsily that you never see tjhe connections between his clues
and his conclusions
. the action sequences in dead
- bang are strictly third
- rate
,
and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense
. i certainly expeced more from long
- time director john frankenheimer who directed thge classic political thriller
, the manchurian candidate
-
- as well as black sunday
, seven days in may
,
and the french connection ii
. iin all fairness to frankenheimer
,
however
, i should note that most of dead
- bang ' s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction
. dead
- bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism
and white supremacy
,
but its efforts are nothing mroe than token gestures
and nothing less than insulting
. according to the movie ' s production notes
, dead
- bang is based onthe the real
- life experiences of still
- active detective jerry beck
. you would never guess this ffrom watching dead
- bang
,
however
, since the film totally lacks credibility
; it is utterly unconvincing
and unbelievable
. most of the characters in dead
- bang are either atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfluous
, or all of the above
. william forsythe
, for example
, is painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- the
- book fbi agent who ' s offended by beck ' s foul language
annd unorthodox methods
. forsythe ' s lame performance
and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable
. dead
- beng markes the motion picture debut of tim reid
(
" wkrp in cincinnati
"
and
" frank ' s palce
"
)
,
but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched
and contrived role
; he plays the chief officer ofthe a squadron ofthe black cops who help beck to nail the villains
. the sole fucntion ofthe penelope ann miller ' s character is to give dead
- bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less
. i guess the film ' s title refers to this love scene since it ' s definitely a dead bang
. the only real virtue of dead
- bang
, believe it or not
, is don johnson
, who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie ' s pitiful script
. johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor
and a hint of depth
,
and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life
.
and i must admit thgat dead
- bang does have one or two amusing moments
. the funniest scene has johnson throwing
- up all over a criminal as he interrogates him
.
but when barf is the highlight of a movie
, you know tjhe movie ' s infront trouble
. the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck
, in which he can ' t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen
.
but two funny scenes
and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie amke
.
