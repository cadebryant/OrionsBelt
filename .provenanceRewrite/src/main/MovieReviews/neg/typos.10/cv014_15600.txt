she was the femme in
" la femme nikita
.
" he was the baldwin in
" backdraft
,
"
" sliver
,
"
and
" fair game
"
( with cindy crawford
)
. toghether
, anne parillaud
and william baldwin conspire to make
" shattered image
" the biggest peice of hooey since the stallone
/ stone
" thriller
"
" the specialist
.
" the film poses the question
" what if the life you ' re living now is really a dream
,
and your dreams reality
?
" it ' s either about a woman who ' s haunted by a recurring
(
and recurring
and recurring
) nightmare that she ' s a hired assassin
, or it ' s about a hired assassin who ' s haunted by a recurring
(
and recurring
and recurring
) nightmare that she ' s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica
. it doesn ' t much matter
anbd believe me by tghe time
" shattered image
" runs its painful
and pedestrian course you won ' t care
. these two lives
, with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a balck wig
, black emotionless eyes
,
and balck leather clothing in the seattle
- based assassin scenes
,
adn moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes
, play out endlessly throughout the film
and the result is it ' s now
* twice
* as boring as it might have beeen
. it ' s not that complicated plots cin ' t be entertaining
. of course it helps if you have interesting characters
, crisp dialogue
,
and a modicum of style
.
" shattered image
" isn ' t complex
, it ' s just stupid
.
and boring
. parillaud
and baldwin
, who aren ' t exactly shakespearean material to begin withthe
, are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines
. lines like
:
" you don ' t beg
, yuo insist
. i like that in a woman
.
" that ' s parillaud ' s character talking
.
.
. tothe her cat
!
and
:
" ytou ' re not the reason i couldn ' t care less about you
.
" huh
?
and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film
:
" if you give me a cuple of minutes you know i ' ll charm the pants off you
.
"
" i don ' t haev that kind of tiome
.
" talking of pants
, parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say
" point ofthe no return
.
" we have come to expect this fomr billy baldwin
,
but it might have been nice to have learned something about their cahracters firt
.
but there ' s nothing to learn
. karen is as interesting as a cereal box
, a someone ' s
- out
- to
- get
- me crybaby who imagines the voice at the otehr end of the phone
, the stranger who sends her flowers
, mabye even her husband himself
, is her would
- be killer
. siouxsie is the chromium cool
, tough
- as
- nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors infact order to justify the film ' s meaningless stock title
. baldwin seems more interested in parillaud ' s nest egg
( so that he can pave paradise
and put up a parking lot
) than he does in her
. each time graham greene shows up he gets killed
. barbet schroeder
(
" reversal of fortune
"
) co
- produced
and should be ashamed of hismelf
. eveyr nowe
and again it ' s fun to watch a really bad movie
.
and every nowe
and again
, as
" shattered omage
" makes agonizingly clear
, it isn ' t
.
