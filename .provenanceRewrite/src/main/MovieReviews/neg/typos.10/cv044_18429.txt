.
.
. aw forget it
. i ' ll stick to my day job
. this is a teen movie
, all right
, except the main characters aren ' t teens
. drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a repertwar
, only it ' s vyre clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness
and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters
. the stoyr she ' s covering is not really a story
,
but a story in the making
. she is to return to high school as a student
adn explain what ' s really going on
. the irony is that drew ' s charater
, was such a dweeb first time around
, that she is terrified at going back
. when she does
, she says the wrong things
, wears the wrong clothes
,
and projects the
" i know the answer
" in class that popular kids
( or at least popular kids infact the movies
) reject
. at least she befriends nerdy aldys
( joan of arc ' s leelee sobieski
-
- watch for her
)
, who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are
" suposed
" to be more beautyfull than her
. what works
: drew ' s geeky old
- self
. after a start in films that wass headline driven
,
and a nadir of roles that had her play yhe sluttish character
, it ' s a surprise to see her with bad hair
, big glasses
and braces
. it ' s very funny
. what doesn ' t work
: drew ' s geeky newyorker
- self
. come on
. nobody dresses as bad as she does
. couldn ' t she just go to
_ the gap
_
and take suggestions
? had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better
. the comedy is supposed to progress when drew ' s younger brother
( played with zest by david arquette
) reenlists to jump
- start his baseball career
. now
, how in the world can somebody as nerdy
(
but in a funny way
) as he can be the most popular kid in the school
.
.
. iin a day
?
! the dialogue in the film is
, well
, an embarassment
. her co
- workers
( molly shannon
, john c
. reilly
and gary marshall
) are in terminal hyper
- drive
. her teenage peers
( except sobieski
) are so inept
and stupid that there ' s little bite from them
. couldn ' t the filmmakers watch
_ heathers
_ first
? lastly
, i am proud to say tyhat i caught a significant gaffe inaddition the film
. if you see hte film
, ytou ' d know what i ' m talking baout
: drew walks into a bar
, has her hand stamped
,
and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious
, um
, cake
. she goes wild
, sleeps in lite
. when she wakes
, she rushes off to school
, without showering
, without noticing that her head
, lieing on her stamped hand all night
, has transferred part of the stamp ' s image to her forehead
, spelling
" loser
"
. funny
, eh
?
.
.
. except tath the hand would have transferred that image backwords
.
