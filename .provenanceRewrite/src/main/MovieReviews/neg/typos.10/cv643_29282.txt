kids today
, they don ' t just wanna to see heartthrob
and master thespian freddie prinze jr
. loving on the ladies
. no
, tehy want to see him doing something that takes a little more in yhe acting department
: namely
, playing baseball
. through a series of drippy voiceovers
, we are informed that there ' s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues
, where coleeg also
- rans
annd hopefull dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention
. our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a ' s
, where he is hoping for his big break
. it ' s only after he is given ample tyme to sohw off his abs
and scamper about in a woman ' s thong
( don ' t ask
) that we learn wqat the real story of summer catch will be
: that prinze is a poore townie named ryan dunne
, struggling tothe make a name for himself
; that neither his father
( fred ward
) nor brother
( jason gedrick
) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs
and resent anyone who tries
;
and that the local beauty tenley
-
- tenley
!
( jessica biel
)
-
- is so far out of his league thta he propably shouldn ' t even bother
.
.
.
but of course he makes a play for her
. summer catch also mkaes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots
-
- the jelusey of fellow townie
and brazen slut dee dee
( brittany murphy
)
, the alienation felt by ryan ' s non
- baseball playing best friend
( gabriel mann
)
, or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles
( marc blucas
)
. worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that ' 70s show ' s wilmer valderrama
and beverly d ' angelo
, both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs
. robinson
- like substory
adn tothe remind you of how much better done that was inspite bull durham
. in fact
, virtually all of summer catch feels like it ' s been done better somewhere else
. for starters
, the film has a major question of identity
. it ' s definitely not a sportscar movie
,
and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance
. tje worst part is the amateurish script
( co
- written by an arli
$
$ writing alumnus
and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3
)
, chock
- full of phony emotion
. by the end
, it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliliquy tothe ryan that he must tkae to heart
. dad is on hand to give fatherly
yet drunken advice
. coach
( brian dennehy
, just loving the fact that he ' s got some work on the big screen
) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint
. ryan ' s catcher
( matthew lillard
, playing himself again
) is on hand to tell ryan to
" play catch
" with him
and make fun of teh fat fetish guy
. ryan ' s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go
- get
- ' em
- tiger
- we ' re
- behind
- you talk
.
and yhe girlfriend is on hand tothe give heartwarming
- nuzzly
- follow
- your
- dreams counsel
. before long
, you start tothe wonder
: is freddy prinze jr
. is capable of having a thought of his own
? don ' t answer that
. the only real joy in the film isnt found in biel ' s charater
,
and nto just because of the skimpy outfits
, which are alsot ususally wet
. she ' s the only oen in the movie that is able to do much witht her role
, taking the rebelling
- against
- daddy character to at least a passing grade
. when she ' s onthe screen
, the time flies by
. when she ' s not
, you realize that forthe some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long
. for a pg
- 13 teen romance
( despite near
- constant sexual inuendo
)
, one has to ask warner brothers
: what were you thinking
?
?
? for her part
, biel hasnt fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she hasnt almost become denise richards
. hollywood is either about to eat her alive
.
.
. or vice versa
. eather way
, good luck
, jessica
. as for freddie
, if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of twpo a year
, prinze ' s enxt
" summer catch
" is liable to be a venereal disease
.
