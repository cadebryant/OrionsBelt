. comments
: when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he had made a name for himself as a first
- rate comic book penciller on the
" spider
- man
" titles
) to join the newly
- formed
, creator
- owned image comics
, a new comic book legend was born
: spawn
. mcfarlane ' s
" spawn
" immediately became a commericial
and crtical success
and a defining comic book series of the 1990s
. mcfarlane created a hero who was nto onyl original
but visually intricate
, alowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to hte max
. tyhe eearly
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane ' s genius at illustration
and show his early attempts at writing
. with the popularity ofthe
" spawn
"
and thte success of the current warner bros
. ' s batman film franchise
, a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn
. in the summer of 1997
, hence
, new line cinema released spawn
, a live
- action film based on the groundbreaking series
. this topheavy exercise in violentce
annd special effects unfortunately topples quickly
and leaves fans of the comic book
, liuke me
, numbed by how much spawn misses the mark
. whta happened
? why is spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire
adn even appears in a cameo
. i don ' t think
,
however
, that his presence necessarily hurt
( or helped
) the film
. i place the blame
, in part
, on tyhe recent hollywood trend
, fueled by public demand apparently
, for special effects blow
- out movies utilizing the latest coputer technology
. these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else
: character
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting this trend
, shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters
and filled wiht unnecessary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires
, explosions
, knives
and chains appearing out of nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constantly transforming demons
. a lot ofthe it is visually interesting
anbd technically solid
, don ' t get me wrong
,
but
, because the script
and cast aren ' t engaging
, spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper
( the surface may capture the eye
,
but nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn ' s translation of tjhe comic book suffers the most at the storyline levle
. mcfarlane ' s spawn was a tortured hero
. a mercenary by trade
, al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda
. having died
and journeyed to hell
, he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda
. simmons
,
however
, discovers that his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
and his wife married
. despite his sometimes violent nature
, readers couldn ' t help
but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld
. spawn attempts to show all of this
but does not spend nearly the timne it should to dont so
. when the characters are developed
, they seem absurd rather than touching
. the cartoonish dialogue
and implausible subplot
( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat
- 16 which he wishes to unleash tothe enslave the world
) do not help matters
. spawn
, in an appaent attempt to duplicate the success of batman
, also unwisely spends too much time on a villain
, the violator
( batman favored the joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, like jack nicholson in batman
, receives top billing in the cast as thge violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) is second
. i oridinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence iin films which seems to amking him a perfect candidate for the violator
. thge film
,
however
, spends so much time on the violator ' s offensive antics that they grate on yhe nerves
. apparently meant to be hte comic relief in the film
( as nicholson was in batman
)
, especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn
, the violator ' s lines are oftentimes grotesque
and unfunny
, leaving the audience wishing he would leave
. leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role
,
but he is seen far too often infact the film
. michael jai white
, a relative newcomer tothe theatrical releases
, seems to be an appealing actor
,
and he handles his role adequately
,
but we see little of him without various masks on
. more time needed to be spent onthe white ' s character before he became spawn for the movei to pull at the heartstrings
. a special note should be made baout martin sheen as the over
- the
- top
, obnoxious
, evil general wynn
. easily the hammiest performence in the movie
, it ' s hard to imagine how sheen mucked uv his role so much
; aftter all
, he palyed a vietnam assasin brilliantly in yhe great apocalypse nowe
. sheen ' s excessive demeanor do not halp tghe audience accept him as a mastermind villain
and comes as a suprize considering his extensive career in film
. many other elements conspire with the disappointing script
and abundant special effects to drag spawn down
. mtv
- style
, jerky
, in
- your
- face editting is one of them
. flames
, for example
, roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting
. cogliostro
, unlikely wannabe guide for spawn
, serves as a poor narrator for the film
. he goofily tells the audience
, at one point
, that
" how much of
[ spawn ' s
] humanity is left remeniss to be seen
,
" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another
. the music
, finally
, assaults the audience as much as the manic violentce
and offensive dialogue
. loud
and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes
. to be fair
,
however
, marilyn manson ' s
" long hard road out of hell
" effectively compliments spawn ' s return to earth
, while filter
and the crystal method ' s
"
( can ' t ytou
) trip like i do
" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song
. for as good a comic book as it is
,
" spawn
" did not spawn a good movie
. spawn
, instead
, suffers from too much pomp
and circumstance
,
and too littel plot
and character development
. it receives two stars for its technically well
- done special effects
. many other films
,
though
, have equal
, if not superior
, special effects
and are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems more violent than many r
- rated movies
and probably wouldn ' t be appropraite for the very young
.
