and humid

then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland
. both ramirez
and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist
and have been sent to earth as punishment
. connor nowe has the option to return being the last noe
but opts to stay whith his new found immortality
adn fight to find out about thge company
and the shield
. katana meanwhile
, fearing connor would return
, sets out himself to kill the highlander
. if you have never seen it
. being a fan of highlander
and mr
. connery
, i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii
: the quickening
. i wish it had been quicker
. i feel whatever else you can say about a film
( bad script bad music
, etc
.
) if you sit just plain bored through most of it
then nothing much else needs to be said
. the film was short
but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so
( the time mr
. connery is onthe the screen for
) is worth watching
. the plot sounds a little ridiculous
but i was willing to give it a chance
. maybe they could pull it off
. instead
, i find that the characters hve completely changed from those in the first film
. it ' s as if they are different people with the same names
. witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of thte resistance
-
- where is thte attitude of
" who wants to live forever
, when lvoe must die
" gone to
? the love sub
- plot
* must
* have had footage cut out
. tghe highlander
and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before
. putting our heroes iin deadly situations
and
then having them walk away becuase of some new power is very annoying
. i still want to know why connor ' s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal
! we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it
, nor are we told why advanced aliens still ule swords to kill
. why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck
? i know the head needs to come off
but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first
. to be fair one assassin tried this
but he must be the world ' s worst shot
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- like powers of laser beam deflection
. as for
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion on zeist
, crushed easier than a grape
and
then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns tothe zeist
. two assassins are sent
, presumably htey are meant to be good at killing
but an aged connor kills them both with no problems
. no more assassins are sent
. katana
, supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor
. has he no moreso assassins
? has he no better
? why was the rebellion crushed so easily
then
? michael ironside isnt totally unconvincing
( bring back the kurgan
)
. he seems like a cartoon character
and really isn ' t that evil
, just stupid
and violent
. we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again
and killing lots of innocents
.
yet he still seems like no threat
-
- perhaps because he seems too stupid tothe threaten connor
, or maybe beacuse his two best asssassans wouldn ' t have beeen amiss withthe larrry
, curly
and mo
. so much for plot
and characters
. the music is atrocious
. it is at best intrusive
and at worst annoying
. bring back queen
. there was an audible sigh
( of relief
?
) wehn connor played a queen track in a juke box
. i believe this at least is tothe be corrected fo the american release
. the acting is at best flat
, except for mr
. connery
. lambert is uninteresting
and when he delivered
" there can be only one
" thsi time around it jstu made me wish there had only been one
-
- highlander
. michael ironside is unconvincing
; sorry
, michael
, i usualy like ytou
and everyone else was incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually the film is interesting at all times
. it has a blade runner feel tothe it
and some of the special effects are quite stunning
. add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film
-
- or is he smirking to himself
? his lines
and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all
but hey
-
-
* i ' d
* ahve done it for 12 million
. oh
,
and i agree with a previous reviewer
, she
* does
* look like sharon stone
but i believe it is her frist film
. incidentally htere is a line producer credited
and i hear rumours of highlander iii
: the wizard
.
