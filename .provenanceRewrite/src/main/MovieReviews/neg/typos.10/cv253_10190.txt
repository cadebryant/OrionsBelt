hey
, i ' ve got a great idea for a movie
! ok
, here it is
: we ' ll get tim allen tothe pull angry faces forthe about two horus or so
! what ' s that
? sounds too boring
? ok
, how about this
thne
: we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours
,
but half of them are angry looks
and half of them are
" i ' m in pain
!
" looks
! what ' s that
? that still doesn ' t sound funny to you
? how about if we through in some
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still not funny
? if you anwsered
" noone
, that doesn ' t sound funny
"
,
then
( ding ding ding
!
) you ' re absolutely correct
! for richer or poorer isnt a moronic farce about a rich married cuple
( played by tim allen
and kirstie alley
) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best know as newman on tv ' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them in trouble for tax evasion
. what ensues is a badly scripted
and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell
. what makes this all wrong isnt tath nobody seems to have whta the film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing up
, the married cuple isnt brad
and caroline sexton
( allen
and alley
)
, a popular snobby duo who seem totally inthe love to everyone else
,
but in reality are on the brink of divorce
. just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it ' s fianl thread
, brad discovers that his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton ' s names
. the irs catches on
,
but since everything points back to the sexton ' s
and not lachman
, there isnt nothing much to do
.
.
. except run away
and join an amish community
. first time screenwriters jana howington
and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle
- out
- loud moments
,
and even some decent laughs here
adn
* way
* over there
,
but there is so much to cringe at iin this horribly made film that yuo ' ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn
. alley is absolutely unwatchable
,
and the chemistry bewteen her
and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade
( which
, i inform you
, was total b
. s
.
)
. allen
and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons
, nor are htey very convincing as an amish couple
! this entire movie isnt one bad ill
- conceived notion that should have beeen curtailed from thte very beginning
! hte amish in this movie are also flimsy
and unconvincing
. it ' s such a trite
, stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast
( noticing that they ' re all predominantly tv figures
) were probably the only ones they could get
! bryan spicer ' s directing doesn ' t help one bit
, either
. iin fact
, listing spicer ' s filmography
( which includes the firt
" power rangers
" movie
adn the big screen adaption of mchale ' s navy
) is more of an insult than a r
? sum
?
! now that i ' ve preety much run for richer or poorer into tje ground
, i will let you in on the best thing about it
. it bumped seven films up a notch on my
" worst of
" 1997 movie list
. taht ' s right
, thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year ' s worst
, six films are now not seemingly as bad
,
and a smile like yours
, previously inhabiting the number ten spot
, now doesn ' t have to suffer tghe ridicule of making my bottom ten list
. if you look at it in that respect
, for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all
!
