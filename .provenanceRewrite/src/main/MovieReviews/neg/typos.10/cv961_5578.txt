barb wire
, pamela anderson lee ' s firt foray inot films
, highlights tghe fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets
. being the only notable member of the cast
, the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity
, making her character ' s catch line
,
" don ' t call me babe
,
" sound very ironical indeed
. ffrom the very opening of tghe movei
, we are treated to a striptease routine ffrom anderson
, ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe
. throughout the movei
, there is ample footage of enormous breasts
and cleavage
, if not of anderson ' s
,
then at least of the female extras
. this alone is enough to retitle the movei babe wire
. for a plot
, barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline
. it is 2017
, thge middle of the second american civil war
,
and barb wire
, a former resistance fighter
, runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead
(
!
!
)
. known for attracting resistence fighters an d characters of all sorts
, tyhe bar attracts tje attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi
- style uniforms
. in between bashing up helpless males
and showing off her trademark breasts
, barb wire hasnt tothe halp a fromer lover
and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town
, past the government
- controlled areas
,
and to freedom
. even yhe airport looks like teh one in casablanca
, except that the plane in the backround is a modern
, private jet
. there are hardly any significant moments in this film
,
and one gets the impression tyhat it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version ofthe
" barb wire
.
" if anything
, one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts
. who could fight
and jump in a skimpy
, strapless leather top
,
and
yet keep her breasts from spilling out
? only a stuntwoman
. not pamela anderson lee
.
