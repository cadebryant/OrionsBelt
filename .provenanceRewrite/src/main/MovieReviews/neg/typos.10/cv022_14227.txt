" knock off
" is exactly that
: a cheap knock off of an action movie
. it ' s also the worst movei i have seen thus far this year
. i figured it would be at least a cuple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998
,
but alas
, it has already been found
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i think
) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half
- brother hasnt been supplying him with cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme ' s partner
,
and rochon plays
.
.
. actually
, i have no idea who rochon wass supposed to be
. she just sort ofthe popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there
. many things are not explained in this film
,
bu i do know that for smoe bizarre reason
, van damme seemed to be doign a jackie chan impression throughout the flick
. where chan comes off as endearing in his
" normal guy
" character seen in many of his films
, van damme just comes off as a wimp
. we ' re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions
. to be more claer
: i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie
,
and even
then
, it was not made too clear
. the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme ' s last movie
, the bad
,
but not nearly as bad as htis
,
" double team
"
) never lets the camera rest for a second
,
and that ' s no exaggeration
. we are even treated to a five second shot from tghe point of view ofthe van damme ' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i have no probelm with directors who want to play around with film conventions
, as long as htey don ' t get carried away
. for example
, look at sam raimi
.
" army of darkness
"
, one of his best movies
, features some of the most inventive camera wrok i have ever seen
,
but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story
. that ' s a concept that tsui can ' t seem to grasp
. the special effects
and outrageous camera angles
* rule
*
" knock off
" to the point where the audience doesn ' t have a clue as to what ' s hapening any more
. another problem with the film is that it looks cheap
. the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching noe of those chinese films shown really late at night
.
and for some inexplicable reason
, everyone ' s voice seems to hvae been dubbed
. even the stars
.
and even the special effects
, seemingly the onyl aspect ofthe the film the director actually cared about
, are inconsistant
. for example
, there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window
. the car slams into the ground
,
and the left wheel is completely destroyed
. seconds later
, the car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i have no problem suspending my disbelief iin an action movie
,
but a line must be drawed somewhere
. finally
, the acting
. nobody gives a good performance in this film
. van damme
, an actor i usually like
, is way off the mark playing
" everyman
"
.
and schneider
, here tothe provide comic relief i assume
, is totally unfunny
and over acts his way through every scene
. even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- hte
- top performance as
.
.
. once again
, i have no idea who he was supposed to be
. in case i haven ' t
yet made it clear enough
,
" knock off
" is the worst movie of van damme ' s career
and possibly tje worst movie of the decade
.
and it ' s not even one of those movies that ' s so bad it ' s funny
. it ' s too inept tothe be funny
. there are no redeeming factors in
" knock off
"
adn i seriously hope that every print of htis film is burned to a crisp
and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased
.
