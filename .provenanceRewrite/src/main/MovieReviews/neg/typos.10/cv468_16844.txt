the
" fab 4
" of ronald reagan high are four stuck
- up girls
, played by rose mcgowan
, rebecca gayheart
, julie benz
anbd charlotte roldan
, who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes
. their daily ritual is to parade uv
and down the school halls like royalty
,
and thier constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so htey cxan check thier make
- up
and powder their cheeks
. under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating infront publich
. infact writer
and director darren stein ' s jawbreaker
, it isn ' t as funny as it sounds
. in fact
, it isn ' t funny at all
. stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers
and stripped it of any inteligance
, wit or charm
. his actresses toss off their lines so fast that tehy don ' t have time to add any emotion
.
and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains
. the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4
, liz
, who is referred to as
" thge princess di of reagan high
,
" be killed whn a prank by the other 3 goes wrong
. the princess di reference is in bad taste
, as is much of the movie
. granted
, bad taste cant sometimes be funny
,
but the mere presence of bad taste doesn ' t guarantee it
. liz ' s girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger tahn a golf ball in her mouth
, tape her mouth shut
,
and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car
. when they open teh trunk later
, liz is dead
. they eventually put her blue
and bruised body into a sexual possition
and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape
. these realistic
adn disgusting scenes of a dead
, seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget
and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer
. the film ' s dialog not only isn ' t funny
, it ' s trite
. one nerdy young girl introduces herself with
" my name is fern mayo
, as in hold the mayo
.
" when fern discovers what hasnt happened
, the fab 3 make her an offer she can ' t refuse
-
- make
- up
! they cake it on her
and welcome her to the clan
. thte parents in the movie brag baout learning parenting skills from watching oprah
. the teachers fare no better
, especially in the ridiculous lines they are given
.
" miss shayne
, please cover your bosom
,
" one young teacher
, who has been made up to look ood
and ugly
, says without any conviction
.
" this is a learning institution
, not a brothel
.
" besides the obvious question ofthe why this movie was ever made
, ther isnt one otehr question that i ' d like to ask the director
. why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway
? in a cameo
, pam grier plays detective vera cruz
, who investigates liz ' s murder
. as she interrogates the other people
, she stares at them like they are all idiots
, proving that she isnt the only one that gets it
. i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie
, she ' d walk out after about 5 minutes
,
and you ' d be well advisd to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it
. jawbreaker runs 1
: 27
. it is rated r for violence
, gore
, profanity
and sex
. i would advise everyone to avoid it
,
but if teenagers go htey should be older
and mature
.
