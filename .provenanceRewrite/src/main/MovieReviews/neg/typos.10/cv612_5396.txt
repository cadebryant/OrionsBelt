joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made infact very recent memmory
. the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it
. it has a solid cast with tom hanks
& meg ryan as the lead roles
.
but you can never judge a movie by its cast
.
.
. if there is one ogod thing about joe vs the volcano
, it is that the plot is original
. unfortunatly
, it is also incredibly stupid
. the movie begins with joe
( toom hanks
) going to work
. this opening sequence is very boring
annd slow
. it shows joe walking tothe his office
.
but on the way
, he has to wait in a long line passing by strange
and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting
. a sequence like this should tkae 2 minutes
. here
, it tkaes over 5
.
.
. it is obvious that joe hates his job
. at his office
, one of his co
- workers is meg ryan
. oddly enough
, she plays 3 different roles in this movie
!
! joe leaves to go to a doctor ' s appointment
. his doctor informs him that he has a
" brain cloud
.
" this means that in a few monthes
, he will die
. so wqat does joe do
? quit his job
, of course
!
! when he arrives home
, joe meets an ood man named graynamore
( lloyd bridges
)
. graynamore tells joe that iin order to get some important mineral for his company from an island
, the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god
. by a startling coincidence
, thge boat trip tothe the island takes a few months
. by the time he reaches the island
, he wiull almost be dead from the
" brain cloud
" anyway
, so joe agrees
. graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this
" great adventure
"
. joe goes on a date with meg ryan
, his co
- worker
. the day before teh boat trip
, joe meets one ofthe graynamore ' s daughters
. she is also
, surprise
, meg ryan
. except she looks more hippyish
. they both have dinner
annd the next day
, joe gets driven over to his boat
. the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore ' s daughters
.
and
, wonder of wonders
, she is also played by meg ryan
. as they sail to the island
, meg ryan tells joe that teh natives of teh island have a craving for orange soda
. after some stupid talking scenes
, they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went tothe
.
and that thge
" brain cloud
" thing was made up
!
! they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage
. joe goes fishing
and catches a hammerhead shark
. this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times
.
but
, tothe top it off
, the shark is obviously rubber
and fake
!
! one nght there is a storm
. a cheap
- looking lightning bolt strikes the boat
and everything is casted overboard
. fortunately
, joe
and meg ryan manage to fidn some of the luggage that joe brought to sail
. by pure luck
, they get to the island
. since the natives like orange soda
, they wear soda cans as attire
!
! stupid or what
?
;
) before joe leaps in thte volcano
, he gets fed
. right befor he jumps
, meg ryan pleads him nto to
. wehn joe decides to
, she goes inaddition with him because
" she loves him
"
. now this is where the movie should end
.
but
, unfortunately
, the
" cheesy ending
" bug comes inaddition
. the volcano blows the couple out
and into the ocean where htey land on joe ' s luggage
. they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out ofthe the volcano towards the villagers
. i give this movie a
. see it only if you ' re a film buff that enjoys a bad movei eveyr nowe
and
thne or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan
.
