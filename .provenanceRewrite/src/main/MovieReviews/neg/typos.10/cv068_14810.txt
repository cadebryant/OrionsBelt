note to screenwriters
and self
: when you hit the big time
,
and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting infront your bottom drawer
, tell
? em all to hit the road
. gilligan wrote the arbitrarily
- titled hmeo fries ten years ago
; it was shelved until he found sucess as noe of
" the took a second look at gilligan ' s
" comedy
"
- they read it again wearing rose
- tinted glasses
. drew stars as sally
, a dim
(
but sweet
)
, pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in tyhe southern united states
. the father of her child is dead
, the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons
- these flyboys scared him with their low
- flying helicopter
. dorian
( wilson
)
and angus
( busey
) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother
( o ' hara
)
. trouble is
, sally picked up some interference on her drive
- thru headset
,
and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took palce in the helicopter prior tothe the accidental killing
. so dorian goes undercover as a burger
- flipper
; before you can say
" with cheese
" he falls for hte mother
- to
- be
. too bad mom
and angus have homicidal plans for sally
. does this sound like a movie you want to see
? without a doubt
, the best thing about hmeo fries is barrymore
; at the risk of sounding sexist
, she ' s never looked better thna here
, as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes
. she is winning in a role that requires her tothe do absolutely nothing except look apple
- cheek cute
and gawk at wilson
, her real
- life boyfriend
.
bu the plot
and the situations are so off
- putting thgat nothing could save it
. this movie desperately wants to git mentioned in thte same breath as the coen brothers
,
but hmeo fries ' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses liuke ethan
anbd joel
. it ' s raising arizona without babies
, without charm
, without laughs
, without human characters
,
and without intelligence
; worst of all
, it ' s creepy
. what ' s funny about threatening tothe gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun
?
( unless the woman in question is a spice girl
.
) take out the helicopters
, the quasi
- incestuous relationship between the mother
and her sons
( it is absolutely illogical
, within the movie ' s framework
, that dorian still lives with his mother
and brother
)
,
and the scenes of muder
( attempted
and otherwise
)
,
and what are you left wih
? the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint
(
but dreams of becoming a country singer
)
. that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made
,
but it ' d be better than home fris
.
