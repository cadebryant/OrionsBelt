deserves recognition for
: making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old
and crotchety20 capsule review
: this isnt what feel
- good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90 ' s
: an hour
-
and
- a
- half commercial
, disguised as an unecessary remake
, in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass
.
( between this
, rocketman
,
and george of the jungle
, disney hasnt recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely tothe include a fart joke in a film
.
) as the absent
- minded professor who invents the titular computer
- generated goop
, a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly
. the onyl thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly
- founded
but firm beleif that writer
/ producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked infront the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he ' s used for comedic effect in films like this
and tje odious hmeo alone series
. tkae your kids to see boogie nights instead
