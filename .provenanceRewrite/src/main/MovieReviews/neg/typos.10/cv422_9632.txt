" spawn
" may be somewhat of an older film
. in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn ' t seen it will finally get to see it
( that is
, if htey see it
)
.
but i managed to catch it befoer it made it ' s way out of theaters
and into the world of rentals
and
, god forbid
, video cassette purchasing
. it wasn ' t the worst film ofthe year by any means
. it isn ' t even on the top 5 ofthe the worst films of the year
.
but it did manage to top tyhe bottom five of the bottom ten
, which
, in simpler terms
, means it comes in at number 6 on my
" worst of 1997
" list
. the only reason it doesn ' t cmo in lower is thanks to the special effects
, which might actually have been some of the best of the year
. performances
,
however
, were either wooden or
, for yhe most part
, unforgivingly campy
. inwhich fact
, this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness
! even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality
. i don ' t know how to explain that one
; it wasn ' t exactlly choppy
,
but something about it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo alomst makes it as clown
,
but not quite
. he isnt the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional
.
but the main problem i found with
" spawn
"
, as with most films that wind up on my
" worst of
" lists
, is that it was just plain boring
. i wouldn ' t even say there was a climax to the film
. sure
, it had the big battle scene at the end
,
but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, the movie did conclude in a very simple
, disappointing way
. even
though it ' s one ofthe the shorter movies i ' ve seen this year
, it ' s one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again
. like i said
, tyhe speshal effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride
, no matter how small
. i ws impressed with the opening sequence
, so long as i didn ' t allow the melodramatic voice
- over
and lobotomizing editing tothe get to me
.
and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn ' s outfit created
.
bu even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes
, which looked quite a bit like a modern video game
. who knows if
" spawn
: the video game
" wasn ' t part of the plan from the beginning
? keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable
,
and in a very small amount
, makes up for the cheeziness of it all
.
but none of this movie ' s saving graces can it make it something i ' d recommend seeing
, no matter what the price of admission
. this movie is definitely not fo young children
, which shouldn ' t really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers
, if anyone
, would likely find it appealling
. if you really want to catch a movie
, there are many better ones out there
, no matter what your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" has vrey little to offer even the most avid moviegoers
!
