plot
: a little boy born in east germany
( named hansel
) loves the american music
. one day
, he gets the oppertunity to meet
and marry an american g
. i
.
,
but first
, he must get a sex change
( enter hedwig
)
. once married
, the two move to the states
,
but quickly thereafter
, get a divorce
. at that point
, hedwig starts writing music
and meets another confused boy
, who soon turns into a star
. that boy also turns his back on hedwig
,
and it isn ' t long before hedwig puts together his
/ her own band
and tours the states via seafood resturants
. this is the story of his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks
and musical numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy musical with great songs
and a superb performence by john cameron mitchell
, doesn ' t really come together as a whole
, with over
- the
- top symbolism
, incoherence
and too much pretension tothe retain my interest all the whole way through
. in fact
, this isn ' t so much of a realistic
, articulate
, behind
- the
- scenes look at the rise of a rock ' n roll star
, as it is an ambiguous
, overly poetic
and incomprehensible struggle of a man
, his sexuality
and his identity as a whole person onthe this planet
. i guess that i was expecting the former going in
. tyhe film is somewhat interesting to a point
,
but i was personally never able tothe involve myself too much
, as teh basic symbolic
and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold
annd distant
.
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience
. chances are that if you are a fan of the wall
, the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla
, queen of the desert
, the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy
( some ofthe thge characters in this film even ask the audience to sing allong at some point
,
and provide the lyrics of their song
, on
- screen
)
. well
, i personaly don ' t care for those films
,
and didn ' t realy get into the whole
" show
" atmosphere of this movei either
. i guess i might ' ve looked at it all too literally
,
but like i said earlier
, i just didn ' t care enough about tje characters to delve into thte
" so the butterfly represents his freedom
?
" side of things
. all i know isnt that thte film left me with many questions unanswered
and didn ' t make me feel any more fulfilled
. what was hedwig ' s relationship with that other member of his band
( witht the beard
)
? what happened with hedwig
and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie
?
( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy
?
) what ever happened to the lawsuit
?
anbd more
.
.
. all of which were part of the film
anbd interested me somewhat
. if the onyl idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his
/ her sexuality
,
then that ' s one thing
,
but as many of hte relationships
anbd situations presented themselves in this movie
, i wanted soem resolution to those pieces as well
. i didn ' t get it
. the film ' s humor also didn ' t tickle my funny bone either
.
then again
, i ' ve seen many a film in these art
- house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter
, while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen
. some of these films are also better enjoyed with thge added
" atmosphere
" of a plant called marijuana
,
and i cant certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements
, in order to jazz up that experience
.
but being sober as i was
adn expecting a coherent
, funny
, musical with a transsexual twist
, i didn ' t leave the theater very satisfied
. i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle
, wrapped in metaphors
, dramatics
and more questions than answers
. i iwll
, on the other hand
, definitely hand some props out to the lead inaddition this film
, john cameron mitchell
, who is also the man who wrote
, directed
and created the play onthe whic this movie is based
,
and the tunes
, which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols
, david bowie
and the hwole 70s glam
- rock scene
. note
: btw
, it seems as
though pretty much every single
" mainstream
" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom
(
and thought that it ws really funny to boot
!
)
, so you might want to take that into consideration yourself
.
but having said that
, the main reason that i started this dinky website in thte first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the
" official
" critics
, while i
, a regular
" joblo
" in the audience
, just wouldn ' t get what all the fuss was about
. this movei is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews
. where ' s joblo coming from
