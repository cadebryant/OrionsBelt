so much for sweet returns
. after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80 ' s slasher movies
, starting with 1996 ' s
" scream
,
"
and followed by
" scream 2
,
"
" urban legend
,
"
and the original
,
" i know what you did last summer
,
" a film like
,
" i still know what ytou did last summer
,
" was bound to be made sooner or late
. it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out
,
and that is because they reached for the lowest
- common
- denominator in filmmaking
, favoring non
- stop deaths
and gore for suspense
,
and trading iin fleshed out
, likable characters for one
- dimensional nitwits
. it has been exactly one year since julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis
, a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends
and she accidentally hit in the middle ofthe the road
,
and
then
, thinking he ws dead
, dumped him into the ocean
. sicne
then
, julie has relocated to boston university
,
and
althought often paranoid
annd haunted by bad dreams
, she has beeen able to put her life back together
. when julie ' s friend
, karla
( brandy
)
, is called up by a radio station
and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is
, she wins a vacation to teh bahamas for four people
, which also includes karla ' s horny boyfriend
, tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
,
and will
( matthew settle
)
, who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
, also returning from the original
)
, doesn ' t show up
. when they reach the secluded island
, they discover it is the last day of the open season
,
and will be stranded there fo the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them
. of course
, julie
, her friends
,
and the workers aren ' t the only ones there
, as the murderous ben willis
, dressed in fisherman garb
, returns to seek revenge on julie once
and for all
. it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like
,
" i still know what you did last summer
,
" is made
. i am a very big fan of horror movies
,
and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to
" ikwydls
,
" which i am a fan of
, is almost an exact replica ofthe a
" friday the 13th
" movie
. while yhe original focused more on the story
and characters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn ' t return to write the sequel
,
and it shows
)
,
" i still know
.
.
.
" has no sotry to speak of
,
and is so vacuous of ideas
, tyhat the filmmakers
, were forced tothe have a murder ocurr every five minutes just to keep the audience interested
. also gone are any signs of character development
,
and since every single character died before i got to nkwo them
, all i was left with was tothe stare at the screen
, indifferent to what was going on
. while i cared baout the fates ofthe the characters in the orginial
, it made no difference tothe me in tihs sequel who lived
and died
. tehy were all paper
- thin
and pointless
, except to become victims to the lethal hook of teh fisherman
. another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set
- pieces
, like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar
,
but there are none to speak of in this sequel
(
although they do come close at oen moment iwth brandy
)
. since so many people were killed every couple minutes
, the suspense
anbd scares evaporated faster than salt in water
. also of note is the mystery of the second killer
,
and accomplice tothe ben
,
but it is obvious from the first frame who it is
,
and so i couldn ' t even have fun at that
, like i did in yhe
" scream
" movies
adn
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures that just as slasher films were starting to git some recognition again
, a film would come along
and ruin it for everyone else
. maybe the people who made
,
" i still know what you doed last summer
,
" should have realized that in order to make a ogod movie
, you must have a screenplay
-
-
- or at least one that isn ' t such a black hole for thoughts
and ideas
. the ending ofthe tyhe film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part
,
but judging from this amazingly lacklustre first sequel
, everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead
.
