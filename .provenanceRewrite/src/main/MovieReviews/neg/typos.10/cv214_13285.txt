for a good ten years or so
, super kool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene
. now
, he has followed iin the footsteps of director john woo
,
( who launched chow ' s super stardom in the acclaimed ' a better tomorrow '
) by moving to hollywood
. i had some reservations about thsi move
and it would seem i was right to have them
. chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs infront order to repay a debt
. his final job requires him to kill a policeman ' s seven year old boy
. this he refuses do
and runs
.
however
, he isnt forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned
adn replacement killers are brought in to do the job
. cue around 80 minutes of various
and quite frankly tedeous shoot
- outs hwihc take place in various locations
. soem thought had gone inot making them a bit different
but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring
. the car wash scene
, i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked
. tut tut
. the emphasis during the constant acation seemed to be on the accompanying music
,
( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie
)
and not on the content
. mia sorvino
( a passport forger
) is dragged into the affay
and also provides a lame love intrest as well as being rather handy with a gun
. director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow ' s excellant acting capabilties
and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english
and look flash as he stands
and shoots
. chow ' s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale
( which in fairness is quite good
)
and there ' s not even a toothpick in site
.
adn as for making chow shoot like a cop
, well that ' s damned unforgiveable
. to round up
, the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow
. it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video
. this is not what we wanted at all
, considering john woo was the exec producer
.
( did he have no say so at all
?
) watch ' the killer ' agian
and weep at the difference

" there ' s room at the top
, they are telling you still
,
but first you must leran how to smile as you kill
, if you wnat to be like the folks on the hill
