ugh
. that about sums this movie up
. just
, ugh
. the originnal godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic
,
and when reviewing the previous films
, each film hadnt a certain degree of intelligence
.
and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following
; in spite of bad special effects
, horrible dubbing
,
and a man in a lizard suit
, they maintained a certain degree of
.
.
. how to put this
?
.
.
. dignity
? not quite the owrd i ' m looking for
. yuo understand
, right
?
and in 50 years
, godzilla has maintained that degree of ' whatever '
. leave it to america tothe screw thge wohle thing up
.
> from thte ' geniuses ' thta brought us
" independece day
"
, arguably the worst sci
- fi movie of all time
, to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had
. while they do bring us eye
- popping special effects that will amaze you
, they lost waht was at the center of all the original godzilla movies
-
- a storyline
. summing up the movie is simple
. heck
, i can do it in one sentence
: giant lizard attacks a giant city
and a bunch of nobodies stpo it
. simple as that
. matthew broderick stumbles over his lines
,
and it ' s hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog
- walking character on the televsion show
" mad baout you
"
. the dialogue seems to be improvized
, almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all
. i cxan see the scene onthe hte set right now
.
" all right
! we spent all of this money making big special effects
,
and we ' ve gotta git tihs movie out by summer or it ' s going to bomb in our faces
. so
, you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head
, all right
? make uv something
, m ' kay
? good
. roll film
!
!
" the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing
,
anbd some of the cinemtography is well
- done
( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind
)
. still
, an hour into it
, you will become antsy
, wondering how long they can drag it out
.
and drag it out tehy do
!
! i have tothe laff
. thte slogan for the film is
,
" size does matter
"
. i think they cut this too short
. it shouldnt read
,
" size does matter
. acting does not
.
