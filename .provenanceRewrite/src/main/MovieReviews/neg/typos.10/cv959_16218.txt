" virus
" is a monster movie without a monster
. any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise
. sadly
,
" virus
" doens not deliver
, on any level
. the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something
( we never find out what
) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it
. sudddenly
, a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space
,
and winds up destroying mir
and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat
. cut to seven days later
, we meet donald sutherland
and his band of seafaring vultures
. see
, they spend all their timne sailing arround looking for dead
- in
- the
- water ships to rescue
,
and
hten collect the reward money
. at least
, i
* think
* taht ' s what they do
. along with many other things in the film
, their reason for being outloud in the middle of the ocean isn ' t really explained
. so
, they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it
,
and deside to haul it back tothe russian waters
. the only problem is
, the crew starts disappearing one
- by
- one
and turning into borg
. yes
, borg
. complete with thge red laser beam in place of an eye
. apparently
, this aline lifeform cant only survive if inside something electrical
. so
, it creates make
- shift machines
and uses humans for
" spare parts
"
. blah
, blah
, blah
. i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so
- called plot
,
but i won ' t
. suffice it to say the most original hting about this movie isnt having donald sutherland play an irish man
(
!
)
. everything else in this movie has beeen taken from other
( better
) movies
. for exmaple
, many of the machines resemble those found in the little
- seen japanese movie
,
" tetsuo
- yhe iron man
"
.
and the plot is right out ofthe
" aliens
"
. the funny thing is
, i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie
. i hve a soft spot for cheesy monster movies
, like last years under
- appreciated
" deep rising
"
.
but
" virus
"
, as i mentioned earlier
, doesn ' t even have a monster
. it just has a big pile of circuits
and wires
and expects the audience to fear this rediculous looking contraption
.
" virus
" is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it
. besides the lame
" monster
"
, it ' s chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say
,
and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into
. forthe example
, there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to
* negociate
* with the alien
! now
, i don ' t know about you
,
but if i came upon a lifeform thast viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated
, i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it
. that makes baout as much sence as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life
. finally
,
" virus
" isn ' t scary
. the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movei just a little scary
. as it is
, it ' s about as frightening as a box of cookies
. skip
" virus
"
. if it ' s a cool monster movie ytou want
, rent the far superior
(
and the granddaddy ofthe this genre
)
" aliens
"
