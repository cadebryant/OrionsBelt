godzilla is a nuclear freak
. he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years
and has become a new species
, one that has a foot as long as this bus
,
and a claw as long as this sign
. this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands
. he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men
. one survived
. onyl he was left to recount the terror that he had seen
. he was merely able to repeat the words
" godzilla
.
.
. godzilla
.
.
. godzilla
"
. the film
then introduces us to matthew broderick
, a biologist who has been studying the fascinating growth ofthe chernobyl earthworms
.
" they ' re 17
% larger than they used to be
!
" he proclaims
. the u
. s
. miliraty pulls him off this three year project
and assigns him to figure out what godzilla is
.
anbd
, boy
, does he find out
.
and
, boy
, does godzilla suck
. i hate to use such a word inwhich a review
, something thgat isnt supposed to inform my audience
,
bu i really need to drive this oen home
and i refuse to use explitives
. it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw tje final cut
and said
,
" ok
! it ' s grat
! let ' s show this puppy
.
" roland emmerich needs a good horse whipping
. his latest piece of trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece ofthe modern american cinema
.
and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films
, emmerich
and his team of talent
- challenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as to how the creature should look
. let me give you a fewd examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking
. i plan on giving some things away here
. belive me
, godzilla holds no surprises fo anyone witht an iq higher than their shoe size
, so
.
.
. no worries
.
however
, if you are looking for that
" first time thrill
"
anbd you refuse to let me do you this favor
, by all means
, stop reading now
. a
.
) godzilla mkaes his first ever attack in the pacific islands
. he next strikes in new york city
. um
.
.
. anyone have a map handy
? b
.
) the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual withthe parted gray hair
and thick glasses
. his name isnt mayor ebert
. his assistant is named gene
. gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of thte film
. i couldn ' t make this up if i tried
, folks
. c
.
) stay with me on this oney
.
.
. ok
. godzilla can out run torpedoes
. hank azaria can outloud run godzilla babies
.
( which look more liuke jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors
.
) d
.
) the u
. s
. military
, upon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city
, decides that he
" might be hiding in a building
.
" e
.
)
( oh yeah
, i can go all the way to e
.
) godzilla strikes at manhattan
. manhattan
, an island approxiately the size of san francisco holds three million people
. they evactuate to new jersey in about one day
. no problem
. f
.
) early on
, they bait godzilla wtih fish
.
( he likes fish
, you know
.
) the thing is on an island
. the atlantic ocean is three steps east
,
but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fith
and 57th
.
.
. oh he ' s gonna come running
. g
.
) you know what
? i ' ll stop with the list now
.
.
. the alphabet isn ' t big enough anyway
. the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old dont a re
- write
.
" the kid is good
!
" he must have said
. maria pitillo is looking to become a name inwhich hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster
. bad move
, maria
. acting doesn ' t get much worse than her turn as broderick ' s ex
- flame
. matthew broderick is a good actor
,
but you ' d never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his you ' d seen
. jean reno needs to pick his american films a bit more carefully
. at times
, godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker
, abrahams
, zucker film
.
( airplane
!
, naked gun
.
) the jokes are indeed that bad
.
bu just when you tihkn the filmmakers are having fun with you
, htey take themselves seriously
. how dare they
! godzilla would have been better if it had onyl thrown in visual sight gags
and fart jokes
. at least
then we would nkwo we were supposed to laugh
. each
and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid
and i was really pulling for the beast to kill moreso of them
. emmerich did do one thing
,
though
.
(
and i ' ve no idea if it was intentional
.
) he made me sympathize iwth godzilla
. his attackers were so damn dumb that i felt sorry fo him being pelted with bullets
and missles
.
but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced
.
