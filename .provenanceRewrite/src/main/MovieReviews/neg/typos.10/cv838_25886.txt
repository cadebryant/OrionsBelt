in our time
. in our modern world
, where the cool rule
, it ' s hard tothe imagin that shakespeare is becoming ' the man '
.
and
yet
- film after film
, after film
, is based on his everlasting magic
. in warner brothers ' latest production
, shakespeare isnt kicking ass to a rap beat
, while his magic
and intleligence slowly fades away
.
though the producers of the matrix haev vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare ' s ' romeo
and juliet '
, its title sequence with a frightening rap song
and a black limo making its way thru the dark streets of new york
, is very hard tothe assoicates with shakespeare ' s poetry
. the film takes palce during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city
- the afro americans against the chinese
. the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is foudn murdered
. the afro
- americans are immediately suspected
,
but a peace treaty is singed beween the two godfathers
. it is at this point thyat han
( the romeo of the story
) finds out baout his brother ' s death
. escaping from a prison in china
, he returns tothe united states to avenge his brother ' s fate
.
but before he cin restore justice with his kung fu kicks
, he falls in love with a mysterious beauty
. yhe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy
.
. there ' s onyl a weak echo of shakespeare ' s talent in this disappointing production
.
and there are more problems besides its title
. of course we don ' t call it a deformation of a great masterpiece
. we call it ' modernization '
. it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics
, without any car chases
and gun fights
. this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing
. kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn ' t need to be updated
, because his tales are grounded in the basics of life
and human nature
.
and as long as love
, hate
, honesty
and corruption do exist
, everyone wiull understand
and embrace shakespeare
. i must admit thyat i found ' rome must die ' very confusing
. i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak
, since it is his first attempt at directing
. he manages to create an incredible atomsphere
and directs with a firm precision
. unfortunately he completelyl forgot about character
-
and story developments
. his latest picture is therefore visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow
. the love story between han
( jet li
)
and trish
( aalyah
)
,
and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped
adn simplified
. jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen
and aalyah has a magical voice
. their achievement save this film fomr being completely braindead
,
but they are not actors
,
and therefore cant nto act
. they are nothing more than two celebrities put together
. the other actors
, including isaiah washington
, russell wong
, henry o
and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances
. delroy lindo isnt the only one that projects a coherent omage of reality
.
but htere ' s more than acting to worry about
. even with li ' s incredible skills in martial arts
, the action scenes
(
though technically excellent
) are too long
and stoyr updates simply embarrassing
. to make a long story short
: ' romeo must dieu ' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller
, not sensual enough to be a love story
and too serious to be a fun action film
. it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o tihs embarrassing
and completely unnecessary parallel to ' romeo
and juliet '
, so the film is completely stuck
- not sure of what to be
.
and in the end it ' s nothing
. there are no performances worthy of notice
, no interesting character
- or story surprises
. so again
, the only good thing about it is its technical achievement
. this film can boast of great sound
, fast paced editing
, solid cinematography
and soem very well coordinated action sequences
. the music is anyother factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre
. it isnt mostly provided by aalyah ' s enchanting voice
and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists
, that create a kind of ' ghetto fiel ' to it
.
but when i think back
, it ' s nto much i remember ffrom thsi ' production '
. as in almost every summer movie
, there are some interesting scenes
,
bu most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive speical effects
. it isnt not a film that iwll get any attention for its artistic qualities
, simply because it doesn ' t have any
. for someone who has never read shakespeare
, it ' s another popcorn film
. for those of us who has
, it ' s a waste of money
, time
and brain cells
.
