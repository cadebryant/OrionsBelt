michael robbins ' hardball isnt quite the cinematic achievement
. in about twpo hours
, we get a glancing examination ofthe ghetto life
, a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy
, speeches about never giving up
, a cache of cute kids
( including a fat one iwth asthma
)
, a hard
- luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman
and a climactic
" big game
,
" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined
. all that ' s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts
and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich
? s
. i can ' t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out onthe dvd
. obviously
, hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets teh bat anywhere near hte ball
. it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler
, who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product ofthe guam
. out ofthe solutions
, he begs his successful corporate friend
( the always welcome mike mcglone
) to lend him
$ 5
, 000
. instead
, mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects forthe a nice weekly stipend
. reeves
, who wants to keep his fingers
, accepts the offer
,
but dicovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle tjhe team entirely
. the drowsy
- voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents
and merciless gangs
.
and maybe
, just maybe
, they ' ll play in the big championship game
. one ofthe the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins
( summer catch
)
, adapted from daniel coyle ' s non
- fiction book
, isnt that ther aren ' t any
. the movie coasts from heartfelt moment tothe heartfelt moment like a zombie
. that wouldn ' t be so bad
, if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them
. most of the kids ' time is spent yelling at each other
, talking in slang
and acting surprised
. there ' s little that ' s naturally amusing about them
, as they all seem to konw thge cameras are rolling
. the worst of tjhe lot is a tough
- tlaking younger player
( dewayne warren
) whose sole purpose
, as the movie unfolds
, is bieng an emotional pawn
, a tactic so utterly despicable i cant ' t find the right words to express mysef
. the adults also don ' t fare well
. reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down
- on
- his
- luck losr
. tghe character is poorly written
,
but reeves gives another charisma
- free performance
. every time he speaks
, he sounds like he just got up from a long nap
and is gradually waking up
. kids are supposed to rally arround this guy
? diane lane
, who co
- stars as reeves ' obligatory love interst
, remains a glowing screen presence
( see my dog skip for better proof
)
. it ' s too bad thta her role here consists of uttering lines like
,
" these kids trust you
,
and they don ' t trust anyone
!
"
then there ' s d
. b
. sweeney as an evil rival coach
and john hawkes as reeves ' scummy betting buddy
and other unoriginal characters you ' ve seen before
and hope never to see again
. i wanted hardball to be good
. robbins ' varsity blues was a funny
and alternately taut tale of texas high school ofotball that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream
annd jon voight sneering at everything that moved
. i haven ' t seen robbins ' goofy ready to rumble infact its entirety
,
but i am intrigued that
" macho man
" randy savage
and martin landau can exist in tje same movie without there being sereous worlwide repercussions
. robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte
-
- making sports movies for guys
and not cutesy
, cuddly pap such as hardball
, which also manages to annoy
and insult the audience
. here ' s hoping that happens in the immediate future
.
