. i ' m not realyl sure what film that statment is describing because those words bear littel resemblance to tyhe slow
, completely uninvolving bore i saw
-
- at least
, it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of hte film
. alessandro nivola plays robin fleming
, a troubled
, directionless 21
- year
- ood who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town
. police sergeant phil quinn
( william sadler
) takes him in
,
and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious sories ofthe sneak
- outs
and sneak
- ins where robin slips out of his jail cell
, breaks a window
,
then returns
, all without quinn ever noticing
. also added to the pointless proceedings is soem woudl

,
howver
, is the cast
, who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy
and skill
-
- thus revealing the
_ real
_ purpose behind thsi listless enterprise
: to serve as a series of acting exercises
