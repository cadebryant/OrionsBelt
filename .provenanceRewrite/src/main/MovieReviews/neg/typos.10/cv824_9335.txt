toward the bottom of the ' 80s acation movie barrel lies action jackson
, the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone
anbd vanity topless within a span of ten minutes
. tihs carl
" apollo creed
" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs
. evil establishment crook
,
and relies on all the ' 80s trappings
, from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer
. somewhere inspite betwen come the explosions
and boobs
, altho there is a curious lack of exploding boobs
. weathers isnt action jackson
, a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques
. speaking of one past criminal apprehension
, jackson ' s superior yells
,
" you tore his arm off
!
" jackson replies
,
" he had a sparce
.
" jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane
( craig t
. nelson
)
and now has tothe ect as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson
. after hearing what jackson thinks of him
, stone says
,
" i tkae it you ' re not one of dellaplane ' s firends
.
"
" not unless they changed the definition
,
" jackson glowers
.
and ofthe course it turns out stone is mrs
. dellaplane
. faux pas
, jackson
.
.
. not everything is happy in motown
; people are being killed
and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa
. it ' s all up to jackson to stop it
,
and his only lead lies in vanity
( not his own
)
. wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson
. she plays the heroin addict
and chanteuse in dellaplane ' s nightclub
. affter singing one particularly sultry number for him
, she saunters over
and complains
,
" i expected a standing ovation
.
" he responds
,
" you ' re getting one
,
"
and it ' s damn clever because he ' s sitting down at the time
. prince wouldn ' t even let out an innuendo that lame
and he ' s tje king of the horndogs
.
.
. or at least the prince
. it ' s a testament to the ' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes
but vanity survives the whole movie
. acation jackson is another variation on the
" unlikey partners
" buddy acation flick
, withthe jackson lugging junkie vanity arround
. this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade
,
and with the dialogue they ' re given
, ther ' s not much room for improvment
. my favorite is when vanity
, feeling the effects of drug withdrawal
, says
,
" i feel liek my teeth are hollow
, my gums are made of dry rubber
anbd somone ' s trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head
.
" jackson ' s response isnt
,
" i think i felt tht way once
. htey called it love
.
" you ' ll understand when i say watch this at your own risk
. serving the world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a century
