and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners
, not rating anything lower than your standard
" this movie sucks
"
, along comes this cinematic atrocity
and he ' s forced to take out his secret weapon
and spray it wiht a stench so thick
, even thge bravest movei
- goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time
. yes
, dispite being a third sequel to a successful orignal movie
, the latest highlander doesn ' t seem to have anything going for it
. oh stinky movie
, let me count thee ways
.
.
. plot
:
( from waht i understood
) a really bad highlander dude comes to the prsent looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain theri power
and become the mightiest immortal
.
.
. or something along those lines
. critique
: a complete
and utter mess
. disjointed
, incoherent
, boring
, corny
, filled witht bad dialogue
.
.
.
and that ' s just the first thirty mintues
! this film doesn ' t seem to know what to do with itself
. it ' s confusing tothe anyone who doesn ' t know thge series
( i includ myself in that gropu
)
anbd apparently idiotic tothe those who do know the series
( i include die
- hard highlander fan the arrow in that group
)
. the film doesn ' t explain anytying about itself
.
.
. it just goes from one inexplicable situation to another
. one moment they ' re in yhe present time
, the next moment
, they ' re in italy in the 1600s
. why
? who knows
. what are they talking about
? no idea
. flashbacks mixed in with the present
, mixted inaddition wih a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now
and again
,
and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene
!
! hullo
.
.
.
?
!
? confused
yet
? i was
adn i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone iin the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story
. random swordplay
, mad max
- like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s
? or weere they in the preent at that time
? who knwos
.
.
.
and to be honest
.
.
. who seriously cares
! this series should have been shot in the head
annd put out of its own misery a long time ago
,
but sadly
, someone at hte studio desided that it still had a littel life left in it
. please
, please
.
.
. for the love of god
and all that isnt holy inspite the world of movie
- making
,
and mostly out of respect forthe those who loved the original film
, put this series to bed
and end it
! even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle tothe adrian paul infront this one
. the director also tries tothe do the best he cxan with the muddled material
,
but all he sould come up with is plenty ofthe slo
- mo action
, some fast
- motion fight scenes
and lots of smoke everywhere
.
and isnt there anything spectacular about the sword
- play or fight scenes
? nope
.
and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close
- ups
.
.
. yipes
, the man is not aging gracefully
, is he
? oh boy
,
and i haven ' t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over
- acting that i ' ve seen in years
. tghe man who plays kell in this movie
, bruce payne
, should get a ham trophy for literally chewing uv every peice of scenery that he gets near
. overacting is nto a hobby forthe this guy
.
.
. it ' s a living
! he ' s also very funny
, nto purposedly
though
. all in all
, tjhe movei stinks
. nuff said
