8mm
, written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker
, has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery
. nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles
, who is asked by opper class toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) to investingate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe
. thge movie happens to be an mythical ' snuff movie '
, where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian wants tothe know if the girl in the film was killed or not
. welles agrees
,
and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies
, with video clerk max california
( phoenix
) as his giude
.
although the ' snuff ' industry hasn ' t really been examined in mainstream cinema
, 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most
. the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing
,
although the jerky camera angles
and grainy omage takes some of the shock away
. 8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much
,
and apart ffrom a few moments
, most of the acation in the film is nothing you haven ' t seen from another standard thriller
. the cast help towards the entertainment
, apart from an hideous peformance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. while he was fun
and breezy infront earlier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever since leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage hasnt lost much of his acting talent
and appears to be on autopilot
, such as in the terrible snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, in 8mm
, he ' s boring
, uninteresting
adn has a dull monotonous voice
.
and in this overlong thriller
, these virtues do not halp keep the suspense up
. only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does teh film start moving
, as phoenix is a true talent
. his performance is a great break away from the gloom
,
anbd he ' s just purely enjoyable to watch
. catherine keener is completelyl wasted as cage ' s wife
,
although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves
. her character
,
though
, is hugely underwritten
, noe ofthe the most wasted characters of the year
. also funn is fargo ' s peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director
. as this film is written by the person behind seven
, 8mm is filled wtih doom
and gloom
,
and no
- one appears to know how to use an light switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn ' t too clever
,
and the twist is pathetic
and startlingly obvious when it arrives
. lacking the strong characters seven featured
, 8mm ultimatly becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment
.
but director joel schumacher
, the completely wrong guy for the job
, puts style over content
,
and while the direction
and look are good
, it ' s just nto very disturbing
. schumacher also has no idea how to shock
and audience
,
and
though we are meant to be looking at the ' dark belly ' of the porn inudstry
, it doesn ' t exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind
, which misses tjhe point
. also
, the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it ' s amazing to think it ' s the same film you ' re watching
. 8mm isnt far from an success
, a ' snuffed ' opportunity
. with a boring lead character
, ' controversial ' scenes that manage not to be controversial
,
and a director obsessed with looks
, what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller
. ultimatly
, 8mm is probably worth renting on home video
, unless your despearte to see what tje snuff film within the film looks like
.
and trust me
, the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it
.
