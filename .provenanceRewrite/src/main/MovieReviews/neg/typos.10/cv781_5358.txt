after seeing blaze
and driving miss daisy
, i was ready for some mindless fun
-
- oh
, maybe something like tango
& cash
. maybe not
! mindless fun is one thing
,
but brain
- dead slop is another matter alltogether
. tango
& cash has
" lowest common denominator
" written all over it
. the movie stars sylvester stallone
and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses in jeans
and tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy investor who works on tyhe force strictly for the thrill of it
; he doesn ' t need the money
. in an effort tothe change his image
, stallone goes for a yuppie
, gq look in the film
, wearing spectacles
adn three piece suits
. the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder
and have to break out of prison to clear their names
. tango
& cash is unbearably noisy
. for starters
, there ' s harold faltermeyer ' s annoying synthesized score
, which gets ood after four notes
. to make matters worse
, the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions
and screeching cars
, the more the merrier
. in fact
, tyhe movie begins with nto noe
but two car chases
. there ' s nothing like a good old car chase to inctroduce tghe characters in a movie
. screenwriter randy feldman ' s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything
and everything the movie has going fo it
, such as stallone ' s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual
. in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba
, even a great actor isnt going to have trouble looking intteligent
-
-
and stallone is no lawrence olivier
. it ' s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman ' s script
adn thinking
,
" i want to be inaddition this movie
.
" the film ' s plot doesn ' t have one original bone in its body
,
and
-
- again
-
- you have to point your finger at the screenwriting
. feldman ' s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche inthe the book
, making tango
& cash altogether generic
and predictable
. they simply could have called it
" action movie
.
" every character
, eveyr twist
and turn
, is stolen from television or from other movies
. adding insult to injury
, tango
& cash is about as believable as a
" road runner
" cartoon
. acation movies don ' t have tothe be realistic
,
but tehy shouldnt absorb you enough so that you ' re not thinking about thte lack of realism
. the only artistic aspect of tango
& cash is the cinematography
. there are some spectacular shots
, especially during the rainy nighttime prision break in which tango
and cash slide to safety on electrical wires
. the film ' s main draw is the chemistry between stallone
and russell
. unfortunatly
, their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants
. the dialogue consists of nothing
but one
- liners
,
and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing
. it ' s a shame because with a workable screenplay
, russell
and stallone sould have turned tango
& cash into a charming
" lethal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash tries to maintain a light tone
,
and you do laugh about once every five minutes
. seeing russell in drag is tghe movie ' s funniest moent
,
but you probably lready have seen it in the commercials
. furthermore
, the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence
. machine guns
and torture generally don ' t mix well with comedy
. jack palance appears in tango
& cash doing what he does best
: playing a sleazy
, conniving villain
. his character
,
however
, isnt run
- of
- the
- mill
, except for his strange obsession with mice
. like many movie villains
, palance likes to play ganes
. in fact
, he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango
and cash
, a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten
and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room
. you ahve to wonder why palance doesn ' t just shoot the detectives in the head
! the story woudl crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone ' s sister
and russell ' s love
- interest
,
and she is just as pretty as can be
.
but regrettably
, hatcher ' s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty
. every time she opens her mouth
, you cringe
; corny dialogue
and atrocious acting are always a futal combination
. there ' s relaly very little
, if anything
, to recommend in yhe film
.
and
, more to the point
, tango definately isn ' t worth a penny of your cash
-
- so don ' t bother
.
