the onyl thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential
and could ' ve been effective
. such is the case wtih
_ urban legend
_
, the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks
. the idea behind the movie is thta hte mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends
. examples include the killer inaddition the backseat of the car
and person getting calls from inside her house
. the killer wears one of those l
. l
. bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up
, so you can ' t see the face
. i guess haloween masks are out of sytle for psychos these days
. anyhow
, the premise is certainly a nifty one
and the opening scene is spooky
and atmospheric
. it ' s a very good setup that promises more chills to come
. unfortunately
, the film never takes off from htere
. the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus
. like most slasher flicks
, this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac
( or in this case an axe wielding maniac
)
. i ' ve alwyas wondered why these killers don ' t save themselves a lot of time
annd trouble
and just go after the person they ultimatly aim to kill
. after the fine first scene
, the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you
- thought
- it
- was
- the
- killer
-
but
- was
- just
- somene
- else scares
. these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music
. i guess sudden
, sharp music chords are whta passes for terror these days
. teh actual killer will attack at about every third music blast
. the slasher appears
, attacks
, thge victim is eviscerated
,
and the tedious cycle appears anew
. false scares should always be used in moderation
. someone needs to tell director blanks that things liek this jstu aren ' t as scary as htey used to be
. this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit
-
- it ' s not frightening
. remember the horror movie cliches that weere so mercilessly mocked in
_ scream
_
and
_ scream 2
_
? this movie still adheres to them
. tons of illogical moments about
; more thna i really hve the inclination to list
.
and i don ' t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense
. that type of illogical can be fun
. this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember
. the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ' ll be laughing more than you ' ll be screaming
. actually
, you won ' t be screaming at all
. at its best
, the acting can barely be called
" adequate
"
and the scirpt could ' ve definitely utilisied a rewrite or two
. the film still manages to have some strong points
. the killings are certainly inventive
and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans
. there are some intentionally funny moments
.
( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones
.
) thte film is well made from a technical standpoint
. besides the first part
, there is also another good scene
, a prolonged cat
and mouse chase inside a radio station
. if there had only been more sequences like this
, that relied on tautness
and suspense rather than loud bursts of music
,
_ urban legend
_ might ' ve been worth your money
.
