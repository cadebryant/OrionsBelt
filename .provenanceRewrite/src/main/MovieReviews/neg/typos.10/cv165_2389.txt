what are we going to do with jim carrey
? viewers of television ' s
" in living color
" know this one
- man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill
. viewers also know that
" in living color
" is a skit
- show
and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way
. unfortunately
, this fatc was forgotten by the makers ofthe the carrey comedy ace ventura
: pet detective
. three writers
, including carrey
, worked on tyhe slapstick story
, whic sends a self
- styled
" pet detective
" on the trail ofthe a stolen dolphin
. the missing mamal belongs to the miami dolphins
, who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl
. for plot porpoises
, this story works as well as any three stooges short
. carrey gets to do his
" official
" schtick as he snoops around greater miami
. he leers
and sneers
, craning his neck to funny effect
. he even doens his captian kirk impersonation
. again
. all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until teh point that you realize that the writers ahve absolutely no intention ofthe focusing on anyone
* other
* than carrey
.
( suggested alternate title
-
- jim carrey
: will do anytying forthe a laugh
.
) export it tothe france
and you may have a hit
. as it stands
, ace ventura isn ' t even good kid ' s stuff
. the profanity count
, alone
, is too high
. which is ironic
, since children are
, probably
, carrey ' s best audience
. the film doesn ' t even have the goofball charm of chris elliott ' s recent noone
- brainer cabin boy
. sure
, carrey has his moments
.
but what can you say about a film whose high
- points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from
" mission impossible
?
" ace ventura has one glaring incongruity
. amid the butt
- jokes
and double
- takes
, the scirpt takes great pains to set
- up an elaborate
and rather funny
" crying game
" gag
.
and
, for
* this
* intended audience
, that takes
( ahem
) cojones
.
