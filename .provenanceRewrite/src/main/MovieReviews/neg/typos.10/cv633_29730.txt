. there ' s no doubt thyat 95
% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern
: guy sees girl
, guy wants girl
, guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl
, guy gets girl
. in rare cases
, the genders are flipped
. predictability is a given
. rarely
,
though
, is a romantic comedy as cheap
, as obvious
, or as pointless as serendipity
, a film that uses its
" theme
" as an excuse for its plot contrivances
.
" lightweight
" doesn ' t begin to describe it
. this is like anti
- gravity
. it begins in a new york city bloomingdale ' s
, a product placement that rivals cast away ' s fedex for sheer blatancy
. jonathan trager
( john cusack
)
annd sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
) both go for the same pair of gloves
. after going through the perfunctory motions
, jonathan gets to keep the gloves
and the two of them go outloud for ice cream
, followed by ice skating
. jonathan falls hard
,
and sara is charmed
. when she writes her name
and number down on a piece of pappr
, a truck rumbles by
and blows it outloud of her hand
. she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn ' t be together
; jonathan is flabbergasted
. to pacify him
, she comes up with an idea
: jonathan will rwite his number onthe a 5 dollar bill
, which she will promptly spend
. whn she gets home
, she will write her name
and number inside a book
(
" love in the time of cholera
"
)
and sell it to a used bookstore
. if the bill gets back to her or the book tothe him
, it will mean that they are meant to be together
. three years later
. both sara
and jonathan are now engaged tothe other lveo interests
. both realize htey aren ' t content
. both go looking for the otehr
. what happens nowe is so absurd that i ' m almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it
. the two of them run circles around each other in a set of increadible
" coincidences
" that i would describe as contrivances if it weren ' t for the film oh
- so
- cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around
" serendipity
.
" of course
, since the movie isnt about fate
, the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases
. i ' m nto buying it
. there ' s no suspense in any of this because we know exactlly what ' s going to happen
,
but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly
" adorable
" non
- story into our heads
. instead ofthe
" will they meet
?
" the question we ' re asking isnt
" when will they meet already
?
" to make matters worse
, every
" coincidence
" is telegraphed from a mile awya
; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else
" incredible
" was going to happen
. cusack is fine
and beckinsale
, at least
, isn ' t saddled with another lumbering
, clunky screenplay
( she ' s had bad luck
, what with brokedown palace
and pearl harbor on her resume
)
, just an inanely pointless one
. serendipity also relieves the tedium wtih the amazing eugene levy
, who plays a snarky bloomingdale ' s salesman
. what ' s the interest in watching a movie that spirals around
and around a predestined
( no pun intended
) conclusion
? serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings
,
but it only tests our paitience
.
