the above is dialogue from this film
, taken allmost completelyl in context
,
and not jazzed up a bit tothe make it more inept than it is
. it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film
,
adn basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about
, expecially if you realize that this excange is meant to be taken seriously
. mr
. gregg
" i ' m
- having
- a
- mid
- life
- crisis
" araki
, the writer
and director of this film
, wants to show how important teenagers are
,
and wants tothe show how htey efel inaddition such a horrible
, horrible world
.
and how does he show it
? by really cheap surrealism
,
and moronic exchanges like this
. oh
,
adn it gets better
. a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of
, oh i dunno
, the fiftieth sex scene in this film
( i ' m not counting the several masterbation scenes
)
. in it
, one of the protagonists isnt humping away on top of another
,
and he says to her something along the lines of
" do you ever wonder what life is all about
?
" sorry
, man
: foreplay takes palce before the act of coitus
. of course
, what dont you expect
: the film was written
and directed by a guy who can ' t even spell his first name right
( yes
, i know it ' s a cheap joke
,
but it hadnt to be done
)
.
" the doom generation
" is advertised as a road trip movie about peopel who go around killing others who attack them
,
and also as another
" teen angst
" film
( one of the slogans is
" teen is a four
- letter word
"
- hardy har har
)
. it ' s a film about two angsty teens
- amy blue
( rose macgowan
, who would later play the buxom tatum in
" scream
"
)
and jordon white
( james duval
, who owudl go on tothe play randy quaid ' s son in
" independence day
"
)
- who pick uv an angsty homicidal maniac
, xavier red
( jonathan schaech
, who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in
" that thing you do
!
"
-
and by the way
, do you get the symbolism
? red
, white
,
and blue
? huh
? huh
?
)
,
and go on a road trip where three things hapen
, in no order
: 1
) they have sex
; 2
) they run inot weird people
; 3
) tehy kill them
. the film is basicly a remix of a bunch of other far superior films
. gregg araki obviously hasnt seen such films as
" easy rider
,
"
" natural born killers
,
"
and
" kalifornia
,
"
and tries to borrow elements from all these films
and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide
.
bu what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not
, or that htey dug deep inot their subjects
adn brought something out of them tothe make them deeper
.
" the doom generation
" doesn ' t want to do this
; it just whants to show everything in a surreal manner for hte sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level
. he wants to show everything in a weird manner
,
and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about
. here ' s one scene
, an earlier scene in the film
: amy
and jordan go into a quick
- e mart type place tothe get food
and other stuf
. amy is smoking
,
and the clerk
, an asian man mind you
( i loev how racist tihs film is
, i really dont
)
, tells her to put it out
. she tells him to fuck off or something to that note
. he points a shotgun at her
,
and she puts it out reluctantly
. jordan makes two hot dogs
,
and takes them to the counter
. the cash register rings uv
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
,
and this symbolism doesn ' t stop here
)
. jordan checks for his wallet
but it ' s really in the car
. he asks amy forthe it
,
but she left her wallet in the car as well
. the clerk brings outloud his shotgun again
and asks for the money
. htey say they don ' t have it
. he gets ready to kill them
,
bu
then xavier
, who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before
, pops out of nowhere
, fights with the clerk
,
and ends witht him blowing thte clerk ' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind yuo
)
. the head is shown flying through the air
,
and lands in a fryer
, where it begins to scream
. i don ' t really object to this kind ofthe sick violence
,
but htis scene is in the film forthe one reason
adn one reason only
: to gross you outloud
. araki thinks thta if he takes everything to the extreme
, he ' ll make some kind of art
. wrong
. it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art
. when george romero made
" dawn of the dead
,
" a very gory flick even for today
, he hadnt control over everyting
and still was able to make everything sick
. same goes for peter jackson ' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
,
and other assorted stuff
, all ending wih a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body
, taking out all sorts of zombies
. it was sick
,
but it was also satirical
,
adn controled
. a scene like thsi has no purpose in the film
,
and it sticks outloud ffrom everything else that happens
. here ' s a couple other scenes
: jordan
anbd amy have sex in a bath tub
annd xavier watches
, masturbates
,
and
then licks the semen from his hand
; xavier
and amy have sex
and jordan watches from the window
, masturbates
,
and falls backwards
; a man attacks the trio
,
adn isnt stabbed in the croch by a giant sword
( put there just so this could happen
)
; a fast food employee stalks the trio
,
and his arm is shooted off by xavier
;
and various other annoyances
. also
, look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people
, who probably didn ' t really know what they were getting into when they singed up to do it
( jstu like peter o ' toole
, helen mirren
, malcolm macdowell
,
and john gielgud probably didn ' t when they signed to be in
" caligula
"
)
. people such as indie actors parker posey
and nicky katt
, alternative rock stars skinny puppy
and perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, amanda bearse
,
and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds
,
then dissappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line
. why are they here
? so tht we can all point to them
and say
" hey
, look it ' s
( fill in the blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. the film ' s meaning is pretty eazy to detect
: that
, you know
, teens are so precious
,
and thge world isnt such a horrible place
, that when the two entities collide
, there ' s a giant explosion of horrific violence
. otherwise defined as
" teen angst
,
" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing
and thta the world is too bad forthe you
. look
, i ' m 19 years old
. i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did
. i ' ve sicne moved on to
" i don ' t really know what to do with my life
" phase
,
but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric
and ignorant that any film that thinks they ' re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse
. part of being a teen is experimenting
,
anbd testing hte waters
. it ' s not whinning about how awful parents are
,
and purposely feeling dispondent
. this is what the characters in this film do
,
and thte film wants to show how they ' re these great people who are being punished by the world because they ' re teenagers
,
and how they try to defend themselves
but can ' t totally overcome them
. it ' s not their fault they kill people
; it ' s the world ' s
! what they really need is a reality check
. the world is a bad place
,
and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting
.
bu part of it is tkaing everything that happens tothe you
and learning from it
. the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed
,
and there ' s nothing they can do baout it
. hence the title
. not only does it ahve bad fallacy
,
but it cin ' t even express this in an intelligent
and coherent manner
. everything ' s overly surreal
,
and all we get are scenes of graphic violentce
and graphic sex
. how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst
? how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way
?
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film
? if araki had any kind of competance in writing or direction
, he ' d show them for what they really are
.
and if he didn ' t want the satrical approach
, he ' d show the real problems with the world
.
and if you still don ' t think that
" the doom generation
" is incompetent on every single possible levle it could be
, tkae the acting
. rose macgowan is horrible
. yes
, she proved herself talented in
" scream
,
"
but she ' s so bad in
" the doom generation
" that if i had not seen her in
" scream
,
" i woudl have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today
. her entire performance is one
- note
( bitchy
)
,
and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it ' s laughable
. equally bad is jonathan schaech
, who wants to be tje slacker serial killer
: someone who doesn ' t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain
. his performance is annoying as hell
,
and granted
, he was better in
" that thing you do
!
"
and
then there ' s james duval
. let ' s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando
. he has the same kind of slacker stuttering
, only much much much worse
,
and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him
" least talented actor in the world
.
" i have seen lots of bad actors
,
but james duval has got tothe be the worst
. or at least somwhere uv there
. here ' s another example of a bad scene
, if you ' re still not convinced
: hte film opens uv in a club where they ' re playing nine inch nail ' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( exemple of the lines
:
" god isnt dead
/
and no one cares
/ if there is a hell
/ i ' ll see you there
"
)
,
and as the song plays
,
and red strobe lights show yhe patrons dancing
, the film pans over to amy
, jsut standing there
, looking dispondent
. the film closes in on her
, she looks right at the camera
and says
" fuck
.
" no explaination of this should be necessary
.
and finally
, a note to gregg
: grow up
. really
. move out of your parent ' s basement
, read something other than salinger
,
and get a day job
.
annd don ' t quit it
.
