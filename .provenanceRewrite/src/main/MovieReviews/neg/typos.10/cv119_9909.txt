apparantly money talks
.
.
.
and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so
! i ' ve always considered myself pretty oepn about the gratuity a film can possess
, whether in language
, violence
, sex
, or what have you
. i fidn that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movei goes overboard
,
and money talks definitely does
! it ' s not so much that the movie swore nearly constanly
(
and i mean constantly
!
)
,
but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent
and way too staged
. perhaps if one character were foul mouthed
,
but in thsi film
, everybody swears nearly every otehr word
. money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett
( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker
)
. franklin is your typical con
- man
and ends up with moreso than one person out to get him
. when the plot finally gets underway
, there ' s no less than threee people
( or groups
) tht want him
, dead or alive
. the frenchman who ' s somewhat responsible fo franklin ' s escape from a prisoner
- packed bus
, a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand
,
and the cops who wrongly suspect him of muder
. franklin ' s only hope
: james russell
( charlie sheen
)
, an investigative reporter for the local news who ' s out tothe prove himself a worthy journalist
. james offers to help clear franklin ' s name if franklin will jstu allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week
. both of these elements are completely lost allong the way
however
,
annd never dont reappear
. as expected
, the odd couple of franklin
and james do wind up firends at the end
, which is anyother wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way
. there isnt just nothing original or intriguing about this film
,
and so many developments are either non
- relevant
, or just plain forgotten about
. money talks isnt a paint
- by
- numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience
. frivilous dialogue
, a predictable
, flat storyline
,
and two
- dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money
.
