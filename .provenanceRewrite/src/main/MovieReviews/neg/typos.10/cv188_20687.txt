an exerience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer
. yuo may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified peice of garbage
, which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it ' s hollywood existence
. when i think of the screenwriters behind this film
, i picture a room full of monkeys
. tyhe monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves
. all of the monkeys combine their efforts
, hop in a cab
and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark ' s office
. the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up
and down on clark ' s desk while flailing his arms
and shrieking
. the director appears to be deepo in thought
, until he slams his fist down on the desktop
and exclaims
` i love it
!
!
! ' the writing behind thsi project is embarrassing
. for your amusement
, i will explain the plot
. dr
. kinder
( kathleen turner
)
and dr
. heep
( christopher lloyd
) are two of the cold
- hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute
, where pceuliar studies are going on
. as the story goes
, htere is an ancient myth explaining that babies
( ages 2
adn under
) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences
. when they move past this phase
, they become like any other drooling toddler
. kinder
and heep want tothe unlock the secrets useing their test babies
, namely little sylvester
( sly for short
)
, who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at hmeo on the mission
: impossible team
. there is so much crap derived from this premise
, despite the fatc it ' s virtually identical to the plot in look who ' s talking
!
( a far superior film in any league
)
. you will be able to determine the quality ofthe the film by examining the opening scene
. sylvester has broken out
and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect
and kung
- fu tactics
. question
: it ' s obvious the babies are super
- smart
,
but why are they able tothe fight like jackie chan
?
? the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers
. it ' s a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes ' familiar home alone formula
. i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude
and endless 90 ' s knowledge
, quoting numerous movies
and insulting their adult captors
. the effects inwhich baby geniuses
( similar to the talking animals in babe
) are pathetic
, the editing is a disaster
,
and the jokes are never funny
. teh onyl reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babys are
` cute '
. i suppose they are
. i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute
. otehr instances
,
though
, i was howling infront laughter due to the inane stupidity of thge script
. there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever
; their entire existence is based on punch lines
. peter macnicol
and kim cattrall
, as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester ' s twin
, are both miscast
.
thne again
, i don ' t suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid
. meanwhile
, dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench
( hahaha
)
. i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs
. instead of watching this
, i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement
and going snorkeling
. or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark
- infested waters
. anything to avoid this painful movie
. the final line in the film
, spoken by the bratty sylvester
, is
` if they think i ' m doing the sequel for less than
$ 20 mill
, they ' re nuts '
. sequel
? please have mercy
.
