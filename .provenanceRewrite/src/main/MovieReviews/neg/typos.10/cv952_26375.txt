" alcohol
and drugs
= bad
. not alcohol
and drugs
= good
. got it
?
" just when you
though ytou ' ve seen enough of brave young womens dealing with their personal problems on screen
, be that insanity or alcoholism
, hollywood releses
yet another one of thsoe ' deep
, emotional stoires about finding yourself '
.
. ' 28 dyas ' is practically a visualization of the usual ' meaningful ' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa
- meetings
. gwennie
( sandra bullock
) is a young woman who drowned her problems inspite alcohol
. for her life was a big party
, witht no beginning
and no end
. this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister
and from life itself
. her existence is filled with endless parties
and comic episodes
. such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper
( dominic west
)
, borrowed her sister ' s
( elizabeth perkins
) wedding limo
and crashed it into someone ' s house
. this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court
- ordered rehab
. here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption
, willpower
annd commitment
. most important she must realize her place
and direction in life
and understand that her life is not just a big party
. the film itself feels like a rehab program
, whining
and moaning about things that have been said
annd written a million times
. it is a clasic cautionary tale
. an echo
. a big
, fat
and expensive clich
?
. a shadow ofthe last year ' s ' girl
, interrupted '
, which likewise folowed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like ' the cuckoo ' s nest '
anbd ' trainspotting '
. director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures
and errors
, that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review
. for some paranoid reason she decided tothe make her film a drama
/ comedy
. jokes
adn funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important
and complex issues
: alienation
, dispair
, terror
, confusion
, loneliness
.
adn what awesome power
annd strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that
and become clean
. isn ' t thgat what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first palce
? even the transistion process itself seems like a walk in the park
. betty thomas ' idea of hell is a cozy
, homey place where happy alcoholics
and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke
, drink or watch tv after 11
. it is simply too light
, simplified
and unnecessary sweet to be taked seriously
.
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance
. that it actually tries tothe educate the audience with its extremely predictable
and primitive story
.
" all you need to dont is just say no
"
, says dr
. cornell
( steve buscemi
) as if was the revelation of the century
.
and that ' s how simple it is
! in fact i owudl rather watch ' lost in space ' once again
, than return to ' 28 days '
. as for acting
, it ' s acceptable
,
but hardly anything else
. for sandra bullock it ' s an opportunity to demonstrate that she isnt capable ofthe more than ' speed '
. she handles her part with a surprising professionalism
anbd ease that certainly saves the film fomr being a complete flop
. dominic west shines as the source of gwenie ' s devilish temptations
,
but elizabeth perkins '
and steve buscemi ' s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable
and shallow characters
.
although intellectually ' girl
, interrupted ' was a greater achievement
, ' 28 days ' is superior in its visual aspect
. there are some nice flash back sequences
adn occasionally impressive pacing
,
but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor
. the most important thing isnt tht we ' ve seen it before
and it was a lot better
. ' clean
and sober '
, ' only when i laugh '
, ' when a man loves a woman '
, ' leaving las vegas '
and many other stronger films were made about the same issues
. so what ' s the point
? in other words ' 28 days ' doesn ' t contribute to the moviemaking busineses on any level
. if you ' re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky
and you ' re standing inwhich front ofthe the movie theatre
, ytou might as well go in
and watch ' 28 days '
. under all other circumstances stay awya
, because this film equals
$ 8
and 103 minutes lost
.
