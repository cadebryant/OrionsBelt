, national lampoon introduced us to a newyorker family
- the griswolds
. in 1983
, the griswolds embarked onthe a cross
- country jouney with the destination of wally world
, a world
- renowned theme park in california
. we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild
and crazy mishaps the family endured
. twpo years later
, we watched again as they went to europe
,
and four years after that
, we shared christmas with them
. now
, eight more years have passed
,
and the laughs have done more than dieu
. they ' ve been cremated
. vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold
, the good intentioned
but ill
- fated father of two
. the premise is basicly the same
. clark has a wonderful idea to take his family onthe a bonding vacation
, this time to las vegas
. his wife ellen
( beverly d ' angelo
)
and teenage kids rusty
and audrey
( alwyas played by different actors
- this time around
, by ethan embry
and marisol nichols
, respectively
) join him
and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos iwll make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick
. ofthe course a
" vacation
" movei wouldn ' t be complete without good ole eddie
( reprised by randy quaid
)
, the misfit cousin
, showing up at all the wrong times
. there isn ' t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it
. it ' s raelly just a skit movie
. there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie
, which is not a real term as far as i know
. the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two ohurs
, therefore coming off like a two hour skit
. the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits
, each lasting about five minutes
. vegas vacation comes off like the first
. a good exmaple of the latter would be last year ' s black sheep
. the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast
,
and it doesn ' t really fit into a movie mold
. inthe these cases
, a
" plot
"
, which is generally very thin
, is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to tyhe gags
( i
. e
. have a good vegas joke
, make a vegas movie
)
. such is the case with thsi movie ' s mini
- plots
. clark gets gambling fever
anbd begins spending all of the griswold ' s money
, ellen is on the verge ofthe an affair with wayne newton
(
!
)
, rusty has a fake id
and isnt using it to his gambling advantage
,
and audrey isnt desperate for funn
and winds up joining her cousin vickie
( shae d ' lyn
) as an exotic dancer
. the simple fatc is
: this movie isn ' t funny
. at first
, i did find myself chuckling heartily at a cuple of little jokes
,
but when hte movie got rolling
, my interest suddenly stoped
. chase plays clark griswold really well
. he made the character
adn he is the character
. d ' angelo
, to be quite honest
, never was too impressive as ellen
,
and this movie doesn ' t show any signs of redemption
. as for the two new griswold kids
, the owrd
" blah
" comes to mind
. the
" vacation
" series seems out to prove that anybody can play theese two characters
, the simple reason being that there is nothing to them
. they ' re so generic
, you ' ll expect the credits to read
" girl
# 1 as audrey griswold
"
. vegas vaction differs fomr the first three in the series by more thna just laugh factor
. yes
, it ' s true that vegas vacation isn ' t even close to bieng close to being as funny as the others
, which weere actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways
,
but there are a couple ofthe other things that set this one negatively apart
. first off
, why did they leave off the national lampoon ' s heading onthe the title
? i couldn ' t find any reasons why
,
bu maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn ' t want to be asociated with such a lame film
. that ' s saying a lot
, especially when you look at what else the comapany has proudly presented
: loaded weapon 1
, pcu
, etc
. if tehy expected this to be another hit
, ytou would assume they ' d be proud to tack on the notorious header
,
but for reasons only we can guess at
, liuke the movie sucking
, they didn ' t
. there is another difference here that makes an obvious inpact
. the first three films in the
" vacation
" series weere written by john hughes
, a talented writter who is behind sevral popular films of the 80 ' s including mr
. mom
, sixteen candles
, the breakfast club
, weird science
, pretty in pink
, ferris bueller ' s day off
, planes
, trains
,
and automobiles
,
and uncle buck
. wowzers
! what a r
? sum
?
! looking at hte names
, you ' d think this guy wrote everything tyhat now stands as a movie icon for the 1980 ' s
. well that ' s not all
. this guy also brought us 90 ' s hits including the home alone series
, thte remake of 101 dalmatians
, dennis the menace
,
and teh current flubber
. vegas vacation
,
however
, didn ' t have john hughes behind it
,
annd the loss is vrey obvious
. this time around
, the script is in the hands of elisa bell
, whose only credits thus far includ four made
- for
- tv movies
. vegas vacation plays very much like one
,
and it would actually work much better as a made
- for
- tv sequel
. if this sounds like a wild idea
, it ' s not
. revenge ofthe the nerds third
and fourth installments were both television movies
,
and they seemed like it
. vegas vacation would fit in well on tyhe fox network as a 2
: 00 a
. m
. sunday morning movie
,
bu as a silver screen major motion picture
, it ' s quite outloud of place
. stephen kessler ' s jejune direction doesn ' t help things either
. he only makes the film even more tv
- movie
- ish
. each consecutive
" vacation
" movie hasnt suffered a drop in directing power
. we started the series off with harold ramis
, who allso directed caddyshack
and groundhog day as well as co
- writing ghostbusters
. not too bad
.
then we had national lampoon ' s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling
, who would go on to direct the hits look who ' s talking
and clueless
, as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high
. lastly we had national lampoon ' s christmas vacation
, directed by jeremiah s
. chechik
, who went on to direct the charming benny
& joon
. kessler
, so far
, has one title under his belt
, the short film birch street gym
, which received an oscar nomination in 1992
. granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film
, we can allow for some amateurish quality
,
but instead we get a movie straight from the text book
- boring
, bland
,
and deeply unoriginal
. if you loved the
" vacation
" movies
,
and i know
* some
* of us did
, there still isn ' t anything here worth seeing
. if ytou loved them
, don ' t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tradgic example ofthe cinema ala carte
. if you never did like the series
, why the need to confirm why
?
