i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it easly last year
, when matthew perry had just signed on
. i ' m big fan of perry ' s subtle sense of humor
,
and in addition
, i think chris farley ' s on
- edge
, extreme acting was a riot
. so naturally
, when the trailer for
" almost heroes
" hit theaters
, i almost jumped up
and down
. a soda in hand
, the lights dimming
, i was ready to be blown away by farley ' s final starring role
and what was supposed to be matthew perry ' s big breakthrough
. i was ready to be just amazed
; for this to be among farley ' s best
, in spite of david spade ' s absence
. i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran
. sadly
, none ofthe thsi came tothe pass
. the humer is spotty at best
, with good moments
and laughable one
- liners few
and far between
. perry
and farley have no chemestry
; the role taht perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade
, for it ' s his type of humor
,
and nto at all what perry is associated with
.
and the movie tries to be smart
, a subject best left alone when it ' s a farley flick
. the movie is a major dissapointment
, with only a faw scenes worth a firt look
, let alone a second
. perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie
,
and not surprisingly
; the only reason the movie made tjhe top ten grossing list opening week ws because it was advertised with farley
.
and farley ' s classic humor isnt widespread
, too
. almost heroes almost works
,
but misses tjhe wagon
- train by quite a longshot
. guys
, let ' s leave the exploring to lewis
and clark
, huh
? stick to
" tommy boy
"
,
and we ' ll all be
" friends
"
