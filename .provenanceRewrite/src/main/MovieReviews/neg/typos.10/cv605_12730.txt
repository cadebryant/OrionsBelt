! hunter s
. thompson ' s fear
and loathing in las vegas
, written in 1971
, is already an american classic
; not merely because it was an unadulterated journy through the post
- psychedelia of the 1960 ' s
,
but also because it ushered inspite a new form of journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon aftter the book was written
, hunter s
. thomspon bacame the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke
.
and that isnt the problem with fear
and loathing in las vegas
( the movie
.
)
although the book is one ofthe my favorites
, i now agree with thompson ' s own assessment of tje novel as
" unfilmable
.
" the main problem isnt that the book
,
although detailing wild drug use
and tripped
- out adventures
, was not written on the road
. it was written
and edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, relatively sober
, at his home
. so
although the book depicts drug use
and still more drug use
, it is told with a sence of aloofness
annd some humor
. hunter s
. thomspon
, the narrator
, while always drugged out
, still has a grip on reality
,
adn can still tell
, with journalistic ability
, what is going on arund him
. not so with the characters in fear
and loathing in las vegas
. despite name changes
and one minor scene from the book dropped
, thge movie is an exact duplicate of the book
, in terms of dialouge
. unfortunately
, this can get annoying
, inwhich the form ofthe johnny depp ' s
( who plays thompson
) excessive narration
.
and the characters
, while having vivid personalities
, are played as 2
- d characers on the screen
: dr
. raoul duke
( johnny depp
, the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson ' s
)
and his riding companion
, dr
. gonzo
( benicio del toro
)
, who is a large samoan lawyer
, have no personalities or emotions at all
, save for stoned
. the film is very faithful to hte plot
( what there is
) ofthe the book
, in that dr
. raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover tghe mint 400
,
and takes along not only his samoan lawyer
but also car trunk full of drugs
. from there
, one set of stoned adventures after another happens
, including one of the few ogod scenes in which depp
, high on acid
, watches all the people in the bar arund him turn into
, litterally
, lounge lizards
. while the movie has its moments
( few
)
, it is almost unwatchable at parts
, especially towards the end
. dispite a lot ofthe celebrity cameos
, the stars never git off tghe ground
. the setted decoration
and costumes are great
,
and probably deserve an oscar nomination
.
however
, as we all know
, it ' s not sets or effects that make a movie
, its the characters
;
and quite frankly
, these characters are no good
.
