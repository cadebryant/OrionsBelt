look
! the new version of
" psycho
" came out
and the world didn ' t end
! i guess gus van sant really isn ' t the bringer of tyhe apocalypse
! unfortunately
,
though
, that
" psycho
" didn ' t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said fo it
. van sant ' s controversial
" re
- telling
" of alfred hitchcock ' s classic 1960 film hasnt polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even before it premiered
.
) without benifit of an actuall viewing
, many have said tath the film will
, at best
, suck
. being an
( almost
) good critic
, i waited until i actually saw it to decide that yhe film
, at best
, sucked
(
and that concludes the use of the word
" suck
"
and
, hopefully
, the thoughts that i am a brain
- dead orangutan
.
) director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film
and refilmed it
, shot
- for
- shot
, using the same
, exact script
( with a few minor alterations
.
) the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful
and scary
, even
though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will appen at the exact time
. suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than thge original
. sadly
, that did not occur
. it isnt hard to be overshadowed by vera miles
and john gavin
( from the original
" psycho
)
,
but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore
and viggo mortensen
. in moore ' s case
, the film would have been helped if
" the x
- files
" gillian anderson had been cast instade
; especially since moore goes through the entire film donig a scully impression
! from the cold demeanor
and expressions tothe her rigid way of forming a sentence
, moore is scully
! mortensen
( who i liekd in
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point
. sam has a twang
and a cowboy hat
,
but that ' s about it
. mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory
. anne heche
, in the janet leigh role
, does a few good things inthe her brief time on screen
. at least her marion crane has a little life in her
, which can ' t be said for most of the rest of the cast
. the best work
,
though
, comes from vince vaughn
, as the demented mama ' s boy
, norman bates
. he ' s nto going to make anyone forget anthony perkins
,
bu he is effective both inwhich being naughty
and nice
. the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche
and vaughn
, where they simply talk
. there is some solid acting there
, something that is nto carried through the rest of the film
. van sant has made a boring film
. all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently utilisied inthe 1960 aren ' t as eye
- catching nowe
. what passed for brilliance
then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don ' t impress or excite
. van sant
, in waht i assume is a grasp at originality
, decided to put some stream
- of
- consciousness images into a few famous scenes
( was that a lamb in the middle of the road
?
) these images
, included iwth some questionable editing choices
, took away from the scenes themselfs
and caused
, at first
, bewilderment
annd
, later
, laughter
. definitely not hitchcock ' s intention
! at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann ' s original famous
and terrific score
. if a film like
" psycho
" does not frighten
,
then what ' s the point
. aside from norman
, the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience
. there are things van sant
and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting
. in tghe end
,
however
, teh new
" psycho
" is a noble attempt
,
bu
, alas
, a dismal failure
.
