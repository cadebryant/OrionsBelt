okay
, okay
. mabye i wasn ' t in the mood to watch a mindless action movie
; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii
, even while admitting that it wasn ' t as good as the others
. howewer
, the latest segal picture didn ' t look that bad
,
and since none of my friends owudl go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them
, i went tothe see it expecting a mild die hard rehash
. boy
, was i wrong
! in the first half of the movie
, we are already assaulted with segal ' s acting
,
( he is not simply wooden
; he is like a wall
)
, gratuitous violence
, an incredible plot
, sexist
and even more gratuitous nudity
,
and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes
. by the end
, it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed spacial forces soldiers
. nto once in hte movei did segal apeared worried or undecided
, which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense
. of course
, in movies liek these
, there must be a sidekick
,
and a love interest
. in theese one we are given a two for noe package in the form of a playboy model
( inthe the movie
)
, whic only functions as a supposed comic relief
( by the way of extrememly stupid unfunny lines
)
,
annd tothe have watering eyes
and look away every time something bad happens in thge movie
. oh
, of course
, she appears naked from the waist up
,
and
, of course
, segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship
; they did not even seem to be interested in eahc other
. i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie
. often
, the villin saves the movie
; unfortunately
, the villains here are cartoonish
, stupid
and unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies have psycho ex
- special forces bad guys
? too many
. i was able to predict the action all throughout the movei
, including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death
, the scene where the bad guy can kill tjhe hero
but proceeds tothe explain his plan to him
, the scene where we are shown the hero ' s superiors are stupid
, the scene where the bad guy loses his gun
anbd has tothe fight teh hero hand to hand
, etc
.
.
. simply said
, this is movie
- making by the numbers
, boring
,
and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of thge audience
. my recommendation
: if you go see it
, bring a watch
. you ' ll be looking at it for most of the movie
. my
. rent die hard
. read a book
. stare at the sky
. do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid
. the real sad thing is that there are a lot ofthe movies out taht i would rather have seen
; once agina
, dragged in by my friends
, which by the way
, liked the movie halfheartedly
. they probably liuke wrestling too
