starship troopers is a bad movie
. i mean
, a relaly
, really
, bad movie
. not only does it cross the line of bad tast when it comes to blood
, gore
and body parts shown on the screen
, it blissfully jumps over that line
, apparently unaware that yhe movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds
( of which i saw many inthe the theatre
)
. looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence
, we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best
, no strong lead characters
, a blatant disregard fo physics
,
and a vrey obvious naziesque theme
. that being said
, onto the review
: the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation
( who ' s logo bears a
* strong
* resemblance to a nazi german eagle
)
, urging the populace to go off
adn fight the bugs
, who are attempting to destroy earth
. the film shows large rallies with young children infact attendance
, pledging allegiance to the federation
( again
, sound familiar
?
)
. as the movie progresses
, we are shown terror tactic training
, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm
,
and throws a knife thru anyother ' s hand
. eventually
, teh recruits embark on a journy to a location two thirds ofthe the way across the milky way galaxy
, to fight the bugs on their home planet
. as our faster than light travelling
" heroes
" arrive on planet
, they drop onto yhe planet
,
and burst our of their craft brandishing
.
.
.
" what
?
" you say
,
" laser beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns
, pump acation rifles
,
and tactical nuculear weapons
! i guess a lot of physisc money r
& d went into travel
and not weaponry
. as yhe assault begins
, our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon
. twpo members of hte group notice rocks slipping
and falling above them
,
and one even sees a streak fly by
,
but disregards it as nothing
. this ofthe course
, leads to more massive carnage
, blood shed
,
and graphic depictions ofthe limbs
and heads being ripped
and severed from their bodies
. again
, i see thast military tactics in thte future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons
! in the end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
,
adn gloves
. he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug
,
and
thn proclaims that the bugs are scared
! tihs sets the troopers into a frenzy
, as tehy are now one step closer to completing their goal
, total genocide of a species
( again
, sound familiar
?
?
)
. i have tried very hard not to step on
and spoil the plot with this review
,
but given it ' s non
- existence
, i may have anyway
. i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart
,
but don ' t whant to bore you too badly
. in short
, i felt as if i were subjected tothe a mix between a pro
- nazi war film wih bugs substituted for allies
, a drivers education accident scene film
,
and a complete blank screen
( the plot
, of course
)
. i wouldn ' t recommend this movie to anyone
, anywhere
, under any circumstance
