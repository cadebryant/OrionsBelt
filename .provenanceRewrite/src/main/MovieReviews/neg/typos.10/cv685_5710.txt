steve martin shines
but sgt
. bilko fails to impress based on tjhe popular 50 ' s sitcom
, sgt
. bilko follows the string of old
- sitcoms
- to
- movie conversion fever
. remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back
?
( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped
)
. i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy
,
but hte tv
- conversion
- movies are hitting our screens like wildfire
, sad to say
, with mixed success
. such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usally followings of such series over there
and the larger the following
, the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie
. sgt
. bilko
( frankly
, i have not seen any its original tv version
)
, even with the charm
and wild antics of funnymen steve martin
and dan akroyd
; failed to entertain
. sgt
. ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool
( place of vehicle storage
and repair
) of fort baxter
.
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of
, he has an almost superhuman ability
and zeal tothe sniff out mney
- making opportunities
; from running a gambling den inaddition the miltary garage tothe 4
- d pools
.
though materialistic inthe mind
, bilko ' s methods has thoughtfully
` enriched ' the lives ofthe tyhe men of fort baxter
, providing them with soem form ofthe real recreation within the camp
and the people love him for that
. colonel hall runs the entire fort
and thanks to his inborn
` blissfully
- confused ' state
, bilko has managed to hide his operation
,
though nearly every living person in tje fort knows about it
. bilko ' s state of ascent is suddenly under
- fire whn the pentagon sends major thorn
, a tough cookie on army regulations
, tothe check on the progress on hte
$ 70 million hovertank project
, a newyorker weapon under development within the fort ' s grounds
. to add to his problems
, thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major
` sabo ' done on him by bilko druing their younger army days
. director jonathan lynn
, who directed my cousin vinny
( inaddition which marisa tomei won an oscar for best
- supporting actress
) managed to pull sgt
. bilko through with suitable pacing
annd some exceptional moments of laughter
,
but that is about it
. there are really not enough laughter
- packed
- moments in sgt
. bilko tothe fully entertain the average movie
- goer
. still
, steve martin ' s sgt
. bilko is played with finesse
and full
- force by yhe renowned comedian
. without him
, sgt
. bilko would ahev jstu fell flat on its face
. sgt
. bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year
but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world
. the current trend in mixed successes in such tv
- conversions may be a blessing in disguise
, really
; at least it will force hollywood to re
- think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv
- idea inot a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with moreso creativity
. unless you are a fan of the tv
- series or love to watch steve martin in action
, you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres
. i ' m sure there are better ones around
.
