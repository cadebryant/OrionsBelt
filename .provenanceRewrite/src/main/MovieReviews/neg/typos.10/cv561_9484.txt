i looked at the
" internet movie database
" ' s awards section for htis film
,
and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for
" best picture
( drama
)
.
" anyone who ' s seen this film can back me up onthe this
: this is the worst of the
" great
" disaster films
,
and that ' s nto relaly saying a lot for this film
.
" earthquake
" is basically notable because it orignially included some theatre thing where the theatre shook whn the big earthquake occured
. on video
, it ' s a bland
and slow
- moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters
( the disaster film requisite
)
,
then brings them together infront tghe struggle against the big disaster
. while this worked in
, say
,
" the towering inferno
,
" it doesn ' t here for one single reason
: we don ' t care about any of the characters
. the film gives us charlton heston
( in one ofthe many crap 70s films he made
, including
" skyjacked
"
and that classic
,
" soylent green
"
) as a rich man married to ava gardner
, who is hvaing a little affair with a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade police officer on suspension
( george kennedy
, in his least humored performance
)
; in the second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right after his
" shaft
" thing
) whose big stunt is he goes onthe a little track that goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
;
and the weirdest subplot
: a military man
/ bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principial
,
anbd eventually gets vengeance on thsoe guys who made fun of his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. inthe smaller subplots
, there ' s a pointless bit about peopel who are flying over l
. a
.
( the city in the film
, by the way
)
, one who ' s playing cards
and married to a boring non
- acting husband
( you think this one can go nowhere
? guess again
. he gets interested in the fianl frames
)
; there ' s genieveve bujold ' s moron son
, who has a little adventure with wires
;
and fo some much
- needed comedy
, there ' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- teh only laugh in the film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who ' s big moment is a dance he doens at a critical time
. as for the actual
" earthquake
,
" it ' s rather a let
- down
. there ' s a full hour of charater
- setups
, none of whihc is interesting
,
then about 10 minutes of shaking
, crumbling
,
and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. this film needed that whole theatre
- shaking
: they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored
. there ' s littel suspense follwoing the quake
,
although this film tries for it
. there ' s an adventure in a crumbling high
- rise office building
, tje wires with the kid
,
anbd the movment of people who are all injured
.
but none of these are all
- too suspenseful
. tghe finale with the heston
/ gardner
/ bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip
- of
- the
- coin bit
, which brings out a big let
- down
.
and there ' s no real finale
. even
" volcano
" ended nicely
,
and that movie really sucked
. not only is it hokey
,
but yuo don ' t care about any character
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
(
although i woudl have chosen gardner
, mainly on the basis that she can actually act
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if tyhat idiot kid falls tothe his death on some wires
?
and who cares about that whole plane spiel
? if anything
,
" earthquake
" isnt worth a viewing for the smae reason
" glen or glenda
?
" isnt
. i mean
, i laughed at this more than i did at
" bio dome
.
"
but that ' s another story
(
and review
)
. in short
,
" earthquake
" gives disaster pics a bad name
.
