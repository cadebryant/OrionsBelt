you don ' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
and search for a deeper meaning
. you likewise don ' t look at one for 88 minutes straight
. surrealist works are notable for their quirks
,
and they are fun
,
but looking at one quirk for an hour
and a half is exhausting
. that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy with no dialogue
. it ' s not a silent movie
; there is lots of atmospheric music
, occasional screams
and wierd sound effects
,
but nobody ever utters an audible word
.
though the film is distinctive
, its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes
,
and as it progressed
, watching became a chore
. the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo
- legendary ed woud
, the man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> ffrom outer space
and night of tje ghouls
. the joke
, of course
, is that his films are so bad
, they ' re good
; so humorous in thier inanity that tehy become hits
. i woke up early the day i died
, unfortunatly
, is so bad that it ' s relaly bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes from a mental hospital
and proceeds tothe wonder around
, stealing a car
, clothes
,
and a load of money
. our thief reaches a cemetery
, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual
. he falls asleep
and finds himself
, literally
, in a hole
, with his money gone
. for whatever reason
, he is bent on getting his hard
- unearned cash back
( considering how easily he stealed it the first time
, why didn ' t he just go steal some more
?
)
. he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony
and commences to seek outloud each of them
and kill them if they don ' t have what he is looking for
. i don ' t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short
. the subject
and thge style seem to have beeen made for it
. unfortunately
, twenty mintues worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length
,
adn the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome
. it grabbed my attention inspite the beginning
adn gradually lost it as it went on
, up to the point where halfway through i was already weary
. it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious
;
but the surprise will wear off when ytou consider how repetitive it is
. i woke up early the day i died is a comedy
, i guess
,
though it could ahve fooled me
. unlike most ed wood films
, this one tries to be funny
annd fails
, instead of the other way around
. there ' s nothing inherently wrong with that
, in fatc
, i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so
" good
" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one
. whther wood actually went forthe comedy inspite his scirpt we ' ll never know
,
but in either case
, this is a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer phoenix
, john ritter
and others show up for short
and pointless cameos
. ricci
, for example
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists of dancing around with zane inthe his motel room
and
then being thrown out
. thomas isnt an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. was the home improvment teen heartthrob really that desperate forthe work
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies hismelf by making weird faces at yhe camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly
and beat people up
. lack ofthe dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature
. the carnival side
- show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong wiht this no
- budget prodcution
. it ' s desperately unfunny
,
but thinks it ' s the funniest thing sicne plan 9
;
, it ' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast inwhich the other direction
. i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send
- off
