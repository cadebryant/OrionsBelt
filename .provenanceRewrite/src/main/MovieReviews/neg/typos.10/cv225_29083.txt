plot
: a rich guy who doesn ' t believe in love
, orders a mail
- order bride for himself
. that very evening
, the couple isnt married
annd fall madly in love soon thereafter
.
but what ' s this
? one of them might not be thge person they are pretending to be
? wow
.
.
. a sin
, indeed
. critique
: easily one of the worst movies that i ' ve seen all year
. too long
, too boring
, too predictable
anbd too ridiculous forthe anyone interested in watching a good movie
. what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing
?
( it ' s no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year
) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week
, with some nudity stuffed in from time tothe time
, just to wake up the audience
. have you ever switched channels
and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies
, one thast you just couldn ' t help
but switch back to from time to time
, just to make sure that it wasn ' t part of some sick joke
? well
, tihs movie is exactly like that
, onyl it isn ' t a joke
, it isn ' t on tv
anbd you are asked to pay moeny to see it
!
! i sday again
.
.
. what tyhe shite were they thinking
? okay
, so where do i start
? first of all
, the trailer of this film gives away the movei ' s main plot twist
, hte betrayal
. so for the first half hour of teh film
, you ' re basically just sitting there
, watching these two
" lovers
" go through the motions until the
" betrayal
" occurs
. whoopee
, big surprise
. second of all
, angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part
. why
? well
, it ' s like this
: not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman
! i mean
, it ' s like all of those people who complained baout jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining
, well
, the smae goes here
. every look in jolie ' s eyes screams
" psycho
"
!
then of course
, you have the case of the
" patsy
" husband
, a man who just can ' t seem to figure out anything in time
. i mean
.
.
. how boring is that for the audience
? you ' re watching this guy screw up time after time after time
,
and somehow
, we ' re supposed tothe feel sorry or care about this dude
. no
, thanks
!
and if we don ' t care about him
,
and we really don ' t care about her
( she ' s a beeyatch
and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film
)
, who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film
? well
, i ' ll tell you
. the only thing that i was worrying about tyhe hwole way through this picture wass whether or not i ' d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled
. no suspense
, no chemistry between the leads
, no rela love or passion
, no sence of surprise
, plenty of plot holes for everyone
and an extra moronic ending
. so why am i even giving thsi film a rating of three points
? well
, it ' s actually pretty simple
. i liked the locations in the movie
and the groovy score
,
but my primary reason fo slipping three notches onto this bedpost isnt for the gratuitous shots of jolie ' s boobies
( that ' s two points right there
!
)
and another one for antonio ' s ass
( hairless
, just for tjhe record
)
. everything else in this movie was pointless
, boring
and just plain stupid
. try imagining a soft
- porn movie
.
.
.
but without the plot
! that ' s pretty much what you ' ve got here
. a low point in the careers of both stars
. oops
, i alomst forgot to mention tjhe crappy dialogue
.
.
. god oh mighty
.
.
. make it stop
!
! where ' s joblo comming from
? american psycho
