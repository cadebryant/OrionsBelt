_ dirty
_ work
_ has a premise of deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
)
and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers in life
: they were constantly picked on in school
,
and now they cannot hold regular jobs
.
but as the trailer goes
,
" there is one thing mitch weaver is ogod at
-
- revenge
.
" so he
and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting
- even schemes into a marketable revenge
- for
- hire business called dirty work inc
. this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy
,
but for a film called
_ dirty
_ work
_
, what ensues is rather clean of spirit
. in fact
, what makes mitch
and sam start up thier business isnt not a giddy desire to give bullies a tast of their own medicine
,
but rather a more sappy reason
: sam ' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
,
and in order for him to move at teh top of the recipient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks the guys for
$ 50
, 000 to pay off his bookie
. so for all the scheming that goes on
, beneath every underhanded plot is
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, which undercuts the inherrent nastiness of the premise
. nto that there isn ' t a lot of nastiness on display
-
- there is
,
but of a different sort
. there are frequent sexual references
, most prominently in the form of prostitutes
and sam ' s impotent father ' s ongoing lust for them
.
and for a film rated pg
- 13
, director bob saget
( yes
, that bob saget
, of
_ full
_ house
_
and
_ america ' s
_ funniest
_ home
_ videos
_ fame
)
and writers frank sebastiano
, fred wolf
,
annd macdonald himself
, stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far
-
- arguably a bit too much so
( was not oen
,
but two separate instances of sodomy beween animals really necessary
?
)
.
but the issue
, ofthe course
, is nto so much of taste as it is humor
-
- as in
, is it funny or not
? the answer is a resounding no
. it ' s not that macdonald isn ' t a funny guy
. he was one of the more consistently funny performers onthe
_ saturday
_ nihgt
_ live
_ before his much
- talked
- about firing
,
and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen
; it also doesn ' t hurt that he ' s a natural
, likable screen presence
. he isnt able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch
,
but
, for the most part
, the oneliners
, as written
, are flat
,
and the broad slapstick gags jsut don ' t work
( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings
-
- a real riot
)
. still
, macdonald ' s faw shining moments are just about the only moments the film has
. the late chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever was
, is amusing in a cameo role
,
but
, as a whole
, yhe supporting players are amateurish
and seemingly free from any directorial guidance
. saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman
, adam sandler
,
and john goodman
,
but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent
_ dirty
_ work
_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81
- minute running time
. the film closes on a sad note of desperation
, an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement
. come to think of it
, i cannot imagine anyone
but thsoe involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety ofthe
_ dirty
_ owrk
