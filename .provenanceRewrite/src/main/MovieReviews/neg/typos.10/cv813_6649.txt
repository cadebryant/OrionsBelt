i am a steven seagal fan
. i only say this now because
" mufti splenetik
" isn ' t my real name
and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something ytou can depend on
. seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue
, heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones
( which we ' ll always hear when seagal doesnt his limb
- twisting thing
)
, rarely a female co
- lead in sight
( unless it ' s a real
- life modle
- wife who hasn ' t worked since eird science
)
anbd
, usually the worst possible titles you cin imagine
. not to mention very straightforward plots
, generally all
- round bad dialogue
and mr implacable leather
- face himself in that same black outfit he ' s been in since nico doing his
" my hands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thing
, seagal the stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke of dull
. in hte glimmer man
, seagal breaks out of this forumla
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attempts to banter
,
anbd puts on a new vest
. he ' s also put on quite a lot of weight
. small potatoes
, you may say
, a man shouldnt be able to accessorize
and banter if he wants to
,
but damnit
, if it ain ' t broke
, why fix it
?
( more on this disappointed person ' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past
. while he
and his partner
( played by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a series of ritual killings
, cole himself becomes a suspect
, especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing onthe cole
. it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin
( you just can ' t trust these homicide detectives
)
, someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them
,
and hence
, well
, yuo know
, that
" glimmer man
" thing
. an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger
, more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole ' s former cia boss
( brian cox
)
and deals involving chemical weapons
. the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff
, drawing
( as with his other films
) elements from the hotter films of the year
( eg
, se7en
)
. it ' s the other changes that disappoint
. for example
, altho there ' s a fair amount of violence in htis movei
, there ' s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans
, probably the best known of the wayans tribe
( how many are there
, exactly
?
) from televsion ' s
" infront living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal ' s bead
- adorned
and brocade
- draped cole
, keeping up his
" are you crazy
" part of the dialogue with wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner ' s eccentric habits
,
bu the chemistry between the two is minimal
,
and seagal ' s wooden comebacks make for painful watching
. a cook in under seige 2
, seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese
and wears prayer beads
and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble
. he chants
, refuses tothe fight unless truly provoked
and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis tothe cure his allergies
. again
, a benign
( if trite
) plot device except for the fatc tyhat these new character traits recquire seagal to speak more than usual
. heck
, he has to deliver punchlines
and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film
. is that a lot to ask of the seague
? too much
. seagal ' s best charactersistic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies
: to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
,
and to do it silently
,
and alone
. not for seagal
, the snappy one
- liners of arnold
adn stallone
, nor the attempts to show that he can act
, much less think
. no kindergarten cop
, no oscar
, just simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. that ' s really how it must have started
: like
- minded fans who knew whta they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing
, knowing taht never in the seagal universe owudl they ever hvea to see him do anything else
. we trusted him
. we got to know him
. now
, betrayal
. i don ' t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that littel niggling dout that he ' s going to try to be funny again
. i ' ll try
,
but it won ' t be easy
. if yuo haven ' t watched the glimmer man
yet
, you might want to wait for the video to come outloud
. it ' s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts
and linger on the action sequences
. after all
, if we can ' t depend on our fantasies
, what cant we depend on
? the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan
. everybody makes mistakes once in awhile
.
