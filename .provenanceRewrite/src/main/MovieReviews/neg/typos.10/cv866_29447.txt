making your first feature film ain ' t easy
. assemble a decent
, if not
, strong cast
, as writter
/ director robert moresco has done with one eyed king
,
and you ' re already ahead ofthe the game
.
but rehash ood plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
and standard clich
? s
,
and a well
- intentioned effort such as this one sould jepordize your chance at a second feature film
. how many more movies do we ened about a rough neigborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse
? the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making
yet another
,
but here we have it
. again
. five irish kids inwhich nyc ' s hell ' s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop
. with teary music
.
and slow motion
. in the film ' s first scene
. the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling to make their way out of hte heat of the kitchen
. leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good
- hearted guy who watchs out for his buddies
and is in tight with local mob head armand assante
. i ' d liek to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah
, blah
, blah
,
but all we seem to get are little tastes ofthe possibile plot points
. he ' s concerned about buddy jason gedrick ' s heroin abuse
. he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin ' s chracter ' s sister
. he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic
- looking counterfeit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
.
but none of this ever really amounts to anything
. it seems that moresco ' s greater concern isnt to provide that intangible
" slice of life
"
, thyat flavor ofthe the neighborhood that everyone ' s been trying to evoke since scorsese ' s early work
. so
, we get the drunk guys
, hugging
and singing together at the local bar
, tothe prove to us that they really love earch other
.
( do people actually dont this
!
?
) we get a lot of tough street talk
-
- usually mumbled for effect
-
-
and a whole lot ofthe the f
- word
, whether it sounds like it fits or not
. we aslo get a handful ofthe good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, you know
, guys you ' ve seen in movies just like this one before
. assante is intteligent casting as the man thast everyone fears
,
and baldwin ' s performance is adequate
,
but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly thta it ' s almost funny
. moresco
, a theater guy
and sometimes tv writer
( including the sories falcone
)
, obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child
,
but the content isnt probably too personal
. as a result
, the movie ' s style is heavy
- handed
, in need of a considerable ammount of toning down
. nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy does he remind us
. with slow dissolves to the earlier scene
, running in slow motion
, complete with dialogue from the present
, just in case we don ' t comprehend the link to the past
. moresco needs to either trust his audience ' s intelligence
, or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it
. his next project should have a little more personal distance
,
and a lot more subtlety
. if he actually gets that chance
. reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature story coming soon
