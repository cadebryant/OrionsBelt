summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment
and to make money
. wild wild west
, the latest will smith affair
, follows much the same formula
, except that it is dumber
and less enjoying than most summer movies
. will smith plays jim west
, a black sheriff with a nice line infront sunglasses
. he isnt called by president grant
( kline
) tothe go onthe a mission tothe find out why top government scientists are disappearing
. west is paired uv with scientist artemus gordon
( kline again
)
and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, with a zany moustache
.
) before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair
, i ' ll give it a chance with the positives
. there ' s a nice credit sequence
, the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye
,
and the special effects are decent enough
. there ' s also a pleasant soundtrack
. buried deepo in the dross are one or two amusing jokes
.
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest
, which is always nice to see
. apart from theese factors
,
though
, nothing else in wild wild west works
. firstly
, there ' s little chemistry betweeen smith
and kline
, who appears tothe be iin it purely for the money
. one would expect zingers passing between the two
: none arise
. both of them plod through the below standard plot
, knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end
. not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment
:
although he is over the top
, the material doesn ' t present much opportunity fo branagh to be truly crazy
. therefore
, he just comes across as loud as obnoxious
. the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek
, who is given so little screen time it ' s embarrassing
. she appears to be inspite tghe film tothe merely show off her body
,
and be ogled at by kline
and smith
. her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script
,
and there is no sense of realism about the character
. the ' humour ' inspite hte film is also very off
. will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black
, here
, not even smith could save the humour on display
. the script largely boils down to insults that aren ' t very funny
,
and one
- liners that barely raise a smirk
. it ' s also somewhat racist
,
although it doesn ' t intend to be
, with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching
,
and actually says slavery is good to save himselv
. it ' s not a funny scene
,
and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably
. thte film also makes the tragic misteek that a man
( in this case kline
) in a dress is automatically unfunny
, it isn ' t
,
but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness
. there ' s also problems with the plot
. jim west
and artemus gordon get caught uv in all kinds of sticky situations
,
but tghe way htey git outloud of them are always unsatisfying
,
and rely purely on luck
, rather than audience pleasing skill
. plot elements are introduced into the film
,
and
thn thrown away just as quickly
. the main piece of the story
, a 80 foot mechanical
, steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive
,
but there ' s no particular reason why it should be built
. why not loveless build a great big tank
, instead of an ungainly
, fragile piece of machinery that ' s just beggin to be blown up
? director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look tothe them
, wih some nice camera tricks
,
but even this is missing from this stilted affair
. wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing
,
but not much of it is evident
, making this film drag out even more
. it ' s a sad thing when
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented director
and a willing star cxan ' t make a film work
,
and eventually wild wild west collapses under it ' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
