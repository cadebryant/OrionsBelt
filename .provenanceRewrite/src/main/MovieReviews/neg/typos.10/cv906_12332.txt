writing a screenplay for a thriller isnt hard
. harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun
. harder than building a bridge over troubled waters
.
and incidentally
, a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review
. thrillers are all variations on a theme
. you have a smart
, resourceful
,
and powerful bad guy
, who has a goal he has to meet
. you have a noble
and brave good guy
, who has to protect the innocent
, kill the bad guy
,
and not get killed hismelf in the process
. the trick ofthe thriller writing is doign all of thsi in an interesting
and novel manner
. this simple forumla can lead to classic movies like noth by northwest
, high noon
, or silence of the lambs
, or big summer blockbusters liuke men in black
, the fugitive
, or air force one
, or it can lead to utter dreck liek masterminds
, event horizon
, kull the conqueror
.
.
.
. is anyone else getting depressed here
? point is
, it ' s not enough to follow the formula
. you ' ve got to throw in something extra
, something good
and new
and better than the last version
. something to surprise
and move all of us people who buy the tickets
and tghe popcorn
and the happy meals
. this is a hard thing to do
,
but it is absolutely necessary in every way
. without that something extra
-
- whether it ' s a great plot or a well
- written screenplay
, or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs
-
- yhe movie fails
. that ' s why the jackal
, with all its starpower
, with all its budget
, with all its hype
, gets a big fat f
. bruce willis is the bad guy
, the jackal
, a legendary killer for hire
. richard gere is the good guy
, a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal
. the jackal isnt trying to kill someone
. gere is trying to stpo him
. will gere be able to stop the assassination in time
and kill hte jackal
?
( i ' ll give you three guesses
,
and tjhe first two don ' t count
.
) there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal
, no moment when you say to yourself
,
" i wonder what happens next
?
" the script for the jackal isn ' t ripped straight from today ' s headlines
. it ' s ripped off
, straight from an episode of millennium
. througout the movie
, we learn waht the jackal ' s plans are
adn how he intends to accomplish them
. noone surprise
. the fun ofthe a movie like this should come ffrom richard gere figuring out what the jackal ' s plan is
and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy
. instead
, we get two
( count ' em
, two
) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere
and instantly divines the jackal ' s plan just as if he ' s frank black
( or more likely
, just as if he ' s beeen handed a copy of the script
)
.
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had tihs flash of insight
. it ' s like gere ' s character is psychic
,
bu niether he nor the fbi
( or the screenwriters
) seem to know it
.
adn just like in millennium
, the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go aftter the people the good guy cares about
, whether or not they are important to what he ' s trying to do or not
. what ' s more
, in the last half of the movie
, the jackal
, supposedly a super
- smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake
, comes down with a major case ofthe the stupids
. as for the performances
.
.
. bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack
, which is a major achievement
,
but not anough reason to see the movie
. his disguises are good
,
but not as good or as intresting as val kilmer ' s in the saint
. richard gere is made to talk tje entire movie in an irish accent
, which detracts from his otherwise lifeless
and dull performance
. sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie
-
- not thgat his performance is bad or anytying
, it ' s not
,
but it is sad that hollywood won ' t use thsi talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent
( shoot to kill
, sneakers
)
. writing a good plot
and a good screenplay
, liuke i said
, is hard
,
but it can be done
. it wasn ' t done here
. it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays
and to denounce bad
and uninteresting ones
. do not go see this movie
. you ' ll only encourage the producers to make more jsut like it
. instead
, stay home
and rent day of the jackal
, or in the line of fire
, or a fire safety video
, for crying out loud
. anything otehr than the jackal
, which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other
, better movies
.
