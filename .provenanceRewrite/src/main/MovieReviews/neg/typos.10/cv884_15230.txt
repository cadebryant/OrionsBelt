for thsoe interested in the true spirit ofthe moviemaking
- or what ' s left ofthe it in mainstream hollywood
- movie which are star vehicles are terrible things
. as a rule
, the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media
bu rather to advance the career of a particular actor
. an ctor might be chosen on the up
-
and
- up
, to give him exposure
; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck
. generally
,
though
, the actor doesn ' t matter
,
and soldier
, the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers
, exemplifies this
: tjhe picture lacks pizazz
. the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell
, otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less
. russell plays todd
, a human trained ffrom birth in the ways of waging war
and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought
. the movie lets us see this degenerate process
,
but by the time the rela plot starts
, we ' re into todd ' s later eyasr
. he ' s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers
, ones who
, instead of being trained
* from
* birth
, are genetically selected
* befoer
* birth
. the pride of this class
- caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
- will be our villain
,
and you knwo he ' s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie ' s start
. between the two leads
, less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken
,
and it ' s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction
. director paul anderson
, who helmed last year ' s icy thriller
, event horizon
, doesn ' t sohw any inventiveness here
and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam
. todd
, apon being replaced
, is left to die on a garbage planet
;
but in order to stretch the running time out
, the villains return to the garbage planet on a
" routine patrol
"
and set the stage for the final firefight
. events are predictable from the time that the setups are made
,
and niether anderson nor scriptwriter david poeoples attemts to show any creativeness here
. the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be
: todd fails to show physical superiority against caine
- in fact
, not even todd
and two of his companions can best the baddie
-
but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess wtih automatic weaponry
. it ' s not as
though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story
,
and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it
. the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit
,
and treat it as a parody of typical action fare
, like universal solider
. a strict interpretation
,
however
, reveals an unmistakeable
and unforgiveable lack of style
, class
, or substance
;
and by next year
, a larg precentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network televsion
.
