susan granger ' s review of
" mulholland drive
"
( universal focus
) whatever david lynch is selling
, i ' m not buying
. from the writer
/ director of
" blue velvet
"
and
" twin peaks
" comes another dark
, misterious thriller thgat opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive
, the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills
. dazed
, a beautiful brunette
( laura elena harring
) emerges
and stumbles down a hill
, slipping unobserved into a ' 30s
- sytle apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip
. the next morning
, a dewy blonde
( naomi watts
) ffrom deep river
, ontario
, arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase
. her aunt owns the apartment
and the two women meet
. the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity allong with her latent lesbian lust
. meanwhile
, a hotshot director
( justin theroux
)
, whose wief is in bed iwth the poolman
, is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film
and there ' s an assasins
( mark pellegrino
) roaming the city
. the tortuous paths of these various characters
-
and others named cookie
, coco
and cowboy
- intersect at varous points
but the plot remains elusive because
, midway through tghe story
, lynch has the brunette
and blonde play two diffrent womens in an alternate reality
, leaving a huge wad of cash
, a blue metallic key
, a paralyzed mogul
and a lot of questions that go unanswered
. elena harring
and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses
, effectively making the subtle switch
. the same cannot be said for former m
. g
. m
. dancer ann miller who ' s stiff
and self
- conscious
, speaking
- liuke most lynch players
- in staccato tones
. on the granger movie gague of 1 to 10
,
" mulholland drive
" is a frenzied
, frustrating 4
. originally designed as an episodic tv pilot
, this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out
.
