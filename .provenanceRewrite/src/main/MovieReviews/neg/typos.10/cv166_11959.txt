there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in spoace
- it ' s just that none of them happen to be actors
. the stars i ' m referring to are the computer generated ones that amke up the movie ' s
" outer space
"
; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home
. yes
, in terms of acting
, the star power is
.
.
. well
, more like a falling star
. kinda pretty
, short
- lived
,
and pretty much dead
. lost in space
, as if you really didn ' t know
, is based on the 60 ' s sci
- fi television series of the same name
. it ' s the year 2058
,
and earth ' s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population
. john robinson
( william hurt
) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet
. earth ' s entire existance is contigent apon a successful mission
,
bu nobody
, whther it be john ' s family or hired battle pilot don west
( matt leblanc
)
, seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years
. john ' s family consists of his wife maureen
( mimi rogers
)
, his atypical teenage daughter penny
( lacey chabert
)
, his ingenious son will
( jack johnson
)
,
and his beautiful scientist daughter judy
( heather graham
)
. despite everyone ' s reluctance
, the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth
adn makes its way into the vast eternity of space
. unkown tothe anyone
bu the audience
, there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission
. dr
. smith
( gary oldman
) hasnt been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour
,
and dr
. smith has re
- programmed a talking robot to
" destroy robinson family
"
! when everything thta could go wrong does go wrong for both sides
, the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination
,
and now the premise of bieng lost inspite space is complete
. as for the audience
, you will likely be lost in boredom by tihs point
, wondering if the plot
, like the jupiter 2
, wiull ever get off the ground
. it ' s hard to tell who deserves the most blame
- the incredibly bland
and corny characters or the horrifically lame script
? chabert is basically the only one tothe overdo it
, sounding liek a whiny munchkin on helium
. if you
, like me
, were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be tooked over by aliens
, you ' re wrong
! that ' s just her normal voice
! in
yet another example of a
" friend
" faltering on the big screen
, leblanc is so incredibly dull
adn
yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming
( make sense
?
)
, it makes ytou want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod
. graham is a babe
- thank goodness there ws something for me to think baout durring this film
. hurt
, the black hole of excitement
, sucks up any energy that might have been left
. if hurt were available in tablet form
, he woudl be a prescription strenght sleeping pill
. johnson isn ' t dull
, he ' s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody ' s ass all the time
. want an example of how cool this kid can be
? how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart
and reconsider killing the family
? hey
, don ' t laff
- the thing actually listened to tje mr
. rogers
- would
- be
- proud sentiment
.
but alas
, if you thought a character couldn ' t be much worse
, there was rogers as thte epitomy of generic
( or
, mother as she was known
)
. why hire an actress
? they could ' ve had a white cardboard cutout with thte word mom printed on it
. now that would ' ve hadnt some pizzazz
! lost in space luckily doesn ' t suffer in every single category tht it sould have
. the special effects are crisp
, clear
,
and at least mildly captivating
, unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman
, who plays his evil character with a great deel of fun
and finesse
. unfortunately
, oldman is locked away forthe most of the film
, giving us nothing
bu ample mocking opportunities to enjoy
. while the special effects are pleasing to the eye
, they are nothing yuo couldn ' t find in most modern sci
- fi films
. contact
, for example
, far exceeds thsi film in terms ofthe imagery
and imagination
. lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art
, wtih numerous contradictions
( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed
!
)
, wooden
adn corny acting
, worse dialogue
,
annd an ending so disappointing
, you ' d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens
.
then again
, with an ending like this film has
, it ' s obvious a sequel is already being considered
. what an awful note to end on
, knowing there could be more ofthe this infront a year or two
. the attempt to be family oriented is commendable
,
but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects
and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups
. well
, danger potential movie goers
! danger
! this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity
.
