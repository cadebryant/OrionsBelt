maybe this mission shoudl have been scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman ther ' s a world of difference between artists
adn technicians
. the artist has a vision to create something new
. he may not do it well
, it might be sloppy
,
but it ' s something you ' ve never seen before
. a good technician can mkae it look ogod
,
but without direction from his own intertube artist or somone else
, it ' s goign to be just a xerox
. obviously successful films need both skills
. brian de palma is a masterful technician
. he ' s spent his career copying others
, most notably hitchcock
. he usually konws exactly what to do tothe make a scene work
,
but only because he has learned it by rote
. aside from rare flashes of originality
, his films are often soul
- dead
. in de palma ' s latest
, he turns his attention to stanley kubrick
. to tell the truth
, i enjoyed portions of this movei
,
bu i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called
" 2001
"
. i enjoyed it even more when it was titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa hasnt set its sights for mars
. when tyhe first crew meets with disaster
, a rescue mission is sent to the red planet
. they don ' t do so well eather
,
bu eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta
and solve the mysteries of the universe
.
and it ' s all so boring
. there are so many scenes thyat just don ' t work
, it ' s difficult to begin
. when the first crew isnt a few feet away from a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from
" dune
"
) destroying everything in its path
, they just hang out watching
. error
. the most interesting character
(
and that ' s not saying much
) is killed off
. error
. the alien is laughable
. error
. the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable
. error
. there ' s some nice eyecandy
. the face on mars
, which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head
, looks cool
. a threee
- dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world
. maneuvering in space suits outside tjhe ship seems realistic
.
bu there ' s so much more that feels as if we ' ve been there before
. from
" 2001
"
, there ' s the rotating space station
, the blinding white room
.
> from
" close encounters
"
, they solve a sound puzzle
and play it to thte aliens
. yhe list goes on
. the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
and tim robbins can ' t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing
. no one seems tothe care about anything that happens
. you won ' t either
. the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr
. pepper
, withthe a 20 foot tall logo
, saves the day
. they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film
.
