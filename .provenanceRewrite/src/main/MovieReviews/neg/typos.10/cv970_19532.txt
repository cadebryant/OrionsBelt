the
" disney stick
- to
- what
- you
- do
- best
" rule states that disney ' s animated features will invariably be sublime
but whenever they try their hand at live
- action kids ' entertainment
, they will fail miserably
. this goes double fo occasions when they try tothe make a live
- acation adaptation of a popular cartoon
( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations
? i ' m still trying to forget
)
. that rule proves more dependable thna ever with inspector gadget
, an insulting
, despicable
and
, worst of all
, expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children ' s film
. it will bore anyone over five
and should prove unbearable for adults
, even at its relatively skinny running time ofthe 80 minutes
. it ' s films like tihs that make me want to go to my local blockbuster
and rent something from thte days wehn brains were more important tahn budgets
annd wit compensated for lack of fancy effects
. just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an ator
yet
, his career takes a nosedive to hell with his
" role
" as john brown
, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that oney day he can become a real policemen
and help the people around him
. he dreams of heroic deeds
and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush
, dr
. brenda bradford
( joely fisher
)
.
but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer
. john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr
. brenda ' s father
. dr
. brenda has been working on a
" gadget project
,
" which would make a half
- man half
- machine super
- policeman to fight crime
. feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject
, realizing his dream ofthe becoming a policeman
. now
, when he says
" go go gadget
[ insert name of gizmo here
]
" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks
, bang up bandits
and mangle murderers
. inaddition tjhe meantime
, the evil claw
( rupert everett
)
, the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor ' s father is building a gadget of his own
: a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil
annd john brown ' s worst nemesis
. claw has plans of world domination
, which leaves it up to the inspector
adn his gadget mobile
( voice of d
. l
. hughley
) to save humanity from his wrath
. state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this
$ 90 million dollar movie
and
yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere
. had they replaced all the fancy gizmos whith dollar bills they would have wound up with hte same effect
. what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal
: all of the expensive f
/ x amounts to nothing
. part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie
. can kids really admire a hero so goody
- two
- shoes that he screams
" hey
! you ran a stop sign
!
" while hanging off the back bumper of a quicklyu moving vehicle
? i think that today ' s children will respond better tothe somebody dashing
, someone ultra
- cool
. they
( probably
) receive enough preaching from their parents
and its an insult to theri intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt
. in addition to the more complex complaints above
, there ' s also the simple stuf
: inspector gadget is boring
, formulaic
and achingly implausible
. ther ' s noone feeling that the director really cares about his story
: more than any otehr film i ' ve seen this year
, this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line
. there ' s a popular commercial
( for sprite
,
but thta ' s irrelevant
) running in movei theaters before features thgat spoofs the way major studios deel with projects
. it consists ofthe studio suits discussing a fictitious
( thank god
) movie called
" death slug
"
. each executive gleefully presents a diferent merchandise tie
- in
( slug taco
! slug on a stick
!
)
. at the end one of them asks
" what about the movie
?
" another answers
:
" well
, we don ' t have a script
yet
,
but we can bang one out by friday
.
" they probably could haev replaced
" death slug
" with inspector gadget
. thsi film contains the sort of logical contradictions
and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script
. it ' s no coincidence that most good children ' s entertainment these days comes from animation
. animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor ofthe love for the filmmakers
and they put care
and pride into theri work
. these kinds ofthe films are banged outloud quicker
and a good percentage turn out worthless
, sloppy
and impersonal
. the studios are becomeing factories
and films their assembled products
