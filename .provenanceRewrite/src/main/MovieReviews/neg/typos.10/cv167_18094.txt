so
, it ' s thirty years later
,
and oscar
and felix are together again
. that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn ' t for the fact tath the
" odd cuple
" of jack lemmon
and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies
: 1993 ' s
" grumpy old men
,
" 1995 ' s
" grumpier old men
,
"
and 1997 ' s
" out to sea
"
( i
. e
.
" grumpiest ood men
"
)
. so
,
" the odd couple ii
"
( i
. e
.
" the grumpiest old men of all
, really
"
) seems just anyother entry in a tired series
. thge plot is even similar to that of
" grumpy ood men
" in that lemmon
and matthau ' s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children
. oscar ' s son
( jonathan silverman
)
and felix ' s daughter
( lisa waltz
) are getting married
,
and former roommates felix ungar
( lemmon
)
and oscar madison
( matthau
) meet at the airport
and decide to share a car
.
.
.
hten hilarity ensues
. well
, a few chuckles ensue anyway
. neil simon
, tje award
- winning playwright who created oscar
adn felix
, provides the screenplay
, which is a shock
, beacuse the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end
. unlike the original play
/ movei
,
" odd couple ii
" doesn ' t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters
. instead
, it depends upon a series of humorous situations
: oscar
adn felix lose the car over a cliff
, are caught smuggling mexicans over the border
, take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands
( the women are played by christine baranski of
" cybill
"
and jean smart ofthe
" designing women
"
)
,
and hitch a ride with a man who dies iin the desert
. the original 1968 movie
" the odd couple
" remains a classic comedy
. it inctroduced the motif ofthe roommate
- as
- spouse that has provided gags for movies
and sitcoms ever since
. it was the second outing for the lemmon
/ matthau team
( which debuted infront 1966 ' s
" the fortune cookie
"
)
,
and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies
,
" the front page
"
( 1974
)
and
" buddy buddy
"
( 1981
)
, before going theri separate ways
. the reunion of lemmon
and matthau in
" grumpy old men
" six years ago was delightful
,
and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie
.
but
" out to sae
"
and
" the odd couple ii
" are just beating a grumpy old horse
.
( you can add lemmon ' s
" my fellow americans
,
" i
. e
.
" grumpy old presidents
,
" to tyhat list
, too
.
) let ' s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to dont
. let ' s hope also that we see neil simon ' s name on movies that do it justice
( thsi is his first since 1993 ' s
" lost in yonkers
"
)
