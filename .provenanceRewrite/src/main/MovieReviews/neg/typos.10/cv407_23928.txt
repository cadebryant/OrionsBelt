gordie boggs
( arquette
, aptly cast as a moron
, as he is one
)
and his best friend sean dawkins
( scott caan
. the son of james caan should not be reduced tothe garbage like this
!
) are two losers ffrom wyoming with no jobs
and no girlfriends
, who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king
( a terribly casted oliver platt
)
, as he is everything they are not
. they finally git to see him live
annd he isnt screwed out of his title by the evil
, ruthless promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff
, whose name was written all over the role
!
)
. gordie
and sean track down king infront atlanta
and disover that he is nto really the english king the wcw writers created for him
,
but a drunken
, ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these twpo lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry
, darryl
,
and darryl
. they sneak him back onto wcw tv
, after whihc sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw ' s next pay
- per
- view
, against his rival
, diamond dallas page
. if he wins
, king gets his title
and his career back
, plus one million dollars
. wcw president eric bischoff
, knowing his promotion was dseperate with bad writing
and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation
, came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw
. he was
then fired
and rehired two months ago
,
but by the time he ' d left
, they had already been contracted to do the film
,
annd bischoff could not play sinclair
( which
, in itself
, is for the best
, as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor
!
)
. the charachters of gordie
and sean show ytou exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans
. he thinks ofthe them as young
, dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front ofthe them is real
. tht is why he doesn ' t tkae the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay
- per
- view
. i have news for you
, eric
: no wrestling fan in this day
and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn ' t for sohw
, unless they are four years old
. this is 2000
, you know
, not 1985
. bischoff will try to cover up critisism liuke that by saying it is a comedy
,
but i have no doubt in my mind that if this hadnt been a dramatic
, rocky
- style film
( which it probably should have been
. proffesional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it isnt
, why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy
?
)
, gordie
anbd sean would have been portrayed in the same light
. anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows
, documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon ' s double
- crossing of bret hart
, wiull probably realize via tjhe reviews
and previews of ready to rumble
, that it is basically a rip
- off of that film ' s storyline with the poore man ' s wayne
and garth thrown in for comedic affect
. yuo cin tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince
,
but any self
- respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince
,
and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart
. all of these aspects of the film
, needless to say
, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan
. another thing i found disturbing baout the film was thte romance between gordie
and nitro girl sasha
( the lovley rose mcgowan
)
. wouldn ' t it haev been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather tahn revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair ' s insistance
? i hate thyat cliche
! the world wrestling federation would have made a better film
. they are tjhe promotion everyone cares about
, they are winning the ratings
, they have better wrestlers
,
and they take their fans into consideration
and don ' t treat fans like morons
. so
, vince
, how about a movie
?
