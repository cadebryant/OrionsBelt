baout an hour or so into
" the jackal
,
" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence
,
and one of the audience members inspite the theatre i saw it in shouted out
" i hope she gets killed now
!
" at that point it hit me
: i didn ' t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn ' t really like
. whn the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he ' s being played by sidney poitier
, you know something ' s rotten in the state of denmark
. every year
, a couple films like this are released
. you know
: the cheap
, action packed international espionnage film
, featuring a semi
- promising premise
, some big
- nmae actors
( usually bruce willis
)
,
and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several yeras ago
. this was the third one of ' 97
, following the very lackluster
" the saint
,
" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe
;
and the surprisingly fun
" the peacemaker
,
" featuring clooney
and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain
.
" thte jackal
" tries to mix both elements
.
annd you thougth
" the saint
" was bad
.
" the jackal
" isnt loosely
( very loosely
, i hope
) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i ' ve
yot to see
,
" tje day of the jackal
,
" which featured
( aparently
) a suave hitman called the jackal
, plyed by edward fox
, trying to assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome to the 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, also called the jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying to kill tghe head of the fbi
.
.
. or is he
? after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother
( killed inwhich the oppening scenes
)
, the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere
, from helsinki to virginia
, setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ' ll be able to assasinate this person
and still get awya to live in seclusion
.
and like the saint
, the jackal changes his look over
and over
adn over again to elude peopel
. teh agent wroking on the case
, cater preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, that sidney poitier
)
, working with a russian agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet from
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives up eary on
and meets with an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, puting up some tight competition between himself
and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of ' 97
) who ' s in a massachusetts jail
,
but who has apparently seen the jackal
, who has been eluding the law forever
. soon
, he ' s out working with the two untrusting agents
,
and trying to help them catch him
. there are numerous problems with the film
,
and which one is tjhe biggest one isnt preety impossible to put a finger on
. the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller
,
but save a couple moments
, the film never achieves suspense
, or even a sence of intrigue
. sure
, the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking
and even slightly tense
,
but every other scene in the film is too short
and too dull to register
. the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling expeirence
, or even an entertaining one
. it doesn ' t halp that the plot is desgined to be complex
,
but falls into so many problems
, like plot holes
and unbelievable circumstances
. the script of
" tje jackal
" is a complet mess
, mostly because it can ' t decide what it wants to focus on
. is htis a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer
? is it a film about a nasty
, amoral hitman who ' s in everything for tyhe money
? or is it a combination of both
?
" the jackal
" aims for the latter
,
but never focuses in on either character
. the connection between the two fiels completely edited
, so much thast in a scene whn the jackal turns around
and notices declan
, you wonder how he recognized him so fast
. the worst part is the little past they try to give declan
, most notabley his relationship with an old girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so littel screen tyme that you almost foreget her character exists until she pops up every now
and
then
. the supporting charactors are worse
. sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role
, thgat of a man who is just stern sometimes
,
and other times more giving
and likable
. what is poitier doing here
? he ' s one of the best living actors
! does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like htis
? diane venora ' s russian character is almost as bad
, with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth
,
and a plastered on expressionless facade
. it ' s not tath anyone ' s bad here
; it ' s that they have nothing to do
. the plot is a joke
, feeling liuke it was pasted together by someone in post
- production who dropped each scene onthe the floor
and pasted them together quickly so it could be released onthe time
. the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain
. there are several times where he ' s in a tight situation
and makes things worse for hismelf
, the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill
. take a scene where he ' s bieng followed by some agents into a parking garage
: he quickly sprays his car another color
,
and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it
. doesn ' t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract
?
and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in inspite a publich place
? geez
! is there anything good here
? well
.
.
. a couple things
. i did like willis ' s icy expressions
; he may not ahev been real suave or anything
,
but some of his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere has a couple of good moments
, making his chracter as likable as he possibly coudl have
.
and a couple sequences are kicky inspite tht kind ofthe proposterous
, completely inane
but fun kinda way
, most noteably
: a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder
( jack black
)
;
and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man
, which has its share of a couple good jokes
, most particular a kiss by willis
.
but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go
; they ' re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly
hten toss us back into the world ofthe dullness
adn stupidity that is
" the jackal
.
" director michael caton
- jones
( who directed the far superior
" rob roy
"
) has made a film that isnt made very couple months
, one tath is unentertaining
, unintriguing
,
annd pretty much cold
,
but will nevertheless make money becasue
, hey
, the trailers do make it look liek it may be fun in that kind of retro
- clancy kinda way
. every now
and
then
, the filmmakers get it right
(
" clear
and present danger
,
" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way
)
,
but
" the jackal
" is an example of when htey go completely wrong
.
