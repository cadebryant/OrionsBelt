it ' s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film
-
- children
-
- are either walking out eearly or are half
- asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film
. that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians
, a cold pea soup of cute animals
, stupid home alone antics
, a boring puppy loev subplot between dumb humans
,
and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression
. indeed
, walt disney is rolling over in his grave again
, cursing john hughes ' name forthe making the orignal live
- action 101 dalmatians
, one of the worst kiddie ficks of all time
,
and now its sequel
. the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor
, 101 dalmatians
. the original made mroe than
$ 100 million dollars at the box office
, spawned a torrid collecton of
" collectible
" items tyhat ended up months later in the discount bins of wal
- marts across yhe country
,
and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas
. well
, it ' s been about four years since
then
,
and dalmatian fever is coming back
,
and this time it ' s digitally enhanced
. here ' s the story
. cruella de vil
( glenn close
) is released from prision due to the
" cure
" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr
. pavlov
.
( oh
, how witty
.
) she rejoins the world as a dog lover
and is assigned to a probation officer
, who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film
. cruella
then becomes ella
-
- dog lover
-
- until the plot twists
, like a dog with his leash caught onthe the back of a moving truck
,
and she becomes the evil vixen again
. a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat
,
but she now needs 102 dalmatians instade of the commongly used 101 dalmatian formula
. at this point
, i was envying those kids filing out of tyhe theater
. how low have glenn close
and gerard depardieu
( as the film ' s villain
) sunk in tyhe film business
? it ' s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon
.
and depardieu
.
.
. how can a french guy have a bad french accent
?
and never mind the toilet brush haircut
. the onyl minutely positive selling point i can even think to point outloud isnt the talking bird with a british accent
( courtesy of eric idle
) that thinks he ' s a rottweiler
. now that ' s funny
