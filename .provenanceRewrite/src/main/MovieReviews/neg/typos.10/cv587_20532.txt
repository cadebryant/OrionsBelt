when i ponder childhood memories past
, one of the things that allways springs immediately to mind is watching the
" inspector gadget
" tv show with my older brother
. truth be told
, we were rabid fanatics
; our verzion of cowboys
and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table tothe the theme tune
, alternating who would get to be gadget
and who woudl be sticked playing the part of dr
. claw
, the inspector ' s arch nemesis
. i was never a biggie on nostalgia
,
but you just can ' t help
but hvae fond memories of something like thast
. somtimes i even fidn myself up at 4am watching re
- runs of my favorite episodes
, trying to recapture soem of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid
. at the very least
, i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to ahve at least some kind of similar effect on me
. despite how horrid a film may be
, thte simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up
. so bakc i sat
, with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver
( let ' s face it
; exactly how good can a live
- action disney film really be
?
)
. i ws wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr
. magoo
and george ofthe tjhe jungle
( two previous disney adaptations
)
,
and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well
. rarely has a movei left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness
. as everyone esle was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault onthe mankind
, i was left sitting there
, absolutely speechless
and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen
. cxan something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world
? right from yhe beginning
, i knew i wass inwhich trouble
. infront the opening scenes
, earch character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be
, to simply serve as real
- life duplicates of their cartoon clones
. when referring to them
, peple almost yell in fear that the audeince wiull not catch onthe as to who a certain character is supposed to be
(
" oh
, hi penny
! is brain with you
?
"
)
. creating one
- dimensional replicas is one thing
; having mere names take the place of them is quite another
. the
" plot
"
, shall we call it
, stays fairly in tune wih the original series
. matthew broderick stars as john brown
( how creative is that
?
)
, a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex
( why
, rupert everett
, for the lveo of god why
?
?
?
!
!
!
)
, who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events
. brown is
then rescued
and used as a prototype fo a new law
- enforcement technology wherein he ' s joined with various machine parts
anbd some nifty gadgets to form
( drumroll
, please
)
.
.
. inspector gadget
!
> from here on out
, the movie becomes a hodgepodge ofthe stupid dialog
anbd confusing situations
(
although
, to be fair
, my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragel mind
)
. there ' s something about an evil gadget taking over yhe city
( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon ' s dentures from there ' s something about mary
)
and it all ends with
( what else
?
) a bunch of post
- credit nonsense
anbd a cameo by don adams himself
. to be honest
, i wasn ' t much paying attention to these
" treats
"
. i was just glad that it was over
.
