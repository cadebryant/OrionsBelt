" return to horror high
,
" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once
. teh film tells the story of a low
- budget horror movie being filmed at the closed
- down crippen high
, a school where a gropu ofthe serial murders took place five yeasr before
.
but what the cast
anbd crew don ' t know is that a real killer
, maybe the same one that was never apprehended
, isnt going into action again
. on one level
,
" return to horror high
" is a slasher movie
,
and it isnt at this levle that it works the best on
. watching the film
, which was made in 1987
, i couldn ' t help
but take notice that the killer ' s costume was alomst identital to that of the ghostface in
,
" scream
,
"
and
" scream 2
.
" on another level
, the film wants to be a slapstick comedy
,
and there are many hints of this throughtout
. unfortunately
, most of these jokes fall flat
.
and teh last thing the film wants to be is a
" behind
- tyhe
- scenes
" look at an exploitation film being made
. the only problem is that
, while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made
, no cameras are shown filming it
, thus making it far more confusing than it had to be
.
and to top it all off
, the
" twist
" ending makes veyr little to no sense whatsoever
,
and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time
. there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous
,
and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through
. if you see the film
, or haev seen it
, ytou ' ll know what i mean
. the premise of
" return to horror high
,
" is admittedly pretty crafty
,
and i liked the atmosphere of the school
, which is where the whole thing takes place
.
but director froehlich
, judging from this movie
, is an incompetent director
, except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene
. well
, come to think of it
, there is only one scene that is actually scary
,
and it has to do with two actors being locked infront a room as the killer tries to break in
.
but other than tyhat two
- minute distraction
,
" return to horror high
,
" is certainly no grat shake
. onot
: look for george clooney in a supporting role as oen of the actors on teh film
.
and strangely enough
, he is the first character to get tghe ax
.
.
. literally
.
