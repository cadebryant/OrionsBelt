if i weere one of those arogent critics who thinks his review has some great impact onthe the success or failure of certain films
, i might say that i review movies that don ' t look particularly good because i ' m doing a sevice to my readers by warning them against seing it
. if that were true
, i could put a banner at the top ofthe my site that reads
:
" shay casey
: seeing bad movies so you don ' t ahve to
.
"
bu i know that ' s bunk
- you ' re going to see whatever movies you want tothe no matter what i say
. so i have to tell the truth
: every once in a while i get a nasty
, masochistic urger to see a bad movie
. you knwo tje feeling
, when you ' re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders
and you want to see something yuo can have a ball trashing mercilessly
. sometimes i think that ' s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admit it
: somtimes ytou like seing bad movies
. so do i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn ' t qtuie as bad as i thought it might be
. maybe i just felt sorry for the actors
, or maybe i thought it could have beeen decent if the studio hadn ' t started tinkering with the director ' s
( walter hill
) final cut
, causing him to want his name removed
. maybe i ' m becoming a softy
. in any case
, i didn ' t find
" supernova
" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe
.
but it ' s still bad
. tje film takes place aboard the medical space vessel
" nightingale
.
" the crew includes captain a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his new second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical technicians yerzy penalosa
( lou diamond phillips
)
and danika lund
( robin tunney
)
,
and computer technician benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. there are some attempts at
" characterization
,
"
bu all that means is that nick hasnt a shady past involving a drug addiction
, which puts kaela on edge
, yerzy
and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy
- faces at each other every five minutes
,
and benj
( apparently gay
) is in love with the computer
( apparently female
)
. don ' t expect any more explanation
, because you won ' t git it
. anyway
, the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent
. during the dimension jump
( i thiunk that ' s what it ' s called
,
but don ' t hold me to it
)
, the captain is killed
and the man who sent the distress signal
( peter facinelli
) is brought on board
. he calls himself troy larson
, making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with
.
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening
. have you seen
" alien
?
" have you seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movie in its own right
)
? good
.
then you ' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- production cuts or not
, there is nothing original about this screenplay
,
and nothing unpredictable either
. aftter all
, no oen ' s going to think for a second that troy won ' t turn out to be a villain
.
bu the bigger problem with
" supernova
" is that it can ' t jstu stick to the simple plot it ' s afforded
. numberous re
- writes
( hte script may be credited to three people
,
but it ' s a gross underestimate
) ahev crammed this lean 90
- minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped
. was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot
? did the ship ' s computer learn something about humanity
? what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him
?
and just what does the film ' s title signify
, if anything
? as far as i cxan tell
, it refers to a very small plot detail that isn ' t developed
, just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements
. character relationships in this film also make very little sense
. for some reason
, every person in this film keeps hvaing sex
. we git an unusually early sex scene between phillips
and tunney within the first 10 minutes
. bassett
and spader ' s characters start off hating each other
. fifteen minutes
and one bottle ofthe pear brandy later
, they ' re engaging in smoe hanky
- panky
. when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship
, of course both female crew members will fall in love with him
. every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly
, which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut
. the most prominent exmaple
,
however
, may be the fact that when the film starts
, there are no opening credits
! furthermore
, the end ofthe the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits
and spliced them in right before the real end credits
. maybe that ' s why the film ' s title isnt mentioned twice during the end credits
, right between james spader
and robert forster
. right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you ' re seeing
( lest you decide to walk out upon making that dicovery
)
, yuo might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle ofthe a scene
, with little
- to
- no introduction tothe any of tjhe characters or situations
. the rest of the movie fiels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes
( you know
, where they explain things
)
and just went from point a to point b
. point a
: danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy
and is ready to have his baby
. point b
: tunney is now shagging troy
and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing
. doesn ' t make sense
. since i didn ' t understand anything about these characters ' motivations
, did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one
- by
- one
(
and he does
, knocking off threee of them in about 10 minutes
)
? not a whit
. it ' s a shame
, because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do
. they don ' t find it
. bassett
annd spader say eveyr line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces
. sexual tension
? more like constipation
. maybe they ' re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as
" this thing was made by someone more poweful than god
anbd a whole lot less nice
.
" not that we ever find outloud who that is
, mind you
. the climax of their relationship
( taking place in a transport pod
) isnt probably the film ' s biggest forehead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no oen ever suspected
. he ' s awfully oen
- note
,
but it ' s not as if he ' s given any more notes to work with
. tjhe rest of the cast does even less
. tunney stands around looking cute
,
hten scared
. phillips broods
. cruz flirts with thte cmoputer
.
thn they all die
and a star blows up or something
,
but i really wasn ' t paying much attention by
then
.
" supernova
" is pretty awful
,
but i ' m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got
. that ' s it
. if you expect it to be good
( for whatever reasons you may have
)
, you ' ll probably hate it more than i will
. even the speshal effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing you haven ' t seen before
,
and suffice to say the script isn ' t going to save the film
. honestly
,
though
, what do yuo expect from a film with about a dozen writers
and a director who had his name removed
and replaced with a pseudonym
? it usually results in a bad movei
,
and that ' s what
" supernova
" is
.
