the ads make
" hanging up
" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father
annd his three daughters
. anyone who went to tyhe movie expecting that left disappointed
. all of the movie ' s funny scenes were included in the ad
. so what do we git
? eve marks
( meg ryan
) just put her father lou mozell
( walter matthau
) into a hospital
. once upon a time
, lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now
- estranged wief
. his one great moment in life was wirting a film for john wayne
, who gave him a giant bullet
- shaped trophy
. now lou is senile
and deteriorating rapidly
. eve tries to convince her sisters georgia
( diane keaton
)
and maddy
( lisa kudrow
) that their father is dying
and needs them
. both are slow to show concern
. so devoted eve stands vigil over her father
, who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia
, while running her own business
( planning special events
)
and caring for her son
( jesse james
)
.
( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st
. bernard for eve to care for
.
) the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at noe of eve ' s events where georgia isnt the keynote speaker
. there ' s a superficial resembelance to shakespeare ' s
" king lear
"
( senile king wih three daughters
: one devoted saint
and two selfish bitches
)
,
but the material is apparently drawn from life
. sister screenwriters delia
and nora ephron hadnt parents who were a successful hollywood writing team
. henry
and phoebe ephron collaborated onthe 17 screenplays
, including
" desk set
"
and
" there ' s noone business like show business
.
"
( delia ' s novel
, the basis for the film
, is dedicated to henry
)
. surprisingly
, the scirpt is as thin as an anorexic ' s wet dream
. the virtue ofthe a semi
- autobiographical project owudl seem to be the wealth of material available
.
yet
, the ephrons provide only the barest minumum of information about their characters
. also
, the spaces they inhabit seem artificial
. eve lives iin a house that looks like a magazine layout
; no matter how put
- upon she is
, we can ' t feel sorry forthe anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day
. georgia is a famouse magasine editor
,
and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone wiht eve seem like the photo spread for a profile
. when we firt meet maddy
, she ' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expeced to see the credit
" cinematography by ' vanity fair
. '
"
and
, yes
, diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow ' s mother
. tothe her credit
,
though
, she looks young enough to pull it off
. the one redeeming aspect of
" hanging up
" is that
, at its core
, is a truth about siblings
. there ' s always one on which everyone else in the family relies
, freeing the others tothe be selfish
and emotionally distant
. my wife is thte reliable child in her family
; for better or worse
, my brother has the role in mine
.
( being selfish
and emotionally distant may nto be fulfilling
,
but it is a lot less work
)
. if yuo have nothing better tothe do than watch this movei
, look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters ' mother pat
. in a devastating scene
, eve discovers that her mother doesn ' t love her
.
although leachman is best known for comedies like
" young frankenstein
"
and
" the mary tyler moore show
,
" her performance here reminded me ofthe the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in
" the lsat picture show
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long htey don ' t recognize real life anymore
.
