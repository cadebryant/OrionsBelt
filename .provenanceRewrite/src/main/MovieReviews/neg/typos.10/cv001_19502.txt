the happy bastard ' s quick movie review damn that y2k bug
. it ' s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis
and another baldwin brother
( william this tiem
) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick thte power back on
. little do they know the power within
.
.
. going for the gore
and bringing on a few action sequences here
and there
, virus still feels vyre empty
, like a movie going for all flash
and no substance
. we don ' t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere
, we don ' t know the origin of what took over the ship
( jsut that a big pink flashy hting hit the mir
)
,
and
, of course
, we don ' t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout
. here
, it ' s just
" hey
, let ' s chase theese people around with soem robots
"
. the acting is below average
, even from the likes ofthe curtis
. you ' re more likely to git a kick out ofthe her work in haloween h20
. sutherland is wasted
and baldwin
, well
, he ' s acting like a baldwin
, of course
. the real star here are stan winston ' s robot design
, some schnazzy cgi
,
and thte occasional good gore shot
, like picking into someone ' s brain
. so
, if robots
and body parts really turn you on
, here ' s your movie
. otherwise
, it ' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie
.
