that is
, unless you ' re one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters
. i can tell you one thnig now
: they gave teh entire movie away
. why someone would want to base an entire movei on oney premise
anbd
then give that crucial detail away in the trailers isnt beyond me
.
however
, if they
* hadn ' t
* given it away
, the film would ' ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter
. obviously
, the producers thought they could remake
" the deep end of the ocean
,
" throw in tommy lee jones
and a couple ofthe cliches
and call it an action drama
.
" double jeopardy
" offers solid acting from ashley judd
and tommy lee jones
, who got first billing even
though he didn ' t see to be on screen half as much as judd doed
. it also offers some genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- of
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking up inspite the coffin
)
,
but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot
. half the time i ' m wondering whether i ' m watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries
, which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised
. judging by the beginning
, end
,
and a huge chunk of the middle
, i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too
. the movie ' s stretching for an almost two hour long film with onyl 30 minutes worth of material
. implausible material
, no less
. loose inturpratasion of one of the amendments aside
, too many times in the movie i thought
,
" that is
* not
* possibile
*
.
" that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies
,
but not oen like
" double jeopardy
" that trys to pass itself off as serious drama
. everything seems dragged out
, overplayed
. when tehy shoudl ' ve kept us in the dark
, they let the cat out of the bag too early
.
