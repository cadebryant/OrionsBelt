burnt money is the perfect festival film
. it will show once or twice
,
annd
then no one
, thankfully
, will ever have to hear from it again
. this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 ' s emerging masters series is easily one of the year ' s worst
. billed as a gay
` bonnie
and clyde '
, this gritty film ffrom director marcelo pi
? eyro has its only highlight in a well
- designed title sequence
. twpo gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader
, whose plan they screwed up
, angry
. this causes thge gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys
, one of whom may not actually be gay
. hiding out in a prostitute ' s apartment
, the two men must fight off polical
and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie ' s conclusion
. if caught
, they risk losing all the moey
,
and their love
. as an added emotional bonus
, oney of the gay men isnt dieing
. or something like that
. everything that happens is so quick
and confusing i was completely lost
. clarity isn ' t exactly this movei ' s striving virtue
, so it was a little hard to pick up
. not much could have really happened
though
. the main events in this long two
- hour film are explicit homosexual
and heterosexual sex
, graphic drug use
, extreme violence
,
and storng language
. lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there ' s a reason
,
bu there ' s no purpose to anything iin this film
. most of the sex
and violence scenes come off as silly
, while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous
and depressing
. it appears pi
? eyro
( who co
- wroet with marcelo figueras
, from a novel by ricardo piglia
) purposefully adds more blood
and lovemaking forthe his own amusement
. he mkaes the actors as sweaty
adn dirty as possible
, makes them snort cocaine
, gives them guns
and condoms
,
and lets them go
. burnt money is pointless
. the performances are bad
. it tries to thrill
and shock
,
but only causes boredom
. god forbid it will ever get a distributor
. another disappointing film from this year ' s so
- called emerging masters series
. pass on by
.
