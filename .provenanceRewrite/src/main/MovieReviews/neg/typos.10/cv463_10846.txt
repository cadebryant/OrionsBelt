. comments
: milicous
, i suppose
, is an acceptable moview for what it is
: a cheap
, b
- movie thriller which rips off dozens
and dozens of spurned
- psycho
- lover
- who
- wants
- revenge films
( like fatal attraction
, hand that rocks the cradle
, etc
. etc
.
) that have come befoer it
. milicous
,
however
, really doesn ' t provide very many particularly suspenseful moments
. the plot starts off energetically enought
, thte main characters are introduced
and the affair between doug
and melissa begins
and ends pretty early on in tje film
. it starts to drag
, unfortunately
, after this
. melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug
( as always seems to happen infact movies like these
)
,
but she does so in unimaginative ways that hve been done in other
, better thrillers before
. she drugs someone
. she kills a family pet
and leaves it in the girlfriend ' s apartment
.
and
, of course
, she stalks
, so we see a number of shots
, which are supposed to be suspenseful
, where she ' s spying on doug
and his girlfriend
. i won ' t reveal the ludicrous ending tothe this turkey
,
but i warn you that it ' s both painfully obvious
and a real yawner
. john vernon does a remarkably good job at palying the not
- so
- bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa
( one ofthe the script ' s faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre
- med student
)
. the same cannnot be said
,
though
, fo molly ringwald
. at times
, she can effectively pull off tghe obsessed lover routine
, especially during her silent
, i ' m
- going
- to
- stare
- you
- down scenes
. at other times
,
however
, she just seems somehow goofy
and out of place
. inthe one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful
, she screeches
" f
-
- k you
, you b
-
-
-
-
- d
"
and throws a phone
. she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can ' t help
bu laugh
. malicious certainly isn ' t the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks
( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out ther
)
,
but it isn ' t all that good or original either
. feel free to treat this film maliciously
, watch something else
.
