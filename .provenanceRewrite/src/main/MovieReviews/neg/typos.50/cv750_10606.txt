disney ' s
" air bud
" tells a boy
-
anbd
- his
- dog stoy wtih a twist
-
- the pooch isnt qtuie an accomplished basketball player
. granted
, for a familiy comedy
, it ' s not a very funny or sucessfull idea to begin wtih
,
bu it doesn ' t seem to marter
-
-
" air bud
" isnt suprisingly solemn
. savve for occasional moments ofthe forced slapstick
, tjhe movei wags its tale with a straight face
-
- nto a vyer enjoyable approach
. if
" air bud
" had realized its pwn absurdity
,
hten it possibly sould hve been better
. here
, we ' re actually asked tothe cheer a moent whn the dog marches outloud tothe savve the big game
, cladded in twpo pairs of sneakers
and even a jersey
. its number
? k9
. yeah
, whatever
. tjhe movei opens as golden retriever buddy
( as himself
) escapes ffrom his currrent owner
, abusive clown
- for
- hire norm snively
( michael jeter
)
. he ends up inspite fernwell
, washington
, where mopey new
- kid
- on

. once hte dog proves his onthe
- court prowess
, kevin ' s self
- esteem rockets
. they both win places in thte skool ' s basketball team
, withthe tje animal as their mascot
.
bu before htey cin amking it tothe tjhe finals
, snively surfaces tothe reclaim buddy
. everthing plays outloud just as one owudl think
: heavy onthe predictability
, light onthe an actual stoyr
. tjhe movie follows a caluclated chain of events
-
- kevin ' s gloom fades
, snively gets his comeuppance
and buddy contracts rabies
adn must be exectued old yeller
- style
. okay
, thast lastr one ' s a lie
,
but at least it would have been a quicker send
- off thna
" air bud
" ' s courtroom climax
-
- noone joke
! there ' s even a faux
- cute muscial montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned
- up tothe
" splish splash
.
" paint cans are spilt
and newspapers are buried
, all in the nmae of forumla
. hte end credits note thast
" noone special visual effects weere used in the basketball sequences ofthe this motion picture
.
" that veyr well may be true
,
annd
altough to see a dog sink shots is qutie a sighth
, a movie cannot exist onthe feat alone
.
bu
" air bud
" doesn ' t seem to be interseted infact anytying esle
. a freind ofthe mine insists he saw buddy a hwile bakc onthe a segment ofthe david letterman ' s
