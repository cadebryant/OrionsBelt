okay
, okay
. maybe i wasn ' t infact the mood tothe watch a mindless action movei
; i am the smae person tht liked leathal weapon iii
, even hwile admitting tath it wasn ' t as ogod as the others
. howewer
, thte latest segal picture didn ' t look that bad
,
and since none ofthe my friends owudl go see a woody allen movei even if i paide them
, i whent to see it expecting a mild dieu hard rehash
. boy
, ws i wrong
! inaddition the first half ofthe the movie
, we are already assaulted withthe segal ' s acting
,
( he is not simply wooden
; he is liuke a wall
)
, gratuitious violence
, an incredible plot
, sexist
and even omre gratuitous nudity
,
adn bad lines thta obviously weere meant as jokes
. by the end
, it is obvious thast hundreds ofthe navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soliders
. nto once in the movei did segal appear worried or undecided
, which did not do much for increasing tje unexistent suspense
. of course
, inaddition movies like these
, there must be a sidekick
,
adn a lvoe interest
. infact these oney we are given a twpo fo one package in tyhe form of a playboy modle
( inaddition the movie
)
, hwihc onyl functions as a supposed comic releaf
( by the way of extrememly stupid unfunny lines
)
,
and tothe have watering eyes
and look awya eveyr time something bad happens in thge movie
. oh
, of course
, she appears naked from the waist up
,
anbd
, of course
, segal kisses her at yhe end affter noone development of their relatiopnship
; tehy did not even seem tothe be interseted inwhich eahc otehr
. i have never seen so littel chemistry between two peopel infact a movei
. often
, tyhe villain saves yhe movie
; unfortunately
, thte villains here are cartoonish
, stupid
anbd unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies have pyscho ex
- speshal forces bad guys
? too many
. i was able tothe predict the action all throughout thte movei
, including the moment where tje sidekick saves the hero ffrom certain death
, yhe scene where thte bad guy can kill the hero
bu procedes tothe explane his plan to him
, the scene where we are shown teh hero ' s superiors are stupid
, teh scene where thte bad guy loses his gun
adn hasnt to fight the hero hand to hand
, etc
.
.
. simply said
, this isnt movei
- making by the numbers
, boring
,
and potentially offensive infront going forthe yhe lowest common denominator of the audience
. my recommendation
: if you go see it
, bring a watch
. you ' ll be looking at it forthe most of the movei
. my
. rent dieu hard
. read a book
. stare at the sky
. do nto waste your time on thsi worthless peice of celluloid
. hte rela sad thing is thast there are a lot ofthe movies out that i owudl rather have seen
; once again
, dragged iin by my friends
, whlch by the way
, liekd the movei halfheartedly
. they probably liek wrestling too
