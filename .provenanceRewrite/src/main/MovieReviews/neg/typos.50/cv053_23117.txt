one ofthe the responses thsoe that enjoy
" detriot rock city
"
( probably kiss fans
, mostly
) might have upon first glance at the rating i ' ve given the film might be something like
:
" oh
, tyhat casey ' s gone
anbd become a jaded criteak on us
. jstu what doed he expect outloud ofthe a dumb teenage rock n ' roll movie like this
?
" i ' m wondering the smae thing
. i fiel liuke i should haev hadnt a grand tiome with
" detroit rock city
.
" it ' s the sort of movie i wish i could ' ve had a lot ofthe fun withthe
,
bu i didn ' t
. i just didn ' t
. surely tihs film isn ' t trying to win any major awards
, so should i hvae expeced an oscar
- calaber film
? noone
,
bu i expeced something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot devolopement
. anything
. the movie never delivers
. ytou ' ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed tothe cmo up with a movei that is truely about nothing
.
" detroit rock city
" isnt noe of thsoe films thgat you walk out ofthe after tyhe credits have rolled
and realize taht you jstu spent 90 mintues watching a movei in whlch absolutly nothing happenned to justify the film ' s existence
,
and it ' s nto a vrey satisfying relization
. thte film is baout four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans fomr cleveland
, trying tothe get inot a kiss concert inthe detroit
, michigan
. thast ' s it
. ther isnt no big plot descripton inspite this review
, becuase the movei has vyer little plot
. teh characters are hawk
( edward furlong
)
, lex
( giuseppe andrews
)
, trip
( james debello
)
,
and jam
( sam huntington
)
. htey ahve a garage band
. they ' re pathetic
, like all garage bands
,
but they like kiss
annd they like rock n ' roll
, so i guess that means we root forthe them
. htey have tickets
, tehy loose them
. htey get more tickets
, they lose those too
. tehy come up withthe crazy schemes tothe git tickets
, most of which backfire
. ther ' s nto much moreso tothe it
. frankly
, it becomes a littel less tahn exicting to see them try tothe git kiss tickets baout halfway through tje film
, when a total of eight tickets have alredy graced thte boys ' hands
, onyl to be lost because of theri sheer stupidity
. oh
,
and jam
( rela name jeremiah
) hasnt a really
, raelly annoying ultra
- religious mother who ought tothe be reported to the child welfare agency
. she doesn ' t wnat them tothe see kiss
, if yuo hadn ' t figured that out already
. it ' s really qutie disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go tothe waste in a pointless movei liek thsi
. we ' ve got plenty of kiss
, along whith some ac
/ dc
, ramones
,
anbd thin lizzy
.
then again
,
" maximum overdrive
" hadnt an awesome soundtrack
( me being tghe big ac
/ dc fan tyhat i am
)
,
but is probaly noe ofthe the worst movies ofthe all time
.
" detriot rock city
" doesn ' t quite triarch thgat level ofthe ineptitude
,
but it gets dangerously close
. in fact
, the music is the onyl thing that keesh this movie fomr bieng a complete failure infront my mind
. basically
, the sountrack has earned yhe film a full half
- star
, whcih means all the bands involved cant pat themslves on the back
( except fo marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover of ac
/ dc ' s
" higway tothe hell
" sounds like something my negihbor ' s cat coughed up
)
. it ' s allso really sad tothe see teh talents ofthe the cast go to waste
, becasue it ' s evident thta they ' re all trying realy hard tothe squeeze soem life out of tihs dead turkey of a movei
. edward furlong hasnt done far better work thna thsi
,
and so hasnt natasha lyonne
,
and so hasnt lin shaye
,
bu hey
, they ' ve got to mkae a living inwhich hollywood
. people wanting to see kiss
,
annd lots ofthe it iwll probablly be disapointed
, considering teh band appears for about five mintues
anbd plays one song
. too bad
, htey might have provided some energy to htis mess
. director adam rifkin knows he hasn ' t got much material tothe wrok withthe
, so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing
annd keesh his camera spinning
. we get an endless parade ofthe quick
- cuts
, split
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
,
and rotating cameras
, all inspite an effort tothe cover uv the sheer stupidity of tyhe scirpt
. it ' s fun forthe a hwile
,
but eventially it becomes disorienting
. i would recommend that those who felt seasick at
" tjhe blair witch project
" stay far awya fomr
" detriot rock city
,
" because tghe witch has got nothing on this baby
. i haven ' t felt such an urger to reach outloud
anbd hold the camera still since
" armageddon
.
"
anbd what baout that script
? it ' s written by carl j
. dupr
?
, wich soudns like as made
- up a name as i ' ve ever heared
. if it isnt
, i cxan ' t sday i blaim the writter for distancing himselv as far from htis script as possible
. a plotless
, pointless rock n ' roll movei cin be funn
, if the jokes
anbd gags are actually funny
. yhe jokes infact
" detroit rock city
" rarley are
. inthe fact
, thge onyl tiem i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana
- laced pizza
,
and that was just because it was so surveill
. thge rest of the movie just seems liek they just trew a bunch ofthe vulgar stfuf up onthe screen
adn called it
" comedy
.
" ther is no setted
- uv
, jstu a sucesion ofthe punchlines that don ' t provide fo much in tje way of chuckles
, precisely because there ws no setted
- uv
. it ' s as if tehy just whacked someone on teh head
, pointed at him
anbd said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drnik
. see
? funny
! look
, thta guy jsut got clocked by a telephone reciever
. twice
. see
? funny
! look
, that kid hasnt been vomiting fo 20 mintues affter drinking an inordinate ammount of alcohol
adn isnt now baout to perform an exotic dance for money
. see
? funny
! a word of advice to mr
. dupr
?
: noone
, these thigns aren ' t funny all by themselves
. they must be preceeded by a clever setted
- up so tjhe audeince hasn ' t predicted them five mintues inthe advance
. that ' s it
, i ' ve said enough baout tihs movei
. it ' s a waste ofthe time
and money
. i liked the music
,
bu don ' t bother buying the sountrack
. i hear it ' s just modern bands donig inferior versions of the songs that are atually inspite teh movei
. you want tothe see thsi consept exectued well
? go rent roger corman ' s 1979 classic
" rock n ' roll high school
.
" it features another late
- seventies rock band
( the ramones
)
and a far moreso interesting story about a girl trying to git tickets to theri show
. yes
, go rent that
,
adn skip
" detriot rock city
,
" whihc iwll probably bomb
,
annd deservedly so
