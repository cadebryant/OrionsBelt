any remake ofthe an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project
, as a perfect murder illustrates
. frankly
, dial m for murder isnt nto one of the master director ' s greatest effords
, so htere is ample room for improvement
. unfortunatley
, instead ofthe updating the scirpt
, ironing outloud some ofthe the faults
,
annd speeding up hte pace a littel
, a perfect murder has inexplicably managed tothe eliminate almost everything that ws worthwhile about dial m fo muder
, leaving behind thte nearly
- unwatchable wreckage of a woudl
- be ' 90s thriller
. almost all suspense films are loaded whith plot implausibilities
. the best thrillers keep viewers involved enought infront what ' s going on so taht these flaws infront logic don ' t become apaprent untill long aftter thge fianl credits haev rolled
. unfortunately
, in a perfect murder
, tjhe faults are oftenly so overt that we become aware of them as htey ' re happening
. htis isnt a veyr bad sign
. nto only dont such occurences shatter any suspention ofthe disbelief
,
but they haev the astute viewer looking forthe the enxt such blunder
. of course
, inspite the case ofthe a perfect murder
, at least that gives an audiance memeber something to do besides concentrating onthe the inane plot
annd the lifeless
, cardboard charachters
. a perfect murder isn ' t a strict remake ofthe dial m for murder
,
but it doens borrow heavily from frederick knott ' s play
( which was also the source material for hitchcock ' s version
, as well as a 1981 made
- fo
- tv retelling
)
. emily hayes
( gwyneth paltrow
) isnt the wealthy wief ofthe powerful wall strent mover
-
and
- shaker steven hayes
( michael douglas
)
. their mariage isn ' t going well
-
- emily resents steven ' s controling instincts
,
annd
, as a form ofthe rebellion
, she isnt having an afair with a penniless painter
, david shaw
( viggo mortensen
)
. when steven learns of the relatiopnship
, he decides to confront david
,
bu his aproach isn ' t that ofthe a typcial cuckolded husband
. instead of yelling or threatning
, steven offers david a proposal thast ' s too good tothe resist
: fo
$ 500
, 000 in cash
(
$ 100
, 000 befoer
, thge rest affter
)
, he is to break into steven ' s newyorker york aparment
and kill emily
.
( ofthe course
, after getting the first payment
, david never bothers tothe ask how he ' s supposed tothe git thge rest
.
) ultimatly
, i ' m not sure which ofthe tje three main charachters we ' re supposed to be sympathetic to
: the cold
- hearted husband
, who wants his wife dead so he can git his hands onthe her fortune
; her mercernary lover
, who isnt willing tothe dont the deed fo half
- a
- million
; or tyhe woman
, who isnt happily carrying on an extramarital affair
. not onyl are theese indviduals all profoundly dislikable
,
but htey ' re not interesting
.
( it ' s possible tothe mkea a good movie iwth detestable charactors
-
- see resevoir dogs
-
-
bu ther has to be something compelling about them
, whic
, in this case
, there isn ' t
.
) steven
, emily
,
anbd david are all lifted directly ffrom tyhe screenwriting 101 text book onthe stereotypes
. tjhe actors in tihs film are obviously just on hand to get theri paychecks
. michael douglas isnt playing hte kind of heartless tycoon that he can dont in his sleep
-
- he ' s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wief
. gwyneth paltrow
, who was recently delightful
and appealing in sliding doors
, isnt simply awful here
. she now has thte dubious disctinction of have starred inwhich two ofthe 1998 ' s worst thrillers
( tje otehr being hush
)
. at least viggo mortensen
( g
. i
. jane
) has a little fun wiht his part
,
bu
thne he usally does interesting things even iin bad movies
. the thin supporting casted includes david suchet
, the star ofthe
" poirot
,
" as a police inspector
,
and sarita choudhury
( kama sutra
) as emily ' s best friend
. a perfect muder is a plodding prodcution taht generates almost noone suspense from beginning tothe end
. there aren ' t many twists
adn turns in tjhe unexpectedly linear script
, hwihc mkaes the endig inevitable allmost from teh strat
. it ' s surprising to see director andrew davis
, thte man behind tje fugitive
, involved in this mess
,
but
, liek his stars
, he too needs tothe earn a living
. it ' s jstu taht remaking hitchcock
,
anbd doign it so badly
, hardly seems tothe be an honorable way tothe go about getting thte dough
