i ' m going to start this review off wtih a hypothetical question
. let ' s sday yuo ' ve jsut been inspite a car accident
,
and yhe driver ofthe teh other vehicule is unconcious
. your firends ahve left to go get help
,
and yuo ' re waiting to see if teh victum wakes up
. a tow
- truck comes along
,
and yhe driver hops outloud ofthe the truck tothe see waht ' s going onthe
. he
then proceeds to kill the unconcious victum by snapping his neck
. dont ytou
: a
) run awya screaming fo your life
, staying away from thge main road
, b
) run away
(
bu nto too fast
)
and stay on hte main road even whn the madman inwhich the truck starts folowing yuo
,
* stop
* to catch your breath
, try to negotiate wtih tjhe pyscho
,
adn whn that fails
, start running awya again
, all tghe while
* staying on tjhe main road
*
? if yuo anwsered
" a
"
, you are far more intelligent tahn the screenwrighter of
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the enxt generation
"
and iwll likely hate this movei
.
howver
, if you answered
" b
"
, prepare tothe enjoy a film made wiht idiots liek ytou inwhich mind
!
" texas chainsaw masicer
: the enxt generation
" is bieng called a sequel
,
but it ' s raelly more of a remake of yhe originnal
. there ' s a faw changes here
anbd there
,
but it ' s essentialy the same
( even tghe infamous
" meathook
" scene hasnt been re
- creaeted
.
) the stoy opens with four teenagers hiting hte road on the nght of thier prom
,
and somehow endig up inspite yhe middle of nowhere
. needless tothe sday
, they soon encounter leatherface
and his nutty family
. much carnage ensues
. tothe call thsi movei inept would be putting it mildly
. in addition tothe teh laughably idiotic situation i mentioned inthe my hypothetical question
, there is a moment towords the end ofthe tjhe film where one of thge baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out ofthe nowhere
. it just swoops down
annd kills him iwth its wheel
. noone explantion isnt given as tothe who was flying it or why he
/ she is gonig aroud killing people wih the planes wheel
. teh dialogue isnt even more atrocious
. zellwegger
, who is kidnapped by
" tyhe famaly
" easly onthe
, keeps trying tothe have normal conversations with theese peple
. when you ' re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws
and dead corpses
, i woudl thiunk that rationality would go out tyhe window
. speaking ofthe gonig outloud the window
, htere is a scene in whihc zellwegger jumps outloud a window
. apparantly
, the stunt double had a littel trouble
, because she visably gets sticked in the window
. the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where tje stunt double
* doesn ' t
* get caught in tje window
. this wass one ofthe many glaring inconsistencies
. there are so many
, iin fact
, thyat if i were tothe name them all
, this review woudl be severeal pages long
. the onyl reason i am giving thsi movie noe star instade ofthe noone stars isnt because ofthe matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a memeber of
" the family
" whith a hydrolic leg
( home
- made
, i might add
)
and isnt so completly over
- the
- top
, yuo can ' t help
but be amazed by his performance
. he obviously hadnt a lot ofthe funn witht this part
,
adn it realyl shows
. he mkaes jack nicholson ' s portrayal ofthe the psychotic inn keeper inthe
" thte shineing
" look restrained inaddition comparison
. forthe a horror movie
,
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the enxt generation
" countains suprizingly little gore
. in fatc
, in contains none
. there ' s a little blood here
and htere
,
bu tath ' s as far as it goes
. hwihc leads me to beileve that tjhe budget must have beeen
* astonishingly
* low
,
and it shows
. everything about thte movei looks cheap
, ffrom the sets tothe tyhe costumes
. especially leatherface
. once frightening
and nightmare inducing
, he ' s now as terrifying as dame edna
. dont yourself a favor
and take a pass at this remake
. check out the far superior orginial instade
.
