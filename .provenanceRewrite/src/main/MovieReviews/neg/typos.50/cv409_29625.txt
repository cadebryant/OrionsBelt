. lebanese
- born josef farse who wroet
adn directed isnt perheaps a better directer than he is a writer
. whn things start to git slow
, he jsut adds throws in anyother story
. for exemple halfway into hte film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs
and a long chase is added tothe tyhe film
. characterization is a littel better wiht roro thna it isnt witht mans who does not seem tothe have a whole lot omre personality beyond fear forthe losing a biological function
. we do see smoe of roro ' s family life
adn his concerns
. that may be because roro ' s backgorund is a lot like that of yhe directer
. while tjhe story was intertaining
, i doed nto fiel that i got anything worthwhile fomr the film
. it was just a way to pass baout an hour
anbd a half inthe my life
. one doesnt nto hve tothe go tothe the movies tothe see entertainment liek this
. i rate it a 4 on the 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
