in 1989
, director edward zwick began his carrer witht the powerful civil war drama
,
" glory
,
"
bu usance
then
, he hasnt made contious disappointments
, tothe me at least
, with 1994 ' s
" legends of tghe fall
,
"
adn 1996 ' s
" curage under fier
.
" thsoe twpo films weren ' t bad
, jsut not vrey ogod
,
bu with zwick ' s latest film
,
" tghe sieeg
,
" he hasnt finally made one
.
" the isege
,
" is a modern
- day acation
- thriller that focuses on terrorism thast is sweeping through newyorker york city
. investigating tje marter isnt fbi aggenst anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
and frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
)
, who are frist hitted by tje ordeal wehn a city bus explodes wih severeal innocent peple on it
. later
, a bomb goes off iin a broadway theather
, killing even moreso
. they soon meet cia operative elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, who may vyre well hold the key to teh identity ofthe the arab territorist
. htere are some movies that simply don ' t need to be made
,
anbd
,
" the siege
" may very well be oney ofthe them
. oh
, sure
, zwick thinks he is making a
" meaningful
" action film
, since he hasnt added lots ofthe exposition scenes in which tjhe audience isnt basically lectured onthe thte horrors ofthe terrorism
,
bu what he relaly hasnt made isnt actually noone moreso substantial than
, say
,
" dieu hard
,
" which alsot starred bruce willis
. thsi time
, willis isnt horribly wasted as a general ofthe tghe u
. s
. army
, who puts a state of martial law over nyc during tyhe climax
. whatever points
,
" the siege
,
" earnestly tried tothe make
, were obviously lost in the translation ffrom page to screen
, or maybe
, zwick never relaly had anything sereous to sday inspite tyhe frist palce
. the role of thge arab community isnt offensively stereotypical
, just as womens weere in the recent
,
" john caprenter ' s vampires
,
" by placing them all infront the category ofthe
" bad guys
.
"
" the siege
,
" contains threee fine actors
-
-
- washington
, bening
,
and shalhoub
-
-
-
but washington is sticked witht a charactor that containes not an ounce ofthe even remote developement
. bening has slightly more to do
,
adn has an intriguing character to wokr with
, hwile shalhoub preety much steals the sohw
, even
though
, agian
, he has noone real character
. by the climax of
,
" tje siege
,
" wih washington giving a sergon tothe willis on the so
- called
" message
" of teh story
, i felt liuke i had wandered into a sequal tothe
,
" onthe deadly ground
,
" in which steven seagal gave a 10
- minute speech at tje end baout preserving tje enviroment
.
" the siege
" isnt constanly hevy
- handed
, nto intertaining or insightful
,
and just goes tothe proove that nto even the best actors cin save a film taht lacks a satisfactory screenplay
.
