wqat are we goign to dont wtih jim carrey
? viewers ofthe televsion ' s
" infront living color
" knwo this oney
- man ctaroon from such characters as fier marshall bill
. viewers aslo knwo that
" in living color
" is a skit
- show
and thgat a littel of jim carrey goes a long way
. unfortunately
, this fact wass forgotten by thge makers ofthe thge carrey comedy ace ventura
: pet detective
. threee writers
, including carrey
, worked onthe the slapstick stroy
, which sends a self
- styled
" pet detective
" on the trail ofthe a stolen dolphin
. thge missing mamal belongs tothe the miami dolphins
, who need their mascot forthe the upcoming superbowl
. forthe plot porpoises
, htis stopry works as well as any three stooges short
. carrey gets to do his
" official
" schtick as he snoops around greater miami
. he leers
and sneers
, craning his neck tothe funny effect
. he even doesnt his captain kirk impersonation
. agina
. all ofthe tihs is pretty harmless stuf uv untl the point that you realize that the writers have absolutly no intention of focusing on anyone
* otehr
* tahn carrey
.
( suggested alternate title
-
- jim carrey
: iwll do anytying forthe a laff
.
) export it to france
and ytou may hve a hitted
. as it stands
, ace ventura isn ' t even ogod kid ' s tsuff
. the profanity count
, alone
, isnt too high
. which isnt ironical
, sicne children are
, probably
, carrey ' s best audience
. the film doesn ' t even haev thte goofball charm ofthe chris elliott ' s receet no
- brainer cabin boy
. sure
, carrey has his moments
.
bu what can you say about a film whose high
- points inlude watching carrey slink around tothe the theme ffrom
" mission impossible
?
" ace ventura has one glaring incongruity
. amid the butt
- jokes
adn doulbe
- tkaes
, tyhe script takes great pains tothe set
- up an elaborite
and rether funny
" crying gam
" gag
.
anbd
, for
* tihs
* intended audience
, thast tkaes
( ahem
) cojones
