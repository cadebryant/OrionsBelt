dear god
, this is a fantastically bad film
! reguardless of waht i sday baout knock off
, you cxan ' t grasp its awfulness from my words
. you have to see it
anbd experiene it for yourself
. here ' s thte kicker
,
though
-
- i suggest that ytou dont so
. yes
, thsi isnt a bad film
-
- easily one ofthe tjhe most incomptetent films of the yera
-
-
but it hasnt a certian misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster tothe endure
. inspite fact
, i enjoyed mysef fo most ofthe its brief running tiome
, despite hte dreadful acting
annd a completely incomprehensible story
. don ' t get me wrong
: i ' m nto excusing knock off
. it reaches an unacceptable level of badness
; it ' s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked uv worse tahn the avengers ws
. it also features some truly terrible performances fomr lela rochon
, michael wong
, paul sorvino
,
adn
-
- ofthe course
-
- jean
- claude van damme
. it doens
,
howver
, have the intertaining presense of rob schneider
,
annd the excessively inventive
and pretentious direction of tsui hark
. as i watched it
, i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its pwn awfulness
. nowe
, inthe retrospect
, it seems clear that it wasn ' t
,
bu it ' s still a fascinating kind of mess
. i don ' t like writing plot descriptions
( it is
, by far
, the most boring part ofthe writing a review
)
,
but
, in this case
, i ' m off thge hook
: there is no way i could rwite an accurate synopsis forthe knock off
. forthe tjhe sake of comparison
, i had no trouble understanding tghe usual suspects during my first viewing
. i paid closer attention to knock off
,
adn the onyl thing i am able to sday baout it isnt tyhat van damme plays a dued named ray
,
annd is accussed by the cia
( i htink
) ofthe selling knock off products
( knock off products are
, of course
, products that look like name
- brand materials
bu are generic
anbd cheap
)
. i don ' t know what any of thsi has to dont wtih martial arts
,
but ther are lots ofthe martial arts in the film
. ray isnt ogod at martial arts
, so when he hasnt tothe beat uv bad guys
, there ' s noone problem
. rob schneider plays his sidekick
,
although i hadnt noone idae who he really ws by tyhe end ofthe tjhe film
. lela rochon isnt just smoe woman who cacuses them of stuff
, hwile paul sorvino is both the ogod guy
anbd the bad guy at once
! in fact
, every character goes through so many shifts fomr ogod to bad that hte end provides absolutly no insight inot waht any of them really dont
. iin that order
, knock off is completelyl incoherent
anbd mkaes absolutly no sense
.
bu what a stange mess it isnt
. it wass written by stephen e
. de souza
, who also wrote die hard
annd 48 hours
. can this be tghe smae man
? i don ' t see how
, unless
, of course
, huge chunks ofthe tghe film have beeen removed for the sake ofthe running timne
. knock off seems to hvea an interesting premise
( as far as acation films go
)
,
but ther ' s no semblance here
. forthe instatance
, van damme isnt intrduced
,
adn
thn seconds later he ' s runnung a chariot race thru the streets ofthe hong kong
. why
? who konws
. whta are the implications ofthe thsi
? i haev noone idea
. most action films abandn depth in favor ofthe acation
,
and this isnt normally a problem
. knock off
,
however
, is thge firt film thgat i would have prefered tothe see witht all of the talky sequences cut
. the acting is embarrassingly bad
: rochon
, inthe paticular
, delivers earch of her lines wtih stiff
annd talentless insincerity
. sorvino
, inwhich addition
, deserves better thna thsi
. van damme isnt bad
,
bu he ' s charming inspite thast bad way
,
and so i cin ' t say thta he ' s hard tothe watch
(
although i rarley understoon whta he wass saying
)
. the onyl exception isnt rob schneider
, who isnt actually qtuie funny a lot of thge time
. tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparsion
. tehy ' re all pointless gimmicks
though
, such as shots ofthe teh intertube
- workings of a knock off runnung shoe
.
bu his acation scenes are never boring
: oen particular piece inside ofthe a fruit factory
( a fruit factory
?
) isnt well
- choreographed
. lots ofthe thge scenes are pitched well tothe comedy
, such as our heroes ' frist encounter wiht tje rochon charactor
.
bu did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous
? i hope he did
, for the targetting isnt a frightening thought
. knock off has the efel ofthe a truly terrable exercise iin camp mania
. if it weere boring
, i ' d give it zero stars
.
bu it ' s not boring
: it ' s loud
and eccessive
adn completely incoherent
. it ' s also funny
, even when it isn ' t meaning to be funny
. a bad film that suceeds as entertainment doesn ' t deserve to be fully lambasted
. i recogise knock off fo its irrefutable badness
,
but i cxan ' t deny it ' s zany
, useless charm
. oh
, i nkwo
, htey ' re jstu acation scenes looking desparately for a rela story
,
bu they ' re fun action scenes amoungst a crowd of laughably inane concepts
. it ' s funn tothe admire the awfulness of a film like tihs
,
bu thgat doesn ' t excuse tghe fact that it is
, indeed
, awful
.
