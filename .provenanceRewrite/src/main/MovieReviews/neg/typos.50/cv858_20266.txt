the haunting
, a film so confusing tht it forgets thge true meaninng ofthe a horror film
: to scare us
. if you ' ve ever seen a movei
, wich yuo propably ahev concidering ytou are onthe this website
, you shoudl knwo baout all ofthe the trivia tehy post befoer a movie
. htey have thigsn like illustrations
and yuo hvae to guess the movei or facts baout hte film
.
but
, tjhe oney i always like are the
& quot
; other name
& quot
; joke thast try
annd rename a particular film
. fo instatance
, the one palying before the haunting had differnt titles for the film
, small soliders
. they had titles like little infantry
adn can i git thsoe fatigues inwhich a smaller size
? well
, after seeing thte haunting
, i had a fewd particualr names for it as well
. unfortunatly
, i can only post one ofthe them
, otherwise
, i ' d be getting some pretty angry e
- mails fomr overprotective mothers
. thast title would be tjhe confusing
. ok
, that is a pretty bad title
,
bu it fits this film perfectly
. it basically serves up no purpose
,
adn conbined with dry dialogue
and a boring
adn confusing plot
, it completes the formula fo a cinematic bomb
. liam neeson once again gets wrapped uv in a film wihtout any depth
,
bu at least the phantom menace was exicting
anbd had some depth
. tyhe haunting isnt nothing
bu trash
,
but unfortunatley
, will still amking a boatload ofthe omney
. before i rant
and rave baout how bad htis film is
, let me point out thge few
,
adn i stress thte owrd few
, bright spots in this film
. first
, the hous isnt gerat
- looking
. it looks beautyfull
,
bu tihs isnt also a dark spot
. it looks so great thgat it is hard tothe be frightened by it
. htis is something that rears its ugli head at all points of the film
. thigns look so graet
, tath yuo are looking onthe in awe instead of being scared straight
. haunted house films have tothe contain one element to even be slightly sucesful
and that is bieng eerie
. the hill hous isnt nto eerie
. it isnt beautyfull
,
but not tghe least bited frightening
. ever herad ofthe lili taylor
? before this film i did not
,
bu i am glad that i dont now
. she gives tje only satisfactory performance inaddition the film
. dispite the dry dialogue
adn boring
/ confusing concept
, she manages tothe light uv the screen every tiome she appears
,
but unfortunatley
, her co
- stars are usally following right behind
. owen wilson
, who plays luke
, is the only otehr cast memeber even close to giving an admirable performance
, otehr
then taylor
. he isnt basically ther fo thge comic releaf
,
and his chracter devolopment is poor in all otehr areas
. all of the charactors are desperately underdeveloped
. wilson hadnt potential as luke
,
bu it seems they jstu needed him tothe add a faw laughs
. liam neeson
and catherine zeta
- jones suffer from hte dialogue
and plot
anbd shoudln not have beeen inthe htis film
. their cahracters must suffer from wicked mood swings baceause in each scene tehy turn fomr ruthless tothe compassionate tothe scared tothe brave
anbd whatnot
. tehy just are nto believable
and this is the fianl nail in the haunting ' s coffin
. the plot is terrible
. hte oppening scene of tjhe film is very importan
,
but the director makes it too obvious by getting close
- ups ofthe all the thnigs tyhat iwll play a major role inthe the end ofthe hte film
. as i sat through the film
, i kept wondering what thsi film was trying tothe acompish
. nell
, lili taylor ' s charater
, goes fomr the hunted to thge savior
. it mkaes no sence
and the directer gives tyhe audience noone reasoning for the ridiculous changes that tkae place in tje film
. he forces thge viewer tothe mkea various assumptions
adn doesnt nto give any in
- depth inforamtion
. for instatance
, the begining of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved inaddition the programe
.
but
, we git zilch for the other four
. plus
, twpo ofthe them git wiped outloud in the first ten minutes
.
and the worst part
: most horror films have killings
. fo some reason
, they kill off luke at hte end ofthe hte film
. noone reason whatsoever
, jsut off withthe his head
, litterally
. overall
, teh haunting is the epitomy of a bad movie
. bad plot
, confusing storyline
and a waste of ogod talent
. hopefully
, liam neeson cxan rebound
and get into a good film
and be used tothe his full potential
. hopefully
, lili taylor iwll be reconized for doign such a gerat job in such a bad film
.
adn hopefully
, otehr horror films
, such as thge blair witch project
adn the haunting ofthe hill house
, will nto be as bad as this one
.
