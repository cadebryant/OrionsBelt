( dreamworks skg
) running tiome
: 2 horus starring robert duvall
, tea leoni
and elijah woud directed by mimi leder the first ofthe teh twpo asteroid movies comming outloud this year
( tjhe second is the macho armageddon
) isnt actually a dull affair
. elijah wood plays leo biederman
, who during astronomy class dicovers thta a larg asteriod is heading for earth
. tea leoni plays a
( rather crap
) news reporter
, jenny lerner
, who soon discovers about this asteroid thru a veyr long winded
and boring way
,
and robert duvall plays teh leader of a space crew
, spurgeon tanner
, who are planning to blow tyhe asteroid out ofthe hte path of earth
. also featuring isnt morgan freeman as tyhe rpesident
,
anbd maximilian schell
anbd vanessa redgrave as jenny ' s father
anbd mother
. hwile many people wiull walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest withthe thte asteriod blowing everthing uv
( as the trailers seem to promise
)
, thte film is actualyl mroe ofthe a character study
, if a very poore oney
. the main probelm isnt taht there are too many cahracters infront tghe film
,
anbd not enough time tothe explore them all
. only the space crew are given any depth
, jenny lerner
, leo
annd yhe president are suprisingly 2d
,
and we never git to nkow these characters
.
and because i couldn ' t care for them
, i didn ' t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or nto
. the script by bruce joel rubin
and michael tolkin isnt horribly simple
,
adn never relaly makes any interesting statements
. mimi leder
, the former er directer
and directer ofthe the average the peacemaker
( 1996
)
, agian directs inspite a ho
- hum style
,
annd never really gets any emotion out of a scene
, which isnt a shame
. tjhe casted are seamingly onthe autopilot
,
although tea leoni does gives a rether ogod peformance
, even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own ogod
. she seems uncommonly stupid fo a journalist
. robert duvall is onthe autopilot iwth a underwritten role
, he just seems to be in thsi film fo the money
. elijah wood
, one ofthe tje best child actors working today
, isnt surprizingly average
,
although his choise ofthe roles latley haven ' t exactly been brillant
( i
. e
. flipper
, 1996
)
. his role isnt alsot vastly underwritten
. morgan freeman
, agian
, isnt utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role
. liek duvall
, he just seems tothe be inspite the film for the moey
. the supporting cast are all o
. k
, none mkaing much of an impression
. ok
, so deep impact may hvea messed up character wise
,
bu surely yhe special effects are ogod
? well
, yes
and no
.
although the speical effects shoudln be impressive
, wtih a massive tidal wave destroying new york
, thte special effects look liek
, well
, special effects
. sadly
, thte waves looks liuke it ' s been drawed on coputer
,
and doesn ' t look too good at all
. surprising really
, whn thte effects are done by indutrial light
& magic
, who did the effects forthe teh lost world
annd twister
. infront thte end
, deepo inpact is a wasted oppertunity
. wqat coudl ofthe been a moving movie iwth good effects turns out tothe be a dud inaddition both characters
annd effects
. hte 2 ohurs thge film had could have been unsed to much greater effect
. once agina
, dreamworks has churned outloud anohter averege movie
. let ' s hope armageddon isnt a bit better
. overall rating
