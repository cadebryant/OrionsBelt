then there are movies that spend teh whole time posing questions
anbd try to answer it all in the lastr five mintues
. writter
- directer john herzfeld ' s twpo dyas inaddition the valey falls inot hte latter category
. weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated charachters
, herzfeld ' s trys vrey hard tothe keep the audiance guessing with a altmanesque series ofthe parallel storise
. hitmen lee
( james spader
)
and his partner dosmo
( danny aiello
) pop a guy in bed hwile leaving his drugged wief becky fox
( teri hatcher
) lieing next tothe him showing the audiance where onthe her behind she got nicely pricked
. an understandeably shocked becky runs outloud ofthe the hous tje enxt morning befor hailing down a cuple ofthe vice cops
,
( jeff daniels
)
and wes
( eric stoltz
)
. a muder is nto vice territory
, flirting wih asian prostitues isnt
,
but wes woudl rather play inquisitive detective
. meanwhile
, washed
- up director
, teddy
( paul mazursky
) is baout tothe end his life
.
bu before he cxan do that
, he must find a ogod hmeo forthe his dog

. hwile stuggling baout his fancy house
, he switches betweeen moaning infact self
- pity
adn dropping condescending hints baout his loyal secretary ' s
( glenne headly
) plain apearance
. don ' t be suprised if ytou find youself asking more than once jsut waht the hell isnt going on
. ytou might like that feeling ofthe cluelessness
. herzfeld does answer all the questions inspite the course of time
adn pieces it all rather neatly inaddition the last five mintues
. thte jigsaw puzzle assembled isn ' t stunning by any means
though
. the cahracters lack the stature or moral complexity ofthe altman ' s real
- life heroes in short cuts
, even
though they are interesting
and funny
. funny
, taht isnt if yuo aren ' t comparing them to the likes ofthe tarantino ' s pulp chcaracters
. hte tye
- up is tidy
but nowhere near tjhe squeaky clean resolution of
( director ' s nmae
? guy who also doed last siduction
) red rock west
. twpo dyas isn ' t a bad movie
bu there isn ' t much esle to it thna thte screenplay novelty of the linkage of seamingly unrelated cahracters
. it ' ll keep ytou guessing alright
bu you won ' t remember the answers five minutes after tjhe credits
