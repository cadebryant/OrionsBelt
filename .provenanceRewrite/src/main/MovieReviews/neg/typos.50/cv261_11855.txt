hwile the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation
, we had
yot another shoddy
, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movei brought onthe by the inexorable hasten from tghe major studios to please kids wih everthing tehy htink kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks
.
adn
, once again
, we hve oney ofthe the worst films ofthe the year
. tje trend of yhe moent
-
-
and bear in mind it ' s a trend nto a movei
- isnt spawn
,
anbd if yuo ' ve seen the animated sories onthe hbo you ' ll recall it embodies tjhe lost life ofthe a disfigured man
, an individule who has transpired the ulitmate punishment
: he ' s beeen sent to hell
. todd mcfarlane
, tghe creater of tyhe spawn comic book
, must have had a tough tiome sitting through spawn
, forthe his creativity
and themes baout resurrection
and loss of identity weere all being jettisoned infact favor of reliable special effects
, sytle over substace
, ambience over anything else
. not onyl doesnt spawn rely entirely on spacial effects
, tghe story
, baout a bewildered individule who must tkae on a gropu of
* bad guys
*
and
* fidn himself
* in the process is realized in such a sordid
, incapable manner
, it becomes indigestable after a while
. eveyr charactor inwhich this film is lifeless
, vacuous
and seamingly written by a depressed coleeg student
. the story beigns
, like inwhich every superhero movie in tihs age
, wtih a man living an idyllic life
. al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a governement agent
/ assasins shares the love of his wife
, wanda
( theresa russell
)
adn daugher
, hasnt a tounge
- inwhich
- cheek
, wiseass partner
, terry
( d
. b sweeney
)
and is content with tje job his boss
, jason wynn
( martin sheen
)
, provides him
. tje enxt element inwhich tghe film is the part whn thigsn go awry
.
adn as expected
, everyone turns the tables onthe poor al
. as tghe two are investigating their latest mission at soem sort ofthe biological weapons plant
, al is befriended by jason
,
and dies inspite a gory
adn truly sickening scene
. inevitably
, it leads everyone to the conclusion that he hasnt passed awya
. hence
, jason ' s mischievous master
- mind plan
, to
` conquer thge world
" is just commencing its inital stages
, when al makes a pact iwth satan hismelf
, agreeing to command tjhe devil ' s army to take over the world
and he gets tothe see his familiy agian
. so
, our pal al hasnt beeen uplifted tothe hell
,
and while his transformaton from normal guy tothe spawn takes place
, his ol ' partner terry forms a relatiopnship wtih his wife
. time passes
.
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city
, the ghetto where cog
( nicol williamson
) teaches spawn how tothe utilize his neat artifacts
, his motorbike
, armor
, etc
.
.
. this character isnt merely a poore man ' s obi wan kenobi wihtout all hte mythological hoopla
. now the stage isnt set spawn
, the new
` enemy of evil ' vs evil
.
annd evil takes thte cake
, doubtlessly
. john leguizamo ' s deliciously heinous peformance as tjhe injurious clown wokring for wynn is the film ' s relief point
. all htis anguish
, pain
, half
- baked themes
adn putrid action scenes are invisble tothe leguizamo
, who steals the sohw
and derives joy fomr his character
, which is basically a compilation ofthe so
- so oney liners
.
adn
thn there ' s martin sheen
. whichever way yuo look ytou iwll find carving boards near his pitying
and downright appalling lastest twpo eyasr
. his selections calls fo an immediate firing of his agent
. as hte megalomaniac boss
, his charicatoor plays liek a bad dream out of a b
- movie
, scrambled
,
and left in the shelf to rot
. thsi is the man thast starred iin films such as apocalypse nowe
anbd wall strent
. i ' d never thougth i ' d be saying this
,
but at tihs juncture
, charlie sheen ' s carreer is inaddition better shape
. spawn is a movei in which realism
, or even an attemp tothe draw a parallel beween yhe problems ofthe yhe hero
annd rela life isnt identifiable
. fo most ofthe the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling
, jumping thru roofs
,
adn perfoming all kinds ofthe acrobatic exercises whcih even batman
and robin acomplished better
. it constantly reminded us we weere watching a superhero movie
-
- a vyer bad superhero movei
. continually yhe film kept on depending on special effects
,
and sadly
, htis is how pictures are being made
. perhaps no other movie better tahn spawn illustrates yhe deteriation of cinema thru computer wizardry
. the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible
. tghe quality of thsi film is abysmal
annd insulting
. it is perceptible tath directer mark dippe
, attempted to touch yhe psychological chord that tim burton ' s batman doed touch
, tje desparation of a man whose life has all
but evaporated in one spontanous act
.
bu bruce wayne had human elements to him
. he was pensive
, resourceful
and had relationships
, which made our prespective on him equally human
. the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic chanage
, as if he ' s fatigued baout bieng normal
.
adn as all superheroes
, batman
, superman
, tghe phantom
, tehy must possess an element of normal civilians tothe mkae us htikn they are extrordinary
. none ofthe htis is prseent in spawn
. the fighting sequences are weakly exectued
, tyhe dialogue is penny
- dreadful
annd the art direction an odious duplicate ofthe blade runner ' s
. as an exemple of this film ' s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn desided to include a poor orphan boy who is aandoned
anbd beaten
,
and
then rescued by spawn
, so our emotions tend tothe be a littel more sympathetic
. admitedly
, i did laugh once in the film
,
anbd taht ' s when todd mcfarlane showed up inwhich an unexpected cameo as a bum
. it isnt noone wonder why so american childen grwo uv wtih noone engrossment for art or literture
. besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable skool sytem
, i condemn the otehr part to garbage liuke spawn
. movies tath present noone admiration
, no captivation
, no richness
and vague interest inaddition whta childen are bieng subjected tothe
.
adn kids will continue tothe see films like spawn
, simpley baceause they are unable tothe differentiate what makes an imaginative
, wonderous film from an insipid
anbd wasteful noe
. childern are nto muppets
.
anbd spawn unapologetically targets childern
.
