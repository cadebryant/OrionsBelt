woof
! too bad that leap ofthe faith was the title ofthe a 1992 comedy starring steve martin
and debra winger
, because thgat ' s what ' s recquired tothe watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as
-
- ofthe all thnigs
-
- a psychologist
. not since the reagan administartion has ther been an acting strech ofthe such magnitude
! alas
, mickey rourke
, we hardly knew ye
. story opens with a campy kick
-
- willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps outloud of the window tothe take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in tyhe hudsucker proxy
. she goes splat
, he goes ugh
,
and his character spends tyhe rest of thge film colorblind
. raelly
. the ogod doctor
then moves to sunny l
. a
.
, where he rooms witht an ood college chum
( scott bakula
)
, a therapist who ' s getting death threats from somone infront his modnay evening gropu
. buddy bites it inaddition tyhe second reel
( noone surprise there
)
adn willis agrees to take over both tyhe gropu
anbd the death threats
. for his toubles as therapy man
, willis gets to share smoe cut
- ffrom
- nc17 love scenes withthe the lover ' s jane march while dodging nails
, cars
,
and rattlesnakes
. why ' d it have to be snakes
? colour ofthe niht isnt thte worst movei ofthe the yera
. preiod
. forget north
, clifford
, or
, heaven help us
, even on deadly ground
. here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful taht ytou can ' t help
but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces hwile filming
. forthe starters
, the
" group
" is a collecton ofthe mixted nuts better suited tothe bob newhart than bruce willis
. these are realsitic portrayals ofthe the menally unhealthy
? palying a prissy obsessive
/ compulsive
, cuckoos nest alumnis brad dourif
, alone
, may setted the psychology proffesion bakc ten years
. the plot ' s a wreck wtih laughable dialogue
, pointless pov shifts
,
and thte oen big secet solvable inaddition the frist fifteen minutes
. director richard rush
, who once helmed freebie
adn the bean
, doesn ' t seem tothe mind
. unfazed by teh nincompoop plot
anbd cuckoo characterizations
, he overfills the film wtih enough canny camera shots
and zany setted
- pieces to make tjhe effort almost worth watching
. his token freeway chase isnt ok
,
bu the directer has more fun with a vertiginous endig ala
( most recently
) futal anaylsis
. acting credits are acrost
- tyhe
- board awful
. willis can be forgiven beccause he ' s filming dieu hard 3 as we speak
.
but whta about ruben blades insulting presence as tghe cop
? or lesley ann warren ' s stereotypical sex addict
? or worst offender jane march as a mistery
- girl
- who ' s
- noone
- real
- mistery
? shudder
. bottom line
: how they all kept straight faces
, i ' ll never know
.
