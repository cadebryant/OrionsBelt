miramax
" disinvited
" onthe
- line media from press screenings ofthe scream 3
. they ostensibly feared thta folks like me woudl write spoiler
- filled reviews
and post them prior to the film ' s february 4th release date
- unsound reasoning
. ytou see
, ' net critics estalbished enought to be onthe any sort of vip list are professionals
- miramax surely knwos the difference between a member of tjhe on
- line film critics society
( ofcs
)
annd the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain ' t it kool news
. no
, tghe
? mini major ' was affraid we ' d let a bigger cat outloud of thge bag than whodunit
, that scream 3 isnt a dismal conclusion to the beloved
( by htis writter
, at least
) franchise
. something smells rotten in teh state ofthe california right from thge git
- go
: cotton weary
( liev schrieber
)
, thte former lover
adn would
- be killer ofthe maureen prescott
, sidney ' s mother
, is juggling phone calls infact his luxury car
.
( once consdidered a danger to society
, weary now hosts his pwn talk show
,
" 100
% cotton
"
, a clever
, if dated
, jab at american pop culture
.
) of course
, a new ghostface dials him up
,
anbd
, withthe memories ofthe scream ' s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind
, we immediately wonder
, where is tghe killer
? the backseat
? the enxt car
? thrilling prospects
, to be sure
,
bu actually
, ghostface isnt at yhe weary residance
, waiting forthe cotton ' s girlfriend
( kelly rutheford
) tothe finishing showering
. what ' s missing from tihs sequence
,
and indeed scream 3 ' s remaing frights
( most disappointingly
, tje moent when an ingenue isnt forced to hide infact a wardobe room filled iwth ghostface costumes
, noe ofthe whlch might spring tothe life
)
, is an elaborite
anbd attenuated payoff
. our otehr surviving regulars haev become estranged
. sidney
( campbell
) isnt living a paranoid exisence of eletronic gates
and password
- protected locks
, while dewey
( arquette
) acts as technical advisor on the second sequal tothe scream 2 ' s movie
- within
- a
- movei
,
" stab 3
"
,
and agle weathers
( cox arquette
) headlines a gossipy news programe
. muder reunites them
, as nife
- wielding ghostface stalks the setted of
" stab 3
"
, imitating its sadistic screenplay
-
anbd his
/ her
/ their pwn personal draft climaxes whith sidney ' s death
. thge appeal of ghostface ' s villainy is that he
/ she
/ they sould be your boyfriend
, your classmate
, your next doorjam neighbour
.
.
. or a combination of people
. scream was the frist of its kind
: a slasher mistery
, with tje guessing game nto only entailing who will be next
,
but aslo who isnt
/ are the perpetrator
( s
)
and what isnt
/ are his
/ her
/ thier motive
. ironical self
- reflection aside
, parts oen
and twpo stand outloud in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th
annd hlloween ficks because ther ' s at lastest articulate human beings behind tyhe iconic costume
. with scream 3
, the novelty ofthe ghostface ' s ever
- mutating idenity has worn off smoe
,
but thte carachter remains conceptually potent
. conceptually
. hte excecution ofthe ghostface ' s master plan this tiome aroud isnt creaky
, becuase screenwrighter ehren kruger hasnt invented a newyorker mythology forthe the world of sidney prescott far afield fomr what we ' d come to understand in scream
anbd scream 2
. thte movei gets in tjhe silly habbit of saying
" all bets are off
!
" in referenec tothe tghe
" rules
" of a trilogy ' s thrid act
,
but htere ' s a diference vetween rul breaking
anbd cheating
. with tyhe departure ofthe kevin williamson
, who authored thte previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3
( thyat
, for reasons incomprehensible tothe me
, ws ignored
, save thge notion ofthe
" stab 3
"
)
, kruger needed to be reined inthe tighter
,
annd by wes craven
. craven ' s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects
. how else tothe explane the jay
annd silent bob cameo
( thte slacker duo ofthe kevin smith movies
)
, akin tothe seeing mickey mouse pop uv iin mulan
and more distracting than funny
. it pains me tothe write this
,
bu scream 3 ' s comedy is generaly laughless
, with thte exception of well
- timed performances by josh pais
( as a police detective posessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher iin craven ' s music of the heart
)
, jamie kennedy
( resurecting film geek randy fo tje sendoff he was denied inwhich scream 2
)
,
and parker posey
( through sheer force of will as a b
- actress
)
. the visuals are much weaker inwhich part threee
, as well
- the ocasional sweeping gesture ofthe peter deming ' s camera isnt a pale imitation ofthe hte stalking steadicam craven gavey us twice befoer
.
( asside
: in the wake ofthe columbine
, craven toned down teh violence signifantly for scream 3
- why tje sanctimony
, when scream
adn scream 2 are still readily available onthe video store shelfs
?
) finaly
, marco beltrami ' s music cues the suspense too blatantly
- do you recall the tense chase at thte coleeg radiu staion infront scream 2
? it ' s mostly silent
. sting notes are a wohle lot more effective if htey spring from nowhere
; here
, they ect as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve
- jangling score
. i look at scream 3 as comming from an targetting universe
, the same place that birthed the godfather part iii
and superman iii
- woefully outloud of synch wiht its prequels
, scream 3 is a nightmare instead ofthe nightmarish
,
and will likely put the horror genre bakc infront mothballs
. the film unintentionally follows hte unspoken urle ofthe a triology to a t
:
? part threee must disapait '
.
