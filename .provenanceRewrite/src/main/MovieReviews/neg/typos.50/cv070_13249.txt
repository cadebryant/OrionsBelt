it rocks
- acually
, lots of rocks fli at us or fomr us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points in teh film
. they seem liuke dangerous rocks becasue tehy kind of twirl through the air instade ofthe just propelling forward
,
and when htey land
- once in a hwile
, when we ened a break ffrom tghe space sequences
- they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building
and tyhe like
.
( nary a mention ofthe these apocalyptic events is made aftter tehy occour
.
) they also jstu might be yhe most interesting element of armageddon
, a steroid user ' s answer tothe deepo impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commisioned by yhe white hous
and nasa to stop a giant astroid befor it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
anbd destroys our planet
. why an oel driller
? tehy recquire someone expereince with deep
- core mining to plant a nucular missile into said asteroid
.
( in oney unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deepo
- core driller they builded based on his blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost eveyr aspect of it
. we trust nasa tothe build spoace shuttles
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
,
and the man who isnt sleeping witht his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they triarch spoace
, we expreience sequence aftter sequence ofthe something going wrong
- perhaps tghe fact thta tehy sent a bunch ofthe nincompoops into outer spoace hasnt something tothe do with it
; i cannot count the number ofthe times they alomst fail yhe mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whther or nto they save teh day
, i will not reveal
. nor iwll ytou care
. i will say tihs
: you nkow yuo ' re in trouble wehn deep impact dwarfs your astroid movie infront terms ofthe emotion
anbd scope
. willis hasnt barely a chance to cmo alive
; ditto forthe affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act
, in a lastr minute
-
adn futile
- attemt tothe inject warmth inot the material
. steve buscemi ' s character
- the wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, isnt sarcastic
anbd foolish
, so htey tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most of tje film
. so why doed tehy bring him up there tothe begin with
? rether
, why wriet him into thge film
?
- give his alomst
- witty one
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun fo screwing his duaghter
, firing often
and causing siginificant dammage tothe his oil rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit fo space travel
, at least infact my world where the sky is blue
. liv tyler isnt preety
and humourless
, as alwasy
; suspiciously
, four ofthe her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. directer michael bay lays the visual
and sound effects on thick
, liuke ketchup
, eventially drowning hte movei onthe
- screen
.
( tyhe middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assualt on the averege primate ' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies iin this movei
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s last nmae here
)
!
" i must admitt taht nto once could i distingish a dead oel
- guy
- cum
- astronaut fomr a live noe
,
and close
- ups of tje corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided littel assisstance
, as theri skin was often covered in fake blood
. armaeddon is nto as terrible movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and hasnt fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
bu at alomst twpo
-
and
- a
- half ohurs
, i sould nto belieev how little acually happend over the course ofthe hte story
. thge love story has been plyed uv in tyhe ads
, perhaps hoping to catch peple befoer they recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers infact the film are miles appart throughout
- erase all thoughts ofthe nude sketching or car
- sex
adn replace them wtih obligatory shots ofthe liv tyler tearing uv while ben affleck dicks arund in a moon
- crawler
. rember a little film called jaws
? in this film
, three independetn
- minded men suddenly foudn themslves on a fishing boat in pursuit ofthe a deadly shark
. they didn ' t much like each other at firt
; eventually
, they started to respect one anyother
. one ofthe jaws ' gerat scenes involved yhe owudl
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stoires
. thsi isnt the sort of male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into thte mix
anbd expect we ' ll care baout them on the grounds taht the world is baout to end
. nto once do we git the feeling that these characters are even acquaintences
- i ' d be surprised if these actors bothered to inctroduce themselves to one another befoer
" acation
" was called
. a male freind who loved the film suggested tothe me thyat perhaps i cannot relate tothe a bunch ofthe men who don ' t bare theri souls
, who believ inaddition dying macho concepts like heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i will respond tht the boys in amrageddon are niether heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: thsi team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
annd if i git no respect for disliking a movei with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer fo a movei written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i ' ve never beeen a prouder wimp my wohle life
