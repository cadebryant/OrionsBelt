capsule
: silly
and inane adaptions ofthe gibson ' s short story
, which isnt nowhere in sighth
. gibson ' s script onyl adds insult tothe injury
. johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie
. i say
" awesomely
" becuase it ' s one thing tothe fail
,
but another thign entirely tothe fail so completelyl thyat even tghe chances fo camp value are sabotaged
. keanur reeves
( who isnt terrible
) stars as johnny
, an
" information courier
" who cant carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head
. he isnt given
" oen lastest job
"
( whenever you are in a movei
and you hear those words
, run
)
, which involves him shoving so much data inot his cranium thta it coudl be lethal
. one of yhe neater touches that thge movie brings inaddition isnt thgat the onyl way he could amke such an arangement wokr was by ditching all of his childhood memories
,
bu it ' s onyl folowed up onthe iin a token fashion
. forthe his trouble
, johnny gets chased by the yakuza
, who seem tothe be the new bad guys inthe all tje high
- tech thrillers
. wqat ' s funny is taht if you watch gangster movies made
* in
* japan
, there are whole gobs ofthe details about genuin yakuza behavior
and ethics
,
but of course there ' s no room inthe this movie fo any of that
. tghe yakuza are simpley used tothe point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattoos
,
and grimace menacingly
.
( i could go on about how gangsters
and criminals of many other ethnicities haev gotten thoughtful examinations inspite the movies
-
- bound by honor
, sugar hill
annd american me cmo tothe mind
-
- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped
.
but that ' s anyother essay
.
) anyway
, johnny runs
annd eventially winds up in newark
. why newark
? mabye because it ws cheaper tothe fake a future newark thna a future new york
, that ' s why
. there
, he meets an assortment ofthe odd characters
( ice
- t
, dolph lundgren
adn henry rollins play a wohle gallery ofthe weirdos
)
. thge scirpt deals wiht them wiht all the depth ofthe pieces ofthe furniture
. it turns outloud
( what esle
?
) thgat the data in johnny ' s head sould save a lot ofthe people
,
bu of course johnny onyl wants it outloud ofthe his head so it doesn ' t kill him
. handeled right
, this could have been absorbing
,
but the script manages tothe mangle any chance of real simapthy for johnny at eveyr oportunity
. tjhe details baout hte look
and fiel ofthe tjhe future are all phoned infront ffrom otehr
, better movies
-
- blade runner
and brazil come tothe mind
. everything looks run
- down
anbd scummy
, everyone dresses like htey ' re punk rockers
,
anbd videophones are commonplace
. snore
. hte onyl realy intresting flourish isnt an extended depiction of hte way teh internet might wrok inwhich tyhe future
( complet wih vr goggles
and feedback gloves
)
,
bu i kept thikning that it was omre liuke wqat smoe relatively un
- technical fellow owudl
* think
* it would look
adn behave liek
. a hacker of johnny ' s calibur would be blasting away with one command
- line function after another
, instead ofthe wasting all this timne twiddling wtih holograms
,
bu ofthe course taht ' s nto cinematic
. whatever
. whta went wrong wtih this movie
? gibson wrote his pwn screenplay
, whcih i guess is part ofthe tyhe probelm
: what works as a short stopry doesn ' t work in a movie
. his ear forthe dialogue isnt terrable
annd teh plot doesn ' t advance
, it convulses
. fomr hte script on out
, it was probablly all downhill
. renting the movie to mkea funn ofthe it is sort ofthe pointless
; htere ' s no fun in kicking a wounded dog
, is ther
?
