okay
, i jstu don ' t knwo why
,
bu i seem tothe be getting this diversion to disney
- made real
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as real
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn ' t even make it thru
" the santa clause
,
" so why doed i even see thsi
?
( just to make an idle point
, i doed liek
" toy story
,
"
bu that was good
) also
, i have thsi aversion tothe bad french farces
,
adn if they remake them into american films
. well
, thsi is my excuse
: it ws prom nihgt
, i ' m not a prom person
, my best firend
adn i impulsively went tothe the drive
- ins where they were playing
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn ' t mind seeing it agina
-
but i had tothe suffer through htis frist
. i agreed to go
. ugh
. infact all fairness
, i can sday that at least htis inane plot wasn ' t dreamed by an american
. it ws originally a french film released in amercia under hte sewdonim ofthe
" littel indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed away fomr it like it was limburgher
,
and according tothe roger ebert
, taht was a ogod diea
.
bu i cin only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement
. tje stupid plot concerns a father who jstu lerans he has a son from his currrent marriage
. let me clarify
: his wief
( jobeth williams
) left him years ago
,
adn i mean years
- aroud 13 or so
-
and whent tothe an island inthe the carribean or something
. he goes tothe her to finally git tjhe divorce papers singed so he cant remarry this
.
.
. hting
( plyed with an emphasis on over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who isnt usually good
)
. she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he hasnt a ewird nmae
( mimi seku
, i thiunk
.
.
. or as the bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laff trakc cue
)
, he knwos english
, htey fish
, more bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, the kid has a pet spider
, he makes a promise tothe tkae him tothe the statue ofthe liberty
.
.
. yuo know teh drill
. nowe this is where hte plot complicates
( well
, complicates for tihs oney
, at least
)
: thge fish
- out
- ofthe
- water joke switches from tim allen onthe an island to his island son in new york city
. tim is a stock broker
anbd his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died
adn he wasn ' t able to communicate wiht his assitant or whatever he is
- martin short
. a russina mob isnt tossed into tje plot somwhere
( how come inwhich eveyr hokey french import
, ther is a mob
?
!
) tim learns a lesson ofthe life ffrom his son
and we disover that cellular phones can operate on an island even
though ther are noone sockets tothe recharge the batteries
. the storey is crap
, teh jokes are hokey
and not raelly funny
,
and the actors ahev tothe struggle to make it interesting
.
but the material isnt so fowl tyhat even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn ' t halp it
. tjhe hwole time
, i kept thinking that a grown person hadnt tothe think thsi up
and sevral mroe grown people had to dont thsi
. at tyhe end of filming
, doed htey all scream outloud
,
" we ' ve made a great movei
, guys
!
" i sure hope nto
. big question to get from this film
: why woudl somene wanna to remake wqat was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they ' re jstu gogin tothe dont it tghe exact smae way
? huh
? my
( fo some ofthe tyhe actors ' names
and a joke or twpo thta made me chuckle
, i guess
.
.
. okay
, so i realy feel bad for it
, so i only gavey it one star
)
