: malicious
, i suppose
, isnt an acceptable moview for what it isnt
: a cheap
, b
- movie thriller wich rips off dozens
and dozens of spurned
- pyscho
- lover
- who
- whants
- revenge films
( liuke fatal attraction
, hand thgat rocks the cradle
, etc
. etc
.
) that have come befoer it
. malicious
,
howver
, realyl doesn ' t provide very many partiularly suspenseful moments
. the plot starts off energetically anough
, the main characters are introduced
and yhe afair beween doug
adn melissa beigns
and ends pretty early on inwhich yhe film
. it starts tothe drag
, unforetunately
, affter this
. melissa wiull obviously try tothe take her revenge on doug
( as alwasy seems to happen in movies like theese
)
,
but she doens so in unimaginative ways that ahve beeen done in other
, better thrillers befor
. she drugs somone
. she kills a familiy pet
and leaves it in the girlfriend ' s apartment
.
adn
, ofthe course
, she stalks
, so we see a number of shots
, which are supposted tothe be suspenseful
, where she ' s spying onthe doug
adn his girlfriend
. i won ' t reveal tghe ludicrous ending tothe this turkey
,
but i warn ytou thast it ' s both painfully obvious
adn a rela yawner
. john vernon doesnt a remarkably good job at playing the not
- so
- bright baseball jock who intially gets swepth away by melissa
( one of yhe scirpt ' s faults is to try tothe pass off a character like this as a pre
- med student
)
. tghe smae cannnot be said
,
though
, for molly ringwald
. at times
, she can effectively pul off tjhe obssessed lover routine
, especially druing her silent
, i ' m
- oging
- to
- stare
- ytou
- down scenes
. at otehr times
,
however
, she just seems somehow goofy
and out ofthe place
. in one parituclar scene which i guess wass suppoed to be suspenseful
, she screeches
" f
-
- k you
, you b
-
-
-
-
- d
"
adn throws a phone
. she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can ' t halp
bu laugh
. malicious certainly isn ' t tghe worst thriller ofthe its kind outloud iin thte video racks
( a number of really fat turkies inspite thsi genre are out there
)
,
but it isn ' t all tht ogod or original eather
. feel free to treat htis film maliciously
, watch something else
