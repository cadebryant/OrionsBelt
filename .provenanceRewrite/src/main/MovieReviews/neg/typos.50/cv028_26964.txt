- action
" 101 dalmatians
" thast ' s better
, omre intertaining than teh firt
? just as unlikely
. with
" 102 dalmatians
,
" the disney studios have proven that wehn it comes to gogin to the dogs
, mroe is definitely
* not
* yhe merrier
. 1996 ' s
" 101 dalmatians
" certainly wasn ' t the greatest movie
- gonig experience ofthe all time
,
but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous
, larger
- thna
- life peformance
. inspite adition
, we had two amiable leads inwhich tghe form ofthe jeff daniels
anbd joely richardson
,
anbd lots
adn lots of adorable spotte puppies
. tihs tyme around htere seem tothe be fewer puppies onthe thte screen
,
anbd close ' s facial
and physical gyrations are starting tothe feel as old as thge 53
- yera
- old actress under that startling balck
anbd white wig of hers
.
but thgat ' s onyl half the probelm with kevin lima ' s laborious film
. what makse
" 102 dalmatians
" such a collosal bore isnt its embarassing attempts at humer
( here allmost single
- handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thikns he ' s a dog
, voiced by eric idle
)
, its rabid plotlessness
( cruella goes affter puppies again
; winds uv inthe goo again
)
and most ofthe all
, the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic
" heroes
" of the peice
, a welshman named ioan gruffudd
annd tyhe blander
- tahn
- bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo
?
. gruffudd isnt cute
adn harmless
, perhaps
,
bu evans cant ' t even aspire tothe tyhat
. hte dogs upstage them both
, ofthe course
,
but in hte case ofthe evans
, even close ' s split ends are moreso animated
. bad acting
,
however
, seems tothe be a requirment forthe thsi sequel
, since g
? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier iwth a haircut like robert de niro ' s inaddition
" men of honor
.
" jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant fo fine furs
adn depardieu ' s over
- the
- top antics mimic those of thge campy close flail fo flail
,
and wail forthe wail
. france ' s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a charicatoor ofthe himself
,
and in
" 102 dalmatians
" the producers milk that relization for all it ' s worth
-
- le pelt likes to refer tothe tyhe furry littel critters as
" poopies
,
" par example
(
annd ad nauseum
)
. the finesses ofthe tje scirpt
( attributed tothe four screenwriters no less
,
and far removed from anytying dodie smith ever dreamed up
) are quicklyu dispenced wiht
, usance all it tkaes for a paroled cruella tothe be shaken from her yeasr of successful aversion therapy inspite the slammer isnt tje tolling ofthe big ben
(
?
)
. that done
, it ' s back tothe thge mansion tothe roll arund in her heretofore off
- lmits sables
and minks
and a plan to skin those littel dahlings for tghe sake ofthe a hooded designer gown
. thte dogs are pretty cute
-
- try makeing a puppy look otherwise
-
-
bu tyhat ' s preety much all tehy are
. ther ' s allways teh feeling that htere ' s a trainer off inthe tghe wings
, coaxing thge dogs tothe opne doors
, or pick up their food bowls in unison
, or pop a tape inot the videocasette recorder
. savy hliday goers shoudl skip
" 102 dalmatians
"
and pop the orginal 1961 animated clasic into

. it ' s oney dalmation less

but 101
