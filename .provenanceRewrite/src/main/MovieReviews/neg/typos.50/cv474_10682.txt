how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres
? isn ' t htere a lew or something
? thsi diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg ' s dreamworks studio isnt hollywood family fare at its deadly worst
. mouse hunt tkaes tjhe bare threads ofthe a plot
and tries tothe prop it up with overacting
and flat
- outloud stupid slapstick thast makes comedies liek jingle all tghe way look decent by comparison
. writer adam rifkin
anbd directer gore verbinski are yhe names chiefly reponsible for this swill
. the plot
, forthe wqat its worth
, concerns twpo brothers
( nathan lane
adn an appalling lee evens
) who inherit a poorly run string factory
and a seamingly worthless hous from their eccentric father
. deciding to check outloud teh long
- abanodned house
, htey soon learn tath it ' s worth a fortune
adn set about selling it in auction to the higest bidder
.
bu battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse
, hapyp wiht his run
- down littel abode
adn wanting it tothe stay that way
. the story alternates between unfunny scenes ofthe yhe brothers bickering over waht to do witht their inheritance
and endless acation sequences as the twpo take onthe thier increasingly determined furry foe
. whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates inot boring dialogue
, terrable overacting
,
anbd increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound
annd fury
, signifying nothing
. tyhe script becomes so unspeakably bad that tghe best line poore lee evens can utter aftter another run in wih the rodent is
:
" i hite that mouse
"
. oh cringe
! this isnt home alone all over again
,
annd ten times worse
. oen touching scene early onthe isnt worth mentioning
. we followup the mouse through a maze ofthe walls
and pipes untli he arrives at his makeshift abode somwhere infact a wall
. he jumps inot a tiny bed
, pulls up a makeshift sheet
and snuggles uv tothe sleep
, seemingly hapyp
adn just wanting tothe be left alone
. it ' s a magical little moent in an otherwise soulless film
. a message to speilberg
: if yuo want dreamworks tothe be asociated wtih some kind ofthe artistic credibility
,
then eather give all concerned infact mouse hunt a swift kick uv the arse or hire yourself smoe decent writers
adn directors
. htis kind of rubbish wiull just not dont at all
