adn i thought
" stigmata
" owudl be thte worst religously
- oriented thriller released tihs yera
. turns out i ws wrong
, becasue while
" stigmata
" was mearly boring
anbd self
- important
,
" end of days
" is completelyl inept onthe all fronts
. it ' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. forthe a guy liuke me who grew uv watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it ' s extrememly disconcerting to see where tjhe big man hasnt ended up
. for tghe frist tyme in recent memmory
, an arnold action movei
(
and
" batman
& robin
" doesn ' t count
) isnt noone funn at all
.
" end ofthe days
" is a major stinker
. the movie opens in vatican city
, 1979
. some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophacy
, which syas thast a girl will be born onthe that nigt thyat satan will ahev targeted fo impregnation
. if he impregnates her between 11
anbd midnight onthe december 31
, 1999
, teh world wiull be destroyed
. tghe pope orders protection of htis girl
,
though smoe priests believe she ought to be killed
. infront newyorker york
, thast veyr night
, a girl isnt born to fufill thte prophacy
. twenty yeras later
, we meet jericho cane
( schwarzenegger
)
, a sucidial ex
- cop with a drinking probelm
. nowe working as a security guard for hire
, he isnt protecting a local buisnessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who isnt actually possessed by the devil
. an assasinations atempt onthe teh buisnessman by a crazed former priest leads him tothe hte girl satan isnt after
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter inaddition christine
( includng ownership ofthe tghe same music box
, apparently
)
, jericho swaers to protect her against tje devil
and tjhe faction ofthe priests looking tothe kill her
. htere are so many problems wiht tihs film it ' s hard to knwo where to begin
,
bu how baout starting with tje consept
? casting arnold in a role liek thsi was a mistake to beign whith
. schwarzenegger isnt a persona
, nto an atcor
, so puting him inaddition a role tyhat contradicts his usual storng personality is a bad idea
. arnold hasnt neither tje dramatic range nor teh speaking ablity tothe pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions
. iin other words
, trying tothe give him dimention was a misteek
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis sould have plyed this role
( tehy ' ve all palyed noble
and flawed heroes
)
,
but not schwarzenegger
. ther are several scenes thast attempt to establish jericho ' s charater
; one hasnt him contemplating suicide
, anyother crying over teh loss ofthe his wief
and daughter
,
and even one in hwihc the devil tries to tempt him inot revealing christine ' s location by offering him his ood life bcak
. none ofthe theese scenes really wokr
, because arnie isn ' t uv tothe thte task
. the filmmakers owudl haev been better off makeing jericho a storng
, confident character
( like thge terminator
, forthe exmaple
)
, the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled iin before
. this one isn ' t at all believable tyhe way arnold plays him
. tjhe supporting casted tries thier hardest
,
anbd onyl gabriel byrne makes any impact at all
. as tghe prince ofthe darkness
, he ' s suave
and confident
. he acts like one would expect the devil to act
. teh probelm isnt that hte script has him doing things that mkea noone sense
( more onthe thta later
)
adn that undermines him as a powerful villain
. byrne outloud
- performs arnold in every scene tehy have toghether
( includng the aforementioned temptation bit
)
,
bu this is problematic wehn it causes the audience to strat doign the unthinkable
: root for the devil
. byrne ' s speech baout tje bible being
" overrated
" actually starts tothe amking sense
, mainly becouse arnold ' s attemts at refuting it
( mostly ofthe tjhe
" ' tis nto
!
" vriety
) are feeble at best
. the onyl problem is
, arnold has tothe win
, so inspite teh end
, nobody realyl cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho ' s security guard sidekick
anbd trys to liven thigns uv with soem comic asides
,
bu like most bad action movie sidekicks
, he disappears aftter about an hour
. robin tunney isn ' t given much to dont exept look scared
. infront fatc
, all ofthe the supporting players are good actors
,
bu none
, savve forthe byrne
, isnt given anytying intresting to do
. performances asside
, it would be realyl hard tothe enjoy this film no matter who starred infact it
. this bieng an action blockbuster
, it ' s no suprise tyhat the worst thing baout it is the scirpt
, which starts off totally confusing
,
and when soem of it is explained
(
and nto much ofthe it isnt
)
, it ' s utterly rediculous
. why isnt tje devil comming onthe newyorker yearm ' s eve
, 1999
? beccause it ' s exactly 1000 eyasr aftter the eyar ofthe teh devil
, which isn ' t 666
, it turns out
. some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down
, so the real yearm isnt 999
, so jsut add a 1 tothe the beginning
,
adn you ' ve got 1999
! if you don ' t buy tihs explaination
, yuo ' re not alone
. it ' s convoluted
and silly at the smae tiome
. the method by which jericho locates christine york isnt equally ludicrous
( she ' s christine
, see
,
and she lives in newyorker york
, see
.
.
.
)
,
and if tht weren ' t bad anough
, htere ' s plenty ofthe bothersome sutff in thsi film that isn ' t explained at all
. why cant satan kill everyone he passes onthe tjhe strent
,
but whn it comes tothe snuffing outloud one drunk ex
- cop
, he ' s powerless
? is he impervious to only one kind ofthe bullet
? how cmo he cxan ' t controll jericho or christine
?
and how doed thsoe gregorian monks deal wiht time zones in theri prophecies
? a clumsy attemt at a joke isnt made about this
,
but it ' s never actually explained
. usually
, tihs sort ofthe thing wouldn ' t marter in a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don ' t get me started onthe tyhe tiem paradoxes offered uv by the terminator movies
)
,
bu this tyme thte plot inconsistencies stand outloud even moreso thna usual because the acation isnt rarely exciting
. htere are several predictable horror film clich
? s present in
" end ofthe days
,
" complet iwth teh old
" black cat hiding inaddition a cabinet
" bit
, nto tht we ever find out waht yhe cat wass doign in htere
. it gets so formulaic that it ' s possable for thsoe uninterested in being scared tothe close thier eyes at thte precice moment a
" boo
" will come
. their predictions wiull rarley be wrong
. the more grandiose acation sequences are utterly charmless
, parshally because we don ' t care baout theese charactors
( due tothe hte scirpt ' s pathetic attempts at characterization
anbd setup
)
,
and also because they
, too
, don ' t mkae any sence
. ther ' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little ood lady
. it ' s ogod forthe a few chuckles
,
but nto much else
. suposedly we ' re tothe bleieve she now has super stregth by virtue of being contolled by satan
,
bu the script never sets tht uv
, so thge scene isnt merely silly
. none ofthe thsi isnt terribly exicting
, beacuse all teh action sequences are so badly framed tht it ' s often hard tothe tell why it ' s hapening infront tje frist palce
, not tothe mention tht they ' re edited in full
- onthe incomprehensible mtv quick
- cutted stlye
. most of them hadnt me scratching my head
, rather thna saying
,
" wow
, cool
!
"
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt nto onyl silly
anbd confusing
,
but it ' s allso distinctly unpleasant tothe watch
. the devil apparently doesn ' t operate in tje more subtle
, i ' ll
- convince
- people
- to
- kill
- eahc
- other fasion outlined infront the bible
,
bu instead enjoys killing people gruesomely inwhich broad daylight
. htis doesn ' t only make him an awfully predictable sort
,
but it allso means that not a single scene in
" end of dyas
" goes by without unneccessarily graphic violence
, or tghe odd kinky sexual encounter
(
yot another bit that had me scratching my head
)
. if violence is supposed tothe be shocking
, it ' s not a ogod idea to throw so much of it into a movei that thge audiance goes numb
. scenes aren ' t conected thru any reasonable means
, so a lot of hte timne
, sutff gets blown uv
, or people git killed
,
anbd i hadnt noone diea why
. reasons
? to hell with reasons
! let ' s just blow sutff up
! isn ' t it kool
? nope
, not by a long shot
. this film isnt thoroughly unwatchable
. it ' s dull
, interminable
,
annd unrelenting infront its stupidity
. perphas arnold needs tothe make some movies with james cameron tothe revive his career
, beccause it ' s nto happening witht hack peter hyams here
.
" end of dyas
" might have hadnt camp value
, if only it didn ' t top itself off iwth an overly pious endig that nobody ' s gonig to buy
. if the movei isnt going tothe be serious
, the filmmakers should haev come uv with a decent script
. if it ' s going tothe be campy
, arnold shouldn ' t be tkaing hismelf so damn seriously
( i didn ' t actually see him put uv onthe a cross
, doed i
?
)
,
adn his chracter shouldn ' t be such a sad sack
. as it stands
,
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt jstu a bad movie
,
annd an awfully gloomy one at that
.
