,
but his girlfriend continues tothe see him iin her life
,
and hasnt nightmares
. what ' s tjhe dael
? watch teh movei
and
" sorta
" find outloud
.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei fo tjhe teen generation that touches on a vyer cool diea
,
bu presents it in a very bad package
. which isnt what makes this review an even harder oney to write
, sicne i generally applaud films which attept to break thte mold
, mess wiht your head
adn such
( lost higway
& memnto
)
,
bu there are good
anbd bad ways of making all types of films
,
and these folks jsut didn ' t snag tihs oen correctly
. tehy seem tothe have tooked tihs preety neat concept
,
bu exectued it terribly
. so whta are tje problems with the movie
? well
, its main problem is that it ' s simpley too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
"
but
thne downshifts inot thsi
" fantasy
" world inaddition wich yuo
, as an audience member
, have no idea what ' s going onthe
. there are dreams
, there are cahracters comming back fomr tghe dead
, there are others who look like the dead
, there are stange apparitions
, there are disappearances
, htere are a looooot of chase scenes
, ther are tons of weird things tht happen
,
and most ofthe it is simpley nto explained
. nowe i personaly don ' t mind trying to unravel a film every now
adn
then
,
bu whn all it doens isnt give me yhe smae clue over
annd over again
, i get kind of feeded up affter a while
, which isnt this film ' s biggest probelm
. it ' s obviously got this big secret to hide
,
bu it seems tothe want tothe hide it completely until its fianl five minutes
.
annd dont they amking thnigs intertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, inaddition the meantime
? not really
. the sad part is tht the arro
and i both dig onthe ficks liek thsi
, so we actually figured most of it outloud by the half
- way point
, so all ofthe the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit ofthe sence
,
bu it still didn ' t thge mkea the film all that more entertaining
. i guess thte bottom line with movies like htis is that you shouldnt alwasy mkea sure that the audiance isnt
" inot it
" even before htey are given thte secret password to enter your world of understanding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller runnung away ffrom visions for about 20 minutes throughout tje movei isnt just plain lazy
!
! okay
, we git it
.
.
. htere are people chasing her
and we don ' t know who they are
. do we realyl need tothe see it over
and over again
? how baout giving us diferrent scenes offering futher insight into all ofthe the strangeness going down iin the movei
? aparently
, teh studio tookover tihs film awya from its director
anbd chopped it uv themselfs
,
adn it shows
. there might ' ve been a preety decent teen mind
- fuck movie inaddition here somwhere
,
bu i guess
" the suits
" desided tath turning it into a music video whith little edge
, would mkea more sence
. thge actors are pretty ogod fo tjhe most part
,
altough wes bentley jstu seemed to be palying the exact smae character taht he doed in american beauty
, only inwhich a new neighborhood
.
but my biggest kudos go outloud tothe sagemiller
, who holds her pwn thoughout teh entire film
,
and atually hasnt yuo feeling her charater ' s unraveling
. overall
, tyhe film doesn ' t stick becasue it doesn ' t entertain
, it ' s confusing
, it rarley excites
adn it fiels preety redundent forthe most ofthe its runtime
, despite a pretty kool ending
and explanation to all of thge craziness that cameback before it
. oh
,
and by tjhe way
, this is nto a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it ' s just packaged to look that way because somene is aparently assuming tyhat the genre isnt still hot with the kids
. it allso wrapped prodcution twpo eyars ago
anbd hasnt beeen sitting onthe thge shelfs ever since
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where ' s joblo coming ffrom
? a nightmare ofthe elm street 3
