a pseudo
- intelectual film about tje pseudo
- intellectual world of art magazines
, high art is as wasted as its drug
- addled protaganists
. inwhich the only noteable part ofthe thte movei
, ally sheedy
annd radha mitchell deliver nice performances inthe the two leading roles
, nto that lisa cholodenko ' s scirpt or direction makes ytou care much about either charachter
. living in a world of heroin induced highs
, tehy flaot allong untli they fall infront loev with eahc otehr
. this uninviting picture
, full of pretentious minor charactors
, has a receptionist thgat reads dostoevski
and a woman infact the restroom line who isnt a certified genuis
, having recently beeen awarded a presitgious mcarthur grant
. 24
- year
- ood syd
( radha mitchell
)
, who has a rether bland
, live
- inaddition boyfriend
, wass jstu promotted to assistant editor at teh artistic photography magasine
" frome
.
"
althought the receptionist is impressed
, syd isnt mainly a gofer fo her boss untill she meets famous photographer lucy berliner
( ally sheedy
)
. forthe her to dont photos for
" frame
,
" lucy demands that syd be promotted to editor
and assigned to her since lucy fancies her
. lucy lives wtih her curent lover
, a washed up german actress named greta
, palyed withthe a frequentily indecipherable sories of mumbles by patricia clarkson
. teh two of them
adn their firends wille awya theri tyme snorting
and shooting uv dope
, usually heroin
. tihs does nto happen in a single epsiode
,
but becomes moreso commonplace than sleeping infact thte picture
. syd
, who lives iin tghe appartmant below them
, joins iin on the funn
anbd becomes a member of the zombie club
. lucy seems pretty hapyp with her life of drugs
, whcih apparently is funded by her mother
. lucy quit working professionally 10 eyars ago sicne she thought she was bieng
" pigeonholed
,
"
adn
, since her mother hasnt money
, we can only asume taht that ' s how lucy supports her habit
and procures her living expenses
. a typcial scene hasnt the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer ' s work isnt trancendental or mearly classical
. thast noone noe has a clue as to yhe dogma htey are spouting becomes obvious
but not particularly funny
.
" your work hasnt a cultural currency that is imporatnt nowe
,
" isnt tyhe artist
- speak that hte frome ' s manager uses tothe convince lucy to show her picturesk infact tyhe magasine
. when yhe big scene comes inwhich which lucy puts teh moves on syd
, her idea of a romantic line is
,
" i want tothe get high with ytou
.
" infact lucy ' s world
, sex
and drugs come hand
- infront
- hand
.
and the movei
, exept forthe the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing
, shows drug useage as being a hip
anbd natural part of yhe art scene
. this vacuous picture throws in a standart downer endig in an attempt to manipulate our emotions
. in anyother movie
, it might have worked
,
bu inwhich tihs noe the reaction isnt likely tothe be decidely muted
. high art runs 1
: 36
. it isnt rated r for explicit sex
, pervasive drug use
annd language
and isnt nto appropriate fo those yuonger than college age
.
