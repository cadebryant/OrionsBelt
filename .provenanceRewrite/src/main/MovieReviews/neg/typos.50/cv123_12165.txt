ytou don ' t ened to have seen the originnal
" speices
" tothe appreciate how utterly lousy
" species ii
" isnt
. wtih faw exceptions
, sequels tend to be worse tahn the films that spawned them
,
bu the fatc that
" speices ii
" is a follow
- uv isn ' t the onyl reason it ' s so miserable
. it ' s the predictable storyline
, tje cardboard cahracters
, tje banal dialogue
, the failed attemts at humor
, the revolting spacial effects
, the gratuitious nudity
( all female
, of course
)
, tjhe bad acting
,
and hte bland direction
. the plot
, simply geared at getting yhe alien speices back on planet earth so that it can reak some omre havoc
, involves threee astronauts landing on mars
and inadvertantly bringing some alien slime iin a soil sample bcak aboard their shuttle
. the slime
, well
, sort ofthe jumps out at them
annd the screen turns balck
. that should have been tyhe end ofthe thte movie right ther
. back onthe terra firma
, at least oney ofthe the crew is nowe a carrier of alien dna
annd
, as you ' ll remeber if yuo saw the frist movei
, driven by a strong urge tothe procreate
. onthe a parlalel track
, government scientists have cloned a verzion of sil from hte first film
( now called eve
, again
" played
" by natasha henstridge
)
and are keeping her around for soem testing
. this
, apparently
, includes observing eve ' s reaction to
" teh dukes of hazzard
" tv show
, hwihc she appears tothe enjoy
. eve ' s bio
- rhythms go off thge scale each tiem one of her kinfolk
" mates
,
" whlch we are forced to witness in gross
- out detail
,
but otherwise ther doesn ' t appear to be a wohle lot ofthe reason why henstridge is inspite thsi film
, unless it ws writen into her contract
( let ' s hope it cited oney sequal
and oen sequal onyl
)
. eve fianlly breaks free ofthe her confines
-
-
adn her bra
-
- forthe the finale
,
bu tjhe effects are so messy ytou can ' t really see what ' s going on
. peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told ' em nto tothe go
!
" at thte top of his lungs
, referring tothe the mars mission
bu moreso likely aimed at the makers of htis piffle
. michael madsen reprises his role ofthe press lennox
( so taht he cin enter high security areas
, flash a bayge
and claim to be press
, maybe
?
)
, as does marg helgenberger as dr
. laura baker
, tjhe one subjecting eve tothe tje tv reruns
. they ' re both unbelievably wooden
. what ' s a talented filmmaker like peter medak
(
" tje ruling clas
,
"
" yhe krays
,
"
" let him have it
"
) donig directing tihs tripe
, i wonder
. it ' s an unfortunate trend
, this
: once
- talented directors throwing iin the towel
anbd lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks liuke
" speices ii
.
" lsat year peter hyams gave us
" tjhe relic
"
; noone thanks necessary ther
.
and the first
" speices
" wass helmed by roger donaldson who
, altho certainly no genuis behind tyhe camera
, had demonstrated much better judgment with his previvous choise of projects
. is it jsut thyat there are no better offers outloud there
?
" species ii
" isnt worthless
. worse thna that
, it ' s allso exploititive
, offensive
,
and insulting tothe tghe intelligence at eveyr turn
. it ' s nto that htere isn ' t anything positve to sday about tghe film
. htere isnt
. affter 92 mintues
, it ends
.
