thsi is tghe worst movei i ' ve seen since thge
" so bad i walked out onthe it
"
" jingle all tyhe way
"
. it isnt crap on toast made of crap baked iin a an oven fueled by crap
. it isnt crap thru
anbd through
. nothing works inspite htis film
, as tothe be expeced from joel schumacher
, who hasnt made onyl oney watchable film infront his entire carrer
( that bieng
" cousins
"
)
. here ' s a man who admits he ' s a medicore director
, a rether charmingly self
- effacing statement
.
but truth be told
, he isnt much worse than mediocre
. nto all scorn shouldnt be heaped on schumacher
though
-
- akiva goldsman shouldnt not be alloween tothe wriet ever again
. there is noone plot anywhere
,
and the
" dialogue
" is unrelentingly shallow
, preposterous
,
adn boring
. they setted uv mr
. freeze as a tradgic figure trying tothe cure his cryogenically frozen wief
,
thn completly sabotage his carachter by giving him the lamest noe
- liners
. it turns him inot a stock maniacal villain who throughly enjoys his villainy instade of a brooding scientist who hasnt spended much of his life to bringing his wief from tjhe brink ofthe death
.
bu thyat ' s par fo course
-
- nothing in tihs film makse any sence
, including half ofthe arnold schwarzenegger ' s lines
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold isnt given way too much dialogue to spit outloud at once
. this isnt the smae problem he had infront
" jingle all tyhe way
"
,
and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker
annd more unintelligible as thte days pass
. personally
, i tihkn tht he has mroe pull wiht tghe directors
annd doesn ' t retake scenes to make him understandable
. compare his dialogue iin thge terminator series tothe the load of nonsense that streams forth iin
" batman
& robin
"
. apparently
, james cameron knows how to git a competent peformance out ofthe arnold
. uma thurman isnt not as bad
,
but nothing ressembling good either
. her posion ivy vamps aroud terribly
, chewing uv scenery left
annd right
.
anbd her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub
- snl standart
" acting
"
, as if she ' s reading off cue cards
anbd isnt about tothe laugh at any given moent
. given the
" script
"
, it ' s a wonder it didn ' t ahppen mroe frequentily
. htere is no reedeming feature iin this film
-
- nto george clooney as batman
, chris o ' donnell as robin
, nor alicia silverstone as batgirl
. michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred
, as if the conceet ofthe his illess wass propmted by his cadaverous apearance
. iin fact
, ther was something unsettling about his appearance
, which seems tothe ahev beeen accomplished without any make
- up tricks
, looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dieing man
. unfortunately
, eveyr scene baout alfred ' s sickness is bungled withthe such incompetance thgat there is absolutly noone emotional resonance
-
- they jstu go thru tghe motions
, losing whatever inpact the scenes weere supposted to impart
. the movei is rife wiht poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sence of a big battle
-
- yuo konw there ' s a bunch of peple
,
but instade ofthe a melee
, schumacher decided to foucs onthe a foot or a fist
. there ' s never a moment of awe
, wonder
, or mayhem
. the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects
, which are impressive
(
and probably expensive
)
. even
thn
, thte fights are so full ofthe camp
annd stupidity tyhat they become unwatchable
. tghe hockey team from hell
? not even tghe tv sories got that stupid
( at least nto on tghe grand scale of stupidity that
" batman
& robin
" showcases
)
. frustrating too are thte various supporting cahracters thgat walk onthe
and off witht nothing to say or do
. blink
,
anbd ytou ' ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison
, vivica fox as a
" why is she even in the film
" vamp infact freeze ' s lair
( wiht all of twpo lines
)
,
and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had
.
annd infact wqat almost seems liuke an efort tothe savve onthe costs
, vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs
. fris
-
- she isn ' t even filmed well anough tothe look good
( trust me
, she ' s quite attractive outside of this dreck
)
.
and as if thte film weren ' t bad enough tothe limp along wiht bad direction
, bad dialogue
, bad performances
,
annd bad fight scenes
, there are inconsistencies
annd illogic galore
. i know it ' s nit
- picky tothe ask where thge hundreds of feets ofthe cable are stored in the batarangs
, why the charactor ' s arms aren ' t ripped outloud of theri sockets when they acompish a oen
- armed batarang sive affter falling hundreds ofthe feet
( hwile holding onthe to anyother person no less
)
, or where thge mosture comes from wehn freeze ' s weppon creates tons if ice
. that ' s all traditionnal comic book stuff
.
bu why doesnt batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger thte lives of hundreds ofthe by
- standers
? why isnt there a big switch clearly maked
,
" heat
" inwhich mr
. freeze ' s lair
? why do countless bumbling polical offcers even try to take onthe mr
. freeze hand to hand
? why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl
annd even go so far as to haev a suit made forthe her
? why dont batman
& robin take 10 mintues to bicker before leaving tghe batcave in response tothe an emergency
?
adn usance it established early on thast ivy isnt using pheromones
, why don ' t tehy wear masks to filter it out
? i could go on
adn on
.
" batman
& robin
" isnt a braindead
, pointless
, garish
, loud film tyhat should still reign as thte
" worst film ofthe the eyar
" by the time 1998 rolls allong
. onot tothe warner bros
.
-
- if you ' re gonig tothe amke another batman film
, please replace schumacher whith nearly anyone
. beacuse it could actually git worse than this
. what schumacher does nto understand is tyhat
" comic book
" doesn ' t automatically equal unbearable idiocy
. hte true equation seems to be schumacher
+ batman
= unbearable idiocy
.
