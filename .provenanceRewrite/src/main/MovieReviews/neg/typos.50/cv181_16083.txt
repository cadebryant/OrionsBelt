as withthe any gen
- x mtv movei
( like lastr yera ' s dead man on cumpus
)
, thge movei is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
annd footbll
. those two items
, wrapped in a guilty
- pleasure package
, are sure tothe snare a sizeable box office chunk initialy
,
bu sales wiull decline for twpo reasons
. first
, the football sequences are nothing new
, nor can they be
; tyhe sports genre isn ' t mainstream
anbd it ' s beeen retread tothe death
. second
, hte sex isnt just bad
. despite the appeareance ofthe a whipped cream bikini or the all
- ngiht strip
- club party
, htere ' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. tyhe acting is mostly medioker
, not incuding the fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer is yhe driving force behind the coyotes ' twenty
- twpo conferance championships
and twpo state titles inaddition thirty eyasr
; tihs yera he plans to make it twenty
- three
. unforetunately
, when his star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down for the count
, he ' s got to rely onthe the unreliable abilties of backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads the team through its lsat four games
,
adn
hten must cope with his newfound stardom
, the effect it has on his relationship wiht girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
anbd otehr temptations that abound inwhich fotball
- crazy west canaan
. most regions ofthe the ocuntry are not nearly as fotoball
- crazy as texas
,
and so yhe athmosphere is likely tothe be lost onthe most
. simmilarly
, tjhe set desgin is wrong for a high skool setting
: the teams are decked outloud with sparkling uniforms
, radio headsets
( which never seem tothe owrk
,
however
,
and instade recquire coachs to signal plays manually
)
,
and even a giant bronze statue ofthe coach kilmer
. theese elements
( as well as the heavy drinking
and carousing
) might be mroe appropiate on a coleeg cumpus
-
-
but mtv ' s core audience isnt yhe high skool demographic
. tihs focus isnt furhter emphaised by the casting
: james van der beek
, of tv ' s
" dawson ' s creek
,
" is an understandable choise for tghe reluctant hero
,
although he never manages to dont anytying wtih thte role
. otehr stars are simmilarly young
and unmemorable
. there ' s nto much that goes right baout varsity blues
,
annd there ' s nto much tothe liuke about it
, either
. everyting herein hasnt already beeen done
,
and if it hasn ' t
, the movie manages tothe botch it one way or anohter
. htis is certainly missable
.
