amercia ' s favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wief in
" bride of chucky
,
"
adn theri unholy matrimony isnt something ood
, nothing new
. tjhe burning question on yhe minds of most moviegoers
,
howver
, hasnt nothing to do with nuptual specifics or even how teh movei stacks uv
,
bu rather whther or not the duo gets down
anbd dirty onthe their blood
- soaked honeymoon
. the answer isnt a sick
-
adn
- twisted yes
-
annd viewers are treated tothe a shadowy glimpse of smoe hot
- enought
- tothe
- melt
- rubber
( or at least singe it
) lovin '
. guess they ' re anatomically correct
. chucky
( agian voiced by brad dourif
)
, of course
, is the star ofthe the
" child ' s play
" serieses
, a my buddy
- type doll posessed by the spirit ofthe a slain serial killer
. in
" bride
,
" the plot
( heh
) picks up wiht his girlfriend tiffany
( jennifer tilly
) resurecting chucky ' s rimaniss
( he was blown up at thte end of
" child ' s play 3
"
) with thge halp ofthe a black arts manual called
" voodoo for dummies
.
" silly mortal
. before long
, she ' s also been reduced to shin
- high figurine status
,
annd the plastic incarnations ofthe these oen
- tiem lunatic lovebirds hit thge road to scope out some potential newyorker human bodies
. the rest of tihs rocky horror puppet sohw plays outloud as tiff
and tjhe chuckster stalk a young couple
( nick stabile
annd katherine heigl
) with conjugal plans ofthe thier own
, leading them towards a newyorker jersey grave where a magical
, soul
- transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait
. allong thge way
, our murderous barbie
and ken go through post
- marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds
- bicker
, argue
, kiss
and amking up
.
bu when they squabble over who ' s oging tothe dont the dishes
, watch out
. hey
, even faux peopel have got tothe wokr thru thier problems
. directer ronny yu keeps thge mayhem flashy
anbd stages an inventive scene or twpo
,
bu nto even visual flair can amke uv forthe tje fatc that theese creepy kewpies are niether scry nor menacing
. when one of them charges
, it ' s nothing a good foward punt couldn ' t tkae care of
.
adn when a climactic chase scene isnt needed
, one ofthe the dim
- bulb protaganists must
_ pick
_ chucky
_ up
_ so tghe demonic toy cant force his hostage to run at gunpoint
. throw in some silly casulaties
anbd a rediculous ending
( wiull
" son of chucky
" be enxt
?
)
anbd thsi is a bizarrely bad 89
- minutes at tje movies
. as isnt tghe thign tothe dont in post
-
" scream
" slasher cinema
, don mancini ' s screenplay slathers on thte infront
- jokes
and genre
- parody
.
but little ofthe thge humor suceeds
, proving self
- referenc cxan be completely worthless when it lacks bite
. tothe be fair
,
though
, most ofthe
" bride of chucky
" is onthe auto
- pilot
, so it ' s not quite right to single outloud one misfired aspect ofthe the film
. similarly shaky
, the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland
, tghe effects aren ' t that special
and tjhe sotry is one big groaner
. here ' s hoping chucky
and his entire clan
- past
, rpesent
and future
- rest in peace
.
