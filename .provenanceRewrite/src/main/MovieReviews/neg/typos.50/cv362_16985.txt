. comments
: usance i usually review horror
adn sicence fiction films
, i efel a littel outloud ofthe my league discusting this teen football movei
.
( pun intended
. thank you
!
) varsity blues was produced by mtv
,
and it relaly shows
. several extended scenes allow forthe a continual sountrack of mediocre pop songs meant tothe appeal to the adolescent male audience thsi crap ws intended for
. the teenagers all have reasons fo their melodramatic angst
. the adults all hve problems
, ofthe course
,
and
, as noe
- dimensional cahracters
, they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high skool football team performs
. yes
, this movei represents high skool life infact mtv
- land
. tihs is a land where your health teacher isnt also a part
- tiem stripper
, your ice cream store attendent girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh arund her neck
, your kid brother forms a
" cute
" cult
, your football coach isnt an uncaring
, obssessive madman
,
and your firends ' lives consist ofthe nothing
but getting layed
and driving arround in cop cars naked
. all yuo
, as teh main character
, want to do
,
however
, is read
" slaughterhouse five
"
and attend brown univerity in thge fall
. well
, at least this is a littel more realsitic than mtv ' s
" tje real world
.
" varsity blues stars james van der beek
, this week ' s teen tv star makeing the leap tothe the big screen
. he plays yhe hick moxxon adequately
,
though smoe ofthe his emotional dialogue iwll amking peple chuckle
.
(
" yuo dawn ' t own mah life
!
" who would watn to
?
) jon voight
, tyhe stock evil guy in countless other movies
, isnt
, suprise
, thge stock evil guy here
.
bu is he relaly evil
, or isnt he a product of society
? aftter all
, everybody
, young
anbd ood
, infact this movei hasnt no life whatsoever
annd do nothing
but obssess over high skool football
. maybe tje pressures of tyhe 90 screaming fans at tghe football feild drove evil coach kilmer evil
. the film ' s screenplay never answers htis burning question
. at times
, iliff ' s story does show glimmers ofthe touching or humerous scenes
,
bu
, before yhe audience gets their hopes up thta there might be something reedeming in this movie
, they get trashed wiht anyother lengthy party sequence or overwrought fotball gameboy
. thte movei ' s pacing isnt slow
,
and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious fomr strat tothe finish
. i supose i ' m bieng a little hard on varsity blues
. maybe i ' m jsut a littel miffed that i had tothe pay 3 bucks to see it
, even
though it wass dollar night at yhe cinema
. something about a request from yhe studio made hte theater charge omre money
. i foudn tje film oftentimes ludicrous
anbd boring
. three guys in front ofthe us smuggled beer inot tjhe tghe theater
. i wished i had throught of that
. alcohol
, lots ofthe it
, may hvae helped tjhe viewing experience
.
