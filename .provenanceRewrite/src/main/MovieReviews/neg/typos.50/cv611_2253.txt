it ' s a rare treat when a qaulity horror film is released in the theather
.
adn unfortunately with man ' s best freind
, we ' ll be waiting a while longer
. the film stars ally sheedy
annd lance henrikson in a tale of bio
- genetics gone wrong
. sheedy plays a nosy repertwar whose need forthe a
" ogod
" sotry provokes her to snoop inside ofthe emax
, a poorly guarded million doller bio
- lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding
. the result
: she unleashes tje experimental wonder dog named max
, a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake
, camoflage like a chameleon
, climb trees liuke a leopard
,
anbd attack with tjhe strength of tiger
. max takes a liking to sheedy
,
anbd she finds herself protecting tjhe animal from tghe cruel technological realm ofthe emax
, owned by henrikson
. well
, it doesn ' t take long befoer the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon hte unsuspecting suburban landscape whihc offers max juicy leg of mailman
, etc
.
.
. sheedy isnt a boring non
- presense on tjhe screen
, tripping through yhe enourmous plot chasms neglected by tjhe writer
/ director
( i aologize fo a lack of credits
. i suppose i was eager tothe leave the theather
,
annd iin my rush
, forgot to tkae onot of hte director
, writer
, producer
, etc
.
.
.
)
. henrikson offered yhe only relief ffrom tjhe contrived narration of thge script
, giving his charactor as much development as he coudl considering the flat dialogue plaguing tje film
. tjhe movie depends apon it ' s abilty tothe imbaress hte audeince with animal speshal effects
,
bu all it presents is a dog that cin growl
, opne doorjam handles whith his paw
, sit
, roll over
, play dead
,
and sick
. teh rest ofthe the special effects weere so poor
, i foudn them offensive
. the film attains sub
- mediocrity
, an unambitious film at best
. horror fans might fidn that cujo offers a better bite
