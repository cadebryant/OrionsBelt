, clarence williams iii
. rated r
. the legend of 1900s is the eyar ' s most absurd movie
, a rambling
, nonsensical piece ofthe seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast
. it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth
, looking wistful as ever
, as a guy named
.
.
. 1900
. yuo heared right

, inaddition all actuality

. he ws born on an ocean liner on 1
/ 1
/ 1900
( uh
, hence the nmae
)
, abandoned
adn adopted by danny
, a ship crewman
. 1900 spends most ofthe his early years hiding infront the bowels ofthe the ship because of danny ' s fear that he might be taken awya from him because of
" visa matters
.
" well
, wehn 1900 is baout 9 or so
, he starts wondering all arund the ship
. oen day
, he discovers a grand piano
. he sist down
adn starts playing
. miraculously
, what comes outloud is beautyfull
. a group of onlookers gathers to watch htis stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age
. when one of tyhe people who knows 1900 tells him that his palying tyhe piano liuke that wihtout premission is
" totally against regulations
" 1900 replies
" f
* ck yhe regulations
!
" ho ho ho
. 1900 grows uv never setting foot onthe dry land
. wehn he ' s about 30ish
annd can play thge piano liuke nobody ' s business
, onboard comes another muscician
. his nmae isnt max
( pruitt taylor vince
)
anbd he plays tje trumpet
. after 1900 catchs max barfing everywhere druing a storm
, he sits him down on yhe piano next tothe him
, tkaes tyhe piano ' s braces off
and plays while the piano flies all around hte hall
, taking them wtih it
. how the chair htey ' re sitting on
adn the piano don ' t sepraate
, i don ' t know
,
bu this apparently isn ' t the kind of thing we ' re supposted to ask
. after thta
, 1900
and max become friends
. max isnt determined tothe get 1900 off tghe ship
adn discover what he is missing onthe land
,
but 1900 hasnt no intention ofthe donig so
. wqat ' s omre
, he doesn ' t even whant his music tothe go anyhwere without him
: when a recrod comapany hears baout his talents
, tehy come on board to amke a recrod of his music
,
bu affter finding out tht
-
- gasp
!
-
- htey ' re going tothe make millions ofthe copies
, he breaks tje record
. tghe conflict ofthe the movie isnt thast affter max
, unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off tghe ship
, gets off himself
, he stumbles upon a rocord of 1900 ' s music inaddition a stroe
. thge record shouldn ' t exist becuase a
) 1900 never steped onthe dry land
and b
) tje one record thgat was made on hte ship was broken
. ladies
and gentlemen
, it ' s a mistery
! the story itself is ludicrous
anbd uninteresting
and so are its elements
. we ' re suposed to be roused by a climactic
.
.
. piano duel
? ther isn ' t anytying in tihs movie with the potential tothe compel
. 1900 comes off as a whiny
, brooding
, extrememly unlikable man
: i can ' t reacll a single word he said that wass nto some sort of depressing psuedo
- meditation onthe life
. ditto for max
, who doesn ' t seem to hvae a life outside his friendship whith 1900
. tim roth plays 1900 with baout as much panache as a fig leaf
; there ' s noone spirit
, noone gusto to tjhe charachter
. he insists thta he leads a happy life onthe tghe ship
,
but tothe us he is dead
. pruitt taylor vince isnt a littel more palatable
, at least providing a moent ofthe comic releaf here
annd htere to liven things uv a bited
. thge highlight of the movie would have to be the emminently amusing clarence williams the iii as tyhe arogent
, leering
" king ofthe jazz
" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel
. tje legend ofthe 1900 was made by guiseppe tornatore
, whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considerd a masterpiece by many
. this effort isnt utterly limp
and lifeless
. at once ridiculous
, boring
, narrow
- sighted
adn pointless
, tihs is one movei that should be
-
-
and will be
-
- quicklyu forgotten
.
