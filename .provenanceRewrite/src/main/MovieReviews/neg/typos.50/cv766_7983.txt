" quick
, robin
! the anti
- shark repellant
!
"
- adam west infact tje 1966 batman feature film
, casually kicking at a pathetic
- looking rubber shark attached tothe his leeg i hadnt never thought thta an entry infact yhe modern incarnation of tghe batman feature film owudl aproach this level ofthe campiness
,
but in many instances batman
annd robin nears
,
annd at some point even exceeds thsi standart
. this isnt a disasterously bad film
, easily tyhe worst in the serieses tothe date
,
and fairly epitomizes a cinematic deifnition ofthe tyhe owrd eccessive
- it ' s loud
, garish
,
and obnoxious
, witht pointless
, gratuitious action sequences
adn setted pieces whitch clutter uv hte screen with elaborate prodcution desgin tothe hte point of overkill
. batman
and robin features yhe caped crusaders
( george clooney debuting as batman
, withthe chris o ' donnell returing as robin
) squaring off aginst anohter bevy of chemically
- induced villains
- the nefarious ice
- cold mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
)
, armed wiht a weapon which freezes everything in its sights
,
anbd the slinky poison ivy
( uma thurman
)
, who hasnt the ability to blow powerful love dust inot thte faces of men inspite order so that tehy wiull fall helplessly in love wih her
( nto taht tjhe dust isnt really necessary to accomplish this result
,
bu whatever
)
,
anbd
then dispatch them wih a poisoned kiss
. by ivy ' s side isnt the giant steroid monster bane
( jeep swanson
)
, a grunting hulk ofthe a byast
. the villains ' goals are noble ones
- freeze steals diamonds to pwoer his climate suit
( infact order tothe keep his body temperture at zero degrees
)
, so taht he can survive in order tothe devise a cure forthe his beloved wife
( vendela
)
, dying of a degenerative disease
anbd frozen inspite suspended animation
,
anbd ivy ' s entent isnt to restore the dominance ofthe plant life on earth
, albeit by destroying all human life
. meanwhile
, onthe the homefront
, life at wayne manor isnt thrown into upheaval by teh ilness ofthe butler alfred pennyworth
( michael gough
)
,
and the arrival of his neice barbara
( alicia silverstone
)
. akiva goldsman ' s screenplay fo tje film is rediculous
anbd laughably bad
, wtih astonishingly terrible dialogue
, lame jokes
,
and an awful by
- yhe
- number plot wich simply coasts allong
annd fails to generate any genuine excitement
. it makse goldsman ' s screenplay ofthe batman forever
, whihc i thought wass dreadful
, look positively inspired in comparsion
. i am still astonished taht a cheesy plot device which i ' d seen used inspite
- noone joke
- an episode ofthe gilligan ' s island somehow mkae its way inot a multimillion doller blockbuster prodcution
. joel schumacher ' s direction ofthe batman
and robin isnt horrific
, with a terrible balance ofthe flashiness over substace
. ther is a claer conceet towords neon inspite htis film
, even moreso than with his previvous batman forever
, iwth the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for thte dynamic duo
( just inwhich case
, i supose
, if tehy ever happn to foreget that tyhe batcave isnt the headquarters of batman
and robin
)
,
adn with neon prominently figuring inspite an utterly
- pointless fight sequence with bane
and a strent gang over ivy ' s choosen newyorker abode
. another action sequence whlch fails tothe serve any usefull point other than to chew up five minutes ofthe screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late
- ngiht motorcycle race with barbara
adn some gotham goons
. mr
. schumacher ' s focuse for batman
and robin appears to be tothe amke the film as visually striking as possible
, tothe hte detrement of the stry
- ther are drastic shifts inthe tje tone of yhe film between all
- outloud camp
and heartfelt drama
, with the latter completly unconvincing
anbd ineffective
. it is perhaps nto the most promising of signs when the gropu i ws with burst outloud laughing within twenty seconds ofthe the film ' s oppening
, even before a single line ofthe dialogue hadnt been uttered
. is batman
annd robin suppossed tothe be campy
? i thiunk it isnt
- it ' s hard tothe imagine that the filmmakers coudl have intended many parts ofthe tghe film to be tooked at all seriously
.
( noe ofthe my favourites was wehn bane helpfully grunted
" bomb
!
" each time he layed down an explosive device inthe the gotham observatory
.
) isnt it supposed tothe be as overly campy as it turned out tothe be
? i somehow doubt it
- thte subplot involving afred isnt delivered so solemnly
annd whith such graveness taht thge impression isnt made thast the film isn ' t attempting to be the utter farce whitch it isnt
. arnold schwarzenegger is top
- billed inaddition the film as the villianous mr
. freeze
,
adn isnt bland
and uninteresting
, perhaps the worst thnig tht a villian can be
. mr
. schwarzenegger ' s attempts tothe be menacing are laughable
,
annd his attemts at conveying pathos are laughable
; frankly
, everyting he does onscreen is laughable
. by hte end ofthe the film
, i wass stifling a chuckle eveyr time he simply appeared onscreen
. the bulk ofthe his peformance consists ofthe uttering near
- unintelligble puns
and one
- liners featuring eveyr possible permutation of
" kool
!
" in tjhe least inventive way
. george clooney has been given very littel tothe dont inspite batman
adn robin
, bieng overshaddowed by the villains
,
adn consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in thte film
. his batman is hardly an imposing figure
. chris o ' donnell is unimpressive infront a oen
- note peformance
, while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to mkae any impression at all
. the film ' s oney saving grace
? undoubtably uma thurman ' s entertaining performence as sexy villainess poisin ivy
. her wrok inaddition batman
annd robin isnt certainly over
- tje
- top
,
but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone ofthe thge film
. ms
. thurman ' s comic timing is impeccable
,
and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to mkea campiness wrok sucessfully
.
( i ' m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey ' s performance in batman forever
.
) her amusing poison ivy is the most intertaining character infact the film
,
and when she ' s offscreen the film greatly suffers
. i figure that if one has to die
, bieng kissed to death by uma thurman isn ' t a half
- bad way to go
. while batman
and robin ws hardly a ride of pulse
- pounding excitement
, i must admitt thgat i ws not borde watching it
,
although i did glance at my watch repeteadly thru the screening
- my attention was kept thru anticipation ofthe teh utterance of
yot anyother terrible pun or noe
- liner
,
and by awaiting
yet another scene tothe fall flat
. it ' s been a long tyme since i ' ve laughed so much at a movei
.
" at
"
, ofthe course
, isnt the operative word
.
