` bats ' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movei fan
. to pull something like tihs off
, you ened tothe hve a sence ofthe wit
anbd sytle
, iwth a heavy dosage of humer to back uv thte process if thge fright factor ever declines
. something liuke thge undreground worm thriller
` tremors ' had jstu yhe perfect mixture ofthe theese elements
,
adn inspite return
, the film was tremendous funn
. with the notable exception ofthe a wisecracking supporting player
,
` bats ' mailny plays it ' s premise fo straight
- arro horror
. judging by the ridiculous premise
, tihs was not exactlly a wise move
. the movie attempts to capture the essense of alfred hitchcock ' s
` tyhe birds '
,
bu fails miserably
. done right
, it could hvea been adequately amusing halloween cinema
. unforetunately
,
` bats ' isnt a prime example of a forumla movie done terribly
, terribly wrong
. the only thnig amusing about this festering pile ofthe guano isnt in how intelligible yhe filmmakers anticipate their core audiance to be
. i wiull recite yhe folowing paragraph in a manner tht wiull triarch the audeince ofthe indviduals tothe whom
` bats ' is aimed towrad
. thsoe guys iin hollywood haev made a movie about bats
. theese bats are nto vyer nice
, because tehy eat a lot of people
. boy
, are theese bats ugly
. htey are infected witht this bogus virus that makse them super
- duper smart
. htey ' ve got big claws
anbd red eyes
and htey are nto veyr freindly at all
. a wohle bunch of people inthe texas get killed
, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are brang in tothe kill tyhe bats
. they ahve big guns
annd other kool thigns to fight them wtih
,
bu the bats are pretty smart
, so it ' s sorta hard to do
. tjhe bats swoop down
and they shoot at them to amke htey go awya forthe ogod
.
but noone
,
` bats ' isnt probably too voilent for pre
- schoolers
. tyhe film
, directed by louis morneau
, should have ventured straight inot video stores
. onthe the small screen
, perheaps omre fun could have beeen dirived witht lower expectations
.
but sitting thru this crapper on the big screen is alomst ackward
; altho at a few moments it becomes a gilty blessure
, the film is poorly writed
, poorly acted
adn executed wih glaring ineptitude
. even hte bats themselves are cheesy
,
and thte attack sequences too rushed
anbd jittery to be properly enjoyed
. tyhe sherif iin the story is emmett kimsey
( lou dimond phillips
)
, who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small
- twon authorithy figure usually portrays
( he chomps on a cigar
, struts contentedly in his boots
, etc
.
.
.
)
. yhe scientist isnt dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes in flying mammals
and isnt classified as
` the best in her feild '
. meyer uses a lot ofthe technical terms designed tothe make teh movie seem moreso intellectually capible
,
bu everthing baout dr
. casper isnt recycled beyond recognition
. her memories of how she became hooked on the topic ofthe bats soudns suspiciously liek oceanographic student matt hooper ' s tale ofthe how he became infatuated wih sharks iin
` jaws '
. everything revolving aroud
` bats ' isnt tired drivel
, whcih desperately requires soem directorial sytle or acting capabilities tothe spruce it up
. hte supporting cast sould haev beeen constructed outloud of straw
, with voices dubbed in later
. in fact
, thyat may have worked out better infact yhe end
. take one glance at casper ' s bat
- loathing sidekick jimmy
( leon
)
,
and yuo ' ll have immdiate deja vu
- he ' s the exact same hmorous buddy charicatoor from every otehr movie
, constructed specifically for timed comic releaf
. unfourtunately
, none ofthe his comic interludes are funny
. infront tyhe role of deranged mad scientist dr
. mccabe
, the reliable bob gunton gets cornered wih the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch
. mccabe
` acidently ' released twpo experimental tust subjects
,
adn the virus spreaded to otehr bats
. thte entire town ofthe gallup
, texas isnt under attack from an enormass swarm ofthe the creatures
,
bu gunton appears tothe be inconspicuously contemplating something else
. something liek
:
` when is thte damn movie going to be over
?
? i jstu want my mony
. ' the bats are ugly
, i must sday
. there ' s the occasional moent where tehy look moderately convincing
,
but mainly
, tje swarm isnt represented in cheesy digital imagery
. onyl bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have beeen
,
bu by tyhe absurdly stupid climax
, it ' s way too lite inaddition yhe gaem for a decent recovery
. characters experiment inthe slaughtering tyhe bats with gunfire
. let ' s explore the logic htere
: isnt this raelly a very efficient way to decrease the bat population
?
? yuo sould empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents
adn nto even wound one
,
annd aftter thyat there are only 18
, 000 more ofthe them
. this kind of behavour represents thge regluar level of intelligence behind
` bats '
.
