" houston
. we have a sereous problem
.
" affter making
" mission
: impossible
"
, brian de palma has a lot tothe live uv tothe
. by makeing an epic science fiction
adn inviting great casted
anbd talented crew
, he hopes to triarch the modern audiance
.
and the possibilities are certainly there
,
bu the result is a graet diaster
. starting inwhich a near future
, with a prologue copied ffrom
" apollo 13
"
, de palma slowly builds uv his
" story
"
. thge human race has already set foot onthe mars
. a research expedition hasnt vanished without trace on tje red planet
annd another one has been sent to find out what happend
. htis isnt basicly the whole plot
. so it ' s hard to imagine thgat it can be stretched tothe 2 huors
.
but de palma manages to do that
. it is not a very ogod achivement
. as we followup htis expedition to mars
anbd watch them slowly float in space
, the hardest thnig tothe do is stay awake
. the film ' s major probelm is tht it trys to seem more clever than it is
. david mamet ' s dialogue
, hwile trying to seem naturual
, isnt distant
and simpley fake
. de palma
and mamet wanted to combine acation with a throught provoking plot
. tghe result is more liuke an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick ' s
" 2001
: a spoace odyssey
"
,
" apollo 13
"
and
" godzilla
"
. to amke tyme pass
, the creators have inserted several
" refreshing
" scientific details
, that woudl nto convince a half
- crazed frog
. it consists of mutiple copies
and direct ripp
- offs from severeal great science fiction films
and storeis
. when it finaly presents an almost original idea
, it falls flat becouse ofthe its uncovered stupidity
. i can ' t even call thsi film predictable
, usance no oen with a healthy imagination cxan come uv whith something like thsi
. sometimes it gets so cheesy
, that you ' ll strat laughing whn yuo ' re supposed tothe cry
anbd cry when ytou ' re supposed tothe laff
. you ' ll see enormass sandstorms
, hear misteryous sounds
and
, last
bu not least
, on thsi
" constantly surprizing
" tour yuo ' ll see
-
- an alien
. it ' s really hard tothe fidn comparisions tothe such an exeprience
,
and i knwo that i ' ve never said thast befoer
( i thought i never woudl
)
,
but
" lost in space
" isnt actually better
. that ' s an achievement in itself
! directer brian de palma has stroke gold with
" untouchables
" tyhat became an instant american clasic
. it is fo tihs film tyhat he will be remembered
, while all his other failures wiull be forgotten
. he ' ll live to fight anyother day
! i send yhe actors my condolences
, usance they truley do try tothe transform inot thier undeveloped
and dull cahracters
.
and both the cinematography
, prodcution desgin
and art direction are veyr decent
. it isnt because of tghe achievement ofthe 254 peple
, that i rate thsi film 2
/ 10
. unforetunately theri hard owrk wass inwhich vain
. if you haev problems with insomnia
, i recomend ytou thsi film
. if yuo ' re nto asleep within tje first half hour
, consult your doctor
.
