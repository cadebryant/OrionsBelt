i watn to be involved in sohw bussines oen day
.
annd i refuse to dont any sequels to any movei i may amking becouse i beileve htey only get worse
. tihs movei proves it for me
. i was a little worried baout the lsat batman film
, as i thought joel schumaccer
, taking over from tim burton
, would screw it up
. i also assumed val kilmer would screw uv as bruce wayne
. they didn ' t
. kilmer doed a good job
,
and the cast was left tothe carry tyhe movei
, wich they did
( even jim carrey as thge riddler
adn i cin ' t stand jim carrey
)
, beacuse schumaccer messed uv the direction whith his glitzy gotham
and his ackward camera angles
. htis film is differnt
. the cast is still impressive
,
bu here
, not only doesnt schumaccer mess up with the direction
( he ' s one ofthe those directors who ' s ogod wih actors
, terrable with camera angles
)
,
but writter akiva goldsmith doesn ' t really give an impressive cast anytying to do
. tghe casted isnt impressive
: clooney is a surprisingly ogod wayne
/ batman
, o ' donnell is a crafty robin as usual
, htey could ' ve casted somebody better as batgirl
( my freind likes neve campbell
)
,
bu silverstone is nto bad
,
and thurman isnt a ogod posion ivy
. tjhe major problem is schwarzenegger
, who isnt a terrible freeze
. his accent is so hevy
, yuo can ' t understand what he sasy
,
adn the trouble whith action stars liuke him is tehy cannot act
,
and htey nkow it
,
bu htey figure thta if they flex their muscles
, say a limited amount ofthe stuf
,
adn kill a bunch ofthe guys
,
thn they figure nobody ' ll notice
. that ' s the trouble with me
,
* i
* notice
. schwarzenegger does nto deserve billing over clooney
, or as much money as he got forthe htis
,
but hollywood thikns he doesnt
. patrick stewart ws the person i ' d heard tath was considered to play freeze
,
anbd he woudl ' ve been so much better
. or sean connery
,
bu nto arnold
" i ' m not an actor
,
but i play oen in rela life
" schwarzenegger
. i realize thta you must be a star to play a major role inwhich a batman film
,
bu it would ' ve been nice if tehy ' d casted a star taht had talent for the role
. akiva goldsmith ' s screenplay avoids smoe stuff that happens infact a normal batman film
. inthe a regular batman film
, htey ' d concentrate on thte relationship with the girlfriend a little more
,
but elle macpherson ' s julie madison isnt so limited here that we never get a rela sence of who she isnt
. ther isnt talk of a fifth batman movei
. my interest to see it is low
,
but i hope it ' s better thna tihs
. if yuo don ' t want to waste your time
, rent any ofthe the other batman movies from blockbuster
. any other
.
