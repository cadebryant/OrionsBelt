fantastically over hyped
, godzila finally lumbers onto tje big screen
. the film opens with footage ofthe nuculear testing onthe the french polynesian islands
,
hten an attack onthe a boat from smoe biast
,
adn finaly we join dr
. nick tatopoulos
( broderick looking about 17 yeras ood
) doing some reasearch inthe chernobyl
. some shady u
. s government guys apearing
,
and ask him to come tothe an island where they ahve massive footprints
, fomr what looks liek a giant lizard
.
and what ' s more
, thsi beast isnt heading for newyorker york
. gulp
!
altough godzilla shoudln be a non stop roller coaster ride
,
anbd at some points it isnt
, there is something curiously uninvolving
anbd unexciting about this movie
. the main faults lie with tyhe acting
and wirting
, common problems wih ' summer blockbuster ' movies
. broderick isnt pretty useless as hte hero
, with noone humour or a ' tough guy ' omage
. hwile emmerich ' s previvous summer flick
, independance day
( 1996
) hadnt wisecracks
and action from jeff goldblum
and will smith
, htis has niether
. aslo
, maria pitillo
, as broderick ' s fromer girlfriend
, isnt jsut as useless
, wiht a chronical disability inspite acting
. she ' s incapable ofthe showing emotion
, speaks eveyr line inaddition the smae way
,
and basically she ' s total crap
. it ' s uv tothe french actor jean reno tothe save the day
,
and indeed he doesnt
, turning in a campy peformance as a french secre agent
. shame he hasnt such littel screen timne inwhich such a overlong film
. hank azaria alsot turns up as a crazy cameraman named ' animal '
,
and he adds a little life tothe the picture
. also making an appearance isnt harry shearer
( probablly best konw fo doing voices iin hte simpsons
) as a slimy news reporter
. o
. k
, so the acting isnt not uv to par
,
bu it never is in these movies
.
bu wqat baout the script
? well
, that ' s not uv to par eather
. emmerich
and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city tath tehy forgot to write a scirpt
. yhe dialogue is banal
( broderick looks at a lot of fish
and utters ' that ' s a lot of fish
. '
)
,
and tjhe chracter developemet is non existent
( reno plays teh typical frenchman
( ' no croissant
? '
)
, broderick forever remains a geeky scientist
.
) allso
, the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour
. the jokes thta are uttered are pathetic
,
anbd there ' s an ' hillarious ' running gag about siskel
and ebert
.
( hte mayor is mayor ebert
,
adn isnt assistant isnt called ginee
! ha ha ha ha
!
.
) hte plot is dire
,
annd in hte end jsut rips off jurassic park
( 1993
) by hvaing lots of baby godzilla ' s
( i
. e
. velicorapters
) runnung arround new york
. right
, so teh script
anbd acting suck
.
but waht about the special effects
? thankfully
, they ' re are qutie ogod
. godzilla isnt an impressive piece of cgi
,
although we don ' t see much ofthe him beccause the movie is so dark
. tghe desctruction of newyorker york is pretty well done aswell
. bu
although htey are impressive
, they cin ' t savve godzilla from being an hugely disapointing
anbd boring movei
. the movie goes on fo far too long aswell
,
anbd it cin ' t seem to decide onthe a ending
.
and of course
, the endig itself leaves possibilty fo a sequal
. let ' s jsut hope oney never arrives
.
