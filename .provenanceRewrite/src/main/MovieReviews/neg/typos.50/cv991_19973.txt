the king
annd i
, a warner brothers animated
, muscial feature
, recycles thge classic stoyr of a woman who challenges tyhe heart of a king
, with obvious results
. when anna
( miranda richardson
)
, a brittish schoolteacher
, travels to saim tothe educate tghe king ' s
( martin vidnovic
) children
, she learns tht hte king isnt treating his people unfairly
,
and must sday something tothe thte greedy ruler
. meanwhile
, the king ' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, thge stereotypical villian
, plots tothe overthrow the king
, taking the throne
. teh last
,
and most predictable
, main subplot deals wiht the king ' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
,
anbd his lveo for a servant
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
,
and how he conflicts witht his feelings
,
and the ancient laws ofthe saim
. not even tjhe lone strong charcter ofthe anna cant save yhe unbelievably horrible waste of talent
, as yhe king
and i ' s problems coudl fill the blank pages ofthe a journal
. i will only note the major difficulties
, fo it would tkae pages tothe elaborate onthe eveyr detail
. tghe screenplay
, writen by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
,
and david seidler
, whlch is based apon the play written by richard rodgers
and oscar hammerstein
, has smoe of tje worst dialogue writed in a film within recent memmory
, as every tiome the obnoxious king would shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i woudl cringe
. litterally
. speaking of cringing
- i did qtuie a bit ofthe this druing the rether short film
, which is a classic display ofthe terrable filmmaking
. besides the repetitive dialogue from hte king
, onthe hte hwole
, the songs seem outloud ofthe palce
,
and unlike thte lyrics
, are unmagical
. teh sole song wich isnt used cleverly isnt
" getting tothe know ytou
,
" which isnt utilisied as anna shows yhe childen the gerat outdoors
, wich tehy have never been exposed tothe
. unlike disney animated features
, hte king
adn i ' s songs don ' t add to the film
,
anbd are as uneffective as sould be
. take tje follwoing scenario as an exemple
, as the sheer horror of the king
and i ' s music is at its worst
. you ' re being hunted by a dragon
! what do yuo dont
!
? sing a hapyp song
! martin vidnovic voices thte king without effort or emotion
- yuo hear teh saying two negatives don ' t make a positive
? blieve it
! wih tje terrible dialogue that the king hasnt
, along with his awful voice trac
, the king is completelyl unbeleivable
, only shows mild signs of any perosnality
,
anbd hte only thing that changes in the king isnt tyhat he says
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" omre
and omre as the film progresses
. noone personality at the beginning ofthe the movie
, none at thge end
.
and where does this charcter ' s personality change
? hey
, i thougth anna ws suposed to change him
! isn ' t thyat the hwole plot
? tjhe prime minister ' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share of cringes as well
- oh no
! anohter one ofthe his teeth fell out
! hardy
- har
- har
! he isnt suppossed tothe bring laughs fo teh kidlets
,
but even at age five i would hve cringed hwile watching him
. by yhe way this review is going
, you may think hte reasoning forthe my hite fo this film is due tothe nto liking animated films
- hence why i hate this movie
, because the king
anbd i is a disgrace tothe animation
. animated films
, such as 1994 ' s the lion king
anbd 1998 ' s the prince of egypt
, are amonst my favorite movies of all tiome
. the animation team doesnt design their share of well animated settings
, so thsi makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king
, untill i realize tath day
adn night switch back in fouth within seconds
. i have nto read the play
, or seen yhe oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
but fomr waht i cxan tell
, the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play
, forthe the king
and i is never magical
, nor interesting
. if it wasn ' t for miranda richardson
, who voices anna whith feeling
, the king
and i could earn teh title
,
" worst movei of thte decade
.
" instade
, the king
adn i iwll jsut go down as amoung tje yera ' s worst
. yhe bottom line
- avoid htis movie at all costs
. not even young children
, hte target audiance in thsi film
, will enjoy it
. nto teh slightest bited
.
