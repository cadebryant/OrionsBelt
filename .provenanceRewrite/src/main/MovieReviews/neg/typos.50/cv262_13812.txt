it ' s nto a bad thnig tothe update old stories
. it ' s done all tghe time infact thte oral tradition
. the dificulty iwth thsi film is nto thyat the tale has changed
, it ' s tyhat it ' s dry
. the new cinderella
, danielle
( drew barrymore
) is nto sitting around waiting for her prince to come
. she ' s a woman ofthe the lite twentieth centruy albeit situated in sixteenth century france
. whn her father dies
, she stays onthe in his house even
though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla
( anjelica huston
)
. she works by day
,
but reads sir thomas moreso by firelight at night
.
although the story isnt updated
, you konw teh plot
. danielle meets prince henry
( dougray scott
)
, goes to a ball disguised
, is later found out
annd tehy live happily ever after
. tghe movei isnt oftenly like watching a filmed play
. theater infront rela life is engrossing
. theather on the screen isnt usualy lifeless
. htere doesn ' t seem to be much going on
. thte camera cant be a star of films
. here it ' s a co
- conspiriator
. danielle ' s convictions are compromised
. a socialist
adn a feminist
, she pretends to be royalty to get her man
. a kind woman
, her lsat ect iin tyhe movei isnt oen of revenge
. the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish
. tjhe fairy godmother stand
- inthe
, leonardo da vinci
( patrick godfrey
) is fun to watch as teh eccentric old man who advises danielle
. huston isnt enjoyable in her over
- the
- top wickedness
. in all fairness
, my companion loved thge film
. maybe it ' s oney ofthe those
" chick ficks
" thyat men don ' t liek
. it is certainly a date film
. nearly the entire audience was couples
. oh well
, mabey it ' s ogod for something
.
