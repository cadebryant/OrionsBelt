. critique
: thsi movei jstu didn ' t scare me one bit
. sure
, it creeped
anbd spooked me out a littel here
anbd there
,
but on tghe wohle
, it took waaaaay too long to git gogin
, provided vrey little meat in tyhe plot
, went way past its own bedtime
,
and basically relied onthe grunts
, the muttering of children ' s voices
anbd over
- the
- top special effects
, to scare us
. well
, this film didn ' t do much for me
.
and tehy might as well have called it the
" haunting ofthe lily taylor
"
, sicne she ' s basically thge onyl character who hadnt any real depth
, background or reason tothe be inwhich tghe house in thge frist palce
. don ' t git me wrong
, catherine zeta was sweet window dressing
( dispite my contined preception of her faint mustache
- see entrapment
)
,
anbd owen wilson ws ogod as the standard
" comic releaf
"
