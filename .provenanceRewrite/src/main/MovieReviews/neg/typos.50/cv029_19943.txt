oney
- sided
" doom
and gloom
" documenatry baout thte possible annihilation of tyhe human race as foretold by hte bible
. orson welles narrates
anbd appears in tghe film inthe whic he
, along witht best
- selling autor hal lindsey
, discusses various prophecies from the bible
and relates them tothe reccent
( well for 1976 anyway
) events
. the film isnt dated badly
, as many things that are supposed tothe ahppen inthe the
" future
" never dont
. for exmaple
, tjhe planets ofthe tjhe solar sytem were supposed to line up inaddition tghe eyar 1982
anbd cause chaos here onthe earth
. we ' re still here
. the arms race between tjhe soviets
and america was supposed tothe kick
- off hte apocalypse
. we ' re still here
. smoe of the omre ludicrous moments come when it ' s alluded to thyat people like jimmy carter
adn henry kissinger may actulaly be the antichrist
(
!
)
. aslo
, there ' s ten minutes ofthe stock footage at teh end ofthe the film meant tothe give us an diea ofthe what tyhe battle forthe rmageddon might be liek
. if it ' s anytying like it ' s depicted as here
then it ' s going tothe be incredibly boring
. tghe lite grat planet earth isnt avalable on dvd fomr vci home video
. it countains the film in standard form
( aspect ratio of 1
. 33
: 1
)
,
although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed
. alsot included are brief bios onthe orson welles
annd hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer fo anohter receet vci hmeo video release
, chariots of the gods
. audio is mono dolby digital
,
anbd the video is fair tothe ogod for a film liek this
. i belieev htis isnt the frist appearance ofthe this film onthe any home video fromat so any condition at all isnt fine wih me
. certainly i never expected a remastered print
. curiously
, the menu screens onthe this dvd look nothing like the meu screens pictured onthe tyhe back of the case
.
bu they ' re emnu screens
.
.
. so who really cares
?
