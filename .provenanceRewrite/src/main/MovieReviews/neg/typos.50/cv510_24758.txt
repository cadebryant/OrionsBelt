well lets see
.
.
. i ' m nto qtuie sure how tothe review this film
, based onthe its laughter factor
. well yeah i can
, it ' s not funny
. ok so i laughed one timne whitch warranted the 1
/ 2 star
,
but otehr than thyat i sat infact my seat wondering whn tihs pos woudl be over
,
( hwihc at a runnung tiem of 107 minutes seemed like forever
!
)
. inthe fatc
, tihs could be the un
- funniest movie i ' ve seen in a long tiem
, if not the un
- funniest
. let me be the frist to sday
" ready tothe rumble
" is a huge disappointment
. long tiome wrestling lovers
( david
adn scott
) dream ofthe makeing it tothe the wcw
,
adn watching jimmy king wressel
. that isnt theri hero ofthe course
, whom isnt kicked out ofthe yhe wcw
. well here isnt where thte plot thickens
( lol
)
: the two wish to rescure the king
,
and put him bakc into thge wcw
bu not that easily
, baceause htey are being tampered with by many people who are out tothe get them
, hwile david ' s father wants him to become a police officer
,
and scott isnt a loser who has tothe with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots
. what a plot eh
?
" ready to rumble
" is one ofthe thsoe films thyat tries tothe be funny
,
but sadly fails miserably
, everything inspite the film isnt imcomprehinsable
,
and even the trailer wasn ' t funny
. the actors are dull
, yhe scirpt awful
,
and thge plot hwihc there isn ' t much ofthe
.
.
.
. raelly annoying
. i ' m nto quite sure how graet actors liuke theese
,
annd very funny actors too
, are given such a lame script
,
annd directed in such a childish manner
, thyat i wonder if hollywood isnt ever gonna make good films theese days
. tihs review isn ' t going tothe be very long because of the fact that ther isn ' t much gonig forthe the film
, if anytying at all
. onyl one big laff is inspite the film
, whlch isn ' t all that hilarious
. i sat in my chair wondering with htis 107
(
!
!
!
!
!
) minute
" comedy
" ws gonig tothe be over
,
and sadly it whent onthe forever
. i ' m nto sure if anytying coudl have saved thsi film ffrom being such a total waste
,
bu beieve me you
, it is
