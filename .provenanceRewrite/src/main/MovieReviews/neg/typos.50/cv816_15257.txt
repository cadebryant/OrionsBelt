it seems liuke i ' m reviewing cheeseball horror movies onthe a monthly basis nowe
. scream revitalized a genre the studios are nowe intent on burying into tje ground again
- thte serial killers infront these new slasher movies have nothing onthe sony
and miramax inspite hte
" relentless
" department
. i still nkow what you doed lsat summer is a terrable film in many respects
,
but inspite hte wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend
, it ' s citizen hook
. jennifer lvoe
- hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james
- who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the lastest movei by
.
.
. waking uv
. she lives in fear of ben willis
, thte vengeful fisherman
- victim ofthe a hitted
anbd run by julie
adn her pals
. paranoid
annd beated
, she accepts a free trip to hte bahamas from her friend karla
( norwood
)
, winner of tghe local radio station ' s 4th ofthe july getaway giveaway
. bikini
- ready julie invites boyfriend ravy
( prinze
, jr
.
)
, who
-
anbd here ' s yhe movie ' s biggest mystery
- turns her down
,
bu changes his mind
annd plans tothe surprise her befor take
- off
. unil he gets a roadside visist from captain hell
- liner himself
, that isnt
. unaware of tihs
anbd feeling shunned
, julie goes onthe vacation
, anyway
, wiht karla
, karla ' s boyfriend
( pfeiffer
)
,
annd iwll
( matthew settle
)
, a rela boy
- enxt
- doorjam tipe who ' s sweet onthe julie
. to mkea a long stopry short
- i cant ' t believe it took a paragraph tothe discribe the setted
- up for htis gratuitious sequel
- the trip is a disaster
. nto onyl isnt it storm season
, nto onyl is teh desk clerk
( the frighteners ' jeffrey combs
) a jerk
, nto onyl are the faw island residents
and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis oen
- by
- one
,
bu yhe karaoke machine isn ' t wroking properly
!
( you think killing isnt hard
? try reprogramming a laserdisc so tath gloria gaynor ' s
" i will survive
" now containes tghe lyric
" i still know what yuo did lastest summer
!
"
) all isnt not lost
- ravy is onthe his way tothe sive the day
,
anbd a helpful witch doctor isnt saying little prayers for julie
anbd co
. thsi picture is really about breasts
: twpo of them
. julie
, like a ogod horror heroine
, never doesnt up her shirt tothe the collar
, always wears white in the rain
,
adn keeps sexy underware onthe inaddition case ofthe a sudden desire to tan
. based on tje hormonal charge i got outloud ofthe the movie
, i can ' t imagin what it ws doign to the ten year old boy who sat next to me
- he gets jennifer lvoe
- hewitt
,
annd my generation got heather langenkamp
! lucky bastard
. i didn ' t liek i nkow what you doed lastest summer
and i can ' t say i liked thsi continuation any moreso or less
. thte pacing in both films is languid
- how isnt it thgat so much tyme passes wtih neither murder nor character devolopement
? i still konw what yuo did lsat summer has a better sense ofthe humour thna thte first oney
,
though
,
annd at least it explains awya willis ' s random selction ofthe victims
.
( i don ' t thiunk the hotel maid or yhe stoner dued hadnt the slightest diea wqat julie doed last summer
.
) directer cannon
( judge dredd
) isnt a competant filmmaker
but not a particularly imaginative one
- if ther is a part threee
( whta onthe earth would they call it
?
)
,
and the funn denouement suggests ther wiull be
, here ' s my suggestion
: hire a filmmaker wiht flair
, somone who cant raelly energize this stillborn series
- somene who won ' t rely on so many shock notes
.
annd let tyhat person run wild with the camera
.
( asside
: if blandy
[ sic
] must apear in the next noe
, try tothe keep tghe number ofthe times she says
" baby
" to a minumum
. thanks in advance
.
