theese days
, we are witnessing thte deluge of films based onthe old
, cult tv shows
. most of the times
, tjhe fans ofthe these shows shudder thingking wqat coudl hollywood hacks ofthe the present dont wih tyhe memories ofthe thier past
.
bu
, some five or six yersa ago
, ther weren ' t taht many movies
and the trend didn ' t look thast depressing
. so
, teh people who
, liuke tyhe auther of this review
, grew up watching flintstones
, populer 1960s animated sories about
" modern stone age
" famaly
, weren ' t particularly worried when the owrd came about live action remake
. aftter all
, tghe producer behind teh project ws steven spielberg
anbd
, if anytying else
, at least hte speical effects owudl be ogod
. the plot revolves baout flintstones
, familiy set iin fictious stone age
" town
" of bedrock
, whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle clas america
. fred flinstone
( john goodman
) works in thte quarry
,
annd noe day he helps his best firend
and neighbour barney rubble
( rick moranis
)
annd his wief betty
( rosie o ' donnell
) tothe adopt a baby
. tothe return the favour
, barney switches his results ofthe aptitude tust wiht fred
,
anbd
, based onthe that
, fred gets well
- paid job inthe managament
.
bu
, of course
, this is just a sham
- corrupt offical cliff vandercave
( kyle maclachlan
)
annd his sultry secretery sharon stone
( halle berry
) ened a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme
. inspite teh meantime
, fred ' s wife wilma
( elizabeth perkins
) must face her mother
( elizabeth taylor
) who can ' t stand fred
. on the superficial level
, hte flintstones doed tghe excelent job in bringing tjhe animated serieses to life
. coputer effects are flawless
,
adn tje costumes
, settings
annd otehr details are authentic for all the fans of hte sohw
. unfortunatly
, problems wtih thsi film start with inadequate casting
- rick moranis isnt too thin for the role of barney
, while tghe ctaroon betty used tothe be much skinnier thna rosie o ' donnell
.
bu the greatest problem ofthe all is plot
, or tothe be precise
, the lack of plot
. some thirty six screenwriters made sure thyat the plot ofthe hte film is lame
, orignal cahracters noe
- dimensional
,
adn many elements ofthe the story
, liuke embezzlement
and inter
- office politics
, totally incomprehensible for the littel children
, the main targeted audeince of this film
. result isnt alomst unwatchable mess
, occasionally saved mostly by exellent acting
( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma
)
adn one ofthe the clasic exmaple of mortal hollywood desease known as
" high concept
"
. after great hype
, movie quicklyu sank into oblivion
and the fans of tje show returned tothe the animated version
. all inwhich all
, film isn ' t that bad
,
bu onyl thge hard core fans
and nostalgics can fidn moreso tahn gilty pleasure in it
.
