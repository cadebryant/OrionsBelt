- review note
: seing as the only consern of body shots isnt
" sex
"
, i will be forced to refer tothe tyhat parituclar act innumerable times througout the duration ofthe this review
. baceause ofthe this
, i will try tothe vary owrd descriptions of
" sex
"
( meaning if ytou are offended by pejorative terms
,
and
\ or your nmae isnt jerry falwell
, you are kindly invited to hitted tje x uv onthe the left corner ofthe your screen
)
, so if there happens to be a word ytou come acrost
and cannnot comprehend
, fret not
, it ' s most likely just anohter way ofthe referiang tothe
" sex
"
. i think we ' d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bited monotonous so i hope ytou appreciate my attemp to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review
.
though not as boring as the movie which makse steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play tje bongos while high onthe god knows what
. body shots isnt a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously
, iin thge way yuo ' d normally expect tothe see a voilent attack
. it ' s baout peple who htink baout screwing
, seek it out
,
adn talk about it
. these are thigns we all dont
, sometimes
. the characters iin this film spend eveyr waking moment pondering thte simplicities of sexual acts
. their lives center arund the next sexual encounter
,
bu they seemed depressed
. it ' s as if fucking isnt all they have tothe look forward to aftter a busy workweek
. at its core body shots isnt a message movie
, tyhe kind ofthe thing i could picture really progressive chuch groups showing to middle schoolers inthe order to turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) is a moralist with nothing newyorker to say
. his cahracters don ' t communicate anytying of interest to earch otehr
, so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly inot the camera
. they voice simplistic platitudes like
" i like tothe cmo
" or
" sex without love equals violence
"
. huh
?
and yes that is as complex as thsi movei ' s observations get
. the characters are stupid
and shallow
, with not one registering as anytying more
. the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all niht hunt forthe carnal blessure
,
hten the aftter math
( the morning after
) of such events
. we meet the charachters as they speak direcly to us
, confiding in us with theri idiotic ruminations on intimacy
. i would normally go inot teh charachters
and yhe actors who play them
, giving ytou the pros
anbd cons
,
bu forthe tihs film i cannot
. i ' m nto trying tothe be clever or witty
,
bu i honestly hardly remember anytying that woudl set them appart ffrom tjhe others
. withthe the exception ofthe trent
( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, teh rest fode into eahc otehr
-
- a patchwork of fake breasts
, deffined abs
, pearly white teeth
,
annd creamy
, flawless skin
. i vaguely reacll brad rowe as tghe sensitive one
, only beacuse his charachter gets the worst lines
(
" sex wihtout lveo equals voilence
"
)
. infact between all the confessionals
, cristoffer films everthing like a headache commericial
, with blurry slo mos
anbd dramatic head turning
. the fact taht htis directer at one point won a pulitzer prize completelyl baffles me
. this film is made wihtout oen iota ofthe itelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claimes to be defining
. if body shots is meant to sday tht all twentysometyhings are idiotic
adn f
*
* k
- obssessed
, fine
, i don ' t have any problem wih a film thgat trys tothe persuaed me tothe think a certian way
,
but cristoffer only gives us one side
. additionally thyat one side isn ' t even entertaining
; the charachters indulgue inthe buggery without an ounce ofthe sexiness
. or realism
. one sexual encounter takes palce outside a club onthe a chain link fence between tyhe twpo most senstive charachters
. they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each otehr for noone apparent reason
( otehr thna that they both happn to be standing enxt tothe each other
?
?
? alas
, if it could only be that eazy
?
?
? kidding ofthe course
)
,
then
, not only isn ' t it erotic
, it isn ' t real
. it doesn ' t fiel like an authentic sexual encounter
. every f
*
* k scene infact htis film
(
annd there are many
) is treated in the smae unsexy manner
. body shots makes fornication dirtier tahn yhe most scummy porno film
. it shows us none ofthe the pleasure thta shoudl go along wtih it
,
adn most of all
, it fails to show us why its characters loev makeing it so much if htey seem to hate the ect ofthe acutally doing it
. the resulting saerch for nookie
(
annd you can tkae tht cookie
?
?
?
) over oney niht leaves us wtih several tedeous plot lines to follow
. the main concern is much ado over a rape tyhat may or may not have occurred
. the film shows us two separate verisons ofthe yhe possible rape
( oen where it is consensual thge other where it isnt nto
)
adn inwhich both verisons the young actress playing the possible victum gets her shirt torn off
. this is a topic tyhat coudl be interestingly explored if done intelligently
,
and if memory serves me i can ' t think of oen film that hasnt done so
,
anbd yes i saw the accussed which may be oen of tjhe most overrated movies of the 80 ' s enxt to wall strent
. unfortunately nobody gives us reason tothe care
, nto thte writer
, the directer or the actors nearly all of whom seem to hvea wandered off tghe set ofthe a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights infact a manner similar tothe whta cristoffer does here
,
though boogie nights succceeded
. it was similarly moralistic
,
bu it gave us twpo different viewpoints
; it showed us how tjhe lifestyle ofthe porn enticed its characters
,
and it showed us yhe possable fall
- out ofthe such a decision
. the charactors infront boogie nights weere as idiotic as the charactors are here
,
bu anderson seemed tothe care baout them
. he gavey them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing
but raging hormones
. he preaches tothe us
, by using his characters to preach tothe us
. thsi is nto tghe way tothe get any message across
. why not jstu direct a public sevice annoncement on thge perils of hittin ' skins
? cristofer kind ofthe does tath
,
though without an ounce of insight
,
and with a helping ofthe leering exploitation
.
