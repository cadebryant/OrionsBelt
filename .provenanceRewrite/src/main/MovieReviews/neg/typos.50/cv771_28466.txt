. critique
: angelina jolie was great in htis movie
. there weere also about threee
" acation scenes
" that were pretty cool tothe look at inspite tihs film
. uhhhhhm
, unfortunately the rest of tje movei sucked
! bad dialogue
, generic sidekicks
and bad guys
, a lame mistery
, yoda
- esque moments iwth mumbo
- jumbo being sprouted about
adn even some crappy cgi near the end
. all in all
, htis movie wasn ' t tjhe horror show that smoe ofthe the eearly reviews had warned us baout
, especialy since every other scene does feature jolie ' s torpedoes beggin tothe burst out ofthe her lucky shirts
,
bu it ws quite thge letdown nontheless
, especially whn you consdider tjhe major opportunity thyat tghe filmmakers hadnt here tothe create a cool
, hip woman hero
, based on a popular video gae
. i don ' t know
, i guess ytou haev tothe put most of tyhe blame on directer simon west
, who didn ' t raelly tie the hwole movie toghether all that well
. the film lacked energy
, a consistent pace
and well
.
.
. a fun time
! i falt kinda depressed while watching htis movie
. all that
" father
" crap was horrible
adn the dialogue given tothe poor john voight tothe recite ws jsut plain embarassing
(
and i ' m not even gonna mention his moustache
.
.
. hehehe
)
. why have this shite in tghe movei at all
?
!
? i expecially hated tyhe scenes iin which some ghost
- liuke figure
, firend or child owudl ramble onthe about lara croft ' s father hwile all the time
, i ' m nto giving oen ounce ofthe crap as tothe what they ' re talking baout
. i guess thast ' s called lack ofthe
" character development
"
, right
? that ' s when a movei builds anough background inot the characters on the screen
, so that we coudl actualy
" git inot
" it
and care baout them
. i didn ' t care about anyone in this movei
,
adn ws borde druing most of its
" let ' s explain why we ' re doing all htis gobbledygook
" moments
.
and even
though i thought taht jolie kicked some mighty ass
( damn
, did she look sexy blasting thsoe guns or what
?
!
?
)
, everybody else aroud her ws so goddamn boring
! her butler was a throwaway with noone personality
, her side
- kick was suppoed to be funny
bu just anoyed me every tiome he said the owrd
" bugger
"
(
annd he syas it a lot
, trust me
!
)
adn all ofthe tghe so
- called bad guys just spewed one
- dimention
! they had no spark
, no energy amoungst them
,
and even
though a fewd ofthe the action scenes in the movei were kool
( see yhe trailer
and yuo ' ll nkow which ones i ' m tlaking baout
)
, tje overall picture was lame
anbd tjhe dialogue
and mystical bull
- crap jstu burried it even furuther
. aslo
, fo a movei that ' s supposted to be about all of theese exotic locations
, i wasn ' t necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots
,
and even less so with its interiors
, which all looked like tehy weere shooted infront the same room
. mind yuo
, i won ' t go as far as tothe sday thta it ' s tje
" worst movie ofthe thte year
"
( remember tht i actually have tothe go see freddie prinze jr
. movies also
!
)
,
bu it ' s definitely teh worst film that i ' ve seen durig this summer movei season
( of course
, it ' s still early
anbd i ' m sure htere are a few mroe garbage heaps comming down tje pike
)
. skip tihs noe alltogether
anbd rent any of yhe indiana jones movies instead
.
.
. trust me
, yuo ' ll miss teh boobs
bu end your night iwth some rock
- solid porn
and it ' s all good
