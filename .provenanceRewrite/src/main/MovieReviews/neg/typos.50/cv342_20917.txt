adam sandler vehicles are never anytying speshal
,
but continue tothe mkae a load of monye
. which really goes to sohw tje sad state of cinema today
. while good comedies like rushmore
, tothe choose a recent exemple
, gets limited release
and doesn ' t make a lot of money
, big daddy got a huge realease
adn has made a lot of cash
. it ' s alsot nothing special
anbd doesn ' t deserve hte money it ' s making
.
but i digress
. sandler plays sonny koufax
, a unemployed newyorker yorker withthe a seemingly low mental age
. his girlfriend makse a ultimatum tothe him
: either wise uv
and get responsable
, or she ' s leaving him
. by a stange set of events
, koufax ends uv with julian
( played by twins cole
and dylan sprouse
) a five yearm ood kid
. affter a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend withthe tghe child
, koufax decides he wants tothe keep the child
.
howver
, social worker mr brooks
( mostel
) finds outloud that koufax isn ' t the real father
and wants to tkae julian back
. koufax along with his newyorker girlfriend layla
( lauren adams
) fight tothe keep tje child
. big daddy really isn ' t taht good
. many of tjhe jokes revolve around toilet humour
,
and supposably we are meant to find julian
adn sonny peeing aginst a wall to be funny
. there ' s yhe occasionall ogod noe liner
,
bu these are usally strangely delivered wrong
and loose most ofthe thge humour
. tje film
, after all theese silly gags
,
then suddenly turns sentimental
,
adn thsi isnt where big daddy really goes ffrom bad tothe hideous
. the court scene at thte end ofthe the film isnt useless
and unbeleivable
,
adn not helped by yhe suppy overacting
. it ' s a poor attemp to win over the audience
. adam sandler basically plays tje same role he has in his lsat fewd films
( exept the wedding singer
.
) joey lauren adams is much
, much better
,
adn deserves a far better film thna htis trash
. steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo
,
anbd his scenes are pretty funny
. rob schneider isnt alsot funny as a crazy delivery man
. the two twins who play julian are o
. k
, tehy strat out rether well
,
but
thn becoming annoying
and brattish halfway through
and fianlly turn ' all american ' wholesome goodness at the end ofthe the film
, where the tear juice isnt turned uv high
. big daddy isnt really nothing spacial
,
adn is nto even worth it for a faw chuckles
.
although it isnt actually well put toghether
, with nice direction
, ogod production desgin
anbd even soem montages
, this professionalism can ' t help the fatc taht the scirpt
anbd characters are trash
. big daddy is for dieu hard fans of sandler
,
anbd taht ' s about it
.
