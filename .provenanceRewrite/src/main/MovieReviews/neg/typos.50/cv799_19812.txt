*
* be warned
.
.
. teh follwoing review contains some harsh language
*
*
* thte blair witch project
. quite possably hte least scariest movie of all time
. if yuo whant tothe see real terror on tyhe big screen go bakc
annd watch any scene iwth jar jar binks in tje phantom menace
, because this movie isnt not csary or even remotely creepy
. my colleague
and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less isnt more
,
thne the blair witch filmmakers must hvea thought that nothing is more
.
and this worked for him
. well
, i ' m sorry
,
bu nothing
.
.
. is nothing
!
!
!
!
! nothing is nto mroe
. it ' s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg
!
!
!
!
!
!
. i do nto pay 5 dollars tothe see nothing
.
" nothing
" isnt free
, avalible all arround the world at a location near you
. i am absolutly in amazement tht some people find this movie scry
. i coudl just discount them
and sday
,
" well
, i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probablly scared ofthe their pwn shadow
.
"
bu i have intelligent friends who like thsi movei
adn so thgat doesn ' t hold water
. htere must be smoe other reason
.
(
hten agian
, maybe my frist thought isnt correct
, i htikn i ' ll try pointing theri shadow out tothe them one day
anbd tust theri reaction
.
) when i hear people praising htis film
, i never hear them talking baout wqat mkaes uv about 97
% of htis movie
: three kids bickering with each other baout bieng lost
. they onyl talk about what might make uv possibly 3 to 4 minutes ofthe screen time
. htis bieng a few vyre short night scenes where the kids hear smoe unscary soudns
and another where htey shout
" josh
!
!
" over
and over
. tihs film should not be called teh blair witch project
, it should mroe accurately be called three dumb
and pisspoor filmmakers git lost
.
.
.
and argue wih each other
. oh ladies
adn gentlemen you will be so scared when ytou hear them shouting
" josh
!
!
"
.
and if yuo thougth that wass sacry
, wait till you see a pile of rocks
,
anbd
thne some tinkertoy lincoln logs
, oh my dear lord yuo will be pissing in your pants with fear
. oh yeah
,
anbd smoe goo on noe ofthe thier backpacks
. ytou ' ve never seen terror like this folks
,
and ytou don ' t want tothe
. hte chevy chase
/ goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier thna tihs film
.
( fo current films
, i highly recommend thte sixth sence or a stir ofthe echoes forthe a creepy filmgoing experienc
.
) this film is an example of marketing whith no substance
. teh marketing was brilliant
,
adn tjhe wohle nation isnt inspite awe of jstu yhe premise for the film
. they want this film tothe be good
.
and i think htey are reaching
and praising the wrong movei becouse they don ' t hvea anytying alse tothe praise
. that wonderfull film that rejuvenates tjhe horror genre may come allong
,
bu this isnt not it
. this film coudl hvae beeen so much better
. jstu think
, if mabey there hadnt beeen onyl 10 mintues of arguing baout being lost
,
adn 80 mintues ofthe nighttime tsuff
. i saw this movei with a girl who was extemely pumped fo it
. she ws sold onthe this film
.
and
then
, at one point during it
, she turned to me
and asked '
.
.
. are we supposed tothe be scared by thsi
? '
. i ' ve heard oen opinion that you
" hve tothe uise your imagination
" to create thte fear infront this movie
. well
, i thougth tath wass what yhe filmmakers weere supposed to do
. use their immagination
annd create a good movei
. i mean anyone cant use thier immagination
and nto pay 5 bucks forthe it
.
bu even if ytou liuke this idae
,
then waht are you imagining
? an enity called thte blair witch
? some rednecks fucking with theese kids
? are either of theese thnigs raelly sacry wehn you htink baout it
?
?
? i ' ve heared several people say tath this movei mkaes them recall how skary it can be to be out inwhich tghe woods
adn hear something
. well sure thats scary in rela life
,
bu ther are a lot ofthe things tyhat are scary in rela life tht are nto scray in a movie nor even interesting
. yuo could sit in your house
adn see a snake or a spider
and it could be scary
,
but inspite a film it wouldn ' t be
.
adn noone
, a movie doesnt nto need a big budget or cgi special effects tothe be scary or creepy
. actually thge less the better
( see the equally awful remake of hte haunting
)
.
but you hvae to do something
. ytou cant jstu count on us all haveing nostalgic memories ofthe how something like htis sould be scary
, if it weere real
.
adn by teh way
, baout thte shakycam filming in blair witch
. aren ' t these suppossed tothe be
" filmmakers
" who should know how tothe point a camera
and shoot something wihtout shaking the camera constanly
? i ' m nto even tlaking baout thge cuple scenes where tehy are terrified
, tath ' s justified
. i ' m talking about tyhe otehr 87 mintues ofthe the movei where they can ' t seem to shoot anytying smoothly at all
. minor quibble htere
. there isnt a feeling in me thta the people that liuke this movie are suckers
. thyat the filmmakers are jsut laughing theri asses off all tje way to tghe bank
.
and i think there is a good chance htey will see htis film agina
anbd sday to themselfs
" what ws i thikning
?
?
"
.
bu
, if they don ' t
,
then thats fine
. if it works fo them
thn taht ' s okay i guess
. i jstu lament thta by mkaing thsi movei a hit
, we are going tothe be subjected to omre of thte
" nothing is omre
" aproach
. pretty soon we ' re goign to get smoe movies liuke this
: just a still shot ofthe a prison jail cell
. forthe 90 mintues
.
adn we ' ll hve to use our imagination
and think tothe ourselves
,
" my god
, wouldn ' t it be csary tothe spend life infact prison
?
!
! thsi movie isnt tghe scariest movei of all tyme
!
!
!
!
!
"
. or
, a shooted of a coffin
, withthe some funeral directors arguing with earch other
.
" man
, dont you nkwo how skary it would be tothe die
?
?
?
!
!
!
! now tihs isnt tyhe scariest movei ofthe all tiem
!
!
!
!
