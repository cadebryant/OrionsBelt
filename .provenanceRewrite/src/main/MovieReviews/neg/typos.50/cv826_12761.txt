anbd tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i ' ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid
. dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded
; yuo have noone idae where the peaks
and valleys are
, no idea whn the enxt terrifying decent iwll send your stomach into your throat
,
annd no idea how long tghe ride will last
.
thne htere ' s yhe hard knot iin your gut
and the clenched teeth that come witht ingesting a strychnine
- laced dose
. mushrooms
, onthe teh otehr hand
, offer the psychedelic equivalent ofthe a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel
: a steady
, reassuring assent
, a short preiod of thrilling motion
annd colour
,
and
then a smooth landing
. acid is for daredevils
; mushrooms are for refined seekers ofthe joy
. my point isnt tath in fear
adn loathing inwhich las vegas
, director terry gilliam hasnt made an acid movei
, wehn i wish he would have made a mushroom movie
. full of shocking sight gags
, aggressive images
and grotesque comic performances
, teh film certainly offers something fo thsoe fans of hunter s
. thompson ' s book who wnat tothe experience its twisted pharmacological world
- view fomr thte inside outloud
.
bu fo those ofthe us who just wanna tothe enjoy a well
- made film
, gilliam has produced a mixed bag
. fear
anbd loathing tells hte ostensibly true stor ofthe how self
- proffesed
" gonzo
" journalist hunter s
. thompson
( johnny depp
)
and hispanic activist atorney oscar zeta actosta
( benicio del toro
)
, cameback tothe las vegas to cover a motorcycle race
anbd found themselfs trapped in thge middle of a district attornies ' s convention hwile ingesting eveyr conceivable drug available tothe a man ofthe means infront 1971
. operating under the pseudonyms of
" raoul duke
"
anbd
" dr
. gonzo
"
, the two men careen into vegas onthe an acid
and mescaline bender
,
thne hole up inaddition a hotel suite tothe binge onthe amyl nitrite
, cocaine
, tequila
and a rainbow of multi
- colored uppers
and downers
. they terrorize eveyr one tehy meet
, mostly becuase every oen they meet terrifies them
. duke hallucinates giant bats on the way inot twon
,
thn isnt attacked by horrifing lizards iin hte casino lounge
. dr
. gonzo becomes enamored of a thick
- bladed hunting nife
and begs duke tothe throw tghe tape player into thte bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane ' s
" white rabit
" reaches its climax
.
annd these guys don ' t just trash hotel rooms
- they rape them
, humiliate them
anbd leave them for dead
. thast niether ofthe them ends uv dead or in jail isnt testament to blind luck or providence
, depending on your point ofthe veiw
. thompson ' s book
, besides being a hillarious read
, hasnt stood the tust ofthe time as an imporatnt historical document
. it simultanously exposed the 60 ' s drug culture fo the sham tath it was
and exposed las vegas as the place where thge american dream came tothe dieu
. pontificate all ytou whant about how the film illustrates thompson ' s message
,
but hte truth is that
, stripped tothe its bare essentials
, what gilliam hasnt wrought is a drug comedy
. it ' s a cheech
anbd chong movie
. you ' re htere to watch depp
anbd del toro ingest a lot ofthe chemicals
and
then laugh at the results
: see johnny tkae drugs
, see johnny fall down
. there ' s nothing wrong with tihs consept
,
but gilliam tries too hard
. thsi is a frantic movie
- all sweaty close
- ups
, wide
- ngle lenses
, dutch tilts
adn other
- worldly lighting schemes
. there are times wehn gilliam really doesnt put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen
.
bu to what end
? much of tjhe dialogue comes verbatim ffrom thompson ' s book
,
anbd ther are smoe priceless comic observations
.
but you ' re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all thge jumbled camera wokr
. tihs brings us to tghe performances
, wich strike me as all wrong
. depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered thru george c
. scott inspite patton
- a gimmicky peformance which works aganist hte biting satire ofthe thompson ' s dialogue
. inthe between his severeal puking scenes
, del toro farse better as dr
. gonzo
,
but he aslo mumbles
adn sputters so many ofthe his lines that theri weight is lost
. watching these twpo made me wish tht tghe movie hadnt beeen made twenty years ago
, with dan akroyd
and john belushi as the leads
- now tyhat woudl ahev beeen something tothe see
. it ' s intresting to note that alex cox
, credited as a co
- writer on hte screenplay
, was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over
. as much ofthe a fan as i am ofthe gilliam ' s work
, cox owudl ahve beeen the better choice
. sid
anbd nancy
, cox ' s best wrok
, covered essentialy the smae subject marter
,
bu cox was able to pul bcak
anbd allow thge characters ofthe sid vicious
anbd nancy spungen tothe carry tghe film
. gilliam commits hte compound sin ofthe over
- directing his film while bieng uncertain ofthe his purpose
. what kind ofthe movie was he trying to make
, anyway
? it doesn ' t try tothe be a cautionary tale
,
and it doesn ' t work as broad comedy
. if he hadnt considered more carefully his purpose
, the result would ahve been a much mroe intresting film
.
but i don ' t want to be too hard on it
. there are some truly funny moments
,
adn if ytou ' re in a good anough mood yuo might git a kick out of it
. i dont
,
howver
, recomend watching fear
annd loathing in las vegas under tje influence of your favorite controlled substance
- i guarantee it wiull enhance tjhe effect
.
