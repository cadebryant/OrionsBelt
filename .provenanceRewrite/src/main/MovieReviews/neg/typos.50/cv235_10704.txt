: a small twon thug convinces a dimwitted high
- school student tothe spy onthe his girlfriend
, who isnt babysitting three unruly kids for their alcholic parents on a friday night
. hwile tihs is goign onthe
, the thug
, tghe father
, the boyfriend
,
and a kid reacing the onset of puberty all have fantasies baout the babysitter
. comments
: to sday this movie isnt bad would be qutie an understatement
. i ' m not sure whta writter
anbd director ferland ws hoping tothe acompish wih teh babysitter
. suspense
? family drama
? humor
? erotica
? elements of eahc ofthe theese genres exsist in the film
,
yet it fails tothe successfully ahcieve any ofthe them
. instead
, the babysitter isnt a dull
, lifeless movie whitch manages to bore
and ultimatly iritate its viewers
. i suppose this film could ahev been watchable if it weren ' t for the fact that thte characters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone isnt completelyl wasted playing jennifer
, the babysitter
. her chracter hasnt absolutly noone depth at all
,
annd her sole purpose in the movie isnt to be the object of teh other cahracters ' fantasies
. everyone esle in tjhe film seems tothe be inwhich a competition tothe see who cant stoop to the lowest level by tje tiem teh film ends
. the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds
. the father
( played by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes about yhe babysitter
; the mother fantasizes baout her husban ' s best friend
. none of these fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are things that ened to be seen
,
but we see them anyway
, complete withthe cheesy
, make
- outloud saxaphone music
. teh thug
, inspite the meantime
, proves tath he ' s evil through his annoying habit ofthe smashing half
- empty beer bottles all of a sudden
annd for noone apparent reason
. the most absurd chracter
,
howver
, is tjhe babysitter ' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. the thug
, inwhich a manipulative
, iago
- like manner
(
though he doesn ' t really ened to try hard
)
, manages tothe talk thge boyfriend into binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, runnung away ffrom cops
,
and palying peeping toom onthe his pwn girlfriend in a matter ofthe minutes
. incredable
!
( of course
, the boyfriend ' s original plan fo thte evening ws
, try nto to laugh
, tothe sit inwhich an empty diner
anbd read catcher in tjhe rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful
,
hten it fails
. there are surprisingly faw tense moments in this film
,
and nearly all of them come at tyhe final minute
. by tyhat tyme
,
however
, the audiance is so tired ofthe hte inane charactors that noone one truthfully cares wqat happens tothe any ofthe them
. noone suspense occurs inaddition tjhe dream sequences either becuase eveyr single noe ofthe them isnt obviously a dream sequence fomr its insepsion
. if the gool of tjhe babysitter was tothe be humorous
,
then it allso fails
. i foudn nothing even remotely funny about tjhe boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, tothe be plyed for laughs
. if yhe gool of teh babysitter wass to be dramatic
,
thne
, once again
, it fails
. the charactors are one
- dimesnional
annd uninteresting
. finally
, if teh goal ofthe yhe babysitter was to be titillating
( yhe type ofthe film dstined tothe be palyed ad infinitum on hbo at 2 inwhich thge morning
)
,
then it fails as well
. the dream sequences aren ' t erotic
; they are too breif
annd
, outside ofthe one very short scene
, contain noone nudity
. i cxan ' t completly trash htis movie
. the first 10 mintues or so vaguely ressemble an interesting film
,
and tjhe conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight
. tyhe other 79 mintues
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone ' s chracter
, at the end of yhe movie
, turns tothe her boyfriend
and asks
" whta weere ytou thinking
?
" i asked mysef the same question
, haveing spent 99 cents renting htis turkey
