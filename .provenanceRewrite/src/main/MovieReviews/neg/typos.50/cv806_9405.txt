infact 1989
, tim burton took tghe legendary comic book figure ofthe batman
annd turned him inot a huge box office hitted wih an atmospheric littel film tyhat creaeted an utterly distict feeling somwhere between film noir
adn tyhe godfather
. ws it
" deepo
"
? nope
.
howver it ws a perfect enteratinment
adn tjhe audience ate it uv
. it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writting taht it ws
" without the comic book uplift
" of tghe indiana jones
and superman pictures
. whitch ws true
. if what ytou were looking fo ws the tale of a heroic man ' s escadapes
and adventures you were looking inspite thge wrong place
. if those films were toom sawyer
,
then batman was huckleberry finn
. some critics
( glenn lovell ofthe tje san jose mercury news
anbd peter travers ofthe rolling stone
) realized that it ws something special
; mr
. lovell gave it
*
*
* 1
/ 2
and wroet that
" this is batman as batman should be
.
"
; mr
. travers called it oen of the ten best films of the year
. the praise ws deserved
- from start tothe finish tghe film wass enthralling
, exicting
,
anbd superb in eveyr respect
. there was no dout thyat there owudl be a sequel directed by burton
. the result wass batman returns whlch forgets thyat it whants tothe be funn within tjhe first five mintues
. the villains
( the hideous penguin
adn seductive catwoman
) tkae over
,
and our epectations are always left unfulfilled
- when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman ' s nose he simply gets mad
,
and whn we wanna catwoman to slither over batman ' s body she gets pushed off a building
. i admire mr
. burton for trying to do more
hten entertain
,
but teh result is a mess
. nothing works outloud as planned
- it fails both tothe entertain
adn to enlighten
. hints are made tothe the audiance that this film coudl be a blast
. alas
, theese are onyl hints
. there are
, don ' t misunderstand me
, severeal moments ofthe cinematic genuis contained
; catwoman
anbd batman understand eachother perfectly without a word onthe yhe subject bieng said
; christopher lloyd is trapped
, by the penguin
, withing a giant cage
; a small basket is dropped inot a larg river
;
bu nothing is drawed toghether
adn burton isnt unable to make yhe film work onthe any regular basis
. a weak followup
, both career
anbd sequal wise
, batman returns isnt sometimes dazzling
,
bu to often dissapointing
.
