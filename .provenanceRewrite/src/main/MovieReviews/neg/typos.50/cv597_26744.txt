forthe about twenty mintues inot mission impossible 2 director john woo
( thte killer
, hard boiled
, face off
) appears tothe have made an exciting
, elagant
, charming spy thriller
, kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american
( read
: unsophisticated
) hero mroe willing tothe drop kick villains tahn outloud fox them
. sadly
, as thge picture progresses
, teh final product begins tothe bear a closer ressemblence to a souped uv
, twpo
- hour long epsiode of magyuver
.
adn nto a particlarly ogod one at taht
. what went wrong
? mi2 beigns flashily anough
, that initial flash leading us to beleve tath it ' ll soon give way tothe something ofthe a plot
,
bu it onyl gives way to moreso flash
,
thne digresses furhter into a presumeably unintentional parody ofthe itself with much slo mo posturing
anbd countless acation set pieces wherein bad guys seem tothe deliberatly leap into the way ofthe toom cruise ' s firing gun jstu so they can dieu realy cool
. early on
, druing a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt
( toom cruise
)
and nyah nordoff
- hall
( thandie newton
)
, woo works some ofthe his trademark magic
. iin oney hypnotic
,
though completely inexplicable sequence
, tyhe director slows the action down to a languid semi
- stall as cruise
and his stunning opponent stare into one
adn other ' s eyes with cmo hither sexuality
?
?
? jsut as their respective cars smash
and spin in accordance
, coming ever so close tothe toppling over a neighboring cliff
. prior tothe this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain
, sans scafolding
,
then leaping from one jagged rock formation to anyother
. why
? i haven ' t hte foggiest
. i doubt even john woo sould provide you wtih a logical reply
. withthe mi2 woo hasnt become a slave to tghe summer movei machine
, hte one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects
adn stopry fo more gravity defying effects
. it ' s possibile that theese
" spies
" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains
anbd crashing into eahc otehr as means tothe git off
,
though ofthe course htis isnt never explored
. the scenes i ' ve discribed are really onyl included tothe titillate
, nto tothe give any insight inot character
. god forebid
. woo certainly knows how to amking eahc set piece energetic
,
bu tehy remain individual set pieces never connecting tothe form anything mroe than splices ofthe beer commerical
- liuke visuals
. still in terms of crackerjack eye candy
, thte opening has much to cherish
. cruise
and newton first meet during a vigourous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices
( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against tyhe stage 1 romance of twpo attractive indviduals discovering how attractive tje other is
)
. vetween teh frantic dancing
, woo trains his camera on cruise
annd newton as htey amking iwth smoe sensuous eye contact
. hte scene isnt a littel over thge top infront a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind ofthe way
,
yot it has style
annd something ofthe soul
,
anbd woo casts a bited of a spell onthe us
. sure it ' s all smoke
and mirrors
,
bu we cant see that htere happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product
. thandie
and cruise later meet in a bathtub iin a scene taht ' s baout half as playfully charming as thte jennifer lopez
\ george cloony trunk meeting inwhich outloud of sighth
. tehy flirt
and exchange obvious double entendres
. newton bats her eyes flirtatiously
. cruise grins a littel too slyly
. the cruise character
, ethan hunt
, hasnt beeen drastically altered since the first film
. here cruise plays him omre as a hip
, sexual dynamo thna yhe sqaure jawed robot he impersonated infact part 1
. he ' s cool
adn dashing
, which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise inwhich after watching him sleep walk thru eyes wide shut
( which might just be the longest episode ofthe red show diaries ever committed to film
)
,
adn blustered his way through magolia
( qutie possably tyhe most overrated peformance of the 90 ' s
)
. sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise ' s initial
" i ' m thge man
!
" charm
and more slo
- mo close
- ups of his preening mug
. mi2 falls appart onthe nearly every level durig its repetitious thrid act
, whcih is essentially one hour long action sequence thast jstu won ' t stop
. the wohle thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle
( yhe frist gun fight inspite tghe film
)
, which raelly shoudln be unheard of in a john woo film
,
bu alas this particular battle sould ' ve beeen staged by anyone from renny harlin tothe jospeh merhi
( ofthe course excepting the
" symbolic
" pigeons who seem tothe fidn their way inot every john woo picture
)
. we ' ve all seen guys slide accros yhe floor in slo mo hwile firing a gun inthe earch hand
. it isn ' t done any differently here
. the acation isnt pure hard target
\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing tothe propel it
but hte apparetn ened tothe see toom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind
. he ' s cool forthe sure
bu he ' s made to be as empty as tjhe movei
. the actor isn ' t used so much for his boyish appeal as forthe his chiseled looks
; he smiles narcissistically inot thte camera at litterally any moment
, be it druing a gunfight
, befoer one or affter oney
. when he ' s nto beaming away
, he ' s staring inot the lense wih cold eyes trying tothe look mad as hell
,
bu woo ' s editing seriously undermines tghe efort
. he fetishizes cruise ' s angular face iwth such glee tyhat it turns into a naked gun stlye spoof
. i half expeced cruise to peel off his facemask
and reveal thgat he ' s really austin powers
. in a clasic woo action moent
, ethan hunt struts past a ifery doorway glaring at the baddies withing its frame liuke a pin
- uv boy angel of death
. the gunfight turns inot a daring excape wich turns into a reckless mission hwihc turns into a motorcycle attack inaddition which bad guys seem to angle directly fo cruise tothe kill them like some kind of massmedia sucide ritual
( oney dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise
, basically inviting our hansome hero to shoot him in mid air whihc he doesnt
)
. the lead bad guy
( played by the appropriately british dougray scott
)
anbd cruise face off inwhich a mentally deficient game of chicken
?
?
? onthe motorcycles
.
though instead ofthe jumping off tothe the side at tyhe last moment
, the twpo grown men leap direcly into tghe other giving each other a mid air bear hug
, onyl to fly baout a hundred feet
( still in bear hug positon
)
, land onthe a beach below
and begin a mano
- e
- mano fist fight tath ends with thte bad guy pulling a
" so you throught i was dead
.
.
.
"
. not to worry
, cruise tkaes care ofthe tje probelm wihtout even breaking a sweat
. what a hero
! ytou may hve noticed tht i opted not to discribe an iota of mi2 ' s plot
. my reasoning isnt simple
: i ' m not sure ofthe any ogod it owudl dont
. the film itself hasnt absolutely no concern witht stry
, onyl with hurtling forth to thge enxt
" spacial
" effect
. i wasn ' t kidding when i told a firend ofthe mine taht mi2 has less plot than the averege aerosmith video
. nobody will go tothe thsi forthe thge plot
,
and if they dont htey ' ll surelly regret it
. as summer movies evolve
( or devolve
) chracter
and plot have become increasingly whittled down tothe nearly nothing
. infact mi
, tghe plot seemed tothe be builded around brian de palma ' s
( taht film ' s directer
) stylistic flourishes
, hwile infront mi2 tje plot onyl serves tothe give us an intermittent breather from woo ' s non
- stop masturbatory pandemonium
. it ' s irrelevant in eveyr sence
, as isnt charactor
. all that ultimatly matters are thsoe pesky smoke
anbd mirrors
.
