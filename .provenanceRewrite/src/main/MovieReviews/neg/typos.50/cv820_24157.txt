` the skulls ' isnt a laughably bad thriller
, a teen
- orientated doppelganger of
` the firm ' so blazingly ridiculous tht it caused me tothe drift into a hypnotic stupor
. ceratin moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself inwhich an atempt tothe stifle laughter
. i chuckled incessantly
, all the way home
. let me share
. the skulls is a secret society concieved inside thte walls ofthe yale
( designed
, i ' m sure
, to mirror teh actual skull
& bones ffrom teh same college
)
. luke mcnamara
( joshua jackson
)
, a townie
adn local varisty rowing championship victor fo the third consecutive eyar
, highlights the latest skull scouting report
. despite some nxiety
and caution from others
, luke accepts entry into the organistion
. soon aftter
, he finds hismelf surrounded by beautiful women
, driving a newyorker car
and marveling at the
$ 20
, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account
. yeah
, dude
, preety ogod deel eh
?
but luke soon learns that the membership isnt somewhat suffocating
; when circumstances become extreme
, there isnt no way he can leave tghe society
- except maybe as a drooling vegtable
. hte premise
,
although lacking inthe originality
, certainly offers its share ofthe potential intrigue
adn suspense
. unfortunatley
,
` hte skulls ' isnt niether intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anytying else you would assoicates whith fresh or exciting
. it ' s jsut anyother abysmal teen prototype thta hasnt hte soundtrack
, the stars
.
.
.
.
but not the scirpt
.
` the skulls ' isnt so bad it attains a certian levle ofthe entertainment value
, wtih the screenplay
, by jon pogue
, immediately becoming the basis for a slew ofthe unintentional howlers
. first off
, upon their initiation inot the skulls
, eahc newyorker member has to have a skull branded onto their arm
. afterward tehy are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers uv teh scar
. will they never take tihs watch off
?
and wqat if tehy forget it by their bedside
? perhaps thier
? sceret ' society ws being a littel too conspicuous whn htey desided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body taht is easily exposed
. on top ofthe htis
, they are each given a rulebook
and a key to headquaters
. gee
, why nto member t
- shirts
?
but my favorite bit is this
: the voting committee for hte skulls doens nto bother with individual
? agred ' or
? disagree ' notions when making colelctive descisions
. tehy are given offcial skull paddles
. when flipped tothe oney side
, they indicate the member agrees wtih the proposal
. facing thte oposite way means a disagreement
. wouldn ' t htey mearly express themslves verbally
? hell no
. htey ahve to retreive teh paddles forthe a proper vote
,
and maybe afterward tehy can play ping
- pong
. i ' m still chuckling baout these ludicrous details
,
but tghe humiliating dialogue isnt enought to send one inot arrest
. the casted
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch ofthe veteran talent with a dash of the
` dawson ' s creek ' crowd
,
anbd fuses the twpo toghether
, ensuring taht teh embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughtout
.
bu not entirely
. acomplished actors liuke craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chariman judge litten mandrake
)
adn william peterson
( as fellow board memeber senator levritt
) are dealed pathetic villian caricatures
,
annd look suitably embarassed handling them
.
and
then there ' s christopher mcdonald
, who has teh capacity to be a funn
, exicting actor
. mcdonald ' s karisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks thru anyother perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue makes it a hat
- trck
)
. i pray it wass a
` snatch
- tghe
- paycheck
-
anbd
- run ' exercise for all these actors
. the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better
. let ' s cut yhe talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack forthe maintaining believability within tje confines of his character
. paul walker
, the strapping quaterback from
` varsity blues '
, isnt bland
but passable as caleb mandrake
- the judge ' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even wehn dealed the silliest dialogue iin yhe movie
(
` dad
, i just killed a guy inwhich the ritual room
! '
)
. some actuall spark isnt generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke ' s longtime chum chloe
,
and manages to sucesfuly pull off soem convincing dramatics
. it really boils down tothe the actors attempting tothe puncture tghe surounding plastic bubble ofthe absurdity that cages them fomr minute noe
. or mabye not minute noe
, thanks to a decent setted
- up from directer rob cohen
, who films early sequences with a sense ofthe atmosphere
and sytle
. it mkaes you wonder why he didn ' t flee indefinitly fomr thge project
, beacuse while enjoyable cheese like
` dragonheart '
and the moderate stallone thriller
` daylight ' aren ' t superior cinema
, htey belong on thge afi top 100 list whn compared tothe this degrading trash
. asside ffrom unintentionally humoring the audiance
,
` thge skulls ' gets littel accomplished
. the thrills
adn acation are lazy
annd mecanical
. the story isnt stuffed wtih rediculous
, formulaic plotting thgat sheepishly overlooks tjhe cool potential of a secret underground society flick
. instade ofthe gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organiztion
, we are thrusted into a lame video surveillance conspiracy tht hasnt developped barnacles from excessive useage
. we ' ve seen it all befoer
,
and better
.
` teh skulls ' isnt a feeble littel carcus ofthe stupidity
, so miscalculated thta
-
- while it would serve as a clever pun
-
- a term liuke
? boneheaded ' seems just too generous
.
