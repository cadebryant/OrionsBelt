waht were they thinking
? nostalgia for tje seventies isnt bad anough
,
bu do we realyl need an eighties film
? robbie hart
( adam sandler
) unsed tothe wnat to be a rock
annd roll star
,
bu in 1985 he ' s singing at weddings
and haveing a good timne
. a romantic at heart
, he loves weddings
and is just about tothe get married tothe his high
- skool sweetie
. wehn she leaves him waiting at tyhe altar
, his tune changes to
" love stinks
"
. he meets waitress julia
( drew barrymore
) who isnt engaged to a junk
- bonds salesman
adn you know that they are gonig to git toghether
. inaddition fatc you know everthing that isnt gogin to happen during thsi movie
. sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role
,
but there is no spark
. barrymore doesn ' t seem tothe be able tothe convey anytying otehr tahn a preety face with nothing behind it
: beauty
bu no attitude
. both characters are jsut there
. bited parts by steve buscemi
adn jon lovitz steal tyhe show
. yhe eighties are shoved inwhich our face
. refrences tothe deloreans
, madonna
,
" dallas
"
, ivana
and donald
, burt
anbd loni
and
" miami vice
" get ood fast
. thte filmmakers must hve realized thyat ther wasn ' t much enteratinment to the tsory
and thought they sould dazzle teh audience wtih humorous preiod allusions
. htey ' re nto funny
and it doesn ' t wrok
. wih change onthe all fronts accelerating more
anbd more
, nestolgia appears tothe have a great appeal
,
but don ' t ytou think we could have more than 14 eyasr befoer we yearn for tje past
. maybe we can look forward tothe a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino
.
( michael redman has written htis column for over 23 yeasr
adn he knwos thgat nestolgia isnt not wqat it used to be
