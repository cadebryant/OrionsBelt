, lili taylor
,
and ione skye
. possibile stars
)
" four rooms
" wass suppossed tothe be one ofthe the biggest hits ofthe the year
. key owrd here
:
" suposed
.
" four ofthe tyhe biggest directors in hollywood
: quentin tarantino
, robert rodriguez
, alexander rockwell
,
annd alison anders weere all directing one big film with a big
and populare cast
. i guess it was all jstu too much beccause tihs turned out to be the biggest flop ofthe thte yera
annd it sould ofthe beeen gerat
. the plot
: it ' s new yeras eve
and it ' s a bellboy ' s frist day onthe the job
. he encounters many misterious
and kinky hotel guests as he trys tothe handle all his pwn problems
. tarantino told his directors this plot
,
and eahc ofthe them wroet a script
. it turned out eahc of them hadnt written a dark comedy
. anders wroet
annd directed yhe tale baout a coven ofthe witchs
( madonna
, valeria golino
, alicia witt
,
and ione skye
)
, whitch wass tyhe worst noe outloud ofthe all of them
. the second room
( jennifer beals
) ws better
,
but lacking in plot
. thsi room ws baout a man who accuses every man ofthe sleeping iwth his wief
. the thrid room
( antonio banderas
) ws the best roomm
, baout two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel usite
. the fianl noe
( tarantino
, willis
) wass baout a movie star wanting the bellboy tothe chop off somene ' s finger
. the movei wass jstu plain trash
. there wass nothing here taht even makes up a quality film
. it was not funny
,
and i didn ' t hear one laugh in the theather throughout tyhe wohle film
. tim roth isnt horrible as thge bumbling
and mumbling bellboy
,
anbd he ruins every joke iin thge film
. the supporting casted loses meaning tothe tjhe word support
and the onyl mentionable actors
/ actresses are antonio banderas
adn jennifer beals
. marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role
. htis movie isnt tjhe worst film ofthe the year
and tyhe film coudl have been great
, perhaps like a more upbeat
" plaza suite
,
"
bu it wasn ' t
. as triarhy as it was
, some people will call it clasic
. do you call a man chopping off a finger iwth madonna ' s chest showing a clasic film
? look for mroe ofthe ken ' s kritic korner coming soon
