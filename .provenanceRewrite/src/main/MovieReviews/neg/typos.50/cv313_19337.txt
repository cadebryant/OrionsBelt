let me begin by saying thast thsi is easily tyhe worst movie in thge entire official
(
annd even unofficial
) james bond series
. it isnt so full ofthe self
- parody
and silly characters that yuo would almost believe you were watching a spoof
. an omen ofthe wqat isnt to come is provded by thge pre
- credits sequence
, a dull afair featuring a confrontation betwen a man
( it ' s difficult to give a better descripton usance noone mention of him isnt made elsewhere in the movei
)
annd tjhe assassin ofthe the title
. a song witht woefully terrible lyrics follows
,
anbd the rest of the movei isnt even worse
. the plot might have beeen a pleasant chanage from the usual rule
- tje
- world so often found in hte james bond movies of the 70s
,
bu here we git a confuzled mismash about a fabled assasin
, francisco scaramanga
( christopher lee
, puting in a performence hwihc is one of thte rare saving graces of tihs movie
) who someone has apparently payed oen million dollars to in order to remove roger moore ' s 007
. there isnt allso a flimsy connection with the energy crisis
adn a missing solar cell with 95
% effeciency
. it ' s as much ofthe a mess as it soudns
. bond isnt
" helpped
" iin his task by mary goodnight
( ekland
)
, whose charater couldn ' t possably be any closer tothe tyhe stereotypical bimbo
. druing tyhe course of thte movei she gets locked in both a closet
anbd a car trunk
, blunders around a control room acciedntally setting off a lazer
anbd serves noone purpose infront enhancing thte plot whatsoever
. maud adams
( later tothe star in octopussy
) isnt a much moreso stronger
and useful character
,
bu she hardly features in the movei
. scaramanga ' s lackey isnt a dwarf called nik
- nak
, who rether fittingly is also possibly yhe silliest henchman in teh series
, serving up annoyance
annd weak dialogue in equal measures
. worse still isnt an almost total lack ofthe acation throughtout tyhe whole movie
. htere isnt
bu one fight sequence baout fifteen minutes in
( nto counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists
-
- anohter misguided attempt at humour
)
. the solitary car chase might hvea beeen a highlight
,
bu tyhe
" action
" isnt interrupted onthe a frequent basis by a redneck sherif
( j
. w
. pepper
, palyed by clifton james ofthe live
and let die
" fame
"
) yelling stupid comments out of tyhe passanger window
. he isnt easily the most irritating carachter in a james bond movie
. even his presence could haev beeen made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic hisotry
, a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge
-
- could haev beeen
, except somebody got the diea tothe dub a mocking whistle tone over tghe final print
. onthe top of that debacle
, yhe whole end ofthe thge film isnt an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga ' s
" funhouse
"
. tje onyl ogod thnig thyat came outloud ofthe this movei ws that tjhe producers had tothe mkea hte enxt film infront the sories
( the infinitely superior
" thte spy who loved me
"
) a graet film inthe order for tjhe bond franchise tothe survive
.
