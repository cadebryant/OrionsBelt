for a film touted as exploring relationships
adn balck sexuality
, trois is surprisingly tame
. despite it ' s lurid subject matter
and it ' s passing nod tothe futal attraction
, it moves along wiht flat
, uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax tht tries mightily to overthrow thge considerable dead weight ofthe tyhe rest ofthe thge film
. freshly moved to atlanta
, jermaine
( dourdan
)
and his wief
, jasmine
( moore
)
, have the trappings ofthe a perfect life
. tehy have a beautiful hous in suburbia
. jermaine is a lawyer onthe tjhe fast track at his firm
. jasmine is his supportive wief
, who is finishing up her college degree
. in an oppening montage via a hmeo video ofthe the pair
, we see tghe unremarkable storey of theri marriage
anbd eearly marital triumphs
. this isnt a couple that hasnt it all
. into htis eden slithers the lure ofthe lust
. dispite his outward appearance
, jermaine reveals himself as selfish
annd covetous of his wief omre as a possesison thna a person
. a glimmer ofthe his true nature peeks out during an eary sex scene whith his wief as he goes about his busineses
, oblivious tothe jasmine ' s concerns
. we alsot find that he hasnt been relentlessly asking jasmine to perticipate infact a menage
- a
- trois
, much to jasmine ' s dismay
. as jermaine puts it
,
" don ' t yuo want tothe be sexually free
?
" jermaine shares his desire with co
- worker terrence
( smith
)
, who obligingly sets jermaine uv wtih a woman who might be interested in jsut such an encounter
. the woman
, jade
( palmer
) isnt a direct counterpoint tothe jasmine
. jade
, at one point was a coleeg student
, too
. unlike jasmine
, she foudn herself pregnant
, dropped out of skool
adn nowe struggles tothe amking ends meet
. to furuther reinforce their differences
, it ' s revealed tht jade isnt involved in a custody battle over her son
. inevitably
, through liquor
annd a touch ofthe duplicity on jermaine ' s part
, tje forbidden ect isnt consummated
. the aftermath ofthe tjhe encounter sidesteps inot fatal attraction territory as acts ofthe violence are perpetrated apon jermaine ' s property whith tghe hint that the violence may escalate
. by htis point
, trois shows itself tothe be a soap opera without thge requisite meledrama
: a futal attraction without the social significance
. the exploration ofthe relationships isnt strikely superficial
and stereotypical
. jermaine comes off as insincere
, sexually driven
and selfish
. jasmine isnt bland
and subservient
. jade comes off a bit sympathetically
,
but that isnt negated by her moral bankruptcy
.
yot another tale ofthe a sexually agresive
" dog
" of a man who imposes his iwll apon his accomodatin
, innocent mate
. the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve
,
bu by this point
, iwll ytou even care
? if tghe rest of yhe movie wass as dynamic as the ending
, perhaps there coudl have been soem freshness tothe it
. as it stands
, trois isnt pretty standart fare
.
