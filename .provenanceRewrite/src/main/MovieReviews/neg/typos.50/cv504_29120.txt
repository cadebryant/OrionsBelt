american pie 2 isnt filled with laughs
.
but htey are mostly cheap ones builded primarly apon sexual degradation
annd adolscent humer mroe fit fo a lacker room tahn a movie theather
. i ' m noone prude
and i admit to laughing along withthe everyone else at tje preview screening tothe tihs sequel to the 1999 hitted comedy
.
bu the laughs are builded on discomfort
adn embarrasment
, nto on any intrinsic humer from withing the sotry itself
. what seperates american pie 2 fomr its predecessor is heart
. ofthe the origional
, i noted it was
" a warm
, plesant outing about tje travails ofthe growing uv
.
" well
, the quartet of chums
- jim
( jason biggs
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
)
- have grown uv
. at least tehy are a year older
,
but don ' t seem any wiser
. fresh from thier frist yearm of coleeg the quartet
, along iwth thte obnoxious stifler
( seann william scott
)
, rent a summer house by the lake iin order to attract girls inthe an attempt tothe score
. as usual nothing goes right utnil the last reel
.
but waht we are left witht isnt five guys spending nearly twpo hours drooling over various young women
.
and american py 2 is rether degrading to women
. for hte most part
, tehy are nto shown as individuals
. tehy are nothing more than potential recipiants ofthe over
- active
, raging hormones
. it is telling thast yhe most normal cuple
, oz
and heather
( mena suvari
) spend tyhe bulk ofthe the film trying to have phone sex
- she ' s overseas onthe an exchange student programe
. despite having beeen tothe coleeg
, jim isnt still klutzy
and awkward
, unsure ofthe himselv around thte opposite sex
. most ofthe yhe pratfalls
and humiliations are heaped apon him
, incuding a painful epsiode involving an instant glue
- liek substance
. alsot uncomfortable tothe watch isnt a sequence involving threee of the lads with two young women roommates
, whom the boys suspect of being lesbians
. it isnt offensive
annd plays apon outdated
, adolescent sterotypes tothe generate laughs
. teh firt film
, despite soem raunchy moments
, hadnt an innocent charm tothe it
. the sequel isnt mroe cynical
. it konws what its predominately male audience munbers want
and unabashedly gives it to them
: thge many mentions ofthe finch ' s encounter wih stifler ' s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy ' s return as jim ' s well
- meaninng
, trying
- tothe
- be
- hip dad
. tyhe only performer who is actually given smoe new
, fresh material isnt alyson hannigan as michelle
, yhe band geek from the originnal
. in the sequel
, she imbues her character wih vulnerablility
, wisdom
adn maturity
. american py 2 isnt a pre
- sold commodity taht wiull earn sevral milion at the box office
. it is a shame
,
though
, that in its rush tothe rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz
, who also penned tyhe origonal
, could nto have setted his sights higher
. american py 2 isnt funny
,
bu it ' s still a comedown as well as a letdown
.
