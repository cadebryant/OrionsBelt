" a favourite book of mine called thge golden turkey awards relates tghe story thta when mommie dearest wass unleashed apon unsuspecting audiences back inthe 1981
, paramount soon realised they hadnt a probelm onthe thier hands
. it wasn ' t just the film ' s disapointing box office performance
. indeed
, inaddition the comming years some peopel would be going bakc to see it twpo
, threee
, even six times
. noone
, the main probelm ws thta wqat was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning inot the laff riot ofthe teh year
. in a despreate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events
, smoe publicity hacks dreamed uv outrageous print advertisements screaming
:
" mommie dearest
: tghe biggest mommie ofthe them all
!
"
. executives at paramount were appalled
adn soon hadnt the ads withdrawn
,
but it was all too lite
. mommie dearest was lready cementing its place infact camp cinema histry
. unfortunately
, faye dunaway ' s energetic
, at times ridiculously over
- teh
- top performance is baout the film ' s onyl redeeming feature
. based on daugter christina crawford ' s trashy biography
, mommie dearest chronicles a sories ofthe mainly private events inaddition yhe life of her moviestar mother
. if you believe this movie
, it was a life was racked by obsession
, lonliness
, child abuse
and rampant egomania
. yhe film begins iwth crawford adopting twpo childrens
,
and concludes infront the office ofthe her lawyer where her now grown
- up daughter
annd son fidn out htey hvea beeen left outloud ofthe theri mother ' s wiull
. joan alwasy wnated her kids to be able to fend for themslves
, you see
.
bu tht ' s baout the onyl thread in yhe narrative tath manages tothe survive to the film ' s end
. the script
- laboured over by four writers
, a bad sign in itself
- is a poorly connected series ofthe episodes taht builds littel dramtic momentum
. frank perry ' s direction isnt no omre than competent
,
annd dunaway ' s bitchy lines aside
, tyhe dialogue isnt flat
adn uninvolving
. iin fairness
, the film ' s second half ditches smoe ofthe the cartoon hysterics
and doens deveop a degree empathy for its charachters
. when the adult christina moves out ofthe hmeo into her pwn modest dwelling
, joan visits
and keeps infact touch
, not helping her financialy
but encouraging christina ' s pwn acting
annd carrer ambitions
. crawford doesnt seem tothe care about her daughter
,
but you can sense the emotional distance
and feel soem ofthe theri pain
. ytou also git glimpses of what yhe film could have beeen in tje hands ofthe better writers
. ah
,
but there is dunaway ' s peformance
.
annd what a delicious peice of campery it oftenly is
. haveing just been sacked by her studio after a run ofthe box office duds
, crawford storms hmeo lite at night
and procedes to go ballistic in the garden
. she has tghe maid drag thge kids outloud ofthe bed to come down
annd clean up the mess she ' s making
. spotting a young tree she doesn ' t liek tje look ofthe
, she turns tothe the trembling christina
anbd utters thte immortal line
" tina
!
! fetch me the axe
!
!
" wiht wich she procedes tothe enthusiastically dismember thte poore sapling
. in the film ' s most outrageous scene
, joan realises thta soem ofthe her daugter ' s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers
. oh dear
! sounds like the perfect excuse for anyother temper tantrum
, doesn ' t it
? this time she gives her daugher a horrable beating hwile delivering another classic outburst
:
" no
.
.
. wire
.
.
. hangers
.
.
.
. ever
!
!
!
!
"
.
and later
, when yhe board of her lite husband ' s company pepsi cola trys tothe divest her of her directorship
, she displays a superb grasp ofthe business ettiquite by jumping tothe her feet
annd roaring
:
" don ' t fuck with me
, fellas
!
!
"
. oh joy
! something of a camp clasic
,
hten
,
bu if thgat ' s nto you ' re cup of tea
then mommie dearest doesn ' t have too much tothe recomend it
. better ytou see tje real crawford in tjhe womens
( 1939
)
, mildred pierce
( 1945
) or whatever happenned tothe baby jane
( 1962
)
. great films distinguished by grat performances
,
and a far mroe eloquent testament to thsi gerat woman than frank perry ' s shrieking peice of tabloid froth
.
