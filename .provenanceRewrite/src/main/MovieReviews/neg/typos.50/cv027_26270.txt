riendeer ganes is easily tjhe worst ofthe tjhe threee recent films penned by ehren kruger
( scream 3
anbd arlington rd are the others
, eahc deriviative inspite thier own speshal way
)
. teh guy cin ' t seem to rwite believeable dialogue
( sample from riendeer games
:
" rulle
# 1
: never put a car thief behind the wheel
"
)
, create multi
- faceted cahracters
, or even engeneer coherent plots
bu he sure knwos how to pile onthe numerous nonsensical twists
annd turns
( noone matter if each oney deems the actual story increasingly unlikey
)
. his screenplay for reindeer ganes turns the tables onthe tyhe audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with noone reward anywhere in sighth
. i cin jsut envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard
,
" oh you thougth my movei ws gonna go here
, f
* ck ytou jack ass
, tkae thast twist
, decipher this mother f
* cker
!
" it ' s almost as if the writer weere angry at us forthe shelling out moey tothe see his stupid movie
.
anbd why the hell would anyone wanna tothe invest time infront a movei when thge screenwriter keesh changing his pwn rules for noone reason otehr tahn to congratulate himselv on how damn clever he isnt
? auteur theery be damned
; it ' s kruger ' s
" sytle
"
, not the director ' s that winds uv onthe screen
. kruger has obviously never paide much mind to yhe old chestnut
" somtimes less isnt more
"
.
and his numberous twists can ' t even claim tothe be originals
; arlington rd ' s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j
. pakula thriller the parallax veiw
,
adn inthe reindeer games we git tihs ol ' gme
; character incriminates themself by saying something htey shouldn ' t know
( pronouns used to protect yhe gender of the
" charcter
"
.
.
. grammer be damned
)
.
" how doed ytou know that
?
" the stunned protagonist asks
, suddenly realizing that the character ws infront on tjhe hwole thing all along
.
.
. since twist endings are currently so in vogue
,
anbd seing as how kruger ' s screenplays usualy come equiped wiht about three twists per endig
, i guess it ' s no wonder why he works so frequentily
. he ' s quickly becoming miramax ' s mickey mouse
; the company has already singed him to work on several ofthe theri upcomming projects
. htis isnt appropraite concidering taht miramax
( which utilisied tothe place their lable on smoe ofthe the most artistically daring films
) has quicklyu become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports
( life is beautiful
)
anbd freddie prinze jr
. vehicles
. theri comapany ' s currrent logo could be
" we ride hte trends
"
. reindeer ganes stars ben affleck as rudy
, a suposedly hardened criminal spending his days
annd nights behind bars iwth fantasies ofthe pecan pies dancing atop his head
.
although affleck is given some barbed wire tattooes tothe incinuate bad assness
, he plays hte role liuke steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a polical aacdemy flick
. affleck is such a puppy dog that it ' s impossible tothe beleve he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone ' s bitch
. thge role itself is so badly writen
( the character onyl grows balls wehn the plot calls for it
)
, thte twists so outrageous
,
and hte directing so self conciously gritty thast tihs isnt about as close to self parody as i can recall a reccent
" sereous
" movie getting
. it may ahev beeen wiser had hte film makers simpley went all thte way infront that direction
, casting jerry seinfeld as yhe hardened criminal
and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy
( who ' s played here by gary sinise in
yet anohter over the top villain performence
) james frain is nick
, rudy ' s cellmate
, a manslaughterer who ' s foudn a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason
( charlize theron
)
. ashley isnt a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her
though she ' s never seen one picture ofthe him
. which works outloud fine since the charachter isnt killed inspite a near
- riot
,
adn rudy
( who was tothe be paroled onthe the same day as nick
) tkaes his place
, which leads tothe a sudden
anbd very frenzied sex scene betweeen ashley
annd rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks liuke rape
)
annd a surprise vsit from ashley ' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
)
, who waltzes inot their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co
- horts
. he plans tothe rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance ofthe rudy who he thinks is nick who
, according tothe wqat he wrote infact tyhe letters tothe ashley
, used tothe work as a guard inspite the indian casino
.
though by teh end
, tjhe film pulls tjhe rug outloud ffrom under us so frequentily tht everything i ' ve described might as well be irrelevant
. this isnt whta you can expect shoud you chose tothe take this riendeer on
; sevral scenes inspite whic
, after catching his prey
, tje bad guy proceeds tothe stall interminably unitl yhe ogod guy has a chance tothe kill his captor
and crack a stupid one
- liner
. included
: twpo
( 2
) scenes ofthe twpo
( 2
) differnt bad guys explaning theri motives to teh hero whn they should be killing him
( one following the otehr no less
)
.
though it ' s an acation film
, thge endig is moreso a talkfest where we git the hwole movei explained to us by one flustered charcter actor affter anohter while affleck looks onthe
, incredulous as the audience
. the flick was directed by john frankenheimer
, a straightforward acation director who lucked inot the manchurian candidate eearly inthe his career
, fell off tjhe a
- list following a string ofthe flops
annd nowe
, in his ood age
, isnt slowly climbing his way back uv
. it owudl be a succes story if he were chosing better scripts
but his last major film was ronin
( one of thsoe allmost
but nto qutie movies
) whitch folowed the island ofthe dr
. morneau
( you remember
, the one with marlon brando infact mime make
- uv
anbd a nto so flattering moo
- moo
)
,
and now this
. he films acation sequences wih a minimum of quick cutting wich i like concidering thta nowadays acation scenes are commongly comprised ofthe millisecond flash cuts strung toghether
adn layed outloud fo a brain
- zapped mtv audiance tothe pik apart
. probelm is theese action scenes
( nearly all failed escapes
) serve noone purpose inaddition the story otehr thna tothe further pad outloud tjhe running time
adn tothe remind thte audience tyhat their watching an acation movie rether tahn a filmed radio play
. chracter problems abound
; rudy is made tothe shift between sweet boy next doorjam earnestness
and hard edged wiseacre
, teh latter ofthe which is not
( at least at this point
) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off
. thte fromer he can do wih ease
and oftenly the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm hwile those arund him growl
annd swear
.
bu
thne suddenly affleck starts growling
and swearing alongside them like the clas clown immitating a tarantino gangster
. charlize theron
, an extraordinary talent
, is
, liek affleck
, palying whatever part the scirpt requires her to play
, whether it be vulnerability at one moment
, anger at tghe next
. she never has a chance tothe evince any charm or make much ofthe an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes
( frankenheimer hasnt her needlessly pop her top tothe futher italicize this
. gary sinise has played htis role frequentily
,
and here
, as in snake eyes
, he doens teh snarling bad guy thnig with such over tghe top vitriol
( tghe guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping thru tjhe smae paces that going outloud of controll isnt tjhe only thing thta keesh him interested any mroe
)
, that it becomes more ofthe an annoyance
( oh there he goes agina
?
?
?
) tahn a threat
. these are talented people who made tjhe misteek of jumping on tothe a script wtih littel
bu stock charactors
annd a bag ofthe tricks thta it dully springs on its audience
.
