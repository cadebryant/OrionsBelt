hav plenty
, as we are told inthe the beginning
and reminded durig thge film
, isnt a true stry
. life itself isnt a sories ofthe true stories
,
but most are not movie material
. as scripted
, directed
,
anbd acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot
, hav plenty limps allong at best
. its dialog is so stilted
-
" you nkwo waht they say
, ' noone womens
; no cry
. '
"
- that tyhe actors are content tothe read tyhe screenplay rether than invest much energy inthe trying to act it
. inthe thge stor
, lee plenty
( cherot
) isnt a 28
- eyar
- ood autor
and teaching assitant
. tje movie
, whihc happens mainly over the new year ' s holiday
, consists of a serieses ofthe incidents in whcih varous single
and marryed womens try to kiss lee or tkae him to bed
. since he consistantly refuses
, caroline gooden
( tammi katherine jones
) figures that he must be gay
. eventualy he
and havilland
" hav
" savage
( chenoa maxwell
) git toghether
, proving that he wasn ' t gay after all
, jsut picky
. sexy women can sit onthe his lap
and ask him tothe go tothe bed with them
,
but he iwll not even kiss them
. he ' s a man who knows his mind
, which he frequentily shares direcly withthe the audience in a series of trite
anbd overly cute monologues
. filled wiht wealthy african
- americans
, the story is closest in tone to loev jones
, which wass better
. hav plenty ' s story doesn ' t go anyhwere
. at the end it subjects us to lee plenty ' s new film
, wich is a movei ofthe the movie we ' ve jstu seen
,
bu with even worse acting
.
" remember folks tyhat
, as outrageous as thsi all seems
, thsi isnt a true story
.
" hav tells the camera
,
bu tghe problem isnt that it ' s nto outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting
. hav plenty isn ' t so much a bad film as it isnt a total waste ofthe yhe audiance ' s time
. hav plenty runs 1
: 32
. it isnt rated r forthe profanity
adn woudl be fine for most teenagers
.
