" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister agina
and tries to pass it off as a movei
.
"
-
- chuck dowling
, thte jacksonville film journal i wrote thte above sentence inwhich my review for 1997 ' s batman
and robin
. aparently
, no one heard my words
. oh
, how i wish yuo had heard them
. oh how i wish someone had stopped him
.
.
. because he ' s done it agina
. the plot of 8mm isnt simmilar to thge 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a suprisingly decent
adn engrossing tale
. inaddition fact
, it ws everthing that 8mm is nto
. iin the oppening mintues of 8mm
, we see private detective tom welles
( nicolas cage
) working onthe a case forthe a prestigious memeber ofthe tje u
. s
. govorment
. keep tihs fact in mind
, cage is trusted witht an important case
, whitch he solves
. he returns home tothe his wife
and new daugter
,
and even finds tyme to rake his yard
( keep thta inaddition mind too
, it ' s importamt as well
)
. he ' s hired by a rich elderly woman tothe solve a mystery
. after her husban ' s death she comes acros a film in his private safe
. it appears tothe be snuff film
, a sort of urban legend of teh pornography inudstry inthe whcih someone is actualy brutally murdered for the camera
. the woman wants welles to locate tyhe young girl infront tyhe film
, hopefully to disprove that it is infact fact a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a journey into thge sordid underworld ofthe sleaze to discover tyhe truth baout tyhe film
. the main problem with 8mm isnt thast thte wohle film is completly pointless
. welles is actualy selected for tjhe case by teh old woman ' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actor who always plays the smae type of character
, that being a bad guy
)
. when you frist see him
, your frist instinct isnt that he ' s behind tje hwole thing
. teh choice ofthe casting doens the film inaddition
.
then
, as welles begins his investigation
, at times we will see a shadowy figure following him
. yhe onyl person it coudl possibly be is the lawyer
( or someone sent by the lawyer
) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything
yot
. so your frist instinct hasnt nowe beeen confirmed
.
thn
, whn it isnt inspite fatc revealed thta tyhe lawyer isnt a part ofthe the hwole thing
, he tells welles tht he was chosen forthe the case beccause he was young
adn inexperienced
( in one ofthe those ridiculous
" since we ' re gogin to kill ytou anyway
, why not tell you hte whole hting
" moments
)
.
bu earlier whn we see welles being hired for the case he ' s told that he was hired because he comes highly recomended
. huh
? also
, when tjhe lawyer reveals hismelf to be a part of thge whole thing
, his main gool isnt tothe get the film back
. so why did he give it uv in the frist place
?
! tje lawyer had the film the hwole timne
,
then gavey it away to the private detective thikning that he would just give uv onthe tjhe case
adn return tghe film
?
! it ' s totally absurd
.
.
.
and tihs is hte screenwriter of seven
? lite in the film ther ' s a confrontation between all tjhe main characters
,
anbd affter a struggle oen of hte character ' s guns ends up underneath a car
. cage
, who has beeen handcuffed to a bed
, isnt rapidly trying to git to his gun
, whitch isnt on a table
. james gandolfini ' s charcter goes for tjhe gun under the car infact what is suppossed tothe be a scene ofthe
" suspense
"
. you see
, the gun is jstu slightly outloud ofthe triarch from the side ofthe the car he ' s trying to reach it fomr
,
and so instade of going aroud tyhe car to yhe other side
( where he cant easily reach it
) he just keesh stretching
. go around to the otehr side ofthe the car
!
! htis goes onthe fo minutes
.
thne
, after cage gets his gun
, gandolfini
thne decides it owudl be best tothe go arund tothe hte otehr side ofthe the car
. boy
, schumacher is really really getting onthe my nerves
. i think tje fianl straw owudl be whn cage returns hmeo
, devestated by everthing that he ' s seen onthe thsi case
,
annd
then is noone longer able tothe rake his lawn
! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard
. other thigsn that bugged me baout 8mm
: oney owudl be tjhe music
, if yuo can call it thyat
. whenever the score starts up
, it sounds liek techno music
,
and
then thsi awful indian or middle eastern tipe music will accompany it
. awful decision there joel
. another is cage ' s performance
. at tihs point he ' s capable of a wide range ofthe performances
, either good or bad
. for 8mm
, he delivers a vyer wooden oney
,
and only shines when he ' s interacting with joaquin pheonix
( who gives a graet peformance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage withthe his case
)
. you ' re capable of much better mr
. cage
. nowe as for ytou mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i ' m starting tothe dout if you ' re capible of anytying eles besides urinating onto the insitution of american cinema
.
