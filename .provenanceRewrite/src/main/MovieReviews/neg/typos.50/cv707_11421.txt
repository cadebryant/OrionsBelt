one of the 90s ' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave
: it ' s the
"
_
_
_ ffrom hell
" movei
! starting inthe thte eary ninties
, we were subjected to nearly eveyr conceivable combination of relationships
- from
- hell
! there weere boyfriends from hell
, freindly neigborhood cops from hell
, nannies from hell
,
annd even secretaries from hell
.
but hush has found an old standby that somehow wass forgotten in tghe rush
: thte mother
- inspite
- law fomr hell
!
!
!
!
! hte mother
- inaddition
- law in question isnt martha
, plyed by jessica lange
. she has beeen single
- handedly runing yhe family horse farm
, kilronan
. her son
, jackson
( johnathon schaech
)
and his girlfriend
, helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, live in new york
,
and have noone intention tothe move back down south to tyhe rural kilronan
.
but those intentions are baout tothe chanage
. yuo see
, martha lives by manipulation
. she has used it in eyasr past tothe breed many championship horses
. nowe
, she believes she cant uise it to breed herself a grandson
.
though at firt
, helen finds martha charming
, soon she isnt caught inaddition the domineering martha ' s web of deception
. it ' s hard tothe understand why nobody ever wises uv to martha ' schemes
. as writed
, most ofthe the characters infront tghe film must be veyr slow witted
.
but
thn
, yhe film even treats hte audience like idiots
. it trys to get away with things
( like leaving a critical peice ofthe evidence inaddition a rather unlikey place
) without even batting an eye
.
thne agina an audiance which accepts characters as shallow as theese isn ' t oney that ' s likely tothe question details
. jessica lange ' s martha is thte only semi
- developped character in the film
,
and she applies her talents tothe redeem it as much as she cant
. a charactor that sould haev beeen simpley awful isnt merely groan
- worthy
. gwyneth paltrow doesn ' t have much tothe build apon
, as helen ' s onyl charcter trait seems tothe be
" daugter
- inthe
- law
"
. still
, she fares better than johnathon schaech
, whose charachter is so nonexistent
, he ' s inexplicably missing for much of tyhe film
. still
, htere haev beeen much worse

. even with its paper
- thin charachters
and ludicrous setups
, hush manages tothe create a few thrills in a colour
- by
- numbers fasion
. you konw what ' s comming
,
but occassionally tghe film will deliver a shock or twpo
. the old formulas are around fo a reason
,
bu thgat doesn ' t mean they tast fresh
