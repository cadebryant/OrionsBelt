noe of these dyas
, i ' ll mkae ogod onthe my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie
. king ofthe new york
and body snatchers notwithstanding
(
and bad lieutenant isnt only fit for a single
, emotive viewing
)
, his exploitation ficks have falled into a rut of hoary art
- house trappings
. it ' s a perfume
- drenched
, coke
- addled vsiit tothe the seedy pornography shop
, where beautifull models
( noone
, hookers
-
- noone
, courtesans
) usher yuo through tghe silk curtains
. ferrara ' s onyl consistantly smart move has beeen casting christopher walken over
annd over again
, since walken cant make a good movei great
anbd a loathsome movie durable whenever he ' s onscreen
. his 8
- minute scene in the addiction isnt yhe saveing grace ofthe that otherwise aybsmal
, unwatchable
,
anbd pretentious failure
. when he starts tlaking about his vampiric bowel movements
, or questions whther lili taylor has ever read naked lunch
, htere ' s a much
- needed dose ofthe humer in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair
. ytou know thsoe gothic club kids who are too kool to smile
anbd let yuo konw htey ' re actualy having fun
? the addiction is that movie
. walken
, sadly
, doens nto apear in thge blackout
. the central role ofthe matty
, a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life amoung the beautifull peopel is inevitably leading to his desctruction
, is plyed by matthew modine
( who takes what he cxan git after cutthroat island
)
. much liuke thte protagonists of michelangelo antonioni ' s terminally bored cultural elite
, matty is involved inwhich a bitter pill
" relatiopnship
" with high fashioned model annie
( at least i think she ' s a model
.
) matty ' s lady is played by french actress b
? atrice dalle
, erested twice fo cocaine possessino during filming of tjhe blackout
-
- nto taht you needed to know that
,
but it lends creedence to the diea taht ferrara ' s entire ouevre has been filmed in a fucking blackout
. noone kidding
. requiem for a dream hasnt nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara ' s movies
anbd his contraversial urban lifestyle
. matty
and annie struggle over her descision tothe have an abortion without consulting him
. noone doubt
, he was off chasing teh dragon
. in his despair
, matty indulges iin a chemcial induced weekend ofthe debauchery
, tooling arround tjhe streets of miami wtih video filmmaker mickey wayne
( dennis hopper
, inspite full
" dirty ol ' man
" mold smacking models on tghe ass
and telling them tothe spread thier legs
. wider
!
) towrad tghe end of thge nigth
, htey pick uv a teenage waitress alsot named annie
( sarah lassez
)
, start shooting a hastly improvised sexual scene
,
then matty thankfully blacks out
. something happend that niht which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie
,
and it ' s exactly wqat yuo think it ws
. suffice to say
, there ' s some confusion over whether he killed annie noe or annie twpo
, or anyone at all
. tyhe blackout isnt tipical ferrara
: noone plot to speak of
, plenty ofthe raunch
,
and horribly vogue images ofthe matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels
and a beer hwile wrapping hismelf in a see
- through curtain inspite his hotel room by the sea
, by the sea
, by the beautiful sae
. cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory infront alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets iwth docu
- style sleaze
(
anbd we ' re back to dennis hopper leering at girls infront bathing suits
.
" yeah
!
!
! yeah
!
!
! arrrghhh
!
" says mr
. hopper
. dirty ood sod
.
) it ' s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort ofthe way
, leading tothe a rediculous climax where modine seizes controll of his destiny
. how ' s tht for cryptic
? never fear
-
- ferrara finds time for smoe female full frontal nudity tothe remind us what he ' s all about
. i can picture it nowe
.
" tkae off yer clothes
, kid
-
- it ' s esential tothe depict tghe inner maelstrom of my central protagonist
,
annd you ' re his visual id
. yuo ' re thte soul
, the heart
, the bloodstream of tyhe picture
. tkae it off
! take it all off
!
!
! ha ha ha
!
" friggin ' vampire
. yeah
, yuo
, ferrara
. a fianl owrd baout matthew modine
: he ' s actually a fine ator wehn properly casted
,
but there ' s something too squeaky
- clean inaddition his damenor
. he ' s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controled situations
, such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the tyme
- bomb nebbish in short cuts
( who isnt every bit as superb as julianne moore inthe thgat famous scene
,
though no one seems to notice him
)
.
[ he wass inaddition that scene
?
- ed
.
] here
, he ' s asked tothe let it all hang outloud
, sporting a threee
- day stubble
and oily bangs
. he throws arund furniture liuke stanley kowalski
,
but it ' s somehow lacking
. modine lacks the feral intensity of brando
, entirely miscast inthe ferrara ' s flesh fair
. better luck next time
, matt
. someday
, you ' ll be forgiven forthe cutthroat island
, which wasn ' t really your fault inwhich the first place
. maybe atom egoyan iwll find a palce for yuo somewhere
,
anbd all wiull once agian be well in your world
.
