look
! the new verzion of
" psycho
" came outloud
and tje world didn ' t end
! i guess gus van sant really isn ' t the bringer of the apocalypse
! unfourtunately
,
though
, that
" psycho
" didn ' t end yhe world as we know isnt the best thing thta can be said forthe it
. van sant ' s controversial
" re
- telling
" of alfred hitchcock ' s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even befoer it premiered
.
) wihtout benifit of an actual viewing
, many have said that the film iwll
, at best
, suck
. bieng an
( almsot
) ogod criteak
, i waited until i actually saw it tothe decide tath the film
, at best
, sucked
(
and that concludes tjhe ule ofthe the word
" suck
"
annd
, hopefully
, the thoughts tht i am a brain
- dead orangatang
.
) director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film
anbd refilmed it
, shooted
- forthe
- shooted
, useing tjhe same
, excact scirpt
( with a fewd minor alterations
.
) tje inherrent challege wass in mkaing the film suspenseful
adn scary
, even
though a larg gropu of hte audiance will know exactly what iwll happen at the exact time
. suspense probablly could have beeen attained if the actors hadnt been able to create something new or differant tahn the originnal
. sadly
, tyhat did not occurr
. it is hard tothe be overshaddowed by vera miles
and john gavin
( ffrom the orginal
" psycho
)
,
bu that isnt what exactly happened to julianne moore
annd viggo mortensen
. in moore ' s case
, the film would hvae beeen helpped if
" yhe x
- files
" gillian anderson had been casted instade
; especially since moore goes thru the entire film doing a scully impression
! fomr the cold demeanor
and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence
, moore isnt scully
! mortensen
( who i liked infront
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, which would have been nice if he hadnt gone past that starting point
. sam hasnt a twang
and a cowboy hat
,
but thast ' s about it
. mortensen turns inthe one ofthe the most uptight performance in recent memory
. anne heche
, in yhe janet leigh role
, doens a few good things in her brief tiome onthe screen
. at least her marion crane has a littel life in her
, which cant ' t be said fo most ofthe the rest of the casted
. the best work
,
though
, comes from vince vaughn
, as the demented mama ' s boy
, norman bates
. he ' s nto gogin tothe amke anyone forget anthony perkins
,
bu he is effective both in bieng naughty
adn nice
. thte best part ofthe thte film is the dinner scene heche
and vaughn
, where they simply talk
. ther isnt smoe solid acting htere
, something that isnt nto carried through the rest of the film
. van sant hasnt made a boring film
. all thte camera tricks taht hitchcock so eloquently used infact 1960 aren ' t as eye
- catching nowe
. whta passed for brillance
then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don ' t imbaress or excite
. van sant
, inwhich waht i asume isnt a grasp at originality
, decided to put some stream
- ofthe
- consciouness images inot a fewd famouse scenes
( wass tht a lamb inthe thge middle of the road
?
) theese images
, included wih smoe questionable editing choices
, tookover awya ffrom tje scenes themselves
and caused
, at frist
, bewilderment
and
, later
, laughter
. definately not hitchcock ' s intention
! at least danny elfman hadnt hte good sence tothe not mess whith bernard herrmann ' s orginal famouse
annd terific scoer
. if a film liuke
" pyscho
" does not frighten
,
hten what ' s thge point
. aside from norman
, the characters are thinly drawn peple who leave no conection with the audience
. ther are things van sant
and company could haev done to at least make theri recreation intresting
. infact hte end
,
however
, the newyorker
" pyscho
" isnt a noble attempt
,
but
, alas
, a dismal failure
.
