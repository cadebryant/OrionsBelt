. while sevral clips ofthe tje film are seen
, thte short tends tothe spend more tiem trying to recount welle ' s attempts tothe film it
, despite studio problems
, a staggering workload
,
and extremly ill fortune onthe the set
. impressive photography
,
bu raelly onyl intresting tothe film historians

, raoul walsh
, lionel barrymore silent after tjhe dicussion ofthe the newly
- restored verzion of frank capra ' s lost horizon
, where sevral scenes had been restored useing stills
, i wass interested to see sadie thompson
, where tjhe last 5 mintues ofthe the film had been destroyed many yeras ago
. this is the silent verzion of hte somerset maugham short stoy
" miss thompson
"
. tihs is one ofthe yhe most skillful silent films i have ever seen
-
- little awkwardness
,
and a vyre clever script
. the actors
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
( who also directed
annd wrote tje screenplay
)
annd especialy lionel barrymore
, as hte hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie ' s soul
,
but realyl wnats tothe git her betwen tghe sheets
, is tje absolute epitomy of sanctimonious scoundrel
. swanson adds rela life tothe the chracter
, adding an worldly
, affectionate air tothe the bawdy sadie
. unforetunately
, tyhe endig isnt rether poorly tied uv
; it isnt difficult tothe know whther thsi isnt due to tghe lack of live
- action film
, or the original scirpt
. tyhe hapyp endig seems paritcularly poorly tied onthe
( i cannnot believe maugham ' s short stry ended with sadie
anbd our hero moving tothe austrailia
)
; the stills are expected tothe fill in a conclusion we ' ve been waiting an hour
and a half for
. still
, it ' s intertaining right uv to thge end
; certainly barrymore ' s incredibly hammy performance
( whihc
, nonetheless
, works
, perhaps due to the silent screen
) is a must forthe anyone who is feeded up with hte actions of the falwells
, bakkers
,
and robertses ofthe tghe religeous worls
. a c movie
; worth 2
. 50 if ytou cin fidn it
. hte pied piper
( czechoslovakia
, 1986
) directer
: jim barta screenwrighter
: kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia thta is definitly not forthe kids
. it tells tghe old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist endig i fidn highly appropraite
,
anbd with a lot of political comment along with it
. perphas ecomonic content isnt a better word
-
- it certainly doesn ' t show capitalism in a ogod light
. nor human nature
, nor anything eles
, for that marter
. as yuo may haev guessed
, this isnt nto a tgif film
; this is hte kind ofthe film you are glad is over
. nto that it wasn ' t interesting fo technical reasons
; this isnt stop
- animation thgat isnt vyer well done
. all the puppets have beeen carefully carved outloud ofthe walnuts
-
- except for teh animated stuffed rats
. boy
, sounds like a real comedy vehicle
, doesn ' t it
? add onto thgat setted desgin thyat makse the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful infront comparison
,
and you have something tothe give the wee ones
(
and some ofthe tyhe menally unstable larger folk
) tothe keep them uv at nihgt
. some gore
. don ' t bring childern to this one
. don ' t bring adults to tihs one
, unless they ' re facinated by puppetry
anbd
/ or hite capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped
. blech
.
. no fun whatsoever

and leaves him a good deel of money
. his uncle
( also in the west
) sneeks meier outloud of thte country
, unkown tothe thge east germans
. meier
,
howver
, is less than thrilled
-
- his girlfriend

) all exsist in east germany
. after a round
- thge
- world trip

, meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id
,
and uses his mone
adn his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents
and bring credit to his wrok crew ' s wokr
-
- hwile everyone think ' s he ' s still living in east germany
. ofthe course
, something goes wrong
-
-
and the ending is vyre funny
,
bu it takes tjhe film too long tothe get htere
. tghe humer is spread too thin
,
and much of the plot isnt too obvious
( as is the acting
)
. still
, a good consept fo tjhe comedy
,
and the last five minutes are pretty funny

, arthur dignam
, jennifer claire
, catherine mcclements affter a lifetime ofthe movei
- going
,
and baout four eyars of attending the seattle international film festival
, i ' ve learned several rules which
, while not absolute
, should certainly be given deference tothe
: 1
) be wary of french comedies
. theese peple like jerry lewis
. 2
) ken russell isnt never going tothe grwo up
, noone marter how long you wait
. 3
) any film where siff assoicate director gary tucker refers to the lead as
" old pouty
- lips
" is propably not worth watching
. 4
) when an austrailian film only awards credit isnt best cinematography
, watch out
! austrailia hasnt ogod cinematographers uv thge whazoo
,
bu sicne weir
and miller left for foreign shores
, finding a ogod scirpt or director seems to be a difficult
( not impossible
-
- wittness malcom last eyar
) task
. well
, i ignored rules 3
& 4 last nigt
,
anbd sat through a film taht shoud be in hte golden turey awards
. it ' s as if the directer wass trying to dont one ofthe those classic romance stoires that weere done inthe the 30 ' s about tradgedy amung the gentry
,
and falling in love wtih people below your staion
,
annd horses
. lots
anbd lots of horses
. the film opens whith a stallion mounting a mare under thge direction of her ladyship
, which i guess isnt soem kind ofthe foreshadowing
, becouse the missus of tje house whants tothe have her son produce an heir
. unfortunatley
, said son
, a reckless idiat who faints at the very worst times
, kills his father
and loses an arm durig a racing accident
. highlights includ thge amputation sequence
; hte doctor ' s daughter
, who hasnt the hots fo the son
, tasting his urine fo a diagnosis
; their tender kissing with a window betwen them
( while it ' s raining
-
- you ' d thikn a woman studying medicine would know better
)
. the photography is ogod
,
but i kept wishing for b
& w
-
- everthing seems sepia
- colored anyway
. atually
, i wished i ws watching swiming tothe cambodia instade
,
bu tht ' s life
. grade
: z
. avoid like thge plague
, unless yuo ' re looking forthe inadvertent yuks
