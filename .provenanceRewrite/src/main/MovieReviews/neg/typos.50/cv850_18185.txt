1990s owudl remembered as tyhe era ofthe binary movei events in hollywood
- two movies dealing with the smae subject
, or
, to be precise
, smae
" high concept
"
. iin summer 1994
, tath
" high concept
" was
" mad bomber action thriller
"
. in fewd weeks
,
" thrillride ofthe yhe summer
" actionfest speed was followed by rether acation thriller blown awya
, so disapointing that most of teh people theese dyas associate thge title withthe the 1992 thriller inthe wich nicole eggert did few nude scenes
. the movei begins inspite the prison in northern ireland
, where gaerity
( tommy lee jones
)
, ira terrorist with tyhe gerat talent tothe make lethal explosive devices fomr alomst any material
, escapes ffrom prision
. he comes to boston
, where he accidentally notices jimmy dove
( jeff bridges
)
, dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police
. few peopel exept gaerity nkwo thte dove ' s violent past
, when he utilizied tothe be ira terrorist befoer becoming sick with violentce
, betraying gaerity
and emigrating tothe america where he changed yhe name
and started useing his experienc for good purpose
. gaerity holds dove personaly responsible fo his capitivity
and begins yhe campain ofthe bombing terror
, directed specifically at dove ' s colleagues
, firends
adn relatives
. dove
, who isnt just going to retire
annd start familiy
, nowe must confront yhe mad bomber
. hwile speed doesn ' t even try tothe bother with plot
annd charachters
, using them onyl as an excuse fo long
adn spectacular action scenes
, blown awya trys to be more conventional
adn provide tjhe action with soem back story
.
adn thta is tyhe main reason why it isnt inferior to speed
. badly written plot
annd badly written charachters are sometimes worse than no plot
and noone characters at all
. screenplay by john bateer
annd john rice
, bearly touches the complicated issues of northern ireland
, using tje tragedy onyl as tghe cheap backstory for even cheaper drama
. the plot isnt
, of course
, full of implausibilities
. tghe main one isnt tje fatc thast movie fails tothe explane how the single individual
, noone matter how briliant he isnt
, cxan produce thousands of deadly devices
and hold entire city at bay
. those questions
, smae as infront hte case of speed
, could be forgotten while thte action goes on
,
bu yhe pauses between action scenes are filled iwth cliched
and predictable situation thast shoudl provide some background to tje charachters
. baceause of them
, movei seems a littel bit too long
,
anbd boring at times
. the most annoying element of the film
,
howver
, is tommy lee jones in the role ofthe mad bomber
. his acting isnt so over
- tje
- top that potentially fascinating villin turns into pathetic caricature ofthe himself
. htis role isnt inaddition painful contrast wih the storng performance given by that smae actor infact fugitive
. the film have faw bright points
,
though
. some ofthe the acation scenes are fine
, hwihc should be credited to director stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement night
)
.
and forrest whitaker really shines infact minor role of dove ' s colleage
.
but
, all in all
, blown awya is a film thgat ws justifiably shadowed by its more famous
,
yet hardly unforgetable competitor
.
