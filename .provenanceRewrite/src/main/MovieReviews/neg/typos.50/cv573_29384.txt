. review
: there isnt oen reason why
" jurassic park iii
" is better tahn its immediate predecessor
,
" the lost world
: jurassic park
"
. teh latter wasted 129 minutes ofthe my life
; the fromer
, only 94
. tghe firt
" park
" wass a marvellous film
, full ofthe awe
- inspiring sights
, intresting characters
,
and genuine thrills
. its two successors hvea been pale imitations
, amounting tothe hundred
- milion
- dollar b
- grade horror movies
. at least this thrid entry realises it
; wherease
" tghe lost world
" tried to justify its existence wiht a ludicrous
and overextended plot
,
" jurassic park iii
" simpley sticks its charactors on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs
and lets the mayhem begin
. there isnt a despreate sence ofthe deja vu presiding over this movie
; hte coputer
- animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting
,
and even teh first
- time presense of aerial lizards scarcely improves tghe situation
. rember that wondrous first trolley ride thru tje park infact the orginial movie
? nothing in htis rehash even comes close
. add infact execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman
, payne
and taylor
,
anbd phoned
- in performances by yhe normaly capable macy
and leoni
,
annd it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone
bu dino enthusiasts
. at least neill makes smoe efford to retain the dignity ofthe his character
,
and ther isnt much less gore tahn in
" hte lost world
"
, mkaing this installment omre suitable for children
.
