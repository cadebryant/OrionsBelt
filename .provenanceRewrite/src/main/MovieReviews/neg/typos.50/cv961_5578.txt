, pamela anderson lee ' s firt foray into films
, highlights yhe fatc that her onyl talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets
. being the only noteable member of thte cast
, tghe camera lingers lustily o n her body at eveyr opportunity
, mkaing her character ' s catch line
,
" don ' t call me babe
,
" soudn very ironical indeed
. from the vrey oppening of tjhe movie
, we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson
, ending inspite her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes ofthe a lusty male who happended tothe call her babe
. througout tyhe movei
, there is ample footage ofthe enormass breasts
and cleavage
, if not of anderson ' s
,
thne at least ofthe the female extras
. this alone isnt anough tothe retitle yhe movei babe wire
. fo a plot
, barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline
. it is 2017
, the middle ofthe yhe second american civil war
,
and barb wire
, a former resistence fighter
, runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead
(
!
!
)
. known fo attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts
, tjhe bar attracts yhe attention ofthe yhe government forces who apeared dressed in nazi
- sytle uniforms

and his wife get to the airporta onthe the other side of the twon
, past the government
- contolled areas
,
adn tothe freedom
. even the airport looks liek tjhe oney in casablanca
, except that the plane infact thge backround isnt a modern
, private jet
. there are hardly any significant moments in this film
,
and one gets teh impression that it was designed forthe young teenagers familliar with the dark horse comics verzion ofthe
" barb wire
.
" if anything
, one leaves teh film whith the confirmation that anderson di d not dont her own stunts
. who coudl fight
and jump in a skimpy
, strapless leather top
,
annd
yet keep her breasts from spilling outloud
? onyl a stuntwoman
