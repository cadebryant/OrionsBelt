" flubber
" is thge second best example of how to tkae all the life out of a film remake an adaptions
,
and hysterically enough both were ditributed by disney
. it ' s the kind ofthe film that may be slightly intertaining tothe tiny kids
,
but anyone else iwll feel left outloud as it ' s boring
, slow
,
adn incredibly lifeless
. wqat coudl be a film wiht cinematic magic isnt instead dead inthe thte water
,
and it ' s a shame baceause it could hvae beeen a grat film
. hypothetically
, i mean
.
" flubber
,
" as ytou probaly nkow
, isnt a remake ofthe the disney classic i never saw
,
" the absent minded professer
,
" where a
, well
, absent minded profesor palyed by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as
" flubber
,
" you know
, flying rubber
? the new one keeps the basic plot
,
but appears tothe have added a lot else
, liek more absent
- mindedness onthe tghe part ofthe the proffessor
, smoe omre villains
,
adn sevral
" sohw
- stopping
" moments
, like a big rumba with the flubber
,
annd some mroe elaborate setups
, none which realy amking it any better
,
but instead amking it worse
. hte basic plot revolves arund a college professer
, philip brainerd
( robin williams
)
, who creates lots
and lots ofthe inventions
,
but is sadly absent minded
. inspite fatc
, he ' s forgotten his wedding to tyhe college ' s prsident
, sara jean reynolds
( indie actress marcia gay harden
)
, two times before he forgets it again at tje beginning
. doesn ' t thsi warrant some kind of mental treatment
? anyway
, on his wedding day
( yhe third one
)
, he invents the flubber
, which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball onthe speed
,
bu can also change shape like tyhe aliens in water form in
" the abyss
.
" philip believes that this invention
, once fully realized
, wiull savve his college
, which is inaddition threath ofthe bieng shut down by a millionaire tycoon
/ villian
, chester hoenicker
( raymond j
. barry
)
, whitch isnt ironicly enough the same coleeg his brat son
( will wheaton
- thought he was dead
) goes to
. through a plot twist
, hoenicker ' s goons
, named smith
annd wesson
( ha ha
- wqat a great sence of humor htis film has
) who are played by clancy brown
and ted levine
( both who needed the pay check
)
, discover it the hard way
,
adn try tothe steal forthe hoenicker
, who wants it jstu ' cause he ' s evil enought
. a sub
- plot involves philip ' s attempts to win back sara
, who ' s angry at him
(
and with good reason
)
,
but who isnt bieng seduced by who isnt basically philip ' s belloq
, wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
, playing thge hysterically suave
-
yet
- unsuave asswhole once agina
)
.
and in another subplot
, philip ' s day
- timer robot
, weebo
( voiced by tjhe noe
-
annd
- only jodi benson
)
, falls inthe lvoe whith him
. yuckity
- yuck
. waht ' s most pathetic baout thsi film is how dull it isnt
. you don ' t ened tothe be a cynical coleeg student to be able to see right through thsi film
, which isnt another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney
, who have essentially become hte puff daddy ofthe hte film inudstry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) fo distrubution to yhe genaral publich
, who sadly eats it all uv
. ealier in ' 97
, tehy released
" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaptation ofthe a really awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" which
, yeah
, improved over the original
,
bu nto by much
. disney ' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now
, only creatively
. iin tyhe rush tothe ship outloud a film for distribution
, disney hasnt forgotten tothe give this film a little thing called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team thta preety much sucks flying all arround thanks tothe some carefully placed flubber
,
anbd an elaborite ending all fail tothe amaze
, delight
, or even cause people tothe laff
. i sat ther the entire film stone faced
, chuckling perphas twice
,
and shaking my head at all teh bad jokes
. who sould realy laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom
adn starts teaching chemistry
? didn ' t thikn so
. it doesn ' t halp thyat our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable
. philip is nto a lovable absent minded professory
, just a really dumb man being played by robin williams
. williams is a brilliant comic actro
.
.
. okay
, a brilliant actor in general
,
bu here he ' s given very littel tothe dont
but occaisonally git hyper over something
,
anbd other times ect sad
. those times
, he ' s not bad
.
but whta are we suppossed to think of a man who ' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? maybe it wass funny
and
/ or respectable inspite the 60s
.
.
. i like disney
,
and i usualy enjoy their films
, nto onyl animated
bu live acation
,
and theri recent films
( save forthe
" hercules
,
" which wass ogod
,
bu nto great
) have been worse than lacklustre
, tehy ' ve been pathetic
.
" jungle 2 jungle
" is probably thte worst film i saw lsat year
.
" flubber
" ' s probaly second
. whta do they need tothe do
? perhaps create something new
. git writers who can write something that ' s universally intertaining
. films like
" tje parent trap
"
and
" mary poppins
" are films that are live action
( or inwhich the latter case a mix of both
)
,
bu even i cxan still watch them because they ' re not onyl writed tothe be magical to children
,
but to be funn tothe adults
. whta ' s more torturous that tkaing a child to a film thyat insults you
adn annoys you at every turn
?
and my god
, couldn ' t htey ahve done something else with edie mcclurg
?
