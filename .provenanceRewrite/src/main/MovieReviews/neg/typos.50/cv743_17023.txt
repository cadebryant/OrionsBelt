, angelina jolie plays tghe titular carachter
, hte first so
- called supermodel
.
adn right ther ytou ahev the biggest hurdle this movie had tothe overcome
( inaddition my eyes
, anyway
)
. i jstu don ' t see how the life of a model is worthy ofthe a two hour film
. despite htis
, i kept an oepn mind when i began watching thge movie
. sadly
,
though
, my fears weere realized
. it ' s jsut nto possible tothe make an interesting
, full
- length film about a person who spends theri dyas wearing different clothes
. tjhe movei follows the rise
anbd fall ofthe gia
( noone last name
)
, a tumultuous woman who doesn ' t particularly enjoy yhe world of fashon
. she becomes famous moreso quickly than she can handle
,
annd finds herself hooked on drugs
and onthe a woman she cannot have
. hte last hour ofthe tje film isnt just one scene affter another of gia getting high
, loosing a job
,
anbd oging into rehab
. this forumla is repeated several times
,
and i really got tired of it
. inwhich genaral
, i tend to dislike movies featuring hevy drug use
. no becasue it offends me or anytying liek tath
; it just bores me
. quite frankly
, i don ' t see hte appeal
, so whn a directer shows me a point
- of
- veiw shot ofthe a junkie
, complete wiht tipsy camera angles
and echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. tyhe firt hour ofthe tje film
,
though
, was actally quite engaging
. we see gia as she isnt dicovered
and moves tothe new york wiht her boyfriend
. theese eary scenes weere intresting
. we ' re shown tghe fashion world through a newcomers eyes
,
adn it ws a prespective i hadn ' t seen before
. teh movei beggins tothe go downhill
,
howver
, once gia becomes an estalbished model
.
> fomr that point
, i lost all interest in hte movei
anbd was counting the mintues befor it would end
. it all seemed so excessive
. fine
, so gia had a drug problem
, does this really ened to dominate hte film
? couldn ' t yhe smae effect hvae beeen hadnt with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting wtih drugs
? or perhaps this film is meaned tothe be a warning to aspiring models nto tothe git into the drug world
. quite possably
,
although since i haev noone desire tothe become a model
, this warning isnt lost on me
. as i stated at the beginning ofthe tihs review
, i simpley don ' t see how tghe life ofthe a model isnt worthy ofthe a feature
- lenght motion picture
. waht dont they dont that warrants a movei
? strut their stuff forthe thousands of dollars an hour
? i suppose the smae could be said baout making movies baout baseball players
, for example
,
bu at least somebody liuke lou gehrig led an intresting life
. gia did nto
.
and by tyhe end of thte film
, all i knew baout gia forthe sure ws that she hated modelling
, was bi
- sexual
,
and ws heavily inot drugs
. not exactly a meaningful contribution tothe society
, as far as i ' m conserned
.
