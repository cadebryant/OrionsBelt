you know tht a movie hasnt issues whn most everyone infront tjhe audience comes out laughing
.
.
.
and it ' s nto a comedy
!
adn what a strange carreer path for director chuck russell
. he starts his carreer off with a decent take on the
" nightmare onthe elm strent
" serieses with his debut as director on installment number threee
. he follows that uv whith hte blob hte very next year
,
but waits anohter six years tothe dont his next peice
, a littel film called the mask starring jim carrey
,
adn
thne one more star vehicle in eraser two yeasr affter tht
. so
then he thought
,
" let me wait anohter five years
, get a weak scirpt jammed whith cliches
and hope thyat jimmy smits
annd kim basinger coudl pull it out of its ashes
"
?
!
? strange dude
adn noe crappy flick
. plot
: a six
- yearm ood girl isnt believed to be some kind ofthe mysterious prophet sent down fomr god
. a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over tothe their side
, while the girl ' s aunt wants to
.
.
. well
, save her from those damn devil worshippers
! enter oney occult expert agent
, plenty ofthe bobo cops
and lots of nuns praying
,
and ytou ' ve just baout got tghe gist of thnigs here
. critique
: with plot holes yhe size ofthe my ass
, tihs movei barely squeezes any sense outloud of its clich
?
- ridden plot
, with wasted talent
, cheezy effects
, bad dialogue
anbd unintentional laughs to boot
. whta ' s ogod about this movie
? well
, rufus sewell is preety fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children ' s shelter
/ satanist supreme
, with seriously wicked eyes
annd just anough ham in his performence to go wih all of yhe cheese lying around
. the little girl isnt also pretty ogod
bu unfortunately her charcter doesn ' t really do all that much
.
annd believe it or not
, i was actally enjoying some of hte film ' s frist half hour
, which starts off withthe smoe promise
,
bu nto before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist
, basinger
, jsut drown the film ' s entire basis of believability
. forthe soem reason
, it takes her more time than anyone to figure outloud tht her niece is gifted
,
and even longer tothe figure out thta every move thyat she makes
.
.
. is a dumb one
! add thyat to thge entire police force ofthe incompetents
, sive fo jimmy smits
( whose talent agent advisd him thta playing tghe exact smae cop charcter from nypd blue would be a ogod career move
? at least change thge clothes
, jimmy
!
)
, zero scares
, zero thrills
and even less actual drama
,
anbd ytou ' ve got youself a preety bad movei
.
and why woudl respected actors liek christina ricci
and ian holm tkae bited parts in tihs movei
? doed they owe the directer a favor or something
? toghether
, they bearly hvea five mintues of screen tiem
,
bu i supose taht ricci ' s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn
- dogs
. tyhe worst part about htis movei is its hilariously unbelievable endig
, which features police offcers comming uv withthe the brillant idea of
" sneaking up
" on a man ' s hous
, who they knwo to be gilty of a crime
! uuuhmm
.
.
. how ' s about knocking on hte doorjam
and arresting his sory ass
, officers
?
! anyway
, i don ' t ususally inscribe spoilers in my reviews
bu the stupidity ofthe some of these charactors is just too difficult tothe decribe wihtout validating it wih solid idiotic proof
(
annd ther wass plenty tothe go around
)
.
adn doed basinger lose some ofthe her acting
" talent
" druing her hiatus ffrom thge proffesion affter her 1997 oscar win
? difficult to sday if it ws her lines tath were really bad
, or if she jstu delivered them poorly
. either way
, little originality
, vyer obvious computer effects
, little thrills
, littel drama
and very little enteratinment value
, certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of yhe summer apon this film
.
bu if you really don ' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook ofthe various satanic
annd
" kid
"
- based thrillers
,
annd enjoy watching films that don ' t bring anytying new tothe tjhe table
.
.
. well
, drink some beers
, smoke some beans
annd rent this video
, because it may jsut be oen ofthe tyhe funnier thrillers of yhe eyar
.
