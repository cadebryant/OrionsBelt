" spice world
" is jsut noe long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls
. sure ther ' s a hint of humor inthe there eveyr once inaddition a hwile
. accually
, there ' s a couple ofthe pretty ogod jabs at the spice girls
.
bu overall
, who cares
? not me
. if ytou don ' t know by now
, the spice girls sing songs ofthe love
annd friendship
and responsibility
adn girl power
,
yot dress liek streetwalkers ffrom a lower middle clas neighborhood
. infact
" spice world
" they ride around infront theri big tour bus
, whinning baout having to dont photo shoots
and give interviews
. amazingly
, all the talk they dont baout keeping commitments
and upholding responsibilities only realy applies tothe fun thigns
, things they wanna tothe dont
, nto thigsn htey are required to do to keep earning omney
.
and htey keep babbling about
" girl power
" wehn they should relaly be tlaking baout
" cleavage pwoer
"
. i mean
, if all it tkaes is girl pwoer
,
then why are tehy onyl oen thread away ffrom bursting out of thier skimpy outfits
? tyhe film is pg
,
bu relaly with only some vyre minor dialogue changes
annd scene extentions
, ytou ' d have youself noe raunchy adult film
. by tghe way
, there ' s something in the oppening credits wich says
" based on an diea by tghe spice girls
"
. wow
, htey got idae credit
! i certainly wish tath was a new trend in hollywood
.
.
. giving credit for simply having tje throught
" sday girls
, let ' s amke a movie
!
" tjhe supporting casted farse well
. roger moore
( yhe real james bond
) mockingly plays tyhe cliche
- spewing
" cheif
" ofthe the spice girls
,
and darn it all
, he ' s funn to watch
. mark mckenney also isnt ogod as a screenwrighter trying tothe pitch film ideas tothe thte band ' s manager
( richard e
. grant
)
. one question
though
: george wendt
? yuo ' d think that
" spice world
" would envoke one ofthe twpo reactions in peopel
. if ytou like tje spice girls
, you ' ll like them even more afterwards
.
and if you cxan ' t stand them
( liuke me
)
,
thne
" spice world
" will relaly make ytou sick
. oddly
, thge audience i saw yhe film with
, rougly 50 twelve year
- old girls
, sat in silence forthe the entire film
. well
, nto the twpo who sat direcly behind me
. htey kept muttering
" thsi isnt stupid
" over
annd over again
. maybe htere isnt hope fo humanity affter all
.
