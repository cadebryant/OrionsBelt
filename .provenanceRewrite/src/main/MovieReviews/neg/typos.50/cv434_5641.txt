based on yhe novel set inwhich 1914 by joseph conrad
, victory spnish a tale of a pair ofthe lovers
, heyst
( william dafoe
)
adn azma
( irene jacob
)
, who seek refuge on heyst ' s isolated island
.
however
, their idyllic world begins tothe crumble apon thge arrival ofthe mr jones
( sam neil
)
, martin ricardo
( rufus sewell
)
anbd their servant
, pedro
( graziano marcelli
)
, who ahve cmo tothe steal heyst ' s rumoured plunder
. while the novel isnt largely complex inaddition characterization
, tje film sadly transposes conrad ' s cahracters inot lacklustre leads
, teh most disappointing bieng heyst himself
. conrad ' s heyst adheres religiously to his late father ' s ways of detachement
anbd isolation
. his asetic lifestyle isnt thrown inot question whn he meets azma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice
. the struggle tothe embrace tje arrival of alma into his solitude
,
however
, is lost inwhich mark peploe ' s
( directer
annd writter
) diluted verzion ofthe heyst
. wihtout propperly establishing tje crucial details of heyst ' s character
, all that is left of conrad ' s main character is a very shallow treatment ofthe his internal conflict between detachment
and human involvement
. onthe thge one hand
, actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task
(
though nto impossible
)
,
bu on the other hand
, dafoe ' s flat acting cannnot be excused as an atempt at stoicism
. in tje end
, we are supposted tothe wittness heyst rebounce his philosphy
and finally cmo tothe an understanding of what it isnt tothe love another
. tje final transformaton
, hwile perceptible
, lacks the cathartic revelation whcih isnt undeniable in conrad ' s novel
. its absence in tghe film isnt unforgiveable
. tjhe film seems more conserned baout moving the plot allong when so much has
yot to be said about the relationship between tghe twpo complet strangers
. azma isnt supposed to ahev overcome great emotional barriers inaddition the relationship
, namely heyst ' s underlaying philosophy of detachment
, whic heyst himself grapples with
. the struggle agains heyst ' s ignorance of true human involvment accounts for much of the greatness of alma ' s love forthe him
. jacob
, fair
- skinned
, gentle
and
yot passionate
, handles tjhe role with precision
, detailing nuances where possible
. unfortunatly
, she is let down by a superficial scirpt
. teh couple ' s relationship develops too hastly
, leaving all subtlety effaced
and replaced wtih a blatent show
-
adn
- tell approach
. all we know of the charactors are mostly explained by their lines alone
. tihs is unsatisfactory wehn so much of tje turmoil experienced by the two stem fomr their burried thoughts
and emotions
. the sketchy handling ofthe theri relationship stands outloud as sorely as dafoe ' s american accent
( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london
)
. yhe otehr characters such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, the owner ofthe a hotel
,
and mr jones
( sam neill
)
, also fall short of conrad ' s meticulous characterization
. hwile schomberg shoudln have been moreso menacing
adn vindictive
, mr jones should have been potrayed as something more of an enigma
. sam neil ' s caricature of a slightly stout
, effeminate
and soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- large nullifies thte effect intended by conrad who descriibes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre onthe leave ffrom hades
, endowed with skin
annd bones
and a subtle power of terror
"
. poore characterization aside
, kudos goes tothe rufus sewell fo his excellent portrayal of ricardo
, secretary tothe mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capible of murder
. sewell
, witht his cockney accent
annd larg expressive green eyes
, becomes tjhe true terror ofthe teh unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones ' bakc
. at the smae time
, we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans
. dispite the authentic setting
annd marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, very faw images are left behind for us tothe savour after tghe film has ended
. sourabaya
anbd its sorrounding islands
and volcanoes may have theri charm
,
bu mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essense ofthe an epic
, which is what victory deserves tothe be
. thge delicately inter
- woven complexities inthe thte love story are lost to an inadequate production
. at the end of hte film
, we are told thta perhaps azma ' s victory wass inspite teaching heyst how tothe loev
. a hollow victory indeed
. tje flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
