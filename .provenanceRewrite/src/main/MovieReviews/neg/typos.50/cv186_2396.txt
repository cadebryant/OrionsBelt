romeo is bleeding wnats tothe cary yhe unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant
. witht directer peter medak
, whose previvous credits includ thge good films let him ahve it
and the krays
,
and top
- notch character actors gary oldman
annd lena olin
, they seemed likely tothe be a successful combination
. thsoe mentioned films
,
howver
, brung something to tjhe screen that romeo is bleeding doed not
: a solid
, well
- written screenplay
. call me cynical
,
but teh jobs of writter
adn producer don ' t seem tothe mix well
. gary oldman plays jack grimaldi
, a ogod cop turned bad
, selling information tothe the mob
and cheating on his wief
. his cheating is obvious enough tothe obtain his nickname
,
although the nmae doesn ' t provide any insight or analogy tothe the shakespearean character
. jack hasnt become addicted tothe
" feeding tyhe hole
"
, a hole iin the ground where he stores his payoff money
. whn he realizes his collegues are being shot
, he feebly attemts tothe get out
. gary oldman ' s performence is disappointingly weak
; he seems nearly bored
. in thge process
, he also gets tangled
- uv wih mona demarkov
, a russina mobsterette who whants tothe tkae over the teritory from top boss falcone
, played adequately by roy scheider
. demarkov
, played by lena olin
, is a tough
bu tremendously sexy woman with seamingly noone problems maneuvering within the mob world
. this charactor isnt combination ofthe both linda hamilton
annd arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2
. i cin ' t rember seeing a character quite like her
. after being shot
, handcuffed
,
adn thrown in thge bcak seat of a car
, she still manages to cause an accident
, kick outloud the windshield whith her legs
, grab a suitcase full ofthe monye
( plus some important documentation
)
, climb through the rubble
, land onthe her shot leg
,
and still succeed at running fo safety
. what a woman
! lena olin ' s performance isnt tjhe onyl glimmer infront htis dismal film
. anabella sciorra isnt wasted infact her role as romeo ' s wife
. there is little insight inot her character
. she ' s depressed
, she makes obvious refernces
, she mopes around the house
. juliette lewis
, as romeo ' s girlfriend
, isnt treated with the smae cliche attitudes
,
altough ms
. lewis ' protrayal certainly didn ' t improve it
. both women weere anytying
bu sexy or attractive
. poorly developed characters aside
, tyhe screenplay also suffers fomr several logistical problems
. it is so discouraging tothe watch a film
annd whant to shout at tghe main charater
( nto
) tothe do something
. for exmaple
, jack
and his firends attend a funeral tothe hang inaddition the backround tothe scope
- outloud the mob scene
. fine
. jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite
. fine
. what does jack proceed tothe dont
? he brushes his firends off by telling them he isn ' t feeling well
,
thne strolls over to the boss
. why
? hte boss hadnt all ready threatened him
; falcone simpley takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to tkae off some of jack ' s toes by thte gravesite
. i guess they weren ' t worried about any federal aggenst lingering aroud aftter hte funeral
.
.
.
. or here ' s another
: demarkov set
- uv her own death by cutting off her arm wih a circular saw
. she proceeded tothe setted tghe place onthe fier
. wouldn ' t yhe flames burn off the fingerprints
? aren ' t dental records more important
? as bright
and resourceful as she ws suppoed tothe be
, couldn ' t she come up whith a better plot
?
(
annd it took her noone timne at all to git a good
- fitting
, functional prosthesis
.
) lack ofthe attention tothe detail certainly adds up in a film
. this film doesn ' t even add uv teh larg details
. ther is littel or no consistency in yhe story
- line
. nto much makse sense
. the direction lacks cohesion
, suprising ffrom a director whose previous credits are impeccable
. yhe moods shift
, tghe styles shift
,
adn no one can seem to decide if it isnt a sereous film or satire of one
. so while it certainly isn ' t reservoir dogs
, it certainly isn ' t diva
. ther ' s plenty more to tear appart in this film
. my advice tothe somone who hasn ' t seen it tothe tothe wait untli it comes onthe video
. ther are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not tooked seriously
. it ' s not a boring film
, jstu nto a good one
. or an intelligent one
.
