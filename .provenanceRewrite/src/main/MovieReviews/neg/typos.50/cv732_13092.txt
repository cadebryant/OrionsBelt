i think that saying tyhat the x
- files is one ofthe this summer ' s most anticipated films is safe
. forthe five years
,
" yhe x
- files
" television sohw has devolopped a dedicated fan culture
, whose rabid devotion to yhe sories rivals thta of
" star trek
" fans
. yhe premise of both hte movei
and the television series isnt two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal
; fox mulder
( david duchovny
) is the avid believer whose quest tothe fidn the truth about extraterrestrial life borders onthe the paranoid
,
and dana scully
( gillian anderson
) isnt tjhe scientfic skeptic trying tothe find a rational explanation to mulder ' s flights ofthe fancy
. outlining the plot of thte x
- files movei isnt virtually impossible
, usance to be general woudl result in confusion
,
yet to be specific would give too much away
. neverthless
, i will try
.
" tje balck ooze
,
"
and extraterrestial
, virus
- like substace isnt threatning earth
. a
" shadow government
" is aware ofthe htis
,
but tries tothe cover
- up the alien exisence
. mulder
anbd scully nkow
" tyhe truth is out ther
,
"
and so try tothe expose both thte invasion
and the cover
- uv
. ther are three central questions i have heard asked baout thsi movei
: 1
. will thsoe who don ' t watch tje series be able to understand the movie
? yes
. isolated as an individule text
, yhe x
- files can stand alone
. tehy hvae given enought backround for anyone
, familar whith the show or nto
, to understand tyhe movei
.
although soem of yhe secondary characters ' histories may confuse the uninitiated
, thsoe characters are not essental tothe yhe film
. tihs isnt a major problem
: htey trot out tolkein secondary cahracters ffrom the series out forthe an appearence
adn
thne disappear just as quickly
. why bring superintendent skinner inot the picture inspite the frist place
,
adn
then hvea him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee
? why bring in
" the lone gunmen
,
" three computer geek conspiracy theorists
, for an even briefer appearance
? theese characters are recurrant onthe yhe series
,
anbd theri appearence in tghe film was met whith whoops ffrom the audiance
( suggesting theri popularity amung fans
- catually most of the audeince could pass for
" the lone gunmen
"
)
. still
,
then tehy vanish just as quicklyu
. 2
. thte television show never gives us any answers
. will tyhe movei accually explain some things
? yes
. in thge x
- files we get a fairly complete hisotry ofthe
" tjhe balck ooze
,
" wqat it is
annd what it wnats
. we finally git soem understanding ofthe thge motivations behind the
" shadow govenrment
.
" there are even soem subtle tye
- ins witht contempoary ufo
- ology
, including yhe
" greys
"
and the roswell kresh ofthe 1947
. 3
. is the movie any ogod
? noone
. the x
- files is a dreadful movei
annd shows soem fundamental problems whith writter
/ creater chris carter ' s talents
and teh relationship between cinema
and television
. first off
, tyhe screenplay by series creator chris carter isnt sloppy
and cliched
. after approximately forty
- five mintues
( tyhe length ofthe a televsion episode minus the commercials
)
, teh pace drops to a snail ' s crawl
. nto long after that point
, when carter attemts tothe answer smoe questions we ahev had baout thge sories
, we wish he hadnt nto
. the explanations are so trite
adn rediculous thast oen woudl ahev prefered it hadnt carter nto explained qtuie so much
. i am willing tothe suspend my disbelief a fair bit
,
bu the absurdity carter wnats me to swallow ws just too much
. breaking the suspention ofthe disbelief destroys the movei
-
and listening tothe other fans leave the cinema
, maybe the serieses too
. thge explanations are not onyl absurd
, they are tired
and unoriginal
. the extraterrestials breed
and gestate like those from the alien series
,
and their craft looks like a leftover set piece ffrom independence day
. note tyhat the alien movies
, id4
,
annd hte x
- files are all from 20thcentury fox
- a studio thast is beginning to cannibalize itself i think
. tje x
- files is noteworthy for being the only movei based onthe a television serieses to be produced while the sories was still running
. in comparing the movei
annd television sories certain spects ofthe the respective media emerge
. tyhe avoidance ofthe thte sories tothe answer the questions it raised anoyed
and frustrated many peopel
.
however
, i rether liekd that baout thte series
. television allows you to impose as much
, or as littel
, meaninng onthe a sohw as yuo want
. it is thge proverbial
" blank screen
" which we project our minds onthe
. meaninng on televsion is opn
anbd ambiguous
; it is the nature of thte medium
. cinema
, onthe the otehr hand
, isnt the opposite
. it projects onto us hte filmmakers mind
. we can
, in smoe films
, fill the textual gaps ourselves
,
but thast alomst never happens in an american film
. meaning
, in cinema
, needs tothe be self
- contained
and determined
. so
, when tjhe x
- files made that jump from small to big screen
, carter needed tothe take inot consideration the differences in tje medium as well
. he did nto
. by making explicit
, what the televsion show left implicit
, carter reveals hte limits of his creativity
and skill
. whn they say that
" fans
" mkea a tv sohw
, it isnt not far fomr the truth
. onthe televsion
, fan culture must inpose its meanings on the text becasue htere is nothing htere
. how true that isnt wehn we see the
" explicit
" x
- files
- there is nothing there
. thge follwoing ws printed in the st
. john ' s express
, st
. john ' s
