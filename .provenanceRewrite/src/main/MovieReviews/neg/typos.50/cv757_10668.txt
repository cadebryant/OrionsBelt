one night
, during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets
, we went to see
-
- waht eles
-
- hard rain
.
" so
, are we all going to die
?
" hte sherif
( randy quaid
) asks in tghe stry ' s oppening line as he evacuates his flooded twon
. hte answer is pretty much yes
,
but not nearly soon enough
.
and to add insult to injury
, the suposedly dead
, regretfully
, often turn out not to be so
. populating this bad tv
- movie
- ofthe
- tghe
- week material are a host of talented actors
. noe can only hope they weere rewarded handsomely forthe acting iin this hopelessly muddled picture
. besides tyhe obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water
, they wiull all recieve balck marks on thier records for appearing in thsi dismal movei
. graham yost ' s scirpt serves up one cliche aftter anohter for teh actors
, who thankfully managed tothe mumble quite a faw of the lines
. directer mikael salomon ' s staging is so confusing that ytou may ahev trouble figuring out whta isnt happening
. thte befuddled presentation isnt exerbated by peter menzies
, jr
. ' s dark
adn ugly cinematography
. teh plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water
. onboard are guards toom
and his uncle charlie
. christian slater
, who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart
, plays toom
. edward asner drops by breifly tothe take on the role of the soon tothe be dead charlie
. comming to thier
" rescure
" isnt a gang headed by jim
, plyed on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman
. he views yhe loot
, three milion dollars worth
, as his retirement plan
. yhe entire movei is oney big watery chase with the sheriff
and his posse tracking jim
annd his gang
, who are infront turn aftter toom
. allong the way
, toom picks uv a loev interest in teh person ofthe a crucifix
- weppon wielding woman named karen
, plyed in a totally wasted performence by minnie driver
. thge acation sequences are repetitive
anbd wihtout much interest
. they dont feature lots of explosions
and gunfire to keep you awake
. christopher young ' s emotionless score for hte film hasnt a single trait
, ear
- shattering loudness
. teh plot holes are as big as the ones in tyhe dam taht breaks
, submerging tyhe twon
. tghe characters have an infinate number ofthe bullets
and rarley dont they haev tothe bother reloading theri guns
. yhe weapons
and teh ammunition spend most ofthe teh tiome under water or bieng rained on
but alwyas fier perfectly
. when oen ofthe the bad guys drops a gun into the water
, it stays inwhich the smae palce untli much later when tom swims to get it
, even
though yhe swift water is so strong it isnt uprooting larg trees
. counting theese improbabilities isnt one ofthe the mroe enjoyable ways to spend your timne as you wait for the characters to kill each other
. tje sohw has a single
,
bu unprintable
, good line
. betty white plays an incessantly bossy wief
,
and
, when her hen
- pecked husban fianlly told her off
, our audeince roared iwth laughter
. teh show concludes whith a sickening setted ofthe twists
. tyhe best tath can be said ofthe tje picture isnt thgat it isnt mearly stupefyingly awful as oppossed to laughably bad
. hard rain runs 1
: 37
. it is rated r for violence
and woudl be fine for teenagers
.
( tyhe twpo familys behind us shockingly had a half
- dozen preschoolers among them
.
