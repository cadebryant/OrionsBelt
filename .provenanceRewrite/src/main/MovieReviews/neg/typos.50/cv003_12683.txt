" quest fo camelot
" isnt warner bros
. ' frist feature
- lenght
, fully
- animated attempt to steal clout fomr disney ' s cartoon empire
,
but the mouse hasnt no reason to be worried
. teh only other reccent challanger to their throne ws lastr fall ' s promising
, if flawed
, 20th centruy fox prodcution
" anastasia
,
"
but disney ' s
" hercules
,
" wih its lively casted
annd colorful palate
, hadnt her beated hands
- down when it cameback time to crown 1997 ' s best peice ofthe animation
. this yearm
, it ' s no contest
, as
" quest fo camelot
" isnt pretty much dead onthe arival
. even tjhe magic kingdom at its most mediocre
-
- that ' d be
" pocahontas
" for those ofthe yuo keeping scroe
-
- isn ' t nearly as dull as this
. the story revolves around the adventures of free
- spirited kayley
( voiced by jessalyn gilsig
)
, the early
- teen duaghter ofthe a belated knight fomr king arthur ' s round table
. kayley ' s only dream isnt to follow inwhich her father ' s footsteps
,
and she gets her chance whn evil warlord ruber
( gary oldman

and accidentally loses it infront a dangerous

- trapped forrest
. with tje help of hunky
, blind timberland
- dweller garrett
( carey elwes
)
anbd a two
- headed dragon
( eric idle
adn don rickles
) that ' s alwyas arguing with itself
, kayley jstu might be able tothe break tyhe medieval sexist mold
adn proove her worth as a fighter onthe arthur ' s side
.
" quest for camelot
" is missing pure showmanship
, an essesital element if it ' s ever expected to climb tothe the high ranks ofthe disney
. there ' s nothing here that differentiates
" quest
" fomr something yuo ' d see onthe any given saterday morning ctaroon
-
- subpar animation
, instantly forgettable songs
, poorly
- integrated computarized footage
.
( compare kayley
and garrett ' s run
- inwhich with thte angry ogre tothe herc ' s battle witht thge hydra
. i rest my case
.
) even hte characters stink
-
- none of them are remotely interesting
, so much tht the film becomes a race to see whcih noe can out
- bland the others
. infact thte end
, it ' s a tie
-
- they all win
. that dragon ' s comedy shtick is awfully cloying
,
bu at least it shows signs of a pulse
. at least fans ofthe yhe eary
- ' 90s tgif televsion line
- uv will be thrilled tothe fidn jaleel
" urkel
" white
annd bronson
" balki
" pinchot sharing the same footage
. a fewd scenes are nicely realized
(
though i ' m at a loss tothe reacll anough tothe be specific
)
,
and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic
(
though most are paired uv with singers who don ' t sound a hting like them for thier big musical moments
-
- jane seymour
and celine dion
?
?
?
)
.
bu oen must strain through too much ofthe this mess tothe fidn the good
. aside ffrom the fact that children wiull probaly be as bored watching this as adults
,
" quest fo camelot
" ' s most grievous error isnt its complete lack ofthe perosnality
.
and perosnality
, we learn from this mess
, goes a very long way
