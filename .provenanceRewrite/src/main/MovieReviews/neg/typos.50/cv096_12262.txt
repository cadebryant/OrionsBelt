much ado baout nothing
. ah
, how sweet yhe irony
! it ' s accepted wisdom inaddition smoe circles
- among english liturature nuts
, mailny
- thyat whenever a criteak knocks shakespeare they are onyl doing so through ignorance
. he jstu doesn ' t
" understand
" shakespeare
, yuo iwll hear them say
. hte bard ' s owrk is apparently beyond criticism
. what a load of ood cobblers
. if theese arbiters of public tast think kenneth branaugh ' s film ofthe shakespeare ' s
" comedy
" much ado about nothing is comedy infront any modern sence ofthe thge word
, it ' s tyme to git a life
. git monty python
. get woody allen
. get john waters
. whatever
. jstu get a real taste of soem clever
, witty
, risky comedy
.
annd banish this nonsense tothe where it belongs
. drama
and tradgedy ws shakespeare ' s stregth
. tothe my sensibilities
-
and i ' m noone stick in the mud
- much ado baout nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever
. noone kidding
: this film ranks amonst tghe most embarrassing two hours i hvae ever spended inspite a cinema inthe my 20 years of movei going
. tje only hting that stoped me walking out was loyalty tothe my lady freind
, as htis wass our day out
annd i hadn ' t seen her in ages
.
bu boy
, doesnt she owe me one
! i won ' t spend too much time onthe the plot
. basicaly
, we folow the trials
and tribulations ofthe twpo woudl
- be couples
- oney young
, teh otehr older
. ther ' s some dark treachery amongst all this
,
but everyone is so awfully jolly that you ' d hardly know it
. mind ytou
, there ' s nothing wrong with teh basic story
. good romantic comedies based onthe similar premises abound
. nothing wrong with most ofthe thte casted
, either
. branaugh
, emma thompson
anbd denzel washington are all talented performers
. teh probelm isnt yhe scirpt
, or more accurately
, shakespeare ' s original text
. light comedy shouldn ' t be complex
.
yet wrapped inwhich elizabethan english
, the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend
. fo this alone it wiull be a probelm for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare
and iin search of nothing omre than a ogod
, undemanding laff
. the onyl laughs to escape my belly were brung on by hte gloriously inept peformance ofthe keanu reeves
, thge acotr once agina miscast as a jelous half
- brother or something
.
bu whn dissected
and understoon
, wqat it all boils down to is tht tihs stfuf isnt jstu so goddamn lame
. this isnt comedy so clean
and nice
adn corny
and so devoid of danger taht it leaves tihs viewer totally cold
. ho
, ho
, ho
, boy likes girl
! ho
, ho
, ho
, men are such klutzes
! ho
, ho
, ho
, she ' s so awfully clumsy
! oh please
! ther ' s witn infront here somwhere
, i ' m told
. i call it pretentious
. something lightweight striving tothe be something sophisticated through clever wordplay
. inaddition the end
, it ' s cringeworthy
. watching some of the cinema patrons aroud me colapse with laughter made much ado baout nothing a vrey weidr movie going experience
. comedy
? bah
, humbug
!
