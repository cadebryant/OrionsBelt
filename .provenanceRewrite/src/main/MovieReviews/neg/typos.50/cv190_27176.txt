.
.
. tihs isnt aftter twpo housr of throwing peopel out windows
annd shooting more people than your averege serial killer
. nobody cant savve thsi bomb from it ' s own stupidity
and arrogance in filmmaking
annd arrogance infact beleiving thta tihs isnt a positive religous
- type ofthe film
. it ' s just a pile of dreck
.
.
. an ill
- concieved exploitive project
, a pyrotechnical film
.
" end ofthe dyas
" aims tothe be an apocalyptic thriller
. it features an idiotic script
, a hack directer
,
and a noe
- dimensional star who isnt past his prime
.
.
. whic mkaes tihs film dumber than dumb
, plus it ' s not funny
, nto campy
, or is it infact thte least bited entertaining
. it ' s jstu dreary
annd unwatchable
.
.
. a big
- budget slasher film
. arnold plays an alchoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life isnt to stpo satan
( occupying gabriel byrne ' s body
adn possesing a wall st
. bank account
) fomr destroying thge world
. teh film opens in vatican city
, roma 1979
-
- where the pope is alerted by a young visonary priest tomaso
, looking outloud at the nihgt sky
and seing a comet whiz by
, who proclaims aftter looking at his scrolls
-
- that ' s the sign for the ' eye ofthe god
, ' whihc reveals that a child hasnt beeen born who isnt being prepared tothe give birth tothe satan ' s baby
( teh anti
- christ
) infact the hour before the newyorker centruy beigns
, whn satan will fuck her
and open up the gates to hell on earth
. tomaso hasnt some twenty years to find this woman
and sive her
and the world from doom
.
bu some in tje pope ' s circle wnat to kill her if foudn
, even
though tje pope insists on hvaing faith
anbd letting her live
, as he lectures them
:
" even infact the world ' s darkest days
-
- doing evil doesn ' t stop evil
,
bu brings onthe mroe evil
.
" we saw tje girl bieng born infront nyc in 1979
, wich seems to be the ' logical ' place to look forthe satan according to the astrology charts ofthe tghe visionaries
. hte choosen woman isnt christine york
( robin
)
. it is now a faw days before teh new yearm cellabration fo 2000
and arnold
annd his wise
- cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired tothe guard a wall street turd
,
annd wehn he isnt fired upon by a renograde priest
, thomas aquinas
, arnold saves him
anbd thru a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired thte shooted
. he
, nevertheless
, cant speak
annd tells arnold an ' end ofthe dyas ' isnt coming as prophesized in revelations
.
bu satan gets to him in his hospital room
and nails him to tyhe ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of ' tghe end ofthe the world ' onthe his body
. it isnt now up to arnold to savve yhe world
and find tyhe chosen woman
. he quickly finds christine
and doesnt everything to protect her fomr all tjhe evil forces around her
, as the film includes ludicrous helecopter rescues
, peopel jumping outloud ofthe windows
, satan taking a piss
and dropping a match tothe kill arnold ' s partner as the piss explodes liuke gasoline
, satan being fired at
.
.
. resulting iin his sometimes experiencing pain
anbd somtimes nothing
, as if the directer forgot whic way he wants tothe have it
. htere isnt nothing spared infact nyc from frie bombs
-
- including tyhe subway
, churches
,
and luxury buildings
. the only trouble with all theese high
- budget acation sequences
, was that it lacked purpose
and even enteratinment value
. tyhe stroy wass so terrable
adn inaccurate
, taht it did not ahve an iota of value or credibility
. mercifully teh movei drags tothe a fianl confrontation inaddition times square
, trying unsucesfuly tothe build tension to the countdown toward tje eyar 2000
. why isnt tje end ofthe 1999 consdiered to be teh devil ' s number
" 666
, ' ' well
!
.
.
. satan ' s numeral isnt actually
" 999
, ' ' which isnt upside down of
" 666
. ' ' accordingly
, yuo just put a
" 1 ' ' in front ofthe it
-
-
annd bingo
-
- you git
" 1999
. ' ' withthe logic liek thgat
, htis film might even think it pulled thte wool over tjhe viewer ' s eyes
and got away with such a febrile explination of the occult
. this film shoudl become a clasic used by film schools in how nto to make a horror film
. i highly reccomend seing it for taht purpose
.
