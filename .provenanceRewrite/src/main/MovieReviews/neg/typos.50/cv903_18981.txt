don ' t let htis movei fool yuo into believing the rumatic noirs of william shakespeare
. noone one will truly understand the heart
annd soul of this man exept through his owrk
,
and this movie mkaes a vain attemp at tath
. any moves tothe
? glamorise ' his life
, wich hollywood has an annoying tendency to dont
, wiull only subtract fomr his achievment rether than expound onthe his greatness
. this movie baout his life
, altho well writed
, puts too much mkea
- uv onthe a man whose life was probably moreso pork
anbd potatoes
, rather than lobster
annd champagne
. oh well
, let ' s fantasise onwards an asume tath he was a bited of a flirtatious play
- rwite
, who falls in love wih a beautiful woman
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and ffrom her inspiration
, several plays deveop
-
? romeo
and juliet '
,
and
? the twelft night '
. it isnt easier for me tothe believe that he hadnt a wet dream
adn that ' s how all his plays develop
,
bu please spare me all of htis unecessary melodrama
.
but i guess my verzion propably wouldn ' t draw a crowd or make a doller on screen
. so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare
, whn all we ened to dont isnt read his owrk in order to find his soul
. i think not
. as forthe tjhe oscars weere htey deserved by thsi movei
? i think nto
. in many aspects
? private ryan '
and
? life is beautifull ' weere far superior movies
,
but one shoud never asume that htis shoudl be a criteria forthe winning an oscar
, as time
and again
, for reasons unexplained
, an undeserving movei will win tjhe acolade
. anohter sore point is thge fact that gwyneth won tje best female lead
, over a more polished cate
,
but i guess if ytou go onthe enough baout your granfather dieing
and your nephew bieng hospitalised
- peopel will start feeling sorry forthe you
.
