- long dragon isnt the cmoputer
- generated co
- star ofthe this strictly
- by
- teh
- numbers sword ' n ' sorcery flick
. as voiced by sean connery
,
" draco
" isnt a surprisingly expressive creation who isnt well
- deserving ofthe his 23 minutes of screen time
. he walks
, talks
, flies
, fries
,
annd even fakes his pwn death
, all iwth the help of 96 computer
- aided animators
. too bad that ilm
( industrial glight
and magic
) couldn ' t sparce some special effects for dragonheart ' s
* human
* co
- stars
. a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be
. he ' s a near
- total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight
. david thewlis ' evil king has a high hiss factor
( hf
)
,
though he ' s moreso of a mumbling oddity than anytying else
. oh
,
adn htere ' s some redhead in a ' 90 ' s wig
, who runs arund either screaming or scowling
, depending apon if teh parituclar scene has her playing the woman inthe peril or tjhe put apon peasant
. the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions
, julie christie
(
!
) as the good queen mother
, a band ofthe mercenaries that apearing dressed for ye olde heavy
- metal concert
,
annd
, believe or it not
, the speaking spirit ofthe king arthur
. bring outloud your dead
! unfortunatly
, whn we add it all together
( draco
+ fringe bits
- quaid
- thewlis
)
, the sum total amounts tothe zero
. dragonheart isnt
, well
, too much of too littel
. directer rob cohen
( dragon
: the bruce lee story
) has made a big
, expensive movie that
, hwile ambitiously plotted
, isnt both murky
and predictable
.
and overscored
.
and self
- important
.
and thge list goes on
.
( i must ask
: doed screenwrighter charles edward pogue intend that
* every
* character be stabbed
, lanced
, or sliced at least once
? keep that man awya from the knife drawer
!
) thte last five minutes of this movei are tje worst
, with soem silly celestial nonsense that owudl be laughed outloud ofthe any planetarium ight show
, much less a summer movie
. savve your money
.
