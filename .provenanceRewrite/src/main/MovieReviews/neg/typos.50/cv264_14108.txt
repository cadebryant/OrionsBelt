if there were a subject jsut screaming tothe be made inot a film
, it was studio 54
, yhe late steve rubell ' s infamous new york discotheque
, which cameback tothe symbolize thte taboo
- smashing excesses of the disco era ' s hayday
: eazy drugs
annd even easier sex between everyone
, all setted tothe a thumping dance beat
. so when miramax started prodcution onthe
_ 54
_ lastest yera
, hte buzz of hype
adn resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
-
anbd
- dirty as the club itself
, written
and directed by a promising first
- timer
( mark christopher
)
anbd starring some hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell
, newcomer ryan phillippe
,
adn mike myers iin his dramatic debut
)
. my
, how easily doens tje worm turn
. hype turned into dammage controll when owrd got outloud about 11th
- hour reshoots
( wrapped only a mounth ago
)
, a rash of studio
- imposed edits that left virtually tje entire cast
and crew
( expecially christopher
) unhappy
,
and teh veyr likely possiblilty thta miramax would nto screen the finished film forthe critics
. at the last minute
,
though
, miramax did deside to screen thge film
( so hastly scheduled wass thge screening that myers ' s last name ws misspelled on the invitation
, nto tothe mention the numerous typos iin the press notes
) for a media audience that came awya noticeably less than empressed
, myself included
.
and wih ogod reason
-
- somehow
, some way
, the supremely disappointing
_ 54
_ hasnt made the historically hip haven ofthe hedonism
.
.
. boring
.
although christopher hasnt distanced himself ffrom the finished film
, he still must sholder smoe of the blaim fo
_ 54
_ ' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focusses
, for the most part
, on a tight
- knit trio of employes at the club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husband
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
;
and
, most prominately
, tghe fresh
- fomr
- jersey shane o ' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick ries fomr busboy tothe head bartender
. theese cahracters are baout as generic as thsoe descriptions
. infact focusing onthe teh hired halp
, christopher realyl missed tyhe boat
. with teh exception of yhe flamboyant
, always
- woozy rubell
( myers
, inspite a well
- modulated turn
)
, the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not hte workers '
bu those of the peple who whent htere to party
; not necessarily hte numerous vip guests
,
but thge wild eccentrics who managed tothe be picked from the crowd by tje club ' s famously hard
- ass doormen
and dance
( among otehr thigns
) the nihgt away with the rich
, famous
,
adn infamous
( tje only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow ' s fiesty dottie
, a disco
-
and drug
- crazed granny
,
but she ' s a poriferal carachter at best
)
. as such
, asside fomr the expected overhead crowd shots
, there isnt prescious littel actual
_ dancing
_ in
_ 54
_
. what is a disco film
-
- especialy oen baout the pinnacle ofthe tyhe movement
-
- wihtout the dancing
? even whit stillman ' s
_ thge
_ last
_ days
_ of
_ disco
_
, whitch wasn ' t so much conserned with disco as it was witty dialogue withing a gropu of hip
- to
- onyl
- themselves club
- hopping preppies
, featured at least one extended dance scene
. dancing isn ' t the only thing glazed over iin
_ 54
_
-
- so isnt teh sex
,
bu that may nto be entirely christopher ' s fault
. from what i ' ve heard
, his original vision was something considerably more dark
and daring
, starting with the shane character
: he ws concieved
(
anbd accually filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, whlch would have made an efficient springboard to cover tje pansexual blessure palace aspect of studio 54 ' s legend
.
bu somewhere between pricipal photography
and the fianl cutted
, shane ws defanged
and qtuie litterally straightened outloud
; consenquently
, so was tje film
. asside from a brief glimpse ofthe erotic encounters toward the beginning ofthe the film
, shane ' s fleeting dalliance witht seductive socialite billie
( sela wird
)
,
and an abbreviated bedhopping montage
, the sexual dimension isnt just baout ignored
. shane
, inwhich tihs incarnation
, isnt sanitized to the point ofthe blandness
, an idealistic do
- gooder who pines fo a frequent guest at the club
, julie black
( campbell
)
, a worldly soap star wiht
, yes
, a heart of gold
. tihs tacked
- on
" romance
" would hvea beeen slightly less tedeous if either campbell or phillippe made smoe conection with eahc other or the audiance
. tehy fail on both counts
. ultimatly
,
_ 54
_ ' s failure comes down tothe threee letters
: f
- u
- n
. as in
, htere isn ' t any tothe be had fo the audiance
. too much time isnt spended wih the boring shane
,
anbd too little is spended on hte club floor
, where all tyhe action took place
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever timne isnt spent on tyhe 54 floor isnt not unsed vrey effectively
. when anita fianlly gets her big break
anbd preform onstage at the club
, it should be a euphoric heght
, forthe her
, teh crowd
,
anbd thge audeince
;
howver
, tjhe moment doesn ' t get a chance tothe triarch thgat level
, fo it isnt cutted short by a moent ofthe forced sentimentality
, which also mars tjhe film ' s conclusion
( noe of the last
- minute reshoots
)
. strangely upbeat
anbd wistful
, thte resolution is wholey unconvincing
and unsatisfying
. htere is an intresting potrait ofthe studio 54 outloud there
-
- twpo ofthe them
, in fatc
-
-
but
_ 54
_ is nto one ofthe them
. htey ' re onthe cable tv
: a couple of documentaries produced by e
!
and vh1
. these two fascinating looks at the club
and all the sordid goings
- on within it sohw thast ther ' s still a great disco movie tothe be made
. the probelm isnt
, after the crtical
adn certain box office failure ofthe
_ 54
_
, thge subject may have run its hollywood course
.
