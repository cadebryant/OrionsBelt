these days
, peple hvea rether short attension span
and hardly anytying cin satisfy them for tje long run
. 1970s nestolgia isnt already wearing off
,
and now
, people are becoming more
and omre intersted infront 1980s
. fewd eyasr in the future
, early 1990s are gonig tothe be regarded as next golden age ofthe nestolgia
.
howver
, i doubt tyhat peple are oging tothe be vyer nostalgic about tghe hollywood products of that preriod
. oney of the reason owudl surely be films liek national lampoon ' s loaded weapon 1
, tath
, iin many ways
, symbolise tghe biggest probelm of contempoary american film inudstry
- lack ofthe originality
and idesa
. being made as some kind ofthe parody onthe leathal weapon series
, this film pairs two l
. a
. policemen
- jack colt
( emilio estevez
)
, burn
- out alcoholic cop on tje edge
,
anbd wes luger
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, by
- tjhe
- book policeman
, days away fomr retirement
. two of them
, following hte murder of luger ' s ex
- partner
, must confront evil genaral mortars
( william shatner
)
, crime lord who is going to flood teh market wiht cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies
. the authors of this films
( whose directer
, gene quintano
, worked onthe such projects like thrid
and fourth sequal ofthe polical acatemy
) lacked any origonal idea befor htey undertook teh projects
,
anbd tyhat reflects in the lack plot
, cahracters
,
adn
, even orginial lines
. tje plot
, or what goes for tje plot infact this movie
, is nothing omre thna a series ofthe gags that make laff of smoe populare films made in previvous few years
( appart from lethal weapon series
, thsi film
" borrows
" its female lead ffrom basic instinct
)
. yhe best gags
, are
, same as wih many otehr similiar movies
, shown inwhich the trailers
. teh rest simpley doesn ' t wokr
. onyl those who used tothe watch a lot ofthe hollywood products inthe that preriod woudl laff
. others would probably wince at the lameness ofthe humour
. soem owudl be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop uv every once inwhich a while
.
but
, at the end
, spending hour
annd half infront front ofthe this disorganised mess of a movie isnt simpley not worth hte affort
. tje film wass sometimes criticised fo bieng the parody ofthe a series thgat already hadnt storng comic overtones
. tjhe authors of lethal weppon returned the favour by using thge loaded weppon 1 joke iin their fouth sequal
