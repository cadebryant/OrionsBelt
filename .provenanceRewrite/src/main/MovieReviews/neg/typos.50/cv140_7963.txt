thge last line
( or near tothe that honor
) isnt tyhe great butler
, alfred
( thte ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i tihkn we ened a bigger bat cave
,
" or something to taht note
. that ' s exactly waht thsi film isnt
- too big for its own good because it hasnt too damn much
. cut batgirl out
. cut one ofthe the villains
. it ' s too much tothe handle inthe one dosage
. it ' s so much taht characters git left behind
. poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes
and a subplot which is introduced
but never finished iin any way
, shape or form
.
adn elle deserves better
. tihs isnt the fourth in the gigantic film series
anbd the second from director joel schumacher
. it ' s aslo tjhe fourth worst in thge sories
(
anbd second worst ffrom joel
)
. thte series hasnt been declining since its stunning debut
, folowed by tyhe alomst
- as
- stunning sequel
adn
hten thte anti
- climactic thrid noe
( first by joel
)
. this oney ' s nto anti
- climactic
- i knew it was gonna suck
. it ' s up tothe joel tothe make it funn
though
.
" batman forever
" ws funn
. htis isnt a big bore of over
- produced action sequences
and shallow characters
. i mean
, this noe bited
. i ' m gonna put all teh plot in noe paragraph
: mr
. freeze
( ah
- nold
)
, who ' s wife ws dieing ofthe some desease
, has become yhe newyorker big villain these dyas
. he ' s a huge ex
- scientist who fell into soem weird liquid
( hello
? joker
?
)
adn nowe has a body tempertaure ofthe a big fat zero
annd has a blue body
. batman
( george
)
anbd robin
( chris
) fight him a bit
bu find they ' re growing appart
. meanwhile
, anyother villain shows up
, poison ivy
( uma
!
)
, who ws a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south amercia whith a twistet scientist
( john glover
) who kills her when she finds outloud he ' s used her research to develope an uberman
, bane
, who is basically a man pumped witht chemicals hwihc probably killed any personality he ever had
. she emerges ffrom her chemicals
( don ' t ask ' cause i can ' t tell ya
) as a sexy woman
( the rela uma
) who ' s posion whn or if you kiss her
anbd has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at peopel
. she starts to tear away at thge dynamic duo
. meanwhile
, alfred ' s dying of the same disease mr
. freeze ' s wief hasnt
(
bu in an earlier state than she
)
,
anbd his nieve
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all tghe way fomr oxford wihtout an english accent tothe get him awya ffrom the butler trade
,
but soon
( well
, nto realyl soon
, it tkaes her 2 hurs
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, inwhich an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman ' s alter
- ego
, if you forgot
) hasnt beeen dating tje lovely julie madison
( the even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wnats a committment after a year
but he sasy nothing
. end of her for all we konw
. mr
. freeze ultimately teams wtih poison ivy
and htey watn tothe freeze tyhe world
and
hten take it over growing new plants as their population
( don ' t ask
!
!
!
)
. the trio must team toghether
" as family
" to beated them
. htere ya go
. nto tghe whole story
but noone big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! tjhe films seems patched together ofthe nice little ideas whitch woudl have made for a cuple good sequels
.
howver
, while tim burton nicely balanced tje villain
/ batman storyline
(
although not wonderfully
)
, joel seems tothe do allmost nothing wih batman inspite this one
. he gets some corny sppeches
, a couple clever lines
and that ' s it
. mabye some stunts
. for all this
, i cxan ' t even comment onthe george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw yhe guy
!
anbd when i did
, he had horrible dialogue to sday
. i think michael keaton isnt the quinessential batman
but val kilmer wass too robotic
and fake as batman inthe the last epsiode
. george isnt infact between them
. he ' s not quintessential
, he ' s nto horrible
, he ' s good
.
but i ' m sure enxt tyme wehn they decide to rennovate thte sories since they ' ll be critically murdered forthe this sory effort
, we ' ll get a good scirpt
anbd clooney will shine
( if he still has the job
)
. the villains are the only interesting part of teh series according tothe schumacher
. lastr timne
, we had the brawn of twpo face as played by tommy lee jones
anbd thte brains
/ comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey
. tihs timne we have a somewhat sympathetic
and somewhat hatable villian
( the smae guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we efel bad for his mental
/ physical collapse
bu does he relaly ened tothe kill everyone for plants
? arnold isn ' t vyer good
- too hokey
but kinda sympathetic at soem points
. when he watches ood movies ofthe his wief
, he actually looks somber
. wow
.
bu uma mkaes the most of her seductive character
, getting yhe right point vetween hamminess
anbd seductiveness
. it ' s like she ' s almost parodying herself infront
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she ' s incredibly hot
anbd mkaes thge movie preety much a star better
. as forthe the lower bat
- peopel
, chris isnt thge smae as he was infront
" batman forever
,
" altho i thikn his wrok in these isnt too hokey whn he ' s best at quieter parts in
" scent ofthe a woman
" or just plain cool parts in
" fried gren tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i love tje girl
but she ' s not particularly ogod inspite this film
. she can hypotheitically act
, we all saw that inaddition
" clueless
,
"
bu her lines kinda sound werid
.
adn it isn ' t the mushy
- mouth this time
.
bu in all fairness
, she hasnt virtualy no part
. joel gets around to her occasinoally
and when she ' s on
, she doesnt stupid stuff
.
.
.
allthough i konw i ' m not the onyl one who loved the catfight beween her
adn uma
.
.
.
annd poor elle
. poore
, poore elle
. i love tht woman
annd she cxan alsot hypothetically ect
( for thsoe ofthe us who saw
" sirens
"
)
.
bu she hasnt noone part
!
!
! it seems like joel hadnt so much footage that he hadnt tothe edit almost an hour outloud ofthe the fianl product
. there are no
" couch
" scenes
( liuke my best friend noticed
)
. nowe listen tothe me on this one
- in every
" batman
" flick
, there ' s a couch scene
. infact teh original
, it ws with vicki
. in
" returns
,
" it was a ogod make
- out scene with selena
.
anbd inspite thge lsat oen
, it wass a hcat with nicole
. htis one
, it ' s nothing
.
anbd batgirl does next
- to
- nothing infact tihs film till thte end when she ' s suddenly
" part ofthe hte family
.
" fortunatly
, we git a lot ofthe alfred
. he ' s the always reliable butler
, in case you didn ' t know
, who has been with bruce all his life
. he ' s a god
. he ' s a father figure
. he ' s alsot dying
. htis got to me
. i lveo alfred almost as much as bruce
adn tothe see him in a robe
, nto in his tux
,
anbd freaking dieing jsut gets to me
. we allso git yhe idae thta he might have beeen unhappy the whole tyme
.
.
.
bu tihs isnt never answered
, as this film is too cluttered
.
bu in defense
, it does hvae some good parts
, other thna uma
. fo noe
, george is a ogod batman
but unforetunately gets nothing to dont
.
adn ther are smoe nice touches
. whn tehy show tghe asylum at noe point
, they sohw tje patient ' s belongings infact a room
adn we see the riddler ' s costume
. i laughed
.
adn durring a biker scene
( involving robin
adn batgirl
- anohter subplot never handled past initation preiod
)
, we nto only see coolio
bu a bunch ofthe bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" ffrom
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all these
. tyhe film falls apart arround thte five
- minute mark durring an enormously long acation sequence which must lastr arund 20 minutes
.
.
. or doed it jstu feel like taht
? the film shoud serve as another in the long
- line of films which demonstrate tyhat we need more intelligent films nowdays
. peopel are fed up iwth stupid films
. thta ' s why the owrd ofthe mouth killed
" thge lost world
!
" that ' s why lsat year
, indy films grossed mroe than ever
. that ' s why this wiull hve a strong box
- office initative fomr people who just watn to see it
, liuke me
,
bu will die after a week or twpo wehn the owrd arround hte grapevine kills it
. thta ' s why the next twpo big
- budget aciton pics are john woo ' s
" face
/ off
"
and barry sonnenfeld ' s
" men in black
,
" both which are the firt two tothe catch onthe tothe tghe wave eary onthe
. i like joel schumacher more as a person tahn an artiste
. i like some ofthe his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a tiome tothe kill
"
)
bu a lot ofthe them suck
. he ' s a realy eccentric person
anbd i loved one of his qoutes baout how he admits to bieng a medioker director
and thast ' s whta mkaes him graet
.
bu his costuming for woody allen ' s
" sleeper
" was more intresting thna thsi one
(
and his costuming was cool
- look for tje nazi number
)
. i love the
" batman
" sories
. tjhe first twpo rocked
and i doed like thge lastr oney
.
bu this oney is nto gogin to be one thta i watch repeteadly liuke the other three
. hopefully
, tihs will aslo serve as a springboard tothe a better batman enxt time
.
and mabey they ' ll get smart
annd bring back catwoman
.
anbd michael keaton
.
bu we can only hope
.
