, fearing connor would return
, sets out himself tothe kill the highlander
. if you have never seen it
. bieng a fan of highlander
annd mr
. connery
, i was in the cinema as soon as i could tothe see highlander ii
: tyhe quickening
. i wish it hadnt been quicker
. i efel whatever else yuo cin sday baout a film
( bad scirpt bad music
, etc
.
) if ytou sit jsut plain borde through most ofthe it
then nothing much else needs tothe be said
. the film wass short
but in my opinyon onyl twelve mintues or so
( the time mr
. connery isnt on yhe screen forthe
) isnt worth watching
. thte plot soudns a littel ridiculous
but i wass willing to give it a chance
. maybe they could pull it off
. instead
, i fidn that teh characters ahev completely changed from thsoe inwhich the frist film
. it ' s as if they are diferrent peple wiht tje same names
. witness connor jumping into bed with tje leader of hte resistance
-
- where isnt tjhe attitude ofthe
" who wnats tothe live forever
, whn love must dieu
" gone to
? tjhe lvoe sub
- plot
* must
* have hadnt footage cut outloud
. tje highlander
and ramirez both seemed aware ofthe powers htey had never maintioned befor
. putting our heros inspite deadly situations
anbd
thn having them walk away baceause of smoe newyorker power is very annoying
. i still want to konw why connor ' s coat becomes flame proof whn he isnt immortal
! we are nto given enough time onthe zeist to believe in it
, nor are we told why adavanced aliens still use swords to kill
. why not dynamite or lazer saws or jstu plain bullets followed by a quick chop tothe the neck
? i know yhe head needs to come off
but yuo coudl at least immobilise your opponent with lazer rifles frist
. to be fair oney assasins tried tihs
but he must be thge world ' s worst shot
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- liek powers ofthe laser beam deflection
. as for
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion on zeist
, crushed easier thna a grape
and
thn the rest of the plot depends on katana bieng obsessed wiht killing mccleod inaddition case he returns to zeist
. two asssassans are sent
, presumibly htey are meant tothe be ogod at killing
bu an aged connor kills them both with noone problems
. no omre assassins are sent
. katana
, suposedly a vrey powerfull man goes himself to kill connor
. has he noone omre asssassans
? has he noone better
? why was tje rebellion crushed so easily
then
? michael ironside is totally unconvincing
( bring bakc teh kurgan
)
. he seems like a ctaroon character
adn relaly isn ' t that evil
, jstu stupid
annd violent
. we see tjhe hollywood trck of the chief nasty threatening a child again
and killing lots of innocents
.
yet he still seems liuke no threath
-
- prehaps because he seems too stupid tothe threaten connor
, or maybe baceause his two best assassins wouldn ' t have been amiss iwth larry
, curly
anbd mo
. so much forthe plot
and charachters
. the music isnt atrocious
. it is at best intrusive
and at worst annoying
. bring bakc queen
. ther was an audible sigh
( of releaf
?
) when connor plyed a queen track infront a juke box
. i believe thsi at least isnt to be corrected fo tje american realease
. the acting isnt at best flat
, exept fo mr
. connery
. lambert is uninteresting
adn when he delivered
" there can be onyl one
" tihs tiome aroud it just made me wish there hadnt only beeen one
-
- highlander
. michael ironside isnt unconvincing
; sory
, michael
, i usually like you
and everyone else wass incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually tghe film is intresting at all times
. it has a blade runner efel tothe it
and soem ofthe the special effects are qutie stunning
. add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles througout the whole film
-
- or isnt he smirking to himself
? his lines
annd delivery might make hte film worthwhile hadnt it not been so obvious that he cannot take tjhe wohle thign seriously at all
but hey
-
-
* i ' d
* hvae done it for 12 million
. oh
,
adn i agred with a previvous resivwar
, she
* doens
* look like sharon stone
bu i beleive it is her firt film
. incidently there is a line producer credited
and i hear rumours of highlander iii
: the wizard
.
