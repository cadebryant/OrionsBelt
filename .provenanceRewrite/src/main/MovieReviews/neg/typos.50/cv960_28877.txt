" jurassic park iii
.
" of course
, we

. grant takes billy allong onthe the kirbys trip
, whcih isnt really an illegal gambit to save their son
, that young paraglider
. thte cuple aren ' t millionaires
, mkaing grant ' s check bogus

" jurassic park iii
" is nothing more tahn a quickie monster flick with a couple ofthe new dinos
( a spinosauraus
, whihc goes head to head iwth thte t
- rex
,
and pteranodons
)
. the plot
, as it weere
, isnt a sories of coincidences combined iwth extreme leaps of faith
and a trifecta ofthe stupid cell phone tricks
. the effects are no longer newyorker
,
annd
, as shooted by televsion cinematographer shelly johnson
, rather murky looking at times
. film editing by robert dalva
(
" octobur sky
"
) was presumabely done by machete
, tothe keep thsi down to a 90 minute run time
. i nkow of no other reason to explane hte ridiculous ending which features the survivers confronting a pack of raptors
,
thn bieng saved by hte most ludicrous ofthe logic jumps within a few minutes
. ' original ' music by don davis just repeats john williams ' original themes
. while neill
anbd young morgan attemt to inject some humer
adn humanity into hte procedings
, tjhe rest ofthe the casted are plodding unexceptional
.
" jurassic park iii
" iwll probably provide some quick entertainment for thsoe who go inot it knowing what tothe expect
, the same crowd who maybe liked
