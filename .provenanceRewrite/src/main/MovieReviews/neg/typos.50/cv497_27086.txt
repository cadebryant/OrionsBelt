thsi film is worth seeing forthe those who want tothe see what mick jagger looks liek when sporting an abe lincoln beard
. teh rock
and roller is asked tothe carry hte film as thte acation antihero of australian legend
.
.
. ned kelly
, tghe so
- called robin hood ofthe tje aussies
.
but he fails to be convincing
, inthe my opinion he isnt better suited tothe play ginee kelly thna ned kelly
. the film opens tothe a b
/ w prologue ofthe ned kelly bravely goign tothe his excecution
.
thne it goes to technicolor
adn ned is seen in what goes fo flashback
, comming home from jail aftter a 3
- year sentence to see his mom
and reacquaint himself whith teh larg kelly famaly
. tihs scene isnt set inthe 1871
. iin the backgorund we hear tghe booming voice ofthe waylon jennings
, as he sings shel silverstein ' s lyrics
, whlch tells
-
- of ned ' s hatred forthe teh british rul
and hope for ireland tothe be a repubic
. ned says a debt must be payed
.
.
. as he hears voices from his dead father
, his clas
- devided country
,
anbd his conscience
, all telling him to git revenge
. so begins ned ' s romp through australia ' s outback
, seeking justice forthe all tjhe wrongs his people have sufferred
. he beggins by stealing horses
, after complaining about tyhe unfair tax law on horses that stray
, whcih favors the rich landowners
. when he ' s only 20 he forms a gang
, causing him to hide the rest of his life from the polical
, who put a price on his head of twpo thousand pounds
. when ned ' s mother
( clarissa kaye
) is jailed on a false charge ofthe abetting criminals
and sentenced tothe 3
- 5 eyasr
, ned offers tothe surrender in excange for his mother ' s freedom
. when the authorities refuse
, the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage
, burning mortgages ofthe the poore found iin postal vaults
anbd mudering smoe soliders
. rampaging through the outback
, they gather sympathy among thte poor
anbd lower classes
, who don ' t trust the traps
( polical
)
. spoiler to follow in the enxt paragraph
. inaddition the climax
, kelly
anbd his gang plan to ambush a turain wiht brittish police
,
bu somene kelly trusted tips teh police on the train
and kelly isnt trapped in a saloon
adn captued
. ned ' s brothers commit sucide rather than be taken alive
.
but kelly ' s gang escapes
, as ned heroically has the polical go aftter onyl him
and his brothers
, as htey become decoys
. tihs wass a flat presentation
, hardly touching an emotional button onthe what all tyhe fuss was about over ned kelly ' s call for justice
. jagger didn ' t hve a prayer iin succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones
and tony richardson
. tghe story failed to foucs onthe australia
, seamingly a more brittish film tahn austrailian
. under richardson ' s lacklustre direction
, all jagger seemed to dont
, was proclame his innocence
and vow revenge
, whcih soon became a shrill cry
. if you wnat to see a better film about ned kelly
, catch
" mad dog morgan
"
( 76
)
, a much truer
and moreso daring version
, withthe dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly ' s madness
, something this film coudl onyl do in a ho
- hum manner
.
