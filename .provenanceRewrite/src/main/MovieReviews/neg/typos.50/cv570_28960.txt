) reviewed by dennis schwartz it ' s a love it or hite it film
. i simply hated it
. on its mneu for funn
, isnt a violent feast served up as charm
and done inwhich a tounge
-
anbd
- cheek manner
. it ' s a serial killer
/ horror film farce of nonstop over
- hte
- top acation
and sleaze
, involving decapitations
, vampires
, biker fights
, extended gun play
,
adn an array of gore tyhat hasnt tothe be seen to be beleived
. a film tath regales inaddition its vulgarity
anbd campiness forthe blood
-
anbd
- gore
, as it goes out ofthe its way tothe gloss over the clich
? s ofthe hte conventional b
- films
. it ' s geared onyl forthe the cult film crowd
,
and wiull amke its mark htere one way or the otehr
. the plot involves two psychopath brothers
, tghe older proffesional bank robber
and killer seth gecko
( clooney
)
and yhe perverted psychopath killer
, richie
( tarantino
)
, who kills forthe pleasure
and is also a rapist
. tehy escape jail
and go on a killing spree in wichita
adn
then flee tothe a liquor store inthe a small texas border town
. they hvae jsut robbed a bank
anbd killed a number of cops
, htey have also taked a middle
- aged bank teller as a hostage
. in the liquor tsore they kill a texas ranger
and thte stroe clerk
,
anbd burn down the store
. stopping off inaddition a flop
- hous motel
, richie rapes
adn slaughters the hostage
. theese scenes are all done witht an eye for comedy
and parody
, if that ' s possible
. onthe the tv news
, it sasy they have killed 16 so far
anbd most are texas rangers
. the brothers plan tothe git to mexico
and meet carlos
( cheech
)
, who iwll give them a place of sanctuary fo thirty percent ofthe their illiegal take
. with road blocks
adn car seaches at teh border
, tghe brothers commandeer a motor hmeo ofthe a vacationing family who stoped at thier motel so tath thge father could sleep in a real bed
. there is tjhe father
, jacob fuller
( keitel
)
, who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died inaddition a car accident
; his sexy 20
- year
- old
, innocent daugher
, kate
( lewis
)
;
and
, her shy brother scott
( liu
)
. it ' s nto explained how he happens tothe be chinese
. the story realy becomes bazare whn tehy get acrost hte border
anbd get ready tothe meet carlos inspite a bar
/ whorehouse for truckers
adn bikers called the titty twister
. the place is open fomr dawn to dusk
, thus the film ' s title
. here ' s where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention outloud the window
and hvea soem absurd funn
, as the palce turns outloud tothe be a vampire hangout
. it sells sex tothe its patrons
,
annd hasnt exotic stripper santanico pandemonium
( hayek
) dont her allrigh strip befor turning into a vampire
. tghe brothers
adn thier hostages ahev tothe fight thier way outloud ofthe the place
, as thge vampires keep comming
and the killings become the film ' s staple
. this supposedly clever scirpt doed nothing
bu turn me off
,
though there weere a few funny moments in a film that ws dripping wiht special effects
adn spended most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings
. i ' ll take a pass on this one
, it ' s jsut nto my style of a film
. the characters were as empty as tje story
,
and tghe film was an eazy one to foreget
.
