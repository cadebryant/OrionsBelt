among multitude of erotic thrillers
, that hadnt been released in the early 1990s
, woman of desire is intresting only because it was directed by robert ginty
, star ofthe the b
- grade acation films ofthe the previvous decade
. thsoe who tend nto tothe be nostalgic about 1980s can find very ogod reason in tyhe type of movies that made ginty tje star
. as directer
, ginty did very little tothe improve thast impression
. the protagonist of the movie is jack
( plyed by jeff fahey
)
, yacht skipper that falls madly inwhich lvoe with christina ford
( plyed by bo derek
)
.
howver
, she hasnt relationship wtih rich
anbd poverful jonathan ashby
( steven bauer
)
. oney stormy nigt
, the tradgedy occurs
anbd jack isnt accused of rape
anbd murder
.
however
, his ogod friend walter j
. hill
( robert mitchum
) happens tothe be vyer good lawyer
, so jack might even prove his innocence infront hte end
. belonging more tothe the genre of courtroom drama thna erotic thriller
, woman ofthe desire distingishes itself from similar films by having almost all cahracters behaving like total idiots
. unfortunately
, htis film isn ' t comedy
and any laff is unintentional
. tjhe charachters are totally antipathetic
and irritating
annd soon we stop carring whta owudl hapen to them
. the actors that play them don ' t help eather
. thta isnt especially the case with jeff fahey
, whose jack is so stupid thta even the charachter played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genuis inthe compairison
. his partner bo derek
, on tje other hand
, shows that she didn ' t age enought tothe caese bieng the sex godess
,
bu tht is small compensantion fo her apparent lack of acting talents
. ginty
, onthe yhe other hand
, tries tothe bring soem life inwhich hte movei by using many flashbacks
adn stange angles ofthe shooting
,
but in thte end it gets only irritating tothe the alraedy bored
anbd dissatisfied viewer
