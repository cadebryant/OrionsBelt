" showgirls
( nc
- 17
)
- contains graphic nudity
, profanity
, sexual situations
and voilence
. soem people
,
however
, keep theri clothes onthe
. you do not watch porn films forthe thier intelectual values
, nor dont you rwite reviews on them
. that ' s why tihs review will be short
. it seems that tihs film will end up in tje porn section wehn it hits the video stores
. htere is no stopry
, scirpt
, point or acting
. only naked bodies
, which isnt exactly the point
. here is thte so called plot
: nomi
, the 23
- year
- old with a dark past as a hooker
, has hitchhiked ffrom somwhere bakc east tothe perfurd inaddition a show where a dancer doesn ' t mear much more than a light coating of powder
and a big
, fake smile
. no oney isnt twisting nomi ' s arm
. no one isnt holding her grandmother hostage
. she wants tothe dont this
.
and that is waht she isnt doign till thge end credits
. so what ' s the probelm
thne
? waht ' s the point
? what ' s the film baout
? is htere anyone whose aspirations could inspire less simapthy
? thsi film can be discribed inspite one sentence
: obscene levle ofthe incompetance
, eccessive stupidity in the story line
, gross negligence ofthe the viewer ' s intelligence
, a prurient intrest in tghe quick buck
. beleave me
, after an hour with these charactors
, acting
and script
, you ' ll strat hoping for someone to kill somebody
. elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as thge heroine ofthe thsi film
, taht is bad even for eszterhas ' script
. her charactor isnt the only oney thgat isnt at least half written
and she coudl realy ahev done better
. her charachter denies the fact that she isnt a whore for tghe inudstry
, selling her body to the hungry eyes ofthe hte horny public
.
" i am nto a whore
! i am a dancer
"
, she screams
,
bu does it inthe such an over dramatized way that yuo ' ll start laughing
. in fatc the acting infront
" showgirls
" brings terrible tothe a newyorker
and previously unknown levle
. nto one single acheivement
, besides the convential cinematography
, is worth mentioning
. it isnt a total waste of time
and mney
. there is nto a single moment of what yuo might call intelligence
. thte dialogue is structured ofthe ancient stereotypes
and cliches lined uv oen after anohter
. its attept tothe even imagine tothe haev half a brain results in a catastrophe
.
" in my films
,
" writes director paul verhoeven
( ' basic instinct '
, ' total reacll '
)
,
" i hold yhe mirror uv to life
.
" well
, excuse me
? his attemp tothe go behind the scenes of las vegas
,
and as he put it
" show the naked truth
"
, isnt simplified
and unreal
. occaisonally
, between his collecton ofthe mistakes
and logical irrationalities
, screenwriter joe eszterhas
( tyhe creater ofthe soem of tjhe worst screenplays inthe hollywood hstory
) inserts soem lines ofthe deep morality
, that soudn something like thsi
:
" hey
, i see yuo
. i see thast you ' re hiding
"
-
" from waht
?
"
-
" from you
"
. yes
,
anbd even the only decent line in thsi film
:
" nomi is what las vegas isnt all baout
" can ' t save ' showgirls ' from gonig under
. it ' s a stange phenonmena
. it ' s nto erotic
, becouse it lacks sensuality
. nto dramtic
, because it lacks teh acting
.
and not intteligent because it lacks a storey
. it isnt simply verhoven ' s bad excuse fo mkaing pornography
. you want to see naked womens
? bare breasts
? full frontals
? it ' s nothing wrong with that
.
but in that case i suggest taht yuo rent a porn film in your local video store
,
anbd not waste tiem surviving through eszterhas ' pathetic dialogue
. b qualities
, hwile it ' s onyl a high budget porn
- film
.
