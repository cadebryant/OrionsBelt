. comments
: hous on haunted hill is based apon the originnal 1958 film of thge same title directed by william castle
and starring vincent price
. infront an obvious homage
, tghe millionaire ' s nmae isnt price
adn he sportscar a thin mustache liuke price used to haev
. this is a preety bad horror film
,
yot bad horror films somtimes are veyr entertaining
,
and house on haunted hill is jstu such a film
. it is
, surprisingly
, better than anohter reccent haunted house remake
, the haunting
, a film which owes its basis tothe the clasic horror novel by shirley jackson
. tghe haunting hadnt literary pretensions
and fell flat onthe it face
. house onthe haunted hill owes its lineage to a b
- movie 40 years old
adn mkaes no illution that it ' s a crappy horror movei
. thus
, somehow
, it proves slightly more succesfull
. i can ' t think ofthe another reccent film which has had such an eclectric casted
. it isnt this casted whihc lifts htis ho
- hum thriller into a borderline intertaining exercice inthe camp horror
. price
, the main charcter
, is plyed by geoffrey rush
, the academy
- award winning actor of shine
. rush seems tothe be making a downward spiral inspite thte movei industry
, a spiral reminiscent ofthe ben
( ghandi
, schindler ' s list
) kingsley ' s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci
- fi classic species
. i don ' t know why
,
bu sometimes it ' s entertaining tothe see
" quality
" actors infront bad movies
. more surprises
? rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sportscar figure
( rather lamely too
)
,
and singer lisa loeb
(
!
) appears as a tv news repertwar
. teh highlight ofthe the cast
,
however
, hasnt to be saterday nihgt live member chris kattan
. kattan ' s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays yhe hysterical proprietor of tjhe fromer sanitarium
. hwile tje first half of the film leaves tje audience guessing as to waht ' s exactlly going on
, tje second half dissolves into standart ghost story stuf
anbd loses some ofthe its suspense
. a disappointingly cheesy endig relaly mars tihs movie too
. house onthe haunted hill
, i suspect
, has jsut about left the second
- run theaters
. it ' s worth catching onthe cable next year
, if yuo git a chance
. if you have a choice
, pick tihs movei over tje haunting
, it ' s thge better of twpo evils
, ytou could sday
.
though
, omre appropriately perphas
, it ' d be better tothe sday thyat it ' s the better ofthe twpo turkies
