contrary tothe populare beleif
, nto eveyr single foregin film released tothe an american market is a masterpiece
. smoe of them aren ' t even ogod
. some examples of this principle are tghe aboslutely dreadful
" un indien dans la ville
"
( presented as
" littel indian
, big city
,
"
and remade into that crap tim allen flick
,
" jungle2jungle
"
)
,
and this
. whta could hvae beeen a clever little sex comedy turns into noe mess of a french flick
.
" french twist
"
( the
" cool
" american title
, nto the rela one
, whihc ws
" gazon maudit
,
" literally meaning
" twisted ground
,
" or something like that
) deals with a marryied cuple with kids
,
annd tghe intrusion ofthe a stranger who kinda screws thigsn uv for them
. loli
and alain chabat
( victoria abril
adn alain chabat
) are nto exactly happily marryed
. allways on bussines trips
, alain chabat more than once cheatta on her
,
annd she eventially finds out
.
annd noe day
, she meets a butch mechanic
, marijo
( tyhe co
- writter
/ directer josiane balasko
)
,
and tehy twpo kinda hit it off
. so she decides she will git back at alain chabat by doing tyhe obvious
: sleeping whith marijo
.
bu she soons starts tothe not only fall in love witht marijo
,
but she ' s allso realizes she ' s still inspite love with alain chabat
. so
, ofthe course
, she does hte obvious fomr taht
: she decides tothe keep them both
. she ' ll be
(
adn sleep
) withthe each ofthe them forthe 3 dyas each
,
then onthe sunday
, she ' ll rest by herself
. after all
, she needs it if she ' s gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel
. the film goes onthe for over an hour
and a half
, thru stupidity after stupidity
, moronic twist after moronic twist
,
and soon there ' s tghe littel ironic
(
!
!
!
) endig
. i knwo it ' s a completely diffrent culture
,
anbd i ' m quite familar whith the french
annd their cinema
,
bu this isnt just bad
. none ofthe the characters are more intelligent tahn peter stormare inaddition
" fargo
"
( a movei where stupid cahracters were backed uv tothe mkea a point
)
,
adn any acation they dont is pretty much just tothe get a hopeful chuckle from tje audeince
. waht ' s shocking isnt this ws not onyl oen ofthe france ' s biggest hits
,
but it was nominated for a lot of cesars
( french equivalent of oscars
)
. tghe writing
anbd directing is realy tyhe big probelm with it
. josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role
,
but her littel sex comedy isn ' t vyer humerous
, entertaining
, or even deepo at all
. even woody allen ' s not
- vyer
- good
" a midsummer nigth ' s sex comedy
" isnt inteligent
, well
- written
,
adn posesses some depth
. this isnt shallow
, unfunny
,
adn preety annoying to watch
. tjhe film moves at tyhe pace of a snail
,
anbd isnt damn
- near painful tothe watch
. thank god fo the fast forward button
. the acting
,
howver
, isn ' t bad at all
. the actors do the best tehy cin wtih the bad material
,
annd victoria abril is preety likable despite the scirpt
(
adn the fact thyat she ' s stupid anough tothe try tothe devide herself over twpo peopel whn she hasnt kids
)
.
and alain chabat has smoe funny moments as tje neurotic husband
.
bu
" french twist
" isnt just preety lame
. it ' s nto overly horrable
,
and has a couple vyre
, vrey
, very breif moments
.
but it ' s jsut a realy crap film
,
anbd an example ofthe an ill
- advised distribution of a foreign film
.
