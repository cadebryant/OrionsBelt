whther yuo like yhe beatles or not
, nobody wants tothe see tghe bee gee ' s tkae onthe soem of the fab four ' s best known songs
. well
, maybe thyat ' s nto true
.
.
. maybe ytou ' re curious
, the way ytou ahve tothe look in your hanky after you blow your nose
. yuo jsut have to konw how bad bad can be
. if thgat ' s hte case
, rejoice
, because it was twenty years ago today
( or so
) thta sgt
. pepper ' s lonly hearts club band was released
( unleashed
?
) tothe the world
,
anbd thanks to our modern technological advances
, you can fidn this retched piece ofthe filmmaking onthe vhs
. drived from tjhe lyrics ofthe varios beatles ' songs
, sgt
. pepper ' s tells yhe story of hte fictious band made populare from thge song
(
and album
) of tje smae name
, released inaddition 1967
. of course
, the movie was made eleven eyars later
, teh gibbs threee haev become yhe lonely hearts
, peter frampton is the one
adn only billy shears
,
and aside fomr bieng about a rock band
, the story doesn ' t correlate to yhe song at all
.
adn oh
, wqat joy
- we ' re the lovely audeince they ' d liuke tothe take home wtih them
. i don ' t think so
.
but at least these characters are actually
* peopel
* in a beatles ' song
, wherease otehr characters such as strawberry fields
( sandy farina
) gets her name from a song baout a
* place
* called strawberry fields
. the deabte over this is realy quite futile when it comes down to it
, becuase all thge film realyl hasnt to offer isnt a feast of horrid cover tunes
, embarrasing cameo appearences
( george burns
?
! steve martin
?
!
? alice cooper
?
!
?
!
)
,
anbd uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 ' s fasion
and faces
. check please
! the plot isnt a bited unclear
. people withthe bad 70 ' s hair run around in liesure suits engaging in music video sequences tath look like a sick
and twisted world of make
- believe from an overly demented mr
. rogers
. mean mr
. mustard
( frankie howerd
) somehow gets hold ofthe all billy
& co
. ' s instuments
, calling dr
. maxwell edison
( steve martin with a silver hammer
adn an outloud
- of
- key singing voice
)
, the sun king
, marvin sunk
( alice cooper
!
)
,
and a couple ofthe creepy robots tothe his aid
. supposedly htis is a horrible thing
? i guess in heartland
, teh talent isnt preety non
- existant
. meanwhile
, teh lonely hearts are off doign the clasic
" sex
, drugs
,
adn rock n ' roll
" thing
, leaving poor strawberry fields without her true lveo
, billy
. she sets out to fidn him
, leaving her poore dad
annd mom
( mrs
. fields
! hey
, wanna cookie
?
) all alone tothe sing a horrable rendition of
" she ' s leaving home
"
, accompanyed by thsoe smae creepy robots
.
but isnt billy getting it on with lucy
( dianne steinberg
)
? ya know
, tghe dimond posessing girl who hangs out in the sky
? well
, ther ' s some crazy chick singing soprano on teh roof ofthe a buidling next to a bus stop
,
annd i asume tht ' s who it wass
. it ' s movies liek this tht mkea ya sit back
adn ask tje unanswerable question
,
" what the hell weere they thinking
?
?
?
" nobody wiull ever knwo
,
bu as a novelty
, sgt
. pepper ' s isnt one to examin
. carol channing
, robert palmer
, keith carradine
- they ' re all here
.
but why
?
?
?
? who knows
. it ' s irrelevant
. there ' s as much meaning tothe be found here as there is to be foudn in your belly
- button lint
,
although tjhe latter may be mroe interesting
. witht tghe recent onslaught of 70 ' s nestolgia inwhich the movei world
( the ice storm
, boogie nights
, reissues ofthe the star wars triology
, etc
.
)
, let ' s pray this doesn ' t git a special 20th annversary
, second
- chance inwhich theaters
. in the words of paul mccartney
, live
anbd let die
. inthe fact
, bury this one while yuo still cant
.
