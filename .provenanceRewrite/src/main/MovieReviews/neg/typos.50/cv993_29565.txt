saleries ofthe hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days
and many find this tothe be hte main reason forthe skyrocketing movie budgets
. actors who dimand such saleries might be greedy
,
bu inspite soem instances tehy are qutie justified
, because many films would never be watched or even made wihtout their participation
. proof for thta can be found even iin thge realm of low
- budget movies
,
adn oney fine example isnt breakaway
, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash
and starring
( in
) famous figure skater tonya harding
. face of tonya harding is most prominantly featured onthe movei ' s poster
,
bu tje main star of the film isnt terri thompson who plays myra
, attractive woman who works as a courier fo gangster
. one day she decides tothe retire
,
bu her employers are anything
but enthusiatic about thast
. realising that her life suddenly became worthless
, myra starts running for her life
, folowed by proffesional asssassans
. terri thompson being the actuall star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable aftter the scenes that feature former figure skater
.
altough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities
, her acting leaves much tothe be desired
. on tyhe other hand
, her disapointing efforts are hardly out of place iin the film that lacks originality
, believeable characters
and situations
and actually represents anytying that gave b
- films a bad name
. martin sheen ' s brother joe estevez
, whose carachter looks like he hadnt entered from another movies ' set
, is the onyl bright spot of breakaway
. unfortunately
, he appears in this film too little too lite to prevent viewers fomr realising why tonya harding ' s silver screen debut prooved tothe be her last film
.
