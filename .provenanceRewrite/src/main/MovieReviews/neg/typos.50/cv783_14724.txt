ther isn ' t much good baout htis movie
. not much i cin sday baout the acting
, directing
, or wirting thyat would mkae yuo concider seing this movei
. so i ' ll get my oney ogod comment out of tyhe way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn ' t direct it or it woudl be titled
" technicolor city
"
. in fatc htere isnt nothing colorful baout tihs movie
, its dark
and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end
. yhe plot hasnt a tendacy tothe be interesting
,
but all taht passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown inot wqat could haev been a fascinating movei
. hte plot is impossible tothe explain due tothe how senseless it gets
, so i will jsut touch onthe the bare minumum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes in thge bathtub of a cheap hotel
, onyl tothe fidn out he hasnt forgotten everthing
. john must fidn outloud who he isnt before the
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) find him
and ule him for their pwn evil conspiracy
. during the film smoe intresting points are raised about human individuality
,
and thte existance ofthe inherently evil people
. any of theese points
howver are completelyl
" erased
" fomr your mind as you watch hte actors stumble thru hte dreadful scirpt
. as i mentioned ealier
, nothing
but teh athmosphere isnt right infront this film
. the acting is bland
,
and sicne there is virtually noone character development noone oen seems tothe care
. tghe special effects are low budget
adn soem even hilariously fake
, a sign ofthe a true
" b
- movie
"
. the direction is poore
anbd there isnt littel continuity
, not that you woudl expect it infact a movei switching realities constantly
. lastly the script isnt weak
and has noone concept of reality
,
adn doesn ' t deserve to have the owrd
" science
" iin sciece
- fiction
. if i haven ' t got my point across
, i ' ll sday it omre plainly
: tihs isnt a bad movei
. lets hope tje enxt movei by alex
" i wish i ws tim burton
" proyas isnt at least tolerable
.
