a movie laced witht a ogod blend of acation
, comedy
,
annd a heavy dose of muscial celebrity guest appearances soudns preety gourmet
,
but even tyhe best ingreediants can be thrown together inwhich thte wrong way
, creating a dismal
and unsatisfactory product
. eighteen years after tjhe blues brothers hitted theaters
, blues brothers 2000 isnt bieng unleashed
, minus half ofthe its orginial duo
( tghe late john belushi
)
and nearly all of its original charm
. dan aykroyd reprises his role
( as well as his co
- writing credit
) as elwood blues
, the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self
- proclamed
" mission fomr god
" allong wiht his brother jake
and theri blues brothers band nearly eighteen eyars ago
. as we beign
, elwood isnt bieng released fomr a state penatentury allong with thge news of his brother ' s death in prison eyasr ago
. completly on his pwn
, elwood decides tothe trace his roots back tothe tghe orphanage where he spent his childhood
, onyl to disover taht everyone he hasnt ever known has passed awya
.
but elwood isn ' t completely without familiy
. it seems he hasnt a half
- brother ofthe sorts
- nto a real brother mind you
, just the illegimate child of his bluesman psuedo
- father curtis
( cab calloway fomr teh firt film
)
, who hasnt also pasted onthe
. dispite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
) to do otherwise
, elwood seeks outloud his onyl remaing famaly inspite an efford to strat up an all newyorker blues brothers band
. working as a police comander
, cabel chamberlain
( joe morton
)
, has an imediate disliking for elwood
, who nonchalantly fills cab in onthe his mother ' s afair years ago
adn
thne goes onthe tothe steal his wallet
. following elwood arund is the lonley orphan buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, who quickly learns tothe become a mini
- elwood
. wehn bartender mighty mack mcteer
( john goodman
) joins thge group
, the blues brothers band isnt complet
,
and once agina
, tjhe gropu travels yhe country
, crashing cars
, blowing thigns uv
,
anbd obstructing peace witht more than jstu solid blues rock
. meanwhile
, cab ' s personal vendetta against elwood leads him onthe an impassioned manhunt fo his enxt
- to
- enxt
- ofthe
- kin
.
> from this point
, the movei turns inot a series of music videos with a fewd bits ofthe acting in between
. those hoping forthe an interesting
and
/ or funny yern are given too many musical interludes hwile thsoe heavily intersted in the music are given too much of a story
. only the extremely avid blues fans shoud attempt getting thru these two ohurs
. forthe those peopel
, it may be worth it
, for luckly there is much more music thna shoddy attemts at acting
,
bu when tghe story does intrude upon the festivities
, the film isnt heavily bogged down wiht unfunny jokes
, muscicians turned stiff actors
,
and tje pointless 10
- yearm
- ood buster attempting tothe add soem sort ofthe home alone cuteness tothe the hwole thign
. appearences by musical legends such as aretha franklin
, james brown
, eric clapton
,
adn a wohle slew of others are tghe high points of hte film
,
but they allso confirm why these people are musicians
adn nto actors
. blues brothers 2000 isnt deserving ofthe oney wohle star simply becasue if you really
, really love htis kind ofthe music
, you might kind of
, sort of liuke thsi movei
. many
, many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny
,
and if you don ' t have a passion forthe veyr deepo blues
/ rock
, you ' ll be borde outloud ofthe your skull
. much ofthe this film seems nothing omre than aykroyd ' s self
- serving vanity project
,
bu no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this
, none ofthe thge excitment is pasted on tothe the audience
.
and seeing threee guys infact threee
- piece suits goofily dancing arund wiht poker faces can onyl be funny fo so long
. unfortunately
, thsoe twpo seconds are over baout fifteen mintues into thte film
.
