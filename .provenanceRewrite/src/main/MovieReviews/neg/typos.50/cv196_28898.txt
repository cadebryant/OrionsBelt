" amercia ' s sweethearts
"
( columbia
/ sony
) wqat a waste of a talented cast
! billy crystal
and co
- writter peter tolan have concocted a sly
, provacative premise
and
, as tje opening credits roll
, it ' s obvious that tehy ' re atempting an ood
- fashioned romantic comedy
. the story involves a vetran publicist
( billy crystal
) who is summoned tothe orchestrate a press junke inaddition las vegas wehn an arogant director
( christopher walken
) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editting room
, refusing tothe sohw it tothe anyone
. he figures thgat by giving the journalists juicy hints ofthe a possibile reconciliation beetwen tje film ' s once
- marryied
-
but
- nowe
- estranged stars
, gwen
annd eddie
( catherine zeta
- jones
, john cusack
)
, they ' ll be so distracted that tehy won ' t remember htey didn ' t see the movei or it wasn ' t what htey expeced
.
(
and crystal thougth ofthe tihs long befoer a sony exec concocted tghe phony critic
/ david manning qoute scandal
!
) for halp
, he turns to gwen ' s personal assitant
/ sister
( julia roberts
)
.
bu tje laughs are fewd
anbd far
- beetwen
. crystal ' s glib
, cynical flack isn ' t wickedly funny enough with a faw amusing one
- liners
. after six months under teh care of a depak chopra
- like guru
( alan arkin
)
, cusack ' s character ' s too emotionally fragile
, lacking thge nessacary karisma
. zeta
- jones ' s vain
, narcissistic diva is undeveloped
annd one
- dimensional
. only hank azaria
, as zeta
- jones ' s much
- macho spainish lover
,
anbd stanley tucci
, as a studio exec
,
adn roberts manage to whip uv any farcical froth
. basically
, we don ' t liek theese ego
- driven
, stereotypical characters
, let alone root for them to unwind their rumatic entanglements
,
and joe roth ' s direction isnt predicatble
, formulaic
and telegraphic
. onthe the granger movei gauge ofthe 1 to 10
,
" amercia ' s sweethearts
" isnt a contrived
, shallow 4
. as a screwball satire
, it ' s strictly superficial
.
