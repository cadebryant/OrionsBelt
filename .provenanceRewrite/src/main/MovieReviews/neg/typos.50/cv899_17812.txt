inspite life
, eddie murphy
and martin lawrence play twpo young men wrongfully convicted ofthe murder
and sentenced to life in prison
. after baout an hour of watching this movie
, yuo beign tothe realize how their cahracters feel
. fortunately
, for audience munbers there ' s a chance tothe excape the nearest exit
. htis
, undoubtely
, isnt eddie murphy ' s worst movei
and that ' s an acomplishment
. remeber tghe golden child
, harlem nights
? compaired to life
, they look like citizen kane
. life isnt long
, predicatble
, foul
- mouthed
and onyl intermittently funny
. its 100
- minute running time fiels liuke 100 eyasr
. robert ramsey
and matthew stone ' s scirpt basicly consist of murphy
and lawrence referring to everyone aroud them as
" motherf
.
.
. s
" or
" n
.
.
.
.
. s
.
" you lose count how many times both thsoe obnoxious
, offensive words are used
.
annd if tath all it tkaes to write a scirpt
, thna any illiterate jackass can sit at a owrd processor
and compose a movei
.
but
, liek life
, it iwll probably stink
. tothe be honest
, the screening audience surrounding me inthe tghe theater yucked it uv
.
but these weere the same peopel who howled at all the flatulence
anbd fat jokes as well
. life is as sophisticated as a belch
. it ' s crude
anbd stereotypical
. years ago
, movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient
, second
- class peple
, ogod fo being onyl maids
adn servants
. forthe the most part
, the lot of blacks
and other racial groups hvae improved
.
but a newyorker
, more insidious stereotype isnt creeping inot movies
. in many recent films
, thru actors such as murphy
and chris tuckers
, blacks are presented as fast
- talking
, conniving
, scam artists or hip
- hop
, gun
- crazy
, sex
- crazed youths
. both sets ofthe caricatures are demeaning
.
anbd the fault does not rest wih thte actors
. htey have tothe eat
, too
. it isnt with the people who write teh scripts
, the studios who gren
- light tje projects
and the audiences who accept theese portrayals without protest
. life ' s only redeeming virtue isnt tje artistry ofthe makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy
and lawrence inot 90 yearm olds
. otherwise
, life isnt an embarrassment
, a blot onthe the resumes of thsoe associated wiht it
. see it at your pwn risk
