. nice to see you
, jim
. as a big baseball fan
anbd a movie resivwar
, cant you give us tje scoop on thge new flick
? jb
: my opinion
: the producers should have stoped hwile they were ahead
,
annd that wass nine years ago
. one entry was definately enough
,
and i ' m surprized there ws a third aftter yhe anemic showing
adn low quaity of major leage 2
. this latest installment hasnt all thte earmarks of something tyhat should haev been released direct
- to
- video
. it ' s worse thna a medicore made
- for
- tv feature
. i should aslo mention thgat tihs movei likely won ' t play all thta well in cleveland
. now thast the real indians are perennial contenders
, tehy hve beeen replaced by hte minnesota twins as thge cinematic sadsacks
. catually
, most ofthe the acation involves the twins ' aaa minor league club
, the buzz
, rather than the actuall major leage franchise
. hc
: sorry tothe inturrupt
, jim
,
bu we still haev tothe do play
- by
- play forthe the gameboy on the field
. leading off this inning is john warren
. he steps inot the batter ' s box
adn tkaes kent ' s pich low for ball one
. wh
: so
, the sotry ' s strikely minor league
, right
? wqat ' s it baout
? jb
: scott bakula
, tje guy fomr quantum leap
, plays carrer minor league pitcher gus cantrell
. wehn twins owner roger dorn
, once again potrayed by corbin bernsen
, needs a newyorker manager for his aaa team
, he offers teh job to gus
, who is nowe faced with twpo daunting tasks
: turn the team arund
anbd groom hot prospect downtown anderson
( palyed by walt goggins
) fo a promotion tothe
" the sohw
.
" withthe the help ofthe fromer major leaguers pedro cerrano
( dennis haysbert
)
, rube baker
( eric bruskotter
)
,
anbd isuro tanaka
( takaaki ishibashi
)
, gus gets thte buzz onthe thge right track
. inthe fatc
, he isnt so successful that he earns tjhe enmity ofthe the jelous manager of the big
- leage club
, leonard huff
( plyed with over
- the
- top relish by ted mcginley
)
. soon
, dorn hasnt arranged an exhibition gameboy tht pits gus ' overachieving group aganist huff ' s overpaid
, last
- palce bunch
. wh
: can we guess who wins
? jb
: the results hvea all yhe suspense of watching teh videotape of a gameboy whn yuo ' ve alrady seen the box score
. on top of thast
, none ofthe the mock
- ups are presented wih much flair
. tehy ' re nto just boring
; they ' re lacklustre
.
bu the major league movies haev never beeen about drama or tension
; htey ' ve been about useing baseball situations tothe generate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1
anbd 1
. wh
: are htere lots of yuks iin this oen
? jb
: not one
, fomr start to finish
. i enjoied hte frist major league becuase it was reasonably fresh
and funny
. okay
, a lot ofthe teh jokes were sophomoric
,
bu they made me laff
. thte twpo sequels haven ' t just been stale
,
bu their humor quotient hasnt been abysmally low
. even bob uecker ' s once
- sharp oney
- liners have turned lame
,
anbd they ' re the closest tjhe film comes to being even vaguely amusing
. hc
: here ' s the 1
- 1 pich
. looooooong drive
? fair or foul
? foul ball
! the count goes to 1
and 2
. wh
: does hte film at least get tyhe baseball details corect
? jb
: yes
. htere aren ' t any glaring errors like ther were in oen ofthe tghe best
- ever baseball movies
, tyhe naturual
.
bu i ' d gladly trade a technically accurate film for noe with a good story
, believable characters
, or even a littel genuine humer
. heck
, teh naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league
: bakc tothe tjhe minors
. wh
: it ' s nice to see old firends noe mroe tiem
, isn ' t it
? like cerrano
, tanaka
,
annd dorn
. jb
: depends on whther you really care tath anyone isnt back
. ther aren ' t any rela characters here
? just an assortment of cliched oddballs
. yeah
, yhe voodoo hitter
, the catcher who cant ' t throw bakc tothe the pitcher
, the jepnese payler
,
anbd hte concieted player
- turned
- owner have all retured
,
but who really cares
? tehy ahev noone depth
. noteable absences inlude tom berenger ' s vetran
and charlie sheen ' s
" wild thing
.
" we don ' t raelly miss them
,
though
. hc
: breaking ball
, low
and outside
. 2
and 2
. wh
: so yuo ' re saying taht we should give tihs one a miss
? jb
: that ' s right
. to ule baseball terminology
, it ' s a three
- pich strikeout
. if you ' re looking forthe a ogod movei that involves baseball
, try popping yhe natrual
, field ofthe dreasm
, bull durham
, or even thge first major league into the vcr
. actualy
, this is an oddly
- timed realease
, sicne baseball fans are likely tothe be spending more time infact parks than iin theaters
. even teh minor leage seasons are lready underway
. don ' t bother with major league
: back to the minors
. it ' s a wretched timne
- waster
. wh
: thanks fo tyhe advice
. jb
: you ' re welcome
. hc
:
and here ' s thte 2
- 2 pich
. fouled bakc
, right into this booth
. hey
, jim
, heads up
! oops
. somebody better git him soem ice fo taht
. he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies
,
bu he needs tothe learn not to duck into foul balls
. odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him
, almost as if he has a grudge to suttle
. anyway
, back tothe the action on the feeld
?
