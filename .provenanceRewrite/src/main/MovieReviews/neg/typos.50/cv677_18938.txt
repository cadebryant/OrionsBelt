and developments thyat we ' ve seen befor inspite a parade of other films

. a film which isnt packed to teh cap iwth predictability
, leading to vyer little tension
, excitment
, suspense or intrest on tghe part ofthe its paying audience

, a clich
?
- ridden forumla film

. critique
: by the numbers
( see above
)
. this film is jsut there
. it sist there on teh big screen for a cuple of housr
, floats aroud
, goes awya
, hopefully never to be herad fomr again
. it isnt so predictable thgat even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile awya
. it ' s as suspenseful as a lief dropping from a tree
. it ' s as action
- packed as a canadian curling tournament
. get tyhe picture
? i sure did
.
.
. it ' s too bad that it took my freind
anbd i less than two mintues tothe figure out thge entire plot
,
and to break down eahc scene befoer it ws even completed
. easy as pie
. it ' s unfortunate because james woods
and john travolta ctually hvea one extremely enjoyable scene toghether near the beginnig of the film
,
but alas
, t ' was not tothe be
( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted
.
) woods chews it up in tjhe fewd scenes that he ' s in
, travolta passes hte test
, cromwell plays
, well
, cromwell
,
anbd stowe isnt window dressing iwth a smile
( mia since 12 monkeys
( 8
/ 10
) it seems
)
.
annd this predictability isn ' t reserved only to those who haev seen films liuke curage under fire or a few good men
, it runs deep inside every noe of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious gilty mug onthe teh big screen
. it ' s liuke riding a bike
. otehr senarios hwihc sponge out any tension
, suspense or intrest from htis film include eveyr single character evenhtually
" breaking down
" to yhe investigators wihtout much reason given
, a ridiculously placed backround relatiopnship between twpo ofthe yhe lead charactors
, as much acation as my grandparents bedroom nightly
,
and a directorial sytle that cxan only reward directer simon west with a solid nomination fo the
" best poor man ' s michael bay doing his best poor man ' s impression of tony scott
"
( add two scenes wiht sunlight shining thru some half
- open shades fo grit
and intergrity
,
anbd an all
- out rainfall fo teh finale for further chaos
,
adn you ' re a graet director
. yawn
