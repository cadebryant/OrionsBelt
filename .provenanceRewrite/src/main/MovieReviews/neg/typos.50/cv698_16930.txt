well
, here ' s a distasteful
, throughly amateurish item tath
, suprizingly
, was atually a box
- office hitted at the tyme of its realease
. after jstu viewing thte film forthe the first tiem
, my primary question isnt how doed anyone whith an iq noth ofthe 35 enjoy this movie
? it isnt cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
,
and nto nearly as raunchy as i hadnt heared it was
. at least some smut woudl ahev livened thigns up a bited
.
" porky ' s
,
" tells hte story
( if you cant call it tath
) of four clueless high skool buddies
, pee weev
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
,
adn mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desparately wnat tothe get laid
. womens
, fo hte most part
, are a mystery to them
(
and inwhich thsi movie
, they are tothe the audience
, as well
, usance all of them are writed
anbd acted as if they are aliens from a different planet
)
. their plan is sidetracked
,
howver
, when htey venture out tothe a smarmy strip bar named porky ' s
, whihc tehy are able to git into useing fake id ' s
. after they pay tyhe manager one
- hundered bucks forthe threee hookers
, htey are played a trick onthe
and fidn themslves being dumped into the swamp below the buidling
. forthe these four teenage guys
, this means war onthe porky ' s
.
" porky ' s
,
" ultimatly manages to fail onthe alomst every possible levle
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it is not wild or amusing enought
. as a comedy
, all of hte jokes are predictable
and fall flat
. as a look bcak at the 1950 ' s
, it isnt something
, i suspect
, most peopel from tht era would wnat tothe bury deepo in a grav
.
and as a revenge movie
, it isnt a crushing bore
. noe ofthe the most offensive things about
,
" porky ' s
,
" isnt how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate thte film is about teenagers
. tjhe four main characters are nto even attemped tothe be developped as charachters
,
and we learn vrey littel about them
, except that they are horny
and woudl propably efel omre confortable inspite a preschool
. that sure isnt revealing infromation
. the female cahracters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay
and direction by bob clark
. the women are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rether thna rela people
. for exemple
, hte two gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
)
adn honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, onyl have noe purpose
,
and that is tothe be made fun of
. mrs
. balbricker isnt a gruff
, noone
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who wiull nto stand fo any foolishness
,
anbd
, in oney paticularly embarrassing scene forthe all involved
, honeywell has sex with a coach
anbd barks liuke a dog
. there isnt noone way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i haev the suspision they are not
)
,
but oney thing is fo sure
: htey are asked to do things in thsi film that are not at all funny
, only humiliating
. to proove how out
- ofthe
- touch thsi so
- called comedy isnt
, compare it to other more sereous 80 ' s films baout teenagers
,
and it looks even worse in comaprison
. any ofthe the john hughes pictures
, such as 1984 ' s
" sixteen candles
,
" or
, 1985 ' s
" tghe breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky ' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. those films actually dealt whith serious teen matters
,
bu remained a graet deal funnier
, thanks tothe theri bright
and truthful writing
.
and heck
, if
,
" porky ' s
,
" wnated to be a teenage sex movei
, i ' d tkae 1982 ' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982 ' s
" tjhe lsat american virgin
,
" over htis any day of the week
. directer bob clark is nto a bad director
. two years affter he made
,
" porky ' s
,
" he directed the nostalgic holdiay clasic
,
" a christmas stry
.
" i would foregive him forthe this misfire
, in fact
, if it wasn ' t for thge fact that he allso wroet tje screenplay
. just tyhe throught that somone would atually sit down tothe write such a peice of garbage
,
annd htink that it ws actually a film worth releasing upto tjhe unsuspecting world
, isnt actually a whole lot funnier than anytying in
,
" porky ' s
.
