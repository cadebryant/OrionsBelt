, boring
, one
- ect drivel witht noone suspense
, horribly unbelievable futuristic environment
, bad dialogue
, carrer
- defining bad acting by keanu reeves
anbd a hilarious ending
. it ' s too bad beacuse tghe premise of the film ws intresting
,
but unfortunately forthe my firends
and i
, tihs movie turned outloud tothe be jsut as bad as everyone hadnt warned us
. it ' s one of thsoe films tath makes you start laughing half
- way thru
, wehn you relize that most ofthe the actors in it suck
, tyhe location shots are filmed in dark
" junkyard
" tipe areas which htey would like to have us beileve to be futuristic
( whatever
.
.
.
)
,
and all the sets look liuke
.
.
.
. well
, sets
. ther is allso absolutly no arc tothe tihs stoy

adn
" x
- files
" episodes
, usance his segue into tyhe paranormal tv series wass much moreso entertaining than any ofthe this garbage

, henry rollins as a pumped
- uv cyber
- doctor or something
,
and ice

, canada
,
bu sadly enought for us all
, it ws
. some of the cyber
- travelling speical effects were okay
( hence
, tje 2
/ 10
)
,
but overall
, it ' s oney ofthe thsoe bad movies thgat ' s jstu funny to watch
and cringe at
. thankfully fo keanu
, he redeemed his sci
- fi career withthe 1999 ' s the matrix
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. it ' s too bad that he hasnt
yot tothe redeem his lack ofthe acting talent
