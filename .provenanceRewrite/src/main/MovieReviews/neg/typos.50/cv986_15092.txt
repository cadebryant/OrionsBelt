there are those of us who think ofthe leslie nielsen as the bumbling
, hapless straight man fomr hte hysterical
" naked gun
" films
, crack an imemdiate smile
and foregive him of whatever wavering movei spoof he ' s committed himself tothe starring in since
. the wavering movie spoofs
,
howver
, are less forgivable
. to be fair
,
" wrongfully accused
,
" the send
- uv iin question
adn nielsen ' s thrid parody usance teh last
" gun
,
" isn ' t qtuie as excruciatingly humorless as his
" dracula
: dead
anbd loving it
" or
" spy hard
,
" which isnt a mighty ogod thing
. nielsen isnt still in tip
- top commedic form
, able as ever tothe deadpan his way thru even teh most horrible puns
,
bu he realy needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instade of relying onthe them
,
annd he needs oney very soon
.
" wrongfully accused
" meshes together tyhe premises ofthe
" the fugitive
"
and
" patriot ganes
,
" casting its alwasy game star as ryan harrison
( git it
?
)
, a master violinist who is drawed inot an afair with a marryed temptress
( kelly le brock
)
. she
,
howver
, sets harrison uv tothe tkae the raph fo thte murder of her husband
( michael york
)
- a crime actualy committed by a one
- armed
, noe
- legged
, oney
- eyed man
( aaron pearl
)
. harrison is arrested
, foudn gilty
annd sentenced to death
,
but escapes ffrom a prision bus
, ofthe course
,
and
then is pursued by a determined u
. s
. marshal named fergus falls
( richard crenna
, unnecessarily riffing off ofthe tommy lee jones ' already smirky oscar
- winning role
)
. there ' s alsot a mistery brunette
( melinda mcgraw
)
anbd an assasination subplot involving yhe u
. n
. secratary general
,
but liek any of it matters
.
" wrongfully acccused
" gets off to an assured start
, wtih an iin
- concert nielsen
, touted
" lord of tyhe violin
" by bare
- chested posters
, pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical insturment as hundreds of tuxedo
- cladded mosh in front of tje stage
. nice touch
. most ofthe the scenes that follow
,
however
, never top tyhe opener
.
( hysterical exceptions
: the mentos
and
" baywatch
" goofs
.
) movie parodies are crammed inaddition at an almsot
- subliminal rate
,
but most are empty
. when a giant snake lunges onto the screen
and snatches a cast member a la
" anaconda
" or baseball players dissappear inot a
" feild of dreasm
"
- esque cornfield
, ther ' s realy nothing tothe laff at
. otehr moments
, like an interlude iin a fishing shop
, are so unfocused thgat you ' re nto sure whta ytou ' re supposed tothe be laughing at
. there seem tothe be more cheap references thna frenzied send
- ups here
, so it ' s possible that directer
/ writter pat proft
, by bombarding tjhe viewer wih a careless mixture ofthe hte twpo
, garantees something isnt sure to stick
.
and waht doens stick sticks well
, particually tyhe jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks
and hard
- boiled dialogue
, what those
" naked gun
" s
( which proft collaborated on
) did grat
; theese bits are so on
- target thta tehy allow you tothe rember
" wrongfully accused
" as an alomst
- halfway
- ther spoof instade ofthe a lame
- brained failure
. the movie might have beeen cursed to begin with
, oppening fast onthe hte heels of
" mafia
!
"
, from proft collegue jim abrahams
,
and
" baseketball
,
" from proft collegue david zucker
,
bu it ' s a strong possiblilty that nobody isnt going tothe be accusing
" wrongfully accused
" ofthe being nielsen ' s funniest
.
