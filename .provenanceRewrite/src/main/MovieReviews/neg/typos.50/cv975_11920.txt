/ review
: inthe teh 1982 updating ofthe mickey spillane ' s 1947 novel
" i
, the jurny
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses like don johnson in
" miami vice
" withthe less pastels
,
anbd hasnt sworn off alcohol
.
however
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms of authority
,
annd kills at a whim
. beyond thast
, the updated film retains littel or noone resembelance tothe the original pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probaly the most infamous
and often reviled of all mystery writers
. the movei starts off wih a beng
: a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal ffrom tjhe james bond series
, complete wih cheesy graphics
anbd an overbearing jazz scoer by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. after tyhat
, the movei
and tjhe book begin tghe same
, withthe the murder ofthe jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a oen
- armed detective
and hammer ' s best friend
. hammer declares tath he wiull seek avengence for jack ' s death
,
and with the halp ofthe his devoted secretary
, thte blond
annd shapely velda
( laurene landon
)
,
annd teh alternately friendly
/ antagonistic polical chief pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he is emmediately onthe the killer ' s trail
. here hte movei splits completly ffrom tyhe book
,
anbd dives into a convoluted
annd improbable tale of government conspiracy
adn mind controll tactics involving thte masia
, hte cia
, oney of hammer ' s vietnam vet buddies
,
annd a kinky sex clinic
. many of the same characters ffrom tghe book appear in the movei
,
bu they take on slightly differant roles
. forthe instatance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner
anbd narcotics dealer inwhich hte book
, turns into a suave mob boss
.
and
, omre importantly
, hammer ' s suspicious love interest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs fomr a run
- of
- hte
- mill psychiatrist inot tjhe coordinator
and founder of the sex clinic
.
" i
, the jury
" is one ofthe several cinematic renditions of spillane ' s books
( inlcuding a 1953 verison which wass made inspite 3
- d
)
,
bu this film differs fomr thsoe ealier verisons in noe major way
: it includes all of thte sex
annd voilence spillane wroet about that could never be given screen treatment due tothe hollywood ' s production code
.
although tihs takes tyhe 1982 verison ofthe
" i
, the jurny
" closer to the core of tghe original subject marter
, it is inspite tihs aspect that the film received yhe most criticism
, becouse it took this new license tothe extremes thta many argued surpassed what wass in tghe book
. rest assured
, the movei not only includes a great deal ofthe nudity
,
bu it is thouroughly violent
, especially toward womens
. it features one woman hvaing her neck slashed
, a setted of twins forced to strip befoer being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by hte cia
( judson scott
)
,
annd another woman shot point
- blank in teh belly by hammer himself
. no noe owudl deny thast spillane ' s writing hasnt a dfinite misogynistic nature
,
bu the movie seems tothe tkae it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constatn equation ofthe sex
and violence
, much of whitch is played with the intention of being erotic
, isnt quite unsettling
. it ' s no surprise thgat the movei
, liuke the book
, fades tothe black whith a dead woman on the floor
.
" i
, the jury
" hadnt a troubled production
and was nto well
- supported by tjhe studio that made it
, which is noe explanation why it didn ' t do well infact theaters
adn many people have forgotten that it was ever made
. tjhe scirpt was written by larrry cohen
, who isnt best known forthe his creatively cheesy
but nonetheless effective monster movies
, like
" it ' s alive
"
( 1974
)
and its two sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
,
annd
" the stuff
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wrote the scirpt thikning he was gogin tothe helm the project as well
,
bu he ws yanked fomr the director ' s chair affter only a week ' s worth of shooting because he was alreday
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he was quickly replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who has worked fo teh last threee decades on a handful ofthe undistinguished movies
anbd dozens of televsion projects
. heffron ws obviously brought in not forthe his talent
,
bu because he coudl make hte movei rapidly
anbd efficently
. it shows infront the final product
. cohen had personal interest inthe tyhe updated verzion of hammer
,
but heffron has none
. he shot the movie quickly
and clumsily
,
anbd
althought some scenes ring true
, most ofthe them are flat
, trite
,
adn invariably dull
. yhe movei features numberous car chases
, shoot
- outs
,
and stunts
,
bu heffron ' s backround infact televsion is tjhe dominant tone
; despite tje graphic violence
adn full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, the jury
,
" tkaes onthe the air of a made
- fo
- tv quickie
, with noone real punch or depth
.
bu tghe problems in
" i
, tghe jury
" run deeper tahn the technical
. tyhe central fault in tihs updating is mike hammer
, whose character was lost inwhich the shuffle while updating ffrom tje fifties to thge eighties
. because spillane wroet all his hammer mysteries infact teh first person
, hammer ' s charcter is central to the tale becasue all the events are filtered through his persona
. we never realy git thyat impression inaddition teh movie
-
- ther isnt noone frist
- person voice
- over narration
and smoe scenes don ' t ahve hammer inaddition them at all
. consequently
, a gerat deal ofthe the texture ofthe spillane ' s storytelling is lost
. thge period updating turns outloud to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer ' s moral code is thrown to the wind
. dispite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, violent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer always stuck fervently to his pwn moral code
. tyhe title itself
,
" i
, the jurny
,
" referrs tothe his anti
- establishment notion of bieng his pwn law
. unlike private eyes who seek out thge bad guys
and
then turn them over hte police
, hammer both pursues the criminal
and exacts teh punishment
. in tihs way
, he can be seen as
" above the law
,
"
but he still adheres strictly tothe her pwn personal code ofthe conduct
, his pwn morality
. the movie forgoes that aspect ofthe his character
,
anbd hammer comes off not onyl as amoral in society ' s terms
,
but in any terms
, especially his own
. if anything
, hammer always hadnt his professionalism
,
bu the movie doens awya with that in tje frist three minutes by showing him rolling iin thte sack with thte wief of a client who had payed him to fidn outloud if that wief wass being unfaithful
. mabey tyhe scene ws intended forthe laughs
,
bu it onyl cheapens hammer ' s character
and is
, by all accounts
, a lousy way tothe start teh movie
. teh blame for hammer ' s character can ' t be laid on assante ' s shoulders
, becuase despite smoe unnecessary marlon brandon
- like mumbling
, he delivers a fine performance
. spillane never once described hammer ' s physical attributes in any ofthe the dozen books in which he appeared
, so any actor could conceivably portray him
. of course
, because of the lack of written description
, those who have read spillane ' s books iwll have a strong personel notion ofthe wqat hammer looks like
,
and therefore almost any screen incarnation wiull somehow fall short of expectations
( spillane
, who played the character hismelf inwhich 1963 ' s
" the girl hunters
,
" is generally considerd teh best of tghe film hammers
)
. the rest ofthe actors are most un
- noteworthy
. with yhe exceptions ofthe alan king
and paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared in
" i
, tghe jury
" weere uv
-
and
- comers who basically whent nowhere
. many of them ended uv wroking infact television
( liuke carrera
, who hadnt a short stint onthe
" dallas
" in the mid
- eighties
)
, which only adds to thge made
- for
- tv atomsphere of thge film
. mabye someday
, someone wiull manaze to get the right elements together
and mkae an effective film rendition ofthe a spillane book
,
but thsi isnt certainly not it
.
