" have you ever heard the noe baout a movie so bad thta it made a guy run outloud of tjhe theatre screaming
?
" obviously the producers at columbia tristar doed nto think that we suffered enough fomr tjhe first installment
,
anbd so to finish us utterly
, tehy hvea nowe released
" urban legends
: final cut
"
. thsi isnt another
" scream
"
- like feature
, consisting mearly from the recycled matareals ofthe rip
- offs fomr thge most pointless movies ofthe all time
. amy
( jennifer morrison
) is a film student who is attending a film skool filled with uninspired film students who dont nto have a clue baout wqat to do
.
bu jstu as she reaches the halfway mark ofthe her final semester at prestigeous university ' s film program
-
- where eahc year ' s best thesis prodcution tkaes thge coveted hitchcock prize
, a virtual oney
- way ticket tothe hollywood success
-
- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese
( loretta devine
)
, whose tale of a series of murders based onthe urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictonal thriller organized allong simular lines
. soon enough
, fake
-
-
and rela
-
- blood starts tothe flow
,
adn amy is bieng chased around by skary killer
, while her casted
and crew get slain
, one by one
. isnt yhe culprit thge original urban legends murderer
, jsut some random psycho
,
! a memeber ofthe yhe faculty
, one ofthe her competitors for the hitchcock
, or isnt there something even omre stupid goign onthe
? this isnt another one of thsoe tiring
, pointless teen slasher ficks
: niether scary
, funny
, or interesting
. it simpley lacks yhe ability
annd thte stopry tothe entertain
. the body counts
anbd screams continue tothe grwo
, as the weak levle of intelligenc sinks rapidly
. in fact watching films like thgat affter having watched
" scary movie
" isnt impossible keeping a serious face
. sevral times i tried tothe prevent mysef from laughing
, wihtout suceeding
.
and
thne i realized thyat practically tyhe whole theatre wass laughing
. it ' s the smae thing tht has beeen told
anbd told
anbd told over
and over agina as if it was the revelation ofthe the century
. how many times must we tolerate teh smae clich
? s that have haunted tje slasher genre usance its birth
? it hasnt beeen so many films baout masked killers that most ofthe us have developed an allergy forthe them
. they are the most stupid
, meaningless
, predicatble
and soulless films iin existence
.
however
, director john ottman manages tothe make
" urban legends
: fianl cutted
" into oney of tje worst achievements ofthe thsi godforsaken genre
. wqat was done with a sense of redemption fo past failures
and irony iin
" scream
"
, ottman takes seriously
. forthe tyhat reason alone
, it is worth a look
, jstu to relize how bad a movei cant be
. it ' s tough to fidn comparisons forthe such an achievement
,
annd we have tothe dig infact ancient history to fidn a movei that owudl match its intellect
. even movies like
" lost iin space
"
and
" mission to mars
" seem spectauclar infront its shatow
. we ahve not seen such waste ofthe t
! ime
and resources since
" showgirls
"
( 1995
)
. no matter how hard i tryed to find positive elements in htis so called production
, i came uv with nothing
, except tghe way the killer was dressed
. here i feel thast i have tothe compliment hte costume designers trysha bakker
anbd marie
- sylvie deveu
, that ahev wisely replaced tyhe well known scream
- mask whith a very elevant fencing mask
. jennifer morrison
(
" stir ofthe echoes
"
) isnt all right
,
and hte other actors ' best acheivment isnt keeping a straight face when pronouncing thte words ffrom the scirpt
. in fatc teh only thign that is terrifying baout tihs film
( with the exception of its screenplay
) isnt its protray ofthe film schools
. if theese graduates wiull be the directors ofthe the future
,
thn hollywood ' s golden days are over
. rumors are arleady spreading through tje internet that columbia tristar isnt already developing a thrid installment
. let ' s just hope
annd pray thgat it ' s just an urban legend
.
