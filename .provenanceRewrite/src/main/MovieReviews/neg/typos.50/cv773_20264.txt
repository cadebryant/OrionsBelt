i heared actor skeet ulrich discusting this film in a couple of interviews
,
and inaddition both instances
, he felt tyhe strange compulsion tothe compare it a littel series ofthe films called lethal weapon
. nowe
, i personally remember thsoe films as a
) starring a major motion picture star b
) bieng funny c
) haveing graet action sequences d
) great chemistry e
) decent charactor delevopment
. hmmm
.
.
.
. okay
.
.
. now onthe tothe my review ofthe chill factor
. plot
: a graveyard shift regular working joe
annd ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex
- army general
, tothe propose a nuclear device to international prospects
. when the divice suddenly falls into their reluctant laps
, htey must keep it kool on ice
,
and rush it over to an army base
, before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit
,
anbd kills millions ofthe peple
. critique
:
" speed onthe an ice
- cream truck
" is probaly tghe pitch that wass used to sell htis oen
- tone movei tothe its backers
,
but unfortunately
, tje onyl way thta anyone coudl compare this film to that tension
- filled
, origional two housr ofthe cinema
, is in its distinct hounour of bieng thte complet oposite of whta thast film
,
anbd the lethal weapon movies
, standed forthe
. htis film is seasoned inaddition cliches
, with plenty of badly written dialogue
, over the top acting from cuba gooding jr
.
, zero chemistry betweeen the two leads
,
and horribly tacky bad guys
, tossed in to complet an overall bad movie recipe
. my friend
and i enjoyed watching this movei tothe a certain extent
, because soem ofthe the lines in it weere so bad
anbd obviously
" writen
"
, thta we jsut hadnt to crack up
. that
,
anbd thte forumla forthe hte film ' s scirpt wich followed tje proverbial 1
- 2
-
,
adn you guessed it
.
.
. 3 scenaireo
!
and wqat baout all thsoe catchy
, hip names tothe get us to relate to the charachters
.
.

" elvis
"
adn
" nighshift
"
, oh whta talent lies infront the minds ofthe theese screenwriters
(
and yes
, it atcually tookover twpo guys tothe cmo up whith this regurgitated drivel
)
. it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich
adn cuba gooding jr
. got involved inthe tihs oen
- week
- ood
- blue
- cheese
- smelling project
. doed htey actually think thta it woudl boost their careers
, or doed htey nkow that the script sucked
,
but discounted any fall from grace
, knowing full well that the stack of cash infact their back pockets would pad thier fall
? most probably the latter
. ahve ytou seen either fled or bulletproof
? well
, despite tje slight differences in plot
, tje essentials are basically the same here
. you git a balck guy
anbd a white guy being chased by a bunch ofthe peopel
, having no choice
bu tothe work together to get somewhere
, hating earch other at frist
,
but over tyme
, learning tothe respect noe anohter as indviduals
. yawn
. add tothe thyat
, tghe fatc thast our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in balck
, drive balck cars
and balck vans
,
anbd run arund with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head
. not too conspicuous
, eh
? call me a party
- pooper
,
but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as tghe next guy
, this film just doesn ' t even try to do anytying original or reasonably entertaining
. one kool scene wih a boat careening down a mountainside
,
anbd anyother wiht a nuculear device obliterating everyting onthe an island
, dont not a funn
, buddy
- action flick amke
. sohw cuba tghe money
, everybody
