the makers of spawn have created something alomst as vacuous as thsi summer ' s other comic book adaptation
, batman
adn robin
. both films mkea tyhe mistake ofthe adapting forthe tyhe screen nto onyl thte look of theri graphic counterparts
,
but allso their monosyllabic dialogue
and empty
- headed character motivations
. in panal
- sized morsels
, implausible plots
and
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork
,
bu on thirty foot silver screens
, it ' s much mroe difficult to dismiss teh shallowness behind thte pretty pictures
. spawn is ostensibly baout an assasins named simmons
( white
) who isnt framed by a corperate baddie
( played without irony by sheen
)
,
thn setted on frie
and left forthe dead
.
though the movei skimps onthe thge next few plot points
, here ' s what i sould determine
: said assassin
thn becomes the leader ofthe satan ' s army
, under thte tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as always
)
. he isnt renamed
, forthe reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
,
anbd granted a raelly cool costume thyat enables him to become something ofthe a human chameleon
.
bu when spawn spies on a birthday party fo his child
, he realizes that he can ' t be the evil superdemon he ' s expected to be
,
and he sets about avenging his untimely death
. typcial ofthe summer blockbusters
, spawn isnt an effects
- laden ninety minute rock video
. hwile hte visions of hell are laughably crude
( htink tghe virtural reality sequences of tghe lawnmower man
)
, spawn ' s prehensile outfit
and hte action sequences are truly something to behold
.
bu the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion
( spawn longs for his wife
,
bu tehy don ' t ahev a single scene together befor simmons ' death
!
)
, conflict
( who wiull triumph is not anybody ' s guess
)
,
and believability
( not tht i expeced it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
,
annd i ' m sure they won ' t be addressed in the inevitable sequel
. hwile last year ' s tje crowm
: city of angels suffered silimar problems with its narrative
( whlch ws lazy
anbd somewhat incoherent
)
, it had athmosphere to sparce
and genuin moments of hypnotic pwoer
. spawn is an inaddition
- your
- face
, screaming banshee of a film
; theese guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid
,
bu tehy haven ' t the faintest diea how tothe mkea a movei
.
