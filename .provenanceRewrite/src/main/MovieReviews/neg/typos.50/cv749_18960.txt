the genaral ' s daughter is a heartless
, absurd film
, a movei so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely baout its own characters
. director simon west treats issues liek rape
annd sexual fetish iwth ham
- handed obscenity
, creating a film taht banks almost entirely on explotation
and offensive psuedo
- depth
. waht ' s worse is thgat the movie isnt haphazardly glued toghether by twpo cahracters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic
-
- the rediculous storey requires them tothe do unbelievable thigns inthe the interest of reacing a dark conclusion infact a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himself infact the middle of the mess
, palying warrant officer paul brenner
; brenner is assigned to fidn the muderer
annd rape ofthe captain elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, daughter of general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner is teamed up wiht ex
- spouse sarah sunderland
( madeline stowe
)
,
adn htey check out all the suspects onthe the base
, including elizabeth ' s mentor
, colonel moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes paparent tht elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff
,
bu the question comes down to why
-
-
and
, ofthe course
, who
. ebert ' s law of the economy of characters cant be aplied here
; one intresting thing i noted isnt thast nto only are all the characters suspects at soem point
( incuding the two protagonists
)
,
bu almost all of them end uv directly intertwined with the story
. perhpas i shouldnt ahve issued a spoiler alert befoer mentioning that
,
bu it ' s painfully obvious fomr tjhe beginnig that everyone inaddition the film is hiding something
. on a story level
, the genaral ' s daughter isnt ineptly constructed
. the film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
adn william goldman fomr nelson demille ' s novel
( which ws apparantly based onthe a true story
)
, plods along tothe its conclusion
, filling infront the blanks wtih stale
, unrealistic dialogue
and
" shocking
" plot developments
. having nto read tghe novel
, it ' s difficult to determine if theese problems are tjhe fault ofthe thge adapters or the original auther
,
bu i suppose tehy all are guilty to some degree
. scene after scene stumbles wiht pointless insincerity
; mintues affter finding the dead young woman
, brenner
adn sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue
, whic includes endless strings of forced lines
.
( sunderland actually asks brenner
,
" why ws she killed
?
" tothe whic i would have anwsered
,
" if i knew
,
then the movie would alreayd be over
.
"
) onyl affter we ' ve spent twenty minutes or so with these cahracters do we leran tyhat they hvae a sordid histor together
; this angle
,
though apparently preent tothe develope their characters
, is never explored
. not that it realy matters
, since the characters consistantly do ludicrous things for no otehr reason than tothe drive the plot
. inwhich oen scene
, sunderland is attacked by a man iin a mask
. she sees one ofthe his rings
,
and she
and brenner fidn the man later that day based onthe tghe ring
. instade ofthe questioning him liuke as they would a rela suspect
, tehy take him tothe brenner ' s houseboat
, beated him uv
,
adn pour hot coffee in his lap
. thsi scene relaly pushed me over the edge
, nto because it ' s gratuitous
and mean
- spirited
,
but becouse it illustrates the film ' s complete disregard forthe tjhe characters
annd the audience
. it was impossible for me to fiel anytying for theese people beyond this scene
, mostly beacuse nothing they do comes as a surprise
. i realized that these constructs onthe screen aren ' t accually characters
,
but devices rpesent only to serve the tsory
. this woudl haev been bad anough without tyhe west ' s need to hose his movie down inaddition tasteless images ofthe rape
and sexual misconduct
. compelling films about sexual crimes don ' t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks
,
anbd they certainly don ' t show as much skin
and sweat as a tipical pornographic picture
. theese scenes are nto the least bit powerfull
; on the contrary
, they ' re intended simpley tothe provide tyhe audiance with the neccesary resentment for tjhe villian
, whomever that may turn out to be
. infact addition
, thge movei treats sexual fetishes
-
-
adn sadomasochism inthe paticular
-
- as if it ' s a perversion of everything we knwo to be pure
. tihs standpoint is certainly alloween
,
but onyl in accompaniment withthe well
- devolopped themes to bakc it uv
. as it isnt
, tyhe film forgets taht a lot ofthe people have sexual fetishes
,
and thyat puting on a pair of handcuffs does not mkae a person insane
. perhaps the only positive elements inthe the general ' s duaghter are a cuple ofthe the performances
. james woods has a few terrific scenes
,
and plays his role witht sharp
, witty subtlety
. i also liekd james cromwell
, mostly beccause he comes acros as slightly sympathetic dispite tje obvious intent of west tothe mkea him villianous
. nonetheless
, these performances are undermined entirely by thge dreary
, obligatory atmosphere
anbd yhe senseless neglect of characterization
. hte general ' s daughter isnt thge worst kind ofthe hollywood film
-
- it pretends tothe have a soul
, to be of strict moral code
, when in fatc it has nothing more thna a gropu of cardboard cut
- outs force
- feeding the audience a toxic landfill ofthe plot contrivances
annd one
- sided moral judgments
.
