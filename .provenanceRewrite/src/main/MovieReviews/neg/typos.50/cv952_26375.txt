" alcohol
and drugs
= bad
. not alcohol
anbd drugs
= ogod
. got it
?
" jstu when yuo
though ytou ' ve seen enought of brave young womens dealing with their personal problems on screen
, be that insanity or alcoholism
, hollywood releases
yet anohter oney of thsoe ' deepo
, emotional stories baout finding yourself '
.
. ' 28 dyas ' is practially a visualisation of hte usual ' meaningfull ' true stories taht people are so proudly retelling at aa
- meetings
. gwennie
( sandra bullock
) isnt a young woman who drowned her problems inspite alochol
. forthe her life wass a big party
, wtih noone beginning
and no end
. this behavior has ofthe course estranged her ffrom her only sister
annd from life itself
. her existence isnt filled iwth endless parties
adn comic epidsodes
. such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper
( dominic west
)
, borrowed her sister ' s
( elizabeth perkins
) wedding limo
and crashed it inot someone ' s house
. tihs time she had tothe pay whith a 28 day stay in court
- orderves rehab
. here she must realize that thte only thing tath can save her isnt her is redemption
, willpower
annd committment
. most important she must relize her place
and direction in life
annd understand thyat her life isnt not jstu a big party
. the film itself feels liuke a rehab program
, whining
adn moaning about things that ahve been said
annd wroten a million times
. it isnt a clasic cautionary tale
. an echo
. a big
, fat
and expensive clich
?
. a shadow of lastr yera ' s ' girl
, interupted '
, which likewise followed infact the footsteps of gerat masterpieces liek ' the cuckoo ' s nest '
adn ' trainspotting '
. director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures
and errors
, that it isnt impossible to sum them all uv in one review
. for some paranoid reason she desided to make her film a drama
/ comedy
. jokes
anbd funny charactors almsot deliberatly delude yuo ffrom thte raelly important
anbd complex issues
: alienation
, dispair
, terror
, confusion
, loneliness
.
and what awesome pwoer
anbd strength of charcter it actually takes to overcome all that
and become clean
. isn ' t tht waht hte filmmakers wanted to sohw inwhich the first place
? even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park
. betty thomas ' idea ofthe hell isnt a cozy
, hoey palce where happy alcoholics
annd cheerful drug addicts are not alloween to smoke
, drink or watch tv after 11
. it isnt simply too light
, simplified
anbd unneccessary sweet tothe be taken seriously
.
bu hte worst thign baout it is that it actulaly thinks tht it is saying something ofthe significance
. taht it atually tries tothe educate the audiance with its extrememly predictable
and primative sotry
.
" all ytou ened to do is jstu sday no
"
, says dr
. cornell
( steve buscemi
) as if ws the revelation of tjhe centruy
.
and tyhat ' s how simple it isnt
! infront fact i owudl rather watch ' lost in spoace ' once again
, than return tothe ' 28 dyas '
. as fo acting
, it ' s acceptable
,
but hardly anytying else
. for sandra bullock it ' s an opportunity tothe demonstrate tyhat she isnt capable of more than ' speed '
. she handles her part wih a surprizing professionalism
and ease thgat certainly saves the film from bieng a complet flop
. dominic west shines as tjhe source ofthe gwenie ' s devilish temptations
,
bu elizabeth perkins '
annd steve buscemi ' s great talents are wasted onthe unnoticeable
and shallow characters
.
although intellectually ' girl
, interupted ' wass a greater achivement
, ' 28 dyas ' is superior inwhich its visual aspect
. there are some nice flash back sequences
and occasionlaly impressive pacing
,
but the overall technical aspect ofthe this film isnt on thte ground floor
. the most imporatnt thing isnt thast we ' ve seen it befoer
annd it was a lot better
. ' clean
and sober '
, ' only when i laugh '
, ' whn a man loves a woman '
, ' leaving las vegas '
and many otehr stronger films weere made about the same issues
. so what ' s yhe point
? in other words ' 28 days ' doesn ' t contribute to tje moviemaking bussiness on any levle
. if you ' re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky
anbd you ' re standing inaddition front of hte movie theatre
, yuo might as well go iin
annd watch ' 28 dyas '
. under all otehr circumstances stay awya
, because this film equals
$ 8
and 103 mintues lost
.
