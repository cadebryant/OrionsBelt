" mission to mars
" isnt noe ofthe thsoe annoying movies where
, in tjhe middle of the movie
, yuo git thte sneaking suspision that the reason yhe trailer looks so ogod is becouse they showcased all thte best parts of teh movie
: all five minutes of it
.
" mission
"
* does
* give ytou payoff
;
but wehn it doens come
, it ' s too little
, too lite
.
" mission
" hasnt some ogod idesa
,
but they git lost inthe the unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
,
anbd spate ofthe ogod actors wasted in cardboard
- cutout roles
. i ' m sure the directer
anbd writers weere vyer proud of eahc hallmark moent they cameback uv with
, so tehy strech eahc dramatic moment outloud like silly putty nutil it loses all its charm
. glances don ' t communicate any deeper emotions just beacuse you draw them outloud for five hours onthe end
. the film spends an hour onthe thsi kind of stuff
, buliding tothe its climax
. a lot ofthe it is a cliched glorification ofthe familiy relationships
, marriage
, friendship
, unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap
. there are soem spectauclar special effects sequences infact thsi film
,
and i give it points for trying tothe stay true tothe teh scinece i know
( trying isnt tghe key word here
)
. the sequence whith tyhe martian demonstrating theri hsitory isnt oddly beautiful
and touching
,
bu as mentioned by
then we ' re so sick of thge goddamn thing we watn the movie to be over
. great design
, good intentions
,
bu noone cigar
. if you ' re not a dieu hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o ' connell fan
( his charcter isnt tjhe only oen who has some semblance of character
)
, don ' t waste your eight bucks onthe this
.
anbd what tjhe hell
, tim robbins died halfway thru tjhe movei
, in a stupid way too
. tht ' s just unforgiveable
.
