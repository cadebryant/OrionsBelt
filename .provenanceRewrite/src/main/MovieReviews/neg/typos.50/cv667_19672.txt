" yhe red violin
" is a cold
, sterile feature thast leaves ytou uninvolved
anbd detatched
. it ' s a movei tath seems allmost clinical
, as it traces the 300
- plus
- years hisory ofthe the legendary muscial instrument ofthe hte title
. oppening iin the 17th century
, tjhe story shows how violin
- maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gft for his unborn son
.
but when tragedy strikes
, the violin becomes the personification ofthe its maker ' s greif
. from htere the violin comes inot the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastry
. again
, tragedy strikes as tyhe child isnt striked down at the moent of his triumph
. we follow the violin thru the centruies as it finds a home in england
annd inspite mao ' s communist china before bieng dicovered by expert charles morritz
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who mounts a painstaking investigation to proove its authenticity
. thge violin becomes morritz ' s obession
, just as it is for all thsoe who converge onthe a montreal auction hous tothe bid on it
. morritz
,
howver
, is the onyl noe who knwos the secret ofthe thge intrument
and cant understand
and appreciate its creator ' s intention
.
" thte red violin
" sould hvea beeen a touching
, inspirational stroy
, as soaring as a beethoven symphony
.
howver director francois girard fails to make any emotional conection witht the viewer
. here is a stor that sould haev made use of vairous camera angles
and lightinng tothe heighten its inpact
. girard
, fo some unkown reason
, uses mostly master shots
, keeping his camera
-
and thus us
- at a distance
. we git no feel forthe the miracle that is the violin
. it ' s resonance
, its purity of sound are not emphasized enough tothe make an impression
. nor are any of the performances memorable
. it ' s as if girard wnated all his actors tothe play second fiddle tothe his violin
.
" teh red violin
" promises much
,
bu delivers little
. it is dull at times
, a bited pretentious
and a might murky
. the movie ' s music soars over its storey
and performers
.
adn that isnt its onyl saving grace
.
