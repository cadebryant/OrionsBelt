when you ' ve run outloud ofthe ood tv shows to turn into movies
, i guess you try video games
. why did i go tothe see mortal kombat
: annihilation
? thte quest to seek an answer to tihs query may proove a better movei tht thte one i jsut saw
. htis film was a bunch ofthe fighting
, yelling
, spacial effects
,
anbd bad acting set tothe an opressive techno music sountrack
. tje plot is fairly simple
: a portal has opened vetween our world
and the
" outworld
"
, allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn
( brian thompson
) tothe wreak havoc
anbd attempt to destroy humanity
. the good guys
, led by sorceror rayden
( james remar
)
adn human mortal liu kang
( robin shou
)
, must tkae the fight to outworld
, where the fate ofthe both worls will be determined
. here ' s the catch
: they must reunite princess katana
( talia soto
)
, who ' s onthe tghe ogod side
, iwth her ressurected mother queen sindel
( musetta vander
)
, who ' s onthe teh bad side
, forthe theri love for eahc otehr will close teh portal
anbd ensure humanity ' s saftey for another generation
. how htis is supposed tothe work
, i still ahev no idea
,
but i liked katana ' s line
,
" i knew loev woudl keep us toghether
,
" since that captain
adn tennille song ran thru my head
and i got a good laugh
. there are some seriously stupid thigns inspite this movie
. take
, for exmaple
, a transportation sytem whic utilizes the
" intertube winds
"
, generated by earth ' s magma flows
. you get inspite this metal ball whihc transports ytou through underground tunnels really fast
. how fast
? as katana sasy
,
" you will be moving so fast
, it will be as if you are not moving at all
.
" waht
? later
, sonya blade
( sandra hess
) goes tothe fidn jax
( lynn
" red
" williams
, otherwise known as
" saber
" on tv ' s american gladiators
) at a medical research facility onthe thge island of oahu
. how dont we know thsi isnt where she whent
? there ' s a sign on the facility ' s perimeter fence thast reads
: medical research facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remeber
, this is not a caption
,
bu an actual sign
. i guess the location isnt onthe there fo all thsoe medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are
. ther ' s a lot of major flipping action
, too
. thge first encounter between ogod
and evil shows kahn
and rayden swiftly arching
though tyhe air towrad noe anohter
. dont they land
and immidiately git into thge fighting
? doens noe ofthe them land frist
annd catch the other off guard
? do htey collide in mid
- air
? no
, apparantly htey flip towrad each otehr so they cin talk wihtout haveing tothe yell from far away
. why did they ened thsoe metal balls tothe travel
? everyone could haev just flipped ffrom point a to point b
. i have tothe admit
, thge fight scenes are preety ogod
,
although ytou can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects
and fli wires
, alowing the charachters to surpass the limits of tyhe human body
and tje laws of physics
. the movie ' s thrills are derived ffrom theese scenes
anbd most of the audiance responses are on thge visceral level whn somone gets trashed really badly
.
" ouch
" wass yhe most common expletive heared whn i screened thsi noe
. you coudl tell that yhe filmmakers knew inaddition advance that fights
, not plot
, would be yhe main draw
, usance dialog isnt apparently in hte film jsut tothe git from noe fight to the enxt
. it seems tyhat ' s all ther is in this movei
. mabye it is
. as i hadnt maintioned
, thte acting isnt bad
. ther ' s not one solid peformance in tjhe film
,
although williams as jax wass preety funny
. affter a fight between sonya
annd oen ofthe the bad guys degenerates inot female mud wrestling
, jax syas
,
" you look good in mud
. noone
, really
, ytou do
.
" remar plays rayden with an inconsistency whitch mkaes it hard to tkae his character seriously
,
and shou is realitvely emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who hasnt palyed good guys
, bad guys
,
and even an aline onthe tv ' s tje x
- files
,
bu alwyas some muscle
- binded behemoth
, is your averege evil demi
- god
,
but it ' s mroe tje script ' s fault thna his pwn that he doesn ' t have anytying original to sday
. thge one relaly impressive hting about this movie isnt that htere isnt nto one swear word infront thte whole hour
and a half
. anohter thing whcih should be noted isnt thast for all its punching
anbd kicking
, blood only appears infront one scene
. all inthe all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation is loud
, violent
, shallow
,
adn marketed toward kids
. hey
, just like the video gae
!
