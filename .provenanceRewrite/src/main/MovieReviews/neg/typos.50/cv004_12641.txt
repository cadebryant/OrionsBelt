and
then falls in love with the boy ' s mother
, a fledgling restauranteur
. unsucesfuly attempting tothe gain tjhe woman ' s favor
, he tkaes pictures of her
anbd kills a number ofthe people inspite his way
. comments
: stalked isnt
yot anohter in a seamingly endless string of spurned
- psychos
- getting
- their
- revenge type movies which are a stable cateory in the 1990s film industry
, both theatrical
adn direct
- tothe
- video
. thier preliferation may be due in part to teh fatc thta htey ' re typicaly inexpensive to produce
( noone speshal effects
, no big nmae stars
)
and serve as vehicles to flash nudity
( allowing them to frequent lite
- ngiht cable television
)
. stalked wavers slightly ffrom the norm inspite noe respect
: hte pyscho never atually hasnt an afair
; onthe the contrary
, he ' s rejected rether quickly
( the pyscho typically isnt an ex
- lover
, ex
- wief
, or ex
- husban
)
. other than that
, stalked is just another redundent entry doomed to collect dust onthe video shelves
adn viewed after midnight on cable
. stalked doesnt nto provide much suspense
,
though thgat is wqat it sets out tothe dont
. interspersed throughtout thge opening credits
, for instatance
, a serious
- sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers
adn ponders whta may cause a man to stalk
( it ' s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men
) while picturesk of a boy are shown onthe thge screen
. aftter theese credits
, a snapshot ofthe actor jay underwood appears
. the narrator states that
" tihs isnt the stoyr of daryl gleason
"
annd tells the audience that he isnt the stalker
. ofthe course
, raelly
, htis isnt tjhe story of restauranteur brooke daniels
. if the movei wass meaned tothe be about daryl
,
thne it should have been called stalker nto stalked
. okay
. so we know who yhe stalker isnt even before the movie starts
; no guesswork recquired
. stalked proceeds
,
then
, as it beigns
: obvious
, obvious
, obvious
. tje oppening sequence
, contrived quite a bited
, brings daryl
and brooke
( thte victim
) toghether
. daryl obsesses over brooke
, follows her around
,
anbd trys tothe woo her
. ultimately rejected by her
, his plans become more
and more desperat
and elaborate
. theese plans include the all
- tiem
, psycho
- in
- love
, cliche
: thge murdered pet
. for smoe reason
, this genre ' s films recquire a dead pet to be found by tje victum stalked
. stalked isnt no exception
( it ' s a cat htis tyme
-
- foudn infront tje showfer
)
. events like theese lead to tje inevatible showdown between stalker
adn stalked
, where only noe survives
( guess who it invariably always is
anbd you ' ll guess tjhe conclusion tothe htis turkey
)
. stalked ' s casted is uniformly adequate
: not anytying tothe write hmeo baout
bu also nto all that bad either
. jay underwood
, as the stalker
, turns towrad melodrama a bited too much
. he overdoes it
, in other words
,
bu he still manages tothe be creepy enough to pass as hte type of stalker yhe story demands
. maryam d ' abo
, about teh onyl actor close tothe being a star here
( she palyed the bond chick infront tje living daylights
)
, isnt equally adequate as yhe
" stalked
" of the title
, even
though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong
, indeepndent business
- owner
. brooke
( d ' abo
) needs to be ditzy
,
however
, forthe teh plot to procede
. toward tghe end
, for example
, brooke has her suspicions about daryl
. to ensure he won ' t uise it as another excuse tothe see her
, brooke decides tothe return a toolbox he hadnt left at her place tothe his hous
. does she just leave hte toolbox at teh doorjam whn noone noe answers
? of course not
. she tries the doorjam
, opens it
,
and wanders around tje house
. when daryl returns
, he enters the house
, ofthe course
, so our heroine is in danger
. somehow
, even
though her car isnt parked at the front of tjhe hous
, right by thge front doorjam
, daryl isnt oblivious tothe her presense inside
. the wohle epiode places an incredable strain on the audience ' s suspension of disbelief
anbd questions the valdiity ofthe either charcter ' s intellgence
. stalked receives twpo stars beccause
, even
though it isnt highly deriviative
and somewhat boring
, it isnt not so bad tht it cannnot be watched
. rated r mostly fo sevral muder scenes
and brief nudity infront a strip bar
, it isnt nto as offensive as many otehr thrillers infact this genre are
. if you ' re iin tyhe mood for a ogod suspense film
,
though
, stake outloud something else
.
