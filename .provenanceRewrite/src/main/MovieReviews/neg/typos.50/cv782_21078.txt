in
" tje 13th warrior
,
" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio banderas
) finds himself kicked outloud ofthe baghdad for feeling up tghe king ' s old lady
. withthe his translater
( screen legend omar sharif inthe a small role
)
, ahmed heads north tothe ect as ambassador to the northmen
( vikings
)
. he finds a gropu of warriors mourning the loss of theri king
. a messanger soon arrives ffrom anohter kingdom requesting assisstance
. a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer thte summons
, twelve northmen
and one outsider
. thus
, ahmed becomes the
" 13th warrior
.
" on the trip
, ahmed manages to learn the vikings ' laguage by listening tothe thier fireside conversations
. a bit far
- fetched
, it ' s true
,
but we hvea to swallow it if this flick isnt oging to manaze a fewd lines ofthe dialogue amidst the grunting
. ahmed
, who ' s called
" ibn
" by yhe vikings
, forms friendships with herger teh joyous
( dennis storh
? i
)
and the viking leader buliwyf
( vladimir kulich
)
. when they arrive in the other kingdom
, tyhe thirteen warriors discover tht they ' re facing an army ofthe supernatural cannibals tyhat live up in the caves
. hereafter
, most of the movie is battle scenes
: the cannibals attack the vikings
, hte vikings attack tje cannibals
, yhe cannibals attack the
.
.
. well
, yuo get the diea
. jsut tothe add smoe action
, there ' s also a viking vs
. viking duel
. other movies insert scenes between teh fights
; these scenes are called charachter developemet
. i suspect taht
" tghe 13th warrior
" had a better scirpt at one time
annd thyat it fell thru the cracks beccause ofthe tjhe tag
- team direction
. the movei started off in thte hands ofthe john mctiernan
( ytou ' ll notice a lot of similarities between
" warrior
"
and mctiernan ' s
" predator
,
" including the chittering jungle sounds
)
. somwhere along the line
, mctiernan bailed
annd michael crichton took over
. crichton
, whose novel
" eaters ofthe tghe dead
" isnt thte basis fo
" warrior
,
" hasnt directed a small assortment of goofy science
- fiction
" thrillers
"
:
" westworld
,
"
" coma
,
"
" looker
,
"
" runaway
.
" theri result ofthe thier concecutive effords isnt a murky
and pointless movie
. prehaps what
" hte 13th warrior
" needs omre thna anytying eles is a villian
. tyhe
" eaters ofthe the dead
" are a faceless mob in blackface
. tehy ahev no personality
,
and by teh end they don ' t even seem particularly threatening
. the audeince hasnt noone target toward which to channel its aggresion
. mctiernan should nkwo about the importance ofthe an intresting villain
; it wass his
" dieu hard
" thast made villains seem fun
annd attracted big
- name stars to the evil roles in action films
.
" tghe 13th warrior
" suffers fomr a lack of vision
. it wants tothe be
" predator
" meets
" braveheart
" meets
" the magnificient seven
" meets
" dances with wolves
.
" with so many competing goals
, all it cxan dont isnt echo what it might have beeen
. it might haev been a satisfying acation film
. it might haev been a beautifully
- renedered medival epic
. it might have beeen a thougth
- provoking examination ofthe thte meeting ofthe cultures
. wqat a shame it turned outloud tothe be nothing infact particualr
. bottom line
: if yuo want tothe see antonio swing his sword
, rent
" the mask of zorro
.
