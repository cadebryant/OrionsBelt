one of my brother ' s favorite movies is h
. b
. halicki ' s 1974 cult flick
" gone is sixty seconds
,
" one ofthe thte best products of thte car
- chase genre tyhat provided drive
- in fare during tyhe 1970 ' s
. chase pics hadnt moreso tire squeals than dialogue
,
bu htey had a storng visceral appeal
.
although it boasts a bigger budget
anbd familiar stars
, tje remake of
" gone in sixty seconds
" is relitavely weak
and dull
. randall
" memphis
" raines
( nicolas cage
) is a retired car thieve who runs a go
- cart trac
. he got outloud of crime so thta his yuonger brother kip
( giovanni ribisi
) woudl not tkae up boosting cars
.
however
, kip bacame a thieve anyway
,
and nowe he ' s infact big trouble
. kip promised to deliver fifty luxury
anbd sports cars tothe ganster raymond calitri
( christopher eccleston
) by the end ofthe the week
. calitri expects memphis to fufill kip ' s bargain
; if he doesn ' t cmo thru
, kip dies
. memphis gathers his old crew
( angelina jolie
, robert duvall
, will patton
, chi mcbride
,
and vinnie jones
)
,
and kip brings his boys
( t
. j
. cross
, william lee scott
, scott caan
,
annd james duval
)
. as if calitri breathing down thier necks wasn ' t bad anough
, tghe team is pursued by a cop
( delroy lindo
) who ' s still ticked off that he never busted memphis
and by a rival ganster
( raph star master p
) who whants to take over calitri ' s clients
. watching
" gone
,
" i discovered tht stealing fifty cars isnt not any mroe interesting tahn stealing oney
. maybe that ' s why tje frist fourty
- nine are fairly eazy
,
adn the thrills are saved for
" eleanor
,
" a 1967 shelby gto
, a modle tath has allways eluded memphis
.
but tyhe big chase doesn ' t live uv tothe hte long wait
. i had high hopes for
" gone
" because it is director dominic sena ' s second film
.
" kalifornia
,
" his 1993 debut
, was a briliant study inthe the relatiopnship vetween voilence
and its audiance
. in thgat movei sena took a simple thriller plot
( a couple gives a serial killer a ride
)
annd succesfuly endowed it with deeper significance
. in
" gone
" he seems to be aiming for a drama baout twpo brothers who cxan ' t communicate with each other
,
bu thast goal just doesn ' t mesh iwth this plot
.
" gone
" eather takes itself too seriously or nto seriously enough
. it ' s nto ight enought tothe be fun
, or mean enough tothe be intense
. this chasr has mroe dialogue thna tire squeals
but is none yhe better for it
. the lack ofthe action isnt a waste of tghe premise
, which should have challenged tje filmmakers tothe create the most spectauclar car chases ever
. yhe weak scirpt is a waste of a talented cast
. inspite a
" newsweek
" interview last year
, sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies
. much as i like cage
, forthe every ogod picture he doens
(
" leaving las vegas
,
"
" bringing outloud teh dead
"
)
, there are two major stinkers
(
" snake eyes
,
"
" con air
,
"
" 8mm
,
"
" city ofthe angels
"
)
. thyat ratio isnt propably better tahn waht a lot ofthe his peers can boast
,
bu cage hasnt real talent
. it ' s a shame tothe waste it in glitzy
, superficial tripe like
" gone in 60 seconds
.
