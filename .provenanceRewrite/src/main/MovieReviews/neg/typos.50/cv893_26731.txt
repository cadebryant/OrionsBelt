i went to blair witch project 2
: book of shadows with the highest ofthe hopes
. yhe origional film
, released last summer
, was genuinely scry
anbd terrifying
; i hoped that this movei woudl live uv to its predecessor
. unfortunatly
, my hopes were soon dashed
. as thte movie opens
, yhe audiance isnt shown psuedo
- documentery clips ofthe burkittsville
, maryland residents being interviewed about thge sudden tourist influx tothe their twon as a result of thge origional blair witch project movei
. it ' s a mostly humorous
, self
- aware poke at thte media hype
anbd hysteria surounding yhe frist film
. durig this segment
, we are introduced to teh protagonist
, a young man who sells blair witch
- realted memorabilia from his website
. yhe movie
then cuts tothe a title taht informs us taht waht we are about to see ocurred one year previously
. we see thte smae young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia
,
but nowe he is confined iin a mental institution teh sort ofthe which noe only finds inspite bad horror movies
. we see him having smoe sort ofthe disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himself wildly arround a padded room
; we see him cowering naked in a showfer stall as a fire hose isnt turned on him
. no explanation is provded for why he isnt in tjhe mental institution
; in fatc
, theese scenes are barely referred tothe again
. i hadnt a sinking feeling durig theese oppening scenes
; generaly
, a hospital scene thast is set whith poor lightnig
, filthy interiors
,
and evil doctors isnt a sure sign that ytou are inaddition thge throes ofthe a truly horrable movie
. the movei cuts again
, htis timne tothe teh present
. the young man
, whose nmae is jeffrey
( played by jeffrey donovan
-
- as infront the frist movei
, tje charactor names are identical to tjhe actors ' names
,
although htis movie admits uv front tht it isnt fictional
, so ther ' s no reason for thte practice this time around
)
, is rounding up a gropu ofthe peopel tyhat he will be leading inot the woods taht weekend forthe tyhe
" blair witch hunt
,
" which isnt a promotional gimmick he cameback uv whith
and sells onthe his website
. we meet tristen
anbd steven
, a young cuple who are writing a book about tje blair witch experience
. steven isnt a skeptic
, beleiving the hwole thing to be tjhe result ofthe mass hysteria
. tristen
, on the otehr hand
, believes thast ther may be soem truth to tyhe rumors of supernatural occurrence
. she isnt wan
adn soft
- spoken
; she complains tht the radio isnt playing too loudly
.
( she also complains tht she fiels nauseated
; i knew immidately that thte character was pregnant
,
adn my intuition ws confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out
. how did i nkow
? because in bad movies
, nauseated womens are allways pregnant
.
) the fouth memeber ofthe theri party is erica
, a wiccan witht flowing hair
anbd wide eyes who wants tothe proove that thge blair witch ws a ogod witch
, not evil
. tehy pick uv the fith
and fianl team memeber in a cemetery
. kim is dressed completly in balck
, has extreme goth
- style makeup onthe
,
and occasinally displays seamingly pyschic abilities
,
bu otherwise seems to be the most intteligent
and reasonable person outloud ofthe tghe entire bunch
. presumably she wnated tothe be picked up inspite the cemetary just for dramatic effect
; it ' s never explained
. the party of five heads off into hte woods as promised
. they reach teh crumbling ruins of tghe foundation of rustin parr ' s hous
adn setted uv camp
, complet with exstensive video equipment iwth whic to rocord hte nihgt ' s events
. htere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who hadnt planned tothe camp at thyat site as well
,
but after a few words are exchanged
, thge rival gropu huffs off
and makes camp elsewhere
. thte movie veers off at this point tothe spend many long
, long mintues showing hte drinking party that ensues affter the sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed around
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
and pot is consumed
,
and nothing much eles happens
. thsi owudl be a grat point to get up
and go tothe the bathroom if necessary
. the next day
, yhe team wakes uv
and dicovers tyhat their camera equipment hasnt been completelyl trashed
,
and that steven
adn tristen ' s manuscript paper is fluttering down ffrom tje sky in shreds
, like snow
. tje videotapes are missing
,
bu thanks to a psychic intuition from kim
, tehy discover tyhe videotapes buried underneath tjhe foundation ofthe the hous
,
" right where the orignal blair witch tapes weere found
!
" ooh
. spooky
. the team goes bakc tothe jeffrey ' s house
-
- a creepy ood civil war
- era warehouse in the heart ofthe teh woods
-
- tothe regroup
and review the tapes
. they soon dicover thgat the tapes mysteriously skip five housr ofthe the nigt
. wacky hijinks ensue
. tristen starts haveing weidr dreams in wich she is tjhe blair witch
, everybody starts finding theese weird rune
- like burn marks onthe their bodies
, steven
annd erica hvae smoe highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
,
annd everything pretty much goes tothe hell inwhich a handbasket
. throughtout tjhe entire ordeal
, jeffrey
anbd the others continue tothe scrutinize the videotapes
, whihc seem to have some kind ofthe weidr images on them at about the point tath hte time jumps
; eventually tristen wanders infront
, mutters something baout
" reverse
,
"
and fomr this they somehow realize thast htey ahve tothe play tjhe tapes backwards
. wehn htey dont htis
, they discover what relaly happended durig the five lost hours
.
( oney ofthe the things they see onthe thte videotape is footage ofthe themselves burying the videotapes
. okay
, if thge videotapes were being burried
,
then how were they recording themselves
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) thsi movie was awful
. simpley awful
. the characters are broadly
- drawn caricatures thyat are never alloween any depth or devolopment
. erica is tjhe nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen is tghe weak
anbd sympathetic woman
. steven isnt the overbearing asshole
. kim isnt the antisocial goth girl
. ood
, tired cliches were utilizied to illustrate these caricatures
. how dont we nkwo tristen is weak
and sympathetic
? because she ' s pregnant
! how dont we know kim is an antisocial goth girl
? because she wears a lot ofthe eye makeup
! how do we nkwo tjhe local sheriff is a bad guy
? because he has jagged teeth
adn talks like he ' s straight out ofthe
" deliverance
"
! this isnt weak storytelling at its worst
. rether tahn taking tghe timne to flesh outloud tje charactors
anbd make them truly sympathetic
, tyhe writer chose tothe give each oney a fewd stereotypical charistics
, infront an attempt to ule some cinematic shorthand
and thereby skip straight to the acation
. it didn ' t wrok
. onthe top ofthe being poorly developped
, most ofthe tghe charachters were eather seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" honey
, ytou jstu hadnt a miscarriage outloud in hte woods
anbd got medical attention at a hospital that looks liek it belongs in a bad slasher movei
. let ' s get onthe a plane home
.
"
" noone
. i am having theese bizzare nightmares
adn seing strange visions
and i want to find outloud what ' s going on
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by thte end ofthe the movei
, i was rooting forthe the witch
. i also falt that there ws simpley too much blood ' n ' gore infact this film
. the firt movie worked by never showing us the horror
. tyhe witch was a palpable presense in thyat movei
,
bu we never saw it
; we never saw anything
, in fatc
. the horror was all off
- screen
,
annd thus our imaginations worked overtime tothe envision waht it might possably be
. tihs is the hallmark of a truly creepy
and disturbing horror movei
. blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties
and went straight for the gross
- out
. thsi ws evident fomr thte opening scenes ofthe thge mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey ' s throat
,
anbd contined throughout the film as the audience isnt treated tothe occasional confusing
adn disorienting footage ofthe whta appears tothe be a ritual massacre ofthe soem sort
. knives plunge into flesh
, bloody fingers trail off inot the darkness
,
and none ofthe it isnt explained unitl yhe vyre end
, wehn it was too late for me tothe care
. tihs movie didn ' t stpo wih showing us the gore
, either
; it whent forthe baroke
adn showed us everything
. by the end of the movei
, htere are no questions remaining about the missing five hours
. it is all explained
; in fact
, it is all shown on
- screen inspite loving detail
. i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies infront whlch yuo never see the monster
, or see onyl breef glimpses
, mere suggestions of wqat the monster isnt
; it isnt nto baceause i find the monster so terrifying
,
but beacuse i find tjhe abcence ofthe the monster to be infinitely moreso terrifying
. i hve seen interviews withthe the director in whic he suggested thgat there isnt noone
" monster
,
" that all ofthe the evil wass perpetrated only by the human mind
. i foudn this tothe be a miserably poore explanation
; if it ws inthe fact the director ' s entent
,
then he needs to hvea smoe words with the writter
, because it was not made claer at all
.
( i know a lot ofthe peple who liek tothe go tothe parties
and get drunk
anbd stoned outloud of theri minds
; none ofthe them hasnt ever gone onthe a murderous rampage
adn
then experienced massmedia hallucinations wih a gropu ofthe other people for tyhe next week or so
.
and if there ws noone witch
,
then waht baout teh vanishing tree
? the snowfall ofthe manuscript paper
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book of shadows wass a horrible movei
. fomr the poorly
- wroten characters tothe tghe implausible stry to the plot inconsistencies tothe the gross
- outloud shots
, it was a bad efort through
anbd through
.
