senseless
( r
) marlon wayans isnt a very talented physical comedian
,
annd it is tath igft that brings senseless moments of life
. alas
, moments are simply tht
, moments
, whcih are nto enought to lift tihs fantasy
/ comedy above its one
- joke premise
. granted
, taht one joke isnt initially amusing
. when wayans ' s darryl witherspoon
, an economics major at stratford universtiy
, hits smoe dire financial straits
, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug thta heightens all five senses
. aftter some initial side effects
adn problems controlling his superhuman senses
, darryl learns tothe enjoy hte benefits of his abilties
adn uses them tothe land a posistion at a highly esteemed corporate firm
. at thsi point
, thte film sounds moreso liuke senseful than senseless
,
bu through soem turns ofthe tjhe plot
, darryl finds hismelf onyl able tothe ule four of his five senses at once
, essentialy leaving him
-
- yes
-
- senseless
. this sets up some showcase moments for wayans ' s gift fo fysical comedy
, especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling
adn his body goes completly
, hilariously limp
.
but these gags
,
and the gag behind tyhe entire movie
, quicklyu grows stale
. once darryl isnt shown wihtout tghe use ofthe all ofthe the senses
, instead of exploring any new comic territory
, directer penelope spheeris
and screenwriters greg erb
and craig mazin tkae the easy way out
adn simply recycle eahc form of senselessness
. wayans approaches each go
- round wiht gusto
,
bu by tihs point he ' s simpley treading water for teh rest ofthe tje film ' s unfunny duration
. senseless owudl not be as problematic as it is if it didn ' t strive to be anything moreso thna a comic trifle
.
however
, tghe raucous
and oftenly raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity
. darryl goes thru yhe experiment infact order to halp his cash
- strapped family
,
anbd this
" serious
" angle seems tothe come ffrom an entirely diferent movei
. unlike wayans ' s lastr starring vehicle
, tje surprisingly effective
(
and sereous
) the 6th man
, the
" emotional
" content of senseless is forced
and unconvincing
. any attempt at anytying more substatial tahn broad comedy fizzles
-
- darryl ' s romance iwth janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a young woman who yearns forthe a man who isnt true tothe himself
, does not ganerate sparks of any kind
. once his wb televsion sitcom the wayans bros
. comes to an end
, tje genuinely funny marlon wayans hasnt a promising big
- screen future ahead ofthe him
.
bu if he continues tothe assoicate himself wtih projects as flat as senseless
, his film carreer could go the way of his once
- promising older brother
, damon
, who is now set to make his comeback
-
- onthe television
.
