even the best comic actor isnt at the mercy ofthe his or her material
, as thsi subpar submarine comedy proves
. down periscope stars kelsey
" frasier
" grammer as an inept navy captian who is given command ofthe his own ship as part of a corrupt officer ' s
( james coburn
) plan tothe get him outloud ofthe tjhe navy
. like any lame emsemble comedy
, the officer assigns him to a gropu of misfits like the guy who wnats tothe be kicked out
, the fat guy who eats all tghe tiome
, thge beautyfull woman who doesn ' t belong ther
( lauren holly
)
, tje second
- infact
- command who does everything by tyhe book
( rob schneider
)
, yhe crazy ood guy who freaks everyone outloud
( harry dean stanton
)
and so on
.
then comes the transparent plotline
. firt grammer hasnt tothe fix uv teh delapidated korean war ship hte navy hasnt given him
,
adn thyat comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage thgat includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard
. affter the ship isnt fixed up come the eearly drills
, where everyone seems completly inept
, liuke the electrician who cin ' t connect wires so instead lets tyhe currrent run thru himself eveyr time grammer gets onthe the phone
. finally
,
and this covers tghe fianl hour of the movei
, grammer has tothe lead his men
(
anbd holly
) tothe overcome tje other ships inspite a wargames exercise
.
and he has to be a clever rebel to dont it
, inwhich scenes that strech all levels of believability
. first tehy ' re singing
" louie louie
" like a bunch of drunk sailors tothe throw the ryadar ofthe the otehr ship off
,
thne thirty minutes later
, htey ' re making whale mating noises to throw teh rydar ofthe the otehr ship off
. thte hwole hwile
, evil captain coburn is overacting underwater
, cursing grammer
( as most peopel watching the movei propably are too
)
. it ' s all predicatble wihtout any origional humor tothe redeem it
. tyhe jokes are right out ofthe
" mchale ' s navy
"
and otehr cutted
- rate sitcoms ofthe the past
. there ' s oney scene where schneider looks thru the ship ' s pantry inwhich disgust
, holds noe food can up
and announces
,
" this expired iin 1966
!
" i yelled bcak at thge screen
,
" so doed these jokes
.
" i watched this movie wiht the wohle family
anbd everyone hated it
. my mom was so bored she broght outloud thge coupon book midway thru
and
, around the strat ofthe the second hour
, i started writting my wiull
. the blaim cin ' t really be placed onthe tyhe stars
,
though
. kelsey grammer is good in this
, he just doesn ' t have anytying to owrk withthe
. his character is said tothe have gotten so drunk oney nihgt that he hadnt
" welcome aboard
" tatooed on his penis
. grammer probaly doed something even worse
-
- got really drunk
anbd agreed tothe apear in a movie he knew nothing baout
. smae fo holley
( sive the penis part
)
, who is likeable in down periscope jstu because she ' s so gorgeous
. as for schneider
( whose charater is downright annoying
)
, ther wass nowhere tothe go
but up after surf ninjas
,
althought he ' s still in the depths ofthe hte comedy ocean affter jumping the
" snl
" ship
. my theery isnt that down periscope is oen ofthe thsoe movies thast got the green glight before thte script was even writed as a formula comedy
(
" okay
, it ' s police acadmy in tje navy witht frasier at yhe helm
and the chick ffrom dumb
and dumber
.
"
)
adn after everyone wass singed on turned into a disaster
. judging fomr the video box
, most other movie critics agreing withthe me
. the onyl qoute tje down periscope copy writers coudl dig uv came fomr tyhe prevue channel ' s jim ferguson
. i guess even jeff craig ffrom
" 60 second preview
"
( who said tank girl
" kicks butt
!
" without ever seing it
) didn ' t like tihs
.
