a movei like mortal kombat
: annihilation works
(
adn must be reviewed onthe
) multiple levels
. firt
, there ' s the rampant useage ofthe randian subtext that pervades yhe entire movei
.
bu occasionaly
, almsot as if making an ironic
, self
- depreciating remark
, hte movie tosses in claerly marxist imagery
. no no
.
.
. jsut kidding
. had yuo going there for a moment
, didn ' t i
? in all seriousness
howver
,
and to be fair tothe hte movie
, it
* isnt
* neccesary to provide twpo viewpoints
: tht of a movei watcher unfamiliar
( or only marginally familliar
) with the wohle mortal kombat phenomenom
,
and that ofthe a fan of hte first movie
and
/ or a fan of tjhe games
. tghe frist movie
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) concerned itself witht a martial arts tornament that would decide the fate of earth
(
and it ' s 5 billion inhabitants
)
. teh mortals won
,
and inaddition theery tihs shouldnt have prevented tjhe emperor shao khan ffrom taking over teh earth
. unfortunately
, shao khan wass a poore losr
,
and thge vyer final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready to take over the planet
, as our herose assumed a fighting stance
. tjhe first movie was extraordinarily intertaining for those
( like mysef
) who are fans of the gam
. i ' d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn ' t know about tyhe game probablly enjoied hte movie
. yhe writers
adn directors knew the limitations of both their casted
adn of the basic story itself
,
annd they didn ' t try to overachieve
. there weere a lot ofthe really kool fight scenes
( with really cool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed with soem distracting
(
bu ultimatly non
- intrusive
) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot
.
anbd
, as we nkow
, tghe movie ws a smashing succes at the box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks uv precisely where tath movei left off
, with some introductory exposition tothe clue iin thsoe who may nto have seen yhe firt movie
. shao khan has desided that he ' s going tothe tkae over tje earth
* anyways
*
,
anbd tothe hell with soem silly rule about mortals winning the tournament
. therafter follows approximatly 85 mintues ofthe film tyhat alternates betwen bieng confuzled
, being trite
, being silly
,
and bieng just plain stupid
. oney gets the general impression thyat thte producers ofthe hte movei thought
" hey
, taht lsat movie ws such a success that we can git moreso mney
anbd mkae a
* rela
* movei nowe
.
" too bad they didn ' t simply stick iwth the formula from tje frist movei
. i coudl rwite volumes baout the thnigs that are wrong withthe htis picture
,
bu here are the high points
:
* yhe acting isnt truly bad
. sandra hess
( playing the sonya blade charcter
) is paticularly execrable
, expecially inaddition scenes where she trys tothe convince us that she loved johnny cage
( a charcter from teh first movie who gets greased at the beginning ofthe this movie
)
.
* in noe of the worst pieces ofthe mis
- casting i tihkn i ' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, tyhe god of thunder
. in teh first movie
, christopher lambert plyed raiden
and plyed his charachter as
though he was inaddition on the joke
: a french actor palying a japnes thunder god bieng revered by chineese mystics
. i generaly like it when actors are cast against tipe
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. being cast as the persident ofthe the u
. s
. infront the fith element
, fo exmaple
)
,
adn remar has alwyas beeen one ofthe my favorite
" utility
" actors
but he ' s so totally wrong for tihs part tht he doesn ' t even hve the luxury of ammused self
- awareness
.
* there are too many cahracters that are inctroduced as bieng potentially important
,
but
thn never seen agina
.
* there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks
, including a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks outloud nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, hasnt a mystical hallucination
,
and
hten wanders off with jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. forthe theese reasons
(
anbd many others
)
, i cant only give hte movei a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless you ' re a huge fan of tyhe ganes
and
/ or thge frist movie
. in that case
, hte folowing critiques allso apply
:
* sandra hess
, hwile bieng an even worse actress than bridgette wilson
( who plyed sonya blade in yhe firt movie
)
, is much moreso convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught tothe her by the fight choreographer
. hess looks liuke she actally knows some martial arts
,
annd puts toghether a much more believable fight scene
.
* iin tje fights
, eahc of tghe characters does at least
* one
* thing tehy do inwhich hte game
(
adn oftenly more
)
. sonya doesnt her
" kiss ofthe death
,
" jax doens his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang does his
" animality
,
"
and so onthe
. a big bonus for thsoe of us who weere looking for similar moves in yhe first movei
and found them only rarley
.
* htere aren ' t as many fight scenes in this movie as htere weere infront hte firt
, becasue the folks makeing the movie mistakenly try tothe hang a more robust plot infact between
. silly
, silly folks
.
and tje lamest fight involved two of teh women inthe waht turns inot a mud
- wrestling match
. lame
adn so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorect
, for the most part
) noticed
adn remarked apon it
.
* the spacial effects are generaly better
, except for thge fianl fight scene beetwen hte emporer
and liu kang in whic both perform their
" animalities
.
" motaro
adn sheeva are both more convincing
and lifelike thna goro wass in the first movei
. fo folks like mysef who loved tje first movei
and enjoy tyhe games
, i give thsi a 5
. you ' ll propably liuke it
,
bu not nearly as much as yuo liked thge frist one
.
