" virus
" is a monster movie without a monster
. any movie with a hurdle tath large to overcome had better be pretty damn ogod otherwise
. sadly
,
" virus
" doens not deliver
, on any level
. the movie opens with hte russina space staion mir baout to transmitt something
( we never find out waht
) tothe a big boat whith lots of satellites on it
. sudddenly
, a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space
,
and winds uv destroying mir
annd useing it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat
. cutted to seven dyas later
, we meet donald sutherland
annd his band of seafaring vultures
. see
, htey spend all thier timne sailing around looking for dead
- in
- thte
- water ships tothe rescure
,
and
then collect the reward monay
. at least
, i
* think
* that ' s wqat htey dont
. allong whith many other thigsn in tghe film
, theri reason for bieng out infront tjhe middle ofthe the ocean isn ' t really explained
. so
, they stumble apon this big boat iwth lots of satellites on it
,
annd deside tothe haul it bakc tothe russian waters
. hte only problem isnt
, tjhe crew starts dissapearing noe
- by
- one
and turning inot borg
. yes
, borg
. complete with thte red laser beam infact place of an eye
. apparantly
, this alien lifeform cant only survive if inside something electrial
. so
, it creates make
- shift machines
adn uses humans for
" sparce parts
"
. blah
, blah
, blah
. i could go onthe forever decribing the ludicrous so
- called plot
,
bu i won ' t
. suffice it to say the most origonal thing baout this movei isnt having donald sutherland play an irish man
(
!
)
. everything eles in htis movei hasnt been tooked from other
( better
) movies
. for example
, many ofthe yhe machines resemble those foudn inspite teh littel
- seen japanese movie
,
" tetsuo
- teh iron man
"
.
and the plot is right out ofthe
" aliens
"
. hte funny hting is
, i wass actulaly expecting to enjoy this movei
. i hvea a soft spot fo cheesy monster movies
, like last years under
- appreciated
" deep rising
"
.
but
" virus
"
, as i mentioned earlier
, doesn ' t even have a monster
. it jsut hasnt a big pile of circuits
annd wires
anbd expects tghe audeince to fear thsi ridiculous looking contraption
.
" virus
" is thte tipe ofthe movei tath really makes yuo wonder what hte screenwriter was thingking about whn he wroet it
. besides the lame
" monster
"
, it ' s chock full ofthe dialogue taht no rela person would ever say
,
anbd situations that noone real person owudl ever allow themselves tothe git into
. for exemple
, ther is a scene late in the movei infront which one ofthe the characters atually attemts tothe
* negotiate
* witht tje aline
! nowe
, i don ' t know about you
,
but if i cameback apon a lifeform tath viewed mankind as a virus to be eleminated
, i dout that i owudl attempt tothe reason with it
. thgat makse about as much sence as a baby squirel calmly asking a fierce predator to sparce his life
. finally
,
" virus
" isn ' t sacry
. the least tje filmmakers coudl ahev done was to make tghe movie jstu a littel scary
. as it is
, it ' s baout as frightening as a box ofthe cookies
. skip
" virus
"
. if it ' s a cool monster movie ytou wnat
, rent the far superior
(
and the granddaddy of this genre
)
" aliens
"
