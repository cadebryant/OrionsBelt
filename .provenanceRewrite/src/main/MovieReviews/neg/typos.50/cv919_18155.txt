inspite teh mid
- 1980s
, following hte splendid debut in hugh hudson ' s greystoke
and realtive succes of first highlander film
, it looked liuke christopher lambert ' s acting carrer might go somewhere
.
but
, it wasn ' t meaned to be
, which became obvious folowing highlander ii
. infact this decade christopher lambert became associated with films wiht low budgets
and even lower qulaity
. very often such films were sciecne fiction
, which meaned tht the fans ofthe tath genre learned the hard way what tothe evade anything starring christopher lambert
. whether it was becasue ofthe rela lack ofthe talent
, terrable miscasting or simple bad luck isn ' t important
- the end result was almost alwyas horrable
. tghe same cxan be said forthe fortress
, 1993 csience fiction film directed by stuart gordon
, director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests liuke reanimator
annd from beyond
. the movie is set inspite 2018
. fo some undisclosed reason
, usa introduced strict population control
and couples are barred from hvaing moreso than noe child
. jake
( christopher lambert
)
and karen brennick
( lori laughlin
) baroke that law
adn are caught by authorities on yhe border
. sentenced tothe 31 eyasr in prison
, they are both thrown inot fortress
, privately owned correctional facility
, equiped with state
- ofthe
- the
- art futuristic technology
and run by computer called zed
. altho equiped whith gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates ' lives
annd make any escape impossible
, prison authoritiers often ule violentce
. jake survives many ordeals
and earns respect ofthe some inmates which woudl help him when he beigns planing yhe escape
. such escape should become necessity
, becouse the warden poe
( kurtwood smith
) beigns showing unhealthy intrest infront karen
. after rather intriguing beginning
annd smoe intresting special effects that despict the futuristic settings of prision
, this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity
. hte reason is in yhe screenplay thgat quicklyu degenerates into wohle sories of prision movie clich
? s
annd situations taht are painfully predicatble
. by thte tiem brennick begins his excape from fortress
, thsoe situations nto only begin to look predicatble
,
but utterly implausible too
. ofthe course
, film never tryed to explane why the ocuntry that lacks resources to support its presnt population happens tothe spend bucketloads of mone onthe ultra
- expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless
anbd dangerous munbers ofthe tjhe society
. the initialy interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters
, played by nto too interseted or talented actors
. lori laughlin
,
altough physically attractive
, shows the acting ability ofthe sequoia
. kurtwood smith as prision warden isnt rather uninspired
, capible ofthe solid
,
yet forgettable performance
. lambert ' s peformance is allso ogod
,
but even thte bigger talent couldn ' t halp this film
, detined tothe end infact oblivion
.
