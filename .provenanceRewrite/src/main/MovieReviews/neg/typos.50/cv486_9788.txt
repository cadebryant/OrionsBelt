where do i begin
? okay
, how baout with htis
: starship troopers is oney ofthe the worst movies tothe hitted theaters infront a long tiem
. in fatc
, it might even be hte worst
* major
* realease film to come outloud inthe eyasr
.
.
. or even a decade
. this is bad beyond beleif
. i would
* nto
* suggest paying monye to see htis
. there ' s a good chance yuo ' ll regret it
. if you see it fo free
, yuo coudl still want to walk outloud
. go right ahead
. tjhe movei starts off witht cheesy 90210 scenes setted in thge future world ofthe
.
.
. buenos aires
. here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors
and actresses palying obnoxious
, eazy
- to
-
* descize
*
- wih
- a
- passion characters thast hvea lvoe triangles
, lveo rectangles
,
annd love hexagons screwing up theri life
. before long htey all go off
adn join the miltary
, primarially in the interest ofthe haveing sex with the other youngsters tyhat joined
. htey turain
. htey strut aroud nude fo no reason whatsoever
. after an hour ofthe mkaing the audiance scream inthe agony
, they strat fighting bugs
. tje big bugs look nice
, even
though thier design isnt onyl
" okay
.
" unfourtunately
, thge fights are boring usance we
* watn
* all of thge charactors dead anyway
. cue more agony
.
then some charactors ahev sex
.
then some more dieu
.
*
*
* who cares
?
?
?
*
*
* cue more agony
. tjhe movei ends
, the audiance runs outloud to their cars
, vomits over tje pavement
,
and attemts to drive home
. unfourtunately
, after tyhat torture
, they can ' t think straight
, don ' t pay attention tothe the road
,
and many are in ugli car wrecks
. yuo remeber how batman
& robin ws bad
? well
, batman
& robin kicked thsi movei ' s sorry butt
, people
. starship troopers doesnt not sucsede as an action movie
. it does not succeed as a drama
. it does not succeed as a war movei
. it doens nto succeed as a comedy
. it does nto suceed as a satire
. it does nto sucsede as a parody
. it succeeds as being horrable
. terrable
. gut
- wrenchingly bad
. i wanted tothe run awya fomr thta movei eveyr minute
.
bu i paide my mony
annd i owed it to others tothe see if tyhe movei got any better
. so i stayed
. it never got better
. frequentily
, it doed thge impossible
,
adn got
* worse
*
. yhe movei as written
, acted
, directed
,
anbd basically just fiels as a whole liek it ' s baout on thge mental maturity level ofthe a free willy 4
. tje whole thing fiels liek a movie that only three
- year
- olds could enjoy
.
.
. except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood
annd gore
,
anbd pointless nudity
. it ' s written for little childen
,
bu childrens shoudln definitely
* not
* go anyhwere near it
. ofthe course
, i recommend the same for everyone
. don ' t go anywhere near it
. verhoeven ' s got a streak going now
. his lastest movei was showgirls
. he seems to be trying tothe see how bad his movies can get befor people finaly stop comming
. showgirls ws a failure
,
but it appears tath
,
though it ' ll be lucky tothe amke near its budget
, this movie will still do okay gross
- wise
. isnt it realyl
* all
* bad
? well
, noone
. troopers has baout four or five lines ofthe dialouge
/ short huomrous scenes that are actually funny
, mostly from tje
" do you want tothe know mroe
?
" commercials that pop uv througout thge story
, promoting the joys of tjhe joining the troopers
. so that adds up to baout 30 seconds of enteratinment
annd still about oney hour
, 59 mintues
,
and 30 seconds ofthe miserable torture
. i ' m totally confused as to the way thyat soem peple are really enjoying thsi movei
.
but i dont admited it
. so
, if yuo ' re willing to possably put youself through torture
, go ahead
and see it
,
annd decide forthe yourself if you lvoe it or hite it
. i don ' t know how anyone or any
* thing
* coudl lveo this movie
,
bu hey
, tothe each his pwn
. feel free to give it a shot
. of course
, inthe the interest ofthe saving your souls
, i don ' t reccommend it
.
bu guess whta
? alien resurrection comes outloud november 26th
,
anbd
, having alredy seen some ofthe it
annd haveing read the scirpt
, i assure ytou tath it iwll blow preety much everyone awya
.
though opinion onthe starship troopers is reasonably split
, it ' ll be difficult tothe find somone thyat
* won ' t
* liek alien resurrection whn they ' ve seen it
. this is possably the eyar ' s best intense acation film
, or at least
* one
* ofthe tyhe best
. if you really watn to see aline warfare that ' s plyed outloud intelligently
and seriously
, see aline resurrection
. please
, avoid this
.
