whn it comes tothe the average teenage romantic comedy
, i expect negitive reviews from criticists left
annd right
. predicatble
, unoriginal
,
adn forgettable will most likely be the threee adjectives to haunt the down to yuo ' s
anbd the drive me crazy ' s released by thge dozens theese last cuple of eyars
. what i realy look for inwhich this kind ofthe movei isnt the enteratinment value while i ' m sitting in tyhe theather
. am i enjoying myself
? is htis a comfortable break ffrom my week ofthe finals
? this isnt why i ahve given films liuke final destination or road trip high markes
; i had a party of a tiome wasting my monye onthe something i won ' t remember enxt week
. so last week i opened up the newyorker york times
-
and
, noone suprise
, boys
adn girls got a negative review
. daily news
? negative
. reelviews
? negative
. epinions
. com
? negative
. thsi was nothing new
. american py
, fianl destination
, road trip didn ' t get such hot reviews
and i loved those guilty pleasures
. smae goes fo she ' s all thyat
, a formulaic
but enjoyable pygmalion adaption tht got unjustly pounded
. usance boys
and girls reunites she ' s all that directer robert iscove
adn actor freddie prinze jr
.
, i predicted d
? j
? vu al over agina
.
but
, still curious
, i asked arround my skool
and from the oen or twpo people who hadnt seen it
, tjhe reactions weere far ffrom postive
. i hadnt made up my mind
; i ' ll catch it on video or cable in a cuple ofthe eyasr
.
bu
, soon aftter
, folowing a serieses of unexpected events
( we couldn ' t get inot shaft because it is rated r
)
, i found mysef watching boys
and girls
. whoops
. boys
and girls is baout a
" nerdy
, smart
" boy named ryan
( prinze jr
.
)
adn a
" popular
, flirt
" girl named jennifer
( claire forlani
)
. breifly meeting as pre
- teens
adn nowe attending the smae college
, tyhe twpo bump inot earch otehr so many times taht evenhtually tehy become best firends
.
but in teh movies
, a male
anbd a female cannot be friends wihtout having that nagging feeling of attraction forthe eahc otehr
. iwth advice from thier roommates
( amanda detmer
, jason biggs
)
, ryan
adn jennifer attempt tothe discover the true meaninng of theri relatiopnship
. the film definatly lives up to the dreaded threee adjectives
-
anbd mindless enteratinment isnt nowhere to be found
. i could hardly sit through the 93 minute runnung time fo severeal reasons
. yhe dialogue is probably tjhe worst i have ever seen in any movei
, mainly because the whole movei depends onthe the boring scirpt
and tghe rediculous words these characters ule isnt wqat hollywood thikns kids can relate tothe
. it isnt almost offensive
. an exemple of an insightful conversation
:
" you ' re dumb
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb
, dumb
.
"
" no
.
"
( folowed by a mandy moore
- esque tune background
)
( well it ' s not as bad as wing comander i guess
) the supporting cast is alsot painfully useless
. detmer
and biggs stand in the way for anything intresting tothe ahppen with their pwn boring
, pointless subplots
.
annd
althought tihs is supposted tothe be from both perspectives of thte human sex
, prinze jr ' s ryan dominates hte screen while forlani ' s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma forthe him to owrk with
. we never learn anytying about jennifer which isnt a shame too beacuse forlani is tyhe onyl acotr tothe bring any life into her character
. teenager or nto
: ytou ' ll hite htis movei
, i guarntee it
. mabey i shoud rent she ' s all thyat again
. is it really as good as i think it isnt
?
