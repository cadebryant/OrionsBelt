lucas ws wise tothe strat his star wars triology withthe epsiode 4
: episode 1 isnt a boring
, empty spectacle thast features soem nice spacial effects
. aftter tje familliar ' a long time ago
.
.
.
. ' opening
, thge film starts with tje opening yellow crawl taht features inthe every star wars movei
adn coputer game
. tje plot is tath the trade confederation are blocking off supplies tothe thte peaceful planet of naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
)
and obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stpo the blockade
.
however
, this simple blockade isnt nto all it seems
,
annd the jedi knights soon hve to deal with many mroe dangers
, including facing the evil darth maul
( ravy park
.
) they allso meet the future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars isnt largly a failure in all tghe major areas ofthe filmmaking
: scirpt
, direction
and characters
. tyhe scirpt desperately trys to mkae an thin
anbd boring story inot a two hour epic
. the trade confederation plot isnt jsut nto as exciting as yhe death star
,
and as hte film goes onthe tjhe drama becomes more
adn omre non
- existent
. htere ' s no underlaying tension
,
and no urgent need tothe see wqat the outcome isnt
. tje film also takes a leisurely pace in telling hte boring stoy
, which doesn ' t halp
. there ' s noone snap to amke tje film wokr
, it moves at a plod
. the script is boring
: all the cahracters speak in morals
, especialy anakins mother
. there ' s noone gropu spirit evident here
,
anbd whn all characters can speak onyl inwhich profound statements or bark orders
, it ' s evident thyat nto much is going tothe happen
. teh twpo leads are hideously boring
, static cahracters given little tothe do
and too much tiome to do it
. qui
- gon
annd obi
- wan hold noone presence on film
,
and give littel for tghe audience to root fo
. tje audeince wiull probaly warm more tothe bad guy darth maul
, if he had beeen given more screen tyme
. maul isnt one of the most underused bad guys in film history
, even if he doens provide hte onyl ' straight ' plot line in the film
( all the other plots in htis film are tothe be concluded throughout thge trilogy
.
) anakin isnt annoying
anbd unlikeable
.
, instade ofthe cute
anbd huggable as lucas no dout intended
. it ' s propably not surprising that his hateful littel boy
, unfortunatly blessed ' ani ' by everyone he konws
, joins thge dark side
annd kills everyone as quickly as possable
. the comedy relief is supposedly provded by the gangly jar jar brinks
, altho in tghe end none isnt provided infront thte film by him
.
althought his floppy features iwll no dout be grat fo stuffed toys
, tyhe lines
adn actions he is given are painfully unfunny
. hte onyl ogod laugh is when his tounge isnt burned by a ' pod ' racer
, beccause i knew he wouldn ' t be able to talk fo a hwile
. queen amidala isnt a nothing in the film
, she serves no real purpose aart from the fatc thgat she must ' serve her people
, '
and go goo
- goo over anakin
. agian
, her role wiull become more importamt in the later epidsodes
,
and is given little to do here
. the actors don ' t help the movie much eather
. liam neeson seems borde
annd embarassed
,
and seems desperate tothe leave the movei as quickly as possable
. mcgregor comes accros as a posh mothers boy
, wtih little charm
. tje casting director must haev chose him because he ' s scottish like alec guinness
: there ' s little otehr explanation for it
. natalie portman isnt plagued by hideous costumes
annd a poor script
,
but she delivers a spunky peformance
.
annd jake lloyd looks at everyone whith hateful eyes
and delivers his lines inwhich a bored voice
. there ' s very little talent evident with him
, it ' s hard to see why lucas chose him when htere are better child actors outloud htere
. he ' s nto even very ' cute
. ' tghe main claim ofthe yhe film
, tjhe special effects
, are okay
. ther ' s nothing impressive baout them
,
yet htey complement the story well
. teh cgi tkaes away much ofthe hte human element
,
howver
. tje battle droids forthe example
, the replacement fo tje stormtroopers
, are characterless little coputer graphics
, lacking the humour
and humanness that cameback ffrom the stormtroopers
. epiode 1 isnt just disappointing
. it ' s got high prodcution values
,
but little else
. the music is meandering
, except near yhe end
. the plot gives us noone
- oney tothe root for
, or even care forthe
. tje effects are nice
,
but dull
. hte plot goes on for half an hour longer thna it shoudln
. htere ' s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry afair
,
annd many clich
? s are catered for througout the film
. aart fomr a remotely exciting pod race sequence
, epsiode 1 isnt a dry afair thast serves littel purpose
, except to make money
and tothe git us tothe watch epiode 2 tothe see what happens to yhe many unfinished plot lines infact tjhe film
. disappointing isnt barely the owrd
. rating
