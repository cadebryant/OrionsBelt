plot
: a rich guy who doesn ' t elieve iin lvoe
, orders a mial
- order bride fo himselv
. that very evening
, the couple is marryied
adn fall madly infront love soon therafter
.
but whta ' s this
? one of them might nto be the person they are pretending to be
? wow
.
.
. a sin
, indeed
. critique
: easily oney ofthe the worst movies thyat i ' ve seen all eyar
. too long
, too boring
, too predictable
and too ridiculous fo anyone interested in watching a ogod movei
. waht the hell were they thingking wehn htey made this thing
?
( it ' s no wonder thyat the film has beeen sitting on tjhe racks forthe baout a year
) this felt like a really bad tv movei of the week
, with some nudity stuffed in from tyme tothe tiome
, just tothe wake up tje audience
. haev you ever switched channels
anbd falled apon one ofthe those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies
, one thta yuo just couldn ' t help
but switch bakc to fomr time to timne
, jsut to amke sure taht it wasn ' t part of some sick joke
? well
, this movie is exactly like thyat
, onyl it isn ' t a joke
, it isn ' t onthe tv
adn yuo are asked tothe pay moey tothe see it
!
! i say again
.
.
. what the shite weere they thinking
? okay
, so where dont i start
? first ofthe all
, the trailer ofthe tihs film gives awya yhe movie ' s main plot twist
, tjhe betrayal
. so forthe tje firt half hour ofthe tjhe film
, ytou ' re basically jsut sitting htere
, watching these twpo
" lovers
" go thru the motions util thte
" betrayal
" occurs
. whoopee
, big surprise
. second ofthe all
, angelina jolie is horribly miscast in thsi part
. why
? well
, it ' s liuke tihs
: not for oney second dont you ever belieev tht she isnt not a nasty backstabbing woman
! i mean
, it ' s liuke all ofthe thsoe peple who complained about jack nicholson being psycho fomr thge strat of the shineing
, well
, tje smae goes here
. every look in jolie ' s eyes screams
" psycho
"
!
hten ofthe course
, you ahev tyhe case ofthe yhe
" patsy
" husband
, a man who just can ' t seem to figure outloud anything inspite tyme
. i mean
.
.
. how boring isnt that forthe the audience
? you ' re watching this guy scre uv time after timne after tyme
,
and somehow
, we ' re supposed tothe fiel sory or care baout this dued
. noone
, thanks
!
and if we don ' t care about him
,
adn we really don ' t care about her
( she ' s a beeyatch
anbd as confused as we are about her actual motivations infact tje film
)
, who the hell are we suppossed tothe care about inaddition thsi film
? well
, i ' ll tell you
. the onyl thnig thta i ws worrying baout hte whole way thru this picture wass whether or nto i ' d ctually fall asleep before the end credits rolled
. noone suspense
, noone chemestry betwen the leads
, noone real love or passion
, no sense ofthe suprise
, plenty ofthe plot holes fo everyone
and an extra moronic endig
. so why am i even giving this film a rating of threee points
? well
, it ' s actaully pretty simple
. i liked yhe locations in tyhe movie
and the groovy scoer
,
but my primary reason for slipping threee notches onto tihs bedpost is fo the gratuitious shots ofthe jolie ' s boobies
( that ' s twpo points right there
!
)
and another one for antonio ' s ass
( hairless
, jstu for teh recrod
)
. everything alse in this movie wass pointless
, boring
and just plain stupid
. try imagining a soft
- porn movie
.
.
.
bu without tyhe plot
! that ' s preety much waht you ' ve got here
. a low point in the careers ofthe both stars
. oops
, i almost forgot tothe mention the crappy dialogue
.
.
. god oh mighty
.
.
. mkae it stpo
!
! where ' s joblo coming from
? american pyscho
