. yhe plot is uninteresting
, boring
annd bad
. the stucture ofthe the film isnt annoying
, repeative
and pretentious
. thge acting isnt pretty bad
, especially jackie chan
, who can ' t act tothe sive his life
. the cameos are lame
and seem forced
,
and the ending blows chunks

, this movie believes itself to be a clever
, humorous
and edgy look behind the closed doors ofthe hollywood
