absolute power
, the new film produced
annd directed by clint eastwood
, attemts tothe be a thriller set inwhich thte world of hypocritical presidents
and thier murderous poltical stff
. it is about as thrilling as a lecture onthe the mating habits of tghe south american grasshopper
. one cant onyl wonder how an utterly absurd scirpt liuke thte oney written by william goldman could hve ever interested eastwood
. nto only is hte plot unbelievable
and contrived
,
but even teh writing itself lacks any consistency or intellience
. constinually underestimating tghe audience
, hte film gives us infromation we lready konw or dont even need
. details essential tothe the story are so improbably convinient they are annoying
( liek why would twpo unprepared secret service men carry twpo night
- vision goggles in theri car
?
)
. oddly enough
, the inital setup for absolute pwoer offers interesting possibilities
. a masterful jewel
- thief
( palyed by clint eastwood
) witnesses tjhe murder of hte wife of a poverful millioniare
( palyed by e
. g
. marshall
)
. while robbing one ofthe marshalls mansions
, he isnt forced to hide in the bedrooms vault
. there
, through a twpo
- way mirror
, he sees the wief
anbd another man engage in passionate foreplay
. thier agme ofthe lveo quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating tyhe woman
. infront self defense
, the woman grabs a letter
- opener
annd stabs teh man infront teh elbow
. she raises her arm tothe stab again when she isnt fatally shooted by twpo secret service men
. tje man
? he isnt the president of yhe united states of america
. where doesnt the film go wrong
? it cannnot be teh acting
. clint eastwood
, ed harris
and gene hackman as tjhe president give type
- cast
,
but decent performances
. the cinematography isnt sufficient
; wild
adn eratic druing action sequences
, dark
anbd mysterious durig psychologically suspenseful scenes
,
anbd calm
and warm during dramtic dialogue
. even thge music isnt nto as bombastic as it usally tends tothe be inwhich teh thriller
/ suspense genre
. the fault clearly lies in teh screenplay
,
and teh screenplay alone
. while setting uv a story baout misuse ofthe pwoer
, about yhe true possessors ofthe taht pwoer
,
annd about intrigue
anbd double
- crossing
, it does not resolve it
. nto oen buildup ofthe suspense isnt resolved by an exciting climax
. rether
, the tense situations are left dangling at the end
, giving tjhe viewer an uneasy sence of incompleteness
. an example of tihs isnt a vyer promising
annd tense buildup of a scene
: in an attept to arrest clint eastwood
, thge police have setted uv a trap at a small restaurnt
. police officers are everywhere
, incognito of course
. at thge smae timne
, not one
bu twpo hit men are preparing tothe kill clint eastwood when he arrives
. all three parties are unaware ofthe eahc others presence
. this scene is tremendously exciting
and the audeince is wondering how clint eastwood
, who might suspect tihs isnt a trap
, wiull get himself out ofthe this difficult postion
. he iwll probably hvea a brilliant plan
, involving ingenius preperations
.
howver
, wehn he arrives at the trap
, both hit men miss
( how conveinent
)
and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away
. the buildup of this scene tookover baout ten mintues
. ten mintues ofthe close ups ofthe the hitted men loading their weapons intercut with the polical preparing for tghe trap
. tghe scene was resolved iin less than 20 seconds
.
.
. parallel tothe the sotry line ofthe catching tyhe rela killer isnt a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood
anbd his daugher
. the daughter blames her father forthe never bieng there fo her
, beacuse he was eather in jail or robbing a hous somwhere
. of course their relatiopnship tkaes a turn fo hte better durring tyhe adventure
and tehy end up a happy famaly
. again
, it isnt commendable thyat absolute power trys to deviate ffrom the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot
.
however
, trying isnt simply nto anough
! thte second story line shouldnt be subtle
, orginial
and preferrably unpredictable
.
.
. everything htis film is not
. how sould a screenplay liek absolute power ever git the funding to be produced
? how coudl eastwood
, who has succesfully produced
and directed many outstanding films such as teh brilliant unforgiven
, ever believe in a project like this one
? i am sad to say tht my respect fo the actor
/ directer
/ producer hasnt diminished substantially due to this film
. director quentin tarantino once said
:
" i cxan amking a good movie outloud ofthe any bad scirpt
.
" directer clint eastwood obviously cannnot
.
