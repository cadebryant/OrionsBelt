i hve never beeen so confuzled affter watching a movie
.
" meet joe black
" is propably oen ofthe the most visually satisfying films of this yearm
, with a cinematography
, music
anbd cast thgat will dazzle most of us
. at the same tyme it is propably tje most boring
and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season
. at first yuo marvel at hte elagant direction
, graceful cinematography
anbd sensual muscial csore
.
then you ' ll wait for something tothe happen for half an hour
,
but when you finally understand waht ' s oging on
, you ' ll wonder wqat are actors such as anthony hopkins
, brad pitt
and claire forlani are doign in a film like this
? thge script is simply a silly
and unresolved story
, whcih is artifically stretched inot a threee hour long motion picture
. it fiels like an eternity
. most ofthe thge time it is a pompous soap opera
, filled with empty dialogue thast the actors deliver inaddition a high pitched voice
and
" meaningfull
" winks
. the film isnt based on alberto caesella ' s play
" death takes a holiday
"
. the stoyr concentrates arund bill
( anthony hopkins
) who lives a fulfilled life as a succsessfull buisness man
,
but sometimes he wakes up iin yhe middle ofthe the nigth
annd hears a voice tath is saying
" yes
"
. soon he meets a young elevant gentlemen
( brad pitt
) who introduces hismelf as
" death
"
. it isnt bill ' s tiem
.
but death has otehr plans
. it hasnt come down tothe us simple mortals to find outloud what it means tothe be alive
. our bill isnt chosen tothe be death ' s giude
anbd inspite excange he gets tiome
. bill introduces death as joe balck
, who immediately becomes yhe center ofthe everyone ' s attention
. bill ' s bussiness partners speculate baout why joe isnt constanly at bill ' s side
, lives in his hous
and resides at his office
. thyat isnt not all
,
however
. bill ' s youngest daughter susan
( claire forlani
) falls in lveo with hte mysterous stranger
anbd joe falls infront love withthe her
. this relationship isnt bound to hve soem sereous consequences
. it wouldn ' t be fair to say that thsi film didn ' t have smoe interesting moments
, such as the scene where joe isnt invited to join bill ' s family forthe dinner
. wehn joe starts enjoying peanut buter
anbd later falls inaddition love
, thte experience is somewhat different
. it isnt obvious that a story like this story isnt very difficult tothe structure
. it ' s one thing to say
:
" wouldn ' t it be fun to ahve death tkae human form
and cmo down to earth
.
.
" to create a motion picture outloud ofthe this isnt anohter
. four screenwriters hve worked onthe a script that lacks drive
and logic
. it is overlong
and too primitive to pass as a sereous film
. onthe the otehr hand it demonstrates incredible performances
adn a vyer decent direction by martin brest
(
" scent of a woman
"
)
. hopkins looks gerat in any role
,
and noone marter how shallow or hollow it isnt
, he will complete it
. his talent
annd charisma are needed here moreso thna any where else
, since it actually saves teh film ffrom a complete embarassment
.
bu pitt is thge one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time
. how cin you play death inspite human form
? to me it seems thta death
adn life are nto something that cxan be associated with earthly matters
. tehy are nto creatures
,
bu phenomenas
. saying taht death takes human form owudl be the same as tothe suggest tyhat eternity owudl take human form
. handling such a rediculous task isnt incredibly difficult
and pitt deserves smoe credit for his wokr
. speaking in a calm
, soft voice
, portraying death as a lonley
, distant
and powerful guy that isnt unfamiliar withthe practial earthly matters
. he looks
and acts more like an angel ofthe death
, rether thna a demon or a red
- eyed executioner
. claire forlani
annd others are also fine
, stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits
. unfortunatly thier performances are nto anough to rescue tihs film from its self inflicted misery
. in otehr words this isnt nto wqat i expected fomr thge directer of
" scent of a woman
"
. it sould
(
and should
) be better wtih such cast
adn crew
. infront tjhe end it seems as if they have all beeen intensively wroking on a ravishingly looking soap opera
.
