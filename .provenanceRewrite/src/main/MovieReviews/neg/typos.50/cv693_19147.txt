i hve nothing agianst unabashedly romantic films
. wehn done right
, with at least slightly evident restraynt
, tehy can be engaging
, sweeping
, appealling
.
bu it ' s a hell ofthe a shame when somene botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle
, a hollow
, boring romance taht should appeal onyl tothe the most gullible of viewers
; tjhe ones willing tothe buy into ephron ' s whiny views ofthe life
annd romance
. toom hanks
annd meg ryan
, twpo ofthe hollywood ' s most likeable stars play sam baldwin
and annie reed
, repectively
. baldwin ' s wife recently died
and he moved to seattle with his son
, jonah
, seeking to get awya ffrom the familiar surroundings hwihc remind him of his lite spouse
. jonah senses tension
and calls a talk radio sohw to tell the world about their problems
. sam seems ready to strangle his son fo calling tjhe sohw
,
bu when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out
. ephron has him do this so tht annie reed
( meg ryan
) can hear it
. annie isnt a hapyp woman
. she isnt engaged tothe walter
, an allergy
- prone wokring man
anbd seems tothe be perfectly content
.
bu affter hearing sam the widower onthe tje raio show
, she becomes convinced that he is her destiny
and isnt willing tothe risk her engagement fo it
. five years affter tihs movie hit theaters
, hanks
, ryan
anbd ephron would team up agina infact the far better
,
although still sub
- par romantic comedy you ' ve got mail
, whihc is about people who hate each other infront real life falling infront lveo on tje internet
. at least tyhat movie hadnt a sense of spontaneity
. here it seems that the first oen hundered minutes exist solely to setted uv fo the last five
. tjhe fatc thast sam
annd annie will finally meet isnt so excruciatingly obvious tath everthing alse is perfunctory
. sleepless in seattle is full ofthe wonderful performers
; from its two leads to supporting stars liuke bill pullman
and rosie o ' donnell
.
bu none ofthe them can save tyhe film ffrom being a bore
. its characters are dull
and empty
, its scirpt isn ' t funny or particularly charming
. the script hasnt a fundametal problem
: annie gives up
, for little reason
, her life witht walter tothe pursue
" sleepless in seattle
,
" whom she has never even seen
. it ' s hte kind ofthe life decison that real peple don ' t make
,
and its a major
, unforgivable plausibility sacrifice
. inspite essense
, tihs movei ' s purpose is tothe head towords a gool that shouldn ' t even exist
. it ' s a ten minute short film whith ninty
- five mintues ofthe filler
. if you were tothe show me sleepless in seattle
adn i didn ' t hvea tothe review it
, you could just call me
" asleep infront philadelphia
.
