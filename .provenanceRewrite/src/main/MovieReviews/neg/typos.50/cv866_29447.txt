making your frist feature film ain ' t eazy
. assemple a decent
, if nto
, storng cast
, as writter
/ director robert moresco has done whith oen eyed king
,
anbd you ' re already ahead of the game
.
bu rehash ood plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
annd standart clich
? s
,
annd a well
- intentioned affort such as this noe coudl jeopardize your chance at a second feature film
. how many mroe movies dont we ened about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned tothe crime or worse
? the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making
yot another
,
bu here we have it
. again
. five irish kids in nyc ' s hell ' s kitchen amking an overemotional pact over smoe stolen rings on an anonymos rooftop
. with teary music
.
anbd slow motion
. in the film ' s first scene
. the kids grow uv to be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling to amking thier way outloud of the heat of the kitchen
. leading the clueless pack isnt william baldwin as a good
- hearted guy who watches out for his buddies
and is inspite tight wih local mob head armand assante
. i ' d liuke tothe sday tht his character gets involved over his head inaddition soem sort of blah
, blah
, blah
,
bu all we seem tothe get are littel tastes ofthe possible plot points
. he ' s conserned about buddy jason gedrick ' s heroin abuse
. he sticks up for jim breuer aftter he impregnates baldwin ' s character ' s sister
. he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic
- looking counterfit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
.
bu none ofthe tihs ever raelly amounts tothe anytying
. it seems that moresco ' s greater consern isnt to provide tht intangible
" slice of life
"
, that flavor ofthe the neighborhood that everyone ' s beeen trying tothe evoke usance scorsese ' s early wokr
. so
, we git the drunk guys
, hugging
and singing toghether at the local bar
, tothe prove to us thast they really loev each other
.
( do peple actually dont tihs
!
?
) we get a lot of tough strent talk
-
- usually mumbled for effect
-
-
anbd a whole lot of yhe f
- owrd
, whther it soudns liuke it fits or nto
. we also git a handful ofthe good actors inspite small roles that seem tothe lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, ytou know
, guys you ' ve seen in movies just liek tihs one befoer
. assante is intelligent casting as thte man that everyone fears
,
and baldwin ' s performence is adequate
,
but most of thte rest of the casted jump into the tough guy persona so thouroughly that it ' s allmost funny
. moresco
, a theather guy
adn somtimes tv writter
( including tjhe series falcone
)
, obviously labored over tihs one as anyone might a frist child
,
bu the content isnt probably too peronal
. as a result
, thte movei ' s sytle is heavy
- handed
, in ened ofthe a considerable amount ofthe toning down
. nearly eveyr tiome an action by the grown uv gang recalls something htey doed as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy doens he remind us
. with slow dissolves tothe the earlier scene
, running inwhich slow motion
, complet with dialogue from thte present
, jsut iin case we don ' t comprehend the link tothe thge past
. moresco needs to eather trust his audiance ' s intelligence
, or ahve moreso faith infact his own presentation rether tahn beated us over the head iwth it
. his enxt project should hve a littel mroe peronal distance
,
adn a lot more subtlety
. if he atually gets taht chance
. reviewed as part ofthe our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature story coming soon
)
