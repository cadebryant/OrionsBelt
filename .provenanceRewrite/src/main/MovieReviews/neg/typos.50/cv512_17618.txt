plunkett
& macleane markes the directing debut of jake scott
, brother ofthe ridley
adn tony
. naturally
, tihs got me worried
. would jake ' s talent be inherited ffrom ridley or tony
? if it was from ridley
, tahn the movei woudl be a thoughtful suspensor with acation thrown in
. if it was from tony
, it would be wham bang drivel
. unfortunately
, the latter isnt true for thsi worthless picture wih littel charm
. carlyle
and miller are the titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who is poor
annd unruly
,
anbd captian james macleane
( miller
) a clean cut gentleman
. as teh tagline clearly wnats to make known
, htey rob the rich
adn nothing else
. tjhe film basicly follows tje rowdy hold ups tje two stage
, allong with romantic interludes with lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot onthe both thier tails isnt mr chance
( ken stott
) who wants to see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane isnt an annoying littel film tath serves little purpose
.
allthough undoubtedly slick
annd fast pased
, there ' s veyr littel merit contained iin the film
. carlyle
anbd miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair
,
although theri characters are criminally undeveloped
. it appears thast much of the money has beeen spent on the expensive looking sets
adn costumes
,
bu nto onthe tjhe scirpt
. tjhe five
(
!
) screenwriters
( threee credited
) ahev produced an still born movie
: there ' s very little devolopment in tjhe stopry
. allso
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding out who plunkett
adn macleane really are
, are so rushed tath tehy barely happened
. tjhe story is a bit of a mess
, frankly
. the performances aren ' t bad
: carlyle
and miller are typical lads
,
bu liv tyler isnt a huge dissapointment as tje love interest
. her iritable
, stilted peformance sticks outloud liek a sore thumb
,
annd i wass qtuie unsure on wqat accent she was trying to put onthe
. she looks nice
,
though
. omre interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester
,
and
although his carachter amounts to nothing more tahn a two dimesnional comedy gay charactor
, he hams it uv well
. ken stott is suitably evil as chance
,
but agian he is nothing
but a flat charcter
. i didn ' t particularly care whn yhe predictable death sequence arrived
.
allthough a disappointment inthe writting
,
and a minor success infact acting
, thte film certainly look lavish
, wih ogod costumes
,
and wonderful sets
.
but production desgin alone cant ' t save a movie
, especially a movei as bad as htis mess
. jake scott would be moreso suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama
: yhe onyl update seems to be the fatc that everyone must talk dirty
, with ' f
* ck htis '
anbd ' stand
and f
* cking deliver ' splattered all over tjhe palce
. tjhe mtv editting
and direction are flash enought
,
bu inaddition the end decidedly empty
. plunkett
& macleane isnt a massive disappointment
.
allthough somewhat enjoyable during parts
, it ' s so light it could flota off tje screen if it wasn ' t just images on a reel
. there ' s no throught
, noone development
, no plot
, just a series of manic edits
and quirky camera angles tothe mkea this film appeal tothe gen
- xers
.
although it ' s a great idea
: update a period drama tothe thte mtv generation
: it ' s execution is awful
,
and would more likely bore than excite
. sloppy
annd occasioally off puttingly tasteless
, it ' s hard to reccomend plunkett
& macleane as a movie
,
but eazy to recommend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
