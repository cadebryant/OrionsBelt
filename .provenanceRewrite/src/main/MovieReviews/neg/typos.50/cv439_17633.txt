- the
- top parody ofthe film noir a la
" romeo is bleeding
.
" as it is
, it ' s best watched at 2am onthe showtime
( tghe lvoe scenes seem to hvea been written fo one ofthe that channel ' s soft porn programs anyway

" has a well
- known directer
, volker schl
? ndorff
, who ' s best known fo his adaptations of major literary works
, especially
" tje tin drum
.
" i suppose he must have beeen drawed tothe tihs plot
- by
- numbers scirpt by hte smae admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake
" capetown fear
.
" schl
? ndorff tries hard
