welcome to your oh
- so tipical sequel
. it trys tothe be twice as big as it ' s predecessor
,
yot ends uv twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. now ther ' s an idea
. maeby if thge ill
- fated cruise liner in htis movie hadnt striked a shallow reef easly onthe thigsn may have turned outloud better
. the first thing tht striked me
.
.
.
and surprised me
, was that tghe camera wrok
( for thte opening sequence anyway
) was terrable
. looked liuke tje cameramen weere drunk
and kept tripping onthe thier own foots
.
.
.
.
.
. veyr different to thge original movie
. thge characters
? well
, not many of thte characters actually
* hadnt
* characters
,
but here ' s a rundown
. annie
, who was tghe highlight of teh the orignal
, must haev seriously banged her head inwhich tje turain crash at yhe end ofthe the firt movei
. why
? becuase something ' s got to account for her losing that many iq points
. even
though annie wasn ' t exactly a rocket scientist in speed
, here some ofthe her actions jsut make ytou want to beat your head agaisnt a wall
. for instatance
, after successfully useing a chainsaw tothe cut a hole in a door so tath a group ofthe peple can excape noxious gases
- she stands infront the middle ofthe thte oppening for baout five mintues till someone reminds her thast the peple can ' t get ut till she get ' s thge chainsaw outloud ofthe thier faces
.
.
.
. bang bing beng inaddition point of fact sandra ' s chracter isnt turned inot little more than one of thsoe scantly dressed extras ffrom hercules
, who constantly has to be rescued
. jason patric
? all i can sday is bring bakc keanu
. keanu reeves might have hte emotional range ofthe a tree stump
.
.
.
but that ' s oney moreso tree stump than jason hasnt
. i don ' t think he changed facial expressions all movie
- jason
, smile forthe tghe cameras
!
! now frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. yuo are
.
.
. bang bang beng
.
. wooden jsut doesn ' t describe this guys performance
,
but it ' ll have tothe do
. tje bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- ther ' s a bright move
. how cin yuo go wrong wih the star from tyhat acknowledged classic
, body ofthe evidence
?
( yes
, that is sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn ' t strat out too bad
.
.
.
.
bu goes steadily downhill as the movei progresses
. inspite tje end he degenerates to chasing annie aroud forthe a hostage
, even
though he already hasnt thte moey
adn cxan excape
.
.
.
. bing beng
.
though i ' d like to give this movie a double thumbs down
, there weere some nice sequences
. concidering tyhe movei cost over 100 million dollars
- yuo ' d hope htere ' d be at least a cuple
. thte rela eye
- popper for me
, even
though it was given away inthe the trailer
.
.
.
. bang beng
.
.
.
.
. ws the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes hte oil tanker
. this looks terrific
adn i ws veyr suprised tothe hear thast the cruise liner infact it ws
.
.
.
. completly computer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don ' t think i ' ve ever seen a cg model look so real befor
. the sequence where jason patric inspite trying tothe disable thge propellers from under yhe ship isnt also terrific
,
adn the only tiem during the entire movei where ytou get tath feeling of
.
.
.
. speed
. htis lack
- ofthe
- speed problem affects many sequences
. such as the oil tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it wass
-
" oh noone
, we ' re gogin to hitted the oel tanker
!
"
, 20 minutes later
-
" oh no
, we ' re going tothe hitted the oil tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. you git the point
. tihs movei failed simpley becuase it didn ' t live uv tothe it ' s name
.
.
.
. ther wass very littel feeling ofthe speed
. in tje orginial movei
, yhe lead charactors hadnt to mkea splitted second descisions to survive
.
.
.
.
. inwhich thsi movie it falt more liek
-
" well peopel
, we ' re gonna run into tht there island inthe a faw hours
- i htikn i might stroll over tothe engineering
adn see if i can ' t turn off tje engines
.
.
. i ' m passing tghe cafeteria onthe thte way
, can i git anybody anytying
?
" yhe ending ofthe thsi movie raelly isnt terrible
. even
though it features what i ' ve sicne found out isnt one ofthe the most expensive sequences ever in a movie
- it just doesn ' t owrk at all
. the part where the liner crashes thru the town looks very realistic
,
bu
.
.
.
. surprise suprise
- it jsut takes waaaaay too long
. it seemed tothe go forthe 15 minutes befoer the ship finally stoped
. one hting that striked me as extremely poor scriptiing wass taht as tghe ship crashes through the harbour
annd twon
, around 25 people are killed by teh ship
.
.
.
.
adn htere ' s onyl 15 or so people left on the ship
. so when it stops safe
anbd sound
anbd the charactors are all cheering
- the audeince is sitting back
anbd thingking
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. htis is a happy moent becuase
?
" beng bang
then htere ws hte dog
.
.
.
.
. i alomst fell outloud of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris
. putting a dog in peril hasnt become tjhe ulitmate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. eveyr movie seems tothe hve a ' dog
- in
- danger ' sequence
- volcano
, dante ' s peak
, independece day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. this movei isnt a perfect example ofthe how nto to amke a sequal
. director jan de bont shoudln try watching the orignal movie
and thsi one back
- tothe
- bcak
annd see if he realises where he whent wrong
.
