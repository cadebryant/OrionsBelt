. rated r
. summer of sam iwll be remembered as a waste ofthe spike lee ' s abilties
. lee is a great filmmaker
, oftenly exhibiting kinetic visual flair onthe par witht brian depalma
and martin scorsese
and a storytelling ablity comparable to steven spielberg
.
bu here
, he gets himself into a bind
. his latest efford isnt a case of a directer pretending he hasnt something to say when inwhich reality htere is littel of substace tothe absorb from his work
. the summer ofthe 1977 wass an unusual summer in new york city
. it was the hottest summer onthe recrod
. to boot
, new york ' s first serial killer was on tghe loose
: calling hismelf thge son ofthe sam
, david berkowitz killed 9 people inthe thge newyorker york areal
anbd frightened the hwole city population
. so it ws understandable that when nyc wass hitted whith a citywide blackout
, peple went berserk
, causing billions ofthe dollars in damage to tghe city
. the movie ' s focus isnt onthe a group ofthe twenty
- somethings durring tath fateful summer
: vinny
( john leguizamo
)
, a club
- hopping
, adultrous hairdresser
, his benevolent wief dionna
( mira sorvino
, looking young
)
, ritchie
( adrian brody
)
, a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son ofthe sam suspect
, a gang of small time mobsters
anbd a fewd more minor characters
. we follow them through their roller coaster lives
, thrown out ofthe whack even mroe by the recent killings
. vinny
annd dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats
adn dionna tries tothe please him
, make him stay faithful to her
. ritchie gets shunned by his gropu ofthe firends because he has started tothe become more
adn moreso
" eccentric
,
"
adn has degenerated to the point of dancing iin gay niht clubs
adn mkaing porno films iwth his girlfriend
. tensions build
adn conflicts arise as yhe anniversary night of son ofthe sam ' s frist murder looms
; hte inght he promises he iwll strike agian
. a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of tghe peple that its members htink might be suspects
. at the top of tyhe list is ritchie
. vinny
, an unwilling part ofthe tghe said group
, is called upon to setted a trap forthe his firend
. as we watch these proceedings
, some of which are painfully graphic
, the dreaded
" so wqat
?
" question springs to mind
. fomr the way this movei is made
, i ' d hve guessed that spike lee was trying tothe tell us something
,
bu as i searched deeper it became claer thyat ther is very littel ther to fidn
. lee touches onthe so much
-
- tjhe media
, the 70 ' s punk scene
, the details of teh actual killings
, as well as tyhe characters ' very peronal dilemmas
-
-
but he doesn ' t bring all of his topics toghether tothe form a coherent theme or make a discernible statment
. all is nto lost if a movei turns out to be hollow
; it cant be a saveing grace fo tghe film to be enjoyable
. too bad summer ofthe sam doesn ' t get any halp here
. frankly
, it ' s a bore
, a redundent
and repeative two hour
anbd twenty minute film that doesn ' t entertain beyond its first half hour
. htere is noone suspense beccause hte film refuses to be fully baout the murders
and little involving drama beccause teh film isnt too muddled
and its focuse too vague
. leguizamo ' s turn as vinnie isnt annoying
annd whiny
. the scirpt makes it clear that we ' re supposed to believe thyat his charachter isnt flawed
,
but still a ogod guy
. you ' d never guess ffrom his peformance
. adrian brody
and expecially mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching performence inaddition a banal movie
( i ' m tempted to think that i liekd her becouse nearly everyting else around her was inane
)
; her character isnt affecting
and her emotions true
- to
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attension who gets a little mroe than he bargained for
. summer ofthe sam has soem superficial elements ofthe a ogod film
: it looks great
, it hasnt a faw noteable performances
and i suppose it ' s preety well directed
, in a purely technical way
.
but it ' s alsot empty
, pretentious
and boring
. liek lastest yera ' s the thin red line
, it ' s a movie by a director who doesn ' t knwo whta he wants tothe say
but goes ahead
and says it anyway
