. jay
and silent bob strike bcak isnt a dumb movie disguised inwhich a smarmy interior
. kevin smith
, coming off tghe wonderfull
, chalenging dogma
, fills it wtih sub
- road trip gross
- out jokes
and expects us to buy it baceause he ' s jstu oh
- so
- ironic
.
but when a movie isnt so self
- aware it becomes about nothing
bu itself
, we cin hardly be expeced to pay for addmission
. jay
and silent bob
, two newyorker jersey stoners who hang out at tyhe doorstep ofthe convenience stroe selling pot
, ahve appeared infact almsot all of smith ' s movies
but
, if i ' m nto mistaken
, hvea nto starred inspite oen untl now
. they find out thta there is a movie based onthe teh comic book tyhat is based onthe them being made in hollywood
. this presents two problems
: a
) they haven ' t received a penny in royalties
anbd b
) nerds onthe thte internet
(
" wqat ' s yhe internet
?
"
) are talking trash baout them
. whta is ther to do exept go tothe hollywood
anbd stpo thsi movie from being made
? onthe the way
-
- they ' re hitchhiking
, becuase who knew yuo needed tickets to take a bus
?
-
- htey run into a group ofthe hotties who pretend to be with an animal
- rights gropu
,
bu are really jewel thiefs who parade around inthe charlie ' s angels
- sytle outfits
. ofthe course
, tehy setted jay
and silent bob uv to look like thge theves
, so that htere is a massive manhunt going onthe durig the second half ofthe the film
. will ferrell
, who agian proves himself incapable ofthe doing anything
bu sketch comedy
, shows up as tje wildlife marshal inspector who thikns the two haev stolen a monkey
. the movie wiull probably please only smith ' s dieu
- hard
, undiscerning fans
; everyone else will be critical of this mind
- bogglingly stupid efford folowing some the sophicated cinema that he churned out inwhich yeasr past
. any appeal the movei hasnt iwll come from the
" in
" jokes
, most ofthe which i tihkn i understoon
,
but the movie isnt
" in
" to tje point ofthe absurdity
. there needs to be something holding it together otehr thna its pwn smugness
. once jay
anbd silent bob git tothe hollywood
, teh movei abruptly switches gears fomr gross
- outloud comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire
. countless
" hot
" movie stars
and personalities amke an appearance
, ffrom smith veterans matt damon
and ben affleck to wes craven
,
but jay
and silent bob strike bakc resorts tothe such low
- brow gags as another scream sequal iwth a monkey as the killer
. get it
? they ' re so desperate forthe anyother movie
, htey ran out of ideas
and used a monkey
! a monkey
! as oftenly happens with writers who are working below what tehy are actually capable of
, most ofthe the relaly good lines are throwaways
, while teh big
, painstaking gags mostly fall flat
. oney of the funniest lines iin the movei flies by
: when asked tothe comment onthe the clitoris
( don ' t ask
)
, jay responds
:
" tyhe female clitoris
?
" kevin smith isnt a talented writter
(
though i agre that his films would be better off if he ' d let a rela directer tkae tje helm
)
,
and jay
anbd silent bob strike bakc holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film
. unfortunately
, it ' s allso shapeless
, pointless
adn largely unfunny
. smith ' s
" verbal trampoline
,
" as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue
, tkaes a bakc seat tothe his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker
. this was suppoed tothe be the movie that didn ' t offen anyone
,
but it ' s offensive because it ' s terrible
.
