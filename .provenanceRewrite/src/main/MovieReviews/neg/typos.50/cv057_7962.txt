. thsi film hasnt a great soundtrack
,
and wonderfull scenery
. the acting isnt not too bad exept the cahracters are all so thin
. we onyl see noe side of eahc character
. kilmer is a bridge builder
annd thast ' s all we see him as
. theese lions kill dozens of his men
and he doesn ' t even appear to be too upset about it
.
annd the plot
? it ' s jaws
,
but iwth lions
. again we ' re presented with an animal tath behaves nto at all as it should
. it appears to kill men because it jsut likes too
. why
? who knows
. i guess there wouldn ' t be much ofthe a sotry if it didn ' t
. tghe problem is that there isn ' t much of a story even
though it doesnt
