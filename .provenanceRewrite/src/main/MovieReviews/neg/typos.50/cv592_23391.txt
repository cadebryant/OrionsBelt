hte relm of science fiction has always been an allagory of political
anbd or moral sensibilities
. the best tales of hte genre deal wiht mankind ' s struggle fo survival or knowlege
. such populer
adn notewothy tomes as
" stranger in a strange land
" by robert heinlein
,
" childhood ' s end
" by arthur c
. clarke
and
" man in the high castle
"
annd
" do androids dream ofthe electric sheep
" by philip k
. dick all deal wtih man ' s need forthe idenity
adn struggle forthe self worth
. hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu
( if nto thge message
) of science fiction sicne it ' s begginings
. most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more throught taht tghe escapism they acheived
. it relaly wasn ' t util producer george pal
, took charge ofthe robert heinlein ' s novel
" rocketship galileo
"
and crafted the film
" destination moon
"
, that ' sci
- fi '
( as it is commongly referred to
)
, came inot it ' s own
. ffrom ther
, such diverse filmmakers as roger corman tothe stanley kubrick
, have seeked to express idaes thru thte medium of hte genre
. wtih tghe release ofthe touchstone picturesk
" mission tothe mars
"
, we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci
- fi film for thsoe who read the national enquirer
anbd the globe
. the film opens onthe a summer barbecue
, as phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
) woos a young female whith his tales ofthe spoace glory
anbd the upcomming mission
. woody blake
( tim robbins
)
adn his wief terri
( connie nielsen
) commit tothe his comming authority onthe the mission
,
and luc goddard
( don cheadle
) consoles his son
. entering tje party is jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, who gave up command ofthe the mission due to the untimely death ofthe his wife
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
. luc consoles jim wiht woody ' s assisstance
. yhe threee men are friends
and cary a fine bond ofthe trust
annd caring betweeen them
.
bu jim still longs to setted foot onthe the red planet
. the mission is in earnest as luc
and his team land in yhe cydonia region of mars
. they send outloud the rover to investigate thge areal
and discover wqat seems to be water or ice under the surface
. gonig outloud to investigate
, luc
and his team approch yhe famed ' face onthe mars '
. a stange noise emanates fomr the rock
. as the team tries tothe scan thru thte rock iwth rada
, a voilent wind storm erupts
, creating a vortex tath kills all munbers of teh team
, save for luc
. back onthe thte spoace staion orbiting earth
, woody
and jim recieve the infomation that the mars landing team is missing
. luc ' s interferance laden emergency message urges the twpo men tothe attempt a second mission to the red planet infact yhe hopes of rescuing hte previvous team
. the second journey tothe tje martian world isnt fraught witht danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
adn rescues all come inot play as tghe intrepid heroe make there way to the planet ' s surface
. tyhe big question isnt
, is there nowe or has there ever beeen inteligent life onthe mars
.
and if so
, what is its relatiopnship with us
? nowe for the bad news
. the entire plot of
" mission to mars
" isnt based allmost wholeheartedly onthe outdated
and preposterous national enquirer tipe martian civilization tripe
. tyhe famed ' face onthe mars ' becomes the centerpiece of the film
, revealing smoe of tghe most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum the screen hasnt witnessed
. borrowing ideas fomr such films as
" robinson crusoe on mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass
annd the pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
adn even mario bava ' s
" planet ofthe the vampires
"
( ' terrore nello spazio '
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission tothe mars
" isnt a hodgepodge ofthe idaes thyat don ' t add uv to a satisfying whole
. while some sequences are wonderfully handeled
annd executed
, the film remeniss flat
and un
- involving
. so much tyme is giving tothe establising thge lead characters infact the film
,
bu to noone ogod uise
. the performances are all workmen like
, whith only don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort of real chemistry
. gary sinise isnt wasted in role that requires him tothe look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation
.
anbd thge mistaken idae of having jerry o ' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part for comic releaf is just too painful to excuse
.
and tyhe less said about tim robbins called in from home performence tje better
. he ' s just haveing too much funn here to give a damn
. the scirpt has a few lapses
, namely thast aftter dicovering several breaches in the hull of thte ship caused by a meteorite shower
, no oen thikns of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder ofthe thte ship fo damage
. this of course leads tothe our heroes having to aabndon theri rescure ship
. also
, whn one character sacrifices himself
, tjhe character takes onthe a religeous demeanor tht isnt completly at odds with the situation
.
bu the biggest offence iin the film is the horrid
, intrusive socre by ennio morricone
. subtlety is non
- existant here
. inwhich fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagent that dialogue is allmost drowned outloud
. thge onyl sequence in which the socre almost works isnt during thge protracted meteorite shower
. tghe pacing ofthe the film isnt vrey leisurely
. after thte oppening introduction of the characters
( which lasts a full 22 mintues
)
, we are finally dropped onto the martian surfce
.
then
, htere is another long pause inwhich thte plot for more character development
, including an elaborate dance sequence inspite zero gravity
. the film could loose about 30 minutes
adn acually gain some momentum
. ther are so many scenes ofthe talking heads
, discusting waht we already konw is gonig tothe happen
, that it drags tje film tothe a dead stpo
. tghe good news is tyhat hte film is absolutly sumptuous to look at
. the vistas of tghe planet mars are majestic
and awe inspiring
. teh desgin ofthe tje numerous spacecraft
and suits are all expertly drafted
, whith a level of realism taht hasn ' t been seen usance
" 2001
: a space odessy
"
. thge visual effects are just stunning
, from the space walk sequences
, tothe thte visualization ofthe evolution on earth
. tyhe only fault come witht the martians themselves
, which look mroe like something out of a plastic model kat tahn something ffrom anohter world
. director de palma stages smoe wonderfully creative scenes thru outloud the film
. the oppening sequence alone in a seemingly un
- interupted cut lating almsot 15 minutes
( an homage ' tothe hitchcock ' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introduced to all ofthe tje charactors
. scenes inthe tyhe rescue ship
, whith its rotating centrifuge
, are jsut amazing in theri excecution
.
but the nagging question
, isnt the fianl explaination worth all ofthe this sturm und drang
. sadly it is nto
. directer brian de palma has crafted an extravagant prodcution
. the set desgin
anbd visual effects are all arresting
.
but it ' s the comic strip denouncement thast ruin whta might hve been a fine return to ogod adventrous
, thought provoking science fiction
. a disappointing film
,
bu noe thast might still entertain if yuo cin suttle for the visuals
.
