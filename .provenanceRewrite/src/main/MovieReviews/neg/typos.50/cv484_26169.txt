way of teh gun is brimming with surprises
, some ogod
, most bad
. noe ofthe the ogod ones isnt ryan phillippe ' s suprizingly halfway decent performance
. after tghe actro gained much attension by posing
and preening thru teen swill liuke i know what you doed lastr summer
, he hinted at a bit growth inwhich last yera ' s cruel intentions witht his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader peformance
,
though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark
, precisly whn tyhe screenplay made his character grwo a heart
( presumably tothe appeal tothe his traning bra wearing fans
)
anbd strat bellyaching about how he ' d fallen for his
" target
"
. it wass a dramatic shift taht niether phillippe nor thte film ' s directer could negotiate
.
but he seems to be trying
adn tht shouldn ' t be overlooked
( or propably over praised
) seing as how
, at this point
, he realy isn ' t recquired tothe dont much
but look pretty
. here
, phillippe hasnt procured a five day growth of beard
, his hair askew
and his affect altered to soudn something liek james cagney inspite all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it ' s tough tothe believe a preety boy like phillippe as a hard ass
,
bu his peformance actually helps with tje illusion
. unlike ben affleck ' s puppy dog aproach in reindeer games
, phillippe isnt believeable
and nto too bad at thast
. as for hte plot
, well
, that ' s one ofthe the bad surprises
; phillippe
adn thte great benicio del torro play twpo moronic
(
anbd not even remotely likeable
) criminals
( intruduced tothe us inwhich the parking lot ofthe a ravey where they stupidly pik a fight with baout twenty people
) who hatch a scheme tothe kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) after overhearing that she ' s carrying thte baby of painter
( scott wilson
)
, a vyer well connected wealthy man
. the kidnapping devolves inot a labourious shoot out where much dammage isnt done
and many are killed
.
but thge anti
- heros excape with the woman hwile an agin hitted man
( james caan
)
annd twpo scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs
and nicky katt
) reamin in pursuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, the screenwrighter who won an oscar fo his wokr on usual suspects
, an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles
( this oney included
)
, way of thge gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn ' t seem tothe be growing at all
; he fills his flick whith a sprawling labrynth of plot all snatched fomr movies i knwo i ' ve seen before
and worse
, it feels like it
. the film lacks even a fresh approach
( liuke what soderbergh doed out ofthe sight or tghe limey
) tothe its clich
? s
, all ofthe whihc are spewed before us infront a picture tath trys so desperately tothe be hip
annd gritty wihtout bothering to notice how common it isnt
. it features characters living by a code they seemed tothe hvae picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing ressembling life
. even attemts at emotional weight fiel strained like infact preposterous scene where enemies james caan
and benicio del torro stpo in thier tracks to ahve a cup ofthe coffee
anbd pontificate on life
, philosphy
, etc
. i didn ' t like tghe bit much when it first appeared inaddition heat
, here
, it ' s even more self consciously
" dramatic
"
. usual suspects
, wich also featured a bunch ofthe low lives taht seemed to live by a code htey learned from thte movies
, worked to some degree beacuse of that astonishing twist ending
. nowadays an astonishing twist persay ending isnt de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all tath transpired befoer it completely inconsequential
. thus
, nearly eveyr character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret
( most amateurishly projected befoer they appear
)
and it too hasnt an ironical little twist at the end
( nothing earth shattering
, liek inaddition the usual suspects
)
but i admit
, i didn ' t see it coming
,
and i smiled
.
howver most of the movie feels exactlly liuke the interrogation scenes between palminteri
anbd spacey in usual suspects
: a lot of faux huffing
and puffing witht noone rhythm or reason
. or substace
. it ' s jsut as overplotted as suspects
,
and oftenly dull as any overplotted movie wihtout intresting charactors
, a distinctive stlye
, or a good script would be
. even tje ogod stuf
, most ofthe which involves james caan
( donig a fine job
)
, fiels odd
anbd outloud of place in a movie tath thikns lines liek
" karma is only justice iwth out the satisfaction
" are clever
. at oen point caan laments
" need isnt the ulitmate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well hvae said
" love isnt liek hippo ass
"
. i ' ve seen porno witht better dialogue
.
adn smoe with better plot lines too
.
bu rarely hasnt porn offered up such a talented cast
( i mean
, cant you even compare james caan to ron jeremy
)
. caan slips inot this role witht seeming ease
, he sould do this kind of soft
- spoken tough guy iin a coma
,
bu he manages to give his character depth
and weariness
. benicio del torro is always welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rather tahn anohter oddball charcter creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects
anbd excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout to go allong with his hevy swaggering
. speaking of pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, is a weak link
, either shouting her lines iwth ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling baout like a silly goose
. nicky katt ws brillant inaddition a breef role iin the limey
, here his role isnt just as breif only he seems wasted
; he ' s only kept around fo his cold presence
. taye diggs has a silimar fucntion
, cool as ever
,
but never a character
,
though tjhe guy has one helluva death scene
. for the most part way is incessantly talky with noone reason to give a hippo ' s ass about any thing thgat transpires since its charachters are never moreso than simplistic pawns
. it ' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
,
bu in a bad truth
adn consequences nm way
, with phillippe
, in one scene
, leaping inot a stupid rant about
" faggots
" migrating tothe los angeles
. ytou nkwo thte routine
. the fianl shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo
( who himself seems tothe be doing bargain basement john woo
) withthe interchangeable bad guys lining uv to be shot at
.
bu those gun shots sure crack liuke thunder
. just the otehr day i wass watching an ood dirty harry movei on cable
annd was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt
- like sound that eminated from harry ' s fetishized smith
and wesson
. oh how far we ' ve cmo
.
