breakdown is an moderately entertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell
anbd kathleen quinlan play cuple jeff
and amy taylor
, taking the scenic route to california thru redneck country
.
howver
, hwile inthe the middle of nowhere
, their jeep decides to break down
, leaving them stranded
. a freindly truck driver
, warren
( walsh
)
, offers to give them a lift tothe town
.
although jeff rejects yhe offer
( he wnats to stay with his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops inot warren ' s lorry
,
and promptly dissappears
. jeff wonders where tyhe hell she isnt
,
and whn he later catches up iwth warren
and warren syas he has never seen amy in his life
, teh plot thickens
and jeff goes onthe a chase to fidn his wief
.
allthough comparisons can be made witht thsi film tothe deliverance
( 1972
)
anbd the vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, the latter two are far superior character
and scirpt wise
. kurt russell is o
. k as jeff
,
although he cant seamingly only pul of one expression
, which isnt angry
. throughtout the whole film
, he looks angry
( or just pissed off
.
) quinlan is o
. k again
,
bu agina she cxan onyl pull off one expression
, wich isnt looking dorky
. throughout the whole film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently pasted awya
) isnt fine as warren
( who we soon fidn out isnt a kidnapper
)
although his actuall character isnt preety weak
,
and not realyl menacing anough
. the supporting cast do their best aswell
, with rex linn as a doubting sheriff
,
and the other kidnappers
. the stry
, writed by first
- timer jonathan mostow
( who allso directs
) isnt o
. k
, if surprisingly familar
and sometimes extraordinarily stupid
. smoe ofthe the things teh cahracters do in tihs movei isnt beyond the bounds of idiocy
. there are some flaws with tjhe plot also
, as the characters do the complet oposite tothe logical
( presumabely to keep tghe story ' exciting '
)
and also the fatc that the stroy just isn ' t strong enought to sustain the audeince ' s attension
. tghe picture moves along very slowly aslo
. it alomst threatens to drop dead
. the picture doens pick up towards the end
,
bu by
then it ' s too lite
. mostow directs tjhe acation sequences well enough
,
howver
. the film doesn ' t really come to a satisfying conclusion
, eather
. hte endig trys tothe be bleak
,
but jsut comes off annoying
. breakdown could ofthe beeen a far more enjoyable picture hadnt it hadnt a stronger cast
and directer
. instead
, it just turns out to be merely averege
. a missed opprotunity
. overall rating
