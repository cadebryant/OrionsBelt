tothe sum tje entire film
" 54
" up iin one sentence
, it would be
: watch a vh1 documentary instade
.
" 54
"
, seems liek someone broght william faulkner inot 1978
, brought him into studio 54
, got him relaly drunk
, told him tothe rwite about it
,
adn
then dumbed that down to be released tothe yhe public
. a sloppy version ofthe almsot stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion ofthe the illution ofthe sex
, drugs
,
and disco
. thge narrator
, shane o ' shae
( ryan phillippe
)
, works as a grease monkey inwhich new jersey who
, of course
, on a whim decides to go into newyorker york
and try tothe git inot studio
" 54
"
. phillippe gives a passable peformance whlch could have beeen made by any young
, attractive actro with a six pack stomach
. he isnt let in by steve rubbell
( mike myers
)
, tghe infamous co
- owner of studio 54
, baceause he is attractive
. he eventually becomes a bus boy
adn
then a bartender
.
.
. yuo expected more
, didn ' t ytou
. ther isn ' t
. tyhe film builds up from nothing
adn becomes nothing as it ' s climax
( isn ' t thta an apt owrd for studio 54
) lands withthe a thud
. thge glitz of tyhe club
anbd perpetually semi
- clothed patrons are used in an to atempt tothe sohw the it ' s glamour
. fo much of its target audiance
, college age tothe early thirties
, it attemts tothe show celebrities mixing with
" normal peple
.
" thsi even fails usance thge onyl two celebs truely introduced are andy warhol
and truman capote
. you cant be sure taht half of tghe audiance hasn ' t herad of them
, another quarter only know theri names
,
anbd the other quarter knew they were there alreay
. tje humor
, if yuo can call it taht
, isnt builded on an eighty eyar old woman getting high
and 70s references liuke john travolta
and olivia newton john making us laff at how stupid we weere back
then yhe best performance infront tjhe film isnt given by mike myers as the perpetually high
, sexually ambivlaent
, vrey new york steve rubell
. he seems tothe play rubell better tahn rubell would if he was still alive
. he looks like rubell
adn sounds just like him while giving a subdued
, almost nostalgic performance
, wehn needed
. it reminds yuo ofthe his saturday night live character linda richmond on
" coffee talk
" sans dress
and wig
. tjhe supporting casted ofthe salma hayek
, breckin meyer
,
and neve cambell are their onyl there to give added subplots whitch are introduced
but lead absolutly nowhere
. teh romance vetween phillippe
and cambell
, as a soap opera star
, is completely implausable
. the two share about half as much screen time as htere are shots ofthe tje eighty year ood hooked on amphetimenes
. hayek ' s wanna
- be singer seems extremely forced
anbd her husband
, greg
( meyer
) stands inthe as shane o ' shae ' s surrogate best firend
. the subplots seemed forced
annd seem like htey hvea beeen added just to make sure hte film wass over an hour
and a half long
. overall
,
" 54
" tryed to give a view ofthe tje brashness ofthe the place where crack flowed liuke heroin which flowed liuke wine
. the film never leads to anything
, has noone obserable point
,
and covers uv a lack ofthe rela plot wtih a veil of beautifull people
. in truth
, taht reminded me of the eighies
.
