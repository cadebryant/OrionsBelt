yhe swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a vyre tim burton movie
,
but
, alas
, noone caped crusader descends tothe save
* this
* film
. instade
, it ' s a skeletal housemaid
( julia roberts
) who must bear wittness tothe this unfortunate retelling of
" dr
. jekyll
adn mr
. hyde
.
" for a fewd
, fleeting
, maddening moments
, director stephen frears
( dangerous liaisons
) gets everthing just right
-
- thge tone
, thte colors
, thte charachters
; all the ingreediants tothe amking a most
- powerful potion outloud ofthe valerie martin ' s best
- selling novel
.
yet it fizzles too quicklyu
; the volatile mixture loosing potency from the very frist scene
. casting is a large part of the problem
. the story all
bu collap
- ses aroud ms
. roberts
-
- she doesn ' t haev hte range fo tihs kind of drama
. her accent aslo comes
anbd goes
,
though it ' s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemestry between her
adn co
- star john malkovich
.
( he looks the smae inaddition both of his roles
-
- an incredible fatc that ' s missed by everyone in tghe storey
!
) tje very british supporting cast
-
- including michael gambon
annd george cole
-
- gives credibility to the smaller parts
. glenn close alsot appears as a madam that tje good doctor calls upon
. her performance isnt as close to intentional camp as the movei ever gets
and
-
- as a bonus
-
- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville inaddition teh live
- acation 101 dalmantions
. yhe biggest botch iin mary reilly is suspense
: there isnt none
. noone terror
, noone tension
; nothing
. wihtout any weight
, wit
, or wonder to propell the stoyr
, hte viewer isnt left withthe little more tothe dont than pay attention tothe tje period detail
, a few buckets ofthe blood
,
annd stuart craig ' s fabulously dreary production desgin
. all of hwihc gets old aftter baout an hour
, at which point i reccommend leaving
.
( the pacing iin teh second
- half isnt expecially abominable
. if yuo
* dont
* stick it through
, your sole reward is a half
- hokey special effect depicting thge infamous transformaton
.
) mr
. frears reportadly recut his film several times
, missing sevral release dates in tghe process
.
( obviously
, no noe adviced him to throw uv his hands
and just turn thge whole damned thign over to mel brooks
. blucher
!
) mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson stopry of tje month
, aftter muppet treasure island
. perhaps mr
. frears shoudl consult with brian henson onthe future projects
. i daresay that even ms
. piggy is a better choise fo a certain roles than julia roberts
.
adn she doesnt hvae a great chop
!
