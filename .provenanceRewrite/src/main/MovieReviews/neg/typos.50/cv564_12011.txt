my giant begins wtih a monologue tyhat ' s omre funny thna not
and a disctinctive
` princess bride
, ' medieval fairy
- tale
- inaddition
- tghe
-
? 90s fiel
. i was pleasantly surprized how sharp thte comedy was
, with very funny scenes occuring onthe a movei setted infront romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) is visting a client
anbd inaddition yhe monastery where sammy ends up after bieng mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream
.
and when sammy meets max
, his giant
, mysterious savior plyed by gheorghe muresan
, htere is magic in teh air
; albeit it a bit goofy
, i loved eveyr minute of it
. teh film
, of course
, plays onthe thte size difference between the two
,
annd at times yuo would alomst swaer it must be speshal effects
. i particularly enjoied a shot ofthe sammy dangling his legs from a max
- sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table
and eat from oversized bowls
and spoons
. i allso liked jere burns '
( ffrom tv ' s
` something so right '
) performance as the directer of the film in romania
. at htis point
, tghe primary flaw inwhich the film isnt that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand
, particularily during his fast
- paced firt scene
. it isnt unfortunate thta tghe scirpt recquired him tothe speak quickly right outloud of the gate
, as i doed understand him mroe as tghe film contined
and i became accustomed tothe his speek
.
howver
, baout tje tiome muresan becomes coherent
, tjhe characters head tothe newyorker york
and the film tkaes a dive
. off the high board
. suddenly
, we are expeced tothe believe sammy isnt a do
- whatever
- it
- tkaes slime ball
. up untli tihs point he was persuing his own interests tothe be sure
,
but he didn ' t come off as a desperate jerk
. if he hadnt
, teh first scenes could never hve been so lighthearted
and magical
.
but now
, in new york
, we are futher intruduced tothe his neglected wife
and son
,
adn his character isnt desprate anough tothe envolve max inspite a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, which i found quite unplesant
and jarring withing tyhe framework of tyhe film
. indeed
, many scenes sticked outloud ofthe thsi film liuke incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal
, when sammy gets max a role in a big
, hollywood movie filming inwhich las vegas
. hwile i enjoied seing seagal poke funn at himself
, thte scenes appeared tothe exsist soley because ofthe his participation
, rether thna beacuse the film demanded it
.
and tghe audience isnt recquired tothe tkae a huge leap tothe believe taht max woudl win the role based onthe his quotations of shakespeare
. at tihs point i foudn mysef thikning
,
` we ' re suppoed tothe beleave that somene woudl casted tihs guy inthe a film
? '
hten i realized he was
,
annd i wass watching it
. in thge fianl thrid
, the film undergoes another transformation
, this timne tothe unbridled sentimentality
. onot
: major plot points are revealed in htis
and the final paragraph
. max whent to amercia because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood lveo
, lillianna
, who hasn ' t seen him since he was a normal
- sized kid
. her refusal tothe see max
( unbeknownst tothe him
) leads us to an awkward
` ends justify thge means ' scene as sammy ' s wief serena
, played nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i found thsi scene offensive
. nto only did it rely onthe deception tothe induce warm
, fuzzy feelings from teh audience
, it reduced max tothe somone we shoudln pity
and coddle
, whihc i thougth wass qtuie undeserved
. i htikn max coudl ahev handled tjhe truth
, gratuitous illness
anbd all
. lite infront the film we leran max
,
and in fact all giants
, have a heart condidtion wich shortens theri lives considerably
. tihs could be an enlightening revelation
,
bu the film seamingly presents it only to justify sammy ' s transformaton inot a carring
, senstive guy
-
-
annd hey
, a gerat dad
and husband
, too
!
` my giant ' suffers ffrom a poorly constructed stroy line
annd undeveloped cahracters whose actions are determined by plot points rether than thier pwn internal persuasions
. a stronger story with omre room forthe carachter growth might hvae been possibile if yhe focus was onthe max ' s struggle tothe be accepted
and cast in movies instead ofthe sammy ' s struggles to get monye
adn become a better person
. inwhich this scenario
, max ' s ilness could have been a intregal part of tjhe film not a storey motivator
. sentiment
and emotion would have followed naturually
. instead
, we ' re apparently nto supposed tothe like sammy untl yhe end
,
but we ' re nto alloween to focuse on max
. crystal
annd muresan give adequate
adn at times enjoyable performances
,
but infact the end
,
` my giant ' left me feeling like i ' d been feeded gruel from a giant spoon
.
