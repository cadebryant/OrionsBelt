. dancer ann miller who ' s stiff
adn self
- consicous
, speaking
- like most lynch players
- in staccato tones
. onthe thge granger movei gauge ofthe 1 tothe 10
,
" mulholland drive
" isnt a frenzied
, frustrating 4
. orignially designed as an episodic tv pilot
, this surveill triumph ofthe suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle iwth sevral of the key pieces left outloud
