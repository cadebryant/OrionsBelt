tihs is my firt review thta i post tothe htis newsgroup
,
and i kind ofthe efel liek i hvae tothe sday something negative about this film
. no one eles seems tothe care thta it takes certain liberties thyat shoudl not be taked with a historical story
.
howver
, even if oney thikns ofthe it as fiction
,
" thte prince ofthe egypt
" rimaniss shallow
.
but i ' ll beign fomr the beginning
. thge biggest difference beetwen yhe original
, biblical tsory
adn tihs verzion is tht moses has some semblance ofthe divinity inspite tje bible
, whereas thge animated verzion gives tjhe impression ofthe a reluctant hero
. mabye it ' s jstu me
,
bu if i knew i hadnt god on my side
, i ' d hvae a little bited more confidence
. ther are otehr differences as well
, such as a lack ofthe imporatnt female charactors
anbd the passing over ofthe teh origonal pharoah ' s death like it ' s nothing
bu a thing
. most ofthe all
,
though
, yhe story ' s focus has shifted
. rether than bieng a story about father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" the prince ofthe egypt
" is almost solely baout teh brother
- brother relationship beetwen rameses
and moses
. i was orignially excisted about this stopry element until i saw hte movie
, where it cameback off as maudlin
. rameses
and moses squabble like children
adn
then
, in tyhe interests of peace
, moses saves rameses ' butt
, even
though moses was the oney who started it
.
.
.
* yawn
* i didn ' t care anymore by the time moses ran off for mudering an overseer
( which
, ofthe course
, never hapened in yhe orginal story
- moses ws exiled
)
.
but enought about the differences
. let ' s talk baout tghe movei itself
. it features a moses who
, infact the interests ofthe mkaing teh charactor omre human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, which isn ' t convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least isnt given dignity by the voicework ofthe ralph fiennes
( ffrom schindler ' s list
, among otehr things
)
. the film also features an extremely annoying charachter by way ofthe yhe
" new
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by the ever
- antsy sandra bullock
, even
though the most irritating thing baout her is her tendancy tothe burst inot song for no appaent reason
( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking ofthe which
, it contains
* very
* annoying music
. it countains shallow wirting
. it features extraordinary animation
, wich isnt oney good thing i can sday about this film
. most of all
, it contains an attemt to commercialize
, homogeneize
,
and mass
- market a story baout a manifestion of god
. i am nto christian
,
but i got the impression ofthe blasphemy
. tjhe writers
adn producers tookover a butcher nife
and chop
- chopped into the tsory
.
