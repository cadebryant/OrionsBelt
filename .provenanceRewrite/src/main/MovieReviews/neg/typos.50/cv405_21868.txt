arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for acation enthusiasts
, usance hte lite 80 ' s
,
bu latley his films hvae beeen very sloppy
anbd tghe noe
- liners are getting worse
. it ' s hard seing arnold as mr
. freeze in batman
adn robin
, especially when he says tons of ice jokes
,
but hey he got 15 milion
, what ' s it marter tothe him
? once agian arnold hasnt signed tothe do anyother expensive blockbuster
, that cin ' t compare witht hte likes of the terminator serieses
, true lies
annd even eraser
. in tihs so called dark thriller
, the devil
( gabriel byrne
) has cmo upon earth
, to impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) which happens every 1000 yeasr
,
anbd basicly distroy the world
,
but apparantly god has chosen oen man
,
and that oney man is jericho cane
( arnold himself
)
. with the halp ofthe a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, htey will stpo at nothing to let the devil tkae over the world
! parts ofthe this are actually so absurd
, that they would fit right infront wiht dogma
. yes
, thge film isnt thast weak
,
bu it ' s better thna thge other blockbuster right now
( sleepy hollow
)
,
but it makse the world is nto enought look like a 4 star film
. anyway
, this definitly doesn ' t seem like an arnold movei
. it just wasn ' t the type of film ytou cxan see him donig
. sure he gave us a faw chuckles iwth his well known one
- liners
,
bu he seemed confused as to where his character
annd the film was going
. it ' s understandable
, especially whn the ending hadnt tothe be changed according to smoe sources
. asside form that
, he still walked thru it
, much like he has inaddition hte past faw films
. i ' m sorry tothe sday this arnold
but maybe these are tyhe end of your acation days
. speaking of acation
, where ws it infront this film
? ther ws hardly any explosions or fights
. the devil made a few places explode
,
but arnold wasn ' t kicking soem devil butt
. the ending ws changed tothe mkae it more spriritual
, wich undoubtedly ruined the film
. i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occured
,
bu once agina i was let down
. i also don ' t nkwo why the film tookover so long
adn cost so much
. htere ws relaly noone super affects at all
, unless ytou concider an inviible devil
, who was inaddition it fo 5 minutes tops
, worth thte overpriced budget
. tjhe budget should have gone into a better scirpt
, where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instade ofthe facing boredom
. it ' s pitiful tothe see how scripts like theese git bought
and made inot a movie
. do they even read theese thnigs anymore
? it sure doesn ' t seem liek it
. thankfully gabriel ' s performance gavey soem ight tothe this poore film
. wehn he walks down thte street searching for robin tunney
, you can ' t help
but efel thast he looked liek a devil
. thge guy is creepy looking anyway
! wehn it ' s all over
, you ' re just glad it ' s teh end ofthe the movie
. don ' t bother tothe see this
, if ytou ' re expecting a solid action flick
, because it ' s neither solid nor does it have acation
. it ' s just anyother movei tht we are suckered in tothe seing
, due tothe a strategic marketting campain
. sive your mney
adn see thte world is not anough fo an entertaining eperience
.
