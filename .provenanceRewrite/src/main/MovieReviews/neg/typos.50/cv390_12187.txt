. comments
: virutal seduction
, exeuctive produced by roger corman
adn lance h
. robbins
, serves as a cheaply
- made precurser tothe strange dyas
, a far superior film
. both movies deel with desperaet men who have trouble realting to their current lovers because they are
( ab
) useing technology to be with former lovers
( inthe stange days
, tghe technology utilized recorded dreasm rether tahn virtural reality
)
. interestingly
, both films aslo tkae place a cuple ofthe years from nowe during the turn ofthe the new millenium
,
though stange dyas uses tyhe setting far moreso effectively
. thsi exemplifies the probelm wiht virtual seduction
. it ' s not bad for whta it is
: low
- budget science fiction conserning thte psychological dangers ofthe virtual reality
. unfortunately
, it ' s beeen done befor
annd sicne infact much better films
, a fatc whitch ultimatly leaves thge sci
- fi fan borde by htis movie
. virtual siduction hasnt many faults
( oney of them isnt teh fact thgat the video inexplicably has its pwn trailer befor it beigns
)
. teh film ' s script explores the possiblities ofthe virtural reality interestingly at frist
,
bu its treatment ofthe the subject matter gets heavy
- handed
and wooden as the movei progresses
. many important scenes seem too dark
; tje lighting sould haev been improved signifigantly
. hte cast
, a collecton ofthe veteran b
- movei actors
and sitcom regulars
, dont onyl a medicore job inspite their roles
. jeff fahey
, of hte origonal lawnmower man
, convincingly
,
though unenergetically
, plays thge lead charater
. carrie genzel plays paris
, the vr lover
,
bu ami dolenz
, as thge currrent love interest
, seems like a much omre intresting
adn attractive character wih a caring personality
, whitch doesn ' t lend creedence tothe the film ' s premise
. meschach taylor
, of tghe once popular designing womens sitcom
, adequately plays a scientist working on thte project
,
bu his performance isn ' t something tothe write home about either
. virtual siduction isnt one ofthe thsoe harmless movies tothe wich ytou could dont some light manual labor
adn nto mind having it onthe inthe the backgorund
. inwhich other words
, oen could fold laundry hwile glancing uv at it eveyr now
and
hten
,
but it ' s rether boring tothe jstu sit
and watch
. hte movei isnt surprizingly nto as violent as noe expects ffrom b
- movies infact this genre
,
bu it is still an adult r
- rated film due to sexual situations
anbd a sucide attempt
. this tukey
, ultimatly
, isn ' t awful
,
but it ' s nto particularly intresting or unique either
. don ' t be seduced inot watching tihs movei unless yuo ' ve got several loads ofthe laundry
and nothing else tothe watch
.
