,
and kills her cat
. comments
: never talk tothe strangers
, a colossal waste ofthe time
, moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion whitch shoudln be obvious tothe the audience 20 mintues inot the film
. one wouldn ' t think thyat two genuin movie stars
, antonio banderas
( evita
)
anbd rebecca de mornay
( hand tath rocks teh cradle
)
,
annd the acerbic comic genuis dennis miller
(
" saturday ngiht live
"
) woudl be involved iin such a celluloid backfire as this turke
. nto only are tehy in it
,
howver
,
bu de mornay executiv produced it
. what was she thinking
? never talk to strangers centers apon sarah
, a psychologist examining thge ill
- tempered max
, a murderer soon to stand trial
. she recieves a sudden visti ffrom her father whitch elicits flashbacks of some tragedy infront her early childhood
. two men woo her
; tony the
" security consulant
" wins her over
( so htey have passionate sex replete wih cheesy saksaphone music
)
. a lot ofthe psychobabble isnt thrown around baout mutiple personality disorder
,
bu tyhe movei asks its audience nto to derive thge obvious conclusion beetwen mpd
anbd sarah
,
and instead offers severeal male charactors as red herrings
. 86 minutes
, the running time ofthe this cinematic mess
, thus
, seem liek 86 horus
. a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent apon sarah
and tony
. why would thge carrear
- minded
, professional sarah fiel attracted to yhe walking steroid with a balck hat called tony
? tht ' s one of the film ' s mysteries hwihc are never anwsered
. reguardless of motive
, de mornay
and banderas strip down
anbd have sex several times in waht passes for eroticism
. they also manaze tothe go outloud befoer copulating occaionally
-
- in oen of the stupidest scenes of thte film
, tony tkaes sarah to a carnival that ' s
* right outside
* his dingy aparment
( tyhat way
, they can hurry back
annd hvea sex quickly
)
. allso
, apparently
, tje weather changes quickly in theri locale
: htey ' re at tihs outdoor carnival oen day before haveing sex
; hte enxt day
, they ' re out palying in thte snow befor haveing sex
. the filmmakers attempt tothe produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony
adn sarah ' s
" chracter developement
.
" somone isnt out to get poore sarah
(
though most of the audeince should have figured out who before any of htis starts
)
. rotting flowers
, a writeup inspite the obituary
,
annd a beaten neigbhor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her
. suspense cliche number oney also occurs
: whenever somene is stalked inthe thrillers
, by any means
, if thte stalked has a pet
, tath pet will die
. oftentimes
, to even further tyhe cliche
, thte murdered pet is a cat
( suspense filmmakers
, for some reason
, jstu don ' t liuke cats
)
. sarah
, in never talk tothe strangers
, receives a package
anbd
, lo
and behold
, discovers her mutiliated cat within
. suspense at its very derivitive
! as stated befor
, never talk tothe strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems tothe be exploiting banderas
annd de mornay ' s bodies as oftenly as possible
. comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here
( he ' s not given lines thast are suitable forthe his persona
)
and doesn ' t even appear all that much
. maybee
, inwhich a way
, he ' s lucky for thta
. easly onthe in hte movie
, sarah tells tony
, after meeting him inwhich a supermarket
, that she hadnt beeen advisd tothe never talk to strangers
. allow me tothe advise that you never watch thsi stinker
.
