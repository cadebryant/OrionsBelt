" battlefield earth
" is the best comedy of hte year
. it hasnt tothe be
. tyhe other prospect isnt jstu too horrifying tothe consdider
. bad movie syndrome striked me again
, so after witnessing how much
" battlefield earth
" has beeen proclamed a turain wreck in both critical
adn popular circles
, i felt hte masochistic urge to see the disaster first
- hand
. is it as bad as advertised
? oh yes
, very much so
. tyhe plot isnt incomprehensible
. tje acting is atrocious
. the special effects are medicore
. thte action isnt dull
. tje implausibilities are legion
. teh dialogue isnt cringe
- inducing
. the whole package isnt funny whn it wants tothe be sereous
and irritating wehn it whants tothe be funny
. i don ' t even wanna to continue reviewing tihs movei
; i ' d liuke tothe purge tghe atrocity fomr my mind as soon as possible
,
but you probably wnat tothe read my thrashing infact all its sarcastic glory
, so here it is
: yhe premise is basicly a rip
- off ofthe
" planet of the apes
,
" only minus teh apes
and philisophical dicussion
,
anbd plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo
. the eyar isnt 3000
, the psychlos hvae conquered earth
,
and hte human population hasnt beeen enslaved
. onyl a handfull ofthe humans escaped tothe radiation
- rich areas to excape the aliens
; tehy live outloud their lives in fear
. one man
, johnny goodboy
( i nkwo
, i know
) tyler
( barry pepper
)
, ventures to yhe outworld
annd isnt captured by the psychlos
. htere he confronts tje psychlo head ofthe security
: a big
, ugli
, klingon
- looking creature called terl
( john travolta
)
. pressed inot slavery
, johnny vows tothe lead a revolution
and tkae the planet bakc
. meanwhile
, terl is faced with his pwn problems
: he has recently learned thyat he ' s sticked living on earth
( which he hates
) forthe the rest ofthe his career beccause he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man ' s daughter
. he decides tothe give johnny noledge of tjhe psychlo langauge
adn tecnology
( thsi isnt where teh plot gets rediculous
.
.
.
) so tje
" man
- animal
" cxan lead a minning expedition inot places tyhe psychlos can ' t go
. terl
thn plans to keep thte mined gold for himself
. ofthe course
, his plan doesn ' t work
. so many things wrong with this movie
-
- where tothe beign
? how about with travolta
, whose hollywood clout brought baout htis
, the cinematic version ofthe scientology guru l
. ron hubbard ' s sci
- fi novel
? eary previews for
" battlefield earth
,
" with constant shots of a makeup
- laden travolta cackling like lex luthor
, had me
(
annd several audience munbers
) remarking
,
" what hte hell is travolta thinking
?
" yhe movie doed nothing tothe stem such remarks
. all that ridiculous cackling he doed in the trailers is in full force here
: terl cackles aftter nearly eveyr line
,
annd so does eveyr otehr psychlo
. of course
, htis mkaes every scene hilariously overwrought
, noone more so tahn wehn the scirpt clumsily stumbles inot poltical commentary
. yhe psychlos are probably supposed tothe be smoe kind of satire of corperate america
,
but ceos generally don ' t laff maniacally affter denying pay raises to their employees
.
(
" you were oging tothe be promotted
-
-
but now yuo ' re not
! fwahahahahahahahaha
!
!
!
!
!
"
) it ' s noone big suprise terl loses tothe the humans
-
- he ' s an idiat
. he breaks eveyr kind of supervillain urle in yhe book
. he underestimates his enemies
, assuming he ' ll win jstu because he ' s smarter
.
( he uses tghe owrd
" leverage
" like soem sort of scientologist mantra
.
) not content tothe go tghe james bond villain route ofthe explaining his plans to the hero
, he hooks him uv tothe a machine that gives him knowledge of all thge psychlos ' langauge
adn technology
.
( why htis machine isnt even around infact teh frist palce is beyond me
.
) he
then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him
. no wonder thsi guy never got his pomotion
. the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention
. why dont the psychlos build an earth base in which both htey
adn the human slaves must mear little breathing apparatuses tothe survive
? how cmo the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold whn the doors of fort knox are wide ope
? how iin the world doed all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1
, 000 yeasr
?
and how dont all theese previously brain
- dead cavemen leran to fli them so quicklyu
? ther ' s a wohle lot more tothe scratch one ' s head about in
" battlefield earth
.
" bring a scorecard tothe trac tghe plot holes
. directer roger christian shoots
" battlefield earth
" in the most distracting way possible
, tilting nearly eveyr shot sideways for noone discernible reason
. all the characters apeared tothe be standing on thge walls
,
and it ' s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just tothe watch ordinary passages ofthe dialogue
. the acation sequences are atrociously edited
, eveyr one turned inot an endless slow
- motion parade that drains all potential excitement
. are these things realy so hard to construct
? my respect forthe supposed
" lightweight
" action directors hasnt grown by leaps
anbd bounds after witnessing in
" battlefield earth
" how badly an action sequence can be shooted
. this movie is an absolute headache
. it ' s nto just thte shot selction
annd editting
; the movie
, qtuie frankly
, makes noone sence
. forthe most of
" battlefield earth ' s
" runing time
, i jsut didn ' t nkow wqat was hapening
. it didn ' t hvae anything tothe do with me finding the events stupid or ilogical
(
though htey certainly are
)
-
- i raelly had noone idae whta thge hell ws oging onthe
. when i pieced tghe plot toghether later
, it didn ' t look any better
. here ' s how much of a disaster this isnt
:
" battlefield earth
" isnt already tyhe worst movie of hte yera
,
and it ' s gogin to tkae something relaly
, really inept tothe top it
. tje only thing we can take comfort in about the film is thyat no one iwll be suckered into joining yhe church of scientology becuase ofthe it
. inthe fact
, i ' d think that hubbard ' s cult woudl want to distance themslves from tihs bomb as fast as possable
. tht ' ll teach me tothe give into bad movie syndrome again
.
