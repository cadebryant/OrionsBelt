it ' s nowe the anniversary ofthe the slayings ofthe julie james '
( jennifer loev hewitt
) best friends
. still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all
, she seems tothe be onthe the verge ofthe a nervous breakdown
. she cin ' t oncentrate on her schoolwork
, cant ' t git a good inght ' s sleep
,
annd isnt even frightened by thge shadows
and the blinking strobe ights at a local dance club
. everywhere she looks
, she sees visions ofthe the man infact a rubber slicker whith the hook onthe his hand
. in the frist movei
,
` i nkow wqat you doed last summer '
, julie
and threee ofthe her firends accidetally kill a man
, runing him down hwile driving down a dark mountain higway
. to cover their misdeed
, htey dump thge body into the ocean
.
howver
, he never quite died
and retured tothe hunt down julie
adn her friends
. julie
and one otehr
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, survivied onyl tothe make this dismal sequal
. needing some desparate rest
annd relaxation
, she is elated to learn tath her college roommate
, karla
( brandy
)
, hasnt won a trip for four tothe a secluded tropical island
. accompanying theese two girls are karla ' s overbearing boyfriend
, tyrell
( mehki phifer
)
adn a potential beau for julie
.
bu was tihs contest too ogod to be true
? the resort is filled with a skeleton stff thta seemed like loev boat rejects
. meanwhile
, the hotel isnt practicaly deserted as thge storm season is about to beign
. htis presumibly creates a venue where they will be secluded
and will hve no possible means off the island
. eventually
, tehy iwll be hunted down druing power outages
anbd chased arund durig intense lightning storms
. as ytou might have guessed
, somewhere inspite the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker
anbd wielding a hook
. julie trys to convince her firends thgat teh killer isnt on the island
( an eerie touch is when she isnt singing
" i iwll survive
" at tje karaoke bar
and thge words scoll
" i still know
.
.
.
"
)
,
bu her firends chalk it up tothe paranoia
.
but tyhe body count soon starts tothe rise
,
and for julie
, it ' s oging tothe be thte worst vacation of her life
. the funny
( yes
, i used the word ' funny '
) thnig about thsi movei isnt that i heard more chortling
adn giggling
( maybe it wass my giggling
) thna i herad screaming
. tihs movei boils down tothe a mindless slashfest that never conjures uv any ammount ofthe wry witn or even a quirky campiness
. ther isn ' t even any suspense that leads uv tothe the deaths
. here ' s an apropriate exemple
. knock
- knock
.
" housekeeping
"
, says the diminuitive cleaning lady
. thte doorjam suddenly opens uv
. slash
. enxt victum
! is ther any reason tothe go
adn see htis movei
? not unless yuo want to see four uninteresting coleeg kids run aroud in circles fo baout 90 mintues
.
bu i do want tothe sday one thnig about this movie that satisfied me
. i was thouroughly irritated iwth tyrell
, who incessantly ranted
and raved about his sexual libido
. i secretly wished fo him to get filleted
. did he get ' hooked '
? well
, let ' s jsut sday that if he didn ' t
, i would give this film a grade ofthe
" d
"
