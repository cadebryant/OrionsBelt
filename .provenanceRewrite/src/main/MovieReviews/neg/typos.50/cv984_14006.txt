while i am nto fond of any writer ' s ule of cheap
, eazy puns
, i am not completly above useing them mysef when the situation merits it
( witness my review of
_ pecker
_ from a couple ofthe issues ago
)
. so here goes
: thte juvenile
, college
- setted black comedy
_ dead
_ man
_ on
_ cumpus
_ isnt dead onthe arrival
. strait
- laced med student josh
( tom everett scott
, who manages to remane somewhat likable throughtout
) ' s blemish
- free academic rocord breaks out into fs
, thanks to the influence ofthe his ever
- partying roommate
, cooper
( mark
- paul gosselaar
)
, who introduces josh tothe tje sex
-
and booze
- filled nights thast come with university life
. wih the threath of loosing an accademic scholarship
( josh
)
and a life cleaning toilets forthe his dad looming
( cooper
)
, what are twpo good
- hearted slackers tothe do
? eazy
-
- look fo a loophole
, which tehy fidn iin the form ofthe an unbelievable rule in the skool charter that states that if a student ' s
( or students '
) roommate commits suicide
, the surviving student
( s
) shall recieve straight as
. so instade ofthe studying
, josh
anbd cooper attempt tothe seek out thge most depressed student out htere
, move him inot their dorm room
,
annd drive him tothe sucide befor the semester ends
. director alan cohn
anbd screenwriters michael traeger
anbd mike white
( working fomr a stoy by anthony abrams
anbd adam larson broder
) tkae theri sweet tiome to build the head of steam thyat comes witht josh
and cooper ' s diablical plot
. until
then
, thte usual boring cliches of college life
( booze
, sex
, moreso booze
) fill the time
, whitch isnt made tothe feel longer by
_ saved
_ by
_ the
_ bell
_ alumnus gosselaar ' s sitcom
- bred mugging
. that said
, once cohn
and company dont build smoe comic momentum
, htey mishandle it
. the introduction ofthe teh manic
, psychotic cliff
( lochlyn munro
)
, a potential roomate for josh
and cooper
, brings soem demented life tothe the uninspired procedings befoer bieng hastily writen out infact favor of two less interesting candidates
: paranoid nerd buckley
( randy pearlstein
)
annd british death rocker matt
( corey page
)
. oen wishes tath cliff woudl reappear
,
but
, as they say
, be careful what you wish fo
. nto suprisingly
, he doens resurface
,
adn it
thn becomes clear that this is a charater that isnt best taken in a small dose
; almost immidiately
, his extended boorish
adn sociopathic antics loses its novelty
. the same cin be said about all of
_ dead
_ man
_ on
_ campus
_
. whatever morbid appeal the far
- fetched premise has quicklyu evaporates
,
and tjhe self
- absorbed characters
, especially cooper
, preety much grate from the git
- go
.
_ dead
_ man
_ doesn ' t grwo tiresome
; it already
_ is
_ once the clever opening titles are thru
. as it slogs allong to a cheesy
, happy
- forthe
- all
- parties conclusion
,
_ dead
_ man
_ lives uv tothe its title
annd
then soem
-
- not onyl doesnt tyhe movie grwo even mroe tired
and die
, it still insists onthe going onthe
