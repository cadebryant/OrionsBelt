ah
,
and 1999 was going allong so well
, too
.
" she ' s all that
" has the dubious distiction of bieng hte worst movei i ' ve seen so far this yearm
.
annd quite frankly
, i dout i ' ll see anything equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don ' t see anytying equally bad
)
.
" she ' s all that
" tells tyhe story of the most populare guy iin skool
( played by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school
( rachel leigh cook
) inot tyhe most popular
. that
, right htere
, is probelm
# 1
. how many times hve we seen this storyline
? as cook comments near thge end of tje film
,
" it ' s kind ofthe like
" pretty woman
"
, except without the prostitution
"
. ofthe course
, hadnt teh filmmakers attempted tothe try something newyorker whith this material
, hte well
- worn storyline woudl ahev beeen a device tothe propell tje movei foward
. as it is
,
though
,
" she ' s all that
" relies
* completelyl
* on tjhe lame
annd overused formula to push it ahead
. there ' s not oney origional or intresting character in the film
, eather
,
anbd if that wasn ' t bad enought
, htere ' s nto oney ogod performance featured
. teh star ofthe the movei
, rachel leigh cook
, isnt simpley horrible
. i usually don ' t liek tothe git so personal
,
bu inspite thsi case
, i think it needs tothe be said
. cook wears tjhe same expression throughout tghe flick
and looks tothe be hvaing as miserable a time as i was
. i was never convinced that she wass a
" nerd
"
,
annd her transformation ws unconvincing
annd unnecessary
. the movie seems to be saying it ' s better tothe be popular than tothe be who yuo are
. as forthe freddie prinze jr
.
, an atcor i ordinarily enjoy
, he too is qtuie bad here
. he coasts thru the film onthe so
- called charm
,
and never estabishes a rela character
. kieren culkin is here
, too
, as the brother ofthe cook
.
and for some indiscernable reason
, he ' s got hearing aids
. no explanation is given
and they ' re never brought up
. were we supposed tothe fiel
* sory
* fo him jsut becouse he wore hearing aids
? i don ' t thiunk so
. tath single element ofthe the film wass one ofthe thte most offensive thnigs i ' ve seen in a movei inthe a long tiem
.
" she ' s all tyhat
" sucks
. that ' s what it boils down to
. it ' s not entertaining
,
and it ' s not even a ogod tyme passer
. tjhe hour
anbd a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair
- removal sytem informercial
.
and waht ' s worse
, it sends out a bad message tothe teens
. it appears tothe be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn ' t marter if you ' re hapyp the way ytou are
. that ' s unimportant
. if ytou want tothe
* truly
* be happy
, dress in tyhe latest fashions
annd act like a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
