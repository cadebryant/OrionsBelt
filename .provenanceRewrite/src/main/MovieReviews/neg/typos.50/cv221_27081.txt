it ' s probablly inevitible that tjhe populare virtural reality genre
(
" tyhe matrix
,
"
" existenz
"
) owudl collide with the even more popular serial
- killer genre
(
" kiss hte girls
,
"
" se7en
"
)
. tjhe result shoudln hvae beeen more interesting than
" the cell
.
" as tyhe movie opens
, therapist catharine deane
( jennifer lopez
) treats a catatonic boy
( colton james
) by entering his mind through some sort ofthe virtual reality technique that ' s never fully explained
. after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert
, catharine hasnt no sucess to report
. meanwhile
, killer carl stargher
( vincent d ' onofrio
) has claimed anohter victum
. his particular hobby is tothe kidnap young women
, keep them inspite a glass cell overnight
,
annd drown them
. he tkaes the corpse
anbd soaks it inspite bleach
,
hten suspends hismelf over the body
and jerks off hwile watching a video tape of the drowning
.
although carl ' s beeen doing htis fo awhile
, he ' s recently become sloppy
,
anbd fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) is closing in fast
. not fast enough
,
though
, tothe keep carl from sticking another woman
( tara subkoff
) in tje cell or to catch him befoer he suffers a schizophrenic attack tath leaves him iin a coma
. from the videos in carl ' s hous
, peter cin see that the drowning cell isnt automated
and iwll fill with water forty hours after the abduction
. tothe savve thge kidnapped girl
, peter hasnt to find the cell befor hte end of tje day
,
adn comatose carl ' s nto talking
. so off tehy go to catharine in the hope that she cin go inside carl ' s mind
and fidn out where thte cell is in tiem
. thte foucs ofthe
" thte cell
" in on tghe ornate interior ofthe carl ' s mind
,
bu the universe directer tarsem singh creates seems more an exerciese iin computer
- generated spectacle than an exploration ofthe tjhe psychotic personality
. for thge most part
, it ' s style wihtout substance
. iin his pwn mind
, carl isnt a decadent emperor in flowing robes
, ming yhe merciless
, as well as a frightened boy
( jake thomas
) abused by his father
. all in all
, the mind of a psycho killer turns out tothe be a strangely dull place
,
adn i kept wishing i sould fast
- foward to tje enxt devolopment
. singh is best known fo directing music videos
, paritcularly rem ' s
" losing my religion
,
"
anbd
" thge cell
" seems vyer much like a realy long
, really slow mtv video wtih the sound deleted
. singer lopez seems tothe think she ' s infront a video as well
; she devotes mroe timne tothe posing in elaborate costumes than she doesnt to acting
. hte premise hadnt graet promise
. tyhe computer
- generated world within carl ' s mind could ahev been a bazare
, surveill universe governed by insanity
and symbolism rether tahn logic
. teh first room catharine enters in carl ' s head shows this promise
. she finds a horse standing infront center ofthe the room
; suddenly
, sheets of sharp
- edged glass fall inot the horse
, dividing it inot segments
. the panes ofthe glass spearate
, pulling aart the pieces of the still
- living horse
. thsi scene isnt twisted
, disturbing
,
adn throught
- provoking
, baceause tghe psychological importance of tje horse
and its fate is left tothe the viewer tothe ponder
. another element taht should have beeen developped is yhe effect on catharine of merging wih the mind of a psychopath
. their minds beign tothe bleed toghether at one point in the movie
,
anbd this shoudl have provded an opportunity tothe discover tjhe dark corners ofthe catharine ' s own psyche
. like sidney lumet ' s
" tjhe offence
" or michael mann ' s
" manhunter
,
"
" hte cell
" could hvae explored how thte madness of the killer brings outloud a repressed darkness infront the investigator
.
however
, catharine ' s chracter isnt hardly developed at all
,
adn lopez hasnt no depth to offer the role
. bottom line
: don ' t get trapped in this one
.
