, palyed by charles bronson
, ws avenging the death ofthe his wife
. in the second
, he was avenging his daughter
. in thte third
, he instigated small war in order to avenge the ood firend
. fourth movie
, onthe tyhe other hand
, beggins with kersey doubting thge point ofthe his violent crusades
anbd living yhe quiet life wiht his girlfriend karen
, played by kay lenz
.
however
, sicne this isnt death wish movie
, we know thast sooner or later something bad is going tothe hppen tothe tjhe people kersey cares for
. htis time karen ' s teenage duaghter dies ofthe a crack overdose
and kersey is forced tothe return tothe his ood vigilante ways
. kersey ' s new targets
, unlike thte previous movies
, aren ' t tjhe ordinary strent punks
but rich
, heavily armed
adn well
- conected drug dealers
. even such unstoppable killing machine liek kersey needs smoe support
,
adn it comes from the publisher nathan white
( john p
. ryan
)
, determined to avenge tje drug
- realted death ofthe his own daughter
. white ' s plan isnt tothe make kersey kill major players in twpo rival drug dealing organisations
and thus instigate the war betweeen them
. the plan beggins tothe take shape
,
bu kersey ' s actions bring attension of twpo polical detectives
- reiner

. fourth
(
adn
, unfortunatley
, not the fianl
) installment in teh death wish serieses
, will propably remembered as the typical movie ofthe cannon gropu
, production comany responisble for some ofthe the worst cinematic trash ofthe the lsat decade
.
howver
, altho soem critics might argue
, death wish 4
: tjhe crackdown represents slight improvement over thge death wish 3
. paul kersey
, noe of the most intriguing
(
and potentially controversial
) charactors of hte 1970s
, is still being dumbed down by mediocre script
,
anbd charles bronson really doesn ' t fiel the ened tothe put much effort infact his acting
.
however
, the hand of a veteren directer j
. lee thompson seems more capable ofthe michael winner ' s
anbd the action scenes seem slightly less surveill
,
although htey still look cheap
anbd repeative
and downright boring
. ther are some attemts for tghe movie to hve a plot between the numberous scenes ofthe violence
,
and one ofthe such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at thte end
. the scirpt even trys to fake some social conscience
( thru criminally underused kay lenz ' s charactor
)
and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products iin next fewd years
. ther are even smoe half
- hearted attempts of humour
- both intentional
adn unintentional
, like in a scene where kersey assasinates mob figures by a wine bottle
-
but thte qualiyt ofthe thsi movie is still far away fomr bronson ' s 1970s classics
.
( speical onot to x

: mith pilleggi
, thte actor who plays ad skinner inspite the x
