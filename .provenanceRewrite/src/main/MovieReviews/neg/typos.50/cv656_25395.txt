it seemed like yhe perfect consept
. what better forthe yhe farrelly brothers
, faymus forthe writing
and directing comedies with offensive subject marter
, than tothe make a movie baout a guy with a split personality
? it ' s exactly the sort of thing tje brothers relish
: poking funn at something serious
( in this case mental ilness
)
, throwing all care to thte wind to git a laugh
. jim carrey ' s signed on too
? even better
. thge national alliance for the menally ill even helpped outloud by levying complaints agains the brothers ' newyorker film befoer its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting yhe condidtion ofthe split personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
anbd so forth
. such a protest seemed liuke jstu the sort ofthe hting that would
, ofthe course
, onyl add more fuel tothe yhe farrelly brothers ' frie
, proving that some people just couldn ' t tkae a joke
,
and thyat teh farrellys woudl be helping tje mroe enlightened viewers to
yet another dose ofthe theri brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but one thnig went wrong
: their movie isn ' t funny
. it ' s not for lack of trying
. tyhe farrellys utilize iin
" me
, mysef
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who affter bieng dumped by his wief forthe a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his aggresisve feelings deep down inside
annd never realease them
. htis
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, makeing his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie ' s repressed aggression manifests itself inot a second
, independent personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid ofthe tkaing the assertive actions his predecessor hadnt beeen unable to muster
. htis guy isn ' t above crashing a car thru the wall ofthe the barber shop in whic he ' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl ' s head underwater becasue she refused to stop jump
- roping in the street
.
then thigns start getting lost inaddition the most complicated plot teh farrellys have ever attemped
,
and the film runs off its tracks
. soem have suggested that this isn ' t a probelm
, because the farrelly brothers ' brand ofthe humer doesn ' t recquire plot to wrok
. tehy ' re wrong
, ofthe course
: plot ws greatly instrumental in buiding up thge kind ofthe rollicking comic energy thast infused the farrellys ' last efford
, 1996 ' s
" there ' s something baout mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" ws technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers ' earlier film wasn ' t funny mearly becuase it contained outrageous gags
( despite what some newsmagazine articles woudl ahev you bleieve
)
,
but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" hte farrellys managed several times tothe pul off a neat sleight
- of
- hand trck
: htey ' d have ytou thingking the tsory was gogin oney way
,
hten reveal its real direction infact delightfully surprising fasion
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to ahev been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
annd saw only the surface grossness
, missing all of the subtle machinations tht realy made it work
. haveing been produced by teh smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems like an even bigger disappointment
. the brothers pile onthe tghe offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illness
,
and all manner ofthe bathroom jokes
.
bu they haven ' t come up with a way to mkea any ofthe it fresh most of
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- tjhe
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. tjhe plot
, with carrey forced tothe drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s inwhich moreso trouble thna anyone knows
, back tothe newyorker york
, has an endig that ' s entirely predicatble from the get
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene will fall inwhich love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then introduce scores of differnt cahracters
,
and none of them ever manaze to do anything yuo haven ' t already expeced them tothe dont
, no matter how outrageous thier actions might be
. compaired tothe tje curveballs tje farrellys are used tothe throwing
, htis stuff isnt almsot entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: wehn gross
- out humer loses its shock value
, it ' s noone longer funny
, mearly gross
. the jokes thyat do work are milked over
and over until their effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, fo example
, the subplot involving charlie ' s three black sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity ofthe it all is funny fo a hwile
, withthe threee burly balck men discussing higher math infront ghetto langauge
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said langauge with an entirely too
- pleasant smile on his face
.
bu by the end ofthe the film
, htey ' re still doing the same schitck it hasn ' t beeen elevated to anohter
, funnier levle
,
adn it hasn ' t beeen dropped either
. tht ' s too bad
, baceause it ceases tothe be amusing baout halfway thru
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. there ought to be omre foucs on how other peopel react to charlie ' s new perosnality
,
and onthe how charlie deals wih tyhe consequences ofthe hank ' s actions
. this doesn ' t really happn nearly every supporting charactor lerans about charlie ' s condidtion easly onthe
, so htey don ' t hvea any opportunity tothe be surprised by it
. the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve inthe a scene towards thge midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pik up called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but the script doesn ' t go anywhere iwth it
, instade leaving the thread twisting inthe thte wind befor awkwardly tying it uv durig yhe climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physically
adn vocally
,
but he ' s left with nothing much to dont here exept contort himselv inwhich a manner simular to steve martin in
" all of me
.
" it ' s a graet showcase of flexibility
annd splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
bu none of it isnt terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pul any stunts we don ' t expect him tothe pul
,
annd the farrellys ' script doesn ' t give him anything alse tothe pul
: the situations in which he must perform the role
- shifting aren ' t set uv iin any meaningfull way
. perhaps carrey cin tkae solace inthe yhe fatc thyat his supporting actors fare noone better
. zellweger ' s irene is nto a storng female lead mary in
" mary
" may have beeen part adolescent fantasy
,
bu she was allso intelligent
adn strong
- willed
. irene is nothing infact particular
, as the film never makes clear whether she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing tothe latch onto as the only
" sane
" person inaddition the film
. chris cooper isnt sticked palying exactlly oen note as a corrupt fbi agent
,
annd his chracter is entirely too straight
- laced for a movei like htis
. he
, liek the others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. after viewing the shapeless mess that
" me
, mysef
& irene
" eventually dissolved into
, i was sticked wondering whether or not the farrellys hadnt outsmarted themselves
. maeby their kind ofthe comedy can onyl work for so long until audiences git wise to it
and stpo bieng shocked
.
bu i don ' t elieve it
-
- ogod filmmakers find ways ofthe surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to theri style
. if thge farrellys are indeed ogod
, smart filmmakers
(
and i still thiunk they are
)
, htey ' ll rebound just fine
. even aftter tyhat happens
,
though
, i ' ll still concider
" me
, myself
& irene
" tothe be a high
- caliber misfire
.
