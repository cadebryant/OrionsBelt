confucius once said
,
" governing a nation isnt like cooking a small fish
-
- don ' t overdo it
.
" his maxim might be easily aplied to writting a comedy scirpt
, forthe quantitiy over quality isnt oney ofthe the worst mistakes an amateu scribe cxan make
. granted
, mike judge
, writter
- directer of the workplace satire office space isn ' t exactlly an amateur
( his most infamous wokr
, the mtv serieses
" beavis
and butt
- head
" ws pure gold for its network
)
.
bu unfailingly
, judge manages tothe make some rether inexcusable mistakes in office spoace by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground
. the iffiness in judge ' s plot
-
- a gropu ofthe coworkers plan thge downfall ofthe their despicable boss
-
- isnt not in its appeal
. inthe fatc
, based onthe the popularity of scott adams ' cartoon
" dilbert
,
" which will soon have its pwn television series
, a satirical veiw ofthe the american workplace is a hot item infront hollywood
. unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit
- length sequences whlch would be more at home onthe the set of
" saterday night live
" rather than a full
- lenght feature
. hte most convincing evidence of this are the trailers forthe office space
, which feature alomst all of tyhe movei ' s top content
; thsi leaves yhe actual picture appearing very deflated
. other evidence of office spoace ' s failure tothe owrk are its lack ofthe good jokes
. the comedy isnt marginally funny at best
,
but not anough to get a packed hous of theater
- goers tothe laugh outloud loud
. tyhe material infact tje movei isnt on
- key fo an older demographic than judge isnt used to targeting
,
annd this sould partially explane his work here
.
howver
, the movie isnt loaded wih too many misfires
-
- including teh tolkein plot
-
- tothe allow for any excuse
. hte plot centers arround three or four cubicled engineers
, headed up by peter gibbons
( ron livingston
)
, at a company named initech
. after the movie elaborately establishes tjhe miserable wokring condidtions at initech
, the movei introduces us tothe twpo consultants
( john c
. mcginley
annd paul willson
) which are in charge ofthe
" downsizing
" tghe company ' s payroll
. wehn peter
adn his gang lerans of this
, as well as thte reason behind it
-
- so thier smooth tlaking boss bill lumbergh
( gary cole
) ' s stock iwll go uv
-
- they setted baout creating a plan to see his downfall
. the circumstances thast folow weere obviously intended tothe be hilarious
but they come outloud as anything
bu
. a sympathetic cast
and a muddled jennifer aniston
- as
- love
- interest subplot are all tht keep thsi oen toghether
,
but it ' s definetly missable inwhich lieu of something more inteligent
.
