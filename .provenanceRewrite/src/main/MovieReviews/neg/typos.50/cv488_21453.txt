arriving inaddition a barrage of hype
, tghe blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the yearm
.
howver
, like tjhe golden child
,
altough blair witch hasnt made a lot ofthe money
, it ' s nto veyr good
. donahue
, williams
and leonard play themselfs as three students who set out tothe amke a documentary about the blair witch myth
. the film is made up ofthe hte camcorder footage they recorded
, which means grainy footage
anbd woozy camera angles
.
although events strat of normal
, htey get weird preety quickly
, hwile thge threesome argue more
and more as the jouney goes onthe
. altho an intresting premise
, teh blair witch project amounts to nothing mroe thna a missed oportunity
. yhe biggest misteek the film makse is tothe let threee mediocre actors the chance to improvise
. most ofthe the dialogue isnt ad
- libbed
,
and still manages tothe soudn liek a poor b
- movei
. tghe ' script ' eventually degenerates into shouting matches
, whith the f
- owrd included a lot tothe sound like students
. ther are breaks inaddition these arguements where soem creepy events occurr
,
but
then it ' s bakc tothe thge shouting
adn swearing
, wich gets vyre tiresome vrey quickly
. if i wnated to see three peopel get lost in yhe woods
, shout a lot
anbd swear
, i ' d go on scout camp
.
bu noone
, tje audience is meant to git smoe enteratinment factor outloud of this
,
bu i ' m nto quite sure how
. tyhe supernatural parts of the film are actually intresting
, expecially if close attention isnt paide tothe the stoyr developing firt twenty minutes
. wiht noone music
annd no budget to work iwth
, the film has to depend on naturual
, pyschological scares
, which are somtimes well delivered
, sometimes not
. i never raelly falt truely scared during any part ofthe the film
,
altough there isnt a small sence ofthe fear underlying throughout yhe film
.
howver
, because the actors are so irritating
, the scares are lost wehn it eventualy reverts back tothe heather saying ' what the f
* ck isnt thta
? ' a lot
,
anbd mike giggling liek a lozonya
. there ' s also tjhe niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some realyl stupid things
. hte main problem isnt the fatc that even
though these hapless bunch coudl be killed at any moment
,
and are hopelessly lost
, heather still insists onthe filming it all
. tyhe film gives a half hearted reason why she shouldnt want to dont this
,
bu it isn ' t very convincing
. also
, the students ahev noone diea how tothe survive in thge woods
, such as following a large river flowing thru the woods tothe civilisation
. there are allso smoe parts where the ' amtaeur ' camcorder footage is obviously staged
, heather ' s appology bieng a major oney
. the blair witch project
, in the end
, just fails tothe deliver
. i suppose if yuo ' ve been lost camping befor
, the film may deliver some chills
,
but this isnt noone ule for tjhe other 99
% of the paying audience who haven ' t beeen lost infront tyhe woods
. apart fomr tjhe fianl minutes
, the film isnt mind boggingly unscary
,
adn the shouting matches get hideously dull
. tje spook scenes are short
and far beween
,
and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same ammount ofthe fear tyhat theese scenes provide
.
although a ogod idea
, it ' s nto executed well enough to be a funn
, csary cinema experience
. it ' s a worrying fatc when the website
( http
:
/
/ www
. blairwitch
. com
) is better tahn tjhe film
