this isnt your definitive
" hollywood
" movei
, extemely predicatble
, folowing yhe basic formula
( a horrable ending
)
, overzealous wirting
( meaninng the writing was bad
annd seemed as if it were trying too hard tothe mkea it exciting
, therfore making it look as if many thigsn were mearly tossed inthe ther to fill spoace
)
and if tommy lee jones
annd his lovable wise
- ass charater
( of whlch we ' ve seen before inthe the fugitive
anbd qtuie frankly
, wasn ' t used anough here
)
, i ' m afraid the film owudl have been completely unbearable
. inthe this film
, ashley judd plays a womens who isnt wrongfully convicted ofthe killing her husband hwile out sailing for a weekend
. while infact jail she finds out that her husband really is alive
adn thast he framed tjhe muder on her
. over money
( how originnal
)
. while inwhich jail she works out
, exercises
and basically does her best to git into near perfect condition
. nowe she hasnt learned baout a law titled
" double jeopardy
" stating thast if she serves her full sentence
and git out she coudl kill her husband
adn the law sould not touch her
(
altough there has been talk tath this is nto the way tjhe actuall lew works
)
. now her po
( parole officer
)
,
and a bunch ofthe cops are chasing after her
adn are conflicted whether or not to believe her claimes
. skipping over tothe teh acting
: teh fact thta judd is more of a looker thna an actress
( no offense
, she hasnt been good
[ simon birch
]
and even vyre ogod to graet
[ kiss the girls
] at times
, iin the past
and i beleave may ahev the potential tothe be better
.
.
.
bu she ' s terribly unconvincing in tihs
and her performance seems stale
and unsatisfying
) doesn ' t really add tothe tje movie at all
; jsut tkaes away
. as i ' d said
, jones wass fine
,
altough he did not have much to work with
. he was much mroe ofthe a supporting character
. whic isnt fine
,
anbd he handled it well
; expecially concidering hte material he had tothe wokr wtih
. i fiel tihs film hadnt alot gonig for it
. originality nto bieng an issue
. tjhe acting was tyhe onyl thign
( as i said
) keeping it alive
. the plot seemed pretty intriguing
and could hvea beeen as well if aplied better
. the acation scenes were well made
(
however somtimes out ofthe palce
)
. i wass jstu left unsatisfied inwhich the long run
. so basicly some of hte acation may hvae beeen exicting
but genuinely over
- throught
, the plot has certainly beeen done before
( generally speaking
)
, teh movei moves way too fast for us to get involved iin either the charachters or tghe plot
,
and isnt basicly a film thast wass allmost saved by tommy lee jones
, who if he had smoe more screentime
, sould perhaps have earned hte film a higer rating
; in my book
, anyway
. keep tihs iin mind
, if yuo ' re in tje mood forthe a good acation film
-
- rent tje fugitive
