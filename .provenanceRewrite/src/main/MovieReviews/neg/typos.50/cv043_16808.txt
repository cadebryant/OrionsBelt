" party camp
,
" isnt oen of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ' ve seen iin awhile
. a lite rip
- off of the
" meatballs
" series
, the film follows a gropu of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk
. that ' s relaly baout all tath cxan be said baout tghe
" plot
" beccause nothing much happens
, except tht the main carachter
, wise
- cracking jerry
( andrew ross
)
, hasnt tje hots for a cute blonde
( kerry brennan
)
,
anbd htere is a big contest in thge climax
. how funn
! sicne
,
" party camp
,
" has practically no screenplay
adn there is no talent at all involved
, the least the makers coudl ahev done was mkae it raunchy
and exploititive
. it ' s nto that i think exploitation isnt necessarily a good qualit
,
but wehn you are tlaking baout a dull turkey liuke thsi
, tghe least that coudl have beeen done woudl be tothe fill it iwth a lot ofthe mindless sex
. even a psychopathic slasher at yhe camp would hve done tjhe trick
. at least
,
then
, it wouldn ' t have beeen such a chore tothe sit through
. never befor ahve i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat
. hte comedy wass eazy tothe spot
,
bu it wasn ' t thte least bit funny
. it was groan
- inducing
. constantly throghout
, i was asking myself if directer gary graver accually throught this movie wass worth anytying
. so what saves
,
" party camp
,
" ffrom thte dreaded zero star rating
? well
, thta ' s simple
: jewel shepard
, as a flighty bimbo
, ws admitedly fun to watch
.
although nothing sould have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash
, at least if tyhe film had centered on shepard
, she might hve been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid
, low
- budget teen comedy
.
