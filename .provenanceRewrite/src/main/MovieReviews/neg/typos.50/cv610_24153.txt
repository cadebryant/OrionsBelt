- thta yes
, there isnt an audience for this sort of thing
. ladies

, when executed wtih sytle
annd comic ingenuity
, jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel
(
` htere ' s something baout mary '
)
anbd a laxative
- induced attack of explosive diarrhea
(
` dumb
adn dumber '
) can be extremely funny

, nor is it bolstered by a scirpt tyhat accommodates hte viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired
.
` ready tothe rumble ' is builded aroud thte dedicated fan
- base ofthe professional wrestling
.
.
.
. which
, infact fact
, sounded like a fine consept forthe a goofball comedy
.
but director brian robbins
adn screenwrighter steven brill handcuff themselfs
,
and limited tothe a stampede of asinine
, humdrum bathroom humor
, basically the onyl hting they manaze is to evoke memories ofthe pauly shore

` bio dome '
. gordie boggs
( david arquette
)
and sean dawkins
( scott caan
) take pride inthe being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics
. by day
, they transport raw sewage
. by inght
( particularly onthe
? nitro ' monday
)
, they pay homage to their personal hero
anbd savior
- jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
, tjhe undisputed leader ofthe tjhe professional wrestling comunity
. with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance
, gordie

) pummel thge king inot tghe tarp
, therby dethroning the dignified wrestler

` rumble ' is nothing
but a sloppy
, frightfully unfunny swamp land ofthe misbegotten retardation
. the firt half
- hour is the ultimate test of paitience
. luckly
, thge simple
- minded events pik up steam
, partciularly wtih the well
- choreographed wrestling acation
. director robbins showed a knack for capturing teh brutality
and excitment of ootball inwhich
` varsity blues '
,
and whn inwhich tghe ring
, he doesnt proffesional work
.
bu the violentce is too eccessive
. having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories ofthe owen hart ' s tradgic accident jstu lsat yearm
, especially whith oen carachter ' s dive druing a cage match
. thsi is not something you whant a comedy tothe be reminsicent of
. outside tje wrestling action
, hte lewd jokes
anbd puerile sight gags bring new meaninng to yhe term
? scattershot '
, while the dialogue fluctuates inspite onthe the vulgarity scale of 1 tothe 10
, iwth brill ' s exstensive vocabulary ranging ffrom
` diddly ' to
` boob '
annd so onthe

: i chuckled a few times
, groaned a lot
,
adn indulged infront noe spirited belly laff involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights preety impressively forthe 105
. casting
- wise
,
` ready to rumble ' isnt an odd duck
. oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure
? he ' s perhaps a bit chunky
,
bu fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him
` fatty '
, whic dampens tyhe blow i suppose
. rose mcgowan isnt fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader
(
` the nirto

,
but extra pep isnt added wih appearences by wrestlers goldberg
