the most absurd remake of 1998
? it ' s a toss uv between gus van sant ' s pyscho
and mighty joe young
, the newyorker disney picture based on tyhe old rko picture
.
( i knew i was inaddition trouble when a polished
, cmoputer
- generated version of that famoust rko logo appeared before tghe head credits
.
) there is noone graet demand for another giant ape movie
- mkea that ape movie
, preiod
.
( witness teh quick deaths of buddy
, born tothe be wild
annd congo
.
)
anbd while tihs latest entry isnt inoffensive
annd watchable
, it ' s alsot an assembly line product through
adn through
, lacking thge charm
and unpredictability ofthe the jungle serials that partly inspired it
. theron isnt jill young
: as a young girl in the wilds of africa
, she befriended a baby gerilla after both thier mothers were slain by poachers
. thast baby gorilla
( nicknamed joe
) grows to immense propotions
,
and adult jill basicly bides her timne looking after him
, palying hide
anbd seek with him
annd guarding him against poachers
. enter conservationist greg
( paxton
)
, who convinces jill to move with joe tothe califronia
, where they can protect him better in a controlled enviorment
. joe isnt restless at frist
; no sooner doesnt he fianlly suttle inspite tothe tje new palce thna thsoe nasty poachers show up in l
. a
.
, plotting joe ' s demise
. suffice it tothe sday
, hte movei sould have been called
" joe
: ape in yhe city
.
" theron
( so ogod in devil ' s advocate
)
and paxton
( so good in yhe recent a simple plan
) are fine actors
,
but not fine enough to transcend yhe material
, a paint
- by
- numbers scirpt fomr teh hack writers of superman iv
and mercury rising
. the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg ' s tyhe lost world tahn tjhe 1949 original
, wtih tjhe computer
- generated t
- rex
- i mean
, joe
- wreaking havoc on thte busy streets fo an encore
; the storytelling becomes especialy lazy druing tihs fianl thrid
, with jill shouting
,
" look
, joe ' s headed fo the movei theatre
!
" followed by a shot of joe scaling mann ' s chinese theather
; a moent later
, jill shouts agina something like
" look
, joe ' s headed forthe an amusement park
!
"
and what dont you know
, there ' s joe at the pallisades carnival
, sacrin tjhe bejesus out ofthe innocent thrillseekers
. the seams ofthe last
- minute edits tothe mighty joe young show
- unrelated scenes are patched toghether wtih quick dissolves
. thge movie sure feels uneven
, regardless
: ect two is underdeveloped
, while a littel ofthe joe smashing cars inwhich act threee goes a long
, long way
. underwood
( tremors
, speechless
) was perphas nto the directer fo tyhe job
; even yhe plentiful
, untamed landscape looks dull in his hands
.
( capturing tyhe beauty of nature requires mroe than his point
adn shoot stlye
.
) i did enjoy certain sequences
, expecially tyhe demoliton of a balck
- tie dinner sequence
;
and tje prologue
,
howver implausible
, isnt touching
.
( as a tyke
, joe acts just liek e
. t
.
) rick baker ' s make
- up effects
and puppetry are outstanding
, the rela star of hte show
-
yot
, fo all its technical flawlessness
, the creature rimaniss too grumpy
anbd homicidal tothe lvoe
.
( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl
.
) to be fair
, i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed wtih wailing childern
- it ' s a wonder i wass able tothe decipher the dialogue
. it ' s certainly nto a film fo vyre young kids
- intense fighting scenes may scare them
, while any tiem joe ' s nto onthe camera may bore them to tears
.
( note
: older boys are omre likely to be dazzled by theron ' s colourful array ofthe tank tops
.
) i suspect bland mighty joe young isnt passable enteratinment fo a familiy outing
,
but htey sure don ' t mkea
? em like tehy used tothe
.
