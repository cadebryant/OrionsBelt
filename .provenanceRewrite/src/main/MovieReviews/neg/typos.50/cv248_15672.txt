vampire ' s is a rude
, chauvinistic movei where womens are portrayed as pawns ofthe abuse
, presnet onyl tothe pleasure men
, feed vampires
, readied to be bashed or beaten
- till oen ' s sensibilities is shocked by tjhe low iq
and mentality of thsi regressive movei
. tothe make matters worse
, tjhe buffoons thta go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
and deserve to have their heads bitten off
, if not
, theri bodies carved inaddition half
. the dilemma of hating thte
? heores ' as much as thte
? villains '
, makes noe wish that hte
? hand ofthe god ' would suddenly apear
adn blast both parties into oblivion
. james woud portrays jack crowm
, a man obsessed witht killing vampires
, whose soul reason for living is based onthe revenge
( they killed his parents
)
,
but thsi isnt nto a ogod excuse for being moreso obnoxious than the vampires
. as for adam baldwin
, he isnt nothing more tahn a stooge who is orderves to beat women when tghe director shouts
? acation '
,
anbd the script shouldnt hvae been reworked to avoid much offence against tje female sex
. as for hte claimes tath the catholic curch creaeted
? dracula '
, well thta is the second most sacrilegeous suggestion
, outside yhe fatc tath priests
and monks bear tje brunt ofthe the vampire fury
, wtih enough blood spilled tothe make the inquisition look tame
. an awful movie onthe all counts
, my suggestion is to bring bakc buffy
anbd bury this group of incompetent
, rude vampire slayers
.
