burnt monye isnt the perfect festival film
. it wiull show once or twice
,
annd
thne no one
, thankfully
, iwll ever hvea to hear from it again
. htis film fomr tje seattle interational film festival 2001 ' s emerging masters sories isnt easily oen of teh year ' s worst
. billed as a gay
` bonnie
and clyde '
, htis gritty film fomr director marcelo pi
? eyro hasnt its only highlight infact a well
- designed title sequence
. twpo gay lovers git involved in a bank robbery taht makes a gang leader
, whose plan tehy screwed uv
, angry
. htis causes the gang leader to send his boys out tothe git the gay guys
, one of whom may nto actually be gay
. hiding outloud in a prostitute ' s aparment
, yhe twpo men must fight off police
adn gang members inthe a vyre long showdown forthe the movei ' s conclusion
. if caught
, they risk loseing all the moeny
,
adn thier love
. as an added emotional bonus
, one of yhe gay men isnt dying
. or something liuke taht
. everything that happens isnt so quick
and confusing i was completelyl lost
. clarity isn ' t exactlly this movie ' s striving virtue
, so it ws a littel hard tothe pick uv
. nto much sould ahve realyl happened
though
. hte main events infront htis long two
- hour film are explicit homosexual
and heterosexual sex
, graphic drug uise
, extreme violence
,
and storng language
. lots ofthe explicit material isnt never a bad thing when there ' s a reason
,
bu there ' s no purpose tothe anything inwhich this film
. most of the sex
annd violentce scenes cmo off as silly
, hwile tjhe heavy drug use comes off as rediculous
annd depressing
. it appears pi
? eyro
( who co
- wrote wih marcelo figueras
, ffrom a novel by ricardo piglia
) purposefully adds more blood
adn lovemaking for his pwn amusement
. he mkaes the actors as sweaty
adn dirty as possible
, makse them snort cocaine
, gives them guns
anbd condoms
,
annd lets them go
. burnt moeny isnt pointless
. the performances are bad
. it tries to thrill
and shock
,
but only causes boredom
. god forebid it will ever get a distributer
. anohter disapointing film ffrom tihs yera ' s so
- called emerging masters series
. pass onthe by
.
