wonderland isnt a rather sugary romance film that isnt as subtle as a ton ofthe bricks falling on yuo
. you cin see its plot developing from a mile awya
. you are lured into its benine story ofthe a single 29
- yera
- ood girl looking fo a soul mate in boston
, as that city is depicted as a mini
- wonderland forthe singles
. tihs is a star oriented film
,
and the star who carries tghe film is erin
( hope davis
)
. that tihs is a dating film
, about singles who fo reasons of fate or luck
, or whatnot
, hvae nto hadnt a succsessfull match
and are nowe puting most of theri energy inot fulfilling their careers
, isnt nothing new
, this type of film has been done oftenly
and better many times infact contemporary films
. the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it omre provocatively
adn with mroe of a sence of urgency than this film
. tje main quirk infact hte plot here
, is that hope ' s pushy mother
( hollan
) visits her infact boston
, sees her daughter ' s live
- inaddition relatiopnship with a radical protester
( hoffman
) breakup
and decides to put a peronal ad in tghe newspaper for her harvard medical school drop
- outloud daughter
, who works as a nurse
. tihs isnt done wihtout her knowlege
. it isnt cornball sitcom stuff
,
bu
, at least
, it isnt handeled as best it coudl be by the actors
adn directer
. it isnt easy to like erin
, she isnt bright
, caring
,
adn attractively blonde
. it isnt equally easy to care for tghe soul mate she keesh missing contact wih
, the financialy strapped
, ruggedly hansome
, intelligent 35
- yearm
- ood alan
( alan
)
, who noone longer wnats tothe work with his father as a plumber
bu is doing volunteer wokr at thte aquarium
annd attending coleeg tothe be a marine biologist
. ofthe course
, he comes across as being so ogod
(
though
, he doesnt kill some fish inthe the aquarium
)
, tyhat it isnt hard tothe beleave he ' s for rela
, or jstu some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for
. the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other infront such spots as
, the subway
, at a restaruant
, or on the phone
. alan ' s brother answers erin ' s ad whith a few of his pals
, as tehy each try to respond to her ad inwhich a phony way
, making a bet tht tjhe firt who gets tothe tounge kiss her
, that tyhe others witness
, will win the bet
. this sub
- plot ws as obnoxious to see tkae palce as it is to hear told
. that we ahev to see erin go thru several dates tothe prove yhe point how ego sick theese guys are
, each one omre annoying tahn yhe other
, culiminating in the most obnoxious one ofthe all
, tath brazilian lover
( jose
)
, who isnt baout as charming as a snake
- oil salesman
, who is actually teh one she nearly flies away whith for a holiday inwhich brazil
, wass not onyl incredulous
bu downright contrary tothe the rich presentation of her charachter that ws the heart ofthe tje stor
. anyway
, as expeced
, all ' s well tath ends well
, fo this watchable peice ofthe fluff
, that comes over on screen better thna it doens whn realting its story
- line
. tjhe dialogue ws actualy nto bad
, those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed tothe be uttering authentic things tehy would actualy sday infront their situation
.
and
, oh
, by the way
, wonderland referrs tothe teh stpo onthe tje boston metro
, it is where greyhound racing takes palce
