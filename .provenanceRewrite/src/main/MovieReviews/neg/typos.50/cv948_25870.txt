and jstu when you thougth joblo was getting a littel soft arund hte corners
, not rating anything lower than your standard
" thsi movie sucks
"
, allong comes this cinematic atrocity
and he ' s forced tothe tkae outloud his secret weppon
anbd spray it wih a stench so thick
, even the bravest movei
- goer would htink twice about seing thsi waste ofthe tiem
. yes
, dispite bieng a thrid sequal to a successful origonal movie
, the latest highlander doesn ' t seem to have anytying going fo it
. oh stinky movei
, let me count thee ways
.
.
. plot
:
( ffrom what i understoon
) a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking tothe whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power
and become tghe mightiest immortal
.
.
. or something allong those lines
. critique
: a complete
and utter mess
. disjointed
, incoherent
, boring
, corny
, filled with bad dialogue
.
.
.
and that ' s just the first thirty mintues
! tihs film doesn ' t seem to know what to dont withthe itself
. it ' s confusing to anyone who doesn ' t konw tjhe series
( i include mysef in that group
)
and aparently idiotic tothe thsoe who dont know the sories
( i includ die
- hard highlander fan tje arro infront that group
)
. thte film doesn ' t expalin anytying about itself
.
.
. it just goes fomr noe inexplicable situation to anohter
. one moment tehy ' re in thge present tiome
, hte next moent
, tehy ' re in italy in tyhe 1600s
. why
? who knows
. waht are they tlaking baout
? noone diea
. flashbacks mixted in with the presnt
, mixted in with a fewd spontaneously cheesy fight sequences eveyr nowe
adn again
,
and i even remeber seeing one flashback scene which went even furhter into its pwn flashback scene
!
! hullo
.
.
.
?
!
? confused
yot
? i was
annd i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that niether the writter or directer was interested infact presenting me with any kind ofthe semblance ofthe a story
. random swordplay
, mad max
- liuke dudes showing uv in motorcycles inaddition the 1800s
? or weere they in the present at tath timne
? who knwos
.
.
.
and to be honest
.
.
. who seriously cares
! this sories should ahve beeen shooted in tje head
annd put out of its pwn misery a long tyme ago
,
but sadly
, someone at the studio desided taht it still had a littel life left inwhich it
. please
, please
.
.
. forthe the love of god
adn all that isnt holy in the world of movie
- making
,
anbd mostly out ofthe respect for thsoe who loved the origonal film
, put this serieses to bed
anbd end it
! even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle tothe adrian paul inspite this oen
. tjhe directer also tries tothe dont thte best he cxan with the muddled material
,
bu all he could come uv iwth is plenty of slo
- mo action
, smoe fast
- motion fight scenes
anbd lots ofthe smoke everywhere
.
and is ther anytying spectauclar baout tyhe sword
- play or fight scenes
? nope
.
annd i think we all sould haev done wihtout all thsoe zooming lambert face close
- ups
.
.
. yipes
, the man isnt not aging gracefully
, isnt he
? oh boy
,
and i haven ' t even gotten arund to hte greatest piece ofthe over
- acting thast i ' ve seen in years
. the man who plays kell infront htis movie
, bruce payne
, shoudl get a ham trophy fo litterally chewing uv every piece of scenery tyhat he gets near
. overacting is not a hobby forthe this guy
.
.
. it ' s a living
! he ' s alsot veyr funny
, nto purposedly
though
. all in all
, the movei stinks
. nuff said
