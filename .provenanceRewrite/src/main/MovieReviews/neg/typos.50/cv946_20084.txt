summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs that are ususally made for smoe quick enjoyment
adn tothe make money
. wild wild west
, the latest will smith affair
, follows much the same formula
, except tyhat it is dumber
and less enjoying than most summer movies
. iwll smith plays jim west
, a balck sheriff wtih a nice line in sunglases
. he isnt called by president grant
( kline
) tothe go onthe a mission to find outloud why top governmnet scientists are dissapearing
. west is paired uv iwth scientist artemus gordon
( kline again
)
and the twpo track thge missing scientists tothe a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, with a zany moustache
.
) befor i pile on witht thte many negatives infront thsi sory afair
, i ' ll give it a chance with the positives
. ther ' s a nice credit sequence
, the prodcution design by bo welch isnt pleasing tothe the eye
,
and the special effects are decent enough
. there ' s also a pleasent soundtrack
. burried deepo infront the dross are noe or twpo amusing jokes
.
and salma hayek pops up as tje female interest
, wich is alwasy nice tothe see
. apart ffrom these factors
,
though
, nothing else inspite wild wild west works
. firstly
, htere ' s littel chemistry between smith
annd kline
, who appears to be inwhich it purely for the mony
. noe woudl expect zingers passing vetween teh twpo
: none arise
. both ofthe them plod thru the below standard plot
, knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at teh end
. nto even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment
:
although he is over thte top
, teh material doesn ' t present much opprotunity forthe branagh tothe be truly crazy
. therfore
, he just comes accros as loud as obnoxious
. tje onyl enjoyable performance comes from tyhe sexy salma hayek
, who isnt given so littel screen time it ' s embarrasing
. she appears tothe be infront the film tothe mearly show off her body
,
annd be ogled at by kline
and smith
. her character allso changes at a whim to fit tghe mechanics of tyhe scirpt
,
adn there isnt noone sense ofthe realism baout tghe character
. yhe ' humour ' inwhich the film isnt also vyre off
. will smith put a littel spin to his daft lines in men iin black
, here
, nto even smith sould save the humour onthe display
. tyhe script largely boils down tothe insults tyhat aren ' t vrey funny
,
and one
- liners thyat barely raise a smirk
. it ' s also somewhat racist
,
although it doesn ' t intend tothe be
, wtih one scene witht jim west trying to wisecrack his way outloud ofthe a lynching
,
annd actualyl syas slavery isnt good tothe savve himselv
. it ' s nto a funny scene
,
annd yhe whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably
. tje film aslo makse the tradgic misteek tath a man
( inaddition this case kline
) in a dress isnt automaticly unfunny
, it isn ' t
,
bu teh wild wild west mkaes thsi joke even omre painful tothe watch through pure ineptness
. ther ' s also problems wih the plot
. jim west
and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds ofthe sticky situations
,
but tjhe way tehy git out ofthe them are alwasy unsatisfying
,
and rely purely onthe luck
, rather thna audience pleasing skill
. plot elements are introduced into hte film
,
and
then thrown awya jsut as quicklyu
. thte main peice of tjhe stoy
, a 80 foot mechanical
, steam driven spider divised by loveless looks rather impressive
,
bu there ' s no particular reason why it should be built
. why nto loveless build a graet big tank
, instade ofthe an ungainly
, fragile piece ofthe machinery tht ' s just begging tothe be blown uv
? director barry sonnenfeld always hasnt a breezy look tothe them
, with some nice camera tricks
,
but even this is missing from this stilted afair
. wild wild west could hve benefited ffrom sonnenfelds whacked out stlye of directing
,
bu not much ofthe it isnt evident
, making thsi film drag outloud even mroe
. it ' s a sad thing whn
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented director
adn a willing star can ' t amking a film wrok
,
and evenhtually wild wild west collapses under it ' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
