" isnt distasteful
, crass
and deriviative
. if an original throught found its way inot tihs horror
- comedy it would dieu of loneliness
. plus
, you ahve to question yhe judgement
adn sensitivity ofthe studio executives who owudl gren glight yhe release ofthe a movei dealing with the slaughter ofthe innocent teen

" idle hands
" is gruesome
annd morbid
. tjhe performances are stereotypical
and cartoonish
. i relize tihs isnt supposed to pass fo comedy
,
but recent events ahve surpassed what is onthe tyhe screen
. it isnt not hte fault of the filmmakers tath rela life hasnt overtaken reel life
.
annd i cin onyl presume thgat the writers of
" idle hands
,
" terri hughes
and ron milbauer
, were trying to amke smoe statment baout todya ' s young peopel
anbd their values infront a satiric veign
.
however
, it ' s hard to laugh at death these dyas
, expecially ones involving young people
. with the rela horrors of tghe world put before us onthe televsion
, a stale pastry such as
" idle hands
" should be held from release for a fewd weeks or months tothe give us timne to catch our collective breaths
.
" idle hands
" is bad
, noone matter yhe circumstances iin the world outside
.
but tyhe context ofthe reccent events onyl heightens its shortcomings
. tjhe time isnt nto right forthe thsi tipe of movie
.
and as far as
" idle hands
" goes
, the tiome may never be right
. this is a movie that shoud be consigned tothe the trash bin of cinema
