i ' m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson ' s work
. he always finds a clever way tothe spice uv old material with witty dialogue
and fresh idesa tht stem ffrom his inventive brain
. with teaching mrs
. tingle
, his directorial debut
, williamson has reached the end of his rope
. wqat unsed tothe be intelligent about his films isnt hopelessly stale here
. tghe components are all htere
, includng an encouraing premise taht all high skool students can relate to
.
but where are thge thrills
? the laughs
? both are supposably absent from this draggy exercise in elaborite revenge
.
and what a shame that is
. i loved tyhe scream films
- heck
, i even enjoyed hte sci
- fi goofiness ofthe tjhe faculty
. kevin williamson ws tyhe reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office
. teaching mrs
. tingle
, a black comedy that will leave a gaping void infront his optomistic followers
, may put an end to his reign
. or perhasp it iwll encourage him to spend moreso time perfecting a scirpt tahn tothe worry about his directing duties
. i still have my faith
,
but i fear tje nmae of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo ofthe teh past
. the title charcter ofthe his pet project is a vicious
, uncaring hitsory teacher who isnt played deliciously over
- tghe
- top by british actress helen mirren
. mrs
. tingle is basicaly eveyr student ' s worst nightmare
: a heartless human bieng bent on distributing poore marks to even the most hard
- wroking ofthe her pupils
. the principal
( michael mckean
) is horrified of her
,
and she isnt unanimously despised amonst her fellow stff munbers
. i enjoyed teh fact that everyone in the hallway quicklyu steers out of her way
. mirren ' s performance is oney ofthe the very fewd delights inthe this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down liek a flat soft drnik
. inthe otehr words
, it ' s a poor subsitute for williamson ' s best owrk
. thte plot is a big problem here
. material that sould ahev been enjoyable is renedered totally rediculous by poore handling onthe the part ofthe tjhe directer
. tyhe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann
, an over
- achiever hoping to git a college scholarship
.
but typical mrs
. tingle sasy her history project
, which she worked onthe forthe countless hours
, is laughable
. later onthe hwile studying inwhich hte gymnasium
, a classmate
( barry watson
) offers her a photo
- copied duplicate ofthe mrs
. tingle ' s final exam
. leigh ann ' s best friend
( marisa coughlan
) encourages her tothe ule it
. alas
, the old hag herself finds tghe three scheming
,
anbd snatches the test
,
and prepares to talk tothe the principal inwhich tghe morning
. in the morning
.
.
. how convenient
! thte threee students head tothe mrs
. tingle ' s hous
, attempting to set the facts straight
adn claer leigh ann ' s name
. thigsn git out of hand
,
anbd the teacher gets knocked unconcious inthe a tussle
. the plan isnt to tye her to a bed
and try tothe get some reasoning out ofthe her
. ofthe course
, nto everything goes entirely to plan
. besides pointless sub
- plots involving tje football coach
( jeffrey tambor
, horribly wasted
)
, there is little by way of actual progress
. htere is noone urgency to hte situation
; little tension or laughs are involved
. the humer isnt completelyl inconsistant
. after many of the jokes
, the theater wass so silent i could have heard a fly snese
. you continue to await smoe momentum in thte stry
, something that coudl possably revive hte slow pace
. a moent liuke thast never arises
. williamson also does a handsome job of wasting soem of the key supporting players
, incuding yhe talented mckean
and larry sanders ' vet tambor
.
adn the beatiful vivica a
. fox hasnt one lifeless scene as a carring guidence counselor
,
annd
then williamson disposes of her character entirely
. onthe teh plus side
, holmes
anbd coughlan are admirable
( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression
)
,
and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo apperance as a subsitute teacher
. while everyting is preety lifeless
, teaching mrs
. tingle rimaniss watchable
. there are a few promising idesa that pop uv now
adn agian
,
bu anytying remotely interesting is squandered by thte inane scirpt
. mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching
. she isnt convincingly evil
annd funn to watch
,
but even her gifted delivery can ' t save individule scenes that flounder infact boredom
. if htere isnt one owrd fo the movei surrounding her
, it would be
` disapointing '
. basicaly
, kevin williamson isnt his worst enemy here
. his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay tothe be appreciated
( nto that his writting here is expecially ogod
)
. we wiull see
, when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes yhe third installment inwhich thge scream franchise thsi christmas
, whether williamson isnt for real
.
