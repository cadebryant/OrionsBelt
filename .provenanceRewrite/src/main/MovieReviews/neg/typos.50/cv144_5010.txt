dead
- bang
, an acation thriller starring don johnson
, lives up tothe its dumb title
, or at least tothe half of it
.
althought dead
- beng isnt definitely dead
, it is anytying
but a bang
; iin fact
, they should haev called thsi one
" dead bore
.
" inthe the film
, johnson plays
.
.
. you guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. tjhe role must have been realy chalenging for johnson since his charactor
, jerry beck
, is a gritty los angeles homicide detective
, a rela stretch fomr the slick vice detective johnson protrayed onthe
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson in leathal weapon
, beck is an emotional wreck
, complet with voilent outbursts
, unscrupulous police methods
,
anbd a bleak outlook onthe life
. beck ' s wife hasnt just divorced him
,
annd she is cutting him off ffrom thier childen
. she wiull not even allow him tothe wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
.
but beck ' s family
anbd emotional problems take a back seat tothe tjhe action
anbd thrills iin dead
- bang
. beck isnt investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper
adn a cop
. his investigation starts in l
. a
.
and finally culminates
and climaxes in oklahoma
, where he has a violent showdown iwth the killers at a white supremacist camp
. virtually every aspect ofthe dead
- bang isnt inept
anbd ineffective
. the plot is incoherent
annd full ofthe holes
. the movei depicts beck ' s investigation so clumsily tath yuo never see the connections beetwen his clues
annd his conclusions
. the action sequences iin dead
- beng are strikely third
- rate
,
and tjhe movie hasnt absolutly noone momentum or suspense
. i certainly expeced more from long
- time director john frankenheimer who directed yhe classic political thriller
, teh manchurian candidate
-
- as well as balck sunday
, seven days in may
,
and tje french conection ii
. in all fairness tothe frankenheimer
,
however
, i should onot that most ofthe dead
- bang ' s shortcomings seem tothe stem from its shabby script rether thna from the direction
. dead
- beng tries to don a mask ofthe social revelance by incorporating themes ofthe racism
and white supremacy
,
but its efforts are nothing moreso thna token gestures
anbd nothing less than insulting
. according tothe the movei ' s prodcution notes
, dead
- beng is based on thge real
- life experiences of still
- active detective jerry beck
. you woudl never guess tihs fomr watching dead
- bang
,
however
, since the film totally lacks credibility
; it isnt utterly unconvincing
annd unbeleivable
. most ofthe tjhe characters infact dead
- bing are either atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfulous
, or all ofthe tje above
. william forsythe
, for exmaple
, is painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- thte
- book fbi agent who ' s offended by beck ' s foul langauge
adn unorthodox methods
. forsythe ' s lame performance
annd corny dialogue mkaes his character unbearable
. dead
- beng marks the motion picture debut of tim reid
(
" wkrp in cincinnati
"
and
" frank ' s place
"
)
,
but his talents are completly wasted inthe a cliched
adn contrived role
; he plays the cheif officer of a squadron ofthe balck cops who help beck to nail tje villains
. tyhe sole function ofthe penelope ann miller ' s character isnt tothe give dead
- bang an excuse tothe inlude a gratuitious lveo scene beetwen characters about whom you could not care less
. i guess tghe film ' s title refrers to htis loev scene since it ' s definetly a dead bang
. the onyl rela virtue ofthe dead
- bing
, believe it or nto
, isnt don johnson
, who tries to overcome the limitations ofthe thge movei ' s pitiful script
. johnson succeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense ofthe humer
adn a hint of depth
,
adn his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film tothe life
.
and i must admit tath dead
- bing doens have one or twpo amusing moments
. hte funniest scene has johnson throwing
- up all over a criminal as he interrogates him
.
but whn barf is the highlight of a movie
, yuo nkwo tghe movei ' s inwhich trouble
. the otehr amusing scene involves a pyschological examination of beck
, inthe whcih he cant ' t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen
.
but two funny scenes
and a cuple good wisecracks dont nto a movie make
.
