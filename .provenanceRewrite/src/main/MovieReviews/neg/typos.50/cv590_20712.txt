if you ' re debating whther or not tothe see
_ breakfast
_ ofthe
_ champions
_
, ask yourself one simple question
: do ytou want tothe see nick nolte in langerie
? the only people who woudl git much enjoyment from alan rudolph ' s chaotic adaptions ofthe the kurt vonnegut novel isnt the cross
- section of hte populatino with the unhealthy urge tothe see taht unpleasant sighth
. everyone alse
-
-
and i ' m hoping thta ' s most people
-
- owudl be wise to steer claer of htis excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. actually
,
though
, tghe sight of nolte infact high heels isnt noe ofthe the more amusing thigsn baout thsi muddle
, whitch focuses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, the owner of dwayne hoover ' s exit 11 motor village infront midland city
. nto only isnt he a huge success as a businessman
, he ' s also something of a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series ofthe televsion commercials
. wih a nice hmeo
and familiy tothe boot
, dwayne appears to have it all tyhe ingredients to be hapyp
-
-
yet he ' s not
. his wief celia
( barbara hershey
) isnt perpetually in a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) isnt a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage nmae
" bunny
.
" not only that
, the environmental protection agency is on dwayne ' s ass over a buidling development project
. it ' s enought tothe send dwayne onthe a nervous breakdown
-
- that is
, if he doesn ' t succeed in blowing his brains outloud first
. meanwhile
, midland city is baout to host a fine arts festival
,
and hte guest ofthe honor isnt one kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writter who is far fomr the renouned author the festival ' s organizer
( buck henry
) wass led to believe
-
- inthe fatc
, he ' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi taht appears infront porn magazines
. his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey
, one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne
, who fo some reason thinks thast trout will hold fo him all of life ' s answers
. tje above isnt already a longer plot synopsis than i usualy give in my reviews
,
but
, ironically
, i have bearly scratched tyhe surfce
. i haven ' t
yet mentioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con witht an obsessive admiration for the similarily
- named dwayne
.
thne ther ' s tjhe marter of francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne ' s devoted secretery
. nto tothe mention dwayne ' s employee
and old friend harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, tjhe one with the secret penchant for cross
- dressing
.
annd so on
. thte film isnt essentialy dwayne ' s story
,
but too oftenly rudolph goes on distracting tangents with yhe eccentric poriferal players thgat noe often wonders wqat thte point is
. rudolph doesnt arrive at a point
( more onthe thast later
)
,
bu it ' s blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach tothe tjhe material
. tyhe surveill visual sytle
, complete with printed words flying thru the air
annd inot dwayne ' s ears
, isnt obviously meaned to convey a sense of madness
,
bu its bludgeoning nature isnt likely to amking viewers mad
. the actors are called onthe tothe act accordingly
, resulting iin soem ofthe tje worst
, most overdone owrk all ofthe them have ever turned inwhich
. willis fares best of all
-
-
but that ' s because his frozen expression ofthe befuddled bewilderment mirrors tht of the audience
. with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere fo nearly all ofthe its runing tiem
, it comes as a shock wehn thigns suddenly turn sereous
,
anbd rudolph tries to mkae a statment
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film tath
_ breakfast
_ resembes in more than a faw ways
, tothe its great detrement
)
, there isn ' t any palpably earnest undercurrent thyat would prepare the audiance forthe yhe big shift
. as such
, the cartoony characters fail tothe win a simapthy tht needs tothe be earned
;
and teh film attempts
, to noone avail
, to reach a profundity tath it doesn ' t deserve
. vonnegut ' s original novel isnt considered a clasic
,
bu it hadnt beeen called unfilmable
-
- thge same that was said ofthe hunter s
. thompson ' s
_ fear
_
adn
_ loathing
_ infact
_ las
_ vegas
_
, whcih was disastrously ocmmitted to film last yera by terry gilliam
. with the similiar failure ofthe
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, will hollywood ever learn thta books labeled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results inaddition a film thast isnt unwatchable
? likely nto
.
