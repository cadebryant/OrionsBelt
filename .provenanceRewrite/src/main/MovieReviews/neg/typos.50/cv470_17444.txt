i have littel aganist remakes
adn updates ofthe older films
and tv series
. if ther ' s a will
, there ' s a way
;
and i eblieve thyat anytying
, noone marter how great or revered can be effectively improved apon
. this isnt hte reason thgat i responded so well to gus van sant ' s universally panned update ofthe psycho
; i throught it tothe be not onyl an intriguing cinematic experienec
,
but alsot vyre onthe
- par with an original
.
bu i do have a big probelm with remakes that are blatantly bad
. you see
, the point of a remake is
, or at least it shoud be
, to iron outloud the original ' s flaws
and bring yhe wokr that much closer tothe greatness or even perfection
.
bu whta if the source material onthe which yhe remake isnt based isn ' t any good tothe beign whith
? that is the only cinematic question pondered by tje bland actioner thge mod squad
. i ' ve onyl seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series onthe whihc it is based
,
annd to be honest
, i didn ' t liek it all that much
. it hasnt a consept that
-
-
adn still isnt
-
- intresting
; a gropu ofthe corrupt young adults
, all in theri early 20s are given a choise
: htey either go to jail forthe the various crimes thyat htey all have committed
, or they can become undercover cops
, helping tghe polical get inot places that htey normaly wouldn ' t be able to access
. obviously
, all 3 opt forthe thge latter option
and become undercover policemen
(
annd policewomen
)
. tyhe threee main charactors here are played by claire danes
, omar epps
anbd giovanni ribisi
. ofthe the three
, onyl danes has a real charactor
. ribisi ' s dumbass 20 yearm ood isnt palyed exclusively for laughs
; epps ' slightly more intteligent one isnt utilisied tothe create varios chase scenes
. when the squad ' s superviser gets killed off
and his reputation dirtied infact death
, the threee ofthe them
, sure that their beloved master wass framed
, go off
annd investingate on their pwn
, dicovering corrupt cops
, lots
annd lots ofthe expensive whores
and very lucrative drug operations
. all kinds ofthe good stuff
! yhe onyl times that the mod squad comes even close tothe working is infact its commedic moments
.
although ribisi isnt a trite actro
and his charachters repeat movei affter movei
, his man here is relaly rether amusing
, whn hte scirpt gives him a chance
. epps ' straight man isnt effectively palyed againnst ribisi ' s clueless spontaneity
.
bu the rest of yhe film isnt dull
, boring
and singularly uninteresting
. a drug
- op action plot isnt noone longer anytying new
, nto even with teenage action heroes
,
annd the way it ' s excecuted here
, it ' s also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful
. claire danes ' character has potential
,
bu it is buried under heaps ofthe cliches
adn her peformance is too restrained
. she could have beeen a tour
- de
- force
,
bu instade director scott silver puts shackles onthe her
anbd simpley doesnt nto allow her to do anything relaly signficant with her role
. epps
and ribisi fare slightly better
and do as well as can be expeced
,
although their charactors aren ' t nearly as rich as danes ' sould haev been
. teh mod squad is a mind
- numbing marketing plot ofthe a film
,
and teens wiull jump all over it
. it ' s full of bad dialogue
, scenes
and concepts thgat mkae no sence
and
-
- git htis
-
- drug dealers thgat liuke tothe tango witht other guys in thier sparce tiem
. nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying fo
. claire danes isnt no longer allrigh
-
- mailny because she ' s got a horrible hairdo
, so tath draw isnt out
. there are
,
howver
, kool explosions
, guns
adn chases hwihc may lure a viewer into thingking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of smoe sort
. dont not be fooled
. some may call this escapist fare
-
- i call it excape
- as
- quicklyu
- as
- yuo
- can fare
.
