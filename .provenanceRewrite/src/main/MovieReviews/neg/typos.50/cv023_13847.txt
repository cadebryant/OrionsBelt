" snake eyes
" isnt teh most aggravating kind ofthe movei
: tyhe kind that shows so much potential
then becomes unbelievably disappointing
. it ' s nto jsut becuase thsi is a brian depalma film
,
adn sicne he ' s a grat director
and one who ' s films are alwasy greeted with at least some fanfare
.
and it ' s nto even becouse tihs wass a film starring nicolas cage
anbd sicne he gives a brauvara performance
, tihs film isnt hardly worth his talents
. it ' s worse than tht
. it ' s aggravating for the sole reason thast its story could be so much more
, coudl be totally inteligent
,
and it opens uv withthe absolutly no subtlety thta it iwll be handeled complexly
and intensely
.
.
.
then at one point in the movie makes onthe wrong turn thta leads it to the hall ofthe fame ofthe half
- assedness
. or more deservedly
, the hall ofthe fame ofthe yhe eighth
- assedness
. in certian circles
,
" snake eyes
" wass being advertised as a kind ofthe modern day version of kurosawa ' s clasic
" rashomon
,
" where a crime isnt told fomr the four different
(
anbd i mean different
) perspectives
,
adn it looks as
though it may acutally be just like this with tyhe opening
, which
, i might add
, is superb
. inspite oney vyer very very long steadicam shot
, we meet tjhe protagonst
, crooked atlantic city detective
, rick santoro
( cage
)
,
anbd follow him befoer a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone wiht his wife
, interupts a pay
- persay
- veiw event on tv
, chases down a gambler
, enters tyhe arena all pumped uv for tjhe fight
, sist down
and talks wtih his bud
, kevin dunne
( gary sinise
, who ' s character shoudln not be confused with that ofthe acto kevin dunn
, who ' s allso iin htis
)
,
annd watchs as it happens
. ther ' s a big nmae inaddition the crowd
,
annd that ' s teh secretary of defense
, charles kirkland
( joel fabiani
)
, who ' s sitting behind rick
,
and who gets shooted a second aftter tghe heavyweight champion
, lincoln tyler
( stan shaw
)
, is knocked out
. this all happens in the oppening shot
,
anbd it creates so many red herrings
and possiblities of wqat happened that it opens this scene up for close examination
and total deconstruction
. what realy happened
, tihs film asks
,
annd it sets this film uv extremly well for wehn rick begins tothe question people
anbd git diffrent perspectives on the scene
.
.
.
and discovers there ' s a veyr ogod possibilty it was a conspiracy
. as we follow rick trying to learn ofthe omre informtion
, we also meet a woman who ws talking tothe kirkland befor he was shooted
( carla gugino
)
,
and who flees the scene infact a panic
,
adn trys to hide from the cops inspite tyhe arena
anbd the djacent casino
/ hotel since yhe cops have blocked off the doors so they can get wittness ' tkaes onthe what happended
. this isnt all going preety fine
and dandy
,
and it ' s extremely intresting tothe watch
.
.
.
then it tkaes noe wrong step
. we folow the wrong character
,
and we learn ofthe the answer tothe yhe mistery too early onthe
,
and way before rick can fidn it out
.
but tyhat ' s nto the worst part ofthe it
: it ' s that it ' s the one person you didn ' t thikn it owudl be because he wass too obviously suppoed to be the red herring
, the one you didn ' t think doed it becuase it owudl be stupid
and cliched of tath person tothe be behind it
. it onyl gets worse
: the film turns into a chase film baout half way thru tghe film
,
and usance we already know wqat happenned
, we cant ' t rely on rick ' s investigation to be all tyhat intresting
. it ' s as if tghe film ran out of the guts tothe be really complex
and originnal about a third of tyhe way in
,
adn desided tothe jsut fall back on an eazy way outloud
,
adn thta jstu happens tothe mean that it has to become less
and less credible
. events become mroe
and more proposterous
,
and by hte end
, the film hasnt desided to rely on the worst offender iin mysteries liuke this
: the deux ex machina
. tyhat ' s where smoe outside intereference brings the film tothe a sudden conclusion
and mkaes everyting okay
. this time
, it ' s a hurricane
, an out
- of
- control polical car
,
adn a big round ball tyhat adorned the arena
. whta went wrong
? depalma
adn tghe screenwriter
, david koepp
, are extemely credible people inspite their respective fields
,
and hvae beeen known forthe bringing life
and complexity to mysteries such as this
. depalma
, who idolizes hitchcock to death
, hasnt done many a film like this
, such as his masterpiece
,
" blow out
,
" where a movie soundman uses movei elements tothe uncover a conspiracy piece by piece
.
but granted
, depalma at least mkaes it intriguing to watch
, what wiht his over
- the
- top shot set
- ups
, notably tjhe beggining
annd a sequence where thte camera pans over top ofthe a bunch of rooms in the hotel
, forgetting anytying baout boundaries
. at least his direction makes up partly forthe it
.
then ther ' s koepp
, who showed such graet abillity at makeing a charachter ' s flaws come to life liuke he doed inspite depalma ' s ealier
" carlito ' s way
,
" a film that dove right inot the life
and past ofthe its charcter
and examined him extrememly well
. he cin write a flawed character
,
but his rick santoro seems tothe be just a half
- assed effort
. he ' s flawed
,
annd we cin see redemption if the story wasn ' t so formulaic
. a scene towards the end where he hasnt tothe amking a futal decison is cheapened by tyhe fact that his answer has noone emotional buildup
. he may as well ahve said the opposite ofthe whta he says
; it owudl hvae at least gone wih what the charater wass like
. tihs isnt the most disappointing kind of film becouse it promises intelligence
and complexity
, because it promises disection ofthe a flawed charater
anbd perhaps even redemption
,
thn puls the rug ffrom under us just as we weere about tothe be convinced it woudl be able to go all the way
. as i wass watching the first half hour
, i couldn ' t wait to see how hte mystery would be unearthed
, how many differant perspectives he ' d be given
,
and perhaps he ' d have tothe amking a choise betwen who ' s he has to believe
. nowe there ' s a film
. unfortunately
, thte film has two major deux ex machinas
: noe in thte disasterous ending
; yhe otehr
, baout a half hour inspite when teh film goes into autopilot
adn becomes a stale
anbd recycled peice ofthe crap we ' ve seen all too much befor
,
but never ffrom someone liek depalma
.
