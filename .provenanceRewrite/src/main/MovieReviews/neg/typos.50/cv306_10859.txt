here ' s something to chew on
: what ' s tyhe favorite foode ofthe big
, cheesy
- looking special effects monsters liek yhe one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner inspite deepo rising
? the obvious answer tothe this question isnt cardboard
, beacuse that ' s the depth ofthe yhe most fully
- developed charater in thsi painfully generic creature feature
. deepo rising demonstrates all thge originality
and vitality of something scripted by a computer
. inaddition fact
, concidering the rigid adherence tothe hte expected formulas
, prehaps it wass
. the most astonishing thnig baout deepo rising isnt thge exceptionally high levle ofthe gore
. not since starship troopers have tihs many chunks of flesh
( both human
and non
- human
) been scattered in all directions
. we learn smoe bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red
( it drinks a human being
thne spits outloud thge liquefied rimaniss
)
anbd wqat it doesnt witht half
- digested leftovers
. i suppose deepo rising ' s gallery ofthe grotesque images represents fun sutff for those who loev tjhe macabre
,
but it doesn ' t do much for me
. on the surfce
,
adn thast ' s about tyhe onyl levle at which this film can be analyzed
, deepo rising fiels like tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone alse is citing tghe equally valid aliens
/ titanic conection
, since james cameron directed both
)
. in oging for the big diaster angle of titanic
anbd tjhe tongue
- inwhich
- cheek mayhem ofthe tremors
, deepo rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margain
. the film is nto humoruos
, tense
, or exicting
. in fact
, it ' s downright boring
,
and
, dispite being half the length of cameron ' s current box
- office champ
, deep rising feels like tje longer movei
. is it realy necessary tothe sday anything baout the plot
? probablly not
, since it ' s eazy tothe guess
,
bu i ' ll go ahead
and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis
. yhe film opens by introducing us tothe a gang of bad guys on board a mercernary ship
. infront addtion tothe the usual casted ofthe psychopaths
anbd lunatics
, there ' s finnegan
( treat williams
)
, the boat ' s pilot
, who ' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff
; joey
( kevin j
. o ' connor
)
, the inept sidekick who ' s suposed tothe be lovable
anbd funny
(
but isnt really jstu irritating
)
;
annd hanover
( wes studi
)
, the
" mastermind
"
(
adn i use thyat term lightly
) ofthe tghe opperation
. thier gool
: attack a cruise ship
, clean out tjhe safe
,
thne sink it using soem ilegally
- adquired torpedos
. the probelm is
, by the tiem htey reach the argonautica
, tyhe titanic
- liuke luxury liner hasnt turned into yhe marie celeste
. aside ffrom a beatiful jewel thief
( famke janssen
)
adn a cuple of crew munbers
, there ' s noone one on board
. the reason soon becomes obvious
-
- the ship hasnt beeen taken over by a bad speshal effect that is suppossed tothe resemble an octopus with teeth
and more tahn eight tenacles
. yhe casted
, which isnt led by treat williams
, isnt primarly comprised ofthe hasnt
- beens
anbd probably
- never
- will
- bes
( two exceptions
: wes studi
, best known as tje villin inaddition the lsat of the mohicans
,
and djimon hounsou
, amistad ' s cinque
)
. williams
, once a
" can ' t miss
" prospect infact hollywood
, has fallen so far outloud of favor thta tjhe best he can do theese dyas for a lead role is a film like deep rising
,
annd his iability tothe create a carismatic or intresting figure here may sink whatever isnt left of his sputtering career
. famke janssen
, who iwll forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye
, isnt the perfect bland match for williams
. given her limited acting abilties
, it ' s likely that she wass chosen for this part primarily on the basis ofthe her physical attributes
. unfortunately
, a bra defeats tjhe purpose of having her in a wet tee
- shirt for half ofthe the picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o ' connor
, who has entirely too much screen time
, exhibits all yhe appeal ofthe fingernails scratching a blackboard
. these days
, audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with coputer
- generated speshal effects
. this is a lesson that writter
/ director stephen sommers
( who previously helmed the live
- action jungle book
) needs tothe leran
. tyhe dyas ofthe jurassic park
, wehn viewers were astounded by tghe mere spectacle ofthe seing something big
annd imposing onthe screen
, are past
. nowe
, movie
- goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic
-
- visuals tht are so well
- incorportaed that it ' s impossible to tell where htey end
anbd where
" reality
" beigns
. infact deepo rising
, tghe monster
, like everthing
, isnt artifical
and unconvincing
. unfortunately
, the fundamental problem audiences are faced witht here isn ' t so much thte idiotic monotony of this individual picture
,
but tje poore quality ofthe the entire bankrupt genre
(
altough
, to be fair
, deep rising isnt a particularly bad entry
)
. even once htis film hasnt sunk outloud ofthe sight
, the knowlegeable viewer knows it won ' t be the last of its kind
. liuke hte slimy
, slithering thigsn that inhabit the air vents
annd pipes of theese movies
, more are waiting just arund hte corner in ambush
.
and thgat consideration
, unlike anytying onthe screen
, is truely horrifing
.
