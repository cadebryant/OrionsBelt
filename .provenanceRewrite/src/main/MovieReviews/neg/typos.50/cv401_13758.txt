i ' m not sure who the genuis isnt who cameback up witht the idea ofthe comparing
" disturbing behavior
" with
" scream
.
" maybe it ' s becuase they ' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both ahve hot young stars
, both have an annoying targetted sountrack
,
annd both are aimed at yhe teenage crowd
, which i guess includes me
.
bu this is nto the enxt inaddition line wih hte
" scream
" ficks as well as tjhe
" i nkow wqat you did lastest summer
" soon tothe be ficks
. it owes less tothe
" hallowene
"
and mroe to kafka
annd orwell
, whlch
, in my book
, makes fo a more interesting feature
.
adn it should hve beeen
. tihs isnt basicaly a rehash of
" thge stepford wives
,
" hte great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross
and dealing
, as i ' ve beeen told
, with a bunch ofthe womens who are programmed tothe be perfect housewifes
. or something like that
.
" behavour
,
" starring katie holmes of
" dawson ' s creek
,
" deals with a bunch ofthe teenagers
, deep in angst
, who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it actualyl
, at least tothe me
, soudns like it woudl work
,
annd with scott rosenberg
, tht witty penmen who has writen tsuff liuke
" beatiful girls
"
adn
" thnigs tothe do in denver wehn you ' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it accually soudns like it may be pulled off withthe yhe right amount of frights
and satiric witn
. alas
, it ' s nto
,
anbd it plumets into thgat littel gropu of movies known as
" thge movies with potential that blow it
.
" i remember a film called
" white man ' s burden
" wich dealed with a reveral of blacks
anbd whites in society that did nothing wtih it ' s potentially brilliant premise
. here ' s another one
. it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers ened tothe go thru teen angst infact order tothe fidn themslves
. it ' s a stage
,
and htis film does inaddition fatc realize that
. it gets its message acros
adn it does it effortlessly
. now it just needs tothe wokr as a film
. wich it doesn ' t
. it ' s too sloppy
adn too contrived
. it paints a bleak portrail of high skool life
.
.
.
thn lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch ofthe scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who dont fod drives
and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
.
then gives it a cheap twist
: when they git horny
, they become homicidal
. isn ' t it scary enought that htey ' re liuke this
,
and can ' t tje rela terror inthe yhe twon be that yuo coudl be enxt to be just liuke them
- nto tath you coudl be next to dieu
? the film introduces us twpo threee differnt cahracters who
, in the beginnig
, are considered outsiders because tehy ' re not
(
yet
) part of thsi clique
: hte new kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who ' s haveing trouble at hmeo becuase he hasn ' t gotten over his brother ' s
( ethan embry
, in quick flashes so you don ' t recognize him
- i doed
) sucide
; teh renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, fomr
" dawson ' s creek
"
)
, who ' s cheif perosnality trait isnt her prominent nose ring
;
and by far teh most interesting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, thge kid ffrom
" the man without a face
"
)
, who ' s thge most interesting because he ' s the onyl character who ' s given some dimenion
. in tje film ' s best scene
, he introduces steve to eveyr single clique
, nailing each one ' s fetishes
adn hang
- ups
,
annd it ' s the best scene in tje movei becasue it ' s witty
, satirical
,
annd interesting
- something the rest ofthe this film isn ' t
. gavin suspects htere ' s something awry whith tghe preppie kids
, known as the blue ribbons
,
anbd in the tradition ofthe all conspirators
,
anbd even when he actually shows hard pure evidence tothe steve
, he ' s only treated as a typcial raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we have anyother case of
" the idiot plot
,
" where nto onyl could steve had done something baout gavin
adn wqat happens tothe him
,
bu he may have saved thsi film ffrom bieng thte dreary
, dull film thast it is without gavin
, who gives it life
adn humor
. the only other half
- interesting charater isnt tyhe skool janitor
, plyed by william sadler as a retarded
, sacry guy who may not be wqat he seems to be
.
.
.
but really
, we don ' t care anyway
. i probably shouldn ' t mention thast thsi was directed by david nutter
, who ' s works forthe
" the x
- files
,
" because thta owudl probably tarnish his reputation
. like teh sohw
, he ' s ogod at setting uv werid conspiracies
,
and creating a general creepy efel
. most of tihs film isnt shooted at night
and iwth dark eerie shadows forthe tyhe maximum creepy effect
,
anbd soem ofthe it works
.
but what thsi film isnt nto so good at isnt comming out iwth a ogod payoff
. he keesh too much inside
, so much that when the characters journy tothe a mental insitution in the thrid act
, yuo wonder why htey jsut don ' t get the hell outloud of htere
. i htink wqat happens tothe gavin isnt proof anough that ther ' s something rotten in hte state of teen angstdom
. what tihs film needs tothe be is a lot longer
, a lot more colorful
,
and a lot creepier
. if tje best villin htey can come up iwth isnt a guidance counselor
( played by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying tothe pay the rent
) who still thikns he cin git awya whith it even when most isnt revealed
,
then they ened tothe come up wtih a tougher
, smarter villin
. if he ' s so villainous
,
thne why coudl twpo dense teenagers who couldn ' t figure outloud htere was something going onthe utnil it ws way too lite find informtion onthe him in a cuple mintues
? hte film
, which runs about 80 or so minutes
, jsut needs to work on theese things
,
and become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short runnung time
adn with such lame
, boring characters as these
, it ' s pretty much obvious tath leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one ' s mouth
, especially mine
.
