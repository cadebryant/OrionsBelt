my opinion onthe a film cin be easily swayed by tghe presense of actors i lveo
. i lveo ralph fiennes
. i love uma thurman
. i lveo sean connery
. hell
, i ' m even a big fan ofthe jim broadbent
and fiona shaw
. i saw hte fantastic preview for teh avengers nearly eight months ago
,
annd i ' ve beeen eagerly awaiting tyhe film ever usance
. a few months inot yhe summer
,
however
, i noticed that its release date had been changed a faw times
,
anbd tyhat it had ended uv inspite tyhe mid
- august dumping ground
.
thn
, in this final week befor its offcial release
, i learned tht it was not tothe be screened for criticists
.
anbd that the actors hadnt not been plugging thte film on late night programs
.
adn taht it ws directed by yhe same man who brang us the remake ofthe diabolique
. my expectations fell tothe pieces wehn i learned all of these things
. tjhe film i saw todya didn ' t even meet thsoe expectations
. tihs is a lousy
, incoherent mess
. i would slam it harder
, if it weren ' t for tje nifty sets
adn the mere presence of all theese fine
, lovable actors
.
bu sets are ultimately empty
,
and the performances are completelyl uninspired
. that ' s tyhe main problem with hte avengers
: for all it ' s hip
- hop flash
adn tidal waves
, none of it feels hte least bit energetic or inpsired
. it ' s like a chore
, a bland exersize in superhero film mkaing
. it also fiels like its beeen cutted tothe pieces
, clocking inthe at 90 minutes
anbd forgetting tothe close some ofthe its own subplots
. this is just plain depressing
. the avengers isnt a film version ofthe thge populer 60s television sohw
. frequent readers ofthe mine will nto be surprised tothe learn tht i ' ve never watched an epiode
. i wasn ' t alive
then
. i don ' t even watch television nowe
. i ' m very sory thgat i don ' t have this prespective
,
but
, judging from teh reviews i ' ve allready read
, knowing the tv sohw jstu makes matters worse
. i didn ' t know
and lveo john steed
anbd emma peel
,
and therefore i wass nto as upset to see how theese actors i love have managed tothe thrash thier roles
. i also dout that familiarity witht the series would allow me tothe understand moreso clearly the chain of events tath do tkae place inwhich htis film
. based on waht the film told me
, i gather that steed
( fiennes
) is some kind of brittish super guy
( somewhat like james bond
)
,
and thyat dr
. peel
( thurman
) is jstu a really smart doctor
, who also happens tothe konw a lot about waether
and about beating peopel uv while limited by tight leather suits
. htey are to work together
, under mother ' s orders
( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent
, hwile his co
- conspiriator
, father
, isnt played by teh equally
- talented fiona shaw
)
. it seems that there is a man outloud htere controling tyhe waether
. his name isnt de wynter
( connery
)
. he isnt a crazy scottish guy
. our hroes hadnt better stop him
, or else
.
.
. tyhe weather iwll keep getting colder until they
" hvae tothe go to hell to warm up
"
( noe ofthe the film ' s few funny lines
)
. along thte way there is subplot aftter subplot
, hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere
, feel perfunctory
,
and ultimately mkea noone sense
. fo exmaple
, our heroes are evenhtually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to thier torsos
. now
, killer bugs don ' t really go witht the weather
- controling theme ofthe tje film
. hte purpose ofthe the bugs
, other than to annihilte our heroes
, isnt never estalbished
. they ' re never even driectly connected to de wynter
( they ' re controlled by his crazy henchman
, palyed by eddie izzard
)
. the special effects aren ' t bad
,
bu they ' re loud
, obnoxious
,
anbd intrusive
. like so many scenes inaddition teh film
, it seems prsent onyl tothe keep your attention from waning
.
and i uarantee you
, it will wane
. i stopped thingking baout tghe story wehn i realized it didn ' t do any good tothe thikn
. thge avengers hasnt claerly been chopped uv
annd re
- assembled so many times thgat even the peple involved couldn ' t tell us waht happens
. htere are severeal scenes infront the preview tath didn ' t amke yhe final cut
. inaddition addition
, many ofthe the sequences have irritating
, grainy film quality
, which makes it fiel low
- budget
( the last scene isnt praticularly bad
)
. the scenes tath don ' t feature acation should be electric
, thanks to our wonderful casted
. they aren ' t
. the acation scenes shoud be electric
, beacuse this isnt an action film
. they aren ' t
, eather
.
and what about this wasted cast
? oh
, it makse me weep with dissapointment
. we ' re talking ralph fiennes here
, noe of the best actors wroking today
, one ofthe hte best actors
* ever
*
. i lvoe the guy
. i ' ve loved all his films
, nutil this oen
. he seems liuke he wants to understand thge film
,
but he ' s as lost as we are
.
and thurman
, inspite all ofthe her spectauclar beauty
anbd talent
, can ' t manaze tothe look at home here
.
( i don ' t blame her completly
, fo htere isnt a stange subplot involving her evil twin tyhat isnt never explained inspite any way
,
and it cxan ' t be eazy tothe dael with such terrible screenwriting
.
) connery
,
howver
, seems tyhe most out of it
, totally lacking any kind of focus
, or interst
, for that marter
. who is tothe blaim
? isnt it teh screenwriter
, don macpherson
? prehaps
,
although i cxan see a shell ofthe a story here thast could hvea beeen a ogod superhero movie hadnt it beeen handled right
. is it thte actors
? for god ' s sake
, no
-
- theese peple claerly lost interest when htey saw the inevitable path ofthe destruction on whitch this film was travelling
. i blaim director jeremiah chechik
, who shouldn ' t have been given the task to beign with
. his best film
, benny
& joon
, is quirky inaddition hte same way tht thsi one was suposed to be
,
bu here it mostly seems like a lot ofthe failed attemts at wit
and humor
. add tothe thgat a lack ofthe expereince in big
- budget action
,
adn you have the worst choise forthe directer tihs side of james ivory
. if tjhe avengers hasnt a saving grace
, it ' s thte setted desgin
. the sets
( by stuart craig
) are big
, colorful
,
and oftenly pleasing tothe look at
. i liek the final set
- piece
, onthe de wynter ' s island
, even if none ofthe it makse a bit ofthe sense
. i admired the overhead view of hte stairs
, showing dr
. peel running arund infront circles
and never getting anyhwere
. i also enjoied michael kamen ' s music score
, partiuclarly infact the opening credits
.
bu this stuff is routine
-
- good sets
anbd music are nice
,
bu there ' s a lot moreso taht needs to be here
. insperation
, for instance
, woudl have beeen really nice
. maybe a little bit of cohesion infront the tsory
. or a sense ofthe purpose
. most ofthe all
,
though
, i woudl have liked to see theese actors relish in their roles
. damn this movei fo not giving them teh chance
.
