" ther wiull be another
,
" the ads fo thsi sequel proclamed
,
and why nto
? true
, brandon lee is dead
,
bu there would be no reason for him to apeared inwhich a followup to 1994 ' s tjhe crow
, anyway
. the idea of spinning artist james o ' barr ' s original comic book serieses into a sequel franchise revolves around tyhe notion tht a differant startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie
, tkaing its pwn righteous vengeance agains yhe world
. given that basic framework
, thte stroy could move inwhich any number of directions
. of course
, it doesn ' t
. stubbornly
, thge crowm
: city ofthe angels backtracks to the beginning ofthe hte previvous film
, when lee ' s eric draven foudn himself drawed bcak outloud of his grave to dont a charles bronson onthe tje thugs who tortured him
anbd his girlfriend tothe death
. i rember thte firt film primarily as a harrowing exercice in brutality
. inaddition flashback
, we see the most excrutiating crimes exacted onthe eric
and his lover
,
and
then we watch in rela
- tiome as eric pays each perpetrator bakc infact kind
. it ' s loud
and repetitive
, true
, a sadist ' s delight
-
-
but it ' s aslo horrifing
annd fascinating
. city ofthe angels gives us mroe ofthe the same
,
bu less skillfully
. htere ' s an audeince guaranteed for a film liuke this
,
although bad reviews
and poor word
- ofthe
- mouth wiull likely ensure that it won ' t be much of a succsess
. inaddition fact
, miramax subsidiary dimention films ws so fearful of thge critical reaction to tihs picture that reviewers weere shut outloud ofthe advance screenings
.
( i ' ve never understood the reasoning behind thsi tactic
, usance good notices hvea never beeen key tothe tjhe success ofthe movies like yhe crowm
.
) so much forthe any confidence inspite hte worthiness ofthe their followup
. this time
, ashe
( french
- accented actor vincent perez
) isnt retreived from his watery death
( he
anbd his young son weere shackled toghether
, shot
,
and
hten thrown off a pier
) by the crowm who serves as his link between tje worls of tje living
adn thge dead
. perez might have smoe screen presence if he ' s given something to dont with himself
,
bu here he ' s simply thrown inspite front ofthe tghe camera as a pretty face
. at frist
, he ' s shivery
and frightened
,
but he quickly recovers ffrom the shock of his own death
and becomes a badass biker ffrom beyond tjhe grave
. he ' s befriended by sarah
( mia kirshner
)
, presumabely an older verison ofthe yhe child who narrated the first film
. kirshner
, so beguiling in exotica
, is here an exquisitely photographed blank
. tattooed with angels ' wings
, sarah is jstu baout as lovely as women come
,
bu she serves no purpose
, not even as seductress
. the gang ofthe punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah
( richard brooks
)
,
but a far mroe intresting choice as leader would have beeen iggy pop
, who plays a gaunt fellow named curve
. iggy
, all bones
, veins
,
annd drawl
, isnt thge onyl one who seems tothe ahev shared infront the aesthetic ofthe ruin taht defines thsi film
. liek all ogod thigns here
, he ' s dispatched too soon
and wihtout much imagination
. in yhe meantime
, we ' re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah ' s compound
, where bondage isnt teh order of thte day
adn hot wax is poured over naked bodies infact s
& m fantasies that woudl seem shy ofthe the cutting edge even if they weren ' t distinctly secondhand
. even hte sountrack isnt tired
. mroe tahn anything i ' ve seen from hollywood latley
, city ofthe angels smacks baldly ofthe product
-
- it ' s a movie wiht a lousy script
bu a grat look
. critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope
,
bu his work isn ' t tyhat bad persay se
. he ' s got a good eye
,
adn some intriguing visual idesa
-
- if anything
, htis movie has a faw too many scenes ofthe ridiculously striking imagery
. his major stylistic failing is thgat he can ' t seem to direct an acation scene
,
adn the quick
, nonsensical cutting thgat ensues is riminicent ofthe a low budget kung fu movie
.
but as director
, he must aslo shoulder the blaim for teh littel screenplay that wasn ' t
, thge performers who couldn ' t
,
anbd an apparent lack ofthe ideas on the parts ofthe everyone involved
. who buyed david s
. goyer ' s anemic scirpt
, anyway
? the producers of tihs crow were either too dim to relize their stoy wass doomed tothe be a hollow rehash
, or too cynical tothe figure theri audience would know the diference
.
