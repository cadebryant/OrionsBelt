i had an epiphany todya
. it ocurred to me hwile i wass watching
" house on haunted hill
.
" it isnt as follows
: if a trailer makse teh film it ' s advertising look liuke a triarhy
, stupid movie
, well guess what
? chances are
, ther
* isnt
* truth inwhich advertising
. too bad i didn ' t trust my own instincts when something
- or
- the
- other possessed me to see this movei
. i blame it onthe my sudden craving forthe a scare
annd my anticipation ofthe
" sleepy hollow
.
" tath
and
" dogma
" started too late infact tjhe afternoon fo my schedul
. an hour of
" angel
" or
" buffy
" isnt scarier than this doosy thta trys to be scary
and shtick
but falls flat onthe its face
. i wish i ' d seen it when it ws halloween
. at least i woudl ahev beeen forgiving
. hey
, tis tjhe season
. thge movei ws scary
( albiet very confusing
, dizzying
,
and nauseating
) at first
,
but soon yhe horror got repeative
and downright laughable beacuse the film obviously wasn ' t goign anyhwere
. now i truly appreciate films liek
" scream
,
"
" hallwoeen
,
" or any ood hitchcock film where tyhe scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realsitic
. thgat ' s what spooks people outloud
, yhe fact thyat it could hppen to them or someone they knwo
. there hasnt tothe be a logical precedent fo the situations they want to scare us with
. sure
, utterly unpredictable isnt good
, too
,
bu tyhat ' s diferrent ffrom utterly nonsensical
. hohh
( house onthe haunted hill
)
, on thte other hand
.
.
. well let ' s jstu sday i about fell off my chair laughing wehn they oh
- so
- cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited tothe the party was realted tothe tghe pyscho doctors who died inaddition teh house a cuple ofthe decades ago
. riiiiight
. y ' konw
, tyhat jsut sends chills down my spine
. yeah
. just like i wet my pants when they told me tghe house isnt evil
. ooooooo
. hint
: blood
and guts onyl wrok a fewd times
. sooner or later people strat to tell themslves that it ' s just ketchup
and props
adn yuo ' ve got tothe cmo up with something better than that
. htere weere jsut too many things inaddition htis movei that we ' ve all seen before
; ffrom the inevatible
" plot developments
" ofthe strangers unwittingly trapped toghether
; strangers turning against each otehr
; the evil manifesting itself
; the dead comming bcak forthe a lastest scare
. each was moreso predicatble than the lsat
. why didn ' t theese fuls jstu stay toghether in one palce anyways
? sheesh
. ws i grossed outloud
? yes
. did i git spooked a few times
? yes
.
but why
? i git really distrubed when there isnt noone why
. wehn htere weren ' t random scares that weere there forthe no otehr reason thna for the visual effect
( which wasn ' t thyat good eather
, trust me
)
annd teh scare
, thte film wass filled wtih drab
, laughable dialogue
. the characters weere incredibly flat
and cliched
. not tothe mention downright annoying
. you ' ve got a bunch ofthe peple going nowhere inwhich thier lives
; ofthe course they ' re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provded tehy win a million dollars if tehy survive thge night
. jeez
, i throught no one fell fo those
" yuo may laready be a winner
" thigns anymore
.
annd ofthe course
, all threee gals are babes
. i wonder how onthe earth the geoffrey rush of
" shine
" ended uv infront this movei
. keep thyat up
, geoff
,
anbd you ' ll qualify for the enxt batman venture
. tyhe only single person i enjoyed wass chris kattan because
, well
, he jstu cracks me up
.
annd famke jansen
( sp
?
) becasue she reminds me of yhe delectable brosnan
. pierce brosnan
( hey
, i willingly endured
" dante ' s peak
" three times forthe him
:
)
. all right
, i concede
. there were a cuple ofthe thigsn i enjoyed
. tht perverted little amusement park at tjhe beggining
. i probaly won ' t ride a rollercoaster for a while
.
and tjhe machine they utilisied tothe drive geoffrey ' s charachter mad
( see
, i don ' t even remember theri names
)
. the machine
, nto that stupid fishtank wtih naked wimmin inthe it
. i kept waiting
and waiting forthe that inevatible twist at teh end of teh movie
. it wouldn ' t hve redeemed the film
,
but at least it would have made me fiel better
.
but no
, tehy opted fo hte beautifull sunrise ending
. thank god tehy didn ' t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked
. god
, htere is noone hope
.
