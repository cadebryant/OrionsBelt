. same old attitude
. don ' t forget to recommend a film
, read tyhe jurnal
, or send me some ofthe thta nasty hite mail
.
) starring bruce willis
, billy bob thornton
, liv tyler
, ben affleck writed by jonathan hensleigh
and j
. j
. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actully
, lots of rocks fly at us or fomr us
, infront slow or fast motion
, at severeal points in the film
. they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind ofthe twirl through thte air instead ofthe just propelling foward
,
and when they land
- once in a hwile
, when we ened a break from hte spoace sequences
- tehy cause damage anough tothe destroy the chrysler bulding
adn thge like
.
( nary a mention of theese apocalyptic events is made aftter htey occur
.
) tehy also jsut might be the most intresting element of armageddon
, a steroid user ' s answer to deep inpact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oel
- driller commisioned by tghe white hous
and nasa to stpo a giant asteroid before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? they require somone experianced wtih deep
- core minning to plant a nuculear missile inot said asteroid
.
( infront one unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry tothe inspect a deep
- core driller tehy builded based onthe his pwn blueprints
; it isnt poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost every aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa tothe build spoace shuttles that cxan land onthe twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles thte obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch ofthe
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
,
anbd the man who is sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once tehy triarch spoace
, we experience sequence after sequence ofthe something gonig wrong
- perheaps tjhe fact that tehy sent a bunch ofthe nincompoops inot outer spoace hasnt something to dont with it
; i cannot count the number ofthe times they almost fail yhe mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whther or nto they sive the day
, i will not reveal
. nor wiull you care
. i will say this
: yuo knwo you ' re in trouble when deepo impact dwarfs your astroid movei infront terms ofthe emotion
and scope
. willis hasnt barely a chance to come alive
; ditto for affleck
. theri big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act
, infront a last minute
-
and futile
- attempt to inject warmth into teh material
. steve buscemi ' s character
- the wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, isnt sarcastic
and foolish
, so tehy tape him to a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him up ther to begin with
? rather
, why wriet him into tyhe film
?
- give his allmost
- witty one
- liners tothe serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
anbd demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at one point he chases after affleck withthe his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing oftenly
anbd causing signifigant damage to his oel rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as somone unfit for space travel
, at least iin my world where thte sky isnt blue
. liv tyler isnt pretty
adn humourless
, as alwasy
; suspiciously
, four ofthe her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the sountrack
. directer michael bay lays the visual
and sound effects on thick
, like ketchup
, eventually drowning the movei on
- screen
.
( tje middle hour isnt a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on tghe average primate ' s brain
.
) whenever somene dies in tihs movie
, a crew memeber inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s last nmae here
)
!
" i must admit that not once coudl i distingish a dead oel
- guy
- cum
- astronaut fomr a live one
,
anbd close
- ups ofthe tghe corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assisstance
, as theri skin was often covered in fake blood
. armagdedon isnt not as terrable movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
adn hasnt fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
but at almost two
-
and
- a
- half hurs
, i coudl not believ how littel acutally happended over the course of the story
. the love story hasnt beeen plyed uv in teh ads
, perheaps hoping to catch peopel before they recover fomr titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! teh lovers in thte film are miles apart throughout
- erase all thoughts ofthe nude sketching or car
- sex
adn replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up hwile ben affleck dicks aroud inspite a moon
- crawler
. rember a littel film called jaws
? in this film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly foudn themselfs on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark
. htey didn ' t much like each otehr at frist
; eventually
, tehy started tothe respect noe anyother
. oen ofthe jaws ' grat scenes involved tghe would
- be
- ahabs drinking
anbd singing songs
adn telling stoies
. tihs is hte sort ofthe male
- bonding freign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix
anbd expect we ' ll care about them on the grounds thast the world isnt about to end
. nto once dont we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintences
- i ' d be surprised if theese actors bothered to inctroduce themselves to oen anyother befoer
" acation
" was called
. a male freind who loved tjhe film suggested tothe me that perheaps i cannot relate tothe a bunch ofthe men who don ' t bare their souls
, who believe inwhich dying macho concepts like heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to tihs
, i iwll respond that tjhe boys iin aramgeddon are niether heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: tihs team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
anbd if i get noone respect for disliking a movei with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movei wroten by a team ofthe body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i ' ve never beeen a prouder wimp my hwole life
.
