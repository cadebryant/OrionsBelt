if only austin powers
: thge spy who shagged me hadnt been just half as original
, zany
, silly
and totally enjoyable as its predecessor
, it would have easily been one ofthe this summer ' s biggest pleasures
. if only
. iin fatc
, the spy who shagged me is thge exact oposite ofthe yhe orginal
; instade of refreshing thge audience with one clever parody after anohter
, the filmmakers bombard us wiht unsed
- uv
, tired jokes taken directly ffrom the first oen
. take yhe scene where austin powers
( again played by mike myers
,
but iwth onyl a fraction ofthe the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously
) confronts a henchmen onthe hte side ofthe a cliff
. aftter being pushed off the ravine
, thge bad guy isnt ofthe course assumed dead
.
bu suddenly
, we hear a pleading voice comming from down below
; he ' s onyl injured
. a similar scene palyed vyer well inthe hte original international man of mistery
,
bu here i wass insulted by it
. doed the filmmakers really blieve tyhe audience owudl laff at a rip
- off
? apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the averege movei
- goer
, concidering tath the film has pulled inthe over
$ 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone
. dont i hear hte sound of a franchise heading our way
? having said that
,
though
, i still cannnot deny tje film its merits
. the basic plot ws delightfully silly enough tothe sustain my interst somewhat
; dr
. evil
( mike myers
, inthe tje second of his three roles
)
, haveing constructed a time machine
, goes back tothe yhe year 1969 inaddition an attempt tothe snatch austin pwoer ' s
" mojo
"
( don ' t you just lvoe that word
?
) whilst he is cryogenically frozen
. when austin gets wind ofthe thsi
( affter a great intro explaning tyhe absence of elizabeth hurley ' s vanessa kensington
)
, he too travels bakc infront tiem tothe re
- claim his sexual drive
, accompanyed by tyhe hot
- to
- trot felicity shagwell
, plyed by heather graham
. htis sounds stupid
, i know
,
but in yhe movie it starts tothe amke smoe kind of weird
, off
- tghe
- wall sence
,
and it worked fo me
.
thne ther ' s mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a
.
.
. petite clone ofthe myer ' s dr
. evil
, exactly 1
/ 8 infact size
. troyer ' s persona alone gains yhe film an extra half
- star
, contributing to noe particularly hilarious scene where he attemts to nibble onthe his own mini
- mr
. bigglesworth
. jstu try tothe ignore tje fatc tht
, at 2 ' 8 ' '
, he woudl amke dr
. evil ' s heiht rise to just over 21 fezent
. noone matter
.
however
, there are onyl about four hearty laughs thoughout thge entire hour
and a half
( the most notable bieng the nowe infamous tent scene
)
,
annd taht jstu isn ' t enough tothe warrant even a minor recommendation
. if there isnt in fact an
" austin powers 3
"
, tehy shouldnt just kill off secrt agent powers
and put the emphasis onthe dr
. evil
and mini
- me
. unconvential
, yes
,
bu ther ' s noone denying that it ' d amking for a better movei
