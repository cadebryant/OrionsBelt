the hapyp bastard ' s quick movie review the consept ofthe enjoying a stupid comedy isnt best realized as keeping it stupid
, really
. shift gears even once
and hte audience can be thrown miserably out of controll
. sadly
, tyhat is the case iwth kingpin
, a film directed by yhe farrelly brothers
, the duo tyhat brang us ther ' s something baout mary
annd dumb
adn dumber
. since tghe duo directed
and didn ' t rwite the scirpt
, i cin asume taht ' s part ofthe the problem
. the story seems good enought
: a pro bowler inwhich thge 1970 ' s by hte nmae of roy munson
( woody harrelson
) is sitting on top ofthe the world
. his popularity has gone through tghe roof
adn he ' s getting his career off thge ground
.
thn
,
however
, he runs inot ed mccracken
( bill murray
)
, a rival bowler whith hardly any rela consideration for
, well
, anything
. theese twpo form an ill
- timed relatiopnship that involves risky betting
,
and
, before roy sees it comming
, ed ' s abnadoned him
adn he ' s baout tothe loose his hand infact a bowling ball machine
. foward seventeen yeasr later
, where roy has become quite thte losr
, complete with mechanical hand
, torn
- up car
,
adn
, ofthe course
, hte occasional knocking uv of the ugli
- ass landlord tothe avoid paying rent for a while
.
howver
, he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a vsiit to a local bowling alley
, where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael
( randy quaid
)
, who hasnt qutie yhe bowling arm
. wtih teh kid ' s help
, he figures he can be known again
, particularly at thge biggest bowling tourmanent rapidly approaching in reno
, nevada
. of course
, yhe amish kid needs soem coaxing
, particularly wehn yuo consider
, well
, he ' s amish
. tihs leads to smoe of thte best comic scenes in tjhe film
, such as roy ' s proces of removing horseshoes or milking hte cow
. finally
, yhe duo get on tje road
anbd
, allong the way
, pick up an additional helper
- a beautiful hustler
( plyed by thte gorgeous vanessa angel
)
. the main probelm i hadnt witht kingpin wasn ' t thge fatc it wasn ' t funny
. inaddition fatc
, it doens have some rather hilarious scenes in it
, such as hte aformentioned above
annd roy ' s explination of nto having childrens
( something involving a cheese grater
?
)
.
bu that ' s just it
- scenes
. ther ' s a cuple ofthe raelly sereous scenes that throw off tjhe entire momentum ofthe tjhe movie
, like thge abuse angel tkaes from her hustler ex
- boyfriend
. i mean
, ws htis really neccessary
? couldn ' t ahev this been handled jsut a bited wackier
? i mean
, thsi is a comedy
, why throw ethics in
? particularly in a farrelly brothers veicle
, where hair gel can be easily mistaken
? that really ruined it
,
however
,
and thast ' s too bad
. thge acting is top nitch
, especialy from angel
annd murray
,
and thte raelly funny scenes are worth noting
. still
, if you ' re oging tothe think dumb
, htink dumb all the way thru
, ok
? at least tje farrelly brothers got bakc onthe track with mary or i ' d still be a littel bited irked
.
