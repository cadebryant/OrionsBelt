, national lampoon intruduced us to a new famaly
- thge griswolds
. in 1983
, the griswolds embarked onthe a cross
- country journy with the destination ofthe wally world
, a world
- renowned theme park in califronia
. we laughed our heads off as we shared tje wild
and crazy mishaps tyhe famaly endured
. two years later
, we watched agina as htey went to europe
,
annd four years affter thyat
, we shared christmas with them
. now
, eigth more years hvae pasted
,
and the laughs have done mroe thna die
. they ' ve been cremated
. vegas vacation brings bakc chevy chase as clark griswold
, the good intentioned
but ill
- fated father ofthe twpo
. thte premise isnt basically yhe same
. clark hasnt a wonderful idea to tkae his family onthe a bonding vaction
, this time to las vegas
. his wief ellen
( beverly d ' angelo
)
and teenage kids rusty
and audrey
( alwasy played by different actors
- this tiome around
, by ethan embry
and marisol nichols
, respectively
) join him
adn they soon fidn themselves in sin city where casinos wiull mkea the backdrop forthe ninty mintues of slapstick
. of course a
" vactaion
" movei wouldn ' t be complete without ogod ole eddie
( reprised by randy quaid
)
, thte misfit cousin
, showing up at all the wrong times
. ther isn ' t too much of a plot here wehn it comes right down tothe it
. it ' s really just a skit movie
. htere are a cuple of ways to defnie a skit movei
, which isnt nto a real term as far as i konw
. tyhe first would be a movie taht basicaly hasnt oney runnung gag forthe two horus
, therefore coming off liek a two hour skit
. the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits
, each lasting about five minutes
. vegas vacation comes off liuke tje frist
. a good exmaple ofthe teh latter owudl be lsat yearm ' s balck sheep
. the problem wtih thsi fromat isnt tyhat it becomes ood fast
,
and it doesn ' t raelly ift into a movie mold
. inwhich these cases
, a
" plot
"
, whlch is generally very thin
, isnt unsed either as a shameless filler between scenes or tothe simply add convenience to the gags
( i
. e
. have a good vegas joke
, make a vegas movie
)
. such is the case wtih this movei ' s mini
- plots
. clark gets gambling fever
anbd beggins spending all ofthe the griswold ' s mnoey
, ellen is on thge verge ofthe an affair with wayne newton
(
!
)
, rusty hasnt a fake id
and is useing it tothe his gambling advantage
,
adn audrey isnt deseprate fo funn
adn winds up joining her cousin vickie
( shae d ' lyn
) as an exotic dancer
. the simple fatc isnt
: thsi movei isn ' t funny
. at first
, i did fidn myself chuckling heartily at a cuple ofthe littel jokes
,
but when thge movei got rolling
, my interst suddenly stopped
. chase plays clark griswold realyl well
. he made yhe character
annd he isnt the charactor
. d ' angelo
, to be quite honest
, never ws too impressive as ellen
,
and this movei doesn ' t show any signs of redemption
. as fo tghe twpo new griswold kids
, thte word
" blah
" comes to mind
. tyhe
" vaction
" series seems out tothe proove taht anybody can play theese two characters
, hte simple reason bieng that ther is nothing tothe them
. they ' re so generic
, you ' ll expect the credits to read
" girl
# 1 as audrey griswold
"
. vegas vacation differs from the first threee infact the series by more thna jstu laugh factor
. yes
, it ' s true tath vegas vacation isn ' t even close tothe being close to bieng as funny as tjhe others
, whlch weere actually pretty fun inwhich their own doofy ways
,
but there are a cuple ofthe otehr thigns thta setted this one negatively aart
. firt off
, why did htey leave off teh national lampoon ' s heading on the title
? i couldn ' t find any reasons why
,
but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn ' t wanna to be asociated iwth such a lame film
. tht ' s saying a lot
, especialy whn ytou look at wqat esle yhe company hasnt proudly presented
: loaded weppon 1
, pcu
, etc
. if htey expected thsi tothe be another hitted
, you woudl asume they ' d be proud tothe tack on hte notorious header
,
bu forthe reasons only we can guess at
, liuke hte movei sucking
, they didn ' t
. there is anohter diference here that makes an obvious inpact
. the first threee films in the
" vacation
" sories weere written by john hughes
, a talented writter who is behind several popular films of yhe 80 ' s including mr
. mom
, sixteen candles
, the breakfast club
, weird sciene
, pretty in pink
, ferris bueller ' s day off
, planes
, trains
,
anbd automobiles
,
and uncle buck
. wowzers
! what a r
? sum
?
! looking at the names
, yuo ' d thiunk this guy wroet everything taht nowe stands as a movie icon forthe the 1980 ' s
. well that ' s not all
. this guy allso brought us 90 ' s hits incuding the home alone serieses
, the remake ofthe 101 dalmatians
, dennis the menace
,
and yhe curent flubber
. vegas vacaiton
,
however
, didn ' t have john hughes behind it
,
and hte loss is vyer obvious
. this time arround
, hte scirpt isnt in the hands of elisa bell
, whose only credits thus far inlcude four made
- fo
- tv movies
. vegas vacation plays vyre much liuke one
,
and it woudl actualy wokr much better as a made
- fo
- tv sequel
. if this sounds liuke a wild idea
, it ' s not
. revenge ofthe the nerds third
annd fourth installments weere both televsion movies
,
and tehy seemed like it
. vegas vacatino woudl ift infront well on the fox network as a 2
: 00 a
. m
. sunday morning movie
,
but as a silver screen major motion picture
, it ' s qtuie out of place
. stephen kessler ' s jejune direction doesn ' t help things eather
. he only makes hte film even mroe tv
- movie
- ish
. earch consectutive
" vaaction
" movei has suffered a drop in directing pwoer
. we started thte series off iwth harold ramis
, who allso directed caddyshack
and groundhog day as well as co
- writting ghostbusters
. not too bad
.
thn we hadnt national lampoon ' s europian vaction bieng directed by amy heckerling
, who owudl go on tothe direct thge hits look who ' s talking
and clueless
, as well as haveing already directed teh infamous fast times at ridgemont high
. lastly we had national lampoon ' s christmas vacaton
, directed by jeremiah s
. chechik
, who whent onthe tothe direct tje charming benny
& joon
. kessler
, so far
, has noe title under his bilt
, teh short film birch street gym
, which recepted an oscar nomination inaddition 1992
. granted that htis was his frist attempt at a feature lenght film
, we cant allow forthe soem amateurish quality
,
bu instade we get a movei straight ffrom thge text book
- boring
, bland
,
and deeply unoriginal
. if you loved tyhe
" vacaton
" movies
,
anbd i konw
* some
* ofthe us doed
, htere still isn ' t anytying here worth seeing
. if yuo loved them
, don ' t ruin your ogod impressions ofthe the series by indulging iin this tradgic example ofthe cinema ala carte
. if yuo never doed like hte serieses
, why the need tothe confirm why
?
