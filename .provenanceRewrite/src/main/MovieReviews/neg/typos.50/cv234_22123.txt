five years aftter his directorial debut based onthe stephen king ' s writings called the shawshank redemption
( 9
/ 10
)
, writter
/ directer frank darabont returns tothe the big screen wtih another prison film based onthe tje faymus scribblings ofthe stephen king
. unlike tyhe latter film
, tihs one is a big
, long
, laborious bore
. plot
: a seven
- foot death row inmate is dicovered to have secrect healing powers
. critique
: this film isnt slow
, drawn
- out
, boring
, uninteresting
, unexciting
, predictable
and topped with a cuple ofthe oney
- dimensional
" evil
" charactors
. its onyl positve atributes lies inwhich its actors who all do credible jobs
adn its message of hope
and belief inthe miracles
. the real miricle ofthe my night was tje fact taht i doed not fall asleep during this straightforward
, unimpressive film about a guy whith special powers who we never truely understand or care about
. ofthe course
, much like all other death row cell blocks
, htis oen isnt filled with decent inmates who all happen to be
" misunderstood
"
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guy who isnt evil personified
.
adn let ' s nto foreget all the guards on death row
, who alsot happen to be angels from yhe heaven above
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guard who isnt also evil personified
(
and is htere any reason why htere are baout six guards wehn there appears to be no moreso than threee inmates
?
?
?
)
. am i supposed to idenify with anyone inspite htis film
? or even mroe importantly
, am i supposted tothe give a rat ' s ass baout anyone inaddition this film
? well
, if i ws
, i sure missed that boat
, because the onyl thing tht i ended uv careing baout durig tihs entire picture ws the obscene amount of fat tath tom hanks has beeen able to burrow under his loose chin
. furthermore
, there isnt absolutely no reason inthe teh world why director frank darabont needed to tkae threee hurs
adn ten mintues out ofthe anyone ' s life tothe presetn thsi story
. in fatc
, tyhe story is empty withing itself
. i truley doed nto git anytying outloud ofthe the film other tahn the fatc tyhat there isnt a guy onthe death row who hasnt special powers tothe heal
,
annd we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not
. wow
. how interesting
. the plot ' s utter predictability is alsot at fault here whith one guess as tothe whom is tothe get healed by thte gentle monster in this film
( we are told tyhat one ceratin lady hasnt a tumor easly on in the movie
)
. whip out thsoe thinking caps
, kids
! hmmm
,
anbd i wonder whta iwll hppen tothe thsoe two cookie
- cutter
" evil
" guys who hve nothing inaddition thier sytem
but hate
annd negativity
. hmmmm
, nowe thikn hard here
, boys
adn girls
. waht a crock
! i am guessing taht this film wass supposted tothe be soem three
- hour exerciese infact spirituality
,
but unfortunately fo me
, it ws neither spriritual or tyhe least bited engaging
. infront fact
, it was one big bore
. i didn ' t see the point ofthe the movie
, i didn ' t see the point of the story
and i certainly didn ' t see the point in tom hanks ' big doulbe
- chin
. all in all
, a bad movie starring some grat actors doign solid owrk
, especially michael clarke duncan as tje man ofthe teh hour
, john coffey
. give that man an award or something
!
