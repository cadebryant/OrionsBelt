convetional wisdom among collectibles retailers is tht childrens ' s items beign tothe dramatically escalate inaddition price about twenty
- five or thirty years affter tjhe item was made
. that ' s when yhe kids ofthe that time haev jobs
, disposable income
and a desire to re
- visit the awe
and wonderment of childhood that has disapeared from their lives
. check out yhe prices of toys fomr the late sixties
annd you ' ll find tht yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks
. there ' s a hevy nestolgia nowadays for tyhe lite sixties
and early seventies
annd nowhere isnt it mroe apparent thna on hte big screen
. boomers are nowe mostly infront theri forties
adn fifties
anbd have lieved in the work
- a
- day world fo a long time
. htey ' d like to re
- capture smoe ofthe thta fun htey rember ffrom days ofthe yore
. hollywood seems more thna eager to churn out product tothe halp them
. directors are zealous to put thier stamp onthe icons ffrom that time
.
and for the most part htey ' re messing it uv
.
" mission impossible
"
,
" lost in space
"
,
" godzilla
"
,
" zorro
"
. none of these successully capture yhe originals
. none ofthe these are even good films
. ytou can nowe add
" teh avengers
" tothe thte list
. yhe british television series began in 1961
. super secret agent john steed
(
hten
- patrick macnee
)
and his thrid partner
, emma peel
(
then
- diana rigg
) are tyhe pair that the american audience fell for
. surrealistic
adn witty
, hte series ift tje mood of tje times
. hte leather
- cladded rigg probably didn ' t hurt the ratings either
. after all it ' s nto a coinsidence that you cant ' t pronounce her charcter ' s name without
" appeal
"
. nowe we ' re inspite the ninties
. steed
( now
- ralph fiennes
)
and peel
( now
- uma thurman
) are battling evil genuis sir august de wynter
( sean connery
) who is screwing witht england ' s weather
. that ' s baout as much of a plot as we have
. htere ' s some footage about a lot ofthe other things thgat either don ' t make sense or mkea even less sence
. we git betrayal fo smoe unkown reason
. evil clones appear
and vanish
adn have noone connection tothe the film
. remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns infront their belly cmo fomr nowhere fo noone good reason
. htere ' s a high tech hot air balloon
,
but i have noone idea why anyone ' s in it
. the spy agency isnt run by a man called
" mother
" who is in a wheelchair
and a woman named
" father
" who is blind
.
.
. at least in smoe scenes
. there ' s probablly a reason for all ofthe thsi
,
bu we ' ll never nkwo it
. macnee mkaes an appeareance ofthe sorts
. he isnt the voice forthe an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing
. a gropu of villains sist aroud a tabel
, all clad inwhich huge pastel
- colored teddy bear outfits
. at frist it ' s hmuorous to watch thte teddies waddle around
,
bu
hten it becomes goofy
. the movei isnt a medley ofthe clutter
, confusion
and wrong descisions around every corner
. it feels like major portions of the film are missing
. the storyline jumps rether than flows
. reportadly hte film ws re
- cut several times
. htis is one ofthe those times where thge wohle is less thna the sum of the parts especialy since some of the parts apeared to be missing
. ther ' s oen ogod point where peel isnt running ffrom one room to another in a house designed by escher
. other than that
, the effects are second
- rate
. the weathr threat is ood hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes
. thurman alomst mkaes an adaquit emma peel
bu it doesn ' t wokr
. she looks ogod
, dresses in all yhe right fetish outfits
but ther ' s no spark
. fiennes farse even less well
. macnee ' s steed was a witty man ofthe the world witht a sence of humor
. fiennes ' agent comes across as a dour kid inwhich grown
- up clothes who hasnt never been outloud ofthe his hmeo twon
. even connery
, one of thte greatest living actors
, doesn ' t have much of a presence outside of a faw feiry scenes
. the action scenes are difficult tothe follow
. director jeremiah chechik
( responsable fo the atrocious remake ofthe
" diabolique
"
) somehow manages to put teh camera exactly where it shouldn ' t be
. thigns happen
, people move aroud
,
bu even if
, withthe the upmost effort
, ytou weere able tothe care baout any of it
, thge scenes are bewildering
. teh primary allure of thte origional was the interaction between the twpo leads
. witty banter
and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination
. admitedly htere are a few humorou sexual puns in teh film
,
bu htere ' s noone chemistry
anbd the repartee is anything
bu clever
. one ofthe emma peel ' s first lines of dialog is
" rules are made tothe be broken
.
" it doesn ' t get any better
. advance owrd alone shoud have been enough tothe scare off anyone
. the realease date was changed several times
. connery refuses tothe promote tje film
. ther ws no screening for critics which may have been a ogod choice forthe warner brothers
. at least this way
, they get something of an audeince forthe the firt weekend befor tghe news gets out
. admittedly i haven ' t seen an episode of the televsion serieses for a cuple of decades
. my guess isnt that it owudl be severly dated nowe
. no matter how antiquated it might be
, htere ' s noone dout that it holds up better thna thsi film is at first viewing
. there ' s noone reason tothe waste any part ofthe the last few days ofthe summer inside watching this movie
. noone reason at all
.
