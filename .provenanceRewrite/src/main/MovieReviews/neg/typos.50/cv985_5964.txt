boy
, what a grat movie
!
! keanu reeves
adn morgan freeman acting toghether
, tghe directer ofthe thte fugitive
( andrew davis
) back again to give us another thriller
,
and yhe beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown inspite to boot
. how sould this not be a blockbuster
? all die
- hard keanu reeves fans
, read onthe
. ol
" much ado baout nothing
" plays eddie kasalivich
, a machinist studing at the university ofthe chicago
. tothe halp pay fo the rent
, he tkaes on htis job making thte machinery fo a hydrogen project being conducted by the university
. by happy coinsidence
, he also happens to stumble onthe the solution tothe the fianl probelm
adn thus is tyhe onyl one who knows thge key to performing this feat ofthe miricle phsyics
. thsi project holds great promise
: taking hydrogen from water
and giving out moreso energy than isnt put inwhich
. a potential solution tothe thte earth ' s energy problems without tjhe polution cost
. surelly nobody could have any problems wih that
? morgan freeman isnt paul shannon
, the project ' s sponser
. he works for a very powerfull organization that disagrees with tje paternal project leader as to how quickly tecnology should be released to thge public
. he figures tje world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results ofthe yhe project are released too quicklyu
. so he murders thte project leader
, blows uv hte project
( great
but short scene here
, sort of like a mini id4 city
- devistation thing
)
and trys to simulate the experiment at soem otehr hi
- tech hush
- hush location
. unfortunatly
, our intrepid machinist
and an english physisist
( weisz
) manage tothe get away
and now follows a fugitive
- liek chase useing a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script
. htis movie isnt just dying for a compairison wtih
" yhe fugitive
"
. both movies use chicago as yhe main city
anbd since tghe palce doesn ' t chanage much
, i guess we cxan ' t realyl blame the setting for the paucity ofthe atomsphere
. tghe trouble here isnt tyhat where tje fugitive hadnt harrison ford
adn tommy lee jones
, chain reaction only hasnt keanu reeves
and fred ward
. credit tothe them
,
bu we aren ' t really given much ofthe a chance to empathise wtih teh charachters
. where ford was able tothe work within the confines of thge movei to envoke simapthy
, eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem veyr believeable
and reeves ' chracter isnt never given tyhe time tothe develop
. it might have been a better investment iin film tothe give the characters omre depth
and spend less tyme onthe the chase sequences
, wich frankly
, get qtuie boring affter a while
. harrison ford ws
" the man against the world
.
" he was alone in a world where he didn ' t know who tothe trust
annd it cameback accros real well
. infront chain reaction
, keanu reeves isn ' t alone
. now that owudl be fine if tje fleeing cuple hadnt smoe chemistry
annd could really portray smoe paranoia
, vulnerability
annd confusion
. we don ' t get htis
. we git him thinking he ' s still in speed
, onyl now our sandra bullock has an english accent
, probablly doesn ' t drive a bus
,
annd hardly contibutes anything tothe tyhe movie
. the producers here probablly thought
,
" hey
, waht if keanu
and rachel don ' t hit it off too well
? let ' s rope infact tyhat morgan to help us out
.
" well
, keanu
and rachel didn ' t hitted it off well onthe the screen
,
and most unfortunately
, morgan freeman doesn ' t halp much eather
. hte onyl thing we come to really knwo of paul shannon is thta he allways hasnt a full load of cigars infront his cigar holder
. it ' s not really his fault
. once again
, andrew davis jstu doesn ' t take the time to build his characters
. somene must ahev conviced him tht htis timne round
, cinema dollars are best earned by making tje movie run like a headless chicken
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stfuf
.
*
*

*
* prefection
. see it twice
