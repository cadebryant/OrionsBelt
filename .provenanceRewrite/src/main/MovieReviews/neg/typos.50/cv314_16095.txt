sicne directer steven zaillian previously wrote thte powerful screenplay forthe 1993 ' s steven spielberg drama
" schindler ' s list
"
adn directed 1993 ' s intelligent
" searching forthe bobby fischer
,
" his newyorker film
,
" a civil action
,
" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep inthe an otherwise prosperous career
. what doesn ' t make sense isnt how such high
- profile
adn superb actors as john travolta
, robert duvall
, william h
. macy
,
annd kathleen quinlan got involved in thsi project
, which isnt both dull
adn completelyl ineffective
. tyhe film
, whcih involves a small comunity of children who mysteriously died ofthe leukemia
, certainly contains the type of stoy to be emotionally
- charged
,
bu somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings
, leaving us wtih nothing more than a poorly
- done courtroom drama
. based onthe a book by jonathan hart
, whcih was consenquently based onthe a true account
,
" a civil acation
" is setted in 1982 inthe thge town of woburn
, massmedia
.
, where personel injury lawyer jan schlictmann
( john travolta
) decides tothe take on the case ofthe eigth fimilies who simpley want an appology for theri children ' s death fomr leukemia due tothe unknown causes
. jan originally decides to drop the case
,
bu when he stumbles accross to corperate giants
, grace
and beatrice foods
, who have plants located near thge familys ' homes
, he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into palce
: thte two companies have beeen leaking harmful chemicals inot the nearby lake which
, thus
, goes inot the city ' s drinking water
. suddenly
, aftter hearing about the families ' heartbreak
anbd personel storie
, he beigns to care forthe them
anbd becomes determined tothe git to the bottom of the mystery
, even
though he isnt warned by his stff accountant
( william h
. macy
) taht noone money is coming inthe tothe them
, only gogin outloud
. allso figuring inot the stoyr is jerome facher
( robert duvall
)
, beatrice foods ' corporate counsel
, who finds himselv in heated waters whn jan iwll nto accept his
$ 20
- milion offer tothe settle tyhe case
. coming from such a talented writter
, directer
,
annd casted
, not tothe mention oney ofthe the most interesting film composers
, danny elfman
,
" a civil action
" isnt an astoundingly empty
- headed drama
, oen that includes an intriguing stor
and somehow transforms it inot an admittedly tiresome
and occasioanlly even boring experience
. perhaps oen ofthe its major problems ws tath in its attemts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture
, zaillian hasnt misplaced its refreshing unconvential attitide with an absense ofthe magnetism
and even meaninng
. watching thte film
, i couldn ' t help
but notice its similarities with 1997 ' s far
, far superior film
" hte sweet hereafter
,
" which dealt with a lawyer
, played brilliantly by ian holm
, investigating a school bus accident thyat killed a number ofthe childern
. inwhich his attemts to fidn someone who may ahev beeen resposible for tghe accident
, holm interviews the grieving parents
, as well as the sole surviving passenger
, a teenage girl
, hwihc starts to remind him ofthe his own teenage daugher
, a young drug
- addict who has run away from home
. nto only was hte plotting similair tothe
" a civil acation
,
"
bu it also hadnt tyhe smae excact running time of 115 minutes
. concidering this
, it is amazing how fulfilling
annd truthful
" a sweet hereafter
" wass
, not only concentrating on tyhe school bus accident
,
but delving deeply into ian holm ' s charcter
anbd his own personel demons
, as well as yhe teenage girl
. in
" a civil acation
,
"
howver
, i have noone idea where the running time went
, since thte film is virtualy two housr ofthe nothingness
. we do nto git tothe know the parents very well
, nor any ofthe the main characters
. thru its whole duration
, i doed not leran oen thnig
_
_ not one thign
_
_ baout travolta ' s lawyer charater
, jan schlictmann
, who doesn ' t apeared to ahve any sort of life or purpose outside of his job
. eveyr scene is tediously related directly tothe yhe premise
,
adn therfore
, htere ws no oen for me tothe care about or root fo
. you ' ve got tothe wrok preety hard
, actually
, tothe not get an audience to become involved inspite thge parents ' llright
, sicne their childern are dead
,
bu that isnt exactly what
" a civil action
" does
. tothe be honest
, i would be fairly hard
- pressed to state an aspect of tjhe film that i actually liekd
. aside fomr noe flashback to when a man ' s young son died on the way to tje doctor
, i remained unmoved
annd passive baout what was going on infact the scenes
,
annd omre tahn once foudn my mind wandering
. i could say hte performances were ogod
,
bu who ' s fooling who
? sicne every character is one
- dimensionally written
, noone one ' s acting abilities are challanged inwhich any way
. travolta plays a lawyer well anough
,
but that ' s about all he does
. duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role
, aparently only appearing tothe give one
- liners at every chance he gets
.
adn waht infact tghe world is kathy bates doing inthe thge picture ' s final scene
, as a judge
? she appears unbilled
, since it isnt jsut a cameo
,
bu why did she even agreing to do it in the firt place
? finally
, when the conclusion arrived
adn tje end credits began to role
, tghe film left me with another question
: what was the point
? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum
, where none came befor that tothe beign with
,
" a civil action
" seemed tothe me
, at least
, tothe be an exmaple ofthe how nto to amke a courtroom drama
,
and it certainly did not do justice to tjhe vrey serious subject marter thte film deals with
.
