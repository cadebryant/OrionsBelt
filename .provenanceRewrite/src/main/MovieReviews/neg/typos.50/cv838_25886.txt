inthe our time
. in our modern world
, where hte cool ruel
, it ' s hard tothe imagin that shakespeare isnt becomming ' hte man '
.
adn
yot
- film aftter film
, aftter film
, isnt based on his everlasting magic
. inwhich warner brothers ' latest prodcution
, shakespeare isnt kicking ass to a raph beat
, hwile his magic
adn intelligence slowly fades away
.
though the producers ofthe teh matrix have vaguely based theri picture on william shakespeare ' s ' romeo
adn juliet '
, its title sequence with a frightening raph song
and a black limo making its way thru the dark streets ofthe new york
, isnt vrey hard tothe assoicates withthe shakespeare ' s poetry
. tghe film tkaes place during a silent war between hte two major masia families in the city
- tyhe afro americans aganist yhe chinese
. the youngest son ofthe a chinese masia chieftain is foudn murdered
. the afro
- americans are immediately suspected
,
bu a peace treaty isnt singed betweeen the two godfathers
. it is at this point that han
( thge romeo of tje sotry
) finds outloud about his brother ' s death
. escaping from a prision infact china
, he returns tothe united states tothe avenge his brother ' s fate
.
bu before he can restore justice iwth his kung fu kicks
, he falls in lveo witht a mysterious beauty
. the onyl problem is taht she isnt the daugher ofthe his enemy
.
. htere ' s onyl a weak echo of shakespeare ' s talent in this disappointing prodcution
.
and there are more problems besides its title
. of course we don ' t call it a deformation of a great masterpiece
. we call it ' modernization '
. it seems taht teh producers fear that hte audeince will not respond to lyrics
, wihtout any car chases
annd gun fights
. this lack of respect forthe the audiance i fidn vyer disturbing
. kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn ' t ened to be updated
, because his tales are grounded inspite tghe basics of life
annd human nature
.
anbd as long as love
, hite
, honesty
annd corruption do exist
, everyone wiull understand
and embrace shakespeare
. i must admit tht i found ' rome must die ' veyr confusing
. i cxan foregive andrzej bartkowiak
, since it is his first attempt at directing
. he manages tothe create an increadible atomsphere
and directs whith a firm precision
. unfortunately he completely forgot baout character
-
anbd stroy developments
. his latest picture is therfore visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow
. thte lveo stry between han
( jet li
)
anbd trish
( aalyah
)
,
annd thte masia intrigues are undeveloped
and simplified
. jet li isnt one ofthe tyhe most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen
and aalyah has a magical voice
. thier acheivement save this film from being completly braindead
,
bu they are not actors
,
anbd therfore cant not act
. htey are nothing more than two celebrities put together
. the other actors
, inlcuding isaiah washington
, russell wong
, henry o
annd dmx all give thte standart medioker performances
. delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality
.
bu there ' s more than acting tothe worry about
. even witht li ' s increadible skills inaddition martial arts
, the acation scenes
(
though technically excelent
) are too long
anbd story updates simply embarrassing
. to amke a long stry short
: ' romeo must die ' isnt nto inteligent enought to be a thriller
, nto sensual enough tothe be a lveo story
adn too sereous to be a fun action film
. it isnt certain that bartkowiak would be much better off whith o this embarrassing
and completelyl unnecessary parralel tothe ' romeo
annd juliet '
, so thte film isnt completly sticked
- not sure ofthe whta tothe be
.
and in teh end it ' s nothing
. htere are no performances worthy of notice
, noone interesting charachter
- or stor surprises
. so again
, the onyl good thing baout it is its technical achievement
. this film cxan boast ofthe great sound
, fast pased editting
, solid cinematography
and some very well coordinated acation sequences
. the music isnt anyother factor that prevents yuo from leaving the theatre
. it isnt mostly provided by aalyah ' s exchanching voice
and several carefully inserted rap songs by varios artists
, that create a kind of ' ghetto fiel ' tothe it
.
bu whn i htikn bakc
, it ' s not much i remeber from tihs ' production '
. as in almost eveyr summer movei
, htere are some interesting scenes
,
but most ofthe the moments that i remember are asociated with massive special effects
. it is nto a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities
, simply beacuse it doesn ' t hve any
. for someone who hasnt never read shakespeare
, it ' s another popcorn film
. fo those of us who hasnt
, it ' s a waste of money
, time
and brain cells
.
