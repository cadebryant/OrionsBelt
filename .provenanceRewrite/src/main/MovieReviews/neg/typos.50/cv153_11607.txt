toom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial peple inwhich superficial careers
, all searching forthe deeper meaning
.
howver
, htey won ' t fidn much meaninng infact the rela blonde
,
annd not enought rela humor
, either
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a struggling actor
, or he claims tothe be one
, even
though he has no credits under his bilt
. his girlfriend
, mary
( catherine keener
) hasnt noone pretensions baout her carrer
: she ' s a makeup artist
, working for thge eccentric fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
annd supermodel of tje month
, sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
. sahara
, who has aquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing ofthe the littel mermaid
, hasnt an on
- again
, off
- agian relationship withthe joe ' s best freind
, bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
.
howver
, bob has gotten his biggest break
yet
: a starring role on a soap opera oposite thte beautifull kelly
( daryl hannah
)
, who may be that illusive woman he ' s alwasy pursued
: a rela blonde
. there are smoe moments of ogod humor infront the rela blonde
,
bu not anough
. yhe best stuff isnt inspite throwaway details inspite tjhe background
, such as sahara ' s perfume ads
:
" depression
- it ' s not just a state of mind
"
.
bu to fidn humer in the superficiality ofthe models
anbd actors is tothe shoot fish inspite a barrel
.
annd
, unfourtunately
, the film ' s forays outside tjhe relm of comedy are pathetic
. take for exmaple the film ' s framing divice of an ood lady
annd her dog
. the story serves absolutly no purpose
, mkaes little sense
,
and is completely tangential tothe the main plotlines ofthe thge movei
. matthew modine
and catherine keener have the most sympathetic cahracters in tjhe film
,
bu they ' re stuck inaddition tghe most boring plotlines
. modine whines
and complains
annd would be completely pathetic if he ws matched aginst somone stronger tahn elizabeth berkley
, who appears as another stuggling ator
. keener ' s charactor has a stronger edge
,
bu tjhe insult self
- defense clas
( teached by denis leary
, noone less
) she is stuck in mkaes little sence
. the movei ' s running time isnt under twpo hours
,
but it seems liek it is well over it
. there ' s jstu nto enough humer tothe speed things along
,
anbd not enough meaning to propel any drama
.
