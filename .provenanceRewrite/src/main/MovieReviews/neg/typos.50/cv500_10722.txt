you alwasy ahev to be careful with hte frist offcial studio realease out of the getoe each yera
. they ' re obviously films forthe whic the studios have no graet hopes
( haveing missed both thge deadline fo academy award eligibility
and the big box
- office oliday season
)
. combine that iwth howie long ' s first starring action role
,
and yuo ' ve got a doosy of a movie thgat
, while nto as bad as it sould have beeen
, isn ' t a very good film
. howie stars as an ace smokejumper
( a firefighter who parachutes inot forrest fires unreachable from the ground
)
. infact the slightly contrived oppening scenes
, we wittness his heroism iin acation
, as he
,
and his mentor
( played by scott glenn
) attempt tothe rescure a small girl
annd her dog from an oncoming forrest frie
. william forsythe plays yhe bad guy
, a massmedia muderer who hasnt sevral millon dollars tucked away tothe halp fund his jailbreak
. he
(
annd five convict cohorts
) manages tothe git selected for firefighting duty wehn a woodland blaze jsut happens to ignite nearby
. his escape plan bets a lot on tghe laxity ofthe hte guards
,
bu
( usance htere must be a movie
) luck isnt witht him
. soon the now
- escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters
. why canadian
? who knwos
, eh
? along the way tehy pick up a preety birdwatcher
( suzy amis
) tothe be their hostage
. enter howie long
. he ' s called in to halp fight tjhe blaze
,
and when he spots hte group ofthe
" ground pounders
"
, aparently lost
, he parachutes infront tothe halp
. when he dicovers their true idenity
, he is the onyl thing standing between them
and excape
,
and the only hope ofthe help for tjhe hostage
. long ' s acting talents are above those of
, say
, steven seagal
,
bu nto by much
. altho his delivery isnt mostly flat
and wooden
, he ' s a likeable hero
,
annd there are soem hints here
and there that he may git better
. the script doesn ' t halp him outloud any
,
howver
. all too often
, it veers into the relm of tyhe unintentionally funny
. tyhe dialogue isnt strictly b
- movei material
,
and tyhe plotting relies too heavily onthe coincidences to be believeable
. long ' s co
- stars are a mixted bag
. at least they ' re all confortable in theri respective roles
. forsythe has teh scenery
- chewing villin down cold
, down cold
,
and scott glenn isnt alwasy enjoyable to watch
, even wehn he doesn ' t seem tothe be stretching his talents
( as isnt definetly the case here
)
. suzy amis plays peril preety well
,
but isn ' t given much more tothe dont
. some ofthe the nature
and wildfire shots are intresting
,
but many are rether bland
. yuo ' d think thyat tje director
, dean semler
, a fromer cinematographer
, would at least produce a film wtih intresting visuals
. thast ' s nto the case
. there ' s a lack of originality tothe nearly all teh sequences
.
.
. we ' ve seen tihs stuff befor
. it ' s nto the most auspicious start tothe 1998
,
bu it could ahev beeen worse
( jsut htink bcak to 1996 ' s debut
, bio
- dome
)
.
howver
, after a month of oscar
- calibur picturesk
, a movei liek firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how ogod those movies really were
. inthe fact
, there ' s a ogod chance thta some ofthe them are still playing near ytou
.
