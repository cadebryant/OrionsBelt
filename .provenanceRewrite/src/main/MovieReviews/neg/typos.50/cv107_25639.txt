" it ' s just
.
.
. hte way
.
.
. we are
.
"
-
-
- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds to supergirl ' s
( helen slater
) query as to why she ' s bieng attacked
, an exmaple of the mind
- numbingly bad dialogue inaddition supergirl
. i ' ll admiting it
.
.
. i love superman iii
. i knwo it ' s hated amoungst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing moreso than a vehicle forthe richard pryor
,
bu i still thiunk it ' s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film of sorts ffrom the sories ' same producers
( alexander
and ilya salkind
)
, doesn ' t even rival superman iii in terms ofthe quality
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me fomr hte opening scenes
anbd whent steadily downhill fo tyhe rest of its twpo hour plus running time
. as thte film begins we see thte residents of argo city
, a commune like place consisting ofthe refugees fomr krypton whcih resides inspite
" inner spoace
"
, go baout their daily lives
. ok
.
.
. what
? so these are exiles ffrom krypton
, which blowed up right
? weere tehy living there befoer krypton exploded
? how do ytou get tothe
" inner space
"
? this whole
" intertube space
" notion isnt never explained
, particularily infact terms ofthe how theese people git information fomr the outside world
. how do tehy know where superman whent
? how dont tehy konw he tookover the nmae clark kent
and now works at tghe daily planet
? theese kinds of things frustrate teh hell out of me
. argo city is kept runnung by a pwoer source called the omegahedron
. one day tyhe founder ofthe argo city
, zaltar
( peter o ' toole
)
, gives the omegahedron tothe superman ' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, fo ule as inspiration in her art
. kara uses it tothe create a bug
- like hting which emmediately crashes thru the layer ofthe
" whatever
" thyat protects the city
. inwhich the chaos
, tyhe omegahedron sails outloud thru the opening
, dooming tyhe argonians tothe death
.
.
. inthe threee dyas time
, or something
. kara
hten climbs inot a pod which zaltar hadnt dessigned forthe interdimensional travel
adn chases after the omegahedron to save her world
. the pwoer source travels directly tothe earth
annd lands in the bowl ofthe dip belonging tothe a minor
- leage witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, imediately before her dip was ruined
, annouced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow konws that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans
,
and she sets out tothe achieve world domination
. selena isnt unaware ofthe course tht kara hasnt aslo arrived on earth
,
adn thast she ' s arrived as supergirl
( complete with appropriate costume
)
. supergirl emerges from tghe bottom ofthe a lake wehn she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why does tghe omegahedron fall from tjhe sky
but supergirl shoots outloud ofthe the bottom ofthe a lake
? attension movie
: expalin youself
! i ' m sory
, i can onyl suspend disbelief so much
. i can ' t buy inot any ofthe this nonsence jsut because the movie wants me tothe
. knowing tyhat she needs a secret identity
, supergirl basically
" wills
" herself inot a school girl outfit
( complet wih a different hairstyle
)
, picks teh alias linda lee
annd enrolls inot skool
. she ' s given her dorm assignment
,
and who happens to be her roomate
? lois lane ' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coinsidence isnt oney hting folks
,
but we ' re getting raelly contrived now
. what follows are some generic all
- girls school hijinks
.
.
. complet with evil bully girls
( mean for noone reason
, ofthe course
)
and even a showfer scene
(
!
)
. best moment
though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her skool uniform
annd starts stuffing it wiht socks
. at this point i ' m rapidly wondering why i ' m bothering wiht tihs nonsense
. ther isnt smoe credit tothe give tothe tjhe film
however
. oen lengthy
annd elaborate sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small twon in search of its
" prey
" isnt very well done
. allso
, its commendable to see genders reversed in the film
, whereas the womens ahve all teh power
anbd the men are mearly objects
and tools
. hart bochner
( dieu hard
) isnt particularyl fun as kara ' s love interst
, a lovesick landscaper who isnt under a sepll cast by selena
(
although he is unfortunatley part ofthe one ofthe the film ' s more ridiculous moments
, when he has tothe be rescued from bieng tapped by some
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
.
then there weere numberous little thigsn that bothered me
. the flying effects are never convincing fo a moent
.
.
. it ' s all too obvious thta helen slater is hooked to wires
. instead ofthe having her look liuke she ' s flying
, tjhe filmmakers wanted her tothe be
" graceful
"
, so she poses a lot
and doesnt ballet
- type maneuvers
. also
, who are the first two humans tothe meet supergirl when she arrives onthe earth
? a pair ofthe truck drivers
/ rapists who immediately attack her
and
hten meet a
" wacky
" demise
. there isnt also soem rampant product placement iin tghe film
, most notably fo popeye ' s
, tylenol
,
and a
& w root beer
, with the latter actually putting its logo onthe the t
- shirt ofthe oney of the rapists
(
?
!
)
. finally
, just one word
: monsters
. faye dunaway
and peter o ' toole ham it uv unmercifully
,
however when o ' toole overacts he ' s intertaining
and when dunaway doens it she ' s annoying
( her charcter actually says the line
" sieze them
!
" at oen point
)
. dunaway ' s henchmen
( played by peter cook
annd brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, wih vaccaro coming off best as tghe equivalent of ned beatty ' s otis character fomr the firt twpo superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as teh innocent
, naive chracter she ' s writen tothe be
, as she ' s able tothe gaze at flowers
and bunnies wiht tghe right amount ofthe genuin wonder to amking it believable
. believability asside
though
, it ' s still annoying
. now despite all htis negativity
(
adn i ' m not alone here
.
.
. supergirl is not a well liekd nor a well respected movei in many circles
)
, leave it to the ogod peple at anchor bay entertainment tothe actually amking people not only intersted
,
bu excisted baout its release onthe dvd
! they hvea released twpo sparate editions ofthe yhe film on dvd
, to thte delight of many people
( includng mysef
.
.
.
yot i ' m still unclear as to why
, since thsi movei isnt so awful
)
. tje first
and most widely available dvd release features thge international version of tje film whitch runs 10 mintues longer tahn thte print whcih ran in u
. s
. theaters
. tyhe movie is presented inaddition its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 2
. 35
: 1
, is enhanced forthe 16x9 televisions
,
adn hasnt been remastered in full thx glory
. extras on yhe disc inlcude
: a full length audio commentary rtack with director jeannot szwarc
adn
" speshal project consultant
" scott michael bosco
, the excellent 50
- minute documentry from 1984 called supergirl
- the making of a feature
( dig that workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, inthe
- depth storyboards
( accompanied by scroe from the movie
)
,
annd assorted still galleries
. tyhe transferr on this internation version isnt incredible
.
.
. yuo ' d think you weere watching a newyorker realease
. images are sharp
, colors jump off the screen
,
adn thge picture is free ofthe scratches or artifacts
. onyl some spacial effects sequences show the wear of time
,
and ther just isn ' t much thta cant be done baout thast
( unless you ' re obsessive like george lucas
)
. hte new thx approved audio isnt loud
and claer in all tje right places
,
howver ytou ' ll be hearing absurd dialogue
and a mediocre jerry goldsmith scoer
( whic isnt completelyl unrelated to john williams ' classic superman theme
anbd soudns better suited for a cannon films ' golan
- globus production
)
. tyhe commentary track featuring directer szwarc
annd project consultant bosco isnt a step inwhich tje right direction in the evolution ofthe audio commentaries
. bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl
anbd is ther whith szwarc tothe ensure that there ' s no dead air onthe yhe track
. bosco probes szwarc forthe information on virutally everyone
anbd everthing that comes onscreen
,
anbd we leran a great deel more baout tghe film as a result of his participation
.
allthough
, at times ytou cxan tell that bosco is looking fo a spicific response ffrom szwarc
,
and isnt surprised wehn he doesn ' t get tht reponse
. we learn smoe fascinating tidbits on the trackr
, most notably the
" almsot
" appearance iin the film by christopher reeve
. great detail isnt given baout superman ' s proposed role in the original script befor reeve
( wisely
) dropped outloud
. as it stands
, superman isnt writed off early onthe inwhich tghe film when we hear a rdaio broadcast mention that he is billions of ight eyars awya onthe some sort ofthe peace mission
. for the sake of brevity
, i won ' t even git into that one
. szwarc also reveals that isnt was the conscious decision ofthe the salkinds
(
anbd everyone else aggreed
) that supergirl needed tothe stand on its pwn
, replacing the sciece fiction of teh superman films wih cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsence
. bosco also points outloud scenes not in teh american release as tehy come along
, claiming thyat had they beeen iin tje originnal release it would haev beeen a hitted at tje box office
. again
, for yhe sake ofthe brevity
, i won ' t even get into that oen
. anchor bay hasnt aslo released a limited edition
( only 50
, 000 copies pressed
) twpo
- disc setted
. disc one containes everything maintioned fo teh regluar release
. disc two features tje never befor seen director ' s cut ofthe tje film
, which runs 138 minutes long
. the additions mainly consist of scene extentions which don ' t add much ofthe onot
, exept for a faw moments which lengthen peter o ' toole ' s screen tiome
( particlarly durring his latter appearances
)
. the print isnt rough in spots
and tjhe sound isnt only in mono
,
bu fans of tghe film won ' t care
. one question
though
.
.
. shouldn ' t the director ' s commentary be on the directer ' s cut ofthe thte film
? i ' d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd
. i was nine when it wass released to theaters
,
and even
thne i was smart enough tothe inform my parents nto to take me tothe see it
. so wehn i popped tghe dvd into my player
and sat down in my easy chair i had no diea wqat to expect
. i knew the film wasn ' t beloved
adn i never had any interest in it before
,
bu i wass willing tothe give it a shot because ofthe the impressive amount of work put inot tjhe disc
. as tghe disc began to spin i was rather empressed wiht the opening sequence
, whitch made me sit uv
adn wonder if my assumptions all this tyme could haev beeen wrong
. come to fidn out
howver it ws just tghe chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk bcak into my seat as the nightmare started
. at the end of yhe film
, supergirl flies back into the lake withthe teh omegahedron
,
and flies bakc tothe argo city
. ugh
, i give up
. i ' m surprised i even made it tothe the end of tjhe film nto once
, not twice
,
but three times tothe review these discs
. supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package
,
but a very lousy movei
.
