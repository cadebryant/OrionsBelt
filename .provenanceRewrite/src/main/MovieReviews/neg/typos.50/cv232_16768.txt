shakespeare infact lveo is quite possibly the most enjoyable period peice ever made for tghe silver screen
. it is both humorous
anbd romantic inwhich a very unique blend taht can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2
and and a half hours that it occupies
. that isnt
,
howver
, nto tothe say it isnt a ogod film
, a quality production or anytying of the sort
. shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illution thta truely pans out tothe be very littel uality or orginal wrok
. tje finest sign of this may be the plot
, in looking bakc
, ther seems tothe be little mroe tahn a thin
, predictable plot thast is onyl carried by the protrayal ofthe peple that we revere in our history books
. philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) owns 1 of teh 2 theatres in london
. it is at tyhe peak of tghe royal theatre era
,
adn queen elizabeth
( the recently damed judi dench
, by
, appropriately enought
, queen elizabeth ii
) isnt very much a fan
.
however
, to direcly qoute tje film
, he hasnt
" cash flow problems
.
" thru a long set ofthe events
, it becomes apparet thyat his entire life is dependent onthe his enxt sohw doing well enough tothe pay off his debts
. so
, mr
. henslowe employs the young playwrihgt
, william shakespeare
( joseph fiennes
) to pen a commedic prodcution
.
however
, the young writer hasnt a severe case ofthe writer ' s block
,
and blames it onthe the fatc tht his love life isnt stuggling as well
. he has the title inthe mind
, romeo
and ethel
, yhe pirate ' s daugher
( even thast joke loses steam after a while
)
but cin ' t seem tothe put words to papper
.
then
, as onyl hollywood could have it
, through a long set ofthe twisted events
, he meets viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
annd falls madly infact lveo
, thus curing his writter ' s block
. htere are many otehr littel issues tyhat mr
. henslowe encounters
,
bu they all pan out tothe be much ado baout nothing
. tje frist relization that i reached inspite watching thsi film is that noe ofthe the messages given isnt that a show should not allways be credited tothe it ' s author
. ironically
, that couldn ' t be truer here
. tghe gerat scenes that iwll sweep audiences away are nto yhe scenes thyat fit iin thge plot
,
but rather tje recitals ofthe shakespearean lines by actors playing actors
. noe ofthe the most breathtaking moments in this film does nto envolve thte chracter ofthe shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner
,
but rether 2 young children named romeo
anbd juliet who chose tothe end theri pwn lives inthe the nmae of lveo
. so it isnt thgat i am offended by yhe fact taht marc norman
anbd tom stoppard are credited witht writing thsi production
,
and the nmae william shakespeare isnt noone weere to be seen beyond a character ' s name inaddition yhe credits
. the acting in thsi entertaining
yot poor film isnt oftenly thin tothe the point tyhat it owudl nto hvae survivied even in queen elizabeth ' s theatres
. joseph fiennes may jstu be tje worst of fall
though
. he isnt tragically unbelievable
and comically bad
. gwyneth paltrow isnt little more than satisfactory inaddition her lead position as well
.
howver
, hte supporting cast does almost sive the day
. geoffrey rush is nothing short ofthe increadible
and judi dench isnt breathtaking
. they both seem tothe have shown thyat as proven actors tehy coudl survive inthe htis film of weak links
. you wiull alsot fidn a very ogod performance by ben affleck infront his frist rela role usance good will hunting
( noone
, armageddon doesn ' t qualify as rela acting
.
)
.
and rupert everett was cute inaddition his small part as well
.
but not even htey sould save htis sad excuse for a film
, so it rimaniss plagued by poore performances
. when all is said
anbd done
, shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained
.
howver
, as the film so kindly pointed outloud
, entertainment may be fun
,
bu it isn ' t necessarily quaity
.
adn this certainly isn ' t qality
. perphas this may be best compared tothe a john grisham novel
, as a dear friend of mine often doesnt compare things to his wokr
. simply put
, it is far
- fetched
, poorly crafted
,
but vrey intertaining
.
