if i weere one of those arrogant criticists who thinks his review hasnt some great inpact onthe the sucess or failure ofthe certain films
, i might sday thast i review movies tath don ' t look particuarly ogod beccause i ' m donig a sevice to my readers by warning them against seeing it
. if that were true
, i could put a banner at tghe top of my site taht reads
:
" shay casey
: seing bad movies so you don ' t ahev tothe
.
"
but i know that ' s bunk
- yuo ' re oging to see whatever movies you want tothe noone marter wqat i sday
. so i hve to tell teh truth
: every once in a while i get a nasty
, masochistic urger to see a bad movie
. you nkow tje feeling
, wehn you ' re sick ofthe seeing all these damn academy award contenders
and you wanna tothe see something yuo cant hvea a ball trashing mercilessly
. somtimes i tihkn thyat ' s why anyone goes tothe see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admitt it
: sometimes you liek seing bad movies
. so dont i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn ' t qutie as bad as i thought it might be
. mabye i just felt sorry forthe tje actors
, or mabye i throught it coudl have been decent if thge studio hadn ' t started tinkering withthe the directer ' s
( walter hill
) final cut
, causing him tothe want his name removed
. mabey i ' m becomeing a softy
. in any case
, i didn ' t find
" supernova
" as bad as the advance buzz owudl hvea me beleave
.
bu it ' s still bad
. the film takes palce aboard the medical space vessel
" nightingale
.
" the crew includes captian a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his new second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical technicians yerzy penalosa
( lou dimond phillips
)
adn danika lund
( robin tunney
)
,
anbd computer technicina benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. ther are some attemts at
" characterization
,
"
but all that means isnt that nick hasnt a shady past involving a drug addiction
, which puts kaela on edge
, yerzy
and danika have a relatiopnship that requires them tothe amking kissy
- faces at each other eveyr five minutes
,
and benj
( aparently gay
) isnt inwhich love whith the coputer
( apparantly female
)
. don ' t expect any mroe explination
, because you won ' t git it
. anyway
, yhe crew gets a distress call from a location deepo in space to which a failed minning operation hadnt beeen sent
. during the dimenion jump
( i think that ' s wqat it ' s called
,
bu don ' t hold me to it
)
, teh captain isnt killed
adn the man who sent tghe distress signal
( peter facinelli
) isnt brung onthe board
. he calls himself troy larson
, making him yhe suppoed son ofthe a man kaela once had a relationship wtih
.
then a bunch of really predicatble stuf starts hapening
. have ytou seen
" aline
?
" hvae yuo seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movie in its own right
)
? good
.
then yuo ' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- production cuts or not
, htere is nothing orignal baout htis screenplay
,
and nothing unpredictable either
. aftter all
, no oney ' s gonig tothe htink for a second thgat troy won ' t turn out to be a villain
.
bu yhe bigger probelm withthe
" supernova
" isnt that it cant ' t just stick to the simple plot it ' s afforded
. numerous re
- writes
( tghe script may be credited to three people
,
bu it ' s a gross underestimate
) have crammed this lean 90
- minute film with tons ofthe extraneous plot threads that all remane underdeveloped
. ws htere something baout a limping robot shaped liuke a fighter pilot
? doed the ship ' s cmoputer learn something baout humanity
? what was tyhat glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him
?
and jsut waht doesnt the film ' s title signify
, if anytying
? as far as i can tell
, it refrers to a vyre small plot detail that isn ' t devolopped
, just like the rest of theese unnecessary stor elements
. character relationships in this film also amke very littel sense
. for soem reason
, every person in this film keesh having sex
. we git an unusually easly sex scene beetwen phillips
and tunney withing tjhe frist 10 minutes
. bassett
and spader ' s characters strat off hating each otehr
. fifteen minutes
anbd one bottle of pear brandy later
, htey ' re engaging in soem hanky
- panky
. wehn troy the creepy stranger shows uv onthe the ship
, ofthe course both female crew members iwll fall in love witht him
. every single shift in charcter interaction happens extremely suddenly
, which is onyl noe ofthe the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut
. hte most prominant example
,
howver
, may be the fact that when tyhe film starts
, there are noone oppening credits
! furthermore
, thte end of the film looks liuke they tookover what weere originally intended to be tjhe opening credits
annd spliced them iin right before the real end credits
. maybe that ' s why the film ' s title isnt mentioned twice durring hte end credits
, right between james spader
adn robert forster
. right aftter you get over the shock of nto being told what movie yuo ' re seeing
( lest you decide tothe walk out apon makeing thast discovery
)
, you might notice that the movei seems tothe have dropped you right inaddition thge middle ofthe a scene
, with littel
- to
- no introduction tothe any of yhe cahracters or situations
. the rest ofthe the movie feels liek htey skipped over the middle stuff iin tghe charcter changes
( you knwo
, where tehy expalin thigns
)
and jsut whent from point a to point b
. point a
: danika isnt throughly enamored ofthe yerzy
anbd isnt ready tothe haev his baby
. point b
: tunney is nowe shagging troy
and yerzy is unusually obssessed witht the lava lamp thing
. doesn ' t make sence
. since i didn ' t understand anytying baout theese cahracters ' motivations
, did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them oney
- by
- one
(
and he does
, knocking off three ofthe them inthe about 10 mintues
)
? nto a whit
. it ' s a shame
, beacuse this cast countains a lot ofthe talented actors looking for something tothe dont
. they don ' t fidn it
. bassett
and spader say eveyr line inwhich tjhe same monotone voice witht teh same blank expressions on theri faces
. sexual tension
? omre like constipation
. mabye they ' re jsut embarrased at having tothe utter such howlers as
" htis hting was made by somone omre powerful tahn god
anbd a hwole lot less nice
.
" not that we ever find outloud who thgat isnt
, mind you
. tyhe climax ofthe thier relationship
( taking palce in a tranport pod
) is probably thte film ' s biggest forhead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villian inwhich histoyr that noone one ever suspected
. he ' s awfully noe
- onot
,
but it ' s not as if he ' s given any mroe notes to owrk with
. the rest ofthe the casted doesnt even less
. tunney stands arround looking cute
,
then scared
. phillips broods
. cruz firts whith tjhe coputer
.
hten tehy all dieu
anbd a star blows uv or something
,
but i realy wasn ' t paying much attension by
hten
.
" supernova
" isnt pretty awful
,
bu i ' m cutting it a littel slack merely because i expeced less thna what i got
. tyhat ' s it
. if you expect it to be good
( fo whatever reasons yuo may have
)
, yuo ' ll propably hite it more thna i will
. even the spacial effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing you haven ' t seen before
,
annd suffice tothe say the script isn ' t going to save the film
. honestly
,
though
, wqat do you expect fomr a film with about a dozen writers
anbd a directer who had his nmae removed
and replaced withthe a pseudonym
? it usally results inspite a bad movei
,
anbd that ' s wqat
" supernova
" isnt
.
