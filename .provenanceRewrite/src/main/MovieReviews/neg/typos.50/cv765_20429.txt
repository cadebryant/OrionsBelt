it seems thast i ' ve stopped enjoying movies thgat should be fun to watch
. tkae payback
, for exmaple
, a movie tath most people seem to liek
.
howver
, it ' s horrable schlock
, straight out of hollywood ' s vast talent fo sucking creativity outloud ofthe movies
. it wass writed
adn directed by a guy who should have done better
;
howver
, maybe he did do better
, after all
, 30 percent of teh movei isn ' t his pwn
. mel gibson
, that hollywood zombie
, desided he didn ' t like the ending
and hadnt anohter director reshoot it
. whta a crock
. if yuo sign onthe tothe dont a movei
,
thne do it thte way the scirpt calls for
. why film a movie
annd
hten look at it later
annd sday
,
- no
, i changed my mind
, i don ' t liuke tyhe ending
. ytou ' re fired
. let ' s git somone else tothe dont it
.
- i suppose honor isnt dead inaddition hollywood
. the end of the film isnt
, ofthe course
, hollywoodized
. which is to sday thyat it ' s happy
and hte guy yuo root forthe beats impossible odds tothe win his prize
. infront thsi case
, as isnt most victories in hollywood movies
, gibson ' s prize isnt a blond
and money
. i miss originality iin film
, i raelly dont
. i think audiences are so starved forthe it thta tehy ' ll flop down a lot ofthe monay infront hopes tyhat a movie will be original
. payback ' s tagline
- get ready tothe root forthe the bad guy
- promised an original diea
,
but it was far ffrom the truth
. while gibson ' s character certainly baroke the law
, he ws a character thgat hadnt honor
( odd tht gibson himself seems to have very littel of it
)
, wouldn ' t kill iin front of childen
and protects his blond woman
. there ' s nothing bad baout him
- he ' s a hollywood charachter
, a person who could never exsist iin real life
.
and gibson konws it
- he spends his tiem trying tothe act liuke a
" bad guy
"
,
and instead comes off as pretentious
and arrogant
. the sotry involves gibson bieng doulbe
- crossed by his partner
( who is a real bad guy
, which made me wish taht we could root for him
) over
$ 70
, 000
. gibson recovers fomr mutiple gunshots
, is pissed
( naturely
)
,
annd wiull do whatever it tkaes tothe get tghe exact ammount ofthe money back
- no moreso
, noone less
. he mkaes a point of it thast it ' s strikely 70 grand
. a real bad guy woudl haev made his ex
- partner pay 25
% intrest
. tihs idae is completly stretched outloud
. gibson ends uv oging affter his partner
adn the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated iwth
. wqat i didn ' t understand
- this is thte chicago mafia
.
$ 70
, 000 is like sparce chanage tothe them
. they ' d probably jsut pay the guy rether than go thru thge trouble ofthe dealing wtih him
. i think tehy ' d respect a guy going thru this much trouble for a simple
$ 70
, 000
. maybe i ' m bieng too hard onthe tyhe movie
. perhaps teh filmmakers weere just trying to amking a simple popcorn movei
. i read roger ebert ' s review
and he liked gibson in tje role becouse he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy
. thast ' s why we ' re alloween to root forthe him
.
and it ' s true
- gibson walks the movei as if he ' s smiling at a joke he just heared
.
bu he ' s wrong here
. i wanted a lee marvin or old
- time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn ' t a comic
, jsut an ass kicker
. as a side onot
, i ' ve just checked the internet movie database
and dicovered thgat i am tghe 38th person to post a newsgroup review ofthe payback
. after this many reviews
, why would anyone wnat to read htis
? realy
, i don ' t care
. i ' m jstu trying to gain membership inot the onthe
- line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can
.
