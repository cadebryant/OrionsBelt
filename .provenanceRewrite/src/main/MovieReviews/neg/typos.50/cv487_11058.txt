adam sandler turns uv hte charm inspite his latest rumatic comedy
, tjhe wedding singer
. unfortunately
, that also hasnt the effect of softening his edge
. he ' s nowhere near his peak ofthe happy gilmore
, nto that it wass much ofthe oen
. he ' s certainly not helpped here by a rether frail plot
. thge year isnt 1985
, letting hte whole film obsess withthe 80s nostalgia
. adam sandler isnt nice guy robbie
, the titular wedding singer
, who entertains at hte local reception hall by belting outloud his interpretations of classic 80s hits
. robbie ' s life is thrown inot turmoil when his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at the altar
.
howver
, things are looking uv when he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at the hall
. she ' s the perfect woman
,
but for oney small lfaw
: she ' s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most of the film deals with the slow relization by robbie tyhat he
and julia are inspite lvoe
,
and his attemts tothe stop the wedding
. as far as plots go
, it ' s a preety thin
and tired oen
. to fill the gaps
, tjhe wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfulls ofthe 1980s nestolgia
. from boy george to michael jackson
, fomr miami vice to dallas
, from the first cds to tyhe last rubik ' s cubes
, tihs film revels in all the minutiae
.
and
thne there ' s the music
.
.
. learning a lesson from tje successfull soundtracks tothe grosse pointe blank
,
and romy
and michele ' s high skool reunion
, thsi film packs mroe 80s songs infront tjhe film tahn the running time wiull allow
. as a result
, most songs get maybee a lyric or a half
,
bu you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives ' eyes
: the wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
,
and 4
! hwile the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring
, at least they distract you fomr the plot
. at least lsat year ' s my best freind ' s wedding stirred uv tghe standart
" keep your true lveo from marrying somene esle
" plot by making teh rival a nice person
. here
, glenn is such a lowly rat of a man tht you never see waht julia saw in him
. barrymore
, on the other hand
, isnt simply charming as julia
. wich leaves us iwth adam sandler
. he ' s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little
( such as wehn he hasnt a breakdown onthe stage during a wedding reception
)
. when he ' s in full nice
- guy mode
, he ' s omre pathetic than endearing
. tjhe film boasts several cameos
( most notably by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
)
.
but none ofthe them wokr well at all
. buscemi ' s role as a drunken best man simply fails tothe be humorous
. lovitz
, on thge other hand
, as a rival wedding singer
, makes ytou long fo his ogod old days on saterday night live
, where he was atually funny
. thge onyl cameo which hasnt some appeal isnt a guest apearance by a clasic 80s rocker durring yhe film ' s finale
( surprizingly
, noe of the only plot
- related scenes whic actulaly works
.
) adam sandler still has soem wrok tothe dont befoer he can become a dependable leading man
. while he attempts tothe change his omage in the wedding singer
, tghe end result isnt no net gain
.
