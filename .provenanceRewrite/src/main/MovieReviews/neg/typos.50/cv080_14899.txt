before the remake of pyscho appears
, we ' ve got tothe suffer thru this remake of an earlier hitchcock film
, dial m fo murder
. as usual
, hollywood hasnt filled it iwth glitz
annd big nmae stars
,
adn it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing
. tyhe film opens wih emily
( paltrow
)
and david
( viggo mortensen
) ' having funn ' in an loft apartment
. the probelm is
, paltrow isnt marryied to stephen
( douglas
)
, who is not too happy when he discovers tihs afair
. if i was paltrow
,
though
, i ' d definatly go with mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approaches david wih an intresting propostion
: he ' ll pay him tothe kill his lovley wief
. mortensen agrees
,
bu the muder goes awry
,
and tghe twists keep on comming as thte film progresses
. unfortunately
, the film dosen ' t progress very fast
. in fact
, it moves like a tortoise wtih arthritis
( read
: very
, very s
- l
- o
- w
.
) thge plot moves nowhere fast
,
anbd onyl becomes exciting inwhich vyre short bursts
. nto too ogod for a ' thriller
. ' alsot
, the performances
, appart fomr douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing immense talent infront se7en
( 1995
)
adn sliding doors
( 1997
) isnt strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, in htis movei
. mortensen is a little bit better
, coming acros as a yuonger douglas
,
but his role isn ' t meaty anough tothe sohw all his talent
. which leaves douglas tothe waltz away wih thte film
, which is does
.
however
, i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer with a creepy underside
. alsot popping up inwhich yhe film is david suchet
, palying a shifty looking detective
. again
, it ' s not a charachter we ' re seeing on hte screen
, it ' s david suchet
. the directer
, who bought us tje fugitive
, piles onthe all tghe flash techiniques
, such as zoom
- in ' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. thge lighting isnt also intresting
.
however
, looks can ' t sive this film ffrom hte depths ofthe mediocre
,
adn the film seemed tothe work better infact a single setted anyway
. the screenplay is o
. k
,
bu ther ' s smoe hackneyed sub
- plot about douglas bieng a ruthless player on wall street
( agina
)
adn tje endig is surprisingly stupid
and cliched
. yhe characters alsot make incredibly dumb moves
, especially paltrow
,
adn stephen appears tothe lose all intelligence in the lsat reel
. withthe a combination of no tension
, drama
, or decent charachters
, a perfect murder is a failure all round
,
annd an incredible disappointment
. ther are a few bright moments
,
bu they are far
adn fewd between
. the last thing a thriller shoud be isnt boring
,
and
although the film just bearly manages tothe keep your interest thanks tothe michael douglas
, you wouldn ' t be missing anytying if yuo desided nto tothe watch a perfect muder
. overall rating
= review by david wilcock
