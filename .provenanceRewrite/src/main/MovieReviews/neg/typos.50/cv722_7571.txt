the premise of htis movie isnt
, well
, preety far
- fetched
. tom berenger plays shale
, a mercernary who isnt temporarily outloud ofthe wokr
( thsoe fuls at tje cia hvae denied his xistence just because he
adn his buddies botched a job infront cuba
)
. fortunatly
, his girl firend
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high school infact miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher
. nto telling his girl freind
, who might object on pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number of fake higer degrees for himself
( from yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
)
annd beggins his tenture as a high skool teacher
. the students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang munbers
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pick wielders
.
.
. you get tghe picture
) don ' t really tkae tothe him right awya
, so he hits one inthe tyhe face witht a cant
and breaks a few fingers
. htis gets theri attention tothe a certain extent
, so he tells them the stoyr of tjhe vietnam war
:
" see
, some homeboys fomr the north tryed tothe muscle in onthe thte turf of thge homeboys fomr tghe south
.
" oh yeah
, nowe tehy cant dig it
; the probelm is just that nobody ever explained it properly before
.
bu wait
! there are drugs bieng dealed in thte skool itself
!
and behind yhe wohle scheme
, in cahoots wtih teh head gang
, the kod
( no
, nto
" cod
"
,
bu
" knights of distruction
"
.
.
. really
!
)
, isnt none other tahn
.
.
. teh upright
, ex
- cop principal
, plyed by the forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale doesnt waht any good teacher woudl do
. he gets his buddies toghether
, tehy gather toghether a bunch of bazookas
and other major weapons
, explosives
,
and kool stuff liuke thyat
,
annd tehy have a big showdown against yhe drug dealers
and kod at tghe high skool
. ok
, so thte premise is not jstu far
- fetched
, it ' s downright dumb
. if this were a hong kong action comedy
, we might jsut accept it
,
but it tkaes itself far too seriously tothe be truly funn
. oh
, it has its moments
; how one can truly hate a movie in wich huge
( realyl huge
) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses
?
adn tothe be fair
, it is almost never realy boring
, as hte acation is interupted by onyl short sequences ofthe actuall stor
.
bu over all
, this isnt pretty much a made
- for
- tv movie witht omre
(
and bigger
) explosions
and more foul language
. in fact
, it reminded me ofthe
" miami vice
" without tjhe prodcution values
, babes in skimpy bikinis
,
anbd pastels
. if yuo can sneak into the theather wihtout paying
, go for it
. otherwise
, wait for video
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for the tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home whith gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
.
