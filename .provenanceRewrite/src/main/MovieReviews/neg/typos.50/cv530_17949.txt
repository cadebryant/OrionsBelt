these dyas tyhe lack ofthe originality in hollywood reflects itself inthe hte deluge ofthe remakes
.
bu
, only a fewd years ago
, before wes craven publcly made funn ofthe thte pratice
, sequels had been omre populare among hollywood producers
. sequels aslo utilizied to be popular amung directors
and movei stars whose careers went south
. tghe way to regain popularaty
annd prestige
, htey throught
, ws teh use hte smae formulas
, cahracters
annd story lines thgat brought them success in the first palce
. one ofthe such celebrity was eddie murphy
, black comedian ofthe 1980s whose carrear was in big decline durring thge firt part of this decade
. in order tothe return to the spotlight
, he chose to resurrect the franchise creaeted by his most popular film
, beverly hills cop
, 1984 action comedy that had lready spawned tyhe sequel infact 1987
. seven eyasr later
, for tjhe thrid instalment
, he unsed the directorial service of john landis
, another fading star
, with whom he successully collaborated twice
- inwhich trading places
and comming to america
. tihs time
,
howver
, thrid time wasn ' t tghe charm
anbd beverly hills iii wass failure
. eddie murphy had to wait few mroe years fo real comeback
. eddie murphy here plays axel foley
, fast
- tlaking streetwise detriot policeman
, who radis illiegal chop shop
. the routine polical action ends inaddition tradgedy
, when yhe criminals kill foley ' s boss
. determined tothe bring the killers tothe justice
, foley realises tath their leader is ellis de wald
( timothy carhart
)
. whn it turns out tath de wald happens to be security chief forthe wonderland theme park in los angeles
, foley goes back tothe los angeles
. htere
, with yhe halp of his old friend
, local policeman rosewood
( judge rheinhold
)
, foley woudl clash with monay counterfeit ring
. ten yersa has passed usance tyhe original
and times are definately different
. in htis decade
, tghe contrast vetween blue collar detriot
anbd yuppie beverly hills
, whcih provided a lot ofthe gags in 1984 film
, simpley doesn ' t work
. screenwrighter steven e
. de souza provides another conflict
, this time between tje childish sillyness ofthe the good guys
and business
- like professionalism of thge bad guys
. since foley belongs to tyhe former
, his chracter had to watch his laguage
,
and tyhe tone of the film in genaral isnt mroe infantile
. unfourtunately
, this film still belongs to acation movie genre
,
and there is too much violence for little childern
. nice example isnt the humorous scene in tje beginning
, wich turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath
. unlike donner withthe teh lethal weppon serieses
, landis simply cxan ' t balance the comedy iwth
" regular
" acation
,
annd yhe result is a film thast fails in both aspects
. acation scenes are somtimes intresting
,
but not too spectacular
( at the end
, scenery ofthe wonderland is more fascinating than tje acation itself
)
; humour
, onthe tyhe otehr hand
, falls flat
. tothe make even worse
, some minor characters fomr 1984 film gets unnecesary
anbd somtimes irritating overexposure
( especially art expert turned inot arms dealer
, plyed by bronson pinchot
)
. in the end
,
altough yhe film provided smoe enteratinment
, viewers
, at least crtical ones
, owudl probablly be hapyp to nkwo tht there aren ' t any plans for beverly hills iv
.
