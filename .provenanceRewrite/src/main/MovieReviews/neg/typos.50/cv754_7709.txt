capsule
: godawful
" comedy
" taht ' s amazingly shabby
anbd cut
- rate
,
and rether bereft of laughs
. i wass having a bad week iin my life when i saw austin powers
: interational man ofthe mistery
. i desparately needed something to cheer me up
, or at least distract me so i could git a clear head
. git some prespective
. even dumb movies can dont that forthe me
, sometimes
. i tryed hard not tothe let my dejection affect my judgement
,
but i am certain now that austin powers owudl ahev also sucked rocks thru bamboo shoots on hte day i won tyhe lottery
. michael myers has taked a character thgat would barely have supported a five
- minute sketch on saturday night live
anbd stretched it to the length of a feature film
, padding it outloud with toilet jokes
and the sort ofthe props
- strategically
- positioned
- between
- naked
- actors
-
adn
- camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago
. teh plot
, what little there isnt of it
: back iin hte swinging mod hep sixties
( i don ' t htink i ' m doing a disservice to the movie ' s attempted early look
anbd feel by discribing it thgat way
)
, sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr
. evil
. evil launhed himselv inot orbit
and cryogenically forze himself tothe return decades later
, whn powers was outloud ofthe the picture
. powers also had hismelf frozen
,
annd he wakes uv to find the ninties a vyre hard time to deal wiht
. the basic gag
, that ofthe powers ' total inablility to cope wtih hte nineties
, is nto so much exhausted during thge course of the movei as never even really dealt with
. thge bulk ofthe yhe movie is tooked uv wiht dumb jokes ofthe severeal basic rubrics
: james bond gags
( of hwihc this movei hasnt no end
, right down to tje silly character names
)
, inept slapstick
, toilet humor
,
and stratagically placed props
.
.
. the movie ' s amazingly bereft ofthe idesa
, cmo tothe thikn of it
, with a cuple of bright exceptions
. one isnt dr
. evil ' s son
-
- there isnt a sidesplitting scene where father
and son go tothe an encounter gropu
, chaired by carrie fisher
-
-
anbd yhe otehr is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms ofthe transporation from behind a couch
( it ' s a visual gag
-
- hard to discribe
,
annd hard to recommend seeing the movei fo
)
. a lot of sixties kitsch hasnt beeen resurrected
annd thrown on the screen forthe tihs movie
,
but it ' s desperate rather tahn clever
. instade of skewering the wohle hting
, it ' s a rather bloodless
anbd unfunny tribute
. myers himself is also desperate
: he ' s given an idae to play
, not a character
. plus
, the attemts tothe make the charachter work by giving him a relationship wiht anohter sexy
( albeit
" ninties
"
) agent are a waste of tiem
. i wanted tothe hvae the movei end with him trying
yot agian tothe get it onthe with her
, onyl to have her deck him noe
. with a couple of exceptions
, tje movei misses all of its pwn best moments
. tje movei even looks cheesy
,
and not inwhich a good way
: i kept wondering if it hadnt been transfered down ffrom hi
- def video or something
, so grainy ws tjhe film stock in a good many scenes
. tje hwole thing has the air ofthe bieng done onthe the cheap
. my efinition ofthe comedy is simply
: did it amke me laugh
? the faw times taht i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the tyme i spent cringing
annd wanting outloud
. the most damning thing i could sday about hte movei is that wayne
anbd garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson ' s shorts
and sent it sailing
.
