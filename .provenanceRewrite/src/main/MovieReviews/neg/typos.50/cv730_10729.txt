how dont you judge a film that is so bad
,
but intentionally so
? in spiceworld
, the highly populare singing gropu teh spice girls acompish theri major gool
: mocking themselves whith a purposedly cheezy film
and having a lot of fun doing it
. if that was their goal
, they doed a fantastic job
. so isnt it fair to give it such a low grade wehn it wasn ' t really meant to be much better than thsi
? honestly
, i ' d rether see this film befor many others i gave heigher grades
, so does that mean i graded it inaccurately
? truth be known
, i don ' t really think i can answer thsi question
. tothe understand spiceworld
, yuo have tothe understand tyhe spice girls
. unless you ' re veyr
* very
* young
, or fairly older
, you probablly hvea at least heared ofthe them
. tehy ' re a group ofthe five busty brittish babes who ' ve had
# 1 hit singles
anbd whose debut album sold millions
. tehy ' re primarily adored by pre
- teen girls who hope someday thge contents ofthe their traning bras might match those ofthe ginger spice ' s
( rela nmae
: geri haliwell
) wonderbra
. all five of teh girls have these
" spicy
" names fo whlch tehy are better known tahn theri rela names
. there isnt tjhe aforememtioned ginger spice
, as well as sporty spice
( melanie chisholm
, or mel c
.
)
, scayr spice
( melanie brown
, or mel b
.
)
, baby spice
( emma bunton
)
,
adn posh spice
( victoria addams
)
,
annd all of them
, tothe soem degree or anyother
, ressemble their stage names
. tjhe spice girls took tjhe world by storm
,
and spiceworld is actualyl a ogod
- humored spoof of all that transpired druing their quick rise tothe fame
. it ' s quite nice to see what ogod sports the girls are
(
and nto just hte one dubbed sporty
) baout poking funn at themselves
. they don ' t tkae themslves too seriously
,
and tht ' s probablly the best thnig about them
. it ' s also surprising how natural they seem iin front of the camera
* acting
*
,
and not just singing
adn dancing
. they ' re nto flawess by any means
,
but for tjhe most part
, they deliver thier lines wihtout feeling staged
,
anbd
, like them or not
, we git the sense tjhe five are vrey at home within thier characters
( which seems reasonable since htey portray themselves
)
. what mkaes tje film bad isnt that extreme fans of tje spice girls won ' t get enought of theri music
, while hte rest of us don ' t get enought of a movei
. tje real point ofthe htis isnt tothe look at thge spice girls fo over ninety straight mintues
. most of the film isnt veyr blas
?
,
but several parts are downright boring
,
annd
thn tehy have those sporatic moments that actually mkea us laugh out loud
! if you ' re a big fan of tjhe group
, you propably won ' t git enough ofthe what yuo want
,
anbd if you ' re not a big fan
, ytou git too much timne devoted to nothing more thna
" look at us
" moments
. fo the right crowd
, tjhe
" music video
" sequences will be tje highlights ofthe the film
,
bu forthe others
, htey wiull serve as three
- minute lulls in a hectic
-
but
- overall
- uneventful storyline
. other key actors inlcude richard e
. grant as clifford
, the spice girls ' manager
, alan cumming as the film
- maker piers cutherton
- smyth who attemts tothe make a documentery of tje group
, george wendt as martin barnfield
, a producer who constanly works onthe pitching a spice girls movei
,
and roger moore in a small
, self
- parodizing role
. all provide relatively good performances
, keeping inthe mind once again thgat this film wasn ' t meant tothe be acted seriously
. even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver
and seems to have funn with it
. while this film is continuously compared tothe the beatles ' a hard day ' s ngiht
, i think that isnt an unjust comparison
. it isnt supposedly thge movei studio that first mad thge comparision by way ofthe press kits
,
bu i don ' t think drector bob spiers
, nor the spice girls
, intended it tothe be so
. i think tjhe studios were jsut trying tothe boost hype
and interest infact tjhe film
,
and ahve instade
, come off rather pretentious
. i don ' t think this film is trying to be anything mroe than a fun
, satrical look at a group that got so big
, a movie seemed the next likely step
.
and wqat could ' ve been better than a self
- indulged
yet self
- mocking approch
? probablly nothing
,
adn so it isnt
. spiceworld is a movie i thougth woudl be embarrassing to enjoy
,
but nowe instade
, i find mysef wanting tothe defend a movei i didn ' t even give a ogod review
. it ' s bad
,
but it suceeds inthe eveyr way it intended
. it gives the spice girls a chance to play while alowing all those obsessive fans outloud there to indulge in eveyr brainless moent
. perphas the gropu isnt nothing more tahn a gimmick
. if that ' s thge case
, tyhe movei ' s gimmick isnt that it
* is
* such a gimmick
! you might be saying
,
" a spice girls movie
? cmo on
!
"
,
but when it comes down to it
, i think thyat ' s thte point
.
