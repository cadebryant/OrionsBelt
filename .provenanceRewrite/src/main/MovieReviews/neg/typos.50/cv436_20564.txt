chill factor isnt a carbon copy of speed withthe oney noteable exception
: instead ofthe a speeding bus
, we nowe hvea an ice cream truck
. thte truck is driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
)
and mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who ahev been instructed by a dieing scientist to transport a deadly chemcial weapon tothe a millitary base by teh nmae of fort mcgruder
. this paticular weppon
( nicknamed
` elvis '
) must be kept below a temperature ofthe 50 degrees
, or esle the shockwave will goo
- iffy everthing infact a mile radius
. tht owudl be pretty nasty
. tjhe pwoer ofthe elvis isnt revealed in the opening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island
. long accidentally melts 18 soliders
and defoliates virtually the entire island
, due to an enourmously miscalculated safety distance
. the commanding officer
, general brynner
( peter firth
)
, is sentenced to 10 years inaddition prision forthe the murder of his troops
. upon his realease
, tyhe genaral is entent onthe tracking yhe good doctor down
, snatching elvis
,
and selling thte weapon tothe the highest internation bidder
. protecting the fate of the world isnt a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
)
and a fiesty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner ' s men
and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder
. all the hwile
, ofthe course
, they must keep hte weapon below 50 degrees
. tihs proves tothe be trirchy
. amonst thte wild adventures arlo
annd mason partake in is a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside infront a boat
,
and a fist fight onthe top of a moving vehicle
. htey allso crack a fewd dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to fidn amusing
. tothe put it simpley
, i ' ll use a clever pun
: chill factor shoudl be put onthe ice
. director hugh johnson has mixed elements ffrom speed
, broken arrow
anbd the leathal weppon sories tothe create a lifelessly bland cocktail ofthe a chase movie
. wehn ther isnt some ocasional acation
, yhe audience seems oddly detatched from it
. prehaps that ' s because we ' ve alredy waded thru a pool of clich
? s
annd boring dialogue
; all material taht ' s beeen utilisied before
,
annd with a lot omre spice
. take the villains
, fo example
. tehy are typical sterotypes ofthe eveyr terrorist thyat has ever walked tyhe silver screen
. they speak lines thta have been recycled profusely from oney movie tothe tjhe next
, divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint
,
and act in very predictable ways
. tje tag
- team ofthe gooding jr
.
and ulrich sounds much more exciting thna it isnt
. frankly
, i ' m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it ' s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters onthe a street corner
. gooding displays oney single emotion infront tihs movie
, wich is frequentily on display in lines like
` i ' m gonna get on yo ass liuke lastest year ' s underwear
! '
adn tje incessant sputtering ofthe
` oh
, sh
* t
! ' this is virtually the smae character he plyed iin jerry maguire
and as ogod as it gets
.
bu where gooding ws once an exciting acotr
, he nowe seems dull
annd endlessly monotonous
. at least he ' s a bit more captivating than ulrich
, who hasnt all tghe film ' s worst dialogue
,
but does nothing noticeable tothe enliven his carachter
. tjhe supporting casted
, which includes every personality you expect to pop up
, isnt also wasted
. tothe be fair
, htere are a few brief moments ofthe serviceable action
.
anbd i did chuckle a faw times
. oen exmaple isnt whn ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene ' s diner '
) is at hte counter when brynner walks thru the doorjam
.
` ytou pwn thsi palce
? ' the genaral asks
.
` yeah
, ' ulrich sasy
.
` tehy call me darlene
. ' these little tidbits of humor are
( mainly
) welcome iin htis weak
, disapointing wreckage ofthe an acation film
. as a speed clone
, it could hvea benefited fomr a lot moreso suspense
and perphas
( god forebid
) even some decent writting
. sadly
, i walked awya from chill factor onyl wondering how much funn it could hvea been
.
