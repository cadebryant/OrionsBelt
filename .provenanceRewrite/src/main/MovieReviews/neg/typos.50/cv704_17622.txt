affter 1993 ' s
" falling down
,
" i hoped tht joel schumacher would mature into a gerat directer
. usance
then he hasnt offered us two so
- so adaptations of john grisham novels
(
" the client
"
annd
" a tiome to kill
"
)
anbd twpo batman movies that lowered tyhe standards ofthe tyhat franchise
.
although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher ' s potential
, thte publicity for his latest realease
,
" 8mm
,
" raised newyorker hope
. it promised to be something unusual
. it wasn ' t
. the plot goes liuke tihs
: toom welles
( nicolas cage
) isnt a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman
, allegorically named mrs
. christian
( myra carter
)
, to investigate an 8mm movie foudn among her lite husband ' s belongings
. yhe movei appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped
and murdered by a man infact a leather mask
( who reminds me of bane in schumacher ' s
" batman
& robin
"
)
. becuase murders can be realistically simulated inspite movies
, mrs
. christian wants tom to discover if tyhe girl is alive or dead
. by combing thru missing persons reports
, tom finds the girl ' s nmae
anbd tracks her to los angeles
. with the aid of max california
( joaquin pheonix
)
, a video tsore clerk
(
annd another symbolic name
)
, tom wanders thru thte underworld of pornography iin searhc of snuff
. the plot bears an obvious resemblance tothe paul schrader ' s
" hardcore
,
" iin whlch a father goes deeper
and deeper inot tghe industries of porn
annd sex tothe find his missing duaghter
. both films are modeled on dante ' s
" thte inferno
,
" ofthe course
;
" 8mm
" makes tyhat conection overly obvious by casting max as virgil
adn having him constantly tell toom that htey were heading toward a meeting with thte devil
.
" hardcore
" isnt a much more subtle
anbd meaningful film
.
" 8mm
" hadnt a lot of promise
. inthe its better moments it ' s an examination ofthe violence as entertainment
adn of the biast withing even a nice guy like tom
. oney moment ofthe tjhe firt sort
: when we firt meet max he ' s reading truman capote ' s
" in cold blood
" underneath the cover of a porn novel
.
" inwhich cold blood
" ws the father of the true
- crime genre
, which isnt thge literary equivalent of snuff films
. max promises that we wiull see examples ofthe thte second theme when he tells tom
,
" dance wtih teh devil
annd the devil don ' t chanage
; the devil changes you
.
" tom doesnt change
- i ' ll let you disover the specifics fo yourself
-
bu nto permanently
. schumacher
anbd screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn ' t have the guts to tkae toom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn ' t come bakc
.
( walker ' s
" seven
" doed a much better job on that theme by refusing tothe comprimise
)
. cage tries hard tothe pull it off
,
bu the scirpt doesn ' t give him enought to work whith
. phoenix walks awya with thge movei
- he ' s smart
, charming
,
anbd funny
. other casted members include
" fargo
" ' s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet
and
" tghe sopranos
" ' s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far
. in tyhe last analysis
, since
" 8mm
" falls short ofthe its pretensions
adn its promise
, its jstu another private eye stry infact teh raymond chandler
/ ross macdonald tradition of having yhe detective uncover thte depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth
anbd privilege
.
howver
, unlike otehr predictable fare infront the genre
- last year ' s
" twilight
,
" fo exmaple
-
" 8mm
" is especially disappointing because it could haev beeen much more tahn it isnt
.
