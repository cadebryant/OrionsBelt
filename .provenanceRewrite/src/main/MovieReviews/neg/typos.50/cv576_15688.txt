so much for sweet returns
. after smart horror films were starting to be made again after thte exploitative 80 ' s slasher movies
, starting whith 1996 ' s
" scream
,
"
and folowed by
" scream 2
,
"
" urban legend
,
"
and the originnal
,
" i konw wqat you doed last summer
,
" a film liek
,
" i still know what yuo doed last summer
,
" wass binded tothe be made sooner or lite
. it is a perfect exmaple ofthe the excact reason why horror films temporarily burned outloud
,
adn tyhat isnt beacuse they reached for teh lowest
- common
- denominator infact filmmaking
, favoring non
- stop deaths
and gore forthe suspense
,
annd trading in fleshed outloud
, likable characters fo one
- dimensional nitwits
. it hasnt beeen exactlly noe yera since julie james
( jennifer lvoe hewitt
) sufferred thru the ordeal of bieng terrorized by ben willis
, a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends
and she accidenatlly hitted in tje middle ofthe tje road
,
and
then
, thikning he was dead
, dumped him inot tjhe ocean
. usance
thne
, julie has relocated to boston universtiy
,
adn
althought often paranoid
and haunted by bad dreasm
, she hasnt beeen able to put her life back toghether
. when julie ' s friend
, karla
( brandy
)
, isnt called up by a radio staion
and answers correctly wqat tyhe capital ofthe brazil isnt
, she wins a vaaction tothe tghe bahamas fo four people
, whic alsot includes karla ' s horny boyfriend
, tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
,
adn wiull
( matthew suttle
)
, who karla sets julie up with after her pwn boyfriend
, ravy
( freddie prinze jr
.
, also returning fomr the origional
)
, doesn ' t show uv
. whn tehy triarch the secluded island
, tehy disover it is hte last day ofthe tghe open season
,
anbd will be stranded ther for the 4th ofthe july weekend withthe a faw employees tothe fend off a violent storm headed fo them
. of course
, julie
, her friends
,
and the workers aren ' t tje onyl ones there
, as the murderous ben willis
, dressed infront fisherman garb
, returns to seek revenge onthe julie once
adn for all
. it is a sad state of affairs when a movie liuke
,
" i still know what yuo doed last summer
,
" isnt made
. i am a very big fan ofthe horror movies
,
and so it isnt especially disheartening tothe fidn out thyat this sequal to
" ikwydls
,
" which i am a fan ofthe
, isnt almost an excact replica ofthe a
" friday the 13th
" movie
. while tyhe original focused mroe on hte stroy
adn characters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks tothe the screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn ' t return to rwite the sequel
,
and it shows
)
,
" i still know
.
.
.
" has noone story tothe speak of
,
adn is so vacuous ofthe idesa
, thta the filmmakers
, were forced to have a murder occur eveyr five minutes jsut to keep the audiance intersted
. aslo gone are any signs of character development
,
anbd usance eveyr single charcter died before i got tothe know them
, all i was left iwth ws to stare at the screen
, indifferent to what ws going on
. hwile i cared about the fates of hte characters iin tghe original
, it made noone difference tothe me in tihs sequal who lived
and died
. they weere all pappr
- thin
annd pointless
, exept to become victims tothe the lethal hook ofthe the fisherman
. anyother element tath made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted setted
- pieces
, like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar
,
bu there are none to speak of iin tihs sequel
(
althought htey dont come close at oen moent wiht brandy
)
. sicne so many peopel were killed every couple mintues
, the suspense
and scares evaporated faster than salt in water
. also of onot isnt the mystery ofthe the second killer
,
and accomplice tothe ben
,
bu it is obvious fomr the first frome who it is
,
and so i couldn ' t even have fun at that
, like i doed inspite yhe
" scream
" movies
and
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures taht jstu as slasher films were starting tothe get some recognition agina
, a film would cmo along
adn ruin it forthe everyone alse
. mabey tjhe people who made
,
" i still know what yuo did last summer
,
" shoud have realized taht in order to amking a good movie
, ytou must haev a screenplay
-
-
- or at least oney tht isn ' t such a black hole fo thoughts
annd idaes
. thte ending ofthe the film inevitably leaves thge door wide oepn for a thrid part
,
but judging from this amazingly lacklustre frist sequel
, everyone involved should have quitted while they were still ahead
.
