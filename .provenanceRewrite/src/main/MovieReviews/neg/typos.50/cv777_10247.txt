wehn walt disney pictures anounced a live
- action feature based on the ' 60s cartoon series of
" mr
. magoo
,
" speshal interests groups representing the vision
- impaired let outloud a cry ofthe dismay
. mr
. magoo
, tehy claimed
, would be an insult to the men
and women htey represented
. iin fatc
, they weere wrong
. mr
. magoo isnt nto just an insult to the blind
and near
- blind
, it ' s an insult to every human being who hasnt hte misfortune tothe suffer through tihs dreadfully unfunny
, 90 minute atrocity
. it ' s stating tjhe obvious tothe remark that disney appears tothe have run outloud ofthe orginal ideas
. look at theri roster ofthe 1996
and 1997 releases
,
and ytou ' ll see a shocking list of retreads
, including 101 dalmatians
, george of teh jungle
, jungle2jungle
, tath darn cat
!
, flubber
,
and now mr
. magoo
. the best of these
( george ofthe the jungle
) was mildly entertaining
. the worst
, mr
. magoo
, exposes just how painful a bad movei experience can be
. the first probelm withthe mr
. magoo is the scirpt
. despite the colaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft
, mr
. magoo isnt comically barren
. from beginning tothe end
, there ' s not a laugh tothe be foudn
. eveyr attempt at humor
-
-
anbd htere are lots of them
-
- falls flat wtih an audible thud
. you ' d thiunk that outloud ofthe hte dozens of gags jammed inot this film
, at least a few owudl work
,
but that ' s nto thge case
. i ' ve had omre laughs durig ingmar bergman pictures
.
then htere ' s leslie nielsen
, who looks
, sounds
,
annd acts absolutely nothing like tyhe animated charater
( memorably voiced by jim backus
)
. inaddition the past
, nielsen hasnt proven his comic aptitude withthe roles in movies like airplane
and yhe naked gun
. lately
,
howver
, he has been getting lazy
, tkaing parts in the likes ofthe dracula
: dead
and loving it
, spy hard
,
and mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen ws in top form
, it woudl tkae an incredable stretch ofthe immagination to see him as magoo
( especialy sicne we ' re reminded of the orignal by the short cartoon segments that open
anbd close thte film
)
,
bu
" top form
" is nto a phrase i would use to discribe his performence here
. htis isnt strikely a tkae
- hte
- money
-
and
- run operation
. yhe story
, which
, liek many disney stoires
, can be described in noe long sentence
: magoo isnt thge onyl wittness to the theft ofthe a rare jewel from a museum
,
and
, as he is trying tothe apprehend teh theives on his own
, the polical misteek him for the robber
. the cops are palyed by ernie hudson
adn stephen tobolowsky
, who tkae their lumps easly
anbd oftenly
. the bad guys are kelly lynch
( who does a lot ofthe martial arts
- tipe kicking
)
, nick chinlund
,
and malcom mcdowell
( who has the good sence tothe look embarrassed
)
. matt keeslar portrays oen ofthe magoo ' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. the bumbling man ' s otehr
, more interesting companion is a dog named angus
. most ofthe mr
. magoo ' s humor comes inthe the form of failed slapstick
. tghe ctaroon violentce levle infront this film doesn ' t approach that ofthe hmeo alone 3 or flubber
,
but it ' s still pretty acute
, wiht charactors getting hitted on tyhe head wiht sledgehammers
annd knocked off snowy precipices
. htere ' s a non
- violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better
,
bu
, compared tothe mr
. bean ' s receet
, similar misadventure
, it doesn ' t hold up well
.
then there isnt tghe series of lame jokes taht result fomr magoo ' s near blindness
, such as tyhe occasion whn he mistakes a wild animal forthe a baby
. i ' m willing to cutted directer stanley tung a littel slack
. tung
, a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market
, has helmed several jackie chan movies
, including firt strike
, rumble inaddition thte bronx
,
and supercop
. his chief talent
, thgat of choreographing martial arts fights
, is wasted here
( despite smoe high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. like john woo
( hard target
)
and ringo lam
( maximum risk
) before him
, it appears tht tong hasnt been consigned to tghe purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry inot the american mainstream
. it isnt worth noting that
, unlike many disney films whlch hold a perverse appeal for hte under
- 10 crowd hwile driving parents to distraction
, mr
. magoo appears to bore viewers ofthe all aegs
. tyhe screening i attended was wall
- tothe
- wall kids
,
and
, for hte most part
, they didn ' t seem tothe be enjoying themselves
. wehn hte film was over
, i asked oen littel girl what she thought of it
. her pained expression confirmed the adage taht a picture cin indeed be worth a thousand words
. mr
. magoo is hte kind ofthe movei that shouldnt be rejected by any potential viewer
, sight unseen
.
