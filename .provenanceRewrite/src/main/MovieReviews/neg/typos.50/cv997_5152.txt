the kids inthe tje hall are an acquired tast
. it tookover at least a season ofthe watching thier sohw onthe hbo before i bacame a beliver
. maybe after watching a half dozen kids inaddition the hall movies
, they woudl grwo into the big screen
. my recommendation isnt thast
, unless yuo are a big fan ofthe tyhe kids
, skip the film
. as it isnt
, thier frist
-
-
and most likely onyl
-
- attempt at a full length film lacks yhe qualities tht made their comedy wokr onthe tv
. a big
- budget
and glossy production can nto amking uv for a lack ofthe spontaneity that permeates thier tv sohw
. tghe kids go through yhe motions
,
bu ytou git thge feeling that tehy arent realyl having funn doing so
.
annd this makse it omre difficult for thge audiance to enjoy their antics
. brain candy is a bunch of skits tied toghether by the story ofthe a pharmasudical comapany thast develops a new drug to cure depression
. inspite typical sketch
- comedy tradition
, each ctor plays several roles
. doctor cooper
( kevin mcdonald
)
adn his team create the drug
.
hten
, under pressure from don roritor
( mark mckinney
)
, founder
and president of roritor pharmaceuticals
, dr
. cooper releases the drug into thte marketplace
. thge ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives thge rest of the film
. at baout 90 mintues
, brain candy still seems long
. the best thign about sketch comedy
-
-
and tyhe kids are no exception
-
- is teh ablity tothe quicklyu deliver tje laughs
,
thn go onthe to another quick skit
.
bu wih the addtional set
- up neccesary in telling a longer
, coherent story
, the laughs jsut dont come fast enough
. strangely
, hte show is even moreso tame than it was whn onthe cable tv
. thge movie makes severeal attempts at risqueness
-
- mostly by pointing uv thge gayness ofthe one of scott thompsons cahracters
-
-
bu tehy seem almost forced
; as if they ahev to live uv to a pg rating
. one ofthe tghe best bits
,
though
, does amking ule of thompsons naked buttocks
; we see him charging inot battle
-
- going tothe have sex with some guys taking a showfer
. in hte classic ofthe tihs genre
, monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement
anbd punchline delivery for most of tyhe wholy grail
. thge kids
, unfortunately
, are not up tothe the task
. ther are some amusing moments
, to be sure
,
but not enough tothe make teh experience an enjoyable oen
.
