capsule
: not as bad a sequel as crowm 2 or batman
& robin
,
bu still horribly putrid
, cheesy
anbd ill
- concieved
. this one belongs in saterday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: you know
, baout halfway through this movei
, i realized tht if yuo hacked out everyting exept teh fight scenes
, ytou ' d have a damn fine 35 mintues or so ofthe flashy
, hong kong sytle martial arts
. beautifully choreographed by robin shou
, who alsot plays liu kang
, thge fight scenes are both mind
- blowing
and graeful
, acrobatic enough tothe amke olympic gymnasts weep
. tihs isnt what made yhe origional so funn
,
but unfortunately for the sequal
, we are wihtout the frenetic directorial sytle of paul anderson
. instade
, they got john r
. leonetti
, the cinematographer for the orginial mortal kombat
. not a ogod choice
. while tyhe fight scenes are brutal
anbd eye
- popping
, teh rest ofthe the movie looks liek standard made for tv fare
. tghe acting is sub
- par
, whic i sould endur if it were nto for a
.
) thge directer ' s style
, b
.
) the spacial effects
,
& c
.
) tjhe treatment of thge storey
and charachters
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti shouldnt go back tothe lighting
, inspite my opinion
. i could sday dozens of bad thigns baout him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he has no eye fo acation
, he cxan ' t git even medioker performances out of actors
,
and so on
.
but by far his worst move ws thte way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody can now fli
. hell
, i ' m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick
adn whatnot
,
but not wehn it happens every fewd mintues
,
anbd is done so poorly
. better jumping
and acrobatics hasnt beeen seen inspite xena
: warrior princess
. in short
, tehy should hvea gotten paul anderson back
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike the firt one
, whose sfx weere vibrant
and somewhat realsitic
, mk
: a ' s special effects are bland
, fake looking
,
and overall jsut plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times that blue
- screening was painfully obvious
. hadnt this movie been made iin yhe 80 ' s
, it would have beeen ground
- breaking
.
but iin todya ' s industry
, it doesn ' t even look finished
. c
.
) nowe forthe thge
_ realyl
_ bad parts
. i admiting
, i ' m an avid fan of the mortal kombat serieses
. the games are amusing diversions
, an easy way tothe work off stress
anbd anger
. the first movie was a mindlessly funn thrillride
. this could have been a really cool movei
. it isn ' t
. the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience fomr teens tothe preschoolers
. soem ofthe the plot elements are jstu plain stupid
. how stupid
? take
, forthe instance
, how our heroes move arround
. they use giants spheres the roll arund underground
, supposably at thousands of miles per hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse isnt hte treatment of secondary characters
. blink
annd you ' ll miss ' em
. most characters hadnt moreso depth infact the video ganes
. if you thought batman
& robin wass bad about this
, yuo ain ' t seen nothin '
yet
. a ogod 75
% ofthe yhe charactors are introduced
, kick somebody arund a bited
,
hten either die or are forgotten baout
. there ' s no explanation at all fo htis
.
and forthe the final blasphemy
, the fight that all teh fans weere waiting rabidly for
, the fight hyped tothe be the most intricate of tjhe movei
, lasted baout 3 mintues
adn
then jsut sort of
.
.
. ended
. it almost made me weep
. to sum it all uv
, rent it on video
,
and fast
- foward thru everything except the fight scenes
.
