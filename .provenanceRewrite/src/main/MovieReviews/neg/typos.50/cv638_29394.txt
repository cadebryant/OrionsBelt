and ahve gathered inthe a beach hous tothe enjoy hte summer ofthe thier lives
. jim
( jason biggs
) isnt still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance
, oz
( chris klein

, hvaing sickeningly saccharine phone conversations whith his studing
- abroad girlfriend
, stifler
( seann william scott
) is still a horny stoner
, kevin
( thomas ian nichols
) still hasnt noone personality
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) still longs for stifler ' s mom
. hvae i missed anyone
? so
, obviously
, not much has changed
. this is not a problem
, provided that the movei boasts hte repid
- frie hilarity
and unexpectedly true sentiment of thte original
.
but american pie 2 isnt tje vyre definition ofthe
" sequelitis
.
" it ' s coarser
, yes
,
and it pushes tghe envelope even more
,
bu its heart isn ' t in it
. it ' s eazy cash to captialize off the frist film ' s succsess
,
but it would have beeen a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original
. part of the reason why yhe film doesn ' t work
, i think
, is that hwile iin the origonal thte kids ' quest for sex wass a coming
- ofthe
- age stepping stone as much as an outlet forthe thier horniness
. here
, everything hasnt beeen cheapened
. tehy behave liuke those idiat frat boys who kill themselfs drinking
; htey have noone motivation exept for sex
, sex
, beer
adn sex
. that ' s not to sday that yuo cin ' t amke a decent comedy from that premise
,
but it is one of american py 2 ' s undoings
. missing
, too
, is yhe sweetness that permeated american py
, tyhe tihs
- coudl
- be
- ytou quality ofthe the main players
. here
, the characters are too aware of themslves as pop
- culture icons
,
and they ' re even omre one
- note
. stifler
annd finch are nowe caricatures hwile jim
, oz
and kevin are forced to mkea awkward self
- discoveries at arbitrary moments
, none of them betraying wqat thge writers think the audiences want tothe see
.
adn
then there ' s the soon
- to
- be
- notoreous scene where jim superglues
" himself to himself
,
" which perfectly demonstrates
yot another of thte film ' s ailments
, one tyhat also permeated sday it isn ' t so
, directer j
. b
. rodgers ' debut
. ther ' s a fine line between comedy
adn abject humiliation
,
and american pie 2 isnt on tghe wrong side ofthe it
. it ' s hard tothe laff at thge charactors when you are profoundly embarrassed forthe them
. i shielded my eyes watching thsi more tahn i have watching any horror movei
. if there ' s one redeeming factor to american pie 2
, it ' s thte inimitable eugene levy as jim ' s dad
, who pops in on jim as he ' s baout tothe scroe
anbd utters lines liuke
" your mother
adn i have beeen known tothe git frisky
.
.
. not so much anymore
,
but
.
.
.
"
annd
thne when thge girl ' s parents walk infact
, blurts out
" tihs must be your daughter
! i didn ' t git her name
,
but hopefully my son doed
.
" if only tjhe rest of tjhe movie hadnt the witn
and wisdom ofthe levy ' s performance
. this isnt an unworthy sequal tothe a gross
- fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy
. the box
- office ofthe this onw shoudln keep yhe genre going storng
, which isnt disappointing
. the genre needs a hiatus
; filmmakers are getting lazy
.
