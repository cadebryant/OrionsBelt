i knwo ther were times during htis movie that i laughed preety hard
. thte probelm isnt
, i cant ' t remember them as i write this review
. that ' s nto a ogod sign
. inspite booty call
, jamie foxx isnt bunz
, a character whom i cant ' t really describe
, because i don ' t konw thgat much baout him
. i only konw taht he likes tothe shoot dice on thge sidewalk
,
and thgat he doesn ' t like relationships
, jstu
" booty calls
" at threee infront the morning
( noone questions
, noone committment
)
. bunz has a best freind named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems to be bunz ' s direct oposite
: on the straight
and narrow
,
adn currently inaddition a long
- term commitment
( a hwole seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wants tothe finaly sleep wih his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
bu for a reason whlch isnt not totally explained
, it ' s going to happen affter a double date iwth bunz
adn nikki ' s freind lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who ahve never met
. tothe make a long stoy short
, the two couples pair off
adn spend the rest ofthe teh evening having thier attempts tothe dont the ded spoiled by nikki ' s obession with safe sex
. firt she wants condoms
, so bunz
adn rushon go out
anbd git them
. oh
, noone
, they have to be latex
, not lambskin
. bcak to the stoer
. nowe htey ' ve got to get dental dams
, or there ' ll be noone foreplay
. why are both couples stoped each tyme nikki makse a demand
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives acrost the hall
,
and tells her she ' d better be makeing these demands
, too
. talk baout coitus interruptus
. booty call is a film thta doesnt not know whether it wnats to be a regluar comedy or noe of those over
- teh
- top comedies
. the diference beetwen tyhe two isnt that in the latter
, things constantly hppen which are so far removed from reality
. in this cateory
, forthe example
, you hvae ace ventura
: private eye onthe thte mild side
,
annd airplane
! at tghe extreme
. there are times durring booty call where the film steps outloud ofthe its shell
anbd trys for this status
,
bu
then too oftenly quicklyu retreats tothe the safety of convention
. it is disappointing
,
anbd even worse
, distracting
. htere are also instances where tjhe screenplay by takashi bufford
and bootsie parker
( are thsoe real names
?
) does nto live up tothe its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writting
. for instatance
, htere isnt a scene where our main characters are in a chinese retsaurant
. bunz goes uv tothe an asian gangster
and speaks tothe him inaddition fluent cantonese
, much to everyone ' s suprise
.
however
, wehn asked how he learned the language
, he goes inot this explanation of how he started picking up words ffrom late
- night kung
- fu films
,
and soon gained mastery
. this negated tjhe ludicrousness of the entire scene
. if
, onthe teh otehr hand
, wehn asked how he learned tothe speak chineese
, bunz simpley replied witht
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
annd
hten moved on
, tjhe joke woudl hvae beeen much mroe effective
. tihs isnt because it woudl have been totally unbeleivable
,
bu funny becasue we know it is unbelievable
. by explaning tyhe point
annd trying to make the rediculous plausable
, the film is nto giving its viewers enough credit
. the inconsistancy
and uncertain believability unfortunatley allso raise other questions
. why are twpo such disparate people like bunz
anbd rushon best friends
? why dont rushon
and nikki fix uv bunz
and lysterine
? if nikki isnt so obssessed with safe sex
, why doesn ' t she have smoe condoms at her own aparment
? theese questions are nto anwsered by the screenplay
,
bu are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward
. a vrey noticeable uality ofthe booty call is tjhe prevelance ofthe unnecessary foul language
. some movies uise a lot of swear words
,
bu use them under very justifiable circumstances
, as wehn they are employed consistent with a character ' s pattern ofthe speek
. otehr films
, such as the reccent jackie brown
, use them iin ways tht almsot parody themslves
. booty call just sticks them in to get laughs
,
annd it doesn ' t owrk
. tehy stick outloud liek sore thumbs baceause there is almost noone reason tothe ule them
. half of the scenes seem to occur for noone reason
. the chinese restauant
, a holdup at a convenience tsore
,
anbd a trip tothe tje hospital seem tothe have nothing to do with tyhe story
,
adn are in there for filler
. this is surprising
, considering taht tjhe film is less thna eighty mintues long
. it ' s too bad tath the core ofthe the film isn ' t much better
, since it is comprised of somtimes funny
,
but forgettable dialouge
. i refer ytou to hte first paragraph of thsi review
