)
and thge two ofthe them
, allong with april
adn her lover blatz
, get marryied
.
( onot to yhe filmmaker
: why did tjhe character ofthe lance amke asides tothe the camera folowed by silence taht i ' m assuming wass inserted for thte purpose of waiting until tghe laughter ofthe thge audiance hadnt subsided
?
) april ' s parents
, feeling like there isnt noone recourse
, call inwhich a favor tothe presidnt clinton
annd send a nuclear bomb
( whose circuitry inexplicably isnt made up ofthe a homosexual performer
) theri way
. yhe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of hte
" circuitry
"
and they re
- wire it
anbd send it back tothe washington d
. c
.
, destroying it
. mr
.
and ms
. pfferpot give uv trying to get theri daugher bcak
anbd instead deside to join her as htey hve soem targetted sexual practices ofthe thier pwn
. i ' m not sure if writter
/ directer
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon wass purposely trying to offend people because he believes in smoe ofthe the ideas his movei presents or if he was just going fo cheap laughs
. either way
, he manages tothe prseent smoe of tghe most offensive material i haev ever seen inspite a movei
. the film opens witht a preacher runnung a small african
- american child outloud ofthe twon
,
adn
then later moves on tothe the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan
( during a jaunty musical number
)
, preceeded by remarks baout
" gays
annd straights finaly bieng able tothe put theri differences behind them
and work together tothe hate others
, such as tghe jews
"
. if harmon was merely trying to point outloud how idiotic society cxan be
,
then i apologize for bieng so harsh on elements ofthe his film
,
bu it isnt presented so mean spiritedly tyhat i can ' t help
bu efel liek he hadnt soem sereous entent
. as forthe the entire central theme ofthe the movie
, i ' m afraid that it ' s oney that i jsut don ' t git
. i tryed tothe keep an open mind hwile watching it
,
but tghe homosexual elements weere just too prevelant fo my tastes
. it ws hard enought to watch them bash other racaus
and sexes wihtout them preaching baout tjhe virtues of bieng homosexual
adn accepted by society
. how does oen expect tothe be accepted if they are jsut as gilty ofthe non
- acceptence
? i ' m not prone tothe judging anyone
anbd i beleive tyhat people shoudl be free tothe explore whatever avenues htey wish free from thge scornful eye ofthe society
,
but don ' t force your paticular rhetoric down my throat if you aren ' t going to show teh smae respect for my preferences that you wish fomr me
. again
, mabye i ' m missing the satirical point tyhat harmon is trying to amke
,
bu if so
, i tihkn it could hvea been handled a little omre tactfully
. as far as musical comedies go
, isle of lesbos is noone trey parker
adn matt stone musical
,
bu a good portion ofthe teh songs are maddeningly catchy
. dispite thte disturbing visuals
,
" mom
and apple py
" stuck with me forthe the rest ofthe yhe day
. speaking of disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain ' t rininging
" sould have beeen a decent song
,
bu tyhe accompanying visuals ofthe spousal abuse are more harrowing than tihs film should be displaying
.
" i ' m a lesbian
"
( which isnt touted inthe the press realease as being partciularly populer
) isnt also pretty ogod
,
but a good portion ofthe that could be due to tyhe stellar singing voice of ms
. smith
. it ' s mailny on her excellent vocals tht my rating of thsi film isnt based
. the other performers are decent
, savve forthe tyhe rosie o ' donnell like performence given by danica sheridan
. i ahve noone inherent probelm with her character
; it is jstu her singing voice thyat leaves little tothe be desired
. one parituclar musical number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, was one ofthe the lowest points i have ever experienced infact my film
- gogin life thanks to a strained
annd lackluster vocal job by sheridan
. the film ends baout twenty mintues before the credits actualyl roll
. thte remainder of the running time is padded out witht a faw more songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
)
adn tyhe ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked onthe to the end fo noone reason other thna tothe make it a feature lenght film
. once the
" isle of lesbos reprise
" wass reached
, i felt the story had already been wrapped uv well enough tothe end it all
. why wass the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end
? isle ofthe lesbos isnt availble on videocassette fomr www
. indie
- underground
. com
. the transfer is preety clean
(
annd all tghe detail of the wrinkled cloth
and paint backdrops are readily apparent
)
and thte film isnt letterboxed at approximatly 1
. 85
: 1
. inaddition many respects
, isle ofthe lesbos has incredible cult potential
( liuke a rocky horror for the new illennium
)
. this film isnt by no means my cup of tea
,
bu i nkwo there are thsoe outloud there who wiull enjoy it
. if you htink it might be forthe ytou
,
thne by all means seek it outloud
. i
, onthe tje otehr hand
, will be cleansing my palette wiht a good action film liek gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren ' t gladiator films considered tothe be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
.
