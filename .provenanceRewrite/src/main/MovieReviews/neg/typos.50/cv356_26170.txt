tyhe summer ofthe 00 ' wasn ' t a very ogod noe fo devout cinephiles
. it offred noone blair witches or sixth senses
; tyhe best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x
- men adaptions
and a flawed
but intertaining shaft update
. nurse betty signals tyhe unoffical end of tyhat dreadful summer movei season
annd tjhe commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season
, that battery
- charging
( at least for critics who have tothe sit thru eveyr piece o ' shit taht moseys into multiplexes
) time of year when all thsoe oscar contenders
( read
:
" quality
" films
) compeet for audiences
. alas betty has hte dubious disctinction ofthe bieng tjhe frist overpraised junk heap ofthe tyhe new season
. it ' s also indie directer neil labute ' s frist atempt at something resembling a mainstream picture
,
adn i ' m sad tothe report it ' s a resounding failure
( at least onthe thsi web site
)
, a mess that ' s as hopelessly saccharine as peple ahev accused labute ' s previvous films ofthe being unrelentingly masochistic
. i whent inaddition expecting something decent
, fo betty ws gleefully praised
, it ' s screenplay even winning an award at cannes
,
but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment
. are criticists so desperate fo something unique that they ' re blind tothe how derivitive the paticular brand ofthe
" uniqueness
" betty dolls out isnt
? forthe the first tyme labute isnt working from a scirpt he has not wroten
,
and he seems unsure ofthe how tothe handle the material
. betty trys to be hip liuke pulp fiction
( this is another flick featuring a pair ofthe strangely bright
and articulate hit men
)
, exchanching like thte wizard of oz
( of whihc this film makes sevral allusions to
)
anbd heartwarming like
[ stick inwhich your favorite loveable misfit movei
]
,
but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation
. it ' s labute ' s half hearted attemt to amke a crowd pleaser
and he doesn ' t even seem tothe hve half that heart in it
. nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict
, betty
( brilliantly palyed by renee zellweger
)
, who witnesses hte killing ofthe her husban
, del
( aaron eckhart playing tje most casually loutish husban usance richard benjamin infact diary ofthe a mad housewife
) by twpo hit men
( morgan freeman
and chris rock
)
. she happens to ahve her most beloved soap onthe inwhich the backround
annd somehow merges the two realities
. she ' s blocked outloud her husban ' s death
and thikns she ' s a character in her favorite soap
, a reason tothe lvoe
. betty sets outloud on the road to la
( with soem drugs unknowingly stashed inwhich her car trunk
) searching forthe her soap boyfriend dr
. david ravell
( greg kinnear
) hwile the two bickering hitted men follow in nto so close persuit
. teh labute who birthed the extrodinary inaddition the comapany ofthe men
, slipped a bited
(
bu nto much
) wiht his sophmore efford
, your friends
and neighbors
,
then fell straight on his ass with bash
, a play he penned taht ws recently aired onthe showtime
. tjhe play demonstrated no foward govement as an artist
, only labute ' s persistance inspite wallowing in tyhe horrid thigns
" average
" peopel dont tothe each otehr
, usually with outloud realizing how horrid htey themslves are
. infact the play
, paul rudd
, as an obnoxious jock
, delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man inot a bathroom
and beated him mabye to death
, hwile his clueless girlfriend essentialy regardes his sadistic behaviors as something along the ood maxim
" boys iwll be boys
"
. anohter character
, schlubby businessman reacts to hte loss of his job by actually killing his pwn baby
! what ws once so powerful baout labute ' s wrok
, yhe casual
, nonchalant cruelty
and selfishness
( oftenly elements we all have inspite us amplified tothe a disgusting degree
) hadnt become so over tyhe top it was borderline comic
. obviously
, at thsi point
, labute could use a dose ofthe some different kind ofthe material befor he pigeon holes hismelf futher
,
bu nurse betty isn ' t it
. he clearly has little passion for what he ' s doing here
, instead replacing his mojo wtih strained quirks
( one ofthe teh hit men isnt a huge soap fan
,
adn thge character ofthe betty owudl be littel moreso than a noe joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn ' t managed tothe transsend that
) tailor made tothe appeal to tghe widest possible audiance
. nearly eveyr scene between chris rock
anbd morgan freeman fatally slows thte picture down
, as hte twpo are made tothe enact soft
- boiled tarantino
- esque dialogue
. they evince little chemestry
, with rock constanly in over hte top rant mode
, acting moreso liek an angry comic tahn any hting ressembling a hit man
( an occupation that ' s represented far too frequently in movies nowdays
)
. i htikn rock is a great comic
yot he hasn ' t been able tothe bring his feral intleligence tothe movies
, whenever he acts
,
and no marter tjhe part
, it ' s like he ' s doign yhe damn chris rock sohw
. surprisingly
( at least concidering her wokr in me
, mysef
and irene
) renee zellweger gives a revelatory peformance
, buildng onthe her baby faced
, apple pie looks
. tath wide
- open face
adn helium voiced earnestness suggests a littel girl not fully grown inot her thirty
- yera
- old body
. it ' s hte best wrok she ' s ever done
. freeman is effective as alwyas
,
though his peformance nontheless suffers beccause it seems at odds with where tghe movei wants tothe take it
. the ator plays the role inspite his usual calm
, collected manner
,
though thte flick trys tothe insinuate a symbolical kinship betweeen his charcter
and betty ' s
, suggesting that both are controled by their fantasies rether tahn reality
. tht ' s intresting
bu the movie doesn ' t do anytying with it otehr thna kresh land the sub
- theme into a labored speek infront hte midst ofthe a badly staged gun battle
. tjhe film hasnt ogod moments
( many ofthe tyhe scenes involving a very ogod greg kinnear
, especially his confrontation with zellweger
)
, an alomst soothing
, lyrical score
(
adn yuo know a movie ' s iin trouble when thge score sticks outloud as one ofthe tje best things baout it
)
bu nothing jells
, it ' s parts
, good or bad
, are so disparate as tothe be opposing
. yhe film might ahev worked had it settled on bieng one type of film
, a mainstream
, female forrest gump or an oddball art film
,
bu as both if it falls as flat as diet coke
. betty ' s screenplay makes tyhe mistake of relying too much on concurrence
, wihtout which betty wouldn ' t amke any progress inwhich the film
. nurse betty isnt a film driven by coincidence rether thna charter
, liuke how betty becomes a nurse inwhich the film
, a job tyhat she takes infront order to get closer tothe her imaginery lover
; she happens to be at the hospital at tjhe excact moent thgat a drive by shooting tkaes place
anbd miraculously knwos how tothe tkae care of the victum ' s wound beccause she happened tothe see how onthe tv
, whlch leads tothe her bieng offred a room witht tjhe victum ' s girlfriend who eventualy gets betty inot a party where she meets kinnear
?
?
? a littel too tidy
, don ' tcha think
. betty hasnt an intresting theme
,
though it doesn ' t even seem aware of thsi
. tje current state ofthe tv hasnt beeen leaneant towords reality television whta wiht tghe enormous success ofthe survivor
anbd moderate success of big brother
, with more onthe teh way
. this is a film about a womens so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera isnt reality
( ironically rela
- life survivor sean kennif hasnt taken a part as a doctor onthe the soap opera guiding light
)
. instade ofthe exploring this timely matter in a way realting to tjhe current tv craze
( sicne tjhe film does largley apeared tothe be a satire ofthe television
, albiet oney that owudl fiel more appropiate infront the ' 80s than the ' 00s
)
, the film simply uses betty ' s delusions as a plot divice to get her fomr point a to b
. no progress is made
and little isnt unearthed except that mabey labute could ule a bit ofthe rest
and a lot ofthe contemplation
.
