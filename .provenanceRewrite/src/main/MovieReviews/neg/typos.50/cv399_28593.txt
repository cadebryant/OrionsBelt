you ' d think that affter awhile hollywood owudl stop trying to make movies outloud ofthe video ganes
. it hasn ' t worked so far
.
" strent fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing comander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" nto a watchable film inwhich the bunch
. still i held out smoe hope for
" tomb raider
.
" aftter all
, thge game ' s premise is heavily influented by tghe indiana jones trilogy
anbd all yhe mummy movies
, so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept
.
howver
, dispite the potential of the project
,
" tomb raider
" proves to be
yet another bomb
. tjhe plot is a convoluted accumulation ofthe nonsense probably borrowed ffrom a dozen bad movies
. htere ' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- years alignment ofthe planets comming up
,
anbd hte illuminati have tothe fidn both halves of an ancient triagnle that controlls tiem in order to take over the world
. of course
, hte ancient folks who divided the trianlge buried yhe halves inthe tombs onthe oposite sides of tghe world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds tghe key tht opens the tombs in relics thyat her dead father
( jon voight
) dug up
. she figures that if she gets tyhe trangle
, she can bring her dad back from tyhe dead
. ofthe course
, no one ws expecting much ofthe a plot from tihs movei anyway
. inwhich both video ganes
annd acation movies
, thte plot isnt jstu an excuse fo the acation sequences
.
howver
, hte action inthe
" tomb raydr
" shows littel style or originality
. htere ' s lots of shooting
adn some kung fu fightin '
,
but none ofthe it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct
- tothe
- cable flick
. the otehr goofy archeologist flick of tghe summer
,
" yhe mummy returns
,
" was much better
; it had its flaws
,
but its action was creative
adn large
- scale
. since winning her acedemy award for
" girl
, interrupted
,
" jolie hasn ' t taked any projects that owudl display her acting talents
.
" tomb raider
" seems to be omre intersted in displaying her breasts
; so much attension is drawn to them that it ' s a shame ther ' s noone oscar for best performence by a wonderbra
. hwile we don ' t see much ofthe her acting ability
( with tyhe exception ofthe a wonderfull opper
- crust british accent
)
, we dont get a hint ofthe jolie ' s less savory side
. considering thge rumors ofthe incest thgat hang over jolie
annd her supposed obsession withthe death
, having lara be obsessed wih resurrecting her dead father
(
and uninterested iin any of the living malless aroud her
) seems a poore choise
. haveing jolie ' s real life father jon voight play tjhe dead dad mkaes it even creepier
. i haven ' t decided whta to make ofthe director simon west
yot
. his frist feature was tjhe star
- studded disaster
" con air
,
"
bu my opinion ofthe him improved with
" the genaral ' s daughter
,
" which ws thick wtih sultry atomsphere
. now htis turain wreck
. i hope he improves again becasue his enxt project is the big screen version of the cult tv series
" yhe prisoner
.
" hollywood hasnt alrady screwed up
" the avengers
,
"
annd
" the prisoner
" represents a chance fo redemption
.
( by the way
, speaking of british tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans shoudl look forthe chris
" rimmer
" barrie inwhich his first major film role
)
