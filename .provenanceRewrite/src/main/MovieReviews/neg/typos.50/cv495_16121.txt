in thte finale of disney ' s
" mighty joe young
,
" a 15
- foot tall
, 2000
- pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel
anbd plummets tothe the ground
. apon impact
, rugged everyman
and perennial do
- gooder bill paxton rushes infact
, containing the emotional crowd with an earnest
" move allong now folks
, ther ' s nothing to see here
.
" ok
, so those aren ' t exactly hte words he uses
,
but it ' s probably one of the fewd clich
? s nto uttered in this unecessary remake ofthe an unneccesary remake ofthe thyat mother of all monster movies
,
" king kong
.
" 1949 ' s
" mighty joe young
" was an update ofthe that clasic creature feature
, allso based on merian c
. cooper ' s orignal stroy
( 16 yersa affter
" ' kong
" it appeared the world was ready for a newyorker take on the beauty
and tyhe beast fable
)
. now some 49 years later
, at least according to disney ' s way of thikning
, the world is ready for oney mroe
. nto so
. the onyl
-
-
and i mean only
-
- reason to see tghe 1998 verzion isnt for teh speical effects
.
annd theese
, unfortunately
, run hot
adn cold
. today ' s joe young isnt designed
annd produced by speshal
- effects whiz rick baker
, who has been wowing audiences with his state
- ofthe
- thte
- art make
- uv effects since 1971 ' s
" schlock
"
( hwihc
, incidently
, featured a baker
- enhanced
" gerilla
"
)
. joe is a combination ofthe animatronic effects
, coputer graphics
,
annd thta ood standart
, a man iin a monkey suit
. hwile there are occassional flashes ofthe brillance
-
- baker ' s had a lot of practice with simian effects
, aftter all
, includng
" gorillas infront thte mist
,
"
" greystoke
: tghe legend ofthe tarzan
, lord of hte apes
,
"
anbd the 1976 remake ofthe
" king kong
"
-
- htere ' s also some surprising cheesiness
. oen ofthe the film ' s most embarrasing moments is when paxton ' s band of african trackers frist encounter
anbd persue the larger
- than
- life primate
( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from
" tje lost world
: jurassic park
"
)
. paxton jubilantly extols teh beast ' s majestic gagit at teh same excact moment as joe
,
adn the cmoputer effects driving him
, stutter tothe a halt
. allso
, if thge film ' s producers had wanted us tothe foucs our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn ' t have paraded female lead charlize theron
(
" trial
& error
"
) around in a seemingly
- endless wardobe of spaghetti
- strapped tops
. even joe seems distracted at times
. tjhe film piles onthe the clich
? s liuke htere ' s noone tomorrow
, including the predictable plot
( anthro
- zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l
. a
. where urban havoc is inevitably wrought
)
, predictable villain
( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace
)
, predicatble lvoe story
( bill
anbd charlize
-
- surprise
!
)
,
annd predictable denouement
(
" ' twas box
- office receipts that killed the byast
"
)
. kids raised onthe
" men inthe balck
"
( non
- monkey effects also by baker
) are oging tothe fidn ron
(
" tremors
"
) underwood ' s outing a little lame by comparison
. while certainly better than 1978 ' s
" king kong lives
"
( itself a lousy sequel tothe a nto partcularly good remake
)
,
" mighty joe young
" proves how tjhe mighty keep falling
