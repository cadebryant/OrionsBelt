,
= amageddon does not
. very much liek deepo impact
, a meteor is heading towords earth
and they
= didn ' t relize it until 18 dyas from impact
. deepo impact settled iwth
= the modest meteor size as larg as teh city ofthe newyorker york
but armageddon
= just had to be bigger
.
.
.
. well about the size ofthe texas
( thast kinda meteor

. j
.
annd harry struts it out

= is place in a positon where she is unable tothe take sides
, so she rimaniss
= seated in the nasa control tower
, crying over both ofthe them iin baout 80
%
= ofthe the movie

= anguish ofthe the world isnt potrayed with scenes ofthe people praying
, runing
= fo theri lives or just sitting still staring at thte sky

- form
= into ridiculity
, beyond the plane believability
, where people still
= accept even if tehy didn ' t believe
. deepo inpact was ridiculous in most
= aspestus
and i believe the makers nkwo this
. thge thing is
, they desided
= tothe shroud myth
anbd fantasy witht a purely believable human tale of
= sufferring
and comming in terms with ones problems
, which ultimatly
= brang it above yhe ashes which it hadnt initially put itself infront
.
= armageddon
