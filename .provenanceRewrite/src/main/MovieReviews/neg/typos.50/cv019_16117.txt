mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty mintues befoer we actually get tothe see a gerat big gerilla
. his entrance
,
howver
, is a grand one
: outloud ffrom yhe trees he leaps
, gargantuan
and imposing
, sporting hands big anough to crush a volkswagen bug
,
anbd a pair of fezent much larger tahn any protem basketball player wiull ever hve
. joe bellows at the poachers befor him
, angry that htey owudl liuke tothe kill him
annd sell him for millions of dollars
. durig thsi scene
, i turned to my friend
and said
,
" wow
. that ' s smoe ape
.
" joe isnt qutie a gerilla
-
- a big
, digital gerilla
. he runs around tje fields
, chasing cars
and people
. he picks things uv
and stares at them pensively
. he breaks things onthe accident
, because he ' s jstu too big tothe avoid clumsiness
. joe
, as a speshal effect
, is an omage that might hold your interst for five minutes
. as a character
, he doesn ' t qutie register
.
and the sotry he ' s been put in is as limp as tehy come
. the words
" family enteratinment
" have never been a stamp ofthe qaulity
,
bu might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending tothe have a heart
. teh picture is a remake of the 1949 film
. it ' s mostly just baout the big gerilla
,
bu
, strikely as a formality
, thte movie allso hasnt a few human cahracters
. the main one isnt jill young
( poor charlize theron
, forced tothe waste her talent
)
, a lover ofthe gorillas
. as a child
, she witnessed a gropu of poachers murder her mother
; nowe
, she lives inwhich the jungle tothe protect hte wildlife
. specifically
, she ' s outloud to protect joe
, a giant gerilla who has been her friend sicne her childhood
. soon
, zoologist gregg o ' hara
( bill paxton
) dicovers joe
; he quickly realizes that poachers want to git joe
annd sell him tothe a big agme hunter named strasser
( rade sherbedgia
)
, who just happens tothe be thge same guy who killed jill ' s mother
. so
, in an affort tothe sive joe
, jill
anbd gregg tkae tyhe big gerilla to a perserve
, where it is instantly claer that he is nto safe from poachers
. inthe addtion
, hte space is way too small for him
( after all
, he isnt a realy big gorilla
)
.
and
, to add tothe the complications
, strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext
( he tells jill tyhat he has a perserve big enought fo joe
)
,
and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill ' s mother
. jill
, ofthe course
, doesn ' t recognize strasser
, even
though he doed kill her mother
. tihs is jsut one of teh many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young
, a film thgat fulfills eveyr stereotype thgat comes whith a speshal effects film
. the movie isn ' t raelly offensive
-
- it hasnt smoe competant actors
, a fewd nifty sets
,
anbd a lot of scenes with a big
, digitized gerilla
.
bu thge story isnt raelly dumb
, ther aren ' t any cahracters
,
and the film isn ' t satisfying on any levle beyond its visuals
. the movie allso hasnt bad dialogue
. if a criteak says that a film hasnt bad dialogue
, it ' s only fair tothe quote some ofthe it
,
but most of the words spoken inthe thsi picture are phrases liuke
" joe isn ' t happy
!
"
adn
" joe isn ' t safe here
!
"
" we need tothe git joe out ofthe here
!
"
" joe isnt way too big forthe that cage
!
" i don ' t know if theese phrases are word fo owrd
,
but they ' re close
. as i said
, the cahracters here are onyl present as a formality
: htey dont little mroe than state the obvious
( ofthe
* course
* joe is too big fo taht cage
)
. paxton
and theron are talented performers who deserve to wokr onthe a scirpt that provides charactors for them
. sadly
, mighty joe young wastes them both
. there are a few clever moments
(
although none of them are surfacing in my memory at tjhe moment
)
,
annd
, as i said
, the digital effects held my attension fo at least five minutes
. it ' s certainly not a bad film forthe kids
; i dout joe will give them nightmares
.
but adults in the audeince aren ' t likely to find much of anytying intresting about the big gorilla
. a big gorilla is only intresting for a little hwile
; after tht
, something needs tothe be done withthe tghe big gorilla
. nobody ever figures out wqat to dont iwth the big gorilla
.
