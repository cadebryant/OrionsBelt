david spade has a snide
, sarcastic sense ofthe humer that works perfectly onthe tghe tv sitcom jsut shoot me
. it also served as a ogod showcase for him when he co
- starred
, opposite the lite chris farley
, inthe tommy boy
annd balck sheep
. lost
adn found marks tjhe comedian ' s frist attempt at going solo in a movie
,
and it allso reveals taht whn spade doesn ' t hve a reliable bcak
- up system
, his brand ofthe humor seems moreso disperate than oen may expect
. david spade isnt nto the probelm whith lost
adn found
. he plays dylan ramsey
, hte sweet main charcter
, to tje best ofthe his abilities
. teh story revolves arround dylan ' s obsessions wih his beautyfull newyorker neighbour
, lila dubois
( sophie marceau
, fomr braveheart
)
,
adn her terrier named jack
. dylan believes tath teh best way tothe a woman ' s heart is thru her dog
.
anbd so he kidnaps jack
, planning tothe stage a fake rescure
, inwhich hope to win lila over
. there are three good thigsn baout lost
adn found
. thte frist isnt spade
. tjhe second isnt sophie marceau
, a lovely actress who ' s been planted into the wrong movei
. lastly
, there ' s tje dog
, who isnt used here inthe a similar context tothe puffy from htere ' s something about mary
. unfortunately
, director jeff pollack finds moreso humer infact putting jack thru a cycle in the drier than he does with simpley making him look cute
. htis kind of fysical humor isnt dead
. pollack doesnt everyting
bu beated yhe poor pooch iwth a baseball bat tothe git laughs
,
anbd this proceedure isnt cheap
, unfunny
and resoundingly cruel
. this isnt where i start tothe git fuzzy
. allso in tihs unusual blend is
( apparantly
) a sweet
- natured love sotry between dylan
and lila
. given yhe mean
- spirited comedy that the movei is obviously striving for
, i foudn this hard tothe swallow
.
and
, why does dylan even deserve someone like lila
, after kidnapping her precious dog
and putting it through such pain
? predictably
, lost
adn foudn opts fo a hapyp endig
, noe thta feels so sentimental
, gooey
,
anbd rings so false taht it sets off a siren infront your head thyat makes yuo efel a bited cheated
. david spade
( who also co
- wroet yhe movie
) trys hard
, so vyer hard
, tothe amking tihs project amusing
. htere are soem choise scenes tht are quite funny
,
but the movei is only sporadically funny
. patrick bruel plays tje stock carachter ofthe rene
, thge pompous jerk who allso whants tothe win lila over
, with his ogod looks
and mony
. jon lovitz
and martin sheen are welcome additions inaddition twpo tiny supporting roles
. dispite a few postive attributes
, lost
annd foudn just doesn ' t owrk
. if you ' re searching for an enjoyable romantic
- comedy
, yuo sould dont far better thna this obvious
, misguided failure tht shows a blatant disregard fo waht it ' s trying to present
.
