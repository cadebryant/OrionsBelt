tghe rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images
. the tinkling christmas tree bell in
" it ' s a wonderfull life
.
" bogie ' s speach at the aiport infront
" casablanca
.
" littel elliott ' s flying bycicle
, silhouetted by the moon in
" e
. t
.
"
and nowe
,
" starship troopers
" directer paul verhoeven adds oen mroe image that will live in our memories forever
: doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug
.
" starship troopers
,
" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel
, is teh story ofthe an interstellar war between humans
anbd giant insects
. in the hands of verhoeven
, the mamuth sci
- fi battle flick is one ofthe the most astonishingly bad films ever made
, a monument to inept filmmaking on a collosal scale
. to put it simply
, it ' s a bug bomb
. infact
" robocop
"
and
" total reacll
,
" verhoeven displayed a gift forthe creating an intertaining mix of violence
, speical effects
and social satire
,
and
" starship troopers
" starts off iin similar fashon
, wtih a tongue
- in
- cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise
. things go downhill fast
,
though
, as we meet our hereos
, a gropu of buenos aires teens preparing tothe graduate from high school
. inexplicably
, johnny rico
, carmen ibenez
, dizzy flores
and xander barcalow are plyed by square
- jawed anglo kids who look liek they jstu stepped out of a mountain dew commercial
. it ' s a veritable
" alpha centuri 90210
" as we watch the lveo
- smitten teens squabble in the nmae ofthe love
. michael ironside plays their teacher
, who waves aroud a cheesy fake severed arm hwile lecturing about civic responsibilities
. evenhtually
, hte kids join the military
, wiht dreams of glory in their addled littel minds
. oney of their classmates
, carl jenkins
(
" doogie houser ' s
" neil patrick harris
,
) snags a job inspite miliraty intelligence becouse ofthe his strong pyschic abilties
. he displays his gft by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl uv his mother ' s leg
. a long
, dull boot camp sequence follows
, enlivened onyl by an extended coed showfer scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as thte
" showgirls
" directer ' s camera roams over their buff bodies
. finally
, a full hour into hte film
, the war fianlly starts
annd we meet thte enemy
. hte bugs hail ffrom klendathu
adn colonize planets by hurling their spores inot spoace
. tehy attack starships by spinning arround
and firing deadly plasma blasts from theri rears
. yes
, increadible as it seems
, the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts
. a phenomenally large amount ofthe mony wass spended creating tje computer animated insects
and teh results are mixed at best
. sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing tothe attack are both impressive
and scry
,
bu the close
- ups are a differant marter
. the insects hvae an odd
, artifical look
, liek origami creations with a mottled plastic coating
. thte attack scenes are intensely voilent
, as oney woudl expect ffrom verhoeven
,
bu thge overall look is too phony to generate any real tension
. while the action is frantic
, the miliraty strategy
, wildly illogical even by hollywood standars
, grows tiresome quicklyu
. verhoeven trys to spice things uv by throwing inwhich more satiric news coverage
,
bu the faux
- jingoistic scenes ofthe childrens
" doing their part for thte war affort
" by squishing roaches onthe a sidewalk aren ' t enought to mkea uv for the long stretches ofthe sheer dreck
. noe can only guess wqat paul verhoeven was trying tothe dont here
. his customary oen part satire
, twpo parts ultra
- violence formula is way out ofthe whack
,
and most of tjhe film jstu flounders
. in
" showgirls
" fashon
, smoe scenes are allmost bad enough tothe be good
. an intergalactic kegger party
, iwth jake busey palying
" dixie
" onthe a green plexiglas fiddle
, has a certain bizzare appeal
. a sex scene betweeen twpo ofthe thte teens acheives a smarmy charm
, enhanced a few minutes later wehn the female receives a fatal jab ffrom a bug
,
but tells her hero that she doesn ' t mind dieing
.
" it ' s okay
,
" she gasps
,
" i got to have you
!
"
and
hten
, ofthe course
, htere ' s doogie ' s mind meld witht a bug
. it ' s possibile taht verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to yhe era ofthe the orginal novel
. heinlein ' s pre
-
" stranger in a stange land
" books were aimed at adolescent malless
,
and
" starship troopers
" has hte antiseptic retro
- future look ofthe lite 50s
/ early 60s sci
- fi
. the noe cityscape shown isnt a jetsons
- like gleaming metropolis
, whith flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting
. teh hairstyles are retro too
, straight fomr tje frankie avalon
, annette funicello school of fashion
. ultimately
, verhoeven ' s motives are irrelavent
. he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire
. it even fails to be an intertaining bad movie
. avoid
" starship troopers
" at all costs
.
