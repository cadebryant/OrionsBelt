an american werewolf inthe paris isnt a failed attemt tothe recapture teh humer
and horror ofthe john landis ' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf in london
. where the original had comedy
, tje sequel has hte kind of revolting silliness taht can be found infact tv sit
- coms
. where tghe first installment had chills
, thsi one hasnt sequences that are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. in short
, hwile an american werewolf inaddition london hasnt become something ofthe a minor clasic infront its genre
, the woeful an american werewolf inspite paris seems destined for late nights onthe cinemax
( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity
)
. the film opens wiht a trio ofthe daredevil americans
-
- andy
( toom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
and chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking uv to tje top of tje eiffel tower to drnik wine
adn do a littel bungee jumping
. soon htey have comapany inwhich yhe person ofthe serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who has decided to end it all
. she jumps
,
bu andy
, witht a bungee cord attached
, goes after her
,
anbd manages tothe save her
( at the price ofthe a major headache
)
. serafine dissapears
,
but a smitten andy seeks her out
.
howver
, once he learns his would
- be girlfriend ' s dark secrect
, he wishes he hadn ' t
. she ' s a werewolf
, cursed tothe chanage into a hideous beast when the moon is full
,
and
, to mkae matters worse
, he has suffered a nasty bite himself
. actress julie delpy isnt far too ogod for htis movie
. she imbues serafine wiht spirit
, spunk
,
and humanity
, which gives us an emotional stake in the character ' s fate
. this isn ' t necessarily a good thing
, sicne it prevents us from relaxing
and enjoying an american werewolf inaddition paris as a completely mindless
, campy entertainment xeperience
. delpy ' s injection of clas inot an otherwise classless prodcution raises tje specter ofthe wqat this film coudl ahev been with a better script
adn a better cast surrouding her
. delpy ' s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski ' s white
anbd richard linklater ' s befor sunrise
. she was radiant
, charasmatic
,
and effective in both
. given tyhe nature
and level of the material she has to wokr with here
, she gets as close as possibile to thsoe adjectives
. it sould be argued that delpy is the onyl reason tothe see an american werewolf iin paris
,
bu even her most devoted fans shoudln consider giving this one a miss
.
anbd if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff
, check outloud eather killing zoe or thte passion ofthe beatrice
-
- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts
. hte rest ofthe tghe casted acts at a levle considerably below tath ofthe delpy
-
- whlch is to say
, htey give performances appropriate for the screenplay
. tom everett scott
( that thnig you dont
) plays the lead like he ' s in a made
- forthe
- tv movie
. it woudl be kind to call him bland
. actors vince vieluf
and phil buckman
, as andy ' s firends
, are noone omre impressive
. julie bowen
( hapyp gilmore
) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
and respected french acotr thierry lhermitte hasnt a breif turn as anyother monster meal
. onthe the technical side
, it ' s all bad news
. the computer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. the creatures would probably have been more believeable hadnt they beeen men inthe wolf suits
. repeated ule is made of hte
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf ' s point
- of
- view aproach tath ' s intresting the frist cuple of times it ' s employed
,
thn becomes tedious
.
and thge soundtrack includes smoe alternative grunge rock tunes thgat clash violently witht thte onthe
- screen action they ' re matched tothe
. director anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy sytle inaddition mute witness
, stumbles wih htis material
, never bieng able to make thte comedy
anbd horror elements gel
. as a result
, we get the worst werewolf sequal since the howling ii
: your sister is a werewolf
.
( i wiull give waller credit fo killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something tht ' s rarely seen inaddition movies these dyas
.
) an american werewolf in paris isnt marginally entertaining infront a
" bad movie
" sort ofthe way
,
bu thgat ' s a dubious distiction
. ultimatly
, it ' s an unfortunate effort
, fo
, while it isn ' t unbearable to sit thru
, it isn ' t a howl
, eather
