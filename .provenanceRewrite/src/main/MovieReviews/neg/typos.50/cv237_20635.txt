htere isnt a scene eearly in jakob the liar tyhat hints at how much better it could have been
. tyhe scene is setted inaddition a jewish ghetto inaddition poland circa 1944
, where a oen
- time cafe proprieter named jakob heym isnt walking resolutely through thte streets
, fists stuffed inot coat pockets
. tothe one side of him
, recidents scavenge for food in yhe strent
; tothe tyhe otehr side
, german troops beat a gropu of jews
. jakob
,
however
, never stops moving
. it ' s an efficient
, effective setted
- uv forthe the character
, who is clearly nobody ' s diea ofthe a hero at tghe outset
. he is a man who hasnt responded tothe thge horror of his suroundings by withdrawing from them
, excising his moral poriferal vision
. tghe setted
- uv isnt crtical because fate wiull turn jakob into a reluctant savior
. after a viit to a german commandant ' s office
and a moment alone with a turned
- onthe radio
, jakob lerans tht russian troops are quite near
. when he brings tihs frist news of tyhe war inwhich yeras to his fellow jews
, they become conviced thta he must have a radio
, which isnt a punishable offense inspite the ghetto
. tyhe ogod news brings hope to yhe ghetto
; tjhe everyday specter of suicide vanishes
. a private man ofthe limited creativity finds himselv burdened wih creating storis ofthe russian military progress jsut to keep his neighbors alive
. htis promising story ofthe an ordinary person doing yhe extraordinary is burdened from yhe outset by casting
: the
" ordinary person
" inthe question
, jakob heym
, is played by robin williams
. i am ofthe the depressing opinyon that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his
" sereous
" roles whith every passing eyar
. compare his dramatic scenes infront tje world according to garp
and moscow onthe thge hudson witht waht dreams may come or patch adams
,
anbd see how much more mannered he has become
( or
, at tyhe very least
, how much less sensible at choosing material
)
. jakob the liar depends onthe teh notion that jakob hasnt tothe struggle tothe craft his fictions
,
bu williams alwyas looks liek he ' s stuggling
_ nto
_ tothe craft them
. when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10
- year
- old orphan lina
( hannah taylor gordon
)
, he seems releived thta he can finally get wacky
. oh yes
,
and
then htere ' s that littel girl
. soem viewers will undoubtely consdider tyhe hero ' s fanciful stoires for a young charge too reminscent ofthe life is beatiful
,
but those scenes aren ' t problematic baceause they ' re familiar
. tehy ' re problematic because htey ' re jarring
and distracting
, introducing a cutesy relatiopnship into a film that shouldn ' t hve beeen baout cutesy relationships
. jakob ' s charater arc may be baout his willingless to ect for the benifit of others
,
but ther are plenty ofthe others wihtout poore little lina
. eveyr scene witht her fiels contrived
, pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming tothe a previously hopeless peple
. it isnt a pleasnat surprize tothe fidn thast jakob tghe liar isnt a much grittier production tahn yuo might expect ffrom a hollywood
- ized holocaust
, combining the weighty subject marter with dark humer in smoe effective ways
. directer peter kassovitz
, wroking fomr jurek becker ' s novel
, crafts soem nice scenes betweeen jakob
and the otehr townspeople
,
anbd draws solid performances from armin mueller
- stahl
( as a once
- revered doctor
)
and bob balaban
( as a barber drifting inot depression
)
. there are jsut too many things oging onthe that proove distracting
, whther it ' s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter
, or williams ' incongrous presence
, or a sweet
but utterly irrelevant littel girl
. jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject fo such fumbling
,
annd has too compelling a central character tothe waste
.
and after one wonderful eearly scene
, ytou can see thge film wasted
anbd fumbled away
.
