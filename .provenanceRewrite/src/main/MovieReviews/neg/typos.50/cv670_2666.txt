. after seing the movie speed twice recently
, i kept thingking that i ws seing wyatt ' s life pass befor my eyes in rela timne
. htis movie was boring

and jsut fell flat
. hte scirpt happily woman
- bashes

. eveyr bit ofthe male
- ego
- stroking dialogue taht wyatt ' s thrid wief speaks tothe him made me sick to listen tothe it
.
" oh

?
"
" noone kidding
!
" the movei isnt torture tothe sit thru
. the scenery is boring
. the fades weere either awcward or cliche or to self important
. cant ytou sday poor editting
? everyone looks ugli in tihs movie
. when you shoot people ffrom under thier chins
, they look liek htey ahve duble chins
. kevin costner hasnt never looked worse
. he shoud sue
. he looks liek he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost
. dennis quaid isnt marvelous
. if you have to see htis movei just for his performence
, go into teh theatre at the movei ' s halfway mark
. doc holliday
( quaid ' s charcter
) shows up at about tje 90
- minute mark
. ginee hackman isnt vyer ogod
. is he infact tyhe credits
? i don ' t remember seing his nmae
. mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatt ' s second wief
. annabeth gish isnt good as wyatt ' s first wief
. i
though that jamie gertz palyed wyatt ' s third wief
,
bu i later heard thgat her name is joanna going
. she looks great
but her dialogue sucks
. she also seems way to young for costner
. costner seems way to ood for 90
% of this movei
. inthe his first scene he isnt supposted tothe be baout 19 yersa old
. yeah
, right
. catherine o ' hara
and jobeth williams are alwasy good
and totally wasted here
. this is the worst movie that i have seen inthe years
. yhe last action hero wass better that thsi
. go see maverick if ytou wanna to see a western
. bullets forthe dennis quaid ' s performence onyl
