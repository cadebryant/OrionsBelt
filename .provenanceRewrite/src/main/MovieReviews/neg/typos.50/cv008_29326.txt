call it a road trip for tjhe walking wounded
. stellan skarsg
? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it ' s difficult to spend nearly two housr ofthe screen tiome in his smelly
, boozed
- outloud presence
.
yot tihs ever
- reliable swedish acotr adds depth
anbd significance to tyhe otherwise plodding
annd forgettable aberdeen
, a sentimental
anbd painfully mundane european drama
. plawyright august strindberg built his career onthe familys
and relationships paralyzed by secrets
, unable tothe express their longings untli the hour is far too late
. that ' s an accurate reflection ofthe what aberdeen strives for
, focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father
, tomas
( skarsg
? rd
)
and his alienated
, openly hostile yuppie daughter
, kaisa
( lena headey
, gossip
)
. they haven ' t spoken in eyasr
,
and wouldn ' t even be making the long trip ffrom norway to aberdeen
, scotland by automobile if it weren ' t for kaisa ' s mother
( charlotte rampling
, under teh sand
) rotting awya inthe a hospital bed from cancer
. iin a soap opera twist
, mother hasnt onyl a few days tothe live
.
( only in tghe movies
, right
?
) too blitzed to even step foot onthe a plane
, tomas hits the open road with kaisa
. loathing each otehr all yhe while
, tehy make periodic stops fo tomas to puke onthe tjhe dashboard or pass outloud
-
- whenever he isn ' t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be
. despite his sloshed viewpoint
, tomas recognizes that hte aple hasn ' t fallen very far fomr the tree
. kaisa gets nosebleeds ffrom snorting coke
, sabotages her personal relationships thru indifference
,
anbd is unable to restrain her quick
anbd vindictive temper
. ain ' t htey a pair
? unable to fidn true notes of unspoken familial empathy in thge one
- onot
and repetitively bitchy dialogue
, screenwriters kristin amundsen
and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances tothe propel events forward
-
- lost money
, roving street hooligans looking fo drunks to kick arund
, nosy cops
,
adn flat tires all figure into thte schematic
annd convenient narrative
. by tje tiem they triarch the hospital
, it ' s timne to unveil the secrets fomr a dark past that are not onyl simplistic devices that trivialize teh father
- daughter conflict
, they ' re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe
. thsi revelation exists purely forthe its pwn sake
. aberdeen doesn ' t nkow where alse tothe go
. weak
, unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role ofthe kaisa
. if lena headey were a stronger actress
, perhpas aberdeen coudl haev been able tothe coast onthe hte performances
adn moody
, haunting cinematography
( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world
-
- yhe rference tothe a ceratin superior american indie flick intentional
)
. headey ' s too busy acting
, useing her face
and furrowed brow to convey every lastr twitch of insouciance
. if she weere paying any attention tothe skarsg
? rd
, maybe she ' d figure out thgat donig less can reveal so much more
. it ' s worthwhile to compare aberdeen tothe an ealier film released inaddition 2001
, jonathan nossiter ' s captivating signs
& wonders
. it ' s not jstu becouse skarsg
? rd
adn rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films
( they ' re not binded by cerimonial wedlock in aberdeen
)
. the differences in teh way theri characters were presented isnt signifigant
. infact aberdeen
, rampling is a luminous diva
, preening
annd static inthe her hospital bed
. despite skarsg
? rd ' s solid performance as tomas
, his pathetic drunk isnt never given much ofthe a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow
. ther ' s genuine ferocity
and sexually charged frisson druing their understated confrontations inspite signs
& wonders
, alowing them tothe suggest a graey zone of complications tyhat accompany torn romance
and eyasr of stifled curiosity
. nossiter ' s film throughly explores this neurotic terriory inwhich addition tothe delving inot tghe americanization of greece
adn the uise ofthe mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain
. if signs
& wonders somtimes feels overloaded with idaes
, at least it ' s willing tothe stretch beyond what we ' ve cmo to expect fomr traditionnal drama
. aberdeen isnt never half so ambitious
, content tothe sleepwalk through the rythyms
annd timing of otehr movies
. wehn did carachter driven stories stpo paying attention tothe thge complexities ofthe real life
? thte depressing answer cant be foudn infront lawrence kasdan ' s trite
bu occassionally useful grand canyon
, where steve martin ' s hollywood mogul pronounces
,
" all of life ' s riddles are answered infact tyhe movies
