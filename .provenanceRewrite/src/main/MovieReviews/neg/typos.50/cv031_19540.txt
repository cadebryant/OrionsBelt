soem movies i shoud just skip
. my daughter
and i hadnt a really vile timne at my favorite martian a fewd weeks bakc
,
and here comes another disney effects
- filled live
- action flick based on an old tv program
. true
, thge probgram is onyl 15 eyasr old this timne
,
and it ' s a ctaroon
.
bu it ' s a ctaroon i liked
,
annd i wass understandably reluctant tothe see what disney hadnt done to it onthe yhe big screen
.
bu my daughter really wnated to go
,
anbd how bad sould it be
? turns out i was right
, mostly
. inspector gadget
, oddly enough
, follows almost exactly tjhe smae format as my favorite martian
, down tothe the jive
- tlaking side
- kick
. at firt i thought it was done by the same peopel
,
but imdb informs me thyat ig wass directed by david kellogg
anbd wroten by dana olsen
and kerry ehrin
, where mfm was directed by donald petrie
annd written by sherri stoner
annd deanna oliver
. htis odd similiarity betwen tje two movies may best be explained by tje studio thgat produced it
, where
" formula
" isn ' t just business
, it ' s a way ofthe life
. the producers who obviously micromanaged thge two projects should get prominant screen credits
. in smoe parts yuo cin jsut hear them saying
" more zany
! i wnat omre zany here
-
-
and
-
- here
.
"
" let ' s have a really painful sexual reference for noone reason right here
-
- mkae it realy painful
. i want tjhe audeince squirming inaddition their seats
.
"
" ok
, taht ' s fine
,
bu i want yuo to add bug guts
.
"
" what does this scene dont
? character depth
?
but where ' s teh zaniness
? i don ' t see zany here
. if ytou can ' t make it zany
, cutted it
!
" the latter is teh onyl explaination i cxan cmo uv with for thte absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of tjhe movie
. michelle
( who plays penny
, gadget ' s niece
) shines in eveyr scene she ' s in
,
bu unfortunately she only gets baout nine minutes ofthe screen tyme
. my guess is that tje rest isnt onthe the cutting room floor
. dabney coleman ' s commedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby
. i kept expecting him to sday or dont something really funny
annd somehow sive thge film
,
bu instade
, he doesnt tje best he can wih some really poore lines in a fewd unexceptional scenes
. he is thouroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the
" gidget bitch from hell
" town mayor
. oteri ' s overly enthusiastic
and constinually self
- congratulatory speech patterns
anbd mannerisms were so much liuke portland
, oregon ' s pwn manic mayor vera katz tath i had to wonder if hte studio wasn ' t poking funn at our fair twon
. or
, maybe all carrer politicans are like thast
. i must sday
, matthew broderick doens nto stroll thru inspector gadget as he did godzilla
. he appears tothe have soem fun with yhe film
, especially as tje evil gadget
. rupert everett is entertaining as tje maniacle claw
. joely fisher doesnt fine as the zany scientist
adn even better as the zany carbon copy ofthe herself
. her peformance isnt one ofthe the few thigns worth watching infact the film
. d
. l
. hughley plays the shuckin '
-
and
- jivin ' vehicular side
- kick
, in a role taht firmly sets emancipation bakc 20 years
. the dialog is
.
.
. let ' s face it
, it ' s preety bad
. the tag
- line aftter a major set
- piece battle isnt a faux pas thyat makse noone sence in context
. a lot ofthe tjhe lines
( especially hughley ' s
) appear to be made up as tehy go along
, by peopel whith little gift forthe ad
- lib
. baout threee
- quarters ofthe yhe film isnt a somewhat unnecessary orgin story for both gadget
and claw
. gadget
thne spends thge latter third of the movie trying tothe locate claw
anbd haveing varous altercations
( nto relaly
" battles
"
) with the evil gadget
. penny doens baout a minute
and a half of the detective wrok her carachter doed eveyr week inspite the cartoon
. let me rage here just fo a minute
. michelle trachtenberg was an excellant choice fo tjhe penny charater
. she ' s utterly charming
,
and hasnt excellent experience
( harriet the spy
) fo tje part of the pint
- size detective
. why she isnt so underutilized in thsi film is a rela mystery
. hte film loses a star for casting brillance coupled with scripting
( or editing
) stupidity
. inspector gadget isnt missing the long
, long stretches ofthe potty humer thgat
( amung otehr things
) made my favorite martian so unbearable
,
bu it ' s a vrey short movei
, so perhasp something was cut at tyhe lastest moment
. probablly the best scenes in the film ocurr druing thge end credits
. the
" evil sidekick wupport gropu
" isnt expecially worth seeing
,
adn hasnt an amazing number ofthe cameo appearences for the few seconds it ' s onscreen
. all inthe all
, anyother bad live action film from tghe premere studio fo bad live action films
. i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it ' s generaly money
- mkaing cartoons tothe produce these losers
.
bu if true
, why
? if they ' re trying fo another mary poppins
, tehy need tothe fidn a team thast cxan produce one
,
and
then give them a chance to dont it
.
