. critique
: tihs movie did nto make me laff once
. perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it
. perhasp
. perhaps it ws becuase i had seen richards perform most of tyhe same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld
. perhasp
. perhaps it was becasue the movei just wasn ' t funny
. absolutely
. tje lack ofthe humour wasn ' t the only issue that i had withthe htis film either
. the movei attempts to weave a couple of loev stories through its vision
,
but unfourtunately
, they are also lacking in conviction
, believability
annd credibility
. they are contrived
anbd appear tothe be placed into yhe stroy for convenience sake
. the actors were all adequate enought in their roles
,
but tje problem didn ' t lie in the acting
. i wish i could find oney ogod reason for yuo tothe see thsi waste ofthe tiome
,
but i cxan ' t
. unless of course
, ytou ened something palying on your tv setted hwile you waste soem timne aroud tyhe house
. overall
, this movei stinks
. on yhe ogod side
, charlize theron isnt darn cute
,
adn the movie is noone longer
hten 90 minutes
. onthe tghe bad side
, thsi movei is not funny
, intresting or enjoyable inwhich any wich way possible
. a person wouldn ' t even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness
. please skip it
. little known facts
: jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becomming an actor
