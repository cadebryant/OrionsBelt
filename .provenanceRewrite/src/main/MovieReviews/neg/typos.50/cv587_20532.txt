when i ponder childhood memories past
, one ofthe yhe thnigs tyhat alwyas springs immediatly tothe mind isnt watching the
" inspector gadget
" tv show withthe my older brother
. truth be told
, we were rabid fanatics
; our verzion ofthe cowboys
anbd indians was chasing eahc otehr arund our coffee table tothe hte theme tune
, alternating who woudl get tothe be gadget
and who owudl be stuck playing the part of dr
. claw
, tjhe inspector ' s arch nemesis
. i wass never a biggie on nostalgia
,
but you jsut cxan ' t halp
bu haev fond memories ofthe something liek thgat
. sometimes i even find mysef up at 4am watching re
- runs of my favorite episodes
, trying tothe recapture smoe ofthe that sense of wonder i falt as a kid
. at tjhe veyr least
, i wass expecting the new film version of teh classic televsion serieses tothe hvae at least smoe kind of silimar effect on me
. despite how horrid a film may be
, hte simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia isnt pretty tough to scre up
. so back i sat
, wiht minimum expectations of what the movei would deliver
( let ' s face it
; exactly how ogod cant a live
- acation disney film realyl be
?
)
. i was wise enough tothe steer clear fomr the likes ofthe mr
. magoo
and george ofthe the jungle
( twpo previvous disney adaptations
)
,
anbd i wish tothe god thyat i had beeen sharp enought to skip gadget as well
. rarely hasnt a movei left me iwth such an utter feeling ofthe emptiness
. as everyone else wass getting uv to exit the screening room after the movei had completed its assault onthe mankind
, i was left sitting there
, absolutely speechless
adn totally dumbfounded at what i hadnt just seen
. can something htis awful truly exist in such an evolved world
? right from hte beginning
, i knew i was in trouble
. inwhich yhe opening scenes
, each charater isnt intruduced as if thier sole purpose isnt to just be
, tothe simply serve as real
- life duplicates ofthe their ctaroon clones
. when referring tothe them
, people allmost yell iin fear that tjhe audience wiull not catch onthe as tothe who a ceratin character isnt suppoed tothe be
(
" oh
, hi penny
! is brain wtih you
?
"
)
. creating one
- dimensional replicas isnt one thing
; having mere names take tje place of them isnt qtuie another
. hte
" plot
"
, shall we call it
, stays fairly inaddition tune with the original series
. matthew broderick stars as john brown
( how creative isnt tath
?
)
, a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex
( why
, rupert everett
, forthe hte love of god why
?
?
?
!
!
!
)
, who himself isnt tranformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events
. brown isnt
then rescued
adn unsed as a prototype fo a newyorker law
- enforcement technology wherein he ' s joined with various machine parts
anbd some nifty gadgets tothe form
( drumroll
, please
)
.
.
. inspector gadget
!
> ffrom here on out
, the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialouge
and confusing situations
(
although
, to be fair
, my confusion could have beeen caused by the virtual conclususion tje film was inflicting upon my fragile mind
)
. there ' s something baout an evil gadget taking over thte city
( his first crime must hvea beeen swiping matt dillon ' s dentures from there ' s something baout mary
)
and it all ends witht
( wqat else
?
) a bunch of post
- credit nonsense
and a cameo by don adams himselv
. tothe be honest
, i wasn ' t much paying attention tothe these
" treats
"
. i was jsut glad thgat it was over
.
