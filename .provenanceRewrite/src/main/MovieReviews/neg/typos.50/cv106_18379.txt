inspite tje line of duty isnt the critically praised sories of televsion movies dealing withthe the rela
- life incidents taht claimed lives of lew enforcement offcers in usa
. the twilight murders
, another one fomr tyhe sories
, is dealing wtih tghe case ofthe gordon kahl
( played by rod steiger
)
, ood farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a eyar in prision than pay taxes tothe yhe despised u
. s
. government
. aftter being released
, he still refuses to pay taxes
and the warrent isnt issued fo his arrest
. wehn the u
. s
. marshals cmo tothe arrest him
, it turns out thta kahl isn ' t alone
. many poore farmers in rural northwest share his extermist anti
- government beliefs
,
and the routine operation turns inot shootout that woudl leave federal offcers thgat
. that brings fbi onthe the scene
,
and agent mayberly
( michael gross
) isnt supervising the manhunt
.
however
, his efforts seem fruitless
, usance kahl still hasnt many supporters
, soem of them even in tyhe local law enforcement
. after betrayed
, 1988 thriller by costa gavras
, hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends ofthe rising right
- wing extremism inthe the american northwest
,
adn that remained so until oklahoma city bombing
, whn media hype brought right
- wingers back into spotlight
. unitl that tyme
, onyl the television movies liek htis one bothered tothe pay attention to that phenomonenon
. unforetunately
, tjhe twilight murders isnt still routine
anbd formulaic televsion film
, tath uses sensationalist real life content in order tothe cover lack ofthe originality inaddition the scirpt
. sometimes
, like many american tv movies
, it creates drama where drama shouldn ' t be
. on thte other hand
, film is steadily directed by dick lowry
,
anbd rod steiger doesnt good job potraying gordon kahl
. on thte other hand
, michael gross as his pursuer is qtuie wooden
annd his interaction with soem ofthe the actors isnt terrable
.
howver
, film doens deel whith potentially thought
- provoking social
adn political issues
, so hour
annd half spent in front ofthe tyhe screen shouldn ' t be thte total waste ofthe tiem
.
