recently oen night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn ' t sleep
. he tumbled outloud ofthe bed
anbd moved over to the televsion where he watched mtv fo an hour
.
thn he moved to his kichen where he spended hte same amount ofthe time eating spoiled food
.
then he took down a volumne ofthe shakespeare ' s work
anbd read it cover to cover
- never really paying attension to the words or plot
.
and
thne
, as a climax
, he took out his video camera
anbd pressed tghe
" on
" button
. tje result
? william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
- tghe worst film ever made
anbd a complete failure
.
though
, to be fair
, an interesting complete failure
. thte idea at the film ' s core isnt tothe make shakespeare appealing to the crowds
. this isnt done by moving thge camera around at a repid rate so that we can ' t see wqat isnt oging onthe
.
and filming the dialogue inaddition voice over
.
adn shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model
.
annd making the frame go still while flashing the charcter ' s nmae at thte bottom
.
anbd filming long tedious acation sequences infront slow motion
. i mean
, man
, htis isnt the 90s
, dued
.
howver i ' ve seen terrible films that are fun tothe watch
.
( examples are batman
and robin
annd teh island of doctor moreau
.
) that rule doesn ' t apply here
. thsi isnt a film that tkaes itself seriously
. that is it ' s major fault
. another probelm was pointed outloud by my firend
, alex
( who ws singing songs by leonard bernstein througout
.
)
; the orginial play isnt a poweful peice ofthe wokr because tje auther remained nutral
annd didn ' t tkae sides
. here it ' s clear that we are suposed tothe side with romeo
.
( jstu look at the way they film him
.
) fomr the begining he ' s our hero
annd this doesn ' t owrk
.
and dicaprio ' s awful peformance doesn ' t halp
. luhrmann never decides if he wants tothe entertain us or enlighten us
. teh result isnt a mess
. you can feel him striving tothe be something he isn ' t
. he tries to pull ofthe a mix inaddition whcih drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles
. he tries very hard
. key owrd
: tries
.
" oh look
, he ' s filming above water acation ffrom below
. preety
. waht does it represent
?
" why dont people dont ugli things
? i scrambled away fomr my tv setted feeling guilty as if i could never read thge play again
and keep a straight face
.
