starship troopers is a bad movei
. i mean
, a realyl
, relaly
, bad movie
. nto onyl doens it cross the line ofthe bad tast when it comes to blood
, gore
annd body parts shown onthe the screen
, it blissfully jumps over thta line
, aparently unaware that thge movei trailers appeal to an audience ofthe five tothe fifteen yera olds
( ofthe wich i saw many in tjhe theatre
)
. looking past the appalling sight of overdone voilence
, we are left whith a movie with a thin plot at best
, no strong lead characters
, a blatent disregard fo physics
,
and a very obvious naziesque theme
. that being said
, onto the review
: tjhe movei starts with a propaganda message fomr the federation
( who ' s logo bears a
* storng
* resembelance tothe a nazi german eagle
)
, urging tjhe populace to go off
and fight the bugs
, who are attemting tothe distroy earth
. the film shows larg rallies with young children infront attendence
, pledging lalegiance to hte federation
( agina
, sound familiar
?
)
. as tjhe movei progresses
, we are shown terror tactic traning
, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm
,
and throws a knife through anohter ' s hand
. eventualy
, the recruits embark onthe a journy to a loction two thirds ofthe tghe way accross the milky way galaxy
, to fight hte bugs on theri hmeo planet
. as our faster than light travelling
" herose
" arrive onthe planet
, they drop onto tghe planet
,
and burst our of their craft brandishing
.
.
.
" whta
?
" ytou say
,
" laser beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, htey hop outloud brandishing ogod ood 1997 machine guns
, pump action rifles
,
and tactical nuclear weapons
! i guess a lot ofthe physics mony r
& d went into travel
and nto weaponry
. as yhe assault beigns
, our gropu of troopers are seen walking in a straight line thru a box canyon
. twpo munbers of the group notice rocks slipping
anbd falling above them
,
and one even sees a streak fly by
,
but disregards it as nothing
. this ofthe course
, leads to more massive carnage
, blood shed
,
and graphic depictions ofthe limbs
and heads being ripped
and severed ffrom theri bodies
. again
, i see that military tatics in tyhe future must have evolved at baout yhe smae pace as thier weapons
! inspite thge end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto tghe scene in wqat coudl accurately be descibed as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
,
and gloves
. he doesnt a vulcan mind meld on tje giant slug
,
anbd
then proclaims that thte bugs are scared
! this sets the troopers into a frenzy
, as they are nowe one step closer tothe completing thier gool
, total genocide ofthe a species
( agian
, soudn familar
?
?
)
. i haev tried very hard nto to step onthe
and spoil teh plot whith this review
,
but given it ' s non
- eixstence
, i may ahev anyway
. i sould go onthe for pages ripping this movie aart
,
but don ' t wnat to bore you too badly
. iin short
, i felt as if i weere subjected tothe a mix vetween a protem
- nazi war film wih bugs substituded for allies
, a drivers education accident scene film
,
and a complet blank screen
( tje plot
, of course
)
. i wouldn ' t recommend tihs movei to anyone
, anywhere
, under any circumstance
. copywrite
