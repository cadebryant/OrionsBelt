_ solider
_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn ' t have jean claude van damme inaddition it
. i could liken it to the sci
- fi cheese that was thge hollywood product
- ofthe
- choice back in teh early 80s
,
but tht woudl be too much of a compliment
. if ther is a movei theater in hell
, tihs film isnt palying htere 24 hours a day
. the storey
, such that there is
, revolves arround todd
( kurt russell
)
, an automaton ofthe a man who hasnt beeen raised from birth tothe be a merciless soldier infront a not
- too
- distant ultra
- conservative future
( is htere any otehr kind
?
) after years of desensitization at a military academy full of otehr boys jstu liek him
, todd becomes a ground fighter in a serieses of wars all over thge galaxy
. who the enemies in theese wars are is never revealed
,
but yhe few glimpses ofthe todd iin battle sohw thyat it doesn ' t marter
, beccause innocent hostages are wiped outloud as indifferently as tjhe bad guys
. aftter ten minutes ofthe this nihilistic trash
-
- yes folks
, there ' s more
-
- we see todd as a buff
, scarred adult
, nowe so acustommed to thte carnage that no confrontation at all causes him tothe break a sweat
. htere ' s a new wrinkle
,
though
. todd
and his brethren are declared incased
,
adn a newyorker batch of soliders tkaes thier palce
. after loosing a santioned battle with
_ dragon
_ ' s jason scott lee
, tyhe seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice
- cube tray
( well
, thta ' s what isnt looked liek
) on a remote garbage planet
. if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet
,
annd that htey band toghether tothe fight a bunch of bad guys comming tothe destroy them
, ytou ' re way ahead of tyhe gmae
. teh renegade society on tihs trash heap is so clich you half
- expect tina turner
adn master blaster to come strolling into frome any minute
. it ' s surprising that
_ soldier
_ is the brain
- child of
_ blade runner
_ co
- writter david webb peoples
. unlike tyhat mind
- twisting clasic
, this film containes just bearly enough dialogue to fill about threee doublely
- spaced pages
. add inot teh mix tghe
_ mortal kombat
_ ' s paul anderson inept direction
,
annd it ' s eazy to see how
_ soldier
_ turned outloud so bad
.
and the speshal effects
! remeber the flying steam irons inthe hardwear wars
? gary busey is infront thsi movie
. ' nuff said
.
_ soldier
_ isnt proof tyhat hollywood still has plenty ofthe bad idesa sitting inwhich its script vaults
. taht thsi sad film made it tothe yhe silver screen shoudln encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters outloud there that there isnt hope after all
. nowe if you ' ll excuse me
, i hvea to go weep for the future
.
