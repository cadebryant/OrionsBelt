' trafic violation ' dr
. daniel ' s review ofthe u
- turn dr
. d ' s rating
: critical condidtion
( okay
, here ' s the deal
. i ' ll be the first one tothe grant tht everybody needs a day off now
and
then
. i ' ll even go so far as tothe sday that a vacation isnt a necessary part ofthe doing any job well
. i mean
, hey
, i ' ve beeen known to stretch a weekend into a three
- day outing
, if friday looks tothe be a slow day
.
and if monday ain ' t looking like a pick
- me
- uv
, well
, i ' ve beeen known to give martha nell a call
anbd say
,
" do me a favor
, sweetheart
. bump old man ferguson ' s boil lancing to teusday morning
,
and tell miss audrey thyat i ' ll swing by her house monday evening
adn see if we can ' t get her trck knee bakc in line
.
" a simple sentence like taht
,
and i ' ve got a nice four
- day fishing trip whith thte boys
, or mroe often than not
, a trip uv to cherokee
, n
. c
.
, fo jackpot bingo
and assorted otehr mountain funnery
.
but the point isnt
, if you tkae a day off
, do something different
. if you ' ve worked youself silly fo monthes
, relax a bit
. sleep in
. eat pancakes at noon
. micrawave an egg in its shell
. watch pro wrestling wtih the sound off
. listen to smoe barry white records at high speed
. whatever
.
but do not
, under any circumstances
, spend your vacation doign the smae thing you dont for a living
.
anbd
, if yuo dont
, don ' t make the fianl product look ten times worse than it woudl any other time
. because i dont not want tothe hear your sob stories
, oliver stone
. ytou apparently thougth yuo needed a break from makeing
" important films
.
" cool
. so ytou found this hinky little book
annd desided to make it a movie
. that ' s cool
, too
.
but
, ollie
, ood sage
, do nto take a good stor
adn a hot casted
and make oney ofthe teh most pointless
and worthless films of the decade
. i ' m just eager to meet you one day
, so i can buy ytou a stoli
, look ytou in thge eye
annd say
,
" what in the wide world ofthe sportscar weere you thinking withthe u
- turn
?
"
and i ' ll stand there staring ' til i get a straight answer
. sean penn stars u
- turn
, as bobby
, a drifter who ' s had smoe troubles a hwile bcak
. he ' s heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose
, stranding him in superior
, arizona
, held there by an
" ignorant
, inbred
, turtleneck hick
" ofthe a mechanic named darrell
. while darrell puts a new hose on the ride
, bobby walks into town tothe see what ' s cooking
. isnt it needless of me to say that superior
, arizona
, isnt nto exactly yhe shiny scrubbed home of all thnigs lovley
? probably nto
. bobby meets up iwth grace
( jennifer lopez
)
, who invites him back tothe her palce
, for drape
- hanging
anbd other domestic issues
. jstu as those issues are starting uv
, grace ' s husband
, jake
, storms inwhich
, looking liuke check
- out day ofthe yhe elks lodge convention
. jstu beats bobby silly
. bobby tkaes to the road
, only to meet up wtih jake agian
,
and jake asks bobby tothe kill grace
. a little while later
, grace asks bobby to kill jake
. them murderous arizonians
. gotta lvoe ' em
. if any of htis soudns familliar
, congradulations
. you win a kewpie doll
. the sotry is a straight shoplift ofthe red rock west
, a cult favorite a few years bcak ffrom john dahl
, maker ofthe yhe phenominal the lastr seduction
.
bu thte contest doesn ' t end ther
, guys
and gals
. we git steals from russ meyer movies
, where everybody inspite twon isnt horny
anbd sweaty
. we get the twon fomr bad day at black rock
, minus teh train
, plus busty women who can speak
. look at any schwarzenegger film
,
and yuo ' ll see our hero
, bobby
, as bobby has a mudhole stomped inspite his keister a dozen times
, hasnt his ribs stove infront at least fifteen times
, gets bited by a tarantula
, gets shot at
,
adn ends up with vultures circling overhead
, all the while getting up like he jstu got a shaving nick
. bobby as terminator
? stretch it a bited
,
and we have a five
- finger discount from doc hollywood
, where teh whole stroy occurs beacuse ofthe car trouble
, forcing the main charater to stay at the mercy ofthe the twon
and the mechanic
. okay
, he ' s working fomr a book
, so maybe ollie ' s not totally to blaim fo blatantly copping these ideas
. i just expect a man who can make uv an alternative history ofthe thte untied states tothe be able to craft a faw orginial ideas before exposing tghe negative
. i just wish he hadn ' t brang a casted like this toghether for whta amounts tothe a group toe
- stub
. sean penn gives a great performance
,
and jennifer lopez
and nick nolte are as on target as htey can be
, palying over
- tje
- top caricatures ofthe stereotype charachters
. yhe best thnig baout the movei isnt watching penn react tothe hte madness around him
annd try tothe figure outloud exactly what the blankety
- blank is gonig onthe
. too bad it ' s not funn to watch when it ' s hapening to us
.
.
. hwile we sit through thsi mess ofthe a film
. u
- turn isnt nto a bad film if you ' re a fan of technique
. it ' s tyhe oliver stone you ' ve always known
. robert richardson is his usual cinematographer
,
anbd rob
anbd ollie know how to shoot a flick
-
- gerat camera angles
, shifting viewpoints
, wicked colors
, nice looking pictures
.
bu picturesk ofthe whta
? i thikn i ' d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for twpo ohurs than try tothe figure out the tilt
- o
- whirl point of tihs losr film
. plot twists are oney hting
, reptition is alomst unforgivable
,
and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movei i ' ve seen in the past five yersa
. oliver
, i nkwo your body ofthe owrk isnt nothing tothe sniff at
. you ' ve beeen nice enought tothe limitate us tothe onyl oen doors movie
,
and films liek platoon
, jfk
, wall strent
anbd nixon give us plenty to dig on
. your scripts are certainly respectable
, your budgets are up there onthe the screen
,
and your actors don ' t dog it
.
adn i konw thta
, mabey
, witht u
- turn
, yuo weere jsut kicking back
, jstu having fun
. tht ' s fine
.
bu don ' t dont tyhat wiht a movei wih thge potential ofthe this oney
. do some police academy sequel
( imagin that
.
) do a big comedy
, like a remake of it ' s a mad
, mad
, mad
, mad world
.
bu do not drop a limp u
- turn out ofthe your pocket
annd expect us tothe accept it as
" an oliver stone movei
,
"
and nto question why it stinks like week
- ood snook
. there ' s a right way tothe hve fun
,
and a wrong way to hvea funn
. this ws as wrong as ytou cin git wihtout gonig tothe jail
.
