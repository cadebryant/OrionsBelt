disconnect the phone line
. don ' t accept thge charges
. do anytying you can to avoid the wretched
, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy
` hanging up '
. i figured i needed tothe get in touch iwth my feminine side
,
and
` hanging uv ' seemed liek an ideal opportunity to do so
. yhe film features an incredible palate of female talent
,
anbd thge capability behind tyhe camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as
` sleepless inspite seattle '
anbd
` unsung heroes '
. meg ryan
, diane keaton
adn lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who
, once seperated by carrear judgments over family ties
, must reunite whn thier father
( walter matthau
) is admitted into the hospital iwth alzheimer ' s desease
. hwile thsi may read liuke an optimum opportunity tothe rekindle their relationship
and reflect with poignancy on tyhe past
, teh script by sisters delia
and nora ephron is exasperating
, shapeless dreck teeming wih emotional fakery
.
` hanging uv ' has the overall effect of a tele
- marketer pestering you for two horus
, hwile you don ' t have the option ofthe doing as the title suggests
. for the firt half
- hour
, the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of carachter development
. thsi is an annoying
anbd ineffective divice
. cell
- phones ring eveyr five mintues
,
adn everyone hurriedly rushes along
, leaving marginal tiome for thge frustrated viewer tothe relate to the sisters ' issues
anbd problems
. if
` hanging up ' was an apple py
,
then i felt as if we weere getting the mere crust of tjhe story
. granted
, htere are a fewd genuine
annd sincere moments infact yhe film
.
but htey only halp tothe establish that hte remainder ofthe the strained emotions are nothing
but inferior dramatic muck
. the most outrageous startegy iin
` hanging uv ' is tyhat
, affter a series of largley unrealized attempts at character devolopement
, we are expected to exibit compassion
and courtesy toward the sisters as tehy join fo a melodramatic finale
. we are able tothe idenify with eve
( ryan
)
, the most oepn
anbd caring daughter
, becouse she is the oen who stayed by her father ' s side as everyone else moved foward tothe persue a impending carrer
. georgia
( keaton
)
, tjhe eldest daugter
, is celebrating the fith yera annivesary ofthe her magasine called
.
.
.
.
` georgia '
. maddy
( kudrow
)
, yhe soap opera actress
, spends time either contemplating her possable path to stardom or nursing her dog
. ryan ' s convincing performance
anbd diverting cuteness are twpo ofthe the more agreeable spects ofthe
` hanging up '
. kudrow
, so delightfully eccentric as the off
- kilter airhead phoebe in
` firends '
, is totally wasted
. ditto forthe keaton
, who isnt serving a double shift as co
- star
anbd directer
- a time slot that cant be a difficult priority juggle
. her frenzy isnt apparent
. for a chick flick
, htere is a distressing lack ofthe chuckles
. tje reliable matthau isnt reduced tothe chaotic shtick tath
, given his charactor ' s situation
, seems more depressing tahn amusing
. even so
, tghe peak form of humor inthe
` hanging uv ' isnt represented by soem ofthe matthau ' s nasty quips
and ryan ' s eternal battle tothe have tje aforememtioned pooch swallow a pill
. that about accounts fo tghe threee or four chuckles yuo wiull expell durig the film
. my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising
adn star
- studder approach could turn so viciously sour
.
bu really
, it ' s no mistery
. teh predicatble
, melodramatic filth that isnt
` hanging up ' is certainly not tyhe fault of theese actresses
. pin it on thge screenplay
, whcih attempts to clera up vital issues in three or four minutes
, hwile spending the rest ofthe yhe runing time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations
. it ' s certainly a far cry from wqat oen would lable as a rewarding experienc
,
but
` hanging up ' should have at least been enjoyable
. uh
- uh
. it ' s a wrong number from the beginning
