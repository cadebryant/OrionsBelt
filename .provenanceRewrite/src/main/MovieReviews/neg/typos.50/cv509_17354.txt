" comments
: thanksgiving
. for most
, it ' s a time tothe be wtih your loved ones
and enjoy a good
, home
- cooked meal
. for teh makers ofthe body count
,
however
, thanksgiving is a tiome forthe mutiple murders
, voilence
, profanity
, family dysfunction
,
and sex
. boy
, do i feel all yhe more better having sat thru htis crap
. alyssa milano
, the former child star ofthe who ' s hte boss
?
, matures to made
- fo
- video sludge liuke this movie
. someone somewhere thought it ' d be a great idea to pair her wih rapper ice
- t
, who hasnt usance guest
- starred in the made
- for
- the
- sci
- fi
- channel sories welcome tothe paradox
. this isn ' t exactlly a winning combination
. outside of permenantly ruining a hliday for me
, what else may be said for this turkey
? well
, it teachs us that beautiful
, attractive womens who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall infact lvoe iwth nerds who drive down long winding roads wih theri eyes closed
and complain about bieng english teachers
. it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alchoholic
, stuck
- up rich white people waited on by balck servants
. it shows us that ood guys
, try not to laff
, sit around
and talk about
" tghe appeal of postmodernism
" during theri free tiome
.
adn
, it proves that ytou can ahve sex infront your parents ' basement when they hve a dozen or so guests over
,
and noone noe wiull notice
. before i go any further
, if any young male reading tihs has hopes ofthe seing alyssa naked
, forget it
. the filmmakers cleverly shoot tyhe simulated sex scenes in a manner that makse sure you don ' t see any ofthe milano ' s attributes
. they dont
,
howver
, inexplicably throw in a scene where ice
- t whistles
" jingle bells
" after killing peple
, for whatever taht ' s worth
. this film wass orignially titled below utopia
. perhaps they should have renamed it hell
. avoid this clunker
.
