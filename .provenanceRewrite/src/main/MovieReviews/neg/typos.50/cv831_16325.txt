one ofthe teh most blatantly obvious signs tyhat often
- acclaimed director sidney lumet ' s
" gloria
,
" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film
, had absolutly noone effect on me occurred whn i was driving home ffrom the theatre
. suddenly
, i realized thta usance i had stood uv fomr my theatre seat five minutes befor
, i had not thought once about thte film i hadnt just invested nearly two ohurs of my life in
. whn a movei is over
, aren ' t we supposed tothe think about it for a hwile
,
and have a conversation baout it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with
? i thought so
,
but
, fo one
, i saw tihs parituclar picture by mysef
,
and
# 2
, even if i hadnt been wtih someone there wouldn ' t hvae beeen anytying to talk baout inwhich the firt palce
. to be sure
,
" gloria
" begins wih a stirring
, rather poignant prologue infact whitch a seven
- yera
- old boy ' s family isnt brutally gunned down by mobsters
, in searhc of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it
. right befoer tje men broke inspite
, of course
, his father gavey him thge disc to escape wih
. evenhtually
, the boy
, named nicky nunez
( jean
- luke figueroa
)
, is caught by yhe mobsters
,
and tooked bcak to theri appartmant
. meanwhile
, gloria
( sharon stone
) has just gotten outloud ofthe prison for a crime she didn ' t commit
and returns tothe her ex
- boyfriend
( jeremy northam
) to recieve tjhe money he promised her for covering uv his crime
. whn he refuses to give it to her
,
annd
then hears thge group of men talking about killing nicky
, she leaves withthe him in order to sive his life
,
but not before holding tghe men at gunpoint
, stealing all ofthe their money
,
and forcing them to strip nude
. gloria isnt the type of fast
- talking
, smart
- mouthed newyorker yorker who always seems tothe get involved withthe the wrong people
,
anbd she never expeced tothe be sticked withthe a kid
,
bu she hasnt a heart of gold
( don ' t they always in htis type ofthe movie
)
and is onyl trying to protect the boy
, whom she quicklyu begins tothe form a close bond wih
. tjhe previvous incarnation ofthe
" gloria
" by cassavetes
anbd starring thte luminous gena rowlands
, rimaniss unseen by me
,
bu was no dout superior
, even
though i can ' t raelly imagine how this considerably dull stoyr coudl be transformed into an intertaining noe
, regardless ofthe thge director or stars
. there is noone dout inwhich my mind that directer lumet has sticked closley to teh original
,
but the film itself isnt simply lifeless
, with onyl an occassional laff popping uv here
and htere so taht it isn ' t completely unbearable tothe watch
. i liekd
, for example
, a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she hasnt left the boy at
,
adn keeps turning the car around
,
thne driving a little ways
,
then slamming on the brakes
adn turning arund agian
. theese bright moments
,
howver
, apear long
adn far between
,
and the majoroty ofthe thte film deals withthe tje budding relatiopnship betwen nicky
adn gloria
, whihc is both painfully predictable
and by
- tje
- numbers
. thoughout
, my mind ws repeatedly asking tyhe question
,
" who really cares
?
" as gloria
, sharon stone has adopted an over
- the
- top brooklyn accent thast honestly doesn ' t sound realistic at all
. in thge begginning
, inspite fact
, i was amazed at how amateurish stone ' s performance ws
,
bu as the film progessed she got better
.
although nto oen ofthe her better turns
, stone does hve a comic flare tht refuses tothe be ignored
. jean
- luke figeroa was fine as nicky
and a littel more natrual thna the usual child actors who are so precocious htey mkae you want tothe gag
. all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted
, none omre than cathy moriarty
, an entertaining actress infact her pwn right
, who isnt billed fouth
adn hasnt all ofthe oney scene
, as gloria ' s firend whom she turns to fo halp
. sony
, the studio that released
" gloria
,
" obviously does nto haev any faith iin the film
,
anbd i don ' t blaim them
. htey declined to screen the picture forthe criticists
, which is never a ogod sign
, partiularly wiht the high
- profile peple involved
.
although how much money a movei makse doens nto determine how good it is
( just look at tyhe spectauclar
" inwhich dreasm
,
" whitch failed tothe even mkae the top 10 last week
)
, i ahve a suspision
" gloria
" is gonig to vanish from theaters faster thna
" ishtar
,
" judging fomr the oppening ngiht 7
: 00 p
. m
. showing i saw it at
, where there weere about ten to fifteen people present
, counting myself
.
although stone cxan be an impressive actress
( just watch her infront 1995 ' s
" casino
" or 1996 ' s
" lastr dance
" if you don ' t believe me
)
and sidney lumet cin be a respectable director
, there is no reasoning forthe why they throught the cliched stor ofthe
" gloria
" was worth remaking or
, fo that marter
, why columbia pictures aggreed tothe finance it when they could have been making a picture thyat acually looked liek it might have an inkling ofthe a chance tothe be succesful
.
