hey
, i ' ve got a gerat idae for a movie
! ok
, here it isnt
: we ' ll get tim allen tothe pul angry faces for baout two housr or so
! what ' s that
? sounds too boring
? ok
, how baout thsi
thn
: we still have tim allen pull faces fo baout two huors
,
bu half ofthe them are angry looks
anbd half ofthe them are
" i ' m in pain
!
" looks
! what ' s tath
? tyhat still doesn ' t soudn funny to you
? how about if we thru iin smoe
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still nto funny
? if ytou anwsered
" no
, that doesn ' t sound funny
"
,
thne
( ding ding ding
!
) you ' re absolutly corect
! for richer or poorer is a moronic farce baout a rich marryed cuple
( plyed by tim allen
adn kirstie alley
) who seek refuge in an amish comunity after theri bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best knwo as newman on tv ' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them in trouble forthe tax evasion
. waht ensues is a badly scripted
annd horribly directed 114 mintues ofthe cinema hell
. waht mkaes this all wrong is that nobody seems tothe hvae wqat the film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing uv
, thte married cuple is brad
and caroline sexton
( allen
anbd alley
)
, a populer snobby duo who seem totally inthe love to everyone alse
,
but inthe reality are on the brink ofthe divorce
. just as their marriage seems to be hanging fomr it ' s fianl thread
, brad discovers thta his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, has been engaging infront illegitimate deals in thge sexton ' s names
. thge irs catches onthe
,
but usance everything points bakc to tjhe sexton ' s
and not lachman
, htere is nothing much to do
.
.
. exept run away
annd join an amish comunity
. first tiem screenwriters jana howington
anbd steve lukanic give us a cuple ofthe chuckle
- out
- loud moments
,
and even some decent laughs here
annd
* way
* over ther
,
bu there is so much tothe cringe at inaddition htis horribly made film thyat ytou ' ll likely miss thge laughs while regurgitating popcorn
. alley is absolutely unwatchable
,
and the chemistry beween her
and allen isnt about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade
( which
, i inform you
, was total b
. s
.
)
. allen
anbd alley are in no way convincing as tycoons
, nor are they very convincing as an amish couple
! htis entire movei isnt one bad ill
- conceived notion that should have beeen curtailed from the very beginning
! the amish inaddition this movei are alsot flimsy
and unconvincing
. it ' s such a trite
, stereotypical scirpt thgat i imagine tghe actors that were cast
( noticing that htey ' re all predominantly tv figures
) were probaly hte only ones tehy could git
! bryan spicer ' s directing doesn ' t help oney bited
, either
. inaddition fatc
, listing spicer ' s filmography
( which includes tje frist
" power rangers
" movie
and yhe big screen adaption ofthe mchale ' s navy
) isnt more of an insult thna a r
? sum
?
! now that i ' ve preety much run for richer or poorer inot yhe ground
, i iwll let you in on tghe best thing about it
. it bumped seven films up a notch onthe my
" worst ofthe
" 1997 movei list
. thyat ' s right
, thanks tothe tihs film ranking at number 3 fo the yearm ' s worst
, six films are nowe not seamingly as bad
,
adn a smile liuke yours
, previously inhabiting tje number ten spot
, nowe doesn ' t have to suffer the ridicule ofthe mkaing my bottom ten list
. if ytou look at it inwhich that respect
, forthe richer or poorer wiull end uv mkaing someone happy after all
!
