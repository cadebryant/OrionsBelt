it ' s a shame the execution of thsi concept falls very short ofthe its premise
. the movei isnt lacking
adn most unsatisfying
. osmosis jones is crude
, gross
, disgusting
,
and ws directed by the farrelly brothers
- the twisted siblings behind there ' s something baout mary
, me
, myself
anbd irene
and a cuple ofthe otehr movies iin whitch thge humer is mostly targeted below the bilt
. not that there ' s anything wrong witht scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor
- such as it ws
. it ' s merely thast withthe osmosis jones
, the farrellys humer isnt too juvenile
, too predictable
. you can alomst foresee tjhe puns jstu by viewing the part ofthe the inner anatomy a sequence isnt drawn
. osmosis jones looks liek oen of those ood health class movies gone pyscho
. tje trouble isnt
, the animation may please hte vyre young
,
but tyhe jokes may be over theri heads
, while tje teen
- age audeince may fidn it too tame forthe theri tastes
. adults
? well
, let ' s just say most wiull fidn it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays liek a 100
- minute infomercial forthe thge eat healthy foods lobby
. the live action sequences revolve around frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe
. he constinually looks as if he needs a shave
and a showfer
. frank
, much to the constarnation ofthe his duaghter
, is a fast
- food addict
, eating anytying
-
adn everything
- tht can kill ytou
. he works at a zoo where hte animals look cleaner
-
annd presumabely smell better
- thna he does
. frank ' s body isnt invaded by thrax
, a lethal virus
, affter frank eats a hard
- boiled egg thta hadnt falled to the ground
. it ' s not gross enought that frank picks the egg uv fomr the dirt
annd plops it inot his mouth
. nope
, the farrellys pile it onthe by firt having frank wrestle a chimp forthe hte egg
, wresting it from tje primate ' s mouth
. like i said
, the gross meter tips thge scales on tihs oney
. aftter ingesting the egg
, tghe movie beggins its animated sequences
. here
, osmosis jones
( voiced by chris rock
)
, a renegade white blood cell is teamed wih drix
( voiced by frasier ' s david hyde pierce
)
, a 12
- hour
, painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax
( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne
)
. basicaly
, waht we have is a cliched cop
- buddy movei
, rife witht all teh clich
? s ofthe that genre
.
and this isnt why osmosis jones doesn ' t click
. it merely falls back on tired
, familiar conventions instade of creating newyorker
annd exciting situations
. the jokes
and puns are lame
: osmosis seaches outloud a snitch
, a former flu virus
. affter pumping him for information
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn ' t look fluish
.
"
and teh jokes don ' t rise above that levle
. thte live action scenes are no better
. frank is such a slob
, so unappealing that it isnt difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child
. he ' s almost a bigger cartoon than hte animated characters
. osmosis jones is a movie tht may be too voilent for young children as thrax burns
adn dissolves blood cells right
and left
. yhe animation is rather twpo
- dimentional
and flat
. it lacks scope
anbd depth
. it isnt an unappealing movei that wiull leave you scratching your head
,
adn maybe leaneant towrad a showfer aftter yuo walk out ofthe teh theater
.
