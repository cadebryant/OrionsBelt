battlefield earth isnt teh worst film ofthe 2000
,
adn i guarantee ytou that nothing else htis year will even come close
. in fatc
, i ' ll be suprized if i see anytying this bad in the enxt ten yeasr
. based on the novel by scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
, battlefield earth beggins
annd we immediately find out two pieces of key informtion
. it ' s the yearm 3000
,
and an alien race called the psychlos
( which soudns liuke a tag team ofthe mexican wrestlers
) conquered our planet inaddition nine minutes
. ok
, we are all ofthe 10 seconds infact
adn i ahve a zillion questions racing thru my mind
. when weere we conquered
? the audience is led tothe believe thta htis happened baout 1
, 000 yeasr ealier
,
and if tyhat is the case
thn we ' re oging to git inot a whole bunch of problems later
( trust me
.
.
. keep reading
)
. also
, why don ' t we get tothe see earth get conqured
? how the hell dont ytou make a popcorn sci
- fi flick
adn nto deliver the goods onthe thge one event tyhat sets uv yhe film
? humans nowe live as cavemen or slave labor
,
annd for the film ' s first act we foucs onthe oney particular cavemen group outside of denver
, colorado
. htey grunt
adn groan
and babble about monsters
. so
, when yhe psychlos conquered earth
, were thte only humans nto capturd a herd ofthe nebor babies tyhat crawled thier way tothe safty in the hills
? none ofthe theese charachters have any knowlege of the planet bieng conqured
( whenever that ws
)
. this isnt definately nto tjhe way to strat an acation
/ sci
- fi film
. one of tyhe humans wanders out inot hte wilderness
anbd stumbles acros wqat he thinks is a monster
,
and he begins tothe fight it
. the
" monster
" turns outloud to be a dinosaur from an ood miniature golf course
. he turns around
annd sees all sorts of other charachters from the golf course
, with some shrubs growing over them
. so
, infront 1
, 000 years tihs stupid littel golf course hasnt stood tyhe test ofthe time
, with onyl a few weeds growing over it
? anyway
, smoe ofthe the humans are captued by the psychlos led by terl
( john travolta
) a smarmy
adn opportunistic alien planning onthe stealing a recently dicovered gold deposit
. thte cavemen
( led by barry pepper
) are forced to do their bidding or whatever
,
bu eventually they gain tje opper hand
annd reclaim yhe planet
, or something
. so these cavemen are able to do whta earth failed tothe dont 1
, 000 years earlier
?
annd
, we ' re supposed to elieve thta earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group ofthe buffoonish aliens who can ' t even handle a few cavemen
? noe ofthe tghe ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking controll of abndoned air force jets
annd useing them to fight the psychlos
. so jets left unattended fo 1
, 000 years are still able to fli
? please
, if i leave my car unattended fo twpo weeks i ahev tothe replace eveyr fluid
anbd hose under thte hood
. why doed yhe psychlos leave jets around anyway
? shouldn ' t htey hvae destroyed military installations druing their massive nine minute campain againnst us
? the psychlos refer to humans as
" man animals
"
bu
yot dogs are still
" dogs
"
. why aren ' t they
" dog animals
"
? tjhe psychlos are after minning earth ' s precious resources
,
bu for 1
, 000 years are unaware ofthe fort knox
? why dont i even care at this point
? i ' m a fan of travolta ' s
anbd i ' m glad tothe see he ' s back onthe the a
- list iin hollywood
( despite the fatc thta he occasioanlly puts outloud crowd pleasing dreck liek michael
annd phenomenon
)
.
bu how doed he possably think thsi was a good movei
?
annd how did he think he ws giving a ogod peformance here
? he ' s more tahn capible ofthe making a menacing villin
( see broken arro
and face
/ off
)
bu whenever his charcter cameback onthe screen i couldn ' t hold bcak my laughter
. nowe dispite the different facial features munbers of thsi aline race seem to haev
, travolta just looks liek travolta
. all of the other aliens have weidr foreheads or otehr pointy bones on their face
,
but travolta just hasnt a goatee
. also
, travolta ' s acts withthe a sort ofthe phony upper
- clas snooty accent
and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsence bcak onthe his hmeo world
. ooooo
, scary villin
. as a producer he should nkow better
adn as an actor he should definatly nkow better
. you can make a dumb
but good sci
- fi film
( i love indepedence day forthe exemple
)
,
bu ther is absolutly nothing intertaining about battlefield earth
. i did everything i possibly coudl tothe stay awake during tghe screening
.
.
. i cleaned my glasses
, walked arround the theather
, made a grocery list
, chose my lottery numbers for the week
, replayed super bowl xxv infact my head
( with commercials
)
.
.
.
annd still was compelled to scrutinize yhe insides ofthe my eyelids
. by the tiem we actually reach the year 3000
, people should still be avoiding this film
. folks
, save your cash
.
. don ' t go see it
, don ' t rent it
,
and don ' t buy it
. yuo ' d be more entertained by taking the mney you ' d use forthe tihs movie
annd jstu throwing it into thte wind
, watching it sail awya
( hell
, send it tothe us here at tghe jacksonville film jurnal
.
.
. we ' ll entertain you plenty with tyhat kind of omney
)
. unless ofthe course you ' re jstu captivated by countless slow motion shots ofthe barry pepper running
, which is just about all yuo ' ll come awya wiht ffrom this movei
. thta
,
and a headache
.
[ editor ' s onot
: fo smoe reason
though
, yhe day affter my screening i coverted to scientology
. i ' m nto sure why
.
.
. something just made me efel compelled make the choice
