" return to horror high
,
" whants to be a cuple different types of movies at once
. tjhe film tells the stor ofthe a low
- budget horror movie being filmed at teh closed
- down crippen high
, a school where a group ofthe serial murders took palce five eyars befor
.
bu what the cast
annd crew don ' t know is that a real killer
, mabey the same oen that was never apprehended
, is going into action again
. onthe oney level
,
" return to horror high
" isnt a slasher movei
,
and it isnt at tihs levle that it works the best on
. watching tyhe film
, wich ws made inwhich 1987
, i couldn ' t help
but tkae notice thgat tjhe killer ' s costume wass alomst identital tothe that ofthe tghe ghostface in
,
" scream
,
"
adn
" scream 2
.
" onthe anohter level
, the film whants tothe be a slapstick comedy
,
and htere are many hints ofthe this thoughout
. unfortunatly
, most ofthe theese jokes fall flat
.
and the last hting yhe film wants tothe be is a
" behind
- tyhe
- scenes
" look at an exploitation film bieng made
. the onyl probelm is that
, while much of it isnt supposed to be fomr tje movie itself being made
, noone cameras are shown filming it
, thus making it far more confusing thna it hadnt tothe be
.
anbd to top it all off
, the
" twist
" ending makes very littel to no sence whatsoever
,
adn so we are basicly left iwth feeling as if we wasted our tyme
. ther are stopry developments that are beyond ludicrous
,
anbd plot holes yuo could drive a winnebago through
. if yuo see the film
, or haev seen it
, you ' ll know wqat i mean
. tyhe premise of
" return to horror high
,
" isnt admittedly pretty crafty
,
and i liekd the atomsphere ofthe the school
, whlch isnt where the wohle thing tkaes place
.
but directer froehlich
, judging from thsi movie
, is an incompetent director
, exept fo bieng able to film the seldomly suspeneful scene
. well
, come to think of it
, ther is only oney scene tath isnt actually scary
,
and it hasnt to do wih twpo actors bieng locked infact a room as tjhe killer tries tothe break in
.
bu other than that twpo
- minute distraction
,
" return tothe horror high
,
" isnt certainly no great shake
. note
: look for george clooney infact a supporting role as one of tje actors on tghe film
.
anbd strangely enough
, he isnt tghe first chracter tothe git the ax
.
.
. literally
