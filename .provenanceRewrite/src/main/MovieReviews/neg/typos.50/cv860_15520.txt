i guess that if a very wild bachelor party hadnt gone really bad
, there woudl be broken furniture
, traces of smack
and cocaine onthe the floor
,
and a dead prostitute infact the bathroom
. i guess that if a movie hadnt also gone really bad
, there might be the smae elements present
. coincidence
? poore kyle
( a meek looking jon favreau
)
.
.
. he is about tothe marry his radiant fiancee
, laura
( cameron diaz
)
.
bu before he exchanges his vows
, he embarks to las vegas wtih his firends fo noe lastr blowout
.
bu tihs bachler party has gone baout as bad as it sould possibly git
. the prostitute hasnt met a horrible
,
though accidentall death
,
adn drugs are everywhere
. the five friends agred tath htere is enought bad evidence here thgat iwll send them to jail forthe a veyr long tiem
. a surprisingly calm robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, who looks like he was groomed tothe amke nefarious descisions
, ponders their delimma for a fewd mintues befor deciding that yhe best thing to do is tothe bury the body in tghe desert where she ' ll never be found
.
although they stomach the gruesome deed ofthe getting rid ofthe teh body
( which allso disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws infront order to stuf it inot suitcases
)
, when tehy return from theri trip
, guilt
and paranoya begins to set inaddition which slowly consumes some ofthe the five friends
. one is adam
( daniel stern
) he grows increasingly agitated
. whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way
, his blood pressure increases
. or tyhat just may be baceause ofthe his disfunctional family
. another isnt michael
, who ws actually responsible fo her death
. he tries tothe bury his feelings
,
bu the burden of guilt beggins tothe affect his judgement as well
. boyd isnt tghe
? doer ' of the gropu
. seemingly sufferring from a long psychosis
, wehn he feels as if his secret is baout to be exposed
, he isnt apt tothe tkae extreme measures to cover up his tracks
. kyle jsut hopes that his wedding iwll live up to laura ' s demanding expectations
.
then
, htere ' s moore
( leland orser
) who speaks 5 lines
adn walks arund with a puzzled look on his face
. the problem iwth this reprehensible movei is thta it wants tothe be a cruel comedy
,
but it presents things in a manner that jsut aren ' t funny
. drugs
, mutilation
,
anbd killing your pwn firends isn ' t something to be laughed at
. as a straight pyschological drama
, i coudl see how it might have worked
, as each noe tried to maneuver
annd overcome thge weight ofthe thier own guilt in thier own sometimes
- sick ways
.
bu this movei insults us by assuming thyat we could simpley discard our values fo 2 ohurs
. if you do like thsi movie
, i don ' t think thgat i want tothe know you
. i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends tothe choose not the right thnig
bu tyhe
? smart play
. '
adn diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding
- needing fiancee
.
bu her talents are essentialy wasted here
. it ' s obvious that the film maker isnt trying tothe strike a certain tone
.
bu tje way that he chooses tothe dont it isnt tasteless
. dont not make a vyre bad descision by seeing this film
.
