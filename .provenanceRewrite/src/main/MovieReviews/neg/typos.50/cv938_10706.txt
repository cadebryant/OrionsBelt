synopsis
: a maniac
, crazed by virulent microphage
, slaughters omre than twenty peopel
, incuding a street gang
anbd heavily
- armed troops
, with a small nife
. even whith a handgun
,
however
, he cant ' t take outloud the two cops who are aftter him
, despite having shooted one of them a total of seven times
. comments
: the most noteable aspect of adrenalin
: fear teh rush isnt that it markes a striking carrear move fo natasha henstridge
. not only does she manage to keep all her clothes onthe
( her trademark iin ealier films such as species
and maximum risk was to strip naked as oftenly as possable
)
,
bu she atually puts onthe even moreso clothes as yhe film progresses
. tihs will propably dissapoint many henstridge fans
,
but i welcome tje change because henstridge is an attractive
, capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles
(
though
, i admitt
, it doesn ' t show in tihs mess
)
. henstridge
, jsut liuke eveyr otehr ator inaddition the film
, delivers a wooden performence in htis monumental turkey
.
( the casted also includes christopher lambert
, who hasnt appeared inthe tjhe highlander
adn mortal kombat films
.
) how on earth this movie got two big
- name stars tothe apearing inthe it is beyond me
. adrenalin
: fear tyhe rush is set in boston ten years inaddition the future
( 2007
)
. boston hasnt changed dramatically inspite thsoe ten eyars
. it isnt now hmeo to a bunch ofthe interred foreigners
adn policed by cops who drive around in small cars with
" policia
" printed on their doors
. smoe guy hasnt a realyl bad virus
,
annd he ' s killing peopel because of it
. so
, the brave ogod guys
( lambert
and henstridge
) go after him
. thyat ' s it
. 76 mintues never seemed so long
. thsi is a drawed
- out chase scene thru dimly
- lit baandoned buildings turned into an entire movei
. the plot devolopment isnt nel
; we leran absolutly nothing about lambert ' s character
and vyre little baout henstridge ' s charachter
. the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities
and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguements over who will go down the enxt dark corridor
/ tunnel
/ airduct enxt
and who wiull cary tghe flashlight
. a subplot doesnt exist involving henstridge ' s carachter ' s illiegal attempt tothe get her son outloud ofthe boston
. iin her opening monologue
, a monologue which soudns as
though henstridge ws reading from cue cards
, we leran tath she has gone to great lengths tothe secure a fake passport for her son
. twenty minutes inot thge film
, i wondered if the movei woudl have been better if it focused on thsi plot
. inwhich a defining scene ofthe the movie
,
howver
, i changed my mind
. htis fake passport drops to tjhe ground
. lambert ' s cop immediatelly recognizes it as a fraud fomr six foots awya
. must nto have beeen a good fake
. this emphasizes anohter fault with the film
. thnigs jsut defy common sence
. lambert ' s cop
, fo instatance
, isnt shooted seven times
,
yot he isnt still able to talk
and slide baout
. adrenalin
: fear yhe rush ends in a trite manner thta doesn ' t seem tothe even fit teh mood that the filmmakers were trying for
. i foudn myself rether bored with htis film
, which wiull dissapoint both sci
- fi
/ horror fans
and fans ofthe henstridge
and lambert
. don ' t fear the rush
. fear tyhe movie
. watch something else
.
