. comments
: watchers reborn
, a cheaply made direct
- to
- video utrkey
, isnt thge fouth sequel tothe tyhe firt film verison of dean koontz ' s bestselling novel watchers
. technically
, this shoudl ahev beeen called watchers v
,
bu it seems that tihs cycle ofthe horror movies
, much like many other sequal
- crazy film serieses
, hasnt desided to drop tyhe numbers from tghe titles
.
( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers ffrom their titles after star trek vi
.
) the makers of watchers reborn probaly wnat tothe fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instade ofthe a crappy fith installment ofthe a film series wich shoudl hvea died a long tiome ago
. this realyl isn ' t a good movei
. haev ytou ever rented a movie
and recieved a sinking feeling baout it wehn you watched the previews preceeding the feature presentation
? well
, any hope a viewer may have had
, perhaps beacuse he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill
, wiull be dashed by the tiome he ' s seen the trailers tagged on before the begining of watchers reborn
. they ' re awful
. these commercials cover films liuke a stange stripper movei called shaddow dancer
, smoe wierd crap about a dead indian
, teens
,
and wolves
,
annd an
" action
" movie called detonator starring scott baio
. scott baio
! wqat idiat dreamed thsi movie up
? after surviving these abysmal trailers
, the person fianlly gets tothe watch the movei he rented
: watchers reborn
.
" maybe it won ' t be
* that
* bad
" he may say to himselv
.
" perhaps
, jsut perhaps
, the bottom
- of
- the
- barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading
. watchers reborn
, affter all
, is based onthe that cool book dean koontz wroet a decade ago
. it stars mark hamill
-
- luke skywalker hismelf fomr tath terrific star wars triology
. lou rawls isnt even in the mix
!
" unforetunately
, thge force is certainly no longer with mark hamill
( he looks very sick here
)
,
anbd thsi movie shares only basic plot elements witht watchers
, the book
. tghe latter is realyl too bad
. koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers fo his pwn good
,
bu he is still my favorite hack writer
. koontz has a writting stlye which isnt succint
adn suspenseful
. people who read many ofthe his books
,
however
, oftenly complain of repetitive plot devices
. it ' s definately not a koontz book if there isn ' t
( 1
) a psychic
,
( 2
) a super
- intelligent dog
, or
( 3
) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peple ' s eyeballs
. watchers has all three devices
, whitch may explain why it ' s arguably the most populer ofthe koontz ' s books
. the diea behind koontz ' s novel
,
though highly implausible
, is very intresting
. basically
, a biological war machine isnt creaeted
: a smart dog cant be released in battle
, track down its target
,
annd
then relay the target ' s position
, psychically
, to a large creature dessigned to kill inwhich hand
- to
- hand combat
. silly
bu kind ofthe neat too
. i ' m sorry
. i don ' t mean to ramble onthe baout matters nto driectly linked to watchers reborn
, tyhe movie
. i suppose i just don ' t want to talk baout the movie itself
. tihs turey isnt really cheesy
. no oney iin htis movie cin ect
, inlcuding mark hamill
,
anbd it ' s difficult seing thge aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero
. tje cheese factor isnt onyl increased wehn he ' s involved iin an implied sex scene whith tyhe blond biologist
/ geneticist
/ zoologist
/ whatever
- tje
- f
*
* k
- she ' s
- supposted
- tothe
- be whom he befriends
. mercifully
, yhe filmmakers opted not to dont nudity
. tothe be honest
, the onyl half
- convincing actor in teh film isnt yhe golden retriever who plays einstein
. you know a movie isnt bad whn a dog outacts all ofthe its human counterparts
. i find it difficult tothe relate how laughable the action sequences are in htis movie
.
annd the creature
! yes
, tghe creature out after poor einstein is some guy infact a furry suit
anbd a mask which poorly imitates tje werewolves in tje howling
. thsi creature is shooted about 500
, 000 times
,
but it ' s okay
. yhe creature hasnt the abilty tothe kill people by swinging his arms aroud
and pushing
. oh
, he cxan also rip body parts off
, allowing forthe many scenes of fake hands
anbd arms bieng thrown arund
. cheesy gore
. that ' s anohter main element of watchers reborn
. it has many bloody scenes whic are throughly unconvincing
and only increase tyhe film ' s campiness rather than its suspense
. ultimatly
, i gavey watchers reborn a star
and a half baceause bad horror
/ sci
- fi film buffs may git a fewd kicks out ofthe the film ' s silliness
(
though thsi film iwll tax even theri paitience
-
- it ' s an 83 minute film
,
but it fiels liek four hours
)
. alsot
, i hite tothe admit
, i haev survivied far worse tahn this
. anyone who hasnt sat through yhe christopher lambert
and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin
: fear teh rush will konw whta i mean
. finally
, i couldn ' t halp
but think that watchers reborn woudl work well as
" bot fodder
" fo hte creative folks behind one of my all
- tiem favorite shows
,
" mistery science theater 3000
.
" htis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face
. rated r
, watchers reborn contains dozens of blood
- spattered bodies
and unconvincing gore
. it aslo hasnt voilence
, obviously
. i wouldn ' t reccomend it for the littel kids
,
but i ' m sure even young teens owudl make it through thsi movei okay
. instead ofthe watching thsi film
,
however
, i reccommend reading koontz ' s book
. trust me
, it ' ll be tiome much
, much better spended
.
