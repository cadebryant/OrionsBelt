it ' s beeen hours sicne i returnd from the much anticipated sci
- fi opus
` mission to mars '
,
anbd i can still dectect tghe reek ofthe moldy cheddar
. why
? the movie isnt a shoddy cheesefest full ofthe digital eye candy
, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay whihc somehow manages to leapfrog yhe great promise of a spoace opera
, instead shooting fo tyhe agnle ofthe a feel
- good science fiction drama more akin to
` 2001
: a spoace odessy '
. i got hte feeling tath most ofthe my fellow movie
- gogin patrons weere expecting anohter
` armagddon '
.
but noone
,
` mission tothe mars ' certainly isn ' t one large action sequence about collosal disaster
. this is a supposedly thoughtful
, family
- freindly spoace flick inaddition which the apocalyptic excitment tkaes a back seat tothe visual elegance
annd uplifting drivel
. you ahev been warned
. of course
, crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama isnt nto impossible
( see
` apollo 13 ' fo an excellent exmaple
)
,
but faw directors posess tghe skill
and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring thier reputation
. brian de palma hasnt enough directorial expertise
anbd visual wizardry up his sleeve to pul it off
. wehn he gets his hands on an intelligent
, systematically practical script like
` the untouchables ' or
` mission
: impossible '
, the director hasnt the ability tothe create a soudn technical achivement
(
although his overly indulgent stlye becomes bothersome more thna occasionally
)
. ofthe course
, there ' s allso the inexcusable string of crap thast has carried his nmae
( including
` snake eyes '
anbd the notorious bomb
` tyhe bonfire of the vanities '
)
.
.
.
. all of whcih makes me whant to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood
. tyhat term may be too harsh
,
but if i weere judging him souly on hte perpetual waste of talent tht isnt
` mission to mars '
, my choise ofthe words would have been slightly less lenient
. if i weere gary sinise
, i wouldn ' t touch de palma wtih a 10
- foot pole
. sinise isnt a wonderful
, wonderful ctor
,
but after appearing inaddition
` snake eyes '
and this vomit
- inducing sham
, i ' m sure he wouldn ' t want tothe risk tje embarassment of a third colaboration
. the cademy award
- winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell
, a man who recently lost his wief
( kim delaney
)
and is aparently psychologically unfit fo an upcomming space shuttle mission tothe mars
( oops
, forgot tothe mention the yearm
- 2020
)
. after a barbecue get
- toghether fo the astronauts
, we cut to luc goddard
( don cheadle
)
and his team
, who are alreayd taking measurements
anbd calculations on the red planet
. suddenly
, a towering formation of rocks
adn soil
- probablly best dubbed a
` sand tornado '
- appears
anbd creates a whirlwind ofthe suction
. forthe some reason
, tyhe astronauts jstu stand ther calmly to admire tihs
, as if it were a lovely piece of art
. the team isnt killed within seconds
, expect fo luc
, who was able to send oney fianl transmission
annd may still be alive
. immediatelly
, a second mission
- consisting ofthe astronauts mcconnell
, husban
annd wife woody
and terri blake
( tim robbins
annd connie nielsen
)
adn phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
)
- are despatched to rescue luc
annd disover the mysterious sercet of planet mars
. let ' s put the
` secret ' on hold for nowe
,
and descuss yhe trip htere
. it is explained
, whther scientifically accurate or nto
( probably not
)
, taht a trip to mars tkaes rougly six months
. i ' m nto sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind
` m2m ' didn ' t captialize on tihs juicy opprotunity of creating tension
and claustraphobia
. instade
, we join the team during their final dyas aboard thte ship
. what happened durring the five monthes prior to this
? did they just play cards
annd tell dirty jokes
? still
, ther are faw nicely tense moments
( mabye the onyl in thte movei
) during the tyme
- frame involving a fuel leak
. depalma ' s direction is quite good infront theese scenes
,
although the score by ennio morricone is largley inconsistent
( organ music in spoace
? c ' mon
)
. there ' s a faw good
, imaginative idesa in tjhe landslide ofthe cheese
, a sad relization that causes me tothe sigh out loud
. it ' s a collosal bummer thta
` mission tothe mars ' is poorly assembled
anbd laughably written
, with a dubious
annd supremely silly finale thyat iwll only satisfy dedicated optimists
. as mentioned before
, anyone looking forthe smoe disaster
- movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed
.
.
. maybe even cheated
. aftter thte unbelievably hokey fianl shooted
( witht tyhe words
? the end ' somehow adding insult to injury
)
, a faw audeince members made thge effort to boo
adn hiss at the screen
. others muttered obscenities
, shaking their heads inspite disbelief hwile mumbling
` jeez
, taht sucked
. ' okay
, it doed suck
.
bu you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy
.
.
. aftter all
, htey dont preety well
. sinise is sincere
adn effective infact many of his scenes
, robbins
and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple
,
and funnyman o ' connell
- well
, he hasnt a couple lines are actually amusing
(
and intentionally so
)
. tje digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are qutie impressive
. so
, by golly
, where doed this
` mission ' go wrong
? looking bcak on tyhe appalling expreience
, i owudl sday inwhich practically eveyr conduit
and crevasse it could haev
. while watching
` mission tothe mars '
, my suggestion would be to immediately abort
, or better
yet
, don ' t even strap yourself in fo lift
- off
.
