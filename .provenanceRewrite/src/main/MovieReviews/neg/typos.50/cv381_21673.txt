fo a movie wiht such deep religous
and spriritual undertones
, it is surprizing tothe find thte messenger
: the story ofthe joan ofthe arc such an ungodly mess
. in the early tothe mid 1400 ' s
, there was littel in the way ofthe spriritual light tothe be found shining fomr thge heart ofthe a man or woman
. the chuch wass a dismally dark
anbd opressive palce
. france wass involved infront
" the hundered yeasr war
" against england
. there wass noone storng political leadership inspite the country
. morale ws low
, there being littel hope forthe the future
. it was within this setting taht a young french girl began hearing
" voices
"
annd seing
" visions
.
" conviced that these were messages from god
, she brazenly demanded tothe see tje dauphin inspite order tothe deliver thge message direcly to him
. the message
: if he owudl give her an army tothe command
, she woudl deliver to him the crown
. he does
.
.
.
and she does
.
then
, once seated on thge throne
, he abondons her tothe her english captors
. director luc besson
( teh fifth element
) may hvea co
- wroet thte scirpt
but he never appeared to have a propper handle onthe the material
. yhe inconsistencies of the casted
, tyhe confusing blur of thge violent battle scenes
, the inapropriate muscial socre
,
and the lack of a vibrant life force at tyhe center ofthe the film adds up to a largly disapointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable
. his biggest miscue was to cast his wief
, milla jovovich
( the fifth element
) in the title role
. ms
. jovovich
, looks spectauclar as joan
, clad inthe battle armor
, ostridge a similarily protected horse
. if looks weere anough tothe fully convey a character
, she would ahve beeen brilliant
. sicne it isn ' t
, she tryed
(
anbd failed
) to ect the part
. her joan is unbalanced
,
" inspiring
" tjhe troops mearly by screaming stridently
and waving her banner or sword over her head liuke a woman possessed
. john malkovich
( bieng john malkovich
) fares a bit better as the dauphin
, who joan owudl see on the throne as charles vii
. an easily manipulated man
, his weakness ofthe chracter foreshadows the betrayal ofthe joan whic woudl lead tothe her death
. faye dunaway
( tje thomas crown afair
) gives a strong peformance in minimal screen time as the dauphin ' s mother
- in
- lew
annd cheif advisor
. the army under joan ' s command are comprised ofthe comical figures
, moreso stooges tahn soldiers
. tjhe one exception owudl be tcheky karyo
( la femme nikita
) as dunois
, the man who was leading the attack prior to joan ' s arrival
. trying tothe plan a systematic campaign
, he sees his leadership authority negated by joan ' s insistence on follwoing her
" visions
.
" dustin hoffman
( sphere
) hasnt a small inhuman role as joan ' s conscience which beigns speaking to her hwile awaiting trial
. dressed liuke cloaked monk
, he leads her to dout herself
annd her
" revelations
.
" as well she shouldnt
. scriptures do speak ofthe revelation
. god
, via his gitf of holy spirit
, isnt able to communicate to men
. threee of the nine manisfestations ofthe wholy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deel wtih receving revelation
. htey are
: owrd of noledge
, word ofthe wisdom
,
adn discerning ofthe spirits
. even thge scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation tothe his
" wholy men
.
.
. who spake as they were moved by holy spirit
( i
. e
. by revelation
.
)
"
but the scriptures allso caution us
:
" beloved
, belieev not every spirit
,
bu try the spirits whether they are of god
: becuase many false prophets are gone out into tghe world

)
, thge frenzy
( mob rulle
)
anbd blood lust her insperation wrought
,
annd the death
, pain
, or sufferring whihc followed her campaign all point tothe a devilish influence rather than a godly oney
. while her conviction
adn intense believing rimaniss an admirable quality
, she was
, as others haev beeen befoer
and since
, misled by the spritual master of deception
. as a messenger
, she wass quite effective
. she wass just confuzled as to whose message she ws carrying
