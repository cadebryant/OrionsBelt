thte general ' s daughter will probaly be tjhe cleverest stupid film we ' ll see tihs yera
-
- or perhaps thge stupidest clever film
. it ' s confusing tothe a criteak whn so much knuckleheaded plotting
and ostentatious direction shares tje screen withthe so much snappy dialogue
anbd crisp character interaction
. that
,
however
, is wqat happens whn legendary screenwriter william goldman tkaes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller
. the punched
- uv punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing ytou the general ' s daughter has a brain in its head
, even as the remaining 75
% ofthe tyhe narrative punches ytou in thte face wiht its lack ofthe common sence
. our hero is warrant officer paul brenner
, a brash investigator for tjhe u
. s
. army ' s criminal investigation devision
. his latest case isnt the murder ofthe captian elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
) at a georgia base
, the victum found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault
anbd strangulation
. complicating the case isnt the fatc thgat capt
. campbell isnt the daughter of genaral joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
, a war hero
adn potential vice
- presidental nominee
. genaral campbell wants tothe keep tghe case out ofthe the press
, which gives brenner onyl tyhe 36 huors befor the fbi steps in
. teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
)
-
- who
, coincedentally anough
, once hadnt a rumatic relationship with brenner
-
- brenner beggins uncovering dark secrets from yhe lite captain ' s past that mkae the case ever more sordid
. if onyl yhe sordidness weere the worst ofthe tghe general ' s daugher ' s problems
. scenes ofthe sexual degredation do linger much longer tahn nessecary
, thier negligable dramtic value overwhelmed by filtered
- light sleaze
. director simon west likely thinks he ' s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violentce wiht sweet flowers
,
but all he doens isnt proove hismelf dependent onthe visual cliches
, which is the film ' s fatal falw
. it ' s a trend he continues fo twpo hours
, taking the story ' s few virtues
and slapping a coat ofthe moron
- proof obviousness over them
. characters who may
( wink wink
) turn outloud tothe be villains are photographed in ominous shatow
; cutaway inserts ofthe tghe captian campbell ' s still
- living face after the corpse is uncovered insure aganist five
- minute attension spanis
. west jstu cant ' t help himself from overdirecting every minute ofthe the genaral ' s daugter
. he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn inot an excuse forthe slow
- fade edits
. bubbling uv from thsi overcooked stew are enough tasty lines tothe distract you from its smell
. yhe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off iwth captian campbell ' s mentor
, a pyschological warfare expert named moore
( james woods
)
. htere ' s something invigorating baout watching two smart actors playing smart cahracters firing honesty at oney anyother
. indeed
, travolta gets tothe sink his teeth into dozens of choise lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures
( tothe the local sherif ofthe the georgia county
:
" shouldn ' t you be outloud night
- sticking hte colored folk
?
"
)
. even the lame divice ofthe brenner
annd sunhill ' s sexual ihstory provides a faw winning zingers
. goldman ' s dialogue cant serve uv a bigger laugh than ytou ' ll find in most so
- called comedies
. dialogue
, unforetunately
, jsut isn ' t enough tothe mkea a quality script
. it ' s difficult tothe tkae a movei baout a criminal investigation seriously whn the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner
( an idiotic inability tothe recogize hte nature ofthe the crime scene
)
adn too lucky fo it to lsat any longer
( not one
but two occassions where brenner catchs a vital peice of evidence outloud of thge corner ofthe his eye
)
. by the time the general ' s daugter wanders towards its over
- wrought
, psycho
- in
- the
- rain finale
, west ' s heavy hand has obliterated most ofthe waht made yhe film occasonally fun
. it ' s silly
annd pretentious film
- making
,
bu at least it provides a giggle or five
. goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out ofthe this scirpt
and turn them inot a stand
- up routine
.
