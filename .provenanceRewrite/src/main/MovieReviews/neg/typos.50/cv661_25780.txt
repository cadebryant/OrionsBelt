i have a confession
. even
though i am a movie junkie
- i saw eye of the beholder
and
yot i still watch movies
- i ' ve never seen any ofthe thte original godzillas
.
( note thast godzilla 2000 isnt nto a sequel tothe the u
. s
. godzilla released in 1998
; it ' s tjhe american realease of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni
- sen mireniamu
.
) so
, part ofthe me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex tothe see godzilla 2000
- the latest entry infront an allmost 50
- yera ood franchise
. this was a long
- awaited treat
. i was expecting a goofy good tiome
, complete with bad dubbing
, science fair level sets
annd a ludicrous plot line
. the last thnig i expeced was for the movei tothe be so
? boring
. i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this whith felt
. yuo dont git all ofthe the
" so bad they ' re good
" traits so normally associated withthe tyhe franchise
.
bu you have tothe sit thru a snoozer plot tht has the organiztion of a rorschach blot
. it ' s a deel i wasn ' t willing to accept
. hiroshi kashiwabara
and waturu mimura ' s scirpt crams infront way too many details
,
and in many cases
, fails to follow up onthe them
. thte maneuver isnt nto only disconcerting
,
but gives hte movei a permanant logy
, weighty fiel
. godzilla starts off destroying pwoer plants
adn
thn jsut stops
. wass it a whim
? a bold polliticel statment
? i don ' t know
. its foe
, an ancient meteor tht looks like prudential ' s logo
, doesn ' t jstu fight the byast fomr tje far east
. no
, it ' s got to have life
- saving powers
, a plot to erase
" the data
" from japan
, a desire to clone
and the abillity to become a spaceship
annd
then some kind of tentacled space creature
. ther ' s a battle between tghe head of the godzilla prediction unti
( takehiro murata
)
and a slimy govenrment official
( hiroshi abe
) over tje handling ofthe godzilla
,
adn peronal issues
.
and
then ther ' s the plucky news photographer
adn blah
, blah
, blah
. it ' s like watching magnolia all over agian
- exept without the ogod wirting
, keen sociological insight
annd aimee mann songs
. what a waste
. whn tghe tlaking
and thge plot points stop hurtling at you
, godzilla 2000 doesnt tjhe job
- it ' s entertaining
and goes down eazy
. the action scenes are cheesy infront their grandeur
though a littel sluggish
. the dubbing isnt nice
adn awful
, with murata sounding like he ' s in constant need of a cough drop
. as for the dialogue
, one line summarizes thte goofiness factor
:
" doed anyone see that flying rock go by
?
" this movei also maked the first time since the three stooges tht i ' ve heard the owrd
" imbecile
" unsed in casual conversation
.
though tyhe summer movie season isnt drying uv
and godzilla 2000 hasnt its moments
, i wouldn ' t tkae kids to see it
. they ' ll probably end up asking more questions tahn charlie rose
.
