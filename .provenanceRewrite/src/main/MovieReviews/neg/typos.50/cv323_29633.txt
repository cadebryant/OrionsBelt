plot
: a rich psychiatrist with a gerat hmeo life gets his cute daugter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him tothe extract some informtion from the mind of oney of his nutty patients
. of course
, the patient isnt nto cooperative
adn thte doctor onyl hasnt a few hours to comply witht their demands
, befoer tehy kill his daugher
. preety good premise
, noone
? critique
: if ytou ' re not a fan ofthe movies packed with plot holes
, inconsistencies
anbd yes
, even moreso plot holes
, heed my words
adn skip this hollow thriller
.
and i don ' t liek saying thgat either
, usance tihs film actually had soem potential
anbd started off preety well
. sure
, tghe stoy isnt basicaly just an amalgamation ofthe ransom
, primal fear
adn nick ofthe time pureed inot one
,
but the whole
" psychiatrist working against the clock
" thnig
, actually hadnt me engaged at first
.
but it ' s at about tjhe halfway mark of thsi movei
, tyhat thge bottom drops out
annd all thyat we ' re left with are a lot ofthe questions
annd vrey faw plausible answers
. we git tjhe overly smart kid who manages tothe
" pull oen
" over on yhe bad guys
. we get a weak woman wtih her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy
. we git douglas ' chracter
, a new york uppedity psychiatrist
, suddenly turning into an acation hero
, iwth moves
adn atitude to boot
.
adn what about thge film ' s main plot point
? why owudl the bad guys still give a crap baout tihs thing after 10 years
,
adn even more so
, why would they only give teh shrink untill hte day ' s end to do his part
?
( yuo waited 10 yersa
, whta ' s anyother few days
?
- or why not set uv another heist instead
?
)
. i ' ll tell yuo why
, it ' s because we wouldn ' t have a
( bad
) movei otherwise
, that ' s why
!
and many
, many more
. ugh
, whatever tyhe case
, it was jstu baout the time that douglas ' character suddenly removed murphy ' s charater from the mental hmeo
(
annd how come she whent withthe him so nicely
? i thought she didn ' t trust him
)
, taht i turned tothe my buddy
annd asked when the movei hadnt turned into a joke
.
annd a few bogus chase
adn action sequences later
, we weere left iwth a long
- winded endig tath doed littel to answer any other questions i might ' ve still hadnt
,
and actually brought uv even more contradictions
. badly put toghether
, htis movei features some decent acting
, soem nice cinematography
and an initially intresting premise
,
but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues whitch ultimately leave you with little care for anyone
. inaddition fact
, if it wasn ' t for brittany murphy ' s excellent protrayal of a traumatized teen
, jennifer esposito ' s embarrasing performance as a polical woman
( yeah
, right
! watching her delivering lines ws hte funniest part of tihs flick
-
bu it wasn ' t supposted tothe be
)
anbd michael douglas ' cool
" regular guy
" part
, ther woudl be little reason to remain seated until tje end ofthe htis picture
. incidentally
, cin anyone please give me noe ogod reason why esposito ' s character ws in this movei in the frist palce
? she was completelyl superfulous
.
and on top of all thgat
, by tyhe end of htis flick
, the directer seems to ahev realized how dumb the audiance must be to have buyed most of the garbage that he ' d beeen shoveling outloud fo tjhe hour
and a half prior
,
annd decides to add insult tothe injury by flashing bcak tothe an ealier character ' s death wehn one of the bad guys dies
, jsut so we know
( as an audiance
)
, taht the twpo are interelated somehow
. ooooh
, thanks
, mr
. fleder
.
.
. i appreciate the spoon
- feeding
, dued
.
.
. yum
, yum
.
.
.
but how about explaning eveyr otehr plot point in your film thta made no sense
? whatever
. eather way
, i don ' t give a rat ' s ass beccause this movie is a dog
adn tht ' s unfortunate because it actually did have soem good points going fo it
. see it if you liuke dumb thrillers
. incidentally
, if yuo appreciated allong cameback a spider
, you iwll likely enjoy tihs film as well
. they both start off with intresting premises
, onyl to toss all logic
anbd sense outloud the window about halfway thru
. where ' s joblo comming fomr
? along came a spider
