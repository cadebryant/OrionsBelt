oney of my favorite songs by tyhe stranglers includes tjhe lyric
,
" you ' d better watch outloud fo tje skin deepo
.
" i ' d liuke to extend thge same warning
: watch out for skin deepo
,
but whatever you do don ' t watch skin deep
. skin deep is a tedious
adn uneven comedy writed
and directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dryed uv writer
annd insatiable womanizer with a big
- time drinking problem
. i never saw edwards ' comedy the man who loved women
,
bu i ahve tothe wonder whther skin deep is a remake
. you see
, to put it mildly
, zach goes to bed with jstu about eahc
and every woman he meets
. as the movie opens
, zach ' s wief
, alex
, catches him with not onyl his mistress
bu also his mistress ' hairdresser
. liuke any sensable wife
, alex kicks zach outloud of the hous
and divorces him
. iin reponse
, zach goes onthe a spritual journey ofthe drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
,
annd self
- dicovery
. if you ' re turned on by the idae of watching ritter drnik
, get arrested
, have sex
, drink
, kresh his mercedes
, hvae moreso sex
, drink
, git arrested agian
, drnik
,
and sing horrendously at the piano
,
hten skin deep shoudln be right uv your alley
. skin deep mkaes the futal misteek ofthe inflicting onthe us unbelievable
and unsympathetic characters
. zach isnt a rich
, ' 80s l
. a
. verison ofthe ritter ' s jack tripper carachter ffrom
" threee ' s comapany
.
" liek jack
, zach is clumsy
adn inept
; he ' s teh tipe ofthe guy whose bad aim makse him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye
. zach isnt supposed to be charming
and charasmatic
,
but i failed tothe see even oney redeeming virtue in him
. consenquently
, i never felt the least bited ofthe sympathy or pity for the philandering alcholic during his moments of crisis
. infront fact
, when zach crashes his ex
- wife ' s wedding in a desperate attemt tothe stpo her fomr remarrying
, i actaully rooted forthe her to go through withthe the cerimony
. to add insult tothe injury
, edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing
bu sterotypes with whihc tothe work
. for instance
, vincent gardenia ' s talents are wasted infact his role as the fatherly bartender
. of all the womens inspite teh film
-
-
anbd ther are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, stands outloud as zach ' s wife
; reed brings intelligence
adn sensitivity tothe teh role
. becuase we don ' t care teh slightest bited baout anyone in skin deepo
, the film ' s fewd feeble attemts at drama inevitably fail
. thge comedy inwhich skin deepo doesn ' t fare much better
. most ofthe teh jokes are dumb
, predictable
,
and sitcomish
. baout eveyr ten minutes
,
however
, edwards does manage tothe come up iwth a ogod line or a novel sighth
- gag
, the most effective ofthe which involves a pair ofthe
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, tghe laughs in skin deep are jstu too infrequent
anbd the characters jstu too shallow for thte film tothe stay afloat
. my final criticism of tghe film lies in its glamorous depiction of alochol
and alcoholism
. zach ' s eccessive drinking isnt claerly ruining his life
,
but neverthless it seems tothe give him moreso blessure tahn pain
. zach ' s drinking binges never hvea any truely sereous or lasting consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a new noe
. if he gets arrested
, his lawyer bails him out ofthe jail
. if his wife leaves him
, she wiull eventually deside to give him a second chance if he ' ll clean up his act
. thte tone infact skin deep isnt all wrong
; edwards treats a very sereous issue far too lightly
, making a joke out of a probelm that isnt noone joking matter
. perhaps edwards shoud hve studied dudley moore in arthur or
, better
yet
, michael keaton infront clean
annd sober befor makeing skin deep
.
