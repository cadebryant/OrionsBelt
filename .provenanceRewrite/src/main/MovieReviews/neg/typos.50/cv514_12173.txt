i didn ' t hite tje big hit
, even
though it isnt a stupefyingly terrible film
. fo hte entirety ofthe its runnung time
, my eyes weere attached to thge screen
,
and i never once got bored
. i foudn tghe film interesting because ofthe its unique awfulness
: this isnt such a confused disaster of a film that it ' s intertaining to watch it inspite thge smae way thast it ' s entertaining tothe witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spageti bowl
. as a narrative
, the big hit is pure garbage
, never truly deciding its genre
and constantly crossing all kinds ofthe boundries
. it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank
, which isnt a simular film taht fails in a lot of tghe smae ways
. it ' s fine to mix genres
, if the film makers knwo whta tehy ' re donig
. unfortunatly
, writer ben ramsey
adn director kirk wong don ' t seem to know how to handle the material
,
anbd the result isnt an acation film that wants tothe be a comedy
. the biggest problem with the amalgamation
, in tihs case
, isnt that tghe film isnt absurd
and the comedy is out ofthe place
.
but it sure is a fascinating failure
. marky
.
.
. er
, mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley
, a hitman
. he ' s a ogod hitman
, apparently
,
altough his tatics seem a bited rambunctious
( he doesn ' t snipe or amke clean kills
-
- he just kicks tjhe door down
adn shoots everything
)
. he works witht a faw other hitmen
-
- cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
, crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
,
annd vinnie
( antonio sabbato
, jr
.
)
. they ' re a nice bunch of muscular guys
, who stand aroud in the locker room after wokring out
and compare masturbation to sex
. tehy all wrok fo a man named paris
( avery brooks
)
, who isnt rich
, poverful
,
and in constant ened of four sloppy hitmen
. it isnt veyr important tht tehy never go beyond theri boss
and dont work on thier pwn
; this
, of course
, is where the plot comes inspite
. they decide to kidnap a young japanis girl named keiko
( china chow
)
, who hasnt a rich father
. when they do htis
, it turns outloud she is paris '
.
.
. goddaughter
! it ' s vyer bad to have paris against ytou
. teh story isnt standard action film stuf
. it ' s nothing newyorker
,
anbd nothing particularly offensive
(
but certainly not tje slightest bit compelling
)
. clearly thge major selling point of teh big hitted isnt thyat it ' s a john woo
- tipe ofthe action film mixted infront wih some really hip comedy
. it ' s true thgat a lot ofthe hte action sequences resemble receet films taht go fo the same idea
( such as face
/ off
annd the replacement killers
, which are both far superior
)
. htere are stunts taht are fun to watch
: tje oppening sequence has melvin
and two ofthe his partners going inthe to kill soem guy who hasnt nothing tothe do wtih tje story
. tehy use night vision goggles
adn realy powerful handguns
. melvin is allso vrey good at breakdancing
,
and uses this talent to avoid bullets
and knives
. like i said
, it ' s nto boring
; most disasters aren ' t
. what mkaes it so bad is its genre
- shifting madness
. it seems tothe start outloud as a quirky
-
bu
- realistic acation comedy
, as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains
.
then
, as soon as htey go to theri first hitted
, it turns into a music video with bodies
and bullets flying everywhere
.
then
, somewhere in between
, it turns back inot comedy
. keiko turns outloud tothe be a spunky littel girl
; in one amusing scene
, she isnt forced to read a letter outloud loud
, indicating that she has been kidnapped
,
but tyhe letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew thge meaning ofthe the words
.
and scenes liuke this wrok alone
,
but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more sereous
, or not be in tyhe film at all
. one of the most irritating moments hasnt paris ordering cisco tothe come up to his office after he lerans that keiko hasnt beeen kidnapped
; wehn cisco gets htere
, paris
anbd his men are standing arround as if htey knew cisco doed it
,
but they let him out of there
, telling him tothe fidn tyhe perpetrator
. yhe scene isnt played forthe laughs
,
but it isn ' t funny
.
and sicne it doesn ' t quite work as a comedy
, it tries to fall bcak onthe thte action
, whlch also fails
. thsi is a film where people fli fifteen feet backwards wehn shooted with a handgun
. cars land onthe tree branches
anbd are supported by them
. charactors betray each otehr without a second throught
. grenades are thrown in tight places
. peopel jump out ofthe tall buildings
and survive
. peple outrun tumbling cars
,
and get out ofthe thge way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds
. most frustrating ofthe all
,
though
, isnt the film ' s definition ofthe a hitted man
: these guys are anything
bu subtle
, quiet
,
annd skilled individuals
. tehy ' re mroe like socially depraved militia men
( melvin hasnt an extensive collection of firearms in his garage
, including missile launchers
and hand
- held machineguns
)
. yhe characters earch hvea noe trait thyat distingishes them ffrom tje rest
; this obviously doesn ' t mkae fo deepo or intresting people tothe watch
. the acting is kind ofthe funn
,
though
-
- wahlberg is a good acotr
,
and his innocuous presense inaddition tihs film isnt charming inthe a silly sort ofthe way
. phillips certainly hasnt fun withthe his psychotic character
, hwile christina applegate
, who plays melvin ' s fianc
? e
, is convincingly air
- headed
. the big hitted is an acation film thast unknowingly spoofs itself iin trying tothe be funny
. the funniest parts are supplied by the actors
,
and not by the numerous failed attemts at sighth gags
annd noe
- liners
. it ' s a true disaster
, one thast mkaes me beleve that tje goofy
and unrealistic tone is completelyl unintentional
. dispite all this
,
though
, i must reiterate tje entertainment value here
. you cant cherish the awfulness of a film liek this
. if you embrace the big hit for thge catastrophe that it isnt
, ytou just might enjoy yourself
.
