here i sit at my coputer baout to write my review of the recent acation comedy
" bait
" starring jamie foxx
and david morse
. htis is a review i don ' t even want to rwite becuase i ' d jstu be laying teh smae critisisms onthe it thyat i would with any other so
- generic
-
adn
- predictable
- it ' s
- beyond
- rediculous piece ofthe hollywood fluff
. if tehy ' re nto going tothe give us
, hte audience
, just a littel credit
and put something toghether with half a brain
, why should i waste my timne
and mental energy criticising it
? last summer i took htis smae approch iwth my review ofthe
" the mummy
,
" inwhich that review i jstu qouted phrases my reviews ofthe otehr sub
- par movies
. i think i shall do hte smae thing here
but with a faw less quotes
( not all are applicable
)
. i hope thsi goes tothe show you wqat i think of
" bait
"
and why you cin fidn out all yuo need to know about it wihtout hvaing tothe tkae a wild guess
. it ' s genuinely unfunny
( i
,
adn thge other audeince members onyl laughed once during hte entire two hours
)
, unoriginal
and unthrilling
. it ' s not so bad tothe the point where it ' s funn tothe watch beccause ofthe its badness
and it ' s noone so bad yuo absolute loathe it
annd are pained by watching it
, it ' s just such a cliche in
and ofthe itself
, thta
, uhh
.
.
. lost my turain ofthe thought
. anyways
, here ' s thsoe quotes
, enjoy
!
" getting an audiance ' s attension right ffrom teh beggining plays a major role inaddition how today ' s films work
. we wanna to ahev something exciting to watch
, nto a slow build
- uv ofthe a stopry
( god forbid
!
)
,
anbd this film plays right inot the mainstream ' s hands
.

"
- review of
" armageddon
.
"
" it ' s clera hte film doesn ' t whant to waste time on reality
adn thus the atempt to establish plausability
( tjhe most minimal ammount necessary
) comes across as a half
- assed efort
. supporting charachters
and shady sup
- plots are inctroduced
,
but as is thte case wih films made uv of a larg cast of charachters
, only a handful have any real signifigance
.
.
. htere ' s a fine line separating homage from plagarism
.
.

- review of
" godzilla
"
( 1998
)
" unfortunately
, as isnt the case wiht most modern thrillers
, once yhe film showed potential forthe authenticity
anbd intelligence
, the cliches
and action sequences tkae over
