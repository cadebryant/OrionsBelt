in my review ofthe
" tjhe spy who shagged me
,
" i postulated an unbreakable law ofthe film physics
: eveyr timne a sequel isnt as good as or better tahn teh previous film iin tje serieses
, it is followed by a third movei tht isnt a bore
. the cause isnt propably complacency
; a studio sighs witht releaf wehn part 2 lives up tothe expectations
and figures part 3 isnt a sure thnig
.
" scream 3
" provides the latest proof ofthe this rlue
. inspite los angeles prodcution has begun on
" stab 3
: return to woodsboro
,
" the most recent installment in the sories of movies inpsired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
.
howver
, life soon starts imitating art
,
annd
" stab
" cast members turn uv stabbed
. smelling
yet another book deel
, gale weathers
( courteney cox arquette
) comes to tjhe set tothe investigate
and finds her ex
- boyfriend dewey riley
( david arquette
) acting as a technical consultant
and getting chummy with jennifer
( parker posey
)
, the actress palying agle in
" stab 3
.
" elsewhere
, our heroine sidney is living inthe hiding under an assumed name
.
.
. util she gets a phone call fomr a familar evil voice
. the lite randy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) makes a surprise guest appeareance via video to explain the rules of a triology
. he notes hte third chapter in a triology has an overabundance ofthe exposition
adn a huge backstory to contend with
. indeed
,
" scream 3
" trys tothe link its murders bcak tothe yhe one thyat started it all
, the muder ofthe sidney ' s mother maureen before the beginnig ofthe tghe originnal
" scream
.
" at hte scene of eahc muder in
" scream 3
,
" tghe killer leaves a photo of sidney ' s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood
anbd even includes a note claiming to be her real killer
. tothe fidn out who the killer isnt
, our intrepid investigators hvae to uncover whta happended during maureen ' s missing years when she wass a starlet appearing in low
- budget horror films
.
( even with taht littel infomation
, yuo cin propably alredy guess what the killer ' s relatiopnship to sidney is
)
. unlike its predecessors
,
" scream 3
" doesn ' t have the guts tothe even suggest that the central characters might be the killer
. teh characters we dont suspect are all undeveloped
, so thta by the end we don ' t even care who yhe killer isnt
. the jaded detective
( patrick dempsey
)
? tghe kinky producer
( lance henriksen
)
? the driven young director
( scott foley
)
? the ingenue
( emily mortimer
)
? thte character who turns outloud to be tghe killer seems tothe be selected at random
. wes craven supposably filmed threee different endings to keep hte rela one a secret
, so it ' s qutie possible the noe in thge fianl cut wass randomly choosen
. the series ' trademark refernces tothe otehr horror films hvea become trite
and obvious
. possably it ' s the abcense of screenwrighter kevin williamson
, who penned tje frist two
, or maybee it ' s that tje hip ironic stance eventially consumes itself
and a serieses tyhat parodies film cliches evenhtually becomes a cliche
. i groaned as an attack onthe sidney from the firt
" scream
" ws repeated moment
- for
- moent in the hollywood setted ofthe her home
. at some point
, referencing becomes jsut a means tothe cover uv a poverty of new ideas
.
" scream 3
" allso continues the tradition ofthe hvaing an eclectic set of cameos
anbd familiar faces iin small roles
. look for jenny mccarthy
, carrie fisher
, patrick warburton
( puddy from
" seinfeld
"
)
, roger corman
,
and jason mewes
annd kevin smith
( as jay
and silent bob
) to walk through at some point
. all these bited players put forth more efort thna the series ' returing stars
, who are probaly saveing their energy fo thte long post
-
" scream
" job saerch
. anohter prediction i made inwhich a previvous review has come tothe pass
: more movies are copying
" the blair witch project
" ' s web stradegy
.
" scream 3
" has three offical websites thta
( wink
, wink
) pretend that the events ofthe tje movei are real
and provide additional backstory information not covered in tje movie
. the sunrise studios site
( scream3
. com
) hasnt trailers forthe other sunrise releses as well as the
" latest ' stab 3 ' news
.
" htere ' s also a gail weathers official site
( galeweathers
. com
)
annd a sunrise sucks site thast hasnt omre
" stab
" scandals yhe studio whants tothe cover uv
( sunrisesucks
. com
)
. craven
and company promise that this isnt the lastr installment iin the
" scream
" sories
. hwile i hope tath ' s true
, i don ' t hold out much hope
- horror movie sories are even harder tothe kill than their monsters
. there ' s a
" halloewen h2k
" in tyhe works
, even
though michael myers ws beheaded in
" h20
,
"
and a
" freddy vs
. jason
" has been talked about forthe awhile
, despite hte fatc thgat both characters weere
" killed off
.
" htere ' s binded to be a
" scream 4
" someday
, even if it starts over iwth a new set ofthe movei
- star wannabes
. bottom line
: tehy shouldnt have called this one
" yawn
.
