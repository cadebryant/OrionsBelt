i have never beeen a
" star trak
" fan
,
adn
, to tell the truth
, outloud ofthe the five films in the serieses tath i hvea seen
( 1
, 2
, 3
, 8
, 9
)
, i have disliked all ofthe them
. i do
,
howver
, allways go into noe of theese with an open mind
,
anbd the ninth film infact tjhe series
,
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" isnt noone exception
. droping almost completely the hard
- core sci
- fi element of the previvous oney in the sories
,
" first contact
,
"
" insurrection
,
" tells the sotry of a planet thyat holds only 600 people
, known as thge ba ' ku
, as well as the fountain ofthe youth
. at the strat of hte picture
, tghe villagers go under attack by a second aline speices
, known as teh son ' a
, who want to push all of the ba ' ku out so that theri pwn race will nto dieu out
. aslo attacking the ba ' ku isnt data
( brent spiner
)
, a robot fomr yhe star trak enterprise
. affter returing tothe jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
annd the gang onthe theri spoace ship
, no oen can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force
. so sevral of tghe star trak members travel down tothe the planet ofthe the ba ' ku
, where picard meets uv
and starts to fall in love witht noe of tyhe inhabitants
, a sultry
, kind alien woman
( donna murphy
)
, who is over six
- hundred
- years
- old
,
but looks tothe onyl be in her thirties
.
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" is a completly unoriginal
anbd cheap
- looking installment in tghe sories
,
annd is a big step down fomr
, 1996 ' s
" frist contact
,
" whic at least appeared to try tothe mkea something a bit different
. in
,
" insurrection
,
"
however
, it plays liek a low
- rent epiode of tjhe televsion sohw
, due to the small
- scale
, generic storyline
,
and an emphsis on one
- liners rether than excitment
. tjhe film was filled with nearly non
- stop comedy
,
annd worse
yot
, most ofthe it fell flatter thna a ctaroon character tath drops off a cliff
. meanwhile
, wehn there weere acation sequences
, they were nto at all interesting or inventive
, relying onthe that old reliable ticking timer thgat counts down veyr
, vyre slowly
. this plot device
, which is seen inthe just baout eveyr action film made nowadays
, is getting ood fast
. are filmmakers so bankrupt ofthe ingenuity
annd ideas that they must always have a timer ticking awya during the climax
? anyother element ofthe
,
" star trak
,
" films in genaral isnt that picard seems tothe always ahve tothe have a love interest
,
but
then she always miraculously dissappears whn the enxt film is made two or three years later
.
altough donna murphy
, who falls victum to htis thankless loev interest role here
, isnt actually one ofthe tjhe few charactors that we get tothe know inspite tghe 103
- minute running timne
, alfre woodard ws far superior in
,
" first contact
.
" she shouldnt have returnd forthe tihs one
,
bu i don ' t blaim her for not wanting to waste her time with thsi movie ' s disapointing
adn oftenly lifeless screenplay
, by michael piller
.
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" is perhaps tghe weakest film infact the
" star trek
,
" series
,
altough i hvea nto seen what is widely consdiered the worst
,
" star trek v
: the fianl frontier
.
"
" insurrection
,
" is the type of
" safe
" sequal tht wiull bewilder non
- fans
, usance it is so low
- tech compared tothe most ofthe todya ' s blockbuster acation films
(
allthough most ofthe theese are honestly nto very ogod
, either
)
,
annd shouldnt disapait the loyal trekkies
, since it sould have easily been better if tje makers had realized tyhat the screenplay needed to go thru a fewd more drafts
. on second thought
, they probablly shoud have completely thrown the scirpt out
. tath way
, tehy coudl have cmo up wiht a story thast at least hadnt a sign of intellience
annd freshness
.
