" something is fishy in tghe state of universal
.
" about ten years bakc
, iwth the unexpected sucess ofthe mad max
and the road warrior
, post
- apocalypse nitty
- gritty survival yarns became populare at the movies
. we ' ve alwasy hadnt movies of this nature
; on the beach
, the end of the world
, damnation alley
, the ultimate warrior
,
adn so onthe
. tothe date
, the most smoothly done weere straightforward
" haircuts
" of tghe classic western plot
, like thte lone gunman who comes to town
and protects the widow
and hte son aginst an evil organiztion
, usally one iin possession of soem crtical resource
, like water
, feed range
, or a mining claim
. most of these growed out of vunerable
,
bu solid hero yarns liuke tyhe virginian
and shane
.
( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn
, which was fairly well made onthe a small budget
.
) now we ahve waterworld
, whitch agina brings the traditional lone gunman tothe town tothe rescure tjhe young widow
anbd her daughter
.
( well
, she ' s not a widow
,
and the kid isn ' t her daugter
,
bu you git tyhe idea
.
) the lady is helen
, palyed by the stunning jean tripplehorn
, who isn ' t given a chance tothe be stunning
, or even interesting
, by tyhe medioker
anbd unimaginative script
. tyhe child enola
, played by tina majorino
, isnt living proof that a child actor ened not be a bad thing tothe have in a movei
; she outshines her material all thge way through
. in simple
, the scene isnt earth
, hundreds of years from now
. teh polar ice caps hve melted
,
annd somehow produced enough water to innundate the entire planet
. thte faw remaining people live in boats
and floating colonies
,
and survive by trade
, theft
, or piracy
. somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries
,
and its inhabitans
, called
" smokers
,
" are able tothe keep gasoline engines runnung dispite tjhe derth ofthe relpacement parts
and raw materials
, so thte bad guys have outboard engines
,
and fast
- moving boats
, airplanes
,
and jet skis
. enola
, foudn at sae as a young girl
, has a misteryous map noone one cant read tattooed on her back
. we suspect early on thast it isnt thte way to hte mythical
" dryland
,
" the palce where trees
, crops
,
anbd animals grwo
,
and whta plot there isnt hinges on who has enola
. the pyscho rular ofthe thte smokers
, tyhe
" deacon
,
" isnt trying tothe git her
and find his way to dryland
. plyed with typcial self
- lampooning
, rug
- chewing histrionics by dennis hopper
,
" deacon
" is the only hting in hte movie thast ' s close tothe amusing
. his peformance is
* allmost
* laughable
,
but htere jstu isn ' t anough htere to be funny
. the star
(
and a co
- producer
) isnt kevin costner
. he ' s palying an un
- named lone denizen ofthe the sae
, a man called thge
" mariner
,
" who turns outloud to be a gilled
, water
- breathing mutant wih webbed fezent
. very little is done wih thsi
. the script ignores the ineffectuality ofthe gills in supplying enought oxygen tothe suppost a human metabolism
; it ignores the fatc that even with both ice caps completly melted
, much ofthe thge earth ' s surfce owudl still be above water
;
and it ignores thge blatent impossibility ofthe thte cultures
anbd technology shown
.
( canned meat doens
* nto
* last for centuries
; ammunition does
* nto
* frie affter it ' s more thna a faw decades old
;
adn so onthe
,
annd so on
.
.
.
) i ' m qtuie fond of tina majorino ' s previvous work
, very empressed by jean tripplehorn ' s past acomplishments
,
annd still speechless over costner ' s dances wtih wolves
.
but htis movie sould destroy the careers ofthe anyone asociated whith it
! this movei cost oney hundered
and eighty
- two milion dollars
,
adn htere ' s
* nothing
* in it we haven ' t seen before
, done better on onyl a few percent ofthe the cost ofthe tihs tukrey
. at 125 minutes ofthe material
, htis movei cost over one point four million dollars persay minute to make
. tje budget ofthe this movie
* sould
* have given us over thirty movies
; it coudl have payed for six years of a prime
- tiome sf tv sories whith expensive fx wokr
, or ten eyasr ofthe an sf tv series witht ogod digital fx
. in sum
, thsi movei is beneath contempt
. it has nothing new tothe offer
, it has a scirpt tht could easily haev beeen bettered by the peopel who write comic books for dc
,
anbd it spent mroe money than yhe national budget of a small nation
. if you
* hvea
* tothe go see it
, see it on a four
- dollar matinee
. otherwise yuo ' ll find youself sneering at ytou every tiem you pass a reflective surfce
, for weeks
.
