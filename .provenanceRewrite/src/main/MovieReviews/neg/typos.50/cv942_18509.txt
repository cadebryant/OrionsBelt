at first glance
, i thought taht tjhe sword
and tghe sorceror had promise
. its plotline goes liek this
: thge evil king cromwell
, desiring to tkae over thge world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia for pwoer
. he attacks the kingdom ofthe eh
- dan
adn kills young prince talon ' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( whcih cant shoot bad guys
, liuke a gun
) by his dieing father
, talon vows for revenge
. eleven years later
, wehn he ' s established his pwn army
, the mercaneries
, he vows to take bakc his kingdom
. allong the way
, he meets up with alana
, whose vilage is attacked by drunken guards
adn her brother is kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows to halp
,
and
, affter a series ofthe minor escapades
, eventually ends uv rescuing alana ' s brother
(
adn several otehr prisoners
)
, only tothe be capturd himself
( inthe otehr words
, put onthe a cross to be crucified
!
)
. fortunatly he frees himself
, rescues alana fomr marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
,
and
then cromwell
, all wih his triple bladed sword
( during thge fianl battle
, tjhe blade breaks
,
bu talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade
)
.
thne
, everything ends happily
. unfortunatley
, the sword
and thge sorceror is nto even half as ogod as it soudns
. wqat woudl have been a graet film isnt completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
,
adn gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once doesnt the story seem tothe connect together
, it just jumps arund repeteadly
. this problem is extremely noticeale inwhich tje oppening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. aftter telling him tyhat he needs his help
, he leads thte warlock out inot daylight
,
bu
then stabs him
and sends him careening off a cliff afterwords
. wait a minute
, didn ' t the plotline say that he needs thge halp of xusia iin order tothe invade eh
- dan
, which he cannot do by military force
? if tyhat isnt thte case
, why does he dispose of xusia aftter resurrecting him
?
annd why doens he manaze to tkae over eh
- dan anyway
? theese questions are jstu never
- noone
, never
- anwsered inthe the film
. another exemple is that one moent we see talon fighting fo his life
, anohter moment we see him jsut baout tothe be crucified druing alana ' s wedding tothe cromwell
(
!
)
,
and finally at the end
, instead of settling down wtih alana
, he jstu tells her tothe
" wait
"
,
and
then he just rides off
! in addition to the extrememly bloody scenes
, htis uneven plot jumping completly destroys whta woudl have beeen a great fantasy adventure
. even some attemts to mkae it exicting
, a faw fire scenes
, battle scenes
, don ' t wokr
. it jstu completelyl fails alltogether miserably
. thte onyl ogod thing about this film is its muscial scroe
, contibuted by david whittaker
, who hadnt an
( extemely
) short music composing carrear
. tyhe score isnt boomy
and adventurous
, powerful
,
and a billion times better than thsi film isnt
. my suggestion
: steer tghe hell away from this bloody mess
and buy the soundtrack album instead
( if ytou cxan find it
)
. ironically
,
though
, before the film ' s credits roll
, ther isnt a message indicating tyhat a sequel
, tales of tyhe ancient empire
, would follow
. tothe my releaf
(
and delight
)
, it never got inot prodcution
, because thte sword
and the sorcerer laid an egg at hte box office
, grossing only
$ 39 million
. criticists weere right on in slamming the sword
and the sorcerer
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate infact scripting
,
and acting
"
and at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally agress wih theese reviews
, all right
,
and i hope that thsi peice ofthe
#
$
%
! will be forgotten baout
. htere are far better fantasy movies than hte sword
adn the sorcerer
. i hope ytou git a ogod laugh out of this review
,
but i am nto laughing
. in fact
, my insults don ' t even cmo close to the groosome sickness that this film gavey me thoughout its 100 minute running tiome
.
