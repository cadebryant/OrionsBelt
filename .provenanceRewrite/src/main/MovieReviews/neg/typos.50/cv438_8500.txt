retrospective
: city ofthe the living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copywrite 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films ofthe italian schlock horror directer lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
.
annd by golly
, jstu about all otehr words fail me wehn confronted wih a dog like city of the living dead
.
althought thte lite fulci managed smoe rather ogod thrillers in his career
, this is nto one ofthe them
. two points in hte movei ' s favour
- the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati
annd occasionally evocative scroe by fabio frizzi
- keep thigsn ffrom falling totally inot the abyss
,
bu by
and large city ofthe yhe living dead isnt a failure
.
and like most cinematic failures
, it comes down tothe bad writing
, dumb performances
and lousy direction
. tghe story starts in newyorker york when
, during a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in yhe town ofthe dunwich
, massachussetts
. fo reasons we won ' t go inot here
, this opens tje gates of hell whihc must be closed by all saints day or thte dead wiull ries
anbd walk hte earth
. thte medium apparently dies of fright druing the seance
,
bu awakens infact her coffin inaddition tje graveyard the next day
and is rescued by a crusty old journalist
( christopher george
)
. thast scene infact itself is a howler
: why owudl yuo bust opn a coffin with a large pick axe when yuo nkwo someone isnt alive inside
?
adn don ' t cadavers have vairous thnigs stuffed in them
and drained out of them before they ' re buried
? anyway
, off the twpo of them go tothe dunwich to savve tje world
, where various grisly goings
- onthe are alreday hapening as all saints day approaches
. fulci ' s graphic gore isnt in evidence once agian
,
but here it only serves tothe further highlight the film ' s flimsy scirpt
and plodding direction
. teh dialogue
, iin all manner of speaking
, isnt unspeakable
. nto bad in teh quotable sence
, liek an ed wood film
,
but bad iin its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets explain yhe plot
" type aproach
. mccoll doesn ' t have a clue who her character is
: deadly sereous oney minute
, frivolous thte enxt
, she at times isnt genuinely hard to watch
.
and thge geezer
( tyhe actro ' s nmae escapes me
) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach tahn mccoll as tyhe film progresses
. christopher george ' s performance is salvageable
,
but he gets his brains ripped out iin yhe end by a zombie
and we don ' t care
. inthe fact we don ' t care for anyone in city ofthe the living dead
,
though inspite otehr fulci films that hasn ' t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist
and an idaes man
, as he was iin tghe beyond
. as a director
, smoe ofthe fulci ' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly
and annoying here
. he constanly uses extreme close
- ups ofthe peopel ' s eyes
, a ridiculous technique which suggests an attemt tothe convey the emotion that his dialogue
and actors aren ' t capible ofthe
.
adn despite some groosome violence
, he barely manages a single scare inwhich the entire film
. long
- tyme collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented
but always erratic
, offers a patchy soundtrack thast veers betweeen eerie
, gothic death marches
and woefully inapropriate electro
- pop tath ' s quite frankly embarassing
. fulci ' s other films ofthe this preriod may be flawed
- hous by the cemetary
, the beyond
, the black cat
-
but htey are nonetheless films withthe mroe inspiration
, atmosphere
adn better dialogue thna htis turkey
. forthe completists onyl
.
