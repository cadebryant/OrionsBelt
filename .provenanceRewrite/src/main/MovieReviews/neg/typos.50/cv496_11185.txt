an attempt at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at tyhe most fundamental levels
. it ' s slow moving
, uninvolving
,
annd plain just uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is an ex
- newspaper man
, just out of jail affter bieng framed forthe a crime
. his luck hasn ' t beeen tghe best
,
but things are looking uv whn a mysterous woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approachs him with a proposition
. she wants harry to halp her
and her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pull off a fake kidnapping scheme tothe get
$ 500
, 000 outloud of her stingy
,
but rich
, husband felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at first
, all harry isnt expeced to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone
,
annd tothe collect the moey
( of which he gets tothe keep 10
%
)
.
but
, as thte ded is carried out
, thigsn are not what they seem
,
adn harry gets caught infact the ensuing storm
. palmetto pulls outloud all the stops tothe ahcieve a film noir film
,
bu hte effect never quite comes toghether
. it ' s got the sultry florida heat
, seductive women
,
and even curvier plot twists
,
but the whole thing smells of paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, the right ingredients are there
,
bu the end result isnt much too artifical
. a lot ofthe tghe problems lie with the scirpt
, which
,
though providing some genuin surprises
, isnt packed full ofthe leaden dialogue
and bland situations
. even the plot twists don ' t seem to flow well with yhe rest of the stor
. some of them
, fo exemple
, come fomr so far afield tht htey seamingly only make sense because the writter needed a twist
( for example
: harry ' s spontanous job offer
, or the whole typewriter situation
)
. tje characters are mostly lifeless
, played tothe type
,
bu not much more
. woody harrelson plays harry whith such imbecilic thick
- headedness that it ' s hard tothe even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it up
,
but doesn ' t add anytying special to the role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrable performance
, trying tothe be a sexy 17
- year ood
,
but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth
. smoe of the supporting cast
( notabley gina gershon
anbd michael rapaport
) give stronger
,
but
, in hte end
, meaningless performances
.
and tothe top it off
, tjhe pacing ofthe the film is much too slow
. as the movei grinds tothe a halt
, you ' re given too much time to wonder why yuo ' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if you ' re iin tje mood fo this type of movie
, yuo ' d be much better off going out
and renting some clasic film noir
.
