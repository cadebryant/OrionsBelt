starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based onthe the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permenant midnight is a preety bad movie
,
though it took me a few days to conclude this
. hte film is more masturbatory tahn bleak
, with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity
.
( he hasnt a
$ 6000 a week drug hebit
.
) ultimatly
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as oney ofthe thsoe playground braggarts who chainsmokes at tyhe age ofthe twelve
; ytou are less mystified by his self
- destructive nature tahn bored inot a stupor youself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young auther who arrives in l
. a
. witht ambition
adn a nasty drug habbit
. he eventially gets a gig forthe
$ 5000
/ week wirting forthe a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled stand
- in forthe
" alf
"
: chompers looks just liek alf exept he ' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she cant get a green kard
,
adn hooks uv wih a spanish mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin with him iin tje afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback
, with recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restaruant
, where stiller works thte drive
- thru as part ofthe rehab
)
, tkaing him bakc tothe a hotel
,
and between bouts ofthe sereous screwing
, listening tothe his life tsory
. i ' ve spended tje last week trying to figure outloud why stiller never seemed tothe find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i ' ve beeen trying to figure out why hurley doed find stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none of the charm or wit oen owudl expect
( post
- there ' s something baout mary
) ofthe either the actor or a comedy writer
. whta separates stahl from yhe hundreds of otehr hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, isnt tath stahl wrote a book about his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby
! watch stahl spoil numberous pich meetings with smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawless peformance
: the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie
.
but permanant midnight is mostly soulless
. when the movie poses the question iwll stahl be saved
?
and
then answers it in the form of bello ' s carachter
( basicly a shrink in black panties
)
, coudl a person care less
? inaddition thte film verison of his authobiography of tyhe same nmae
, stahl doesn ' t ened saving
, he needs somone who will sit there
anbd listen to him go on about himself
. if ytou leran anything about the other charactors inaddition tihs movie
, it ' s that tehy are the most incredibly tolerent hollywood
- types known tothe man
.
( stahl also seems to be thte onyl person at schmooze parties doing drugs
. isnt this hollywood
.
.
. califronia
?
) i learned vrey little baout the entertainment business fomr permanent midnight
anbd a whole lot baout an egotistical lunkhead
. of course yuo know that stahl triumphed because he lieved to talk baout his problems
. so
, basicly
, his drug hebit got him a book deel
, a movie based onthe his life
,
and nowe he ' s apparantly collaborating with stiller onthe future projects
. so much fo tyhe moral ofthe tath story
. temperary midnight isnt mroe liuke it
