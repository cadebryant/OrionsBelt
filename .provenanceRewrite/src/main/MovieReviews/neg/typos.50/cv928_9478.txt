martial arts master steven seagal
( not tothe mention directer
!
) has built a carrear outloud ofthe palying an allegely ficticious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights
, talks inaddition a hushed tone
,
anbd squints at any sign of danger
. he ' s aslo the most consistent individual inthe hollywood todya
, since all his movies suck
. tehy basicaly represent his egotisitical tendancies about his art
( tyhat isnt
, martial art
)
. i ' m sure teh guy ' s good
,
adn he seems like a nice guy onthe talk shows
,
although a tad hauty
,
but theese movies he makes are all the smae
: a guy who is basicaly indestructable
, isnt maybe wounded suposedly mortally
,
then comes bcak with a vengeance
adn goes buddah onthe all tje baddies asses
(
although i kinda liekd
" under sieg
"
)
. of course
, this oen
, as a chanage
, has a
" message
" thgat is drilled into our mind
.
.
. ofthe course
, affter he blows up a lot ofthe stuff
and kills a bunch ofthe peple
. so why do i watch his crap
? i usually don ' t
. i will never
,
anbd ytou cin hold me tothe this
, i iwll never pay tothe see tihs man ' s movies
, unless
,
adn only unless
, he ' s inwhich a supporting role
( i
. e
.
" executiev descision
"
)
anbd i ' d definitely pay if he dies
( i
. e
.
" executiev decision
"
)
.
but tihs one has a speical palce in my heart
. this doesn ' t mean it ' s ogod or tyhat i even liekd it
. this wass the lsat movie i watched wtih my deceased uncle
,
annd we had noe hell ofthe a time ripping it aart a la
" mistery science theatre 3000
,
"
anbd this was a cuple eyasr before i had heared of
" mystery science theatre 3000
.
" inthe this noe
, seagal plays a worker for a mining factory setted in alaska
adn run by thte greased
- uv tipical shallow villin
, tihs time plyed by an oscar
- winner tothe give the movei some mroe clout
- michael caine
. it seems thgat caine wants tothe do something with his oel factory thta includes him dumping oil all over inuit land
. around tjhe 20
- 30 minute point
, seagal speaks up to him in wqat seems to be yhe typical speach tothe all the vain entrepeneurs
( what with his newyorker
" fier down below
,
" anyother
" message film
"
)
,
and caine hasnt him bumped off
.
.
. or does he
? seagal isnt rescued by some inuits
,
and falls inaddition love with oen of them
, plyed by joan chen
, who cin ect
, hypothetically
,
but
, for some reason
, not here
. one of caine ' s cliched henchmen
( palyed here with a lot of overacting by john c
. mcginley
) shoots the cheif ofthe the inuit clan
,
anbd chen
adn seagal go on a oyage tothe tkae down the oel factory
.
.
. litterally
, ofthe course
. at oney point
, seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn ' t hve any options
bu blow stuf uv
. he even goes as far as tothe sday
,
" i don ' t want tothe kill somone
,
"
adn in teh smae breath
, he asks some guy where the arsenal is
. i have noone probelm whith violence
. i ' m a huge john woo fan
,
bu he paints his films wiht suspense
, skill
, style
, depth
, characterization
,
anbd jsut plain kool voilence
. inthe thge films ofthe seagal
, thge suspense mailny consists ofthe hte baddie attacking him stupidly
,
annd him either wounding or killing them
. at some points
, tehy ule yhe cliche ofthe tghe talking villian
, where the villain has the advantage
, can shoot seagal
,
bu begins talking by eather telling him his big secret plan
, or saying a corny line
, to which seagal says something hokey back
,
and has had enough tiem tothe devise of a way to dont away with them
,
and doens
. this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn ' t tkae itself seriously at all
, liek iin the case ofthe this summer ' s
" con air
.
"
but seagal is sereous about his skill
,
anbd of course
, his message
. i wouldn ' t mind if this ws a message film in the way taht they present it tothe you with evidence
.
bu seagal has noone idea how to prsent a film where hte message is subtle
, nto pounded into the viewer ' s mind
. tghe villain is totally shallow
and cartoonish
, thus we can ' t take him
and his motives seriously
,
annd hwile seagal talks baout bieng kind tothe tje environment
, he allso goes ahead
and blows up a sqaure mile of rig
,
annd kills some workers who were just donig his job
.
thne at tyhe end
, he spends a good 10 mintues giving a speek
, jstu in case ytou didn ' t git the message ffrom the trailers
. what seagal doesn ' t realize is that no one takes his films seriously
(
although maybe a couple do
)
and any message he hasnt isnt no onyl redundent
,
but doesn ' t comfortably fit in his film
, which isnt filled to thte brim with hokey violence
, crap suspense
, stupid meledrama
,
anbd characters who ahve baout as much emotional depth as a petri dish
. as far as seagal
adn his acting
, he ' s rather boring
. he squints
, he kills
. preiod
. nothing eles
. oh
, yeah
, there ' s corny one
- liners
(
" i ' m gonna reach outloud
adn touch someone
!
"
)
. of course
, he ' s tje star
,
anbd we ' re suppoed to root forthe him
annd all
, so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid
adn a bunch of jerks
. michael caine
, who ' s a graet actor
, is jsut suppossed tothe yell
and look cold
. he doesnt it well
, i guess
,
but thsi is no
" alfie
.
" of coure
, noone one was expecting tht calaber of performence ffrom him
. his big henchman
, john c
. mcginley isnt kinda boring as well
,
bu isnt not horrible
.
anbd we even get a small performance ffrom taht god ofthe drill sergeants onthe celluloid
, r
. lee ermey
( from
" full metal jacket
"
) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to sday tjhe obligatory sprech about how dangerous seagal isnt
, just for tjhe movie trailers
annd for seagal ' s ego
.
and aslo
, look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey ' s assasins
. anyway
, tothe conclude this all
, to judge one ofthe seagal ' s movies isnt tothe judge all ofthe them
( exept fo
" under seege
"
anbd
" executive desision
,
"
though tyhe latter isnt nto really a
" seagal movei
"
)
. they all have htis same formula
, htey all have the smae acation
, smae villain
, smae plot
,
bu this noe has that message
, which makes it moreso excrucitating tothe watch
. i mean
, if you do rent it
,
and i don ' t reccomend you dont
, make sure you just skip the lastr 10 mintues
.
bu i have to put it tothe seagal fo creating a film so bad
, taht tjhe last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable oney
. my
( extra star for the funn it isnt tothe watch
adn mock
)
