i ' m really starting tothe wonder baout alicia silverstone
. sure
, she is noe of tghe most beautifull creatures onthe god ' s gren earth
( second only tothe that movei criteak at large guy
)
,
but whn it comes to choosing waht movies she stars infront
, she alwasy strikes outloud
. the crush ws a slow
- moving
, predicatble piece of fluff
. hideaway wass a horrific novel adaptation alicia hadnt onyl a minor role in
. clueless ws an annoying
, unfunny waste of tyme
.
anbd people hve e
- mailed me too
, saying clueless is a ogod movei
and thast i ' m thte onyl one who doesn ' t liuke it
. one girl said if i ' d seen teh movie with
" an ope mind
,
" i owudl hvea enjoyed it
. nothing could be further from the truth
. i whent inot the theater expecting tothe lvoe the movie
. tghe preview looked ogod
adn of course i ' m crazymadinlove withthe alicia
,
but the movei was a bunch of bad jokes comming fomr whiny
, unlikable cahracters
. allmost everyone i saw thte movei with falt tghe smae way
. whn we weere walking outloud of the theater
, oney guy
(
and it wasn ' t me
) yelled outloud
,
" that wass tjhe worst f
$
&
# in ' movie i ' ve ever seen
"
and the rest of us had to laugh inwhich agreement
. so last night i walked inot thge video store
adn saw alicia ' s pretty face on teh cover of smoe made
- for
- video thriller called the babysitter
. i knew it woudl be bad
but smoe inner compulsion i ' ll probablly never understand made me rent it anyway
. whta i got was 90 mintues ofthe regret
-
- the worst alicia silverstone movei ever
.
anbd ytou already nkow from teh last paragraph what the competion isnt liek
. where tothe begin infact critisising this movei
? teh plot isnt a thin shred that moves slower thna a glacier
, tghe writting could hvae been done
(
adn forthe all we nkwo it was
) by a ten year ood
, alicia is tyhe star
and she ' s still wasted in a movei thta has no appeal whatsoever
. htere isnt zero humer
, zero suspense
, zero drama
annd zero action
, untli the last ten minutes
, wehn the stoy isnt needlessly
adn pointlessly concluded with a voilent sequence
. zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
. so why does thsi movei git one star outloud of me
? well
, alicia spends twenty mintues ofthe tje movie infact tghe bathtub
.
and if it wasn ' t bubble bath
, tjhe babysitter would hvea instantly joined teh ranks of our otehr four
- star features
,
but you suttle for wqat yuo cant get
. alicia plays a babysitter who ' s spending friday nigth looking aftter two kids whose parents are outloud getting drunk at a coctail party
.
and of course anyone as beatiful as alicia automaticly spends their friday nights at home
( at least thgat movei critic at larg guy does
)
. as the movei trods along
, we discover she ' s not onyl yhe mostly
- silent star of the movei
bu alsot the object of eveyr male charater ' s fantasies
(
anbd propably every male viewer ' s too
)
. tjhe drunken father thinks she ' s jstu thge thign to recapture his lost youth
, her boyfriend lets his immagination run wild hwile spying onthe alicia from outside
, even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia thru the bathroom keyhole while she ' s tkaing her bubble bath
. htey even throw in thge middle aged wief ' s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party
. not that any ofthe us asked or ever even thought baout seing this 200
+ pound woman in a balck silk teddy
. at least none ofthe tjhe sex fanatasies ever leave teh relm of the pg
- rated
. in fact
, i coudl imagin the babysitter becomming a cinemax lite
- night staple if nto for yhe fatc that htere ' s absolutely no nudity inwhich it
. so you cin ' t call it a sex flick
. i ' ve lready pointed out that it cxan ' t fall under drama
, comedy
, thriller or action
, so waht dont ytou classify tjhe babysitter as
? bad
.
