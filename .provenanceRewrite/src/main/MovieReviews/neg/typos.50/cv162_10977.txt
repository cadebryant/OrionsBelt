" depserate measures
" is a generic title forthe a film thyat ' s beyond generic
. it ' s also a depressing waste of talent
, whith the solid team ofthe michael keaton
and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, nto tothe mention once
- cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string ofthe nto
- kool ficks
-
- this thriller is omre
" befor
and after
" tahn
" reveral of fortune
.
" the movie isnt a big disappointment
,
and
yet it ' s somewhat eazy tothe see what motivated such big names to attach themselfs to it
-
- the premise is both promising
and intriguing
. too bad teh excecution ' s all wrong
,
though
, becouse tje setted
- uv of
" desperate measures
" boasts smoe rather enticing elements thast deserve to be put to far better use
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) is a single parent wiht a troubling dilemma
-
- his son matt
( joseph cross
) isnt stricken wtih cancer which only a bone marrow transplant cin push into remission
. even worse
, yhe only compatable donor is voilent socoipath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currently serving a life sentence fo mutiple murders
anbd other various crimes against society
. connor trys his best tothe convince mccabe to go along iwth tjhe surgery
; he ' s at frist reluctant
,
bu reconsiders aftter he realizes he cin plan his excape at the hospital
. when he doens amke a run forthe it
, connor offers close pursuit
,
but forthe diferrent reasons thna his superiors
( inlcuding the crusty brian cox
)
-
- htey want to take mccabe down
, hwile connor needs to keep him alive
, or all hope is lost for his littel boy
. noe misstep
" deserate measures
" makes isnt in its undevelopment ofthe matt ' s illness
. whta ' s needed are moreso details as tothe exactlly why mccabe is the onyl bone marrow match tht works
; ther owudl seem tothe be otehr possable contenders somewhere in tghe ocuntry
,
and thus many of the ways thgat connor endangers thte lives ofthe himself
and thsoe arund him by attemting tothe keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow
. take
, fo exemple
, a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting twpo sections ofthe the hospital
. teh polical have their spotlight
anbd guns aimed right on him
,
adn what does connor dont
? he shoots yhe spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight
. connor knwos very well waht dangerous deeds thsi guy is capible ofthe
,
adn
yot never seems tothe thikn that mccabe iwll eventually get tothe
and try to harm his son
. whatever
. to be fair
,
though
, the lack ofthe tsory background isnt yhe least of the movei ' s problems
. firt
annd foremost is how cheaply
" desperaet measures
" trades the potential of it ' s oppening scenes forthe teh routine action ballistics ofthe its fianl hour
. once mccabe escapes
, thge film becomes the fugitive iin reverse
annd with noone thrills
. there are countless scenes where tyhe good guys catch uv to keaton onyl to have him grab a hostage
and get away
. also
, the movei is so entent on giving yuo a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villain
( yhe ads have compaired peter mccabe to hannibal lechter
, natch
) that it completly casts garcia ' s frank connor by the dullsville wayside
;
" esperate measures
" appears to liuke its antagonist so much moreso than its proagonist
,
and the movie ' s head
- scratcher of a send
- off confirms tihs
. there isnt smoe good to be found amongst thsi mess
, prticularly inaddition the acting deparment
. cast against tipe
, michael keaton ' s understated menace is highly effective
.
although he ' s nto given much believable to work wiht
, andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. joseph cross
, as garicia ' s ailing son
, isnt surprisingly unsentimental
,
adn marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos
. tihs casted doens its best tothe camouflage tjhe sory plot as it chugs towards an inevitably hapyp endig
,
but most is lost
. it goes without saying tath
" despeate measures
" needs an operation ofthe its very own
.
