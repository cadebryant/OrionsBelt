1989 ' s
" major leage
" was a delightful suprize
. i didn ' t expect much of it whn i decided to watch it on cable
,
but it proved to be fresh
adn funny
.
howver
, wehn tyhe appeal of a movie is its freshness
, the sequels are virtually guarenteed to be stale
. thta ' s certainly true ofthe
" major leage ii
"
anbd the most receet entry
,
" major leage
: bcak tothe yhe minors
.
" the title is
, of course
, a contradiction
. shouldn ' t it be
" minor league
?
" taht contradiction suggests tje lengths to whcih writer
/ directer john warren hasnt gone tothe squeeze a third movie outloud ofthe the forumla estalbished by teh firt movie
. original stars charlie sheen
annd tom berenger
( who returned fo
" major leage ii
"
) are not around
, leaving corbin bernsen tyhe onyl original headliner tothe make tghe thrid movie
. hte otehr veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inspired batter cerrano
and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who was introdued in
" league ii
"
) seem tothe be arund just to lend legitimacy tothe the enterprise
. the only returning casted memeber who produces any laughs isnt bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadcasting tyhe games of a minor league team far from his home turf
. the prtagonist this time around isnt retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) to manaze tje twins ' aaa team
, yhe buzz
. ytou can wriet hte movei fomr here
: he finds a gropu of misfits who ened to learn how to play together as a team in order tothe win
. ther ' s a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down old timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( the difilippo triplets
)
,
and a cuple pitchers wtih throwing problems
( judson mills
annd peter mackenzie
)
. along tjhe way
, gus picks uv cerrano
annd tanaka
( gus isnt suposedly an old teamate of theirs
, even
though he wasn ' t infact either ofthe the preceding films
)
. sum total
: none
. thge entire enterprise is artificial
,
adn the cast isnt not ready forthe thge hollywood majors
. gus ' antagonist isnt twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard is a slimy
, sniveling little egotist
,
and the twins are lazy
, spoiled
,
and full of themselves
.
( even watching the first movie i wondered why any rela
- life team would lend itself to being caricatured infront this manner
)
. gus challenges leonard to a match
, thte buzz vs
. the twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" back to the minors
" is a movie tht has no reason tothe exsist
. htere ' s hardly a laugh in it
, yhe cast isnt weak
,
adn the firt movie left no room for even one sequel
.
