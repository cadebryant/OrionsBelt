ugh
. thta about sums thsi movie up
. jsut
, ugh
. tje original godzilla movies are somewhat ofthe a cult clasic
,
and when reviewing the previous films
, each film had a certain degree of intelligence
.
and tath wass thte reason they found such an enviable cult folowing
; inspite spite ofthe bad special effects
, horrable dubbing
,
and a man in a lizard suit
, they mantained a certian degree of
.
.
. how tothe put htis
?
.
.
. dignity
? nto qutie the owrd i ' m looking forthe
. you understand
, right
?
annd inspite 50 eyasr
, godzilla hasnt mantained that degree of ' whatever '
. leave it to amercia to screw the hwole thign uv
.
> fomr tghe ' geniouses ' that brought us
" independece day
"
, argubly the worst sci
- fi movei of all time
, tothe ruin whatever reputation godzilla hadnt
. hwile they do bring us eye
- popping spacial effects that iwll amaze ytou
, they lost wqat ws at yhe center ofthe all thge origonal godzilla movies
-
- a storyline
. summing up the movei is simple
. heck
, i cxan dont it in noe sentence
: giant lizard attacks a giant city
anbd a bunch of nobodies stpo it
. simple as that
. matthew broderick stumbles over his lines
,
anbd it ' s hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog
- walking carachter onthe the television show
" mad about yuo
"
. the dialogue seems tothe be improvized
, almsot as if htere was noone rehearsel done at all
. i cin see tje scene on thge setted right now
.
" all right
! we spended all ofthe tihs money making big speical effects
,
and we ' ve gotta get htis movie outloud by summer or it ' s oging to bomb in our faces
. so
, you actors jstu sday what ever comes tothe thge top of your head
, all right
? make up something
, m ' kay
? ogod
. roll film
!
!
" hte speical effects are enought tothe keep ytou interseted thru oney viewing
,
annd soem of the cinemtography isnt well
- done
( tje scene with the black umbrellas comes tothe mind
)
. still
, an hour into it
, you will become antsy
, wondering how long they cant drag it outloud
.
adn drag it out they do
!
! i hvea tothe laff
. the slogan for tyhe film is
,
" size does marter
"
. i htikn htey cutted thsi too short
. it should read
,
" size doesnt marter
. acting doens nto
.
