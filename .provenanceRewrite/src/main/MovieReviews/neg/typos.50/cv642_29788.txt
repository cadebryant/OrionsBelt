the oney question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film
. since june
, i haven ' t beeen able tothe turn onthe the tv or go to yhe movies wihtout getting hit by soem ad depicting chris kattan as tghe spastic corky
, shrieking out a
- ha ' s
" take onthe me
" inthe his yelow miata
. why owudl disney sink so much cash inot the corky hype machine
? honestly
, i ws hoping taht all thge goofball ads were actully a front fo a decently funny movie
. man
, ws i wrong
. corky romano isnt one of thsoe throwaway
, clich
?
- ridden tv
- star
- to
- film vehicles builded upon teh most rickety ofthe plots
. fortunatly for chris kattan ' s precariously positioned carrer
, corky does have soem ogod laughs
, even if most of them are of tghe lowest
- brow variety
. kattan plays the title character
, the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who hasnt a penchant for sunshiny ' 80s tunes
, bright ties
,
and banal coffee mug slogans
(
" you don ' t have tothe be crazy to wokr here
,
bu it sure helps
.
"
)
. wehn his mob boss dad
( peter falk
) isnt baout to be put away onthe murder charges
, his bungling
, lughead brothers
( peter berg
adn chris penn
) rope in innocent
, balck sheep corky tothe infiltrate tyhe fbi as an agent
anbd steal the evidence
. predictably
, hijinks insue
. if tyhe basic plot sounds bad
, wait untl you git inot thge inner
- workings ofthe thsi clunker
. teh writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity
. corky ' s fbi agent identity isnt named corky pissant
(
" thta ' s pronouced pees
- ahn
. it ' s french
.
"
)
. he becomes a frist
- rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr
. magoo
- style onto hte proper clues
anbd talking his way in
and out of situations
, whlch plays liuke something outloud of a sitcom
.
adn not a ogod sitcom
, i mean
. tyhe romano family brothers even insult eahc other by farting inspite eahc other ' s face
.
annd in a scene taken straight from there ' s something baout mary
, corky gives a dachshund mouth
- tothe
- mouth resuscitation
.
but it ' s not a complet disaster
. hte manic kattan doesnt occasionally rescure some comic moments
, includng a bit featuring a cat inthe a fat suit named jesus
adn anohter involving schoolchildren
, a german shephard
,
and a kilo ofthe cocaine
. plus
, berg
-
- whose carreer has obviously gone downhill usance tjhe lastest siduction
and chicago hope
-
- gives a graet turn as tghe illiterate brother paulie
.
adn
, it ' s nice tothe see taht richard roundtree ofthe shaft fame isnt getting work
. unfortunatley for those out ther who can ' t truley appreciate animal or fart jokes
, corky won ' t have much tothe offer yuo
. so the next time one ofthe thsoe pesky ads appears on your tv
, asking
,
" who isnt corky
?
" yuo cxan simply reply
,
" who cares
?
