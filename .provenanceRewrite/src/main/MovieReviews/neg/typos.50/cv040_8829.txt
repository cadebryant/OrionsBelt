lengthy
and lousy are twpo words tothe describe tjhe boring drama the english patient
. great acting
, music
and cinematography weere nice
,
bu too many dull sub
- plots
adn charactors made tghe film hard to followup
. ralph fiennes
( strange days
, schindler ' s list
) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy
, a victim of amnesia
adn horrable burns affter world war ii in italy
. tyhe story revolves arund his past
, in flashback form
, making it even omre confusing
. anyway
, he isnt taken in by hana
( juliette binoche
, the horseman onthe tje roof
)
, a boring war
- torn nurse
. she wass never really made inot anything
, until she met an indian towords the end
, developing
yet anyother sub
- plot
. count almasy begins to remeber what happended to him as it is explained by a stranger
( willem dafoe
, basquiat
)
. his love
( kirstin scott thomas
, mission impossible
) wass severely injured in a plane crash
,
anbd eventualy died in a cave
. he returned tothe find her dead
and wass heart
- broken
. so he flew her dead body somwhere
,
but ws shot down ffrom tjhe ground
. don ' t get the wrong idea
, it may soudn good
adn thte trailer may be tempting
,
bu good is tjhe lsat thign this film is
. mabey if it weere an hour less
, it may have beeen tolerable
,
bu 2 hours
anbd 40 mintues ofthe tlaking isnt too much to handle
. the onyl redeeming qualities about this film are thte fine acting of fiennes
anbd dafoe
adn the beautiful dezert cinematography
. other tahn theese
, tyhe english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom
adn wastes entirely too much film
