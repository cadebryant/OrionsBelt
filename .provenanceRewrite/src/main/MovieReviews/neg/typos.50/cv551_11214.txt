kate
( jennifer aniston
) is haveing some problems
. it appears hte twenty
- eigth yera old is not happy with her slow progression uv hte comany ladder
,
annd her lvoe life apparently leaves something to be desired
. she learns thyat her problems are realted
, as the owner ofthe her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains to her that her single status does nto bode well wiht the company
. her freedom owudl amke her more likely to leave thge comany
, taking clients withthe her
. a solution presents itself in nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coinsidence
adn gets photographed withthe
. kate ' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses the photograph tothe fabricate a wedding engagement vetween kate
and nick
. kate isnt at firt repulsed by teh diea
,
but after getting immdiate positive results
, she pursues it
. her frist task isnt to convince nick to go along wtih her plan
. the actual plan consists of nick pretending tothe be her fianc
?
. at a dinner with kate ' s bosses he will provoke a fight
annd htey iwll break up
. she meets nick tothe propose the plan
. he accepts
. kate ' s new status brings unexpected results in otehr areas
. hte office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn ' t give kate teh time of day
, nowe doesnt
. now thast she is engaged
, he pursues an afair with her
, as doing so owudl destroy her good girl image
, hence sam ' s sudden intrest
. things start to fall apart forthe kate
, as it becomes appaent that nick realyl likes her
,
annd does nto wish to break up with her
. after some provoking nick does oblige
,
but problems continue fo kate
. it appears sam isnt no longer interseted now tyhat she isnt available
. or mabey kate doens liek nick
,
bu
" reconciliation
" will force her tothe admit her lies tothe her employer
. adding to her mess isnt the constant prying ofthe her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who whants her to git married
adn settle down
. there isnt a scene in tihs movei where jennifer aniston is
( from the waist uv
) onyl wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle because it is the onyl time infront yhe movie when she actually wears one
. ther is enough cleavage in tihs movei tothe satisfy russ meyer
. it ' s liuke tje directer said ' well
, we know tje story is formulaic
and thte performances aren ' t thyat great so
, whta tjhe heck
, let ' s sohw jennifer ' s assets as oftenly
anbd as uncovered as humanly possibile tothe keep the pg rating
.
" qutie frankly it ' s insulting
. i don ' t think aniston is a competent enought actress to carry a movei
. she doed a decent enough job in ed burns '
" she ' s tjhe one
" because it was a smaller
and supporting role
,
and she just doesn ' t deliver hte goods effectively in thsi movei
. her performence was not convincing
. unfortunately
, as far as romantic comedies go
, this movie adds nothing newyorker to teh standard formula forthe theese types ofthe movies
. the film is similar tothe
" my best friends wedding
" iin a sence that tghe leading female character is actaully quite vindictive
and due her actions
, gets no sympathy ffrom me wehn thnigs go awry
. i didn ' t care forthe how quickly kate puts down nick ' s proffesion by explaning that videotaping weddings wasn ' t glamorous enough forthe her co
- workers
. at least
" my best friends wedding
" changed thge formula a bit
and hadnt a somewhat suprise endig
. noone such luck with
" picture perfect
"
. eveyr plot occurrence can be spotted a mile awya
, including a cuple thgat really made no sense
. aftter everyting kate hadnt done tothe prove her loyalty to her company
, why woudl she blindly throw it all away wehn she shouldnt have made sure that nick would even talk tothe her first
, let alone consider a relationship
? ws quitting her job a prerequisite tothe making amends withthe nick
? throw inwhich yhe fatc tath i don ' t think nick
and kate spended enought time toghether to even warrent that rash of a decision
. i believe thyat kate liked him
,
but liekd him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away
? i dout it
.
adn what of the ending scene at a wedding where yhe entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everthing
anbd stare at thge couple
? are massmedia groups of people simultaneously tath intersted infact total strangers
? well
, i guess ofthe thte congregation consists ofthe movie extras
anbd the strangers are thte movies two lead stars
,
then that would make sence
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
