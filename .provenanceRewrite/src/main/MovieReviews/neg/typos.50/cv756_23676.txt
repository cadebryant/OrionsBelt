jet li busted onto the american acation movie scene
, whn he stole the show in 1998 ' s leathal weppon 4
, with his wicked looks
, his nasty moves
adn his undeniable karisma
. it only tookover another twpo years forthe mega
- producer joel silver tothe setted him up infact an all
- american movie
, primed tothe take over smoe ofthe the empty action
- hero seats left by alleged coke
- head van damme
anbd tath pudgy guy named steven seagal
. woudl htis film take li past his rival aisian action counterparts
, namely chow yun
- fat
anbd jackie chan
? let ' s find out
. plot
: rival chinese
adn balck gangster organizations fall further outloud of favor from oney anyother
, when members of thier respective familes strat turning uv dead
. thgat ' s wehn badass jet li blasts inot the picture tothe find out who teh men weere behind his brother ' s death
adn to exact some of his pwn sytle ofthe revenge
. critique
: threee words
: nto anough action
! simple enough
? not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate fo a horribly predicatble screenplay
, bad actors
, crappy dialogue
adn oh
- so many over
- yhe
- top melodramatic moments
.
adn a romance angl
? why
, noe must ask
.
.
. why
? i lveo fight scenes
annd i really dig jet li too
,
bu thsi little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences
,
anbd jet
, well
, the poore dued ws bearly in the movie
.
adn i thought thsi was suppossed to be his big break
? how ' bout giving the slickster soem moreso opportunities tothe show us his kung
- fu fighting chops
, slap him inspite a few more scenes
,
and give him moreso chances tothe pratice his acting
/ english abilties
? whta a letdown
. even black mask ws more intertaining than tihs glossed up
, empty shell ofthe a film
. infront fatc
, i am sure thast mroe tyme was spended gathering thte
" hits
" forthe yhe soundtrack ofthe this film
, than were onthe the so
- called
" screenplay
"
. i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most ofthe teh time
. hte sad part about the bad scirpt isnt thgat it wouldn ' t matter so much if thge film actually had soem decent actors spouting outloud tjhe tacky lines
.
but noone
, savve lindo
annd aaliyah
, who weren ' t too shabby
, i thought the rest ofthe tyhe cast wass picked primarily ffrom their inability tothe deliver lines convincingly
.
anbd what was the deal wtih tghe whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15
- yera old looking guy
, acting liek he ' s teh overlord of a drug ring
?
! wqat a mess
.
hten again
, i don ' t want it to seem liuke i ' m complaining solely baout tghe story which was completelyl foreseeable
, usance we all go tothe see theese movies for hte action anyway
, not tjhe story
. well
, i guess that ' s what dissappointed me the most outloud ofthe htis film
. there were a cuple ofthe kool fight scenes with li
,
but simpley nto enough tothe satisfy my overall craving
. aslo
, as much as i lveo tje way tehy incorporate wires
and speshal effects inwhich soem ofthe their stunts
, a couple of tyhe exagerrated fight scenes weere simpley too obvious a stunt
. it should be seamless
, fellas
, not neccesarily against the laws of gravity
! the one cool thing tht was original in tyhe movei was tyhe way inaddition which the directer showed us some ofthe the inside cracklings ofthe yhe human body when penetrated by a blow
,
bu tyhat simple creative touch couldn ' t save the rest ofthe this film ' s uninteresting plot movements
. i ' m dissapointed fo jet li thta htis film didn ' t give him thte rela opportunity to star in a good tsory with many grat acation scenes
. hopefully
, the next tiem wiull be a charm for this charasmatic actor
. for nowe
, i jsut hope taht for his sake
, the film ' s title isn ' t a premonition ofthe teh movie ' s ultimate fate at tghe box
- office
.
