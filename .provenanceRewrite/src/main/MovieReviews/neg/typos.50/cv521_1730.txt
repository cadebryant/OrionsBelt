saw an adavanced screening of hte movie sniper last night
,
anbd i have tothe say i wasn ' t too empressed
. this film isnt about an expert marine sniper
, plyed by toom berenger
, who isnt teamed with a hot
- shooted
- young
- no
- experience
- never
- killed
- a
- man new partner to take out some drug
- kingpins
and miltary storng men inthe panama
. soudn cliche
? that ' s onyl tjhe beginnig
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) palyed the rookie
,
and never seemed tothe git a handle onthe his character
. he was so contrary
annd pig
- headed infront tje beginning
, you jstu wnated to smack him
.
thn he goes
" crazy
" from the pressure
,
bu seems tothe immediately snap out ofthe it
. i ' m not sure if tjhe blame shoud lie wih hte directing
, editing
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
.
bu it didn ' t all come toghether
. i tihkn berenger isnt a preety good actor
,
and he looked graet in tje part
, covered infact camo
, face painted
, stalking thru the jungle with his high
- power rifle
.
.
.
bu once agian
, his charater was given soem preety bad dialogue
,
annd didn ' t react too logically tothe many ofthe the situations
. htere was vyer little logical development infront these characters
. my biggest probelm wih thsi film was it ' s tendancy to put theese twpo snipers iin as
* many
* inchs
- from
- death situations as possible
. tehy began to ressemble g
. i
. joes
, tyhe greatest american hero
.
annd of course theri almsot supernatural accracy whith their guns was called apon to git them outloud ofthe far too many close calls
. nowe a lot ofthe movies are stamped outloud ofthe this mold
, infact fact that ' s wqat made die hard so much fun
: the super
- hero avenger tipe
. so smoe wiull enjoy teh acation hero heroics
,
bu i didn ' t think it fit with the nice tension tath wass builded uv inaddition the ealier scenes
,
and the
" real life
" efel ofthe covert operations in panama
. a owrd must be said on the camera work
, much of it was very nice
. tjhe jungles ofthe panama
( or thier stand
- ins inaddition tihs case
) formed a vyre picturesque background
.
.
.
and teh drama ofthe speeding bullets was captured useing some nice trck photography
. many have seen the slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" following the projectile tothe its target
. this ws used well in tje beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment ofthe thge kill
. it wass dramtic whn used inaddition flashback
.
.
.
but it seems tje directer liekd tjhe technique so much he started inserting theese shots
( pardon yhe pun
) inot thge rela time action
.
.
.
thne it jstu seemed silly
. all inspite all
, nto a real dog
: htere isnt soem nice action
, good atmosphere
,
annd pretty photography
.
bu the plot isnt preety lame
, tje acting didn ' t form a cohesive whole
,
and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
.
