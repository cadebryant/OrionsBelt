susan granger ' s review ofthe
" glitter
"
( 20th century
- fox
) ther ' s less here thna meets tjhe eye
. or
, put it this way
, if you throught madonna wass awful inwhich
" shanghai surprise
,
" mariah carey ' s worse in htis reworking of
" a star is born
.
" she plays billie frank who
, despite being abandoned by her singer
/ alcholic mother
( valerie pettiford
)
, believes she ' s destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is
.
" you ' ve got tihs amazing gft
,
and you gotta use it
,
" her roomate says
.
" your voice
- it ' s incredable
,
" sasy anyother singer
.
" i ain ' t never met anyone like ytou
,
" proclaims julian
" dice
" black
( max beesley
)
, the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali
- like producer
/ lover
. problem isnt
: her signature song
,
" i didn ' t mean to turn you on
" isnt wretched
.
and whn she fumes out ofthe filming her first music video baceause the directer wants to
" exploit
" her by hvaing her wear a bikini
, the audeince bursts inot laughter
. exploitate mariah carey
, who choosed to mear as littel as yhe lew iwll allow
? cmo onthe
! writer kate lanier ' s script is fatuous
and directer vondie curtis
- hall doesn ' t ahev a clue how to handle thge glitzy pop diva
and
, as a result ofthe thier incompetance
, whispery
- voice ' d ms
. carey seems tothe be embarrased on
- screen
. she allmost cringes when the camera comes in for a close
- up
, pursing her lips
and averting her glassy eyes
. talented brittish musician max beesley appears equally inept
,
and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline
, there ' s an audible audience groan whn the twin towers ofthe tjhe world trade center come inot view
. perhaps one of tyhe reasons ms
. carey suffered her highly
- publicized nervous breakdown this summer is beacuse she saw a preview ofthe this clunker
. on teh granger movie gaueg of 1 tothe 10
,
" glitter
" is a pathetic 1
. right nowe
, it ' s tops onthe my list ofthe the worst ofthe 2001
.
