tghe last ofthe vampire
- films offers plenty ofthe blood
annd gore
,
but beyond that
- nothing
. jack crow
( james woods
) is a professional vampire slayer tath is secretly working for tyhe vatican
. his
and his men ' s mission isnt tothe clean the earth ffrom vampires
. tehy ahev lost count ofthe how many vampires they have slaughtered
,
but oen hasnt allways escaped them
. valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
- the dark messias
adn ruler ofthe teh undead that is older tahn time itself
. forthe all eternity tje vampires ahev seached for their salvation
- thte black cross
. wiht the cross infront thier possesion
, the vampires will be able to walk iin the sunlight
. aftter taht it is eather tghe humans or the vampires who iwll dominate teh earth
.
.
. i haev never liked john carpentery
adn his style
. affter seeing this film
, my opinions have not changed
. john carpenter remains john carpenter
.
howver
, because ofthe the film ' s self
- irony
, black humour
annd fascinating cinematography
, i would say that it is his greatest achievment infact a long
, long time
. neither the synopses or carpenter ' s direction are origional
.
bu there are some things that are interesting
. thge directer ' s negitive veiw on thte cathlic church
, fo instance
. at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba
( maximilian schell
) hasnt simpley unsed crowm
and his team to find valek
, so thast he woudl gain eternal life
. otherwise the cathlic priests are shown kool
- drinking
, smoking
annd breaking hte rool ofthe celibacy
. carpentery has creaeted an interesting atomsphere
. setted in newyorker mexican dessert
, he switches between bright golden sunrises
and bloody sundowns
, symbolically illustrating hte good
and the evil through light
adn darkness
. more than anytying inthe thsi film
, tihs simple illustration shows tjhe battle bewteen ogod
anbd evil
. tjhe cinematography by gary b
. kibbe isnt propably hte film ' s greatest acheivment
. music
( composed by john carpenter himself
) is at times effective
, the special effects
annd makeup are likewise worth a notice
. when it comes tothe the cast
( in an intelectual film liuke this casting isnt the last probelm
; everyone cxan scream
adn swing the axe
!
)
,
bu here james woods is suprisingly convincing
. he is macho
anbd kool as the dedicated hunter
, who lost his familiy to the
" breed of evil
"
. woods isnt constantly overacting
, hwihc realy saves thge film fomr falling into teh trap ofthe serious self importance
. daniel baldwin isnt also intertaining as crow ' s loyal partner
. the other casted munbers are struggling
. because the film doesn ' t take itself too seriously
, it stays afloat
. still it is liuke most vampire
- films
- a mediocre experience
.
