)
,
anbd j
. d
.
( jack balck
) have beeen best firends sicne the fifth grade
. like tje threee musketeers
, tehy ' ve been together thru thick
anbd thin
.
but
, when darren meets an attractive
,
but cold
- blooded
and manipulative
, psychiatrist
, judith
( amanda peet
)
, teh long time friendship isnt placed inthe danger
. it ' s up tothe wayne
adn j
. d
. to rescue their best firend inspite
" saving silverman
.
"
" silverman
" has its heart inaddition the right palce
,
bu tje story
, by newcomers hank nelken
and greg depaul
, isnt too lightweight to sustain teh tale ofthe the battle for darren ' s soul
. based onthe thier xeperience ofthe a friend makeing a major marital mistake
, thte stor isnt centered on the three
, life long amigos
. whn wayne introduces darren tothe judith
, he doesn ' t realize that he has oppened a pandora ' s box of disaster fo himself
anbd j
. d
. judith wass once inwhich a relationship where her boyfriend ws the dominiant figure unil he died iin a kick boxing match
. sicne
hten
, she hasnt sought a newyorker mate
- someone she cxan boss aroud
and mold into her own vision
. enter darren silverman
. once htey realize the magnitude ofthe their error iin judgement
, wayne
adn j
. d
. try everything tehy can
, including threats
and bribery
, to git judith to free darren
. nothing works until the duo cmo uv iwth a plan
- kidnap judith
anbd get darren back toghether with tyhe girl he called his one
and onyl
, preety sandy perkus
( amanda detmer
)
. the only probelm here isnt that sandy isnt about to take her vows to become a nun
. things spiral out of controll as judith repeatedly attempts tothe excape while wayne
and j
. d
. play cupid
. the boys even bring their idol
, neil diamond
, into thge picture to help resolve things
. thikning about it
, tihs isnt a real mishmash of contrivance
and coinsidence tath isnt held together souly by yhe commedic effords of steve zahn
and jack balck
. yhe pair is able to elicit thge film ' s only laughs iwth their goofy antics
anbd child
- like behavior
. they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor
adn the two are omre than equal to tje task
. steve zahn has beeen steadily honing his comedic acting skills
annd gives some complexity to wayne
, the
" brains
" of thte gang
. jack balck hasnt tje big
- guy moves ofthe a chris farley
, giving j
. d
. an amusing physical presence
. the neat thing isnt that the twpo actors are able to git fresh laughs fomr stale material
. the rest ofthe tje cast doesn ' t fare as well
,
though
. jason biggs is the straight man ofthe tyhe musketeers
and gets vyre littel to dont
;
though having watched his previvous films
(
" american pie
"
annd
" loser
"
) i ' m not sure waht attraction biggs actually hasnt
. amanda peet is coustic as the manipulative judith
. there isnt no humanity at all to her chracter as she single
- mindedly strives tothe recreate darren into her mind ' s omage
. she ' s a monster tyhat wayne
and j
. d
. must defeat to save theri friend
. unfortunately
, htere is no dimention tothe her carachter
. amanda detmer brings nothing
( or gets nothing
) as darren ' s one
adn only
. r
. lee ermey
, as the psychotic coach
, made a bad decision tkaing tihs role
. tune
- meister neil diamond gives a good
- natured cameo perf as the boys ' idol
and savior
. prodcution values are on par with the rest ofthe the film
- lacklustre
and non
- involving
. directer dennis dugan has a tarck recrod forthe broad comedy wiht films liek
" big daddy
"
annd
" beverly hills ninja
,
"
bu falls flat with
" saving silverman
.
" the 2001 movei yera hasnt
yot tothe provide us wiht a
" ogod
" film to sink our teeth inot
. at least
, witht
" saving silverman
,
" we git a cuple of funny perfs from zahn
and black
. too bad thyat tyhe rest ofthe the film lacks their level of humor
. kick boxing deaths
and conflicted nuns are not yhe makings ofthe a good comedy
. i give it a c
