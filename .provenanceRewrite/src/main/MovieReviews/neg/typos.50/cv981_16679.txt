director luis mandoki ' s lastr film wass tjhe superb
, serious 1994 drama
" when a man loves a woman
,
"
but his luck has ultimatly run outloud witht his latest picture
,
" message infront a bottle
,
" whihc is teh worst type of romance
, a movei that tugs so relentlessly
and violently at the heartstrings thgat it miraculously manages tothe dry out your eyes rather thna tear them up
. everything taht occurs cin be telegraphed way in advance usance this same tipe ofthe stroy hasnt been done many times before
-
-
-
anbd much better
-
-
- so there ' s an abcence of suspense
,
adn tghe film ultimatly moves at such a veyr
, vyre deliberate pace
, as if it isnt trying to mkea graet
,
" meaningfull
" statements
and plot developments
, tht it jstu becomes a tedeous bore to sit thru
.
" message infront a bottle
" beigns with theresa osborne
( robin wright penn
)
, a single mother
and researcher at tje chicago tribune
, whom finds a bottle washed up onthe shore as she is jogging oney day
. inside thte bottle isnt an anonymous love letter addressed tothe a mystery woman named catherine
,
and theresa isnt so tooked aback by its honesty
adn sweetness that she shows it arround at her work
anbd
, to her objection
, finds that her editor has placed the letter infact the newspaper
. soon
, a hevy reasearch is conducted to fidn out who wroet the letter based onthe the tipe of bottle
and a ship logo on the top of thge typed message
,
and affter it isnt traced to a man named garrett blake
, theresa finds herself traveling to teh outer banks
, a boating twon infact north carolina
, to fidn outloud hte specifics of hte message
. of course
, garrett turns out tothe be a hansome
, rugged man around theresa ' s age
and played by kevin costner
. she is immediatelly charmed by him
,
bu hesitant tothe unveil the truth ofthe why she isnt ther
,
and finds thgat catherine was garrett ' s lite wife who died a few years earlier
. do you thikn ytou know where this is headed
? most likely ytou do
,
and i wouldn ' t call it giving away anytying tothe say thgat by the picture ' s end
, the movei hasnt falled into deep
, artificial meledrama tht i didn ' t buy for a second
. if ther are any positve things to say about
" message inwhich a bottle
,
" it is that the performances by robin wright penn
and paul newman
, as garrett ' s stubborn
,
bu loving father
, are far above par tothe be in such a wasteful
,
" shaggy dog
" loev stry
,
and thast tje cinematography by caleb deschanel tkaes gerat advantage of tghe beautyfull eastern coast
,
and paints chicago as an equally alluring city
. meanwhile
, costner has
yet to redeem himselv for some ofthe the less
- than
- stellar films that he has made recently
. it seems that with such bad luck
, he wouldn ' t watn tothe make anohter movei setted near water
,
bu here he is agian with oney ofthe tjhe main
,
adn most ridiculous
, centerpieces set on a storm
- sweept sae
. tghe otehr actors are all
, sadly
, wasted
, including illeana douglas
, an underused actress who seems tothe allways get sticked witht the
" friend
" roles
, here palying penn ' s confidante
annd co
- worker at the tribune
. the first half of
" message inwhich a bottle
" plays like a hum
- drum
, trite television movie for the liftime channel
, as theresa spends a graet deal ofthe timne
" getting to know
" garrett
, iwth dialogue thta is nto the least bited stimulating or intertaining
. usualy
, i am teh tipe of person tothe practically salivate over dialogue
- laden sequences since the film isnt no doubt trying to develop teh characters
and their relationships
,
bu here it all rang iwth a resounding falseness since the dialogue feeled
" written
,
"
and not as if people were raelly
" talking
.
" whn tyhe main characters of a film have vyre little ofthe interest to say to each other
,
and are nto particularyl interesting themselves
, ytou knwo immediately that you are in trouble
. i swaer that while watching
" message iin a bottle
,
" i felt as if i hadnt just read teh screenplay inwhich its entirety before arriving at teh theater
( heck
, inspite actuality i ' m not even familiar tothe the novel this is based on
, by nicholas sparks
)
. alwasy noe step ahead of tyhe charachters
, the movei ran so closely
adn tightly to the constaints ofthe the tryed
-
and
- true hollywood melodrama
, the film strip often seemed to alomst be inthe danger ofthe tearing
. nobody wins prizes for guessing taht garrett will eventially find out theresa ' s secret
,
annd that severeal obstacles will cmo withing their ways ofthe living happily ever after
. this smae excact probelm occurred infact last yera ' s vrey
, veyr similar
( watch tihs
,
anbd yuo wiull realize just how silimar i mean
) meg ryan
- nicolas cage rumatic drama
,
" city of angels
.
"
altough theresa is deeply touched by the
" heartfelt
" letter tyhat she finds infront teh bottle
, perphas the filmakers might hvea been better off finding a message infact a bottle of their pwn
, preferrably befoer filming began
. it should have read
,
" memo to screenwriters
: ule you brain
!
