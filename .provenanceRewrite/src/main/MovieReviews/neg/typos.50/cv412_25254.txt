it seemed liek tjhe perfect consept
. whta better for hte farrelly brothers
, faymus fo wirting
and directing comedies with offensive subject marter
, than to mkae a movei about a guy iwth a split perosnality
? it ' s exactly the sort of thing yhe brothers relish
: poking funn at something serious
( infront this case mental illess
)
, throwing all care to the wind to git a laugh
. jim carrey ' s signed on too
? even better
. the national alliance fo hte menally ill even helped outloud by levying complaints against thge brothers ' newyorker film before its oppening
, claiming it wass misrepresenting teh condidtion of splitted perosnality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed liek just teh sort of thnig tath woudl
, of course
, onyl add more fuel to tghe farrelly brothers ' frie
, proving that smoe peopel just couldn ' t tkae a joke
,
and that the farrellys would be helping tje omre enlightened viewers tothe
yet anohter dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but oney hting whent wrong
: theri movei isn ' t funny
. it ' s nto fo lack ofthe trying
. tje farrellys utilize inwhich
" me
, mysef
& irene
" their most high
- consept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wief for a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his aggressive feelings deepo down inside
anbd never release them
. htis
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie ' s repressed agression manifests itself inot a second
, independetn personality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his precedessor had beeen unable tothe muster
. this guy isn ' t above crashing a car thru the wall ofthe tjhe barber shop infact hwihc he ' s beeen insulted
, or holding a little girl ' s head underwater beccause she refused to stop jump
- roping inaddition the street
.
thn things start getting lost inthe the most complicated plot teh farrellys hvea ever attemted
,
and thte film runs off its tracks
. soem have suggested that tihs isn ' t a problem
, because hte farrelly brothers ' brand ofthe humor doesn ' t require plot tothe work
. tehy ' re wrong
, of course
: plot wass greatly instrumental inaddition buliding up the kind of rollicking comic energy tht infused yhe farrellys ' last efford
, 1996 ' s
" there ' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers ' earlier film wasn ' t funny merely becuase it contained outrageous gags
( dispite wqat some newsmagazine articles would hve you belive
)
,
but rether because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed several times tothe pull off a neat sleight
- of
- hand trck
: they ' d hvea you thinking the storey ws goign one way
,
then reveal its rela direction in delightfully surprizing fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to hvea beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
annd saw onyl teh surface grossness
, missing all ofthe the subtle machinations tath relaly made it work
. haveing been produced by tjhe smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liek an even bigger disappointment
. the brothers pile on thge offensive humer
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illness
,
and all manner ofthe bathroom jokes
.
bu tehy haven ' t come uv with a way tothe amking any of it fresh
; most ofthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adolecent comedy
. tyhe plot
, with carrey forced to drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s iin moreso trouble thna anyone knows
, bakc to newyorker york
, has an ending that ' s entirely predictable ffrom the git
- go
.
( thikn charlie
and irene wiull fall infact love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then inctroduce scores ofthe diferent characters
,
and none of them ever manage tothe dont anything yuo haven ' t already expeced them tothe do
, no matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compaired to teh curveballs the farrellys are utilizied to throwing
, tihs stuff isnt almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: when gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it ' s no longer funny
, mearly gross
. yhe jokes that do work are milked over
and over until theri effectiveness runs dry
. take
, for example
, tghe subplot involving charlie ' s three black sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. thte incongruity ofthe it all is funny for a while
, wiht threee burly balck men discusting higher math infact ghetto lanugage
adn white
- bread carrey mouthing said language wiht an entirely too
- pleasent smile onthe his face
.
bu by the end of yhe film
, htey ' re still doing the smae schitck
; it hasn ' t beeen elevated to another
, funnier levle
,
and it hasn ' t been dropped eather
. that ' s too bad
, because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. ther ought to be moreso foucs onthe how other people react to charlie ' s new perosnality
,
annd on how charlie deals with thge consequences of hank ' s actions
. htis doesn ' t really happen
; nearly every supporting charcter lerans about charlie ' s condidtion early on
, so tehy don ' t have any oppertunity to be suprized by it
. thge film throws whta looks liuke a pattented farrelly curve in a scene towords teh midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pick uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
bu the scirpt doesn ' t go anywhere with it
, instead leaving the thread twisting infront the wind before awkwardly tying it up during hte climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physicaly
anbd vocally
,
bu he ' s left whith nothing much tothe do here exept contort hismelf in a manner similar tothe steve martin infact
" all of me
.
" it ' s a great showcase of flexability
anbd splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
but none of it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pull any stunts we don ' t expect him tothe pul
,
and hte farrellys ' script doesn ' t give him anything else tothe pull
: yhe situations inwhich whcih he must perform the role
- shifting aren ' t setted up inspite any meaningful way
. prehaps carrey cin take solace inwhich the fatc tath his supporting actors fare noone better
. zellweger ' s irene isnt not a strong female lead
; mary in
" mary
" may have beeen part adoelscent fantasy
,
bu she was also intelligent
adn storng
- willed
. irene isnt nothing in paticular
, as the film never makes clear whther she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as thge only
" sane
" person in the film
. chris cooper isnt stuck playing exactly noe onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his charachter isnt entirely too straight
- laced fo a movie like this
. he
, like the others
, does absolutly nothing unexpected
. aftter viewing tjhe shapeless mess thyat
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually dissolved inot
, i wass stuck wondering whether or nto tyhe farrellys had outsmarted themselves
. mabey theri kind ofthe comedy cant onyl work forthe so long until audiences get wise tothe it
annd stop bieng shocked
.
but i don ' t beileve it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprising thier audiences even affter people have grown attuned tothe thier sytle
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
adn i still thikn they are
)
, tehy ' ll rebound jstu fine
. even after that happens
,
though
, i ' ll still consider
" me
, mysef
& irene
" tothe be a high
- calaber misfire
.
