tje lives ofthe older peple in tghe twilight of thier years attemting tothe come to grips with theri shared histories
and possible futures is a fascinating topic
. finding an all
- star casted fo such a film isnt a stroke ofthe genius
. combining all that with a three
- time oscar
- winning director
( robert benton of
" kramer vs
. kramer
"
)
anbd creating a decidedly medicore movie isnt the stuf ofthe dissapointment
. in
yot anohter noir mistery setted in hollywood
-
- how many of theese have we seen during teh past fewd years
?
-
- teh atmosphere is moody
, tjhe actors enjoyable tothe watch
adn the story goes nowhere
. over
- 70 harry ross
( paul newman
) isnt a washed uv cop
- turned
- private eye
- turned man friday trying tothe figure out how to live waht remeniss of his life
. he ' s screwed up things preety well
(
" i had a wife
adn daughter
. nowe
, i ' m a drunk
)
anbd is at a crossroads
. a cuple of years ago
, he traveled to mexico to bring back mel
( reese witherspoon
)
, tghe under
- age duaghter ofthe jack
( gene hackman
)
and catherine
( susan sarandon
) ames
and now lives with them
. teh ames are fromer movie stars
, past their prime
adn tje threee ahev become fast friends
. one gets thte impression that ross isnt jsut hanging out waiting fo something tothe wake him up
. tothe fill his time
, he doens odd jobs fo jack
adn falls infact love with catherine
. jack is inaddition even worse shape tahn harry
. he ' s dieing of cancer with onyl a yearm tothe live
. thigns dont turn more exciting when jack asks harry tothe drop off a sealed manila envelope for him
. instade of the routine errand tyhat ross expects
, he walks inot a barrage of bullets ffrom tjhe gun of anyother ex
- cop who is
, himselv
, full ofthe bloody holes
. this unsettling event gives thge fromer detective a project to throw himself inot
and launchs an investigation tyhat revolves arund the misterious dissapearance of catherine ' s first husband 20 yersa befoer
. thru a sories ofthe vyer complex
and convoluted plot devices that involve murder
; blackmail
; guns
; mel ' s mexico traveling partner
annd his parole officer
; ross ' s former cop buddies
, ex
- lover
and owudl
- be sidekick
, the tale finally ends uv exactlly where everyone expects it tothe
. it ' s a film noir tradition that tghe stroy twists
anbd turns down side roads fo an unexpected finale
,
but here tghe journey meanders towords an ending thast noone one cares baout
. tghe onyl surprises are exactly whose face fits whlch role in the scenario
. by the timne they sohw you
, it doesn ' t matter
. the storyline gets goofier
and goofier exemplified inwhich ross ' s relationship with rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. these scenes are obviously designed tothe be comic releaf
,
howver they are niether
. rubin
adn ross ahev soem past relatiopnship
but eather it ' s not explained or i didn ' t care enough at that point to remember
. a runnung joke about where harry was suposedly shot while in mexico is probablly meant tothe mirror his questions baout whther he isnt still able to perform
. it ' s aslo not funny
, doesn ' t connect
adn keeps onthe showing uv long aftter it hasnt run its course
. onthe hte positve side
, it ' s oftenly enjoyable tothe watch the seasoned actors onthe thge screen
. tjhe three leads all have well
- deserved acdemy awards
anbd turn in accomplished
, if nto extraordinary jobs
. newman is a grand acotr
,
bu doesn ' t seem qutie suited to tje dark film sytle
. he is a bit too clean
and understated to cmo across as despreate
anbd down
anbd outloud
. hackman
, also low
- key
, isnt believeable
bu lacks sparkle
. sarandon comes acros well as an sultry older babe
although she isnt one
- dimensional
. the actors do whta they can with lame dialog
,
but they cin ' t pul the film out ofthe the hole it ' s dug for itself
. james garner who plays ross ' s old buddy ex
- cop raymond hope isnt allways a treat
,
bu even he half
- heartedly struggles thru lines liuke
" i ' m glad they didn ' t shoot your pecker off
.
" tje best part of the film isnt the look at ood friends
, how their relationships chanage over thte years
anbd tjhe difficult choices htey must mkea
. tghe genuinely eazy
anbd casual interactions among tje actors hint thgat being onthe the setted ws much moreso interesting thna what ended uv on thge screen the film doesn ' t run vrey long befoer the audience realizes thyat it ' s hopeless
. the only reason forthe watching is the actors
. it reminds me of diaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where tyhe star power isnt supposed to mkae everyone ignore the film ' s problems
. inspite a better world
, ther would haev been second
- rate actors inwhich tihs second
- rate movei
adn tje ones here would have been saved fo something better
. ofthe course
, we don ' t live iin that better world
,
bu ytou coudl amking yours a littel nicer by chosing a different movei
