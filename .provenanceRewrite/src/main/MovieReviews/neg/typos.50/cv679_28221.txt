" pokemon 3
: tje movie
" has a lot ofthe bad thigns in it
. first ofthe all it ' s a plot heavy mess that hasnt bad voice talents
, badly written scirpt
adn fantastic animation
. hte first film cameback outloud the end of 1999
and wass a huge hit grossing almost
$ 90 milion domestically
. a sequel soon folowed
and even made
$ 45 million
. warner hasnt released their thrid movie based onthe the immensely popular video gaem
and tv sories
and its a waste ofthe tiem
and celluloid
. htis time ash ketchum
annd his friends are onthe their way tothe thge johto battles
( whcih my littel brother told me tje newyorker spinoff is
" pokemon
: the johto journies
" so go figure
) anyway he comes infront contact with a young girl who ' s father hasnt disapeared after trying to dicover thge unown
. tehy are small pokemon wih a powerful punch
and have gerat psyhic abilities
. the unown bring toghether theri psyhic abilities
anbd create entei a poverful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly ' s hous
and creates every wish she wnats
. now it ' s up to ash
and his friends tothe stpo this pokemon entei
anbd sohw him tothe be a ogod pokemon rether than a bad one
. too bad realy tath htis isnt a bad movei
, suprisingly the first movie ws entertaining
and somewhat absorbing
, the second was a piece of trash
annd thsi noe is almsot inwhich between
. it hasnt soem ogod qualities
( animation
, message inaddition tyhe end
)
bu hte flaws seem to overpower hte goods
. i ' m still not sure whta the big thnig is baout pokemon
, tehy are ugli little animals who speak thier own nmae for thier langauge
( besides meowth
, my personal favorite
)
and you don ' t understand waht they are saying
. my littel brother jstu throught tyhe movei was amazing
,
and i kept leaneant over
and asking him happenned
, or what pokemon that was
. his responce wass a big lecture of how htis is that
,
annd taht is htis
.
.
. he sure did put me in my place
. iwth the second
and thrid movie being bad
, i hvae a feeling pokemon 4
: thge movie might be a total bust as well
.
" pokemon 3
: teh movei
" has smoe redeeming qualities forthe the kids
,
adn tyhe pokemon fans wiull dig every minute of htis film
. for those parents
and
/ or brothers
and sisters who have to sit through htis
.
.
. bring a pillow
.
