we sould paraphrase michelle pfieffer ' s charcter in dangerous minds
anbd say thgat beyond rangoon starts with an
" a
.
" thyat ' s fair anough
. all movies
, like all skool children
, shoudln be given the benefit ofthe the doubt
. tghe chance tothe succeed
. after all
, we liek tothe htink that tje right combination of talent
and effort can dont wonders
. mountains can be moved
,
and ogod movies can be made
. yeah right
. children fail
, as dont films
. as does director john boorman ' s latest
. the success ofthe beyond rangoon hinges onthe the believability of patricia arquette
( ed woud
, true romance
) as the busty westerner
- inwhich
- peril wandering baout 1988 burma wihtout a passport
.
though we can stomach tyhe mild plot contrivances that get her htere
, it ' s a tougher task tothe overlook hte actress
. she ' s a lightweight
. as the first scene
( witht narration
!
) demonstrates
, she doesn ' t haev
* nearly
* enough range fo the emotions tyhat her character
-
- a mother fleeing the memories ofthe a murdered husband
adn son
-
- is suppossed to show
. she may give a stronger performance tahn
, say
, keanu reeves inspite a walk infact the clouds
, by not by much
. beyond rangoon isnt a veyr physically appealling film
, thanks to the practiced craftsmanship ofthe john boorman
( deliverance
, excalibur
, hope
and glory
)
. he keeps thge narrative moving
, noone marter how muddy the story
-
- or the heroine
-
- gets
. why he chose arquette rimaniss a mistery
,
though
. maeby he wass thikning tyhat the dramatic weight of thte story woudl overcome any casting deficiencies
.
but even aftter an hour of half
- stated political statements
and murky mass killings
, we
* still
* don ' t knwo enough ofthe what ' s happening iin tihs ocuntry tothe efel distressed for tjhe characters or their situations
. empty exoticism
. the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix
, combining lush jungle photography wih bad blue
- screen work
. allso odd isnt hte obvious dubbing
. done tothe amke smoe ofthe hte foreign charactors soudn less forein
?
and
, is it my mistake
, or dont the smae extras keep reappearing as diferrent soldiers
?
? doo doo doo doo
.
[
" twilight zone
" theme
, or oppinion of movie
