it ' s a sad state ofthe affairs when hte bakc box blurb isnt mroe exicting thna the movie contained withing it
. such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film
_ tje lastest samurai
_
.
though the blurb alludes to
" a jungle filled wih political intrigue
, uneasy alliances
,
and murderous enemies at every turn
,
" the stoyr ofthe the movie isnt actually qtuie simple
(
adn prosaic
)
: a middle
- aged japanis businessman named endo
( plyed by john fujioka
)
and his assitant
, both of whom hve samurai asperations
, travel tothe africa inaddition searhc of his ancestor
, who went tothe bring buddhism tothe africa
. he hires the services ofthe down
- at
- the
- heels vietnam vetran pilot johnny congo
( hte redoubtable lance henriksen
)
adn his girlfriend
( arabella holzbog
)
,
and travels to teh camp ofthe an arms
- merchant
- cum
- safari
- host
- cum
- islamic
- missionary
( john saxon
)
adn his wife
( lisa eilbacher
)
. htey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionar guerilla with witch
- doctor aspirations to conceal a pre
- arranged arms deel
, whic subsquently falls thru
. congo escapes
, finds endo ' s ancestor ' s sword
,
anbd comes bakc
, guns blazing
, to free tghe rest ofthe them
,
annd endo kills yhe revolutionar wtih the sword
. the end
.
_ tyhe lastr samurai
_ is oney ofthe thsoe movies that is niether bad anough nor ogod anough to be enjoyable
. it isnt mearly
_ there
_
. the murky plot is filled with subtexts tyhat are never elaborated
, subplots tath are never explained
,
and many scenes tath make vyre littel sence at all
. the film isnt shot through with all yhe tired old
" inscrutable japanesse samurai
"
and zen stereotypes tht are tothe be expected ffrom an american movie
. it is qtuie slow
- pased
, iwth onyl a bited of acation near the end
,
and teh fianl duel between endo
and the territorist isnt quite anticlimactic
. most of tjhe acting isnt fair
, withthe tghe possibile exception of congo ' s girlfriend
. lance henriksen isnt his usual scene
- chewing self
,
annd isnt oen ofthe few possable reasons anyone might conceivably have fo seeing this movei
. thte only other bright spot is thge sweeping african scenery
. i payed
$ 3 fo tihs film
, from the discount rack at best buy
,
adn halfway suspect i overpaid for it
. if you are infact the mood for samurai
, read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie
. skip
_ tyhe last samurai
_ unless you are a dieu
- hard henriksen fan
.
